"event","Woo... I haven't been blogging for quite awhile. Poor blog. I'm not going to blame work this time. I was just plain lazy. Kekeke. 

Anyway, since my last very happy post, there were two rather sad events that have taken place. 

Firstly, one of my housemates from uni passed away in Oct. 
Secondly, one of Ian's closest friends (also his housemate) also passed away in Oct. 
I spent my Hari Raya holidays attending funerals and prayers.
It is so sad simply because they were both so young. 25 and 28 respectively. One can only wonder why they had to go so soon, but I suppose death is one of those mysteries in life that we will never understand. One thing for sure, this series of unfortunate events clearly made me think about my life, and how much I take it for granted. It sounds clich<em><em>&eacute;</em></em> , but I really want to life my live to the fullest now. Cherish every moment. Even the lousy and stressful moment becauce you never know when it will be your last day here on earth. 

On a brighter note, I've started planning my wedding. Hehe. Well, not much progress so far. But I've been looking at wedding photographers. I absolutely LOVE Jessica Claire's <a href=""http://jessicaclaire.net/"">work</a>. She's a US-based photographer. Obviously WAAAAYYY out of my budget. The 2 other photographers I might consider are <a href=""http://jennysunphotography.blogspot.com/"">Jenny Sun</a> and <a href=""http://www.anna-rina.com/"">Anna Rina</a>. I love the natural-look of their pictures. I can't stand studios who over-edit the pictures until the couples look as if they're in some fairytale or dreamland. Like, hello, I want to look like ME. Not some pore-less, flawless china doll. Of course I welcome any friends who would like to volunteer their photography services. We can discuss the fee in private la ok?And if any of you got some great photographers to recommend, do let me know! 
<p>I've also been looking at dresses. So far <a href=""http://www.prettyinwhite.com.my/"">Pretty In White</a> seems to have a nice (although slighty pricey) selection. Again, all you newly-weds are more than welcomed to offer some advice. :D 

What else. Hmm... Christmas is coming, and I've applied for leave from 14th Dec until Jan2010. Woohoo! That's 3 weeks of FUN and REST. And, I did the unthinkable - I JOINED A GYM! Hahahaha. Celebrity Fitness to be exact. So happened that they opened a branch near my house. It's good la, can work off those Christmas yummies. :D I plan to go for Yoga and Dance classes. Not really a fan of the machines. They're rather itimidating, and some are not friendly to short people. 

I'm going for an Olympus user gathering tomorrow at the Royal Selangor Visitors Center (which is just 5mins from my house!). I'll get to test the brand new Olympus PEN EP-2! I'm sooo excited! :D 

Maybe if I don't feel lazy, I'll post an update on that next wekk. Hopefully, with photos.

"event","I'm a shy person. I don't really like to be in the center of attention. So even though many of my colleagues have had roses sent to the office from various romantic guys, I've explicitly told my prince &quot;YOU ARE NOT TO SEND ANY FLOWERS TO THE OFFICE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES - BIRTHDAYS OR ANNIVERSARIES INCLUDED&quot; <br /><br />So imagine my horror when a HUGE bouquet of red roses arrived at the office on Friday.<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fruitrophillies/pic/0000fh38/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt=""bouquet"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fruitrophillies/pic/0000fh38/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br />I was actually having a quick lunch because I was about to leave for a presentation at a client's place. As I walked back to my place, Sharon, our receptionist was grinning at me saying, &quot;Hey, there you are. There's a delivery for you.&quot; And Jackie, our traffic manager was grinning as well. And I was like' &quot;Huh? What's happening.&quot; Typical blur me. Jackie then escorted me to my place right at the back of the office. She said, &quot;There's a big big big surprise for you... hehehhe...&quot; Then I saw it. 24 red roses sitting on my desk. Nora said,&quot;They'd better be from your boyfriend!&quot; LOL. That was funny. Imagine if they weren't! Hahahaha.<br /><br />So anyway, I opened the card, and it said,&quot;<em>From my heart to yours. Lovey wovey you. See you at 8. XOXO, Ian</em>&quot; Instead of swooning like half the girls in office, I called Ian immediately and said &quot;Idiot! I told you not to send flowers to the office! What are you doing? What did you plan? What's the surprise? Tell me now!!!!&quot; <br /><br />He just laughed at me. As usual.<br /><br />Since I had to rush off for my presentation, I left it at that, and headed off to sell some scripts. Along the way I kept demanding to know what's the surprise and he wouldn't tell me. Argh. <br /><br />I got back to the office at about 4 and went straight into a con-call. By then, half the office knew I got flowers. (Thanks to all who tweeted about it) I tried to finish up as much work as I could before 8pm. But it was quite difficult as I was bombarded with a slew of questions from my lovely colleagues. The conversations I had were mainly like this:<br /><br /><span style=""color: rgb(51, 153, 102);"">Colleague: Wah! Roses. Are they from your boyfriend?</span><br /><span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"">Me: Yes.</span><br /><span style=""color: rgb(51, 153, 102);"">Colleague: Oh? Is it your birthday? Anniversary?</span><br /><span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"">Me: No. He just sent me flowers to annoy me.</span><br /><span style=""color: rgb(51, 153, 102);"">Colleague: *gasp*&nbsp;He's going to propose!</span><br /><span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"">Me: No. He is doing this to annoy me.</span><br /><span style=""color: rgb(51, 153, 102);"">Colleague: How long have you guys been together?</span><br /><span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"">Me: 5 years</span><br /><span style=""color: rgb(51, 153, 102);"">Colleague: And how old is he?</span><span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);""><br />Me: 28</span><span style=""color: rgb(51, 153, 102);""><br />Colleague: *gasp* He is going to propose!!!!</span><br /><br />-______________________- &quot;<br /><br />Soon it was 8pm, and I promised my dear friends and colleagues that I will tweet as soon as I find out the prawn behind the rock <em>(udang di sebalik batu)</em><br /><br />My prince arrive on time. I asked him what are we having for dinner. He said Victoria Station. And I said I felt like having Japanese. And he said he already made reservations. So I said nevermind. Steak it shall be. <br /><br />But like all things with Ian, you can never quite be sure if he is conning you or being serious. True enough, we did not end up at Victoria Station. ARGH again. Instead, we ended up at Nikko Hotel. And HE&nbsp;DID&nbsp;MAKE&nbsp;RESERVATIONS.... AT&nbsp;A&nbsp;JAP&nbsp;RESTAURANT! <br /><br />-______________________- &quot; again!!!!<br /><br />(Do not read on if you are fasting now. Food pics galore.)<br /><br />Apparently his cousin recommended this place - Benkay Restaurant. A top restaurant in Tatler for 2009. <br /><br />So posh hor?<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fruitrophillies/pic/0000gk6e/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fruitrophillies/pic/0000gk6e/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fruitrophillies/pic/0000h7k6/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fruitrophillies/pic/0000h7k6/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br />My fave salmon sashimi:<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fruitrophillies/pic/0000k076/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fruitrophillies/pic/0000k076/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br />The real Jap tofu.

I saw him taking out a red box and I freaked out &quot;HEY! What are you doing?!!!&quot;&nbsp;<br /><br />And he grinned.<br /><br />And I went, &quot;No. You are not proposing to me in this restaurant! Shy leh!&quot;<br /><br />And he grinned.<br /><br />And I went &quot;Nooo.... don't laaaaaa&quot;<br /><br />And so he didn't. <br /><br />He paid and I was silently congratulating myself for having escaped a public proposal when I realised we were standing in the lobby, in front of a GIANT wedding cake (talk about signs), and a live band. And he said,&quot; How about here?&quot;<br /><br />And I went &quot;NOOO! This is worse! I'd rather we go&nbsp; back to the restaurant. <br /><br />And he grinned.<br /><br />And I went &quot;Don't you dare... Don't Don't Don't!&quot;<br /><br />In the end we found a quiet spot near their indoor garden, and he proposed there. And I said YES!<br /><br />(Looking back, I feel so bad for not letting him propose wherever he wanted to. But I'm positive I would have died... which would then defeat the purpose of the proposal)<br /><br />So that was the prawn behind the rock of roses. <br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fruitrophillies/pic/0000w7as/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fruitrophillies/pic/0000w7as/s320x240"" alt=""bling!"" /></a><br /><br />A diamond ring.

So, we moved house last week, and this is the 1st week we're staying in the new place. Unfortunately I've been working late this past few days, so I haven't really had the chance to enjoy my new place as much as I want to. There's still quite a lot of stuff at the old place.

"event","&nbsp;It's JUNE! Whee... What better way to welcome the month of June than with a birthday celebration? :D&nbsp;<br /><br />I received countless of wishes on SMS, Facebook, MSN, Twitter and the like. So thanks to all who wished me. *hugs*<br /><br />My birthday celebration this year was simple and sweet. On Sunday (May 30th), my prince and I headed to Westin Hotel for their Dim Sum Buffet brunch. We looked at the menu for 10 minutes and gave up because we've never had to order dim sum from a menu before. Usually we'll just take whatever we want to eat from the tray that goes from table to table without knowing the name of the dishes. Seeing that we were rather jakun, the waiter offered to bring a bit of everything for us to try. The food looked good and tasted great. We couldn't stop taking pictures and the head chef soon noticed our antics. Surprisingly, he came over to chat about cameras, and how he loves taking photos of food, which in turn made his boss really happy because he can cook the food AND shoot the photos for the menu. Cost-cutting indeed.&nbsp;<br /><br />After stuffing ourselves, we headed across the road to Pavilion to jalan-jalan a bit before going to Bangsar Shopping Center to meet Mary and the gang. We arrived at Coffee Bean around 2pm at chilled til about 6pm. It was great fun meeting up,talking crap and making a mess of the table. Haha. Made me miss uni terribly! Our yum cha session ended with a plan for a road trip in July. All in all, a very fruitful meet-up. :)<br /><br />We got home and soon it was time for dinner with my family. (Yes, as you can see, the whole day was just about sitting and eating) We wanted try out the relatively new seafood restaurant nearby but it was packed like nobody's business. (Well, technically it's their business) There was also a wedding dinner going on upstairs. We stood around for about 5 minutes and no one entertained us so we left. It started to rain so we decided to go to our usual 'peng-leng-jeng' (Cheap, nice, tasty) restaurant - Tian Tian Lai (Every Day Come). Although it wasn't a glam place, I was really happy, simply because I was having dinner with my family - something that doesn't happen often.&nbsp;<br /><br />The next day (1st June) was my birthday! Yay! But it was also a Monday. Boo. Had to leave extra early to make it for our weekly Monday meeting. Stepped into the conference room and was greeted by a chorus of HAPPY BIRTHDAY. Thanks peeps. I know it's not easy being cheery and perky on a Monday morning. Got some birthday gifts and had lunch with the creative peeps at Decanter. It was also a fellow colleagues birthday that day, so it was a fitting double celebration. <br /><br />Went home relatively early. Stepped into my room and found my earring box on my desk instead of my dresser. Puzzled, I turned to look at the dresser only to find an earring tree in its place. I've always wanted an earring holder and my prince remembered. :)&nbsp;He had hung all my earrings on the tree too! There was also a blueberry cheese cake waiting for me, my fav.&nbsp;<br /><br />So was it a happy birthday?&nbsp;<br /><br />YES.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br type=""_moz"" />"

The idea was simple: Sing a great song and sing it well. <br /><br /><strong>Reason #2</strong><br />There was a twist. No one expected her to sing so incredibly, but she got almost everyone on their feet by the end of the performance.<br /><br />But most of all...<br /><br /><strong>Reason #3</strong><br />The response was overwhelming. <br />- 26 million vuews on YouTube alone.<br />- Press coverage from Australia to United States.<br />- News reports and interviews from major TV networks like CNN, CBS and BBC.<br />- Millions tweet-ed about her on Twitter (including Ashton Kutcher and wife Demi Moore)<br />- Appeared on the Larry King show. (And apparently, Oprah has invited here to be on her show as well)<br />- 34,000 blog search results on Google.<br />- 3 million search results on Google.<br />- Thousands of fans in Facebook.<br />- A wiki entry!<br />- A fan site!<br /><br />And all that in less than a week. I think she's more popular than Earth Hour by now. <br /><br />Personally, I'm just so inspired by her performance, and her optimistic view on life. She's so genuine... something that's rare in today's world, especially in the advertising industry. <br /><br />And she has made me realise, that if she can live her dream, so can I. <br /><br />Susan Boyle, I wish you all the best. And don't let Simon Cowell boss you around when he signs you up!<br /><br /><br />"

However, due to the tough economic situation, our company has decided to break that tradition. So, I actually contemplated paying for my own airfare there, and somehow, try to sneak into the festival. :P But due to my own tight budget, I've decided that I wouldn't be able to attend Adfest after all, which is quite sad, coz I've been hoping to go for it since <a href=""http://fruitrophillies.livejournal.com/94090.html"">last year</a>.<br /><br />Then just one week before Adfest, my boss tells me that I'm going to Adfest! This decision was based on our regional creative awards. Teams who win best of category get to go to Adfest, courtesy of BBDO Asia Pacific! I was shocked... and happy... so happy that I couldn't sleep the night before take off. <br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fruitrophillies/pic/0000b4rg/""><img height=""240"" border=""0"" align=""left"" width=""320"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fruitrophillies/pic/0000b4rg/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Adfest was a real eye-opener. Seeing the quality of work submitted, I now understand why we have to rethink our ideas again and again. The standards are impossibly high, and your work must really stand out from the sea of entries in order to win. It has to be cutting edge. <br /><br />I learnt a lot about advertising in Adfest. But most of all, I learnt a lot about myself. <br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fruitrophillies/pic/0000d1fd/""><img height=""240"" border=""0"" align=""left"" width=""320"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fruitrophillies/pic/0000d1fd/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I learnt that I need to be able to talk to strangers better. <br />I learnt that I need to be more proactive.<br />I learnt that I need exercise. <br />I learnt that I'm really lucky to get this opportunity.<br />I learnt that I'm a long way behind many of the world's greatest creatives. <br />I learnt that I can do more if I believe in myself. <br />I also learnt that I would like to go for Adfest 2010... <br /><br />My trip cost BBDO Asia Pacific about RM4500 (Flight + 3N accomodation + delegate fee). <br />And all I paid was RM45 for a 90min Thai massage. <br /><br />I think the true payment lies in the amount of awards I can win for the coming year. <br /><br />It will be tough, but for the sake of Adfest 2010, I will try my very best. <br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fruitrophillies/pic/0000c47y/""><img height=""240"" border=""0"" align=""left"" width=""320"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fruitrophillies/pic/0000c47y/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br /><br />"

You can miss a farewell party for 2 colleagues.
You can think of many possible campaign names and not end up with a single definitive name. 
You can eat 1 maggi cup, 5 pieces of nuggets, 3 strings of fries and 1 cup of nestum for dinner.
You can listen to people talk about random things til 4am. 
You can miss out on a lovely home-cooked meal.
And, you can put up with all this because you know that single idea is bigger than anything you've ever thought of."

"event","I can't believe it's December already. And as the year comes to an end, I can't help but wonder about how next year would be like. Would it be just like this year, or will there be greater challenges ahead. Of course there's the economy gloom and also the lame ass state of the country. But would I be able to change things that are actually in my control? <br /><br />Well, I &quot;dug&quot; up my <a href=""http://fruitrophillies.livejournal.com/2008/01/19/"">first entry of the year</a>. I wrote about a wish list for 2008. Let's see if I've fulfilled any.<br /><br /><span style=""color: rgb(0, 128, 128);""><strong>To work more efficiently so that I can go home earlier.</strong><br />This happens on certain days, but mostly, it's the unpredictable nature of advertising that makes this a lost cause. Haha.  <br /><br /><strong>To write an award-winning radio ad.</strong><br />Well, I made a step in the right direction. Submitted a radio campaign for Olympus and a single piece for Pepsi in this year's Kancil. Didn't make the cut, but the dream continues for 2010. <br /><br /><strong>To be more assertive.</strong><br />Hm, not quite sure how do I measure this. <br /><strong><br />To know when to argue, and when to give in.</strong><br />Also, no idea how to determine if I've done this.<br /><br /><strong>To pay more attention to details.</strong><br />Ok la, this one got progress.<br /><strong><br />To avoid eating late/ eating fast food.</strong><br />Been eating oats and salad. Also brought food from home for dinner. So, yay!<br /><br /><strong> To keep in touch with my friends.<br /></strong>Haha, I'll let my friends be the judge for this. I'm trying! I'm trying! <br /><br /><strong>To be more patient when dealing with my parents.<br /></strong>Doing good here. <br /><strong><br />To divide my time equally for my darling, my family, my friends, work and myself.</strong><br />Tough. But managed to do so. Need to take leave throughout the year to do this better. <br /><br /><strong>To make myself heard.<br /></strong>I think I'm 3dBs louder now.<br /><br /><strong>To keep my dreams alive and make them happen.</strong><br />World Youth Day in Spain, here I come! <br /><br /><strong>To be thankful for what I have.<br /></strong>Sometimes yes, sometimes no. <br /><br /><strong>To do my part in making life better for someone else.</strong><br />Hmmm...<br /><strong><br />And to always look on the bright side of life. </strong><br />Somehow, this was really tough to do.</span><br /><br /><br />Overall, I think I've done well work-wise. So far I've been part 2 very successful brand plan presentations of which I was project leader for one. It was massive one too - a 5 campaign brand plan. Things like that may not win me a Gold Lion or a Black Pencil, but they help me grow into a well-rounded creative person. I wouldn't want to be a creative who can only think of award-winning ideas. I want to be a creative who can make the most out of a tiny budget. A creative who can present well, who can manage a team, who can identify what works and what doesn't, to know a good strat from a bad one, even a creative who understands media terms like YOY, YTD, SOW and SOS.&nbsp;<p>I've also had a great time at the Kancils and DMAM Awards. Got Silvers, Bronzes and Merits. And although I'm officially not eligible for the Young Creative Award anymore, there's still Young Guns. :)&nbsp; And, I'm also hoping to go for Adfest next year. It would be my first &quot;offshore&quot; award show experience.&nbsp;<br /><br />So if I were to write a wish list for next year, it would probably go something like this.<br /><br />- Write an award-winning radio ad. <br />- Win an international award.<br />- Rekindle my love affair with photography. <br />- Manage tai chi masters better.<br />- Perfect my salsa spinning techniques.<br />- Try to save more money. <br />- Try to earn more money.<br />- Spend more time with my family, friends and prince.<br />- Play more Wii. <br />- Find time to volunteer.<br />- Find time to go on a retreat.<br />- Find time to talk to God.<br /><br />And, it may be tough, but I still want to try and look on the bright side of life. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p><br />"

1.Did I do the best I could... or not? 
2.Did I do all that I could have done... or not? 
3.Did I let people down... did I let myself down... or not? 

I know I will do better next time. And I'll remember not to be so kind.

For now, I'll just refuse to put myself down over just one thing. Because I've been fabulous on so many other things.

So, I'll get back to work and remind myself that:

1.Yes, I did.
2.Yes, I did.
3.No, I did not. 

It was a painful day. But I will bounce back as a stronger and wiser person. 

And to my dear sister: Happy 10th Birthday."

There's nothing funny about this state of neglect, except that I don't know if it is because of laziness or busyness. It's probably a combination of both. 

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fruitrophillies/pic/0000a04e/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fruitrophillies/pic/0000a04e/s320x240"" width=""180"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

Anyway, ever since I moved to Proximity, I've been able to go home slightly earlier than when I was at BBDO. And I think the reason for this is because I no longer have to go to the audio house or post-production house. Being out of the office has its perks, but the feeling of dread that greets me when I return to office at 6pm and finding new briefs on my desk is something I do not miss. Writing for DM and the web is definitely different from writing for press, TV and radio... a writing style that I'm still getting used to. 

Another highlight of the past 3 months would be the ICI Dulux Workout that was held in Singapore on Sept 18-19. It was a great experience meeting the regional creatives from Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam. I do hope I can go for more of these workouts in future. And hopefully, it will be in a more exotic location... like Barbados... or Romania... Hehe. 

The Kancil deadline is only a week away. And to be honest, although there is still much to be done, I can't wait for 10 Oct to arrive. Sigh. Maybe the pre-submission stress is getting to me. I think I have about the same number of entries this year as compared to last year. However I have entries in categories I did not have last year, so we shall see how that turns out. I will definitely not win the Rebel Idea again, but I do hope to win something in the Radio category, seeing that it is one of the toughest mediums to write for.

Oh, and my brother came back for a 2 week visit, and left for Vietnam again today. It's funny how I never really felt sad that he isn't around. OR missed him. But during those 2 weeks that he was back, I realised that I do love him very much. Despite the ""childhood crimes"" he has committed against me, ie hiding my toys, stealing my marbles and mutating my barbie dolls, he is still my one and only brother. Cliche as it may sound, nothing can ever replace family. And I'm thankful for this long Raya break because I can spend some quality time with my family. Yes, it is unthinkable that I live with my parents and sis and yet we do not have time to hang out together. Maybe it is time to make some adjustments to my way of life. 

To all my friends who are celebrating Hari Raya, have a good one."

But then, I've never really played football to begin with... until last Sunday.</p> <p>My prince and I took part in the Pepsi Longest Dribble record breaking attempt for the Malaysian Book of Records. Our kick off was supposed to be at 6pm at BSC. We were there at about 5.30pm. I was nervous-lah. All sorts of negative thoughts went through my head: &quot;What if I dribble into the next lane?&quot;, &quot;What if a car hits the ball and crashes?&quot;, &quot;What if I faint halfway?&quot;</p> <p>Anyway, I ignored all those thoughts and waited for the kick-off. Soon, a bus came to pick us up. We were dropped off as various bus stops along the way. I was dropped off in front of Caltex near Lorong Travers. My prince was dropped off further up near the National Museum. So I stood there, waiting for the ball to come. After about 20 minutes, a group of dribblers arrived, followed by a van. There was also a traffic police to escort the whole group. Coolness!</p> <p>So I dribbled for 500m I think. And by the time I was done, I couldn't feel my legs. After all, I'm not exactly a very fit person. LOL. We were rewarded with some free Pepsi. And although I don't drink soft drinks that much, I think Pepsi Twist is quite nice.</p> <p>Anyway, I had lots of fun.</p> <p>Here are some pics:</p><p>The Pepsi Football van:</p> <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fruitrophillies/pic/00007h1z/""><img height=""240"" border=""0"" width=""320"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fruitrophillies/pic/00007h1z/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br />The goodie bags:<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fruitrophillies/pic/00008z3h/""><img height=""240"" border=""0"" width=""320"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fruitrophillies/pic/00008z3h/s320x240"" alt=""goodie bag"" /></a>"

I took a short break last weekend and headed to the unnaturally clean and impeccably safe island of Singapore...which is now a little bigger after they got Pedra Branca. I went there for the Great Singapore Sale which somehow didn't seem so great after all. I bought a pair of super duper highly recommended ultra comfy Geox shoes, 10 pairs of earrings, a bag for my lil sis and a gift for a dear friend. And...that's it! I amazed myself by not buying a single baju. I suppose after 'fasting' from shopping for the past 2 months, I've lost the urge to shop for anything. Well, almost anything...since I bought a Nintendo Wii a few days ago! Whee! Wii! Yippee! Anyway, I'm sharing the Wii with my prince. Got interest free installment. I hate paying installments, but I guess I can bear with it coz it is a Wii after all. So far it's been fun to play. Only started on Wii Sports. My lil sis is good though. 

Other than shopping, I paid a visit to the newly opened Peranakan Museum in Singapore. It's worth a visit. Also met up with some buddies. Walked a lot. Chilled with cousin...and that's it. Well, my dear prince and I left a bag of chocos worth SGD80 in the Changi Budget Terminal... wuwuwuw, but at least we remembered our duty free liquor and fragrance. So yea, that was my short holiday. 

Some big changes are taking place but I can't say what it is. Just gonna adopt a 'wait and see' attitude.

Been thinking a lot about what I want in life. And I haven't figured it out. I suppose I'll just be thankful for now."

So for the past few months, I've been trying my very best to make the most of my package. Yes, it is hard to believe that one has to work hard to spend more on calls/SMSes, but it's true! And sad to say, I failed. Of course when there's a celebration, like Christmas or CNY, it's easy to reach the targeted amount because I'll be mass-messaging and replying mass-messages sent to me. But on normal un-happening months... zzzz

And when last month's bill arrived, it was evident that I have to use my phone more. 
So I wasn't surprised when my dear prince said, ""Dear, you are not making enough calls. Talk more. Call your girlfriends.""
But I was surprised to hear my reply, ""I don't have any girlfriends left to call.""

As soon as I said that, I realised I'm suffering from Girlfriend Deficiency  Syndrome. You see, after most of my girlfriends from school left for further studies overseas/ migrated, I was left with only Celine. Granted I made new friends, but it's just not the same. 

Sometimes, it's amazing how something as dull as your phone bill can be an insight into your life."

"event","I'm writing my first post of the year, and I don't know where to start. 

I suppose a round up of 2007 would be fitting. 

But I don't feel like writing about the past, as much as I'm thankful for the many blessings I've received. 

I think, I'll make a wish list for 2008 instead.

I wish to be a better in my job:
- To work more efficiently so that I can go home earlier.
- To write an award-winning radio ad.
- To be more assertive.
- To know when to argue, and when to give in.
- To pay more attention to details.
- To avoid eating late/ eating fast food.

I wish to be a better person:
- To keep in touch with my friends.
- To be more patient when dealing with my parents.
- To divide my time equally for my darling, my family, my friends, work and myself.
- To make myself heard.
- To keep my dreams alive and make them happen.
- To be thankful for what I have.
- To do my part in making life better for someone else.

And to always look on the bright side of life. 

Happy 2008 peeps!"

It was nice seeing old faces again, and I got a company email! My FIRST EVER company email. Hehe. I feel so jakun coz I don't know how to use the Microsoft Entourage mail client (something like outlook) on my mac. 

Jakuness aside, I really want to make the most of this opportunity to build my career in advertising. When I was packing up my things to shift house, I found this essay I wrote back in form 4, when I was 16. The title was ""My Greatest Ambition"". As I read it, I couldn't help but smile at how much I DIDN'T change from that moment when I wrote the essay 6 years ago. One sentence read ""At this point of time, my ambition is to have a successful career in advertising, be it as a graphic designer, copywriter or creative director."" And at the end of the essay, I wrote ""Of course, all the success in the world would mean nothing if I am not happy. Therefore, my GREATEST ambition, is to be happy in whatever I do.""



Oh, to be 16 again..."

"event","After a long break from my LJ, I have finally managed to drag my royal lazy self to post an update. <b><u><br /></u></b>From 7-9 June, the mon family (most of the mons anyway) took a trip to Pulau Perhentian &amp; Redang &amp; Lang Tengah. The bus ride 1 way was 8 hours mind you! It was the first time for me travelling to the East Coast by bus, and using the public toilets there. Let's just say that it was an eye opener to know than half of Malaysia does not have proper public toilets. There was no flush, lack of mirrors and wash basins (nevermind soap), and to top it off, there is a charge of 30cents per ""business trip"". <br /><br />The trip itself was great fun. Lots of snorkelling. A fish bit my thumb when I was feeding bread to the fishes. Lol. Food was decent, rooms were clean and comfy, guides were great....and of course, chillin' out with the mons was priceless. <br /><br />Aha, here's the interesting part about the trip: I LEFT MY HANDPHONE ON THE ISLAND!!<br /><br />And the best part of it was, I didn't even realise it until the room service staff called the boss and told him someone left a Sony Ericsson phone behind. By that time, we had already checked out, had breakfast, and took a 40min boat ride to the jetty. I blame my sesatness to the lack of dependence on the handphone while I was on the island due to the bad mobile coverage. Anyway, back to the story... I had no handphone with me. Sigh. So I asked the boss of <a href=""http://www.faunaholiday.com/"">Fauna Holidays</a> (Mr Ong) who was there to post my handphone to me. <br /><br />I have never felt SO handicapped in my life.<br /><br />When I reached home, I realised that our local post service isn't exactly to be trusted with their infamous open-packages-delivery. So I arranged for DHL to pick up the phone from Mr. Ong, and that would set me back a mere RM32. Wonderful right? Wrong! Just when I thought DHL will be getting it for me, they called Mr Ong to say that they don't service the Kuala Besut area. The nincompoops actually told me they did when I called them earlier. <br /><br />Then, you have to believe this: <b>Mr Ong actually arranged for his friend to bring my handphone to me! </b>Apparently his friend (Mr Cheong) was coming back to KL so he gave my handphone to him, and gave me his number, and asked me to arrange to pick it up from Mr Cheong. <br />I have never felt SO grateful in a LONG LONG time. And of course, lucky. <br /><br />So I went to meet Mr Cheong at Old Klang Road after work today. Thanks to my prince who drove me there. Mr Cheong didn't even ask for anything in return. I then called Mr Ong and told him that since I have already banked in the money for him to pay DHL, he can just use it to treat his very honest staff or keep the money for all the trouble I have caused him. But this kind man actually offered to refund my money! GOSH! Of course I insisted that he treat his staff or something. At least reward the person who found my phone and did not keep it for himself/herself. <br /><br />Seriously, I think I'm lucky to have ""lost"" my handphone in the hands of such wonderful and kind strangers. In these times when people rob, snatch and steal without mercy, such kindness is rare indeed. I am sincerely grateful to the staff of Fauna Holidays for the lovely service while we were there, and the exceptional ""after sales service"" rendered to me. I am not a datuk or any big shot. I'm just a regular holiday guest, and yet, I'm being treated with such care. <br /><br />I will write a letter to The Star newspaper full of praise for this humble man and his honest staff. <br /><br />The next time you want to book a holiday to Perhentian, look no further than <a href=""http://www.faunaholiday.com/"">Fauna Holidays</a>. <br /><br />Just don't leave your handphone behind. <br /><br />"

"event","I received this e-mail, and it made me think. So, I'm sharing it.<br /><br /><font color=""#003366""><b>REMOVE THE MASK</b><br /><br /> A 91-year-old woman died after living a very long dignified life. When she <br /> met God, she asked Him something that had really bothered her for a very <br /> long time. ""If Man was created in God's image, and if all men are created <br /> equal, why do people treat each other so badly?""<br /><br /> God replied that each person who enters our life has a unique lesson to <br /> teach us. It is only through these lessons that we learn about life, people <br /> and our relationships with God.<br /><br /> This confused the woman, so God began to explain ""When someone lies to you, <br /> it teaches you that things are not always what they seem. The truth is often <br /> far beneath the surface. Look beyond the masks people wear if you want to <br /> know what is in their hearts. Remove your own masks to let people know who <br /> you really are.<br /><br /><font size=""4""> When someone steals from you</font> it teaches you that nothing is forever.<br /> Always appreciate what you have. You never know when you might lose it.  <br /> Never take your friends or family for granted, because today and sometimes <br /> only this very moment is the only guarantee you may have.<br /><br /><font size=""4""> When someone inflicts injury upon you</font>, it teaches you that the human state <br /> is a very fragile one. Protect and take care of your body as best as you <br /> can, it's the one thing that you are sure to have forever.<br /><br /><font size=""4""> When someone mocks you</font>, it teaches you that no two people are alike.<br /> When you encounter people who are different from you, do not judge them by <br /> how they look or act, instead base it on the contents of what is in their <br /> hearts.<br /><br /><font size=""4""> When someone breaks your heart</font>, it teaches you that loving someone does not <br /> always mean that the person will love you back. But don't turn your<br /> back on love, because when you find the right person, the joy that one <br /> person brings you will make up for all of your past hurts times a thousand <br /> fold.<br /><br /><font size=""4""> When someone holds a grudge against you</font>, it teaches you that everyone makes <br /> mistakes. When you are wronged, the most virtuous thing you can do is <br /> forgive the offender without pretense. Forgiving those who have hurt us is <br /> often the most difficult and painful of life's experiences, but it is also <br /> the most courageous thing a person can do.<br /><br /><font size=""4""> When a loved one is unfaithful to you,</font> it teaches you that resisting <br /> temptation is Man's greatest challenge. Be vigilant in your resistance <br /> against all temptations. By doing so, you will be rewarded with an enduring <br /> sense of satisfaction far greater than the temporary pleasure by which you <br /> were tempted.<br /><br /><font size=""4""> When someone cheats you</font>, it teaches you that greed is the root of all evil. <br /> Aspire to make your dreams come true, no matter how lofty they may be. Do <br /> not feel guilty about your success, but never let an obsession with <br /> achieving your goals lead you to engage in malevolent activities.<br /><br /><font size=""4""> When someone ridicules you</font>, it teaches you that nobody is perfect.<br /> Accept people for their merits and be tolerant of their flaws. Do not ever <br /> reject someone for imperfections over which they have no control.""<br /><br /> Upon hearing the Lord's wisdom, the old woman became concerned that there <br /> are no lessons to be learned from man's good deeds. God replied that Man's <br /> capacity to love is the greatest gift He has. At the root of kindness and <br /> love, and each act of love also teaches us a lesson.<br /><br /> The woman's curiosity deepened.<br /><br /> God, once again began to explain <font size=""4"">""When someone loves us, it teaches us love, <br /> kindness, charity, honesty, humility, forgiveness, acceptance, and all of <br /> these can counteract all the evil in the world.</font> For every good deed, there is one evil deed. <br />Man alone has the power to control the balance between good and evil, but because the lessons of love <br /> are not taught often enough, the power is too often abused.<br /><br /> When you enter someone's life, whether by plan, chance or coincidence, <br /> consider what your lesson will be. Will you teach love or a harsh lesson of <br /> reality? When you die, will your life have resulted in more loving o r more <br /> hurting? More comfort or more pain? More joy or more sadness?  Each one of <br /> us has the power over the balance of the love in the world.  Use it wisely!""<br /><br /><b> Don't miss an opportunity to nudge the world's scale in the right direction!</b><br /><br /><i><font color=""#808080""> ""And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, <br /> apt to teach, patient, In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; <br /> if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the <br /> truth; And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, <br /> who are taken captive by him at his will."" -2 Timothy 2:24-26</font></i></font>"

"event","There are people who whine about wanting 
There are people who act upon their wants
And there are those who give in to the whiners

There are people who laugh at your funny jokes
There are people who never get them
And there are those who laugh because they are being polite  

There are people who help you solve your problems
There are people who are the cause of&nbsp; your problems
And there are those who do not see any problem

There are people who stand for their convictions 
There are people who have none 
And there are those who switch sides because it is convenient

Some of these people are known as friends
Some, are acquaintances
And some were friends.

I realised, that as we grow older, we become more critical of other people. Maybe because we become more critical of ourselves.

We criticise their work habits
We criticise their personality
We criticise their character; or the lack of it

Somehow, somewhere along the way, we forgot how to be human, and how to be a friend. 

There are all sorts of critics in this world.

Those who criticise movies
Those who criticise fashion
Those who criticise politicians

The world needs less critics, and more friends. 

It is time to learn to love again. It's time to build friendships the old fashioned way. 

- Write a letter
- Go out for coffee
- Watch a movie together
- Pick up the phone, and call
- Know their house phone numbers
- Remember their birthdays, without the help of Friendster
- Know their handwriting
- Buy them things in their favourite colour
- Send them cards during festive seasons

I miss the friends of such friendships. Greatly."

When I realised I couldn't make it in time for submission on Thursday from 2-4pm, I think I nearly lost it. All I could think of was ""shit shit shit shit shit shit shit. die die die die die."" It didn't help that our lecturer threatened to discount 50% off our marks if we submitted late (it was changed to 25%). At 3pm, I was still cutting and mounting a seemingly unending pile of papers on another stack of never ending pile of mounting boards. I began to wonder if I hadn't dedicated enough time to do my work...well..for the past week I haven't surfed or watch any drama...and I was awake for 39 hours straight from wednesday until thursday, with maybe 15mins nap. I don't know.... perhaps I underestimated the time needed for mounting. Doing 3D and AV together was a big mistake. Somehow I think I'd be able to make it if I'd done Web with AV. Lesser boards. anyway, I was pretty upset about it. Still am, but what to do... Here are some photos of the war zone that Lydia &amp; I created in our house:<br /><br /><img width=""320"" height=""240"" alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v260/fruitrophillies/lala/DSC00459.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img width=""320"" height=""240"" alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v260/fruitrophillies/lala/DSC00458.jpg"" /><br /><br />We had 2 spraying stations.

I was trying very very hard to stay awake throughout the priest's sermon, and in the end, I can't remember a single word he said. Sad...<br /><br />On Good Friday, I submitted my sad late work. In the evening, I went to UPM again, this time with my darling coz the CSS left earlier and I overslept. My darling knew I was so so upset and depressed over the late submission, so he showed up at my doorstep with this:<br /><img width=""320"" height=""240"" alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v260/fruitrophillies/lala/DSC00466.jpg"" /><br />It was also to celebrate the day, 3 years ago, when he first asked me to be in a relationship with him. Aww... thanks dear *hugs*<br /><br />For Easter Vigil, my darling and I went for mass at CKK in Subang. Met up with Nat, Xtina and Mike there. Didn't take a pic though. Hehe. After that, we headed to Asia Cafe and makaned til about 1am. <br /><br /><b><u>Qing Ming</u></b><br />On Sunday morning, I went down to Muar with my family to commemorate Qing Ming. Visited my grandfather's grave (dad's dad). It was good. I haven't been back for Qing Ming since....I don't know, primary school I think. Usually only my dad and my sis goes. But this year, our whole family went. I love going back to Muar. :)<br /><br />ANYWAY,<br />There's less than 1 month to the final submission and presentation. I really have to produce something kick ass to salvage my ass from the 25% discount."

The student was aghast...and was reduced to <i>silence in a state of shock</i>. After some thinking, this student decided to look up ""<font color=""#ff0000"">ambient advertising</font>"" in google. After all, if this term is so alien that a seasoned advertising lecturer has never heard of it, it probably doesn't exist. Right?<br /><br />To her utter horror and surprise, there were <font size=""-1""><b>4,630,000 </b>results that came up for ""<font color=""#ff0000"">ambient advertising</font>""<br /><br />There was a company which dedicated itself entirely to its craft right <a href=""http://www.ambientadvertising.com.au/"">here</a><br /><br />There were also articles like <a href=""http://www.stayfreemagazine.org/archives/18/adcreep.html"">this</a> advocating its violation to free and public spaces, saying <b>""</b></font><b>Although it has been around for <font color=""#ff6600"">decades</font>, the category has <font color=""#ff6600"">exploded in          recent years</font>. And this year is expected to be <font color=""#ff6600"">the biggest yet</font>...."". </b>Even graveyards are not spared as seen in this <a href=""http://www.futurefacing.com/Advertising%20gets%20personal.htm"">article</a>.<br /><font size=""-1""><br />There's a short and sweet definition of it<a href=""http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/marketing/advertising_everywhere.cfm""> here.</a><br /><br />Advertising blogs that populate the webspace have no shortage of its news. Check <a href=""http://www.cherryflava.com/cherryflava/2006/11/ambient_adverti.html"">this</a> out...I really like the MINI one :P And <a href=""http://adsoftheworld.com/media/ambient/multiple_sclerosis_australia_coin_operated_scientist"">this</a> is just cool.<br /><br />So, thinking that maybe...just a slight remote chance of a teeny weeny maybe, her lecturer doesn't believe in google as a research tool or detests the ugly interface of google and would probably be unable to find the above mentioned information, she then turned to the categories of well known awards in the advertising world. Who knows there would be no such category and all along this term was from an afterlife or a parallel universe that she had lived in her dreams. <br /><br />First, she looked up the coveted British based D &amp; AD awards. Getting any pencils from the D &amp; AD is like running into Jessica Alba in the pasar malam. That's how difiicult it is. Among the numerous award categories, including 2 categories dedicated to the craft of copywriting (not very common) there it was staring at her face <a href=""http://www.dandad.org/awards2006/"">""Environment Design"" and <font color=""#ff0000"">""Ambient"" </font></a><br /><br />Knowing that the British have a weird sense of humour and decidingly different culture from the big ol' US of A, she hunted down the New York Festival. Aha! No such category there. <br /><br />She then proceeding to check out the CLIO AWARDS. And it is known as <b>Innovative Media. </b>Quite close to our major of Media Innovation too! THE ONE SHOW had a category called ""<font color=""#99cc00"">Environment Design</font>"" which is exactly the name of one of our FYP categories. Amazing stuff....<br /><br />Lastly, she checked the mother of all awards...the Cannes Lion Awards. From Bangkok to Budapest to London to Tokyo, ad people from all over the world gather once a year (usually in June) to criticise and admire ads. For Cannes, there were 2 categories catered for <font color=""#ff0000"">Ambient Advertising</font>. They were: <br /><br /></font><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">B06. Best use of ambient media:</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: bold;""> Small scale</span> (e.g. bars &amp; restaurants (incl. washrooms, glasses, beer mats &amp; ashtrays), petrol pumps, flyers, stickers, signage)</p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">B07. Best use of ambient media: Large scale</span> ( including supersize sites, <font color=""#339966""><b>3D and non standard shaped sites</b></font>, ticket barriers, floor media and other adaptations of exterior locations, signage, buildings or street furniture)</p><font size=""-1"">The latter category would be the one that relates to the lecture of that day. Esp </font><font color=""#339966""><b>3D and non standard shaped sites.<br /><br /></b><font color=""#000000"">Feeling somewhat overwhelmed, traumatised and disillusional about the ignorance of her lecturer about current advertising practises, she retired to do her FYP, reduced to </font></font><i>silence in a state of shock</i>.... again. <font size=""-1""><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></font>"

"event","Woohoo.... CNY week break is ending in 24 hours or so, and I will be back in Cyber finishing up my sad sketches. <br /><br />Anyway, here are some pics to document my CNY journey:<br /><br />We went to church on the first day of CNY, it was also a Sunday. So we took the customary family photo that we take every year:<br /><img border=""1"" alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v260/fruitrophillies/CNY/cny_church.jpg"" /><br /><br />Me and my godmother:<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v260/fruitrophillies/CNY/cny_church2.jpg"" /><br /><br />My cousin wanted to meet her NS friend in Midvalley, so we took the KTM there. Its been awhile since I took the KTM. Hehe. She's gonna be studying in HELP in March so I'll be seeing more of her. And yea...she is younger than me but taller than me.<br /><img border=""1"" alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v260/fruitrophillies/CNY/cny_ktm2.jpg"" /><br /><br />My brother working as the part time station master at Sentul station. LOL. I have more pics of him doing weird things, but for the sake of his dignity, I shall not upload them here. :P<br /><img border=""1"" alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v260/fruitrophillies/CNY/cny_ktm.jpg"" /><br /><br />We made a trip to the Dong Zen Temple in Jenjarom.

I miss this place...such a nice old charming feeling it has:<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v260/fruitrophillies/CNY/cny_muar3.jpg"" /><br /><br />We ate a lot of traditional kopitiam stuff at a fraction of OLD TOWN's price. Freshly baked bread, homemade kaya, awesomely brewed coffee, tea and kampung hardboiled eggs...lots of traditional kuihs...7 of us ate and the bill was less than RM20. Told you it was damn cheap!<br /><img border=""1"" alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v260/fruitrophillies/CNY/cny_muar2.jpg"" /><br /><br />Went to the temple to pay respects to my grandpa. His ashes are there. I haven't been coming back for Qing Ming since I started MMU. Sad to say that...but yea, I will try to make a trip back for this year's Qing Ming.<br /><img border=""1"" alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v260/fruitrophillies/CNY/cny_muar.jpg"" /><br /><br />Visited the monkeys by the seaside.

And that's my lovely grandma!<br /><img border=""1"" alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v260/fruitrophillies/CNY/cny_meaning.jpg"" /><br /><br />And...I met up with my primary school mates...some of them whom I havent seen since we parted ways in primary school....that's 10 years! It's been a long time since I had a conversation in mandarin...the longest ever record ok... there were about 12 of us, we talked for 7 hours! Crazyness... And belive it or not, with all the canggih camera phones around, none of us thought of taking a photo for rememberance. So I went to everyone's friendster page and made a montage-of-some-sort. I hope it will not be another 10 years til we meet again! I missed you guys!<br /><img border=""1"" alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v260/fruitrophillies/CNY/MONTAGE.jpg"" /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","Anyway, I just got back from another crap MI class. All I have to say is....I can't believe I took a loan of thousands of ringgit and bonded myself to work for the government for 4-5 years, and spent few more thousands ringgit for this kind of so-called education. <br /><br />But I shall not waste more time than I have wasted at class today by complaining about it here. Instead, I shall blog about Valentine's Day! Like it or not... it's everywhere...Even LJ celebrates Valentine's with some pink!<br /><br />On Sunday, my prince &amp; I sorta celebrated Valentine's already because we didn't want to join the love crowd on Feb 14 itself. We went to 1 Utama, had Gengki Sushi, shopped for CNY, watched 'Iberia' and had Claypot Lou Shi Fun at TTDI. <br /><br />Then I gave him his Vday present:<br /><img border=""1"" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v260/fruitrophillies/lala/card.jpg"" alt="""" /><br />Made it lotsa lotsa lurrrrveeeee... with a little help from Nat.. haha. Nice nice?? We just hung out after dinner at his place in USJ and tengok downloaded Prison Break and One Tree Hill. <br /><br />On Feb 14 itself, campus was somehow full of people wearing the love colours of red and pink... Some people were buying flowers, and some were getting flowers. Even the guards wished the students Happy Valentines and Happy CNY... Love is definitely in the air! Well, I went to classes as usual... then I came home to find my prince waiting for me!<br /><br />He prepared an awesome 5 course menu for Vday lunch/dinner. We had Salmon Fettucini (no instant sauce Prego sauce used ok...), Grilled Dory, Potato Salad, Chocolate-Banana-Grape shake and choco ice cream! While he was preparing the meal, I was not allowed to step into the kitchen at all! Each time I approach the kitchen, he says ""go awayyyyy"". So loving horrr?<br /><br />The Amazing Salmon Fattucini:<br /><img border=""1"" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v260/fruitrophillies/lala/pasta.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br />Lovely Pan Grilled Dory with a&nbsp; slice of lemon of course:<br /><img border=""1"" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v260/fruitrophillies/lala/dory.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br />Scrumpilicious Signature dish of Potato Salad:<br /><img border=""1"" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v260/fruitrophillies/lala/potato_salad.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br />And he brought his blender here to make the Chocolate banana grape shake!<br /><img border=""1"" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v260/fruitrophillies/lala/shake.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br />After eating all that...wahhh...had to go walk around Cyberia to digest the food. We walked walked and saw the sunset, and came back to the house to watch more Prison Break and One Tree Hill. Then we danced in the hall coz my housemates we not around anyway. :P Ahh..so nice! *sees hearts floating everywhere* Then he went home and left behind a very happy, satisfied, loved, stuffed Joanne. <br /><br />Thanks dear for such a wonderful day! The food, the effort, everything! It's worth more than any expensive buffet meal in posh restaurants/hotels...even every girl's best friend (diamonds) loses out to this! I certainly enjoyed every moment of it with you. MUAX!&nbsp; MUAX! <br /><br /><img border=""1"" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v260/fruitrophillies/lala/froggyville.jpg"" alt="""" /><br />"

"event","This is the final trimester:<br /><img width=""640"" height=""511"" src=""http://www.parnasse.com/battle.jpg"" alt="""" /><br />Ok lah...not really like that la...<br /><br />Today - The first class was on Economics. What would a Creative Multimedia student do with the Law of Demand and Supply? Anyway, I arrived in class slightly late and Miss Poon was already at slide 6 of slide 93 when I sat down. After a rather miserable 2 hour effort made to understand the slides' contents and ignoring my rumbling tummy, it was finally time for lunch. If there's anything I'd miss about my uni days, it will definitely NOT be the food. <br /><br />For the last week of my holidays, I watched Project Runway 3 and went to Ipoh with Ian to celebrate his dad's birthday. Mian, I wish I grew up in somewhere other than KL. KL is always so busy, so congested, so stressful that there's no feeling of ""home"" to it. In Ipoh, you can go to the mall at 5pm without worrying about getting stuck in the jam. You can drive into town for dim sum, tau fu fa and white coffee on a saturday afternoon and still get parking. You can go to church, drive to the other end of town for dinner and come home in time to watch your favourtie TV show. You can also leave your house gate unlatched and wide open. And instead of buildings and more buildings, when you look out, you are greeted by the sights of limestone hills and greenery around you... There may be less choice in terms of shopping and entertainment, but for the quality of life and cost of living, I really would rather stay anywhere but KL. <br /><br />Caryn and Joanna will be flying off to Aus in 9 days. Not looking fwd to that day at all."

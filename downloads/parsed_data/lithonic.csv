Your g/f, your friends, respect from people you know, close ties with family, your job, your life.....All these things are a part of you that you will loose if you dont shape up.  This is it, the end.  Its all gotta stop, otherwise you'll fall into a hole that you cant get out of.  Hell, your feeling it already, the urge, the rush, the desire for more.  But you cant let this control you!  You got to come through, grasp reality before it smacks you down.  I know I can do it, its going to take alot of strength, but you will come through.  You have before, you can do it again.  The one biggest thing you should realise is how much your hurting the ones you love, most of all, your only love.  You've lost such beauty in the past because of stupid choices, dont loose this one.  What you have, many people never find, and to loose it, well, that would be fucking stupid.  God, thats the last thing I want to have happen, to loose that love.  Fuck, nothing else comes close, nor will it ever.  Stick with the program Tim, you will win!!!"

"event","Wow, the ""Scream"" painting was stolen just recently from Norway by armed robbers.  I found that to be quite interesting.  Not because of the actual event, but it brought something to mind when I saw a picture of the painting I've seen so many times.  Something in the article quoted that through the years people have been trying to understand the meaning behind the painting.  Well, as with many forms of art, this one ment something special to me, uniquely to me.  It reminds me, that like this freaked out character in the painting, I am standing on a bridge screaming my head off.  This is a bridge thats taking me somewhere, where, I'll know only once I've crossed it, but its going somewhere.  The reason Im screaming, well, its kinda ironic.  I guess, like the painting, I witness two lovers, a man and a woman, crossing this bridge without a care, facing towards the end.  I stand, looking back at where I begun, and I am screaming.  Why?  Maybe because there isnt something I am understanding.  Maybe its because Im crossing this bridge and I am afraid of doing it, because its unknown.  Whatever the reason, Im screaming, but I wont be for too long.  A choice has got to be made, cause I cant stand eternally like this character screaming my face off and not doing anything about it.  I guess thats what makes the painting so amusing.  This fucker is going to be screaming as long as the painting exists.  Me, fuck that, I wont.  I guess I got to understand of why I am doing such.  I think its kinda simple.  Its either something within me, or its got to be the bridge Im crossing.  I gotta figure it out, cause honestly, it sucks screaming.  I know the bridge will be crossed, the fright flown to flight, and another step traveled.  Maybe its time to suck it up, stop being such a fucking pussy, and keep walking.  Everything has a purpose, and thats nothing worth fearing.  Wow, amazing what you can gather from looking at a simple painting.  Fuck, Munch, your art really ment more than the oil and brush which created it....."

"event","Well, I thoroughly enjoyed my quick vacation to Chincoteague Island, it was the best stress releaver one could ask for.  There I found some really really dark secrets about this quiet little fishing town.  Turns out there is a large number of people who do coke there, and I loved hearing the hot story of the week on how the DEA busted about 25 people on the island involved in a coke ring.  When I asked them about the story, most natives asked ""are you a cop?!"".  This just made the whole stay more interesting.  I should have played it off more, but that could have got dodgy.  Anyhow, I came back, and met up with Tasha.  Man, I missed her quite a bit while I was gone.  Anyhow we had a great evening hanging out and then we fell asleep together.  I love sleeping with her, and I rest better than I could ever ask for.  Im kinda worried though, cause I think I might have pissed her off this afternoon, only because I hung out with some people she really didnt want me to hang out with.  That and the other day I promised I'd take her out to the movies on her break in between jobs.  Well, instead I ran off with friends and left her at home, where she just slept.  Thats really fucked up if you think about it, and I can understand why she kinda blew me off when I visited her at work.  She didnt seem really that happy to see me.  I hope I havent ruined anything.  Thats the last thing I wanted to do.  God, I guess Im thinking too much.  Maybe I should pop down to the coffee shop and chill out.  Yea, thats a good idea!"

I guess Im just really anxious to see Tasha again, and be over with my workweek.  Working 12 hour night shifts, well, its easy, but annoying.  But all in all, I just miss Tasha, alot.  She is coming in at 8am tomorrow morning and she asked if I could pick her up.  I gladly accepted, and now, shit, I wish it was 8am.  She called last night during my shift, and we sat and talked for a good 30 minutes or so, and during the course of our convo, I asked if she wanted to see eachother again.  She hesitated and said she didnt know, and when I asked why, she said she was scared, hesistated again, and told me she'd talk when we get back.  I hope its nothing too serious, and I hope there is a possability of us again.  I think its just because she is afraid I'd hurt her again, and Im sure Rosanne told her somethings, and thats what she's going by.  Whatever it is, I'll find out in a few hours.  The most important thing is, I get to see her again, its been too long.  Come on 8am!"

"event","Great, I've really fucked up.  Big time.  Tasha called me about 45 minutes ago, and we talked for a while about all types of stuff.  Her trip, when she's getting back, etc.  Towards the end of the convo, I asked her about her emergancy room visit.  Through the convo, I broke down crying, only because I was sad of what happened, really really sad.  I also let out some things that I had done over the last few days.  I had done drugs, got too drunk, put a revolver to my head, and pretty much really did some stupid stupid shit over the last few days.  Some of it, has to do with Tasha and I, but alot of it is stuff thats going on.  Im letting the stress get to me, and I should be stronger than that.  But, by telling her all of this stuff, including a situation where I kissed a friend of mine, she got really quiet.  I know she is really pissed of, hurt, and disappointed in me.  Damnit, why did I have to say that shit!  I guess I just wanted to be honest with her, but seeing as how she's been so excited to see me, thinking about me all the time on her trip, and having a good time, I feel like I kinda have fucked that up now.  I asked her to call me back later tonight, and she said she didnt know if she was going to.  Hell, I wouldnt be suprised if she didnt even want to see me when she gets back.  I hope to god she didnt think I was with anyone, cause I wasnt.  It was that one stupid kiss, thats all.  God, why am I such a fuck up sometimes.  I just want to have things right for a change.  Everything has seemed so upside down, and now that i've hurt the one I care about the most, whats next?  Tasha, please, if you are reading this, I hope you understand I feel badly about this stuff, and I just want the best for you and I.  I hope I havent betrayed you in any way, and honestly I hope you dont do anything to get me back, or refuse to talk to me.  I love you, I love you, damnit, I love you so much.  Please, please dont hate me for what I did.....I dont want to loose you......"

Maybe its just my body getting used to sleeping during the day, and being awake by night, but I think its something else.  I miss Tasha alot, and I havent heard from her yet today.  She usually calls, but she hasnt yet.  Im sure she is busy, but she was calling alot in the beginning.  Maybe she got annoyed that I never picked up my phone, maybe she doesnt care to call right now.  Whatever it is, I just want to hear her voice.  Even if its just for 1 second.  Im feeling so empty right now, and the weather outside doesnt help anything at the least.  Its all rainy and gloomy, and it just further worsens depression.  I know I'll feel better, but when.  I hate feeling like this.  I dont even want to go to work today, or do anything.  I just want to ball up in the corner, get fucked up, and pass out for a few.  I feel like I have no modivation for anything.  Romeo called me about an hour ago and asked if I wanted to hang out.  Usually I'd be like ""Hell yea lets go"", but I bluntly said no, and hung up.  I sometimes feel like a pane of glass, and people know Im there, but see right through me.  Whatever, Im just wallowing in self misery.  Enough of this bullshit.  I should go to work, enjoy it for what its worth, and come home and get some sleep.  Until later....."

"event","Not too bad, that is my first day, er, night on the job.  I switched to a nightshift position last night and worked such a hard hard 12 hours.  LOL, actually, I mainly sat back, talked with coworkers, and watched the hours drift by.  The only thing that sucked was when some of the morning crew came in.  I notice that them and I still have our little differences from the last time I worked there, and we dont really talk all that much anymore.  It doesnt bother me at the least, but still, the people on that shift, well, are just stuck up.  While on the shift, Tasha called me on my cell, and since I left it out in my car, I missed it :(.  I got her message and she said she'd call back later, but she never did.  I had my phone on me whenever I could, but no call.  Hmm, probably out hanging with family or KC.  I really want to talk to her again, as its been at least since saturday since we last talked.  Instead we keep in touch through email and our livejournal entries.  Im going to go ahead and hit the sack now, rest up for tonights shift.  Hopefully I'll wake up to hear the sweetest voice ones ear could ever listen upon, Tashie :)"

"event","Man, I feel like shit today.  I really shouldnt have done the things I did last night.  I did it mainly for the experiance, but man, Im paying for it as of now.  Not only that, but I got 12 hours of work ahead of me.  Luckily its only a nightshift, and I can read, draw, write poetry and other things that I cant during the day.  I'll be nice working nights, gives me a chance to mellow out some, and hopefully I wont get too bored with it.  So, I got up today around 12, and hung around the house a bit till I popped over to JJ's.  There I met up with Jonathan, and we both sat down, burnt out and tired, and talked about the previous night.  I told him how I went out to the clubs and how he smoked himself stupid and then crashed.  While hanging out at JJ's, Romeo, this dude I met over at Mcdonalds, calls me up and asks for a ride.  Turns out he had a hook up with some MDMA and he wanted to hook me up if I took him to where he wanted to go.  Of course, learning the harsh lession from the previous night, and not really wanting to get mixed up in stuff, I turned him down.  I did take Jonathan over to his apartment so he could smoke with him.  Then, I drove back home.  Not a really interesting day, but fuck, its only Sunday.  I really was hoping Tasha would call me today, but Im sure she's having fun hanging out with KC and family today, and she will call sometime later.  I've noticed something different in the way she writes, in her emails, and on her livejournal.  She also sounds alot different on the phone, all of course in a very good way.  I dont know if it is or isnt, but she seems to be realising alot of things, and honestly, thats a big turn on for me.  She seems to be very confident, determained, and willing to do what it takes.  Thats far more sexy than the hottest supermodel standing nude right in front of me.  I also feel for her in ways that I couldnt with others.  I do truely love her, and I love her more than anything on this world.  No matter what I do, where I go, what I say, she is always on the top of my mind, and deep within my heart.  Damn I love her so!"

"event","Woah, tonight came and went pretty damn quick.  Alot has gone on in the last few hours, both physically and mentally.  Today started off with me running to Ashburn to pick up my paycheck.  There my sister and I decided to pop over to starbucks, to get some coffee.  There we sat back, talked the shit about stuff going on in the family, and things in general.  God, I love my sister, I get along with her so well.  I wish I had that same bond with my brother, but we are off in alot of ways.  Maybe the future will be more promising.  Anyhow, after a while, I packed up some stuff from my dads, and rolled on out with cash in pocket(its always kick ass to get a paycheck).  I dropped by this one place, had my car completely cleaned out, and then rolled over to JJs.  There I met up with Jonathan, and him and I went around Springfield to meet up with a friend of his.  We chat for a good 10 minutes, and then rolled back to JJ's.  Along the way we had some encounters with Oxy and Yale, and when we arrived, we where feelin good.  Of course everyone there noticed our state of mind, and alot of people looked upon me with discust.  I dont blame them, I feel pretty bad myself for doing it, but it allowed me to gain a better understanding of all that was going on.  Anyhow, within about 40 min of getting there, Umbra invites me out to Midnight, this Gothic club in DC.  I take the metro, hella fucked up at that point, to where i met up with him.  We rolled back to his house, and the fucker took 1 hour to get ready.  I shouldnt have been so impatient with him, but I was anxious to check this place out.  Well, we finally get down to the club around 1, and I meet up with some old friends of mine that go to Alchemy, some I hadnt seen in a while.  We catch up on old times, and then soon after that, I had to catch the metro before it shut down.  I get there in time to catch the last train home, and strike up an interesting convo with this girl Caroline.  We start talking about politics, the area, jobs, etc.  We both would pause and laugh at her friend Jessa, who was passed out from a night in Georgetown.  When we hit there stop, I help her get Jessa out and wish her a relaxing evening.  When I got back to my stop, I had an interesting convo with a bum, and nicely enough, I gave him a dollar(what he does with it, one can only guess).  On the ride back, I could stop thinking about Tasha.  Hell, I thought about her the entire night.  I really wanted to hear from her, but I think I really pissed her off, at least I hope I didnt.  I hope she is enjoying her trip, and man, I cant wait till she gets back.  I want to do something special for her when she does get back, what, well thats my little secret ;0).  Anyhow, maybe I should get to crashing right now, as I gotta work 12 hours tomorrow night at my job.  Better rest up.  Night.

PS-Tasha, if your reading this, I just want to say I hope your sleeping well, having fun, and remember, I love you :)"

I shouldnt have done it last night.  I did it, well, mainly because I ran out of money for beer and I had a few to pop.  It didnt really do too much in the terms of fucking me up, but it made me feel really really wierd, kinda like the first time before.  So now I deal with the conciquences of my actions, dubbed to be miserable for a day.  Last night was alot of fun, but it didnt really amount to anything special.  I got off work at 6, after working the worst 12 hour shift of my entire life, to meet up with Melissa at JJ's.  We sat down and talked about some plans quickly, before I had to get up and leave to go home for dinner.  I returned back 30 minutes later to find Jessica arrived after I did.  I got off the phone with Umbra after he called me about getting together that night, and walked over with Jessica to chill with Melissa.  We hop up and decide it would be a good idea to go drink over at Outback.  So, we roll on over to there and kicked back, enjoying some interesting convo's and drinks.  Not long after we leave again, and go back to JJ's where I had to take Melissa's sister home.  After that, Melissa and I decided it was a good idea to go over to TT Reynolds and have some more drinks.  In the process of chillin at both TT Reynolds and Neds Downunder, I tried to get rid of some of the Lithium that I had, but no one was interested.  To many of them where yuppy fuckers.  Anyhow I roll in the bathroom, pop two, and go back out.  It kicked in soon enough, and Melissa and I rolled on out, to go meet Umbra.  We met up with him at Kinko's, talked about tonight, and then bounced.  I took her home, dropped her off, and then got home to crash.  I was able to lay down and get comfortable, but one thing still spins around in my head, Tasha.  She called last night, and I missed the call, but she left a message.  On it she said she really needs to talk to me.  About what, I can only imagine, but I know one thing at this moment in time....I miss her alot."

"event","tonight, well, was very uneventful.  I hung out with Jonathan and Jessica, and dropped by Melissa's for about a minute, to pick up the poetry she typed up for me.  Its nice having an actual printed copy of my work, as opposed to the scrap paper I usually have it on.  Besides that, I felt really really low today.  I havent felt this way, well, in a while.  I feel something is really missing inside of me, and I really really really feel lonely.  As much as I surround myself with others, the more I cant stand them.  Yes, maybe this is a case of bad depression, but I can cope with that fairly easily.  This is definately something more.  I think about Tasha alot too, and really beat myself mentally because of all the wrongs that went on, both on her side and mine.  I'd love to get back with her, but my trust isnt fully there.  I still think about other shit she might have done while she was with me, stuff she doesnt want to bring up.  Again, Im most likely wrong here, but still it nags at me.  It nags at me too, that I just tossed her to the side.  That was just so wrong, despite the things she did to me.  Maybe, and I hope sometime soon, these differences will disappear and maybe things will be good again.  I mean we are friends and all, but damn, I think about her all the time.  I know things could work out again, but the lying, deceiving, verbal abuse, snooping, possesiveness, clingyness, misconceptions, paranoia, and impulsiveness all has to stop, on both our accounts.  Those are all major things, and they all take time to work around, but damnit if I wouldnt do anything it took.  Maybe I hold back for fear of getting hurt, but does anything else hurt as bad as it does now.  I have trouble eating, sleeping sometimes, and getting by day to day, because of what I did, what she did, how things came crashing down, and how they are now.  Damn, damn, damn, I wish there was a simple answer to all of this, god I would do anything.  Everyone says its for the best, and to move on, but thats the thing, I cant.  I hope she is thinking the same thing right now, and I hope that things might become again, but alot of things need to be worked out before that could happen.  Damn, I sure do miss you Tasha, alot..."

I get a call this morning at 530 with one of the Lieutenants telling me Im supposed to be there by now, arming up for the day.  I told him that I didnt need to be there cause I had the day off.  He told me bluntly, no, I was supposed to be there.  So I had to in less than 7 minutes to get out the door and on my way to work.  Luckily I didnt get there too late and I popped over to the same stupid post I had yesterday, and, for a kicker, I only spent 4 hours working before they releaved me.  So here I sit, tired as shit, annoyed as shit, wondering what the fuck Im going to do, cause this job isnt going to cut it for much longer.  Besides this terrible morning I've been dealing with, I actually managed to sleep alright last night.  I was woken up around 2 when Tasha called me back.  Turns out she is using someones cell phone that lives in Bellingham, her home town, who happens to be at the wedding.  So that put my suspicions aside, not that they where really all that great of a question in my head.  She seems to be having fun, and she told me about this really sexy outfit that she got, and I cant wait to see it on her.  I told her to have a great time today with the wedding and to call me back when she gets a chance.  Anyhow I guess Im going to get some sleep before I go out today, to do what, I dont know yet.

There I introduced her to some of my friends and we sat down with some coffee and talked for a while, mainly about me going to visit her when she goes back to school.  Not too long after we got up there, Jessica and Melissa both showed up.  Jessica told me this crazy story about how she almost died the other day in a car wreck, and luckily, both her and her vehicle went pretty much unscathed.  The only noticable thing is this dent in her hood, but then again she has a 95 taurus, and the damn thing looks like its been hit by a fucking hale storm.  Anyhow after finding out that Jessica was alright, we all sat back and shot the bull for a while, and then Melissa and I headed back over to her house to watch Dreamcatcher.  We got bored after like 5 minutes and hopped over to the Outback for a few rounds of beer.  There I found out her crazy life dealing with meth, coke, and being a stripper, and how one day she was just like, fuck it, Im done.  Its really interesting how someone can find the strength to do such a thing, and it must take a shitload of willpower to get away from that stuff.  Tasha has done the same, and just listening to her stories mimic that of what Tasha went through.  They really need to meet sometime, Im sure they'll have a blast.  Anyhow we got done with our beers and popped back to her house to read poetry.  I managed to grab a few ones she wrote, and its pretty good stuff.  I shared my stuff and she insisted to type it up, so I let her have it for the meantime.  Not soon after we got there, I had to go, since it was getting late and she had to leave.  After hanging out with Melissa, I popped back over to JJ's for a smoke, and then I found myself home again.  A simple, but enjoyable evening, just what I needed after 12 hours of hell.  I havent heard back from Tasha yet, and I dont know if she'll call.  I kinda pissed her off when I called the number back that she said not to call back, but then again, I dont understand why its cool for her to call me on the phone, but I cant call back.  It just doesnt make sense.  Oh well, Im going to stop dwelling on it and hit the sack.  Lata!"

The only thing that made the day go by was talking to my pretty much anti social coworker and some of the people that worked there.  I managed to kill off a good 2 hours talking to Kelly, one of the interns at the post they placed me at.  She went on for a good hour or so about how her and her fiance are getting married soon.  It was alot of fun talking about it with her, and sharing my similar situation.  We both wished eachother the best of luck and the long and seemingly endless boring day continued.  I got back home after battling traffic to find nothing but smiles back at my grandmothers house, which did the opposite of what they hoped it would do.  I got pissed off, went upstairs, and checked my phone calls.  I got a message from Tasha, and as soon as I heard her voice, I hit redial.  It rang and rang, and it ended up being some wierd female voice on the other end.  I assume its someone at the wedding and she'll call back later, but the number I got, wasnt a CA number, it was from WA.  So now Im thinking, okay, whats going on.  Maybe its none of my damn business and maybe its someones cell, but why a WA number?  Oh well, I'll find out later Im sure.  Anyhow Im going to grab some dessert here, pop down to JJ's and see if Melissa, Jessica, or Jesse wants to do anything tonight.  If not, maybe its best to call it quits early so I can rest, since I havent got alot of sleep lately.  Oh well, write back soon! ;)"

"event","Okay, wtf!!  Tonight would have been a little more chill if this didnt happen.  Ok, where to start.  I was sitting in front of JJ's, talking to everyone I know there, and then my friend Jess popped up, this girl from germany who came to visit.  She comes up, gives me a friendly hug, and appologises for not being up there earlier.  I laugh and say its cool, and we sit down to talk.  Well, about 2 min into our convo, this girl Carrine pops up to talk as well.  She butts into our convo and asks, ""Did you just meet Tim?"".  She nods, and we go about talking and then she slides in a sarcastic joke, and then quickly shuts up.  She laughs to herself and then says ""I was just kidding, well not really, but I was"".  I look at her like, ok, wtf are you talking about.  I then ask if anyone wanted anything to drink from inside and they all say no, and as soon as I come back out, Jess is sitting with her friends, giving me a wierd look.  I thought to myself, ok, thats strange and proceeded to go talk to another friend of mine sitting down by himself.  I get bored, and decide its time to go home.  I give everyone hugs as I always do before I leave, and wish Raffe, one of the german girls a safe trip home, and then as I start walking up to Jess to say bye, she just waves her hand, and bluntly says, later.  I stand there for a sec and then she looks at me again, and just waves her hand at me in a sarcastic manner.  Of course, Carrine is sitting right next to her, and since I found out that Carrine has been talking alot of shit about me to others, I figured just that.  What is her fucking problem.  Am I such a bad person to the point where she thinks I shouldnt have friends up there?!  What the fuck is she saying about me.  I really hate people like that, that are sooooo stuck in their own self misery that they have to throw it on others.  Fuck her and her stupid shit filled mouth.....grrrr.  Anyhow besides that shit, the night went alright.  I met someone new today, ironically someone who just got back from Vegas too.  Her name is Melissa and she has just recently started pulling herself out of a bad addiction to coke and meth.  She is also trying to get a decent job now, since she used to be a stripper in Vegas and DC.  When I asked why she decided to do that, she said that one day she looked in the mirror, and didnt even recognise herself.  Everything she said, sounded very similar to what Tasha had gone through, in some aspects.  I really want to introduce Tasha to her, as Im sure they could share a wealth of stories about addiction.  Also, she seems like she needs more friends, because the only ones she had were there only when drugs where, and so she never has had any true friends.  Im sure we'll hang out sometime this week, and probably go down to DC or something to check out Georgetown.  Anyways, that was my evening in a nutshell.  I really hope Tasha is having a blast, and I do miss her, alot.  I wish she had called today, but Im sure she is having alot of fun with family/friends.  I just hope they dont beat stuff into her head about me, and if she does tell them about whats going on with us, they dont flip.  The last thing I want is to have Tasha come back, completely different, and full of negative energy.  But Im sure she'll come back with a smile on her face, and tell me all the cool stuff she did.  Well, time to hit the sack, night"

"event","Well today started my going back to my old job, at the security company I left only about 2 months ago.  I was suprised to find everyone quite friendly with me, asking me all about what went wrong with Vegas.  I dont know how many times I got the ""I told you!"" from people, but ah well, maybe I should have listened to them to begin with.  After work I hopped over to JJ's to sit back for a few before heading back home for a pretty kick ass meal.  Now I sit here thinking of what to do next.  I work 12 hours tomorrow but when I get off, I have thursday off, so I might go out and party with some friends.  Tasha left today as well, and I really hope she has a fun time in CA.  I just hope she doesnt get into some stuff out there, because of a certain situation going on.  What, I'll mention later.  We slept together last night, which was sooooo much fun, and I have been thinking about a great deal of things lately.  Some stuff really still nags at me, but I push it away believing its all paranoia, and I trust her word.  She knows that if she breaks it again, there wont ever be even a word said to her by I ever again.  I can stand being lied to once, but again, hell fucking no.  But again, I trust her word, and until otherwise, I trust her.  The past is always shakey, and sometimes not fair, but still, things can come around.  Anyhow, time to get back down to the coffee shop and hang out.  Lata!"

"event","Talk talk talk, thats all Vinh ever does.  I mean he's cool and all, and I understand he doesnt know many people, but damn, that guy must repeat the same subject 10 times over, and still want to talk about it.  Anyhow, tonight was alot of fun.  I met up with Vinh over at TT Reynolds and we listened to some live music and popped a beer or two, but we didnt stay long.  We decided to hit up this new club down the street that just opened up a few months ago.  I was expecting a really yuppy rich snob stop but it was nothing like that.  This place was pretty chill.  We walked in and the dance floor was hot.  We kicked back for a while and I tried to boost Vinh's convidence to go talk to some of the females that where there.  Well, he was holding back, so I decided to give him an example.  Of course as soon as I start talking to this girl, this guy comes up behind me, and politely says, ""Hey, me and my friends where here first"".  So, I shook his hand, apologised, and sat back down.  The night was looking quite dull at that moment until Vinh decided to talk to 3 ladies at the bar.  They had come all the way from Warrenton to party, because Dana, one of the girls, was having her 23 birthday.  We all sat back and talked about random shit, and then we watched as Vinh tried hitting on Alexi, one of the girls at the bar.  He tried his best, but damn, he doesnt know when to lay off.  Luckily Alexi was cool and didnt get too freaked out, but damn, Vinh needs to cool his drive a little.  Dana then at that point asked kindly for a B-day dance on the floor, so despite her not really being my type, I hopped on the floor with her for some grinding.  She loved every minute of it, while I put a half ass effort into it, but insured she had fun.  After a few songs, we popped back to the bar to bullshit for a few, and then last call was shouted out.  Before me and Vinh left, Dana asked for a B-day kiss, and again, dispite her really not being my type, I kindly gave her a quick kiss.  All in all the night was fun, and I think it was a big stress break.  Some things still linger in my head though, as you know, about Tasha.  We spent alot of this afternoon watching movies and having sex, and trying to determain where we are.  Of course, things did a 180 when I was told some stuff at JJ's, and it kinda made sense.  I might be letting others think for me, but not really, since most people are saying the same damn thing, and when you have so many people saying exactly that, its hard to tune it out.  So anyways, I talked to Tasha about it, and how I think we should be more on the straight friends level, and she didnt take that very well.  Its hard to loose her, and to realise that there will most likely never be another us again, but in the same sense, maybe its for the better.  Alot has been learned, and yes, there is still alot left to be learned.  Overall, I hope that no matter where our paths go, Tasha and I find our place in the stars, in our way.  Well, enough typing, these fingers are numb :-P.  Night"

"event","What an amazing night!  I got off work tonight with my coworked Vinh, and we both headed over to JJ.  There I caught up with friends and introduced my coworker to them.  It was a good experiance for him, since he didnt know many people in the area.  Anyhow, I jumped home to take my insulin shot and change clothes, since I was still in my uniform from work.  Anyhow I popped back to JJ's wearing a crazy outfit, and found out quickly that no one really liked it, so I jumped home.  Before I left, Tasha and I chatted really quickly and then I was off.  I came back wearing a better outfit and my group of friends and I headed back to the Hookha bar, where we chilled for a while enjoying Shisha and Turkish coffee.  After about an hour or so, Tasha, Vinh, Jonathan and I hopped over to TGI Fridays for a few rounds.  There I had some liquid cocaine and then felt the blast from the Back Draft drink I had.  Also while there, I talked more to Tasha about us.  We shouted out our opinions and I felt personally we got a better understanding.  After our crazy drinking escapades, we drove over to JJ's which at this moment was closed, and bullshitted for a while.  Tasha wanted to smoke some stuff, but I kept telling her it wasnt such a good idea, because of a medical condition she found out about herself recently.  She did it anyhow, with both Vinh and Jonathan, while I sat back and watched.  They all got hella fucked up and we stumbled back to the front of the store.  We left only 5 minutes later and Vinh took me back home, after he dropped of Jonathan.  There, home that is, I wanted to talk to Tasha more, but she wanted to go.  So both her and my coworker left, while I stumbled up the stairs.  There I found my Nanny chillin by the comp and she gave me a long lecture about alcohol.  I felt it was pointless, but I listened anyhow.  After her rant, I hopped on the comp to update what your reading now.  Anyhow, I guess I gotta rest, only because I got like 5 hours sleep max last night, and I need to get some stuff done tomorrow.  Well, goodnight fellow LJ creepers, see ya tomorrow."

Im gonna take some friends with me, already found one who might want to go down with me.  I woke up today when Tasha called, and she said she wasnt going to meet me at JJ and she would see me later.  She almost sounded stoned on the phone, but I guess she was just tired.  Anyhow I went down there for about an hour or so and I came to the realization that unless things become different, Im going to continue torchering myself.  Hell I could hardly even talk today, even with some of the people I know.  I dont even feel like going to work at this point in time.  Last night, the moments we shared, where good, but something is still picking inside me.  Not nessisarily if she's cheated on me, but other smaller things.  I look at it almost like diving into a pool piss drunk.  You realize your having a blast but you dont know that if you dont get out of the deep end soon, you'll drown.  I feel like thats exactly what happened here.  I dove in, intoxicated with emotion, into the waters of what Tasha is, not thinking at that moment in time that maybe I should have waided in the shallow end.  And since I didnt think, I drown, and all my feelings left with my last breath.  Or maybe I was pulled out before my heart stopped, or came up and grabbed onto the side of the pool and pulled myself out, and now I look into the water with fear and uncertanty of if I should try diving back in.  Hell it might become a lasting fear with me, like that of those who experianced such a real life event.  But I dont wish to fear Tasha, or who she is, but something still keeps me away.  All in all, the one fact here is fear, Im really really really fearful of getting hurt, and yes, maybe I do feel like I am a fragile piece of glass at times, and yes, maybe I myself am a hypocrite because I take the easy way as well.  Whatever it is, its keeping me at bay, and not allowing me to pursue anything else with Tasha.  So, Tasha, if your reading this, dont get angry, or discusted, or anything, look within yourself deep, and I mean really really deep, and find out what you truely want, not now, but forever.  You may not know, and sometimes it takes a great deal of time, but I feel before and if anything ever does happen again, you really need to find yourself...."

"event","Another night, another part of a quite intricate web.  Today, and tonight was very, well, interesting.  I got up around 8am and then around 10 proceeded over to Jammin Java.  I was there for a while, talking with people, for example this opera singer Kristen, when Tasha popped up right behind me.  Kristen left and me and Tasha sat down and talked.  I asked what she wanted of me and she raised her eyebrows with the you know what look.  We both walked over to my car and kissed and then I had to fly of to work.  After work I went up there to chill, and talk with some of my friends there.  A few of them mentioned that Tasha left the following night with a guy I know there, to watch movies back at his place.  That and another guy mentioned some other things.  This set fireworks off in my head, and I was so just....disillusioned.  Kirsten, this south african that goes there, kept trying to hit on me the entire night, and tried to get with me, but then Tasha showed up after she got off work at Outback.  I asked her to talk to me, mainly about the guy going off with her to watch movies, and she said that they watched a burned copy of farenheit 9/11 and then she got a ride home.  I believe this only cause the guys good friend was up there when I found this out and he said he's the type of guy who will try to make things not seem so hard when they are sad, and he honestly is like that.  So with that said, it seems innocent enough.  Then, Tasha and I talked for a good 4 hours, talking about all types of stuff that involved our now terminated relationship.  We are on a friendly level, but it looks as if the relationship itself is no longer there.  We walked back to my car and more things occured, and then I dropped her off in front of this restaurant near where she is staying.  She doesnt want me to know what house she is at, something I understand, but at the same time dont, but I respect her wishes.  Shes with a family friend, so all should be cool.  Anyhow, the moments tonight where very powerful, but there is alot that still isnt quite there, with us I mean.  Also, I found out some very cool, but very scary news, but its good news in my opinion.  Well, I dont know whats next, tomorrow will tell, but for now, I gotta rest.  Night"

"event","Wow, Im suprised I even got sleep last night.  I was still wide awake when I tried to lay down and pass out, but I guess I did because I woke up about an hour ago.  Its wierd, when you dont sleep, and you suddenly find yourself getting some, it gives you this wierd high, not like a chemical high, but more like a body high.  Anyhow, I ran into Tasha yesterday after I got off work, mainly because I did want to try and find her and talk with her.  Well she was over at Jammin Java talking with this turkish guy we both know.  Her face was just soaked with tears, and she saw me, she started back up again.  The turkish guy tried to explain that the relationship we had was sick, at least at that moment in time, and that we both need to work on things in our own way.  I know I certainly do, but so does Tasha.  I need to get my life together, in terms of a job, getting in shape, getting money saved up, getting my own place, and living life the way I want to live it, without the help of family or friends.  Anyways, Tasha laid into me yesterday afternoon and slapped me a few times.  Yes, I did a really fucked up thing the other night by saying get the fuck out of the house, and I should have talked things over, but something inside me was bubbling.  That bubbling has fizzed at the moment, but the devestation is present, things are over.  We both sat across from eachother, occasionally giving glances, smiles, raised eyebrows, etc, but something was totally different.  Jesse pulled me aside and told me, there isnt anything you can do right now, but just make things worse.  At the same time we where talking, my sister called me up and said she was back at the house.  I also thought it would be good to leave, because Im sure it was uncomfortible, for both of us.  When I started to walk up the stairs to the coffee shop, I was in a daze, mainly for what had happened and also because I hadnt slept in 36 hours.  I just stared straight ahead and with a very meek voice said, ""I think im going home now"".  I started to slowly walk to my car, crushed, but turned around once to meet eyes with Tasha.  She had a very sad/concerned look on her face, the face of well I still care, but the distance was obvious.  I walked back to my car, drove home, and laid on my bed, thinking for a while, and then crashed.  Now, with today, I dont know whats next.  Only time will tell"

"event","As I said before, I couldnt sleep.  So I threw on my clothes and decided to walk down to Jammin Java to see if anyone was still around.  Along the way, I thought to myself what if I bumped into Tasha.  Well, that never was and I found myself over at the coffee shop with my good friend Jesse still hanging out with two others that where there.  We decided it would be cool to go over to the 29 Diner in Fairfax and get some coffee, since JJ was closed.  There we had a lengthly, but very enlightened convo.  Pretty much from what I gather, is that I was in an illusion in a sense, and looking for what really wasnt there.  By that I mean that I set expectations for us to a certain level, and since some things went sour, I bailed.  Maybe its a fear of dealing with the emotions involved, or maybe I was just ""feeding the dragon"", a coined term by Jesse.  In a sense, I kept feeding a dragon til it popped out to snap when it wasnt fed.  A very very interesting saying, one I'll carry with me now.  I know tomorrow is another day, I know there will be others, but I guess in a sense Tasha will always be special in a certain way.  Honestly, I feel more like myself than I have in the last 3 years, partially because of my own realizations, but also because of the experiance me and Tasha shared.  Yes there where bads, verbal abuse, cheating, lying, deception, but all in all, alot was gained too.  I hope that whatever Tasha does, she's happy in her own way, and I really wish her the best of luck, but for now, I need to regather myself, push forward, and obtain my place in the stars.............and one day, reach my place in paradise"

Then about 4 minutes later, Rosanne, Tasha's mom, calls asking where she is.  When I said I didnt know, and I suggested she stay with someone, she gets pissed off on the phone, pretty much by her tone of voice makes me feel incompetant, and then says ""I'll find her somehow!"" and hangs up.  Now because of this, I cant sleep.  I dont think I will tonight either.  I really honestly want to go walk, but at the same time, Im too lazy to do that.  I need sleep, fuck I work 8 hours tomorrow, but Im so tempted to call off, but that would make a bad situation even worse.  FUCK what is going on...was this really the right thing, or was it taken to such an extreme that its destroyed something that didnt need to be.  I really really really dont know right now, Im so confused.  Im tempted to go out and find tasha, if I can, but I doubt I will be able to.  Maybe I fucked up, maybe this is just a hard break up, maybe Im going to have to deal with the fact of a girl who now hates me, thinks Im some possesive psyco, and the people she knows thinking the same thing.  There are obviously side effects from all of this, where it will lead, time only knows....."

"event","Well, I dont know what to think now.  Things are all kinds of wierd.  As you can tell, there has been, over the last month or so, or more so in the last week, alot of ups and downs with Tasha.  Well, I was putting faith in myself to forget the paranoia's I had and try and push on through, but after meeting two people outside of near where Tasha works, not intentionally, I found some stuff out that didnt make sense.  I've had a vibe for a while now, and it was further strenthened by what others had to say.  Maybe Im being stupid and allowing others to piece together a puzzle I cant solve, but too many things right now dont click.  So with that said, I confronted Tasha and told her its the truth or the road.  Well she swore up and down that my assumptions where just that, and nothing more.  I didnt give in and kept on with what I thought, and ultimately, its lead to her leaving the house Im staying at, with who, I dont know.  I care, but then again I dont.  Im so confused.  Is this right?  I mean honestly I dont want to be with someone I cant trust, and who worries me night and day of what their doing.  Maybe it does stem from the fact she did something wrong, maybe it comes from something more.  Im so torn.  I, deep inside want to believe otherwise, but something is telling me to just leave.  I dont want to end up being in a position I cant get out of, so maybe thats why I let it go.  Maybe tomorrow, things will be different, but I really dont know. Fuck! I hate this shit.  After drinking some wine I went upstairs to my room to find her shirt laying on my bed, left there by here recently or after we made love....or was it love?  Hell she didnt even get that much off of it, so Im sure she cared less about it.  Maybe this whole thing tonight was a big ""you cant resist me"" thing to keep me in the picture, maybe it wasnt.  The whole point here is there are too many maybe's, too many questions, too many suspicions that cant be answered.  I hope its not because I get possesive and controling at times, but I only really do that when I feel there is wrong. FUCK FUCK FUCK.....goddamn!  Well, enough complaining, enough contimplating.  I really need to get some sleep, if I can even sleep.  The only thing that rings right now.....Did I do right????????

Im not going to give up so quickly as I thought I was going to do, but things, yes, will be alot slower, and more cautious, and hopefully, things will be cool.  I now doubt the things I thought before, because of the level of distance Tasha threw up when I kept poppin questions at her, and the constant look of discust on her face every time I mentioned something else.

Natasha, as I suspected, had cheated on me, and the only way I found out was by reading her journal again, after she reluctantly let me read it.  There was something scratched out in it, and I was able to read it.  Well it was all the evidence I needed.  Over the next day or two we talked alot, and I broke up with her, but that only lasted a few hours.  The problem I have now is I dont know if I can trust her.  I will go to work and the first thing I think of is who might she be fucking when Im not around.  I feel like she tells me one thing, but has something else in mind.  I feel like she is hiding alot more from me than I know.  At the same time I am so confused because she's stayed with me through all the crazy shit I've done, even when she had other options of things she could have done.  She says she loves me, she says she'll never hurt me again, but I am fearful that she is using me to continue her crazy life and using me as an emotional crutch, so that she doesnt feel as bad about the things that she does.  If this is the case, damn, what the fuck have I got myself into.  I based what I saw in her in the beginning, and found out it was nothing but half truths.  What the fuck am I to do now....Im so confused"

My friend Bobby, the guy who owns a film company and a good friend from highschool, didnt fully live up to his promises.  I found myself going left and right trying to find a job only to get a pizza job paying minimum wage.  Hell, I didnt go out to Vegas just to make pizza's.  You also needed a shitload of different licenses just to get a basic job, with each license costing around 35 dollars or more.  So with that being found out, I repacked my bags and took a horrific 2 day journey cross-country to get back home.  Now I am staying with my Mom for the meantime till I can get back on my feet.  I was able to get my old job back and I'll be starting with them here in the next few weeks.  Looks like I'll also be making more money as well, about 20 bucks an hour.  Not bad seeing as how I just sit on my ass all day.  Aside from the basic stuff going on, Im finding a little more odd things about me and Tasha's relationship.  Things where ruff after I found the journal entry about her and an ex, which she claims is a fantasy.  Now this is where it gets really interesting.  Last night after she had consumed some Gin and Tonic, I asked if she had ever wanted to tell me something but didnt tell me.  She said yes, and it was because she didnt want to hurt me.  Well that sparked some curiosity in me again, so I had another wrongful peek in her journal.  This time I went back further, back to our beginning days.  She talks about having phone sex and masterbating while on the phone with her ex, talks about his huge cock again, in great detail, and also talks about having a hotel night of fun where she agreed to pay half.  WTF!?!?!?!  I mean come on now, this is just plain stupid.  If this is an example of the things that she does, Im done.  The funny thing is she keeps on fucking questioning about my cheating fling in Vegas, and acts like Im a dirty little bastard.  Okay, I am, but still, this sounds a little hypocritical!  During the time that all this stuff has gone on, she and I decided it would be cool to get married.  But now that Im seeing all of this, I dont know if thats such a good idea.  I could be being overconcerned here, but this is yet another slap in the face!  I'll go ahead and try and submerge it for now, and see what goes on, but this, again, isnt looking good.  Ah, Why ME!!!!"

"event","God, I dont know what to think now.  Im so fucking confused its unbelieveable!  I havent written in my journal for some time, mainly because I've been out with friends, and as you guessed, spending time with Natasha.  Well just yesterday while she was out with family/friends, my curiousity got the best of me.  I read her journal which she writes in all the time.  None of it bothered me at all, but this one did.  I memorized it word for word:

""May 7, 2004

    Today I arrived in Orlando at around 4pm.  Jonathan(her last b/f) picked me up and we couldnt keep our hands and lips off eachother.  He took me back to his place and made me a spegetti dinner and afterwards we had amazing sex.  God his cock is so huge, I love it.  He made me cum in like 5 minutes.  Afterwards we rented Big Fish because he had never seen it before.....

And thats all she wrote.  Now, after gathering myself together about this, which took alot of courage and strength to do, I called Natasha back from her outing and we had the biggest fight ever.  She was furious that I read her journal, which she had every right to, and swore up and down that it was just a fanatasy and nothing more.  We cryed together, screamed together, shared other painful stories together, and in some small sense, made up.  However, this still bugs the shit out of me, because why would someone write in such detail a fantasy?!  Her other entries never mention anything else like that, so Im inclined to believe her, but something still nags at me.  I'm willing to forgive(but not forget) but if this is true, will it happen again.  Im a forgiving person, but not that forgiving.  I guess only time will tell.  For right now, I need to just think...."

Being with Natasha is like that of a wonderful dream...  It something that you never want to wake up from....

You might think my talks about her are a bit much in my journal, but here me now.  When you find a love like I have with Natasha, you'll know what I'm talking about.

Peace, love, Apathy, Humanity is such a beautiful thing!!"

Alex, Umbra, and I indulged ourselves with some sex with an alligator.  Now you may be thinking what the fuck, but truely this is one crutial mixed drink.  We had several and got into some really deep conversations.  A little while later me and Alex decided to go up to Exxon to get some smokes, and on our way I got some really crazy ideas to place CC Sells signs on cars and to kick lamp posts.  When we got to Exxon I thought it might be a good idea to get a car wash, not with an actual car, but with us alone.  We paid for it and then punched in our code and after that, it was all pure fun.  We got bombarded by powerful jets of water and soaked with soap suds.  After we got done we walked back, placing For Rent signs in unsuspecting victems lawns.  When we arrived back we found that Umbra had left to go home, so we called him back.  He eventually arrived and Alex and I stripped off our clothes so we could dry them.  Alex and Umbra then went downstairs as I tried to go back to the carwash.  I guess they are going to have their fun as I sit here and write my journal.  I hope they get done soon, cause that carwash is such a blast!  Damn I cant wait till my baby gets back so we can have fun like they are doing.  Oh well, time to drink some more and wake up tomorrow with the thought that I will see my baby soon!"

I then pop downstairs to write some music only to find Umbra called when I was downstairs.  He had bumped into someone I had long since forgot, Chris Sladkin.  Chris is an okay dude, but he is really wierd at times, a little on the freaky side.  I talked to him breifly and he started off with his usual casual insults of, ""still sitting at home doing nothing and reenacting?!"".  I talked to him breifly and then Umbra said he had to run, so now its time for me to head on over to Kirkpatricks and drink a few, and then come home to pass out.  Im really excited that Tasha is coming back, so hopefully passing out around 2am will help me wake up around 1pm or so, giving me about 7 hours before Tasha gets back.  Anyhow, time to drink!!"

I woke up this morning with a hangover, drinking myself to sleep after I found out that my g/f had taken something down in florida and was somewhat out of it, which scared me.  I heard that down there they use Ruffies as a party drug, and we all know what can happen from using something like that.  Anyhow I got a call this morning, from Tasha, and everything is cool.  Turns out the guy might have tried to do exactly that, but I guess it didnt work, hopefully.  After getting done with that, I got a call from the auto shop about the 77 lincoln.  Turns out it would be 2k to fix it up.  I said fuck that and drove over to pick it up, dropping my mustang off in the process.  While waiting at the register to get my keys, a guy comes in with his head bleeding like crazy.  He had hit his car door and it left a deep laceration on his skull.  While everyone else stood around dumbfounded, I was quick to act, bandaged him up, and got him on his way to the EM room.  I felt somewhat accomplished, seeing as how I helped this guy out.  Funny thing is, he still wanted to get the battery he had come to get.  Some people, lol!  I then took the lincoln over to the shopping center by my house and chilled out with Tonya and some other friends.  After getting overheated by the intense humidity and heat, I decided it was time to relax at home.  Now I am waiting to go out to dinner with my dad and some of his friends.  This should be fun, and a nice end to a hectic day."

Yea she is on vacation right now but she called every day before hand, and then for her not to call, its like woah whats up.  Turns out she was downtown on day and on the other she didnt have her phone on her.  So, with that said, I felt a little more comfortable, but something inside me still twitches.  I'll find out a little more when she gets back.  Besides that the day has gone well.  Last night I went to Bungalo's Billiards to do Karaoke night with 3 lady friends of mine, but nothing much happened, so I went home.  I then woke up this morning and finally got the tags for the 77 lincoln I bought at the beginning of last week.  Driving that thing is great, it rides so smooth, even though its got minor mechanical problems, its still a nice car.  I dropped that off at the auto shop and then picked up my friend Tonya.  We sat down to talk at starbucks like we always do and she mentioned how she almost got raped because someone put something in her drink after prom.  Hearing her story terrified me, as it was so graffic.  Luckily her cousin was there and she was taken home before she blanked out.  I cant understand why someone would do something so sick, and it worries me that might happen to Tasha.  After talking to Tonya for a while, I drove back home with ""The Last Samurai"" to chill for the evening.  So, with that said, time to sit back, think and watch a good movie.  I need to mellow out some, because when tasha gets back, there are going to be some things that need to be talked about."

When I returned home I found out that I had just locked them in my car, which was a releif but at the same time I smacked myself for being so stupid.  After I got my carkeys back I headed over to the range for a little fun.  After an hour of blasting away at paper targets, my friend calls me up and tells me he's got something going on.  So I roll over to his place and pick him and his friend up.  We end up spending most of the afternoon hoping all over northern va doing stuff for my friends friend.  We finally roll up to chris's house and get a small gathering going.  After getting messed up on all kinds of crazy stuff, I wondered home only to have the police stop me to question me.  When I say I need a ride a few houses down the cop gladly offers me a lift.  I get back to my house and chat with him for like maybe 5 min or so, and then get out and get inside.  I find it funny how twisted that is, at the fact of my in my current state.  But anyhow, time to mellow out."

He's the b/f of a girl i've know since highschool and we started to talk about all kinds of random shit.  I found out alot about people in the area, mainly some more scary info on that friend who likes to try to get with other guys girls, the guy who still will go unnamed.  Umbra then called when we where talking and came over and we bought many a round of Incredible Hulks, or Hpnotiq and Henessey mixed together.  While we drank we talked about many a crazy things and now it looks like we are going to chill here at my place for a while and see what happens.  We have many options for tonight, including DC and other places, but you never know what can happen next.

I guess the depression got to me, and that was my way of numbing the pain.  Anyhow looks like I might be going to the range here with Umbra to do some shooting, and at the same time get some video shots in.

It seemed like a good idea at the time, but now I feel like shit.  I dropped off Tasha today at the airport, shes going to Florida for a week.  Im happy she's going off on her own vacation, but damn, when you love someone that deeply, its hard to see them go off.  Then again, I did the same thing when I went to Vegas so its only fair.  Looks like I'm going out tonight with some friends to a hookha bar, or maybe I'll hang out with Umbra and Alex, as I really miss there company.  Either way I need to get out, cause after coming off speed and thinking hard about how much I already miss Natasha, if I dont do anything, my misery will only grow.

Well, Natasha came over after work tonight and I gave her the car keys.  She was so shocked, but extremely happy.  We drove over an hour later to check it out.  I sensed she was slightly disappointed since the car was so huge(it is a 1977 Lincoln).  She drove it, and seemed happy with it.  The only thing that came up, that could be negitive, is that when we got back, she acted a little wierd.  I asked her what was up and she said that this kinda scared her a little, since no one had ever been this good to her.  I asked if she wants me to calm down a little, more to her liking, she said no, dont change.  So this leaves me a little confused.  Im sure it'll work out, but it does leave me pondering in thought.

After I dropped her off I headed home to organize things for both the move and some stuff coming up in a week or two.  I tried ordering some stuff for this ww2 reenactment that Natasha is doing with me, but damnit, the stuff they had was too big.  After dealing with that I tried having a neighbor fax something for me, but ended up hearing the life story of her and Ashburn, which dragged on for a good hour(it was quite an enjoyable nap though).  After escaping that rambling lady for a neighbor, I drove over to Walmart to check out this 1977 Lincoln mark v for sale.  Well it was still there so I called the owner.  He agreed to come over and let me test drive it.  After finding out it was a pretty good ride, I found some mechanical problems, so the guy dropped the price from 1000 to 550.  Let me tell you, this is no beater, but a damn nice car! So after handing over 550 I held the keys to a new car, well, sorta new.  I plan to use it as a backup car, but I might just give it to Natasha, who doesnt currently have a car.  Either way this day has been quite entertaining, even more so since some time smoking hash.  Welp, til the next time"

After she left for work I packed up some of my firearms and headed over to the range for a little fun.  It was a blast!  I had plenty of fun and it helped mellow me out from all the stress that I had from the previous evening.  After that I went over to Starbucks to chill with my friend Tonya.

After she took off I got back home and now its time to relax before going over to my grandmothers house for a kickass home cooked meal.  Damn its been a while since i've had that!

"event","Well well well, its always interesting to find something to back up thoughts you had in your head.  Sometimes you like what you find, sometimes you dont.  I for one, with instant dont.  My girl, who by now you know I talk about alot, hangs out alot with a good friend of mine.  Thats cool, its good to see they are friends, however from what I've heard, and found out, its not going to be cool too much longer.  My friend, who will go unnamed, has a history of trying to get women who are dating other people.  In his mind, their friendship is more than that, and he gets the twisted idea that he's seeing her.  This one girl who he was after for more than a year now doesnt talk to him, because of all the wierd crap he pulled.  One time he got this girl drunk, and tried to force his way with her, when her b/f was just upstairs!  This was just one incident, not including he stalked her for I dont know how long, like waiting outside her house till she got home.  So, with finding that out, it bothered me what him and my girl where hanging out alot, cause this mirrored what he had done before.  Hell I watched him go through the whole mess.  Aside from hanging out alot, they get fucked up alot together, which again is cool, but not here.  Then, when going over to my friends house today I found an extra mattress next to his, and if this doesnt have alarm bells ringing in your head, I dont know what will.  When asking about that and other situations, he mearly says, ""I dont want to talk about it"" and then goes quiet.  On the flip side when I talk to my girl about what they do she says, hang out.  This could be true, and this guy could just be making his move, or, god forbid, the move was made, with or without her consent.  This is really scaring me because when a girl like I have says boldly her love for me, has strong interests in moving with me, and says stuff like your everything I could have asked for, and you find this out you dont know what to think.  I hope to god, if there is such a thing, that this is alot simpler than I think it is now.  The last thing I want to do, is loose her, as I see way too much potentual here.  I'm going to talk to her about it tonight, as I didnt want to bother her at her work.  Something has got to be done, cause this is not looking good!"

I've had crystal palaces of personal harmony laid apon ivory crumble before me.  But Natasha reassured me that the love we have isnt going to crumble, or isnt false, its true, and it continues to grow.  We also talked about our move together more, and we're both excited.

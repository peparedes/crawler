"event","Since two people posted on my last entry, I decided to give this guy my number.  Hey, he doesn't call, well he doesn't call and I don't waste my cellphone minutes.  See, I look on the bright side of things.  So tomorrow, Friday, I am going to hand him my phone number and see what happens.  I make a fool of myself anyway, so why not go all the way on it and give him my phone number....

Anyway, had family come in from Amsterdam, and NO they didn't bring any pot, weed, hash, mary jane or any other ""name"" that people have.  (it blows)  So, two hours in the car driving home from the Airport, man I needed prozac once I got out of the car with them.  They were so depressing me the whole way back.  Talking about death and this and that... Nice people, just need to talk about something more uplifting while in the car.  But they took over the house, stuff everywhere, and they are an older couple, nearing retirement.  They are here for three weeks.  How time is going to go by slow.

Have an art exhibit my design class is putting on, im in charge of invitations and flyers to put around the school.  Excited.   And this Saturday I am going to go to a car show... and speaking of cars, got my windows tinted on Tuesday, yippy.  No one can see in the car anymore.  I can pick my nose, dance to the music and even make funny faces to people next to me, oh the perks of tinted windows! :)

I will report back here tomorrow, or maybe saturday on the guy from work... but yes, Friday night I will be going to see John Pinette.  Great comedian.  I will leave you with a quote by him.....

""You been here four hour, you leave now!  You scare my wife!""--John Pinette
you have to say that in a chinese accent too b/c it takes place at a chinese buffett."

"event","Im currently at work right now, as much fun as it may be.  Well, there is this guy at my work that I like.  He walks by here all the time, and smiles at me and says hello.  AHHHHH!!! :)  Anyway, we talked last Friday, and i was talking about my dads friend owning a multimillion dollar business and doesn't find his sons capable of leaving the company in their hands, and all of a sudden the guy that I like said, ""well lemme give you my number."" and I was in shock, and then he said so you can give it to that guy so I can take the business, and I just freaked thinking he was going to give me his number.  Stupid me.  

But I saw him today and he invited me back to where he was since he had something for me... gave me a program which im excited about.  So thats that.

Also, we had some excitement as well.  We had 4 cruisers and Forensics out in front of the building.  They had a high speed chase of a red Mirage that ended up in our parking lot and they arrested the guy and stuff and then later on towed the vehicle away.  During that time, I got to talk to my man that I like and had some good laughs.  Im trying to gather enough courage to acually ask him out or even give him my phone number if he wants to call me sometime.  I don't know yet.  I should do it since any day could be your last and not be regretful on something.  So thats it.  This journal is like an all day thing, just writing things as it happens.  So, other than that, great!"

"event","Well, today was another exciting day here in lovely Florida.  Woke up and went to school.  I had my design class in which we are constructing an artist box.  So far so good.  Our teacher just announced that we will be putting on an art show at the college sometime in May.  Im excited about that.
I had a math test today, statistics, YUCK!  Lets just say that test kicked my ass on that one.  From there I bought some spray to frost my glass for my project.  Came home and watched a movie which was horrible.  Saw ""The Cube.""  Too bloody for me!  Then went out to dinner with my parents to Cody's and had me a steak and fries and my mom ordered me a Margerita, yum yum!  That is basically my day.

I have work tomorrow, and as I expressed in my first entry, I really don't care to go to work tomorrow.  Oh yeah, also planning on going to France in a couple months and also to the U.K and do some site seeing and esp visit some museums.  Also thought about renting a car over there and driving down to Toulouse and visit some small little towns and away from the hussle and bussle of the main cities.  Excited about it.  I have to tell my cousin that I might be going there to visit her for a few days and then head on my own someplace else and explore things for myself.  So that has gotten me into a great mood today!!!  Well thats all for me tonight."

"event","Well, this is my first time writing here.  Seems like a good way to get all my frustrations out instead of taking it out on someone, but what better place than the internet.

So lets start it off by saying that I think im losing myself.  Stress has officially taken over me.  Sad but true.
From work to school to family.  If it's not one, its the other, but in my situation, all three!  

First off, work.  I have been doing my job for the past two years working the weekend shift.  I know the routine and I know what im doing.  Just a few weeks ago, they hired a supervisor for my shift.  And this lady knows absolutely NOTHING.  And she is suppose to be ""my"" supervisor.  How can one supervise something they know ""NOTHING"" about?  Exactly!
So im stuck with this 50 something year old babysitting me, and also another 53 year old woman who is still trying to learn her job.  I've got one asking me things in one ear and another in my other ear.  Before it was just one person, so it would go one ear out the other.  Now I have two people and its clashing in the middle.  This is driving me nuts.  
My boss doesn't back me up on anything and they have something against me.  To make things worse.  Both of these women are extremely horny, desperate, or sluts, but my guess is all three. My supervisor thinks work hours is the best time to set up her booty calls, and I quote ""We need to see each other tonight because you need to service me!""  Now that is what I have to deal with on a constant bases!  She needs to be serviced ahh?  Well lemme service you right out that door.  But I can't.  Then I have the other lady who has dated 3 men that work with us, and is going on her 4th.  Plus she has a man she calls ""jew boy!"" And just recently had sex with him after knowing him for all of what, two months.  She even told me she didnt like him.  The last guy she saw from work is half her age.  She's got a daughter OLDER than him!  GROSS.
Now she told me the other weekend how she isn't with anyone.  I told her straight out, ""You have been with more men here at work in the past 4 months, than I have ALL my LIFE"" She gets around to say the least. And she denies it, I then said I would be more than happy to name them all. And said, ""Should I name them in chronological order or alphabetically?""  She shut her mouth real quick on that one, and my supervisor got all sorts of upset by me saying that.  Whatever!  So, I got that going for me at work.

School has just been one project, one test after another.  Always there, never ending.

Then parents.  Esp my mother.  She is one of those that is just stuck on looks and beauty.  I come home and all I hear is her bitching to me saying this and that!  But I can tell her I got the highest grades in the class and she couldn't care less.  And I finally told her off.  All she cares is about beauty and looks and I told her it hasn't gotten my sister very far.  Just 4 kids in a small studio in France, an asshole of a husband and is a chain smoker! My mom on the other hand is... well, lets just say I make more money than she does, and she also hates her job.  So I told her apparently looks hasn't gotten them very far in life.  They are both miserable.  On the other hand, im going to college to do something with myself and have a well paying job that is also paying my college.  Yes, it's not exactly the best place to be, but it is a stepping stone for me, while my mom doesnt have any more stones to climb up to.  Apparently brains has gotten me farther in life sooner than looks has for my mom and sister!  Im no super model, but im not ugly duckling either!  

That should do it for my first entry.  Just a little background into what is going on in my life right now so when I write in to bitch and moan some more, you'll know whats going on and wont be lost as to what is happening."

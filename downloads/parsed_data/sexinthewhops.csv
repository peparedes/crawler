"event","I did manage to have a little rendevous with Old Man but it didn't quite go how I expected.  I shall begin ....

My partners in crime - Patsy and Elvira (yes those are code names ... can you tell?), where there by my side to witness the antics that occured that evening.  We all roadtripped down to Bogansville for a night of heavy boozing and dry humping.  The fun began in mine and Elvira's room with a few beers and some fantastic 'female' conversation - read: sex and who was the best in bed.  Patsy turned up a little later and things became even more sordid as we told of our adventures in the sack and I enlightened everyone with the notion that it was all about the hip action.  Now when I say I enlightened everyone, I think the whole floor heard me because there was an abrupt bang on our door with a lady yelling at us to shut up.  How rude!  I was only sharing my experiences in hopes that it would help everyone's sex life out a little bit.  And trust me, it is ALL about the hip action.

Anyway, we drunkenly stumble out the door and head to the various pubs along 'The Strip'.  Within five minutes of being in one pub I had some lanky, not very attractive mug come up and try to hit on me.  Sure he was a nice enough guy but the conversation was utterly boring and there is no way I would've tapped his ass.  Like I said, I'm all about the hicks and whilst I don't doubt his hillbilly antics, he was a nerd through and through.  I've dated nerds before and I vow to never, ever venture into the land of geek again.  I think he got the picture and left after he overheard me talking to Patsy and Elvira saying how hideous he was.  Now before some of you start bitching, yes I know it was incredibly mean of me, but I've dealt with guys hitting on me in bars before and been polite about it all and they don't get the picture.  At least being a total cunt stain works and they usually fuck off pretty quickly ... even if their self-esteem is shattered afterward.

We were bopping away and I noticed one of Old Man's friends at the bar.  I swaggered over to say hello and asked if he might know where Old Man was.  I was a tad confused when he started laughing but was soon enlightened when I realised that Old Man was infact standing right next to him.  Why did I not recognise him you ask?  Well aside from the fact that I was ripped off my tits, he had a new hair cut.  A new hair cut that I would never expect to see on him.  He looked like Beavis or as Patsy put it ""It reminded me
of Vanilla Ice with a flat top that had gone wrong"".  Instead of saying hello to him I burst out laughing.  Way to make someone feel special for all the wrong reasons!  And to take it one step further I shouted out to Patsy to come have a look at his shitty new hair cut.  We spent the next five minutes in a fit of giggles and his friends joined in on the humour.  I'm sure he was standing there wanting to stab me in the face the whole time and I probably would've deserved it.

Everytime I looked over at him I couldn't get past the fact that he looked like Beavis and had some how morphed into a total prepster.  One of his friends was asking whether I was still keen to hook up with him but for the first time I was hesitant about getting some Old Man loving.  You all probably think I'm incredibly superficial but the fact of the matter is, for me to want to bone someone, I've got to be frothing at the mouth wanting to get them naked not constantly cracking up laughing at how comical they look.  I did feel bad about the whole thing and sent him a text today briefly apologising about the rain of torment I unleashed upon him.  He hasn't responded.  I think Beavis is in a bad, bad mood with me.

After this weekend I can almost gaurantee I have a front seat ticket for hell.  I think Satan and I will get along just fine, don't you?

Now before I wrap this up I would like to add that I have not forgotten about my Meat Pole.  He's been sending me text messages every now and then and I'm hoping he still gets a woody when he thinks about me.  In my drunkeness on Friday night I sent him a text message informing him that I was boozed and missing him.  I didn't expect a reply because no guy I have ever met has responded to my drunk rambling.  I know I can always count on my Meat Pole to deliver however and he replied leaving me feeling funny in my tummy.

I wonder what will become of Meat Pole and I?"

"event","I will keep this brief.  On Friday night I met a guy, who I shall affectionately call Bumfluff.  He was the hickest of the hicks and about as rough as you can get.  I'm guessing his IQ wasn't all that high either judging by the conversation we had.  Anyway, for research purposes, I gave this guy my number.  I'm starting to think this three day rule is just a bunch of wild lies.  He rang me the next day wanting to see if we could catch up.  Luckily I was in another town about to begin a night of debauchery with some other poor soul and I told him I would call him later.  I don't even have his number.  He hung up without even realising I didn't have it.  He's a smart one isn't he?  In conclusion, that three day rule is a bunch of hogwash and is clearly out-dated.  This is the second time I've been contacted by my subject within 24 hours of meeting."

"event","Well it certainly wasn't 3.8 seconds, let me tell you that!

The date in Hicksville, population 2, was rather good actually.  Mind you, I am a pretty simple, no frills kinda gal, so if I've got a beer in one hand and a hot boy in the other, I'm good to go.

I arrived at Meat Poles house early that evening where he surprised me with a gift.  A necklace.  It wasn't a hunk of gold but a lovely simple woven beaded necklace, exactly my style.  He's known me a week and has already pegged my taste in jewellery!  This boy sure isn't simple in all he does :P

We relax back, have a few beers and decide what movie session to go to before dinner.  Through a haze of smoke a decision is made.  We head off, he was very gentlemanly and paid for everything and pulled no seedy moves on me in the theatre, despite the fact we went and saw a horror movie and I was screaming like a little girl.  In fact, if it was anyone pulling out the moves, it was me *reow*.  By the time the movie was finished I just wanted to ride him like .... er ... yeah you get the picture.  I was randy.  There is something about a rough country boy that I find incredibly sexy.

Next we relived our youth by skulling back some beer out in the square before heading into the local bogan bar.  There we chugged back more beer, played shoot 'em up games on the arcade machine and caught up with some friends.  What happend to dinner you ask?  Fuck dinner, I just wanted to get drunk.

We drink, we mingle, we go home ... on the bus, classy shit right there mate, we fool around, we sleep.  What?  No shagging?  That comes later ....

I dragged Meat Poles ass to the city the next night for a party.  He blended in well and the city slickers loved him.  He even got my friends seal of approval, so in order to celebrate this wonderful occasion, we shagged.  No, not at the party in the toliet, although the thought did cross my mind, but back at home.  3.8 seconds?  No way!  More like 38 minutes and then some.  Jackpot!  I was right about his endurance.

I shall wrap this up by saying that those hicks sure know how to leave a woman lying there feeling incredibly satisfied.  I had a grin the size of North America plastered across my face.  Ladies, I highly recommend some country boy loving if you're in need of a pick me up.  Just not my Meat Pole, my mission; to make this steamy hunka lurve my main squeeze.

Yours in foreplay and beer

"event","I will keep this introduction brief.  I will attempt to entertain you all with my experiences of dating hicks.  See I'm a city girl and here we are over-run with metrosexuals ... yes that's right, men who take longer to get ready than Ivana Trump and have more skin products than the average woman.  I've decided I want a real MAN, not someone who has a better complexion and nails than I do.

I will not name names and in no way I mean this to be derogatory.  Right, now that that bullshit is out of the road I shall begin.

Scene: A nightclub in small town New Zealand
Time: Approximately midnight
Subject: A very cute, slightly rugged guy leaning on the door frame - I am still unsure if the lean was due to far too much booze or he was just 'looking cool'

We are introduced, we talk, he buys me some drinks and we end up back at his place.  I will say right off the bat that no shagging whatsoever occurred, just a bit of dry humping and a whole lot of kissing.  But who knew dry humping could be so much fun?  I certainly didn't!  I'm just glad no one had to leave the room with stains on their jeans.  Was that too much information?  Anyway, cut to the chase.  The next day he asked for my number.  I gave it to him not expecting to hear from him again ... we all know what guys are like right?  So I'm out the door and within 30 minutes he has texted me already saying he wishes I was still there.  I gasp in horror.  Isn't one supposed to wait the obligatory three days before making any sort of contact?  Clearly he doesn't know the rules, but then hey, I don't play by the rules so maybe this guy is ok.  I text him back and we end up having a conversation that goes over the next two days.  At least he has endurance ;)

Then today he texts me and tells me ... and I quote ... that he wants to take me out for 'a good feed'.  Do I need fattening up and what exactly does a good 'feed' consist of?  I think it's 'hicks' way of saying that he wants to take me out to dinner, well at least I hope it is.  And I was wondering, should I be concerned that he tells me about every two hours that he misses me?!  *Gasp*  My free McD's better be worth all this emotional strain.  He also said he wanted to 'hold me in his ams' and told me not to let the 'bed bags bite'.  I'm hoping he is better at romancing than he is at spelling and grammar.

Which leads me to my question.   Does the average Hillbilly take 3.8 seconds to blow his load after taking you out for an exciting evening dinner at McD's?  I'll let you know after the weekend."

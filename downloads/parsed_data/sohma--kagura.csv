"event","<i>""When I see how things are with you, I know all too painfully what a sad day I have come on at the end of too long a life. I would have expected the world to end before this was allowed to happen, and I see not a ray of light in it all.""

""Dear sir, we must accept the disabilities we bring from other lives. Everything that has happened to me is a result of my own inadequacy.""</i>


Oh Genji...your words speak so true for me at this time. The looks on my school friend's faces as I told them I was to leave...the look was that of sadness and pity. I suppose they could see through my smile to my sadness. Oh, it wasn't sadness for my circumstances... I let them think that, though... Then again, I should not belittle my friends to not knowing me well enough. I'm not one to get sad for myself. Everything...yes <i>everything</i> that has happened to me is a result of my own inadequacy. I've already done such a horrible thing in this life, I cannot imagine what my past lives held. 

Yet...am I hypocritical for only thinking this rings true for myself? I can simply not believe the others deserve the same. Is this thought too dark of one for me to allow into my heart?

Do we all find ourselves this undeserving? Has this humbleness of mine branched into depression? 

Does it really matter?

Yes...I suppose it does. I do not defy the laws of Dharma after all. If I care about the others...I really do need to stay happy. I need to stop being so hard on myself...

<i>My heart is like a ship upon the seas.
I am easily moved. Scolding will not improve me.</i>



All this time I resolved to become a better person. For myself and for the others. Admittedly, especially for Kyo-kun. He, after all, has to deal with the worst of my emotional outbursts. The heart is so truly illogical to figure we should hurt the ones we love most. Yet, we call those who do wrong ""heartless"".

Yet, through all my attempts, Kyo-kun is still the one to have pulled me out of my self-loathing enough to realize the kindness that surrounds me. The kindness that they are so willing to offer to me...and I am so willing to offer them, but not willing to offer myself.

Oh Kyo-kun...I wonder if you have any idea how much you've helped me? 

<i>Without the staying hand...</i>

I can only hope to offer the same comfort to everyone else on this island. 

If the heart has the right intentions...I should be able to...shouldn't I?

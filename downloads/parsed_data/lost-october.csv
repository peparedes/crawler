<i><u>Epitaph for a Darling Lady</u>

All her hours were yellow sands,
Blown in foolish whorls and tassels;
Slipping warmly through her hands;
Patted into little castles.

Shiny day on shiny day
Tumbled in a rainbow clutter,
As she flipped them all away,
Sent them spinning down the gutter.

Leave for her a red young rose,
Go your way, and save your pity;
She is happy, for she knows
That her dust is very pretty.

-- Dorothy Parker</i>

"event","It's certianly not perfect, but here's a calendar of Buddhist holidays/observances that I ganked from a few different sites and then modified. Most of the observances are Tibetan, but there are also the big three Zen days (Buddha's birth, enlightenment, and death) because I like to celebrate those things outside of Vesak, and then there are a few days relating to Kuan Shih Yin because I have a love and respect for her as another embodiment of Chenrezig/Tara. I know, I know. I'm such a Salad Bar Buddhist.
There are a number of things not included, I know, such as auspicious days, prayer flag days, moons, certain pujas, etc. If there is anyone on my f-list (looooong shot here) that knows anything about the Tibetan Calendar, and knows that I've missed something BIG (are there more days for the Medicine Buddha or Chenrezig, or more Sojong Days, for example?) then feel free to let me know. It feels a little bit incomplete.

I'm going to be waiting awhile before any more submissions. I need to either get some of my better poetry back from the magazines or get to writing. I'm running out of (good) work!

Right now, I'd like to do an update on my writing.


So far, I have written 12 poems this year.

I have submitted 8 poetry manuscripts to literary magazines.

I have received 1 rejection (from <i>The American Poetry Review</i>), and I am still waiting for responses from the others.

It has been 24 days since I sent my submission to <i>The Paris Review</i>.

It has been 20 days since I sent my submissions to <i>Poetry</i> and <i>The Threepenny Review</i>.

It's only been one day since I sent my submissions to <i>The Sun</i>, <i>The Yale Review</i>, and <i>Folio</i>. I also sent out a new submission to <i>The American Poetry Review</i>.

I set up some tickers on iGoogle (<3) to help me keep track of my waiting periods. I have quite a long way to go.
<a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v638/lost_october/_screengoogle.jpg""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v638/lost_october/_screengoogle2.jpg""></a>
Click through to large screencap.

I think I'm going to send out 4 submissions for every rejection I get and then some. I'm trying to get somewhat serious about this.

Oh, I also am going to stop using Allpoetry.com so that I can focus more on getting published. So if you would like to read any of my poetry from now on, it would be best just to contact me and I will send you some. :)"

"event","Awhile back, I posted about a bunch of artwork that I had saved on Photobucket getting deleted for violating their terms of service.
Now, this was work from <a href=""http://www.audrey-kawasaki.com"">Audrey Kawasaki</a>. I had more of her art saved in the same album. A good amount of her work does deal with nudity and erotica, but nothing I posted was any worse than anything else I had seen hosted by Photobucket. 
I guess some nudity is more kosher than others? It seems unfair, but by agreeing to the Photobucket terms of service when I signed up, there's nothing I can do but bitch and moan about the whole thing.
For giggles, I thought I'd try ImageShack (and see if they'll have any problems with them) and post the ""unacceptable"" pictures for anyone who might be interested in seeing them.

Bipolar Disorder: You are Bipolar Disorder. With Bipolar Disorder comes very dramatic mood swings called episodes of mania or depression. With a mania episode, there's an increase of energy, an overly happy mood, extreme irritability, talking really fast, jumping from one thought to another, and an unability to concentrate. There's very little sleep needed, an unrealistic belief in one's own abilities and powers. Poor judgement and spending sprees arefrequent in a Manic Episode, same with an increased sex drive, abuse in drugs and alcohol, and agressiveness. Funnily enough, there's also a denail that anything is wrong.When in a Depressed Episode, you or  a REAL bipolar person tend to be depressed all say every day until the episode is over. There's a noticable lack of interest or pleasure in anything during the episode. There's also significant weight loss or weight gain. Insomnia or hypersomnia every day, fatigue or loss of energy, excessive feelings of worthlessness, indecisiveness, and suicidalness. Medication will be good for you for the depression episodes.<br/>Take this <a target=""quizilla"" style=""color:rgb(0,0,0)"" href=""http://quizilla.com/redirect.php?statsid=17&url=http://www.quizilla.com/users/Mimiru666/quizzes/What+Mental+Disorder+Are+you%3F"">quiz</a>!<br/>

2. <strike><i>You know, sometimes I wish I did a little more with my life instead of hanging out in front of places selling weed and shit. Like, maybe be an animal doctor. Why not me? I like seals and shit. Or maybe an astronaut. Yeah... be the first motherfucker to see a new galaxy, or find a new alien lifeform... and fuck it. People would be like, ""There he goes. Homeboy fucked a Martian once.""</i></strike> <b>coldwizard</b>

3. <i>I hope that when the world comes to an end, I can breathe a sigh of relief, because there will be so much to look forward to. </i>

4. <strike><i>When I first came here, this was all swamp. Everyone said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same, just to show them. It sank into the swamp. So I built a second one. That sank into the swamp. So I built a third. That burned down, fell over, then sank into the swamp. But the fourth one stayed up. And that's what you're going to get, Lad, the strongest castle in all of England.</i></strike> <b>smeebubbles</b>

5. <i>Strange, isn't it? Each man's life touches so many other lives. When he isn't around he leaves an awful hole, doesn't he? </i>

8. <strike><i>It's a bridesmaid's dress. Someone loved it intensely for one day, and then tossed it. Like a Christmas tree. So special. Then, bam, it's on the side of the road.

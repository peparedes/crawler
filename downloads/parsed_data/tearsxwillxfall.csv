"event","well. today was interesting to say the least. i took kyle homw after school and decided i would stay for a little before i went to work .. i told him iwanted to take a nap and cuddle a bit it would be cool but instead when i tried to leave he kinda tried to force himself on me lol. it was pretty funny but at the same time... scary .... 

so i went to work lol and then after work britty didnt want to go out anymore so i stayed home 
then my friend adam who jsut got back from the marines.. he got kicked out messaged me. 
so iwent and picked him up. visited my mom and then adam and i watched mail call.. lol 
so all the sudden i get a call from a resricted number and im like wtf so this person was being obnoxious and was clearly on something and adam started talking to him and told him to come over yadda yadda... i dont know who it is lol and welll they came and threw potatoes on my driveway. and adam said ""friends dont leave potatoes on friends driveways"" lol it was funny. so i still dont know who these people are and well there are potatoes in my lawn and so on lol! i took adam home but now im sitting by myself lol waithing for a call or some more potatoes. lol

"event","no words of wisdom come from my pathetic lips. 
no traces of sympathy for you my wounded friend
you leave me speechless
in your misconduct and remorse
edging futher into the path of self inflicted danger
hoping yet again to win affection of people so vile
only to be throw back on your knees
a position well known by now.

"event","I am dating a boy.... finally. his name is casey worthing. he is super amazing yet i doubt him so much .. i never thought that i would really be affected so much by what my father has done to me but i know that thats why i am this why. why i cant trust casey why i cant comprehend that he really likes me...he isnt perfect ..yes.... but he is damn close to the best thing for me. he has yet to tell him ex grilfriend that he is dating me .. and thats upsetting we started dating tuesday july 11 ... and she still doesnt know. yes this upsets me but i need to let it go because he really does like me and i know because of the way he is around me. i am becoming myself i miss my family but i have made a new one. caseys family treats me as their own and i would rather be there in that house waiting for them to come home for hours than anywhere else i can think of. they love me. and thats more than anyone has ever shown me. so as i sit here infront of this screen on this website... for the 100000th time .. tears come to my face. this truly is a journal and i love it. casey took my virginity on june 18 and i dont regret it. i think i may be falling in love with him. and i can only hope he feels the same. maybe not love. because thats something erned in time .. but he is edging his way to me. and im letting him in. this is so unlike me. such a different ...... fill in the blank. i dont want him forever. im not naieve. he is so much like the man that i am looking for for when i do find someone forever. he is great with kids. he has a great sense of humor and although he lacks in responsibility i know one day he will mature and be great. he will truly make someone happy. i just hope that he realises this and never lets anything stop him. 

i had a horrible dream the other day. becuase we've been tlaking about me getting pregnant alot lately and he is afraid of it... so am i.. in my dream i got pregnant. and he got mad and hit me then tackled me ... like how people punch their stomach to try and get rid of a baby) he was trying to kill it but he killed me instead. and it was weird cause i wasnt me i was watching me ... it scares me 


OZZFEST: anna greg emolee and matt ditched me ... so i went alone. had a balst .. missed my favorite bands 
bleeding through walls of jerico and between the buried and me. but it was okay cause i did get to see ozzy BLS system of a down AX7 dragonforce disturbed 

i got to see sean (fluffy) and my friend ty from west virginia .. and i never get to see them ive seen them both like 3 times... lol but talk to them all the time.  



my mom is faced with the decision of moving into a house in monongahela or moving back in with larry ( didnt i tell you? im living with my aunt right now larry kicked us out 2 days before school ended. i dont really care anymore)  but yeah i want the house but she doesnt know what she wants.. i dont want lerry. or his house. he is way to far away from anything that i want. and my mom is truly selfish if she chooses him . eventhough i told her i jsut wanted her to be happy. i neeed a car.   she is so dependent but not .. and it hate it she feels she neds a man . needs someone to help her and she dosnt but being brought up that was has taught he to depend on a mans income. she is slowly learning how to conserve money. 
i love her yet i hate her. 


i have casey to hold me. so no matter what i know that ill be okay. and honestly .. thats what men are for. comfort. they are the thumbs of the people who sucked thier thumbs when they were little .. they are the security blanket some warmer than others they are the ciggarettes ..... so on and so forth... and i like mine for the time being 



lets just see who breaks whose heart this time..... this should be interesting <3333333333333333333333333333333333333"

"event","well, you could say i'm doing better or you can say i've forgotten alot. you could laugh at how i used to be, but cry over the person i've become. I'm still the same however, if you look at it in other ways. but yet i feel so different and so much more like myself 

6-18 will be remembered forever 

portugal. the man is amazing.

My family has fallen apart. its official. Katie doesnt talk to any of us and krystina is more or less a sponge. I'm afraid my mom is not okay. I think she's not going to last much longer. I jsut got over walking pnemonia and i feel fine. as of right now, i think my life is shaping up. we are looking for a new house and are in the mean time livign with my aunt. I'm seeing casey. who is an amazing kid eventhough he tends to piss me off occasionally. i hope one day we will officially date. I miss the feeling of home and the feeling of being wanted. life truly is the slowest death. i feel like we are all just waiting here. there is nothing more. there is nothing here. i want to help.. but help what? help who? who deserves it. what will be worth my while. what will reallllllly last? nothing it all falls to nothign and all your efforts are meaningless. i love anna ... shes my new best friend and i love her munchies!

life is a huge let down .... 


im sorry im that heavy burden 
that weighs down your shoulders 
im sorry im that stem 
that branches all your misfortunes
you speak of letting me go 
something you are not capable of 
its time to look past yourself 
and realize your actions and who they affect 
you hide behind you instability 
and place the blame 
you never think of yourself 
as the one who is insaine 
send out your sos call
let everyone know your reckless emotions 
take your time before you address your problem 
and watch as your loved ones suffer 
give them no pitenance 
show them no mercy 
hurt the people who love you 
because its the best thing you do"

"event","update: living iwth crazy mom she thinks im suicidal and if i was i would have done it by now because of what shes put me through i see a phsychiatrist and i play softball same old story as last year... same old fucking story. katie and i never talk and yes it upsets me .cause i want a big hapy family who loves eachother i never stop thinking about him. and i raided his myspace(it says hes married and i was curios and cant sleep) and everygirl or comment or anything is like an image of me. missmatched socks naming his bike .. and i want to be the person who names it .... ugh i got sick looking at it all  because i like him so much jesus christ  will this be the story of my life? hurting them then how many months later realizing that i loved them .. kelley who doesnt believe in love who is a stone and who wont date because its pointless... well yeah ilove him .. i know it .. i cant get this ""i cant breath im going to throw up sickness to go away but it is accompanied by the all familiarity of blurrily typing complaints through tear matted eyelashes and once again here i am spilling my feeings to you instead of the people who should be hearing it. and im stuck in my own trap my own hurt karma realy is a bitch i know in a year i wont care... i know ill find someone else... who i will know to ignore the stupid iggnorant comments or confront them and this cycle will be broken. i just want to know if he wants anything to do with me ... he never answers his phone its a good thing his machine makes me laugh or i would have given up hope a week ago i call him like once maybe twice a day and he called me back once.. and im giving up hope .... but then he messages me on myspace and says sorry for not answering .. i think i just blocked him out .. when i did this i just didnt do anything i let him call and showed him no hope ( i think) im completely hypocritical and i just want to talk to him in person for 20 mins... im going to chiodos on monday i hope and if hes there... i might find the courage to talk to him but hell probably have some girl on his arm who is an image of me who never has matching socks who names everything who laughs constantly and who hugs and cuddles constanly hell tell her he cant trust a girl ever again because his crazy ex grilfriend ruined his life and the one before that was a little nuts as well  shell fall in love with his stupid jokes and his cute little walk shell hold his hand while he drives and watch him ride his newly named bike shell joke abotu how he played the trombone and snaps his fingers when he walks shell stay in his arms and enjoy the curve collogne shell pull his hair cause he likes it and scratch his back cause it makes him sleepy hell tell her that shes beautiful and that he wants to have her forever but he knows it wont last but his naiveity will disguise this misfortune for promise and hell fall in love with er.. and when she dumps him hell say why does everygirl do this to me why do they all hurt me like this and no one will have th answer but hes not alone.... this is the plight of everyone the never ending cycle of brokenness because the unrealistic perfect marriage that his parents share is a rarity and something i bet he will never obtain ... maybe im wrong.... maybe he still loves me like he said to me the day i told him to stop being so overdramatic and stop crying. maybe we can be together again and i can mend that beautifull broken heart i so carlessly tossed aside becuase i was hurt by something he casually said with no intentional hurt. and we can then go on pretending i never scarred him and that he never stopped loving me. that would be my dream my naively drawn to scale unrealistic desire ......"

"event","dear father 

when i think about you dying
thoughts rush to my head
i could never bear the sight
of ever seeing you dead
tears start to fill my eyes
and run their trail down my face
each one a reminder 
that you can never be replaced
but somethings holding me back 
from loving you the way that i would
maybe its your lack of intrest 
and never being the father you should
i wish our relationship 
wouldnt have fallen apart 
and our feelings towards eachother
could be given a new start 
but nothing changes the facts 
you were the one to leave 
you left me waiting and pretending 
and up until now i did believe 
this final realization 
this last step towards somethign new 
i dream of becoming 
more than what came to you"

"event","warning .. dont read this.. please its me complaining nad this is just for me as an atempt to not be so sorry formyself k leave me alone 


well .. to start my ex b/fs friend died his name was kyle i never really got to know him all that well .. and i was confused at first as to who he was .. and just like 10 mins ago i read josh away and it said zoom-zoom and i remember everything except his face .. he wore a lil hat when he took my sister to work we did a huge u turn in the middle of the road and i screamed .. i feel like shit that i cant memeber his face or that i didnt member who exactly he was .. god i suck .. rip kyle<3

futhermore i feel like shit... im so sick of just how like ... unwanted i am .. friends can make you feel loved but only to a certain extent .. i want security but when i come close to it i push it away .. i dont know if this is like a realy problem or just some phsycological bullshit that ill get over .. what if its not .. what if i continue ruining any relationship that actually works you know .. god i find someone i like then i second guess myself and fuck everything up .. yeah i will admit.. i think its the attention and security that makes me want to be with soemone .. other than that im fine .. i need that feeling i need to be loved and someone somebody ugh it urks me to just be .... alone and i constantly feel lost and inferior second best to my best friend an example .. jessica i love jessica .,.. but shes a little buit of a whore ok maybe alot and i just feel a guy should want a respectable girl as opposed to a slut ... like i dont want someone who i feel constantly compared too i dont want to feel like i have to out do her or that i should be seen as pretier but thats how this messed up shallow world we live in has made us ... its ridikulus that we have coem to this honestly .. 

also theres so many things i want .. i want to lose weight i want to go to the x mas dance i wanna not stay home and wonder how all my friends are enjoying themselves and im not going cause i didnt have a date and i just didnt go .. like comeon 
(if you havent stopped reading yet .. stop now all this bullshit is for me to let out cuase i dont wanna but a burden on someones head to feel sorry for me im not like stop reading honestly) 
i havent talked to my dad in like 4 months and it kills me everyday 
i want his sooo bad 
thats all i want is just a dad god damnit maybe this is that cause of all my insecurities my mom  wasnt good enough for my dad so he left i dont wanna be hurt 
i dontrely on guys to do shit for me i dont want to be left alone i dont want to push everyone away but maybe i di it cause i dont wanna get pushed away first its inevitable  gah ...  i want to learn how to love nadi wanna feel loved.. something i dont think ive ever felt ive never let anyone ive come close but nothing sets it apart .. ive come close ive got there and instead i just end it or they do ... not just bf/ gf 
friends too .. it seems so fucked up how we live... theres no meaning to it .. none ... its so absurd that life is so pointless .. how else can i rephrases this to emphasise it .. honestly .. do we live for eachother what makes up keep going what chalenges us to take another breath 

nothing comes to mind 

ive been miserable for so long underneath this masquarade 
and im good with disuises 
each step i embrace with a smile 
each breath with a thought of choke 
each moon with a new customer 
living this lie 
living this disorder
what are you waitign for 
its comming to life 
its your turn to 

let this hate branch from you 
let your faults and frailties comsume your fate 
it should have never happened this way 
you should have left like the others 


and this time i wont fool myself 
into thinking otherwise 
my existence wasted 
and so is yours 
because you wasted it on me


yeah wahtever .. i like the end ... 


im starting a band with my friend taylor but i cant write lyrics but its just a band for shits n giggles 

i saw from first to last he is legend they rocked i loved it .. the end"

things went pretty well 
i like my classes.... 

and i have mr bowker for spanish 2 i literally jumped on him 
not liek all the way but i ran up nd threw my arms around him he wasnt expecting it im soooo happy like seriously.. .lol 

felicia is in my home room/first period .. she cheated on dave and shes just no good shes a fucking fat ugly slut and daveis thenicest romantic guy ive ever even looked at lol .. and he deserves oss much better and i cant promise a long term relationship .. but i can treat him better than her... 
so i ignored her i wouldnt talk to her.. and when she finalyl got me to speak she was like "" i cried too kelley and i deleted his number nad when he calls i tell him not too"" im like wft that doesnt make it better.. you cheated on him .. youve lied to him 3 other times.. thats your 4th fucking chance.. you are a no good dirty whore so....i got lunch with dave.... i saw him sitting by himself eatin lol and i was like DAVE and i went up to him and said and i quote "" dave you are dumping your g/f and dating me""  he said ""says who""  i said "" ME"" and he just looked at me .... and i was like well .. and he said "" i cant make up my mind"" and i was like "" fine you lost your chance nevermindi dont want you"" lol im a bitch but ill get him dont worry :)   wo0ot 



so then well thats about it ... 

went to work miserable left happy as can be .. went home finally saw my mom (chris and lyndsay picked me up and we were headingfor the mall)and iwas like mom i need some stuff for school like despreatyl -pulls out little list- notebooks binders pencils Q tips shampoo socks  and ponnytail holders and i mlike its stuff i really need... and shes like ok well follow me to thebank ... 

and thne she hands me a 20 im like well thats money i suppose but i was like .. ""is that it "" ( yes now i realize how bad that is ... like really ishouldnt of had said that...)   and she freked and ripped the money outta my hand....    but 20 bucks isnt enough for the stuff i needed and it wasnt like i didnt need it .. parents are supposed to supply you with q freakin tips and shampoo and notebooks stuff for school... and so .. i started crying .. she has given me nothign this whole summer.... nothing at all .. 
ok she bought me 2 bras... thats it .. not everfood... im dead serious.. she and my dad have equally shared the bills i think im pretty sure so ... i dotn know hwere all her money is going .. so then ...i call dad .. and hes like sure..i have some money for you and we stopped by to get it .... i cry more and im crying to him and stuff and his phone rings.. "" hold on "" and he answers it im liek havign an emotion brakdown .. which doesnt happy too often you know and he answers the phone .. then ... the kids wont leave us alone n shit im al lpissed... so we leave go ot the mall smoke a cigarette cause lyndsay wanted too and then went it and i got hlf the stuff i needed for 20 bucks 
less than half and i looked for all the sales n stuff i as cheap .. and i still went over... in cvs ..

lyndsay got out and started to panic and called nate i couldnt open my door so i had to get out her side so she calls nate and i take the phone to tel lhim where we are lyndsay sits on the driveway nad lays down and then starts screaming about her neck i gues all the adrenaline made her not even think about it ... the problem was that i was wearing my seatbelt and she wasnt .. so she hit her head pretty bad so nates on his way i got back to lyndsay cause shes crying she tells me her neck hurts really bad and to call and ambulance i was like 911 .... wo0ot so i call it was pretty cool eventhough it was hectic and lyndsays hurt but it was still cool .. so ambulance comes and takes her to the nottinghma township building to get lifelighted and she goes to the hospital it was pretty scary... but i handled it well until her mom arrived atfter lyndsay left and started screaming "" kelley what the hell are you doing here lyndsays not even supposed to be with you"" im like .. huh? no one ever tells me anything ... then im liek whatever nad her g ma hobbles on over nad we start talking i was like "" i dunno what happened we were tlaking and then .. i guess i jsut distracted her"" of course you distracted her kelley you always distract her .. she has a panic attach everytime you are around .."" im like WTF and start crying after she turned and started walking away... i guesss it was my fault .. me being the passenger with my seatbelt .. lol allwell lyndsay and i are cool i just hate her family...

"event","By the shredded remains of my existence, you may no be able to recognize me former brilliance. It does not bother me that i have lost me lovely crimson color, my pride has not yet left me, even though my master has. How ironic, that the same hand that thrust-ed my deep anchors out from the ground to marvel at my pleasing appearance, to soak in my wondrous scent, has thrown me aside like an unwanted weed. Everyday that i was there on the table, i dreampt of my old soft self. Leaving me there to slowly wilt has left me feeling even more vulnerable than when i was taken from me home. Now I've been left to wrought ever so slowly in to the ground. My terminal vanity has caused my inevitable death, but at least I'm home.

besides that .. im crapy i was supposed to see brandon last night.. dont think he called and if he did (the only name on the caller id i didnt know) he called at 9 .. which to me is late .. anyways i told my mom to aanswer the phone .. she cant even do that so it didnt work out 

chris' party was fun we played football and it was cool yeah ... this morning i was supposed to leave at 6:30 am to go fishing but my dad never showed up so he finally called around 9:00 and told me that we might go later .. so im waiting from a phone call from someone so i can do something besides procrastinate my homework today...

"event","Well its 7:23 am and my mom wont take us to school "" you should have thought about that before you missed the bus"" and ""Dont make your problem my problem""
she odesnt even know what the heck shes talking about .. and it drives me nuts... then shell be like sorry girls i was cranky well im not accepting her apology .. if she actually meant it she would change .. she really would but could care less.. shes been going through her midlife crisis ever since she had kids... she wants a life.. well maybe you shouldve had beed such a fucking slut.. yeah thats right.. fuck off 

so now i have to get a doctors excuse cause ive been absent illegaly (without any excuses) 5 times .. so every excuse has to be from a doctor or she has to pay a fine... makes me so mad .. ""we are your problems... we are your kids."" hello are you an idiot... 

i used to have this diary that i wrote down everything my mom did that was iggnorant, rude and ect. i planned on giving it to her wheni moved out or something ... i read it one day.. and wow ... you would not believe the things that were in there .. the things i dont remember .. i ended up throwing it away ... heh go me 

i hope one day when she looks back on her life she sees all the scars she has given us i hope they all show on her skin .. he life is full of counterproductivity... shes holding more people back than helping she never helped me ... except made me strong ... and thats not such a good thing .. from her mistakes i have learned .. but who wants a life full of mistakes.. she has nothing but us .. and she treats us like this .. i know once i leave no one will come here.. katie will move right away with her b/f and then tine will move and im sure as hell not stickin around pfft eff that shell be all alone and realize that everyone who tried to love her she pushes them away everyone she betrays Sam.. her ex .. good guy but her match lol they are both nuts .. but together they worked well .. 
well mom went over his house slept there (when they were broken up and she had a sorta b/f a guy interested) and so he thought everything was cool but hey a chick comes to your house and you prob have sex and what not and then she invites you to dinner at her house and of course you go .. so you show up .. and there the other guy ... well ok patty ... so he called and left nasty messages... what does mom tell us .. that sam just showed up and all that that it was random um ok .. you fucking slut .. 
she seeks love but she makes everyone want to slap her casue shes still a teenager im more matture than her .. ugh im done i dont care... 7:40.... still here... missing my chem test.... which is good cuase then i can get all the answers yay!"

"event","Today started off well.  a couple tests but not too bad... bowker test gay.... Spanish must not be my subject but allwell i dont care anymore 
English test was amazing it was the easiest she could have made it .. i think i got a 100 ! wo0o so i was all happy from that . .then came softball 

Today was the ""B teams"" turn to get their ""fair share"" monday the ""a team"" had their game so i was excited thinking id get my fair share that mr D said that this whole new system was based on so i look at the list and im a sub .. he brouht amanda vasques bobbie monach and shayna sadler from the A team (amanda and bobby play postitions that i also can fullfill) so of course i was pissed.. come on .. its my fucking turn to play and he plays them over me ... he starts them WTF 
so i confronted him in a mature way and he said that manda was the capitain and he needs to get her ready for varsity and then he said that they have been here for the past 2 years ( i was at south park last year (played there their softball team is 10 times better!)) So i brought up the fact that this was bobbies first year here too .. then i told him about how i have done well everytime he put me on the field the only mistakes i have made are striking out twice out of the 5 times i have batted but i had a double and a fly and got no base then i got out with a hit to 3rd... he was gay i cried alot lol 
so i kept score and then left to see my mom cause i needed to she didnt know where i was and i left he got mad and i was like my parents are separated she didnt know where i was and he shut up so after the brutle enings in which penn trafford scored 19 points and us 0 pretty pathetic after only 3 innings so.. i didnt get to play .. we took the mercy rule and stopped playing .. rawr ... so on my day to get my fair share i got nothing... im the only one out of all the girls who hasnt gotten to play in the past 2 days .. me .. and im not bad ... im better than some ... ugh so i confronted him afterwards and asked him to let me play .. and he said that mr dean gave him a list of people that he wants him to play as much as possible and im not on it .. therefore i mean nothing .. um this situation is contradicionary the whole point of us splitted up is to get everyone their ""equal Share"" but really their motives are to get the people they want to play more without more people complaining and to be honest im really offended that im not on the list .. i am just as good as amanda shayna and bobby.. i am and ill boast it .. softball will be the onlything you will ever here me say that i feel confident to say im good at it .. i love softball i have more heart in it then everyone there.. i really do ... i dont goof off liek the other girls i actually pay attention i come to practice and work hard i take it seriously i cheer on my team while the other girls sing songs and talk about other people .. and i sit the bench ... um ok ... another thing he said is that i ahve to proove myself.. uh.. i think i have indeed prooved myself many times... with my double my one awesome catch i didnt even think i caught it and the catch in the outfield .. yeah also on thrid and first i have done nothing wrong i have done everything well everytime the ball came to me every single time i didnt mess up with it not once... so say i have to prove myself when bobby (no offense she had a bad day today) made at least 4 of the 9 errors in the 3 innings that were played.  I think thats prove right there .. this girl o nthe team .. no offense to her either cause i dont know her all to well to say who she realy is struck out 4 times in one game .. she strikes out everygame occasionally she hits it but she gets out well ive had 5 chances to hit ... and i think a double 2 strikeouts a grounder to 3rd and a fly ball behind  1st near right field qualifies me for more palying time than she should be given .. hello .. ? and he tells me i have to prove myslef? kkkkk also he said that he thought i was going to quit cause my dad said so .. if i was going to quit i wouldnt have been at practice yesterday.. i dont think i can take this kind of treatment much longer.. im getting  aggravated and emotionally distraught i think i might quit the one thing that i love .... thats not fair"

Well what can i say ... im backed up in alot of classes... havent had a full english class for about 7 school days, i keep saying stupid things i dont mean like blonde moments or something, failed 2 math tests in a row, 


sofatball

well i dont mean to brag .. but im a pretty darn good softball player... ive played my whole life since i was a wee child and i intend to play forever.  but my coach smokes crack ... he plays people who suck and has favorites he doesnt even know anything about softball and he arrogant and rude.  so today .. its about our 5- 6 game... and he decides to tell us ( after we already did all the fundraisers and put alot of money int othe team) that hes going to split some of us up and have two groups that will alternate playing meanwhile theres about 9 people who will go to every game so the other 10 are slpit into 2 groups and im in one .. so on mon at our game the designated 9 will go and then about 5 that hes going to play meanwhile the other 5 will still be in school or wherever.. not playing ..  then the next game the other five will go .. which makles no sense if your going to try to give everyone playing time you sub the whole team .. 
not the 10 you feel arent as good .. so i was crying .. my dad kicked his ass .. 
verbally of course hes such an awesome dad like for real he stood right up to him and brought up so many good points i was so impressed.. i love him so this does mean that will more than likely get treated even worse than i do now .. which sucks .. 
i put alot of money into the team and hes going to pull this shit ... asshole ... he should have cut at the beginning ... im not a bad played seriously.. im not saying im fantastic im deff not .. but my effort and heart are  more than everyone i dont always hit it .. but i do get alot of good hits... i do .. and this gilr nicole karpinsky struck out 5 times today.. 5 .... i batted 1 and i got a hit and on base... and shes goign to be put as a consistant played.. wow meanwhile i can play each of her possitions better... shes catcher first third and outfield i can be all that and better ... and ill hit the ball occasionally .. its not like she even swings.. she goes half way.. she swings and then stop in the midles of the plate.. shes so gay and she thinks shes fantastic .. casue shes on the spirit team yeah whatever... ugh"

"event","You may not know exactly why we celebrate easter. You may think that it has something to do with bunnies or eggs. But that is not why easter is a holiday. We celebrate easter because a very special man gave his life for everyone of us. No matter who you are this man sufferd tremendously for you.  This mans name is jesus, he took 39 whippings, (40 would have killed any man) just for telling people that he was gods son and the messiah. They moched him and even put a crown of thorns around his head. Imagine having 70 sum thorns getting jammed into your scalp.  Jesus helped the blind see, the crippled walk. and the deff hear. Was he deserving of the fate that we bestowed upon him? We crucified him, every single one of us becasue we sin. His hands and feet were NAILED to the cross. His insides we visible because of all his lashings. He died like that with people gambling over his clothes and some faithfull folowers weeping.  After his death they got to burry him respectfully, on the 3rd day after his death he arose from the gave.  That would be today . That is why we celebrate easter, Becasue Jesus went through so much for us to get to heaven poeple dont even appriciate it or even know about it.

So today instead of singing about peter cotton tail why dont you look in to the TRUE meanign of this blessed holiday. 

and thank Jesus for everything he went through just to have people dissregard and dissrespect him. 


ps happy easter"

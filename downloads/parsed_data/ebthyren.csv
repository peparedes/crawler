"event","I had my first day of school today. It was alright, I guess. I only had two classes, so I was out of there by 12:30, but I didn't get home until four because of ferry issues and having to take the bus and stuff like that.

Classes were okay. I hope this is going to be a better quarter. But I'm approaching this with an unsure attitude. I'm just afraid this is going to be a repeat of all the crazy stress I went through last year. Hopefully not. I'm trying to keep myself both physically and mentally healthy so I don't snap.

I'm also not forming any opinions about school, both because it's only been one day, and I don't want to jinx anything.

Here's my schedule...

Monday:
Chem 237 - Organic Chemistry - 8:30-9:20
ESS 313  - Geobiology        - 11:30-12:20
ESS 313  - Geobiology Lab    - 1:30-3:20

Tuesday:

Please park at CINERAMA and then walk to Pacific Place - it's free parking for our employees there. Make sure to get a parking pass from the manager on duty at CINERAMA that day. Most importantly - HAVE FUN! This is a great priviledge and I am confident you will make the most of it.""

I guess she was wondering when I put in that request that also meant that I couldn't go to the booth seminar, even though I've been looking forward to it and asking about it for the past month and a half. I have to call her back tomorrow and let her know that I can still go to the seminar. Actually, now that I think about it, I probably didn't have to put in that request after all. The managers know that I'll be starting school soon, so they're not scheduling me to work on the weekdays. And they weren't going to schedule me this weekend anyway because I would be in Seattle for the seminar. Oh well, it already got accepted, so the only thing I can do now is call."

"event","I only have nine more days before I have to start school again. For anyone that is curious about what I am doing, I am majoring in biology with a minor in geology. The classes that I am taking this quarter are:

Conservation Biology
Geobiology
Organic Chemistry (first in a three quarter series)

Everyone says that O-chem is much easier than the general chem courses that I took last year and struggled with. I hope so.

I put in a time off request at work so I could have the last week off before I start school. That'll give me time to hang out with friends and get on a sleep schedule so I can stop being so tired. Actually, I started taking a B-complex supplement to help with my energy problem. It's got all the B-vitamins (at like 1000% their daily value) and some vitamin C thrown in for some reason. And it seems to be working. I keep going to sleep at 1 in the morning and waking up at nine, which is a great improvement over waking up at noon and still being tired. I should start taking a multi-vitamin supplement, because I don't eat very healthy.

Since my mind is on school, that reminds me that I saw my old chemistry professor (from OC) the other day at work. The weird thing is he remembered me even though it's been two years since I took his class and it was only for a quarter. He thought I still went to OC though, which would be pretty sad if I was because I started in 2001. When I told my co-worker about it, she said it's not surprising that he remembered me because I have a unique personality. I took it as a complement, but who knows what she meant by it.

I talk about college a lot in my journal. I guess because it's one of the few worthwhile things that I do (besides hanging out with my friends, of course...but very few of them actually read this journal)

So...I'll talk about work. I think my manager is finally going to let me go to the booth training seminar. It's happening this coming saturday, and it's going to be at the AMC theater in Pacific Place in Seattle (or in Tacoma...but most likely in Seattle). Once I finish up the seminar, I'm allowed to run the projectors in the theater, which only a few people are qualified to do. It doesn't sound terribly exciting, but I already know how to do everything at that place already, and I feel like I need to learn something new. It's been so stagnant there for the past year now, and I want to do something exciting. In december, I'll have worked there for two years, which feels like forever to me. I'm planning on only one more year at the place, and then I'll finish my last year at school and look for a job related to what I'm studying at school. I've been thinking about being a research assistant, or if not that, than something to do with ecosystem restoration or wildlife preservation. I was thinking about graduate school before, but now I'm not so sure anymore.

I just realized that this journal entry is incredibly long. I just felt like writing something...I guess. I have a really bad headache too, so I just need to take some ibuprofen (despite the long term harm it can do to your kidneys), and get some rest."

Let's see...well, summer break was semi-awesome. There wasn't really much to do. But I did get to go back to mt. st. helens and see mt. rainier for the first time. I went with Erin and her sister Teel. It happened several weeks ago, but I'll post the pictures I took now.

What happened was I was just laying down on the couch, and the next thing I know I open my eyes and it's 5 in the morning. I was thinking that I had to wake up and get ready for school. But then I fell asleep again and woke up at 10. So I missed school today :( Not cool, but it wasn't really that important to go today. I had a full 11 hours of sleep, so that would explain why I'm not tired. That and I've had two Rock Star energy drinks, which are really good because they taste like liquid sweet tarts. So um...here's news about me.

1. School's almost over for the year. Just about a month and a half to go!
2. I'll have to move out of my place soon :( I'm broke and can't afford it. I hope Bonnie gets a roommate.
3. Car is fixed and it runs like it's brand new. It cost $1,858.10, which my mom had to pay for. I have to start making payments to her. That's one of the reasons I have to move out.
4. I have to take summer classes at OC. It sucks that I have to take extra classes, but I'm glad I'll be back at OC for a quarter.

I'm feeling tired all of sudden. I was just staring at the screen for a few minutes. I might be able to get some sleep tonight after all!"

"event","So I told a bunch of people that my car broke down again, this time probably for good. It really sucks. I was coming back from school, ready to go to my mom's house to get some laundry done and get ready for work. But for some reason my car wouldn't move. I tried to reverse, I tried to drive forward but it wouldn't budge. I told everyone that the transmission was probably broken and since it would be extremely expensive to replace that, my car is done for, and I might as well get used to walking and taking the bus. I was really bummed.

But, it turns out that might not be true after all. On saturday, my brother took me to big lots to see if there was something he could do about it. Well, he found out that it wouldn't reverse but it could still go forward, so at the very least I could drive it back home. Today (actually yesterday since it's 2 in the morning) we came back to big lots to get my car. It drove fine, except I noticed that it wouldn't shift gears, so I was stuck going at a max speed of 40 mph. I had to avoid the freeway. So I know the transmission isn't completely out because at least the car moves. But today I was hopeful that the problem wasn't as serious as I thought it was. And therefore, the repair won't be as expensive as I thought either. I'm hoping that it's just something wrong with the shifter itself, that the transmission is not in the gear that I think I'm setting it to. There's a few things that happened while I was driving that made me think that.

First, when I put it in drive, it wouldn't move. But then I just jiggled the shifter, and my car did a little hiccup and it started moving. When the car wasn't shifting gears while I was driving, I thought maybe that's because it's set to a lower gear, like 3 or L. In that case I don't think it would do any shifting. That made me start thinking that maybe when I set it to reverse, the car was actually still in park. And when I got home, I needed to reverse so I wouldn't block my brothers car that was parked in the drive way. miraculously, my car was able to reverse. So it can still do all the things it could do before, it's just acting weird. So maybe if I send it to get repaired it won't end up being way expensive.

I'm feeling a lot better than I was before and a lot more hopeful. Getting around without a car is just too much of a hassle. I won't have a car for a while though, maybe a few weeks.

These next few days will be a bit hectic for me. Bonnie, I know I was supposed to be over and clean the house. Sorry I wasn't able to make it. Unfortunately, I won't be able to get back home until tuesday. Tomorrow I'll be at school until 8:30, because I have chemistry lab at night. Of course, the buses stop running after nine, so I would have no way to get back. Normally I would leave my car at the ferry terminal and drive back, but I can't do that. So I'll be spending the night at Odegaard library. Instead of catching up on sleep, I get to catch up on homework. YAY! Then I'll go to class as normal, and then make it back tuesday afternoon. This week is going to be crazy, this is the worst time for my car to break down. I hope school will be alright."

Let's see, first on wednesday night/thursday morning, I only got one hour of sleep. I had to wake up really early to take the ferry back to seattle for my final exam. Then I didn't get much sleep the next night because I had to drive to seattle to pick up all my stuff. Getting there was no problem. But getting back was such a nightmare because I was in the middle of rush hour traffic. I left at 3 in the afternoon, and didn't get back until 6. I had to call work and let them know that I would be late. I felt really bad about that, but my manager was really understanding about it, and she blabbed to everyone about it, since everyone at work knew what happened to me before I even got to tell them. Then today I had to wake up early again so I could go back to seattle to finish checking out. I was planning on taking the ferry, but for some reason the bus didn't come when I thought it would so I ended up missing the ferry, so I had to drive there AGAIN. I hate driving in seattle, everyone there drives so insanely. But the good thing is I've finally checked out of the dorm, and I left early so I avoided rush hour. So I got back here really fast. I have to work in about an hour. I'm closing tonight, which I really don't want to do. I'm so tired and my back hurts for some unexplainable reason. I have to work tomorrow also, but then I have four days off. Monday I'll spend bringing in my stuff, which will only take about an hour. All my stuff is still in the car, except for all the expensive stuff like my computer, DVD player and stereo, because I was afraid someone would see those while I was working and break into my car. After I move in, I'll have nothing to do. Finally! I can just sit and watch TV, play games and eat food. It'll be great. I have to find out when school starts again though."

Today I'll be studying for my chemistry final that's on monday. And then my next one is on thursday, and that's my dinosaur class. After that, I have to figure out a way to get all my stuff out of the dorm. Hm...I guess I'm going on a road trip. If only I knew directions on how to drive here I'll be set. I always take the bus so I'm not really paying attention to the path the driver takes. Plus, I'll have to take a different route since I have to get to a parking lot and the bus just drives by the campus. I'll probably ask erin to help me out with this. She knows how to get here by car.

I still have a MILLION exposures left on this camera. Haha, not really, but I still have a lot, so I need to go out and take more pictures. So far I've taken a bunch of pictures of cherry blossoms, two pictures of mt. rainier with drumheller fountain in the foreground, some pictures of ducks and geese, a rhododendron (like we don't see those everywhere), and a squirrel that was looking straight at me when I took the picture. I don't know if the squirrel will come out though, because I was far away when I took it, so it might just look like a dot. I plan on taking pictures of the dorm, so everyone can see what it looked like, and then just some random pictures around campus.

Anyway, I'm starting to get bored and I've only been awake for an hour, lol. I think I'll go for a walk soon and maybe get something to eat before I start studying."

I still have a lot of exposures left, so I'm just going to take other pictures around the campus. I'll post them on here as soon as I get them developed, and find some way to get it on my computer. I think most places give you a CD with the pictures on them too when you get them developed. That would be cool, then I wouldn't have to scan them.

I slept so much today. I went to bed around midnight last night, and I didn't get up until 11:30 this morning. Yup, that's a lot of sleep. The funny thing is I'm still tired, lol. I'm probably just exhausted because I've been studying a lot the past few hours. My final for calculus is tomorrow and I'm trying so hard to understand everything before then. I want to do really well on it, but I'm not too worried about the final. I was talking to my resident advisor about it, and she thinks that math teachers rarely fail anybody. That's because she said she took math 124, and said she did really bad on it, and didn't understand anything, and they still gave her a 2.3 or so. I think that's why they do the whole gaussian curve business. They want people to pass the class so they can move on, but they also want to weed out the average people, so that the real geniuses are distinguished. Oh well, as long as I pass it I'm good. After this class I'll never have to take math again (hopefully). And if I don't pass it, then I'll just take it at OC during the summer. I bet it'll be a lot easier over there.

Hmm...nothing else noteworthy going on. Wish me luck on my finals everyone! And hooray for spring break, which is coming up soon!"

Since I only had 27 cents before, that means 255 dollars was basically the amount of my paycheck. Which is really good considering I only work on the weekends.

"event","The house that Bonnie and I have is haunted, I swear. There were three bizarre things that happened that have me convinced. First of all, we were just talking and I was half-watching TV, when suddenly one of her guitars plays a single note. We both looked at it and we were so confused. Secondly, Bonnie was doing stuff on the internet, and she signed onto msn messenger and set it to appear offline. Suddenly, someone talks to her and she looks at the status and it changed to online. Lastly, before I went to sleep I turned on my cell phone so I could use it as an alarm and the battery was fully charged. When I woke up in the morning, the battery was almost dead. If you don't use your cell phone for talking and just leave it on, it doesn't drain the battery that much. That's why it's so bizarre. Bonnie says the same thing happens to her phone. My brother might have a reasonable explanation for that however. He said it's possible that the phones switch to analog roaming, and that wastes a lot more energy. That's possible, since we get crappy reception at the house. It probably switched to roaming when I was sleeping and it drained the battery. Hm...if that's true that I'll have to keep my phone off whenever I'm there.

Well, now my battery is dead. And my charger is at the dorm cuz I usually don't need it over the weekend. I don't know if erin ever called me back. We were supposed to see Be Cool, but I'm feeling too tired and sick to go out. I was supposed to be off at 6, but my manager asked if I could stay and of course I said yes. So yeah, I just got back. I was going to call erin, but I don't know her number. I never bothered to memorize it because it's on my cell phone. I hope she understands that I couldn't call her back. Anyways, I guess I'm not going to the house tonight. I am way too tired, I'm probably just going to eat dinner and then go to sleep. I have to be up early anyway so I can go to work."

"event","I am so sick today. I woke up with a bad cold, and I had to hang out with erin today, so I got some advil cold and sinus to help me out. It worked for the fever, but I was still sniffing a lot. We went to the international district, which was an interesting place. We went to this one place where I got watermelon juice. It was really good, except they put little balls of tapioca in it, which I thought was disgusting because everytime i tried to sip some juice i got a ball of tapioca, which i found tasteless. Then we went to the seattle art museum. we were going to wait for stephanie and go do that art walk thing again, but she missed the ferry and wouldn't be in till later. So we decided to head on out because i was feeling so horrible and erin was tired. Before we left, we went to lusty ladies, which was right across the street from the museum. we thought it was a strip joint and erin wanted to do a price check for admission to see if she could bring marcus there for his birthday. well, turns out it wasn't a strip joint after all. apparently, it's free to enter, and in that place, there's a bunch of booths that a person can go in and watch videos of naked girls. i'm pretty sure those booths are for guys to masturbate in, because the rule was only one person per booth, and they had tissue dispensers, obviously so you can...uh...clean up after yourself. it was weird and i was embarrassed being in there.

so we saw stephanie get off the later ferry, but we didn't feel like hanging out, we were both pretty tired. so erin took me home. i felt bad because i couldn't go over to the house today. i sent bonnie a text message that i was feeling sick and wouldn't be able to make it. but i wouldn't have been much entertainment anyway. i would just be spacing out and half asleep and i wouldn't have been able to eat anything. i have no appetite at all and have to force myself to eat something so i can feel better. I hope I feel better tomorrow, I want to eat lots of food. Besides, I have work tomorrow, at 6. Bonnie, I'm really sorry about this! I'll be over tomorrow!

I was watching scenes from Harold and Kumar. I had forgotten how funny that movie was. I seriously have to get it on DVD once I have enough money. I was watching a scene where Kumar sees a huge bag of marijuana and he starts fantasizing that he's dating it, and then he marries it. And then he's working late at night and the bag brings him some coffee. When he drinks it he spits it out and slaps the bag and says ""Bitch! Learn how to fucking make coffee!"" and then the bag is crying and he says ""I'm sorry. I love you!"" LOL that's my favorite scene in the whole movie.

"event","In my last post I said I didn't have any homework to do and I was so bored. Well, turns out that wasn't true after all. It was around 11:30 at night and I was thinking about chemistry class and when my next lab would be. Usually, when it's the week of a lab, then they put a pre-lab assignment on webassign that you have to do (chemistry classes always do their homework online). I checked webassign and there wasn't any pre-lab, so I figured there wasn't a lab this week. Then I was thinking about it some more and I realized that next week can't be a lab because it's the last week of class. If we did the lab the last week of class, then there would be no way for us to turn in our post lab report. So I checked online for the lab dates, and it turned out that today is my last lab. The problem with that is the post lab report from the previous lab is due the day of the next lab, and I didn't even start my post lab report from the previous lab. So, I had to go to Odegaard library in the middle of the night and I was up until 3 am finishing the lab report. The reason there wasn't a pre-lab report on webassign is because we had to do the report on paper and hand it in during lab. I don't know why they did that, and why they didn't give us any reminders. I couldn't do the pre-lab report because I needed to check out a CD-ROM and do the assignment on a chemistry study center computer, which of course is closed in the middle of the night. I explained it to my TA and he just laughed and made fun of me. He's a cool guy, at least I didn't get yelled at.

The lab was fun, but I was being dumb the whole time. One of the hot plates was still plugged in and I accidentally touched it. I burned myself and when I moved my hand back in shock, I spilled a bunch of chemicals that was in a beaker that I was holding. So we had to start the experiment all over. My lab partner made the mixture again and set it aside to do something else. But I thought that the beaker was filled with waste chemicals so I dumped it down the drain. I felt so stupid when she told me what I did. So we had to start over twice. We still got done early though, because the lab was really short, but we were one of the last groups to leave.

So anyway, tomorrow I'm heading back towards Bremerton, but it won't be until later that night. I guess erin wants me and a bunch of our friends to go to chinatown. It sounds like a fun idea. Then I'll go to the house and stuff myself with the enormous amount of food that bonnie has, lol. Seriously though, it's a ton of food."

"event","After this week, there's only one more week of class left. And then the week after is finals and then I'm on spring break! Woo hoo! I am so ready to get this quarter over. These classes have been so hard, and I just hope I can get them over with and move on to better things. I'm thinking about taking classes at OC during the summer, but I don't know if I'm allowed to do that seeing as I've matriculated at the university. But I'll talk to my advisor about it. That would be cool if I could do that. I miss going to OC, it was such a cool college.

I'll also be moving into the house soon also. We had a housewarming party before, but I think we should have another one to celebrate me moving in, lol. We'll have a kick ass party during spring break and I'll get uber drunk for the entertainment of anyone who wants to come. Speaking of that, I've got to get some of those jack daniels truffles. Those were so good!

I haven't had that great of a day so far. I got both my math and chemistry midterms back today. I did okay on my math midterm. The score I got was the exact average of the class, which is okay, I guess. The chemistry midterm I didn't do too well on. But from what I've heard, a lot of people didn't do good. I was trying to peek at people's scores so I could see how everyone else did, but the ones who had their midterms out in the open had really good scores, so it just made me feel worse. I couldn't look at the ones that did bad, because obviously they were hiding it.

I need to find something to do. I'm so bored right now. I'm done with classes today, there's no homework to do, so I'm just sitting around doing nothing. Well, I'm reading about dinosaurs, so I'm not really doing nothing. But yeah, I need something fun to do."

"event","I'm so tired...literally. I took a short break from studying for my chemistry midterm (which is today) so I could write something on this journal. I was staring at the screen for a few minutes, my mind completely blank. I really want to get some sleep, but there's only two hours before my chemistry class and my midterm, and I know if I do I'll sleep past the alarm and miss it. Oh well...I can always sleep afterwards. I'm so tired because I had to wake up uber early to catch a a ferry back to seattle. I slept on the ferry without realizing it though, lol. I closed my eyes and when I opened them again, over 40 minutes had passed. That was good though, the time went by so quickly. 

Things I'm dreading
1. Chemistry midterm tonight
2. I got my graded math midterm and chemistry midterm back tomorrow
3. I probably have to do some math studying later tonight. Because if this is anything like what happened last midterm, then there's going to be a quiz in my math class tomorrow, despite the fact we had a test on thursday. If anyone remembers, I made a post about that a while ago. If you don't remember, or need a refresher, then click on the link.
<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/ebthyren/15196.html"">Stupid whiny college crap</a>

Things I'm looking forward to
1. Dinosaur class tomorrow
2. The quarter is almost over
3. After today, the only big tests left are the finals
4. I'll be moving out of the dorm soon
5. Spring break
6. New classes
7. 24 is on today

So what I'm looking forward to outweighs what I'm dreading. I was thinking about something earlier today. How am I going to get all my stuff out of the dorm? The logistics of it are nightmarish. I could probably do it myself, but for the fact that I'm afraid that my car wouldn't be able to make a trip that far, and I hate driving in seattle. If I have to, I will though. But I'll worry about that when that time approaches.

I didn't go to class on monday because it was president's day, and I skipped class on tuesday (which I shouldn't have done). I had my math midterm today, and I'm pretty sure that I did not do well on it. But this is different from my first midterm. Usually I tell people that I don't care about doing bad on a test when in fact I do, but this time I really don't care. It's weird, I don't know why I'm not caring. But it's not a big deal, as long as I pass the class then I'll never have to take it again.

Anyway, I also registered for classes today. Here's what classes I'm taking for spring quarter:

Biol 180 - Intro to Biology - M-F 11:30 am-12:20 pm
           Biology lab - T   8:30 am-11:20 am
Chem 162 - General Chemistry - M-Th 4:30 pm-5:20 pm
           Chemistry quiz section - F 12:30 pm-1:20 pm
           Chemistry lab - M 5:30 pm-8:20 pm
Engl 225 - Shakespeare - M-Th 1:30-2:20

The classes that I wanted to take were either full or I didn't meet the requirements, so I decided to take a shakespeare class to get credits for my writing course requirement. This is going to be a somewhat light schedule compared to the other quarters. And what's great about it is that most of the classes are in the afternoon/evening, so commuting won't be that much of a problem. 

Well, yeah. Still bored. I guess I'll just watch TV until I have to go to class."

Alright, I'll stop picking on a certain someone. But before I do, I have something to say:

Sanctimonious - feigning piety or righteousness.
So everytime she uses it she's using it in the wrong context. HAHA! and tweaking means doing drugs. But anyway, I'll stop before it gets old.

News: Bonnie seems to enjoy living in the new house. I can't wait until I move in there too. Judd went to see it the other day and eventually warmed up to it. He said the outside was ugly, but the inside was really nice. I'd have to agree. In fact, everyone I know that's seen the pictures say the outside is ugly but the inside is alright.

Christina might be going to the University of Phoenix. Actually, it's online courses, but it would still be pretty good. Good luck with online classes...I know you'll make a great dental assistant. I mean...dental hygienist. If you need help with homework, don't forget to give me a hollar!

Anyway, more about me. I haven't written in my journal for a while because I was feeling blue. But that always happens when I'm coming back to the dorm. It's just cuz I hate coming back here. But I've started to feel better since we've had a bunch of sunny days in a row. I might have SAD (seasonal affective disorder), but I doubt it, since short days and long nights never seemed to bother me before. It's probably just all the stress that I've had to go through. The quarter is almost over, which has gone by really fast. I have to talk to a counselor about changing my major to biology, and then i have to decide what classes I'm going to take next quarter, although I'm pretty sure I already know what I'm taking. Anyway, that's what's been going on with me. I've got to get some food and do some studying. Hollar back all! Haha!

"event","Well, it turns out that erin and i went to hang out with stephanie after all. she called at the last minute and said she was going over to seattle, so we agreed to meet her at the ferry dock. It was cool seeing her again. I also got to meet her boyfriend, who is freakishly tall, and two of her friends, who I'm guessing didn't know each other since they didn't really talk to each other. And the guy was asking her questions like how old she was, blah blah blah. 

Anyway, at first we went to the Seattle Art Museum. There were these two ladies singing and a guy playing the alto sax (yeah!) and everyone was clapping along with the music. It was fun to listen. Then we went up to actually look at the art. Oh my god, some of it was really good, but a lot of it was so stupid. me and erin were making fun of them, but we had to do it when stephanie wasn't around or else she would get mad. we asked her why some of it was so popular, and she just said ""you have to think about the time period that some of these works were created."" she's a real art expert, so she knows more about this than I do. But some of them were just so bad you could do nothing but laugh at them. Like there was this one that was just a piece of yellow construction paper with a black line on it under glass. I mean, what is that?! That's art?! The other one that I was laughing at was just a canvas with white paint on it. So let's think about this...the canvas is white, and the artist decided to splash white paint on it and call it art? It really just looked like he took a bucket of paint and threw it at the canvas and said ""there we go, that's my art."" I mean, there are people who work really hard to create beautiful paintings and it just irks me when someone does something so simplistic and they get the same amount of respect and recognition as that other artist.

After that we went to art walk. every first thursday of the month in pioneer square, they have all these art galleries that are open for everyone to see. It was so much fun hopping from one gallery to the next. A lot of them had open bars, too. It was too cool cuz you just go up to the person, ask for a drink, and then they give it to you, no questions asked. They didn't charge us, they didn't even card us, which they should've because I know stephanie is underage, lol. I just went up to this one girl serving wine, and I said ""Can I get red wine, please?"" and she pours me a glass. How cool is that? Red wine is actually pretty good. But afterwards I was feeling kind of dizzy, lol. Actually, we all were, despite the fact that we all had only one glass of wine. They must have added extra alcohol or something, haha. Just kidding. wine has a good amount of alcohol in it already. This other place was kind of like an art and clothing store. The clothes they had there was pretty cool. If I had money, I would have bought something there. That place was just giving people free beer. It was crazy, and they had couches and a tv so I could sit down while everyone else looked at art and junk. I looked too, but my back was starting to hurt so I needed to sit down from time to time. Then we went to this other place where some of the artists actually lived in their studios, which I think is pretty cool. erin was laughing cuz she saw a transvestite. There was a show going on in one of the studios too, but we only caught the last part of it. All I saw was this girl in a black dress who kept touching her boobs and squishing them together while she was asking people trivia questions. It was hilarious. I wish I had seen the whole show. But yeah, there was a lot of art stuff that we looked at. There was some that I really liked, some I didn't like, and some that I didn't like at first but then stephanie explained what the artist was trying to do and then I saw it and liked it. The whole experience was a real culture shock, but for some reason I felt very comfortable being around there. So yeah, it's definitely something I want to do again. Maybe I can go back next month with a few other people...?

Anyway, came back to the campus. I had an urge for ice cream, so I went to ian's, which is this convenience store in the basement of mccarty hall, which is one of the dorm halls. but the line was so long that i decided against it. So I came back to my room, very exhausted from all the walking that I did. Talked to christina on the phone for a little bit, but she had to go. but before she left i noticed there was a spider building a web (i was outside on the balcony), so when she got off the phone i spent a lot of time watching it build the web. I know, it's a waste of time, but it was so cool watching it. It's amazing to see a spider do something like that. I think it's still building it right now. last time i checked, it was just starting the orb part of the web. i think i'll go check and see if it's done before i go to sleep. Wow, I wrote a lot. I think I'll just leave it at that for now."

"event","Just got done with my dinosaur midterm. I think I did good on it, but I don't want to jinx it. ;) It was all multiple choice and true or false questions, so it was easy. They won't give us the tests back, for some reason, so when they're done grading it they're going to post it online so we can check it out. I hope they grade them soon! I know there's 700 people in the class, but we were using scantrons. Come on, they're not even grading it, a machine is, so it shouldn't take long.

On another note, I guess bonnie and i have sort of got the house. apparently her parents have to sign for us because we don't have any renters history. But as soon as we move in we will. good grief...i can't believe we're all finally growing up. it makes me sad sometimes.

Bergan called me today and asked if I could fill in for him on saturday (which was supposed to be my day off). Great. I just can't say no to people though, so I said I would do it. I could use more hours anyway. But it's an 8 hour and 15 minute shift in concession (shudders). I hate working in concession nowadays because everyone there is so damn lazy. They never stock anything, and when we're supposed to be getting ready for the next rush of people, they're leaning over the counter talking to people. And then when I confront them about it, they just say ""Well, I can't get anything done if people keep coming in my line."" And I look around and there's nobody in line, but what I do see is them talking to the ushers, when they should be doing a lot of other stuff that needs to be done. Oh well, I told bergan I would do it on the condition that I'm taking his role as supervisor for the day. he said ""sure. you can have my shirt."" since supervisors wear blue shirts and the regular film crew wear red. he thinks i'm joking, but i'm going to be bossing everyone around, lol. if anyone asks me i'll say ""bergan wanted me to fill in for him. he's a supervisor. therefore, i'm filling in as supervisor."" haha, it'll be fun.

I think I'm going to the burke museum later today. I'm not sure, I have to wait for a call before I'm positive on that. I guess I'm not hanging out with stephanie after all, since she never called back. The burke museum has all these cool fossils that I want to look at. Wouldn't it be cool if I got into something like paleontology or paleobiology? I know what you're all thinking...""Okay, ross."" right? Well, the people who watch Friends are probably thinking that. It would be cool though. Then I could get my Ph.D. and then write a paleontology text book for undergraduates and then live off of royalties for the rest of my life. Haha, life would be good. Hey, I can always dream.

Anyway, I'll write more later. Jerry Springer is almost on. Hooray for trash tv!"

"event","Well, I'm through stressing over my grades on my midterms. What's done is done, right? The only thing I can do now is study very hard for the next midterms and the finals. If I do well on those, then my grades should still be pretty good. So now it's just back to the normal uneventful stress of homework and quizzes. Oh yeah, I have my dinosaur midterm tomorrow. But I'm not too worried about it. 

I think later tomorrow night I'm going to be hanging out with erin and stephanie. I think they're going to some art museum and erin invited me to go along, as something to help relieve my stress. Stephanie used to work at AMC, before everyone there became a whore, lol. I'm just kidding...not everyone there is a whore, just a lot of them. She quit because they weren't giving her enough hours so she didn't have the money to pay for her bills. She works at wherehouse music now, and she says it's a much better place to work. So yeah, that's pretty cool. I haven't seen her in forever.

I wonder if Bonnie heard anything about the house yet? I was thinking about all the work that we would have to do to make it a home that I would be proud to live in. It's a lot of work, but it would be work that I would be happy to do. I was also wondering if someday we could work on an addition to the house, like maybe another room? That would be cool. And it would raise the value of the house. $_$ oops, i mean -_- I feel tired, lol.

I really am tired though. I wish there was something I could do to give me more energy. Well, exercise is an option, but yeah...I don't want to do that, lol. Maybe I should though, I have a little buddha belly forming, haha. I'm preggers!

I have chemistry class in one hour. BOO!!! But we're learning about electrochemistry right now, which is really interesting. We're learning how batteries work. YEAH! Good lord, I'm a nerd. =)"

Since the class is curved around the mean, then I should be in good shape. I think the departmental guideline is to make the average a 2.7, which is why I got that grade last quarter in chemistry. So, if I stay ""average"" then that's what I should get this quarter too. I'm not happy about that, but it's a decent grade."

Christina's most recent post on her live journal:

It took me forever to update. Good lord, my live journal must have been tweakin;! lol HAHA Oh damn I am too funny. So yeah hey who is this ok?! Think... desert & foot... HAHA whats in the desert, and what is on a foot...lol haha. So yeah I just found out my Best friend Thyren... wait that's right there are people who knew him longer, so there for he isn't my best friend but theirs.... anyways Thyren is pimpin' at AMC... He has Bergan, Daniel, Andy, and his #1 Hottie... Marcus lol Yup and the odd thing is... well it isn't that surprising, but the odd thing is I think his #1 hottie is fo realz. As in... His #1 Hottie wants to bend him over and plug him up good... haha I am nasty I know. And well lets see. The number ""2"" is the black mans favorite number... And they like chicken ""fingers""... doesn't that wanna make you just tweak out? lol HAHA hey thyren are you getting all of this. Thyren is such an awesome guy... he isn't fully asian so he can only hover, but that is still pretty cool. haha well i am done for now... so i'll be back...

Stuff she's referring to:

""Good lord, my live journal must have been tweakin!""
She's talking about erin. whenever she's upset about something, she says she's tweaking out. But that means she's doing drugs. She means to say that she's freaking out. lol

""Think...desert & foot...HAHA what's in a desert, and what is on a foot...lol haha.""
She told me one time Lydia was wearing these really tight jeans, and she was like ""It was so gross, I could see her camel toe."" I almost died laughing when I heard that. Of course, she's referring to Lydia's vagina. Gross!

""So yeah I just found out my Best friend Thyren... wait that's right there are people who knew him longer, so there for he isn't my best friend but theirs....""
One time she was talking to Lydia and she said me and her were like best friends. Lydia got so mad when she said that. Lydia was like ""No! You two can't be best friends. I've known him longer than you."" Christina even said she was crying...I think. Good God.

""anyways Thyren is pimpin' at AMC... He has Bergan, Daniel, Andy, and his #1 Hottie... Marcus lol Yup and the odd thing is... well it isn't that surprising, but the odd thing is I think his #1 hottie is fo realz.""
Every guy at the theater acts so gay, I swear. But her and I both think that marcus might actually be gay, and that he really wants me, for various reasons. I'm sure Daniel isn't gay, because he's going out with Christina. Bergan and Andy are still question marks.

""The number ""2"" is the black mans favorite number... And they like chicken ""fingers""... doesn't that wanna make you just tweak out?""
I think she's talking about erin again, since she has 2 and fingers in quotation marks. ""2 fingers"" lol I'm not going to get into detail about that. And she's also referring to erin's misuse of the word tweak.

""HAHA hey thyren are you getting all of this. Thyren is such an awesome guy... he isn't fully asian so he can only hover, but that is still pretty cool.""
In movies like ""crouching tiger, hidden dragon"" and ""hero"" they're always flying around like they have special powers, but they don't. So we have the stereotype that all asians are able to fly.

HAHA. So many jokes in one paragraph. It's hilarious.

"event","Today has to be one of the worse days I've had at school so far. Well, for one, I had to go to my math class today, and I was really excited about getting my midterm back. As it is, the midterm that I thought I did really well on turned out that I actually failed. Yup...my score was a 29 out of 50, which is easy to figure out the percentage because you just double your score. So my grade was a 58 percent. Wow, how stupid can I be? Then, the TA said we had to turn in our homework assignment today, which I didn't even know we had a homework assignment to turn in. I had thought that since we had a midterm on thursday, they would give us a break, but I guess I was wrong. So I couldn't turn in the homework cuz I didn't have it. And then, to make it even worse, we had a quiz on the homework! What the fuck is that?! Why would they make so much happen so soon after a huge test? So yeah, I couldn't do the quiz because I didn't do the homework. I was just sitting there, writing no nonsense crap on the quiz paper trying to make it look like I was doing something. Then when the bell rang, I put the quiz in my bag and walked out of class. I was so embarrassed. I was going to complain to erin, because we both did bad on our exams, but it turns out that she was so upset that she did horrible on her test that she went home and she skipped class today, so I didn't meet her today. We usually meet up before our dinosaur class at 12:30. Anyway, I didn't want to go to dinosaur class since I was going to be alone there, so I just skipped, and went up to my room with food, sulking. I have my chemistry class at 2:30. We MIGHT get our chemistry midterms back today too. If we do, then this day will be even worse.

I won't whine anymore. I'm going to study harder than ever before so I can do much better on the next set of midterms. If I do really good on the next midterms and finals, then I should get decent grades in my classes."

It'll be great especially when my roommate wants to watch boring sports news, and I want to watch trashy talk shows at the same time. It gets a fair number of channels with somewhat good reception.

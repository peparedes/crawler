"event","Made my downpayment on my wolf cub...dog got in a fight with the  neighbor's and I washed the car and cleaned the ferret cage out. Doing  pretty well except I'm missing  someone miserably..I was hoping he'd be on so I could  talk to him, tell him some things but he's  busy...he's out to dinner with a friend. And I'm happy for him, I am..I'm not jealous but I am saddened..very saddened because the selfish part of me wishes I were there instead. Silly and  selfish but the Human heart is usally that..even when it's part wolf.


Finally got  Joy's  present   today..i just need to get the other half and mail it. Hopefully  Jas got his  present or it's  going to be  late like Joys >_<


I need to finish  cleaning off the weedeater  and take it  back. Then I may  try out  my rollerblades again, see if I've gotten rusty. gaia willing I won't break any bones ~_^ I haven't  yet but you never know.(weak smile) I'll try to cheer up..just sad right now"

"event","I am admittedly an odd  sort of girl. I actually have my wedding dress now. Got it  at a garage  sale of all places but  eh, you never know, I might get to use it someday. 

I'm halfway through the Silverfang part of the tribe  novels..only have Glasswalkers, Black Spirals and  Wendigo to  go. It's really picking up a lot but I'm interested in moving on to another  series by now  despite the insight into Jonas  Albrecht's character. On the good side they did  give Memphi Faster  Than Death more spotlight time. Actually the Spirals  are  most interesting..in a rather ill way.

My left lower wisdom tooth  just broke  skin in a new place so it's really raw..hurt's like  Hell.

Family  problems are as  always like  storm clouds over head raining on any particular  bit of joy  but I won't go into those for now.

My wolf  pup, which will be a white one, is already wobbling around I hear  even though his or her eyes aren't open yet. I wanted  a male but I may get a  female. I have a few names in mind: Xavier, Weyekin, Cheyenne, Cherokee, Lakota.

All for  now  basically...not to  self..i need to make  pictures for this account"

"event","I don't really enjoy  feeling  worthless..I guess it's silly but I had my mind set on  joining some  section of the military..Marines, Air Force, Navy, Army, National Guard, Coast Guard,  something...and it  always come down to this. They ask the fatal  question and the second I admit that I have a medical condition  they always promise to call back but they never do. i may as well have leukimia or  cancer or leperacy  the  way they  ract. I have it under control, I can handle the strain, I just want to move on with my life. If they don't want me they  could at least have the courtsey to call back and say so...bugger it."

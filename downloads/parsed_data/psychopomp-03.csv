"event","every few years i write a song in standard tuning. that time has arrived again (007 + Ours + matt good-weapon). then i though to myself, you know what i else i&nbsp; haven't done in years? (or what feels like) Livejournal.

so here i am.

I know i always say recording soon....and never show anything....but this time i have a reason.
I was gonna start a while ago but in doing research plus Humbers recording engineer giving me a few private lessons, I found my recording equipment was junk and it was surprising i got as far as i did with it.
So i spent months more doing research of what to get and spent $5000 (college money) or so a laptop setup. Still waiting on protools 8 to be shipped to me though. crazy backorders since its january release. 
im going to Fanshawe in the fall for all this recording stuff so its good to get familier with the industrys tools now.
so, once that ariives ill be up and at it again. meanwhile ive still been writing but not recording.


I hope you guys are doing well. not sure who comes back to pickering at all but if you do we should catch up.
Things are getting pretty lame around here recently. Friendships that once were stong have been wavering of late. I really actually Want to go to school and get gone. and i mean classes school, not frat party school.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although..."

I just saw the most hilarious commercial. it was people camping in a forest fire, a guy washing his car when the streets were flooded, a people walking there dog in a hurricane...then it said ignoring global warming wont stop it. ... .... they do know that the verdict on IF global warming actually existes is still out and let alone that it will cause all this disaster which it wouldnt. nobody ever mention the positives about it either. (less driving accidents during winter for one) <br /><br />what they SHOULD do, is actually let the science be shown. Countless of scientests including my uncle say its phooey. i dont know if your aware but what the liberal media does is if a study doesnt support there view they wont print it. and thats not saying the stuff they fabricate and fuss about. <br />- there is no proof second hand smoke has any effect. <br />- did you know all the same people who fuss about global warming were fussing about global cooling just in the 70's? <br />- who said global warming is man made? ever heard of the ice age? when we were coverd in a mile of ice? climates change&nbsp;<br /><br />god damn i hate those misguided hippies. <br /><br />see, the non burnt out non retarded hippies want what? personal freedom, to stick it to the man. right? <br />the man = government = laws. <br />what that means is they (and I, and should us all) want is less government interferance in our day to day lives. this boils down to the right to choice. <br />many commom issues now are about taking away freedom. sadly, though they think they are helping people they are just relincwishing our personal freedoms. <br /><br />- do parents not know what is best for there own kid then some government official? <br />- should a business not have the right to decide what they pay employees? (if you dont like it then quit) <br />- should a church or other private group who doesnt accept gays because of there beliefs be forced to accept them? <br />- should a persons sexual orientation or race give someone a job over a more qualified person? <br />- same with it for not getting them a job. <br /><br />as you can imagine there a many many more i could say. give me a topic and i'll say what i think if you wish. <br /><br />so whats the deal with all these people who think they know whats better for me then i do? <br /><br />ok, im kind of getting suckered in by hockey but a few other points i wanted to get of my chest were: <br />- left side = more government/more laws/less freedom <br />- right side = less government <br />- to the notion that poor people are better, or have more charecter; who do you think gives to charities? are the well off the ones stealing and breaking into houeses? and whats the poverty like here anyway? over 95% of canadians have a car, a tv, a computer, food, clothes, a house and anything regarded as essential. what about when my grandma had to drop out of school at grade 7 to work in a factory just so the family had food. and she wore plastic bags on her feet as shoes. I have no problem with giving to the poor though, we do. i just dont like when its taken from me instead. <br />- NAZI stands for national socialst party of germany. that is on the left. please dont group them with the wrong side. <br />- Trudeau sucked ass. you know he made that giant debt were paying? and that he refused the bill that would have allowed us to own our property so things like that pickering airport incident where they just took peoples homes wouldnt be possible? he sure is my hero. <br />- Unions are in general, shit. www.freethelivelyseven.org <br />-Universites used to teach you how to think. Now its what to think. were you aware in i believe it was ryerson that a student brought in a toronto sun paper with him a the prof blew up and threw him out of class because he didnt buy the star? he sure had freedom didnt he. <br />- I hate that new Hannah girl on much music. I hated the old one too. She got angry at leonardo dicaprio for financially adopting a kid! i dont see her doing bugger all so a big routen touten FUCK YOU! to her. he does something good and gets ragged on. and im sure if he did take her away with him they'd a;; make a fuss like they did madonna. <br /></div><br />anyways, i could go on but im sure you've quite had enough. its nothing against the people here (other than that hannah girl and that prof). I have no doubts that they arnt nice people or anything like that. just to be clear. <br /><br />if you have any interst in these topics i suggest the western standard. <br /><br />"

I have 299 cds now (only full artist albums, no compilations or soundtracks). looking forward to getting the 300th.

the band is going great, despite our loss at a battle of the bands to a band who couldnt tune their guitars but brought all there mommies and daddies to vote for them. How bands with 0 talent but sold x number of tickets can move on over our band who is in honest to god better than many signed bands. that being said, were really working on our career. we go into the studio early into the new year to record a professional demo. a new site should be up in the near future.  

www.stepfunction.ca  

Dec 7th we play ep taylors as a headliner. i know that will be a good show. were going to play some new material that will blow them away.I dont know it it'll be ready by then but the band is getting a 6 ft x 6 ft drop cloth for behind us.

I have a new car since my corolla died. im not going to tell you what it is. your gonna have to see for yourselves.

so friday im driving into pickering and the transmission of the corrola goes. i was stuck going home in first gear which is 40kmh. then today im heading into band in  the impala and the same fucking thing happens. it dropped so i could go 90kmh max. so now its 1 car for 4 of us at the moment.
in other news i've taken to smoking pot daily for the past3 weeks maybe so far. im high now. i got a nice new pipe with 3 bowls and its got a nice case thats all purple velvet inside. all 4 of my little ones broke. I really feel like getting really drunk at a party. i havent been drunk in a long time, just kinda tipsy when i've drank.

BAND
the 26th stepfunction had a show at ep taylors which is the durham college pub and we fucking killed that place. it was adams debut and our first time whipping out some new material and all went well. we didnt really bring many people and the whole place was up at the stage going crazy. we got called for an encore! the headliners were pissed that they had to follow us. hehehe,  it was a halloween show so i put on those rediculously tight glittery star pants that belonged to steph. there are pics somewhere. 
the demo is being played on the durham college radio station i believe and were talking about being the headliners for a pantera/dimebag tribute show there.  
we just entered a internation battle of the bands too. we have our first heat in november. its a thing where half the bands go on until its international. who knows, if we keep winning we can be playing a huge festival in germany...if we win. the give away prizes at the shows for best guitarest and drummer so we have a good chance there.  the prizes are as much as a new guitar or new drum kit depending on which show # it is.

Roy craig, julians dad and the band are in talks of him being our manager. and not in a hes a parent way. were talking contracts and him fronting money like $3000 so we can record at a professional studio and get a press kit togather. hire photographers, write bios, get us press and gigs, all the good stuff.


FENILON FALLS
this was a weird series of events. it was supposed to be on the saturday but last minute on the thursday before the town shut the show down for all this stupid shit so the show was moved to bobcaygon on the sunday. warren was on the news at 6 and 11, 3rd story in and his segment was 3 minutes long. his story was in the papers and apparently it even got picked up on the radio in fredricton! but alas nobody came. now warren is in debt id bet a good $5000 to erics (40 year old drummer guys) mother. 

works good, when im there. i have 3 students...total of an hour and a half a week. but 2 of them at least are wanting to learn and a freshly new to music.

"event","So many of you have been asking who Chris Perneroski is, so here is his story; Chris Perneroski's dream was to race professionally for the Canadian Motor Cross but unfortunately, he suffered a tragic accident before this was possible. Not only does Chris need special attention to help him with everyday activities but also depends on a liquid diet that is given intravenously. Chris's cognitive functioning is very limited, as he has suffered both primary and secondary brain damage from a very traumatic impact to the head. The end result left him unable to speak, immobile, only to move with help and is dependant on a wheelchair, leaving him with a limited quality of life. We at The Everyday Musician believe it is our party to give back and so we are raising funds to help with the huge cost of renovating the house and amenities that are required, so that Chris may lead a comfortable life.

I went to the virgin festival both saturday and sunday. Saturday i went with&nbsp; amber and melissa and had a decent time. buck 65 signed our ball which i got to kep and i Caught zig zags from Illscarlet which i got signed too. melissa got the tip of her penis lighter singed by them as well.&nbsp; 
Sunday i went alone and had a better time though.&nbsp;I&nbsp;just met people there.&nbsp;The strokes were actually really fun. probably the most fun band of the weekend. wolfmother was pretty awesome too. i liked there music best.&nbsp; the raconteurs were fun...though i didnt get to see them. i could hear them from where i was though. (lol, sue ellen ) I didnt get to listen to&nbsp; broken social scene&nbsp; because i was off checking out the moony suzuki and trying pursuade the security to let me back over a bridge so i could find my necklace. It was right where i thought it had fallen off so it took me 2 seconds when i could finally go which was unfortunally after the concert had ended.&nbsp; I wish massive attack had played though

Serious, sometimes my life is just WTF?&nbsp; I dont even know how i end up where i do.&nbsp;

I only went to the pizza pizza, the grocery store, and the gas station and managed to sell 3 Cds. I was amazed how easy it was. Im thinking of heading to some high schools this week.

on a side note daft punk has some awesome tunes. I want to make some stuff like that now."

"event","""And thats the end of frosty.""

Phil left today for good to kentucky. Last night was our send off for him and the last time we'd see him. Jamies going to be pissed that he missed it but we tried calling him and julian even tried calling lish so there was nothing we could do.I still cant believe he's actually gone for good. Its goona be pretty weird hanging out with everyone and only he's missing.

yesterday was totally an end of a movie moment. lol, frosty was walking up the stairs to head out and i was at the top andn he was walking in slow motion so we could narrate while no excuses by alice in chains was playing: ""...&nbsp;and thats the last we ever saw of andrew...."" it was jokes, but actually like it.&nbsp;

have you ever thought of your life&nbsp;like seasons of a tv show about your life? Like for me i&nbsp;remember SEASON 7: York University.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as an example&nbsp;

anyways,&nbsp;this would be a season finale episode. i guess now its time to be excited about the next season.&nbsp;






I should actually go through my life and figure out what season im in. I'll post&nbsp;teh list here.
*it doesnt go by birthdays, it goes by big events either emotionaly or ones that&nbsp; change things into a new stage of life"

We recorded a 4 song demo last weekend and it turned out fucking killer. We gave it to Universal music and they said they like it but want a different mix with more bass and bass drum. Otherwise everythings cool with it otherwise. 
We rocked dunbarton high school today too. We fucking ripped that shit apart. man, fuck. we were in the middle of a circle of like 300 people or more all bodysurfing and rocking out. and seriously, more than half of that school is hot girls. we got 2 full pages of phone ###s and other contact info. fucking Phil, Jamie and I were packing up our shit and this one MINT!! girl comes up to us and is all like ""nice show"" and we were like ""thanks, want an autograph?"". so she give us her arm and we told we wernt going to sign there and she fucking pushes her tits out of her shirt for us. We didnt have a sharpy though so i havent signed a pair of breasts...yet. We had another girl willing to get her breasts signed too later on. Consensis is we need to invest in some band sharpies for tit signing.

after we went and flyered the mall and talked to lots more hot slutty girls (no guys or ugly fat chicks were flyer worthy)

I talked to Jim at legend music and i got a job teaching guitar weekdays from about 3 - 9pm and saturday at 10:30am - 4:30pm. 
I dont start until the end of may sometime because im a replacement for Ross who is going to BC to be a hippie and go wherever life takes him. And yes, Ross was the one who played guitar before i joined Reverie.
Anyways, i didnt even apply or mention wanting a job. Jim just called and offered it to me. I think it must have been the rest of the guys (Warren, Krista, kyle, Chris, and Ross) who said to hire me. Oh, and best of all I get paid ($15-$20hr.) to play guitar.
Also, i'll be in town every night and free after 9pm to hang out and chill all summer."

"event","Long &amp; McQuade is proud to present ""An Afternoon with Exile and the Kingdom"" featuring Jeff Martin. This special event, brought to you by KOCH Records and Erikson Music, will include ""East Meets West"" - a percussion clinic featuring Michael Lee on drums and Ritesh Das on tabla, an ""Alternate Guitar Tuning Symposium"" featuring Jeff Martin, as well as live performances and a meet and greet with Jeff Martin and his band. 

Michael Lee is a world famous drummer who has played with a number of well known bands. His resume includes ZZ Top, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, Bryan Adams, Guns 'N' Roses, the Cult, Lenny Kravitz, Thin Lizzy, and Echo and the Bunnymen. He was invited by Robert Plant to be part of the ""Fate of Nations"" World Tour which eventually led to the development of Page &amp; Plant. Most recently Michael Lee has been touring with Jeff Martin and played drums on Jeff's new solo album, Exile and the Kingdom. 

Ritesh Das, composer and musician, has studied tabla with gurus Pandit Shankar Ghosh, Ustad Zakir Hussain, and most extensively with Pandit Swapan Chaudhuri. He has toured throughout the US, Canada and India, and performed with many of India's great music and dance innovators. Since moving to Canada, he has established himself as an extraordinary teacher of tabla and founded the Toronto Tabla Ensemble in 1991. 

After fifteen years of the Tea Party, former front man, Jeff Martin, decided it was time for a change - so he left to pursue a solo career. Jeff Martin is a guitarist, vocalist and producer. He has produced albums for Roy Harper (The Green Man), Hundred Mile House (self-titled EP), The Jay Murphy Band (Propaganda) and Tenth Planet (The Prophet Curse EP.) Jeff quit the Tea Party in October 2005 to pursue a solo career. His new album is called Exile And The Kingdom.

I also say them in concert at the phoenix last night and it was effing awesome. SOOOOO good.&nbsp; Im dragging at least some of you to the june or july shows.&nbsp;
I met them all last night and got my ticket signed. Jeff and i had a conversation about our danelectro guitars. (he bought his about&nbsp;4 years ago too so i dont know who had one first)
He also mentioned that all of the tea partys guitars are tied up in legal matters so he cant use any of them...which should give you an idea of how the break up is going."

Go here now.

This is marcs band that i just finished recording yesterday. we still have one more song to go but 2 are up now.

In other news, I saw Jeff martin at Healys in toronto on wednesday. It was sweet. I was insanely close. I saw him and said good job (or something to that effect) and he said thanks as he was walking by and being swarmed by a mob. I didnt swarm because its got to be hard to deal with that. He came back out to the bar later and got swarmed again so i didnt get to meet him really. I saw him for a 3rd time walking down the street as i was driving home. seriously, the man is tall. he's definitly 6 something. The top of my head reached his shoulders. I could see his head easily about the crowd when he was being swarmed.
Sadly though, it was only him jamming with some guys for a few songs. I was hoping to see his new band in action and hear some new stuff but it was still good by any means. He'll be back twice in april. one in toronto and one in guelph if need be for sold out ticket reasons."

Also, Down with Love is such a good movie. I recommend it. And yes Ewan Mcgregor is in it
I also watched Romeo and Juliet and 2 episodes of Angel for those of you who wish to start doing studies of my viewing habits."

I've just played 3 shows in 2 days at the showcase theatre in peteburough. in total it was over 1000 people, with tonights being over 500 which was almost a full house.
It was an awesome time playing to a large crowd with an actual light show and sound engineer in an established venue which has hosted many popular artists such as teri clark, wave, and mr. Dress-up as well as a pile of musicals. hanging out back stage and having our own dressing room was cool as well, not to mention the free food a beer over 2 days.
and i didnt ever have butterflies or any nervousness what so ever. I was also told my stage presence is strong and really good. apparently i was a stand out.

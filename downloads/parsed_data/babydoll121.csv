"event","so i still am not good at keeping this up. i have gone to rtc so many times this summer allie and i realized. its crazy and im going there again tomorrow. ahhh. haha. newho though. today i cleaned my house for like 6hours so hopefully i will be raking in the dough. lol. and well lets back track a little. on sunday i woke up early and went to church then came home and changed and went to pick up allie at her new house and then we headed to the m's game. of course they lost but it was really sunny and we wealked around so we had a pretty good time i think. then we went back to allies house and she got some clothes to spend the night in. then we came back to my hose and changed and went to a singing service at my church. it was kinda boring but oh well. then we sat in the car with my bro for like and hour cuz my dad had a meeting then we went to taco time then back to my house. then we were basically just chillin and allie was talkin to trevor and we decided that we wanted to go to a movie. so then me, allie and trevor went to the 10:25p.m. showing of white chicks. it was sooo funny. ya it was kinda stupid but it was way better than i thought.""omg! how'd you know this is my favorite song...making my way down town..."" HAHA lol allie!! good times good times. then we got back to my house at like 12:45 and talked and such till like 2:30 then we got in bed. in the morning i had to wake up early and shower cuz i had an ortho appt. so once i finished ready i woke up allie and she got ready then we left my house to go to my ortho in bothell which took like 15 minutes then my dad took us to rtc. it was like 12ish and we ate lunch at rubys then met up with mayram and hung out in the sun til my dad came and picked me up at about 4:15 then i came home and changed and watched tv then went to the gym at 8 and got home around 9:30ish... then i sat on my couch and fell asleep while watching a movie and woke up there this morning. lol. so yep that has been my last few days! well im going to the gym again soon so i will ttyl! love -hanna"

I dreamt that my Eion Blue and Bleach's Kurosaki Ichigo were facing each other, both were smiling, though Ichigo's face was covered with his hair (don't ask me how with that short, spiky hair of his) in a very creepy way, and I think that he was bleeding from his forehead, and alluva sudden (or at least I think so) they start fighting, and that was one damn vivid n' crazy fight, eventually they just stopped, Ichigo had a lot of Shinigamis behind him, no faces were clear, and I recall Eion saying something in the lines of ""You're a fake, Kurosaki Ichigo, the real one's gone."" Now I'm guessing that he meant the real Ichigo, I think... 

And then I woke up, and afterwards on that very same day, chapter 177 of Bleach came out, coincidence? I think not!! The Ichigo fighting now will turn out to be a fake or a copy of Ichigo Kurosaki!! Who's with me!!

Weird ass dream, but it just so happens that it became one of my favorites!! (Any dream with both Eion AND Ichigo in it can never be bad a fluke!!.... Plus Eion had kick ass moves in that battle)"

I've been having such a lovely nightmare with Linux, it gives me pain, insomnia, and a hard time, yet I still love it.

Multimedia is still not set up properly, and I have yet to download WineX (a program which lets you run Windows programs on Linux), so I've started avoiding it a bit, but I'll get to it, eventually.

On other news, I got Blood Will Tell (Dororo if you prefer the jap name) on sale and my friend lent me PoP2 (Prince of Persia), now, Dororo is nice, pretty nice, actually, the premise is really something, I can tolerate graphics, and the gameplay is nice enough to keep you not getting sick of it quickly.

PoP2, on the other hand, is almost the exact opposite in some areas, but better on the rest, the gameplay rocks, the graphics are good, and I just like the story.

<lj-cut text=""that's one badass mouse ya got there..."">
KH:COM is out, next week, the game becomes <i>mine</i>! And if you hadn't guessed, I'm one a those people that went crazy over Kingdom Hearts, it takes about one week or so for games to get here, so basically, I'll be getting it as soon as it hits ground zero.

Hear me now, I shall speak blasphemy, FFVIII is the most underrated FF game since FFVI, and the best one, too, that's right, you heard me, it's the-best-one after FFVI, call me crazy, but then again, I shall always be so.

Squall is an A-hole, Rinoa is like a whiny seven year-old, and? that's it, the story itself is great, the rest of the characters are great, the gameplay is one an RPG should have, and I am not afraid of saying that anyone who says the game is crappy, is either a nitpicker, an FF or SQUARE anti-fanboy, (like a fanboy, but instead of defending a game, he rags on it, but know that already, don't'cha?), or just does't like RPGs to begin with, only the last one is passes for being an opinion.

I've also bought Broken Sword 3, here's another thing for ya, I like Broken sword... Alot! and I like this one just as much, especially the plot, (if you've played Broken Sword 1, you'll know what I'm talking about... sorta) the gameplay is a bit stealth oriented, and the logic puzzles are a bit scarce, but the game itself still performs nicely, regardless of the genre.

Y'see, I've always had one last resort when I have no idea how to advance or what to draw, one thing that has never failed me down:

Webcomics!! I seek new webcomics to read for ideas, and it just happens that I've taken in MegaTokyo into my schedule, but instead of making new Ideas for the stories, I'm plagued with TONS of new comic ideas!! Now I have about three new different heroes that belong in three different comics (and genres by order is mecha, mysterious agents in modern-age, and a post apocalyptic spy genre. -please do not laugh-)

please send backup, if not, then I hate you... No really, I do.."

Saturday was great i knew just about everyone there so instead of sittin at the one bit all night i was goin all about talkin to everyone which was kool. Got to c loads of ma jenn that night which really cheered me up cause i luv her to bits. but that night was one of the best nights ive had in girdwoods.

well me and quinn went and bought a carry out and we decided fuk it we will go for becca as she stays on the way to the bridge where we go. We ended up sittin in her bit till 7 had a couple of beers n stuff. So then we phoned higgy and he said 'just come up for me' so we did. Went up for higgy had another beer in his bit which he gave me. so drank that then left. Went to spar so higgy could lift money and we met phil and his 2 mates and his g/f so we asked them if they wanted to come to the bridge. so they did. sat there i had another can n stuff and phils g/f left and then 2 secs later he got a phone call saying that 40 nedz were comin to get us. i was like 'fuk! ive still got a full can of beer left' so i started runnin tryin not to spill any beer cause i didnt want to waste it :) and then i decided fuk it if they catch me i will fukin hit bak so i stopped and downed ma beer then started runnin again. then cause im unfit i couldnt run anymore so i stopped. then all i saw was 40 nedz with bucky bottles and snooker cues comin up 2 us and i was like 'FUK!' so there we were gettin threatined to get hit n stuff but the scary thing was that when they were sayin 'who should we bottle first?' every one of them looked at me. so i took ma bag off one of ma shoulders so i could drop it and start punchin them and then all i heard was quinn shoutin 'FUKIN RUN!' so i ran and lukily we were fukin next to beccas bit so we actually just opened the door and barged in. we apologised to her mum n stuff but she was kool n stuff. so from there we just got a taxi to girdwoods. Got there and i saw jamie and before i even said anythin i just saw him cut to fuk i just said ' What the fuk happened to u' then he told me he got slashed with 5 neds but he got the better of them. this fuked me up i soooo wanted to beat shit out of any ned i seen. then higgy came in and said theres nedz out there in a car shoutin stuff and i just got straight up cause i needed to hit sum fukin ned but when i got up Jenn grabbed me and said it wasnt worth it. if it wasnt ma Jenn i would have just went out but i could see the concern on her face so i didnt go out cause i didnt want to make her worry even more but i was sooo wantin to beat the livin shit out sumone. I still fukin do! and i will when i find out the fuker who slashed ma Jamie.

Today didnt do much then met marc and i told him what happened and he was raging so we went up 2 law and we saw the fukers that chased us and we went up 2 them but as usual they had chibs n stuff and there was only me,marc,quinn and higgy. so i think im goin up tomoz with chibs n stuff to get the fukers. and when marc was runnin me home i saw one of the guyz that was chasin us last night and marc said he was my age and he was givin me the fingers n stuff so marc stopped the car and i got his snooker cue he had with him and i forgot it was a main street but i didnt give a fuk but then he just ran into a random house. lol . FUK!!!! im angry!"

Last night we were playin in sneaky peats in Hamilton. i got there at about 7 and most of the bands had already arrived. I went in and jamie higgy and joe hadnt arrived yet so i got maself a couple of pints. At about 8 or 9 i just saw ma jenn come in the door and i was like YAS!. we sat and spoke for a while and i got hundreds of brilliant hugz! when we went on stage we gave the dj a cd to play before we came on. it was so kool the way it went into one of our songs. i loved that gig cause we got a great responce from the crowd. I can memba when we played I AM i just looked at ma Jenn most of the way through it cause i knew she loved that song. When we came off we sat and had a drink. i was a bit drunk. and i was happy all the night and then all of a sudden i just felt like shit but i didnt really know what was up with me. Jenn was askin me what was up but i didnt really know. So i just got another hug and leaned on her shoulder. But all in all it was one of the best night ever!"

At one point i nearly broke his nose cause i uper cutted his belly then punched him quite hard in the face :S. After that the both of us went to punch each other at the same time and didnt go to plan as we punched each others punches and ma shoulder popped out of place. I nearly passed out and i had to pop it bak in by bashing it off a wall. At this point Macd was takin his gloves off and i said 'NO !!! im ok' (which i wasnt i just enjoyed gettin ma anger out.

"event","ive not put anythin in this since thursday n stuff. Well on friday i sat in the house all day and slept and at night i went to girdwoods. By the time i got there everyone was already their and i lookied around for Jenn to get ma brilliant hugz. Marc was pissed out his face and i was just a weeee bit drunk. Me, Jamie, Talky and higgy went to the kebab shop, got sum food and went to mine and higgys grans but by the time i ate my kebab i had sobered up and got really tired so i went to bed. 
I kinda done the same on saturday but this time we had a gig at sneaky peats.

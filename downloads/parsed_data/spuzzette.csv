"event","I must first say that CLEVELAND ROCKED! Now that that's out of my system I'll tell you how it went. 

At about 1:30pm I started to wait for Liza because she was going to pick me up and take me to Toronto. I know I know...she said 2-2:30 but I wanted to go man! At about...umm I can't remember the exact time now...anyway when she got there I left and such. I was weird I was expecting the whole way to Toronto to be dead silence since I had never met her before. It wasn't, we talked the entire way there and got to know eachother a bit and she's totally awesome. We get the Union Station and meet up with her Mom there and change our money over to American funds then we start looking for everyone that we're looking for haha. Christella comes running up to Liza and doesn't let go for awhile and we met up with the rest that were there that we were waiting with. Once a bunch of us get there we decide to go outside and wait for Angel and she shows up....with the BUS! Weee! We take some pictures and these random guys walking by take off their shirts and run into the picture. It was quite funny. Then we leave for Cleveland and the trip there was great, listened to Hanson for awhile. The trip there was more of a get to know the people on the bus sort of thing. We got to Cleveland at about 1am and Liza and I decided to wonder around the hotel. We went to almost every floor. At one point I looked down the hall and saw that someone had put there food outside there door, so I turned to Liza and was like ""Lets see what they ate"" so we walk over and I see these cute little salt n pepper shakers. So I took them. Then we went back to the bus and slept. 

We woke up at like 7:30 to start shooting the video (which wasn't shot till later) I was so stupid. I was busy putting on my face in the bus and wasn't in the video. I regret it now....but I didn't predict the future. Oh well. After a little bit of shooting the video and waiting for some girls we went to the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame and it was awesome. I was in awe the entire time. It was just basically Liza and I, we lost the group but that's ok, because we had a good time anyway. We found Hanson's clothes and we're standing ther molesting Tay's shoes and this chick walks up to us and yells at us for touching them. Mainly because it was posted RIGHT beside the clothes not to touch them. Then she gave us a lecture on how Hanson wants the clothes back and stuff. Oh well. After we left the clothes Lisa and Alex come running up to us and Lisa was like ""I TOUCHED KURT COBAINS GUITAR WITH THIS FINGER"" and she holds up her hand and points to the finger. So we go running to find his guitar...and even though we were just yelled at Liza had to touch the guitar while I stood guard. We took a few pictures with some guitars outside and left. I got a great picture of Alex, Liza and Lisa outside of the place. Then we went back to the bus and went out for dinner at TGI Fridays. It was pretty good food and we had a few laughs! ""*snort* hahahhahahahahahah"" yeah the picture looks like Christella is giving Angela a blow job. The waitress was really nice and we tried to get her to come see Hanson with us, but she couldn't she had to work. Liza is so incredible...she bought me dinner...with lots of arguing though. God I love that girl. We got back to the hotel and Lisa runs up to me ""Do you wanna get drunk?"" Me turn down being drunk? NEVER. But I didn't get too drunk. We ended up going to a walk in Cleveland until like 4am. We went to like every hotel in the area. We were kicked out of one though. Which sucked coz I really had to use the Washroom....apparently they don't call it a washroom in the states. So we're standing outside of the hotel that we were kicked out of the the security guard comes out and I asked him if I could use the washroom and he let me in. Then the chick that yelled at us came up to me and started yelling at me, and told me she didn't like my attitude. I didn't care...I had to pee!! So I go pee and we wonder around Cleveland some more. We went to see the Tower City stuff and we're walking down this part that we're not supposed to be and security drives up...but Andrew settled it...he still won't tell us what he told the guy. We take a picture and walk back. Then I was tired...and went to bed. 

We woke up at around 10am and got ready for the concert. I can't remember what time we left for the concert but we got there and it was funny...there were fans pointing to the bus and thinking we were Hanson. THEN we see this thing on the wall....it's a picture of a penis..and beside it, it says ""eat my meat yo!!!"" So that quickly because our catch phrase for the weekend and I was dared to say it to Zac. We go into the Cookoff thing and Alex, Liza, Lisa and I agreed we weren't going to lose eachother. Well we did. So we stood in this spot where Hanson was going to do an interview. We're standing there, and it becomes 3:30 and we asked what time Hanson was going to be there and they said 4:30 so Liza and I said screw it, we had to find Jenny. We watch a few bands, eat a few ribs, spend $10 on a glass of lemonade, buy some boas, hang with Lisa and Alex, take a few pictures...and we find Jenny...and she's got THE JACKET. It was so cool seeing Jenny, I had no clue she was going to the concert. So I'm like ""Jenny...J-e-n-n-y not J-e-n-n-i right?"" and she verified it was MY jenny. She also told me that my Kait was in a car accident...which upset me, because I really wanted to meet her there. She's my lover man. ANd MY KAIT. But we still breathed the same air because she showed up. What a trooper. So we took a few pictures and such then we decided it was a good time to find our seats because the concert was going to start soon and I end up being 5th row...2nd from centre isle. The seats were awesome. The closet I've ever been. Oh...also Christella told us about the thing at FYE that if you bought hanson's CD then you got wristbands for a signing. So I'm like...You know what I was going to buy it anyway, might as well meet hanson in the process. So I bought it haha. Anyway...the concert was amazing, definatly the best Hanson concert I have ever been to. (3rd one) Taylor did Crazy Beautiful solo...it was amazing, definatly not used to it, but amazing. Isaac threw the guitar pick right at my direction and Christella and I couldn't find it. But she found it. *sniffles* and she's already got one. So the concert ends, I miss Hanson bowing because I was busy looking for the pick. Lisa was going nuts to find out where we had to line up to see Hanson it was funny. We line up and I see Jenny and we snap a picture of eachother. Cute picture but I can barely see her. It's finally our turn and we get to them, I had Zac the CD insert and he signs it, then I ask to shake his hand, and we shook. Then I get to Taylor and I wanted a picture so bad, so I bend down and was like ""taylor....taylor.....taylor...TAYLOR....TAYLOR"" and he finally looks up and goes ""Yeah?"" so I say ""Can you look at the camera"" and he smiles pretty and the picture is awesome. I get the Isaac and he hands me a CD insert and I'm like ""that's not mine dude"" and I stood there and aruged with him about it. I eventually took it. It still wasn't mine, but oh well. As I'm leaving I'm trying to get a picture of Isaac because I was too busy arguing with him to think about a picture but I snapped one from behind a guard and got another picture of them with Lisa and Liza. It's a cute picture. So we go back to the bus and wait for a bit, this chick walks up to our bus and is like ""Is Hanson on there?"" and Angel said no then she called her a liar. That was funny. Gary then tells us that Hanson is out there signing autographs if we want to go. We did. I got my picture with Zac and Liza got her thing signed for Jimmy. That was pretty cool. I also got a picture with Ash and Zac. Which was a cute picture becaus she was half asleep. I stand back with the group on the other side of the road where the group was and we see Isaac, I was JUST about to walk up to him and stuff, then fans freaked out and he had to leave. Oh well. Still love the guy. Then we went back to the hotel and we had an awesome time. We wanted to play elevator tag and we got in trouble, but poor Lisa was still playing...With herself for like 10 mins. I eventually went an looked for her. We hung out with Dee Dee the hotel clerk and she was absolutely awesome. We all fell in love with her. We made her a ""Employee of the year"" award and we all signed it and she loved it. We got a picture with her and they're going to send it to her. We played a couple of games in the lobby. One was pycriatrist (I know it's not spelt right) and it was my turn, and they were so mean lol. I was the object. I asked for a hint and Ash was like ""this person is stupid"" and I was like ""Is it me?!?!?"" it was. hahahah we had a good laugh. OH I almost forgot about the girls from Detriot. They were fun. Margo was awesome! I want a Margo autograph one day man. Anyway after a few games it was about 5am and we all decided it was a good time to sleep, we were leaving in the morning. Then we went to sleep after hanging on the bus for a bit. Took a lot of pictures and they're all awesome. 

We woke up in the morning and basically got ready to go...I wasn't even dressed by the time we left lol. Sorry...I was lazy. We listened to Hanson on the way back and we all jammed it out. It was awesome. Nothing can describe being on a tour bus with that many hanson fans. We shot some more of the documentary and then we get to the Duty Free shop and Lisa and I went together and bought a carton of Marlboros...we were in heaven. Kinda weird going back to Canadian smokes after Marlboros. We get to the border and it starts hitting us....that we're going home and we get all sad and start writing goodbye notes and everything. We get back to Toronto and I FINALLY got a picture with Angel. Then we get into Union Station and it's just Sasha, Me, Alex, Liza and Lisa....and we're all standing there crying and hugging. We didn't want to leave. So we agreed we're all going to marry rockstars and travel with eachother lol. Liza and I had to leave quickly because the train was going to leave in like 5 minutes so our goodbyes were cut short and Liza and I board the train and it's just her and I again. Where this whole trip started off. It was weird going home. We met this really nice guy from Brantford on the train. Liza and him did most of the talking...I was more in a daze. Then...I we saw a rainbow...it was a perfect end to a perfect trip. It then became 2 rainbows even better. All of a sudden I start recognizing things....we were in Brantford. and it sucked big. Then it's just totally Liza and I again in the parking lot of the train station, and we stood there for like 5 mins and pinky swore that we were going to run away. *sigh* 
Then our ride shows up and Liza gives him the ""Pets Sounds"" album...I think he liked it :D. I go home, trip over. Writing done. Night."

"event","I had such a huge scare tonight. Since Friday I couldn't find my purse. Which really sucked when it came to buying coolers because I didn't have my I.D. on me so I had to get my mom to get it for me. The I.D. was in the purse. The 2nd time I really wanted my purse was Saturday because I was going out bridesmaid dress shopping (YES! I'm a bridesmaid!! I'll post a picture of the dress in a bit later) and I wanted my purse so I could carry my bank card to buy the dress. Also I had lost my bank card so I thought it was in the purse as well. So I was a bit ticked off about that. Then today...2 days later it suddenly hits me. I can't find my purse. Which means I have no I.D.. If I don't have I.D. I can't get across the border. If I can't get across the border...I can't go to Cleveland this weekend. I was freaking right out. I mean I have already paid for this trip. There is no way I can't go. I wouldn't get the money back and that would be a lot of money I have wasted. That's not good. I was almost to the point of breaking down in tears. I mean I'm really looking forward to this trip. This is my getaway time. It's also going to be absolutley amazing. I start going on this wild rampage ripping things apart and so forth. I was determined I was going to find this freaking purse. I was going through scenarios of where I could have left the purse. Most of it is places that I have left the purse in the past. Then I remember one place it could have been. In the mass hustle and bustle of coming home from my Granny's funeral it probably fell on the floor and was kicked under the loveseat. So I go to look under it and I see something black and my purse has a black handle. I reached for it and as soon as I realized what it was that it was my purse I screamed out with glee! I'm so happy, I can go to Cleveland now. 

In 4 short sleeps a whole town must be prepared
In 4 short sleeps a bus load of fans will be travelling
In 4 short sleeps new friends will be made
In 4 short sleeps the STORM CLEVELAND PROJECT will come

Watch out Cleveland we're on our way."

"event","My nephew is finally here. Seemed to take forever, even though we were only waiting 4 months. We didn't find out until she was 5 months pregnant. He is absolutely gorgeous! It's hard to describe the love that I have for him. It's weird too...I don't know him, and I already know I'd give my life for his.

"event","Last night my mom and them got into a fight. So I sent them this email. 

This has gone on too far. What happened this evening is unacceptable. Before you even let an explanation get out of why the car needed to be moved, you shot off your mouth. Who do you think you are? In case you are unaware, my nana can barely walk. She needs the car a little closer so she doesn't have cramps the whole night and can't sleep. If she walks a long distance, she is in pain for days. It's not too much to ask to move the car two god damned feet. The car needed to be moved so that my NANA was not in pain. That had nothing to do with my mother. But of course you were inconsiderate. For your information you DO owe my mother $120. *I* myself went to the store and got out the money. So it's not her word against yours, it is OUR word against yours. Also I would have you know, my mother takes excellent care of my Nana. You don't know how much she has altered her life so she CAN take care of her. In the last 3 weeks she has done so much for her. I will say that when my mother quit her job, I was pissed beyond belief but now I know a little bit more of what was thought about it, I have changed my views.  For the longest time I was standing up for you guys, and I would get the 3rd degree from my mother. I would not believe that my friends were like that. I was wrong. I was so wrong. What kind of friend does that to someone? You guys are so out of line in this one. It was before christmas that the money was given to you. You should probably look at the calendar and check the date, because I can tell you, that I know for a fact it's been over a month. The initial promise was the monday after Christmas she would get it, that has long come and gone. There were a few more promises of dates after that. Told either that the stuff was there, or the money was coming. I'm sorry, but if you owe someone half of what they got, you don't go and sell it. The person you OWE gets first dibs. That is so ignorant, and illogical. The more the person that you owe has to wait, the more frustrated they become. I would like you to put yourself in my mothers shoes for a moment. Summer time, she has amazing neighbours who pull together at the toughest times, like when the hydro goes out. These neighbours are so awesome, we're even having yard sales together. Slowly things start to change. We start pulling together to help out, maybe a little too much? She is told from you that if you go the big way, it's a win win situation. These are her neighbours that She's become good friends with. (Oh yeah, I forgot, no one likes her, or EVER liked her right? Ya thought so) Since they're good friends, she's going to trust them and go big. She gives them their end of the bargin, and her neighbours get the big stuff. But for some reason, she didn't get it all. Knowing they're her neighbours, and she trusts them enough to believe when they say it will be there a certain date. Christmas has come, times are busy. Both have visiting relatives, both are trying to get everything done. She gives her neighbours a little grace period. She understands the stressfulness of Christmas. Christmas has come and gone, no word. In a little while her neighbour comes and visits her in a good mood. The rest of your stuff will be there soon. They'll keep her informed. Hmm....still no word. The time is closer that her mother is coming to live with her, and she realizes that her current job schedual doesn't work around her mothers dialysis and basically life schedual. The only thing she can do at this point is quit her job. she discusses this with her mother and ask her if she thinks it's best. She agrees. She quits your job, her mother moves in. Weeks have passed since Christmas. She still hasn't heard from her neighbours. Knowing they're her neighbours she realizes that they can easily get to her if they need her. So she shrugs it off. She's being patient, she doesn't want to be a bother. She knows what it feels like to be hounded. It adds tention. And let me tell you, the last thing she needs in her life is tention right now. Then one day, she sees one of her neighbours outside, and she thought ""Hey! This would be a good time to just simply ask them if they've heard anything"" Welll she thought it was a great idea. She was wrong, she was received as giving attitude, so she was treated very rudely from the last person she'd expect it from. After that she recieves a few emails that her stuff is there. She thinks ""Great!"" she has to be careful though, because her mother can't know. she figures her neighbours will understand because they knew she wanted to keep things low when her mother got there. Next thing she knows, they've already gotten rid of HER stuff, the stuff she has been waiting for. The stuff they owe her. The stuff they promised. What kind of people do that to other people? No matter who they are. It was way out of line when my mother went to your house to get her stuff and you asked her is she was ""fucking 12 years old that [she] has to hide from [her] mother"" What would make you even think that? You KNOW that you understood that she was keeping it ""hush hush"" while my Nana is here. You TOLD me that. That was low. And you know it. You guys may think that my mother is in the wrong in this one, but you are so far off it's not even funny. You know what, I KNOW you guys are going through a hard time. But hard times do not revolve around you. You don't know how many times I sympathized to my mother for you. At this point I don't even care if you're mad at me, hate me, will never talk to me again. I am so fed up with this shit. You guys have to grow up and think about others for once. She has done so much for you, and you guys don't even give a shit. She has been nothing but decent towards you guys. I know my mother and I know she avoids confrontations. She avoids trouble. You may not believe it, but I think I would know her better then you guys ever could. I just can't believe you guys would even have the gull to do what you did this evening. Also, I will have you know, that from the very begining that spot has been ours. The people who lived in your place before you, would always park closer to their house. Hey ain't it the logical thing to do? You don't even have to exercise too much. you're right at your door stop. It was a simple request. Not the end of the world. You will have the money to her by friday, I don't care if you have to go through me, or through Tina but it will be in her hands. I don't want to have to take this too far. This is ridiculas, this has been going on for far too long. Get it over and done with, so you don't have to deal with it anymore. You don't even have to associate with us anymore. When I say us, I mean us. I have stood up for you for way to long and you just proved me a liar. I would like a reply to this email before friday. I want to know your whole take on this. If you give me your take in person, that doesn't matter. I just want a response of some kind. 

P.S. our cable is fine thanks, just too many channels to choose from.They did a nice job of cutting the cable at the wall for us. Oh, and it's not very nice to threaten people like that."

"event","The last I updated was before christmas so there's a bit I have to update. For christmas I got a 2.5 gallon tank and it ended up killing ANY fish that I put in there. So this last pay cheque I went out and bought a 10 gallon tank. My friend Blair also bought me a few guppies to go into it because he ditched me one night. Just before I got the tank one of my guppies had 10 babies and they were living in  a goldfish bowl for awhile. Now they're in the main tank. A new hobby has sparked. 
My nana's living with us now, and I like it that way. I've lost 3 lbs since she got here, and she's helping me get down to a comfortable weight. I'm not too overweight, but it's nice to have some encouragement. I was a lot larger 2 summers ago, but since then, I've lost 30lbs, so it's all gravy. My nana has Dialysis every monday, wednesday, and friday, she likes it a lot better at the hospital here. She doesn't feel like crap when she gets off of it. She's also going to be paying out rent for us so we can catch up on bills and such, my mom and I were both in a rut and getting behind on bills. christmas didn't help for that, we were too busy buying presents, then worrying about the bills. Since this is my first christmas where I was making money and HAD to pay bills, it was a good lesson christmas, and I'll know better for next Christmas. I'll learn how to budget my money if it's the last thing I do lol. 
My best friend called me the other day, to tell me that he wants to date me, or just sleep with me. I don't really want to do either, I don't want to ruin the friendship we have. Some people would kill to have a relationship like ours. It kind of reminds me of Will and Grace. Where they're best friends, but don't sleep together or anything like that, and it makes the relationship stronger. I also don't want to date anyone right now. I'm kind of happy being single. Being in a relationship, there were too many strings attached. It's not that my friend's not my type, because he is. I feel comfortable around him, and I can discuss anything openly with him, without him changing his opinion about me. 
Tacy and I finally talked and things are good between us again. Maybe not with my mom and them, but it's not up to me to work things out for them. I used to talk to them FOR my mom, but I've stopped that, because whenever i would explain what was said, it would end up in an argument and my mom accusing me of picking their side. Well I wasn't picking sides, I was merely seeing both their sides. I missed going over to Tacys all the time. Their kids are great. And I think Jessie missed me, because I walked with Tacy to pick up the kids from school, and Jessie saw me and came up running and gave me a huge hug. 
Tina might be breaking up with her boyfriend, which I don't mind at all because I can't stand the guy. Sometimes he's alright, but other times you say something and he has to say something that would make him slightly better then you. No matter what it was. I honestly believe that he's using her. He says he can't get a job in Canada because he doesn't have SIN and an American citizen, well Tinas aunt told her that he has had a job in town before at a Pizza shop, so she now knows that he CAN get a job, he's just a lazy ass and won't get one. Also, he went to school AND jail in Canada, and from what I believe you can't do either without being a canadian citizen, because you'd be shipped back to the US. 

in short, life is going ok right now, it could be better, but I'll survive. lol

Oh we have a car!"

"event","Christmas is coming and I go my major shopping on Friday when I get paid. I'm sick and blech. I'm going shopping with my  neighbour and my mom, so it's going to be hard to shop for my mom with her being right there. It's going to suck, but I figure, I'll get a shopping cart, and just ditch her lol. I already know what i want to her her. There's a few things that stuck out when I was there last Saturday. She'll like them. I have to buy for a few more people too. All by bills are paid so the money I get this friday is all mine. I'm lending the back neighbour $100 but I'll get it back monday so it's all gravy. On Saturday the back Neighbour is having a Christmas party so I'll be there ALL day Saturday. It's mostly going to be close friends and family there. When I say close friends, I mean neighbours lol. We're a pretty close nit neighbourhood and we all get along (within our building) These are really the first group of neighbours that I'd be devastated if any of us moved away. Mind you, I called my friend Melissa yesterday (she's on a commercial for her College, College Boreal) She's going to need a new room mate in  August in Toronto, so I might be moving in with her then. It'll be expensive, but I'll manage. I miss Melissa, she was my best friend since Kindergarten. We were they goody goody, church going, God praising kids. So now that we've both grown up it's going to be soo cool to be with her again. We talked for an hour yesterday. I'm not looking forward to the long distance bill for calling Toronto lol. I'm going to be going to toronto for New Years Eve to just chill with her. We might go to the bar or whatever, but it'll be fun. She's currently in a relationship with someone, I wish I could remember his name but she wants to get married to him. So I'll be a bridesmaid! yay! anyway the neighbour messaged me, I'm going over"

For what he did, he definatly deserves more then 4 years. That's only 2 years per year he did stuff. At least something was done though. Seb and I are doing fine so far. He's not talking right now, I think he's out finding a place to live in. He has to find a place by september 1st. My mom offered for him to move into our place if he can't find a place. Oh yeah, we're staying here now. The neighbours and landlord convinced us to stay. I DID have my own place all set up for me and everything too. OH well, my mom needs the help. 
My nana and Seb came down for the yardsale, that was interesting. We were watching ""head of state"" and Seb and I were sitting on the chair, and he was picking a part the movie, so my Nana goes ""You know, you don't have to watch the movie, you two could go downstairs and make love."" My mouth dropped to the floor. I could not believe she said that. From my NANA of all people! I could see my mom saying that joking around, but my NANA! Sheesh.

"event","This past week has been pretty interesting. Technically it started
on the weekend. My friend Seb came over for the weekend, we had a
pretty good time. We spent the entire weekend together. He's a very 
decent guy. My mom likes him, but parental approval can be a bad thing. 
On friday afternoon, Seb and I were watching TV, and the cable went 
out. It turns out, the cable company disconnected us, even though 
we had paid the bill. So my mom and I spent saturday morning trying
to get some answers from the company. I think they're avoiding us or 
something. They say that they are doing to call us at a certain time
and we never get the phone call. We end up calling them. Yet we still
get no answers. We're trying to get that worked out. We'd better get 
money back for the days that we weren't online. Because it was awhile. 
Another thing, I can't remember if I mentioned this in previous entries
but one of my friends used my credit card, without my knowledge. He is
trying to be the victim in this situation. Trying to blame it on all me
because I told a few of our friends. Well they asked why my card was 
maxed out, so I told them. It's not like I was lying liking my friend
who used the card. Am I wrong for telling people? Personally, I don't 
think I am. I asked him how he got my number, he said he logged onto
my online banking to get it. That's like another fraud right there. I
can't believe I ever trusted him. I told him I want the money by the 
end of the week, or I'm going to press charges. He said ""Just fucking
do it, get it over with, DO IT"" I think he thinks I won't do it. I 
think he forgets it against the law. That's fraud. He's one of the most
selfish people I have ever met in my life. From the first time I met 
he was using me. He would come over, and I would buy an entire case of
beer for him. Buy him smokes. Buy him food. Buy him hair dye.  
Buy him a $120 computer case for his birthday. Give him spare computer parts.
 I've gotten nothing in return. Not even a thank you that I can remember. 
At first it didn't bother me, until I couldn't pay the bills. People
were telling me he was using me, but I refused to accept it. I was just
helping out a friend. He wasn't a friend. I will admit, he did put 
together a working computer for me. But I had to pay for everything that
went into it. It's not like he gave me the parts from the goodness of
his heart. He goes on that he did the wireless networking on our computers
and that he should have charged me $1500. I'm sorry, but any idiot can
do wireless networking. In fact, my mom and I HAD. We just had him 
basically look over it to make sure it worked. Seb says I should make 
him pay for my hard drive that I had to buy. Or at least half of it. It 
was a joint effort of the part of setting it on fire. I still don't 
totally think it was my fault. I mean, I haven't even touched the inside
of my computer since I got it together. So anything that happened inside
my computer, shouldn't technically be my fault, but I took the blame.
I didn't want my mom to hate him. Because, I have to face it, he was my
only offline social life. That has changed though, I'm hanging out with 
old friends again. I'm hanging out with people who don't use me. He KNEW
I was short for money, he KNEW I was having a hard time paying my bills. 
HE KNEW. So why did he keep doing it? Good question. Probably because 
like I said, he was a user. He not only has used me, but he has used my 
other friends. Mostly for alcohol. That's another thing that bugs me 
about him. Everything has to be associated with alcohol or drugs. There
is more to life then those two things. When I first met him, I thought
alcohol was the source of my fun. After Seb left, I realized I had more
fun with him more then anyone in a long time. I didn't have a sip of 
alcohol. I don't need that stuff anymore. There is more to life, there
are better ways to have fun. This doesn't mean I won't drink anymore, 
it simply means, it would be the source of my entertainment. I wonder
if he'll realize this. I doubt it. Recently, he has been going on that
his girlfriend is pregnant. She's 15. I honestly don't think she is. 
She's a lot smarter then that. She's a really nice girl, and she 
deserves better. It's even hard to picture then together. He told this
other girl, that he had a girlfriend, but they hardly talk to eachother. 
So she came to me, and asked me if it was true. Two days before, he had 
come to me, to tell me that his girlfriend was pregnant. I, of course, 
told the other girl this. His lies have become his truth. He lives in
a fantasy world. I swear he doesn't know what's up, or down, what's 
right, what's wrong, what's left, what's right. It's quite sad to actually
know someone like this too. What's he going to do in the real world?
He's going to get a slap in the face. No one gets anywhere in life, when
all they do is lie. People find out, people will learn not to trust him. 
It's about time he makes up his mind, is he going to go like this forever?
Sad, but true, he probably is. He's already dug himself into a grave, 
how is he going to get out? 

peace out, 
Mandie"

"event","I went to my aunts house on Monday evening, for a court date on Tuesday afternoon. The drive up was long and boring. There were 3 women squished into a truck for 3 hours. No music. No talking, no nothing. The beginning of the ride wasn't too bad, we did talk a bit, but the chatter stopped when we were driving through Toronto. The ride through Toronto seemed the longest, it was almost like Toronto never ended. We got back to the house around 12am. I practically went straight to bed, I was so tired. 

Tuesday morning I was woken up at 8am, to my aunt telling that the people would be there 11:30am, to take me out for lunch before the trial started. Meanwhile, I couldn't get back to sleep, so I just stayed up and showered, and got ready for the trial. They took me to a really nice Golf Club for lunch. The purpose of taking me for lunch was to get me prepared for the trial. They went over the information with me, and did a pre-trial questioning. It was over-whelming. I didn't think I was going to be able to do it, when they asked me a question that mattered, I would freeze, and look to Shelley for the answer. I knew I wasn't going to be able to do that during the trial. By the end of the pre-trial thing, I was pretty confident with what answers I was going to say. I wasn't nervous, but Shelley was really nervous. I don't tend to get nervous the easily. I haven't a clue why though. It's almost like it's second nature to be in front of a crowd. However, I'm never in front of a crowd to prove this point. One time in grade 6, I was asked by my Principal to resite the ""In Flanders Field"" in front of the whole school, it was awesome. Back to the topic, when we left for the court house, Shelley was getting really nervous, I could tell by the way she was driving. The courthouse was really nice. We had nice leather seats to sit in, and it was air conditioned. When the trial began, I had to leave, so I wouldn't hear Shelley's testimony. Her testimony took about 2 hours, so I sat in the lobby, and read every single flyer in there. I learned a few things. :) It was finally my turn to go in, I had to go straight to the witness stand. It was literally a stand. On TV they always sit down, but not here. I wore the wrong shoes too. Big platform things. My feet were so sore during the whole thing. The defense lawyer was really nice. Even though he was against me, it was almost as if he felt bad that I had to go there and do this. His name was Bert :) The first lawyer, asked me some really stupid questions, but you kind of have to, to get the information out. They were mostly yes and no answers. I don't think I've ever said ""Yes"" so many time in my life. When it came time for the defense lawyer to ask me the questions, I was getting really frustrated with him, because he was taking my words and rearraning them, so it looked good for him. I was getting so frustrated I was starting to get sarcastic. I caught myself pretty quickly though. It's their job to get you frustrated, and try to make you look like an idiot though. They try to get you to break down, and say what they want to hear. I didn't break though. Bert even told me, that I was making him sweat because he wasn't able to break me. After the cross-examining, court recessed for 5 minutes (which turned out to be for 20) so the judge could have a cigarette. Which was really ironic, because we were there because I was hired, by the Health Unit, to buy smokes under age to bust the guy. So while we're there, trying to get this guys store shut down for selling smokes, the judge is outside having a smoke. It was during the recess, that Bert came up to me and told me I was making him sweat, and that I did really good. He stated that he didn't care if he won or lost, because he was paid a lot just to be the lawyer. The Judge came back in to give her statements, and it looked like she was on our side, then all of a sudden, she goes ""although"". Right then and there, I knew we didn't win. And we didn't. But it's no big deal to me at all. We walked out with Bert, and he's a really decent guy. He ended up giving me a hug, and he said ""You're so adorible, nice to meet you, even if was under these circumstances"". It is too bad I had to meet him under those circumstances. He seems like the kind of guy, that would be fun to hang out with. 

I had to take the bus home from my aunts place, it was a 6 hour drive. But I slept the whole time, until I got to Toronto. There was an hour and a half stop over in Toronto. So I walked down to HMV. It was really hot in Toronto, the humid was almost unbearable. After I got back from HMV, I was sitting in the bus terminal, half expecting someone I knew to just walk in and keep me company. However, I don't know anyone in Toronto. Well I know one person, but I have no idea what he looks like, so if he walked pass me, I wouldn't have have flinched. Toronto used to be over-whelming for me. But now it's almost second nature for me to be there. I love Toronto, I love visiting the city. Mind you, visiting it with someone to talk to, is always a bonus. 

Peace,

I've only been talking to him for a little while, we talked before, but lost contact for a little while. He's different then most guys I've talked to. He cares. Or if he doesn't, he doesn't let on that he doesn't. He listens, gives his input, and most of the time, it's just what I want to hear. Sometimes, I feel like I can go to him with my problems, and he will be there. I feel bad though, it's almost as if he's my sounding board. He's extremely intelligent. He knows it, but he doesn't flaunt it, or shove it in your face and I greatly appreciate that. I know I'm not the smartest person in the world. He doesn't talk down to me or criticize me. He a genuine guy. He intrigues me. His actions, his words, this thoughts. I am lucky he writes his thoughts down, and I'm lucky I can read them.

"event","My brain gets going sometimes, and it won't stop. Like last night for example. I didn't get much sleep. I've been thinking about my life in general, and how horribly alone I've been. My entire life, I've had 3 boyfriends, and I have never been in love. I have never had the honour of experiencing love at it's finest. Sure, I love people, I love my moms, my nana, my friends, family,  but it's not the same love. I've never had a relationship I can say I was proud of, that I will sit and tell wonderful memories about. 
   I'll sit and think about what it would be like to be in a relationship, the conversations that might be shared, the experiences, just being able to say ""I'm with someone, and I love that person"" I can't help but think, it may never happen. I shut the male gender out. Sure I'll talk to them, sure I'll be friends with them, but the second they show interest, I try to get rid of them as soon as possible. I do this, but I definatly don't want this, there is nothing more that I want, then to be in a loving relationship. I want to be able to say, I love you, and hear, I love you, back. I want someone to care about me, the way I would care about them. 
   The more I think about it, the more it hurts. They say everyone has their soul mate, what if I've shut that soul mate out, and they have moved on? What if I never find my soul mate because of my own stupidity? And it does come down to that, my own stupidity. I have shut many people out of my life, and it's too late to get them back. Not just guys, but people in general, my family, friends. People I once would do anything for at the drop of a hat. I've lost contact with them. I've lost my life. The life I once knew. I was happy, I had friends, I had family who were there for me. I have nothing now. But maybe it's my past that's made me this way. The events, the people, the lives I have shared. I can't help but think, it's the events of 8 years of my life that has made me this way. But no, I told myself, I wouldn't let those 8 years ruin my life. I will move on, I will live a wonderful life, I will move on. But I can't, it's still in the back of my head. It won't leave, it can't leave, it doens't want to leave. It wants to haunt me for the rest of my life, make my life miserable. I have one person to blame for this. 
   What if I had spoken up when I was younger? What if I had the guts to tell someone? What if I didn't wait for 14 years to say something? What if. Where would my life be now? Would I be happy? Or would I be just as miserable? I can't go back in the past, but I wish there was a way to find out. I want to know. I want to know my ""what if's"". LIfe is full of what if's. I want to know my life, the way I picture I should have done it many years ago. However, what if, the what if's actually happened? Would I know the same people? Would I have the same personality? There are some people that are only in my life, because of the events that happened. I wouldn't give up those people for the world.

The case comes with it's own special cooler so you don't have to put them in the fridge :) I made him go into Mcdonalds and get me chicken nuggets because I didn't show up for work on friday, and I didn't want them to yell at me lol The girl there was hitting on him lol. He's quite a hit there, they all love him. It took bloody forever too, they had to make my god damned nuggets! Anna wanted to come over, but I didn't want her milking me for my alcohol lol. At 2am Dan decided he was hungry so we walked up to Pizza Pizza and got pizza. He brought a bottle of beer with him, he chugged it, and just as the bottle was leaving his hand, a cop came around the corner, he was so close to getting arrested lolol. Oh, did I mention it was raining out? lol we were getting soaked. So we get there, and it takes us like 15 mins to decide what we want. We get our food ordered, and we pay for it and everything, then Dan asked the guy for 2 extra dipping sauces, jalapeno, and marinara....the fucker, got them all right, but threw the god damned marinara out! fucking sand racial slur....we went to bed fairly early, around 4am. We woke up, and I can't remember who thought of the idea, but we decided to dye our hair....blue. so now, Dan has an entirely blue head, and I have blue bangs rofl@!Anyway, I have to figure something out so see you later"

"event","I havne't updated in like forever. Ok almost a week, it's not like anyone reads it anyway. So I had a pretty good weekend, tuesday came down, and friday night we played Trivial Pursuit, saturday was really fun, My mom tuesday and I went to the Casino. I went with $40, left with $35. That doesn't include my meal cost, because that cost me $10. So I was up $10 which was cool. There was this guy there, who works there in the kitchen, and he looks exactly like Elijah Woods. He was so hot man haha. My mom used to work with him, and she said she was going to try and hook me up haha. That would be grand. Kersta came with us, and she gave me like $10, plus she paid for half of my food, how awesome is she? Then we went home in her car with the roof down, yeah she has a convertable, and it's awesome. She has amazing speakers, that makes it go BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM. Yeah, that's right, you could hear us all the way in the next city. We listened to Eminem. which was cool, Kersta has great taste in music for an adult lol. Later that night we rented ""Darkness Falls"" and it was awesome, it really makes you jump. We also lit firecrackers, we waited for blair to get there, so he could light them, in case hey were defective. I messed the little one up though, because I didn't nail it to the wood right, and it didn't spin :/ So we went and bought another one, and then another big one lol. I also bought big sparklers...they were huge. Yup. that was my weekend. 
I think I know what I'm doing about my living situation now, Plans aren't definate, but i have some idea."

"event","The mothers day weekend went pretty well...my nana came down, and we played UNO most of the weekend. I forgot how much i love the game lol. I'm sure I'll figure out a way to turn it into a drinking game...and I'll play it with either Tuesday or Chrissie. I was supposed to go to the bar with Chrissie on wednesday...I can't remember why I didn't, but either way I didn't. I miss hanging out with Chrissie and Victor everyday. They were awesome, they still are awesome though. I wish that roxanne was still in Town, but hey, if I move to BC, I'll get to see her everyday...because I'll be living with her lol I still don't know if I should move to BC or just stay in Ontario...I haven't a clue. I kind of want to stay in Ontario, but I kind of want to start from scratch. Anyway, I got my mom for mothers day a coffee mug lol. She asked for it, so she got it. I also got her a potted plant, don't know the kind, but I got them for her. I got my nana a necklace and plant, she really likes them. My nana can be overbearing sometimes, she'll try to take over your life, wheither you're aware of it or not. she likes things done her way, and if they aren't done her way, she'll bitch about it until there was no tomorrow! but i still love her none the less, she is like my mother, in some ways, she's more like my mother then my own mother.  I would be really devastated. 
Blair is really starting to bug me, he's begining to be VERY untrustworthy, I don't know who I can trust anymore."

I don't know WHO I discussed this with, or when I discussed this, or maybe he even read my diary. I don't know, nor do I care. Everyone blows everything out of proportion, and it's annoying!"

"event","Today was interesting, I put in 10 hours of work today....I Took an extra hour for my one friend so she could go home or something, I didn't really ask why she wanted me to take the hour, but I don't really care, I got an extra hours pay, and I need the money. At the other job they sent me home early though, which I'm glad about, because i didn't miss American Idol...however, I told me my to tape it, but she had her boyfriend over, so I knew it wasn't going to be taped. I work right across the street, so I asked if i could run home to make sure she was getting it taped, well she locked me out of the house while he was there, and she wonders why I was pissed off. Anyway...I'm in a pretty good mood, no idea why, I'm just in a giddy mood...nothing to be happy about either, life isn't going my way. but everyone's entitled to their crazy days right?


Oh god....Heaven? I just received a clip of something i'm not supposed to have.....lets just say, a 17 year old, piano, solo, and that's heaven :):):):)"

"event","Kendra pisses me off sometimes, she puts words in my mouth all the time, god. You have to be REALLY careful with what you say, i think the only person that doens't have to watch what they say is Dan. it's almost as if he can do no wrong. and it's sad. She thinks the boy is perfect....I mean yes, he has an amazing personality...but he's far from perfect. And another thing about Dan that's starting to get to me...sometimes, he acts as if he's my friend, and other times, he's acts as if he hates my guts. sometimes i just don't get it. He can be very nice, and other times he's not....why? If he doesn't like me, why doesn't he just say it? instead of me thinking he does. It hurts...because i consider him a good friend, but it's almost as if sometimes, he doesn't consider me a friend at all. when he's here, I buy everything for him...his booze, his food, his smokes, everything. sure he works on my computer, but I don't  think I should have to pay for everything. But nonetheless....it doesn't bother me that mcuh, but it should? right? And I still want to hang out with him, he's fun to get drunk with. Same with kendra, she's also a very fun person to hang out with....she's just different online.....I know people generally are...but she's really different online then offline. 
I still haven't decided what i'm going to do about the living situation yet....I really want to move to BC...but i don't want to leave my life here behind. I still look in the paper every day and every thing to see if there is going to be places here...but I'm not reallly having that much luck :/"

"event","Well on the moviing out....I still dont know what i plan on doing. My friend out in BC offered for me to move in with her...I might take her up on the offer. But I kind of don't want to...I don't want to leave my animals behind, nor do i really want to go anywhere until my nana passes away....if I couldn't go to her funeral...i would be crushed...she is a huge part of my life. So I kind of want to stay in town...or at least...somewhere in ONtario to at least have easy access to my friends and such. But if chrissie doesn't get a place here with me...I'm screwed and I have to live on my own and i don't know if i could do it. I'll have to figure something out i guess. 
On the kendra blair situation, it's getting worse and worse...it's getting the point wehre my friendshop is on the line because of blair, and I don't knwo if I'll do that, I've known blair longer, but kendra has been more of a friend frankly....I don't know...if I lose blairs friendship, I may never get to see Dan again, and that would absolutely suck.....GAH, why did i set them up????"

"event","My friend Dan and I set up our friends Blair and Kendra, well Blair and kendra got along great...I mean...to the point where they were in bed. But nothing MAJOR happened in bed. Well Kendra lives in *insert town an hour and 50 mins away* and blair lives in the town i live in. So Blair went to go get Kendra while Dan was at my house one weekend, and the four of us just got drunk and hung out. This is Kendra and Blairs first meeting and they got along GREAT. On sunday, when Blair had driven Kendra back, they connected. And up to 3 days after the weekend, they still connected, they were getting along and then suddently, friday comes along, and kendra isn't his type. Which is totally fucked up, I mean...they were getting along so well. His excuses are pathetic...and now, I'm stuck in the middle of this whole charade! Why do I even bother?!"

"event","not really, My mom has decided that i have to move out in like July. Oh well, what can you do right? Not a hell of a lot, I'm going to be looking for a place for awhile, i don't really care what condition it's in, as long as it's cheap and and it's shelter. actually, my ideal place is a bacholor apartment, I don't really want a bedroom, just one big room, I would love it!! Well I'll need a bathroom lmao. 
Anyway, I have absolutely no money left...I have $2 in my account, and $25 sittin on the counter. So If Dan comes down this weekend, tis' gong to suck, because my dad isn't paying me like he used to. I'm not complaining mind you, I dont' depend on his money, it's just kind of nice, an extra $125/w is really helpfull. In a way I don't want Dan to come down this weekend, but he might. It's not that i don't want him to come down, it's more along the line, as I won't be able to do anything at all. Because I have to buy woodchips for my rabbit, so that will leave like $20 to myself, plus, we have no food at all, which also totally sucks. Oh well."

"event","<P>Me Matt and Kevin went cruisin on Speedway tonight. We just got back and raced a couple cars.</P>
<P><STRONG>1st encounter</STRONG> was a <U>Mistubishi EVOVIII</U>, some jackassw as driving it swerving in and out of traffic, couldn't really race him but wanted to. <STRONG>2nd encounter</STRONG> was some kind of old <U>Buick Regal V6 Turb</U>o. This car was one fast fucking old grandma car. We saw it accelerate away from us and it totally took us off guard cause it looked like a piece of crap. So we catch a light with him and we both gun it, I pull ahead right away and he stays with me at about my rear bumper. I couldn't believe he was hanging with me. But at about 75mph I pulled away from him and shut down at 100mph and won. Then we saw a cop pull someone over and we freaked out and left speedway. But on the way back we meet out&nbsp;<STRONG>3rd encounter</STRONG>, a riced out <U>Honda Prelude</U> with a body kit. He didn't want to race but then I noticed next to the Prelude was our <STRONG>4th encounter:</STRONG> another <U>SRT-4</U>. It was black, looked stock but it had a Blow-Off Valve. So all the way down 1st Ave we tried running against it but we couldnt get organized so eventually we both stopped in the middle of the road and decided to catch a light. After a lot of failed attempts at racing we finalyl caught a good light and raced. I had Matt and Kevin, an extra 300-ish lbs in my car. So we both floor it and we are dead even he starts pulling on me, but then I regain traction and pull on him leaving him at my rear bumper. I stay ahead until 105mph. Then we both turn into Best Buy on 1st Ave and talk about our cars, it was pretty cool.</P>
<P>So yeah that was it, it was so much fun, I dropped about 1/3 of my gas but oh well, haha.</P>"

I just got back from my car being towed. I'm in such a state of shock right now I can't believe my car broke down again. I don't know if I should keep it or sell it back. I have work in the morning too, god I hate that place. I called my parents to pick me up but they didnt answer when I called 4 times. So right now i felt the need to post on livejournal even thoguh nobody ever reads it I think a few peopel do. So yeah thats been whats going on with me for the past couple weeks.

"event","I think I almost got shanked by a bum.

So me Matt, Andrew, and Kevin were hanging outside peter piper at around midnight. Nevermind what we were doing, but all of the sudden a bum on a bike with a backpack and a full half-gray beard  rides up to us in a coarse voice ""Hey do you guys have any change I can have?""

I gave him 86 cents. Nobody else had anything. So he kept pleading with us for money. Then he was like hey I'll give you guys free newpapers every day I really need the money I want to buy a 40. He sells newspapers on the corner.

Time goes by he won't leave it's been like 30 minutes. By now he's getting into his days in 1980 when he was a Platoon Leader in the Marines in the Afganistan/Russian conflict. This guy was really fucked up, several times he had to kill women and children with bombs strapped to their chest. He's telling us in great detail how it was like in the war.

So he finalyl gets off his bike and puts us into a situational skit. He comes about an inch from ym face his breath reaking of whiskey: ""Let's say this guy here (andrew) is an afgani women. You check her for weapons and you see that she's completely wired with explosives... what do you do?""

""Well I guess I have to shoot ya, Andrew sorry! Lol""

Big mistake.

""You think that's funny boy? If you were in my platoon I would shoot you righ in the head. Boom, your gone. This is nothing to laugh about! Look in my eyes (his pupils were almost non-exostant lol) you don't know shit. I have had to kill peopel with my bare hands like this <mimes a neck breaking>""

<gulp> sorry?

He goes on for another 15 mins about hes haunted by his past and matt, andrew and kevin are all either freaked out, laughing, or trying to stay calm. Cause this guy was drunk he coulda done anything.

He had 2 bullet wounds and 3 or 4 knife scars on his arms. He told me I would make a great fighter pilot. Ok...

It may not sound liek much but if you were there you would agree this was by far, the craziest, drunkest, most fucked up bum ever. I'm leaving a lto of stuff out but I'm not going to go on cause he talked to us for a good 45-60 mins."

BUT FIRST:

-I had a long ass day. First I woke up and got ready for school. Drove down to school and was late for class. Sat through my 3 hour long chemistry class while a fat chick hit on me the entire time. 
-After that class I tried to get help from a counsellor but they took way too long. 
-So I was late for my second class. I think I failed that quiz in the class. 
-After that I went to try to get my classe chanegd again but I was #30 and they were calling #10. So fuck that. 
-Then I went straight to the gym and worked out for an hour. 
-Just enough time to get home and go to work. The bitch at my work sent hoe everyone but me leaving me to clean the entire store after closing. That made me late. 
-But gave me just enoguh time to get home and get dressed to go the U of A at 10:30. I hung out for a while till about 1am. 
-Then on the way home me and matt raced. It was pretty fun. Finally got home at like 1:30

Now I may sleep for another action packed day."

"event","Wow my Car is so fun to drive. I think buying it is the best thing I've done in a long time! I haven't had a chance to really race anyone yet. Not enough willing competitors. Still is fun to floor it once in a while. Driving my car makes all of your problems go away for a little bits it's just.... entrancing. I don't know how long the happiness is going to last with the car I hope for at least the next 6 years, lol. I am kind of disappointed I can't move out but if I can get a good enough job I can live comfortably at home and still have more than enough money for payments. Still haven't been able to wash it. It's been raining for the whole week!

My dad and I are talking about paving the lot next to our house and building a sort of ramp for my car to park behind our house right next to the window of my room. I can't park it on the normal driveway lol. But a little parking space for me would be awesome.

I think I should name my car any suggestions? I would prefer a girl name cause Cars are usually she's.

Oh yeah and I got another New SN:  SuperMachoMan Jr"

<P><STRONG>9. Contra - Nintendo</STRONG><BR>This is an Old ass game, I played it with my cousin when I was like 7 and I still find it fun. It's the game that started all shooting games. But again this is another really really hard game.</P>
<P><STRONG>8. Sonic (All except Sonic Shuffle) - Dreamcast, Genesis, etc.<BR></STRONG>Ok I grew up on this game, Sonic 1,2,3 3-D, Pinball, Racing, Adventure, Adventure 2, I probably missed a couple. Every sonic game I've ever played I've got my money's worth. Except for Sonic Shuffle but that game was $10.</P>
<P><STRONG>7. Legend of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time - Nintendo 64</STRONG><BR>I spent hours as a kid ont his game. This game was great because it stayed fun the entire time even though it was difficult. The reason its so great to me is I can't think of anything to make the game better. It's close to perfection!</P>
<P><STRONG>6. Warcraft III - PC</STRONG><BR>I still play this game and it's really fun. It constantly changes everday and the game never gets old. It's probably the dorkiest game on the list though rofl...</P>
<P><STRONG>5. Wave Race 64 - Nintendo 64</STRONG><BR>Ok none of you guys probably agree with me but I LOVED this game!!!! When it came out the graphics were unrivaled and the physics were dead on. It's my faavorite racing game of all time..... I just soiled myself.</P>
<P><STRONG>4. Goldeneye 007 - Nintendo 64</STRONG><BR>If you don't like this game then you probably are either gay, or you are a girl. This is the best shooting game. Ever. EVER.</P>
<P><STRONG>3. Soul Calibur - Dreamcast</STRONG><BR>The best fighting game ever. EVER. Ok I'll stop doing that.</P>
<P><STRONG>2. Super Punchout - Super Nintendo</STRONG><BR>Hmmm... this game... is... so.. great. If this game never existed I would probably be smoking crack in an ally in Miami. This game is always fun. I wish, I wish so much they'd make a Gamecube Version or something. Well this game USED to be hard but I can beat it in under a half hour. I dont coutn it as a fighting game cause it's in a league of it's own. I cant even explain how good tis game is to me.</P>
<P><STRONG>1. Super Mario 64 - Nintendo 64</STRONG><BR>I got this when I was 12. It chanegd my life. No not really but it's my favorite game of all. There are so many levels, so many stars to get, so many bosses to kill, mini games, everything. This game is the best game ever made in my opinion. It was worth it alone buying a Nintendo 64.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hey let me know what you guys think. For the most part it's a pretty solid list except for a few games that are personal favorites. I'm gonna go play punchout.</P>"

<P><BR>Have you guys ever seen the movie ""Stephen King's IT?"" It's about a clown monster with razor sharp teeth and a creepy voice chasing kids down, kidnapping them, taking them down to his sewer lair, and eating them alive. It's pretty corny and doesn't have great acting. But I saw this movie when I was five years old.....</P>
<P>I was fucked up for years.</P>
<P>So I saw the movie again the other day and it was really crappy. But I went to bed that night and had old nightmares from when I was 6,7,8 years old. Only this time he didn't catch me.</P>

"event","Not much to say really, Thanksgiving was ok. Dunno what to get for Christmas yet. Might see if my dad can help me out with a new car. A fast one preferably (maybe faster than a certain mustang or two that I know of). School is getting hard but it's almost over, just two last weeks of painful hard studying then I can relax. 
Work sucks what else is new. But I came to a realization about work the other day, it's boring and hard but I know i'd miss the place when I quit. I've grown attatched to it and deep down I actually really enjoy working there. Didn't think I'd get that from a min. wage job but I do like it there. 
I gotta start looking into transferring to the U of A if I want to get in by next year. If I do get into the dorms that will be awesome. But you know I think I'm ready to move on from High School now, even though it's already been half a year since graduation."

"event","Gah, life has it's ups and downs and i'm ont he down part. I bought EQ2 today cause I was bored. It was $50. Then I subscribed for a month. That was $15. Then it tells me that even though I have a 128MB Video Card (Min. is 64MB) that my specific type doesn't work. That was an $80 Video Card gone to waste that I have to replace. That will cost me probably $100 if I decide to buy a new one. Then my classes are going to be $650. My books last semester were $400 so I'm hoping for a $300 charge this time.

That's about $1195 that I don't get anything from. Except an Education but we all know college is robbery (general ed isn't even useful). So guys this mean that I'm going Matt style for a while. Until 2005 I am not buying another CD, Video Game, Fast Food Meal, Clothes, or Illegal Substances. The only thing I'll spend money on till next year is Gas and if I get a date with Kelsey then thats an exception."

So I'll try my best to act older starting tomorrow. Let me know how I'm doing."

"event","<P>Hey guys, maybe aroudn my birthday (or later whatever) we can go on a weekend trip to Rocky Point. The houses that are RIGHT ON the beach and sleep 6 people are so awesome. I went last year with my parents the sand is white the water is clear the house is very cool air conditioned, we could bring DVDs, food, beer. They go for $200 per night on weekends. But if that was split between 5 or 6 people it would only cost each of us <FONT color=#3333ff>$60-$80 total </FONT>for both days (Friday Night and Saturday Night till sunday morning).</P>
<P>We could go there swim all day, watch movies, hang out, and then go find local bars and stuff to do during the night. This would rock guys for a couple days its cheap you will spend at most $100 and we'd have a good time. <FONT color=#3333ff>I think it's definatly worth it</FONT>. But I know alot of you guys are cheap...</P>
<P>Well if you guys really, really think this is a stupid Idea then fine I'll eventually go some other time. But just lemme know what you think maybe too much money we could find cheaper place to stay I dont know. The beach houses are very nice.&nbsp; Anyone that wants to come would be cool (Matt, Greg, nathan, Derek, kevin, Gauvin, Dane, richie). I could probably borrow my mom's huge SUV too.</P>
<P>Please post I wanna know what you guys think about it.<BR><BR>Here is a good site for Rocky Point Housing.<BR></A><BR><A href=""http://www.rockypointonline.com/mexico.htm"">Main Page</A></P>"

Some people think it's a nice gesture, but something like that will just piss me off. I hate people telling me what to do, think, believe. This doesnt help at all. If anyone is converted to christanity because he read a Card that some fruit taped to a video game... that person will go to hell anyway for being dumb. I just think that if it any other religiong peope would get pissed off like I am now. I think it would be funny if people did stuf like this though:

http://us.f2.yahoofs.com/users/414a7113zbf35d4b0/9d0f/__sr_/a9ba.jpg?phiUgXBBqiQIKJ3N

Anyone that advertises their religion, whores out bibles, or starts holy wars, obviously isn't confident enough in their beliefs in god because they feel the need to reinforce it by proving other people's religions wrong. Maybe if they truly 100% believed in their religiong they wouldnt feel the need to do any of those things. My point is that this guy that put the card on my video game obviously has doubts about god.

The irony is that he tries to convert little boys into devout christians through video games, but not just any viedo game but with the game ""EVOLUTION."" This prick thinks that any kid who buys a game entitled evolution is some sort of athiest.

Oh and another thing! Mr. God Loves Everyone also charged me $5 shipping... the dick."

Besides that I wanted to do something really fun like go on a trip. Not an expensive one liek Virign Islands, jesus christ... but like Mexico or Las Vegas or California or anything. If you guys have the cash I think it would be sweet to go spend a few days out of crappy Tucson sometime before Thanksgiving. Lemme know if you guys want to I think it would be really fun."

I haven't been able to work with Kelsey for like 2 weeks so it sucks really bad =(. But yesterday, this chick that comes in alot to talk to me and bug the shit our of me finally asked me out to a movie and I made up the worst excuse of all time: ""Um, I don't think I can go I usually go see movies with my friends "" wait that's not even an excuse I just said something so she'd get the idea. She's like wierd and dorky and stuff and so annoying, but&nbsp;I wasn't mean i was modest about it. But she still seemed sad or mad I don't know I couldnt tell cause the glasses she wears give her six eyes (Not 4 eyes like 6 or maybe 8.. theyre HUGE). Seriosuly it's not worth it, she has a vagina but shes freakin just wierd.</P>"

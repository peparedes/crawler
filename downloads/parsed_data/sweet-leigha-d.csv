"event","so... i sorta forgot all about this whole journal thing. i haven't been online in a long time, so i haven't updated. My grandparents just got me a brand new computer so i thought i might use it.

Im living it up out here, really. Enjoying my spoiling. i have decorated the basement like my own place and i stay down there most of the time, like a little hermit- only coming upstairs to eat or leave. Im really lucky to have it like it is. My grandma sneaks me money and tells me not to tell my grandpa, and my grandpa sneaks me money and tells me not to tell my grandma. DONT WORRY FOLKS, SECRET'S SAFE WITH ME! Also, we always have plenty of fruity pebbles- WHICH ARE DELICIOUS. it's because old people shop at sam's, where you have to get cereal by the truck load, and whatnot. It's important to me to have an abundance of sugary cereals in my living quarters.

I was housesitting while mama and papa went to florida and i didnt mean to, but i sort of broke every rule my grandparents set. I had a party and everyone got WASTED and ended up crashing here, AND i let steve stay over every night for 11 days. I guess im not the model child, but i covered my tracks pretty well. putting evidence of the events on the internet is a grand idea eh? 

I decided i wanted to slow down on the partying for a while. That stuck for about 4 days, and then i got drunk off my ass on 151 out at Greenman's in fairborn. Oops. Oh well, at least i was able to quit smoking. Smoking was definatly the worst of my vices anyway.

I will have 3 new brothers and a step father in one week!~ mom's wedding is on Saturday. Im so thrilled. She put me in charge of music, which has me wracked with nervousness over the perfect wedding song to sing during the ceremony.. (any ideas?)She is going to hawaii for their honeymoon, and i guess i will be babysitting all the kids a lot, which is fine. Mom deserves it.

In other news, im still hanging out with lisa and jen a lot. Jen got a job at bdubs with me. So, everyone has to stop in and see us! We usually work the same shifts. lisa is involved in some tshirt selling business. She also is dating someone new. I haven't talked to liz much, on account mostly of conflicting schedules and bc steve hates her guts. Mostly i hang out with steve whenever i have a free moment. I like him a little. :)in fact, i think i might marry him. ya know- or somethin.

I need to register for fall classes and such. i think i will do that now before i get distracted.

later tators...

"event","welp, im all moved into my grandma's basement. Thanks to the fam and my friends for all their help. Couldnt have done it without my Jen and my Bri! Feel free to buy me expensive house warming gifts, all! lol...

I know that this was the right choice for me. I have so much more focus out here where its quiet. I have already put in 3 hours of exam study time, and i have only lived here one day. now i can really apply myself to school work, plus it is only 10 minutes away from E wood. I will miss my family a lot... it's hard to move away from your mom's house. I just think it was the best course of action for me. even if mommmy isnt here to tuck me in anymore. My grandparents pretty much leave me be, and i come and go as i please. I just worry that i will be perpetually bored here in the summer. Work isnt giving me very many hours and all the summer courses were full. I will have to take up knitting or something.

SO...
I spent half the night babying steve (he is still sick with some virus) and half the night decorating downstairs. My grandparents have really been liberal about me having the downstairs. They have let me re-do everything. It was a lot of work, but i like the way it turned out. Next i just need to have a big party down there to celebrate...

Today, i have to work for a few hours, but other than that, im free to enjoy whats left of the weekend.
Maybe i will uh... walk around the yard or grind meat with my grandma. Yeah, so maybe it isnt all that exciting here, but i will make it work. Steve is coming by in a bit to hang out for a while. 

Anyway, i hope that everyone is having a good weekend... later!!

"event","the latest chapter of Leigha's life? moving. I decided that it would be a bad idea to try to live independently and make rent through college- especially since i will be responsible for a lot of my school funding now. I was going to live with my mom and jim, but they would have to build an addition onto Jim's house, since there are so many of us kids. He wants everyone to enjoy the luxury of their own room. I dont want him to have to spend all that money, when i will probably be married in a few years. 

My grandma gave me an offer i couldn't refuse. She offered me her entire basement to decorate and keep up as i want (its really big, and all finished)AND she said she will buy me a new computer for school. I will have a living room, two bedrooms, a bath and kitchen area. Also, there is work out equipment down there, and a game area with ping pong and stuff. Basically, I will get to enjoy the same freedoms i would have living alone, and a lot less money trouble.And i get toys!

One down side is that I guess i will be living by a curfew now, but it isnt strict. I just have to be in by 2:30 or 3 am. Not bad, and it might keep me more regulated. Half the time, i'm rolling in around 5 in the morning now days. 

It seems like it would be a lot easier if Steve and i could live together. He is looking to move, and so am i, and we are constantly together anyway. But alas, the code of ethics my family imposes on me dictates that i can NEVER live with a boyfriend before marraige. I guess that is morally correct. I just really see it with him. Forever. It hasn't even been two months, and im so in love. We talk about marraige and kids, and forever. That should be scary, but im just so happy with him! well, enough mush and gush!I know everyone hates that.

My mom called me ""burnt toast"" yesterday. She came home from work, and i was high as a kite. Just laying there on the couch, like i had no cares in the world. I was supposed to be babysitting, but my sisters pretty well tend to themselves. I went directly toward my bedroom when she came in, but she saw that my eyes were bloodshot.

She reacted really strangly. She crawled into bed with me and told me some story about when i was a baby. it made me sort of sad. Then she tickled me and said something about sewing wild oats. I just wanted her to stay there until i fell asleep and tell me more goofy stories. It was a weird feeling.

I drove to school today in a daze- listening to my ben folds and chain smoking. I started thinking about school and about my living situation. I think i made the right choice to move in with my grandma, but i will miss my mom. I will miss Hailey and libby too, but mostly my mom. Sure i will have all that space, and a feeling of freedom- but the house i have lived in for 10 years will be sold and strangers will live there. It just makes me sad in a really juvenile way. I just feel that place in my bones. That was where my mom and I learned how to live with and then without a male presense. I guess i will be fine. I just have to adjust.

Anyway, i just had an exam and it went pretty well. I need to get down to the lab and finish steve's music paper. (Im building our future, one good grade at a time) I also need to register for the summer. I figure, since there is really no need to work my ass off anymore, i can catch up with school, and keep myself occupied.

After school, im going to fairborn to babysit for my cousin makaylee, and then to get my hair trimmed and highlighted.(yay, priss time!)

i hope that everyone has a super fantastic day!
keepsit real~

To all the people that keep me going everyday: steve, jen, lis, Liz, brian, and others.... Thank you! im sorry if i take you for granted. You are truly loved and appreciated!"

"event","i came here to my aunts today, soley to write in this journal. (my computer is still down) I told everyone that i needed to study, but the truth is, I drove 20 minutes just to get a few moments of introspection. I haven't felt like myself lately. 

Seems like i spend a lot of time trying to decide if i am happy. Isn't that just something you ... know? Sometimes, it's hard to tell. The jury in my head is still deliberating. I think that even if pure joy fell out of the heavens and onto my lap- pure joy wrapped with shimmering gold paper, and bows and ribbons- i probably would be very hesitant to open the gift. I would eye the box with suspiscion until all the happiness leaked out of it, and it was just a container.Im not good at accepting a good thing. Seems like all good things have a catch.

My mom will be married for the fourth time in July, to a man who is truly remarkable. I keep waiting for the catch in their situation. I scrutinize Jim for flaws. Watch him very closely. My findings?  His character is nearly impecable. I just can't understand why love took so long to find my mother. 

I was in the shower yesterday, and i turned the wrong knob (stick with me here, it will get better) and the water scolded me all over, like a thousand needles. When i stepped out of the bath, the air from the vent cooled my burning skin, and I was reminded that a person must experience the burn to truly appreciate relief. Im not positive that makes sense, but it works in my mind. Cold water feels much better on a hot day. Food is much more delicious when you are starving. It's the priciple of patience and reward. Maybe that is the reason that my mom had to wait so long- why my mother had to drag me with her on her journey through hell. just to get to where she is now. 

I guess my prize is waiting for me someday. Maybe my prize is steve? Im not really sure.  I have come to terms with the fact that i just don't trust easily. I watch my enemies closly and my friends even closer. Maybe my prize won't come in the form of a man. Maybe my prize will be looking in the eyes of my son or daughter and feeling that everything was worhwhile and beautiful. I guess it isn't important to be sure right now. For now, i will just be content with being content. I tend to overanalyze everything. I wish i could give my brain a break. That's probably why i smoke so much pot. Just to get a release from all my worry.

Last night, i went over to judson's with some folks and sat around the fire. I invented an interesting game called the ""cell game"" (I was the nucleus, and Lisa was the mitochondria). The person i picked for the role of ""cell wall"" did a really poor job of keeping all the bad elements from penetrating our circle. Maybe i should have held auditions. Yes, i was drunk and stoned. Everything just floated by. Even the time. I didnt even make it to my house until nearly 5 and i STILL wasn't sober. Im just glad i had steve there to take care of me. It was just too much fun.

On friday, after work, I went to Jeremy's going away party, and had a really good time. Im gonna miss you, buddy!! I can't believe he is already leaving for the army. 

I also hung out with my gals and my steven a lot. Cash is getting low. Im not too humble to take donations. Steve knows that is a fact~!!

SO yeah, im gonna go do some studying now. Maybe get my life on track in a single sitting.
love yall... and feel free to comment or give some advice...

"event","HEY ALL~*~*~*!!
yep, computer is still broken... it really sux! i miss chattin online with my pals~! It was like my sole method of communication with some folks. If i haven't talked with you in a while and you are home from college for the summer- be sure to call me so we can hang out!

Since i quit the dealership, i have had lots more free time than im used to. Its a nice release to be less tied up with everything, but im starting to feel lazy. I will have to find more work soon. Yesterday, i had N_O_T_H_I_N_G of any urgency to do. I woke up and thought ""Oh man, im late for... Nothing. That's a first."" 

I drove to jason's house to let him have the notes for the class we share (because im a nice person, and always skips class, while i attend like a true scholar *wink*), but he was being a TOTAL dick to me, so i left and asked him to ""kindly never speak to me again""...Or something to that effect. WHY DO I EVEN BOTHER TRYING TO BE HIS FRIEND!? exes are not friends. Just ask steve his philosophy on Greg and i being friends. *sigh*

I went directly to steve's house and then WE had a fight.( i swear we are in love, we just bicker every day... its fine!) Apparently, he doesnt find me to be an honest person. I told him i only fabricate NOW AND THEN to emphasize my point. Little white lies to beef up a story. Ya know, like in that movie- ""Big Fish"". in fact, JUST like that.I just want my stories to be interesting, but i will tell you the truth if you ask. No one ever does ask.

He just said i need to stop exaggerating altogether, otherwise he can't trust me. Hmph. Well, ok, but my stories are going to SUCK. We kissed and made up. Then we did a little more of that...mmmm

Then I went to the Y to swim with lisa, my sisters, steve, jen, and judson. It was a really good time. Even if lisa does kick my ass, swimming laps!

We all went to eat, and then played beach volleyball at the park. We all split up to shower (thats a relief), and then met back up to ""smoke cigarettes"" in lisa's office... Oh sweet cigarettes. Steve and i left lisa's and went to his house. Everything after that point is kinda a blur, but i remember trying to watch a movie called ""lost in translation"". Didn't get much out of it.

The day before, i lounged around in the sun all day, tanning, and played kickball with some of the neighborhood kids. I sat around and read a novel on the porch, and got to have dinner out with my gals...WHOSE LIFE IS THIS?! im getting restless tho... i asked for more hours at the restaurant. As liz said (she and i made amends) lots of kids dont even go to work- just school. I can't really imagine. I would be so bored.

SO yeah, i dont really have any life altering news to report. oh, except that My aunt is now cancer free, so thanks for all the prayers everybody! and other than that, it's been the same old stuff... im kinda breaking away from some of my old friends. I guess you could say a few people have given up on me. It hurts, but i don't care. if they dont stick with me, they weren't ever my true friends. Im having a good time, and if my lifestyle isnt congruent with their vision of me, maybe they never took the time to really know me. They are the ones that need to adjust, or back off. Meagan for instance, doesnt agree with the pot or drinking, but she supports and encourages me with school and work and song writing. She just prays that i will find the strength to quit doing the ""other things"". I respect that. On the other hand you have ppl like erik, who have to bash me and call me names to get the point across, as if verbal abuse will make me repent.

                    ANYWAY!
A few days ago, I went to the doctor and had a checkup. He put me on the pill... (everyone can sleep better now- Steve and i won't be reproducing any time soon!) im nervous that im gonna gain weight, but oh well. 5 pounds, or 45 and a kid...better to be safe than sorry. I just never thought i would be in this position.

yeah, so last week to fill ya in- we went to the drive in, and that was fun. (me: ""STEVE, JUST GET IN THE TRUCK"") Securtity guards are very nosy! Van helsing was really gay, i thought.

Everyone has been playing poker a lot, and im just not in on that. I dont have the money or the patience.

 Matt and jen are still...dating (?). Im not sure what to call them, but we went out together a few times. 

Last weekend, Lisa had a party, while her parents were out of town, and i went to wright state with steve twice. One time to play cards at his friend- joe's, and the other for maydays.  Prolly a couple kareoke nights, but that is about all. 

Oh i forgot to mention that i have been pulled over 3 times in the last week. NICE. my headlight is out. Maybe i should fix that. Maybe i also should not speed.

welp everyone, have a fabulous day!! i know i will, what with my exam.
xoxox

love you lisa, jen, liz! love you baby!
leave me something!
countdown till my mom moves out: 2 months!"

"event","wow, i haven't written in a while. My computer at home is all messed up. The only chance i have to write is this break between classes on Tuesday. Anyone wanna volunteer to fix it? i will pay you with cookies! Who doesn't like cookies?

Today is my last day at smedley's... Im kinda sad, but also eager to be done with it all. I hope i dont get really sentimental as im leaving. I thought maybe i would celebrate hard core at Bolt's tonight for kareoke... Get really trashed and what not. Act ridiculous. But then i realized that it isnt really an event if you do that everynight. So i guess i will just behave like normal, and see where that takes me. Lol.. but seriously folks- steve and i are trying to cut down on the partying. So are lisa and jen. THIS IS ONLY A PHASE!

To catch up- Mostly i have been spending time with steve, trying to catch up on school work, and chillin with the girls (minus liz). Im happier now than i can remember being in a long time. Steve is fabulous for me... i just love him to death, and everyday it gets better. As for my bestest gals in the world: Jen's birthday was on Sunday and Lisa and i got her a SHITLOAD of stuff. To name a few things- tommy girl perfume, a changepurse, ice cream cups (jen is the ice cream queen), flip flops, tickets to see Tim Mcgraw with us in july, a shirt, lip gloss, pens, a frame with our favorite song in it, a stuffed unicorn that says ""happy birthday jen, i love you!"" and it goes on... It was so worth it when she saw the basket of stuff and started to cry. I can't wait till my birthday rolls around, girls! lol...

I also bought steve and i tickets to the Ben folds concert. It was supposed to be a surprise, but he tickled it out of me. I can't wait- im so excited! June 19 is the day!

I stayed the night at Steves this weekend, and his mom didn't even mind... Of course, it wasn't the first night i stayed (i have maybe 4 times) but she KNEW, and she was cool about it. I have a toothbrush at his house now. Never had my toothbrush at a boy's house before. It blows my mind... She says as long as were safe then its all fine.  She also said that she likes me best of all of Steve's girlfriends. Of course, she kinda has to say that. But still, i was floored. Steve says ""my mom approves, you're trapped""... he doesnt have to trap me, im all his! lol My mom really likes steve too. He is so polite, and always comes to play with my sisters. Prolly gives them more attention than i do. (that says a lot- since im home all the time and all- NO)

I love being with him so much. It doesnt even effect me that jason wants to get back together. I used to think i would drop anyone for jason, but now i know that people fall in and out of love, and accept breakups at a different pace. I know that he just wants me bc i have someone else, and i wouldn't be without steve for the world! 

Moving on- Last night i went bowling with the crew (matt, jen, lisa, jeremy, judson, steve, eric, greg, justin, etc) and the night before, i chilled at steve's after work, bc i was so tired. Everyone went to the yellow rose, but i just felt like sleeping. Well, not JUST sleeping. I sorta do wish i had gone to the club- just to see what was happening. I hate feeling left out. That's why i try to do EVERYTHING. 

My aunt amie had her surgery and she is doing well. Im going to visit her tomorrow. I appreciate everyone who expressed concern over the whole thing. I was really worried. She is in the best spirits, and i hope she recovers well.

on another note, i hope im not pregnant. Just thought i would throw that out there. We have been safe... cept a few times, when we weren't.  I cant have a baby, i can't even dress myself properly. Having a kid would definately curtail my partying behavior. I would have to put a stop to this carousing-late-at-night thing. Steve: ""wouldn't want to hurt the baby..."" me: ""Dont talk about the baby! There is no baby!"" lolol... really, its not funny.

oK, well, steve is out of class now, and im gonna go meet him. Dont leave comments in my journal like ""you and steve need to be careful."" we know.

later tators- until next week!

"event","hey all! im so glad its finally sunday- the day of rest. I need some relaxation, after the craziest weekend...

Thursday night, i got off of work, having put my two weeks in-officially- at smedley's (later cars)...I met up with jen and lisa for some drinks, and a lil' waffle house. I ended up staying at steve's dad's house over night. Mom LOVED that. i just was in no condition to drive anywhere. Woke up next to my baby Friday morning, feeling really great (if a little gross, from the lack of showering), and went with him to sinclair for his morning class. I got to spend the whole day with him, and didn't even get sick of him at all. We hung out with some of his friends, and he got to witness my mom and i fight. (he'll get used to it) He said ""if you ever need someone to cry on, or talk to...I can probably find you someone"" LOL...Now that he has seen me at my worst, i feel a ton more comfortable with him.

A friend called me from work and asked if she could have my evening hours, and i was like... WELL YEAH. I went up to jeremy's around ten for his party, and steve came later. Ya know who else came? jason. I didn't mind, except that i was afraid it would make steve feel awkward. It did, but... oh well, i didn't make up the guest list. While i was gettin exceptionally drunk and high, jason and liz were hitting it off quite nicely, i noticed. Of course, steve thought i was hitting on jason, just bc i was talking to him, but in all actuality, he was being a total dick to me. Anyway, i wouldnt ever cheat on steve. I just care about him too much. 

Later, i come to find out that Jason and liz kissed that night. well, thats fine. Just date ALL my exes. Dustin, greg, now jas? no big deal, liz. UGHHHHHHH! see, its not jealousy. Its the principle of the fuckin thing. I want jason and liz to both be happy, but NOT WITH EACH OTHER. She was my best friend (once). YOU NEVER date a best friend's ex. ITS AN UNSPOKEN RULE! hello? lol... i guess im just being selfish. I know that they are both lonely, and im sure it hurts to see me be happy with someone. (passive aggressive, much?)

Around one, steve drove me in my car back to his mom's... Once again, i stayed the night, bc i was trashed. Noticing a trend? We had a lot of fun, altho i didn't get much sleep.

 I had an incredible night, altogther, even tho i was pretty intoxicated (or maybe BECAUSE i was) Nice quote from jen- ""jeremy's face is like the mulch in the dirt Or the face in the mulch. And this sky is like picasso."" Yeah, it makes no sense, don't try to decipher it. She was wasted too.lol... GOOD TIMES FOR ALL!

Saturday, i woke up next to my sweetie, and he was smiling at me, and it was just perfect! man, that guy is friggin great. i worked ALL day- and then met up with some ppl after Bw3's to go hang out. I kinda had a bad night from that point on. I was just really tired and emotional, and i wasnt thinking clearly. 

I get a call from jason around one. He tells me that he doesn't know what he thinks of liz, and that he just misses me. He says that he is sorry for being a dick at the party, but that he hated to see the ""girl he loves being held by someone else."" i can understand that. I can even understand why he kissed liz. He told me he really regrets that we didnt give it another shot, before i got with steve. He implied that he still wants to be with me, and that kinda pissed me off, bc it's like he is asking me to break up with my boyfriend. well, for the longest time, i wanted him back... now he can taste his own medicine, and see my be happy.

Anyway, the conversation ended with jason saying that if he and i will never be together again, he doesnt see the point of continuing a friendship. With that, he hung up on me. Oh yeah, but he did tell me he still loved me first, and gave me a lecture about my lifestyle. 

He is right about a few things. One, steve will probably not ever stop smoking up, and if im with him, i may not either. That isnt really the life i see for myself, in the long run. Jason was also right when he held his ground about the breakup in the first place. We don't belong together, and he was smart enough to recognize it once. Jason also informed me that i dont love steve. Good to know. 

anyway, i decided to try and quit smoking again. Its a hard thing, but i think i can do it if i really try. Like jeremy says ""if you can't stop for a week, you are a pussy, leigha."" if i can stop for a week, i can go longer. Eventually, i will be a NON smoker. It will be good to be able to run and sing again. (bc i did a LOT of running... lol)

So yeah the smoking thing is one resolution, and the other is that jen and i are going to try to eat right and exercise more frequently. Im going to throw one more promise on the pile... I may talk about my exes in here, but i wont talk to steve about them. I know it hurts him. 

Yeah, so wish me luck. That is a lot to try to accomplish. Notice i haven't promised to altogether quit partying, but i plan to settle down a bit. My mom is getting very testy at me coming home with my clothes on from the night before and what not. 

Everyone, have a good day, and leave me something.

"event","I think the last time i wrote in here was almost a week ago.  A lot has happened in that week. Im gonna break it down into sections.

WORK: I quit my job at the dealership. I had worked there for 9 months, and i just got burnt out. I know that's not the best reason to quit a job, but also, my grades were slacking from all the hours of work, and the pay wasn't that great. Im going to take a little break from working so much (just work at bw3's 15 hours a week) and focus on school. When it's time for me to take over the house payment, i have a few options. I can work as a teller for my aunt's bank, or i can be a secretary at this doctor's office in dayton. Either way, the pay will be much better. I still have to put in my two weeks at the dealership. It makes me sad to think i won't see my smedley's folk anymore. And i can't sit in the corvettes anymore either...Oh well, greener pastures.

DATING: Steve and i are doing well. can i say that? ""doing well""? *wink*. He has the biggest heart in the world. Im just scared bc things are going pretty fast. Im so comfortable with him, already. I just adore the guy. I have this picture of him that i stole from his house, and i carry it around with me to show him off to my friends. He is so cute. LOL...He told me he loved me for the first time the other day. It freaked a few of my friends out, but i was expecting it. I knew that's where we were headed. I really think i love him too. He is just the best thing i have known in a long time, and at the very least i love THAT. What we have. He really hates it that i still talk to Jason and greg. If they call, he gets so sour. I suppose i shouldnt answer, (sometimes i dont) but i really think he should just trust me. I wouldn't cheat on him. I have a good thing, im not going to ruin it. Jason has been gettin awfully nostalgic lately. He wants to talk a lot. I think he must miss me. It sucks bc for so long, i wanted him to want me. It took me finding someone and becoming happy for him to realize the way he felt. Don't know what you've got till it's gone...

SCHOOL: going ok, i suppose. I don't hate it as much as i used to. I get up, and i don't dread coming in. It's just the work outside of the building that i hate. I can't get motivated unless im there. Problem? yeah, since i have two online classes. Maybe i will drop those.

FRIENDS: Last friday night, Jen and i went to columbus with steve and judson, and that was good times. Until, of course, it occured to me that i had to be at work at 9 in the morning on saturday. I got back to steve's from columbus and slept for 2 hours before going in. That was a good day. I worked almost 9 hours at smedley's and then 7 at bw3's. At four in the morning, i had to go pick up steve and judson and justin, bc they had driven out to columbus again, and steve's car ""broke down"". I didnt mind, except that i was REALLY TIRED. Justin didn't keep me company on the ride home. He was practically comatose. All in all, it was pretty crazy. Partying in at OSU was so ridiculous. How does anyone get things done there? i wouldnt ever do school work! I drank and smoked so much that night. I was in no shape to be on the road, but we couldnt find anywhere do stay. It was just a bad decision to go that night, but i had a lot of fun.

Mostly with the gals it's been gossiping over coffee at waffle, Bolt's for kareoke, and playing cards at jeremy's house. We went to the mall two days ago, and we spent WAY too much money. Lol... cumulative spending? prolly 600 dollars. Hey, that's what we do best. Liz has been really busy with the show at sinclair. I dont get to see her like i would like too. I know she was mad at me for a while, but we sorted that out, and now we just miss each other. I keep remembering my first trip to chicago. We were closer than sisters. SO much fun. If you read back in my journal, its all about her. Sucks how schedules conflict, and ppl become too busy for each other. It's no one's fault. She is sorta dating matt now (so cute) and i have steve. It's hard to make time for all.

I met all of steve's dudes (or at least some) and they seem really cool. I like hanging out with them, so that is a good thing. I don't know what they think of me. It prolly doesnt matter that much.

anyway, i need to do something productive. It's been real!

later all

love my gals (jenuine, lisa, and lisabeth!) and my baby!"

"event","BAlexander09: I am wating for this journal, like a 16 year old waits for a NSYNC album in 1999

JenNichole5203: are u writing in your journal
JenNichole5203: because i want to read a new entry

BountyHunter4JC: copuld you put your new lyrics in your livejournal?

yeah, about that...im not sure i want to do this whole journal thing, anymore. Lately, i've realized that i can't detail many events from my life in here without offending anyone or something. I just think there is so much i can't say, and so little i can- that it doesnt accurately depict my life at all. This may be my last entry...(sorry if anyone cares) 

Everything has been sort of hazy a while... its not just the pot i have been smoking (like it's my job)... its life. I can't explain it. I feel so incredibly elated one minute, and then it's like im plunging to the center of the earth. I get so low. Im not manic. Docs covered that base. I guess im just really emotional and sensitive. I sort of hate it, bc i have a tendancy to carry everyone's burdens on my back. I just really feel for people, and become attatched really easily too. Maybe there is some truth in Greg's comment that i date ppl that need help... i want to feel like im accomplishing something. It was kind of disheartening tho, to have it put like that. Like my boyfriends are losers. I have always had the upmost respect for the guys i date. I do, however, like having to delve deeper than what meets the eye, to see what really lies beneath in a guy. I like seeing a diamond in the rough. I like polishing it up, and making it pretty. 

If this makes no sense, im really sorry. im just really high. It's probably againist my better judgement to write about that- but my judgement is so impaired right now. lol... i just ate a tremendously gross assortment of food. How disgusting am i? wow. TWINKIES!

I think maybe i will continue to write and just hold nothing back. Maybe i will pretend not to care what anyone thinks, and just let it all out...But then, im vulnerable to everyone's gossip, input, and CHRITICISM... gee, that word is hard to spell. Somehow the caps makes it more difficult.

Ever feel like you are just floating? yeah, that's the magic carpet i speak of. That feeling of coasting down a a hill on your bike with no hands?? Now we understand the secret meanings behind some phrases in my prior entries... (you feel special, sherlock?) Its just this thing that is really gripping, and really hard to get away from. I understand now why people do weed all the time. Its an intriguing state of mind. And then one day, you wake up, and your dumb. And you think... ""hm, today bears a striking resemblence to yesterday.""

I went to steve's tonight, and we weren't connecting very well. It was weird. I feel like he thinks he's superior to me. He always correcting me and making fun of me and then says ""hey, just kidding"", like that makes it cool...i consider myself a tough gal that can take a joke, but it gets kinda old. It makes me feel insecure. He says ""dont change anything, i like who you are"" but ten seconds later its ""dont do that, its so annoying"". Why can't someone just like who i am?? ( i was JUST talkin to jen-uine about this!... lol Jen-uine sounds like a rap name.)

I dunno, Steve gives me butterflies, and i really like him, but its like he is disappointed in me. I can't shake the feeling that im already letting him down. I guess im just being paranoid. When its good, its so good.

well, i need to stop thinking about it. Tomorrow i get to sleep in, and that will be fabulous. Today was the day from hell. I went to school and it was a little awkward being there with steve AND jason. We were outside in the courtyard, and jason came to visit. I don't know if jas knew i was with steve, but he does now. I sort of feel bad. i didnt want to shove it in his face, but he was just there all of a sudden. After class, i sat outside with steve for a while, and then drove home to go to work. I was in such a hurry that i hit my mom's car with mine in the driveway. I scraped the shit out of it, and the sound was awful. I felt so terrible. The damage isnt bad, but ..uh, hello- earth to dumbass. How do you hit a car PARKED behind you? as if my mom isnt stressed enough. wow. i thought i could maneuver around it. Seems i forgot that i MISERABLY failed my maneuverability on the driver's test. 

LOL...So i get to work half hour late, my car all scraped up, and immediately the guys are laughin at me. I feel so cool, of course. heh.

so im sittin there with a ton of shit to do, and i have to also do my taxes... (bout time) and get them to the post office in vandalia by 12. As i am trying to find my way there, somehow i end up in the ""long term parking"" area at the airport. GOOD. I had to pay a dollar to get out of the lot and back on the right track.

I manage to get the taxes in and i practically kissed the postmark guy who stamped my envelope. WHAT A RELIEF. I felt like such a hick turning them in this late. I had a hard time finding the adress for the federal papers. I almost adressed them to ""Mr. George W., 1600 pennsylvania ave- tax division- washington DC"" lol...with a side note on the envelope ""PS, try to send my tax return check ASAP, mommy needs a new pair of shoes! YEEEHAW~!"" for the record... i didnt.

After the mail shit, I manage to get to Jen's in one piece, but im still really stressed. (wow, when did i start writing in the present progressive tense?) We prettied ourselves up, and went to meet lisa. I ended up smoking, so that i could ease up a bit. It was a nice release, but i should have laid off... maybe that was the reason for all the shit with steve tonight. I tend to overanalyze when im messed up. Or else just to sit there in a daze like a piece of broccoli. 

Man, this entry is digressing quickly... anyway, Have a good night, everyone. If i don't write ever again, thanks for listening to my shit, and giving me feedback! love you all!


xoxo~

new lyrics-
(for the band) 

song of the stars 
whispered to the sun
You can tell me all your truths
and i will be the one
that wont betray you 
wont let you down
You be my sky
i'll be your ground

song of the stars
whispered to the moon
the night sky is intoxicating
it breathes like me and you
I cannot feel 
like this again
hold me now or never
then 
let me go
to let me know
nothing dies without a dying breath

this is my chance
to take or lose
this is my life 
to waste or use
Take from me all that you can
i'll be gone before
you find out who i am"

"event","GOOD MORNING ALL! it is tuesday, 11 am. You know where i am? school, and i'm lovin it. Woke up at 9 like- hm, i'm def supposed to be somewhere...SCHOOL! Lol... 

SO yeah, the whole thing with Greg proposing to rachel was supposed to be a joke on me. HAHAH. wow, im rolling. Actually, it was supposed to be a mean joke. IN THAT CASE- man, am i ever pissed. well. no.

thing is i didnt care much (in a personal interest sense), so that really flew back in his face. I just want him to be happy, and he continually talks about how unhappy he is with her, so gettin married isnt exactly the logical step. I guess my reaction was ""wow, you are an idiot, greg""... that was about it.

in other news, yesterday was an emotional roller coaster. I slept till 12, did some homework, went shopping (hooker skirt-5 bux) and then went to work. I was feeling a little out of it, so i took a couple caffeine pills. (theres yer trouble, addict) I was in the weirdest mindset EVER at work. i was tired so i would have like moments of zoning out and then suddenly, the caffeine would gimme a rush, and i was off the walls. My managers said i was scaring off the customers. And i said ""what customers?"" ... they loved that. Anyway, i was rather productive. i did some spring cleaning and rennovating. after work, i went to waffle with jen and liz, and liz was really upset. She wouldnt tell me what was the matter, except she mentioned a few issues with greg. It sux, bc she wont talk to me anymore. 

Jen and i don't know how to help her. She is just really lonely and depressed. I feel responsible for her, but i don't know how to help. I think she is also somewhat angry bc we have always been in the same situation, but now i have someone and im really happy with him, and she is still single. Im not saying that to be rude, and i know it sounds bad, but if i were in her shoes, i would feel a little resentful. Either way, i kinda feel like i can't really talk about steve, bc it upsets her. I also cant talk about much of anything without upsetting her. I sort of stopped trying. Im always here, but i cant offer to help all the time and get shot down. She has to want me to be her friend.

After waffle, i went to steves and i ended up crying half the night. I feel bad for liz and that was upsetting. I feel bad for some of my actions in the past week. (hint: i dont remember exactly what i should be regretting in detail) I feel bad, bc my pastor expects more of me, and i expect more of me, and there are so many plans with the house and with my mom and her wedding, and im always at work, and this thing with steve is so new- and im scared to get hurt again... WHEW... yeah, so i just kinda cried there. It felt good to let it out. Steve told me a huge secret that i can't tell anyone, and i wont, but it is kind of a burden for me. he confided in me, and i respect that, but I feel like i have to carry this thing now too, and not tell anyone. Its a really big deal, and i cried that he has to live with it. We did this thing where we just stared at each other for a few minutes, not talking or kissing or moving. it really grounds you and connects you to someone to stare into their eyes. I love it. (random i know, but it was comforting.)

I drove home listening to that song ""vaccum bag"" by stroke 9... and thinking about all the ppl i have ever let down. Ever do that? just think about all the times you have said forever, when you should have said ""for right now""... I sort of feel like a liar. Steve tried to tell me that everyone does that, and its a mistake that ppl just make, bc they feel that way at the time, but it doesnt seem to justify it. I wonder about why feelings dont hold.

AnYwAy...
i need to go read or something, before i think myself into a frenzy again... later!

"event","brian, thanks for the comment/correction. NOTED. im sorry that i failed to mention all of our funny events. Im a little distracted. lol... It was so good to have you home! i can't wait till you come back to visit again. You left so abruptly! i miss you already!! Seagulls FOREVER!

i went to easter dinner on both sides of my family yesterday. Steve wanted to go and meet my ""ppl"". They all adored him (i knew they would) and i got to meet steve's parents too. We had a pretty good time. He is so polite and social to adults. I love it. 

Yah, so later- i went to jens for a while- and proceeded to consume a lil wine while playing cards. I didn't drink much, but i hadn't really eaten, so i got a little tipsy. Lisa came over, and we met up with steve and judson. Of course, we ""took a ride on the magic carpet"". Lol...we played cards at jens, (ARE YOU QUESTIONING MY CARD PLAYING ABILITIES?? -thats all i remember)
and i mostly watched in a daze- enthralled with my ham sandwich. HAPPY JESUS DAY! I noticed that Jen and judson have a little chemistry. we might have to go on a double date. Or a triple date, if we find lisa a good man. 

Yeah, needless to say, today i kinda feel like shit. Im gonna lay down for a while, and then do my homework, visit lisa, and go to work.

bye all!

"event","hey all! Happy easter! i just got home from church, and it was the best service~! my church is so high energy- i love it!I hadn't been on a sunday in a long time, and i was afraid it would be weird, but everyone was so welcoming and warm toward me.

Now i remember why i grew to love my church in the first place. So what if im the only white person there? Talk about soul music, and convicting sermons! And talk about fancy shoes... (i swear- black women have the BEST shoes.)Plus, i secretly LOVE being called 'sister leigha'. I should be tired right now, bc i didnt get to bed unil 5 this morning, but i have ""OH HAPPY DAY"" stuck in my head hard core. I can't sleep thru that tune.

Steve and i made ourselves an official couple yesterday morning. Im really happy. He is one of the most unique ppl i have ever met. Never encountered a personality like his. I hope it lasts.I think it's a shock to a lot of ppl, bc they would have never put us together, but it really clicks. We have been spending a lot of time together tho, and im afraid im smothering him. He said he feels like he is crowding me. I guess when we get burnt out, we will take a break.

In other news, Greg gave up on his conquest for me (the unattainable prize) and decided i was a waste of his... well, life. Nice to know. Anyway, in a rather rash decision- greg proposed to rachel. He essentially told me on the phone that if he couldnt have me then he would take his second best match. Im sure she LOVES that...

well, im gonna go do some family things, and change out of this dress!
later

I love my life, and i love the people in it- old and new. I love my friggin jobs, i even love sinclair. NO ppl, im not back on zoloft. I don't know what's come over me!

My grandparents did decide to let me and a few friends move in this house, when my mom moves in with jim. I can work at GM on weekends and live here by myself (i would be making more money on weekends at GM than working all week at both my jobs)OR I can keep the jobs i have now and live with others. I think the latter, but i am not sure. ANY IMPUT?

Well, im gonna go get my check and head out to dinner with the girls!! We have been out everynight really late, and im sure tonight will be no exception- so peace!

"event","And out of nowhere at all: i really want to go visit my grandpa... I haven't seen him since i was 11, and he prolly misses me. See, grandpa tom is gay and smokes a lot of weed. He also drinks a lot...Im cool with all that of course, but the color of his walls- now THAT bothers me. lol

... I remember the last time i went to see him, he was all excited about his new judy garland poster.  COULD WE FIT THE STEREO TYPE MORE? yeah, and his boyfriend of like 20 years-for whom he left my grandma - made me a fruit smoothie. I found that really funny, bc he is fruity and all. I dunno-i think what really makes it strange is that i haven't talked to him in so long. But, anyway, it's cool, and im sure i would have fun. He sent me graduation money a year ago, so he knows i exist... I guess i could just pop on by. On second thought, i will DEF call first. Dont want to witness anything. 

who wants to go visit with me? What, you thought i would go alone?! hell, no! Sign up quickly, folks- there are only a few spots open! They have a pool. Bc i want to swim in it, knowing what they might have done in there... eep mental pictures. THATS MY GRANDPA!
...

In other news.... i had another great night with steve. He is so much fun. We have gotten so comfortable around each other in the last few days- its gross! I have spent the majority of my time with him, and it never gets old! lol (and were both ADD as shit!!) So i guess we are dating now. I dunno what that means, really- but that's what we decided. Ya know, the titles boggle me. I think its something like:

STAGES OF ROMANTIC INVOLVEMENT
1. friends
2. friends with benefits (this includes the random party hookups with your buds)
3. seeing each other (with yer eyez)
4. dating
5. Going out (exclusive)
6. Getting serious
7. engagement
8. marraige
and for our cynical friends-
9. divorce

Is that about right? any corrections? Forgotten stages? Lol... its stupid that i thought so hard about that. I suppose we skipped the friends stage, and that's prolly where we will end up when all is said and done, but i really like hanging out with him!

Man when did dating get so complicated? Whatever happened to the good ol days? GREAT QUOTE: ""when i was a teen, i just put it to whoever i wanted, and i didnt have to worry about any crabby bugs or penal warts. And i especially didnt have to worry about marrying anyone. You wouldnt want your aunt to be one of the skanks i hung around with."" -uncle harry

well, i realize that the steve thing will make some ppl really mad, but its what i want, and im just doing my thing. any mean comments- keep em to yourself.

Jim just came to get the girls and he brought me an easter basket with a nesting doll from russia inside. I love it. He also gave me an old perfume bottle from egypt about a month ago. I love the world treasure theme he has goin. 

well, im gonna go watch the end of my friends shows and take a nap~ catch everyone later! BRIAN~ SEE YOU TONIGHT!

There are tons of things i keep to myself. You can probably guess the content of such things, if you know me at all. Just personal matters that i wouldnt want to escape my realm of discresion. 

SO with that being said, i will not disclose the events that occured last night with certain 
un-named parties. I will simply say that i'm very happy with the way things have turned around, but im also really confused. *sniff*

"event","Got into a huge fight with my mom yesterday morning... I was being a total bitch. I don't even know why i blew up at her, but we fought until we were both sobbing. I can't see her cry- it breaks my heart. I felt really terrible, and apologized. The whole argument was so ridiculous. She says i promised to do something and i swear that i never promised... Either way, it wasnt worth all the drama. It was just a misunderstanding.

greg came to my house around 1 yesterday, just in time to witness the last half  of the screaming match.( which was essentially just me, making an ass of myself) We met matt and scot for lunch, and i enjoyed their witty repetoire. Really, when i sit with those guys, i feel like i am sitting among comic geniuses. they all play off of each other, and its fabulous.

After our lunch, Greg and i went back to my house to practice music, and he wanted to talk about ""us""... Thats the worst. The DTR talk. (defining the relationship)I would be content just floating along, never committing to anyone. It's so awkward. I never know what to say. I feel like if someone wants to be exclusive, i have to reciprocate the feeling.

He wants to be with me (he already dumped rachel) and he wants to be engaged. I just want to have fun with him, and be free to date around. Do i seem ready to be a wife?? I don't feel like i have surveyed all my options. What if there is better? What if i am missing out? Sure, he is my soulmate, but maybe not all soulmates are supposed to get married... 

***
so, i did end up going to church yesterday, after all. I sang at shakedown for happy corner (thanks liz for the help- my voice was shot!) and then went to see greg and liz play at shiloh. Jen came along with us, and kept me company. A little boy at happy corner was gettin his game on with us, when we were playin basketball... lol He was trying to convince us he was 17. He kept hounding us about whether we were single. He asked jen if she wanted to ""go talk"" after the service. For some reason this 12 year old posing as a 17 year old, trying to get his ""mack on"" (if you will) was ...  It was HILARIOUS. 

Anyway, I really liked the service at shiloh. We chilled at waffle for a little bit,after, enjoying the ""cups o sweet lovin"" that angela so generously provided (that's whipped cream for all those who weren't aware...)And then after we went over to justin's house.

Justin's mom was out of town so he invited us girls over, and greg, and dustin, pat, and jake came too. Also, eric and steve b came, Jeff and andrew, etc. I had a lot of fun. I didn't get home until 4am. The time change is really screwing me up! let the record show i KICKED ass at euchre... ( prolly has nothing to do with the fact that jake practically played my hand for me... lol THANKS BUD!)

My evening went from so-so to great fairly quickly. Just remember: ""if you have a watch under your skin, and you go thru an xray machine, you can tell the time!"" -jen-u-ine! 

Yeah well, my cold has gotten really nasty, so im gonna go lay down and try to get well.... everyone have a grand day!

Its sunday, sunday, sunday! (all day long)It's the day of rest, and man-o-man am i glad for that! I have a cold of some sort. My head may explode. I just want to lay in bed. WHY CAN'T THAT BE AN OPTION!?
...

it's that time kids- for the weekend RECAP!!

On friday, i went shopping with jen, and it was so nice to SPEND some of that (0k, ALL of that) money i have been working so hard for. I bought a bathing suit (0range top and striped bottom), a bag to go with the suit, white flip flops, gym shoes, a pair of dress pants, a frilly white top, a sleeveless shirt,bras and panties, and an easter dress. Oh yeah, and a tower picture frame. I also got jen a couple of shirts, that were really cute. Dont worry folks- We bought a cheap lunch (THAT MAKES UP FOR IT...)

After the shopping, i bought a tanning package for 300 minutes, so that i dont have to look like casper, anymore.  I went on friday and i got fried! I was sorta the shade of a nacho cheese dorito. It turned to tan tho, so im straight. I'm kinda new to the whole tanning thing, so if anywone has any advice, i would be happy to have it. I don't want to get burned again. (eep)

Justin and eric left for canada with a buncho guys, on friday evening. I hope they are safe. They just want to go to windsor to drink, since j is turning 19. I guess they could drink here, but its cooler when you can say ""good beer, EH?"" (""ROAD TRIP! man, there is a lot of sausage going to canadia!"")

YOU GUYS BETTER BRING ME A SOUVENIER!

That night, work called and didn't need me to come in, so i was loving it! (ATTENTION EVERYONE: I DONT HAVE TO WORK!) yeah i def yelled it in the store. lol- love you jen!

i hung out with some friend's at dan's house, that night. I was happy that steve B. decided to come over. We didn't do much of anything, but it was cool that he wanted to head out. He is a hilarious guy. He totally eases the mood. i think the hightlight of the night was watching shrek, but hey- they can't all be winners. 

I also hung out with Steve, eric, and justin thursday night, with jen. Now that was fun! eric and i were talking in sign, and steve and jen learned it in like 20 minutes, desperate to know what it was we were talking about. Which really wasn't anything... i swear. (*wink*)secrets don't make friends, children- but they do make ppl that don't know sign language that well REALLY MAD! lol

Saturday, i worked ALL day, and it sucked, as usual- but alas, a girls gotta do what she's gotta. THANKS to lisa for my delicious lunch from lonestar. (you rock, chica!!) Work was so insanely boring. I didn't manage to slip out until 5:30, and i had to change for Bw3's in the car. I was on register with steph at B dubs, and that was fun. Not that we really had time to slow down and talk, but hey.

Jen, greg, and liz met me at work at 10, and we ate. Then we headed out to dayton to meet up with some ppl i had never met. These 4 guys live in a big ol house. All right brained artsy fartsy guys. There were collages everywhere, photos, paintings, guitars... it was so ecclectic (sp?).

The house said ""Go ahead, create in me!"" (not literally- what do you think this is? a movie?) so greg and i wrote music half the time. It's hard not to be inspired in that environment. When you have the supplies, and the time, and it feels right. I think we pulled together a pretty decent song. two of the guys that live there were actors, 2 were in a band, and they are all artists. The guys in the other half of the double are the same age, and they are musicians and photographers. Their walls were like a chic gallery. i was so impressed. I guess they study at OIP&T. Jen and i gave ""chuck"" our numbers so that he can call us if he needs models. (promise he isn't a perv)

Anyway, thanks for having us over fellas! (mike, andrew, daniel,???) it was a great time!

Today i have a writing session with greg, and then it's shakedown at happy corner. My voice is so raspy, and my nose is all stuffed up, so i should sound great for the worship songs IM LEADING! lol..

ok ppl, check you later!

Ps, pray for my beautiful aunt amie. She is an amazing person, and has breast cancer. She is only 29. I'm worried sick about her. She is so funny and strong, that it's hard to know how she is actually doing. She has surgery next month in carolina... just keep her in your thoughts, please!"

"event","Hey all...

so i wrote a letter to God today- just about my life and stuff. Thought he and i could catch up... Is that crazy? i suppose it is only crazy if i mail it. What is crazy is this story that a girl at work told me... She said her boyfriend keeps 2 liters of urine in his closet(""just in case"" -he says) and asked her to cut off her ring finger for him. NOW HONESTLY. What is he going to do with her ring finger. I mean, sure- its a nice trophy for a while, but then its gonna get all soggy and everything, and anyway- she has a lot more use for it than he does. Same guy asked her to give him a ""hot carl""... I was enlightened to learn that a ""hot carl"" is when one party covers his mouth with saran wrap, and has the other party SHIT on his face. HOW IS THAT SEXUAL? When did excreting become kinky? did i miss something? I bet he really loves the laxatives. Anyway, she broke up with the guy. She decided he wasnt ""her type""... ya don't say? what was the first clue?

I tried telling the ""hot carl"" story to jake... he found it uninteresting, and deemed it ""shitty"". Oh, jake, you pun master! How could i ever entertain a jokester such as you!?

so this letter to God- i wrote about all the things i take for granted. it was really nice to stop complaining and realize how blessed i am. 


ANYWAY, The rain makes me so tired. im gonna go to bed. School in the morning and whatnot. Please comment! i love to hear from my friends.

"event","Back at school. I have 4 classes this quarter, 2 of which are online, and one that is (coincidentally) with jason. I specifically requested not to be in the class jason is- not bc he is in it, but bc i don't like the prof- but apparently they thought i said ""HEY! i WANT that class!"" oh well. At least i will have one friend to study with around here.

In other news, greg and i have been spending a lot of time together. I had forgotten how amazing he is. You know those late night conversations about deep stuff? The kinds of conversations you might encounter once every blue moon, with especially intellectual ppl, with whom you really connect? well, greg and i have those practically EVERY time we talk. It's incredible. Whereas with most, i talk about trivial things like boys and music, with him its philosophy and government and religion. And we talk about the little things too. The little things matter most. After all its the little things that comprise the big things. WOW, and can he make me laugh.

Then, i spend last night with jason, and we had a really good time. There is so much sexual chemistry there. Plus, he gives me butterflies when he walks into the room. I don't know, i just crave him. I love the way he talks and walks and holds me. 

It's like jason stimulates me physically and greg stimulates me mentally. If i know jason is comin over, i put on my makeup, and find a sexy outfit. When greg is coming over, i read up on the latest ""onion"" articles, and think of witty commentary. Its crazy. I love them both, but differently. 

In addition, there's someone else who popped into the circle, that i think is absolutely adorable, and really funny. Doesn't that just throw a wrench in things? There are obstacles everywhere, and this sense that I have to choose now. I think the truth of it is tho, that i can just have fun and date and see what comes out of it all. Alas, the confusion pervades.

...
My mom has bridal magazines strewn all over our house. Samples of flowers and paint colors and dress fabrics. It's ridiculous, but very cute. I think i will write her a song for her present. I haven't started on lyrics yet. Greg will (of course) play guitar. Im excited.

I think i will go ahead and start on my sociology online course now. Liz will be at school soon, and i have class in a half hour. bye bye all!

"event","ok... so maybe i do fill in the blanks a little bit in my journal...Fabricate here and there- but in all honesty, i do lead a pretty interesting life. I try to make everything fun, even if it's just sitting around with friends- but hey, justin- thanks for the insight!

ANYWAY- lisa's toga party was so out of hand. lol- WAY lots of ppl, WAY lots of booze... i had to skip out around 2, bc my mommy was mad at me for not telling her where i was.

I dropped my cell phone on the ground at taco bell that night at one pt. and it shattered into a million peices. I put it back together, and it works, except that ppl can't hear me when i answer. I guess the microphone is out. It really sux bc i think i have to pay a deactivation fee AND pay for a new phone. Im pissed. Oh well, i guess lisa's party would have seemed a lot better to me if that hadn't happened. If anyone knows a way around this, let me know.

I worked thirteen hours at both jobs on saturday. In retrospect, it wasnt so bad, but it seemed really exhausting. It's not like i work on the railroad or anything. Not all that extraneous. But still...

Last night we spent a ""quiet evening"" watching movies and chillin out at lisa's. Enjoying the last night before her parents come home. Just a few chosen ppl came out. It was a good time. Relaxed was a nice change from all the week's chaos.

Today, with the weather being awesome- i was very productive. I declared it sister day and dragged hailey around everywhere i went. I bought her clothes that my mom will never let her wear, and had her help me clean my room. She got all the old cosmetics and perfumes out of my trash and kept them. lol.. cute. She also helped me wash my car. It was funny. She goes ""leigha, when i grow up, i wanna be just like you- cept without all the smoking and mistakes"" ... nice.

Anyway, im off to a church meeting for music... later!

"event","THANK YOU WAFFLE HOUSE CREW~! I'm in such a better mood tonight! After a day of r & r at home, i was back in the game by 8.(put me in coach!)

After work, i headed out to jen's for some dinner... MMMMM spaghetti (my favorite -if ANYONE doesn't know about my sketti passion) DELICIOUS! even if i don't swirl the noodles right (""but it still tastes the same!"") We played cards with the parentals for a little while. Jen's dad played the ""sHoWdOwN"" announcer. I felt like i was in vegas when he was dealing! They are too cool. Props to parents who are involved in their kid's lives! 

Next, we went out to meet with dustin and jake. We ended up at meijer, lounging on bunkbeds and laughing about ""gravy dogs"" ( you had to be there)... For the record, fellas- we didn't ditch you. Its just that we have a strict agenda. People to see and what not. Some folks aren't in town all the time, and we had plans!

After meijer, Liz took us over to waffle and we met with Garrett (* love you doll! hope you have fun and are safe in panama!*) and brian and a bunch of other folks... It was good times. We spent like 3 hours talking about nothing. (dustin: ""all you guys do there is smoke and drink coffee and talk about pointless things"") well, folks not only the captain of Ohio extreme, but also captain obvious~! lol... ""can you get me beer?"" good to know im loved and wanted!

At waffle i got to talk to this really interesting guy who owns a production/promotion company. He might be able to do some stuff for our band. He said that he could film us playing at the avenue and we could show the video at churches and all that. It would be really nice to have something like that for a promo... We are still working out the kinks before a demo can be produced. We need to get CRACKIN!

well, kids, tomorrow i wont have time to write, but it will be work, dinner with the fam, band practice with Greg (and his girlfriend-not awkward at all) and then jeremy's party. Jason might go to that, and that should spice up the evening for me! Esp. if greg goes too! Plus dustin was invited.. whoo, boy! drama.

Im gonna hit the sack now... so later tators!

Im gettin pretty burnt out on the same ol scene. REALLY burnt out. Im actually a little miserable. Last night, instead of studying like i should have, i went out with everybody to jeremy's house to celebrate st. patty's day. I got all depressed when i started thinking about school and how i have bad grades, and that made me pissy half the night. The only high of the evening was streaking-and really, that wasnt even so fun. At around 2, i decided to go home. If the drunks don't kill ya, the fog will... man it was bad out. 

Woke up today at 8 and rushed to school...i FAILED my exam for western civ. Well prolly got a d. I knew a lot of the stuff from common sense. But the essay? oh man. Shot myself right in the foot. I hadn't even LOOKED at the material before class. Next quarter i HAVE to do well!

Yeah, well, i think i need a breather from everybody for a while. Im driving MYSELF crazy. I can't wait for band practice tomorrow so that i can get some of these feelings out!

later folks

I like the commercial that says ""no matter where you are from, on st. patty's day, were all... DRUNK!"" that, to me, says class. lol...Actually i will prolly spend the evening studying and gettin ready for that exam tomorrow. That's big stuff.Oh well, everyone- have a good time for me! I know that liz is also in captivity... She is grounded bc of our late night excursions. Funny that even when we arent being ""bad"", we are out super late. You know- giving to the poor and things.

In other news, Ron went somewhere-not really sure where- and he says he will be back in a few days or weeks. Peculiar. Maybe he just needed a break. Im almost to that point. Def considering quitting the dealership and auditioning for some acting stuff. I really miss being on stage. Also wanting to work on the music thing hard core with greg. Its time to strap down... (that sounds good)

We are desperately trying to get a demo of 6 songs together. We have about 17 songs all together, but we wanna get the best together, and try to promote ourselves. I think that once we have the demo done, we will throw a big party and let everyone hear our stuff. (and buy it) lol...

"event","so im extremely pleased to report that my mom and jim are getting married. They are downright perfect for each other, and im so ecstatic i could just bust! They both have had complex relationship pasts. His first wife (the mother of his three boys) was killed in a car accident. He hadn't dated anyone until my mom. My mom has been married three times before (to idiots)... She said that she has never been in love before. Its so apparent. Everyone around her knows that she is just radiating.  Everything is finally coming together for her. And i guess, for all of us. See, jim has offered to help me pay for college. And when i say help me pay, i mean, practically put me THROUGH college. Its an incredible blessing. I think i may end up going to cedarville like i have always wanted. I will probably finish this year (and maybe more) at sinclair, to get my basics out of the way, and then its dreamschool here i come! i can't tell you how excited i am! 

ALSO.... since my mom will be moving in with jim, the house that we live in now (its a four bedroom ranch with a big yard) will be up for rent. My grandparents own it, and they would be willing to rent to me for a VERY reasonable amount. A HOUSE! i will have a house! i am so so so glad we hadn't signed into that lease yet. This is an amazing surprise. It works out so well for everybody. i know that the kids will have a little stress adjusting, but jim is such a good guy! 

I am a little jealous when i look at how in love my mom is with jim, but its ok, i can focus on school right now and occupy myself with work and saving. That way, i wont think about it as much. After all, my relationship with God could use some work. All of these blessings have reminded me of how great God is. I have felt called to cedarville since i was 14, but i never thought i could afford it. (its like 23,000 a year)My mom and jim assured me we will make it work.

On sunday, i went to church with brian and nikki, and i was really moved when liz sang ""i've always loved you"" by third day. Thats my song with God. The one that has always inspired me the most. It just seemed uncanny. THe song is all about the reassurance, that God works everything out. While it seemed for a while there that everything was a downward spiral, now its on the up and up. Im just so happy that my mom will have a good husband (whom she is head over heels for) and my sisters will have a good daddy! ALSO, it doesnt hurt that i will have a house!!!

SO...we met up with jason and garrett (good to see you again dudes!) and we went over to lisa's house for a bit. From there it was off to bolts for some dinner. We visited with jeremy. He had to stay really late, so he prolly liked the company:) and then jason and i talked for a bit before he headed home. Lisa and brian and i went to waffle and chatted with some long lost friends that are home for break. We had an awesome conversation about our futures, and our pasts. It was really enlightening. Everyone seems to think i will end up with greg one day. 

i do acknowledge that he is my soulmate and that we may end up married ONE day, but for now, im not ready to settle down. The thought is so scary to me. What is ironic is that greg was having the same conversation 45 miles away at cedarville with the girl he is dating, rachel. Im sure its pretty hard to convey that to a girlfriend. It is a weird situation. Its like we know the end and the beginning, but not the middle. I could be single for 10 more years... hard to say. We have to grow up seperately. (there is still a lot of growing to do, and we both concede to that) in addition, we have both developed feelings for a lot of other ppl in the year and a half we've been apart. I am not attracted to him at all, except mentally, spiritually, and physically. as in... i dont want to do him. There was a time when i was into him like that, but not now... how do you get that feeling back. That is my biggest concern. I have the biggest sex drive ever! CANT give that up, even if our minds mesh amazingly well. It would be like marrying a brother. Greg thinks it might be a defense mechanism. Psychological repression of my attraction, so that i dont have to settle right now. he is prolly right.

ANYWAY... On monday, i worked a lot, spent a lot of time in communication with God (""go forth and sin no more. I have blessed thee"" really stuck out to me in devotions... also the story of the woman at the well-check it out) and ended up watching a movie at jeremy's later that night. We got snowed in there, and didn't get much sleep. (my teeth still hurt from wrestling with lisa- omg i might need dentures)

The whole situation with jeremy is really weird. i definately have feelings for him, but it wouldnt work. Too many ""strangeness factors"" Why is it like that? how can a person like someone, and not be good with them? Just doesn't seem fair. EXAMPLE: I still love jas, even tho we arent right for each other. Jas and i have a ton of sexual chemistry, but we dont have that deep conversational connection. I can laugh with jeremy- thats a pro. 

ALSO im really flattered by how much ron likes me. (the list is growing) I don't think i feel the same way, but he is a ton of fun, and i dont want to lose him as a friend. I dont know... its all very confusing... and in the middle of it there's greg- making his theories about it all, and trying to guess the outcome... Will i end up with jason? Will i be hung up on Jeremy after he leaves for the army? Will he end up with rachel (he loves her admittedly- but not like he loved me. We were made for each other) will i be with greg, and get over the attraction block? If Ron feels so strongly for me, there must be a role for me in his life. right? wow... i need a brain breather.

im just going to let everything play out as it's supposed to. i honestly believe it will work itself out. I will just pray and wait. After all, my whole childhood was screwy, but now everything is going to come out okay!

geesh... well, im gonna get back to my studying now. Im here at school. Sorry the entry is so long, im just really happy, and wired. Ok, well im out! respond if you read this!

"event","Saturday morning i woke up feeling so convicted about drinking and that whole scene. I had spent the night before in greenville with some kids, and i sorta felt bad for my actions...but it was good times. Everything gets old, even partying.

Funny how- by last night, all my convictions faded into the background and all i could see was my flip cup. I had a really good time at Jake's party. There weren't a ton of ppl, but that turned out to be better. I liked hide and seek the best! lol... (my idea) ""who plays hide and seek at a party?"" SHUT UP. PLAY IT AND LIKE IT!

All i could think all night was ""i have to be at church in the morning~!"" then it was ""i have to be at church in like 2 hours"" then it became ""im late for church."".... yeah, i didnt get home until 10 am today, and i hadn't slept but an hour. My mom is so pissed off. Oh well, better to be pissed off than pissed on. Meg is also mad bc i didnt go with her. She thinks i purposely didnt go, but i was just way too tired.

Brian is home for break, and it is so awesome having him around! He came out last night, and made the night that much better. One big regret i do have is the matt situation. We got him his first beer, and apparently he didnt handle it so well. He was driving home and started swerving. He got pulled over and sited. Makes me feel kinda responsible, bc im sure he will get in an ass load of trouble with this parents. It wasnt a DUI, just a ticket, but wow, he could have been arrested. 

I would have been in no shape to drive last night. I just stayed over. Which is why my mom wants my head on a platter. I didnt call or anything. ugh... who am i?

On a ""be proud of me"" note, i did work all day at smedley's yesterday, and then went to BW3's and worked 5 hours. I thought that was commendable. I was prrrretty tired, but i still managed to stay up ALL night. Prolly cuz my buddies came in to see me, and cheer me up. 

Ok, well im gonna go visit meg in P-hill... i will be back in one moon.

They make up names for me like ""bitch hole pie head"", and do not ever thank me when i wake their asses up for school. Today, one of them- i forget her name- lets go with ""margie""- came up to me and said that i am ""very ugly, almost freakish"". 

I asked my mother about the children, but she is in on it. She claims that she bore them, and i must contribute to their lives, even tho just about everyone wants them offed. They are my obligation. So i was doing One of them's laundry...I forget her name- i will call her ""sally pigeon foot""-and i find this beer in her laundry bin. I think to myself-My little ""sister"" is an alcoholic. I should have known. I immeadiately confront the child. She is in her room playing with bratz dolls, acting all naive. I say ""why you drinking beer, you alcoholic??!"" 

Sally looks up from her Childs play, bewildered and says "" i dont know what you are talking about""
I dont believe her of course, and i was just about to make her take a bath (best punishment i can think of) when it occurs to me that its my beer. I had prolly hidden it in her laundry bin when i was drunk. Good plan. ""oh nevermind sally,"" i say ""i think its margie's""

She called me a bitch hole pie head, and with that, i left the room, feeling rather ridiculous. How come made up insults hurt the worst?

"event","Yesterday was rather uneventful. I woke up, (you dont say!) went to class, watched a movie with jason (top gun rules), and went to work. After work, i wrote a song with greg (matt says it is very catchy), and went to bed. I talked on the phone a little bit, but i got a full 8 hours sleep. its crazy, really. Hey jeremy, how about those cancerous popcorn fumes, buddy? 

Wednesday was a little more exciting. I was at work at Bw3's, and liz, jen, ron, trent, and shawn visited me. They came seperately, but met up there. Ron brought me flowers! Isnt that really sweet? They were on my car when i went outside. He asked me what my deal is with the dating thing. I gave him the same answer i have given before, which is that im hung up on jason, but i think the truth is that im enjoying myself as a single gal- having options and open doors. There is an extent to which i wish things would have worked with jas, but mostly, im just settling in to this non-commital stage. I should really be way past settling into the stage by now. I have been single for like 2 months. Its just that all thru high school there was someone there. Now im all alone, and i sort of enjoy it.

So i guess the thing with dating right now is- as far as the ""boyfriend"" position goes, there is nothing open right now, but im always taking applications. 

i looked in a birthday book the other day, and my day is ""the birthday of the heartbreaker"" Isnt that funny? lil ol me? Greg tried to convince me that it's true. That i draw ppl in, use them up, and smash them. I argued that he is still in the picture, so it can't be. Surely he wouldn't stick around, constantly subjecting himself to me, if i were such an ice princess. He said he can't help it. That im contagious, and he wants to get out  sometimes, but he can't. He says that is part of the epidemic. i think that is a crock. He sticks around, bc i give him what he needs in a friendship. I make him laugh, and i make him think.  

I know i broke greg heart and jason's too, but thats all. (its not like my heart has never hurt!)Oh, and i guess i broke Liz's heart. (she is ""sad at me"" bc we don't spend as much time together as we used to)And if we are counting friends, i guess Meagan also (kinda lost touch over time)...I might have broke Donnie's heart. He was a little upset. And i seem to remember a certain situation about mike in high school. I think i hurt erik a lot too. hmmm-

... but everyone is breaking something- just ask winnie the pooh. He has a lot of trouble with cracked honey pots. I guess do tend to migrate on ppl. Well vertical horizon said it best ""love can be so boring..."" Im sorry, but i just feel the need to move. I don't forget people, i just want new experiences. I wonder how many times i will fall in love. How many ""best friends"" i will have? I cringe at the thought of a mundane cyclic existance, in which i wake up to the same life i have been waking to for years. I see it in my coworkers at the dealership. In my managers at bw's... it depresses me to think that is what im in for. I dont want to think about being married to one person who bores the shit out of me, and being stuck in a job, that is less than enjoyable. I guess there is no way around it, unless i become a stunt man or something. I am just never content. It isn't in my nature. I am always seeking progress. Without progress, its digression. Entropy. No one wants that.

I should do a case study to try to prove i am not a heart breaker. ( i am very hung up on this- prolly bc i know its true... wink) I will conduct this study of course, and will become very attatched to all the participants. At the end of the study, the volunteers should not expect to be contacted ever again. lol... 

ANYWAY~ after work at the dealership, we went out to greenville with some peeps to explore abandoned houses (who does that? honestly?!) We disrespected the dead and committed a crime AT THE SAME TIME! That is what it's all about, folks. Afterward, some of us went out to waffle and sat around arguing with the personification of ignorance numbers one and two. It was very frustrating. Yeah, lets call leigha a racist, and then expect her to take it. No, i really doubt that. Of course i just HAD to sit there and talk it out with these ppl for an hour, while they yelled and blew everything way out of proportion. 
I realize im being vague, but i dont want to bring up the tabboo topic, for fear of offending. Anyways, i really need to get to work, so i will bid you ado, reader.

Ps... i quit smoking. For the record.

"event","i have done nothing all day. Woke up on my couch, and remained there for the greater portion of the morning, afternoon, and evening. How boring am i? 

Jen and greg came to visit me around 4 (i know it was 4, bc we started to watch oprah) and that was nice, but it would be nicer if i didnt have the flu, and i could LEAVE MY HOUSE. i have cabin fever hard core. Anybody who knows me knows that i am pissed about this whole ""being at home and gettin well"" plan. i think that the road to recovery is also the road to waffle house. You don't realize how much you miss waffle until you abstain from its waffley goodness for 3 nights!!jen, greg, and i sat around here, and mostly did nothing, until they had to leave. They LEFT ME HERE. i thought for sure they would hook me up to some sort of pulling aparatice and drag me out of this dump, but NO. 

side note***
Greg: i can't stay long.
Me: Then why did you come?
Greg: I wanted to. Its just that i have something i have to do.
Me: what?
Greg: i been working on diggin this hole in my backyard. Its gettin pretty big. Thinking bout puttin stuff in 'er.
Me: ROFL

My mother cooked an ACTUAL meal tonight. Mind you, my mother NEVER cooks. It was friggin steak and salad, and fries and the whole deal. She can't make food when im well. No. Those nights, its oatmeal, or pudding for dinner. TONIGHT ITS STEAK. i was so mad. i started to try some of the steak, but all i could think about was a cow vomiting for some reason. I could be like donnie and not eat anything with a face, or any bi-product of something with a face.

SPEAKING OF DON~! he def called me tonight and said he missed me and wants to be my friend. He gave me one of the best compliments in the world in a back asswards kinda-donnie way. He said ""i tried to forget you. I wanted to erase you from my life. But i couldnt. I just cant forget you."" well i thought it was sweet. what is ironic, is that i had just been thinking about him! yeah, but things work out that way. 

I asked jason on the phone tonight if he could tell when i missed him. He said that was the weirdest gayest question anyone ever asked. But i think its a good question. If you love someone, does a part of your heart stay connected to them? Do i really love someone that uses the word ""gayest""? lol prolly.

AnYwAy...
i guess i will go back to my couch and rest. MORE. bc thats what i do. I rest. it should be noted, however that when i earlier attributed the ""world's fastest room cleaner"" title to my little sister, i failed to account for the laundry she stuffed in the microwave and fridge.

GOODNIGHT ALL!

"event","Hey all! thanks to everyone that responded to my last entry. It really does mean a lot to me. It is nice to know that someone is listening!

I guess i haven't wrote in a few days, so i will go ahead and recap the weekend's events... On friday, Ron and co. came in to visit me, and they played all the songs i LOVE on the jukebox thingy! it was super sweet. Something corporate and third eye blind. A man after mine own heart!

after work, lisa and i went to look at another apartment in brookville. It needs some work, but the rent is cheap and the area is nice. Also i know the landlord, so that is a plus. Still considering. After that, we picked up Jen and went out to greg's house. His friend brian came by and we all jammed for a while. Lisa wrote the lyrics to a song, and we used it for a new piece. it turned out really well. I think we make a good team. Jen as backup, lisa as co writer, greg and brian on guitar. 

After Greg's, we went to frisches, and met up with the paintball boys. Like, ALL the paintball boys. It got pretty crowded back in the corner of the restaurant, so we didnt stay very long. greg, brian, lisa, jen, and i went to a party in phillipsburg. It was a little weird for me bc i didnt know the hostess. But it wasnt really the kind of party where you have to know the ""hostess"". And it wasnt really the kind of party where you say ""hostess""... Anyway, jeremy and liz came a little later, and we mostly just sat around and talked. Went to waffle house, and went home. Oh the excitement.

Saturday, i worked all day, and was supposed to work at bw3's after, but i felt like absolute shit. So i called off. When i got home from the dealership, i realized i had caught the plague or something. I puked all evening (nice visual)and moaned and groaned and laid around in misery. See, im really bad at being ill. I can't NOT complain. I have the biggest mouth in the world. My mom said ""its about time you got the flu."" i told her my immune system was undefeated this year, but they were down to the fourth string.

She went out on a date, but brought me the puke bucket before she left. ""the puke bucket? who invented this use for a bucket?"" -lisa 

I called in the reinforcements, and pretty soon, i had a few ppl over to take care of me. The problem with me having company when im sick is- i dont feel sick anymore. They cheer me up, and i forget that im dying. SO, they were all headed out to Jeremy's birthday party, and i thought- hell- i can go. i really thought i was capable. They didnt think it was a good idea, but i insisted. So i went. 

The sight of ppl drinking and eating and burping and smoking, made me so much sicker than ever. I had to go upstairs to lay down. Jeremy was giving ppl tours of his house, and everytime someone would walk by, i would wake up. I just could rest. My stomach hurt so incredibly bad. Finally, i went into the bathroom and threw up for about 1/2 an hour, and then called liz from downstairs to take me home. Lisa and jen ended up staying the night, but i had to go get some rest. I took some pills to make me sleep, but i still woke up a lot to get sick. It was just bad. really bad.

yesterday, i laid around and watched movies with my mommy, trying to recover. thanks to all the folks who came to visit, and left me messages! i really appreciate it. I can't wait for brian to get home on Friday. It will be great to have the beach resort crew reunited again! Greg is in town right now also, so that is pretty fun too.

i am going to attempt work tonight, so i think i will rest until then.
love love

"event","well before i got to know myself, i thought i was a really great gal... but now im not so sure. Seems like i expend a lot of energy in things that arent very worthwhile. This whole noble quest to find myself led to my realization that there were reasons i kept portions of myself hidden. Anyway, i know that seems dark and sad, but im just struggling right now. It seems like nothing is really working out. I have to work all the time ( i got myself into this), im doing poorly in school (bc i have no time), i have vices that control me (like smoking) and im still in love with my ex. IN addition, im hurting ppl that want me, bc i can't stop being selfish and give them a chance. 

Sometimes i just want to crawl into bed and sleep for a year. BUT of course, that would just be far too long. LOL. i have cabin fever now, and i have only been awake and at home for half an hour. 

Its really not so bad at all. Im just bitching. I hate routine. Everyone knows that about me. I dont like falling into a rut. throw in a cup of spontanaity and i would be content!

Yeah, so last night we all went to jeremy's after i got off work, and some gay movie got me thinking a lot about the ppl i have lost in my life, and the people that i have hurt. I would just like to say to greg~

if you ever read this, please know that i am sorry. I didnt realize that you were my soulmate. They told me there would be other fish in the sea. They told me not to settle down. So i dumped you, and im still searching for something remotely close. They were wrong. We had it. The kind of love everyone dreams about. Im sorry i gave in. Im sorry. I managed to find someone else to love, and it didnt work out either. Thats a lot of pain in the span of 4 years. I know that we will always be best friends- You are like a brother to me now, but it kills me. Where did the attraction go? i wish you the best. Im sorry if i got off of God's path for us. I really am. Im praying that he will send us both someone else. 

And to jason....
you know i still love you. You know that in my heart i wish things would just work out. Im sorry to you for all the pain i caused in our relationship. I really never wanted to make you hurt. You are one of the best ppl i ever knew. You will find your gal (if its not me...) and if she ever hurts you, you just gimme a call and i will bitch slap her ass! lol... ok...Who loves ya, bew?

ok...To everyone else (you know who you are)
so, im sorry i have had my head up my ass over those two. Im trying.... really i am. Its harder than it seems! If you get the chance, watch ""fools rush in""... it has some great lines!

Ok, im done being depressed now. Time to down some dew and get off to BW3's...Have a good one folks. BAND PRACTICE TONIGHT! NO ONE FORGET!

LOVE MY JOB(S):)) and then, just when i was ready for some down time, i had to go grocery shoppin at 10 pm (with my money, no less)so that my mom can be happy ""leigha, i like to wake up to a stocked fridge"".... who says that?!

The gals went with me, and i mostly just rode on the end of the cart, while they did the work. (thanks, dolls!) lisa hates when i call her 'doll'...Oh, but i did help pick out the junk food. Im good at that. Chewy cookies and egg rolls! good choice? Does it get more wonderful? anyway, that BLT from waffle is making me want to be sick, so i think im gonna go curl up next to a bucket. night...

"event","Yesterday, i saw ""The Passion of the Christ"" not once, but two times! i went with Ron (jack black from the bowlin alley) and his pals when i woke up in the afternoon, and then AGAIN after work with the gals (misty, jen, liz, and lis) 

The movie is incredibly moving, but i will worn you to bring some tissue~! We all sobbed. Its just that impactful. It is also very bloody. They obviously took great care in depicting it very realistically, but it sorta makes ya nauseous at parts. 

Anyway, it's one of those movies that makes you want to re-evaluate your life. Take inventory of your vices, and make some changes. Its rough, bc the ""bad"" choices i make (drinking too much, smoking, spooning in a bed with 2 other ppl LOL) are the same ones that my friends do. How do you escape that sort of thing? Its a viscious cycle. No one holds me accountable. 

I spent the whole night in contemplation and prayer. Sometimes, it feels like there can't possibly be much importance in my petty existance( and maybe thats where i fell away in my relationship with God) , but i know that isn't true. God has never given up on me, and that must mean i am worth while. Most importantly, faith saves. i wanna make it to that heavenly waffle house, so that i can chat with jesus, and matthew, and all the other cool folk. 

Jeremy is very sick. He has symptoms that are associated with the plague. I hope he feels better soon, bc it just isnt the same without him around! We might go visit him tonight-when i get off work- but probably not, bc he is REALLY sick, and needs his rest. Maybe we wore him out with our constant GOING... We really don't ever slow down. His immune system was all ""OVERLOAD! ALARM!""
maybe he will be too sick to be in the army, and he will have to stay here in ohio with us gals FOREVER! lol.... prolly not.

So today, i went over to jason's at 10. Yeah yeah, i said i wouldn't. i swore it even. I think we all saw that resolve crumble the DAY after i made it. Funny thing. i can be stubborn and determined about anything... but love is so tricky. What's more, i have given up on having a relationship with jas. In fact im interested in someone else for the first time in a while. BUT, when he calls, i drop everything. That's just love for ya. hmph... how frustrating!

well, in psych today, we had a stress inventory test, and my results were disturbing! apparently, balencing a screwy home life, school, 2 jobs, friends, and finding a new place is stressful. BUT welcome to the real world, eh? It's really not so bad, until you start worrying about why you aren't worried. Oh man, i need a nap. I think im doing ok? dont you? laughter keeps me going. Plus, i have the best friends in the world!

at waffle last night after the movie:
LOOK, its rico, suave, AND jose quervo, all in one booth! they are probably tired from all that border hopping! 
  **** could we be ANY more offensive? ROFL ****

me: hey, dude, u have nice arms. Except they are kinda too big for your little body. 
Him: uh.. thanks?
me: i have a tendancy of turning compliments into insults.
Liz:  EXAMPLE: you have a nice face, except those pancake ears!
OTHER him: i have a gun.
Jen: probably.
all: ROFL
lisa: *stunned* I dont like to be touched. You are touching me. DONT TOUCH ME!
HIM and OTHER HIM: Check please?

Went bowling last night. For real this time! (Lisa, jen, and i always go down there late at night, only to find that no lanes are open...) I had met some ppl online thru a friend, so i invited them. They showed up and were a lot of fun. They mentioned that they knew my friend mike (small world), so i called and invited mike. Mike brought aboout 6 other ppl to the bowling alley, and then those ppl ended up introducing us to their friends at waffle house later. Yea so the 7 degrees of leigha elliott. 

Ok, well one of the ppl i met randomly at the bowling alley is ron. Ron is this really cool guy that looks like jack black. Lotsa fun. Me, some of his friends, and he are going to see the passion of christ at 1. Im so excited! whooo hoo!

BUT i am really good at spilling drinks all over myself. Everyone has a talent, i guess. Jeremy, you aren't so bad at that either! (what up, ALL over the car!)We went to some club. I couldnt tell you where really- and the dance floor was the size of a vagina~ and just as musty.(WHO SAYS THAT?) We made it a good time. A great time even. All of the african american fellows were drawn to liz, it seems. lol.... its bc she has booty and rhythm. GIT R DONE! 

I would like to give a shoutout to my mom who is oblivious that i party every night and stay the night at the houses of boys- boys, filled with semen and liquor. I would also like to give a shoutout to my dad, who is probably laying in a pool of his own vomit, watching nascar. MY GENES ARE FABULOUS! How did i turn out to be so KILLER? OH wait... lol

In addition, i would just like to remind everyone of some of the funny things they (we) said while drunk***
jen: it sounds like you have surround sound in here.
Jeremy: i do
Jen: hooked up to your alarm?
Jeremy: yeah.
me: (rolling in hysterics) lol.. to his alarm.. jeremy, you are so opulent!

THREE WAY SPOON? prolly not a good plan. OH WELL... shit happens, i guess. ""we will just listen to one more song... (3 hours later) *figit, figit* I CANT SLEEP!""

Jeremy: everyone has a nickname. ppl just (slur) shorten their first names. (burp) i can be called jere.
Me: uh... yeah bc thats catchy.
eric: i have to fart
Jeremy: HOLD ON... lemme find the lighter...
eric: IM RICK JAMES BITCH!

LOLOL you guys are a riot!
all except the panic over the keys this morning.lol...

Today i didn't do much. Came home from jeremy's house, went to work, went with lisa and jen to the store, went to the shop for a bit, and here i be! i think i may go bowling later. That could be fun!

i have school all day tomorrow, so thats exciting (no) BUT the girls and i are goin to yellow rose at 11, and were gonna pre game at lisa's before. Dont worry, ppl- liz is driving. At least that is something to look forward to. 

Last night after i got home from waffle, i was pretty depressed about my life. Sometimes i think to myself ""wow, everything really sux. all i do is work and go to school and drink, and its all so repetitive. Im a pathetic person."" BUT THEN i got a few shots in me and i was fine. lol, jk. My girls keep me going. i have never laughed so much in my life as i do with them.

Im pure college. In the dictionary beside the word ""college"" its my pic. if only i actually went to class... hm i will work on that. SO yeah a call from brad really cheered me up, bc it was unexpected. Glad to hear that he is doing well with his band and everything. He is really a funny guy.

"event","so im sitting at school, in the library, and im thinking to myself. All these ppl around me are sitting here, thinking too. Yeah, but they probably arent thinking about how everyone else is thinking. 

No, they are probably thinking of things like school and work and friends and sex and partyin. And here i am thinking about them thinking about these things. You can always tell the guys that are thinking about sex because they do this shifty eye thing toward the magazines with the half naked girls. Then they look around and scope out the prey. The girls thinking about sex sit over in the corners and read their romance novels. Yah, the good ol days, when that alone satiated my desire. God, i wanna fool around real bad... i mean... uh. well, no thats what i meant. LOL, im such a hornball.

Those no-doz things work wonders (you were right, jerm). The hamster in my head is running on his wheel so hard that he is going to have a stroke. I took my western civ exam a few minutes ago (and stayed awake). I think i got a good grade. I also turned in my english paper. My prof is gonna be pissed when he realizes i havent been in class in like... oh... 2 weeks. its all pudding, baby. (yeah, you can quote that, bc you want to)

i think Jen and i are going to leave and go to the mall soon. Thats what you call responsibility, kids. We are scholarly. What is a scholar without good clothes?

Yesterday i was stressed. i had to work all day, and then work some more, and by the time i got to jen's house to study, i was a friggin drone. She and lisa kept me motivated tho. (thanks girls!!) my english paper is almost as boring as this entry. It sux so bad, i fell asleep proofreading it. Nice. My teacher will eat that shit up like he's at the buffet.

Speaking of food... i have none. Oh well, nice thought anyway. ok, so late night trips to meijer, and taco bell, and waffle house with my gals, and my new ""husband"" are fun. ""its fine.. were both in love with other ppl...we have to get it annulled!"" Don't worry, we didnt consumate it. lol...i do miss jas, but we wont bring that up. NOW WILL WE??! 

next topic... i have to get some sleep today if i want to stay alive. Thats a fact, jack. So maybe i will go lay on some dirty couch in the corner and read a book entitled ""romance ranch"" with a studly cowboy on the cover. Sounds like a plan, stan. (stan, was it?)

I took caffeine pills to keep me up after work, and the thing is i was wired. No one would run around the apartments with me, bc they said my heart might explode. That would be gross. Kudos to jeremy coming to the party BEFORE checkout time! Woot. You all are awesome kids, and im glad to know ya!! too bad some ppl wont build a fort with me... (JEN)Special thanks to lisa for actually LETTING ME GET SOME SLEEP!!

"event","so Thursday i came home from jen's house a total mess. The night started out well. We sat with her parents and sang and played cards. Then later on, Donnie mentioned some name that Jason called me, and it shouldnt bother me, but it does. i just broke down. I left jen's, and just cried the whole way home. I guess i had been ignoring all the pain. I wanted him to keep on loving me, but that is a little idealistic. He has to deal with it his way- even if that is just being mad at me and calling me names. I want to let him get thru it, but i dont want him to hurt me in the process. SO, anyway, i sobbed from jen's house to mine. I cried like i hadnt cried before in my life. here's the truth, i miss him so bad, and i love him, and i hate him, and im so torn. I trust him to the point that when he insults me, it sticks to my insides and has a sort of validity, whereas when someone you don't love insults you, you can blow it off. it kills me to think that he can forget every happy memory and exchange ""us"" for bitterness. There is nothing left to do but move on and it kills me. I keep hearing these songs like ""white flag"" and i just fall apart. The response he posted in one of my last journals is not who he was to me. I promise that there really was a sweet awesome guy that i fell for. I don't know why he is acting like that. I dont know why i defend him. I just wish he could say ""i wish it would have worked, but it didnt. I love you, and always will. Have a great life."" 

alrighty, since im starting to cry, we will move on...

see, the thing is- i should be at work right now. BUT im at home. I stayed out waaaay too late last night and i just can't do it. I have to pull a shift at BW's tonight, and im thinking 14 hours of work would be a little much. So yeah.

Yesterday, i worked until 3, and then i met the gals at our future apartment. Move in date: April 24th. (WELL YAY!) After, we went to grab some grub at hooters. It was a good time. After we ate, we went back to lisa's house. We invited some ppl, and it got too crowded so we JUST HAD to rent a hotel room. THANK YOU LISA!!!(I love you like it's no one's bizniz, wifey. Thanks also to all the ladies and fellas that came to visit. You know who you be. Special shout out to the tall drink of water- jeconiah- and liz for driving me and to and fro. Man, it was a good time. BUT i really should have gone to work today. oh well. i hope i don't get fired. I did call in sick, but it was more like calling in retarded. I couldnt even think when I started talking on the voicemail. im an idiot. ""yeaaaaa, jon- is it? im very sick. im puking all over myself here. I wont be in. Gimme a call."" professional.

Yeah, so biggest laughs of my life! We literally didnt sleep AT ALL. 
Jen: ""you could play cats in the cradle with that thong!"" 
Lisa: ""Tom, are you a frequent circus goer?"" ""leigha, you MUST NOT SLEEP!"" 
Tom: ""the areola is the slightly discolored area on the breast region..."" 
Jeconiah: ""NINETEEN people live in my house, which is the size of this hotel room"" 
jen's grandma: ""there's my ughador~!(daughter)"" Me: ""screw you guys, im sleeping in the bathtub!""*THUMP* (my head againist the wall)""i will not be in the panty brigade"" 

gooooood times. those times were so goooit. ""GIRL I SEEENT CHU!""-brad (forgot that one)ALRIGHTY, well i gotta go sleep some. have a great day/night all.

"event","so yesterday Don came over at 11 to wake me up. I rolled out of bed in a blanket and came to the door much like a bear might exit his cave after session of hibernation. I like that he came over when i wasn't expecting it. No one does that for me anymore. I love spontanaity. not enough to learn how to spell it tho. lets not take this thing too far. So yeah, we went to wendy's and then over to lisa's. i went to work at bw3's and it was really fun. The environment there is intense but not tense, if that makes any sense. (who am i, dr. seuss?) The manager is really laid back so thats cool. 

after work, i met up with jen, lisa, don, jeremy, misty, and liz at waffle. Some of us went back to jen's and played cards for a bit. After, we came up with the idea for a seance. LoL... we mostly just laughed at first... well, until we summoned the ghosts of two of our friends. its fine that it was super creepy. No details, just trust me. For the record, jeremy is NOT light as a feather OR stiff as a board.

alright, so yeah...Today i woke up around 12, bc i was out until 4 this morning.(mom loved that.. what can i say? ""ma, we were talkin to the devil, sorry im late"")Yeah, so i missed my first two classes. I don't care all that much, which is probably a bad sign. I picked up jen and made it in time for psychology. 

hot boy in psych. -Adam: ""hey, my mom acts the same way. Maybe we have the same mom!"" 
me: ""yeah too bad i wanna bone you, bro."" (oops out loud thoughts.) 

alright well, apparently, its family night, so im gonna put my time in. Mind you I WILL be out of here by 10. love love!

"event","hey yall! just got back from lisa's. We all watched the blue collar comedy tour. Wow that crap is funny! lol... (tator tot)

so yeah, i wanna do stand up! how cool would that be? well, except for the audience. But at least i would be having fun~! (heres your sign)

so, we ended up going to bw3's tonight. I start work there tomorrow, so it was a nice lil precurser. (who uses that word?) too bad some ppl were rude, and we had to leave and go to waffle for the rest of our gal time. 

Jen and i skipped a lot of class today. We went to frisches and wasted time, bc we were bored. Jen cracked me up. There were some ppl that came in all decked out in native gear. (tribal lookin shaws and these flea market necklaces with feathers.) so jen says ""hey, the indians called, they want their clothes back"" and i lost it. I was friggin rollin. I thought about bartering with them for some cornmeal, but they were clearly ingine posers. Not real ingines. (how does one spell ""ingine?"" lemme consult my PC dictionary... Im gonna get scalped. Its fine.

So what began as a real shit day turned int o a lot of fun. (git r done!) what do you know. thats what friends are for! well, im bout to bounce on to bed. later!"

"event","oh, how i longed for closure. It's so good to have some peace. Even if it ended badly, i will remember the good times, and most of all i will remember the lesson that i learned: if a person truly loves you, they will not yell ""fuck you bitch"" at you in front of everyone at sinclair. Never ever again. I will wait for real love, and have some fun in the mean time!

so gals, are we ready for this big move? its almost time. Im gettin a little nervous, but im excited too. I know we can do this, and im thrilled that we are doing it TOGETHER~! woot.

i hope that everyone is having a good day. Im off to a bad start, but hell if i will let HIM ruin it. After all, its tuesday night, and im bout to get my game on!

later kids,

"event","Today i went apartment scouting with the gals (and jeconiah)! it was great. We had chinese food, we shopped, we found a GREAT PLACE!! its fabulous. Now we have to work out the rent situation... jeconiah hooked lisa and i up with sweatshirts from his dad's shop. We are now # 1 and #2. yeah thats right, we have shirts with our names on them. (i know you are jealous~)

After work, we all went to waffle house and it was good times. We chatted about moving out and acknowledged that we will surely fight, but that we are going to push hard for this, bc its something that we all want, and we can make it work. So yeah, it was def good times at waffle...Sometimes you get in that zone and you dont want to leave. Unfortunatly, school is a priority. (sorta)

so i think i may just go to bed now...
have a good one, all!

"event","well yesterday turned into a lot of fun!! When the Ud game was over (go flyers and all that jazz)Harley, kurt, nick, the girls and i went out to O charley's for some chow. After we ate, we realized how DEAD TIRED we were. The group nap suggestion was vetoed, and we all retired to our seperate beds. 

When i got up around nine p.m., i met up with brian and we went to see liz and her church group at olive garden. We then proceeded to pick up jen and lisa, and head to toms house to visit the paintball guys. (they have a new team name- ohio extreme) We all ended up going bowling. (thanks Jake and Pat for actually BOWLING!) Jeremy met us up there, and tommy was there too. There were waaaay too many ppl (esp for 3 seats, right gang?) lol...You know what i hate?? diet coke. Almost enough to spit it all over a table! 

Who would drink in a car on the side of the building?? i have no idea, but that sure is wild! 
(thanks dustin) After the bowling alley, we headed to waffle to relax a little. We were all wired!! (how many restaurants can we hit in one day??) (( does waffle count as a restaurant??))

Dustin called and he asked liz and i to come by, so we went there around 1 or 2. It was good times. I ended up rolling in around 5, and my mom DEF heard me!! ooooops... she gave me a talk this morning about respecting my family. I nodded politely and did a lot of this number ---> (yes, mom, you are absolutely right!)It did the trick. She went with my fam to cosi today. (damnit, i really wanted to go, but i gotta work... i wanted to do the static ball thing. Someone should def take me on a date there!!) 

well, im out to run some errands and pick up some ppl for lunch... later tator!

(first time anyone ever heard me say that!) thanks to MY new friends matt, kurt, and nick for all the fun. Lisa, you are a pool playing star! Jen, thanks for the laughs and the trash can...

Lisa, Jen, and i toasted to ""single on valentines day, and HAVING FUN!!"" it was really cool. I even got to sleep on an actual bed. Wow, i love those loft apartments. Incredible. if only i had the money.

Me: mom, you sound like the guy from office space.
Mom: is that rated R?
Me: *sigh....* why am i babysitting?
Mom: your sisters are sick...

Libby and Hailey: *throw up in unison*
me: yeah, thats impressive and everything, but i cant hear the TV show with you guys puking every 10. How about we station you two in a seperate room?
Hailey: you aren't very considerate about us being sick.
Me: yeah, well, you arent very considerate of the fact that i had plans today. 
...

*two hours later*

kids: so... wanna play cards?
me: so... wanna play ""we already did that, and im trying to talk on the phone""?
Libby: that doesnt sound as fun, but we can try it.
Me: *laugh*
libby: i have a nose bleed. OH GOD, ITS GUSHING!
Me: GET YOUR HEAD IN THAT BUCKET! 
Hailey: DONT GET YOUR NOSE BLOOD ON THE HAMSTERS!
Me: WHY ARE WE ALL YELLING?! *hamsters scurry*

...
*2 more hours later* 

Mom: How were the kids today?
Me: incapacitated. It's the best.
Mom: haha. So, don't you have to work at Hampton inn today?
me: oh, about that, they hired me and then called to let me know it was a mistake, and that they are overstaffed. Im fired. Imagine that. 
Mom: sounds like you need to eat your veggies.
Me: correlation?
Mom: *thinks* im not sure...
Me: what the hell?
Mom: did you just say ""hell"", in a context not related to the actual HELL-place of doom and eternal damnation?
me: no... i was talking about it in a purely biblical sense.
Mom: oh ok, just checking. You will probably want to wash your mouth out, just to be sure.
Me: i will get on that.
Mom: by the way, we have a funeral to go to tomorrow.
Me: who else can die in our family?
Mom: its a family friend.
Me: God, its spreading.
Mom: are you in prayer?
Me: yes.
Mom: you should probably wash your mouth out just to be sure.
Me: all of my funeral outfits are in the wash from last week.
Mom: oh, well maybe you could skip just this one. 
me: i should really get into the funeral business. I mean, ppl always die. 
Mom: But where do they go when they die? That is the business to get into.
Me: uh... well, i think its about time for me to get to work. Smedley's is the business i'm into.
Mom: ok, how long has your sister's nose been bleeding?
me: i dunno, 8 days?
mom: ah, and where are the hamsters?
me: um, in the drawer with the spoons.
Mom: ah, and is there vomit in a place where there should not be vomit?
Me: behind the couch on the left.
Mom: have a good day!"

"event","well i didn't end up stayin in that night i last blogged. (imagine that!) Went out with jen and liz to waffle. Later, we met up with misty and her crew at the bowling alley. I called Jeremy(for jen) and he came to the bowling alley and sat with us for a while (what up, non smoker??)thanks mikey for taking all those screwed up pics of me with your phone. Yes, i have a large mouth. 

after the bowling alley, we got in liz's hot tub for a while and relaxed...I had school on Thursday. Went to my western civ class and got my exam back. i got an 86%~! thats good, eh? Jason didnt show up for school, so i called to tell him about class. He didn't answer. He ended up calling me later to find out if he could come by my house, only i was at the paintball store with jen, and i left my phone in the car. 

*whispers* ""d and d paintball, this is dustin"" then YELLS to friends ""WHAT UP??!"" see, that's a professional inside voice vs. a party voice! lol He is so cute! (yes i still owe him for that drink!)

me: ""dustin only eats fruit""
jen: ""what are you a bat??"" *does beautiful impression of a bat*

so i ended up meetin with jas after work. We all (me, jen, liz, lisa-yes his other ex-, and he)went to see ""win a date with tad hamilton"". I think its always a good idea to see a love movie with your ex, and his ex. Top ten great plans. Actually it wasnt so bad at all, except that cliche love movies tend to drudge up old feelings. Oh well, what you gonna do...We miss each other, and still love each other, but some things are better left alone! good advice from Lisa: dont keep investing in a dead market. Be smart enough to cut your losses... Love or not. Besides, there is another prospect on the board! (yeah, so there!) lol...but i will always miss you bew! inside sometimes, i just wish it would have worked out. Bottom line: it didnt. In the words of andy: GET OVER IT, AND LIKE IT!

This whole valentines day thing sux! i want flowers and a date and candy and poetry and THE WORKS. (haha, who wants to come to my pity party??)

made ammends with brad ( i think...?) weirdest conversation ever. I hate fighting with ppl. Can't we all just get along. (but not make out?)

so today i have an interview at BW3's and i have to do some shopping and some cleaning. Also BRIAN COMES HOME TONIGHT!!!!!!!!!! We are going to the musical at the high school again, and then i have band practice at a church around here. 

Everyone have a fab-tab day!! love love,

"event","could it be? 11:00 pm on a tuesday night, and im HOME?? what has happened here? you might ask. And to that, i might reply- well, nothing happened here!that was the problem.

I went to school all day, and lord knows that can be very tiring, what with the school work. And then had my lunch break with jas- also tiring. In a different way. Work was ruff bc i didnt feel well. Always a plus. BUT i stuck it out, bc -who is the trooper? leigha is the trooper. i think im gettin' whatever my sister has. Its called fifth's disease, or something equally archaic sounding. It's like the mumps. Who gets that nowadays?? She probably contracted something from those dirty hamsters she is always playing with. Hm. Fifths disease.

Doesn't it seem like it would be serious? i bet that ppl would be more sympathetic if i said i had that intead of a measly cold. i might even get a card in the mail. kudos to cards in the mail!

before work, hung out with dustin for a bit. (seriously just a bit, i had to leave for work in like 5) we have an agreement worked out involving capri sun. Its top secret!! 

After work, went to karaoke night with the gals. (brad: when is it NOT girls night out?) good point. I will make note of that. click click DELETED. i NEEEEED my gals. They get me thru all the boy crap. Duh!

after time at bolts (none of us sang)i just sat over at lisa's for a bit, and now, here i am. There wasnt anything fun happening around, so i just decided to come... (cringe) home. no, im just joshin (who says that) home isn't so bad. In fact its kind of.. well, HOMEY! lol. 

ok, well im gonna go remove jens pants and misty's shirt. WOW that sounds TERRIBLE. see, im borrowing their clothes, and... nevermind.

goodnight, sleep tight, dont let the bed bugs rape you. then you might get pregnant and have bed bug babies.

"event","lets see, Friday i didnt do a whole lot. Mostly slept, and went down to the paintball shop to visit. That night i saw the musical at my old high school with liz. We snuck backstage to tell everyone to break a leg. The show is ""big"". Honestly, who thought it was a good plan to make that movie a musical?? 

One of my good friends, Scot is in it, and he was really funny as the lead. Afterward liz and i split ways. (can you believe it??) She went to a party and i went out with Dustin and the guys. It was pretty fun. (DUSTIN get me ANOTHER capri sun!!!) 

On Saturday i worked all day and then sat at home. Liz went to yellow rose, and she invited me, but i didnt feel like going. Also could have went to a hotel party with brad and scot, but chose to sleep.

yesterday, I got up and went to stillwater for church. After that, i went with greg and liz to walmart and sears to make some returns. *upon viewing the american flag in walmart* Greg: ""hand over heart folks. I pledge allegiance..."" lol

i got to band practice at 6 and went fourwheeling with Charlie (almost tipped!!)We tried to do the whole writing process thing, and that just doesnt work with a big group. Oh well, we actually came up with a song that sounds like it has potential. 

Went out to see ""miracle"" with Liz, ryan, and Jason. I had a really fun time. Back to that tuesday and thursday routine, eh jas?? lol. Cant wait for that. By the way, the movie was very good.

well im taking care of my sister today, so im bout to .. well, do that!!

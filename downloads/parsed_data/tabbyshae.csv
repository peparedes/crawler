You Are Extremely Charming  
 
When someone talks to you, they feel like they are the most interesting person in the world.
And for you in that moment, they actually are.

You truly care about the people you're around, and it's obvious to everyone who meets you.
You are open, warm, friendly, and welcoming. You epitomize charm."

You Act Like You Are 28 Years Old  
 
You are a twenty-something at heart. You feel like an adult, and you're optimistic about life.
You feel excited about what's to come... love, work, and new experiences.

You're still figuring out your place in the world and how you want your life to shape up.
The world is full of possibilities, and you can't wait to explore many of them."

you are to yourself
okay with being by yourself

"event","so im still in kentucky. its been primarily chill. im now at my cusin's house. he has a boston terrier named emma. harley and her play well for the most part. she is about 4 months and a rowdy one at that. weve been out to the purple people bridge and walked to the ohio side. i guess thats one more state on my short ""ive been there"" list. kenucky is a nice place i guess i would decribe it as quaint. just about all of the people have been born and raised here with the intentions of their children to do the same. wylder has a new girlfriend named melissa. the three of us went out to brio on the water last night. a great time: both good food and good company. her son goes to school in alaska. while its not the exact school that i want to go to its fairly close. i want to attend APU. its in Anchoridge and it is a highly regarded university. i am highly interested in this school."

"event","1) Are you looking forward to school starting again soon, or are you not ready for summer to end?
yes. i'm exited for school, i hate being bored. but i have a lovely vacation coming up, i'm going to Emerald Isle NC for a week then orlando for a week. and actually, i'll be in charlotte (well, just north of there) on my way home. we should meet up or somethin.
2) Stars are my favorite shape, but I've never been sure why. Is there any particular reason for your love for them?
well, i really like real stars, like, in the sky.  i just think the sky as a whole is so fascinating. so i like that it's a symbol for the night sky. also, the shape is complex and simple at the same time.  they're cool looking if you drew it perfectly or if you drew it freehand.  i just like em.

3) If you were going somewhere for a really really long time and could on take 5 books and 5 CDs with you, which 5 would you pick?
i would bring the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy series (all bound in one book, of course), She's Come Undone, and maybe a few trashy red dress novels.  yanno, the ones about the girl who jsut got dumped but overcomes it and becomes an amazing new person.  as for cd's i'd take a bright eyes mix, a foo fighters mix, a counting crows mix, Saves The Day - Through Being Cool, and uhhmm....Harvey Danger.  the one with flagpole sitta.

4) Do you prefer red or white wine?
yanno what? i've never had wine. isn't that terrible? well, not really since i can't legally drink yet.  

5) Who would win in a fight: Avril Lavign (I can't spell her damn name) or Justin Timberlake?
dude. justin would kick avril's ass...she may be a tough chick, but he's just too smoooooooth!"

i LOVE stars and starblue comes from the three little blue stars tattooed on my right hip. i also have a larger black star tattooed over theknot at the base of my neck.
2. Where exactly has your journal gone to, I miss it. (Obligatory question mark here --->?)
 yeahh... i'm not sure. my lj client that i've downloaded doesnt always work and i hate going to lj to update. sorry :-/
3. Do you think Shepherd has a pretty campus? 
oh man, i love it. it's BEAUTIFUL.  it's also reallly small, which is really nice and makes walking easy. you should come see it sometime.
4. Do you my roommate, she's from Shepherdstown, Kathy Penwell?
nope.
5. Do you realize how hard these five questions are to think up?
yes, yes i do :)

"event","1. What made you choose Shepherd?
It was cheap, and far enough away from home that it would be a pain in the ass to drive home on a regular basis but close enough to drive home if i needed to.  it's pretty. the comm department is good.  it wasn't wvu (where nearly everyone from my highschool went).

2. You wake up one day and all of a sudden you realize that someone murdered your fish last Thanksgiving break.. that bastard!! Who did it, what was their motive and what will you do about it?
holy shit! poor moby. :-(  Cammy, cos she secretly hates me for moving to her wing and causing problems.  or, Jocelynne, because she's a hoe. and really, probaly nothign because the fish was forty five cents. yeah.

3. You have lots of siblings, remind me of their names, ages and which ones were adopted. I get confused easily.
EmmaLee - 19 (almost 20!) and i'm adopted by my dad
Adopted by both my parents - they are all related to eachother:
ElizaBeth - 12 
Simon - 11
Amee - 9
Malachi - 6
Zachariah - 5

4. Why should everyone in the world love the food network?
why shouldn't they?  it's fun, you learn lots of stuff, the food looks great and it's what all the cool kids are doing!
but seriously, you should watch it. especially chocolate with jaques torres (i probably misspelled that, but the things that man can do with chocolate are amazing) and good eats with alton brown.  he actually talks about the science of cooking, and why certain things do what they do.  and he's funny.

5. Will you teach me to knit so I can strangle you with it?
yes, but i'll run really fast.  buy some needles (size 9) and yarn and i'll teach ya when school starts. it's suuuuuper easy!

"event","EmmaLee
Your first name of Emmalee has given you inspirational, idealistic, and dramatic qualities. You have a clever, deep mind and the talent to excel in highly inspirational lines of endeavour as a dramatist, musician, writer, or artist. You can be lifted by beauty in all forms and are at the most creative when inspired. Your expressive, affectionate nature responds quickly through your feelings, but you must guard against being possessive and jealous. Your delight in mystery and your sensitivity to things you do not understand could draw you into occult studies or religions. Unfortunately, it is difficult for you to retain emotional stability, for you can easily swing into moods of depression and self-pity. Your quick temper can flare up suddenly and be over as suddenly, leaving you very sorry for any suffering you have caused. Inner turbulence can deplete your vitality and cause heart, lung, or bronchial trouble, as well as nervous disabilities.

Breianna
As Breianna you have a great love of nature and the out-of-doors. All the finer things of life and beauties of nature are an inspiration to you and you are attracted to the mysteries of nature. Difficulty in expression results in your being too positive, blunt, and candid in speech and although you are easily offended by others, you do not show it. You crave affection and understanding, but rarely find it as others do not understand you and accuse you of being cool and aloof. The average person would never realize the true depth of your nature. A very individual, independent person, you live within your own thoughts. The insecurity you experience from limited verbal expression and social ease results in a jealous possessiveness and suffering through frustration, repressed emotion, and self-consciousness. This name would cause tension affecting the eyes, teeth, sinuses, ears or throat. There could also be a sensitivity in the heart, lungs, and respiratory organs, and frequent headaches. 

Louise
The name of Louise contains within it an intense emotional power that could drive you to put forth great effort to accomplish your ambitions and to do something noteworthy and worthwhile. There are humanitarian ideals in this name, making you feel the urge to champion the cause of the downtrodden, the victims of circumstances and injustices. However, it is difficult for you to materialize your ideals because of a restless, unsettled feeling which causes you never to know just what it is that you should be working toward, and the very intensity of your nature makes systematic concentration and application a challenge. You can have intensely contrasting feelings toward people, either you are fiercely loyal or extremely intolerant. There is rarely a happy medium in your feelings. Consequently, you experience many disappointments in people, tragedy, and the loss of the very things for which you may be intensely striving. Bitter experiences could make you cynical, critical, and argumentative. You find it difficult to see the brighter or humorous side of a situation. This name makes you nervous and highly strung, causing tension affecting your nervous system and solar plexus."

"event","i just finished eating some chicken, which was probably a bad idea since i just finished throwing up.  i'm tired.  i went to walmart at seven am with my grandparents to get stocking stuffers.  we went so early to beat the crowds. then, we ate at ruby tuesday's, which was really great the first time and terrible the second time when it came back up.  sorry, that was a little graphic.  

i'm so sick of being sick.  i didnt throw up at school.  after i threw up, i had to wait for the toilet to refill before i could flush it away.  it was awful.  then, i went into the kitchen and started to cry.  i told my dad that i threw up and i hate crying in front of him. i just hate it. anyhow, i felt a lot better, so  i thought i would eat the chicken, but it's really spicy.  maybe it was a bad idea.  i should've filled the perscription the day i got it damn me.  

it really goes without saying, but i HATE being sick. i HATE it.  i have so much to do, i have a room to clean and christmas presents to finish and i just dont have time for this.  and i'm sick of it. my stomach has been bothering me since october. this is getting old.

"event","heh. i feel like an old lady.  so, yesterday i was in the emergency room all day trying to get something done.  al that happened was that i got a cat scan and i sat in the er all day.  the catscan returned back normal, so it's not my appendix.  why don't the doctors listen when i say that i think it might be a food allergy?  why?  

so, today, i had a follow up appointment with my doctor.  he finally listened to me and said that it might be a food allergy along with stress.  i have had a pretty stressful semester.  so, i'm on a no dairy diet for two weeks and i have to write down everything i eat.  i have another appointment the wednesday before i go back to school.  i hope everything is setteled down by then.  my dr. also gave me ""nerve pills for my stomach""  heh.  i imagine my stomach having a nervous breakdown when i think of that.  

today, at our little meeting one of my youth ministers and i were talking about it and she said that for a few months a few years ago the same thing happened to her.  she was feeling really stressed out and milk made her stomach turn for several months.  when she wasn't so stressed out, it stopped.  that made me feel a little better.

so, that's the update, nothing new, really.  but i feel better

i keep thinking about how it's milk that does this and i suddenly want to go vegan.  maybe i'll try it when i'm starting to feel better.  the only problem with being vegan is that  i'm allergic to fruit, so that would make it extremely hard.  *sigh* maybe i should go see a food allergist.


okay.  enough about my old lady ailments."

I HATE RLO!! i hate them more than ANYTHING i've ever hated in my entire life.  This morning, at 830, Libby (housing coordinator) called me to make sure that i knew that i had a roommate moving in!  for those of you that dont know, i have a single room because my roommate moved out mid-semester.  anyhow, i immideatly started bawling and yelling and just generally being very angry before i went and talked to my RA.  I had asked her before Lis (old roommate) moved out to get me any forms i needed so that i could have a single room. i would even pay the extra fees!  she never brought me any papers, so i just assumed that everything was fine.  well, obviously, i was wrong.  

i'm so tired and frustrated and rlo makes me want to drop out of school forever.  i'm thinking about writing an article for the picket and possibly other area papers describing how RLO has screwed me and various other people over.

i have a meeting later today.  i'll post the results from that later"

"event","I guess this goes out to my freakin so called 'family' *sigh*....Hard days made me depressed...


hard nights shaped me
I dont know they somehow saved me
And I know Im making something out of this life they called nothing
I take what I want
Take what I need
You say its wrong but its right for me
I wont look down
Wont say Im sorry
I know that only God can judge me

And if I make it thru today will tomorrow be the same
Am I just running in place?
If I stubble and I fall
Should I get up and carry on or will it all just be the same

cause, Im young and hopeless
Im lost and I know this
Im going nowhere fast thats what they say
Im troublesome, Ive fallen
Im angry at my father
Its me against this world and I dont care, I dont care

No one in this industry understands the life I lead
When I sing about my past its not a gimmick not an act
These critics and these trust fund kids
Try to tell me what punk is but when I see them on the streets
They got nothing to say

And if I make it thru today will tomorrow be the same
Am I just running in place?
If I stubble and I fall
Should I get up and carry on or will it all just be the same

cause, Im young and hopeless
Im lost and I know this
Im going nowhere fast thats what they say

Its me against this world and I dont care, I dont care.....

Man i love this song...Good charolette 'yound and hopeless'
...hell i feel like crapp right now...my sisters a bitch i hate her and everyone in this house ...basterds...they were never there for me EVER. they dont kno who i am anymore or anything! last year my mom freakin forgot my birthday and only 2 person rememberd  (altair and shy) it..god...sometimes i wish i could just die and the world wont even kno it. But im living only for one thing...Jayden. My sister shys kid, i wanna see him grow up and all those things. But i dont really know anymore what i wanna do.....i should just start drinking again or get high...yes i used to drink and get high...every weekend or either every day. thats only because i was depressed and lost. It really sucked . I changed though and stopped because my first nephew was born yup.........i donno......i think i wanna go to a new years party and just get buzzed ..no no NO! im not gonna! ill just go stay in RB for awhile my sister shy said i could.......well.....look to who ever reads this? sorry...i just get like this sometimes...im just...young and hopeless tho heheh......."

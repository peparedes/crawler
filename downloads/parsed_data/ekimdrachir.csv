I'm uncertain if I should delete this blog, or just delete some posts. I would have to read them all again to do that though and I am not sure if I want to. I wonder if anyone else reads this, and what they might think of me if they did. Life is such a strange experience, but valuable, somehow."

"event","And it seems that I have the most to say when its as such. But I don't like it, and I don't want to feel this way all the time. I don't, I've never been an overly negative person, but as evidenced by this journal, as well as life as of late, its harder and harder to keep a smile on my face. Maybe its because I'm tired of having no place to vent my thoughts, besides the internet of course. Maybe its a number of things in my life, making negativity more prominent. Or maybe its that this world is not a happy place, and if people don't face up to the cold hard facts, how can you ever get past them? I want to face up to the darkness as well as the light, otherwise I suffer in denial of half the story. I want to focus on the light, but how can I know joy unless I've known the depths of sadness? Good question."

I went to work, in Electronics. The day went well, I sold a PS2, 3 game boy advance SPs and a $600 HDTV (for which they paid cash for).

Britney was wasted beyond beleif by the time we got there, and the rest of them weren't doing bad either. Garett and I were the only ones who were essentially sober. I saw Lance, my old buddy from Grade 11.

My Dad told me tonight that I treat women like crap.

Made me feel great, especially considering I feel like shit already about the disagreements Crystal and I have had over this summer. 

Way to pin all the guilt on me. I might expect that from my Mom, but my Dad has been supportive the entire time (until now) and it's been a big relief to me.

I know he was joking, but it still makes me feel like shit.

I take pride in knowing that I have never been abusive, and that I am a nice guy. Crystal and I have fought over alot of things, and it used to get pretty aggressive since we both have such hostile personalities, and such short tempers. 

She doesn't back down, and I am trying to learn not to either. As a result, we would fight and I would have my side heard whether she wanted to or not. I tried to be caring and compassionate, but when all she does is tear me apart I get fed up and leave.

Better to leave and let her cool down, right?
WRONG.

I've been reading a book lately, and it told me today that the worst thing you can do in a relationship is leave when you get into an argument. Especially when a woman doesn't understand why you are leaving.

Men deal with problems by going into their 'cave' and thinking deeply about it.
Women deal with problems by talking about it with people they care about.

I could go on, but there are more important things to talk about.

I bought tickets to Nine Inch Nails! That means on September 10th it's my birthday, September 20th i'm going to System of a Down/The Mars Volta, and then on November... 19th? I'm going to NIN.

I enjoy the simple things in life. I have a problem with overcomplicating things, and that is a downfall I have to learn to surpass. If I can enjoy the simple things more, and take advantage of everything that comes my way, then I can have a hope of acheiving more.

I want to record another album. Its something I haven't done in over a year, and I think its past due. I should talk to Rob, even though he isn't going to be back until September. Ian asked me to play bass in his band, but I don't have a bass amp at the moment-- and financial investments have already been made in College. PLUS I don't have time to committ to practicing.

Recording a CD is different. You don't need to perfect playing as a group. Of course one of these records isn't meant to make me a rock star-- that isn't the point. The point is having something concrete that you can say ""I did this"" with. It's an experience of creating music and having the complete and absolute freedom to do with it what you want. It also means not being tied down by the social politcs of orchestrating a band.

Once again I don't want to overcomplicate things.

Summer's always been a hard period for me. In 2000 I was in the Hospital... 2001 I was falling out with friends downtown... 2002 I was going through a breakup and smoking a lot of pot... 2003 wasn't bad, although I was tied down and had no life beyond rehearsal and a girlfriend... 2004 I worked all summer at Wal-Mart, and was with Crystal... and this year i'm back at Wal-Mart and Crystal and I are separated, so i'm dealing with that.

Next year, I want to travel. I am going to work at Production Lighting (or some other stage related job) and save. Then i'm going to buy my parent's old 96' Lincon Towncar; i'll give it a new transmission, an interior touch up and a Shiny Black paint job... oh yeah, and put a new key-hole in the engine, and fix the drivers side door. I'll spend the summer visiting friends around Canada-- go to Victoria, and end up in Montreal to visit my family out there.

While i'm out and about, i'm planning on revising/perfecting my DVD Portfolio, since it's already 2 years out of date."

I go to Concerts. So far this year I have seen: Slipknot, Queens of the Stone Age, Green Day, My Chemical Romance, The Heck, and Bif Naked. In September I am going to see The Mars Volta/System of a Down, and in November I have tickets for Nine Inch Nails.

"event","The countdown says twelve hours, thirteen minutes. Personally I am excited, but I have other things on my mind. Things like HotDog Buns, which need to be purchased tomorrow around 5:30pm... People like Crystal, who forever is etched into my mind. That face, that smile, those eyes, those incredible legs, stomache, breasts... Sorry, i'm going on and on here. Anyways, I love her so much.

I finished all the preliminary work that I had to do thismorning. My High School Transcript was sent to the College. My homework is all done. I still have to have that alien lock removed from my locker so I can move in... I will not be working for my uncle, and I still have to talk to Mel. He wasn't there when I called thismorning.

Woody says everything is rockin for tomorrow night. We have a fire pit, the house is ready... The only concern is rain, and nobody wanting to be outside. Krystina says that she may not be able to make the cake by herself. Rachel ditched on it, and left her hanging. I understand her predicament.

There are so many people here at the college that I don't know. So many different types of people. I could not possibly meet them all... Or could I? Would I want to? Is it even relevant?

CNN Weather says there will be showers tomorrow night. I havent checked the local, but weather reports are useless anyways.

I am excited to see Crystal today. She will be at work when I get there, and I don't know when she is off... Hopefully she will be closing with me. This new schedule of me leaving early in the morning, her working, and us both getting home late and sleeping is a huge adjustment for the both of us. I miss her terribly, and I know she feels the same way about me. I leave her notes to let her know I am thinking about her, but I can't help but feel it is inadequate... but it is the best I can do at present.

My plans as of late are erratic, and need to be formulated properly in order to get my head straight. I think I will do that today, and then post it later on... If at all.

Right now I have to go and talk to Su-Fan about sound tech..."

"event","Well, this is it. I start College today. It's just orientation, but since I am in tech everything starts up right away. We will be starting work on the show tomorrow. It's going to be rough around here, I can see it already. Crystal is concerned because she is afraid we are never going to see eachother anymore. I just want her to know that I love her, and we will get through it just like we get through everything else. At least we still have Sundays! That's more than the 18 freaking painful days that I had to wait in between to see her when we first met, and she was living in Innisfail. This should be cake-walk compared to that!

I'm taking the bus up there with Josh, being at that stop at 1:35, which means I have to leave downtown on the 15 at 1:15. I have to buy a bus pass at City Hall today. Which means I have to catch the bus here at 12:25 in order to do it. There, now I have that straight.

Now, I have stuff to do thismorning!"

"event","Crystal is happy today. She is having so much fun redecorating her room, and shopping... And when she is happy, I am happy.

Yesterday Crystal was going to go out with Cecelia, but she never called back. It's really too bad that she hasn't been able to spend any time with friends, but on the other hand it's nice being with her everyday. We are 'glued' to eachother, but that's alright. I wouldn't want to be glued to anyone else.

At the farmers market I bought some popcorn... It was excellent. We got Crystal's stuff at Wal-Mart, and then went to the DQ Grill And Chill. I would reccomend the place to anyone. They serve you like in a resteraunt, and the food there is amazing. Way better than the regular DQ.

I came home, helped bring Crystal's stuff to her room. I played my guitar for a bit,  and then played Spiderman 2. I am now 51.5% done the game.

I am on Vacation, and since I have been so busy this summer, its nice to not have anything to do. At 3 I would like to go out and check out some Garage Sales that are happening in our neighborhood... Maybe pick up another movie... Crystal wants to I think. It's also ""Little Jenn""'s 18th Birthday today... Whoa... Thats really weird. Jenn Dunhill... I haven't written down the name in a long time, and it looks really weird... I'm tripping out here man!! Aaaahhh!! Okay, it's back to normal.

Last night at the Video Store (dropping off KILL BILL 2; WHICH ROCKED!) I saw my friend Daryll Bedford, who just happens to be the 19 year old Convergy's Employee who is running for Mayor of Red Deer... I had a chat with him about his ideas and vision for red deer. All the best to him.

I don't have much else to say at this time.

I love Crystal so much."

"event","I have good news and bad news.

Good news is; things are resolved with Crystal and I, Matt is home from jail under total house arrest, Woody is hanging out more often, Most of the house is clean right now, and we are going hiking out through the Blackfoot Gap Sunday to Wednesday!

Bad news though; My bike is beyond repair, and there may not be those cheap ones at Wal-Mart anymore, I don't know what I will say in order to return my GameBoy ($160) and Spiderman 2 Strategy Guide ($20), and whatever else I may come across that I purchased but have yet to find the value in.

Me and Matt are tackling the back yard, and so I will attempt to elaborate the details of that here. Today when Crystal goes to work, I will go with her (with those return items). I will buy grass seed, new hinges for the gate, and a new lock for the deck. I will also buy a bike, and thats how I will get home.

I will trim the hedge thisafternoon. Tomorrow morning, Matt and I will fill the holes in all of the yard, and get ready to seed the grass. We may end up doing that on Sunday morning.

While we are gone camping, hopefully, we dont get hit with a drought, and the grass will grow. Keeping it that way may involve being out with Kira when she is.

There is a Ladlazer 18 speed left... but its a pinkish color... thats the only $100 one left... according to the lady from Toys... I will have to look myself... damn...

I wonder what the hell I will say... ""Yeah, this is the wrong manual"" ""But it says here on the receipt that you bought it WITH spiderman 2"" ""yeah, but i need the one for the original"". And the gameboy- ""it wasn't the right color for my brother. he's very picky, and he wouldn't even take it as a present.""

Hahaha!

But seriously, if I can return those two things, i'll have an extra $180 bucks..."

"event","I find it hard to place how I feel these days. It's been hard, and it's made me realize alot about who I am and what I have done, how I behave towards those closest to me.

I went and saw Matt in the Calgary Youth Offenders Prison. I couldn't even talk to him without crying. One step, one step too far is all it took. One step that I could have helped him prevent. One step that I neglected to see, and now he is there. He was doing all those things in a cry for attention... for whom? Dad, Mom? No. For me, and I ignored it.

I am not dwelling on the past, or trying to let it get me down. I am just seeing what I have been ignoring. I am so sorry Matt, for letting you grow this way. When you get out, things are going to change. I am working on it here, spending less and less time watching TV and on the computer... the last two days or so I have been playing Spiderman 2 alot, and it's been helping me cope. It gets my mind off of what's happening, but allowing me to think about it at the same time.

Mom and Dad are taking it really hard too, the whole family is. They just show it in a different way. They have alot harder a shell, having gone through so much already they know how to deal with it emotionally to more of an extent than me. I can't condense, zone or eat at work without being overwhelmed to the point of tears that Matthew is spending his time in a cell, alone, doing nothing, allowed nothing. This is a huge adjustment for us all, and I just have to keep on moving, one step at a time.

Crystal has been distant lately as well. Probably my own fault too, but as I need more and more support she seems to move farther and farther away. I guess we deal with things differently. She wants me to get over it and get on with things. The thing is, I can't ignore it any longer. If I do, then this whole situation is a waste. I pray for everyone I have every day. I thank God for giving me such a beautiful girl, a strong girl who has overcome so much. I thank God for not condemning me for my actions, and giving me so much when I deserve so little... but then am filled with anguish because Matt has not turned to him yet. I pray it happens before it gets worse for him.

His trial is on Thursday. I will be there. I am glad I have three days off. I need the time to think, the time alone to do stuff, or to do nothing, and the freedom to do either. The way work went on Monday, I don't know if I would be able to do it today or tomorrow without breaking down again.

I miss being able to touch Crystal. To put my arm around her and not have her cringe away, or ignore me. I try hard to explain what it is I would like her to do, but in the end it's all about what I THINK I need, and realizing that I don't really need it all that bad.

Anyways, tomorrow is another day. Crystal works, but I am not sure what time. Mom and Dad work, which means I will be here with Erik most of the day. I won't be playing Spiderman, I am tired of it. I'll probably do more writing, because I seem to straighten things out more inside when I write them out. It's no solution, but a successful process.

Woody is right. Things have to change inside me before it's too late. Mom is right as well, I have to build healthy routines before it's too late as well. It means starting RIGHT NOW. Eating healthy, excercising, sleeping at night... its just so freaking hot in the summertime... Not spending money on things that get used up... Cleaning, and taking care of myself and my space. My room is a mess, and I don't have room to stretch out yet. I have to have faith that it is coming soon enough. I waiting patiently for the Suzuki Sidekick, and according to Dad it's coming back! That means I will get to take my drivers test, and then have vehicular transportation.

One step... and faith."

"event","So my younger brother is in jail. He has a preliminary hearing next Thursday. Today he is shipping down to the Calgary Remand Center. I may not see him for a long time.

The hardest part is that we all saw this coming. We all knew something of this nature was going to happen, but we had no way of helping him, we couldn't fix it. I feel kind of like my mom, knowing all the while that something was going to happen to me in Wisconsin, but having to let me go. Only jail isn't like getting hit by a boat.

I just hope that he learns his lession. I will continue to pray for him constantly, and if anyone would like to do the same I appreciate it.

It's time to set the past behind and support Matthew through this time. He may not even know that his family is here for him (my dad wasn't allowed to see him yesterday), but we are all unifying for him. Woody is spending more time with the family, taking care of Erik when he needs to.

I work at four, Crystal at three. We both are missing money on our paychecks, so at work i will deal it. Crystal is buying tanning minutes and doing 15 today. When she gets back, Erik, her and I will go to bower mall so we can get bus passes, and she can go to work. I am also buying Spiderman 2."

So much fun! After school, me and krista were bored so we went to the library and wrote in our LJ and waited for caitlin so we could get ready for the movies and Ruby's..haha that ryhmed! Originally it was my krista caitlin elise kody will and chase. Then after we ate at Ruby's Nate met up with us as we were walking down the peir. THEN Zack and Curtis also met with us when we were buyin the tickets. The movie part of the night was pretty lame, thats why me and cailting walked outta TWO movies in like 30 mins...lol. Will, Curtis Zack and Nate decided not to see the movie and so as me and cait are walking down the stairs to get to main street i say ""i wonder if the other guys are still here?"" We turn the corner, and there they were! It was crazy....we got candy, hung out and waited for the love birds to get outta the movie. Shortly after that elise kody and will left....then the rest of us got a little craaaazy and went to play in the sand..it was soooo fun and hopefully we will all hang again REAL soon!!</FONT></P>

SLEEPING"" There was no way that was how i was going to start off a great weekend. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;go online....whoopy. SO&nbsp;I&nbsp;start talkin to Amanda and we decide we're going to go to peirside and scope out the hotties that WERE'NT there! But we saw 13 going on 30. It was a cute movie, totally a chick flick. Then after that us being dumb decide to get baskin robbins and walk out on the peir which was a WAY bad idea cuz it was freezing!! but the ice cream was soo delicious! Then after that we went to the vintage store..cool stuff lemme tell you! then i went home and online i went..lol</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#666666>Saturday-</FONT> <FONT color=#000099>Woke up at about 9:45 ish and got a little phone call from bryan asking if i was going to acompany him at nic's party....i said yah, and flaked. What a horrible person I am! Sry bry bry..haha And THEN i got a call from bobby and stephen to go to the beach which sounded totally cool cuz i have't been in a few weeks. So we went and the water was like ice when u first got in but you know, once you get numb you cant really feel anything right? It was cool, we were listen to music, gettin all hot and BURNT(but hey at least ive got a better tan ;-)) haha, that looks like s double chin! how cute! After the beach..me and my dad got kind bored soo...if you guys didnt know we're like re-doing our house and if you have never seen it in our living room we HAD wood panels on one wall that were just horrid..so as i said we got bored and decide to jus rip them down! nice quality bonding time...It felt so awesome ripping that crap off the wall,&nbsp;I felt like super women! haha..</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#666666>Sunday-</FONT> <FONT color=#009900>When with my mom to get a few new things for out house to make it look all perdy and what not...we got some cute stuff. It was a lot of fun shopping for house stuff...maybe its jus cuz i want to do interour design for a living..cuz im sure if anyone else would have done this they would have been bored as heck. I also got new shorts and a cute new shirt. After all that i called my pal woody who DIDNT PICK UP HER PHONE so we couldnt hang the freak out! So im bored as heck and im like diiiieing to go to the beach, so i call up krista and she cant go!&nbsp;I was bummed but me cassie and ryan went anyway....we surfed and yah, can we say SHIT? I think I got like ONE good wave..it was bad. Then&nbsp;I come home to a wonderful dinner with my fam and my brothers girl friend..man&nbsp;I wish I had a freaking boyfriend..anyone think they're up for the job? lol </FONT></P>

When something real bad happens in our life the first thing you think of is to jus quit and give up..but thats not any way to help or solve your problem. Think of all the friends/family that you will be hurting, and yourself. Death is not the way to solve anything. Its a very scary thing and it makes us all worried to death. Most everyone is afraid of losing family or friends or bf/gf w.e. It scares me to death to think that someone close would ever leave my side..its really depressing and it makes me want to cry. If you ever are having a bad day or going through something real rough....TALK to someone. DONT do anything rational talk it out, make things better. Your life is to precious to give up...</FONT></STRONG></P>

It sucked cuz&nbsp;I only got about 5 to 6 hours of sleep last night and i have thee WORST pain in my knees and my shin splints keep getting 10x worse....which could be real bad in the long run. If anyone knows somewhere&nbsp;I can go to get them rubbed out plz tell me! Im Dieing! Ah the pain and agony! Okay I got over it..So about the meet today! I dont know how we did over all...all I know is that i got 4'4 in high jump and 12'10 in long jump....i definatly did NOT do my best in LJ cuz my P.R. is 14'2...thats like a 2 feet dif! I am so not consistant when i jump for long jump. I always get like...in the low 12's for my first jump, then i work my way up higher as i go on. But unfortunatly i took some crappy advice from a fellow teamate...and i effin scratched! gbgoubglj Thats the last time i listen to her! She told me i sould try moving back about an inch..so i do, then what haps? wellll i scratch by and inch! gah, i'll do better next time for sure! Our first dual meet is this week at Huntington Beach H.S. You guys should all go and check it out! Its not THAT boring! Well if you really love me then you will go! I love you all!</P>

For those of you who didnt hear, i was violated by a spider today, yes thats right a spider.....not by ryan not by my coach not by your mom...by a spider. It&nbsp;was nestled&nbsp;up under my boob.....I almost started crying i am so afraid of spiders, my eyes were watering. :( thanks to paul i didnt die! It was huge! big, black,&nbsp;red and hairy! eww gives me the creeps jus thinkin about it! ah! Anyway today was a great day besides my meet! </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh and by the way bryan ""Alone Kaylee Dies"" has to be the best song ever written to me...er should i say only? And actually, it wasnt the best cuz it talks about me having no friends and killing myself.....DAMN YOU TO H-E-DOUBLE HOCKEY STIX!</P>

I kicked major ass wednsday! In high jump i placed 3rd and in pole vault i placed 4th! that is awesome b/c i had only practiced pole vault 2 days before the meet...outta this whole year! man oh man! this year is gunna be so rad for me i can jus feel it! You have no idea how excited i am for track to have FINALLY started! gosh i feel like such a geek! Noramlly people dread it when season finally comes for whatever sport they play, but no not I! Tomorrow, or should i say today, &nbsp;i have to wake up at 7 in the morn! jesus! what did&nbsp;i get myself into! but hey! this meet should earn me some varsity points (cuz im running varsity) and then ill be that much closer to getting my letter! </FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT color=#999999>Ive been in the mood to write lately, heres something i just wrote a few minutes ago, if u dont like it, i dont give a shit. Here goes nothing...</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT color=#ff9966>There i stood, waiting in antispation to hear the sound of the gun go off. As sweat drips from my face, I wonder; Will i lose it all? Drop everything i had such a tight grip of ? Or win big? Only time could tell. As the seconds raced by, it felt like hours. Giving it my all, pushing myself as hard as I could. I wanted this more then anything, not only did i want this, i needed it, for the team. If I could just show them how good i can really be, just maybe I'd be apreciated or maybe just left behind the shadows where now stood. Just for once i want to be heard. I want them to see how good i can really be. Their time had almost run out..my time was gone. Had i succeded? Only time can tell....</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#666666><STRONG><FONT size=4>Saturday</FONT></STRONG>- Woke up around 10 and went to hang with the coolest girl ever. We went to the mall and got new outfits oh man are they hot! After we went back to shannons and were bored so we took a walk over to casey's house to say hi. We hung out there with aubrie, caroline casey, tyler and brandon. very cool people let me tell you. And around 5ish me and shannon were gettin a little hungry so we go back to shannons and cal heather to see if she wants to go to Islands. long story short, we ended up not going! bummer! instead we jus had a movie night and watched scary movie and fast times at ridgemont high. We also picked up dontes peak b/c that movie is cool, but we didnt end up watching it. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#666666><STRONG><FONT size=4>Sunday</FONT></STRONG>-Again woke up at about 10 and got krispy creams at shannons yay.

Around 5 i had to leave kbfujbrfura cuz my mom had dinner ready and she wanted me home...but i didnt wanna go! But on the bright side i had my favorite: chicken, baked potatoes and corn.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT color=#999999>So last night i get ready for bed around...11:30ish. I brushed my teeth and all that good stuff. I go in my room to find my stupid cat thinking that he can jus invade my bed when ever the eff he pleases...so i kick him out and get all snug n warm. To no suprise the little bugger cat of mine comes back in my room, so i throw him out....</FONT><STRONG><FONT color=#33ff33>acidently hitting him against the wall</FONT></STRONG><FONT color=#999999>...as he tried to walk away, i relise that he is limping. I think i broke one of his back legs..Anywho. I lay impatiently in bed wishing i was asleep, but i keep</FONT> <FONT color=#cc66cc><STRONG>thinkin about this one thing that&nbsp;has been&nbsp;on my mind a lot lately</STRONG>.</FONT> <FONT color=#999999>So by 12:30 I drift away to my happy place where i dreamt of tons of</FONT> <STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>midgets</FONT></STRONG> <FONT color=#999999>filled in a room w/ no windows, all</FONT> <STRONG><FONT color=#ffff00>getting high</FONT></STRONG><FONT color=#999999>...hm. Then around 2 i wake up to this god awful buzzing in my ear...i thought it was a fly, but there seemed to be no fly anywhere around. So i put my pillow over my head and doze off once again to my happy place where i dreamt about some extremely</FONT> <FONT color=#ff9900><STRONG>tall and very short men</STRONG> </FONT><FONT color=#999999>dancing around</FONT> <FONT color=#ff0000 size=5>naked</FONT><FONT color=#999999>...hmmm. Sooooo at like..3:30 i awake ONCE AGAIN to this horrible noise that was MUCH louder then jus some buzzing in my ear. It was more like the sound of a bomb..yes a bomb in my room. While im searching for this thing that i think is about to</FONT> <FONT color=#33ffff><STRONG>selfdistruct and kill me</STRONG> </FONT><FONT color=#999999>at any moment, i relize that this noise wasnt comming from my room, it was a stupid car horn goin off. It cont'd to go off for about 20 to 30 mins untill the car battery died which u could tell when that happened cuz the horn was changing tunes...soothing? i think not. Finally i get back to sleep, shortly to wake up to MORE noise! This time it was an effin car alarm! my gosh, what a horrible nights sleep, it was so unbelievably loud i thought my heads was going to</FONT> <STRONG><FONT color=#ffffff>explode</FONT></STRONG><FONT color=#999999>! By this time it is about...4:45 in the morn. I wake up ooo around 5:20 in the morning cuz other wise if i dont wake up early i will be half asleep when im at skool (sounds weird but i jus ly in bed for like 20 mins and it wakes me up...sometimes) So this alarm doesnt go off till about 5......and i TRY to get the last 20 mins of sleep, but no. MY alarm goes off and i wanter to</FONT> <STRONG><FONT color=#33ff33>scream</FONT></STRONG>,<FONT color=#999999> so i did and oh what a relief it twas.....</FONT></P>

When we got there we first watched elimidate which is an awesome show...except when weird freakish girls come on the show looking for vampires and elfs....if you saw that one you would understand. Then Bryans mommy made us some hot dogs and we all chowed down. Then we got a little crazy up in thur and we had a pillow fight! havent had one of those in a while. oh we also did slip n slide...only we improvised and used pillows on the tile, and we played ""PILLOW"" kinda like horse. Then shanno and i headed back to her house, and oh boy was that a blast....ryan mike and stephen show up at her window with lighters and lighter fluid stuff...and lit themselfs on fire. Stephen, being the only smart one, jus was there to beat the shit outta them..i mean beat them so the fire would go out.</FONT></P>

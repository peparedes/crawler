"event","fuckin A, i had to recover seriously from the weekend. i haven't partied like that in forever. or maybe never. 
i'm still working on my relationship with my drug. setting up guidelines. don't wanna get too deep. still got a lot i need to attend to. don't need to be in a haze all the time. not now. save that for when i live on the beach. 
sobriety has its place. reality sux sometimes, but it feels good to be back after that fucking weekend.
but then, i don't really want to do anything. i just wanna chill at home. i'm sick of all the stress and responsiblity. sick of it."

"event","fucking bitch.
she's all smiley cuz everything in her fucking life is all great and shit, and then she starts telling me to stop biting my nails. why? i have no fucking clue. but she does. so i say, no, fuck you and flip her off. she was reminding me of my mother. so then she decides that i am in a bad mood and that she will henceforth avoid me for the rest of the day, or until my bad mood subsides. which is fine with me. i don't give a shit. i understand if someone doesn't want to deal with me. whatever. but then she gets on fucking IM and starts telling me about how she is so tolerant of me and that i should be more tolerant of her, and that she is diplomatic and that i get on her case about all her stupid fucking bad habits (what habits?) blah blah blah. so i say, ok, whatever. if you don't want to talk to me, why the fuck are you IMing me? but she logged off before i could send that last message. and then she just proceeds to ignore me. well FUCK HER. fucking bitch. i don't want to be friends with someone so pathetic and idiotic as her.

as a matter of fact, i don't know that i want to be friends with anyone. friends take too much work. all that tolerating, and trying to understand, and diplomacy. fuck it. i'm headed for hermitville."

"event","i don't know why. i feel depressed. maybe it's cuz i feel suddenly empty. like i put forth all this effort and i had all this pressure, and now it's gone. just like that. gone. no more. i have all these other things i want / need to do right now but i don't feel like doing any of it. i kind of just want to lay on the bed and watch mindless tv or movies i've seen a million times, but...instead i'm online, writing in this journal about how depressed i am. maybe depressed isn't the right word. but i'm definitely down or something. blech."

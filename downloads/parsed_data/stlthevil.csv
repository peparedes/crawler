"event","I had a very good day pottering about DC today.  I decided to kick-start my Christmas shopping today and headed downtown to hit as many museum gift shops as I could manage while the weather was still good (it was sunny and in the 40's today, not bad at all - last year I waited until December and nearly froze to death making this run!).  I only managed five museums, as it happened, which is still respectable, and found good stuff at most places.  

My favorite prize today is a *very* oversize, full-color book with pages from the Necksei Bible (was created in Hungary sometime between 1135 and 1340, apparently).  Over 200 pages of gorgeous plates showing illuminations and script, and just beautiful!  I found it all by itself in a corner of the Library of Congress gift shop, lugged it up to the cash register and asked what the price was - expecting it to be well out of my price range; I'd guesstimated it at $150-200, based on similar works.  The shop attendant ran the search on the computer and did this marvelous double-take before calling another lady over to verify what she was seeing on the screen.  It was only $40.00!!  So needless to say, I took it home with me. :)  Only problem with that was that the Library of Congress was my *first* stop today, so I've been lugging this huge heavy tome all day.  But it was sooooo worth it!  That book is for me, but I did actually manage to find good stuff for family members, too. 

Came home, settled in with gingerbread, hot cider, and ""Hunt for Red October.""  All in all, a most satisfactory day..."

A mythical being of Chinese mythology, comparable<br>with the western unicorn. Ki-lin personifies<br>all that is good, pure, and peaceful. It lives<br>in paradise and only visits the world at the<br>birth of a wise philosopher.  The Ki-Lin is<br>said to walk on earth and on water. It never<br>drinks or eats dirty food or water. The Chinese<br>unicorn never treads on smaller animals below<br>its feet nor does it ever harm another living<br>creature. The Ki-Lin is the emblem for<br>exquisite goodness, longevity, grandeur,<br>endless compassion and great wisdom. According<br>to Chinese mythology, at the birth of Confucius<br>a Ki-Lin appeared and Confucius died soon after<br>a Ki-Lin was killed, he believed that his<br>writings would not proceed from the omen of the<br>death of the Unicorn.

"event","I finally got around to watching ""King of Masks"" this weekend; this is a Chinese film set in the 1930's about... well, it's about one man's quest for a son, and one girl's quest for a family, I guess.  <lj user=""eeedge""> recommended this movie in her LJ some time ago and asked what I thought about it, so I'm going to try my first LJ cut and see if this works!

<lj-cut text=""Brief movie review and rambling on art""> 
I think this is a really great movie.  The story is compelling (and while it doesn't have the classic tragic ending seemingly required of Chinese movies, it sure came close to having one!) and the entire thing was just beautiful.  The King and the girl were wonderfully cast and totally convincing; and I loved the fact that the opera singer *is* in fact an opera singer (I looked it up), because he sure looked and acted like one!  The subtitles weren't bad at all, and I was really grateful to have them, because these actors spoke typical Mandarin - that's as opposed to the Mandarin learnt in classrooms and textbooks, which is what I'm familiar with!  The whole thing was beautiful.

Despite the absence of a tragic downer of an ending, I do think this film is about a tragedy, one that was probably just beginning in the 1930's, and that is the loss of so many wonderful traditional Chinese art forms.  Sichuan opera, the magic masks, even the storytellers and acrobats, all have really become relics in China, if they've survived at all.  There's no vibrancy to them anymore, they're no longer living art forms.  I suspect there are a number of reasons for this, the Communists' rise to power and the Cultural Revolution chief among them, but I wonder if they would have survived if that part of history were different.  Could they have survived the import of Western ideas and the growth of capitalism?  I did a paper once on the decline of Chinese teahouses and the impact that had on Chinese storytelling and similar art forms, I should go dig that up.

By the by, as I watched this movie, I remembered the first time I saw mian-lian, the mask transformations.  It was a TV special on the induction of several people into some kind of magic ""hall of fame.""  The performance was incredible, I absolutely could not believe my eyes!  And the magician was - wait for it - a woman.  :)
</lj-cut>

And by the way, I would definitely recommend this movie!  Now I have to track down ""Yellow Earth"" and ""The Emperor and the assassin,"" both by the same director (Chen Kaige)..."

On a related thought, here's a suggestion to anyone campaigning for the US presidency: Why not propose a four-day work week?  Admittedly, it wouldn't get far, but if they made the proposal public on a Monday, it could really catch on briefly!  A different suggestion I heard that I kind of like, why not have each president establish their own national holiday?  (Can you guess who doesn't have enough vacation days to suit her? <g>)"

Skye is a warrior-hero-adventure-goddess who can't swim, and says things like ""If you think you frighten me - then you're a pretty perceptive bad guy.""

Life must be tough to be a warrior-hero-adventure-goddess.  She dies constantly, is always running places, leaping into suicidal situations, and has to put up with the incompetence of her gamer. (Note to self: hurling stone fungus at carnivorous eels is not terribly effective.)"

How on earth do huge black flies get in to my apartment?  I have two sets of doors between me and the outside, and I have only been through them twice today.

Boogie Knights performed, and I consequently now have their two CD's and am awaiting their next one. :)  Lady Mondegreen was marvellous, with really beautiful music and a song called ""One Thousand Ships"" that was too silly for words.  And it's always a treat to hear <lj user=""catalana""> play, even though I generally fell asleep too early to hear her play as much as I'd have liked to!  But she did play some of her new songs which I've been hoping to hear.

Of course, there seem to be two inevitable consequences to going to a filk con (okay, this is only my second one, but I bet I'm right!).  One: I get really fun music stuck in my head for several days!  Two: I always come away wanting to try it myself.  Maybe this time I'll actually do something about that...  But who knows. <g>

It was nice - I was more interested than I'd expected to be, but I'll admit to a bias because I'd been lobbying to visit the National Cathedral today. :)  I can't get over how much Washington did with that old farmhouse.  They have this very neat exhibit where they show that, in fact, the house is built of wood - although I would have sworn it was made of stone!  They applied several coats of paint and white sand to the exterior of the house to give it a white stone appearance.  And they painted grain *onto* the wood to give it the appearance of burled (spelling? berled, birled, burled?  Much grain.) wood, which was also very convincing.  I am impressed - and inspired!  What cool craft ideas!

Of course, Washington also painted his informal dining room a shade of green that I imagine made all of his guests look slightly ill.  I love green, I generally have nothing against it as a color, but this crayola-crayon green was a bit overpowering.  All in all, it was a lovely day with, amazingly, no cicadas once we got to Washington's estate!"

And I attempted the paint treatment on another frame - that didn't work so well, so I gave up and have been playing computer games the rest of the evening.  <sigh>  Oh, the dangers of a PC!  :)  

I'm playing Age of Empires - the first time I've tried this one, and the first computer game I've played at all in more years than I care to think about.  It's those idle villagers that get me; can't they SEE that that farm is spent and they should go round up some sheep or hunt some deer or something?!?  No self-initiative at all.  Pity.  Maybe I get that in the age of Enlightenment (is that even an age in this game?  No idea.)

But I am terribly pleased with the framing I got done today, especially as I was making a makeshift matting for one of them.  Lessons learned: keep Windex handy and use often.  Also, assume that after it's hung on the wall you will find fingerprints or schmutz on the *wrong* side of the glass.

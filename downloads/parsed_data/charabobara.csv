It was funnn.
I jumped alot. 
Hahaha.
And got a migraine. Whoops.
It sucked.
I felt like my head was going to explodee. 
But yeh.
It was fun.
I danced with ally.
And Kyra.
And Jill.
And Milley.
And Milley was a baby cuz he didn't want to wear a tie.
That loser.
But i love him.
Hahaha.
And i knew words to songsss.
=D
Hahahha.
I forget what else happened.
Hahaha.
And i'm gettin an ipod today.
Don't kill me.
I know, i'm a hypocrite.
At least you didn't have to tell me.
But ya know..
I'm listening to alot of music lately.
Which is better than what i used to do:
Sit around, watch tv, eat, do nothing, talk online.
Believe me, i still do that stuff.
But not as much.
I listen to the music, sing to it, baton twirl to it, and do ballet to it.
Don't laugh.
I do.
Hahaha.
Specially since track is over.
I wanna keep in shape.
Yehhhh.
Don't laugh.
Hahahaha.
I feel like posting lyricssss. Hahaha.

Ok, this is something that Weird Al did. I'll post the REAL lyrics after.

Peter Parker was pitiful
Couldn't have been any shyer
Mary Jane still wouldn't notice him
Even if his hair was on fire

But then one day he went to that science lab
That mutated spider came down
Oh, and now Peter crawls over everyone's walls
And he's swingin' all over town

La li la, li de da
La la, li le la da dum

Sling us a web, you're the Spider-Man
Sling us a web tonight
'Cause we're all in the mood for a hero now
And there's evil doers to fight

Now Harry the rich kid's a friend of his
Who horns in on Mary Jane
But to his great surprise it seems she prefers guys
Who can kiss upside down in the rain

""With great power comes great responsibility""
That's the catch phrase of old Uncle Ben
If you missed it, don't worry, they'll say the line
Again and again and again

Oh, la la la, di de da
La la, di di da da dom

Now Norman's a billionare scientist
Who never had time for his son
But then something went screw and before you knew he
Was trying to kill everyone

And he's ridin' around on that glider thing
And he's throwin' that weird pumpkin bomb
Yes, he's wearin' that dumb Power Rangers mask
But he's scarier without it on

Sling us a web, you're the Spider-Man
Sling us a web tonight
'Cause you're brave and you're strong and so limber now
But where'd you come up with those tights?

It's a pretty sad day at the funeral
Norman Osborn has bitten the dust
And I heard Harry's said he wants Spider-Man dead
Aw, but his buddy Pete he can trust

Oh, and M.J. is all hot for Peter now
Aw, but Peter, he just shuts her down
Mary Jane, don't you cry, you can give it a try
Again when the sequal comes 'round

Oh, la la la, di de da
La la, di di da da dum

Sling us a web, you're the Spider-Man
Sling us a web tonight
'Cause we all sure could use us a hero now
And we think that you'll do all right




REAL LYRICSSSSS


It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sitting next to me
Makin' love to his tonic and gin

He says, ""Son, can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes""

La la la, de de da
La la, de de da da da

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright

Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be

He says, ""Bill, I believe this is killing me.""
As the smile ran away from his face
""Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place""

Oh, la la la, de de da
La la, de de da da da

Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davy who's still in the navy
And probably will be for life

And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while

And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, ""Man, what are you doin' here?""

Oh, la la la, de de da
La la, de de da da da

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright"

"event","So this morning was horrible.
I went out to get a dress for the dinner dance,
And there was this one dress, with sparkles..
EVERY FUKING WHERE.
It got all over me, so i had to go home to take a shower.
That's how bad it was.
Ugh...
I cried in the shower and for like, a half hour after and before.
And i had to hold back tears in the mall.
Well, then i slept and went back out,
And got a dress i am in loveeeee withhhh.
No, i'm not saying what it looks like or anything.
I only told one person, and will keep it that way.
The one person i tell everything to when i tell no one else.
The one person i told what my dress looked like last time for the Snowball.
Laura.
So none of you will know.
Bwahahahahaha.
K. Done with the evil laughing.
So yeh..

Oh yes.
I must bring up another topic on here.
Girl's shorts.
Why is it, that when girls hit teenage-hood,
The shorts are short shorts?
It is so hard to find shorts that actually dont show half our ass's.
Seriously, It's pathetic. If that is what someone needs to get attention around here...
CAN YOU SAY ATTENTION WHORE??
I can.
In one language.
English.
Well, in any matter, I think it's bullshit and stupid.
I dont feel like running around like a slut kthanks.

Well, another matter i wish to post would be school.
I thought near the end of the year, teachers were easier on you.
Less homework, Less work, Less projects.
Even that they MIGHT talk to each other, so everything isnt due the same exact week!
But no, they talk. Sure they talk.
Just not about this shit.
I swear...
One day..
Well, whatever.
My eyes are bloodshot. 
I'm gonna go.

BEHIND ALL THIS LAUGHTER

I laugh in the halls.
I smile up on stage.
I hug all of my friends.
I act a young age.
I laugh when I am tickled.
I talk in every class.
I look ever-so-happy,
Even if picked last.
But behind all of this,
All the hair, clothes, and eyes,
Is a person in despair,
A person in disguise.
I cry when I am hurt,
When I get cut I bleed.
I'm not always Miss Happy.
To my anger, I do cede.
My laughter is a cover,
My smiles are never real.
It's not like you ever care,
So I'll continue to conceal."

It was fun.
That's it.
Hahaha.
Well, yesterday was really fun.
In the morning i had soccer.
Now, i play on a high school team.
The other team, basically beat me up.
I got double teamed once, going for the goal,
And one of the girls stepped on my ankle.
The skin broke around my ankle.
Another time a girl kicked my shin.
I was wearing shin guards.
But there is still a bruise.
I got knocked down two times really hard.
One of those times, i landed on my elbow.
I couldnt bend it after that.
I almost had to come out of the game 3 times.

Well, later that night, 
Milley picked me up and we went back to his house.
We exchanged gifts and stuff.
I got a ring.
I gave him a poem and candy.
And a card.
Hahahaha.
He always forgets.
Its funnee.
Well, then we went mini-golfing.
I lost.
But i got a hole-in-one once!!!! 
=D
Yay Charaaaaaa!!!
Hahaha.
And, yes Laura, he helped me.
Hahaha.
Cuz i was so bad at golfing.
Then his parents picked us up and and dropped me off at home.
Hahaha.
It was really fun.

Well, at first my parents thought the ring was real.
And i said: Mom, the ring came in a box with a dragonfly on it. You think its real?
It was funny.
But they like it.
And they love him.
Hahaha.
K, well that's it.
I might be goin to a circus today.
But i dont wanna.

Well, nothing else to talk bout.

I don't mean some of it sometimes.
No, I shouldn't say that.
Whenever I say nice stuff like, luv ya, etc.. I mean it.
But i dont mean the mean things i say.
The bitchy, unwanted comments.
Especially to certain people who mean the world to me.
I hate how sometimes i just..forget how much they mean to me.
No.
I dont forget, I just..I dont know what happens to me.
But i hate it.
I hate myself sometimes.
But doesn't everyone feels sorta that way sometimes?
Maybe not.
Maybe i'm just a screwed up child.
I dont know..

All i know is that i seem to not be like other girls.
To me, it seems like every other girls knows flirting when they see it.
It seems like all other girls catch onto things that i dont see.
It seems like every other girl wears make-up.
Maybe i'm just oblivious.
No.
It can't be just that.
There has to be more.
I dont know what happened to me.
Maybe something happened when i was young, to make me immune to girlish things,
Like what i said above.
It just feels like i'll never be like other girls.
Like i'll always be one step behind.
That i'll never notice things that others notice.
Sometimes i question why i'm like this.
Was it because i grew up with brother, thinking girls and boys acted the same?
I have no idea.
I just wished, sometimes, that I was more girlish. 
Or caught onto things that other girls do.
((sigh))
I guess I'll never know...
I just wish i did..."

Heyyy! Good time for lyrics.


ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE

There are secrets on a leaf, 
In the water, in the air, 
Hidden planets, tiny worlds,
All invisible! 
Not a person seems to know. 
Not a person seems to care. 
There is no one who believes a thing I say...

Well, I'm fairly certain 
At one time or other, 
Great thinkers all feel this way! 

I'm alone in the universe. 
So alone in the universe. 
I've found magic but they don't see it
They all call me a lunatic. 
Ok, call me a lunatic. 
If I stand on my own, so be it. 

'Cause I have wings. 
Yes, I can fly 
Around the moon 
And far beyond the sky 
And one day soon 
I know there you'll be 
One small voice in the universe 
One true friend in the universe 
Who believes in me... 

I'm alone in the universe. 
So alone in the universe. 
My own planets and stars 
Are glowing.
Alone in the universe 
No one notices anything. 
Not one person is listening. 
They don't have any way of knowing. 
Nobody knows that
I have wings
(I have wings.)
Yes, I can fly
(I can fly)
Around the moon
And far
Beyond the sky (Beyond the sky)

Well someday soon 
You will hear my plea 
One small voice in the universe 
One true friend in the universe
Please believe in me ..."

Hiding eggs..getting chocolates...getting Easter baskets..etc..
I miss when i was younger..
I got Easter baskets from my aunt..
I got chocolates...
My parents and brother hid eggs for me..
((Sigh))
Well, i guess that's in the past..
So moving on...

I'm bored.
No one really likes me..
It kinda sucks..
Yesterday I hung out with Milley..
Friday I did nothing.
And now its Sunday..
Easter.
I know Easter means more than dying, and hiding eggs and stuff..
But since i'm Jewish, i have no idea.
I dont look IN to that kind of stuff.
I stick to Jewish things,
Like Passover..
Ugh.
Shoot me.
I guess its not that bad.
But if you walk into a grocery store,
It kills.
If you make a list of all the things you cant eat during Passover,
That kills too.
A lot of people have to give up things for lent.
However, only ONE thing. Even though its longer, its only ONE thing.
I have to give up any made of bread.
Shmeh.

Yeh,
So whatever..
I guess i'll go.
No one likes me anyway..
K.
Bye.


And I had just hoped, that...((sigh))..Maybe I should stop hoping.."

So, my stomach hurts.
Alot.
Shmeh.
I guess I'll go through my day again...


1st period- Lang.- We took a test that was as easy as ABC's. Me and Jill had forgotten it was a half day, and the bell rang. Oops. We were late. Well, Mrs. B.   wrote her a pass. I got one from Mr. Chirip.

2nd period- Health- We didn't do anything good. Just stuff on different body systems. Shmeh.

3rd period- Lang.- We read? I thought my stomach would burst. It hurt.

4th period- Science- Went to science exhibit thingy in auditorium lobby. I saw lots of friends. Yay. It would have been better if my stomach wasnt about to die. And let me say, we weren't GOING to go to the science thing. But then bitches in my class persuaded Smith to. I hate them. Whoever helped persuade Smith, I hate. I thought I'd pass out. Thanks alot ass-holes.

5th period- S.S.- I forget. But it was boring. 

6th period- Lunch- I started to make an Inside Joke book. I only put people in it, that I have more than 2 inside jokes with. This includes: Laura, Milley, Ally, Jackie, and A-ray. I have a LOT for Laura. Hahahah. And I have a good amount for others. I'm making those into a book. Yay.

7th period- French- B-I-N-G-O!

8th period- Math- Slopes?

9th period- Band- Yay for half days! We played two of my favorite songs. Then left for report cards. And, btw, DO NOT ASK WHAT I GOT ON MY REPORT CARD. I WILL SAY THAT I GOT LETTERS REGARDLESS OF WHAT I GOT.

Home- I went home. 


K. 
That's it.
Bye.
I love you."

Sounds like fun. 
K.

1st period- Language arts- Our groups got changed into rows. Fun? Not really. I will miss my group terribly...Our fun yet perverted conversations, Dylan making me laugh so hard I would cry...

2nd period- Gym- We did curl ups today. I got 49, but i would have gotten more. However, Carmen told me to stop going so fast, and i started laughing and had to stop. Oh well. It's not like i made presidental in pull ups or anything anyway. Haha.

3rd period- Language arts- Did nothing. Quite boring.

4th period- Science- I talked the whole time to Milley and Eddie. Hahaha. I would have talked to 'Boy', but he was absent. Hahaha. 

5th period- Social studies- Oh my god. ((Yes, girlish. Oh well. Deal.)) So, my group was talking about this kid that liked me, and I guess we were talking a bit loud, becuz Mr. V. looked up from his work and stared us down. It took a while to notice he was, and when i did i said: ...Hi... and he said: Hello. And went back down to his work. It was funny. Yet bad. Becuz the boy we were talking about, was in our Social Studies, but not there today. Hahaha.

6th period- Lunch- Umm...I forget what happened. Hahaha. We talked. Evan read my boobs. Hahahaha. Funny stuff.

7th period- French- Learned about classroom objects. Mergim is still being an ass-hole. I'll kick him in the balls on the last day of school. 

8th period- Math- We learned about slopes again. Oh well, I like math. DONT SHOOT ME!

9th period- Band- We didnt get through all of out songs, but I liked the order. Our songs arent bad or like, unfun to play. Its fun to play all of them, except Livin' La Vida Loca. The only thing that sucks, is that Mr. Palmucci is there. Otherwise, it aint so bad.

Afterschool- Track- We had an easy day. 15 minute jog with Carolynn and Milley. I fell. Cuz of Milley. He leaned on my back and made me fall. It was funny though. And me and Carolynn sprinted away from him once. Hahahaha. I mean...awwwww. Then we did starting blocks. It was fun. I raced Carolynn and Milley a bunch of times. ((I beat Milley)) Hahahaha. And we held the blocks down for each other. I seem to have good starts. 


Yeh..
That's it.
Then i came home and I'm leaving after dinner to get a book I've been craving for for a week or two. 
Yayyy!
Please don't shoot me. 
I like to read...
If it's a book i like.
K. 
I'll be going now.
Tee Tee Eff En! Ta Ta For Now!

Hey! That reminds me! I'm getting piano music for that song. What's it called?? Oh yeh! 
""Return to Pooh Corner""
Yayyy.
This would be a good time for lyrics.

Christopher Robin and I walked along
Under branches lit up by the moon
Posing our questions to Owl and Eeyore
As our days disappeared all too soon
But I've wandered much further today than I should
And I can't seem to find my way back to the Wood

So help me if you can
I've got to get back
To the House at Pooh Corner by one
You'd be surprised
There's so much to be done
Count all the bees in the hive
Chase all the clouds from the sky
Back to the days of Christopher Robin and Pooh

Winnie the Pooh doesn't know what to do
Got a honey jar stuck on his nose
He came to me asking for help and advice
And from here no one knows where he goes
So I sent him to ask of the Owl if he's there
How to loosen a jar from the nose of a bear

It's hard to explain how a few precious things
Seem to follow throughout all our lives
After all's said and done I was watching my son
Sleeping there with my bear by his side
So I tucked him in, I kissed him and as I was going
I swear that the old bear whispered 
""Boy welcome home""

Believe me if you can
I've finally come back
To the House at Pooh Corner by one
What do you know
There's so much to be done
Count all the bees in the hive
Chase all the clouds from the sky
Back to the days of Christopher Robin
Back to the ways of Christopher Robin
Back to the days of Pooh"

"event","Ok,
So i was kinda happy,
Till my computer decided to shut down
Unexpectedly.
That made me really mad.
Before it shut down, 
I wrote a poem.
After it shut down, 
I wrote another.
The first one,
Kind of happy.
The second,
Quite sad.

Before i post both poems,
I suppose i'll tell you about my day.
It was boring.
Ok. 
Now the poems.
My first one, which should be relatively happier than the second one:

THEY CAN SAY WHAT THEY WANT

People may call me stupid
Maybe even dumb
Maybe even crazy
Or maybe just a bum.
Maybe they call me ignorant
Or an insensitive creep
Some may call me ugly
While others call me cheap.
Maybe they say I'm a loser
While others call me mean
Maybe they don't care
Maybe they want to scream.
They might whisper behind my back
And say i shouldnt have said yes
But there's something i must say
Something that i must confess.
I've liked you since i met you
It wasn't long ago
I wanted to ask you out
But i was afraid you would say no.
But after you asked me out
There was no way I'd say no
I was so excited
But didn't let it show.
People can say I'm heartless
But i know that isn't true
The reason that i know this
Is because I love you.


That was my first poem.
A bit happy.
Idk.
Ok.
Now my second poem.
I dont have a name for it.
So it can be called: Nameless.

NAMELESS

My heart is beating fast
My nose is getting runny
My eyes are starting to water
Nothing seems sunny.
It feels like a cloud
Is following me overhead
Watching my every move
Wanting me to be dead.
I look straight in a mirror
And what do i see?
Tears streaming down my face
Full of sorrow and no glee.
Life seems to be a nightmare sometimes
Everyone hates me
Don't even try to lie
Just say that you agree.
What if i just left?
Would you even care?
Would you go out looking
In the nighttime air?
I can't pretend you care
Because I know you probably don't
Just, please don't say you'll be there for me,
If you really won't.


I'm not going through depression,
I just kind of sad and frusterated right now.
I'm ok.
Really.
I'm not really going to run away,
Or hurt myself,
Or anything.
I'm just blahish."

"event","Yeh, so,
I'm sitting in the new room at my house,
While Laura is on the couch sleeping,
At 8:26 in the morning.
OMG,
We went to bed at like, 10 last night.
Now you are prolly thinking: 
""Omg! 10????? That's it????""
But let me tell you,
Last night was no ordinary night...

It all started with a trip to Dunkin' Donuts.
Took us, bout a half hour to get there and back.
Laura played with flower pedals, and my light up wand.
We then came back home for dinner; pizza.
After we went upstairs to my room so I could take the
W.O.M.B.A.T.S. 
After that we looked through some old things of mine.
Scrapbooks, pictures, etc...
Oh, how much of losers we were in 5th grade.
After that, it was pj's and Kids Choice Awards.
So, we get downstairs and settled into the new room.
When we realize, we need to do something different this year;
As we do every year.
So we decide on:
We both guess who is going to win the blimp.
Whoever gets it right, gets to dare
the other person to do something.
(Laura is finally up from sleeping)
But if we BOTH get it wrong, we have to get ice cream, 
And finish it before the commercial is over.
Of course, we ended up eating 
3 chocolate pops each. 

It was murder.
Ice cream is the enemy now.
We could barely move.
So, then we finally went to sleep at 10.
Just about after the KCA.
Well, let me just say, 
WE ARE NOT DOING THAT NEXT YEAR.

K.
Gotta go dye eggs.
Or eat breakfast.
Whichever.
Laterrrr.

Weeeeeee. 5 months."

Most people are like:
Ew. You like to run? Loser.
Well:
1. Yes, i am a loser.
2. Yes, i like to run.
3. I dont have a 3rd point.

So, moving on,
We did penn relay tryouts.
I sucked, as usual.
Then we did a 15 minute run,
Followed by working with the starting blocks.
Fun stuff.
You get to stick your butt up in the air.
Isn't that fun?
Don't answer.
That was rhetorical.
Well, I get to leave some of my classes early thanks to Jilly.
I feel bad for her though.
Poor girl.
I love her.
I've known her since kindergarten.
Horrible grade.
Worst teacher.
Anyway, getting off topic,

Gym is boring.
I don't like it.
But I get to go to health in two weeks.
Yay?
No. 
Boo.
I miss track & field unit.

I don't like that.
Oh well.

So, 
Cougar Palooza is this Friday.
I hafta wear a skort.
And for those of you, you have no idea what a skort is ((aka Milley))
It's a skirt with shorts attached to it.
It should be fun.
Cept for the whole, skort thing.

Well, I also can't wait for Saturday.
Kids choice awards.
Yes, don't you wish you had a tradition of this?
Yes.
I bet you do.
You dont have to say it
I know, I know.
Never fear.
Well, its also 5 months with Milley.
And i WONT be kissing a picture of a celebrity this time!!!
Hahaha.

And a ton of homework.

I am sorry in advanced, but it NEEDS to be done taping by Sunday.
So, if you guys can, please don't make plans for Sunday.

Im really stressed out now.
Talent show is really close
and i suck at my song.
Ugh
Then of course my
science teacher goes and gives us
this summary sheet do in 3 days.
And of course, those days i have 
Talent Show till 5:30.
Cept the night of it
But I'll BE THERE.
Ugh. 
Life never seems to want to be
on my side.
I cried when i got home from
Talent Show today.
I can't handle this sometimes.
Ugh.
I'm going mad."

First of all, I don't even know 
How to flirt, or what flirting is.
I just saw one that said Flirty 
as my mood and decided to put it up there.
My real mood is:
Tired, drained, excited, scared, intimidated, and happy.
Well, alot hasn't happened 
in that past however many days 
i haven't written in this thing.
GEPA'S are over.
YES.
And Talent Show is next week-
EW-. I suck so much at singing.
But let me tell you, it was ALLLL
Laura that made me try out for talent show,
But then I followed it through
cuz of my parents.
I dont know how I really sing; good or bad.
So you'll have to be brutally honest
after you see me sing.
So, yeh
STEP is ok i s'ppose.
My daddy came in to help.
The Jeckot's treat me nicer now
that my daddy came.
Personally, i get embarrassed of my 
daddy sometimes. 
But my friends seem to like him.
So i guess that's good.
Umm...
I think that's it.
Oh yeh! I finally got
Harry Potter 4!
And the soundtrack to it!
Yayness.
I think that's it.
Oh yeh! 
We also got ping-pong
and air hockey!
And we'll have pool by next week??
Yeh. Well, soon anyway.
K. I think that's it now.
No! Wait! It's not the end.
I'M SEEING WICKED NEXT SATURDAY!!!!!!!!!
Just thought i would mention that.
Kbye."

So, today was life.
But before I get started let me just say:
-Yay!! Dan is gonna be here next year!
-Boo Alyssa wonttt
-Poor Milley. He couldnt play in his all-star game.
K. So, anyway,
Today at the bridal show, people thought that either I was getting married
or Laura was getting married. Funny stuff.
Although it was quite boring till the fashion show.
Then I had to get changed in a car-with untinted windows.
HARD.
So, as I'm changing, the car is at a red light,
And this guys just kinda decides to stand there, me being half-naked
under a trench coat. (Laura helping hold it up)
I eventually got changed
And it was fine.
My all-star game was goodness.
We won.
I can play defense.
YAY.
Then I spent an hour after with Milley
And his brothers.
CASEY IS SO CUTEEEEEEEEE.
Yeh, K.
Well, his brothers were spying on us.
It was funny.
K. g2g
Zoey 101 spring break up is on.
Yes, I am a loser.
And yes, I still love nickelodeon.
Get over it."

I feel lonely alot.
I don't know anymore.
Or care.
Cuz its not like people
Care about me.
So whatever.
This week is supposed 
To be good becuase of
No STEP or Talent Show.
I guess it's sorta working.
I don't know.
Life never seems to be on 
My side.
I wish people didn't hate me.
Sometimes I just want to 
Cry during lunch or something.
But I can't. Too many people
Around, or telling me not to.
Ugh. Whatever. It's not like you
care.
So I'll just stop talking.."

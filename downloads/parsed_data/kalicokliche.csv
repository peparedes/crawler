"event","I'm a very low maintenance friend. I don't demand a lot from the people I'm friends with. I am perfectly content knowing I wont see anyone from Drew&nbsp; this summer. And that doesn't mean I don't value their friendships, its just how I am. I know that even if I didn't talk to Seth or Ginny for the entire summer and the entire time they're in London, the day they came to Drew, things would be fine between us as if nothing happened. Hell, Ginny and I have already said that we're both fine if we don't see each other this summer. It'll still be cool. 

But who cares? No big deal. You want more. I plan on going back to Drew after not seeing any signs of Drewids, and only talking rarely, and think everything will be fine. For me, if someone weren't to talk to me an entire summer or visit me for an entire summer, and then I saw them on August 22nd, I'd be fine with it and there would be no ill feelings from me towards them. i guess I just expect people to feel the same, but I learned that some people don't. 

But it goes the same way from people from home, I'm fine not seeing you when I'm at school. Don't take that personally, its nothing against you. I don't undervalue our friendship, for me, i'm fine with not seeing you. For me it'll be fine, and I'd like for you guys to be fine with that, knowing full well that Its nothing personal, and that my feelings for you guys aren't lessened at all. 

I understand people have different definitions of friendships, but I respect yours, so respect mine. If your definition of being friends with someone is being a part of their life all the time even when you're not around, I respect that, but for me, I'm fine with not."

"event","So there were two older guys across from me on a train...and I asked them the same question I ask everyone whenever conversation goes stale (a trick I stole from Lisa Apple.) 

""What was the best thing that happened to you today?""

The first man responded by telling me about his business and how he sealed the deal, broke the bank, delegated down, and all sorts of cliched business phrases. 

The other told me how he saw his grandaughter for the first time in a long time and about the life in her eyes and how there was nowhere else he'd rather be and how much she's grown and how he looks just like her mother, and how he'd give his life to make hers better and how they'll be together forever. 

I started to think about the path I've yet to take:
Be proud of brokering a deal or spending time with a child with the world in her eyes.

So what IS the measure of success? A happy family or a booming business?

I'm on this crossroads of the stereotypical twentysomething existentialism of ""why?"" I'm only 20 and want this fifth-life crisis to happen already where I just disappear to a deserted island somewhere and just live like Tom Hanks in Cast-Away.

I'm looking forward to retirement and I haven't even started working! 

I wanna care more about the answer to 26 across then the answer to Multiple Choice #26. 
I wanna worry about who fed the cat rather than who sent a fax. 
I wanna think about the weather instead of thinking about my taxes.

"event","But the others would beat her anyway and Adupa cried, not because of the pain in her body, but because of the pain she felt at that great, vast empty wasteland where love should have been.
    That was what killed her. She demanded that her parents love her. She kept going back to their compound, almost next to Atum's and the closest to my own. Finally they took her in, and Adupa was happy and stopped crying. She stopped crying forever, because her parents went away and closed up the house's opening tight behind them, so tight that weak little Adupa could never have moved it if she had tried. But I doubt that she even thought of trying. She waited for them to come back with the food they promised her. When they came back she was still waiting for them. It was ten days later and her body was already almost too far gone to bury. In an Ik village who would notice the smell? And if she had cried, who would have noticed that? Her parents took what was left of her and threw it out--as one does the garbage--a good distance away. They even pulled some stones over it to stop the vultures and hyenas from scattering bits and pieces of their daughter in Atum's field; that would have been offensive for they were good neighbors and shared the same compound."

"event","Imagine this:

You're on an airplane, sleeping with your head against the window, your heart set on being home this time three hours from now. All of a sudden, something goes very wrong. The plane stops moving across the air and instead starts falling through it. The lights are flickering and the movie is skipping. The plane dips hundreds of feet in seconds, and the yellow cups fall from the ceiling. They're a brighter shade of yellow than you remember, because unlike the demonstration, these cups have never been handled before. ""Flight attendants take your seats now"", you hear, the pilot's voice trembling over a cacophony of alert tones. You get that smell in the bridge of your nose like you've just been hit with a football. That's what the fear smells like. The plane is going down.

Four more drastic drops in under a minute. People are crying. For all the folklore about how your life flashes before your eyes, you're remarkably fixed on one vision - your parents. They're sleeping at this very moment, in a bedroom so quiet they can hear the clock in the kitchen. And you can see them, clear as can be. You wish you could see a playground or a first kiss, but all you can see is your parents sleeping. Huh. Well, that's that.

Several long minutes go by. Then, all at once, the lights come back on and the plane somehow rights itself. Some people cheer, but most people cry harder. The plane lands about an hour later, and as soon as you feel that touch down - hell, even when you were within 50 feet of the ground and could still technically survive a fall - you realize that however you brokered the deal between you and God worked; you've just been granted life in overtime.

Here's the question: what do you change? Whom do you call that you haven't spoken to in years? Whom do you realize has been toxic to your heart and drop with surprising ease? What trips do you cancel, and what trips do you book? What can't you be bothered with anymore? What's the new you like?


Think about that, and then ask one more question. Why not just change it all right now?"

"event","I haven't felt good in a while. I've felt content. I'm working hard, but so what? I'm working too hard. I've got loads of homework that won't get done. And because its stuff from the past that i haven't kept up on, it'll pile up and the load will look quite impossible to knock down. So I don't do it. Acorn stuff, I can do that, for some reason thats the one thing I can do. RA stuff, its a lot more work than you'd think. I guess I just have to learn time management. Force myself to do things. Open up my planner to a random day and say ""I'm gonna live to see this day..."" and know that all the homework and shit isn't as important as that. 

I saw a commercial the other day about retirement or something. And I realized, here I am worrying about this petty shit...but I haven't even reached any point of my future yet. That all this stuff I'm avoiding doing is to build that future. That kind of motivated me...'get off your ass cuz your life hasn't even started yet...this is where you build your life so one day YOU can retire."" 

Other times, (like after watching the movie Cast Away) I really wish I was on some deserted island alone somewhere. Less stress from these outside forces, everything you have to worry about is life or death, so you HAVE to do it. Not like..a journalism article that you haven't started yet...or a German test you hvaen't begun studying for that are BOTH for tomorrow. No, you just gotta get a coconut, kill a fish, knock out your tooth with an ice-skate. Maybe if I viewed everything as life or death I'd do it? Probably not."

"event","I'm feeling good. Even though next week begins finals week. People are becoming friends again back home. Which should make for more fun when I return on December 20th. Even though i don't have a room! HA! There's gonna be an Acorn (school newspaper) on monday which should be a hollerific good time. I miss everyone from back home a lot. I can't wait to hang out with Ashley, Erin, Kristyn, Matt, Alex, Cheryl, Ericka, Kori, Krista. EVERYONE. Now its all about time management because I'm also getting a job again at StopandgoKillYourself. For monetary support while I'm out in N.J. Being out here is weird. I only think of myself being on LI. Maybe it's because I spent 18 years out there? Then again, maybe not. I'm gonna have my own dorm room next year b/c my roommate is moving out. This sucks because he's a really cool dude. But seeing as this joint is gonna cost $47,000+ next year. (I probably just scared off Janine Harris.) I'm applying to be a Resident Assistant next year and hopefully I get it. I'm presently assistant news editor of the news-paper and have this weekly radio show with my partner in the assistant news editor role, Seth. We're mini-moguls. My floor is absolutely amazing. We all get along ridiculously well. More news as it happens. Especially since this is the first update in 6 months. yea..."

"event","So, I've in fact been chock FULL of rage lately. it's been fantastic motivation though. so kudos to me. and i thank <span style=""text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"">u</span>. 

<br>
College: <span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 102, 0);"">Drew</span>. 
<br>
Thats all done. Going there. Excited? you bet. Close enough to home and
the city that i can make visits to my wonderful friends and...well the
city. duh. I don't know EXACTLY what I'm majoring in yet. But i'm
really feeling doing some form of Pre-Med. or Biochemistry and then
going to med-school after that? It's a lot of work. But i'll give up
having fun to set my mind to something and <span style=""color: rgb(204, 0, 0);"">make something of myself</span>. Cuz I found a whole new sense of ""<span style=""font-style: italic;"">holyshitmotherfuckerthisisntplaytimeanymorenowyougottadosomethingwithyourlife</span>.""
So i think i'm gonna settle down and work my ass off. That's a huge
change from high school kerry who was all
""rahschoolwork?whodoesthat?lameassesthatswho!""&nbsp; and who knows.
maybe i'll have a new image at college of the kid who works hard and
gets good grades. rather than the <span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"">Antinerdlazybastardimmaturefailure</span> that i was labled as in <span style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"">Longwood</span>.
and that'll be a huge change for me. b/c i grew comfortable being hated
and looked down upon. will this all actually happen? who knows! but at
least theres a hope. ya know? a hope for a better future where i'm
looked up to as a hard worker. so here's to hope!<br>
<br>
I got a summer assignment reading from drew: The Kite Runner by Khaled
Hosseini. dunno what its about. but its the shape and kind of book i
like. (don't judge a book by its cover) but i like how its kinda small,
new, and soft-cover. so i can't wait to just dig into this. i'm gonna
read it a good 100 times. because we have to write a paper on it. and
be prepared to discuss it during Orientation Week (September 1st-5th)
and i don't want to appear like a total dumbass. speaking of september
1st. i'm gonna be one of the last people home. everyone else is leaving
like...august 2X something. so i'll be the last one to leave. <br>
<br>
i might be seeing ani difranco with phillan and jessica from work.
which should be a thrilling time :) b/c they are two cool chicks. i
might feel awkward but oh well. we'll see. <br>
<br>
Other big news? yea, i've got a lot. looking back on some fantastic
entries such as: March 22nd, 2005. and November 6th, 2005 and May 30th,
2004, and April 14th, 2005. i realized who the one person who has the
greatest impact on my emotions and my life....still does! it's great.
Love is a GREAT and powerful thing, lemme tell ya. <span style=""text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"">u</span>
probably shouldn't take it for granted. cuz one day it won't be there.
who the hell am i kidding? it will always be there. just like it has
for the past 4 years. regardless of how many ""never agains"" or ""this
sucks"" or ""i hate yous"" or ""i love yous"" or ""fuck yous"" ""you hurt mes""
are said. i'll still be there. always. sorry for being such a crappy
friend/lover/definerofhighschool/confidant/shoulder.
maybethisbreakisforthebest. but probably not.&nbsp; i just think it's
healthiest. iwishyouloveandhappinessfortherestofyourlife. <br>"

"event","Fuck you livejournal. first and foremost. you mother fucker. for deleting my fucking long tirade on ""Hivegate '04"".

In a nutshell. I had the hives. Allergic reaction to the psuedophedrine in Nyquil i took Monday and Tuesday Night to cure my flu. took benadryl all throughout wednesday through friday night. when i was informed that my allergy-fighting benadryls also contained ""la agua de diablo"" (psudophedrine) i was still coughing through this. so much so that my shoulders were sore. on wednesday night. the hives were so bad that my eyes were swollen shut. Concert went well. Christmas eve and christmas went well. I was bedridden from wednesday night till saturday. for the most part. save school on thursday. 

SOrry about the short entry. write a fucking letter to this shithole called livejournal that doens't save your entries. hopefully i'll update more often to keep you posted so i won't need to write those wicked long entries. 

Comment as you will."

"event","Did chores: Painted 10 Chairs for the upcoming wedding party of my mother and steve's. The paint was WICKED thick eh, and woudln't come off my hands until i scraped it off with a damn brillo pad, and took off my third layer of skin. Watered our new sod lawn in the back (again, party) Did 1000 loads of dishes and laundry. Cleaned the pool up and chlorinated it. 
Noon: danielle calls and is like ""yo come over"" and I'm all ""yo, i gotta clean up first."" So I get that done and call up and she comes and picks me up. We play some 500 Rummy at her place of residence, which has become a staple of the kerry+danielle hang out at the natale house. I win...of course...its the only thing I ever win at over there lol. Then we go to her game, and Casey and Steph (the twins) are there, and they both say ""HI KERRY!!"" and i was excited, because i felt special! They rule? yeaaa. Danielle's team won 7-2, and it was a really good game. Them guys rock hard. Went back to her house, ate some dindin, drank some wawa, watched the movie ""Atlantis"" the disney movie. We didn't get to see it all, but it seemed cool. Then I came home, and here I am. Sharing my day with people.

"event","Ummm...I'll keep this recent
-Thursday: went to beach with danielle and her family (even her cousing and aunt from texas). GREAT TIME! Beautiful weather, strong waves, fun times. And, I swallowed a bee! It was buzzing around my head, and I came up to gasp for a breath of air, and gulp, down it went! A lovely coughing fit ensued and i think I'm okay, just hope it went in my stomache and not my lungs :-/. And some random woman came over to our lil group and was like ""can you help me i think I'm drowning?"" and i didn't know if she was serious or not...so i was like ""o.O"" and Danielle even asked ""are you serious?"" and she started bringing her back in, and as i tried swimming over, i kept getting ripped out by the WICKED strong rip tide. but she got in, and danielle is a hero? yeeaaa 8-). Went back to her place of residence, and played 500 rummy, and i lost I think? Idk, but its always fun there. 
-Friday- Splish Splash with ryan, becca and mike. Two best friends and another friend? You bet it fucking rocked. We went on the new ride Dragon's Den. WOrd to the wise, it blows. Its so short, and the bowl part is so slow and dull. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME! We saw a matt monastero clone, and me and ryan couldn't help but laugh our asses off. On the group rides (Mammoth River and Hollywood Stunt blah blah w/e) Me and ryan and mike fought and tried throwing each other off and seeing who would be last one standing. On one double-tube ride, i actually threw ryan off and he was dragging. It was the funniest.thing.ive.ever.seen. It was good times abound. Although it started raining and got kinda dull, and me and ryan couldn't even walk anymore. After that, i was like ""yo i got cash left...lets go to best buy"" so i got the maroon 5 CD, and it rocks. 
-Saturday- Went out to Cedar Point with my sister to visit my dad, his g/f, my ""uncle"" and my ""Cousins"" We went down to the beach and went swimming, and i tied my shirt in a knot and made it into a net and caught some lil fish and shrimp for the two lil kiddies. Also played a lil baseball and showed off,of course that was fun. We got bored and left early. And then as I'm home, we have sod in our backyard, and are preparing for the wedding and wedding party for my mama and steve. Fun stuff.
I'm really lonely, and i hate it. BLECH!
Total sleep count before Friday Night: about 12 hours
Sleep Count Friday Night: 12+ Hours

Yea, that felt fucking great. And here i am now, listening to maroon5, watching ESPN, maybe going to ericka's tomorrow, and missing Ms. Natale like MAD! I think I'm going to her game Monday though, so that'll be fun. 

Oh ya, about her softball team...These twins who were on the team, Stephanie and Casey, got my screenname from Danielle, and now? they talk to me all the time. They are two awesome people right there. Just as I start becoming friends with them, they are off the team! :( how sad. its funny because I know things that happen to them before danielle does lol. They are some of the funnest people to talk to. 

IDK what I'm doing for the rest of the week, but wednesday i know what i'm doing, I'll prolly go to ryan's a few times too. I also gotta do those summer assignments. 

I tried emailing mrs. skadle about the summer assignment, but i keep getting email failures for w/e reason, and its REALLY irritating. GR! If anyone gets in touch with her in any way, lemme know. 

Oh ya, I also saw I, Robot with Ryan, Russel and Matt Emig and matt's g/f Katie. It was an AWESOME movie! Everyone should see it! Cuz i said so...

I'm best friends with cheryl again? who could've seen that one happening. Not I. It's cool, I still hate her though...prolly always will, and thats the way it goes. 
(just kidding cher)

Me and Becca are inseperable again, DOI, and we have the bracelets to prove it! We went bowling and to the mall with a group of people and we got 'em from some chick-shop. Yaa...let the jokes flow lol. 

Got the Kanye West album, yea, its rap, but its awesome. 

Jamie Cullum-my new musical obsession, Jazz Pop from Britain. I recommend it to everyone, but you are not allowed to fall in love with it like i have. ITS MINE! NOT YOURS! I hate when people find out about good music that was my lil secret and then take it as their own. Troubles me greatly. 

AP Grades: pretty good on two,shitty on chem. Could've seen that happening lol. Oh well, deal with it. 

I like walking train tracks to your door, could be for miles, but its worth it just to see your smiles. 

Umm...i'll try and update more often for all y'all (Aw Sarah-danielle's cousin-kept saying ""ya'll"" cuz she was from texas, how adorable) She was a cool cat too."

"event","Whoa haven't had a computer to write on for weeks so here's an update live from Errrcka's house! I'll holla!

Umm...Honor society induction was fun: Kristyn Muller, Daniella <3, and Lauren Weidner. We went to Friendly's afterwards and there was PMS abound...but thats all good. I'm becoming friends with Baby McSherry, so that rocks. ""Peer Pals"" I'm sure. 

Next Day was the concert, twas good. All that is...cept...Inferno, sounded like it was straight from hell, THAT bad, Tubas are dumb, they don't know what upbeats are, and if one of them did, they coudve informed everyone else

Friday Night: Plans to go the movies w/ danielle and kristyn, we got there, and every show of every movie was practically sold out, so we waited outside and i saw a bunch of the kick-ass student government/council people (i.e. carly, kaitlin, bruno, cafferey? caitilyn mcsweeney, meagan muller) Kaitlin and carly waved, i felt special. So instead of movies, we went to sports plus to go ice-skating. I rule at ice-skating so i showed off, allegedly i amazed kristyn and danielle because: ""we thought you were going to be average but you are REALLY athletic, its scary"" +5 self-esteem, confidence and ego. We were skating for two hours, and on one lap, me and danielle were singing ""hands down"" and at the end we were both like ""i love that song..."" JINX it was freaky, and then i asked her a certain question and she gave a certain answer. And. I'm. Happy. :-D! Then we went to friendly's and i got that brownie caramel thing, and it rocked my socks. But kristyn's mom was looking at my ring and was like ""OMG KKK! ur a klan member? u hate black people?"" and there was a table of black people behind us -_-, not fun at all....not a fan of hers...i just put my head in my hands and was like ""no...go away..."" 
Saturday: went to dad's went online for a sec, did work, got money, got Chocolate Fudge flavored Jones soda (awesome) and came home, called danielle, read harry potter: The goblet of fire, went to sleep
Sunday (today): woke up, mowed the lawn, yard work, came to ericka's BBQ over here, here i am, we're listening to RHCP and having a good time, i like food, vote for me for honor society president, I'll holla.

(oh btw, she didn't ""bump into me"" at mcdonald's: me, her, jen r, and diana went together, and btw, she kept asking about YOU and me and us and saying ""how long?"" ""did you guys DO anything?"" ""oh ya, i hate all the flutes, I'm better than everyone in front of me *looks at me*...oh ya...except_____..."" but go ahead, be mad at me, I'm getting used to it i guess. She has a personal grudge against you, and i know what she told you, but it wasn't true, Just letting you know, what was said before you accuse, blame, hate, point fingers.^this was all for one person, and she knows who she is, just to let u know)

I'm extremely happy, thank you all and good night, call me, my computer will be getting fixed soon enough. I'll update then maybe...we'll see"

You long for someone who will

"event","Ya ya ya, finally a Kerry-Klug-Update, i seriously didn't know if i ever wanted to update again, i'd just look at other people's entries...and not give you the updates on my life...

About a month ago-shit got crazy EVERYONE and their dog knows about that shit and what followed...good news travels fast eh? Wasn't fucking fun at all lemme tell you! (which is why i haven't updated since then) Its a rebuilding year for Kerry and his heart, I'll see what i can do there...it is NOT going to be easy.

Hell Week- doesn't begin to describe how it was for meee :) oh it was a splendid lil war...between the incident, the fight w/ rebecca, and the lack of sleep, it was just sexified...Thank god for ericka+kristyn during that week, they dragged me through it, and helped out bunches! thanks much, i love you both!

Fantasy baseball started up again, i seriously have a pretty damn good team. I'm hoping for a good season.

Um..vacation...first like..5 days...i set up my fish tank...got 6 fish...5 died...it REALLY upset me... iknow ""they're just fish man"" but i was REALLY excited about them...cuz they were really pretty angel fish :(! Ya...so the one left is in the old tank...in a lil side breeder tank think...hoping that it will survive @_@!

HWK: did some, did research paper, prolly sucks! oh well deal w/ it robinson, i just have chem left (impossible) and history DBQ to study for...
 
i reached 200 people on my buddy list! i had to delete someone to make room for ms. Liz :) she rocks

I've become closer w/ kristyn and danielle lately, i went over kristyns and went to her brother's T- ball practice, we had a really rockin' time,we played basketball w/ danielle and her adorable lil sister and her brother which was awesome,  we tried doing chemistry, but it was wicked difficult, i got the usual questionaire from her mother...and the constant picking and prying to make sure I'm a ""good kid""

Ericka is gone for 5 days, I'm gonna miss her wickedly!! She called this morning but i felt like death -_-! i felt light headed and like i was gonna throw up, and i was still asleep...

Junior Prom: Right now? more than likely, not going! I'm trying to get plans together with Chris+Chubs to just hang out, go to the movies, bowling w/e, if you guys don't want to, thats cool too! Whatever works daddyos!

People have been asking...how ya been? I'm okay, but idk...REALLY confused and disappointed about everything thats coming up...and how LITTLE i've done...my carefree attitude is gonna catch up to me...and I will regret it...i'm gonna have to work really hard these next upcoming weeks/months and focus on school a lot more...i'm gonna stay after a lot for chem (force me to dammit!) 

The show fucking rocked! It blew me away, and i wish we could do a show every damned weekend! we don't even have to sell tickets, whoever wants to show up, can just show up and we'll rock your fucking socks off! 

Me and ryan have gotten to hang out twice this vacation to play video games, so thats been friggen awesome, we crack each other up like WHOA when we hang out! Its crazy! 

umm Krista Conway rules? ya, I'll go with that :) I just hope she knows I <3 her much too! 

Something really bad happened to two of my friends...we're not exactly close...but it was during hell week that i was reading their journals...and idk..it really upset me...and i just hope they're okay...just everything that was happening to me...and then i read what was happening to TWO of my friends...and i was just...hit REALLY hard...i hope they both know that i'm here for them and i love them both very much (i respect both of them so I'mnot gonna mention names and Im' sorry if i made u more upset, i just want u to know that i care about u guys)"

"event","PIT=okay, i really know my part well...I play clarinet sometimes too...i probably won't for the actual performances...
School=not that bad, i dropped Animal and plant behavior because that class bores me all to hell....so i got put in a study hall with amber and krista which should raise my spirits a little, and give me much desired study time before AP History, for those tests that rock socks...
Friends...god...too much to list...
Becka- We had our falling out that we we're talking about...it wasn't pretty...i thought i was going to lose her as a friend...I'd die...i need rebecca to talk to...we both tell each other EVERYTHING and are just best friends...
Ericka-Rocks
Chris- Really good, i think he trusts me a lil more, i hope he realizes that he can because I'll always be here, Chris is an awesome kid.
Krista-thinks are looking up because we are seeing each other more adn are hanging out more, so thats great! 
Amber- we're getting really close, so thats great and we're become really great friends, i did not see that one coming, contrary to popular opinion, she doesn't eat babies, she doesn't kill people, and she doesnt worship the devil...so just stop that shit...
Chubs- I've been talking to her online more, trying to become better friends with her because i read her journal and wow, she is an awesomely hilarious person and with hope, we'll become good friends
Lisa- shes so trustworthy its unbelievable, i can tell her anything! and i already have lol, we're also becoming great friends and i hope it only gets better! 
Cheryl- What can i say, you know how i feel about u, and how much u mean to me.


Other things won't be mentioned here...its not my business to say...

me and my dad are gonna start making out own guitars, thats gonna rock, i can't wait to make custom guitars: American Choppers style, it sounds like a good idea, but who knows how much it'll carry through...

"event","Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall 
For just to be with you I'd gladly risk it all

For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way... 
Right down to the wire, even through the fire)

I love these lyrics and the lil girl's voice singing them..."

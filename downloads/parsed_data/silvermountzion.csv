Although I will be going back to something I started a long time ago after being inspired by Billy Corgans ""Personal Confessions"" which were short stories from his life which he posted on his website in 2005.

 I will start this out now by going back and reposting the stories that I posted a couple of years ago before giving up, then I will write more as I see fit."

 So Dave and I went to Karens funeral on Friday morning, an event which I have been trying to not even think about. It was pretty tough to walk into that room knowing I hadnt spoken to Mike in years and watch him cry as a preacher preached bullshit about things that dont even matter as his moms dead body sits motionless for all to see...



Last night Leigh Ann picked me up at like 12:40 and we went out to overlook to gawk at how retarded Dow Diamond is. I relate to Leigh Ann pretty well and Im glad that she is my friend. Its pretty easy to speak to her about things because unlike most people I know she actually has human feelings.

"event","So the last couple days brought lots of joy with them. 420 was a blast and today brought the news of another trip to Canada next week. 

 I spoke with Davey today about the remaining 4000 dollars in funds that need to be seriously discussed here before the record can be mastered. Its kind of depressing because I know that we as individuals dont have the money. It can be easily obtained but I think more than anything we wanted to make this record on our own and just have someone distribute it and help us with touring. It looks like buisness talk is in our near future...something that has been worrying all of us for a long time because of the fact that it is either the ultimate step for our band or the complete end. Its when everyone has to sit down at a table and say ""yes I will do this for at least the next 4 years of my life without any doubt in my mind"" and if not all of us can say that, then thats it...."

"event","So as expected the trip to Toronto was amazing. We met up and did some drinking at jonnys right down the street from the opera house and then it was showtime. Do Make dominated as usual and it was nice to chat with those fellas (as well as the beautiful woman who makes love to the violin) once again. We drove straight to Toronto and then did some buzzed driving straight back to the US.

 This trip made me realize how important it is that myself as well as the rest of my band get out of this country as soon as possible. There is alot of talk going around that kind of upsets me...

 When im at work and a girl I havent seen in like 9 months walks up to me and starts talking to me like she is one of my best friends talking about how she heard ""my band was getting signed"" and that we were selling our music to movies etc..... that upsets me. Not that Im not proud of my band or the things we are starting to accomplish...it just upsets me that we told certain people about these events and asked them to keep quiet and they couldnt handle it.

 We have been catching alot of shit lately with people saying we have grown to big for our britches. Fuck that if we couldnt handle what we have taken on then we wouldnt have done it. For all anyone knows...we could already be signed and just not be telling anyone....but the truth is.....We arent ready to make the decision about putting this record out yet. 

 and with sadness i must now admit to myself that it is obvious this record will not see the light of day until early next year. there are many decisions that we all need to make as far as the band and our personal lifes go.
also, all the labels we have talked to say they want at least 6 months of promotion/in store touring before putting the full length out.

 The crowd was totally not who we expected. Midland is no longer our town. Our friends no longer live here thus there is really no reason to come back and play awkward shows to the stuck up kids of this town that dont understand the concept of music.

 Our set went fairly well and we played in our usual very very loud manner. The new one was really shaky at first but by the end i couldnt resist almost having a seizure I was having so much fun playing it. Then there were a couple of extra special songs after that one (which was suppose to be our last).

 Im so content it makes me sick. I dont care about anything anymore. Which in some ways is great but is also very troublesome because Im always either content or completely In pieces. It sucks to roll over in the morning and realize that the one reason you are waking up is also the one reason you wish you would never wake up again.


 We worked on a couple new songs tonight. The main one we are trying to finish right now is called ""Sorry Mr Newton"". We finished two songs last week, ""Looking closely at Plants"" and ""Arms around Horses"".

 We will be debuting most if not all of our new stuff at The deadwait finale show on May 27th.

 We discussed the new disc the other night. The plan was to put it out mid-summer but we arent so sure now. We really enjoy working with Rick and we think it would be in our best interest to record the whole disc with him which is going to take alot more time then we had budgeted to record this disc.

 So in final, The decision was made that we will not be putting out another EP at all anytime soon. Instead our goal is to move to interlochen as planned but continue to come to town and work with Rick on finishing this cd, Which will sometime next year become our full length debut. Which we are shopping around right now because we dont think frenchkiss is the best option.

 I got in my car at like 11:30 and drove to where I used to live on waldo court and parked down at the end of the court and walked around out there most of the night. It was really nostalgic but also upset me in alot of ways because I feel that emotionally I still havent left that place. I ended up getting in my car at about 4:30 AM and just crying for about 15 minutes straight and punching my steering wheel.

Also, I sunk over 100 dollars into the recording of just one song yesterday...this shit is too much for me to handle.


 Also, my bandmates told me we would practicing before I had to work today and that they would call me 1st thing in the morning, so I was like ""alright, sweet."" and the one day i nthe last 3 months that I could have slept pass 9, I woke up and here it is 2:08 in the afternoon and still no word from them, I have called both of them and been told that they arent home and they dont answer their cell phones.

We practiced from like 1:30-4:00 today which was really nice and much needed to prepare for saturday at big bear. I have started to notice that the more I write in this this about my personal feelings and events in my everyday life, those events and feelings become less and less overwhelming every time.

 So its Friday now which obviously means nothing to me, just like every other day. Tippy was sentenced to 14 months rehab yesterday and Im glad. He needs the help and the 14 months rehab is a hell of alot better than the 8 years prison he was facing. Mark agreed to drop all the charges if he stays at rehab the whole 14 months.

 Travis has been scaring me more and more lately. All of these things have really made me hate drugs. Travis is a great guy with alot to offer the world. A kind soul and a warm heart and it hurts me that he is slowly killing himself just to take the edge off of everyday life. DEAL WITH YOUR LIFE DUDE. ITS REAL. HEROIN ISNT REAL.


 Just the thought of heroin makes me sick. The one time I saw it in person I almost threw up, honestly. Its something I could never do to myself and as much as it saddened me I told Travis that if he doesnt start to try or get some kind of help soon that Im going tyo tell Mark he has been comming to work high because a majority of the time I could be held responsible for any major issues that  would arise from his foolishness.

 Im tired and I have to do dough again tomorrow. I would also like to thank mark for waiting to call me until 11:00 tonight to tell me he wants me in at 7.  Thanks."

 I seriously dont know what to do with myself. I have tried so hard to do things that make me a better person and possibly more appealing to her once again but I dont think it is working. I guess the low down dirty truth is that being with me isnt worth any kind of hassle or any kind of fight meaning that Love means nothing I guess. I have told her so many times that I would do whatever it takes to be with her and try to make it work because after all this time I still feel the same connection between us and I still get the same feeling when I look her in the eyes.

 Im suppose to go on a walk with her tomorrow after work and if that actually happens then that will make two good days in a row for me, which virtually never happens.

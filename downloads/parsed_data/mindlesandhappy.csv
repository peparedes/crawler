I don't live well in boxes. I am now attending McLoud Highschool and taking all AP classes plus band. I am really appreciating the break. I'm already in with the drama team and we're heading to regionals this weekend. I've even written several farely good peices since I got home. My dry spell is over! maybe I'll post some. By the way, I am moving my journal to penultimatenoel so friend me if you so choose."

"event","Hello cruel world. We had a three day weekend for Martin Luther King day, but unfortunately now I am back at school. Fortunately though, it is a tuesday and I have table duty and therefore don't have to leave the dorms until 8:30 and I got to sleep for an extra half hour. That was a good think since I was talking to Sam until 11:30 and then I was awake for another hour worrying about what he had said. The conversation pretty much amounted to him wanting to know if I wanted to have his babies. I have no idea how to react to this. I love hime, but..... damn. You just don't start a conversation like that when you're at a bar playing pool and the other person is supposed to be alseep. I think we'll be able to work things out, it just upset me that he was even worrying about this. I feel like if I want to be with him at all I have to tell him what he wants to hear, that I'll be a nice little wife and turn out babies. I used to think that I didn't want kids at all, but I'd be willing to do it for him. Just not now. I don't even want to think about it right now. Ugh. This is probably more than anyone else wanted to know, but I needed to vent and nobody but Jacquelyn reads this anyway. I'm going to go clean the tables and then go to history and try not to think about him for the rest of the day. right. I'm going to get a new retainer today so maybe the pain will distract me."

"event","Guess what? I am writing this entry from the beautiful silver keyboard of my brand new Compaq laptop. Yes, that's right. Curt took me yesterday to get it. I'd been saving up for awhile. I had enough for a cheep one, and then uncle George sent me a check to cover all the birthday and chirstmas presents he hasn't sent me for the last 10 years so I was able to get a better one. I still didn't have enough for all the bells and whistles so Curt pitched and quite a bit. He told mom that she owes him a ribbonwork suit now. I'll probably help her work on it. He's all happy because he finally has money again. Unfortunately he no longer has a girlfriend because Thia is being a pain. I love the girl dearly, but I just have a hard time being nice to someone who screwed over my brother like that. I survived the holidays(barely). Nonne got mad at me because she doesn't think I like her grandchildren. The truth is that I don't like them, but I thought I had been fairly socialable. I mean, they're all drunken preps, and I am neigther. What would we talk about?"

"event","Hello world. Life has been crazy. All the professors are doing premptive preparations for finals. joy. I've had 49 songs stuck in my head all day for some reason. I was singing as I walked up the stairs in my normal obnoxious manner and Julia was like, ""what song is that?"" ""Well... It's the tipi creepin song."" ""yeah. Don't ask."" I am so strange in my own special way. I went to the Charity Ball with Jacque. It was super fun. There was a living statue guy there. I told Phil the Baptist that Jacque was a Lesbian and he freaked out. He asked me today if she was my girlfriend. He was all embarrassed about it. Apparently he hasn't heard any of my ranting about my male counterpart. yep, last time I checked I was defintely not a lesbian. It was really fun freaking Phil out, though. well, it's study time!!! buh bye y'all."

The wonderful hippie vibes in her house always make me happy. My mom is very sad that she won't see me this weekend. In fact, she has arranged to com take me out to dinner on Mon. Poor Mommy. It's a good thing I didn't just start college next year.  I don't think she could have handled it. At least with me at OSSM she can randomly come visit when she gets too depressed."

yay! I always new my inner being belonged on someone's head! Today was fairly good. Feng the overbearing chinese woman told me I was improving. That is a huge compliment from her!!! Tommorow is the evil Lit test, but I guess I will survived. I never dreaded lit until this year. Even so, I am still a lib-arts junkie at heart and love the discussions we have. Well, i'm off to watch episodes of Bill Nye. Sad, but true. He's put out a demented show for teenagers. It's great fun."

Everyone has been forcing me to drive everywhere recently in hopes that I may actaully get around to taking my driving test sometime in the next 2 weeks. We took a load of stuff to Goodwill today and changed over our cell phone plan. I actually have my own cell phone now! goody. I'm going to Monika's house to spend the night later. Do you know how long it's been since I've actually spent the night at one of my friends houses? forever. I haven't really even talked to anybody this summer either. Then only friends I've really seen are my pow wow friends. Big surprise. It is summer after all. Mom, Dad, and I might be going down to TX next Sat. to take a cannon down for the OHS. yay. I might get to go kidnap Noely for a day! He is the worldest cutest baby. I may be a bit biased, but who cares? I've got to marry a redhead so that my kids come out as cute as him. Though, that would ruin the plan of my raising native babies. I'll just have to do an irish guy first and then marry an indian boy. That'll work. and somewhere in there has to be a guy named Robinson, because I really what to go around and introduce myself as Mrs. Robinson."

There's not enough cash for the whole family to go, so they're sending me with the Wests. Cynthia is coming back on Thursday and I'll spend Friday with at her house. Then Saturday we'll meet with her parents and head to Illinios. At the very least it should be interesting. I heard Chad was in a car wreck, but he's not hurt very badly. Of course this came from his mom who's not only out of the loop, but hooked on anti-sphycotics. I should call him. For some reason, in the past 2 weeks I have had talked to all of the people I have dated. Odd."

"event","Yesterday was pretty cool. Dad was out of town for work, and Nonnee was at her grandson's graduation, so it was me and Mom. In the morning we had to take Taz to the vet, because he was weezing up a storm. Then we came home and dropped him off and I changed, because I was covered in dog hair since I had to hold him the whole time. Then we went back to shawnee and I got 2 new cds. System of a Down - Mesmerize and The Smiths - Meat is Murder. Then we bought me some summer clothes since most all of the clothes that fit me at the moment are long sleeve black shirts. After that we went to the post office, and guess what? I GOT ACCEPTED TO OSSM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I GOT ACCEPTED TO OSSM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yeah, I'm happy. I called everyone in the whole world last night, well, everyone whose phone numbers I had. Then I went to bed and about 2 o'clock in the morning I heard drums. Then the phone rang and it was Curt. Southern Thunder had been singing at a pow wow and Gene and Curt and a few others came out and decided to 9. It was great. I got a 49 thrown for me in honor of me making OSSM. I still have to sit down and talk with my parents about everything this entails, but I'm almost positive that I will be moving out in a couple of months. yay!!!! anyways...... I have to go to the graduation party for Nonnee's evil preppy grandson, so I better go shower and such as that. Have a nice life ya'll.  :-)"

"event","hey there. I went to graduation last night. Everyone around me was all teary-eyed and sentimental. I on the other hand became very bitter and cynical. Oddly enough, I tend to have the same reactions at funerals. I guess I just started contemplating my graduation and how I will give my final regards to a bunch of people that I never really cared for. They did one thing where they played ""here's to the night"" by Eve6 and everybody got up and hugged eachother and cried. (Chad sat in the back and made faces at me from across the aisle. Classic.) I was just thinking how I would have absolutely no one to hug. I don't really have any emotional attachments to anyone, for that matter. Which is odd, since I'm a generally outgoing person. There is not really anyone I would miss if I never see them again. There are people I would think about from time to time. I might miss Jacque if she disappeared off the face of the earth. This is also kind of odd, since I've spent maybe a total of 20 days when I've actually seen her. I think more I would want to know what she is up to, because she is interesting. I sound like I'm monitoring a lab experiment. I appologize, Jacque. You're a really great person. Let's see, is there anyone I would miss, if for some unexplicable reason I could never contact them again? It's not like I have any bestest best friends. I think I would miss my Dad. hhmmm... my father, the hippie, and a spunky art student. Are they really the only human contact that is important to me? Surely I'm just being dismal. Either way, at the moment I feel like I am stuck in a bog and all I am doing is stagnating. That can't be good. We did our finals today. Algebra 2 was easy, even though I did zero studying, surprise, suprise. I ditched History cause he let us start the test yesterday, and I had already finished it. Instead I went to the band room and downloaded random Spanish and French music files into Blair's laptop. Drama was one big giant orgy that I decided to refrain from. Last hour was cemistry. I hate Mr. Page. We did all this work studying acids and bases, Bronsten-Lowry theory, everything. I figured it all out, even studied a little. Guess what was on the test? Balancing chemical eqautions. That's right. The same thing we did in 7th grade. There were 40 questions, but most of them were just the same formulas worded differently. After the test we watched pirates of the Carribean. I love Johnny Depp and all, but that is the 3rd class to show that movie in 2 weeks. ugh. I can't wait for Friday when it will all be over. Have a nice life my lovelies."

It's really hard to type, because my nails are all long and pretty. I'm growing them out so that when I go to prom I can file them down to points and have claws. But in the meantime they are very difficult. oh well. Let's see. Between now and the last time I updated I went to Washitaw, did the princess thing at TIHA, made the first cut for OSSM, and my dad had a heart attck. He's OK though. I was really happy about OSSM. I have and interveiw next SAT. which happens to be the morning of prom, which I let myself get talked into going to. Well, it was more of a ""If you don't go with us, we'll hand cuff you, tie you up, and put you in the back of a pickup truck, and make you go."" While I might have enjoyed being handcuffed by Valerie, I just figured it be easier to go willingly. I got this hideous emerald green dress, but it looks good on me. Especially since a made a few Katerifications. It should be interesting. I even talked everyone into going to eat at the Veranda, a local Boho coffee shop/deli. Should be interesting since that Saturday is the poetry slam night. I acidently forgot to tell my friends and their rednek boyfriends that. oops. I did a major house cleaning session today. It's pretty amazing, I can now walk into my room without tripping! Santa Maria, it's a miracle!  This morning I got up and found Mom and Dad watching ""While you were you."" It's this show where they redecorate someone's home while they're on vacation. It was kinda funny becuase anytime they showed a seen of the carpenters Dad would be like, ""They're no splicing that right,"" or ""Wow! that's one of those $800 saws put an order in for with the agency."" (Yes, your oklahoma tax dollars at work. You buy my dad powertools.) I guess that'd be it for now. Have a nice life ya'll:-)"

"event","yeah, today was a supper-sleepy-floating-through-life day. I got a two on my solos Saturday, not really cool, but all things considered it was pretty good. The peice my instructor gave me was like, college level memorization and my accompaniast didn't follow me at all. ugh. anyways..... no use stewing. Everyone says I'm an obsessive overacheiver, especially when it comes to my music. I really don't think I'm that bad. I'm just as useless and untalented as all the other blob-of-a-teenagers out there. I just choose to work on my useless untalentedness. anyways.......... we did another completely useless lab in Chem today. Why does Page delight in wasting our time? I guess I'd rather that than all those stocheiometry labs where we had to do everything perfect and couldn't turn our backs for a second becuase the chemicals would boil over or eat a hole through the counter or something. After that Valerie and I decided to go crazy and do paper chromography. (for those of you who didn't pay attention in freshman science, that's when water travels up a piece of paper with ink on it and as the ink goes up the less dense colors go further and you can see all the colors in the ink blob) We got all creative and made designs. It was cool. Between us we must have done about 30 pieces of paper. yeah, dork with a capital D. I know. but who cares. You'll find out we're even more dorky when I tell you that while we were doing this we had an entire conversation using only quotes from Shakespeare."

My life recently has consisted of applications, applications, and drama competitions. I went to an awesome Rev war reenactment last week with my dad. yay! it was supper fun and I really needed the time away from school. I'm applying to everywhere for next year. OSSM(Oklahoma School of Science and Math), OSSM regional center at Shawnee, and art school in Tulsa, and Classen (an artsy school in OKC). I am hoping on OSSM or classen. I figure the one that accpets me is where I'm supposed to be. It's kind of a big deal becuase the school I end up in will help determine if I end up being a science major or doing some sort of liberal arts thing. Well, I need to go shower and such before solos.

"event","yo. Not all that much has gone on. I went to the bestest gaurd dance ever, it was in honor of Grandpa Joe Rice who is about 98% dead, sadly, and wanted to go to one more dance. It was completely amazing, even for a guard dance. The drum was freaking awesome. There were so many singers they had to bring out three drums! The Foye boys were there. They are so huge! Shawn is like six and a half feet tall, but boy has he gotten sexy. I have decided that the only way that I will raise babies is if I find me an indian boy (preferably one who can sing) and we raise our kids traditionally and go to pow wows and native american church. 
moving on.... this is a good story. Tuesday I text messaged Jen's boyfriend on her cell phone and wrote ""back seat windows up, that's the way we like to fuck. you, me, and Jen."" Obviously I was not being serious. then he text back and said he couldn't wait. so yesterday I wrote him and said, ""If you want me ready you better come prepared because I like it rough."" Well there was some random guy standing in line behind me and he read it over my shoulder!!! Then he told me he'd give me $50 if I showed him how I liked it! Do I look like a whore to you??? I mean, really. not cool.
I just got back from a meeting for OSSM. I really want to go next year. I know it seems like I'm totaly overacheiving, but hey, at least I'll be out of Meeker. If I don't make it there I am so going to Classen next year, so you guys had better make room for me, cause I'll find a way to get in.
that's about it for now. Tommorrow a photographer is coming out from the Shawnee paper. They have a little new magazine called ""She's OK"" and they want to put me in an article about the women of tommorrow. whatever. They also want to publish some of my poems; I have no clue what to give them. I'll figure it out 2 minutes before hand probably.  Laterz :-)"

"event","Yeah, I didn't go to school today, but I had a good reason. Sorta. Yesterday was OK. Jenifer showed up in the morning totally hating everyone and everything, even worse than normal. I should have known she'd be in a stupid mood. The morning was OK, I turned in my prewriting for the essay from hell. It sucked, but I'll fix it later. In band I told Jen I had a headache and she gave me a tylenol. The only problem was that later she told me it was Loratab, which would have been OK except for the fact that Loratab makes me throw up if I even think about looking at food. It was all great for an hour or so. I felt fine. Really fine. But the in Spanish I started geting masive stomach aches during the test. I was OK until I got to Chemistry and regurgitated my peanut butter crackers all over the test. Yuck. The up side to all this is that all the throwing up I did last night convinced my mother that I needed to stay home today. Yay. no school for Kateri. I think it's finnally out of my system. The moral of this story is, don't take any pills from an unstable teenage girl who often atempts to get through the school day on a cocktail of Diet soda, ritaline, loratab, and antidepressants."

I'm officially a princess now, and as a bonus, this is the 49th year of THIA, so I guess that makes me princess of the 49! It was lots of fun. Sam told me that I should sell my eggs once I turn 21......... yeah. I played with my cousin's stepdaughter and taught her how to make towers out of the craemer containers. 
Yesterday I woke up and just totaly didn't care about life so I put on some clean pajamas and drug myself to school. Jordan said he liked my baggy, beat up sweater that didn't fit right. I guess that was a complement.
Today I wore pretty girly clothes and everyone told me that I looked good. Well, I believe Valerie's exact words were ""my, your breasts look very nice today."" I guess Azaelia and Cindy got to come out and play today......
I stole most of the music out of Mr. Blair's computer today. YAY! He has the best stuff. That's about it I guess. I have a speech sontest tommorow that I am soooo not ready for, but I'll make it through. I think I'll have to find some time this weekend for a writing benge, so hopefully I'll have some good stuff for you sometime soon. Laterz. :-)"

"event","Hey there. This was the busiest week. Not really good or bad. Just busy. We passed out ghost grams. If you don't know ghost grams are tootsie pops wrapped in butcher paper with wiggly eyes glued on them. We let people attach noted to them and then we pass them out to their friends for 50 cents. It's a fund raiser for Drama. I got 10. I feel very loved. Of course, I probably sent out just as many if not more. It's a lot of fun. Ben sent me one and didn't sign it on purpose. And he wrote it in a slightly neater and handwriting than normal. It took me way to long to figure out who it was from. My mom also sent me one and I took a long time to figure out it was from her. It was really random and crazy sounding. I didn't think she was cappable of random acts of mindlessness. I went to a bad football game last night. Played hackey sack with some guys from Stroud. They were stoned. It was funny. I stayed up till way past late last night talking to Kyle and now I must get up and go to Jessica's house. I have to be nice to her becuase it's her birthday. It is very hard to be nice to her sometimes. But I can do it. 
I have an 80 in Garver's class again. That sexist asshole. His first problem with me is that I am a woman and I should not excel at anything. His second problem is that I have small breasts and I don't flirt with him. Oh well. Maybe he'll get struck by lightning. Or maybe if our football team keeps losing they'll fire him and he and his wife who is half his age will be forced onto the streets along with the child that they made while he was married to someone else and she was a senoir in his highschool class. I wouldn't want to wish the kid harm so I'll send DHS to pick it up. wow. I really don't like this guy, do I?
Yay! now on to a better subject. It is very likely that I will get to graduate next year! All I have to do is double up my English class and I'm done! I get to skip my junior year! Yes. One less year in this hell hole. I am happy. It won't even be that hard.

I admit it is a little odd, but I'm an odd person so it's OK. He also said I was a ""little Betty Badass."" I don't think anyone has ever called me a badass before, under any circumstances. Last night we were sitting around the table and my mom was reading the paper about aftercare and she was wondering aloud about the part about not getting other people's bodily fluids on your peircing for 2-3 months. Then she started asking why a guy would get a tounge peircing. Aunt Arlene started expaining oral sex to her, my dad was telling her just not to get Kurt to explain it, and Pam was standing in the corner saying to herself, ""I am a preacher's wife.

 Mindlessandhappy:  he may not be sufficient world dominating material   
 earthlyphoenix:  lmao 
 earthlyphoenix:  perhaps...he's awfully nice.. 
 Mindlessandhappy:  see what I mean?   
 earthlyphoenix:  he's a wench in bed though (not that I've bedded him, but he's a good kisser)  
 earthlyphoenix:  and we all know that's critical material

 earthlyphoenix:  twins?

 earthlyphoenix:  W00t! 
 earthlyphoenix:  But who's carrying them?  
 earthlyphoenix:  Or should we carry one of each at the same time? 
 Mindlessandhappy:  yes, that's the best way, and they must be born at the same time so they can't fight about which is older   
 earthlyphoenix:  Okay. 
 earthlyphoenix:  You and me girl. 
 Mindlessandhappy:  which do you want?   
 Mindlessandhappy:  the boy or the girl?

It was kinda funny at lunch though, cause I told everyone I wanted to have a late B-day party. Well, it turns out it'll be really late. We're all so busy that we have to wait like 3 weeks. We looked like middle-aged business women with all of our little calendars out, trying to organize something.

It's like anything you write just spills itself onto the page and arranges itself untils it's perfect. So not fair! All I can manage is pretentios rambling. Oh well. I feel like posting something that probably doesn't need to be posted, and won't be appreciated, but who cares? if you don't like it, then eat me.
(By the way, this is something I wrote on my way home today)

Pulling
Searching
I don't want to need him.
I don't want to want him.
But I do.
I thirst for him
Like a prowling Vampire
I want to drink his essence
And let him sink in
And become a part of me.
I want his hair
To meld into my hands
And his lips 
to sink to my breast
I want him to become a part of me 
and awake my senses.
To make each fiber of my body
Tingle with his joy.
I want him in me forever.

I wish I didn't posses 
Such fervent desires,
But my mind,
My body,
And my soul
Has become a slave 
To these thoughts.
I cannot rest
Until I have united with him
And we meld into one body
and sink into the ground
Becoming forever
A part of each other
And a part of the earth.


I have no clue as to where that came from and I can't believe I actually wrote it. Most of my poems like that have a punch line about getting braces removed or drinking from the water fountain. Yes, I can usually pervert anything, but it's not my fualt. It's because I'm around my dad so much, and he's a dirty old man. Well, I guess if I'm not going to sleep I should at least get and outline for my speech done and start the notes for that monster of a Chemistry report. How on Earth am I supposed to write 5 pages about Na. I guess I could talk about salt and blood pressure and stuff. That's NaCl but it's still got sodium in it. Good bye cruel world."

"event","how yall doin? I just got back from TX, which was awesome fun. I really love going down to texas for pow wows cause there's a lot of cool people to hang with up there. I got to see my cousin and her super cute and very fat baby. I got my vital statistics taken. My friend Sam is trying to be a nurse and he has to get blood pressure and stuff for like 50 people so anyone who walked into the trailor got their blood pressure taken and a flashlight shined in their eyes. It's OK though, because my payment for doing this was to steal his Arizona tea. I love that stuff and I can hardly find it up here. Anyways.... every time I went to the trailor his family was in, I stole some more tea. Then after the pow wow Genny filled it up with some JD for me. There is nothing better in this world than cold Jack daniels, not messed up with coke or watered down with ice, just straight JD. That is my one weakness in this life. It's probably not smart to tell everyone that, but oh well. I did get a lot written on the 7 hour drive back home. Only one is really appropriate though. For some reason most of them came out really dirty. I'll post the nice one and I might do some others later. I am gong to post more poetry because Jesse says that he understands my poetry and not my meaningless babble. here goes

_Jesse James_

A heart big as Dallas
wrapped in an outlaw name.
A healthy Buhda Belly
and a Britanica Brain.
The answers to his problems
he finds within a book.
He shed his native ponytail
to acquire a teacher's look.
He'd rather discuss _Crime and Punishment_
than ever rob a train.
His namesake's alter ego;
That goofy Jesse James."

"event","Well then, I really don't have time to post anything but I will anyway. We went to the library in Chemistry today to get stuff for our report thingys. I have to do 5 pages over Sodium. Joy. hear the sarcasm? I think I'm doing better in that class now. We played with chemicals for the last 2 days. YAY! We took a vocab test in AP English today and Caleb wasted another half hour of our time trying to talk his way out of calling Mrs. Maxwell fat and telling Stevie that she only has friends because she has breasts. I want to slam his head through a door, and that's saying a lot cause I'm normally a very nonviolent porson. I introduced Kelcey to Manu Choa and the virtues of music that's in french. I love my french and spanish music. It's very good to listen while your trying to write because it's all bouncy and happy and you don't end up singing along cause you can't understand half the words. Well, I sing along anyway, but most people don't. Of course I understand a lot of the Spanish stuff but none of it should be said in the presence of the spanish teacher. I learned that the hard way. Now I just need some good j rock cds. The only problem is that my computer is slow and I still don't know how to download music. I'm just not a good computer person. By the way, I think I know what I'll do for celebrity day! I want to be Serephim. That's right, I'm going to dress as a chain smoking slutty angel/conscience chick. She's a celebrity in her own mind at least. Laterz. I still have to get ready for the game and pack my suitcase for this weekend."

"event","Just got back from Georgia last night. It went as well as could be expected. Robert (The sun of the lady who died) took it OK. At least he put on a really good front. He kept saying he wanted a hamster so I took him to the pet store. When we got there he decided he wanted a naked mole rat. They were sooooooo UGLY. Luckily I talked him out of it and we got a gerbil. I want a lizard. I actually want a snake, but mom says no way. I did my left hand and right foot with henna last night. It looks awesome. I wore a kaki skirt and flip flops. The problem with the skirt is that when I sit down it rides up really bad and the slit shows lots of leg. The one thing I don't like about my body is my legs, which is why I rarely wear skirts. Oh well. My feet still looked cool. Like sexy amazon Queen feet. Robert discovered my sketch book while I was over there and he proceeded to make me sketch like 10 yu-gi-oh monsters. It was so weird. He also sent some back for me to sketch later. oh. fun. Hear the sarcasm? No, it's not that bad. What else happened? I got tons of CDs copied. They are awesome classic rock stuff. Jefferson Airplane, Big Bro. and the holding company, ZZ Top, Lynard Synard, Led Zepplin, It's awesome! I've also had ICP stuck in my head all day! ugh. I don't even like them. Stupid clowns."

"event","Well then.......today was very.....eventful. Let's start with last night cause that's kinda where today began. I was going through my closet to pick out my clothes for tomorrow and I came across the fishnet shirt I had bought this summer but hadn't worn yet because I had lost it. Then I decided that today I would randomly goth out as you well know I have a tendency to do every now and then. So I went to bed and about 1 AM I got woken up by the lovely Llano. I ignored him and went back to sleep but about 20 min later he woke me up again. This continued for about an hour until I finally gave in and got up and let him out. Then I just kept waking up every half hour or so and when I was asleep I had this really bizarre dreams. Then at 6:30 this morning somebody calls and mom doesn't pick up the phone. Then they call back and I drag myself out of bed to answer it. It's dad and he's screamin wanting to know where mom is. She's not in the house and I have no clue what's going on. A little bit later she comes home and calls dad and I find out that her best friend, Rhoda, who she's known since second grade just died of lung cancer. Hectic morning. I get to school and listen to this emo CD Mr. Blair gave me to calm me down. I also brought the t-shirts I made for my crew. They say ""I love drummer boys."" on the front and on the back they say, ""I need a man who knows how to handle his sticks!:"" It's great. Anyways.... last night I didn't have time to braid my hair so it was straight this morning and since I had and extra 30 min to get ready I put on make up and stuff. Everyone thought I looked really cute. It's kinda funny. Put on fishnets, black eyes hadow, and chains and everyone says you're really pretty. It felt kinda good though. Bet none of you thought I could look good. Well I can when I actually try, which doesn't happen often.........anyways......now mom is calling everybody and we're trying to figure out what's going on. I think I am going to be on a plane to Georgia tomorrow morning to go with her to the funeral. Who knows? I don't really want to go, but she needs somebody with her, (we all know how emotional my mom gets) and dad really doesn't want to go. I guess it can't be too bad. It'll just be for 2 or 3 days. I guess I'm gonna go see if there's any updates. See you laterz."

_When Cookies Could Buy Happiness_

Snacktime was a guarantee,
Recess was a daily adventure,
And naptimes were a loathed tradition
Instead of a sought-after commodity.

Shut up was a curse word,
Homemade brownies were gourmet,
2 games of tag and some make-believe
Was thought to be a busy day.

Reading well meant one was a genius,
Forgiveness was dished out in handfuls,
Clothes, weight, race, and money didn't matter,
because everyone loved you if you shared your cookies."

I figured out how to put a picture in the background, but I couldn't find a new one that I really liked. I made an attempt to find a new picture though. I wanted clouds so I went to photobucket.com and typed clouds in search. I logged onto some random persons photoalbum, it wasn't until I was done that I realized I could have run across something I didn't want to see. What I ended up with was a bunch of pictures of this gothic boy and his friends. One of them looked a lot like Dell. It was freaky. I have to go finish my dad's birthday cake by taking it out of the oven and putting it on a plate. Have a nice life, all."

"event","The other day, the grandmother of one of my mother's students was found across the street from St. Mary's with her hands bound by barb wire. She had been brutally beaten to death during the day. They have still not arrested anyone to my knowledge, but officer Leabo says they think they know who it was and they are trying to find him. The crime was thought to be drug related. This is Meeker, meth runs rampant. It's the only thing white trash inbreds can find to do with their pathetic lives. As result of them not being able to control themselves, this woman no can no longer take care of herself or anyone else. The only crime she committed was being alive. The murder was the first homicide in meeker in 100 years. It threw the town into such chaos that the schools were locked down and we werent allowed to go off-campus for lunch or leave the rooms during class. It was crazy. Some people took notice. Some people were scared stiff. Some found it amusing. Some didn't care at all. Regardless, it will be forgotten, until the trial and sentencing of whoever did it, then it will be forgotten again, and only remembered when the Meeker Chamber of Congress wants something to talk about other than carl hubble, the baseball player from meeker who's name you only remember if you live in Meeker on ""Carl Hubble Memorial Boulevard."" People live, and regardless of how they choose to live, people die. Some people's lives are worse than other's due to their decisions and the decisions of those around them. Pretty much it's a fucking useless cycle that justs keeps going. This poor lady will not be remembered fondly by her peers as kind and loving, though she may well have been. She will not be thought of for anything that she accomplished in this life, but for the fantastic way she left. She will forever be a blemish on Meeker's realistate records and a temporary distraction for the underworked police department."

They glance at each other across the field.
He smiles. She looks at me and speaks of love.
I was in love once. A small blue songbird,
I loved the wind and flew upon it's soft
gentle whisper, soothing like satin sheets.

It wrapped itself around my small body
until the winds sweet touch smothered my wings,
And I had to land just to keep my breath.
Now I sit upon the ground and just watch.
I watch the wind blow through her auburn hair.

I know I like it more watching my wind.
I smile. She looks at me and speaks of love."

"event","I was listening to my new Manu Choa CD and in Spanish class I had one of my favorite songs stuck in my head. I knew part of it said ""I love you my heart."" but I wasn't sure about the other main line, so I asked Miss Rutherford. I was just like, ""What does 'Me Gustas Tu' mean?"" And then she cracked up laughing and told me never to say that to some one. It turns out ""Me Gustas"" when used in context with an abject means that you like that object, like ""Me gustas el gato."" is ""I like the cat."" but when used in context with a person it means (and I quote miss rutherford) ""that you want them in a sexual way."" So pretty much, for the past week when I have been singing that song at the top of my lungs I have been telling everyone that I want their bodies. I think this is absolutely great. I can make sexual passes at people and they will remain none the wiser. Ain't I a stinker?

"event","Hey there. I had the most bizarre dream last night. I was at a historic reenactment and David, the long-haired hippie from Quartz Moutain, was there with his girl friend. It was so weird. She got all mad at me because David and I were reciting peotry to each other and she didn't know any. Then we were at a historic dance, but instead of doing a paddle dance or a waltz, we did the tango, and I was dancing with all the little kids so I was attempting to do the tango while walking on my knees. It was really awkward. Funny, weird, strange, and awkward. Now I am listening to Manu Choa. Lionel, one of my Dad and I's friends from France, was here on Friday, he comes to the US every so often to do research on Native Americans. I was like, ""I have a song and it's in French. Could you tell me what it's about?"" I started playing Bongo Bong and he was like, ""I've got his newest CD in my car."" I was so happy! It turns out it's by this guy named Manu Choa and he is freakin awesome! I listened to it all day to day. Lionel wouldn't tell me want it meant though. He said it wasn't cool. The only words that I know the meanings to are corazon, Locho, poonta, cabrito, bon bon, and marijuana. Don't worry, they're not all in the same song. That would be a weird song. I was going around singing in Spanish and French at the top of my lungs. It was great. I have decided that I'm going to start a comic book someday. The Evil Bad Guy's name will be El Cabrito and his henchman will be called Gato Triste. I think I will name the hero Baca Gama. Mexican bad guys and a japanese hero. This could be interesting. Baca Gama will be a ninja chick. A lesbian ninja chick, and her girlfriend's name is Rubio Cervesa! El Cabrito will be a cuban drug lord with super drugs that turn him into an equivalent of Mr. Hyde. Gato Triste is a brilliant Scientist who cannot escape the control of his master. But what shall I call it? hmmm... it's gotta be something off the wall and in some foriegn language. So far we've just got Japanese and Spanish so it should be French or Itallian or something, but more Japanese or Spanish wouldn't hurt. Well, I have to go make T-shirts for my crew."

"event","so, good world, how are you today? Not much is goin on. I went out to buy a suit for drama tournaments yesterday. I officially look terrible in a suit. I think I hit every store in a 100 mile radius. I'm home alone now, glory be to god. I do believe I have been all over the musical map today. I started out this morning with some hyms, because since dad is gone I went with mom to church because she likes to go sometimes, then as soon as she went to Guthrie I watched Warped Weekend on Fuse and got my fill of punk anrchist music, I then copied and listened to a CD containing all the rap music I have in my computer (which isn't much), then I listened to a little orchestra music from Quartz Mountain (Holtz's _The Panets_), after that I stumbled across some pop music that was popular when I was in 5th grade, and now I have moved into a little blues with a mix of Jonny Lang and Stevie Rae Vaughan. I believe the only thing left is some country and a little loud screamy metal rock. I'm sure I'll cover the loud rock soon, but I'm not sure about the country. Maybe some Willie Nelson would be aproppriate. I have bad news that I found out yesterday. Ginny's baby daddy gets out of jail next week. I don't know what else to call him, actually I could call him a horny asshole who doesn't know the meaning of anything but selfishness and is crazy as a bed bug and belongs in an isolated cave in cambodia where he can no longer harm society and live out his days fucking himself away from human society, but that wouldn't be very nice now would it. By the way, Ginny is my cousin and her super awesome baby is Eli Noel. That's right, he's got my middle name and I'm gonna teach this baby to be as crazy-cool as me! anyways... back on subject, Eli's daddy is getting out of jail and I'm really afriad he's goin mess with ginny's head and she'll get back together with him, the abusive ass. At least Aunt Dottie said there's no way he's gonna move back in with them. I don't know why he'd even want anything to do with Eli. He's already got 5 other kids he don't pay attention to. Ginny's all screwed up in the head though, and she thinks she's ""In Love."" I cough those words up and spit them out because they are bile in my throat and they taint my taste buds and leave my stomache feeling as if the acid of these words has permanently worn it away until it can no longer properly digest anything. OOOOOOOhhhh...... good sentence if I do say so myself. I need to run away and go on a writing benje. That is the only thing that will make me feel better, well..... that and a bunch of peanut butter chocolate chip cookies fresh out of the oven."

"event","hey there! First off I would like to say: JACQUELYN'S BACK!  Ok, miniature joygasm over. Today was better than yesterday. Yesterday was a black eyeshadow day, majorly. Today wasn't that great either, but it wasn't because I was just in some majorly dark and brooding mood, it was because everyone was being an IDIOT! band went very badly, I bombed my monolouge in Drama, Max ran up behind me and jumped on my back and it still hurts, and to top it all off I got my braces tightened. I did have an interesting conversation with Mr. Page (AP Chem teacher) about how all you needed to know to say in a foreign language is how to find a place to sleep and how to order more beer. We then proceeded to see how many languages in which we could order beer, it was great! Mr. Page is super. An old geeser, but still super. I did do something cool today, I posted this super poem on the cork-board in my orthodontist's office. If you were at OSAI you've heard it 20 times, but hey, it never gets old. If you weren't, this is a poem that Katie and I colaborated on for one of our assisgnments in poetry class.

She Swallowed

Hard                                                                  
Because he told her to.
And she always did what he told her.                     
""Good little girl,"" he crooned                                  
As he patted the top of her head.                           
A shudder of anticipation swept through her.
Her lips quivered with anticipation.                               
He gently coaxed her mouth open                      
As she lay on her back
And watched the lights dance above her.      
She closed her eyes and waited for him to be satisfied
Knowing her pleasure would follow the pain.
Hours later he withdrew and allowed her to stand,
Placing a loving kiss on her forhead
He left quietly,
Knowing she needed this time to herself.
She stepped tentatively in front of the mirror
And examined herself for signs of the past strenuous hours.
She tried a small grin,
Then beamed,
As she reveled in the absence of her braces.

"event","Hello world! I had a very kinkyly weird yet characteristically Kateri moment today. We were coming back from big daddy's and we were having a conversation about women's underwear. I think it started because we were talking about Shrek 2 and the scene in which pinochio is wearing a pink thong, but anyways..... I was like, ""I'm wearing women's underwear!!!! At least I'm pretty sure I am."" So I checked and I discovered that I had on this pair of white bikini style panties with little pink hearts all over them. I was like, ""I've never seen this underwear before in my life! Who's undies do I have on?!!"" Then I realized that it was a pair my cousin had given me for my b-day and I had just thrown them in my dresser and I guess I put them on. It was kinda wierd. Especially when Max said I was wearing his and I was like, ""That is so not possible."" It would be very odd if Max wore hearted-printed panties. It's odd enough that I do. It's an awfully girly thing to do. Bad for my image. Not that I have one, but still. I may be cute, preppy, and popular one day. When that day comes, I think I'll shoot myself. Have a nice day. :-)"

"event","I got my antology from Quartz Mountain a few days ago! yay. I also got a CD and a few DVDs. There was a DVD of the poetry reading and one of the Orchestra performance in which Dr. Momaday gave his reading. There is a shot of the Bass section which just makes me laugh. Alex with his spiked hair, Daniel with his white boy 'fro and of course Dell with his corn rows. I was so proud of all those braids. I did it in about an hour and 15 min. That's less time than it took me to do Crystal's braids for snowman. I also got a copy of the Shawnee Paper with me and the other OSAI students from the shawnee area on the front page. It was really cool. Of course the peots gave the best quotes and interviews. The film guy sounded like an overly pompous ass as film students will. The 2 acting students gave interviews that sounded almost exactly alike. It was pretty funny. I miss my OSAI people. tear. 
I just went through all the stuff people gave me last weekend. It took some effort to figure out who half of it came from, but I did it. Tonight I go see ZZ Tops! Yay for hippie rock!

Here's a poem. enjoy.

""How are you today?"" or 
""the Worst question to ask a bipolar person.""

How am I?
Well fine of course.
I'm feeling rather good right now.
Wait a minute.
Why do you ask?
You're checking up on me, 
Aren't you?
Why do people automatically think
I can't take care of myself.
It's like I'm some kind of
Public Science project
That everyone has to check on.
Well I DON'T NEED
YOU'RE HELP DAMMIT!
Oh, Oh,
Why did I blow up like that?
I'm so sorry.
It's just that I get carried away.
I get caught up in the moment. 
That's why people don't like me.
I'm such a failure.
I can't do anything right.
I never could.
What's that?
How are you doing
Is a rhetorical question?!
Well why didn't you say so?!
That's the problem with the world
PEOPLE Don't Say What they MEAN!
Why did you ask a question
If you didn't want an answer?
You were starting a conversation?
You want to know
If I want some fry bread?
That sounds wonderful!
Thanks for asking!
And by the way,
I'm feeling great.
How are you?"

"event","Last night I was woken up by a large black presence standing over me. It had been storming really hard and Llano climbed into my bed. It would have been OK except for the fact that he wieghs 140 pounds and takes up more of the bed than I do. Later mom told me that she went to lay on the couch next to him like she normally does during a storm, but instead he took her place in the bed next to my father. For such a big dog you wouldn't think he'd be such a scardey cat. that dufus puppy. It is amazing what you find on TV. Not only did I make my sesame St. discovery but I saw an amish girl going at it on prime time. Granted, it was a little editted, but this is getting rediculus. I do think that would make a good porn flick though. They've probably already done it, but since I make my own as opposed to watching it......... Yeah right. Kateri in a porn flick. That would be pretty damn hilarious. No one would buy it. They'd pay people to NOT show it. That's a thought. I need to shut up now before this conversation gets any worse. I'm not sure if that's possible, but if it is I would find a way."

"event","I love the last 2 or 3 days before school starts. Dad's at work and Mom's at school. I absolutely love being at home alone. Especially since I haven't had nearly enough alone time in the last month or two. We go shopping today. I need paper and stuff for class, and if I'm lucky a new pair of thigh highs so I can wear my new skirt from the goodwill store.  I was watching sesame street this morning as I flipped through channels. I made an amazing revelation. Bert and Ernie are television's first inter-racial homosexual couple. How great is that? Yeah, I find subliminal messages in everything."

"event","just got done with my mass friends delete thing. if your still able to see my friends only posts, your fine. 

just a note to everyone who wants to be added....YOU HAVE TO ADD ME BACK. you can't just leave a comment saying that you want to be added and then not add me back when i add you. it just doesn't work like that. 

so please keep that in mind when you say you want to be added. 

Thanks

for everyone on my friends list, YOU HAVE TO ADD ME BACK!! (if ya'll added me first and i added you back you have nothing to worry about) this is for the people who asked to be added and when i did didn't add me back. so seriously, add me back when i add you.

**I am hereby finished with all pieces of art that I owe to people. Let me know when you want to claim them.**

_Plans_

I am going to make a gigantic, Renaissance-inspired painting, starting at the end of next week. I do, however, need models, either nude or clothed [preferably nude, it makes things much simpler]. If you're willing to model for me or know someone who is, let me know, I'd appreciate it.

I am starting to write a lengthy poem in an attempt to create a tangible, powerful testament to my linguistic abilities. I'll probably put it here when I am finished, but don't hold your breath: it'll likely take me a month or more to complete.

I am going to stop relying on others so much for inspiration/entertainment/fulfillment in general. [As Thoreau said, 'The man who goes alone can start today; but he who travels with another must wait until that other is ready.'] Let's just say I'm impatient, skeptical, and for the time being, quite untrusting. [I'll soon see what happens.]

Well, time for me to get working -- I have many sketches to do, and a lot of 6x9's to make for a class tomorrow. [I realize that I am being quite different from my usual self; however, I do not yet know whether this is boon or bane. I'll dwell on that later. Look forward to it 8-P]"

"event","I've been thinking more and more that there may be a certain sensibility to suicide. There are a couple people that I live for; but all except one would forgive me, I think. It'd probably be a great weight off of everyone's shoulders. I can imagine their sighs of relief [""I'm glad that's over with,"" I hear them thinking]. Most people don't have any occasion to miss me, not even most people I've met [which narrows it down a lot], or even most people I've had multiple conversations with [which narrows it down to a couple dozen at most]. I have no purpose or place. I am frustrated. If there is a God, then he's a sadistic, scatological fuck [for putting me in this world of shit]. I don't want to deal with it anymore. [I'm not going to commit suicide [not soon anyway] and I know it. But it sure seems like a convenient solution.]

I'm sick of my radical, volatile mood swings [I'm thinking of an anti-depressant advertisement. ""You shouldn't have to feel this way,"" the commercial goes. They're right]. My demands are [beneath] modest and still nobody will fulfill them. Am I so monstrous? How long had I asked 'What's wrong with them?' before I found it more correct to ask 'What's wrong with me?' 

I see no point in living if I'll never get what I want. [I want someone I admire to love me. I can find joy in life with just that.] It won't happen. I'm chronically disinterested, forced into shallow, purposeless activity. 'Try going out and doing something,' people tell me, because they think a vague answer solves my problem. 'What would I do?' I reply bitterly. They never really answer that. Arguing with me is futile; anyone who's done it can tell you why. My opponents never win, perhaps because I am an abject, hopeless loser. Don't you think? If I asked you to tell me the truth about myself [about all of myself that you know of], would you do it? If you said yes, I don't believe you. If you said yes, then prove it."

"event","I can't stand men [boys] my age. You know what they talk about in the sole presence of other men? Sex, booze, parties, drugs, and sex. Such an illustrious, noble gender we are! How sublime our faculties of reason, how transcendent our civilized minds! [I have never been more sarcastic. This is a goddamn milestone]. I think I know a little better now why I'm afraid of sex: I recoil from this corrupt degeneracy with an intense, incredulous horror [I am not a lusting animal; so they look upon me as though I am diseased]. Funny how the world works [I did not want to know that hand-jobs cost one hundred twenty and blow-jobs one hundred sixty]. I want to castrate the next man who talks blithely of renting human flesh, thinking that he is somehow epicurean in his tastes.

"event","www.spymac.com offers a 1-gigabyte email account, with assorted other features such as upload space for a blog and gallery space for pictures. Of course, their servers are under tremendous load right now, so I wouldn't advise using an account just yet -- but I think it's a wise decision to head on over and snap one up.

You'll need a valid email address to get an account; so just make a crappy hotmail one and get the confirmation sent there. It'll take a few days, but be patient: it's worth it (or it will be, anyway).

And don't, under any circumstances, get google's GMail when it comes out. Invasive penetration of one's email messages isn't what I'd call decent service; signing away one's privacy is nothing short of madness.

before he brushes his teeth or scratches his copper beard;

He'll look down and wonder what to say,
believing the whole thing to be a ruse.
It will stun him instantly, he'll stare hard at the floor;
he won't say anything for a long minute,
and eventually a question will fall from him, like a stone kicked off a cliff.

I'll sigh.

"event","Turns out that the one time I was absent in Art History was the time that we had to take extended notes on arches, cathedrals, supporting structures, etc., and NOBODY EVER TOLD ME, even when I asked my teacher if there were any important notes during my absence. So it turns out that roughly 1/4 of the mid-term was on, you guessed it, precisely the aforementioned subjects. So I was able to answer...maybe 1/4 of the questions, as they were all fill-in (if it was multiple choice, I might've had a chance; but of course, fate had to conspire against me). The material also isn't in the required text for the class, so I couldn't have studied it anyway, even if I knew it was going to be on the test... 

Anyway, what it boils down to is that I'm probably going to end up with a C, because I pretty much aced the rest of the test...but as you can imagine, I'm royally pissed off. Fuck."

This is a narrative experiment. Let me know what you think. 

you might think [while wandering through slightly obscured sex and red neon lights and girls dancing in windows,faces bored but bodies undulating; porn sticking to your boots walking by the wet oil-slick corner of harmon&lake [that i call virgin street] making a small splash breaking the reflections of the aforementioned & warding off the people trying to give or sell you things you don't need and don't want (except from maybe someone in your wallet) as you pass by the homeless and drunk and passed-out in tableau as they form a twisted blocked-out scene in this act of your evening, never 

hearing a sound except for laughter and steam, smoke rising in plumes from noses and mouths (and in random jets from the people smoking joints and cigarettes) lips moving in mysterious human ways that don't mean anything to you,only there's a part of you that sees it as they do] 

that you know what they're saying, talking about the times they've had or making plans for the future or trying to find people to love them if only for the night and halfway through next morning, 

and then know that you're poles apart;they're marooned on their hangups over men being islands or bickering nation-states that we first got from john donne and ended up physically receiving,regurgitated,from high school teachers or coffeehouse misanthropes that you might read about in magazines [who write for magazines] and who make crappy art and claim that the subject of their painting is the paint itself,screaming to convince everyone that it's some kind of spiritual experience 

as though any of them in their ridiculous wailing paroxysms know anything about faith except in dollars and half-persuasive nonsense"

The sky looked like a war between grey gods, the clouds titanically swirling and shifting, while the moon silently watched. 

There was something inexpressible about it that gave me an old feeling of majesty (I have never found the words for this. My triumphs (internal or otherwise) always render speech unnecessary). It was a symbol that pointed towards a state of being, and was only so for me: it reminded me of knowledge buried, but not forgotten [I am as great as I have ever been, perhaps never greater]. I lacked nothing. I was alone and didn't care. I laughed at my pains [which are somehow gone, or so muted that I cannot feel them as I sit here now]. I finally believe and trust in myself, without reservation or pause. I am fearless. 

I walked home, thinking [I'll save that for some other time]. 

Just rejoice with me."

""That's...just wrong,"" my mother spoke, gesturing at the television, on which could be seen a homosexual couple getting married. 

""You're wrong,"" I had said quickly, peremptorily. ""Religious sects have the right to bar gays from marrying with their blessings, but nobody has the right to prevent civil marriage between two men or two women. People like you,"" I spat in disgust, ""attempt to relegate homosexuals to the status of second-class citizens. I can hardly believe you think that's right. You sicken me."" 

She turned it off. ""I'm tired. I'm going to bed, and I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't stay on the computer very much longer,"" she said, obviously trying to avoid an argument and my ire. 

""You're a bigot,"" I declared, with one thought in my head.

Laughter is a drug for me (and the glow is lovely), but I can't (I really can; I just don't want to) stand the comedown, especially not right now. [Actually, when I laugh I invariably experience pain now, but it's worth it. [This is a recent development. I don't know how it happened.] My body is composed of ill-fitting parts, and I have various chronic pains...If youth feels like this, I don't want to know what the nadir of my existence will be later in life.] I thought I could always count on laughter to numb everything but my mirth or joy or humor. I was wrong. I'm wrong too often. 

I've done precisely nothing that I can be proud of these past twelve days, and I haven't cared about a god-damned thing. It's worse than it sounds (I'm worse than I sound). I'm talking with someone who says I should stop being so cruel in my self-assessments. I don't know whether or not she's right; I only know that I won't. I have a number of reasons, but I can't determine which among them are only excuses... I wish I could quit doubting myself, and I wish I could stop thinking of myself as both less and more than a man, even though that's precisely what I am (see what I mean?). I operate on invisible percentages of correctness, of which my intuition is the sole arbiter; and as I consider this cognition I feel as though it is a completely separate entity. I and my actions are relentlessly judged by a self which is not entirely me (the way I've written this sentence just feels right. I could have written it correctly, but I chose not to. Let's just say it's symbolic). This is my second sight. This is my Nietzschean monster."

I unfocus my eyes when I'm feeling pathetic inside; when I see everything in astigmatic haloes, I'm less sensitive [even to touch. It's a psychosomatic response]. I think back to when I was seven, when I didn't even know what anxiety was, let alone what it felt like...I imagine the child from then as being a blur of yellow and red that stretches past my right eye; running, laughing, and screaming with the exact playful seriousness of recess games. 'God, I miss your self-righteousness', I hear my voice in my head (using The Lord as an expression and not as an addressee). There's a tender fibrousness in my stomach that tells me I'm sorry for myself again, because I thought I'd never be this way...but even so, I'm lucky. Someone rescued me [from my detestable shit] tonight. I'd like to have thanked her with more words than I had the opportunity to say. I hope it's true, that age-old phrase: there's always next time..."

People I don't know praised my art today, and I realized something: I'm too tired to care about that anymore. Art. I'm just going through the motions. I can draw or paint what is put in front of me (I'm a visual parrot). It really doesn't matter. I only enjoy making art for specific people, or for purposes I agree with. My art, like my life, tends to just happen; there is no passion or enthusiasm (in either). I marvel at the fact that I can stand this insipid life (and then I realize why. I sleep twelve hours a day, and stay awake for twelve hours a day. I have so little to do, it kills me). 

I feel exhausted and directionless. But I'll get up tomorrow (today) and put on a smile (it will look fake. Even my genuine smiles look fake). 

To those of you who know me (or rather, those of you who think well of me): I want to ask you for a favor. Ask me to make something just for you."

In too many ways I'm your average, lonely, middle-aged man. At least once upon a (every day since the beginning of) time I have had nothing to do and didn't care. I take weekend drives now to nowhere, and I can't wait to leave wherever I end up, probably because I don't like the company (me and myself. I left over creative differences). Long weekends break my heart. I have so much freedom; I can move about to anywhere I please, do whatever I want with the money in my pocket that I don't really work for. I have no ties. I don't believe there's anyone in the world whom I care for who would say they care for me. I'm not really a part of my family, and I don't have a wife or children or friends to call up. I would like a pen pal. A cute pin-up girl with bright eyes and a soft sweater, in a 50's pleated skirt; a photogenic old-fashioned sweetheart who'd mail me pictures from time to time (they don't make them like they used to, or at least like I wish they did). Everyone else seems to have one. I feel cheated, like a successful man put into a coma for a solid decade. (I bet the doctors robbed his family blind, too, and at least one of them must have had sex with his wife). I sometimes want to be the male star in those disgusting, forgettable Hollywood movies that the girls go crazy about, or the nameless guy that female singers are always crooning for on the radio. I'm not. 

And I feel like I'm falling apart. Sometimes my back hurts for no good reason (I think it loves to spite me, to let me know that I'm nothing without it). My stomach revolts occasionally when it doesn't get what it wants, like the bourgeoisie (I'm probably one of the only people these days who can spell that word confidently). My eyesight's been deteriorating since I was five (they told me it would get better, but it hasn't. Doctors always lie) and periodontal work will save my teeth only for a while. I'm going to break soon; I'm the dusty porcelain figure, perched precariously on the shelf; the one that you've warned its careless owner about so many times. I'll degenerate. I'll become a degenerate. I'll whore around like my asshole brother, whose philosophy on women is only to pay mind to the pretty ones, 'because you can't teach beauty'. I told him that the statement has humorous ambiguity to it, but he didn't get what I was driving at. Most people never do."

In my life I have filled four apple boxes with papers and pictures that aren't quite memories: they're a partial tally of my identity. These boxes contain my curios, my treasures, and the words and images I found too precious to let go. It is collectively a silent simulacrum of myself, a creature born of my recollections, free from wants and hopes, privy to even my incommunicable secrets. It is this, my broken, half-forgotten history of the ages that is next to me every night, and I always wonder if on one of my miniature safaris into the past I'll rediscover something radiant or moving; anything imbued with a certain nostalgic power so great and real that it becomes nearly tangible. Has there ever been something like that, something that gave me such perfect joy? I honestly don't remember. 

Observing my life in plastic bags and on ink-spattered sheaves of paper is distinctly surreal...it's a dreamlike moment of timelessness, like a dark eternity on the moon, which is itself now becoming a part of my record of epochs. I'm assailed by a kind of futility, even now--will anyone ever inherit this sliver of the world and make it theirs...or are my creations as mortal, transient, and unlooked for as I?"

Only in very rare cases is the dormant magic of human sensitivity realized in someone. Yet, unless the common person is by present standards decidedly uncommon, the mere fact that one is an individual who has undergone the normal process of education and social integration has made the average man or woman deaf to any true appeals to artistic senses. Aestheticism has been separated slowly and torturously from youth, and probably before the age of thirteen. Let's not lie to ourselves: the common human unit that we produce in our civilization is aesthetically a dead one. Many may cultivate art as a sign of 'culture', or as a passport to a different social circle. These same people may even acquire a feigned air of appreciation, and an illusion of understanding, but they are not moved. They do not love or hate or feel profoundly; they are not changed by the experience. They will not alter their ways of living. They will not tear themselves away from their revolting possessions, pull down their ugly houses, and break the cage where beauty lies imprisoned. After all, they have more sense, as normal people would say. Nothing is more disturbing than human docility."

Do you know the terrible urgency of the assembly of living moments we experience alone? If not, I do not expect you to seek them. I can understand that you might not want to be submerged in the choking sands of inward details: you have reason to fear that your time might be taken over by a semblance of inaction, by possibly fruitless memories of yourself and the population of your world by your scales. You stand to lose the beginning, ending, and midst of times that I know nothing of; the relations, the greetings, the goodbyes to which I am an outsider. My die has been cast: I have chosen the meaning, the purpose, that is palpably present in my ancestral, and instinctive, memories: to brand myself with hopes, griefs, agonies, ecstasies even. Nothing detectable by any means is entirely without meaning or influence therein. I maintain the sense of wonder in the bright infinity all around me, that path of humanity to which I pledge my small, but inspired, allegiance."

Language is a system which distorts by the necessity of creating a standard with which we measure and compare our existences. Language in particular insidiously encroaches upon our freedom: it incorporates the unjudged conclusions and rules of its creators, which cannot be denied, and refuses new innovations without broad consensus. Adopt any system, accept its premises, and you hinder advancement and change. By 2050 there will be only 120 languages actively used in the world; the number continually atrophies. We throw ourselves headlong into a thought-prison containing fewer and fewer words. More languages equate to more unique ideas, but our effort has been to simplify, to make certain languages universal. This is as stupid as it is harmful...have you ever realized that there are no words for some things? That is the frustration of a single system's limits made manifest. Thoughts specific to single languages impose themselves as external frames of reference. Accurate translation is impossible for truly embedded ideas. These terms are supremely welcome mysteries; they enrich our lives, granting us greater specificity and complexity. We must not forget that there are things that our ancestors knew which we cannot resurrect; even things that we know fleetingly for moments, but forget after failed explanations. We approach a standard, mechanized universe...even as communication becomes more free, the pool of dissenting and unique opinions, the new, the unknown, becomes progressively shallower. Civilization is a Tower of Babel."

School is a corrupted day care center. 

The hierarchy consists of worthless supervisors, unwiling to make changes; bigoted administrators, and the eternally ignorant school boards which forbid real teaching. Emotional release and sexual expression of the children under their rule is worse than taboo--it is actively punished. Commercial debauchery in our popular culture makes learning worse than the plague in the minds of youth. Academic curriculum is first grotesquely mangled and then homogenized by the demands of reactionaries, fundamentalists, and other demented warriors for the perverse. Personal attention to any student is as likely as a paper cat successfully chasing an asbestos dog through hell. The children--the brilliant, the average, and the dull--are systematically retarded, and the teacher is bound and gagged by the necessity of maintaining a job. Of course, the pay is low-- after all, the work is hard, unrewarding, and of public concern. It is said that low pay is why there is a shortage of teachers, and also why the best ones refuse the profession-- but my guess is that they avoid it because of the certainty of miseducation. Further, the best aren't even wanted by the system--they're too dangerous...they might actually teach practicalities and information applicable to life. God forbid--oops, can't say that in school either."

The view of life as change and flux is diametrically opposed by the tragically realistic vision that finds humankind's essential conditions to be unchanging. The grim, penetrating awareness of mortality and the desires that transcend even death--this is the human fate. Grief, greed, hate, want--these remain forever the same. We are born to work, to suffer, to have fleeting joys, to reminisce, and to die."

The Gedankenwelt--the thought-world--is an essentially non-physical entity arising from physical components. It is, in essence, an absolute: it is non-relative and non-subjective, containing all possible conceptions. To understand its infinitude, consider this pseudo-mathematical theorem: 

If t is a thought, then t is a possible thought, then 't is a possible thought' is a possible thought... 

and so on into infinity. From this, we can declare that thoughts are indeed inexhaustible, and so, therefore, is the imagination of humankind. Consciousness is a point that moves in mental space, but is itself too vast to be represented by finite words or symbols; and for any finite description of a set of ideas, there will be another set that also satisfies the description. What we think and feel is fundamentally inexpressible, but it is the human condition to keep trying."

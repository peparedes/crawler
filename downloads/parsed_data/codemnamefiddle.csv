"event","""I cringe from the heat of the night on my face. I feel as bare as open flesh. Tonight I am much older than the twenty-five years that I have lived . The night is the time I dread most in my life. Yet if I am to live, I must depend on it."" (Danticat 83)

Haiti is a non-literate culture. 80% or more of the people neither read nor write. Consequently, wisdom is oral. There are no detailed philosophical systems in Haiti. People hand down their knowledge and express it in proverbs. In the rural areas hardly 5 or 6 sentences can pass in any serious conversation without someone throwing in a proverb as defense of some idea. There are hundreds of proverbs. One very famous one is: 
Piti, piti, wazo fe nich li. 
Little by little the bird builds its nest 
And that's how we'll proceed. We'll share many of the popular Haitian proverbs with you. Here's a small sampling to start.
Konstitisyon se papie, bayonet se fe. 
The constitution is paper, bayonets are steel. 
Rache manyok bay te a blanch. 
Uproot the manioc, and clear the land. (A political proverb to advocate pulling out the Duvalierist system by the roots to replace it with something else.) 
Bondye Bon 
God is good. 
(This is a proverb of optimism and fatalism. Whatever happens is what God does, and what God does is for the best. There is another similar proverb that translates as:   The pencil of God has no eraser).
Dye mon, gen mon 
Beyond the mountain is another mountain (A proverb of both patience and the recognition of how difficult life in Haiti is.) 
Sak vid pa kanp 
An empty sack can't stand up. (You can't get much work done on an empty stomach.) 
Neg di san fe; 
People talk and don't act 
Bondye fe san di 
God acts and doesn't talk 
Pal franse pa di lespri pou sa 
To speak French doesn't mean you are smart (For most Haitians French is a foreign language; a language for ""putting on airs."" Thus the point here is: Fancy talk doesn't mean one has the brains to go with it.) 
Bourik swe pou chwal dekore ak dentel 
The donkey sweats so the horse can be decorated with lace 
Makak pa janm kwe petit-li led 
A monkey never thinks her baby's ugly 
Si travay te bon bagay, moun rich la pran-l lontan 
If work were a good thing the rich would have grabbed it a long time ago 
Li pale franse 
He speaks French (A person likely is deceiving you.) 
Kreyol pale, kreyol komprann 
Speak plainly, don't try to deceive"

"event","Im not usually into the whole rap-fasm thing, but I was downloading the new rap stuff so i could find out what people are listening to because I like to dance to a good beat every now and then. I downloaded Eminems, Like a toy sodlier, and i was like, man, those gangstas have it ruff. And yes I meant RUFF not rough, cause im hip on the lingo, Im not sure who rapped about his daughter, but hes not happy, and I am super curious as to who died, and who is sitting on the table shot, someone should tell me. I love music, MUSIC WITH A MESSAGE...thats nice, its better than saying, "" Im a slave for you."" ( code for: Let me jump your bone baby) so YE fucking HAW, thank you eminem.

When my brothers freinds are assholes to me.
When he makes them be assholes to me.
When he plays dumb about it.
When he acts so innocent.
When the dont have to balls to say things to my face.
When the say what they say and block me
When people enjoy causing pain.
When I cant do anytyhing about it.
When people tell me to ignore it. 
When I have to cry about it. 
When people think it shouldnt mean anything.
When i want to die..

She of course yelled at me, and told me she didnt want to talk to me until i didnt have an ""attitude""/ question she didnt have an answer for. what a bitch. I would go off somewhere and cry...but there is no where to do that, I dont have a fucking door for my bedroom so it isnt like i could go in there.

hollister coke orgy

The absolute emptiness of Internet celebrities

Mantricide.


When I find my feminine side I'm going to touch it

This is my hands on approach to adultery, an apparatus of unprecedented appeal. Look through this keyhole and we'll raise monuments of illicit sinew. Look through this keyhole and tell me you don't her curves. 


Livin' fast and killin' faster.

Dear dad, I'd like to thank you for hereditary alcoholism and passive aggressive tendencies. Dear kid , I'd like to note that you were the worst mistake I ever made. 

Cast off that cartharsis and climb into this casket.

Oh how i envy you. You're true blue so true fucking blue. And oh how i wish i was you, cause there's nothing quite like the copy. No there is nothing just like the copy. 

adultery:the gateway drug to bliss

we're every circuit in this ever shortening machine. while every memory is lost and we watch each other forget about each other. do you hear that sound? that's the sound of the two softest hearts breaking in two. 

 
there's a leech in the conduit

She's got you cloned, logged, and filed away. This is the part where you get to watch me watching you watch me get torn apart. You're just another cabinet door closed. You're just another notch in the headboard. I'm sure it will be oh-so invigorating when she cuts you off at the hip. (I'm sure) she'll love it when the lightning bolts shoot out from the wound and you die with ""why"" in your eyes. 


hollister coke orgy

Does having all this sex me look sad? snort: fashion and the lines of last year. Drink faster and the lies will last her. Get your lips of my lips, get your hips off my lips, get your eyes off my thighs!


The absolute emptiness of Internet celebrities

As our zeppelin careens perilously in this mountain, I just want you to know: as long as I had a biscuit you had half. As long as I had a dial tone, you were the stir in my pants. 


You know what goes great with being a cuckold? Alcohol, copious amounts of alcohol.

You're a steel trap in heat and I've got an alpha male's libido. You're not fooling anyone, but that's not stopping you. Your indiscretion is an inspiration, so spread your legs and fucking celebrate.

It was the strangest thing, the tumor actually said to me ""I'd like for you to lose everything that's ever meant anything to you.""

I could swear I see a uterus under your shirt. I could dare to say that it's breeding every lie that encourages us to die and tells all of tall tales of remorse and regret. Here's what my ovaries have to say to your uterus. ""Burn these bridges, burn them fucking down. And may god damn the day we ever met."" 

 
the transparent shit hits the fan.

You've lost touch with feelings for those closest to you. Take a look at yourself from the outside and maybe you'll see that the ones you're hurting can see right through this. It's time to change again. Stop ignoring this gap that you have created for yourself that is continually growing. 


Mantricide.

The virus! It! Is! Spreading! Take cover (lover,) or comfort (lover,) which ever you've prepared. A blind eye can (will! will!) make you invisible. the virus! The virus! It's injecting illusion despite despair. Would you never not dare?"

tell me you love me with that heart that spills over with hatred
its a shame that I  thought that you loved me
its a shame that I thought I loved you
I loved you with a heart overflowing with a deep and genuine love
but the love I held was not for you
the tears in my eyes have no shame
you show no emotion to them at all"

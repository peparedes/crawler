-registered for class.  i am officially a college student.

-inadequacy

-thursday is right around the corner and THAT means DISTRICT w/ V!

-michael is innocent and all of a sudden all the radio stations decide to play his good shit.  i don't get it.  mj is the greatest and i love him always.

fun times."

"event","I hate the treadmill everyday 
I hate the mundane things they say 
The boredom sets in nine to five 
At night that's when I come alive 


I long to be connected 
I long to be effected 
The bright lights beckon me 
Beckon me to you 
I like it when we go to extremes 
I like it when we enter my dreams 
I like it when I feel your touch 
I like it... I like it so much 
I like it when we're one on one 
I like it when we come undone 
I like it when we go to extremes 
You let me, let me live my dreams 
I like it so much 



There must be more to life than this 
This life you surely will not miss 
To spend my time waiting in line 
Search for something, a brand new time 
I long to be connected 
I long to be effected 
The bright lights beckon me 
Beckon me to you 



this song is the shit."

I'll say that I need you near
It's falling into place
These words that you want to hear
Another ride on the train
I drop you off once again
Brainwaves going insane
It's me and you in the end

This butterfly broke through my chest
Helped carry me home
There is no master plan my heart is in your hands

""These two are so in love""
You just light up my face
Wrap my arms around your ribs
Can't break this embrace

200 miles beneath this lake is where my heart belongs
But you don't care at all
You wouldn't even smile if I were screaming as the water filled my lungs
You demand to be chased for your love
My desperate heart is far too weak to run for you this long
But you don't care at all

There nothing I can do to draw you close to me
Can you take this silence like a pill so I can breathe again
I've been trying to ignore the best parts of you
But I'm still hoping that I'll be with you somehow

Please be home tonight
I'll die if I don't get a chance to make this just right
I'm sorry but I can't forget about the way I feel
Every time you're here.

What would it take for me to be with you
I swear I'd rip my heart out if you said you'd be impressed
I'd go so far to please you but I bet you wouldn't care at all
Hopeless love please leave me
This broken heart is far to weak to run for you this long
Why don't you care at all?
I'm dying for a place in your heart.
Can you take this silence like a pill so I can breathe again
I've been trying to ignore the best parts of you
But I'm still hoping that I'll be with you somehow

Please be home tonight
I'll die if I don't get a chance to make this just right
I'm sorry but I can't forget about the way I feel
Every time you're here.

Hopeless love, why did you carve your home in me?
This broken heart is too weak to hold your weight
And now I regret the day we met
And help me forget your name."

i'm wodering how long you need to do your affirmations, i want to beleive but nothing is happening, i just dont think it's working, i don't think it will work for me, you have to beleive love to receive love...i did find love, i beleived that there was someone out there for me and i met him, we had the best relationship, and then everything just fell apart, and i'm worried, i'm afraid that he took away my ability to beleive and i hate him for that because i always beleived before and now i just feel..lost,and i am trying to put myself out there but i feel hopeless

time...is every second of our lives controlled by FATE or is life just a series of random occurences if i was perpetually 10 minutes late, would my life be different....i can't help but wonder..

is timing everything?"

So there's 8 juniors, me being one of them...all in one room for the whole day doing nothing.  I was the only girl and I was extremely anxious to leave.  

So lunch time...I went to the office to leave early, nobody there so I was gone.  I get home and crazy lady calls my house saying I disappeared and that I was missing blah blah.  At first, I was skeptical to leave without letting the office know...I just took my chances.

Whatever...now I'm just excited for today and tomorrow...party after party after the after party.  Also, got my Britney ticket to go see her in July and it's really good seats so yea rock on Britney and a big fuck you very much to school."

On my arrival to the MIA was the best finale of the trip.  So I am walking to the baggage claim and I see this girl sitting and I realized after staring that it was Katrina from The Apprentice!  I approached her and we took a picture but it was very cool because she was so nice and on the show she's depicted as a total bitch but I didn't really care because she was one of my favorites on the show.

Highlights of spring break..

-seeing all my friends that I hadn't seen in years
-meeting Alicia Keys and Treach
-hott clubs, hott guys
-shopping in Soho w/ Madeleine
-Times Square, 5th Avenue w/ everyone
-dinner at Mikes on Saturday w/ Rob,Jocelyn, and Karina.
-Coldstone at 1 in the morning
-train rides to the city w/ Madeleine
-after school coffee w/ Michael
-Serendipidies frozen hot chocolate
-meeting Katrina!
-and more sneaker shopping =)


best time ever. 

p.s - I hope my computer gets fixed soon. I'm at the library right now surrounded by little kids on computers and I feel weird =/"

i came to a concrete conclusion.  miami dislikes me oh so much.

i cant wait to be with my friends, my family, my old lifestyle that i am dying to go back to even if its only a week.

these past few weeks have been nothing but lonely and overslept.

all i need is a sign.  its like the more time that goes by, the emptier i become and one day, there will be nothing left but the sound of music.

i have nobody.  nothing.  i need my life back, i need to not be so weak.  i need not to cry.

i need change.


give me something. anything.

So I get home and the UPS guy gives me a huge box from Fortunoff's, I'm sitting there looking at it for about...ehh 40 minutes trying to figure out who it's from.

I open the box...hundreds and hundreds of styrofoam balls inside.  Funniest thing ever, I couldn't find the actual box with whatever was inside and I did after searching in there.  I open this box and it was the size of a set of plates or something.  I open that box and it filled with the balls again, so me and my mom are laughing so hard we didn't see the point.  Inside we found a gift from Michael's mom thanking me for letting him stay and taking care of him.  I got emotional haha.  That just made my whole day.

School sucked, nobody knew it was my b-day which I could care less because it seems that the ones that I truy care about wished me a happy birthday and I'm so thankful for these people.  

I have a huge smile on my face, as if I slept with a hanger in my mouth.


Much Love to all of you <33"

"event","Woke up very dreary today...after 20 hours of sleep
days have been boring...just relaxing I guess

yesterday I had to go to school to get some papers that never got sent home and I found out there was no more room for the hours I wanted to do at the Lourdes event that was coming up in February.  I needed to see where the school was located at anyway because my ring ceremony is going to be held there and I didn't want to get lost that day so good thing now I went to check out where the school was.  It was surprisingly small but I like where it is, me and my sister thought it was nice.(Thank you V for the directions =D)

I don't know what is going on today...I'm just so bored and I have plenty or things to do hmm...like read, I love to read and I haven't had time lately to just sit down with no noise and read a a good book from cover to cover.  Maybe I'll just go to Barnes & Noble later to read there, I'm there most of the time anyway, it's my favorite place besides the gym to just relax and get my mind off everything else.

And I'm off..

<33...Marie"

"event","Theres nothing terribly wrong with feeling lost, so long as that feeling precedes some plan on your part to actually do something about it. Too often a person grows complacent with their disillusionment, perpetually wearing their ""discomfort"" like a favorite shirt. 

There is absolutely no point in sitting around and feeling sorry for youself. The great power you have is to let go ... focus on what you have, no that which has been mean or unkindly removed.


When you are low with nowhere to go remember this, when you open your eyes, your heart, your spirit, yourself, there you will find the stranger called hope.  I found this on my sign:

Aquarius..
Such is hope, heaven's own gift to struggling mortals, pervading, like some subtle essence from the skies, all things both good and bad.

I had deep thoughts today throughout the day, writing them down in class whenever they'd hit me so I would not forget =D"

"event","Well I know you all (concidering like, a what, whole 2 ppl actually ready my journal...) have all been waiting to hear about what happend with Jared and I on Friday... Well have NO FEAR!... I am here to tell all :o)...

Friday at work I got a call from Jared at my last break saying that he wouldn't be able to go out with me to the movies. I was so sad :o( He was really sweet about it and said that he'd make it up to me and take me out someother time and that he felt horrible about it. So yeah I took the hit. I began to think that he never really had the intention to go out to the movies with me and that he was just being nice and doing the polite thing to do. So I kinda fished up my night at the cafe, of course calling Cali on my cell after Jared called. What a great best friend! I LOVE YA GURL!!! She made me feel a lot better by saying all that good stuff like ""you dont deserve him"" ""you can do sooo much better"" and all the good stuff girl friends tell you. So I was felling a lot better when I left work. So I go out to my car and find this note on my windshield. It said (here let me go get it ....lol)

This is what the note said: Gen, I'm really sorry about breaking our movie date. I'd like to make it up to you so meet me at the gas station in town at 10 -Jared

So I drove up to the gas station since it was like 10 to anyways. And there he was. He apologized for having to stand me up (awww how sweet, as if the letter alone wasnt cute enough). So he took my out for ice cream at the Frosty. :o) (He even paid for it too!) I wanted to cry. So we just kinda sat on out on the hood of his car and talked. We talked about the most random stuff ever! But it was one of thoes really great convos that you have with a person. It was special. Then as I had to head home, he asked if we could go out tomorrow (saturday night). He said ""I heard they're playing this really good movie at the theater; it's called ""The Sum of All Fears"". Would you care to join me tomrrow evening"", or something like that. I was like HELL YEAH!!! So saturday night he picked me up and we went to the movies. It was great he didn't try anything, not hold my hand or even kiss me at the end of the date. And I liked that b/c it showed that he respected me and that he wasn't going to pressure me just b/c he's older, you know? So that was like me weekend.... :o) AHHH! I guess boys can be great after all....Untill next time ...

"event","Well nothing much really happened yesterday...I went to work and saw Jared...ahhh that hunk of a man. I'd do ne thing to be with that guy. But I find it hardly believeable that he would waste his time on me. I mean hes gorgeous, ladies. He's like Abercrombie model material. Dont ask why he even works at the cafe, he should be out working as a model. Well anyways heres the news of my life. Last night at work we were talking about how we both want to see ""The sum of all fears"" and hes like ""well I have to go to this family thing on Friday after work (he gets out at 3:30, I get out at 8 on friday), but if I can make my little appearence I'll swing by after you get out  of work and we can go see it together"" OMG!!! OMG!!! OMG!!! I, yes ME!, could be going to the movie with...dun dun dun dun... JARED!!!! OMG I'm gonna shit myself. I dont know what this guy is thinking. I'm way out of his league, but we'll see... Who knows he may never call me back or he might but call to cancel. I cant get my hopes too high up. OK I think I'm done freaking out for the day.. I gotta get ready for work I gotta be there at 1:30...ahhh! Must hurry!! Later :o)

Ive been trying to get Cali a job up there too but my manager is being a bitch. There's like so many shitty workers that she complains about. I'm like why dont you fire them and then hire Cal.

"event","Wow it's been quite awhile since I last wrote in here. I had fun at prom. Cali and Luke were just too cute. They should really hook up. Grant was fun, but he's the kinda of shy guy that doens't really dance. I wanted to get up and go dance around and have fun, but this was his prom and I didn't want to ditch him or make him that that I was a bad date. Afterwards, we all drove around and went to wall mart all dressed up and had some crazy fun. People were all looking at us like a bunch iof weirdos...it was great! 
I met this kid online named Alex, he sent me a pic and he's hot too. He's like a Sophmore at CMU, I think. Anyways he wanted to do something this weekend,  like see a movie. I can't tell my mom about this, but I'm going to bring Calli and Katilyn for support, you know, incase he turns out to be some pysco mad rapest. Ill tell him to bring some friends along for my gurls too. Maybe this weekend we'll all hang out. Well I must be getting to bed now. G-night

"event","Well I got some good news. I got asked to prom by Grant. I hope that this doesnt make Calli upset or anything, but who knows b/c shes so wrapped up in Luke now she doesn't even remeber to go to bed at night. Everytime I call that gurls house who ever answers the phone is like, ""shes out w/Luke!"" Tristan FINALLY asked out Katilyn after likeing the gurl for almost 2 years. I think that they'll be cute together....awww:) Calli and I are going to the mall somethime this week to look for a prom dress. I can't wait! I think that Josh was a little mad about this whole situation. I think he likes me. I mean we kind of have something going on, but nothing official. Like it's obvious that we both care a lot about eachother. We both flirt a lot and hang out a lot. So i don't know. I only think the true reason that Grant asked me was b/c he didn't think that he could get anyother gurl to go with him...wich is so not true. He could get gurls if he tried. He's just too shy. Anyways, back to my point, I think Grant asked me was b/c I'm best friends with Katilyn and he knows me. I'm over at his house all the time. He's also like apart of our group. When the gang all goes to hang out, he's there. So I'm guessing that he feels comfortable with me, and that he knows me well, so that he won't have a shitty prom w/someone he doesn't know. I guess that makes sence...lol oh well. I'm outta this joint!

I'm trying to see how long I can go w/o really talking to him. I think Luke likes her...awww! Maybe he'll ask her to prom. Kati's going w/Nick I think, oh wait, maybe that's Alissa...I don't know.

"event","There's a huge party May 2nd.
I'm working all summer at a Law Firm and at a Scuba Shop.
My new tigercard picture looks like I have horns made from hair (damned hats).
We have a house on N. College Street (kick ass).
My exams will soon be over (thank god).
I'm dating someone (as confusing as it may be).
and otherwise life is good... had to be cheerful after my shitty depressing last post."

"event","Yes as my title says it is all so true.  This is the time where I reflect back on the year.  I reflect back on the friends and I have made some great ones which I will truly miss this summer.  Made two great friends who have many similar interests and will be my roomates next year: Russel and Henry.  Definitely will miss the wild nights at George's with Pantelis, Birdsong, Clay, and others.

That allowed for a wonderful first semester.  But second semester allowed for different plans... she really was unexpected and yet when I met her, I couldn't help but feel attracted.  And then, it felt as if I'd known her for years.  Slowly we got to know each other more... and I fell in love.  Unfortunately so did she.  Only then did I realize she had a boyfriend.  And now we've been seeing each other for several months and those months of frustration are finally setting in.  She makes me smile in a way no one else can and when I'm with her, I know everything is great... but... little things that shouldn't bother me are starting to.  Its the pent up frustration seeking a vent.  We're not officially together and how could we be.  She still can't decide who she wants and I'm walking along thinking she'll pick me.  Me? a 20 year old Junior who isn't even sure he'll get into law school.

I know this summer will be rough and I want to spend time with her but... I can't. I won't spend time with her if it means us arguing.  I don't know if its me speaking in blindness caused by love or what in the hell is going on but...just frustration.  I guess it's because we're not together in public and I want to be.  We can't even tell her damned roomate... and yet, she acts as if we're normal friends in public... how does she do it? how does she handle it?!

In the first semester, I search for love.  In the second, I quit searching and let life continue and it found me.  Yet once more I feel that everything I've desired has fallen into my lap and I don't know how to handle it.  And so to this hapless void I commit this entry, a lone thought, a frustration from the recesses of my mind only to be lost in cyberspace.

To hell with my thoughts, for now, I must focus on the present and ignore all other things."

"event","Looking back on it all, I can see all my mistakes.
I can see all the missed opportunities,
and all my stupid outakes.
I can see all my messed up friendships,
and all that I did wrong,
but most of all, I can see who I was.

But that was then, and this is now,
yet, I can't help but think:
""It's funny you know,
I thought I knew who I was back then,
a senior about to graduate,
the king of the hill,
I thought I had life figured out,
Boy had I thought wrong.""

Life's little stumbles,
those little falls,
the ones I thought were the world,
and the ones I worried the most about.
Did they matter any?
Now I can tell you not.
For today I am still fine,
and some of those problems still aren't worked out.

Now every day I learn something new,
and yet the more I learn, the more I realize I don't know.
But it's cool you know,
my friends teach me about life each day,
lessons that I couldn't learn any other way.

And so now before time's end,
I can't help but wonder who I was then,
Why does it seem another lifetime,
yet when all that's happened is less than 2 year's blend.
I am happy with who I am now,
Happy with what I have,
I know I still make mistakes,
but that's me, that's who I am,
I know I'm not perfect.
And so now I thank my friends,
for without them, I would not be,
the good, the bad, it's all parts of who I choose to be."

"event","well, this morning, the English department head walks into our class.  Waits for us to settle down for a minute or two, and then starts with: I'm sorry to announce that Dr. Bancroft passed away this morning of a heart attack... so our whole class is sitting there going WTF?!  I was dumbfounded.  Well, he pretty much said class is cancelled till they can get someone to take care of it, most likely a GTA and so to expect an email.... talk about odd, especially since we'd just finished talking about The Inferno (Dante).

I find it sad that the knowledge he had was lost and he was definitely a bright man and an alright professor."

"event","So apparently I'm a decent poker player... I took 1st place in the last 2 of 4 tournaments and made it to the final table 3 out of 4 times.  Thus far my winnings include a 5 CD Changer Stereo and a set of 200 chips.  Not too shabby IMO for free buy-in tourneys.  

Now for Halloween.  This started thursday night with Heather's birthday.   Friday, Halloween Party with Rocky.  That boy is funny and his friend from UA is definitely a 9 on my scale, especially in that angel outfit (though she still needed horns).  Saturday, block party at Heather's and seeing Jason Barts in drag talking to the cop for 20 minutes was classic, plus Catie as my sexy secretary definitely made my night.  Sunday, out for coffee with a couple friends, hung out, that's about it.

This week is flying by! Bush got elected (ALRIGHT!) and now it's already Thursday! and work is in 6 hours, Sleep Time!

P.S. oh yeah, I definitely lost the Flower's Avenue house due to previous offers... so back in the search of a house."

Oh yeah, also got my absentee ballot today and voted for the one, the only, the W.  And I also voted for a lot of other republicans b/c I had no idea who they were and were running for the same party I was interested in... coat tail effect.  Also voted for the amendment to the constitution which says parents of minors have to be notified if their kid plans to have an abortion.  Definitely think my views tend to be conservative and not liberal, but I could be middle of the road, who knows."

I'm sore as heck, I'm gonna have a bruise on my left arm and leg (thanks J... though they were good shots) and my left testicle barely got missed but man that was amazing fun!

On top of that I went to a party at Clay's then we meandered over to Kelly's last night.  A girl from AZD (whatever it could be ADZ, no idea) was there and she had drank a bit too much so I drove some stranger's car back to the dorms for her and dropped her off... but better me drive than she drive, I can handle a couple drinks, apparently she could not.  Now if only her sorority sister would quit sending mixed signals... oh well, plenty of fish in the sea, if 1 is missed, try try again.  Peace y'all."

"event","Damn good! Chris Pentelis' 25th birthday and we celebrated.  Friday night was time for George's place.  Little Ben gave me a ride to and from there (thank you man!).  Hung out over there, played a couple games, chilled, then somehow 2:30 AM crept up on us and we were like, hm... and on her way out, got a big hug from mary and then I was like time for sleep. And sleep I did.  Then around noonish I woke up, goofed around for a couple hours and then headed off to work till midnight.  Midnight, I got changed and headed to Clay's for another birthday party (for Chris) and was definitely glad to see Mary.  So around 2:30 AM (I see a pattern here) we all decided we should go on the roof and relax up there.  Mind you I've not drank but there's about 3 tipsy guys and 2 drunk ones and a girl (Mary) climbing a 30 foot makeshift ladder (actually a wall) to the roof, so we got up there and talked for a bit.  Around 3:30 we all came down and I took Mary back to her dorm.  Came back to hear that Mike... retard that he is... driving George's car at the time, got pulled over near Kinnucans.  Mike is 20, the car smelled like a brewery and so did he, and the guy got off with a TICKET!  Lucky lucky lucky.  So anyhow, it's rolling near 4:10 now and we decide it's time for Waffle House.  So quick trip to the ATM, bit of deciding which Waffle House and about 4:45 we make it there.  So Jay, Chris, Clay and I ate breakfast, I dropped Clay off at his place and then once again, it was time for sleep.  And talk about feeling lonely, what I wouldn't have given to come back to my room with a girl to just crawl in bed with and hold and just fall asleep next to.  Strangely enough, I had a dream that I was sleeping next to a gorgeous girl with the sweetest smelling hair with my arms wrapped around her ... and I woke up to find my pillow with my arm wrapped around it... damned dreams ;)

Alright, so now to the serious part of this post.  I've known half these people for what... a couple months and yet it feels that I've known them forever.  I trust Pentelis with my life, Clay is a good man and someone I trust.  Benji definitely is the friend I've thought him to be.  Berford is laid back, and Lucas is a trip, this guy always smiles and always cracks jokes.  George is easy going about everything and throws some good parties.  And right now i'm forgetting a lot of names but 2 weekends from now (b/c next weekend I'm in Florida!), I'll remember them.  Funny how I was looking for brotherhood and now I find some great friends.  Definitely going to be hard to decide whether or not to stay in Auburn"

Then again, it's also interesting b/c I hit it off rather well with Erin, but she goes home a lot on weekends so that makes setting up a time where she can come hang out at a party with myself and some friends rather difficult, oh well, its not like I don't have all the time in the world.

Then there's a cute girl that I keep catching staring my way... so first I thought ok there's something on my face, no...  So she kept at it and every time I'd catch her, she'd blush and quickly look away.  On her way out, I got a big smile from her, interesting.  I remember meeting her at some Honor's thing but her name completely skipped my mind.

Then there's Lori whom I'm trying to help out with her guy problems.  Yeah like that's really working.  At least I spent 2 hours massaging she and Tara tonight.  Definitely was enjoyable though.

So yep, apart from taking Chris to the doctor's and hanging out with him a little bit today, the rest of my day was spent in the sea of estrogen.  Must say though, a fair share of them were cute.

So I've been trying to be nicer to the girls, especially Shannon... not too sure if that's working, especially last night when she went off on me about being such a hypocrite.

So, overall, I've been trying to change my perspective on things... I'm trying to find the good in all situations.  It's so easy to see the bad, to complain, and etc... but I'm pretty sure it doesn't make me a fun person to be around.  Unfortunately, change is slow and progressive...  I wish I could just snap my finger and change would happen.  Ahh well guess I'll just have to keep trying, and if I screw up, get back up and try again.

On a positive note, I saw Benji today, haven't seen him in about a week.  Boy's been busy apparently!  I think I'll talk to him about getting some beer, sit down, hang out this weekend.  Who knows, gotta check how much accounts are doing before I do that.  All in all, things are good, bike's in the process of getting fixed.

No, the point is that Thomas and Daniel were GONE and when I mean gone, I mean I got Thomas up to his room, came back 30 mins later to find him in his boxers, passed out in a pool of his own puke, face up with some weird stuff in his mouth.  My first thoughts, OH GOD! he's choked on his own puke and died.  So I go for a pulse, no pulse.  So I pushed on his chest, he spits up some weird shit and then does a shallow breath.  Whew! He's alive!  So I sat him up... eventually dragged him into his bed, my arms now have vomit on them. He gets on his back and I roll him to his stomach with his head off his bed.  By now, a dude comes up and says Daniel is having dry heaves down in the lobby... SON OF A!!!!! Will this night ever end?  So I haul it downstairs, call Mikie and have him help me get Daniel up to his room where we put him in the bath tub.  He puked, said he'd be fine and I cleaned myself off and left... 

Thank god Mikie and Kyle were there, they RULED.  They were helpin me out the whole time and did most the work.  Mikie rocks, I owe him a drink or 3 one of these days.  And no more driving to parties for me.  Let the pledges take people home.

Oh yeah... so about 2 AM I get a call from Dave and I decide to go check on Thomas... well I find Corey in there and the paramedics are on their way to take him to EAMC... so I followed with and stayed with him all night long, talked to his distressed mother, and greeted his dad around 4 AM when he drove out here...  His parents were happy that I stayed with him all night long and he deserved it, he's a good guy.  He's all better now so ... I get to go to sleep, but I spent from 2 AM to 7 AM in the ER  staring at a passed out Thomas.  Thank god he's fine."

"event","Ya know, it's been about 3 weekends that I've gone out on the town here in Auburn and have gone drinking.  All around me my friends have been plastered (minus our DD who was so kind) and I have sat there drinking away not going anywhere.  And so, I wondered to myself, why?

Of course, there's no simple explanation... but IMO, it's done for confidence.  Ya see, tonight at the TKE party, I had a couple drinks and was yet to feel anything... however, the people that were drunk had no problems making fools of themselves dancing in front of everyone.  The alcohol gives you a confidence to do things you could not normally do.

Now that may seem a little far fetched... alright, take this example.  A friend of mine and I were at this party.  Both of us are checking out an obviously hot, and amazingly single girl.  So he looks at me and goes go introduce yourself.  Anyone that's known me more than 5 minutes know that I have nowhere near the balls to go to that (at least without having drank a fair amount).  Well, I retorted that he should do so.  Having had twice as much to drink as I had, he preceded to do so and ended up dancing with her. Lucky bastard.

Now, these two examples prove that alcohol and drunken-ness can be fun.  Don't get me wrong, I don't 100% condone it and yes it is a sin... however, a sin is a sin, whether it be drunk or a lie or stealing a pencil.  Yet, now, I understand why some of the people in this building go out for the intent of getting drunk.  And hopefully, tomorrow night, I shall be too.


And on a parting note... why am I trying to hook Ben and Shannon up together?  I feel like I'm shooting myself in the foot by doing that... not that I had a chance with her in the first place... Gah! confusing."

I'm definitely glad we talked, so much closure was there.  She and I are still the same people we were, at least in part, but for the most, we've changed so much.  We've become two completely different people and I love that.  College does that and the college you go to shapes you.  I'm glad she and I have grown apart, it means that I can surrender myself into God's hands and let Him craft my life as it should be.

I joked about it then and went to sleep with that eerie, hmm I am going to crash feeling.  I woke up quite cheerfully and before I went to ride, I checked my gear with that feeling still there.

"event","And I got neither.  I pretty much did a highside crash after a decreasing apex turn.  All the fancy terminology aside, there was a hill which had a turn at the bottom of it, I popped over the top of the hill going about 43 (incoming speed for my turn) lined myself up properly, swerved around a patch of gravel, hit my turn, rolled on the throttle, saw a patch a gravel, had my rear tire swing out from under me, slide off the road into the soft dirt shoulder and then my front wheel followed.  Well, I went from a 45 degree turn to a straight up in .5 of a second and flew over the bike, pushed off so it wouldn't highside me and I slid into the road.  The bike slid into the ditch where it shattered my fairings (right side if I remember right) and my instrument cluster.  My front forks are slightly bent.  So now it's 1 AM and alls I really want is a cute girl to cuddle with, a whiskey and coke to relax me, and someone to tell me everything will be alright.  I mean I know it will be and shit'll buff out but this is just one thing added to the mix...  More straw onto the camel's back, let's see how much more he holds before it breaks.  Definitely not looking to have another breakdown this year, 3 months of depression last year was bad enough.  But it could have been worse, my pants didn't get torn up but my legs got slightly scratched, my hands are ok minus a slight weird thing on my left hand, and my left lower leg is hurting like a mother. rest of me is fine.

So I leave Ben's at 7:50 and am there for the 8 PM meeting, go to it, swing by Wings to Go hoping to catch the rest of the bikers but they were gone.  So I went back to Ben's and caught a SWEET lean turn at Thach and College (as in past 45 degrees of leaning) and then almost curb bit it at Dean and Thach (_*#%#_+%*#+_*% retarded drivers in cars plus my stupid mistake and yeah) but everything turned out alright so Thank God and know that he's watching out for me.  Now I'm just trying to be unconfused as to what's up with Shan... she's been acting odd in the last 2 days and then I'm sitting there trying to flirt with Audrey and I don't know why.  I mean I do, but I don't.  She's a gorgeous girl, sweet as anything, and probably knows me better than anyone alive, like she's the TYPE of girl I could see myself marrying.  Not her in particular though.  So I can see why I'm flirting with her but I also don't want anything to happen between she and I b/c I've enjoyed my friendship with her so much and don't want it to go the way Jackie and I went.  It's odd though, I really want to start dating again and I'm worried that I'm not looking for THE girl but any girl.  As Audrey says, it'll all happen in due timing, I just need to quit looking for it.  Easier said than done.  Ok, now i'm going to write Jackie an e-mail and call her tomorrow afternoon.  Bye y'all."

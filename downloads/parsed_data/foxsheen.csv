today started off with doulbe science. guess what we did?? we played Titanic and Twinkle Little star with the freaking wine glasses with water in them (you know waht they do on Miss.Congeiality??) fucking hillarious!
then we had living scenes which was class today. old poeple are so cool! :D
me and sarah kinda got our hopes up at lunch for the jam thing but then when me pam and marieke were in the gaf, she got a phone call saying that we did'nt make it to jam :'( i'm dissappointed but ah well...at least we are still playing Blast! Was talking to Brian today (got to see his goregous bass) and Thoas gave me a bass dudes number or something. yea.. anyways just lazed about the gaf for a while talking and listening to johnny cash on cormac's iPod!
Later

Unfortunately this is might be no more :( A girl in my class is being deported back to Nigeria. Ridiculous. I know some of your are thinking 'well she iggeal, get rid of her'...well that's rubbish. She did a really good J.C and has been living in Ireland for the last 4/5years and SHOULD'T go. Everyone at school is going to try their best to stop this. I hope it works. Nearly everyone started crying today when we got the news we were so shocked.

That me stpry for the day

School = ok
Became managing director of the mini-company...tried to organise stuff...NO ONE WOULD FUCKING LISTEN YOU SHITS!!!
Went to the Gaf to write songs after school...saw an a guy i like realised he has no interest in me
Went to the bus stop. It rained. Heavily. Battery in MP3 went. Bus didn't come. Waited for 45mins. No bus. Got Dad to pick me up. I had to walk far to meet him. Fabulous day. I hope you can sense the sarcasm here people.

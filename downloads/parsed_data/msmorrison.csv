"event","Hey hey...Well I got my job!! YEAHHH I can have money now. Sorry i havnt been up on things but I have beeen a super duper busy girl! Homecoming was soo freaken boring because it absolutly  sucked my ass. But after is a night I will never ever forget! I went out with Ryan and Benny last night and it was soo much fun! It was so much like the old times...Back in the day! Well we went all around and drank a lil and smoked a lil and then we pulled down the seat in Bens SUV looked at the stars, talked and stuff all night long!  It was absolutly amazing it was like hanging out with them for the first time. I love it when it is just us three..we are ridicously insane crazy dude! I dont think you are even aware of how crazy the shit we do is. The worst part was when the sun came up! I was laying in the middle of Ryan and Ben and my ass kept Benny warm. So he decided to call me the ass-o-rader! He also has decided to release a series on my boobs called Kelly's soft boobs and is planning to end his series with Kelly's soft Jugs...lol Clown! I have to say Benny would be a great couch lol! Of course my night would not have been complete without Ryan because he is the most amazing and beautiful person I have ever met! I have always thought that about him for the three years I have known him. When he walks in a room my world stops! But anyway he is awesome! I love my babies! well I'll update you..."

"event","Hey guys...God life is a drag sometimes but you know..you always get through it but at one time or another you just have to deal with it. Last night I went to the recher and this band came up and my heart stopped and I was drawn to the bass player. He was sooo gorgeous he was the kind of guy I have always drempt about, with the long curly hair (Jim Morrison)and he likes the same music as me when some guys hate it! SO after the show he was behind me and I ran into him and our eyes met and he said did you like the show and I was like yeah and he gave me a hug and asked of my number...WOW! I don't know if he'll call me though.I went with my cousin and her boyfriend and their drunkened friend Chris. 

I have been missing flynn lately, I don't know why but he always seems to cross my mind and doesn't leave. I think even though we are broken up there is still a part of him in me that wont ever leave no matter what happens. but ahh I don't know. There is also something else that I could talk about but I can't put it in here..it's one of the main things on my mind and it hurts...hurts so bad! God country music is so depressing no matter I don't like it but my brother does, so I have to hear it all the time! I am fighting wiht my best friend over something stupid but I have a right to be mad because it happens all the time. Well I got us tickets for the several species concert and she was like ""I'm going wiht Maura"" when she told me she would go with me and now I have noone to go with so if anyone want to go wiht me please tell me, I would appreciate it! I'm complaining so much because I am PMSing so just BEWARE lol! Well G2G *Muah*

*Can I tell it like it is? Help me I'm sufferin'
Listen to me baby-Help me I'm dyin'
It's my heart that's a sufferin', it's a dyin'
That's what I have to lose
I've got an answer
I'm going to fly away
What have I got to lose?* Suite Judy BLUE EYES- Crosby, Stills and Nash"

I think I passed my drug test because Mars called today and they want me to finish my training.

Today my dad had a drug talk with me and my brother and we were very honest with each other and he wasnt mad at all. My dad is actually kinda cool. Friday night I hung out with Carrisa and we smoked and chilled. We always wake up in the middle of the night and have a conversation and then go back to sleep and when we are over her house we wake up and pet the cats lol! She is so awesome and I am glad i finally got to spend time with her bacause we are both always really busy. Last night I went to the greek festival with Christa and we had alotta fun greek dancing. I love her greek friends they are so funny! She kinda of scared me last night because she has a heart mermer and she had an attack last night everyone was so upset but she is all better now and I am happy :]! OMG Karate Kid is on and the Italian boy is so hot I wish I could find someone like him. I would just stare at him the whole time. Now I am going to homecoming with my friend steve. He is a fun kid. We always have so much fun dancing. we sometimes act liek we go out but we arent but we both know we are going to get married lol.

"event","WOW dude I have not had that much fun in like 5 years! Last night was ridiculous! Ok well I get a text from Bobby saying that he could'nt come over and I was soo bumed but then I talked to Ben and he picked me up. We went to pick up Becca. On the way over to Robbys me and her were talking about stupid shit like shaving. Ben and Ryan kept getting mad cuz they didn'nt know what we were talking about. We get to Robby's and we stayed for like 10 mins. I saw my boy Bryan Miller who I haven't seen in forever. I saw him actually kiss a girl(brings a tear). Robby told us his rents were coming home and we booked! Becca, Ry,Benny and I all went back to Ryan's. All I'm going to say is some freaky shit went down LOL. All of us were trying to teach Becca how to do shots. That shit was funny. We were all drinking so we go back to Robby's and chilled with everyone that was at Robby's but outside. This Hick as mother fucker gets in the car next to me and starts talking shit. Ryan goes ""shut the fuck up"" and the guy Mark wanted to fight. Mark, Ryan and I all get out of the car cuz I was'nt about to watch Ryan fight so I standing in the middle of them with a beer in my hand. All of a sudden they were cool. I was like WTF just happened. We drop off Mark and went to this kid chris's house. I don't really remember anything after that because I was gone. All I really remember is crashing at Syd's house LOL. 

Earlier that morning Allie came over and she said the funniest shit. She was talking about how these two girls talk about Harry Potter and lord of the wings...Wings WHAT?!? I thought it was lord of the RINGS lol< That's my girl"

"event","Sorry guys but I erased all of my other entries...Today was a very long and stressful day like this whole week has been. today was a brand new day concidering yesterday wasn't a good one at all. Although I was worried about my drug test. What really made my day was I have a B in child Development and I thought I had an E. Of course Lunch was soo much fun wiht stephen and shane the can turn my day upside down even when I am having a really bad one. It was funny because they were telling me to chug my ready clean which I had to take. I hoped it wokr. when I got home I got in a huge fight with Sydney it was my fault though because I hadnt eaten all day and when I dont eat I get grumpy. So christa called me and she came over for like an hour until my dad came home and he took me to get my drug test. When I was driving home from the health center they were talking about on the radio how an NFL player failed his drug test and it freaked me out for a little bit. When I got home I called mup Allie and we met up and talked. She walked me upo to Carrisas. We waited for ever until 7:00 and her brother in law took us to the school. When we got there the DJ wasnt there he didnt show up at all!!! AHHHH...so my friend Jenny came to the rescue and played her guitar for everyone then finally Ms. Erdman put on some music from a little ass stareo and an amp it was sooo funny! There was this kid who was sooo fucking annoying and kept fallowing me asking me for a hug Carrisa held him back and was like ""Kelly RUN!!"" Me and her had alotta fun even though some of the times it was boring. Hopefully Bobby will come over tomarrow and we can chill I don't know if he will though because I think I scared him by telling him how I felt...I hope he understands that I was just in a bad mood and it wasnt really as serious as I made it to be...well guess I just have to see until tomarrow until then Goodnight everyone*Muah*

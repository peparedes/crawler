but ive seen alot of fucked up faces
ive had to be shady and loot
now i spit it out in the booth
about where ive been
i only travel with my friends
we all been to heaven
we call it the kronik room man
shady people like to stop by
to drop off the drugs and maybe stay to get high
the land lady was shawns mom
but we smoked weed all the time it was the bomb
smikin bluntz with ten people crowdin 
wile shawns mom was prayin and bowin
shit got fucked up and we out stayed our welcom
we all got kicked out and told to go home
but home wasnt an option for the fucked up tribe
so we found a new place to hid

hit up the farms full of the shadiest
CRD was funny but still a pest
smokin
and drinkin
and doin alll the drugs we could handle
but the cops seemed to get involved with skandle
it seemed that jay the man was under servaliance
but we still didnt care its time to protest
and even thou things seemed all right
drama hit again and jay almost took another life
skantless people are different from shady
shady will steel but skantless will sell you baby
and make 6 bucks from the pedifile on the third floor
and it dont matter to him it was the daughter of a whore
and when the police raid the place they dont find the baby not even a trace
and i feel discrace cant look in the face,need to kill him to replace
the damage dont fro real sun
it dont matter this rymes just begun
i aint got to flow and go together
i will change the topic when ever
and to show ho clever i realy am
hit me up i got that meth yall 
man 
hit me up i didnt say hit me
even when i was down that was meen g
lowest time i could ever be and you fell the need to fuck with me
im not in the best of all moods if you didnt know
i got confused and played by some dumb ho
and its all for the better
ill be tight with my homeis and we will hunt to gether
just a pack of wild guys when jay gets back
it will all change
the name of the game will be grown up and straight
but still havin fun
still rockin a gun
still loookin to blow a load in some one
or on some ones face
this crew is all discraced
all cracked out
and every one hates 
us
wahts the fuss
so we like to cuss
it aint like you dont do it
come on i can even proove it
like that time you said nigger wheile we where walkin
you said it 
i herd it when we where talkin
blunts
its a must before we do anything we gotta roll one up
and we smoke it 
then hit the streets
no one can fuck with us
last time we had beef
me and pierce had the backs of twenty three
guys from all over
it coulda been handled by the two of us alone
but the crew dosnt leave these matters alone
we gotta protect
whats inside
its all about pride
and the fact that when we fuck up we dont hide
we get even

and i see the sun rising
on the other side fo the streets
and the crack head skurry and skeet
got to make somethin of myself
but i dont like school i do it for some one else
i would like to save some money and move to a warm place and find a honey 
that will stay true but i dont know if those exist
sometimes i think about the last time i got pissed
and flipped out
it must have been years 
i think i need to break out
and stop drying these tears
its ok to be over flowing with emotion
but there isnt a notion
that things will be the same
every girl runs some kinda game
if its to ruin you or run your shit
your know who to blame
men get taken 
nothings sacred
ive realized that people are fake
i dont believe anything they say
no one is trustworthy
axept crew
ill just be a ghost to those that are fake
and dont spend to much time in my existence
for instance,lets pretend 
that you and me are friends
what would you say to me
now
giving the situiation
but you and me are not allright
dogg you best belive i will fight 
for what i believe is right
and ill pass by in plane sight
and not mention your name outa spite
leave you in a puddle of sorrow tonight
when i come to take a life
of some one that you have held dear all along
then it will be sadness herd in your song
died in a plane crash that i suicide bombed
make it there safe
have a nice flight
the grass isnt always greener on the onther side
dont smoke no beeners but i dont confide
all locked up inside in a safe then a vault
its all your fault
i cant feel
deaf numb and blind is me more reel
i can see or hear
in just not anywhere near to the standard
dont hold me to anything
my word doenst mean shit
the only words i know are hit it and quit it
and sometimes those mean shit too
if you hit it and fall in love its the end of you
giveing our self to some one is no fun when they dont return at all
but being fake and runnin game is something that stands tall
cowards get hurt
they are late on the trigger
to put somthin to sleep
and move on quiker
to somethin unique
i need to sleep
its late at night
and i cant get my mind of the beat
im sore bored i just think about feet
and how many times ive walk on people
stomed them up and down infront of a church steeple
i dont care but i did theni dont
i am capable of careing but i wont
cant
never till the end
wont ever care
not now
not tomorrow
and never again
its a loseing battle
and my men were sent home in body bags
casualties of this war of love
now sent to the big guy above
if you believe in that shit
i do to an extent
good karma
is my philosofy
do good and good will come to you
and i got a secret ill tell you the truth
i havent been so nice
so this recent outbreak of lice
is from karma
hitting me back for all the hits ive done
i killed a squrril today
and i laughed and had fun
man

"event","life is got a way of fuckin you up when you think you got your shit on the right track
things where goin good and no one was smokin crack now life throws me a curve ball and it hits me smack
dab in the back i was attacked and grabbed by life like that
19 yrs old 12 years in the same house with the same family but it aint the same anymore
we moved and steve fucked the girl nextdoor
now there is a divorce that i have to be stong through
not a damn person gives a fuck about you
if i see you alone your getting fucked up dude
and while im at it run them pockets too!
you say that you raised me
but my dad youll never be
your a fucking skumbag named steve
and i try to belive that carma returns in life
but the only carma you deserve is to be cut with a knife
treating my family like shit and being a leech
i never what to hear your vokal cords speek
or you might get hit and not rember last week

i hate his fucking ass and all his friends and all his family or you might not want to call them that because family is there for you but his was no where to be found to help him move
wanting money outa me and ashleys college fund you aint gonna get it
ill use it to buy a gun and shoot your ass in the head

life sux at the moment because im living at my grandmas house and my mom and my sister are always in bad moods because of steve and the whole divorce thing and on top of that i have to start school in like 9 days and i still have no idea what i want to be in life
im lost dont know what to do
i wish that i had a time machine to go back to when i had good times 
last summer
smokin and writin rymes
whatchin jay play two girls at the same time
and i had fun and met a great girl
summer time was the best in the world
i need to go back to that fo sho
but i dont know we all go through crappy times in life and i guess this is one of them i have regrets of things that i wish i never had done 
being fucked up alot made me make some not clear choices
reality is hitting me hard and im skerd
i dont know if anything is for shure
i cant take it
i need simple
i need nice in my life
i neet to be held and cuddled though the night
i need to get my shit in order
i need to be there for my family
i need to same my money and not squander it
i need to use my skill and use them wisely
i need some thing or some one to to be the rock in my life
i dont need to smoke crack
i dont need to smoke weed
i dont need to get drunk
i dont need to get fucked up
i dont need drama
i dont need to please

I'm updating for Larry.

I'm not sure how his life has been lately since he doesn't talk to me very much. But it's okay becuase he's talking to me right now.

He went to Ricky's lacrosse game on Tuesday. Notre Dame won but Ricky didn't play. It was kind of crappy out and it rained a little.

He's not very happy about this weather. It's hot and he doesn't have air. But I was just informed that he has no hair, so his head is cool and breezy.

That's about it.
Have a great day :)"

issues around and things never said
feelings will be held till we both are dead
lets just put both our prides aside
and let the feelings take over and thrive
maybe its time to take one more chance
will you take my hand and give me this dance?
i am
and will always be
the nicest guy the world, you see
no matter the bad things that i do
i will be home to kiss you
good morning and tell you to have a nice day

jsut a poem

well i dont have much more to say
just give me a few days to think so to all who forgot what i say

well im tired and bored. come visit me any one please.
i think i have a good song idea for this entry.

We be movin' on up, (la,la,la,la,la) to the eastside 
where I can do my bid in a fat ass crib in the sky 
We be movin' on up, (la,la,la,la,la) to the eastside 
And it looks like we're gonna get some cream from the pie 
Right, right 

Got to take some time to clear my mind 
Don't want to think about the problems 
Want to leave the west head up to the east side 
The way is block I need to get by 
Now life is a rocky road, on my shoulders got to bear the load 
And if I'm wrong I'm letting you know to throw the negative 
thoughts overboard 

Hey mamma dry your teary eyes cause, 
I'm a do what I can do so we can get right by and- 
If I fall down I'm a get on up and make another try 
Up top I'm a find a place ain't gonna stop until, 
I see the pretty smile on your face 
So now you know, we be, we be, we be.... 

We be movin' on up, (la,la,la,la,la) to the eastside 
where I can do my bid in a fat ass crib in the sky 
We be movin' on up, (la,la,la,la,la) to the eastside 
And it looks like we're gonna get some cream from the pie 
Right, right 

You ain't fresh uh, uh, nah baby 
Everybody wanna be a superstar baby 
I ain't get the dough to act like I'm better than you 
I just got things to do, oh lala, oui oui, freak, freak 
you say you want trendy, you say you want sheek 
and honey dips, Rubbing on your money clip 
Hanging on your place, Boardwalk and park place 
Acting all new look at you how you're living 
Meanwhile your style is played out like racism 
Me I'm fresh out of love, it's quite tragic 
When all they want to do is inspect my gadget 
and change a superman to Clark Kent 
All for the sake of fake amusement 
She said ""What do you consider fun?"" 
You can get it, get it (consider yourself done) 

We be movin' on up, (la,la,la,la,la) to the eastside 
where I can do my bid in a fat ass crib in the sky 
We be movin' on up, (la,la,la,la,la) to the eastside 
And it looks like we're gonna get some cream from the pie 
Right, right 

Being trying these rocky roads for so long 
Still I can hold on 
I'm trying to make that door to move on 
Papa told me to stay strong 
Time has come to make that change 
Here comes the sun, there goes the rain 
Take that first step to tommorow 
Life may bring you joy or sorrow 
Now I'm dottin' my i's and I'm crossin' my t's 
I'm movin' up and takin' care of my biz 

We be movin' on up, (looks like we be movin up) to the eastside 
where I can do my bid in a fat ass crib in the sky 
We be movin' on up, (la,la,la,la,la) to the eastside 
And it looks like we're gonna get some cream from the pie 
Right, right

i used to go through all this shit when i was in middle school.

well i am a responsible kid mom.
i fit everythin i have to do in before cerfew.
figure this my day starts at 230 when schools out and i have two hours before work to do chores and have time to myself to hang out and then go to work and as sooon as work is done i have to be home for cerfew.i have no time.
all i ask for is time.
i work.
i got to scholl

i hate tears

all i want to do is be able to do what i want and not have to deal with my parents.they are serious buzz killers
they take the ballon that i have inflated with ahppyness and joy and they break it with the smallest pin.they smallest thing my parents can do makes my joy explode in a burst of air and rubber pieces.
well im tired as fuck and i want to dry off my eyes so here goes and emotional song.i have a right to be emotional and cry and be emo and shit because fuck ive been cruisin at a good pace and then the breaks get slammed and my head hits the windshield.


When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fucking special
But I 'm a creep
I 'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

She's running out again
She's running out
She run, run, run run
Run

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here


now i have to go slit my rists

"event","well let me enlighten you all, i tried to get rid of rachel my fuck buddy but it didnt work out as well as i had hoped.i wanted her to say well, never again can we do it but she said we still can and it makes it awkward because i know she still likes me and i dont like her that way but she still want to be with me.im a shitty guy.

then i smoked out.

then i sold some to some friends of mine and shawn threw a fit and said he cared about me and didnt want me to become a dealer but i was like i made 75 bucks in a day and still have free weed to smoke if i make all my money back.but i told him i wouldnt sell any more.

then amberr came over and i gave her a crapy card i had mad and she forgot it at shawns ,shows how much you care....
but i still like her but i dont want to use her for any thing all i wanna do is make out i miss makin out.and eatin pussy.no more fuckin rachel just makin out and eatin pussy.
but she gave me the sweetist thing in the world it was a jar with our picture on it and inside was a whole bunch of things that remind her of me like sayins i say things ive done its sweet.nicest of all ive ever gotten.

so i now dedicate a song to her 
your fav...

Hey lady--you got the love I need 
Maybe more than enough. 
Oh Darling... walk a while with me 
You've got so much... 

Many have I loved - Many times been bitten 
Many times I've gazed along the open road. 

Many times I've lied - Many times I've listened 
Many times I've wondered how much there is to know. 

Many dreams come true and some have silver linings 
I live for my dream and a pocketful of gold. 

Mellow is the man who knows what he's been missing 
Many many men can't see the open road. 

Many is a word that only leaves you guessing 
Guessing 'bout a thing you really ought to know, ooh! 
You really ought to know..."

heres a song today its a good one
brak-i love beans

Here's a lovely song about my favorite food!
Lima, lentil, soy and pinto
Navy, northern and garbonzo
Kidneys and frijoles negros
I love beans

I love beans, woo woo woo
I love beans, how about you?
High in fiber, low in fat
Hey I betcha didn't know that!

When I eat beans, I sit in my own little cloud
Nobody comes to visit me, in my little cloud
I don't know why, maybe it's 'cause I'm cuttin' muffins
Because....

I love beans, hey hey hey
I love beans EVERYDAY
Beans are an excellent source of protein
I love beans, dinky doo!"

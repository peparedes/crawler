I stole Torys history book today...Haha not like im actually going to use it though! ERr the bitch lady wouldnt give me one because i didnt come at lunch and i was like okay im sorry but i have a test and i dont have any notes and she told me oh well and that she was sorry and i was like uhh bitch step if you were that sorry you would give me a damn book...and then she turned into a one eyed flying purple people eater!! it sucked donkey balls. HAhaa today i did the old dance in tribute to mother mary! rebecca and i usta run around her house doing this dance mocking her mom (mother mary) it was a grand time...a happy time...a much simplier time...err i miss that!! Oh i also talked to the boy at my lunch table who always laughs at the things i say because he's always listening...well that and im really loud! haha We were talking about the slutiness of a girl that walked by...i didnt know her but she looked slutty and he was like yea but she has no ass so it sucks and i was like haha we had a very deep conversation...i forgot what else we talked about i wasnt so much paying attention. oooooh well.

Anyways...shes still mad i can tell...I wish i could make it better...i wish she would really listen to what i say instead of just hearing it! I do miss her and i wish we could still be friends. I dont see that happening tho...id love it...but i dont think shes so keen on the idea. She holds grudges and its hard for her to see past things sometimes i think. She gave Joyce and someone else i dont know who, i think its lauren my msn. They messaged me but didnt have anything  nice to say so i ignored them...im sick of explaining myself to them...they wouldnt believe it anyways so whats the point? it makes me tired, and sad. Joyce said BITCH then she said we're going ot kill you...and i was like thats nice...and i dont remember what lauren said...it was long...I almost cryed...I hate it here..."

I went to the galleria today, alone. Technically im not allowed to drive to the galleria, but i dont care. Im sick of rules. 
Err...i feel bad, i think a lot of people think i blow them off...Cody hasnt called since like friday and he usually calls everydya. I dont even know him, I dont even remember waht he looks like, haha i dont have much to say to him, but i wasnt blowing him off, just had other things to do. Also Kaleb and Blaine, well Blaine i was blowing off...but kaleb again i dont know him i didnt have much to say. Like these guys randomly ask for my number and then expect me to be like ooh yay i want to spend everyday with you!! let me clear my schedule so that i can hang out with someone who ive held a conversation with for maybe 5 minutes. silly me. not that i really have a life here in houston. Haha sorry i guess its just you dont intrigue me that much. In fact im not feeling intrigued by any of them at all, and i change my mind i dont feel bad if they think i blow them off, its not like we're friends, its not like i know them. However i do feel bad about the other cody...cody plant...he's in my BMM class, he's cool, i thought he was gay when i first met him...he's not though. He loves fashion.....The whole BMM class he's on like saksfifthavenue.com or somewhere like that. Its cute. Anyways he called me last night and wanted me to go to a party with him and his friend alex, i said okay but ill call you back, then i didnt feel like going so i didnt call back. he messaged me and was like ""thanks for calling back"" And i felt bad, because he's pretty cool. So i told him i was sorry. he wrote back and said it was okay because the party didnt happen anyways and said he'd call and tell me everything in a few. Then he never did. I hope he's not mad. 
My birthdays in a week yesterday. for my birthday i want to leave houston...or i want to be happy...or loved...or something. I dont persay want it for my birthday i just want it in general. but i dont think any of those things will be happening anytime soon. haha ooh well...

I went to the LC HC game...a lot of people remembered me and i remembered a lot of people it was cool...i should've stayed at LC...
I was really excited about going down to louisiana...i told dani, chastant, and brit i was coming and like a million people called me ""ahhh jenna you ahve to come see me!"" i really miss everyone in louisiana! I havent seen them (besides chastant) in ages! 
I really hate it here, I thought it would be great, boy oh boy was i wrong...i never fully think things threw i guess i feel something and then i just go with it.. I guess thats good for somethings...but i should probably have a balance between logically thinking and feeling...I get on a tangent about soemthing and then im like man that sounds awesome but i dont think it all the way threw! I always do stuff like that, i just pick little things to think about to get me threw the day and then i elaborate on it and it seems so great in my head but deep down i know itll never happen...as joyce would say this is my ""fantasy"" world...she always lectures me..."" you need to face reality....you live in a fantasy...that only leads to drugs and alcohol..."" Fantasy keeps my happy...and i know reality i just like my dreams better. If i didnt have my fantasy world, it would be harder for me to find something to wake up for. 
Everyone always tells me to set goals and go for them and then when i finally do they tear everything apart...until theres nothing left for me. They critisize until its nothing. I hate it, I dont every bring their stupid dreams down, i dont ever tell them they're not good enough, or that it dosent seem like it will ever happen...They never believe in me...
they say im depressed...
I drank a lot this weekend...all alone...you know your pathetic when....lol 
emily said something about my grades the other day, she dosent understand that i dont care....and she was like pff your grades arent good...umm they are considering i do absoultly no work. She dosent understand me, we're so different. 
I think im going to leave soon, i hope i can! I hope i can graduate this year. i think i can...i have to remember to go talk to the counselor about that."

Every day its something about scky alwasys like that...its sweet. When i first look at it im like aww i dont know too many guys who care that much...But then im like wait its Ivan.. haha Man oh man...haha

Yea not so much as good idea as i thought it was. I some how get hooked on this trunks back bumper and completely fucked up my jetta. Well atleast the exterior of the passanger. I started crying...then repark somewhere else. (Oh yea nothing happened to the truck thank god). Then i get out to look at it but i only glance at it and then i get back in my car and just sat there and cryed...Man oh man I was so sad, but i had to pull it together and get to class. So some how i managed to stop crying and get to class, although i did almost start to cry again on the way...but i made it threw the day, I pushed it aside and didnt think about it...So emily was like hey lets tell them someone else did it and didnt leave there info and i was like fuck yea! So we did and that seemed to be okay except i was still really bummed because my car is fucked, and if victor would find out the truth id be soo fucked...Er so then i came back home and i was going to go to harleys but joyce was in a stupid meeting and i was sad anyways so i just went to sleep. Then i was like yes i getta go see all my ozark friends. Which was cool most of them didnt know i lived in houston so they were shocked! It was good seeing Molly, and I meet some girls from cy-fair, be it may they arent really my type...but hey i have to know some girls right?

Im not passionate about things anymore, i dont know what i love, what i live for. I dont have anyone, I have no parents basically...I have victor but he's not much and has made it pretty clear that i am nothing to him. I dont have many friends, i have no one to wake up for, no one i can love and have them love me back. I miss that, im not even talking romantically at this point, i miss being loved in general, by anyone. And I hate so much that what victor once said could be true ""no one could ever love you"". I know it sounds stupid and that i shouldnt believe it but its been so long that sometimes i hear it repeated over and over in my head, and it starts to make since. 
Today i finally finished life as a house, i didnt think i would cry since i didnt get to watch it the whole way through in one sitting (The dvd player fucked up everytime id get into it) But i did....I hate crying in front of people, it makes me feel weak, insignificant, it gets me attention that i do not crave. I still remember the first time i saw that movie, it was the year it came out, im pretty sure i was in 7th or 8th grade. I was home, sick...and my mom had already seen it. I was watching it and when it was over i walked into the kitchen and said ""Omg he's so hot"" (or something of that manner, i was talking about hayden christianson.) my mom agreed but only thought he was cute when he cleaned up whereas i liked him scruffy...anyways i told her i loved the movie, she did too. I cryed, I told her i didnt want her to leave me, (this was not the first time id done this, when i was younger i remember doing it...i think it was after i watched the news or something or someones parent had died i dont remember that its kinda fuzzy) I cryed out of fear, she comforted me and told me she would not leave me for a long long time. She told me how much she loved me. She made it seem like everything would be okay...I felt so scared when she was gone, I was scared of everything, i couldnt sleep for days literally, i wouldnt eat, I was sketched out about everything, i hated being alone in a room, i felt like someone was going to kill me, I hated the dark...I couldnt face the reality she was gone...I remember going to see signs with emily and ms.hebert. Never in my life was i afraid of a horror movie, rebecca and i had watched them 24-7 since we were young, but i was scared in signs i kept looking around afraid all evil in the world was waiting to attack me. It all came back to me for a bit today, at first i was crying because of the movie, and then that memory of when i first saw it hit me and suddenly my tears were transformed from tears for the movie into tears for my mom. 
We saw Amanda's baby today. It was gorgeous, I usually think babys are hideous, but for some reason this one was cute. I can't imagine how shes going to do it...shes only 17, and has a boyfriend who acts like he's 10. I dont think he'll be around for long. It made me want a baby one day in some ways, but at the same time pushed me farther and farther away from that thought. I dont think i could do it. I dont think i would want to do it. But atleast i would have love...unconditional love. 
Err...i dont think im going to let anyone read my live journal that i know, i dont want anyone to feel sorry for me or think im some ""emo"" kid who thinks the worlds against me and that everything in my life is bad, because i dont....Im just stating what im feeling right now...what ive felt today, what ive felt in the past. I dont feel sorry for myself, and i dont want anyone to. If anyeone does read this sorry its long...i tryed to cut it short. Im having trouble getting what i feel down in words.
In conclusion to this long and not so invigorating entry, id like to dedicate my name (sex bomb jenna) to Harley because thats what he calls me and he's really awesome! :) Oh id also like to apologize for my gramatical mistakes for all you grammar nazi's...i didnt feel like being gramatically correct today, or for that matter ever really."

"event","so it's been a while cause i don't necissarily have time to log on to this. i usually have my hands full with school and then have like two minutes spared with greatest journal and stuff. so i've been lazy, and haven't really put in a dedication to finding many people here, so i think i'm gonna do that. well, off to the yellow brick road, if you read this julia aka springwarrior, don't forget about that serious make out session we had a while back. talk about something that turned into a choir orgy!

"event","Hey guys I know I have been gone for so long. I missed you all and hearing about you lives. Some of you I haven't talked to in awhile so here's an update: I went to Sacramento State for a semester before I was forced to come home due to stupid parents and money problems. I now attend Solano Community College on a 2 year degree in Business. Which I have about one more year to do. I hooked up with someone I never thought I would and now were engaged! We just got an apartment about a week ago and are going to live here until we get married sometime next year or maybe the year after. So here I am again in Vacaville. Anyway let me know about you!"

Basically I'm over the fight, and I'm for sure over you. And yeah for me because I finally let it go, and I wont ever miss you again!"

"event","So everything feels sort of surreal. I dont feel like I've graduated at all. I just keep thinking on mon. we will just go back to school and i will go into 3rd per and see Abel and get to hang out with Jimmy and Noelle. It's very sad that I will never do that anymore, its quite impossible. Besides the fact that Abel moved. I haven't even gone to one graduation party which sucks, but whats worse is I feel like I've wasted my whole weekend trying to be nice to lacey for her graduation, and she was a total jerk back. I guess I'm kind of regretting my decision to be the nice sister who does more for her sister then for herself. Either way i get screwed. But whatever soon I'll be out of Vacaville and away from this shit."

"event","Screw parents! The only reason why they came to my graduation was because I told them James's mom took us out to lunch, and she was going to see me and James at graduation. His mom has talked to me more lately then my own mother. wtf?! The last thing she told me was I shouldn't be a Psychologist. My whole life I've never known what I wanted to be until this year when I finally decided I wanted to council youth. Well she tells me I'm not going to be any good at it. Maybe that's true, but she doesn't have to conferm it. Aren't parents suppost to support you. They want me to be a lawier instead. I just don't understand them. So I'm sitting here in Cal Poly celebrating my sisters achievements. But has anyone mentioned me graduating high school? Oh yeah and I got a gold tassel last night for high honors and I told them that, to which they respond no. They seariously thought i was joking. Um no, I know I wasn't dreaming my far above 3.0 gpa for the past 4 years, I worked my ass of for that. Only to get a disaproval, they didn't even reconize that yes I do get good grades. That's it, I can't think about it anymore."

"event","I know this is going to sound really mean and that's not my intention at all. I just dont know how else to word it. Don't ""leave it up to me"" I can't do anything about anything lately and everything is bombarding me. Don't expect me to just come up to you and forgive you, for what? I dont think you even know...Honestly I was pretty pissed when i read yoru journal. From my point of view i dont think it was a little thing to get mad over, and I tried to tell you before. I dont know what to do anymore."

It's just really hard thinking one thing your whole life, and really truly respecting that thing. And then you go and find out that one thing that gave you hope, it was a lie..."

"event","So things are still a little weird lately. I just found out some bad stuff about my family last night, and things aren't going to be the same. But on the brighter side, Tiffany sang to me today! Yes! I went to visit her at work and offered to bring her home with me to make food for her because she had to stay at work late. But on the way to my house she sang to me! It was beautiful! It totally brightened up my crappy day. I had to wake up at 6 to be at work at 7 and I shouldn't have stayed up late last night. Oh well! The song was way worth it! I love you Tiffany!"

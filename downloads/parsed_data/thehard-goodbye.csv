"event","For the last few days I have been contemplating on whether I should keep posting on LJ.  I am pretty sure nobody reads mine.  This might be my last post.  I can not express myself like you guys can so I think that I will just quit.  I will come back in a week to decide to post or not.  Until then.....

May I never be complete.
May I never be content.
May I never be perfect.

I am so bored right now.  I should be doing homework but I am not.  I think that I am the worst of the procrastinators. (<----Probably not spelled right)  Schoolwork aside I would just like to say that this year is the worst because I feel that I have not made any progress with females.  I may appear that it is easy for me to talk to the opposite sex but for me it really is not.  Lets list the things that I have not done.  I have not went out on a date with a girl.  I have not kissed a girl. (ever) I have never had a girlfriend.  I still have not lost the V.  I really am not that concerned with the last one because I have had nobody special enough to share that with.  Scott once again you always verbalize what I can not.  I will never be as funny or as cute as the next guy.  I am just me and for some people that is not enough.  Also I would like to say that there are some girls in our class that I want to get to know as friends.  I have no altierior motive for a boy girl relationship.

The class officers had a meeting today.  I was ok.  The only thing that was said that i was really excited about was when Scott mentioned the senior video.  I would really like to contribute to this.  If I got to help make the video that would wreek of awsomeness.  I would feel like I would be giving something back to the class who I have shared these halls with for the past four years.  The FC football game is coming up and I am pretty excited about it.  I hope everything goes well and nobody gets in a fight.  BYE

"event","Why do I feel lost all of the sudden?  In each of my classes today i sort of felt lost and out of place.  I have no reason to feel this way.  The biggest fear that i have this year is that i will get to close to my friends this year.  I know that does not sound like a fear but to me it is.  After this school year i will probably never see any of your guys again.  Right now i feel empty.  I dont know what i will feel like when i graduate.  The only quote that i can think of that best describes me now is that one from Billy Madison. ""Some people just drift through life like lumps of crap.""  That me, a lump of CRAP.  I have absolutley no talent at all.  Thomas you have your politics.  Scott you have your writing.  Alex you have your photograhpy.  If you do not want to hang out with a dirty rotten half white half mexican loser tell me now so i will not mess up your life to."

"event","Yes i am back because of popular demand.  I am feeling alot better a week after my surgery.  My jaw is still a little stiff but i will pull through.  I am really excited about this upcoming party.  I was just as upset as you thomas, when i found out the party was not going to be held at chris' house.  But that is the past and we must look forward to the future.  August 5th will go down in history.

I just finished the directions so dont worry.  

Take care now bye bye then.

"event","Scott i just read your post and i feel the exact way you feel.  You tend to verbalize what i can not.  

My summer and my life has been in a rut for a long time, and I can't figure out why. I feel like my life is a puzzle and there is a big piece missing. I sometimes find myself feeling that other people look down on me because I can't give them what everybody else can. I sometimes feel uncomfortable, even around my closest friends, and I don't know why. I feel like...you know what, I don't know what I feel like. I have suddenly confused myself. The only cure for this, is to sleep it off and forget everything until tomorrow.

The biggest question I ask myself: God...what has happened to me?

I just copied and pasted what you wrote.  That is exactly what i feel.  I could not have been written any better. I really dont know why we are in this rut.  My confidence is slowly going away.  What is happening to the funny HEIL.  Why do i feel that i dont know any of my friends.  If any of you guys want to talk about it make sure you give me a holla.  

When are we going to have a meeting?

Thomas and I drove past Providence and found out that the new theatre has not even been started on.  Are they digging the ground with a spoon!!!!  


Big Poppa Pump is your hook-up holla if you hear me.

Have a nice day."

The I recieved news that i am going to have to get all of my molars taken out.  That is the highlight of the day.  The rest of the day i did nothing and was bored out of my mind.  

When are we going to get together and talk about this upcoming school year. Me Scott and Thomas need to get together and have coffee or something. 

Now can you dig that. SUCKA!!!!

Today i went to The Great Escape today.  The comic book store not the movie theatre.  I bought a reproduction of the orginal 10 spider-man comics.  Then i went to bestbuy and bought Mars Attacks.  

eh

"event","I saw fantastic four with thomas yesterday.  I thought that the movie was great but then again i like just about anything that goes from comics to movies. (I am a huge comics buff) I was wondering who is your favorite comic books hero? Or if you can not think of one think of a group.  If you can't do that then at least think of a power that you would like to have.  I sound like a huge comic book geek.  

Nothing really new going on in my life right now.  I do wish however that i was back at school strickly for social purposes.  I miss all of the quirks in our class.  I do not know what i am going to do when i get out of providence.  I am looking forward to senior year and dreading it at the same time.  Thats all for now.

"event","Man this quarter is going to blow big time.  I'm really disliking school right now, I have quite a hard and possibly very busy quarter ahead of me.  It just sucks so much. Robyn was here all last week so school wasn't so bad because I knew at the end of a shitty day she would be there to kiss and hold.  But now that she is gone this week has been depressing because I got really use to her being here and it was just so great, even if both were a little grumpy at times.  My head hurts and Josh disappeared earlier, and I have no idea where he went but I was hoping to get a start on our Graphics project, because I don't know much about Visual C++, well anything really. So I'm really lost.  Anyways, off to statistics, I hate that class... meh."

"event","I hate this feeling that I get when I know I should be doing something so I start working on one thing but then just get frustrated so do something else and just keep circling until I'm not working on anything just thinking about what I have to do. So here is my list: 
1st 
Rough Draft Due on Monday for C Lit (got to page 3 but have writer's    block plus what I have so far is quite possibly shit) 
2nd
CSE 326 Written Homework due on Wednesday, thought about starting it but looked at the assignment and just didn't want to. 
3rd
CSE 303 Programming Homework due Friday, I'm actually close to being done, need to clean up code
4th
CSE 303 Societal Implications paper due Friday, it has to be 2-3 pages about a topic in computer science, but with writer's block I can't work on 2 things
5th
Final Draft of C Lit paper due on Friday
6th
I have two finals on Saturday, German and CSE326 which sucks I've never had two on one day, and that is stressful thinking about it. 

That's all I can think of right now, but I actually tried to do something healthy today so I went for a jog and when I got back I was just very tired, which made me unmovtivated, hence the reason I got very little done besides watching parts of movies.  The CS stuff I did last night and into the early morning.  The only thing I did today was to get a shitty start on my C Lit paper. Now I'm just circling thorugh my list of 5 (I haven't starting thinkign about the 6th yet) and I'm just going a little crazy thinking why am I sitting her doing nothing. And I was talking to Ashlee which cut down on my boredom but she went to clean her kitchen and then logged off at some point, which sucks, because now I don't feel like doing anything and I'm just sitting here. Hence the reason why I decided to update my journal at least it gives me something to do right? I wish I could write like this in my paper, come up with something good, but it just all comes out wrong or I can't think of anything that would be anywhere near correct. Anyways that's all for now.  Until next time, meh..."

"event","I had a crazy dream.. I think I'm going to start using lj for dream recorder or something.  So of course as most dreams things start to  fade as soon as I wake up but this much I do remember.  Robyn and I had just recently been married and we were moving into what seemed to be a new house, may have been an apartment.  But as we were unpacking a couple ladies walk in with a baby, and I'm thinking, ""oh no, because I knew what they were going to ask"". So we decided that we would watch after the baby while she was was out of town for a few days.  And it turns out that this lady is Natalie Portman and before she leaves she kisses me on both cheeks and then on the lips(closed mouth) and gives me a hug.  Sometime after she leaves, wolves appear ( I don't know whether someone left the door open or what) but they could smell the baby, so I had to grab the baby and run around while I was being chased by friggin' wolves, and at some point that all stopped. Then turns out that the baby is like Stewie... it was kind of an evolution, this baby was probably no more than 18 months maybe and started babbling, which suprised me some but then started being able to walk, and after a short amount of time started talking.  This was all quit weird, because this kid claimed to hate me, but whenever was scared would cuddle up with me.  For now that's all I really remember I just wanted to get that down."

"event","I know I never update anymore. I guess that is just because the only times I used to update regularly is when I was feeling really shitty about life. And now I have my Robyn and life just isn't shitty anymore. It is amazing. I love her so much. I couldn't ask for a more carrying, beautiful, and all around wonderful girl. I'm so lucky to have her, and I miss her dearly.  Anyways, I just wanted to right down a few details of this crazy dream I had hoping that someone will read this and remind me of it for later. Well there was a pet shop where I was like walking around and this little kid and his mom were there. And she starting talking to me and I didn't know how she knew my name until I realized I was wearing a nametag and that my shirt had my name on it. (Not sure what the nametag was about) But she gives me some money and tells me to make the little boys day by letting him think that a stranger was nice enough to buy him a gift. After that there is all sorts of weird happens in the pet shop. Like a Croc eating the bunny the kid wanted and then pooping it out alive. And then the kid gets bit so the owner has to close up shop because she didn't have any signs warning of animals biting. Also part of my dream involved one of my 370 tas staying at my house which I'll go into more if someone brings this up or not in case I forget. Well I need to get to German. 
Auf Wiedersehen!"

More emotional turmoil or something along those lines. I guess I'm just more of a person to update when things are bad and I need to get things off my chest. But right now things are great so I had no reason to vent.  Well nothing much has been going on in my life. I went on a little road trip to Astoria, Oregon with Miles at some point. That was cool, it was nice to hang out with Miles. I've been engaged to the most wonderful girl in the world for over a month now. That is a pretty big piece of news in my life.  It is one of the greatest things to ever happen to me and Robyn makes me so very very happy. I love her so much and I'm not going back to school for a week and she is already gone, which makes me sad. It is hard seeing someone basically everyday, waking up to them being with you regularly then all of a sudden that is gone. She will be back Friday night my last night home, so that will be nice. I just love her so much and I feel like this year apart is going to be really hard. She is my everything, my strength, my love, she is a big part of my life and I hate being away from her. It is going to be hard on both of us. (hehe hard on)  But we'll make it, we have to so that we can someday spend the rest of our lives together. I just hope that our kids are as cute as Jayden. I love that kid he is such a cutie. Well I think that is about it for now. I love my Robyn, my wonderful fiance, damn I'm a lucky guy... yup yup :) Until next time, I'm naked around you."

"event","Mmmm... Stargate Sg-1 and Stargate Atlantis.  These two shows are in fact the mad note. What sucks is that Jack is gone and the new General is kind of balls.  But Lt. Colonel Mitchell (Ben Browder) is awesome I love that guy.  He is so cool and he is basically still John from Farscape.  That and they have Claudia Black on there for a while and she is a hottie... oh yeah.  So that makes me happy.  That and Altantis has some ties back to Earth now, so that is cool. But the loss of Lt. Ford (Rainbow Sun Francks) is sad. He was a cool character, but I'm sure he'll pop up from time to time. Anyways until next week I'll await that which is Stargate.  Until next time, make it long, hard, short, soft."

Just a little tid-bit that is pretty amazing Robyn jumped from 6.8 to 11.8 since November 2004. That is impressive when you are talking about .txt files. Until next time, you stay classy San Diego."

"event","Why does there have to be so much pressure to get a job? Why can't I just sit back and relax after 8 months of constant hell of school? Where every minute you are worrying about how your grades are going to turn out, because if you don't do well you won't get into the program you are looking to get into and then once you are in you have even more pressure to not drop your grades down too low so as to lose your ability to get a degree so that you can go off and get a career that most likely you are going to hate until the day you retire, then you will be too old to do anything that you'll actually enjoy.  Is that what I have to look forward to? Sounds fucking wonderful. Meh. But no I can't relax, if I want to have fun this summer I need to get a job, where I will work and most likely be too tired to do anything after work, so maybe I'll have the weekends off, is that when I have the fun to spend all the money I made that week with my minimum wage job, just to repeat it.. oh what fun that is. I know I'm being too dramatic, but damn I hate the fact that you have to work to make money, I wish you could do whatever you wanted without currency and everyone just did there part. If that was the case, hell I would go work some shitty job, as long as I could have my big screen tv, awesome computer, with fast porno loading speeds, and  a great wife to come home too. But we aren't that lucky.  I may have some of those things in my future, but certainly not all.   Fucking jobs... meh... don't want one, and don't necessarily need one... whatever.."

"event","Last weekend was pretty awesome, you can read Robyn's livejournal if you want to know the details.  I'm just amazed, everytime I see Robyn I truly fall more in love with her. Is that possible? Once I think that I'm as in love as I'll ever be something so small happens that makes me love her that much more.  It could just be a small moment in time where we're actually together; a kiss, a smile, a conversation, it doesn't matter what it is, but it hits me that I had just fallen more in love.  Love is a crazy thing it makes you forget about everything else, it makes the world a better place, it brings you to a state of happiness that you never thought you could reach.  That's why losing love is so hard and being away from the one you love is equally as hard.  I miss my Robyn beyond belief.  When I'm with her I don't have a care in the world, my life is perfect, being away from her is hell.  But it is that hell that makes the heaven when I am with her again.  A fitting description since she is an angel.  My guardian angel and my love for the rest of time.  I hope everyone finds true love, because it is amazing.  It makes you forget about the rest of attractive people out there, because no matter how attractive the girl is I find that she can't match up to the beauty, wonder, and greatness of my Robyn.  I love that, because other girls show me how lucky I am to have her. Well I should get back to working on my paper for Philosophy.  I know most of you don't care about what I said here because it is all lovey-dovey, but I just like to profess how I feel and isn't that what a journal's for? Yup yup :) Until next time, Robyn will always have my love, now and forever :)"

"event","Lets see it has been a while I guess.  Well I'm not going to describe my Spring break because you can check my Robyn's lj for the details of that.  All I can say is it was absolutely amazing to be with her :) I love that girl with all my heart and always will.  So my quarter ended well.  I got a 3.7 in Mechanical Engineering 231, a 4.0 in Psych 101, a 4.0 in Architecture 151, and a 3.8 in my Math 308 class. So it was pretty excited my cumm. gpa is now a 3.7 which has me excited.  So I did get offered a majors only Computer Sciene and Engineering (CSE) class. It is CSE 341 Programming languages.  We are using old ass (well maybe not old but primitive) languages.  They are basically functional and stupid, but the class should be alright. I'm also in Intro to Philosophy, which I think might suck because my graduate student teacher seems to like to push his ideas onto others. Next there is Psych 210 which is Human Sexuality which seems pretty interesting, I watched a bunch of people performing vaginal and oral sex along with masturbation yesterday in class. Then I have Architecture 251 Non-Western Arch, which for not being a Architecture major this is my 3rd class in that department but mostly because they are easy 3 credit classes. Well that's my quarter and that's all I got to say about that. Until next time,(What you do again last summer?), I was on Tatooine fighting Tuskan raiders, (How many of them did you kill), Like 50 of 'em, they kidnapped my mom, what the heck would you do in a situation like that?, (What kind of weapon did you use?), a freakin' lightsaber, whatdoya think!"

"event","Yes it is time for the much anticipated finals week (hits button to light up applause sign).  But seriously I hate this week, it is packing all the stress of the quarter into 5 days, not to mention the days before hand studying if you have early finals.  The way classes are made to be purely test based in the grading, this test can literally make or break your grade. It doesn't matter if you have been kicking ass all quarter (although it helps) one bad performance and your 4.0 turns into a 3.0 or lower. It is a sad fact of college that I think all of us students have to go through, but what can you do.  My finals aren't actually looking ot be too bad.  My math teacher pretty much has given us exactly what our final will look like, just like he did with the math midterm that I received a 96 out of 100 on. So that should be fine. My Mechanical Engineering class worries me a little because I hate the lecture part of that class, and finally Psychology which I have got a 100% or better on the last 3 tests shouldn't be a problem at all. It just sucks because right now I'm feeling kind of sick and that is never a good feeling.

         Last night I went to a Focus Group for an activity called Dawg Daze her at the UW, something I wasn't supposed to go to but Tiffany dragged me too. But it was cool to talk amongst a group even they were all Freshman or 1st year students here that transfered from another school.  I did get a 20 dollar gift card for the UW bookstore, although I can not use it to buy textbooks. How ironic. Anyways I'll be watching Jim Gaffigan on Friday hopefully, second time I will have gotten to see him this quarter. Oh and Dane Cook is going to be here April 4, 12 dollars for Students and 24 for non-students.  It is pretty bad ass, but I should probably buy my tickets before I end up missing out.  That's about it for now I believe, oh and I still miss Robyn, I can't write a post without saying that, that's how I feel.  I don't give a damn if people think I'm needy or clingy, I'm just a very affectionate person so deal with it, and don't give me shit for saying that I miss her, because put yourself in our shoes.  We are 300 miles away from each other and we are very cuddly people so it is hard, and I don't need your sympathy or do I need a lecture about being in a long distance relationship, because I knew what I was getting into. But I still have the right to say I miss her and I love her with all my heart because she is my angel. The previous statements are not specifically directed at anyone I just want to get that out there.  Until next time, you know you do you kill me well, you like it too and I can tell, you never stop until, my final breath is gone."

"event","So I don't know what it is that gets me on this path, but it always seems to go about the same way.  First of all I'm like lets mess around, play Final Fantasy 7 all day (or something of that nature) then I think wait why do I keep putting of my homework. Then I realize I don't know how to do this, or I don't want to do this.  So then I mess around some more, let's watch Bad Santa.  Then I think now I'm getting stressed because I'm doing something besides homework.  That fucking guilty feeling you get even though you know there will be plenty of time to get your homework done but school has turned you into a homework machine, you must always be studying you can never have fun without feeling like shit for doing it. That's when I get to the point where I need my Robyn.  That's all I can think about... I want to talk to my Robyn.  I get distracted here and there, doing homework, playing a game, doing something but it always comes back.  Robyn is having fun right now, well at least I hope, but all I can think is, I wish she would come home.  But that isn't fair of me to think she has to have fun too, she has a life and I don't want her to feel bad that she wasn't here for me (don't feel bad hun) because she can't be by my side every step of the way.  She has already been there so much and I appreciate everything she does for me and I love her very much.  I just never know what to do, I feel so lost, like I have no one.... if Kylan was here I'd talk to him, but he is home this weekend... lucky me.... *sighs* Well I probably should go to bed soon... but I can't get myself to because there it is again, I need my Robyn...."

"event","Well on Friday after class I went to Subway, then to Trader Joe's with Kylan.  We were on our way to Safeway but we stopped by the Walgreens across the street first and ended up buying a bunch of 75% off Valentine's day stuff. Then I went over Safeway and bought some roses for Robyn.  I came back to my room and set up a little table with stuff from Walgreens and the floors, and had a little, ""I love u"" thing on my bulletin board :)  Then I played some Final Fantasy 7 in Kylan's room, until around 11:20ish or so Robyn called asking for directions to my dorm.  So when they got here I introduced Robyn and Brittany and we talked to Kylan a bit, and then we just held each other and enjoyed each others company :) 

Saturday morning, got up and had some cereal, lounged around then walked down to the U-Village and walked around the village.  Went over to Office Depot so I could buy a PCMCIA USB 2.0 card. After that we went over to Johnny Rockets for lunch, it is a pretty cool 50's style diner and our burgers were damn good. After that walked back to the dorm.  We were both kind of tired so we watched some Family guy and ended up falling asleep. Around 7 we went bowling with Kylan and Brittany.  That was pretty fun, and after bowling Robyn played some Dance Dance, and then Kylan and I did a versus match.  Kylan sucked real bad and was being silly about it.  After bowling Robyn and I went to IHOP alone because Kylan and Brittany are losers.  My omelette was very good, but I did make a bear using my pancakes, syrup, and a couple banana slices from Robyn's banana pancakes.  Then we came back here and just hung out talking to Kylan and Brittany for a while, because they were hanging out in Kylan's room.  Then we came back to my room and kissed and had fun :) 

Sunday morning woke up around 11 or so and we both showered. Around 3 Robyn's mom and her friend Karen showed up so that we could go see Phantom of the Opera in Bellevue. The movie was so incredible. I already had fallen in love with the music years ago and it was just so well done :)  Oh and Christine was a hottie, I checked it out and she is a year younger than me, that is cwazy :P Anyways, after the movie went to Karen's place for a little while then went to a Italian restaurant.  Not sure what it was called but it is North of UW in Shoreline.  We ate there with Karen's son and wife.  After dinner went back to Karen's and everyone sat around telling funny family stories of injuries.  Well I couldn't speak up because people were going on and on, so I just listened but it was nice.  Close to 11 we got back to the dorm when Karen's son and his wife dropped us off. We then watched The Notebook.  It was sad movie so Robyn and I both ended up crying and then started crying more because we were going to miss each other and it is always sad to know that we have to be apart again.  It was kind of cute us both crying but after a while we started laughing again, especially after I said, ""You make me happy"" while I was crying.  We just both started giggling :) Then we fell asleep pretty late.

Woke up this morning at 8:45 or 9 and just kissed and cuddled and had to say goodbye around 10.  I felt like an idiot because I forgot my husky card so was locked out of Mercer.  So I had to go to the Terry front desk to get a temporary key card.  Then I pretty much sat around and playing FFVII, and then Robyn got home and I talked to her for a while before she had to leave for rehearsel.  I already miss her.  She left this morning but it seems like we've been apart for months and it sucks, I hate being apart. But I know since I miss her and since it hurts so much that I am truly in love with her always and forever. That makes me so happy :) *hugs and kisses for my Robyn* So overall I had an incredible weekend.
Until next time, long distance relationships aren't for everyone, but Robyn and I will make it :)"

"event","So lets see, not a whole lot is going on in my life. But a very good thing was this past weekend.  I got to see my Robyn :) Friday night flew over to Spokane kind of late, got picked up by my Robyn :) When we got to her place and she had gotten me a cute doggie (that I now sleep with), sparkling cider, a rose, and a card. We then had some Ice Cream and watched TV. Kind of cuddled and then went to bed at some point :)  

Saturday, kind of just lounged about, didn't get out of bed for a really long time. We went over to the EWU PUB, had lunch and then went to the computer lab.  I got a free flippin' smoothie from Freshens.  It was awesome :) After that went back to the apartment and fooled around a bit ;)  Then we went to see Nude with Violin.  It was kind of weird but it was pretty good. Came back home had some dinner and lounged about some more. 

Sunday, of course didn't get out of bed for a long time. Tried doing homework.  Stayed up really late watching movies and stuff :) 

Monday, lounged about enjoying each others company, had a chance for a flight cancelation, that I wanted so I could stay with my Robyn longer, but ended up flying out. It was great being with her, I enjoy holding her and being in her company so much. I miss her already :(

Well this week has been boring, nothing to talk about. Until next time, I'm going to vote for Pedro Sanchez, who do ya think!"

"event","So I'm done with my first week of school. It looks like my teacher's aren't going to suck really bad this quarter.  Well except my math professor he looks like he is going to suck real bad. My mechanical engineering (me) class which is solid-modeling (CAD) looks pretty sweet the program we are using is pretty cool.  Psychology 101 looks really interesting, I have a really great teacher that I think really loves what she does and I have that class with Tiffany (Kylan's girlfriend) so I also get to know her better and that is awesome. Architecture is a two part series, I took the first part and it is boring as hell and has proven to not have changed, my professor is pretty good I guess so that is good. I only get homework in Math and ME class so that cuts down on time I have to worry about doing stuff, although there is quite a bit of reading I need to do for classes. 

I am really looking forward to flying over to seeing Robyn on Friday and staying for the 3 day weekend. It is going to be a lot of fun. I'm flying over with Bryan, but coming back a little later than he is.  I'm so glad I get to see her because I sure do miss her a lot. The last couple nights have consisted of hours upon hours on the phone. Which was really cool.  So I went to bed around 2:30 this morning and I'm off in sleep land when I hear this weird noise, and I couldn't even comprehend what it was for a bit but then I realized it was a fire alarm at 4 in the morning. I wasn't thinking because I was still partially asleep, so since  I sleep nakie I had to throw on something so without thinking I put on a t-shirt and shorts and luckily grabed my keys and sweatshirt in my sleepy stupor. We get outside and I realize then that I have to pee really bad, so I ask one of the RA's if there is somewhere I can go to use the bathroom (We don't have access to Terry after 11 even if I did remember my student card) and he tells me to hold it and I'm thinking, ""Well fuck you"". Anyways so I hold it for a long time, and I don't see Bryan for a while because he went to a different meeting spot.  A whole group of us are huddled in the Steven's Court garages, which is no warmer than stadning in the outside mix of light snow and rain. Finally I see Bryan walk by the entrance and head out with him.  I was shivering pretty much uncontrolablly and at some point the firefighters who had come to the building come out and one of them says, ""This didn't have to happen,"" while holding something up.  It looked like a playing card, so I was thinking what the hell. I had no idea what caused the alarm but it sucked really bad, and I was so cold when I came inside and used the bathroom.  Then sleeping didn't happen right away because my eyes were really dried out by the cold and my face was cold. Anyways, I just woke up a bit ago and now I'm off to do some stuff. Until next time, early morning fire alarms suck real bad!"

"event","Okay I'm going to start with the holidays because frankly break is just a blur to me now but I kind of remember the holidays, plus I can copy and paste from Robyn's livejournal ;)

Christmas Eve, woke up and got ready and went to Robyn's house. Got there a little after Ted and Megan.  We had dinner and then opened gifts. It was fun. Robyn got me I, Robot and a keychain with her picture in it and I got a Family Guy blanket from their family.  It was nice to spend time with her family and watch Jayden play.  He is such a cutie.  Robyn and I got him a Spongebob :)  I got Robyn some fuzzy pink slippers  from Payless :)  After Robyn's place I went up to my Grandpa's where I ate again and opened more gifts.  Well actually my Grandpa gave me 20 dollars and my Uncle gave me a 20 dollar gift card for Wal*mart.  My grandpa's was kind of hectic because of my cousin's kids but it was nice.  We then went home for a while then off to church for midnight mass.  When I got home I felt guilty for not writing Robyn a poem (I'm big on that) So I stayed up until 3:30 writing a poem and making it look really nice in Photoshop. I went to bed only to be awaken at 7:40. I was grumpy to say the least :P

This brings me to Christmas Day, woke up and opened presents, I got some stuff, that I don't remember well enough to list, but it was nice. Around noonish or so Robyn showed up at the house with a plate of brownies she made for the family. They were very good. Anyway, Robyn and I rode in my car and the rest of my fam was in their car because our car isn't big enough for six. The road's were kind of crappy but we made it to my  grandma's house. Robyn really liked my grandma and it isn't too suprising because she is awesomely sweet :) We had some lasagna and lounged about for the rest of the day and opened gifts. We watched ELF at one point which if it wasn't Will Ferrell probably would have sucked. Then Robyn, my parents, and I  stayed up until midnight watching The Sound Of Music. My parents were nodding off most of the time.

The 26th, Sunday, Robyn and I slept in until 9ish. The rest of the family was getting ready to head off to church. About noon Robyn and I got out of our pjs and into some real clothes. :) The rest of my family was showing up so she slowly met my family. My sister Courtney's boyfriend Brian showed at some time. We started after some food playing ""Stinky Christmas"" which is a tradition of ours. It was so much fun to have Robyn there. :) I stole 90's Trival Pursuit for Robyn and we played it that night. We lost though. We then drove back to my place but it was late, foggy, and a little icy, so Robyn stayed at my house that night.

The 27th. Robyn left around 12:30 or 1. Just kind of messed around all day. Talked to Robyn online for a little bit. 

The 28th I went to Miles's house, he showed me a few things on his computer (Kingdon Hearts 2 trailers) and we played a quick game of Lord of the Rings Monopoly and then headed to Robyn's. We went to Subway, and then to the Candy Store which is now out of business. We then went to Wal*Mart Miles bought King Arthur and I got Resident Evil 2. We then went to Robyn's place and played 90's TP. Gal and Robyn won.  Gal left and the Robyn, Miles, and I played some LOTR Monopoly. I won because I rule. We then went to Taco Bell for some tacos.  Miles and I then left because Miles had to be up early for work in the morning.

The 29th, I drove Miles to work early and stopped by Robyn's house. I got there at about 7:30. I walked into her room and kissed her on the cheek and crawled into bed with her. We cuddled for a while so I could warm up a little. We then decided to go to breakfast, so we went down to Arby's. After breakfast we went back to Robyn's house and started watching I, Robot, but I started falling asleep so we took a little nap. About 2:30 we got up so we could get Miles from work. Then we went to the candy store. It was snowing alot so when we were all back at the house Robyn's dad told me that me and Miles were staying the night because it was too bad to drive. So we watched King Arthur, and Resident Evil: Apocolypse. Miles went to bed a little early because again he had to work early. He slept in Robyn's room. Robyn and I slept on the couch and chair.

The 30th, Miles and I left Robyn's house at 6:20 or so in the morning. I called Robyn when I got home, and just kind of slept a whole lot and didn't do much the rest of the day.

The 31st, I went to Robyn's to take her to Kylan's house for his sledding party. Robyn got to meet Kylan's gf Tiffany which was cool. We didn't start sledding until Jacqui and Bryan got there.  Robyn didn't want to go down because she is a girl :P But she finally did after a while. Kylan's dad gets this idea to take a piece of carpet, coat it with kerosine, and light it on fire in the middle of the top part of the run.  The foolishness of the drunk. But it was fun. This drunk neighbor of Kylan's keeps going down face first through the fire and catches his glove on fire.  It was pretty sweet. Robyn finally went down once the fire was out by herself.  Then she went down with me. There were fireworks as usually I got hit in the eye with some debris and jammed my finger. At midnight I kissed my Robyn and there were fireworks and some snow fighting between the guys and myself. The drunk people decided to light off the huge fire work balls that belong in a tube, down the sledding hill, that was dangerous.

The 1st, about 1am, we all play Clue. Bryan won that bastard! Then we all went to bed, or tried at least. Robyn and I were on the fold out bed while Jacqui and Bryan were on the air mattress on the floor. I couldn't stop giggling, because Jacqui kept talking to Bryan in this whiny tone. It was fun though.  Robyn and I didn't sleep well because our stomachs hurt. We all finally got out of bed around 11 or so. After brunch, Robyn and I left. Got stuck in the ditch because of some little kid on his damn snow mobile. Some lady with a Jeep was nice enough to give us a pull out. I dropped Robyn off and I went home to hang out with my family.  Had some pizza, watched football, and played Who Wants to Be a Millionare. Oh and today marks 5 months for Robyn and myself! Damn I love her! She is great! *big hugs and kisses for Robyn*

The 2nd woke up finished up packing and went Arby's for breakfast with my family. Said my goodbyes after breakfast and my dad dropped me off at Robyns around 12:30. Got to Cheney and did some shopping and ate at Subway. Robyn dropped me off at the airport at 6:45-7ish.  Kissed a bit in the terminal ;)  Got on the plane which for once was on time.  When Bryan and I got to Seatac we went to the bus stop. Got there at like 8:40, bus was supposed to be there at 8:48, never showed up. So we waited, the next bus was supposed to be there at 9:17 didn't show up until like 9:35 and there were a lot of people getting on.  There were some crazy people in the back of the bus who were pissed off about the amount of people getting on. I emet some cute girls on the bus that live on Bryan's floor here in Mercer, Bryan and I were seperated on the bus for a while, but he made his way to where I was after a bit.  Got downtown and transfered busses and got back here.  Got back to my room around 11ish. Went to bed about 1 after watching Star Trek. Didn't sleep well because of my throat and sickness. 

Today, woke up and walked with Bryan to Math.  Math seems boring so that sucked.  Then walked with Bryan up to my Mechanical Engineering class. It is a CAD class and seems like it should be cool. Bryan has already taken it, and he liked it. Then I had Psych, which was entertaining, she showed some film clips and Tiffany found me and sat with me so that was cool.  I then headed to 1101 and got some Pork Yakisoba and headed to my room.  That gets me here.  I'm talking to my Robyn now. 

Until next time, I should never not update again!"

"event","Let's see not a whole lot to report.  I'm done with my finals.  They all went fairly well. I got a 93/100 on my Math Final which gives me a 3.8 in Calc 3.  Um... didn't do well on my physics final I got a 90/150 so we'll see what my grade turns out being in there. My linguistics final was quite a bit easier than I thought it would be, but I made some mistakes.  Who knows.  I'm just waiting for grades which should be posted on Wednesday. 

On Thursday I went to the airport with Bryan.  Saw about a half an hour before boarding that there was a Weather Advisory on my flight.  Which meant they were going to fly over to Spokane but if it was too foggy they would turn around and come right back to Seattle.  It was damn foggy when we landed and the landing was a little rough but we made it. Got picked up by Robyn and my dad. It was nice to see them.  Came home and Robyn spent the night. We lounged around Thursday night watching Spongebob.  Then we did the same on Friday and watched Finding Nemo. Then we went to town walked around Wal-mart.  Bought Jayden (Robyn's nephew) a Spongebob pillow buddy. Then went to Payless to look at fuzzy pink slippers and then headed to Subway for dinner.  Then we went over to the park for a walk around, and then to Super 1.  We got some drinks and some Cream Cheese Cinnamon rolls and sat down for a while.  Then we went up to her house to see Jayden before he went to bed.  He was cute as always.  Robyn says to Jayden, ""You're nakie"" , and he says sternly, ""No I'm not!"". It was cute :) After a while, Robyn got a call from her brother about a kitty that his wife found.  So we went over there and picked the poor thing up.  We named it Napoleon, but it turns out it is a girl so it is now named Deb.  Well we just hung around for a while and by hung around you know what I mean ;)  Then at some point I went home. 

Saturday I just kind of screwed around in the morning didn't do much, around 4:30 I stopped by Robyn's place then we headed to Jacqui's place for a game/movie kind of night thing. Ian, Kylan, Bryan, Jacqui, and Jacqui's siblings were there. When we first got there had some pizza and pop.  Cuddled with Robyn watching movies and played some pool and airhockey.  It was fun.  Afterwards went to Wal*mart with Kylan. Picked some things up. Went up to the Hospital to give Robyn's mom a pop we bought her.  Robyn ends up taking her mom's keys with us so as soon as we get to her place we have to turn around and go back :P  But then we said our goodbye's and I headed home after a little while. 

Sunday morning went to church and then to Wal*mart with my mom and sister. Then kind of lounged about, didn't do a whole lot, got tired at 9:30 read an e-mail from Robyn saying she wouldn't be online until later. Decided to lay down for a bit but was really tired so didn't wake up until 3 in the morning and felt bad because I really wanted to talk to my Robyn.  Well went back to sleep after e-mailing her.  

Today, woke up e-mailed Robyn then went to town and did some Christmas shopping. That was about it.  Came home after a stop by Burger King for lunch.  Played some Commandos 2 and now I'm talking to my Robyn.  Until next time, What's the capitol of Thailand? Bangkok.  What's the capitol of your mom? Mycock."

"event","Lets see I'm going to skip past the boring part of my vacation.  Well I got to see my family and that was nice.  So on Saturday Robyn picked me up around 1 she was supposed to come at 2 so it was awesome to see her early :) So we went to Spokane stopped at the mall and bought our Spongebob movie tickets.  We had some time to kill so we walked around the mall. Then when it was time we went into the movie. It was awesome it made me laugh really hard at points.  After the show we were going to go to Cyrus O'Learys but they were full.  So we ate at Willow Springs in Cheney.  Then we went to pick up some stuff for breakfast. We then went to her Apartment and of course we were making out a lot.  Watched Drive Me Crazy and some Futurama.  Then Robyn gave me a back massage before bed :D 

Today woke up to kissing and then made Robyn and myself some breakfast :) We just lounged about the apartment cuddling and kissing.  Around 5, Robyn made dinner.  After dinner we were cuddling and we both got kind of sad because we didn't want to be apart.  I cried a little because I was really upset.  Around 6 we left to the airport.  When we got to the airport we saw Bryan and Jacqui.  We sat in the aiport for a while just kissing and giggling :) It was so nice.  Parting kind of sucked but the giggling helped it to be easier, being happy and all :) So Bryan and I were on the same flight so we talked and rode the bus back to the dorm together.  Stopped by Terry to buy some stuff on the way back :) Now I'm back here missing Robyn and watching Family Guy.  Until next time, it is hard to leave the ones you love."

"event","So yeah.... I've been kind of off my game healthwise for a while.  Especially with the lack of sleep the last few nights.  Have a doctor's appointment in Colville on Friday, hopefully some things will be cleared up, and I'll start feeling better *crosses fingers* Well other than that I had a Physics midterm a while back got a 79 out of 100 could have easily had a 94, changed a three part (15pt) multiple choice question to the wrong answers when I had them right in the first place *sigh* Um, had a Linguistics midterm that I haven't gotten back yet, but I should score well on it.  Also had a Math Midterm that I got a 41.5 out of 50 on but since the class as a whole did shitty on it so my teacher added 4 pts to everyone's score so I got a 45.5 out of 50 which is nice.  That's about it for my college life.  I get to fly home tomorrow! I get to see my Robyn! That airport movie scene running to each other and meeting each other with a long drawn out kiss, OH YES, THAT'S WHAT I WANT! That should be nice, I love kissing my Robyn and holding her :) I get to see Miles, he is celebrating Thanksgiving with my family because his work sucks. But that is cool I miss Miles and I get to spend time with him and my family.  I also get to spend Saturday and Sunday with Robyn! You know what that means, lots of kissing and Spongebob the Movie! Wheee! I'm so excited! I love Robyn! *big hugs and kisses for Robyn* Until next time, you would kill for this just a little bit."

"event","I love Robyn! I love her, I love her, and oh yeah I love her! :) So yeah, did I mention that I love Robyn? ;) Anyways Robyn was here this past weekend and it was so awesome! She got her around 6:30ish on Friday.  I had a Goatee when she got here, but decided to shave it for practical purposes ;)  Although she thought it looked good and made me look older.  I kind of liked it, too.  I'll probably grow it back.  So first of all we went up to 1101 and had some salads. So what did we do after that... um well we hadn't seen each other in a month and we are great kissers, so of course we watched a movie (if you didn't get it we made out before watching the movie) ;) So we watched Jersey Girl and cuddled :) After Jersey Girl we watched Family Guy at some point and started watching Napoleon Dynamite, but Robyn was nodding off making weird noises.  So we decided to go to bed, but not before a whole lot of kissing, so we actually didn't get to sleep until 5, hehe :) 

So on Saturday when we got out of bed, we went for a stroll around campus, had some lunch, walked up and down the Ave.  We stopped by a Gargoyle shop which was cool. Came back to the room for more kissing, and we were both very tired. So called Bryan asked if he wanted to go to IHOP. Then we laid down for a nap and cuddled which was really nice. So when we got up went with Bryan to IHOP.  The food was good, and it was nice hanging out with Bryan. Came back to the room for more kissing and listening to music and then went to bed. 

Sunday morning woke up really early, and just laid in bed until liike noonish just being lazy, kissing, and enjoying each other's company. Went up and ate some food around 2:30 and then came back to do some homework. Homework didn't happen, Robyn is too distracting so we just kissed some more :) Robyn left around 8ish, when Logan came and picked her up. I had given her some lovely marks for Logan to give her crap about.  What can I say we were making out like crazy this weekend, but can you blame us :) When Robyn left it was really hard, I gave her a big hug and a last kiss, and started walking away and I just felt crushed. I tried to stay strong until I got to my room and I just cried for 5 minutes.  I just love her so very much and her being her was so great I didn't want it to end.  I know I get to see her in a couple weeks, but it is hard being apart from the love of your life.  

This weekend made me realize that I am totally in love with Robyn, I was pretty sure before, but now there is no doubt in my mind that we were meant to be together.  I've said it before (maybe not on here) but I know that I will someday marry my Robyn, because she is the source of my happiness, a beautiful girl, a wonderful kisser ;), and is everything I could ever ask for in a girlfriend :)  I am so thankful that she is a part of my life and that I got to be with her this weekend :) I'm a lucky guy, the luckiest that I know :)  Well that's about it, oh and I love you Robyn, you are my Princess now and forever :) Until next time, love is the greatest source of happiness"

"event","So 3 months ago today Robyn and I started going out! Damn I love her to pieces and fall more in love with her everyday. You better believe that I've been missing her so very very much.  But I get to see her this weekend! I'm so very very happy, so I hope Logan doesn't cancel on her because I would be very sad.  So hopefully that doesn't happen. Other that haven't been up to much at all.  Just a whole lot of nothing. I had some free Dick's tonight.. but I had to go to a meeting, that's where they get you. Well I guess Friday, Kylan and I had dinner together with this hot girl he likes Tiffany. She is really nice and cool. She is very beautiful so go Kylan. Then Kylan and I went Rollerskating at the IMA and then went to the HUB to bowl. We also played some air hockey which was fun. Then went to his room and watched Tommy Boy. Saturday went to a shitty haunted house with Kylan, Bryan and Jacqui.  It is in one of the Dorms (Hansee) on campus. Bryan and I went last year and it was pretty much the same. Okay now that was about it, otherwise I just sat around doing homework. Like Halloween only left my room to use the bathroom and eat.  Otherwise did homework and watched Men in Black, and the Nightmare Before Christmas. Well I LOVE YOU ROBYN! You are the greatest girlfriend ever, you are so cute, cuddly and wonderful. You are now and shall always be my angel. Oh yeah, I'm just going to say this because I'm excited about it, I can't wait to make out! :) Well until next time, I love my Robyn and she will be forever mine :)"

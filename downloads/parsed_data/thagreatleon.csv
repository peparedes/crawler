<td width=""300"">I thought I'd give non-fiction a go, and I'm glad I did. A very insightful read, Candice Millard let the story read like fiction. Teddy, while a bit zany at times, was an absolutely incredible human being.</td>

<td width=""70"">03/01/11</td>
<td width=""250"">World War Z</td>
<td width=""80""></td>
<td width=""300"">Couldn't finish.  I hated this book.  Why is a book about zombies riddled with political commentary?</td>

<td width=""300"">Parts of this book are excellent and others, not so much, and one part just made me sick to my stomach.  That being said, I'll definitely keep going with the series.</td>

<td width=""80""><img src=""http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd247/ThaGreatLeon/THEW-4-1.gif""></td>
<td width=""300"">I finished this quite a while back-- it was great, don't get me wrong, but it felt a bit slumphish in that sophomore sort of way.</td>

<td width=""80""><img src=""http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd247/ThaGreatLeon/THEW-2-1.gif""></td>
<td width=""300"">I thought long and hard about what I'd want to rate this, but as it stands now, it's been the best piece of fantasy fiction I've read since LotR.  Damn fine, G.R.R.M., damn fine.</td>


<tr bgcolor=""#EEEEEE"">
<td>13.</td>
<td width=""70"">07/00/11</td>
<td width=""250"">The Hunger Games</td>
<td width=""80""></td>
<td width=""300"">The Martin series has gotten heavier than I'd prefer for my summer reading workout, so I've added this to give me something else to read when I need a break.</td>

<td width=""300"">Disappointing after the excellence that was book three, but hey, I'm a Lannister at heart, so this wasn't as bad as others made it out to be.  Book five, here we come!</td>

<td width=""300"">Overall, this tome of a novel was as fun to read as the earlier titles in the series.  I've never experienced life w/o another book to read.  It mostly sucks.  Minus the mostly.</td>

<td width=""80""><img src=""http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd247/ThaGreatLeon/THEW-1-1.gif""></td>

<td width=""250"">American Beauty (Re-watch)</td>
<td width=""80""><img src=""http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd247/ThaGreatLeon/THEW-2-1.gif""></td>
<td width=""300"">What a mysterious story; a kaleidoscopic journey through American suburbia, a series of love stories about imprisonment, loneliness and beauty. It's funny, it's angry, and sad.</td>

<tr bgcolor=""#EEEEEE"">
<td>11.</td>

<td width=""250"">Kick Ass</td>
<td width=""80""><img src=""http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd247/ThaGreatLeon/THEW-4-1.gif""></td>
<td width=""300"">This was foisted on me for my love of superheroes.  It was unique from other hero movies, in a very Indie/Scott Pilgrim sort of way, I'll give it that.  I don't feel like I wasted an hour and a half watching this, but the movie all together just felt like it was trying too hard.</td>

<tr bgcolor=""#EEEEEE"">
<td>12.</td>

<td width=""250"">Tangled</td>
<td width=""80""><img src=""http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd247/ThaGreatLeon/THEW-1-1.gif""></td>
<td width=""300"">The story was very standard, which I think I liked.  It was Disney, so what was supposed to happen all did in the end.  Aside from that, the animation.  Holy crap, the scenery was breath-taking.</td>

<tr bgcolor=""#EEEEEE"">
<td>13.</td>
<td width=""70"">04/02/11</td>
<td width=""250"">Suckerpunch</td>
<td width=""80""><img src=""http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd247/ThaGreatLeon/THEW-1-1.gif""></td>
<td width=""300"">I enjoyed this way more than critics told me I would.  Taken for what the movie was trying to do, I liked this as much as 300.</td>

<tr bgcolor=""#EEEEEE"">
<td>14.</td>
<td width=""70"">04/30/11</td>
<td width=""250"">The Two Towers (Re-watch)</td>
<td width=""80""><img src=""http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd247/ThaGreatLeon/THEW-1-1.gif""></td>
<td width=""300"">I'd likely give this 4.5 stars, and could also write an entire post on the movie, but for our love of brevity, we'll keep it short-- for what Jackson was trying to do, he did a damn fine job.</td>

<tr bgcolor=""#EEEEEE"">
<td>15.</td>
<td width=""70"">05/14/11</td>
<td width=""250"">The Social Network</td>
<td width=""80""><img src=""http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd247/ThaGreatLeon/THEW-1.gif""></td>
<td width=""300"">I love Aaron Sorkin, but wow, what a let down.  It's tough to absorb a story that happened so recently (I was only in high school when this was set), and outside of the writing, this really wasn't an impressive piece of cinema.  The acting felt indifferent, it ended abrubtly, and I found myself rooting for everyone except Zuckerberg (including the Winklevoss twins) from the beginning!</td>

<tr bgcolor=""#EEEEEE"">
<td>16.</td>
<td width=""70"">06/00/11</td>
<td width=""250"">Thor</td>
<td width=""80""><img src=""http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd247/ThaGreatLeon/THEW-1.gif""></td>
<td width=""300"">Ehm, Mr. Branaugh, I adore you, but please stay away from the superhero genre.  This movie felt like nothing more than a bloated means to introduce a character that will be used for the Avengers movie.</td>

<tr bgcolor=""#EEEEEE"">
<td>17.</td>
<td width=""70"">06/13/11</td>
<td width=""250"">The Hangover II</td>
<td width=""80""><img src=""http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd247/ThaGreatLeon/THEW-1.gif""></td>
<td width=""300"">Part one of this series blew my mind.  In fact, I still quote it today, but this just felt way too forced and regurgitated.</td>

<tr bgcolor=""#EEEEEE"">
<td>18.</td>
<td width=""70"">07/00/11</td>
<td width=""250"">Bridesmaids</td>
<td width=""80""><img src=""http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd247/ThaGreatLeon/THEW-1-1.gif""></td>
<td width=""300"">This is more like the summer comedy I had hoped the Hangover II would have been.  What it should have been, even.  Aside from the gags, I felt an immediate connection to most of these characters.  I could relate to almost all of their plights, and I'm not even female. </td>

<tr bgcolor=""#EEEEEE"">
<td>19.</td>
<td width=""70"">07/00/11</td>
<td width=""250"">Transformers 3: Dark of the Moon</td>
<td width=""80""><img src=""http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd247/ThaGreatLeon/THEW.gif""></td>
<td width=""300"">I left feeling ambiguous. It's better than the second, but then again, I had no idea what in blue hell was happening throughout that one.  What does that say about the third in this series? Final consensus: tripe with second-hand eye candy.</td>

<tr bgcolor=""#EEEEEE"">
<td>20.</td>
<td width=""70"">07/00/11</td>
<td width=""250"">Horrible Bosses</td>
<td width=""80""><img src=""http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd247/ThaGreatLeon/THEW-4-1.gif""></td>
<td width=""300"">Molly and I saw this the day after we saw Transformers 3. This skewed my opinion because anything with a coherent story is better than Transformers 3.  I thought this was funny and clever at times, but I doubt I'll ever see it again.</td>

<tr bgcolor=""#EEEEEE"">
<td>21.</td>
<td width=""70"">07/15/11</td>
<td width=""250"">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II</td>
<td width=""80""><img src=""http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd247/ThaGreatLeon/THEW-2-1.gif""></td>
<td width=""300"">My first encounter with HP was for a seventh grade book report (forced upon by my mother no less) and ended with the midnight release dressed as a Ravenclaw student.  While my true love will always be with LotR, there is something genuinely magical about HP and I'm both happy and fortunate to have grown up while it was happening.</td>

<tr bgcolor=""#EEEEEE"">
<td>22.</td>
<td width=""70"">07/17/11</td>
<td width=""250"">Fringe Seasons 1 & 2</td>
<td width=""80""><img src=""http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd247/ThaGreatLeon/THEW-1-1.gif""></td>
<td width=""300"">Whether it's playing Spot the Observer or devouring the relationship between Walter and Peter, this show is brilliant. Season 3 starts this weekend!</td>

<td>23.</td>
<td width=""70"">07/23/11</td>
<td width=""250"">Captain America</td>
<td width=""80""><img src=""http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd247/ThaGreatLeon/THEW-1-1.gif""></td>
<td width=""300"">Molly disagrees, but I thought it was the best Avengers prequel since the first Iron Man.</td>

<tr bgcolor=""#EEEEEE"">
<td>24.</td>
<td width=""70"">08/01/11</td>
<td width=""250"">Crazy, Stupid, Love</td>
<td width=""80""><img src=""http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd247/ThaGreatLeon/THEW-1-1.gif""></td>

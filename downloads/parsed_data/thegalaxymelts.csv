"event","So... I know youre checking my blog everyday for a new post as often as youre checking Borders Website for the release date of the next Harry Potter... sooooo be excited! hahaha... Im a funny bitch. You know next time a new Harry Potter book comes out you are going to think of this and say... That David sure is a funny bitch! Anyways... What have I been up to lately you ask? Well I broke my arm in a car accident last week, totaled my car, and havent been up to anything else since then. Ok, if you believed one word of that then you REALLY need to get to know me better. 

In non-fictional news, I have been doing the one and only thing I absolutely LOVE doing... no not masturbating you silly cow... Hanging out with my girlfriend. I have never been in a relationship like this before where two people can give so much to one another. Anytime Im talking to her... or around her... or even thinking about her I might as well be in a far away grassy land where midgets ride tri-cycles and honk their bike horns at one another... AKA HEAVEN! But Seriously. I used to think heaven was a place we went when we die, a part of the after life... but thats not heaven at all. Heaven is a feeling... That feeling I get when Im with her where I feel like the end of the world could come in that moment but I wouldnt care because Im with her. I love her so much and no thing or no one can ever change that. But I knew ever since target that she was special... just not HOW special. She means everything to me and I cant believe shes real sometimes or that shes actually MINE! 

Our 6 months is coming up soon and Im kinda clue less on what to get her... and shes got it all planned out like Columbus had sailing to the new land down to the dot... even though he missed his target and instead raped some indians... its all good though because they all got turkey. with gravy. you cant really mention turkey without the gravy part. and they all wore those cool hats with the belt buckles on them. Oh sorry... I was trying to get ur mind off me not having a CLUE what to get the girl of my dreams for 6 months. Im sure I will think of SOME thing. 

So I work in like 6 hours so I should probably get some sleep... 12 to 5 at Hollister isnt too bad. Cant wait till 5 comes and I get to see my woman. haha.... Peace Out Girl Scout

------ Love Always..... - Davey"

"event","Goodness it seems like forever since I have written on Live Journal, Im sure all you readers who FREQUENT my entries are getting anxious and antsy waiting for a new one to come out... ok maybe not. But anyways heres whats going on...
The job at Hollister kicks ass... Im basically a brand rep AND impact team member... Which, for those of you laymens means, I work in the back with stocking, AND in the front with folding and dressing rooms and such. The clothes, the music, the people (Especially Thor Bang lol) kick butt. Im making money and having lots of fun. I do miss being able to hear those groggy hhhhelllllos in the morning when I wake my girlfriend up and she comes and unlocks the front door for me and we cuddle for a while. But Im sure that will happen soon. :) ... 
So this morning I went to court for the ticket I got for having Green windshield washer lights... I mean people go there and get accused for running people over, and I get up at 7 in the morning for green windshield washer lights. Well the stupid coon dog didnt show up and the judge ( Artemis!) thought the charge was ridiculous in the first place, so it got dismissed and I paid nothing. Oh oh and that stupid old bastard that gave me, Amanda, AND ash tew a ticket was there giving some other poor dude a fine... that old bastard.. still nabbing people. If I got written a ticket for anything it should have been having a girl TOO beautiful next to me that day on the way to target.  ---<3<3<3 
So girlfriend and me are doing PERFECT! I couldnt be happier. No matter what I do or how hard I try I just CANT get tired of her... DARN lol... I loooovvvvveeeee her. :) and her silly grandmas! haha.... ""I would leave her for Nan"" haha what a UU kisser. (if you didnt get it.. thats a butt... UU) .. haha...  3-11-05 to FOREVER babayyy... and thats the real shit."

"event","Well 2 months has passed since I have had the girl of my dreams and I couldnt be more thankful or happy. I love her so much its unimaginable! She is everything I could ever dream up and more, and I am so lucky to have such a wonderful person in my life. Thanks girlfriend for being the best partner in the whole world. I love you from AnDrOmEdA and back! haha... 
So for 2 months I took my babayyy out to Beefs of course, and we both enjoyed some wraps and ate a few too many mushrooms, lol. Afterwards we went back to her house and she gave me the coolest gift ever, a CUNTASAURAS! but I wouldnt take it home yet because she has to sleep with it first to rub off on it a bit. And she made me a GIANT card which I couldnt have loved more. 

Oh Oh, so I finally got a job at Hollister! The lady called at 10 and I didnt know it was her, so I was messing around with her on the phone and said hello like 20 times haha, Im surprised she still wants to hire me. Im silly. 

Grrrr.... Grades Suck... to keep job at hollister I have to work mornings... the only time to take the class i NEED in the summer is the morning... grrrrr... headache! 

---Girlfriend thanks for always being there for me through everything and helping me so much. You dont know how happy you make me and how quick my day flies by when Im spending it with you.. I love you. --- Ur Tinky Winky."

Tom on a 4-wheeler.. non working walkie talkies... falling in holes... horses running loose.. Bringing Tom beer... That kid getting smacked... and the look on his face.... It was all worth it... and I love my girlfriend.. she is awesome.

Well she had been to ""adventure island"" before with someone else... and that kind of scared me, and made my heart hurt that she had been there before, and I wondered if she actually ""went down the slide"" before, and that made me kind of jealous and upset... but I gots to go..so I will finish this gigantic metaphor later.."

"event","Haha U know wat i just realized girlfriend? The subject of this entry contains a ""!"" , which u cant do on ur computer... haha weiner. !!!!!!!!!!!! So lately has been pretty stressful, school is getting increasingly difficult with tests, exams, papers, and assignments due within the next two weeks. Finals are coming up too! gahhhh... Plus I have to get all my grades up to at least 80%'s before the class is over, or else I lose my scholorship... but I think I have that under control. Now my mom is telling me that I have to get a job to go along with the class I have to take in the summer. Hopefully Kelly can hook me up with a job at Adventure Island, because that would be SWEET... working on the tan in the summer and pushing kiddies down slides, what could be better? Well I figured out there was a Summer A course and a Summer B course during the summer.. and I only have to take one.. So I wont be taking a class ALL summer.. just half of it, which is GooD NeWs. Lately Girlfriend and I havent had a full out lazy day and that kinda makes me sad, but I understand that her friends need her, especially lately, so I can wait. I feel like it has been forever since I have came over early and woke her up and just crashed in bed with her. And each time we try to watch X-files Kelly changes the channel because she hates that show :( , Scully and Mulder will have to wait for David and Amanda alone time. ""A lot like love"" is coming out and Amityville Horror is out and it has been a while since girlfriend and I have went and seen a movie together. I just realized Im wasting time at her house typing this instead of hanging out with her, so I am going to do that now!  ( I ended with an ! too... haha)

"event","This feeling that I carry 
So vibrant and strong inside
The smile on my face makes it
Almost impossible to hide
These feelings that I have
That continue to grow stronger
Every second Im with you
I want to stay a second longer
I hold you and feel everything
I ever need to feel
It doesnt seem like it could be true
But its there, its real
My eyes they long to hold you
And keep you in their sight
My arms they long to hold you
And keep you there all night
My lips they long to kiss you
Here, here, here, and here
My legs they wrap around you
To keep you so near
And your ""I love you's"" 
Are all my ears need to hear
To make my heart realize it
and Understand so clear
Every time I look at you Im reminded
I dont need a memoranda
That the rest of my life I want you
I need you, I love you Amanda."

"event","Yeah... so.. I know everyone LOVES the little house.. I love it too! But when you actually LIVE there.. you see a different side of it. Well maybe its the life at 11502 mellow creek lane thats just hectic, and not solely the little house. It seems like I just gotta get the HECK out of there lately though. It seems like everyone depends on me for the entertainment or something, but I think everyone is getting the point that Im not, and they can do things on their own. Like Jared always asked me to do stuff with him... and I always used to, but now I have more friends... like kelly, ash, dan, robbie, ryan, rob, luke, mike, jeff, and andrew who I dont see enough of. Plus I have an AMAZING girlfriend who I LOOOVE to be around and just LOVE in general. So lately I have turned him down on his offers to go places and do things... and its weird cuz he like gets pissed and tries to make me feel guilty about the whole thing. And I cant even take out the trash in the little house or begin to touch the door knob before sam asks where I am going. And the second I buy new shirts like Frank or Do you drive stick or my pink polo, theyre being worn by everyone else. And it seems like people are just getting pissed at me for having a life. Now I got sam calling my mom when I dont go to school to tell her Im not there... or he tells her weve got class today at 12:30 make sure davey goes. And when I come home... the door is locked. Can you believe that? The door to my OWN house.. is locked. Whatever... I wish Jadles was still here... hes the only one that understands my head... or maybe we are the only 2 logical and sane people left in this world!.. gahhh.. There is no such thing as having time to myself. And that sucks."

I know how the role is played... Ive played it. For more than two years at one point in time. But everything became so routine... and I hated it.
But with you... things are already routine
and I couldnt love it more
and I think thats what love is.. to be able to have a routine.. to be able to do the same thing with the same person day in and day out
and truly cherish every second of it
and I love our routine, and I love you

well cause when i really got attached to you i thought...okay he was with someone for two years and if he got sick of that what if he gets sikc of me

Yeah I know what you mean
I was scared of that at first too
that I would feel that way
or that you would
but like I cant wait to do it
I cant wait to be over.. lying in ur bed.. with u on my shoulder.. listening to the same soco cd.. or watching the same tv shows
because no matter what
I will have the same feelings for you too
and thats the difference"

"event","Wow... Its been forever since I have updated this thing... You must forgive me because this whole week I have had EXXXXXAMSSSS... gahhh... yea which basically means me going in class.. sitting next to a dorky kid... then copying their 100 question multiple choice test answer for answer.. I got like a 73... and 83.. and a 62... yeahhh not that great.. but that averages to like a 72.. with no studying.. which is cool. 

In other news, me and my escalady are doing awesome. Meaning we hang out all day every day, and love every second of it. Well... I do at least. Havent seen X-Files in a while though and that saddens me, but we plan on renting the movie soon. IM glad I havent seen law and order in a while, but I miss my boy that always looks tired, with the girl partner. But Im pretty happy right now... with just about everything. I just hate knowing I have everything to lose, and that scares me LOTS. But Id rather be on top then not having everything, so I guess I should just shut up and be happy right? Easier said than done. Gahhhhh

So there was some knocking on the little house door last nite.. at 4 frickin oclock. And i didnt answer.. i thought who ever it was would go away. But the knocking continued.. SO i got out of bed and answered in my boxers and with my crazy hair.. and It was Luke. And he says... Daveeee... Lets go to steak n shake... hahahaha I love that kid... And rob and ryan went with us.. It took like 3 cars to get there and back... long story. But me and luke went and looked at those huge red towers.. Ive never seen em before.. and it was awesome.. haha how romantic. THen he drove me home but I denied him the goodnite kiss... Maybe next time buddy. 

Sometimes I love you but sometimes I hate you. I hate that I didnt meet you sooner, that I wasnt the first one you fell for, that I wasnt the first one to passionately kiss your lips, that I wasnt the first one to get lost in your eyes, that I wasnt the first to hug you tight and pull you near, that I wasnt the first one to cuddle with you and watch tv, that I wasnt the first one you nervously wrapped your hand around, and that I wasnt the first to get a peice of your heart. But I promise now that I met you, fell for you, kissed your lips, got lost in your eyes, hugged you tight and pulled you near, cuddled with you and watched tv, nervously wrapped my hand in yours, and have a peice of your heart... I see more in you than anyone else ever has or will, and I can only dream to be the last to do all those things with and more.

Unless youre single, but then you suck too, because who goes looking for chicks/guys on myspace? Yea... so either way you suck, sorry. Anyways... what have I been up to lately?   (Que the X-Files Piano Theme Song) LAZY DAYS...  Yep.. nothing is better than a regular lazy day with my girlfriend. Things have been going ridiculously well, so well in fact we have to make stuff up to fight about for no reason... yeah.. but I couldn't be happier with my birdie. I have honestly never felt this before... ""this"" being.. happy.. pleased.. amazed.. romanced.. loved.. content.. satisfied.. I could really go on forever. I look forward to waking up early just so I can rush over to see her and wake her up with my phone call when she answers with that tired ""hhhhhhhello"" and I say ""Come get me.. Im here"". Everytime I look at her I just cant believe someone so beautiful could like me, or want to hold my hand, or look at me the way she does, and that makes me feel unimaginably lucky. And I know that I am lucky so I take every second for all that it is worth, and never take one moment with her for granted. Because it seems like the time passes so quickly when I am with her. When her hand reaches for mine I get chill bumps up my arm and my heart starts to flap its wings. And the truth is.. Im sure... positive.. that I will always feel that way about her... I will always get those chill bumps."

I know that it was late
And we both had some to drink
But it tears apart my heart
when I start to think
That you could call me that
Because no matter what I do
I just cant be him
I cant erase his face or what he meant to you
and thats like a sharp knife grabbing and stabbing me
over and over again
The pains flow through my vains to my every limb
grabbing me and stabbing me
over and over again"

"event","Just like a dream---

When I open my eyes
to the morning light
Tack still there
From the other night
I recall the dreams of you

I try to look good
but how can i next to you?
Its a feat I have yet to accomplish
Its something no one can do
Especially when you wear blue

I throw on my shoes
I know you like pink
The drive seems so long
So I just think
Of how in love with you I am

I finally arrive
to my destination
Get out of the car
Without hesitation
Its been so many hours she says

Then she gives me a hug
With that warm welcome smile
Everything about her
Makes it more than worthwhile
To come and see her everyday

We lay down under Winnie
Just her and me
Snuggle Bunny together
to konstantine or t.v.
and Im her ""Number One Fan""

My curiosity kills me
I look in her eyes
The warm brown windows
Melt my insides
I can tell exactly what shes thinking

She says ""what?""
But I hardly heard
Im so awestruck
I cant say a word
Everything about her gets me

Then I will say something funny
Like Cuntasauras or skeet
And if its worthy enough
She will kick her feet
Her laugh is what I live for

Then I will pull her tight
We get nice and snug
I feel so complete
In her grip, her hug
She was made especially for me

And the way she is 
Every little thing
Is so right to me
Hearts tingling
I swear it seems just like a dream"

"event","Monday----  I woke up early to turn in my paper to Besterfield... Yep... first day back at school.. :( ... But I left there and decided I wanted to do somewthing sweet for my escalady.. So I made some signs and taped them to her window... I was so stupid and put the tape on wrong.. so the notes would be facing things on the outside, not the inside... so I sat there and retaped each page over and stuck em on her window... I felt good about doing it, porbably because I always feel good when Im thinking of her... I was just in a real nice positive mood. Then i went back to class... gahh.. came home and showered and went to Birdies... It had been 15 hours since id seen her.. whew!.. But i was soo tired so we just crashed on her bed mostly, watched some tv... talked... lazy days rule. She went out to dinner with ash and i was broke so I figured I would just meet em at kellys later. So i go over to kellys later and me and amanda and KJO watch the soco dvd, and some of the Tenacious D dvd and I just have the best time sitting and just talking with amanda.  later i sit at the fire and just hug with my GIRLFRIEND and talk and admire the fire and the dark and the moon and the stars and everything about her that just lit up the night. Mike and Dan were still there, and I got to know those guys a little better, and theyre really cool guys. Later on I went home, grabbed some Crown and cokes... and brought it over... mostly because mike was bummed his last nite in tampa would be a sober one. So i hooked him and Dan up. Then me and Dan got some Duets going on the guitar and it was bad ass.. I had so much fun just sitting on the truck tailgate listening to all my favorite songs with my favorite person <3. I woke up early and was tired so AP and I crashed in the boom boom room... and she told me what ""more than like you"" meant .. and I couldnt have felt much happier than I did right then... because I knew she was sincere and I knew I felt the same way. 

Tuesday (today)- We woke up at kellys at like 7:30 thanks to Mrs. Amanda... gahhh.. haha.. I froze my ass off in that boom boom room... I only had a SHEET! ahhh.. So we woke up.. sat around.. and finally headed off to the beach... I skipped school to go to Anna marie with amanda, because if i didnt.. it would be way too long of a break and i wouldnt be able to handle it. Its only been like 4 hours and I can hardly handle it as it is. So we went.. and she actually went in my car with ME... hahaha... and we sang cauterize.. and arrived at where she would be staying.. Terry is a LUNATIC.. haha.. mannnn.... crazy.. but living by the beach is so nice and I had fun just hanging out with my escalady and pretending that we were the only twon on the beach.. and on this planet. And i just had a really good time. I always do with her."

Yesterdays feelings 
will be kept and held so tight
You warmed my heart
with your message last night
I know its soon
but you have no clue what it meant to me
Its okay when its obvious
that we were just meant to be
and you embraced me
in the bed we shared together
I was feeling lonely
but my life got so much better
when those words I felt
I longed to hear
Made their way from your lips
to my anxious ears 
and brushed my tender heart
with pure content
I will never forget one second
of how that night went
The way things unfold
nothings ever gone so smoothly
The kinda things that happen
only in the movies 
But it happened with us
with me, with you
Maybe I more than like you
maybe I love you too.

It all started with your lips, 
The ones I have to kiss. 
And you wore it... you knew,  
Youre so beautiful in blue. 
But then again, you always are... 

The feeling overcame us, 
The one people dream of,  
The one we have... 
From the heart she said...  
Not the bottle.  

I was so scared...   
Twisted up in you.  
My heart skipped more beats,  
Than I can even count.  
You're so unreal.  

I knew I shouldn't worry  
Were on the same track.   
The feelings were so real, so true...

 I think you have a clue... 
 How I feel right now.. 
Head over heels for you.. 
For you to like me this much.. 
its an impossibility... 
Everything about you.. 
Just doesnt seem real to me... 
Are my eyes so purposefully deceiving my head... 
as I try so hard to find an imperfection... 
lying next to you in my bed... 
I cant stop thinking of how with every word or kiss...
 you take me so much higher..
 Where others have only sparked their mark... 
you light a fire.... 
And I give myself my heart to you... 
Not one string attached..
 Me and You, You and Me...
 Couldnt be more perfectly matched."

"event","Woahhhh... Havent updated in a while..
Well a little while ago I went to a In Passing, Brandston, Number One Fan concert.. and it was the shit! I went with Sam and Jadles... my two negros.. and Number One Fan couldnt have put on a better show.. I was front row singing every word of every song. And when it was over I hugged the lead singer and told him how much he rocked out! And I almost went for ass... but decided not too.. When leaving the orpheum that night I saw a sign.. It said CARTEL!!! with Earning Your Red Wings... and guess what?! It was next week.. on sunday! MY BIRTHDAY!!! so I just haddd to make plans to go to THAT! heck yes...

So with my whole relationship with girls... Along with Ashley never being open with her feelings.. I felt like I couldnt trust her and that she was hiding something from me. So I couldnt have that, because I need someone who can share their feelings openly. So I was pretty distraught and decided I would go to Target with Amanda and try to feel better about another failure on the relationship checklist. So I picked her up.. and she looked AMAZING in this pink Hollister Jacket.. and I was wearing my brown one which resembled hers... So we headed of and... *Police Sirens* I got my ass pulled OVER!!! damn.. and it was a NIGGER cop.. so I knew I was FUCKED! So he says the green lights on my hood were illegal and asks for my license and registration. So I hand him the stuff and he says.. Ummm this registration is from 2 yrs ago... and i said.. Oh.. So i find the new one and hand it to him. And he says.. Do you still live at the address stated.. and I said.. No.. and he said How long have u lived at ur current residence.. and I said umm.. a few years.. and he said.. did you know you have 10 days to change it on ur license.. and i said.. haha I recall it now that you mention it... yesss.  hahahahaha Damn im a fool. So he gave me a ticket for the lights... 76.50 GAHHHHHH but he let me slide on the old license... whew... bastard! 
So me and Amanda went to target and had the best time... And I realized... Hey.. I like this girl.  I mean.. we both said SWEDISH FISH at the same time.. and we both thought Candyland was the absolute best board game ever to be made.. but the Tar Pit is SCARRRRY!!! and that Barnum and Bailey animal crackers in the box ROCKKKK... and that Coconut shampoo... is AWESOME..!!!!  and Fast Food.. SuCKS!!! haha.. and everytime I looked at her.. I noticed something new that captivated me. Yep. I fell for her. And that was on a Monday... 

Ever since then we have basically hung out EVERY DAY! And it has been awesome.. We have crazy lazy days where we just Lounge around her house or the little house... and just watch movies... 
Tuesday was our lazy night and we watched Saw... haha and Sam and Jadles were looking through the window to see if me and amanda were ""doing"" anything.. which we werent.. just cuddling! yayy
and Wednesday I skipped school and we hung out and talked and cuddled ALLLLLL DAYYYYY... We watched every single tv show on MTV... after she realized Family Guy was theee SHHHHITTTT and she was under rating the whole time... Dirty Lady.... BIRDY!!! That was Fun Fun
Thursday.... I had a shit load of homework and had to go to school and get sculpted... so I didnt see her.. :(   lol. 
Friday... I decided it was me to go to her house and chill.. she had to watch her cool lil bro Tyler...And Kelly was there.. YAYYY.. she has a NICCCE butt... whew... anyways... We watched Van Wilder.. it was COOOOLLL... I loved it. As we cuddled on her L shaped couch under her Winnie The Pooh pillow. But she had plans to go to Kellys.. But when Kelly was in the bathroom the anticipation couldnt handle it and I kissed her and it was the best...  so I came home and decided to go to ORTS to play poker... I lost early.. it was my first time.. and I ended up reading Bernstein Bears most the time.. then game 2 started.. and I lost more money hahaha... man I suck.. but Billy is going to teach me how to play.. and thats cool. And I wanted to see Amanda real bad.. So I left sam at Orts because he hadnt lost yet.. and rushed home to the little house so Amanda could come visit.. and we basically just cuddled ALLLLLL flippin night and kissed some more then cuddled some more.. Just like the howie day song.. The Dawn Is breaking.. Our light shining through.. Youre barely waking.. and Im tangled up in you... I closed the blinds with a tack so we could sleep longer.. haha.. I should tin foil it though.. 
Saturday...  Amanda got pissed in the cold weather and went home.. and I came over and picked her up to try and make her feel better... So we went back to my place and watched Just Married.. we started kissing but couldnt help laughing during our kissing because Ashton is so flippin hilarious... I HOPE HE TAUGHT YOU HOW TO PULL A FIRE POKER>>>> OUT OF UR ASS!!!! hahahaha I love him... then I took her home and I was sad... SADDD
Sunday!!!-- my birthday... I woke up and got kick ass presents from my family... A Wallet..A gift card to Sonnys.. and a Bad Ass shirt from Hollister.. and a 20 spot from gary haha... I love that guy. Then i rushed to amandas so she could make my birthday just that much better... My present was those shorts she was wearing... good lord.. whew... okay anyways..  We watched my favorite movie ever.. SERENDIPITY... DUPLICITOUS.. LULL... haha I love it.. Dont kick the snow at that guy! Stay on the other side of the line sir! haha but I had to leave right after to pick up my sis.. then we went to my dads and that was cool.. he got hooters.. yummm.. and made me a birthday milk shake... his milk shakes are the best... haha and he gave me 250 bucks whew... what a guy.. and TONS of people called me and told me happy birthday and i felt special.. And sam hooked me up with a Denim Jacket.. which i have wanted forever... and *drumroll* tickets to frickin COPELAND... my favorite band of all time!!!! GAHHHHh ur the brightest little firefly in my jar sammy!!! gahhhh then me and sammy went to that Cartel concert at the orpheum.. man they rock
and Monday... Today... i went to english class because I THOUGHT a paper was due.. but its not due for another 2 weeks.. damn I suck. And then after school I got... guess who.. AMANDA!!! YAYY.. and we went to the mall and hit up Hollister... and I spent ALL my money... Every BIT..!!! I got some Sandals.. a Pink Polo.. A brown inside out shirt... fuck bastard.. haha.. a kick ass pair of jeans.. a red shirt that says Well my mom says Im cool... haha.. umm and some baby blue shorts that are PIIIMMMMP! and amanda showed me everything i would look DEAD sexy in... haha so i got it all...  Then we went back to my place... watched tv in bed.. lazzzzyyy... then went back to her house.. I met her HOTTTT mom! whew.. I love that lady.. and she gave me a sex talk... haha.. and we just chilled in amandas room listening to NOF.. frickin awesomeeeeee.... heck yes... Then i got my RADDDDD gifts ... and EL EM AY OH!!! I laughed my ass off.. I almost pissed my frickin pants over her card with a police officer on it.. hahahahahahaha.... k;sjnbg;abg;awnbg; the ramp!!!!

"event","I thought i was falling for you but i was wrong..
I couldnt have been more wrong...
But the person I did fall for...
Was right there all along. 

Is it the way she just shows up...
Is it the way she moves... 
Or is it that she opens up...
And drops me perfect clues?

Its true that it happens...
when the person is right...
you just fall, fall, fall..
you just know its right.
and those eyes just convince
and prove the point more
Ive fallen, im gone, im fading fast
Im way past the floor.

So dont try to pick me up
Your hand cant reach this far... I swear.
Dont try to pick me up
Were not even in the same world... I swear.

its the way she just shows up...
its the way she moves...
i love how she opens up
and drops those perfect clues."

"event","hmmmm... so she just wont open up to me no matter what i say or do... so i have no other choice but to cut off my feelings for her... the feelings that keep getting ingored and stepped on.. or accepted but unanswered. Theres gotta be someone out there who can be honest with me and open up and tell me how they really feel... and I will find her and keep her forever.. knowing that im so lucky to have her... shes probably right under my nose and i dont even know it. i always choose wrong... its the only thing im good at... but the next person i fall for.. I will genuinely... honestly fall for her. Its happening. god will send me something great.. who knows what im thinking the same time im thinking it... and knows exactly what im about to say. And can just be lazy with me and still have an amazing time.... its happening."

"event","The following are songs I wrote. These are my first attempts at actually writing a song, and not a poem. No rhyme scheme, no real thought out pattern. This is as emo as emo gets. 

I Get the Point--- 
Im a moron I know... tell me something new. 
I know im probably bugging you or scaring you, but I get the point.
I spill my heart out hoping you will clean up my emotions and put them back inside me, after some reassurance. All I need every once in a while is some reasurrance. 
But they lie there on the floor unattended and unwelcome, and I fell. 
Fell for everything you are. But you, you didnt fall anywhere. 
But I get the point. 

Obvious-----
If you wonder why I worry so much, I thought it was obvious. 
Im afraid of losing you. I thought it was clear, that I cant lose you.
But its hard to lose something you never really had. 
So now im letting go of false hopes and unreal expectations. 
I thought it was obvious, that I want you. I thought it was clear, that I want you.
Its obvious, you dont want me. Its clear, you dont want me.   

Giving Up----
I know I messed up again, I always do. Its clearly not something unordinary. 
Unordinary like you. But dont give up on me.
I thought we had something, I thought we have something. 
My composure was all I had, now I dont even have that. 
I take what I can get, and right now its nothing.
Nothing but giving up. 
But dont give up on me. We have something.  

Lucky----
If im lucky this morning I will wake up to you.
Whether its from a dream you were in...
We were in together.
Or a message you left on my phone. 
But my luck is running thin,
I check my phone, but theres nothing there.
and the dream seems non existent. 
But it was so real.
I could have sworn it was real. 
But theres nothing there. 
Maybe tomorrow I will get lucky.
I hope tomorrow I will get lucky."

"event","Ok.. More Poetry... which always seems to go unanswered... 

Mixed Signals----- (the AT song)
It seems like all I get from you are mixed signals...
Question marks thrown in my direction.
Your feelings, your emotions for me...
Hidden beyond detection. 
Are you afraid that I'll let you down 
like all the others?
I would never let you down
like all the others. 
Your hurt is my hurt,
My heart is yours.
And if you would give me a chance...
Yours would be safe with me.
Guarded and protected by my feelings for you,
which will undoubtedly never fade or fall.
Never doubt my feelings for you,
no need to doubt at all.
I will be waiting, I will be here
I'll be ready for you.
When you realize I could never hurt you
When youre ready for me.
And know that all I want to do
is make you happy...
make you happy...

Do you------
Do you notice the way I look at you?
My gaze whether far or near,
the look that screams youre beautiful
And couldnt be more sincere?
Do you notice the way I hold your hand
Dreading when I have to let go?
If I didnt have to, I think you know
I'd never release or let go.
Do you notice when your gone
how my flesh aches?
And to cure it...
One call, one text, one second of you... is all it takes?
Do you notice the fire that ignites inside,
When our lips lock for a second or two?
and overwhelms every bit of me,
do you have the slightest clue?
Do you notice my eyes light up,
in the morning when I read ""Hello Sunshine""?
It makes me feel like a part of you
Belongs to me, is all mine. 
Do you notice when youre lying next to me,
How sure I am that Im secure?
My heart jumps in rapid thumps
Unsure of how much more I can endure.
Do you notice these things?
Do you notice them too?
Do you notice these instances?
Do you? Because theyre true.

Seems like my poems mean nothing though... so i dont know why i even write them anymore
Im chasing after something that cant be caught   ;("

"event","Its Saturday... FINALLY... and the party is tonite... I was hoping everyone could be her like at 7... but everyone called and said they would be here at Niner Oclock... so its all good. I woke up to my mom drumming on the door at 1:30 pm... who has the nerve to wake you up so EARLY!!!! lol... And She was like I got the drinks... and threw like 8 six packs into the little house doorway... Sam and JD quickly got a cooler and iced them... and I sat around and scratched my manly places.. because I was just waking up...I then hopped in the shower and tried to slap on a sexy outfit... some jeans and a long sleeve cowboy shirt with cool little snap buttons... then i actually DID MY HAIR for once.. I mean... I didnt wear a beanie... which is amazing.. I showed of my beautiful locks to the world... then I grabbed the boys and we headed to the mall to get some party stuff... So we take the beautiful swedish and hit up spencers and find this awesome drinking game called ""What the F*ck?"" and knew it would be a blast for the party... We saw sweets from heaven and the beautiful array of candy bracelets and decided to hook ourselves up... I was pretty excited. So We got back home.... Cleaned the little house to perfection.. and actually managed to alleviate that nasty ferret smell for the time being with some marvelous scented candles haha... I believe they are ""Rain Water"" .. lol... My mommy got them... and the little house looked so fresh and so clean clean... Me and Jadles were pretty bored... so We decided we would go to CVS and buy some condoms while holding hands and talking with our Gay accents just for the hell of it... Haha and our gay think didnt work... simply because we grabbed ""Her Pleasure"" condoms... but im sure there wasnt any HIS PLEASURE... So it was getting to be about that time for the party.. and me and Jadles hit up the trampoline for a bit.. and held on to eachothers hands and jumped like Billy Madison did to the Penguin haha... and then we laid on the trampoline and had some Bakardis waiting for everyone.. Yuge had to work... but he dropped in during break and I really appreciated that because he is one of my best freinds and always will be... Everybody loves an Asian Boy... <3.... so we are frickin STARVING waiting for everyone... and its like 9:15.. so we go to grab some hot and readys.. me sam JD and Jare Bear.. And we noticed on the menu that there was something called a Baby PanPan! just like that... and we CRACKED UP... buzzed or Not it was frickin hilarious.. so we gave jadles 3 bucks to go up there with a straight face and say I want one Baby PanPan! and he got up there.. and his face was so serious.... and right when he went to open his mouth he just busted up laughing and everyone was looking at him like what the hell.. and me sam and Jared were laughing our asses off.. and the line in Little Ceasars was so confused... but it didnt matter.. I mean... who CAN order a baby PANPAN with a serious face? So he looked up in failure and said.. Crazy Bread please... hahahaha.. what a weiner... So we got back.. and everyone is there.... Ash, Amanda, Erin, and Molly all awating us...  and Molly and Erin played Mario Kart with Sammy while me JD ash and Amanda all played What The Fuck.... haha... And me and jadles got the Q...  Who would you rather have sex with.. A) A Nobel Prize Winner... or B) a Porn Star... haha and Jadles knew i was going to pick the wrong answer somehow.. were just on the same page like that... haha So I picked A of course.. and this game ended up to me getting pretty drunk.. then sam turned on saw and Fast Forwarded HALF OF THE MOVIE! and everyone thought they would be jerks and say I fell asleep or passed out... hahaha so very funny... so then I bit all their nipples for doing that. And then i beat Jared up for trying to trick me... I grabbed his achilles tendon pretty hardcore.. Then me and Jadles Sang some Tenacious D for the ladies.. and played the Ashley Tew Song by Number One Fan and sang that... Then we just sat around watching Saw.. and chatting... and everyone was effing with me.. so I walked out in the rain and down to the street to look at the stars and just sit... and then sam came and picked me up and carried me all the way back to the little house.. and he carried me upside down.. and that didnt feel so good at all... so I came back in here and acted like a jerk and just laid in my bed... and i just wanted to lay with ash and hold her hand and tell her shes the coolest.. but i think she was upset at what a dummy i was being.. so I just laid there... pretty sad about the whole situation... then I heard a big crash and billy was on the floor and jared was too and the rolly chair got tipped over.. and bottles fell everywhere.. and well... We all KNOW it was Jareds fault... lol....So I beat the crap out of him again...and he chewed off every bit of my candy bracelet and everyone said I ate it when there was like 20 peices left before jared chomped it all away... and they all blamed me saying i was drunk when jared ate it...  and then I grabbed my guitar and made up the Billy song off the top of my head.. and I tried playing the Ashley song.. but she wasnt really listening to anything I was doing anymore so I tossed the guitar and the pick and went back to bed.. and Jared continued singing the billy song for the next 5 hours or so... just randomly.. and i laid in my bed... and ash had to leave at 2 and I think i was more upset about that than anything because all the way up till she got here we were just gonna stay up all nite talking and cuddling but that didnt happen... so I just laid there.. then Jared came over and we started punching my wall.. mostly because we couldnt feel physical pain anymore.. but our emotional frustrations were strong and told us to hit the wall... so we left some pretty nasty dents in it.. and my knuckles were bleeding.. and it was kinda cool... because i thought i was in the video game Street Fighter or something... doing  a hayookin on someones face... probably Zangeif.. cuz i dont like him. Everyone was doubting my judgements all night... and i got frustrated and i just laid in my bed alone till about 1:10 when ashley came and laid next to me... and i decided i would turn over and hold her hand while i still could.. so i did.. and i wish i wouldnt have been a jerk earlier and I would have done that like 4 hrs before then... im a dummy... anyways.. i hope you forgive me for being a stupid jerk... Jerk and a HALF! for doing that... Im sorry... ------- Davey"

"event","Goodness Gracious kids... its been a WHILE since i have gotten on hurr and posted.. so I will do a long one! Lets see... The weekend kicked ASSSSSSS.... not really though.. I procrastinated my two essays until Sunday night at about midnight haha what a slacker! Then I go in monday and Coop gives us an extension until wednesday.. What a nut hugger... 

But lets start at the beginning shall we? Friday I had a HUGE sociology test... went in without studying a lick... and nailed it like Billy Bob did Angelina. I aced that beast. Came home and passed out at about 10:30. Then Sam and Jeff went to school and i was pretty lonely and bored so I just kept sleeping... lol.. I can sleep FOREVER. So they finally got back and Sam went ovet ot his buddies to play Poker with all the R-View kids... I decided not to b/c I was feeling a little sick, So jeff stayed with me and we played some SMASH BROTHERS like always. I kicked his ass everytime.. I have never been defeated. So it was a pretty crappy day... and all the sudden billy and ash call and ask to come over and i couldnt have been more excited. So they came over and chilled for a while... They brought some crappy LOW CARB pussy drinks over... tasted like pure garbage... but they were a little off their rockers haha... they ended up passing out here.. and it was great to fall asleep knowing ash was next to me! :)... 

Saturday was pretty action packed... JD decided he was moving into the little house... so we went to his hometown.. LOL (landolakes) and got his stuff... Little did i know he didnt tell his parents the plan before this. So they were pretty angry and I hid in a corner of his room while they yelled at him what a bad  effing Idea it was... Then he just picked up his stuff... said bye ... and walked out.. hahaha Jadles is a crazy biotch. So we left and we were starving... so we hit up this chinese buffet that couldnt have been more delicious! Except this crazy chinese lady kept giving us refills every 2 seconds and i felt bad my cup was always full so i kept chugging it so she could refill it... because refilling seemed to make her day worth living. So we went back to his house got some more stuff.. and on the way back to r-view we thought we would stop and sculpt at the USF gym... so we tried hurrying there but it closes at 5 and the time was currently 5:02... dammit.. so We decided while we are in TT(temple Terrace) we might as well hit up Brunos.. which we did.. and theres this dirty guy in there talking about ""I fucking hate fucking flamers... Fuck gay pride week.."" and Im wearing a pink shirt and JD is wearing a candy bracelet so we act as gay as possible.. holding hands.. feeding eachother.. haha and the guy flipped... so we got the hell outta there.... still holding hands.. hahaha.. so we drive back to the little house.. and after all that driving we are exhausted but i had to call ash and tell her the GAY story and the ANTI GAY guy...THEN me and sammy and JD saw Constantine which kicked ASSSSS!!! Keanu Reeves is redeeming himself lately!I got home and So i rested until Suprise! ash and billy come over!!!!!!!! YAYYY!!!!! They stayed till real late.. and Tenacious D graced their presence on my TV set... Gotta love jack black... I think something about him puts ladies in THE MOOOD!!!! haha... 

Sunday was a sleep in day.. but Sam went and played football and when he came home he had HUGE nasty blisters on his feet.. but i dont have a foot phobia.. so i checked it out.. pretty grusome! JD and I slept in and he enjoyed his first night living in the little house... We just chilled basically all day and ash stopped by long enough to make my night.... AND TAKE NAP DYNAMITE!!! Dirty woman! :).... that night I did my stupid essays that took FOREVER... gosh... 

and Monday I had to go to school... it SUCKS colleges dont understand teenagers NEED to celebrate Presidents day...!!!! Those bastards...

Tueday was awesome... Billy being the best buddy ever called me and told me about ash's ticket and how she was having a bad day.. So i was thinking.. hmmm.. PERFECT TIME for a CP!!! (Care Package for you dummies)... so I finished this story about Valentines Day I have been working on... slapped it in an official CP holder (which means a used folder)... and I called her to see where she was.. and she was hanging with kelly at her house.. Grrrreat.. i had NO CLUE where her house was.. So i called Billy and she didnt know ANY street names! Shes like you will see a school.. then turn left.. then right... then left... GOSH thanks billy!!!! Lol.. J/k!!! So we finally found out and we tried to be all secret and throw it on her windshield.. and I told her Cops were going around inspecting windshields for cracks and giving tickets so she better check hers... hahaha.. Kinda lame??!!.... so she got it and read it and like it very much and that made me HAPPY!!! This all happend while sam and JD and I were enjoying Chili's!! YUMMMM... I had some tast fajitas.. and endless chips and dip.. but UHOH sam cant find his wallet when the bill comes.. he LOST IT.. he checks the car and NOTHING!! AHHH.. so my mom.. like always... comes to my rescue... because shes just THAT cool.. and offers to pay for ALL OF OUR MEALS!!! What an AWESOME woman! I love her. 

TODAY IS THURSDAY!!! STARTING LINE!!! I cant wait to see an awesome band with an awesome girl!!! What a day this is going to be.. I skipped class and slept till 1:20 and woke up to an AWESOME text message from ashley that made my frickin day already... shes so sweet! :)....

"event","* This is just another one of my poems... you may notice little captions in parenthesis after some of the lines... Read the poem and ignore those the first time you read it... then go back and read em. This one goes out to... well.... you know who you are


How I feel for you...
Just in case you were wondering
Or didn't have a clue
Heres a little hint
of how I feel for you
When Im in class and the teacher
Is talking about god knows what
I think of all your little sayings
And how you call me a nut   ( Probably Because I am... )   
When Im in my car
Listening to my favorite songs   ( Anberlin, and Copeland) 
I wish you were there with me
Just to sing along   ( Like we do to the Tide)
Before I go to bed at night
I cuddle tight with HG      ( who fits me snug still)
Close my eyes and imagine
That its you and me    (usually of that kiss)
When my phone starts to ring
And I see its you thats calling ( on my phone it comes up as Ashes )
My eyes light up and I grab it quick
Without hesitation or stalling   (unless my voice is gone!) 
When you leave the little house
You take the biggest part
Of me with you....
You take my heart
I cant help but give you
Care packages and such
Because it feels like I owe you
You've given me so much! 
Just in case you were wondering
Or didn't have a clue
Heres a little hint
Of how I feel for you
Everything comes together
Seems like were meant to be
How do you feel?
Do you agree?

"event","So... Everyones off to parties or parades or friends houses just like every weekend and Sammy and I are here... like usual.... what losers. Its okay...Im content with our LITTLE HOUSE life and not going to the parade or parties. Its not really my thing anyways. I never really got into partying. Mainly because when you party you drink or smoke.... and I used to hate both... But now I just HATE smoking... Drinking is okay.. as long as its done responsibly. I probably sound like a loser for saying that stuff but I dont care because thats who I am! But if you are a partier... thats fine with me because that might just be who you are, and everyone can make their own decisions. Here are some statistics I got on smoking and drinking though... just to get you thinking.
*About 1 out of every 5 deaths in the US can be attributed to tobacco products.
*Every eight seconds, someone in the world dies due to tobacco.
*In 1990, 72 million bottles of a popular mineral water were voluntarily recalled because of small traces of benzene. The smoke from one pack of unfiltered cigarettes has as much benzene as 169bottles of the contaminated water.
*In as little as 2 weeks nicotine changes the brains chemistry and addiction can begin.
*ate.
*Cigarette smoke contains 69 chemical compounds that are known cause cancer.
*1 out of 3 smokers are estimated to eventually die from a tobacco-related disease.
*Over 50,000 people a year die from secondhand smoke in the US alone.
*SMOKING IS FOR JERKS!!!!!!!!!!!"

written 2-11-05 by MeEeE

sO UnSuRe-----
What am I getting
Myself Into now?
My heart beats faster
Than my body will allow.
Your hand, it feels so good,
When wrapped in mine.
And it only gets better,
When our fingers intertwine.
Then I wonder what is floating,
Whats drifting through your head?
As you are lying there, so close to me,
Our tender arms brushing in my bed.
My fragile heart has taken,
All its walls can defend.
Is that smile on your face so real,
Or is it just pretend?
When I explore your never ending eyes,
That feeling I recieve...
Should I keep it and embrace it?
Or is it make believe?
My shredded heart hangs merely by a thread,
Are you my cure?
Or are you just leading me on?
...Im so unsure..."

"event","What to do's (Turn Ons):
1) When the girl makes the attempt at holding my hand, or looping her arm through mine, or cuddling before I even get the chance to. 
2) When the girl makes the effort to come see me, even when shes really busy or has to work, but just stops in to say hello at least.
3) Obvious ""What to Do's"": Holding hands, hugs, cuddling, kisses.
4) When we explore eachothers eyes endlessly.
5) When we map eachother with our hands.. DOES NOT mean in a dirty way... just exploring body parts and realizing how perfect they really are. 
6) Surprises!!! Just as long as I dont have to wait forever. 
7) Honesty. If you tell me everything on your mind truthfuly, you will win my heart over. 
8) A great sense of humor. If you can make me laugh you're a winner.

What NOT to do's (Turn Offs): they kind of just are the opposite of the above but oh well:
1) When it feels like Im the only one trying to make contact or that cares if we hold hands or not. 
2) Any drugs besides alcohol... Drugs have taken people from my life so early and are for weak people. For example... I was in 9th grade and my brother Joey was in 11th and we lived in Sarasota. My friend Anthony, also in 9th grade, decided he would chill with us friday. So we are sitting around and this girl didn't invite us to her party so we decided we would invite ourselves. So we got there and brown bottles hung from every hand, and smoke filled the room like clouds. There were so many people there that me and anthony went one way, and my brother went another and we lost eachother. So anthony and me head out onto the back porch and everyone is smoking and we are offered a hit. After saying no like 10 times I got pushed through the screen of the porch by some seniors. They asked me again and I said no, so they hit me a few times until I fell. After seeing this anthony took the hit. I dont know how long I was out in the lawn, but I felt someone tug at my shirt, and lifelessly I was lifted up. My brother dusted me off and asked if I was okay. We searched for anthony for at least an hour, but there was too many people, and too much smoke... plus everyone wanted to beat our asses. We felt like idiots and decided to go home and just go to sleep so we did. But Anthony never made it home. We got the news at about 4 in the morning that day and Ive never felt worse in my entire life. 
3) Thats all Im writing for now, I will finish it up later"

"event","So Kim woke me up bright in early and I opened my door just long enough for her to throw a garbage bag of ""shit"" through the opening and she stormed away... I really dont understand her. If she said she didnt want to be with me, then shes supposed to not want to be with me. And if you are not with someone you are not supposed to care who they see or what they do. Then about 3 hours later her and her friend are at my door dropping off some more ""shit""... I didnt realize it but I had the biggest boner when I opened the door... who cares I was tired as hell. But anyways all of this doomed my day...  I sat on the ground and read every paper, looked at every photo, and just cried for a while realizing my failure. I had the best times of my life with kim, and it kinda just blows my mind everything that has happened lately and how quick things have disentigrated and swirled down the drain. Then when I saw davey bear and got so upset, it was like a thousand knives dug into my heart... I really wish things wouldnt have ended like this, but it seems like they kinda did.

"event","Well I dont think any of you get the idea of me... So I will try to explain myself as best as possible... 
Things I like the most---
1) Being able to just stay inside at the house and just ""hang out"" with someone you love (friendly or not) and have a genuinely good time.
2) Watching a movie while holding the hand of a girl I feel for... Especially at night time or when its raining.
3) Parking the car after going through a drive thru, especially in an empty lot, and listening to music while eating with someone I love (friendly or not). 
4) Laughing and making people laugh. 
5) Taking a second to sit back and count the stars
6) Expressing my emotions... especially through poetry which sets me free.... This also could mean performing a cartwheel in the middle of the mall just because you are happy...
7) CUDDLING!!! Probably my most favorite thing of all time... call me girl-ish.. i dont care.. I just love to do it... Its amazing how people can connect through intertwined fingers, or getting lost in anothers eyes...
8) Holding Hands and just smiling about it... 
9) Good old fashioned romanticism... like dropping roses off at a girls door, ringing the doorbell, and driving away as fast as possible... and somehow she always catches you doing it but doesnt say anything about catching you... Another Example would be all the little things, like cards, poems, or just leaving a note on her windsheild when u know where she is. 
10) HONEST ABE... whats the point in lying...??? If you are always honest, I will always respect everything you say
I think that list is fairly accurate for now... Here are some other things I like
Movie--- Billy Madison - I never laughed so hard in my entire laugh... first movie I ever completely memorized.. Van Wilder gives it a run for its money though.. I love Ryan Reynolds..
TV Show- Family Guy and American Dad-- I love humor.. These shows are just outrageous... the things they think of so random.. I love it. The OC is AWESOME!!! Adam Brody is the funniest guy ever and reminds me of my witty humor and rachel bilson is the most beautiful girl i have ever seen!
Food- NO FAST FOOD... I am anti fast food... I want to LIVE!!! haha.. A good Turkey Club with Swiss on a toasted bread never hurt anyone... And i love em! Nothing beats chicken marsala though.. my alltime favorite meal... especially from Carrabas!!!
Video Game- Super smash brothers--- Link and Ness are the shit...
Book-- Catcher in the Rye.. A CLASSIC!!!! The perks of being a wallflower is a close second though. 
Clothes- I like hollister-- Comfortable, stylish, funny, and affordable. 
Shoes- Circa... They last forever and never lose their beauty... haha I never thought I would say that about shoes.. I also like Nike Dunks the black and grey ones... but i never can find em.
My Ideal Girl--- Can I say Rachel Bilson... Probably about 5'2-5'6 Long brown hair, brown eyes, preferably tan, listens to everything I listen to... Check my music section... good sense of humor.. is romantic!...
Music--- The Spill Cannvas, Copeland, Anberlin, HelloGoodbye, InPassing, Story of the Year, Something Corporate, The starting line, the early november, underoath, dashboard, coheed and cambria, my chemical romance, taking back sunday, number one fan, the used, mae, straylight run, third eye blind, daphne loves derby, new found glory, fall out boy,"

"event","Hahaha... Laura just woke my ass up... and sams ghetto booty as well... yeaaa.. so Im bored as a peice of wood... (get it?) yea that was kinda lame... so Im gonna talk about god knows what here tonite... Im pretty fuckin tired of this whole EMO trend everyone is going through... For those people who think emo is listening to dashboard and wearing dickies and converse and playing acoustic guitar, that is the saddest, lamest thing I have ever heard. For those of you who die your hair black, and get the back packs that are strapped down to ur side and throw some pins on it and call urself emo, that is lame as well. You cant MAKE yourself emo... you just cant do it... you gotta be born with it... you gotta just be it... Black people cant be white... White people cant be black... You cant pick to be a boy or a girl (not counting plastic surgery)... You get the point.. you are either born with a quality or not... So I am pretty pissed off that a trait I have is being emulated by everyone on this damn Earth... Why cant people go back to trying to be black.. They figured out it just doesnt work.. Just like they will figure out about being emo... You are or you arent. Someone has to distinguish the genuine people from the artificial ""posers"". 
 Emo... is short for emotional... Meaning 
1.	Of or relating to emotion: an emotional illness; emotional crises. 
2.	Readily affected with or stirred by emotion: an emotional person who often weeps. 
3.	Arousing or intended to arouse the emotions: an emotional appeal. 
4.	Marked by or exhibiting emotion: an emotional farewell. 
You may notice that the adjective Emotional uses its root word a lot in its definition.. Emotion.. so heres that meaning too...
1. A mental state that arises spontaneously rather than through conscious effort and is often accompanied by physiological changes; a feeling: the emotions of joy, sorrow, reverence, hate, and love. 
2.	A state of mental agitation or disturbance: spoke unsteadily in a voice that betrayed his emotion. See Synonyms at feeling.
3.	The part of the consciousness that involves feeling; sensibility.
So hopefully you are getting my point... ?? 
To be emotional is to be full of feeling... So here are some real qualities that I feel are emotional based on personal experience...
1) Writing and Enjoying poetry (or songs), especially when you begin writing it in one mood and dive into that mood more and more as your writing progresses... Also especially if you cry while writing it and watch the tears smudge the ink and somehow think it makes the poem itself more magical.
2) Having an extreme interest in music, Especially music in which emotion is expressed greatly in, for example ""whining"" singing, or screaming singing. These are songs in which an emotion is stretched, making it EMOTIONAL... This love for music may even lead up to the playing of an instrument or even more than one in order to express your emotions
3) If you are emotional, your emotions dont really seem to be shallow at all, but instead deep... for example youre never just kinda sad.. but you cry easily and your mind goes off the deep end into this emotion. For example, if a girl doesnt call.. that could lead to crying in bed swearing no one will ever love you again, and being pretty sad about it for a while rather than being sad for 2 seconds and getting over it.
So do you KINDA get it... ??? To be Emotional is not something you can force upon yourself.. you either are or you are not. Check in next week for another lesson... in Romanticism... It tends to blend with Emotion."

When will I find someone
Who will like me for me
Who will like whats inside
Along with what they see
Who likes to take walks
And talk in the pouring rain
Who I tell my every feeling to
and likes me just the same
Who likes the sunset
Equally to the sunrise
Who sees more than green
When looking in my eyes
Who can lay back a second
Long enough to count the stars
Who likes holding hands and conversations
In parked cars
Who likes what I wear
And my heart thats on its sleeve
Who finds romance simply
From listening to me breathe
Who when I spill my heart out
Will listen and truly care
And finds something special
About my long brown hair
But who am I kidding?
No one ever will or could
No one is drawn to me
Im alone for good....

Saturday Night----  By Me also... DUH
Some cool friends are coming over
I havent seen in a while
Purple or pink shirt, wheres my beanie
Have to check my style
Hurry grab the trash
We gots to clean up quick
I put on some Hollister Fierce
And Grab my BIC
Careful not to cut myself
Oh shit they are here
Is everything set, got the booze
Fuck! We got no beer!
I see my old buddies
Hug and say Hi
Man they look great!
Slap in Family Guy..
Take a seat on the futon
Green like the incredible hulk
How do I look fat, slim
Im hoping kinda bulk 
We get reaquianted
Hit it off real nice
And me and tew go to Ceasars
To grab a slice
Backing up in her car
Look out below
We just hit that car...!
GO GO GO!!!! 
Come back to my place
Everyone loves the little house
Show off my family guy collection
And movie of Mighty Mouse
I hogged the whole bottle
Lightweight drinking Skyy
Everything is spinning 
I can fly I can fly!!!
Oh wait im not flying
Im passed out on the bed
Ashley is laughing at me
and my face turns red
Were hanging out laying down 
Watching the OC
Tew and George are there too
Hanging out with me
Me and Sam fall asleep
Time flashes by
I wake up, everyones gone
My head hurts like a bitch
I just want to die!"

"event","Well I wole up SUPER early to take a shower, eat some pop-tarts (strawberry frosted of course) and just give myself some time to wake up. I drank some TO (Mango Gatorade for those who arent inside on that one) on my way to school and listened to the spill canvas cd. And strolled into class at about 8:00... and to my surprise it was movie day... Wait a second... movie day... in college??? Oh well, its better than a boring lecture. I slept through a video of the history channels Modern Marvels of fucking clocks for gods sakes.... an hour on clocks... Whatever. So this is my break time until english comp 2... I should be reading chapter 4 but screw it... I own my english teacher. He is incredibly homo, and I wear pink and purple a lot... so he kinda got the wrong idea and REALLY likes me. Yea, scary. Who knows maybe if i let him touch my weiner I will get an A hahaha... just kidding!!! (or am I)???   haha.... well Im starving again... and my headache still hasnt been alleviated from saturday night... DAMN! alright guys... I will leave you with some bad ass quotes that I am really feeling right now... ---Davey---
* Shake down you make me break for goodness sake I think im on the edge... of somethin new with you .. (SOCO)
* The truth is that I found something new, and she easily towers over you... (SpillC)
* You got me down on my knees and I proclaim... all hail the heartbreaker... (SpillC)
PS--- I kept my side of the deal!!! Keep it going!"

"event","Sooo Welcome to my LJ I hope you like it, I brought this football so I could spike it, If you see me around at school, tell me that you thought it was kinda cool, My name is Davey and im hot and steamy... all the girls say... ""You so dreamy!""... haha and if you think I actually wrote that then you suck and dont listen to helloGOODBYE...which is like the coolest band to ever exist. Well its me... its me.. D-A-V-E!!! I finally got myself an LJ, even though myspace kicks LJ's ass!!!! Last nite I had a kick ASS time!!! Me and Sam were just chillin in the little house watchin the chronicles of riddick with that puss vin diesel when two ladies show up that I havent seen in a LONG LONG time, Ashley and Laura yayyyy... So for this reunion we busted open a bottle of skyy vodka and I downed that shit in some OJ. Im not quite sure what happened after that... I think we attempted to watch some porn, watched some family guy, then we decided we were hungry so Me and Tew went to Little Ceasars to get a hot-n-motherfuckin-ready. When we reversed from the drive-way that crazy woman came so close to hitting my huge concrete mailbox, which happens to be painted white so u can see it at nite, and then when we were backing up at L-Ceasars she nailed a fuckin car, and she was like what do I do, what do I do... amd being wasted as I was I screamed GO GO GO!!! hahaha... but her car was fine... its the other car I was worried about. Anyways we came back to the little house and some ohter girls came over... really cool girls named Kelly... Amanda... and Sara. Sara was the hottest of the three, and Amanda was the Cutest, and Kelly was the coolest!!! I figured out kelly was the coolest because I was drunk and not knowing what I was doing when i took a giant swig of Southern Comfort (I fuckin hate rum) and spit it out all over here... then i said Im sorry and she forgave me... so shes a cool cat! Then laura wanted to take a shower... I mean SHOT... with ashley... lol... then we turned on the OC... talked about Adam Brody and how fine he really was, while same oogled Ana's goodies... (we miss her on the OC) and we all kinda just passed out. I cant believe how many times I pissed that night... I mean not like leaks... like explosions! and my tongue went kinda numb and I think everyone was kinda pissed b/c I drank all the booze and no one else got wasted. Im a lightweight.. I mean.. i only weigh 125 pounds!!! But I still drank about the whole damn bottle... I feel like a dousche for doing that cuz Iw anted to be sober to talk to my buds ashes and laura... oh well, we had fun. And ashley likes only the coolest bands like straylight run, my chemical romance, and the spill canvas... which kicks ass... I havent asked her if she knows hellogoodbye though... Well Im kind of enjoying this being single thing... I feel free to do whatever I want... and I hope Kim feels the same way... well superbowl is on and all the good shit just popped out of the oven so i guess im gonna munch on some grindage in there. My ending will consist of this ""Bwaaaaahhhhhh!!!!"" which is the sound tim allen makes on home improvement ... you know.. that man grunt... BWAHHHHHH!!!   ----Davey-----

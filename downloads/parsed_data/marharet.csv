the urge to babble and rant a lot on FB has led me to come back here. 
also, it seems to be a bit more private these days as people have left one social networking site for another. 

i really did have things to say, but now when the time comes to write them, the words don't want to work. :/
until next time."

I could tell when you smile.
It's like I didn't need to say anything or do much, I could tell

All of the subatomic pieces come together and
unfold themselves in a second...
every single molecule is right, when
all of the subatomic pieces come together and unfold
themselves in a second..

"event","My heart and soul goes out to those in the Melbourne countryside. 

To those who have been displaced or are homeless. 
To those who are mourning the loss of friends, family and lost memories, and to those hoping and praying that their homes and their lives are safe from these devastating fires that are currently still going.. 

I hope that every person responsible for lighting the fires is caught, and punished severely. 
Unfortunately though, nothing they could ever be legally charged with would be a suitable punishment for what they have done. They, in my eyes, are Dead Men Walking. 

A customer said to my mum the other day that the arsonists responsible should be burned. Not to death, but like 75-80% of their body. That way they have to suffer with the pain and disfigurement for the rest of their lives, and hopefully from that they would know in some way how much sadness and sorrow they have caused to so many people. 

To my friends in LJ land. I ask you something now. I'm not a religious person, but i'm asking all of you, to pray, chant, worship, summon, beg, plead to all your gods, goddesses, alien beings, whoever.
Send your thoughts and energies to those who really need it right now, and also remember to ask for rain!


I'm so frustrated I can't be over there helping fight the fires. I have no training, but I'd fucking do it in a second. In 1983, my dad was with the Australian Army stationed in Pucka. Everyone stationed at his base was called in to help fight the Ash Wednesday fires. He did a great thing helping people, and now I really want to do the same thing. I can't handle sitting on my arse while an amazing part of Australia is suffering like it is. It's just not right.

Mainly at work... but like huh? has it recently become a popular again? i like the song so i'm not complaining, but just weird. lol


and, thanks Wiki....

""The 1980s saw Palmer find an increasing amount of commercial success. The album Clues, produced by Palmer and featuring Chris Frantz and <b>Gary Numan</b>, generated hits on both sides of the Atlantic, first with the radio-friendly single ""Johnny and Mary"" and then ""Looking for Clues"".""

Not a puppet or anything attempting to be non-human like, but a hand. And it's quite obvious too when you realise it's there. Also, when they looked at a clock, it was someone's wrist with a watch. 



Anthony Bourdain is my most favourite person on my foxtel weekends at the moment. 
The episode he did of New Jersey on No Reservations, which was on tonight, was funny as hell.
Skiing, and hunting down a teen at the same time becoz he knocked him down was hilarity. Eating at a fish place and ordering a grilled cheese sandwich to avoid food poisoning. Going loopy in an Asian market and buying things because they had happy cartoon characters on them.. There was also a milkbar/sushi place.. hmmmm

it has been a while indeed.

i went to melbs for a lovely holiday, and had a fucking awesome time seeing everyone, and chilling out and just having a wonderful time with friends! :)

passed uni with a Pass, a Distinction and a High Distinction for my photography assignment which can be found here.. http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=11031&id=717821027

can't be bothered making pretty links.... so tired.

christmas was nice! presents in the morning. sewing machine, electric frypan, printer supplies, fear and loathing in las vegas on dvd, bathroom scales... lunch with the family was prawns and lobster and salads and cherries!!.. chilled out for a few hours then went to hedge's place for chrismas dinner with his family.  :) got some awesome (red) converse shoes... kindly dubbed the Malaria shoes. Oprah and Bono know what they are!  :P they help people shoes.. and hedge made me a one of a kind edition of Epidemic! :D :D :D
i can't wait to sit down and read it all  :)

then we played pictionary!
hedge and i kicked some serious butt in Pictionary tonight tho it ate all my left over brain cells.  :P
we have also been banned from being anywhere near each other, being partners and actually guessing what the others are drawing next time we play... we are too good for our own good.  lol.. i love it!

now, i think i may retire with a cold shower and an ice pack under my pillow.."

"event","i awoke yesterday at about 9am... i had assignments to hand in at uni and i wanted to get it out of the way early so i could spend the rest of the day doing what i needed to do before my teaching prac this week.
at about 9.30, i heard this really loud knocking on the door. i think ""oh crap - someone has come to turn something off"", ei: gas, power, water.. i decided in my head not to answer the door and hope they will go away.
nope. the knocking got louder, and fearing they would wake my housemates i decide to face this person at my door, at 9.30am... 
i slowly crept up to the door, and ever so slowly turned the handle, pulling it open ever so little to peek at this person who is knocking at my chamber door.. lol  (corey insisted)

i look, and freaked out!
IT WAS MA HEDGEFACE BACK FROM THE ENG-LANDS AND SURPRISE!!! - HE WAS AT MY DOOR!! EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!! 
(that's the noise i actually made as well)
IT WAS MUCHO BIG SUPRISO!! :D and i turned into BLUBBERHEAD. i could not speak words in sentences, like now.  :P

daniel got a bit of a shock too when we dragged him out of bed to see who was here! heheh
so yes. the days plans changed rather rapidly, and i was very pleased to do it.  :D
we spent a little bit of time in the city, went to taka's, went to jackson's.. and then i had to leave for my parents place, mainly because of the heavy bags i was carrying around for the prac this week.

it spun me out. i just, really wasn't expecting him to show up at my door!

so here i sit at my parents on a thursday afternoon...
why is that you ask!?

I AM SICK! oh boy i haven't felt this shitty in a long time!
it kicked in monday, slight cough and headache... took a couple sudafed and lots of juice.. was feeling a little better when i went sleeps only to wake every hour to cough my lungs up. blergh. tuesday was a completely different story... asthma had kicked in and my breathing was absolute shit. i had never had a serious asthma problem and started to freak out a little when the ventolin wasn't working... 2 hours later and hyperventalating out the way, my breathing was still bad. my wonderful parents came and rescued me and brought me into the arms of the wonderful nebuliser. ahhhhh sweet air. lol

so i have been here since tuesday afternoon... full of drugs and mucho nasties creeping through my body.

went and saw a doc yesterday. he thought i may of had pnuemonia so checked me out completely. he told me i have serious asthma at the moment and a chest infection. i never had been diagnosed as asthmatic but yesterday he said i definately am one. the doc put me on antibiotics for the infection and steriods to help my lungs get better fast and help them to beat this all off. i take a nebuliser every four hours so i don't die from lack of oxygen (hahah) and have been taking a concoction of senega and ammonia to get all the wonderful crap out my lungs..

i haven't been to uni or to work all week, which worries me and makes my head stress.. 
brought all my readers home so at least i can be up to date with that.... and my sketchbook so i can start drawing ideas for photoshoots... 

i seriously hate being bed-bound. i feel like i am going a little mad. And, as i type this, i have a serious craving for a hot chicken roll.. mmmmmmmmmmmmmm


AND

HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MY DARLING LITTLE MUNCHKIN CHARLOTTE!! your growing up so fast, and i am sure your parents are feeling mighty old today too.. hehehe! I HOPE YOU HAVE LOTS OF FUN BEING 8!!"

i have seen Transformers and Tales From Earthsea... Transformers was just UberCool!! and TfE was good. :) i also bought myself The Editors - An End Has A Start which i really like... they are sorta a meshing of Interpol and Joy Division, if you like that sort of thing. :)

buhbye .          time       to         go       home         and      do               homework."

"event","last week, i treated myself to a couple new PS2 games. <b>EB Games</b> had a 2 for $50 deal so i grabbed myself Psychonauts and The Sims 2. what can i say, i'm a sucker for the sims.  :P
but it's been really awesome so far.. the new control method is way cooler than the classic style and the new options on interacting with people is way better. really happy with the changes they put into the gameplay and the style of interaction with objects/people. Just a warning to people tho - once you play the sims2 games, you can't go back to the classics.... they just don't cut it. (personal opinion only)  :P

<a href=""http://www.psychonauts.com/"">Psychonauts</a> was an awesome game when i played it a while  back, and i had been looking for a copy for a while... i'll give an opinion when i actually get some play time up. 

in DS world, i have been playing Lunar : Dragon Song. i started a while ago but didn't have the patience to repeat battle moves over and over again. being stoned and having free time gives me the chance to sit there and press A constantly without getting frustrated. so thanks to weed and uni holidays i have advanced a lot and managed to be strong enough to take out the  nasties and progress into the map some more. yay. was doing well before bed last night, but then that little light turned to red and it was time to put the little blue beast box down for a bit.

currently downloading the 2 dr who's in the new season. and i got the new nine inch nails album and the new bright eyes album.  i'm a bad little consumer. don't worry boys, you'll eventually get all my monies.

one more week of holidays. plan to start an assignment some time this week and have another finished before term comes back. go team Lauren. 

to those people that care.... because i am not online as much as i used to be.. like at all anymore.. please write me emails or something.  i miss not being able to have contact with people anymore, yes some more than others. :P but yeah... write me something!! :P"

BDO was pretty okay. the new 'D' section really pissed me off!
was waiting for an hour and a half to be let in only to be told no one else was being let in.... and this was at 5.45pm, 3 and a half hours before the main band was due on stage! that was absolute shit.

seeing TOOL was just FANTASTIC tho!! those boys rock so hard and even if i couldn't see everything, they were still an experience! seeing PEACHES was awesome! She was rocking, esp with the band!  also saw The Sleepy Jackson, The Butterfly Effect and Muse... 
got a little sunburnt, no more than usual.. all brown now tho.
bought a crazy pair of sunnies while i was there too.. hehehe... they have fake little indented diamonds on the sides. hahaha so tacky! i love them! ;P

university starts in a couple weeks... will be finalising my enrolment on Tuesday because i am having trouble doing it via the internet... something keeps popping up and i am not sure what it means so its best at this point to get help from someone who knows what i am required to do..

gabe is all healed up and back to his normal self.

wanting to go see YO LA TENGO next fortnight. :D wheeeeee!

new icon. i know he makes ipod users sad coz he means you have a sick ipod, but he is just too cute to ignore.

"event","wednesday saw Gabe having surgery at the vet. he woke up in the morning with a large abcess on his left jaw/cheek. we took him straight in, after getting my housemate to call the vet becoz i was freaking out a bit. she checked him out, took his temp (which came with much purring :/ ) and shaved the fur on the abcess to check  for a wound. didnt find anything but we decided it was too big and we wanted it gone the easy way. an operation and $285 later he is out of the vet, with a drain in his cheek to drain the last of the fluid out. turns out he had a puncture on the inside of his mouth which then became infected and caused the abcess. 
he was so high on ketamine when we got him home, he kept wobbling when he walked about and kept falling asleep if he sat. he was such a sweetie.. he has been really well behaved through getting his medicine and having his drain flushed out every day since.. dan and vic have also been a great help, when it came to holding him down and distracting him. :)
today we went into the vet and had the drain taken out. she clipped off the stitches, grabbed the drain with tweezers and pulled it out. just like that. she then flushed it and cleaned it and he was ready to go home again. in a few days the wounds should scab up and he can go back outside once again.. :)
i'm so glad he is ok. i was so worried and freaked out when it first happened, mainly because i didn't have the money... but in the end it all turned out ok and i have a healthy cat again! :D


apart from that, things have been ok.. 
just waiting for work to come back and waiting to see if i got into uni.
we find out on the 17th of Jan, so fingers crossed i get what i want. :)
and then i get to see ms NEKO CASE on Jan 26th! I CAN'T WAIT! :D

be good ya'll.  :)"

hair straightener, toasted sammich maker, slow cooker, ipod nano (named Bug), a bigger birdcage and other little bits n pieces, and a flaming lips cd from Dan&Vic!

had a little win on lotto last night. $27.50 or something close to that. last division. enough to get me through the rest of the week.. :)

its been a while since i have updated, but here i am in Bridgetown...
came down with Lynsey and Adrian to check out the festivities surrounding the wonderful <b>Bridgetown Blues Festival. </b> :D
the place is so alive, and you can hear the music everywhere you are.
we sit in the backyard, with a drink and a cone and listen away to our content.

we went down to the HUGE street fair today. it was awesome.
i took heaps of photos and bought some bits and bobs..
*a lapis and silver ring.
*lavendar healing balm.  (smells awesome)
*eucalyptus candy and reeces peanut butter cups.

we ate lunch and watched this great little band play on the street. they were a electric violin and acoustic guitar combo. male and female vocal. sounded fantastic. i plan to head back down later on and buy their cd.... so i hope anyway.
if i cant find it down there, i will have to keep an eye out in perth.

where we are staying, with Lynsey and Adrians dad... they have these 2 cute little dogs, and they both like me and give me kisses and they have chickens! CHICKENS! hhehhehe..  they are giving me hours of entertainment alone. 
on the train ride down, i saw HEAPS of COWS.    heheh. woo!

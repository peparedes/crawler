"event","wow ... it's been a while since i wrote. i tried writtin in quebec, but it wouldn't let me. 
<br>
so anyways. quebec was fun. there was this kid in the gameroom named howser. he played like a girl ... i don't know why though ... you'd have to ask his friends. yea .... and we won some of our games. our first game, we lost (against girls) then we lost again i think ... then we won a couple ... lost and thought we were going home ... but we still qualified. the refs sucked, so mr .... i donno ... grandpa ferill (sp?) offered the ref his glasses so that he could see better. it was quite funni. but we lost in the .... semi-finals i think ... to the really good czech team. so then we went home. but it was a lot of fun. the thing is, i had so much homework and stuff to make up that i dont think i'd go to quebec ever again. 
<br>
i got back and i had to make a bunch of stuff up, but i'm already done doin that. school is pretty boring ... but spring break starts after tomorrow, so it's ok. on saturday and sunday i am planning on doing absolutely nothing and sleeping in. then monday i might do something ... maybe with lauren ... i'll have to ask her ... and then tuesday i gotta go to the dentist cause they hate me. wednesday i'm goin to the mall with alexis and we're gonna buy stuff. i'm gonna get brittani her birthday present. (love spell stuff from victoria's secret) and im gonna see if i can get new shoes. i like laura's etnies (blue and white), so maybe i'll get some pink and white ones ... or i might get black and hott pink vans... cause they look cool. haha. thursday i'm gonna get my hair cut. i'm not sure how yet. i like how laura had hers cut ... so maybe something a little like that ... but i was thinkin that i wanted it like shoulder length (a little shorter than it is now)and like .... layered. then friday is good friday ... and then its saturday and sunday is easter. on monday i have off ... and tuesday i go back to school. i've been takin driver's ed cause i'm cool like that. i can drive up and down my driveway! woot! i'm so incredibly proud of myself. ... cause im that much of a dork. haha.
<br>
last weekend we were in a tournament. i saw the quinns, sailors, desimones (i even got michael to buy me a water .. but i gave him a dollar so that he wouldnt have to use his money), and we played the ice dogs (kenny orlando, ben hankinson, ... and some other kids) and the devils (colt, eddie, and a whole mess of other people that i cannot remember right now)and we won and lost and tied and lost ... so thats not good. so we didnt win. then i went to lauren's cousins (courtney) house. she was havin her 8 (?) birthday party. she had like five people spend the night. me, lauren, mindy, and sam were watchin them. they were so bratty its not even funni. this one girl was sassin lauren. she was like ""this is too small, i cant sleep here"" and lauren was like ""you're not fat, you can fit there"" and she was like ""well my pillow's upside down"" so lauren was like ""so fix it"" and the girl told her no so lauren told her not to get smart and the girl was like ""well what if i want to?"" and lauren was like ""if you're gonna get smart with me, i'll call your  mom and tell her to come pick you up right now because youre being a brat"" and the girl started to cry. she was like .... hysterical cryin. it was soooo funni. i felt a little sorry for her, but it was still really really funni. and that girl ended up cryin like five other times. so yea. haha.
<br>
kevin's tryin out for guy geaudreaus (sp?) tournament team. bobby campbell, dougie rose, taylor olson, brett perrine, brett lisewski, and of course johnny and matty geaudreau are tryin out, sorry if i forgot someone. i have a good feelin that he'll make it. which is good. i guess. he's tryin out for the jr. flyers too. i hope mo makes it too, so that me and lauren can hang out again. :) i think the whole team plus a bunch of other people ... but not robert ... are tryin out, so we'll see what happens.
<br>
upcomming birthdays: mine is on april 7th, bri's is on april 6th, col's is on april 25, britt's is on march ... 26?, pete's is sometime soon ... march 27, i think ... i dont think i'm gonna have a birthday party, so everyone stop askin me when it is. hmmmmmmm. yea. o and sorry if i forgot your birthday.
<br>
ok, i think thats it! woah, thats a lot! okie dokie. well i'll try and update more. haha

"event","wow, ok. so it's after school now! lets see ... i was runnin a little late this morning ... just cause i was tired. so i got to school, and had to finish like all of my chem homework, cause i was too lazy to do it over the three day weekend. lol. then in chem, i found out that i did half of my homework wrong anyway ... which is ok, cause then i fixed it. and i had a double chem period (which i almost forgot about) so that was fun :woot: ... but i'm just kidding. haha. so then our student teacher was teaching us ... something for a little while ... it took him a while to realize that in order for us to understand something .. we need it written on the board ... cause we're that stupid. haha. so yea, then i had english! didnt really study the vocab ... but i think i did really good on the test anyways ... at least i hope i did really good on the test. then i had computer class ... ray didnt know what to do ... again ... and i kinda just guessed ... cause i was really tired ... and didnt really know what i was doing either. hah. then history ... the test was hard .. and i think i failed it... that pretty much sums up that period. then i went to my locker. pete called me a dyke then said ""just kidding, you know you love me"" and i was like ""you know what pete, i do love you"" but i was just kidding ... cause i really dont. then in math, we reviewed, and i really didnt pay attention much. in gym we went to the fitness gym ! woot ! fun stuff ... no i'm just kidding again. hmm. i was just kidding a lot so far... haha. sam's home from florida. and she had fun. i'm so jealous... i'm not even ... messin. HAHAH LAUREN !!! and now i'm talkin to laura, dorky freak gloria's gym shorts werent working very well today apparently ... and laura had to wear them. so she is quite upset about it. and we were just disscussing that i am a size 3 and not a size 7 anymore ! woot !!!! thats good stuff. everyone should congratulate me. hehe. lauren got my Friends walet and even though i don't use walet's, its Friends, so you know i'll use it. I'll put my Joey Driver's Liscense in it that Coll gave me. <3 i miss ya colleen marie rannels <3 annnnnd me and lauren are gonna go to the gym later. woot!

"event","hey. it's monday night ... the weekends over. mikkel was cool last night ... the only flaw i could find is that HE LIKES THE DEVILS !!! errr. it makes me mad. but he made up for it by saying that he likes to watch Friends ... but still ... that devils thing is gonna bother me. so yea, ok. i got up this morning, took a shower and talked to people!! woot. (people = laura, lauren, coll, britt (swartz and larsen), tyler, priyanka, and hannah) laura is helping me out, tyler likes to bother me, and hannah is no longer going to my school. so i put my hair up really pretty today, but i dont think i'll be able to do it tomorrow :( ... lauren made me a bunch of pretty layouts for my lj... including this Friends one. hehe. <3 ya! and i watched Friends for two hours straight ... the one where Ross has white teeth .. the one with Rachel's triffle .. the one with Pottery Barn .. annnndddd .. i cant remember the other one :(  so yea ... thats it. i did some homework ... and now i'm gonna go to bed.

"event","heyy. ok, so yesterday was fun. i woke up at like two beacuse i was finish laura's present really late at night, then we went to the Little Flyers game. they beat Mercer like 5-2. i hung out with Laura, Alexis, Kate, McKenzie, Claudia, AnnaMarie, and Mel. the only people that werent there were Dave and Gabby. what losers ... only not Gabby. ... she's still cool. lol. so we looked at the present i gave to Laura and she kept sayin "" O yea ! "" and "" I remember that ! "" lol. then we all exchanged cell numbers cause Alexis and Kate got cell's and i needed their numbers. so yea, then i went to say hi to the parents. then after the game i took pictures of all the boys (bobby, doug, billy, taylor, tyler, quigs .. i think thats it)and we all went to Pizza Hut across the street (us, the Rose's, the Campbell's, the Manuella's, and McKenzie and Taylor). but then we had to leave early cause Kevin had a game. so then we went to Kevin's game, and we were six minutes late, so they were gonna bench him, but then he did good in warm up, so they let him play, and he got the first goal ... but i think like everyone got at least one goal cause it ended up bein like 16-2. lol. we played the caps. i was gonna do the cheer, but the lady didnt say "" C A P S "" so i couldnt say "" suck suck suck "" haha, funn times. and i saw some people from school at the game ... aaron and pete .. good times. and then lauren spent the night at my house and we watched Friends. it took me an hour to figure out how to use the dvd player on the computer though. lol. so we only watched like four episodes. good enough though. lol. then we went to bed and got up in the morning. and walked molly which was fun. we got to the game with literally like five minutes left. lol. but it doesnt matter cause we beat the caps again ... they really do suck. lol. then i got home and actually watched the Eagles game ... they beat the Vikings like 27-14. that third touch down was amazing. lol. later tonight Mikkel's commin over to spend the night. can't wait ! woot ! lol.

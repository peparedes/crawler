Long ago, at least two thousand years, there was a rich man who had a beautiful and pious wife, and they loved each other dearly. However, they had no children, though they wished very much to have some, and the woman prayed for them day and night, but they didn't get any, and they didn't get any. 

In front of their house there was a courtyard where there stood a juniper tree. One day in winter the woman was standing beneath it, peeling herself an apple, and while she was thus peeling the apple, she cut her finger, and the blood fell into the snow.

""Oh,"" said the woman. She sighed heavily, looked at the blood before her, and was most unhappy. ""If only I had a child as red as blood and as white as snow."" And as she said that, she became quite contented, and felt sure that it was going to happen. 

Then she went into the house, and a month went by, and the snow was gone. And two months, and everything was green. And three months, and all the flowers came out of the earth. And four months, and all the trees in the woods grew thicker, and the green branches were all entwined in one another, and the birds sang until the woods resounded and the blossoms fell from the trees. Then the fifth month passed, and she stood beneath the juniper tree, which smelled so sweet that her heart jumped for joy, and she fell on her knees and was beside herself. And when the sixth month was over, the fruit was thick and large, and then she was quite still. And after the seventh month she picked the juniper berries and ate them greedily. Then she grew sick and sorrowful. Then the eighth month passed, and she called her husband to her, and cried, and said, ""If I die, then bury me beneath the juniper tree."" Then she was quite comforted and happy until the next month was over, and then she had a child as white as snow and as red as blood, and when she saw it, she was so happy that she died.

Her husband buried her beneath the juniper tree, and he began to cry bitterly. After some time he was more at ease, and although he still cried, he could bear it. And some time later he took another wife.

He had a daughter by the second wife, but the first wife's child was a little son, and he was as red as blood and as white as snow. When the woman looked at her daughter, she loved her very much, but then she looked at the little boy, and it pierced her heart, for she thought that he would always stand in her way, and she was always thinking how she could get the entire inheritance for her daughter. And the Evil One filled her mind with this until she grew very angry with the little boy, and she pushed him from one corner to the other and slapped him here and cuffed him there, until the poor child was always afraid, for when he came home from school there was nowhere he could find any peace.

One day the woman had gone upstairs to her room, when her little daughter came up too, and said, ""Mother, give me an apple.""

""Yes, my child,"" said the woman, and gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest. The chest had a large heavy lid with a large sharp iron lock. 

""Mother,"" said the little daughter, ""is brother not to have one too?"" 

This made the woman angry, but she said, ""Yes, when he comes home from school."" 

When from the window she saw him coming, it was as though the Evil One came over her, and she grabbed the apple and took it away from her daughter, saying, ""You shall not have one before your brother.""

She threw the apple into the chest, and shut it. Then the little boy came in the door, and the Evil One made her say to him kindly, ""My son, do you want an apple?"" And she looked at him fiercely. 

""Mother,"" said the little boy, ""how angry you look. Yes, give me an apple.""

Then it seemed to her as if she had to persuade him. ""Come with me,"" she said, opening the lid of the chest. ""Take out an apple for yourself."" And while the little boy was leaning over, the Evil One prompted her, and crash! she slammed down the lid, and his head flew off, falling among the red apples. 

Then fear overcame her, and she thought, ""Maybe I can get out of this."" So she went upstairs to her room to her chest of drawers, and took a white scarf out of the top drawer, and set the head on the neck again, tying the scarf around it so that nothing could be seen. Then she set him on a chair in front of the door and put the apple in his hand.

After this Marlene came into the kitchen to her mother, who was standing by the fire with a pot of hot water before her which she was stirring around and around. 

""Mother,"" said Marlene, ""brother is sitting at the door, and he looks totally white and has an apple in his hand. I asked him to give me the apple, but he did not answer me, and I was very frightened."" 

""Go back to him,"" said her mother, ""and if he will not answer you, then box his ears."" 

So Marlene went to him and said, ""Brother, give me the apple."" But he was silent, so she gave him one on the ear, and his head fell off. Marlene was terrified, and began crying and screaming, and ran to her mother, and said, ""Oh, mother, I have knocked my brother's head off,"" and she cried and cried and could not be comforted. 

""Marlene,"" said the mother, ""what have you done? Be quiet and don't let anyone know about it. It cannot be helped now. We will cook him into stew."" 

Then the mother took the little boy and chopped him in pieces, put him into the pot, and cooked him into stew. But Marlene stood by crying and crying, and all her tears fell into the pot, and they did not need any salt.

Then the father came home, and sat down at the table and said, ""Where is my son?"" And the mother served up a large, large dish of stew, and Marlene cried and could not stop. 

Then the father said again, ""Where is my son?"" 

""Oh,"" said the mother, ""he has gone across the country to his mother's great uncle. He will stay there awhile."" 

""What is he doing there? He did not even say good-bye to me.""

""Oh, he wanted to go, and asked me if he could stay six weeks. He will be well taken care of there."" 

""Oh,"" said the man, ""I am unhappy. It isn't right. He should have said good-bye to me."" With that he began to eat, saying, ""Marlene, why are you crying? Your brother will certainly come back."" 

Then he said, ""Wife, this food is delicious. Give me some more."" And the more he ate the more he wanted, and he said, ""Give me some more. You two shall have none of it. It seems to me as if it were all mine."" And he ate and ate, throwing all the bones under the table, until he had finished it all. 

Marlene went to her chest of drawers, took her best silk scarf from the bottom drawer, and gathered all the bones from beneath the table and tied them up in her silk scarf, then carried them outside the door, crying tears of blood. 

She laid them down beneath the juniper tree on the green grass, and after she had put them there, she suddenly felt better and did not cry anymore. 

Then the juniper tree began to move. The branches moved apart, then moved together again, just as if someone were rejoicing and clapping his hands. At the same time a mist seemed to rise from the tree, and in the center of this mist it burned like a fire, and a beautiful bird flew out of the fire singing magnificently, and it flew high into the air, and when it was gone, the juniper tree was just as it had been before, and the cloth with the bones was no longer there. Marlene, however, was as happy and contented as if her brother were still alive. And she went merrily into the house, sat down at the table, and ate.

Then the bird flew away and lit on a goldsmith's house, and began to sing:

My mother, she killed me,
My father, he ate me,
My sister Marlene,
Gathered all my bones,
Tied them in a silken scarf,
Laid them beneath the juniper tree,
Tweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I.
The goldsmith was sitting in his workshop making a golden chain, when he heard the bird sitting on his roof and singing. The song seemed very beautiful to him. He stood up, but as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his slippers. However, he went right up the middle of the street with only one slipper and one sock on. He had his leather apron on, and in one hand he had a golden chain and in the other his tongs. The sun was shining brightly on the street. 

He walked onward, then stood still and said to the bird, ""Bird,"" he said, ""how beautifully you can sing. Sing that piece again for me."" 

""No,"" said the bird, ""I do not sing twice for nothing. Give me the golden chain, and then I will sing it again for you."" 

The goldsmith said, ""Here is the golden chain for you. Now sing that song again for me."" Then the bird came and took the golden chain in his right claw, and went and sat in front of the goldsmith, and sang:

My mother, she killed me,
My father, he ate me,
My sister Marlene,
Gathered all my bones,
Tied them in a silken scarf,
Laid them beneath the juniper tree,
Tweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I.
Then the bird flew away to a shoemaker, and lit on his roof and sang:

My mother, she killed me,
My father, he ate me,
My sister Marlene,
Gathered all my bones,
Tied them in a silken scarf,
Laid them beneath the juniper tree,
Tweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I.
Hearing this, the shoemaker ran out of doors in his shirtsleeves, and looked up at his roof, and had to hold his hand in front of his eyes to keep the sun from blinding him. ""Bird,"" said he, ""how beautifully you can sing."" 

Then he called in at his door, ""Wife, come outside. There is a bird here. Look at this bird. He certainly can sing."" Then he called his daughter and her children, and the journeyman, and the apprentice, and the maid, and they all came out into the street and looked at the bird and saw how beautiful he was, and what fine red and green feathers he had, and how his neck was like pure gold, and how his eyes shone like stars in his head. 

""Bird,"" said the shoemaker, ""now sing that song again for me."" 

""No,"" said the bird, ""I do not sing twice for nothing. You must give me something."" 

""Wife,"" said the man, ""go into the shop. There is a pair of red shoes on the top shelf. Bring them down."" Then the wife went and brought the shoes. 

""There, bird,"" said the man, ""now sing that piece again for me."" Then the bird came and took the shoes in his left claw, and flew back to the roof, and sang:

My mother, she killed me,
My father, he ate me,
My sister Marlene,
Gathered all my bones,
Tied them in a silken scarf,
Laid them beneath the juniper tree,
Tweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I.
When he had finished his song he flew away. In his right claw he had the chain and in his left one the shoes. He flew far away to a mill, and the mill went clickety-clack, clickety-clack, clickety-clack. In the mill sat twenty miller's apprentices cutting a stone, and chiseling chip-chop, chip-chop, chip-chop. And the mill went clickety-clack, clickety-clack, clickety-clack. 

Then the bird went and sat on a linden tree which stood in front of the mill, and sang:

My mother, she killed me,
Then one of them stopped working.

My father, he ate me,
Then two more stopped working and listened,

My sister Marlene,
Then four more stopped,

Gathered all my bones,
Tied them in a silken scarf,
Now only eight only were chiseling,

Laid them beneath
Now only five,

the juniper tree,
Now only one,

Tweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I.
Then the last one stopped also, and heard the last words. ""Bird,"" said he, ""how beautifully you sing. Let me hear that too. Sing it once more for me.""

""No,"" said the bird, ""I do not sing twice for nothing. Give me the millstone, and then I will sing it again.""

""Yes,"" he said, ""if it belonged only to me, you should have it."" 

""Yes,"" said the others, ""if he sings again he can have it."" 

Then the bird came down, and the twenty millers took a beam and lifted the stone up. Yo-heave-ho! Yo-heave-ho! Yo-heave-ho! 

The bird stuck his neck through the hole and put the stone on as if it were a collar, then flew to the tree again, and sang:

My mother, she killed me,
My father, he ate me,
My sister Marlene,
Gathered all my bones,
Tied them in a silken scarf,
Laid them beneath the juniper tree,
Tweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I.
When he was finished singing, he spread his wings, and in his right claw he had the chain, and in his left one the shoes, and around his neck the millstone. He flew far away to his father's house.

In the room the father, the mother, and Marlene were sitting at the table. 

The father said, ""I feel so contented. I am so happy."" 

""Not I,"" said the mother, ""I feel uneasy, just as if a bad storm were coming."" 

But Marlene just sat and cried and cried.

Then the bird flew up, and as it seated itself on the roof, the father said, ""Oh, I feel so truly happy, and the sun is shining so beautifully outside. I feel as if I were about to see some old acquaintance again."" 

""Not I,"" said the woman, ""I am so afraid that my teeth are chattering, and I feel like I have fire in my veins."" And she tore open her bodice even more. Marlene sat in a corner crying. She held a handkerchief before her eyes and cried until it was wet clear through. 

Then the bird seated itself on the juniper tree, and sang:

My mother, she killed me,
The mother stopped her ears and shut her eyes, not wanting to see or hear, but there was a roaring in her ears like the fiercest storm, and her eyes burned and flashed like lightning.

My father, he ate me, 
""Oh, mother,"" said the man, ""that is a beautiful bird. He is singing so splendidly, and the sun is shining so warmly, and it smells like pure cinnamon.""

My sister Marlene,
Then Marlene laid her head on her knees and cried and cried, but the man said, ""I am going out. I must see the bird up close."" 

""Oh, don't go,"" said the woman, ""I feel as if the whole house were shaking and on fire."" 

But the man went out and looked at the bird.

Gathered all my bones,
Tied them in a silken scarf,
Laid them beneath the juniper tree,
Tweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I.
With this the bird dropped the golden chain, and it fell right around the man's neck, so exactly around it that it fit beautifully. Then the man went in and said, ""Just look what a beautiful bird that is, and what a beautiful golden chain he has given me, and how nice it looks."" 

But the woman was terrified. She fell down on the floor in the room, and her cap fell off her head. Then the bird sang once more:

My mother killed me. 
""I wish I were a thousand fathoms beneath the earth, so I would not have to hear that!""

My father, he ate me, 
Then the woman fell down as if she were dead.

My sister Marlene, 
""Oh,"" said Marlene, ""I too will go out and see if the bird will give me something."" Then she went out.

Gathered all my bones,
Tied them in a silken scarf, 
He threw the shoes down to her.

Laid them beneath the juniper tree,
Tweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I.
Then she was contented and happy. She put on the new red shoes and danced and leaped into the house. ""Oh,"" she said, ""I was so sad when I went out and now I am so contented. That is a splendid bird, he has given me a pair of red shoes."" 

""No,"" said the woman, jumping to her feet and with her hair standing up like flames of fire, ""I feel as if the world were coming to an end. I too, will go out and see if it makes me feel better."" 

And as she went out the door, crash! the bird threw the millstone on her head, and it crushed her to death.

The father and Marlene heard it and went out. Smoke, flames, and fire were rising from the place, and when that was over, the little brother was standing there, and he took his father and Marlene by the hand, and all three were very happy, and they went into the house, sat down at the table, and ate.

There was once upon a time an old queen whose husband had been dead for many years, and she had a beautiful daughter. When the princess grew up she was betrothed to a prince who lived at a great distance. When the time came for her to be married, and she had to journey forth into the distant kingdom, the aged queen packed up for her many costly vessels of silver and gold, and trinkets also of gold and silver, and cups and jewels, in short, everything which appertained to a royal dowry, for she loved her child with all her heart. 

She likewise sent her maid-in-waiting, who was to ride with her, and hand her over to the bridegroom, and each had a horse for the journey, but the horse of the king's daughter was called Falada, and could speak. So when the hour of parting had come, the aged mother went into her bedroom, took a small knife and cut her finger with it until it bled. Then she held a white handkerchief to it into which she let three drops of blood fall, gave it to her daughter and said, ""Dear child, preserve this carefully, it will be of service to you on your way."" 

So they took a sorrowful leave of each other, the princess put the piece of cloth in her bosom, mounted her horse, and then went away to her bridegroom. 

After she had ridden for a while she felt a burning thirst, and said to her waiting-maid, ""Dismount, and take my cup which you have brought with you for me, and get me some water from the stream, for I should like to drink."" 

""If you are thirsty"", said the waiting-maid, ""get off your horse yourself, and lie down and drink out of the water, I don't choose to be your servant."" 

So in her great thirst the princess alighted, bent down over the water in the stream and drank, and was not allowed to drink out of the golden cup. Then she said, ""Ah, heaven,"" and the three drops of blood answered, 


""If this your mother knew,
her heart would break in two."" 

But the king's daughter was humble, said nothing, and mounted her horse again. She rode some miles further, but the day was warm, the sun scorched her, and she was thirsty once more, and when they came to a stream of water, she again cried to her waiting-maid, ""Dismount, and give me some water in my golden cup,"" for she had long ago forgotten the girl's ill words. 

But the waiting-maid said still more haughtily, ""If you wish to drink, get it yourself, I don't choose to be your maid."" Then in her great thirst the king's daughter alighted, bent over the flowing stream, wept and said, ""Ah, heaven,"" and the drops of blood again replied, 


""If this your mother knew,
her heart would break in two."" 

And as she was thus drinking and leaning right over the stream, the handkerchief with the three drops of blood fell out of her bosom, and floated away with the water without her observing it, so great was her trouble. The waiting-maid, however, had seen it, and she rejoiced to think that she had now power over the bride, for since the princess had lost the drops of blood, she had become weak and powerless. 

So now when she wanted to mount her horse again, the one that was called Falada, the waiting-maid said, ""Falada is more suitable for me, and my nag will do for you,"" and the princess had to be content with that. Then the waiting-maid, with many hard words, bade the princess exchange her royal apparel for her own shabby clothes, and at length she was compelled to swear by the clear sky above her, that she would not say one word of this to anyone at the royal court, and if she had not taken this oath she would have been killed on the spot. But Falada saw all this, and observed it well. 

The waiting-maid now mounted Falada, and the true bride the bad horse, and thus they traveled onwards, until at length they entered the royal palace. There were great rejoicings over her arrival, and the prince sprang forward to meet her, lifted the waiting-maid from her horse, and thought she was his consort. She was conducted upstairs, but the real princess was left standing below. Then the old king looked out of the window and saw her standing in the courtyard, and noticed how dainty and delicate and beautiful she was, and instantly went to the royal apartment, and asked the bride about the girl she had with her who was standing down below in the courtyard, and who she was. ""I picked her up on my way for a companion, give the girl something to work at, that she may not stand idle."" But the old king had no work for her, and knew of none, so he said, ""I have a little boy who tends the geese, she may help him."" The boy was called Conrad, and the true bride had to help him to tend the geese. 

Soon afterwards the false bride said to the young king, ""Dearest husband, I beg you to do me a favor."" 

He answered, ""I will do so most willingly."" 

""Then send for the knacker, and have the head of the horse on which I rode here cut off, for it vexed me on the way."" In reality, she was afraid that the horse might tell how she had behaved to the king's daughter. 

Then she succeeded in making the king promise that it should be done, and the faithful Falada was to die, this came to the ears of the real princess, and she secretly promised to pay the knacker a piece of gold if he would perform a small service for her. There was a great dark-looking gateway in the town, through which morning and evening she had to pass with the geese, would he be so goood as to nail up Falada's head on it, so that she might see him again, more than once. The knacker's man promised to do that, and cut off the head, and nailed it fast beneath the dark gateway. 

Early in the morning, when she and Conrad drove out their flock beneath this gateway, she said in passing, 


""Alas, Falada, hanging there."" 

Then the head answered, 


""Alas, young queen, how ill you fare.
If this your mother knew
Her heart would break in two."" 

Then they went still further out of the town, and drove their geese into the country. And when they had come to the meadow, she sat down and unbound her hair which was like pure gold, and Conrad saw it and delighted in its brightness, and wanted to pluck out a few hairs. Then she said, 


""Blow, blow, thou gentle wind, I say,
Blow Conrad's little hat away,
And make him chase it here and there,
Until I have braided all my hair,
And bound it up again."" 

And there came such a violent wind that it blew Conrad's hat far away across country, and he was forced to run after it. When he came back she had finished combing her hair and was putting it up again, and he could not get any of it. Then Conrad was angry, and would not speak to her, and thus they watched the geese until the evening, and then they went home. 

Next day when they were driving the geese out through the dark gateway, the maiden said, 


""Alas, Falada, hanging there."" 

Falada answered, 


""Alas, young queen, how ill you fare.
If this your mother knew
Her heart would break in two."" 

And she sat down again in the field and began to comb out her hair, and Conrad ran and tried to clutch it, so she said in haste, 


""Blow, blow, thou gentle wind, I say,
Blow Conrad's little hat away,
And make him chase it here and there,
Until I have braided all my hair,
And bound it up again."" 

Then the wind blew, and blew his little hat off his head and far away, and Conrad was forced to run after it, and when he came back, her hair had been put up a long time, and he could get none of it, and so they looked after their geese till evening came. 

But in the evening after they had got home, Conrad went to the old king, and said, ""I won't tend the geese with that girl any longer."" 

""Why not?"" inquired the aged king. 

""Oh, because she vexes me the whole day long."" 

Then the aged king commanded him to relate what it was that she did to him. 

And Conrad said, ""In the morning when we pass beneath the dark gateway with the block, there is a horse's head on the wall, and she says to it 


""'Alas, Falada, hanging there.' 

""And the head answers, 


""'Alas, young queen, how ill you fare.
If this your mother knew
Her heart would break in two.'"" 

And Conrad went on to relate what happened on the goose pasture, and how when there he had to chase his hat. 

The aged king commanded him to drive his flock out again next day, and as soon as morning came, he placed himself behind the dark gateway, and heard how the maiden spoke to the head of Falada, and then he too went into the country, and hid himself in the thicket in the meadow. There he soon saw with his own eyes the goose-girl and the goose-boy bringing their flock, and how after a while she sat down and unplaited her hair, which shone with radiance. And soon she said, 


""Blow, blow, thou gentle wind, I say,
Blow Conrad's little hat away,
And make him chase it here and there,
Until I have braided all my hair,
And bound it up again."" 

Then came a blast of wind and carried off Conrad's hat, so that he had to run far away, while the maiden quietly went on combing and plaiting her hair, all of which the king observed. Then, quite unseen, he went away, and when the goose-girl came home in the evening, he called her aside, and asked why she did all these things. 

""I may not tell that, and I dare not lament my sorrows to any human being, for I have sworn not to do so by the heaven which is above me, if I had not done that, I should have lost my life."" 

He urged her and left her no peace, but he could draw nothing from her. Then said he, ""If you will not tell me anything, tell your sorrows to the iron-stove there,"" and he went away. 

Then she crept into the iron-stove, and began to weep and lament, and emptied her whole heart, and said, ""Here am I deserted by the whole world, and yet I am a king's daughter, and a false waiting-maid has by force brought me to such a pass that I have been compelled to put off my royal apparel, and she has taken my place with my bridegroom, and I have to perform menial service as a goose-girl. If this my mother knew, her heart would break in two."" 

The aged king, however, was standing outside by the pipe of the stove, and was listening to what she said, and heard it. Then he came back again, and bade her come out of the stove. And royal garments were placed on her, and it was marvellous how beautiful she was. The aged king summoned his son, and revealed to him that he had got the false bride who was only a waiting-maid, but that the true one was standing there, as the former goose-girl. The young king rejoiced with all his heart when he saw her beauty and youth, and a great feast was made ready to which all the people and all good friends were invited. 

At the head of the table sat the bridegroom with the king's daughter at one side of him, and the waiting-maid on the other, but the waiting-maid was blinded, and did not recognize the princess in her dazzling array. When they had eaten and drunk, and were merry, the aged king asked the waiting-maid as a riddle, what punishment a person deserved who had behaved in such and such a way to her master, and at the same time related the whole story, and asked what sentence such a person merited. 

Then the false bride said, ""She deserves no better fate than to be stripped entirely naked, and put in a barrel which is studded inside with pointed nails, and two white horses should be harnessed to it, which will drag her along through one street after another, till she is dead."" 

""It is you,"" said the aged king, ""and you have pronounced your own sentence, and thus shall it be done unto you."" And when the sentence had been carried out, the young king married his true bride, and both of them reigned over their kingdom in peace and happiness.

"event","i'm really really bored, i guess this is the blah time of day. i really want to call someone and go see a movie or something but sarah is at camp and theres nothing intresting playing anyways! i tried putting some pictures or icons on here but i cant figure it out. and by the way those of you that have summer gym classes with me... only one more week! yeah! at least they have the blacklights now... i guess thats a plus! and if your on the mhs jv cheerleading squad with me then someone please help me wth those cheers we had to memorize over july, since we had no practices this month i'm kinda blanked out! and another thing about that... when are we learning the pep rally dances? lol, typical me. show chior this year is going to be fun , along with musical theatre, but the new high school is so much better than the old one, despite the fact that its huge and i will be lost every moment that i spend in it! and for anyone who can answer this... whats up with the green? our school colors are purple gold and white, why is our school green? this confuses me...well anyway, i guess i'm gonna go find something else to do now, maybe shopping, sounds good!

P.S. sorry if this entry is really random, but i'm bored so i have an excuse this time!"

"event","i'm really bored right now, today was fun, hung out with my friends a lot. i found out that i suck at bowling... lol! but thats ok! i'm not that great at skateboarding either, but hey i just learned so i guess its fine for now. we go back to school on august 8th... fun. i'll be a freshman this year and my brother is going to be a junior so this should be intresting... lol! but my major concern is homecoming... i really want to have a date to the dance. my friends think that just because i'm a jv cheerleader i'll have a date, but i dont think that it works that way. but if i dont i guess i'll just go with my friends and have fun anyway! my friends are awesome so i wouldnt mind... but having a date would be better, depending on who he is of course. hes got to be hot thats a must! crap, just broke a nail...l8r!"

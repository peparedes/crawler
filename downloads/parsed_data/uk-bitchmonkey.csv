"event","At first I thought that we were meant to be, 
Me you and her, the famous three,
Im not so sure now, I think you will understand,
How this once friendship got a little out of hand.

You took me for a fool and used me in spite, 
And you got the credit, much to your delight.
You played your games and blamed them on me,
Thinking that you would get off free. 

You ruled my life for a little too long,
Just realise that I'm not in the wrong,
Like a shadow, you were like my other side,
And all along I was trying to hide. 

But I have wised up now and Im sure you know, 
That I'm not a mug and I'll let it show. 
So do what you want now, I don't care, 
Just think next time you want me there.

And a tip for the future, i think you should know,
that friendship is a thing that should blossom and grow, 
so next time you think about playing your game,
Remember me and think again.

In my real memory what had happened was I jumped in the water and couldnt get to the surface after diving in because I got stuck there was a gay inflatable mat thingy. In my dream I dived in and got stuck under all these mats and I really couldnt get out because the WHOLE swimming pool was covered in mats...It was so WEIRD!!</P>"

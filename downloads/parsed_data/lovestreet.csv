"event","So, in mid March, I got some ugly stretch marks on my tummy, on my gut area...below the belly button. I was horrified. I know it sounds vain, but I freaked out a little bit. I was like, that's IT. My body is telling me I've gone past maximum capacity. It was noticable of course because I'm so pale. I started sleeping on my back only for a while. 

I noticed this when I was visiting my family, so when I got home I buckled down and exercised 5 or 6 days a week for like two weeks, ate well and lost 5-6 lbs. I actually MOVED some weight, it was good. Then, I met a boy and since we've been dating I haven't been as dedicated to this endeavor :( 

I still need to lose weight though, because it's entirely NOT cool to lean over to touch your toes and be uncomfortable doing so.

I don't plan on obsessing over food and exercise, just staying healthy and being consistent about it. I weighed 176 in March, and I believe I got down to 170. Last time I weighed it was 172. I really should be more like 150. So, come on. I can move 20 lbs. I just need to buckle down again and be serious about it. Consistent exercise 5-6 days a week really helped me do it. And just has to be 30 minutes or more, no big deal. I have to make the time if I'm really serious about it. 

Rededicated."

"event","OK, so I'm not exactly sure when it came about, but lately I've been doing this crazy thing called eating when I'm hungry, and stopping when I'm full. And not worrying about anything. I just eat when I'm hungry. I don't count calories or obsess about any of it. I accept myself as I am now. So I eat healthfully and exercise, but there's no self-criticizing involved. 

Also, in October, I had a horrible, horrible stomach bug that made it impossible to eat much for about 4 or 5 days and I think it shrunk my stomach.

So, no more going on calorie-count.com and logging what I ate for the day and whatnot. I eat with no obsessing, it's great!"

"event","Well, I ended up dropping the gym, as I should have known I would. I didn't like it much, the machines get so dull after so long, and the classes would have eventually too. I'm too much of a misanthrope to last long at a gym. I also didn't like one of the class instructors, who seemed to be there more for her own workout than to actually lead a class, not to mention her annoying high pitched voice. Ugh, so I cancelled that... I just need some more workout dvd's to add to my collection to keep things fresh. I think it's much nicer to work out at home and be able to wear whatever and cool down afterwards properly, instead of having to shower immediately.

I was curious if my scale was right, since there was a 10 lb difference between my scale and the doctor's office scale. I took a full unopened 5 lb bag of sugar and put it on the scale and it was exactly 5 lbs... I wonder though because the scale at my dad's house was about the same as the weight on the doctor's scale. I don't know why that bugs me. Just a little bit, nothing major. Oh well. I don't know if I'd ever be able to lose real weight anyway, since I have such a sedentary job. I'm not trying to be self-defeating, just realistic."

"event","So, here I am a month or so later, still the same. And you know what, I don't care.
I don't feel urgency when it comes to losing weight, though I'd think it'd be good to weigh 15-20 lbs less. I acknowledge that it's hard to lose weight, especially since I have a sedentary job. But for now, I accept myself. 

I've been reading lots of blogs lately, like <a href=""http://www.therotund.com"">The Rotund</a> and a lot of the blogs on their blogroll. Positive thoughts about your body can't be a bad thing. 

I joined a gym this month, to break up the monotony of working out at home. I still spend time with Tae Bo and Billy Blanks, but the gym is a good change of pace for me. I've gone for three weeks now. First two weeks I went 3x, and this past week I went 2x. I worked out a day at home each week too. 

Now I guess I'm keeping things balanced and keeping things real. Not going to worry that I'm ""overweight"" or that the arbitrary BMI calculation says I'm obese... Really, that's a laugh considering I look no where near obese. I hate that fucking word. BMI takes no account of body composition, muscle, etc. It's a crock of shite.

And so is all of the diet garbage out there, so fuck it. The first three letters of the word diet are DIE after all..."

The route I take is 3 miles round trip. I usually walk that in an hour, but tonight I got back about 10 minutes earlier. The thing that slows me down isn't breathing but shin splints :( I guess that goes away with time. I would rather do a walk/jog combo than all jogging. Doing intervals like that is a good workout. I'll probably aim for every other workout doing this, and the other nights tae bo or one of my other workout dvds.

"event","The past two weeks I've eaten healthy and noticed that even though I only lost maybe 1 pound, I feel less fat and frumpy. Junk food is losing its appeal more and more. I still had a couple pieces of chocolate here and there, and on Friday I took brownies to work, of which I ate a few, but that's all. Pigging out on junk doesn't appeal as much. It's because when I'm eating whole foods, I notice how much better I feel, how much more energy I have, and how much calmer and clearer I am mentally. 

I'm also thinking of giving up meat again, but I think it's better to be a flexitarian. I think the main thing that bugs me is when I cook chicken myself. I hate the stench the trimmings make in the trash and just the handling of chicken grosses me out. I'm fine though, I eat very little red meat. 

One thing that bothers me about eating healthy and mindfully is how people automatically assume you're dieting. Hmm, diet is a noun to me, not a verb. Fuck dieting. Diet is a four letter word. Or, more accurately it simply means the foods that I eat every day. I think that dieting in the traditional sense (a.k.a. yo yo dieting) is destructive and harms your natural and healthy relationship with food. I don't want that. I don't see the point in losing weight like that only to gain it all back and then some whenever you go back to your old habits and then be gobsmacked as to why it happened. It's a big old DUH situation there. 

So, I will continue to eat happy healthy whole things as much as possible. I'm going to try shopping at this newer store near me that has tons of vegetarian, vegan, kosher stuff. I'm also going to keep up exercising at home and walking in the AM and PM to and from work and taking the stairs.

In fact, I want to exercise now and then clean. Yay."

I gravitate between 160-165 all the time. I never actually make any REAL effort, so here I am. I know I'm not raging out of control here, I could just as easily start nipping this in the bud, which is what really kills me. I ask myself, am I willing to let another 5-6 years go by and another 10-15 lbs creep on? EWWW. That would really really be awful and UNHEALTHY to the max. I hate to blame our culture for shit, but generally speaking you can't escape food. It revolves around everything and is everywhere. It's truly war out there and it's hard to keep a balance between obsessing and just being mindful. Resisting the urge is hard whenever others are there and would be all weird if you don't stuff your face too. Or they expect you to eat a lot just because that's just what you've always done and been able to do... until now. I'm not able to eat as much as I used to, yet I still do. I mean seriously, I've never had a problem until recently. I ate whatever and however much for years, is it going to take that long for me to get in the habit of eating less? Gah, I hope not! I'm in trouble if I don't start being more discriminating about what and how much I eat. It's not a crime to waste food or turn down food. I just need to remember that. And it's not like I'm going to starve or anything. Geez. Get a grip, man.... Until next time, when I continue my navel-gazing."

This past week or so I've eaten a bunch of crap. I drank a six pack of Guinness last night. I think I'm ready to be serious finally, after so many times of getting disgusted and fed up with myself and my lack of discipline. But, if I want to lose this extra weight, it's going to take discipline. Self-restraint. Nothing crazy, I'm not going to become a food nazi or something, but no more trips to the vending machine at work, no more of those occasional bottles of Coke, no more beer. OK I'll probably drink the beer until it's gone, but not 6 bottles in one night. I had a rough week, so I guess I wanted to let loose. But I need to not just recognize when I'm bored and go to reach for junk, but stop myself from eating that junk in the first place. I guess that is what is known as discipline. I MAY just develop it yet, gee whiz.

So, tonight's ""dinner"" of a turkey/cheese sandwich, 2 bowls of Cocoa Puffs and mint chocolate chip ice cream really didn't help that. I think that would rightly be considered pigging out.

I know it's stupid but, I hope sometimes, when I'm ass broke like I am now, that from eating less I lose some weight. I feel honestly that I'd be healthier if I lost 20 lbs and weighed 140 instead of 160. I do think I overeat, I do. It's not a huge problem that would require actual counseling, just a bad habit. A habit I need to stop. I think too that I eat way too fast. I need to slow down and enjoy things more and I'll feel full on less food. It's not good to eat too fast and be stuffed.

It was really good food, and after that we went to Coldstone Creamery. It was really nice to hang out over dinner and just talk and catch up. I'm going to make sure I call people more often. Anyway, I just have to realize that people DO want to hang out with me. I am going to make more of an effort to keep communication going. It's not healthy to fall into the hermit mode for that long."

"event","I'm still bored with life. I have these ups and downs. At times I feel great about things, and then I think that I'm just existing and not living. Everyone else is so busy and has so much going on. Then there's me. All I do is go to work, and occasionally see people who say we're close friends... Fuck that, we're not close. The length of a friendship sure as fuck doesn't determine the level of closeness. That's just stupid. I think my best friend right now is my cat. And much as I love him, that's kind of pathetic. After 25 it seems that the options for making new friends are limited, especially here where I live :( By now people are either in their own mini-universe or getting there. Seems there are a lot of people who go along with the ""life script"", a.k.a. get The One (tm), get married, have kids, etc. Lame. There is no formula for happiness and I believe that shit would drive me insane. I know this much: I don't want to get married like EVER, and I DON'T want kids. Eww. So, I'm thinking the older I get, the more of a freak I'm going to look because people who have that fucking life script mentality think you're a washed up piece of shit if you're not on the same track that they are. That sucks. All I seem to do is work, do some other piddly things, and wait for pay day. I have no substantial hobbies or goals, nor do I have anyone significant in my life that I see on a regular basis or connect with in a meaningful way. Does this mean my life is a waste? I sure as fuck hope not. I mean, I feel really like I have shitty ass self-esteem now. I'm the afterthought friend and there's no chance in hell that I'd ever meet anyone for a romantic thing at the rate I'm going. I don't ""get myself out there"" as they say. I don't think I feel like getting the fuck out there. Where, in bars n' shit? Blah. I don't know, but in this town it seems that I'd have to become a lush again in order to have any kind of social life. That's so blah, but maybe I could try it for a while. But WHERE? I have no one to go out with. Friends? What fucking friends? The ones who I call and instantly get their voicemail and from whom I never get a goddamned call back? Those people have been non-existant and can kiss it as far as I'm concerned. I'm not giving anymore of myself and if they're surprised at that, they can definitely fuck off.

You have to write letters to get letters. BUT I WRITE LETTERS SOMETIMES AND ALL I GET IS NOTHING! What is the fucking point again? Wait, am I the only person who has a fucking phone? Did their fingers break?"

I was so tired every day, because I was off last week. I slept in every day on my days off, so that made this week hard as hell getting up on time. I've been a few minutes late every day, but it really doesn't matter this week. There are so many people off post Xmas. Every morning this week I've made a beeline to Starbucks. I think tomorrow will be the same.

Last week was nice. I was actually off on the 16th, so I gave myself a four day weekend to lounge and be a bum. I left to go visit my fam on Tuesday, and came back home Sunday. I relaxed, ate, shopped, got presents, made dinner with Gram, went out to eat a couple times, visited the parents. 

I haven't heard anything else after S's text message about anything, no more texts, no phone calls. I wouldn't be surprised if they all got together. And moreover, I wouldn't be surprised if D retardedly thinks that I've dropped her as a friend just because I dropped her off my other journal and haven't called or emailed lately. Excuse me, I keep forgetting. I'm supposed to be the one keeping in touch, as usual. </sarcasm>. Who knows if I'll totally drop her for real. Probably not totally. I just don't feel like calling anyone, so if they think I'm blowing them off, whatever. I kind of don't care right now."

Her definition of friendship is obviously a lot more superficial than mine. 

And apparently another friend's fingers are still broken as well as her phone. I haven't talked to her since the ""incident"" on Memorial Day Fricking Weekend. She can basically fuck the hell off at this point. Actions speak a lot louder than words, that's for damn sure. I'm just amazed that someone who professes to be such great friends (or did anyway) can just trash a 12 year friendship. Real nice. If she's busy, fuck that shit.

I left last night, and I was going to check the air in my tires before leaving, but NO, a stupid ass damn Chrystler had to be blocking the air machine, so I waited a bit, but no one came out to leave. Damn it. I knew the one needed air and as a result I ended up having a really low tire tonight as I went home, and I was hoping and praying it was okay until I got to the next gas station, which thank fuck it was. It would have really sucked because GEE, I've never changed a tire before. I lead a sheltered life. It would have also sucked ass being stuck on the road I was on, near woods, not a lot of cars. Hmm. I think I shoulda just stayed home, but it was okay. It took me three hours to get to my gram's when it normally is more like an hour and 45 minutes, but tonight was a little better. Next month I have a week off the weekend before Xmas, so I'll have a longer visit with my fam then. My dad had to work today, but he came over to my gram's to visit a bit before he went to work. And, I got a take home bag of Thanksgiving goodies! I tired now. 

I need a new car, but hopefully my poor gimpy ass sled makes it through the winter. I was actually thinking of getting something on a lease if I can, because I don't drive a lot as it is (don't drive to work), so I would have no problems keeping within the mileage limit. If I start saving now, I should have enough to get something by spring. A cool advantage to having such an old ride is that I don't care about keeping it clean. I haven't cleaned it in like two years! If I had a leased car I'd have motivation to keep it clean, but come on with an old ass car, who cares! It's like a comfy old pair of sneakers.

I don't think my hair has touched my shoulders in over two years. My stylist dude says that he's thinking of starting his own place, which if that happens I'll definitely follow him because he always does a really nice job, and he's super nice. Before him, I didn't have a regular person, mostly during college, but before that I was going to the same lady since 6th grade. When I find someone I like, I'm pretty loyal. Finding a new stylist you like and feel comfortable with can be hard. 

Besides that I haven't done a whole lot today. I went to the grocery store again. Damn me for having to eat. I was <I>going</I> to try to save some money this pay day, but shit it didn't happen. And it's not like I overspent, I needed some new clothes, etc. and that was that. It's on my mind, so saving will happen eventually I swear! I have no idea how people do it, if they have to take care of someone other than themselves that is. I can barely afford myself.

I don't have anything doing with the nanowrimo thing, but I do have another story idea that's probably been cooking for a long time in my mind. It's part real life part fiction. I don't think there's a writer alive who's real life doesn't leak into their writing, whether they mean it to or not. What has kept me from writing it, and writing in general, is that I feel like my emotions are all dammed up and doing it's going to break the dam and let it all out. That rather scares me, but it's probably a lot cheaper than therapy. :) 

Reading about what another LJ friend is going through right now, it's come to my attention that finally, I feel I can think of my mother and not feel weird, or broken, or feel like I'm missing something. I <I>am</I> missing her but the feelings I feel now are of strength, happy memories, and pride that she was my mother. November has usually been a weird month for me: the anniversary of her death, her birthday, her favorite holiday, and her favorite season. But I don't feel like I've been going through this month in a nostalgic, melancholy fog like in years past. I remember her and get on with the day and with myself. 

I spoke to my gram the other night. She's had to have three separate operations to get rid of some hemmrhroids... yeah, my gram is pretty lucky. She's 81 and this is the most big health thing she's had. She won't be too peppy for Thanksgiving, but I'm going to help out. I miss my family. I haven't talked to my parents in a while, too long. I would say it's been about 2 months, which is kind of unusual. I keep meaning to call, but then I check the time and it's gotten late. Story of my life."

Education is wonderful and all, but it doesn't guarantee an easy IN or make you better than everyone. It's not really a grudge I hold, but ever since the time we tried to be roommates and things went weird for a while (she ditched me mid-lease for her boyfriend at the time), nothing's been the same. And you know what, after the shit hit the fan, my step mom told me she thought she was a homely bitch. I couldn't believe she said that! :P  Anyway, I guess what I mean is that it has sort of colored everything since.

""Here's what I've learned about grief: It's not linear. It's not predictable. It's anything but smooth and self-contained. Someone did us all a grave injustice by first implying that mourning has a distinct beginning, middle, and end. That's the stuff of short fiction. It's not real life.

Grief goes in cycles, like the seasons, like the moon. No one is better created to understand this than a woman, whose bodily existence is marked by a monthly rhythm for more than half her life. For centuries, writers, aware of grief's organic cadence, also have used seasonal metaphors to describe a process that continually leads us from the deepest sorrow toward the peak of renewal, and back again.

Mourning works like any series of cycles: one ends and a new one begins, slightly different than its predecessor, but with the same fundamental course. A daughter who loses a mother <I>does</I> pass through stages of denial, anger, confusion, and reorientation, but these responses repeat and circle back on themselves as each new developmental task reawakens her need for the parent. Say a girl of thirteen loses her mother to a heart attack. In the midst of the initial shock and numbness, she grieves to the best of her ability at the time. But five years later, at her high school graduation, she may find herself painfully missing her mother and grieving all over again. Years after this episode she may be back in the mourner's role again, when she plans her wedding, or gives birth to her first child, or gets diagnosed with a serious illness, or reaches the age at which her mother died. At each milestone a daughter comes up against new challenges she's frightened to face without a mother's support, but when she reaches out for her, the mother isn't there. The daughter's old feelings of loss and abandonment return, and the cycle begins again.

We're an impatient culture, accustomed to gratifying most of our needs quickly. But mourning requires a certain resignation to the forces of time. Expecting grief to run a quick, predictable course has led us to overpathologize the process, viewing normal responses as indicators of serious distress. The woman who cries every Christmas when she thinks of her mother is seen as a woman who can't let go of the past, even if every other aspect of her life is moving ahead as planned. And who can count the number of friends and co-workers who expected our mourning to be contained within the confines of those magical six-month bookends? How many of us came to expect that of ourselves? The messages that so frequently leaked through other people's words as the summer of my mother's death melted into autumn and the snow began to fall became exactly the ones I used to criticize myself: <I>It's been six months already. Get on with your life. Get over it.</I> I tried. I really tried. But it's impossible to undo fifteen or twenty years of learned behavior with a mother in only a few months' time. If it takes nine months to bring a life into this world, what makes us think we can let go of someone in less?""

"event","I finally know what my purpose in life is. It's to make other people feel better about themselves. They can look at me and say to themselves, at least I'm not as pathetic as that stupid bitch there. No one calls me to say hello even, and the only person who loves me is my cat. Yay for losers like me, for the world needs someone to point and laugh at, to talk about behind their backs. Everyone has someone but me. Who's going to love me? I haven't felt secure in the world or close to another human being since my mother died, going on ten years now. How lonely can I get? Apparently the darkness never ends, but is punctuated by bright short bursts of light and happiness. Then it's back to dark and dreary and sad. I have to fight to be happy and that is just a fact of life. Happiness isn't something that just falls into your lap like everyone thinks. I'm going to get as drunk as I can now to numb this shit."

"event","Beer tastes slightly odd after chewing some Extra cool green apple flavored gum.

I'm not going to call my friends anymore. Why? Because they never call me. There, I'm just going to chuck it. There's not much to chuck anyway. With friends like these people, with friends like these.

Tonight beer and music are my only friends."

"event","Last night and through today, I've been feeling kind of down. I was supposed to go out last night and my friend called to say she wasn't feeling too well, so I didn't get to go, which was fine actually because I was really tired and probably wouldn't have lasted long on the low energy I had. So like a good little loser with no friends or boyfriend, I went grocery shopping and came home. Ate some, watched a movie, <I>Midnight Cowboy</I>. All very bland and blah, such is my life now. I sit around waiting for shit to happen, and guess what, it never will at this rate. I'm not doing anything, I'm not doing anything interesting or creative or exciting. I'm just here. Waiting. 

Today I slept until 1, got up and ate, sat on the couch watching a movie, <I>Bridget Jones</I> (soon to be story of my life minus the prize of Colin Firth at the end), fell asleep on the couch for a couple hours. Then I got up and worked out to tae bo, showered, ate some tofu w/ hot sauce and celery. Watched <I>Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason</I>, and now here I am. I'm lame as fuck. 

And I think I should do more private entries because I feel irritated by the things people say sometimes, just because they don't know me from Adam and they really have no idea about me. That's all well and good, but sometimes I don't need the feedback and other times I just don't want anyone to read what I'm writing anyway. And this way I can bitch about all the stupid things that irritate me about this crap as well. Such as, people proclaiming that they're a writer (oh reeeally, like you and everyone's mother you idiot!) and people blabbering on and on about the same shit. I blabber on and on about the same shit all the time too, but at least I mix it up a little bit. 

Oh well, I'm going to continue to be boring and lame."

"event","I went to the dentist today. No cavities and I nearly went to sleep. I was so tired. Work was fine, and I was glad for an easy day because I was slightly cranky and tired. Yay, what an exciting day, not.

Many times lately I keep telling myself I'm going to die alone. Is that morbid? I feel like shit about how I am sometimes. I seriously fear intimacy, not sex, <I>intimacy</I>. I don't ever want anyone to be close to me, and no, I'm not going to a fucking therapist so I can be like everyone else and conform with society. Fuck that shit sideways with a pineapple. I don't know what I want. One minute I am sick to death of hearing about everyone else's goddamned weddings and the next minute I'm wishing I put myself out more in order to find someone nice, but the more I think about it, the more I resign myself to the notion that I'm just completely fucked. I live in a great city for senior citizens. What the fuck does that tell you? It tells you I'm fucked!! Not to mention, the next time I have sex my hymen probably will have completely regenerated itself. That's sad, but it'll be my fate, I know it. Self-fulfilling prophecy, here I come.

Anytime I hear anyone around me at work talking about their wedding plans, I feel like jumping up and shrieking, <B>I'M GOING TO DIE ALONE, YAY MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!</B>

And it's so nice to have a friend ask me what I'm doing this weekend then name sixteen different things she's going to do. Because she has a boyfriend, that makes me the proverbial chopped liver. Again, YAY MEEEEEEE! I think I should just down a case of beer this weekend and go cow tipping."

"event","Didn't go to work today. I went to bed too late, something I've been doing for about two weeks now and haven't broken out of yet. Hopefully I will tonight, because it's messing shit up. I get on these kicks now and then. I've been reading before going to bed, so you'd think I'd stop that, but no. I staggered out of bed this morning at the time I was supposed to be almost ready to leave, so you know how that shit goes. I really didn't feel right though, really! 

So, of course I didn't go anywhere, I just caught up on sleep and made dinner, etc. Boring shit. I chatted briefly with my friend on aol, and we were talking about health related crap and I told her the funny blonde moment I had when I bought my new scale. It's an analog one with the needle and all, so I got it and didn't realize that the needle wasn't resting on zero, it was somewhere around 25 or something. So I stand on it and think geez, how'd I gain all this weight? For two days I thought I was like 185 lbs. Then I realized, DOH, I have to reset the needle to zero! DUH. So I felt so relieved because I thought, damn, my pants still fit, and 25 lbs. is pretty significant, wtf. Anyway, I weigh 160 not 185! Thank dog for stupid blonde moments. Anyway, I told her that and said I'd gone down 5 lbs. from February and could probably stand to lose 5 more, and she says no you don't etc. and I wish I hadn't said anything. I can't tell people I need to lose weight because the knee-jerk reaction is NO NO NO, you're fine, blah blah blah. Well you know what, I live in this body and I know what I need to do, thank you very much. I'm not going to mention it again because I don't want to obsess or hear anymore crap about how small I am, because I'm not. I have a gut damn it! I hate looking down at my stomach and seeing it fold over itself :( And unfortunately you can't spot reduce, so I just have to be more careful about how much I'm eating, but there will be no diets. Diet is a four letter word. I'd rather eat like the French do and have no foods off limits, just eat in smaller portions. Sounds like a sound plan to me.

I'm going to go to work tomorrow, then Friday I believe I'm going out after work."

Normal tickets are now at the discouted price for any adult at $15, $30, and $40 and now anyone under 18 is free with a paying adult.  You can have as many kids to a paying adult as you want as far as I know.  Anyone that got a ticket through me that's under 18, I will be able to get you your money back.

Hokay.  So.  Today.  Tired, sums it up.  No coffee for me today.  I didn't think I did, but I guess I did, fall asleep in period 3.  Katie said she said ""good morning, good morning, good morning"" and I didn't hear it.  I thought they didn't stay longer than 5 minutes at the computer lab too and I think they were there for like 20, so I guess I did.  By the end of the school day I was doing a little better.  Then I watched most of Rattle and Hum and it was really good.  Went to Musica.  Saw the ballet dancers, they were awesome.  Everyone was there tonight that's involved in the second act, so it was pretty sweet. Then it was Dairy Queen for us because we NEEDED it.  Yes.  G'night everyone."

You just have to mention a school name affliated with the concert and be either a student, family, or teacher. My dad's going to pick up some more tickets on Monday, so if people let me know by then I can get you the discount.

Before I forget, Luke got Wildboys season 1 on dvd, party!  AAAAAAAAAAAAAH, my letter from Miami came today.  Even though I didn't get a 1250 on my sat they still gave me the quarter off scholarship.  They said they only took 2000 applicants out of 19,000 so I feel really grateful to have gotten in and part of me really really really really awnts to go there.  Hokay, so it's 40,000 a year, I got 7,000 off.  Financial aid is still to come, but it won't be even close to Hartwick. What do I want?  Oh man, I have such a big decision to make so ridiculously soon.  They didn't give me much time here.  I have like 2 weeks to make the biggest decision of my life and I'm really torn.  I thought I knew what I wanted, and both schools were the one I wanted at separate times, and now I want them both.  I wish I got rejected at one or the other because even though it would hurt it would make life a little easier here."

"event","Today was interesting.  I was nervous all day because of french and spanish presentations, mostly french because spanish was just a resumen and an 11 sentence blurb.  French was okay, I was just glad when it was over.  I'm a bad speaker but I don't really care because it's not going to have much to do with my job.  I like people and I will be able talk with them about their diseases and stuff, that's different.  After school was rehearsal, I was tired.  Then I went home and had a caramel pie at burger king that lifted my mood quite a bit.  Then I went to Olympia Sports to get shoes for the show. I ended up staying for a while.  They gave me a cookie.  It was weird, it felt like I was there for like 10 minutes, but I was there like an hour.  Then I got coffee and attempted to study for math with Alice but I don't care enough about it.  I couldn't find one hw that was a wks that's why.  It wasn't permanently in the notebook.  I looked for like 15 minutes then gave up.  I really need to organize.  I found out I got into Barry today and I forgot to tell Jacqueline so obviously it wasn't that important to me.  I got into the university and i got a scholarship but I won't find out for how much or if I got into the nursing program for a while still.  So I'm halfway there.  Getting into the university won't do me much good without being in the nursing program.  I'm going to Hartwick 99.9% sure anyway!  I'm very relieved and happy about that.  All that worrying just went away.  I'm totally going to bed right now and hoping the sleep will make me magically understand what's going on in math and english, hehe.

Found out after school that I got into Hartwick with a scholarship and a grant and a work study!  So that was pretty cool.  I was just a bit excited, ok, I was giddy.  Then I went to choir.  I feel really bad for my friend there named Jen, she's giong through a rough time.  So I spilled coffee all over myself earlier and I thought oh it's ok I'm not seeing any boys at choir.  Turns out the boy singers of maine came.  It made me laugh.  i still didn't care though because they're singers and a little odd, lol.  I told Jaye about getting into school and she was like great, so you got so excited you spilled your drink?  and I was like yeah!  Sort of!  It wes nice.  I have a nice green latte and now just finisehd off an iced latte from dunkin'.  It's rather sad how much money I spent on coffee today.  I'm feeling pretty good right now but it's going to wear off.  I have a 2 liter of diet pepsi waiting for when that happens.  I am going to get through this night if it kills me.  I have no idea how many notes to take for a 10ish minute presentation.  This cd I got will cover 3 or 4 minutes, reading the french sentences will take at least 2 or 3 minutes, so I have to have some stuff but hopefully it'll be alright.  Who cares.  I got into college.  I just have to pass!  Such an overwhelming day.  Choir was amazing.  We started the choreography for the show and it gave us chills.  Jaye told us that we needed to be so emotional on stage that we were crying while we sang, so it's intense.  It all started coming together and the reality that the show is coming really hit me.  It's going to be such an experience.  Found out that uh 150,000 is being put into it.  HOLY SHIT, that's a lot.  Jaye reminded us again that we need to be perfect.  We're adding rehearsals, the whole bit. It'll be worth it though.  If anyway wants to come tickets are up at porttix.com.  They're between 30-50 and I realize that's a lot but if anyone comes you'll love it."

Second dream, I was at home, but it wasn't physically my house.  Sandy, for those of you who don't know he is my old cat that died and I loved him a lot.  So Sandy in my dream was still alive but he was lost outside like Pretty Kitty was and I was worried that he would be dead because he didn't have his insulin and it was winter out and he would be cold and I was just lying on the couch sobbing, wondering if I'd ever see him again and being heartbroken becuase I knew he was suffering.  Then this guy came that was like the devil and he said everything was going to be destroyed and no matter where we went we were going to get crushed and he left and the the ceiling started to cave in and break little by little and I got scared and ran out but the sky was all covered in storm clouds and the ground was breaking and it was just as bad so I went back in and curled into a ball on the couch just waiting to die.  Then it stopped and I wanted to call Jessie to talk about everything but mom wouldn't let me because she wanted to listen to her voicemail and I was just freaking out.  Overall they were just like depression dreams where the emotion in it was the worst part and you can't even put it in words but it's a really bad way to feel to start out the day."

"event","Oy, I just finished ""Philadelphia"" as an uplifting movie before E.R.  I was watching Saw but Peter wanted to bring it to DJ's and mom said why don't you just go rent a movie and I was like yeah good idea.  So I saw Philadelphia and I was like whoa Jacqueline said I should see that by myself.  I got it and I knew it was going to be heavy but man, it was really sad.  It's been kind of a down day.  Kind of sad for the first day of vacation, but it's alright.  My only real plans are on the Friday's.  Tomorrow dad and Jacqueline and I are going to see Phantom (the movie) and I'm really looking forward to that.  The next Friday Jessie and I are going out to dinner and then going to see Phantom which should also be incredubly fun.  Sometime during the week I may be visiting my grandparents in Massachusetts and seeing Phantom with my mom or tubing with the family.  Those plans are pretty up in the air.  I'm sure I'll be working plenty as well, I'll find out tomorrow.  I also have a bunch of academic stuff to get done but I don't want to think about it tonight.  I almost cried in Grady's class because I was listening to new to me U2 stuff and Bono's voice was just so beautiful.  Ah."

"event","It's been a great day so far.  It's so weird though, the second I walked through this door my mood just slipped way down.  I hate this house.  Anyway, so bio we had this sub. I talked to my friends instead of doing my work, of course I did!!  Sub got pissed, I didn't care.  Rest of the day was good, we watched a really cool movie in french.  Deej made me sing by myself which I HATE but I didn't fuck up so I didn't mind.  It was really funny, I had to talk with Jessie breifly to get the courage and Anastasia thought I was asking her to sing while I opened my mouth.  I thought that was so great.  It's a pretty good idea actually, I'll have to keep it in mind.  Then after school Jacqueline and I went to get guacamole because we've wanted it for a long time.  The good guacamole, which I have yet to try.  So we got to shaws #1 and they're out.  So we went to visit Bammie!  It was really cool because she's one of those people that I've heard so much about that I already felt like I knew her and then I got to meet her and it was so cool. Then we went to the next shaw's and they so had some!  I almost left my car on because I'm a whore!!!!!  Then we didn't have time to eat it because Jacqueline was almost late for work.  She changed in literally a minute in the half, from when she left the car until she came back.  It was DEFINIATELY a record.  So now I'm home, I'm going back to eat the guacamole later!  YAAAY, so thrilled."

"event","Oy, no more dishes for Bones.  That was skill in how to stack them because there was no room for it all.  Mom still isn't impressed.  I showed her the letter that I got magna cum laude and my last math quiz that I got 100 on to try and maybe get her to like me but she didn't really think that much of it.  She said congratulations, but she didn't seem that excited.  Oh well, whatever, I tried my hardest."

"event","It's been an interesting day.  We had about 100 new vocabs and concepts thrown at us in bio but it was so amazingly cool I didn't mind.  It was about the development of animals, it was cool beans.  Math was confusing but kind of fun.  History=free diet pepsi from Grady and fun dip.  English was ok but I have to write an Italian sonnet which sucks.  Spanish was mind-boggling conjugations ahhh, so many.  C.S. was stinky because Deej wouldn't let me pass out my valentines plus they all broke and I was sad.  I hate it when they break.  They've never been as bad as this year, usually it's one or two, this year it was the majority.  French was boring, the sub was a nazi.  Then I went to work which was ok.  This little probably 4-year-old girl came through the drive through and said hi to me and I was like aw.  Then she said ""you have beautiful eyes"" and I didn't hear it right so I was like yeah?  and her parent said she said that and then she said it like 3 more times then waved goodbye.  It was kind of shocking because usually the only comments little kids have about how I look is my size.  It was amazingly cute.  Other than that it was boring.  Then I had dinner with my dad, that was nice.  Stuff's getting a lot less awkward.  Then I came home and mom pretty much accused me of breaking promises because I forgot to do the dishes.  As you know, that means I'm a horrible daughter and person.  Thanks!"

"event","Today was ok.  Fairly disappointing as I couldn't give away about 95% of the valetines that I worked so hard on.  It just won't be the same tomorrow.  Sad stuff with my dad.  Feel really bad that I didn't get my mom anything.  Oh well.  Whatevs.  I got to watch The Italian Job, I got to hear Bono be the man on the computer, and I got to make one person happy.  Good enough."

"event","I just have to get this nightmare off my chest before I start my valentines.  I was at this church service that was held outside.  There was a big deal about food, pies specifically, I think because my mom bought us pies, I took a bit of this oreo one and it was so good.  I went back and it was more like a wedding than a service but it was still just a normal service.  Someone wanted me to finish the service and say a prayer but I didn't know enough about what to say so I said I couldn't, I wasn't even nervous, I just didn't know what to say, so this other woman offered to say it so I said alright.  Mom's pissed at me because I don't feel like having a money college talk, sorry.  Anyway, so this woman did it and it was beautiful and the pastor offered her this gold necklace with a diamond on it that was really pretty and she took it.  Then I was in her house with her husband and this guy came and broke it off her neck and then shot her.  In a way it looked just like a movie but in a way it was more scary because it was right in front of me.  I woke up sweaty and scared.  It was good times.  My day was ok.  Nothing monumental.  Kind of frustrated and still recovering from yesterday."

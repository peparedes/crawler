We walked a good portion of Manhattan, dutifully went to museums (the Louise Bourgeois retrospective at the Guggenheim was awesome) went to Ellis Island and the statue of liberty (finally!), and drove down to old town Philadelphia to see the liberty bell and the liberty hall.

I just finished all the retouching and postwork on the last project, and don't have not much to do now. I did play and finish the new star wars game, which was much better than I expected.

Work is kinda slow, but I'm not complaining ;-) Tavo got me an xbox elite for my birthday, and between playing GTA4 on xbox and Assassin's Creed on ps3, I didn't have much time for work. I finished GTA4 yesterday so I can pick up the camera and take some photos for a change. Can't believe the amount of time I wasted playing those two games...

Clarence, the bastard chihuahua, peed on my rather expensive photo backpack yesterday and it's gonna be a bitch washing it. He's the most stubborn asshole of a dog.

I'm gonna have to do more fruit photos for some pepcid packaging redesign this weekend, and I have a feeling it'll drag on with all the revisions and retouching that will most likely follow. After that I'm looking forward to a trip to NY and PA to do some photos of cakes and all kinds of sweets for splenda redesign; sounds like fun!"

"event","So glad that I haven't gotten any emails or calls regarding work this last week.
Went to the gym for the first time in a very long time; it's kinda sad how out of shape I am :-(
Washed the cars, took forever as I was all sore from the gym; didn't do anything else remotely productive.

Just watching tv, waiting for Tavo to come back from school now, and debating whether or not to do the laundry and the dishes...

Oh and I started netflixing Battlestar Galactica last week, finished the first season, hoping to get the 2nd season dvds tomorrow and geeking out all day. 

Looking forward to a work-free week! Yaay!"

"event","I've been waiting for the new pentax K20d for a while now, and it was supposed to be available around april, but I was checking calumetphoto for something else and noticed they had it listed as ""ships same day"". I called them and they said they got small shipment in last night, so I ordered it right away! One hour later they were out of stock ;-)

This is the last chance for Pentax; I've had way to many autofocus issues with the K10D and can't properly use some really expensive lenses. This new camera is supposed to have calibration adjustments for individual lenses and if this doesn't work I'm dumping all my Pentax gear!

we'll see..."

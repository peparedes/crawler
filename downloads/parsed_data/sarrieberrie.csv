"event","so i officially had the worst birthday in the history of all birthdays. actually, its been a pretty bad week. it all started with a semifight with a dude that i dont even know why i even care if that dude is even still alive. whatev.
then monday we went to the backdoor and then the stripclub to celebrate my birthday. rob got a DUI on the way home and i had to drive his truck home.
then tuesday i did nothing. paid my gazillion dollars in taxes. hung out with chaz at the house. shopped for a dryer with him and meg. nothing important.
wednesday was my birthday. yeah. lame. my car blew up. on the expressway. erin had to come and save me. it was all bad and i owe her my whole life now. so the car is at carmax waiting to see if the warranty will cover the entire engine replacement. im sure it wont, and i will be paying them $82 for nothing. thank you america. anyways. im a total bum now and making everyone drive me around. awesome. so then, after i cried all day wednesday because my car is not fixable and i owe way tooo much money on it to get a new one, i had to go to work. everyone knows that at phoenix hill, wednesday nights are ghetto trash, and some cool people. but mostly ghetto fuckingnontippingasshole trash. and i had to deal with that. i made decent enough money, but seriously. nothing to get super excited about. that shit was whack. but patty did make me cupcakes!
so then. thursday, i did nothing. because there was nothing i could do. because i cant go anywhere. ever again.
friday, work. at least i was in a good mood all day yesterday, but still. i have no car.
lame.
god hates me.

AND IM FUCKING 25. WHO WANTS TO BE FUCKING 25.
thank you. that is all."

"event","so, i havent posted to this thing in forever. and i even made another journal to use. but this is the classic.

so i had a really really good time tonight. even though kayluhhhhh knifefight can be super depressing sometimes.

so much shit has changed, its unreal. 

*i live with charlie, meg, and erin. not ireland erin, but the other erin. who is rad.
*i am dating absolutely no one. 
*im sort of addicted to myspace. WTF.
*i dont talk to joe anymore, but this guy that he works with is rad as fuck. and we chat at work on fridays.
*mike, the alcoholic/druggie exboyfriend is ""sober"" now. a lot of good that did for our relationship.
*i bartend at phoenix hill tavern. and i love it. i quit the law firm so i could sleep more. if i fell asleep driving one more time, i would have killed myself and at least a zillion other people
*my little sister has TWO kids. both of them are amazing. tabithas little boy, maddox, he says my name now, only it sounds like rarah. 
*i spent half my night learning to play poker with my BA (best associate), drinking rock lobsters, and hanging with these rad old guys at air devils inn. oh, and then i robbed a bakery...WTF.
*my cat had to be put to sleep. im pretty sad about that. 

and thats all ive got for right now. more updates later. hopefully more often than every two years or whatever. just sayin."

To sum up everything since missed, i moved out of those apartments I lived in, got a house with tim and my best friend..and have spent everyday since stoned at the least. 2008 seems so far as nothing other then a drug binge. Heavy on the binge the past 2 months. It doesn't even matter what I am being offered, I will literrarly say yes to just about anything I can get my hands on. And everything is chased with booze. And i dropped a lot of weight, and am almost back to 100 but at the same time feel like my body still looks like a mess. I am a mess. I'm also worried about my memory because I feel like it's lacking lately. I have the hardest time remembering simple things. Or separating what I think was something I dreamt with reality, and vise versa. First week of april i did about 25mg xanax in less then 3 full days. That entire week is a complete black blank question mark in my head. People think I may have caused retrograde amnesia since I had no intentions of taking more then 2mg i had to start with. And now i don't know if my memory problems were caused by this or started even before that. 

I'm almost glad I don't have money this week. 

...I'm saying this now but come wednesday i'll probably be singing another tune. 

I just need to learn how to have fun again without depending on a drug/booze. 
This would be less hard if I didn't live in nebraska. 
I'm hoping this warm weather on the rise will change all this crazyness i've been feeling."

"event","I don't remember all of it so this is condensed and if you don't wanna hear it well obviously quit reading it. FYI i always have dreams that are wacked out like this, but few have had any impact on me to terrify me this much.

There was a whole different story to the begining of my dream but since it has nothing to do with the current one I wont bother. Apparently my apartment building is connected to the mall, and not even lincoln's mall but some multi level type place (think mall of america but less big) and you can either take the stairs or use this huge glass elevator thing. And of course theres a limit to how much weight can be in it.


Well i'm in it waiting to go to my floor and it's already quite full and we're all chilling cuz apparently the elevator leaves every certain time (like the city bus) and just when i thoguht it was full enough some GIGANTIC guy walks onto the platform and they get a scale and weigh him to make sure we're all under the max weight limit, i freak out and just opt to take the stairs. I end up in the mall where the main other elevators are closed due to some exhibit going on there and this kid from LNE is there and i'm trying to figure out how to get to my apartment and the security guy says he'll take me and LNE boy comes along as do these 2 other chicks. We have to trek all the way around the place and up red brick stairs which go off into this expensive chateu apartments that the owners of the place had declined me residency of because I kept a pet? Anyway the LNE boy and security guard were at the top of the brick stairs when all of a sudden we see them get attacked visciously by a fucking rabid jackal and so we run back down and try and make it into the parking lot to go use the service glass elevators and the girls are ahead of me and i'm freaking out and i may have been bit i dont remember.

I make it into the service elevator where some nut job girl has decided she's going to live. And puts face paint on me and then injects a shot of jackal pheromone in me to lure the animal to finish me. And then kicks me out of the elevator. Apparently the pheromone is too strong for humans to smell because NO ONE wanted to help me and they all ran away. Finally i guess the smell wore off and someone helped me and they attacked the jackal and I thought all was right with the world. Finally I could head back to my apartment.

I wait in line for the elevator yet again and ride it to the 2nd floor and get off, not realizing I need the 3rd floor. The security guard with us told us to be careful because apparently it wasn't just one jackal out but a whole pack of them and they've infiltrated the mall and apartment buildings. The hall way was trashed and the lights were flickering. After hearing that i tried to hurry up and make it back to the elevator but it was too late. I was stuck on the wrong floor.

This is where the dream has a lot of running around and such in it as I try and perserve my life. I tag along with this one guy who seemed to know what he was doing and also lived on my floor. We broke through to some doors that were SUPPOSED to lead us to the third floor but instead led us into the back room of Spencers in the mall. I walk out the mall and into sunlight and fresh air drenched in blood to find two people with gasoline starting to drench the place, out of another door a dead plastic baby head falls out (what this has to do with anything idk but it scared the shit outta me). Despite all the sunnyness and birds chirping all i wanted was to just be in my own apartment, so I went back to the carnage.

Back inside spencers I found a dog that had gotten into the store from the main hallway through this hole I had missed to see. I startled him and he ran back into the hole and started barking. I knew the rabid jackals didn't want the dog they wanted human flesh so I figured I needed to get the hell outta there ASAP before the whole pack comes to spencers. I lifted up a door that appeared to be an attic door and watched the jackals run past, but didn't close the door fast enough as two had caught me watching and hurled themselves in my direction. I tried shutting the door on them, with their bodys still half in, half out of the store but it was too much, one kept biting my arm and the other was just stuck inbetween it all, i finally hurt both of them and fling them onto the floor of spencers. All i hear is quiet. I figure i'm safe because the jackals must be elsewhere. I open the attic door fast and am halfway out the door when all of a sudden I see all their eyes blink open and they're a foot away from me but were hiding in the shadows, they ALL lung towards me..

then i wake up."

"event","So me and tim took a walk at 2 in the morning around town and to get paper plates to eat off of because we didn't have any.

We were the only customers in the entire super center walmart.

That's not the point of the story. The point is as we were walking back to the hotel we walk by a gas station where two wannabe ghetto thugs were getting in their car. I suspect they were either drunk or under the influence of something.

They then proceed to yell random things about me and how hot I am and that tim was lucky to have me and that he should go back home and give me a good fucking.

Oh the story doesnt end there.

We keep walking, they get in their cars, go where we are and pull the car right up to us so I cant keep walking straight and saying more random crap. Then they say that I should get in their car and tell tim that's what I wanna do. I keep walking. And because I didnt get in their car (cuz apparently girls are just supposed to get into random guys cars and drive off with them leaving their boyfriends behind) their words of praise shifted in 1.5 seconds to calling me a whore and blah blah blah and yelling random obscenties.

Guys seriously...do you honestly expect some girl to get in your car.

I can understand maybe (and that's a MAYBE) if I was wearing barely any clothes and I was by myself and looked like a fucking hooker and actually gave you the time of day...but to expect some girl who's with a guy?

Fucking idiots. I'm sick of running into shit like this. Grow a fucking brain."

And pot just doesn't effect me the way it did when I was younger. Lately i've been associating it with high school. When I think pot..i think highschool. Why I dont quite know. I guess this sack will do. I just really wanted some valium or lovely adderall. Or lovely anything.

You never know.

This spider on the wall is going around in circles. I keep hitting him down back onto the floor, and he gets back up, gets in the same spot..and goes round. 

I want what he's having sir.




Indecisiveness causes me to pack more heels then I would even need, and close to 14 outfits. For a 4 day trip.

And I dont even mean that in the negative way, we just all..change.

I started thinking about that a few days ago at ryan's when I was a bit twacked and got in a conversation with Bri about old middle school friends. Then I started thinking about highschool.

Everyone I knew back then, is a completely different person. Mostly for the better, some for the worst, but the point is they all changed. Whether it's appearance, sexuality, music taste, religious affiliate. In some way they changed, and it's healthy to do so. I cant think of one person who's the same person they are now, then they were 4 years ago. 

I've changed a lot lately, and i like this change, and welcome it. I came a long way from the girl who entered highschool 5 years ago. 

Mentally i've grown a lot, I know it's soon time to end fun and games and start thinking seriously about the future. I need to know if taking a night job would interfere with classes at ITT. I need to pay the deposit for the apartment. I need to start looking at cars. 

I need to breathe, something I couldn't do back then, and something I feel i can do now. My life is coming together and changes are happening, and I'm embracing them all. Every new experience, every new mistake."

Grocery shopping is a lot cheaper than eating at fast food, lol, thanks to sarah for pointing this one out. Especially when i spend more than 10 bucks at mcdonalds per visit for just one meal when for that same amount of money i can buy stuff that will last me longer. Plus I enjoy grocery shopping with Tim. Even though he gets annoyed with my indecisiveness of buying food :)

I dont know what's going on with me lately, I want to be with him, hell I'm looking at apartments right this moment trying to find a nice place for us. Yet I've been treating him like complete crap. Earlier this month I walked out of his car and proceeded to walk home (I was in walton, a small town near lincoln), the third time I've done that in the 4 months we've been together. I just need to stop overreacting, or else just stop for 2 seconds and think before I act. Think before I walk out of a car at 9:30 in the evening thinking I could walk home from walton to my house without getting killed or picked up and gagged and have my skin made into a coat for some wacko. 

I do love him, and I definatly see a future for us. I just have the shittiest way of showing it lately. And I dont mean to. I dunno, I can think of tons of excuses for my actions, but I'm not aiming for excuses. 

Believe me when I say I love you. Believe me when I say there is a future for us. Believe me when I say if you cause me to have deformed babies with that MDS study crap you're doing i'll punch you in the ear fight club style :)"

So after telling myself I'm not spending any amount of money this month on MAC makeup (my current spending money obsession product) or clothes for that matter since one of my three paychecks already is going to everybody but me, and that leaves two paychecks that I need to save for SD next month..but from what I've learned..I have no control and bought 8 new eyeshadows..granted I only spent a tad under 80 dollars, i still feel bad cuz i know i'm going to need that 80 just in case. I have no money management skills. I should just give everything to tim and let him hold onto it. Or else stop checking mac communites on lj, lol.

I've spent all day doing absolutly nothing, and felt content in doing so. I haven't had a day where i stayed home and did nothing in AGES.

I dont know if I should blame birth control, or my love of fast food. But the latter never made me gain a single pound cuz my body would burn away all the calories. So i dont quite understand the change. But i do know i got rid of 5 pounds of it. 20-25 to go.

Somehow since Janurary i've gained about 15 lbs, and i'm now at the most heaviest i've ever been in my life.

On one side we have my nice safety cushy weight of 99-104lbs that i've always been and feel comfortable in my skin weighing. Downside being my breasts shrink, but really nowadays boobs are completely overrated.

Then there's the me now. And i feel completely ALIENATED from my body, and dont like the way i feel in clothes at all. But my breasts actually fill out, and so does my ass.

Now its just a battle between wondering if i can feel comfortable with this new weight, or saying it fuck it and going back to my comfort zone and along the way throwing a big fuck you to society liking their women big breasted and with asses. 

Blah blah. I dont even understand how i gained that much weight. 



In other news i went shopping and bought clothes tim cant keep his hands off me in. Though really he cant keep his hands off me regardless of if i'm clothed or not. I havent bought clothing for myself in awhile lately so i liked treating myself to something nice. 

Then sat in a car for about an hour while tim helped travis move furniture for his friend and chainsmoked. I was just expecting it to be done quick and then we'd be on our way. But for some reason i'm always suckered into spending time with people i dont want to spend on days i have off and then being miserably bored thruout. Wanted to see ice age 2, but the move cancelled that plan.

I got my day hours back so I can go back to working 38 hour weeks and rolling in 600+ paychecks. 

Now i'm just waiting for tim to get another job and we'll be set to move out. I just wanna pack. And unpack. The process brings me relief.

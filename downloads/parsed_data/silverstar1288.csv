If you flirt with us why dont you ask us out... its not like your dating anyone else... OR ARE YOU??? Screw you I dont know why I look out for people and then they ignore you... it really pisses me off... guys are my weakness and I thought that I had finally found one that was right for me... no matter age, but I was wrong! Age does matter because you are a jerk and a bitch so therefore... dont ever talk to me again if you are going to be a bitch and ignore me! Im sorry im not a sweet lil angel, sorry I have issues, sorry Im not a girly girl! If you want me you have to except me the way I am!! Why am I changing for you...

"event","I have two great best friends, well at least I thought they were great, who have been keeping secrets from me cuz they are not sure how I react.  They told me today and I was fine with what they yold me, but I was upset that they didn't tell me sooner.  They told eachother but didn't want to tell me... I had to keep asking them what they were hiding from me.  I am really pissed off now just thinking about it because best friends should not be keeping secrets from eachother especially when they know me like they do.  I just don't get it and UHHH  OMG... I just want to yell at them and tell them how much that hurt me and disgusted me!  I dunno but I may have to back off from them for a while so I could calm down and stuff... I am so freakin' frustrated... I dunno!  What should I do?  Seriously... what... I am so confused and dazed that they would do this to me.  Well, I am done venting so I guess I'm done.  Sorry if this seems stupid but I gotta do what I gotta do.  Check yall later... BYE!"

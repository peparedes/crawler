"event","so here i am in college.
waiting for my english professor and hoping he isnt going to come. that would be just lovely. 
i made it here. maybe i didnt feel like this time would ever come. but it has and i looooove it. the friends the people. the experiance. my room. my house the people in it. my classes. everything. i thought coming to newbury college would be the worst thing. since this was the last place i wanted to go. i thought it would be horrible. all the girls were rich and had coach bags and dressed in designer clothes and seemed somewhat stuck up but thats not how it is at all. my classes arent bad. more easy actually. there strict and definatly different from high school but all the same much better. i have an amazing roommate. were so much alike and i wouldnt trade it for the world. a good group of friends.. theres a bunch of us and always soemthing to do and someone to do it with. were there for eachother =) 

its rather interesting. to finally get what my older friends went through and why it was so hard to keep in touch with them. life is so busy. its like a different world. i dont really talk to the people at home. only a few. and the people i did keep in contact with have changed completely. i dont even know who they are anymore. or not even who they are but i dont even think i ever knew.
there are many same similarities in college that there were in with high school. but i think i like this better. everything really does happen for a reason. coming to a new place where i didnt know anyone. i think it was the best decision i had ever mad. and hopefully itll lead me to a successful career. i went home for a few hours and it wasnt weird to go home. it was still my home. but i missed school. it was definately weird. there are times that go by where i think about how things were only a few months ago. and how drastic my life has changed since then. the friends i had that arent. the people i was around the things i did. its interesting. its kinda weird to know i can never go back to a time or a place, only in my mind in a form of a dream. but at the same time im kinda excited to see what my future may bring. the people god had seemed to have put in my life i couldnt have chosen better myself. i believe everyone is put to walk in and or out of your life for some reason. to help you, change you, effect you. whatever the case may be. and i am so glad these people are in my life. 

i miss my extra activities. student council. cheerleading. and MOST ESPECIALLY dance. i dont feel like myself without it. im like a new person. and to not be able to continue it kills me. i would love to continue it like i had in the past. but in reality i have to figure out my life. and money is kinda an object. so is time because i have learned one thing.. that is one thing that does not wait for anyone. 

my job. applebees closed sunday. i worked there for over a year. and it flew by. it was my first job and i learend so much there. and it was definately sad. even tho i went through hell at times those people were like a family to me. i went home fora lil while to say bye. and i couldnt help but leave crying to know ill never see those people again. unless some time randomly bumping into them which would be great. and thats another thingi cant ever figure out. why do things end. did i ever see this coming? and its horrible that i cant ever let things go. and move on. 

im sure no one reads lj anymore but it was a nice mental note. haha"

 so...i haven't made an update in months. and i feel like so much has happened i couldn't possibly update everything. my summer has been quite good. and has gone by really fast. in less then a month ill be moving into school with new friends..living with new people and in new surroundings. and although im wicked excited. i still try and hold on to what i have now. ive spent a lot of time in the cape. and i love it. i dont want that to end. but like every good thing in life that too must come to an end. 
 this is the time you find out your true friends whose there for you even tho theres a larger distance between us. and maybe who never was. but thats not even my issue. its that things move at lightening speed sometimes you dont even have time to enjoy them or dwell on them until its ended. 
 someone who used to mean a lot to me comes home tomorrow. and ill see them for the first time in months. and i dont know how i feel. 
its weird to think back a year ago how things were. and how much has changed. how much i have changed. and the people around me."

"event","yep..
so that time has come and passed.
i graduated high school. 

and it feels weird. not so much different but the fact to walk downstairs and see that diploma is overwhelming. i can't believe i did it. i more cant believe it was raining on graduation day.  to sit in the front row. and watch my family in the stands and my friends all around me was surreal. crossing over that stage. more like a bridge into the ""real world"" shaking hands of administrators and hugging the guidence councilors. and holding my head and that book..that held a tiny piece of paper stating i, completed all 12 years of school while everyone cheered was one of the most amazing feelings anyone could ever feel.

after me and tayla stayed until we realized we had to go home. and people poured out we walked to our cars with a few other seniors to remember this would be the very last time in our ""senior ""parking lot. and it was sad. ill miss randolph high, mike couldnt have said it better in one of the best speeches i heard. no matter what were the lucky ones. we know what it was like. to learn not just fro textbooks and educational wise. but we learned what it was like to come together as different people. and im proud of that. not many people can say they go to such a diverse school as we did. 

then i went back to my house where my family was and more was starting to arrive. we looked at my yearbook and set up and stuff. my party was fun. thanks to the people who stopped by <33 

then outt with some cool people to hang at mikes where everyone else seemed to have been that night and then a sleepover with tayla. 

rewind. prom. that was a lot of fun. i went with josh. it was a goodtime.. the food was good. the music the friends the times we'll remember. 

im pumped for this summer. it should be one of the best times of our lives. and i plan to live it up that way.the rest of the weekends and such i have graduation parties to attend. and i hope to spend numerous hours at the beach. and then working so i have money for college. 

this is the time where i freak out. where did our lives go? although we just got on the road to the rest of our livves and its a new beginning and all that jazz. i feel like the best part is ending and i want a rewind or.. something. this is when u look back and see what youve become and where life has taken you so far. 

going back to the high school today for the first time was strange to know i dont even go there anymore. and to see ""seniors 2007? "" what is that?? 


so much for my quick update? 
  anyway..


ive been so involved in things. its weird to not have very much to look forward to. or well things to keep track of. 
i feel kinda empty.. 


well heres to the nights we felt alive.
the tears we cried,
tomororw is gonna come too soon..


live it up and congrats to my fellow class of two thousand and six. <33 
i love and miss you guys"

no day but today.
goodbye tomorrows gonna come to soon. 
thats what friends are for.

yeap. its that time. May twenty third. two thousand and six. it is.. what is called "" all over"". seniors last day. my last day of high school. my last day in randolph public schools.my last class day with all my friends. you would think that would bring a sense of saddness to heart? wouldnt you think?

however that was not the case. the last day of my senior year, a year that was already continuously crazy and ruined by administration standing in our way taking away the things we looked forward to most. however were a strong class and fought our way to survival to make it to the last day. 

tonight at senior bonding. that got cancelled a good billion times. we finally got our yearbooks that i must say came out prettyyy well.  and after reading them and looking at the pages over and over. and reading the comments over and over i realized that i loove being a part of my class. even tho yestarday was insane we left school in away that not anyone would ever forget. and we have all come so together within the last few weeks. and days. especially with my BAHAMA loves. i will forever miss the class of o6. 

now we have transition week. today i had cpr. it was quiteee borring. but beneficial i guess. tomorrow i believe is ballroom dancing and i wont lie that im pretty pumped for that. 

oh and last night was scholarship night. or maybe i should call it alanah night? haha. damn over acheiver...lol jk love you babe. i won four. which shocked me. even tho i think i kinda deserved it. i only did like 45 of them. but i won a cheerleading one. a music one and my one for s.a.d.d which i have to say was quite nice what ms. richard said. it made me smile =) and like all the work i had done this year didnt completely go down the drain and unnoticed. then i got called up again but i wasnt really paying attention or if i was its all a blur. when i got home and opened it it was for 1,000. and that made my day. and was probably a highlight to my week. so yay hard work in the long run DOES actually pay off.. 

i feel like i had so much more to write. but i cant think right now. and i keep getting interupted so finish later i will. love you all"

  why do you pass by oh so fast? and where do you go? cuz last i checked i was entering high school..not leaving it.and although i am estatic about moving on with my life to bigger and hopefully quite better (less dramafilled)places. i am quite sad to leave all i know behind me. obviously it will all be apart of me. but will never be quite the same.
i see all my 05ers ending their first college year and coming home, and talking with tayla and realizing bahamas that we aniticipated for, for sooo long is now over. we can not wait for prom and graduation and were planning our parties and everything and it all happens fo fast. its like when you take that one moment to realize what you have been through and what your about to go through your taken back for a moment. and not so much in a bad way. but in a surprising dont know how to feel sort of way.
itll be nice to see everyone again. but its weird because i never thought id get to this moment. the moment ever person looks forward to in life.

Looking back. i know exactly what i was doing a year ago today. and from then to now i have grown a lot and been through a bunch of stuff. and its overwhelming and crazy to see how far ive come or how long its been. because it feels like just yestarday. but to see the friendships ive made. and the friendships ive lost and not knowing if its good or bad that my life is this way is nuts. its that what if i did this or what if i didnt go to rhs kinda thinking. 

so everything for prom is pretty much set. 
dress..check
hair/jewelery/shoes/: check.
date.. to be continued? lol

i want to go back to the bahamas. with everyone. i miss it. it feels like itnever happened. for all the time we anticipated and even when we were there and it felt like we were for a year now thinknig about it it all kinda blends together. but definatly was the best trip. i miss my new  york boys a lot. 

and lets just say rumours.. especially the ones that DONT concern people. are REALLY funny. 

i hope this summer is the best one to come.
and last summer was pretty fucking awesome. so its got hard times to beat.
thats all for now.."

no more high school in 30 days..
its bittersweet.

i have everrrryyythingggg for prom.. my dress.. shoes. jewelery.. soon enough a tan..haha.. all i need is a hairstyle. and oh yeah the one tiny factor of a date... :-\

i have a person in mind, cept there are some minor obsticals in my way. i wonder how it will work out...

school is rather pointless dont do a damn thing. 
i missed two days last week. not because i didnt wanna go. although that did have a very small fact of the matter.. i have been WICKED WICKED sick.. like sicker then i have ever been in my entire life sick. but now i can move and breathe and its nice and i missed it. 

we got a replacement forensic teacher. shes NUTS. shes teaching us bio. and last i checked i took forensics to watch csi. not to learn about cells and rybosomes.

so i just got home from work...working 830 am to 9 pm is awesomee...sike.
coming home hand having your dad yell at you to do housework is even better.
i like when someone special says there gonna call you to hang out next week..
and next week comes and no phone call.. but thats pretty familiar right? 
that someoene special isnt so special anymore.
when did everything become SO fucking complicated?
when did my life make a complete 180? 
i wish i could turn back time.
it would be nice if people could fix the mistakes they made.
scholarships = DEATH.. yes in caps.
i cannot wait for college..
bahamas ..t-minus 28 days .. and i cannotflppinwait.
should be rather interesting... :-\
i pretty much suck at life.
i have so much to do and so little time to do it in.
im not myself anymore. ive been another person for like a month now. and idk what to do.
i want to freeze time. and take a breath of fresh air.
i want things to be back to the way they were.
i hope everyone had a happy st. pattys day. 
summer cant come fast enough
i have a headache
i should be doing other things right now
i procrastinate too much
nothing is ever good enough
filling out scholarships and the repeating question of "" where do you see yourself in ten years"" makes me think.. and i honestly dont have a clue.
i made a legit mess out of everything i possibly could.
but i do it to myself
i dont understand how colleges pick future students.
and now that i think of it i dont understand a lot of things
and i think im being random enough.

uhmm.. senior year is quite interesante. i must say. its not bad. but its not the best. we'll go with. im dealing with it the best possible. my life has had ups and downs inside outs forwards and backwards and everywhere between lately.. but i kinda like it. its like a sense of adventure. and i cant really complain right now.
   aside from the fact of actually going to school..its beyond pointless. but whateverr

i bought a car. and i loveeee it. its about damn time. so now i can get the other things ive put off done. and actually get some visiting done. so u college peopleeee watttchhh outttt ;0)

bahamas is like 33 days away and i cant effin waiiiittttt 
theres only 46 days left of school and that kinda scares me. but kinda makes me excited.

and noowww for the real update. 
masc.
holy shit. all i can say is to how much i regret not getting involved with it sooner. i had so much fun. dispite other things. it was a good experiance and i wish it wasnt over so fast. but im glad i went. the last night. and day was like a reality check. more like. time is flying really fast and it was sad and overwhelming. 

i got into newbury college =) so its somewhere but not where iwanted to go. and im waiting to hear from more. im scared.

life lately has been.. one fast paced craze of a blurr. just a bunch of memories and things taking place that i want to take in and hold onto forever as being a senior. but theres not many worth holding on to. im not going to lie that i think this is some  horrible dream and it is not one bit of the way i expected senior year to be..

topic number one... junior/senior semi..
it was a really good time. it was sad being the last one. ididnt go with anyone but it didnt really matter. i never thought id go to a formal dance without a date but it was so much more fun. and those are words i never thought i would say.it was all good until ms. speede came around with her stupid rulers. and she got more for the other teachers to use. i find that wrong. even if you were trying to make fun of the situation and thought it would be a good way to stop ""inappropriate dancing"" but when you can dance like that at a student council lock-in.. haha and seeing the whole world dances that way. get over it. grow up and realize times have changed. and yet again we were jipped out of time. ms. hahn ended it early because people wouldn't listen to her. 

topic number two.. student council lock -in
this was the best lock-in.. out of the total of two ive ever been to lol that i went to. and its just sad that barely anyone went. i felt that they missed out on a really good time.and it actually reminded me what student council was. im sure im not alone in being the only one who kind of forgot how much fun it could be. 

which leads me to my third topic. which seems to be a long list of ramble. and im sure all you bored people out there who have nothing to do so feel like seeing what the rest of people may be up to. here is time.. spent.. maybe not well. but i garentee you it takes boredum away for at least a few minutes. 
   its basically part of the whole subject to this entry. life. now i dont know when the line was crossed. and exactly when things changed. what what exactly that change was. but there was one. and i think it was a lot bigger then i had originally realized. everything got harder. a lot harder. granted things getting harder is a part of life. but i dont think im ready for this part yet. and at least when something was going to change i can slowely accept some things. but when your whole life seems to do some type of a 180, and everything you once knew.. has changed you kinda dont know where to go. poeple grew up. moved on. and thats okay. because thats what your supposed to do. and its kinda funny. because as much as i thought it would be something like this. never in my life would i have expected things to be this different. to think one of the best friends i had in the world would stop talking to me just because college seems to be such a different level then high school. and suddenly im not the most important girl in his life..far from it actually. and its just hard to deal with. 
its hard to fufill all the things i wanted out of high school and the things i wanted out of my life now. to be involved in afterschool things.. and just school itself is its own level. but then i add on dance and im working soo much to save up as much money as i can for bahamas and college and other things. its like i never have time to spend by myself. everything is so stressful. and overwhelming. and draining.
its times like this i had a sort of crystal ball i could use to see if this is all worth it. 
the waiting for my accceptance letters just to see if i have a future in eight months or do i have to struggle to change my plans around. 
and granted out of all this my life is no where near the rock bottom. or even being considered as remotely bad. because its not. i dont take what i have for granted at all and there isnt a day that goes by that i dont think about how lucky i am. but there are definatly times where i forget what im doing with my life. 
i want bahamas right now. this vacation is a muchhhly needed one and i cannot wait. 70 days people.. 
 and as much as high school sucks now. and as much as me and amanda talk everyday about how we cant wait til we get into college and move on with our lives. ill miss it. theres only like.. 68 days left of school.. left of grade school. of high school.left with some of the people ive known for my whole life. and im not really sure if its good or bad yet. 

k ill finish later haha i think thats long enough for one entry"

"event","well what a week. monday i got my passport for bahamas. or more like sent away for it! i cant waittt =) then i went to fire adn ice with the family. it was really good i liek that place 

tuesday was my birthday =)im legal wo0o and its the weirdest thing. it doesnt feel like i am but its cool i guess. school was alrite. then i went to dance. and out to dinner with my two favorite girls at T.G.I.Fridays it was a lot of fun. haha i think theres something wrong with us but i laughed so much. <33 them then i went home and karen came over and we went to nantasket beach to swing on the swings like we do in the summer.  buut it was WICKED sketchy

wed. was the two year anniversery of my aunts death. and even tho i kept kinda thinking about it and i knew what the day was it didnt feel like it. i was like absent minded tuesday and wed. both didnt feel like it was something special. it didnt even feel like the thing with my aunt happened. it was like a nightmare i had the night before or something 

thursday was pretty much the most pointless school day ever. the wonderful school system decided periods 1,2,3,7,5 was a good idea so that the seniors that leave 7th. .should go back to school after lunch for 5th period for 20 minutes. yeah wiked stupid so i got out at like 1015 and went home. waited for tayla and we went prom dress shopping <33 she found hers and its gorgeousssssss =) and i think i found myne too. even if we got lost we didnt expect us to find our SENIOR prom dresses in JANUARY.wtf. but it was good

then friday was senior breakfast.. it was good to see some people i havent seen in a really long time. ive missed some =) and i learned something. they kinda put the whole work part into perspective cuz looking for what school i wanted to go to ive kinda overlooked that small minor detail. and im scared that i wont like college or ill get kicked out or something. then after another pointless day of school i came home and went to work.. after work i went to krystals house and got home at 3 a.m

today i worked. i feel all i do with the rest of my free time is work. its good i need money but im sooo sick of it. and i got out at like 430.. got ready and me,krystal,mollie,tayla, and talia went to dicks last resort. t here was supposed to be a bunch of us but everyone else was busy and stuff but it was so much fun. mollie told the waitress that it was me and krystals bday so she made us a hat that connected us to eachother that we wore the whole dinner. they give u bibs and they tied balloons to their hair . hahaha so funny we got some serious looks from people it was cuz they were just jealous tho ;0) 

        work tomorrow im so mad 


i hate moods where all you do is think and over analyze things and try to make sense out of things. especially things that just dont ever make sense no matter how hard you try. i hate feeling like i wanna scream or go crazy. and i cant even think of a good enough reason why.
life is a lot to handle sometimes and theres a lot of times i wish u could just hit that pause button until u regroup and can continue on. everything is ike a warlwind of a bunch of things and it can really eff a person up."

"event","so i decided i needed an update while these things were on my mind when i should be finishing my research paper. i think i have done everything POSSIBLE to not finish this. its so sad and that truely shows how much of a senior i am. 

so ive been thinking a lot lately, which to much surprise isnt really shocking cuz i think all the time. and all i could think of was the normalhow close bahamas is, and who im gunna go to prom with and what graduation will be like.. where im gunna go to college and what will my friends be like. will i still talk to my friends now? those thoughts kept replaying over and over like i was watching my own movie. right now i have the best friends i could have ever asked for. each one of them are the most amazing people and its kinda weird how far people have come or has seen to have come just in the past months. because just like i was told everyone is starting to realize time is slowly running out and this is what we will always look back on. and we cant get these moments back. and it kinda saddens me 
reading krystals entry and after talking to her made me realize things even more. that the roads i drive down the places i go to on a daily basis that i complain about because i like the same routine everyday and im bored will all soon be over. ill have to adjust to a whole new life away from all i ever have known and as much as it will be a relief to get away and to start something new i am not a fan of change at all big or small so its gunna take some getting used to. i dont want to lose the friends i have now. i want them to fit in with the new friends i make in college. 

i miss the summer. i didnt realize it til tonight how much i really do miss it and how the summer was possibly the best summer i ever had. all the things i had went through looking back has changed me not by much but in a way i think for the better to make things more clear. 

im gunna refuse to get myself all worked up over things that arent quite that big of a deal. im gunna live my life to the fullest extent and have the best time doing it. 

on the down side i think i have the worst case of senioritis there is. i cant finish this paper and it sucks its a graduation requirement. we got our progress reports today and my math grade was just above the failing mark with a comment from ms. wade saying my work and effort was ""deteriorating"". i didnt even think that was an option for a comment. however all my other grades are between 80-100 so im not even worried. its just so funny to have..not so much of a careless but a carefree attitude towards a lot of things that used to consume most of my time. i just dont care anymore. and as weird as it is it kinda feels good to not care so much about every little thing. 


now all i have to do is send all my applications out. which i hope to have done by friday. there all done for the most part, i just have to put them in envelopes and send them out. which seems to have been the hardest part so far. my transcripts are already at my schools.. i got my recommendations months ago.. so this seems to have been the complete opposite of what ever rhs senior has ever told me. how strange.

and  this whole christmas thing? yeah where did it come from because aside from this frigid cold weather and the lights on houses and christmas music galore it doesnt feel like christmas at the least. and i have no idea why. christmas is my favorite and i have no idea why its so different to me. 


if that wasnt a long enough entry.. lol back to my paper :-\"

"event","hello there.. 

so tonight was awesome! the winter concert. i loved acapella we did good i was proud. ask me a year ago if i ever saw myself actually getting up there and i woulda looked at you like you were crazy. but it was awesome. :0) 

we got fitted for our caps and gowns today..and got the extra tassles and stuff.. u saw all the seniors like wearin em around school.. and it was a definate bittersweet feeling.. and i can tell you this whole senior thing is more then real. 

so today ive reminised so much just about everything. and it seems like i always do. but not as bad as i did today. in psych class they asked us to bring up a memory of our past.and i thought of natures classroom. so i got the whole class to think back about how we spent grade school. and talking to one of my friends and thinking of all the stupid stuff we used to do and how none of us go to the same school anymore and what it would be like if we did. 
its honestly wicked weird of how im not even old. im still a teenager. im just 17. havent even graduated high school yet. but looking back on many things. ive been through a lot. and looking back on some things make me feel like ive already lived a lifetime. and its kinda weird. its weird how we grow up wicked fast. and how friends of mine are  having kids like no tomorrow.and the things i would do to get a day back when everything was alrite and life wasnt a complicated mess all the time."

"event","^hm.. new words to live by? 



okay this whole senior year situation.. i dont even know where to begin. first off lets start with these fabulous applications that basically help decide what my life is going to be like come this time next year. holy fucking shit why am i seventeen and feel like my whole life has passed me by? really i dont get it. i know im not the only one who feels this way im sure it gets overwhelming for just about everyone but i dont even know what to do with myself. im a strong person ill give myself some credit but its gotten to the point with college apps and stuco and sadd and school and powderpuff and doing half of the shit i need to do by myself it sucks. granted i bring this all upon myself. no one asked me to do this i wanted to do it all. i thought i could handle it all. and i can. i just never thought it would be so rediculously overwhelming, 

so thinking is honestly going to kill me one day. it seems like all i do is think and its really bad. everythings moving so fucking fast and theres nothing that any of us can do to stop it. its already the middle of november. thanksgiving is next week. what. the. fuck.? just everything leads me to think of the same things. and i dont know what to do. infact theres nothing i can do. its life it moves on with or without me. 


i wanna quit life. 

i havent been this bitchy and negitive like this in i dont even know how long. i dont think ever. who ever knows me to be a bitch. but lately i have ruled the thrown on that one. its so weird. i dont even know how or why. 

all day today i thought about how something was missing. and i dont know what it is. i cant quite put my finger on exactly what it is ive seemed to have been looking for. but i think i kinda am starting to form an idea. 

i hate change. and i will in to time ever except it. 
krystal and i had quite the night saturday night, which would have been perfectly explainable if it was a full moon. which i think it was kinf of? but anyway we both decided how this summer was much better then i had originally thought when it was here. and we both miss it so much. i hate this not going back in time thing. i hate how everyone moves on. again with or without you. i dont accept when things dont go the way i think they should and that could possibly be the most ignorant thing ive ever said but really. i dont know

this entry is all over the place..on account that i am all over the place and whatever i think and whatever comes to my head is what i type im not even reading it over cuz i just feel that i need to type and get it all out even if it makes absolute no sense. 


on the bright side i finally got my senior pictures today!! =)


which still is another to the point of all the things we had been waitinf for forever coming fast. ughhhhhh


i cant think anymore..maybe ill fix it later"

"event","hm. so here i am avoiding an essay due tomorrow cuz i just dont want to do it. i just dont want to deal with school anymore. im sick of the getting up early and sitting thru classes and i dont know why. there not even that bad. i dont even have a lot of work. i just feel i need a serious break.. and not just from school from everything. its just all catching up with me and i dont know what to do. 

so senior freak week is over and its hit me that im a senior. and high school is ending faster then any of us know and its kind of serreal. i dont really like it. homecoming court was interesting but im so glad pre-tam and cynthia won king and queen they deserved it. but what gets under my skin is people who cheat and dont even care if they win. and dont even participate. i HATE that. 

and on top of working hard on my costumes and staying after school for student council and cheerleading to work on our ONLY senior rally.. the one rally we actually had this year. it was cut short. why does randolph suck so much? why is it so unfair to the class of 06 that did NOTHING wrong to deserve this? and why is no one caring and listening to how unjustly this is. im so sick of it and if i could transfer i so would. but that would be pointless.

and another thing. this whole life thing. when did life get so complicated? i mean. its always been complicated. life is never easy. but it just seems lately its been really hard. i couldnt even tell you why, cause i really truly do not know. but for a while its seemed like i havent been myself. im sure talking to me or anything i am the same person. but to me i seem so different and its really weird. i feel like everything is just speeding by and i dont have a chance to let it all sink in. im sure every person whose been a senior feels this way. but idk. its over whelming with college legit around the corner and already like 4 months of school completed. and having everything i put myself in charge of taking up all my free time on top of dance and work. now powderpuff which no one wants to take on ""cuz there too busy"" but i felt it was unfair to the senior class to not have a powder puff even tho im busy too. it sucks to be the one who cares. to be the one to always help out when i can and never get anything for it. not that i want something for it. but the most aggrivating thing in the world is to do good things and not get recognized for it.now i know how others feel. the cheerleaders had competition on thursday and i skipped dance to go support my team. even tho im not allowed to compete on the fact that i wasnt even supposed to be on the team and that was the agreement. i could do everything but compete. which hasnt been completely fair to me. but theres nothing i can do. 
and guys. i just do not understand them. why do they have to be so mean. i have a real big problem with ""nice guys that finish last"" not every nice guy finishes last. chances are theres a reason there like that such as secretly the girls that care about them more then they know are there but they take them for granted. not even thatso much. i dont even know what my issue is. this is why i cant watch shows like leguna beach i relate to them so much and i get so into them that i get into this deep thought and they make me wanna write lj entries liek this. and i dont even kno what im really talking about. there just things i feel i need to say. but i cant do this anymore. i cant keep trying and going on like nothing is wrong and hoping that the next time gets better. i cant keep falling for this false hope. 
i need a break from life. i hate feeling that way. i hate feeling like i need to escape from problems. when thats not going to help me any better. its like i feel trapped. tehres nothing i can do about it. no one can really help you. in life you can never truly feel happy. and if you do it doesnt last.now why is that? why arent you allowed to be happy? why cant life be worthwhile. i mean im sure in some cases it is. ive tried my best to do everything ive wanted to do. and to be happy. and most of the time i can sit back and have truly happy moments. things i want to remember. but really. it cant last. 
and this sounds almost cliche..but looking back to what i thought my life would be like once i got to high school its nothinggg how i thought it would be at all. i dont have that group of friends i hang out with in school everyday to walk to class with. i dont have that perfect boyfriend i dont have the straight A grades and top GPA scores to get into the college of my choice. its just not how i pictured it. however its a big change from where i was a few years ago. and its just strange. and no other way to describe it. but is life ever how u really wanted it to go? you cant decide how u really want your life to ultimately be. if theres one thing ive learned, especially lately. life doesnt ever turn out the way you want it to. theres always going to be something.. big or small standing in your way. and even if you try your best not to let it stand in your way it does. 
the biggest enemy in life is yourself. its the hardest person to go against. i think that i think too much. and it gets the best of me sometimes and leads to long entries such as this one. and maybe im the only one who feels this way.chances are i am not. not that i know what i need to make things better or even where to begin to try and make things better. or even if i need to make it better .you kind of need to figure out the problem before u can find a solution to it.

"event","on regards of the assembly that was wicked top secret for like weeks haha ..

so the assembly this morning was nice. it was weird walking into the gym and seeing all these officials and teachers and all the media there. people dressed up, i was walking into the gym to go practice and two teachers who i later found out were from schools around mass were like ""aw this is so nice are you our guide too?"" im like "" no but im singing"" haha and they were like excited. we sang an african song so we could keep everyone focused. lol and everyone seemed to like it .it was that african triology we sang like 2 years ago. Robert Townsend came to our school. he was on parenthood. and produced and directed and all of the above had involvement in a lot of hollywood things. haha idk i didnt really know who he was. i heard of him but wouldnt of been able to pick him out if i saw him on the street. haha go me. anyway not important. hten the govenor came in and talked to the crowd of students while all the tv. crews flocked over to him. 
 they started the program late and the president of each class and jocie for student council, gerrell for nhs and katrina for sac said the pledge..then we sang. it was weird with the tv cameras haha but kinda cool. then after all the officials had a turn to speak and what not the perident of the foundation there to present the award that no one knew about was talking and asked all the teachers to stand and be applauded. and yestarday a few of us heard how the school was getting $25,000. but of couse we were wrong.
 this is when the president of the milken foundation opened the envelope of an outstanding teacher at randolph high and read the name of ms. jasmine lellock. and the expression on her face was priceless. me and amanda sat next to eachother saying who we thought was going to get it and it was either her or kaps. but were glad she got it cuz she deserved it and we were all like crying for her. they called her husband and he was there to see the whole thing and she spoke and her first period class got to stay back and get interviewed for the media. it was nice =) course cuz im in that class. haha then she didnt have to teach for the rest of the day. 

i heard some girl in one of my classes say how if ms. wilde was still here she should of gotten the award cuz she deserved it most. and that comment made me laugh. not saying anything negitive towards ms. wild at all. that probably came out the wrong way. im just saying..shes not here anymore. and the girl who said the comment doesnt even know ms. lellock and clearly didnt understand how much she deserved it. but its nice not only to see her be recognized and not being nominated nor applying for it but to be found and for something actually positive to happen to randolph high =). and because the school actually behaved well get all the things we deserve. so go us for once.

"event","yeah so ive been wiiicked busy lately and its just going to keep getting worse and worse. but ive actually made it through another week and thats amazing. haha all these college applications and cut off dates and with work and school and extra- activities and cheerleading and freak week and now im doing powderpuff cuz no one wanted it when it shoulda been started.. whew.. im so over tired.

tomorrow is the assembly where the lovely govenor is coming. as is fox news and whoever else. romneys security crew is coming into school at 6 am to check out the school. and there is going to be 10 state troopers sitting on the side of the gym. the chorus is signing and if ur wondering why its in the gym its cuz thats the only place that can hold everyone. i dont kno why were having this assembly. and i dont kno if i like it cuz if we fuck up which is like enevitable for rhs. we lose EVERYTHING.. and i mean EVERYYYTHINGGG like freak week.. homecoming..prom. and i even heard graduation. but u kno how rumours are. we had announcements all day about how we have to be on our best behavior and all that jazz. so it shall be interesting..

then that nite is the game against E. bridgewater. should be fun
cheerleaders have competition next wed. and we just finished the routine today. not to mention we dont have music. thank god im not competing. but im still going to support them 

freak week is next week. how fucking weird? i think i got all my stuff. but its so scary that it came up so fast. then homecoming is the 4th for anyone whose wondering so anyone who can go def should! were playing scituate. see how the govenor ruins everything? if we played V. bridgewater we probably would have won making it the only game well prob. win this year. 
and its wicked gay that we can only have 4 days because all the seniors last year were only allowed four on the account it was a 4 day week.

so yeah i was bored. and i felt i needed to update. notice how like no one keeps up with there lj anymore. well not as much as we all used to. 

ive been sooo busy lately its clearly insane. but i love it. i love bein a SENIOR! def best year. my classes are pretty easy. its awesome to leave early. and so on..

oh and can i mention how my first payment for bahamasss is passed in? 204 days baby.. haha yeah thats far. but itll fly so its cool homie. i cant wait to go. i need a vacation like wooah..

but before the vacation comes applying to college. and deciding where i wanna go and what i wanna do with my life. and may i mention how it is the most scariest and weirdest thing ever. this is all happening wicked fast and i cant do a THING about stopping or slowing down the pase of time. its kinda crazy. the guidence office who i hate muchly came in to tell us about applying and such. i asked a few teachers to write me recommendations and such. and i got my northeastern application yestarday <3.. so weird. all we talk bout in school now is college and bahamas. haha i love it. im excited even if im scared about not knowing where my life will be this time next year. 

idk if im gunna take the SATs again. i know i should but i dont have the patience. haha idk im just scared i wont get in anywhere.. i hate the guidence office. i hate ms. gaynor she does NOTHING for me. she switched my schedule due to the fact they forgot to give me a math class.. which i guess wasnt that bad cuz i got to switch out of mr. kondrads class. there was no way i was staying in there. i hate that man. anyway..ms. gaynor is all about me going to a two year school. uh? no that messes up my whole plan. its not her call. thanks? whatever i dont wanna deal with her. but im gunna have to.
so anyway..

did i mention again how weird it is to be a senior? we had the yearbook meeting and just the fact that its ourrr yearbook is crazy,. adn that were the ones that run rhs now. idk filling out the yearbook profile and picking out your picture..filling out your portfolio.. things you thought ud never actually get to do. but now the time is here.. 
and ive been so busy with everything,. between school..after school activities cheerin..dance and work. but i lovve it. no games for twoo weeks.. then the rally on the 7th.. theres so much stuff due in october. not to mention the million days we have off? thanks to those jewish holidays.. haha then homecomingg oct. 28th cant waitt 

im glad pretty much everyone is enjoying college tho!hopefully ill be able to visit some of you or see you guys soon i missss youuu! 

as i act like people read this. im honestly just typing til my fingers feel like stopping so i apoligize if i repeat myself a billion and one times. 

but i think now my fingers hurt. and so do my eyes so ill finish later

 The Mayonnaise Jar and 2 Cups of Coffee When things in your lives seem almost too much to handle, when 24 hours in a day are not enough, remember the mayonnaise jar and the 2 cups of
 coffee.

 A professor stood before his philosophy class and had some items in front of him.  When the class began, he wordlessly picked up a very large and empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with golf balls.  He then asked the students if the jar was full.  They agreed that it was.
           The professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar.
 He shook the jar lightly.  The pebbles rolled into the open areas between the golf balls.  He then asked the students again if the jar was  full.
 They agreed it was.

 The professor next picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand filled up everything else.  He asked once more if the jar was full.  The students responded with an unanimous ""yes.""

 The professor then produced two cups of coffee from under the table and poured the entire contents into the jar effectively filling the empty space between the sand.  The students laughed.

 ""Now,"" said the professor as the laughter subsided, ""I want you to recognize that this jar represents your life.  The golf balls are the important things--your family, your children, your health, your friends and your favorite passions---and if everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full.

 The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house andyour car.

 The sand is everything else---the small stuff.  ""If you put the sand into the jar first,"" he continued, ""there is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls.  The same goes for life.  If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff you will never have room for the things that are important to you.

 ""Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness.  Play with your children.  Take time to get medical checkups.  Take your  spouse out to dinner.  Play another 18.  There will always be time to clean the house and fix the disposal.  Take care of the golf balls first---the things that really matter.  Set your priorities.  The rest is just sand.""

 One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the coffee represented.  The professor smiled.  ""I'm glad you asked.

 It just goes to show you that no matter how full your life may seem, there's always room for a couple of cups of coffee with a friend."""

summers been alright. hanging out a lot with krystal, loove that girl. we went to the parade and fireworks on sunday. then to various places after only to end up at luchas cousins house at like 2 am.  we were the only girls. and i tripped..that was embarrassing.aha anyway then yestarday iwent to the beach with karen. where two guys one who looked like vin diseal who was 26 and the other guy was 20. we thought they were throwing food at us cuz the seagulls kept coming. idk weird. and if the day couldnt get anymore sketchy/weird some older guy sat on the rocks behind us and took pics of us. so the guys came and introduced themselves to tell us about the sketchy weird guy..gotta love the beach.

then me and krystal attempted the canton fireworks but those got cancelled cuz the ashes were burning people.. and thats just about it.. 

one random thing ive happend to kinda notice. is a few weeks ago everyone was happy. everyone seemed to have found someone and what not everything was good.. now all you hear about is drama and how everyones unhappy and breaking up and going through problems and messed up. they just seem to be hurting eachother..iduno maybe thats just me. but its just kinda weird. you like/love someone for so long. or maybe not long at all. and one morning someone just wakes up and is like "" i dont like/love them anymore."" and its over.
hm..idk i thought i had more to say but i guess not. oh well"

thursday i think was the worst day of my life..and it still feels like i dreamed it =/
    took kaps dating page exam. wasnt even that bad even tho i got like a 70.. 

friday i was supposed to go into boston with krystal and we almost made it..but made other plans. im not sure if that was such a good idea. =/ 

saturday: was my dance recital it was fun and sad cuz i loose one of my closest friends from dance cuz shes going to college so that was sad. but this guy whose daughter dances came up to me after and gave me the best compliment i could have ever gotten and it def made my day =)
   then krystal and i drove to the cape. poor girl over the bridge! we get there..it was like creepy cuz it was so dead. and the place was wicked cute. i stayed up til 6..krystal bet justin she would be up til 7. poor girl.. ""u wont""  but lemme tell you.. monopoly def passes time. and of course the music videos helped. then at 4:45 am we went to the beach and it was low tied so we attempted to watch the sunrise and walked as far as we could. it was nice

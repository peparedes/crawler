"event","...and yet another hurricane plagues our weekend plans. Well, the good side to all this weather drama is that i finally caught up with sleep, which by many came highly recommended. I'll admitt...this week was tough. My act's were rescheduled to next saturday, which is a huge plus because now I have an extra week to study. 

So the new Katie Holmes film came out yesterday. I feel a girl's night next saturday ;) I'm a huge sucker for every single chick flick ever made not to mention I'm a huge Katie Holmes fan as well. I've seen every single Dawson's Creek episode...obssessed? I think so...lol

Anyway, I should be going tomorrow to the stores with my mommy to look for a homecoming dress. I can't wait for the dance. It's our last homecoming...but I'm sure it'll be the best :D 

A valuable rule that all females should abide by..lol 

pcurb86: hey remember my friend's rule 
pcurb86: if you're drunk and you cant remember it never really happened 
naby816: lol
pcurb86: you have nothing to be guilty of 
naby816: i love your rule

A certain person posted an ignorant comment in a friend's journal.  

Note to Asshole: The next time you leave a self-righteous comment in her journal...keep in mind that karma's a bitch. So in case you were never taught to respect other people's personal things...learn it now... cause what goes around comes around prick. Grow up and get the balls to write your name next time.  

Ok! So...on a lighter note :D

We finished filming our video for Soriano yesterday...lol...wow...definitely some x-rated stuff in it. Good times :P Hope he likes it ::crosses fingers::

"event","Hey guys! Just got back from Orlando a couple of hours ago. We had a really good time! I missed my sis like crazy and it was great to finally see her. Her apartment was super duper cute. The have a huge living room, open kitchen, and a nice bathroom. She shares it with three other sweet girls. I can't wait till homecoming. She's coming down just for me ;) YAY! 

I shoud be getting my dress, shoes, and make-up by this weekend ::crossing fingers:: I have so many dress ideas..I just have no clue, which one I'll settle for. Can you believe it? I'm actually nervous. I get nervous for these dances...and for every stupid thing. The funny thing is that I have absolutely no reason to be. I'm going with my best friend so it should be tons of fun. 

Ugh...I really wish I could have been there Friday for Senior Blast Off. Annie sent me some pics of the guys. They looked freaking hilarious. I loved the Risky Business idea. Mad props for that one ;) I'm glad everyone had a lot of fun and I can't wait to see some more pics.

Dany got back from Texas. He won third place and tons of cool stuff. Congrats buddy! You deserve it :)

Well, just a quick little update because I have mad homework to do. Hope all is well with eveyone. See you guys tomorrow :D

"event","A broken heart should be able and willing to heal, right?

The irony of it all is when the feelings you thought you couldn't feel for people begin to come out.

You're in denial...scared...unsure...

You want to feel loved again but you're afraid to experience something new...something different...

It's amazing how much damage just one person can do to another. How selfish their motives can be. How they lack any feeling of respect toward their ""one true love"" or so they claim.

Words such as ""I love her"" or ""I really do care about her"" are complete and utter lies...

Such sweet words become hated and the more they're heard, the more your repulsed.

Ask me if I believe in love now. My response will be a simple ""No, I don't think I ever really did find it""...or maybe the real expression of love hasn't found me yet. 

Whatever the answer may be...I've let go. I'm not turning back and my last tear will dry up. For the senseless, idiotic, pathetic, and heartless assholes out there who have hurt the girl they truly claim to be in love...here's a reality check. We do move on and I promise you that your worthless ass is the last thought that will cloud our minds. You'll have no one left to turn to. No one left who will comfort your miserable heart.

The next time I cry will be for something worth the tears. The next time I cry, it'll be because someone else has made me happy beyond my wildest dreams.

The end."

"event","Today was a fairly good day with the exception of several incompetent office personnel that constantly delay students in getting their work done...w/e...let's not touch that subject.

This week has been pretty stressful with homework, test, etc. For some odd reason it was difficult to sleep last night. I slept absolutely nothing. Zip, Zero, Nada...definitely completed an all time sleep deprivation record. Nothing I'm proud of...but I know I'm going to crash disgustingly tonight. Too many things worrying me. It's taken a toll on my patience, that's for sure. I've become awkwardly bipolar these past few days. It's just difficult to accept change and attitudes from people. You can't read people. No matter how hard you try, you'll never really know what they're thinking or perceiving. When you think it means something it probably means something else. People are just so frustrating...ugh!! 

Sometimes you just want to say or do something but the words don't come out...ever! The concept is ludicrous when it comes from someone that isn't shy but at times you just rather not take the risk. The what if factor seems to down play for a bit and it's better just to be left oblivious. I just wish everyone came with some sort of manual. Life would be way easier and you would be able to stop yourself from making any sort of mistake. 

I'm beginning to detest the idea of love. I mean don't get me wrong...I don't really hate seeing happy couples anymore because after all their relationship seems to be working out and hell, why shouldn't they be happy, right? 

It just hurts that you're not able to prevent the negative things from occurring. That's the worst feeling...giving up. I've never been a quitter and I still can't give up on certain things. Whether it's good or bad...who knows?... 

On a lighter note :D

Mari wanted me to post my whacked out experience on Tuesday in the girls restroom. So here goes...

NOTE: This situation would of course only occur to me and only me. Based on true events and not a creation of my weird and crazy mind...please proceed to reading ;)

So I rush out of Art History to use the bathroom and as I'm doing #1, I hear a guys voice in the stall next to me. Obviously surprised, I look under and sure enough it's a guy. But not only is he talking but he's also peeing!! WTF?! yes! WTF?! So I continue to look under and he's not peeing like any normal guy! His feet are facing the stall door and not the toilet. Craziness! So me being the nerd I am...I tap his shoulder the moment he comes out. I ask him...excuse me...are you a guy? The moment he turns I yell ""Omg! You are a guy!"" and I quickly storm out of the restroom. From now on this unidentified possible female/male...sex still undetermined creature has been labeled penis boy...LMAO...

Penis boy, if you're out there...keep it in the pants and stay away from the girls bathroom. :P

So there you have it. Hope you enjoyed probably the most humiliating story of my life.


Bu-Bye Luvs!

Ps: Pep rally tomorrow! C/O 2005!!! WHOOT-WHOOT!!"

Well, I'm still sick as a dog :( and the worst part is that i lost my voice completely the moment i got home.

I went shopping in the morning with my mom. I bought a side bag for school..definitely needed one. A purse only works for the first week and then the books begin to pile up. After wards, my grandparents came over and we had lunch. I feel lucky to have all four of my grandparents :D. They're awesome! 

Then it was time to get ready for the evening. A group of us ended up going to Monty's and we ate and hung out. It was fun except I was feeling a little sick :( My throat hurt and today I'm really feeling the stress. My throat is super hoarse. After Monty's, we went to Starbucks and then chilled at my house for awhile. 

Tomorrow is the day we go to print. I'm a little nervous. Other than that...school and college applications are stressing me out. I hope this hard work pays off in the long run. Well, I'm off to finish hw :/ Until later...

Not counting today there is one day left till school starts. Yuck...more stress..I can feel it. This week was a definite preview of what awaits me. I really need to take up yoga or some form of stress relief. I've already bought aroma therapy and a stress ball..haha..yup..big loser..I know but I need it or I'll end up murdering someone. :P

We decided to see Little Black Book...oh man...girls, wait for rental...the movie was funny but the ending stunk and this is coming from the ultimate chick flick fanatic. Truly disappointed..::sigh::...

Anyway! So we ended up passing by the guys rent thing and then the real fun began...hehe...O:) Things got a little crazy but the drive home was the best according to Mari and Patty. It's shocking how much shit you talk when you're drunk...LMAO...how the hell do you screw a tree?...don't ask..LOL!...OH!!!...Mari, Patty found the camera...LMAO...you know what that means...heh...another chick night in the works. :P

Tomorrow is the first day back for newspaper. I'm really excited. Now the real work begins and I used last night to prepare and we got plenty done. I need to get used to waking up early for school...not the most pleasant person in the morning...:/

So Patty and I began making the preparations for my birthday. I'm getting excited!! I really want to have a birthday weekend. Non stop partying..WHOOT!...LOL..We'll see how that works out. :) Well luvs till my next entry. :D

I got a pretty bad virus and it feels like more than that...

Everything at this point is alright. I truly don't have one word that can describe or illustrate how I'm feeling. I still have faith that everything will eventually get better. It's pointless to let something or many things bring you down. I learned that the hard way and it never really got me anywhere. I've observed that it's best for things to take their own course and to prioritize the goals you want most in life. Honestly, I just want senior year to be fun, exciting, and filled with more positive than negative memories. It's impossible to erase the past. No matter how hard I've wanted to, it just never works out that way. 

Sure...it would be easy to burn, throw away, donate, etc. things that were given to you but what will that solve? What would it prove? 

In the long run you'll be left with regret and the old memories that can't be erased from your mind. I've decided to keep everything and resist the temptation. No matter how bad it gets...it was all worth it. My main objective now is healing and maybe with time even forgiveness...

"event","Wow! My first journal entry...thanks to Jo! :) Now...where to begin? Well, last night was a blast. I went out with Patty to Fuddruckers (her first time) ;) I love that place. It's so cute and the food is great. After wards, we picked up Andy and headed to Coldstone's for some ice cream. Everything people say about that place is so true. The ice cream tastes incredible and you get to put anything and everything in it. It was definitely worth it. We decided to chill at Tina's until it was time to head home. 

As for the summer...I can't complain. It's been pretty relaxing and a much needed vacation from all the chaos that school brings. 

I've already made a list of all the universities I'm planning on applying to. They're about six or seven and definitely out of state. The idea of going far away from home has never scared me. Instead, it's encouraged me. The experience and independence you receive from leaving home is definitely worth all the hard work. I just pray I get accepted and with enough money to pay for all the expenses. 

I think the hardest part of leaving will be the fact that I'll miss all my friends and maybe even my family if they don't piss me off before I leave. 

At this point...I'm lost with a certain predicament. I don't know what to do or if I even want to do anything about it. It's so true...trust is the hardest thing to build and the easiest thing to break. The only thing I can do is hope for the best and pray for some sort of ending...

"event","well...had a interesting week...lets start it off...it hasn't even been a full week....but lets go here....
Played Football with Alex and crew today....it was fun..but then my memories came back to me today about my younger years a bit...like back to when my closest friend was a white kid by the name of Bobby..he was cool...it took him forever to learn how to play some of the sports(like football)....but it was cool...he started to become really good until he had to move...can't even remember where he moved to....it drives me nuts that I lost contact with him..."

"event","well...........time for a big rant......
Got into a fight at school...with one of my best friends no doubt....he was behind my back talking trash about me to my GF...the main problem is that she believed most of it because she would never come and talk to me about it.....I finally cornored her yesterday and got it out of her......I am going to forgive her..but I don't know if she will forgive me....the school really laid into me..I guess they do have a problem if you smack a kids head against a locker and dent the locker...but he tried to deny everything...why would Daisy lie to me....she hasn't yet in the 3 yrs. we have been dateing....Alex says I shouldn't think to hard on it...I just hope she will forgive me."

Forty-two stairs from the street
Crooked landing, crooked landlord
Narrow laneway filled with crooks.
This is where we used to live.</em>
<em>
--Barenaked Ladies</em>

That song always resonated with me. I remember leaving each place I've lived for the last time; at my first house in Lowell when I was 9, I wrote a letter describing our family and left it on the wood-burning stove. Even then, I wanted to leave my mark on the place. 

We may leave homes behind, but they never leave us. 

Paul and I left our apartment on Goldsmith Street for the last time today. It was our first home together, and it held a lot of character the way only old buildings can. It was a working horse farm--riding lessons, horse buns, dirt driveway and all. Even the coin-op laundry machine was often filled with horse hair. 

The house had many minor annoyances, which, looking back, will provide great stories and fond memories. From the upstairs neighbor whose four dogs used our porch as a toilet, to the mysterious fireplace pipe sticking out of our ceiling, to the old-fashioned freezer that filled itself with snow--there was a lot to keep life interesting. 

On our last trip to the apartment, we collected most of the remaining junk: a few buckets, the microwave, and the front door mat. We decided to leave a roll of toilet paper behind. On our way out, we took some pictures to remind us of the quirky charm that characterizes the place we called home for nineteen months:

The front door of our apartment, variously known as Apt. 2 Front, Apt. 2L and Apt. #5, yet our mailbox was Box #8. In order to receive packages, we asserted the most convenient designation and bought ourselves a door number. None of the other apartments in the building have one.

Our wonderful freezer, snowy as the North Pole. Ancient instructions on the freezer door warned us to empty the freezer completely once a month, turn off the power and allow the ice to melt. It also instructed us not to allow the frost to grow more than a 1/2 inch thick. Unfortunately, that took no more than a day or two to occur, so we gave up.

The basement ceiling was less than 6 feet high. Paul was forced to duck when he went down there, and I always did too, lest my hair get stuck on cobwebs and old nails. I used the washer and dryer infrequently, preferring to bring laundry to my parents'; not only because of the leap-frog you had to play to avoid the puddles, but also because the washing machine only took half a load and cost a dollar.

This is what I called the Ex-Fireplace; an unsightly, misshapen column in the center of the house. Once useful, now only a piece of abstract art. I tried to come up with ideas for decorating it, such as wrapping it with Christmas lights and hanging a pine display on it.   It was heavily caked with plaster, so shoving in hooks to hang things was a challenge. After one unsuccessful attempt to place a nail, I plugged the resulting hole with some white poster putty, and stuck the nail into it like a candle in a cake.

A curiosity--an elevator of old design. It used to connect to a pulley on the third floor deck. Friends theorized that it might have been used to transport hay, when the entire house was a working farm, but we never inquired. It will likely remain a mystery--to us, anyway.

This is a view from our deck which shows the Pee Deck up above. It took us awhile before we realized why we heard loud trickling coming from the porch every night, when it wasn't raining. The neighbor, too lazy to walk her four dogs, allowed them to pee on her deck, which splashed through onto ours. We learned to avoid the half of the deck which was underneath hers. In fact, some of my guests nearly got drenched at my bridal shower. It was a triumphant day when we saw a moving truck pull up to take the neighbor and her dogs away.

A photo for nostalgia to wrap up the post. This was our first home together, and it seems like we were there much longer than a year and a half. When we first moved in, I was just finishing college. I commuted to three different jobs while living there; Paul, two. We got our first cat together and brought her home there. We got married. And we decided that we like the town, we like the area, and we went through the months of bureaucratic madness it took to become homeowners, two miles down the road. 

<em>I know we don't live here anymore
We bought an old house on the Danforth
She loves me and her body keeps me warm
I'm happy there
But this is where we used to live.</em>"

Name a movie...

1) that makes you sad:
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

2) that makes you laugh your ass off:
Clerks 2

3) that was way better than you thought it would be:
Clerks 2

4) that brings out the romantic in you:
What Dreams May Come

5) that has awesome dvd extra features:
Holy Grail has the Lego song, I can't think of anything that beats that.

6) that is totally underrated:
I don't really know what the general populous thinks of movies. Girl, Interrupted is really good. 

7) that you can recite every line of dialogue to:
The Matrix (And many Futurama episodes, if that counts)

8) that words cannot describe:
Words can describe anything, sometimes it's just hard. V for Vendetta, Eternal Sunshine and The Prestige are very thought-provoking.

9) that is super sexy:
Chicago, Fight Club

10) that has a great soundtrack:
Garden State

11) that you really want to see:
Borat (maybe tonight)

12) that you have no interest in seeing:
Mean Girls

13) that you geek out over:
The Matrix

14) that puts you in an emotional melancholy state of mind:
Eternal Sunshine

15) that scares the hell outta you:
The Prestige really got to me the first time, but in the good way. 

16) that makes you feel like a kid again:
Willy Wonka, the original

17) that inspires you:
What Dreams May Come made me want to paint more, when I recently rewatched it. There have been others that involve art that also inspire me to make it, but I can't think of them. The Dresden Dolls DVD inspires me, but it's not a movie.

18) that proves all remakes don't suck:

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, although it is very different, it is good in its own way.

19) that wasn't as funny as you thought it'd be:
Clerks. I actually much prefer the sequel. 

20) that deserves a sequel:
I'd enjoy something like V again, but there's really nowhere for it to go. 

21) that should never have happened:
Matrix 2 and 3

22) that has a kick ass movie poster:
Spiderman 3, because it changes as you walk by so subtly that you barely notice.

23) that has a kick ass dvd case:
V for Vendetta

24) that is one of your guilty pleasures:
The only thing I can really think of that would qualify is the Suicide Girls movie.

"event","Those gerbils are smart, fast little animals. 

My day became worrisome when my gerbil, The Small, didn't respond to my tapping on the cage. I was in a rush to get to work, so I assumed she was sleeping and left the house. Still, I was concerned, so I asked Paul to go over to my house and check on the rodents (current count: two gerbils and one hamster, each in its own cage.) 

He called several hours later to say that The Small was missing. He checked her cage and found an escape hole in the back of it, a result of the cage being put back together incorrectly. I came home as soon as I could, which took an hour from work, and Paul and I went to my house to look for her. She wasn't in the closet or under the bed, so we put her cage and food down on the ground, as well as her favorite snack, oats. We also scattered pieces of cardboard around, so if we heard chomping we'd know where to look. 

A few hours proved fruitless. We decided a gerbil couldn't fit under the apartment door, so we assumed she was still in the house somewhere. A scary fact, however, was that the landlord had been working on some pipes in my wall and hadn't closed up the hole yet, so we were afraid she'd get lost in the walls. I reassured Paul that she was smart and might come back for food. 

We took a break with some Frisbee at Paul's house, and upon our return, found that some of the oats we had put out were gone. Happily, this meant that The Small was still in the house. We emptied the closet where the oats were, but she wasn't there. Frustrated and tired, I tried to sleep, while Paul stayed up and watched Futurama. 

An hour or so after I had gone to bed, Paul was walking to the kitchen when he saw a gray tail dart under the fridge. He called for me and I jumped out of bed, and dizzily wandered to the kitchen. We grabbed the flashlight and looked under the fridge, but couldn't see our friend. Paul brought the cage and we scattered some oats near the opening at the bottom of the fridge, and waited. 

I put my head down to the floor and strained to look. I saw lots of gray dust bunnies, easy for The Small to camouflage herself in. I sat quietly with my head to the floor, containing my urge to sneeze, and finally I saw The Small wandering over. I took some oats and pushed them near her, slowly. I saw her head dart out into the room, and then she ran back. I didn't want to just grab her, or she'd get away, so I had to wait for the perfect moment to strike. 

She seemed intrigued by the flashlight, which I left on, exposing her hiding spot. She smelled my hand and ran away, but eventually wandered back. I kept as still as possible, and cautiously, she stepped out. I waited until her entire body was out from under the fridge, and expertly darted my hands out to scoop her up and into the waiting cage. Paul and I shared a sigh of relief, a hug and a dance of joy. We rescued The Small!"

"event","I am still feeling kind of numb. I haven't entirely dealt with this fact yet. I didn't have time to officially say goodbye to her. I got the call at 10 in the morning that they were putting her down at 11, because that was the only time they could. Not enough time to go home. 

Although, I've been saying goodbye to her for at least two weeks. We all knew this was coming, and mentally prepared for it as much as possible. This is first big death in my life. There have been no grandparents' deaths, no close family members or friends. Animals beforehand (birds, gerbil, rabbit) have not been as significant as this. 

Brandy was part of the family. Very much so. She had a distinct personality and treated everyone differently. She often snubbed me, just to be a tease, because I would be the one most longing for her attention. She loved certain friends and family that came to visit, and ignored others. In recent years, she liked to lie in the doorway, blocking it. Perhaps for the attention, perhaps to guard it, but she made it her post until the end. 

Brandy lived to be 12. It was 1994 when we got her, when I was in fourth grade. She grew up with my brother and I, and was with us at three homes. She was generally healthy throughout her life, except for being overweight (fitting in with the rest of us, of course.) We found out she had two types of severe cancer about a week ago, after she had been old and arthritic for a year or two. The cancer was very harsh, and she was having trouble breathing and moving. So today it was time. 

She was very special to me. I cried every time I thought about her getting sick for the past two years, since it was apparent that she was getting old. We all loved her very much and always will. 

She was not just our dog. She was a Davis.

"event","The people in my Psychology class today almost made me walk out. 

This was toward the end of class, after I was already annoyed at a stupid 420 joke some jerk made earlier. The teacher had made three graphs, and we had to go up and place a dot on each graph, indicating height vs. shoe size, etc. She was explaining direct/perfect correlation, imperfect correlation, and no correlation. She was trying to demonstrate the point that ""correlation does not imply causation"", so she asked this question:

""One study found that among a certain population, the number of obese women had a positive correlation with the amount of crime in the town. Why might this be?""

As you might guess, people came up with brilliant answers.

""They're upset because they're fat so they go commit crimes."" 
""They're stressed out because they commit crimes so they get fat."" 
""They're stealing food.""
""The women are scared about the crime in the city so they stay in the house and eat.""

ARGH.
First of all, the question obviously did not say that the ""obese women"" were the ones CAUSING the crimes. How likely does it really seem that a bunch of overweight mothers were suddenly the leading cause of crime in any given community? 

The reason, if you couldn't guess, is that both crime and (God, I hate the word) <em>obesity</em> are results of poverty. Crime is pretty obvious, and junk food is cheaper than healthy food - as the professor pointed out, one red pepper costs more than a bag of chips. 

But what made me angry is the stupid and hurtful things these people said. Some of them think it's hilarious, and some of them just blurt out the first conclusion that they can think of, however illogical. I hate the notions people have about the reasons people are fat. Whether or not it's ""their fault"": ""They don't care about themselves."" ""They might have a health problem."" ""They're depressed and eat all the time."" ""They don't want to look good."" These are all things I have personally heard people say, and that's why it makes me so angry when people don't understand how hard that is to listen to. It makes you not want to go to the doctor, because they'll chastise you too. It's a rough world. 

And why can't people just think about what they're saying? Hey, how about this: 
<em>Why don't we think about the reasons you're a jackass?</em>"

If you know anyone who might like to buy these (think Halloween!) please tell them. I have 6 sets made already, and I'll custom-make them in any size, shape or color for people. 

If you're my friend and you want to buy them, I'll take whatever price you want to give me. :-)

"event","I've had some minor apartment problems before, such as my pilot lights repeatedly going out, the house being really hot, my window screen falling out, and the toilet continuing to run, but this was the first big, immediate and (as if there were a convenient time) 2am emergency.

I had been napping since 9pm, originally thinking I would get up in a little while and do some work, but since had decided to go to bed for good. I was getting up to turn off the lights and say goodnight to Paul, when I went looking for my pajama pants in the bathroom. I picked them up and realized they were soaked, and so was the orange rug. The toilet had been overflowing! 

I had no idea how long ago this happened, so I thought maybe if I flushed it again the problem would fix itself. Not so. It overflowed and began flooding the bathroom. I threw a towel on the floor, and it was still running and was about to run into the kitchen. I grabbed my nearby basket of dirty laundry and began throwing it on the floor to soak it up and dam off the bathroom flood. I hopped through the swamp and took the cabinet from the back of the toilet, carrying it out into the kitchen and throwing a bunch of things that were on top of it into the bathtub. I've never understood the mechanics of toilets and  ran away whenever problems emerged at my parents' house, but I took a look and pulled on some thing that made it stop filling. I held it for a minute, trying to figure out how to make sure it would stay there. I let go, and it stayed by itself, but I went and got some tape to make sure. 

I decided I had a few options: I could wake up a neighbor to ask for a plunger/help, or I could call my landlord. However, I chose to not compound my current problems with my social anxiety.
The plan of action was to head to the 24-hour CVS and buy a plunger. (If my mom had realized I didn't have one, she'd have fixed that long ago, but I hadn't gotten around to it.) I went down to my car and hoped that the toilet wouldn't magically being running again, and also that it wouldn't start dripping into a neighbor's apartment downstairs. I drove to the CVS, and bought a plunger as well as some candy corn and adhesive wall hooks, as to be less embarrassing. I returned to the same condition as before, except that the water had all drained from the toilet. Cautiously, I took the tape off of the toilet mechanism to let it fill again and try to plunge it, which didn't work very well because the plunger was junk, but it seemed like it was ok anyway. I flushed it twice to make sure it was working. Since that seemed fixed, I had to deal with the problem of cleaning up.

I sloppily picked up the sopping clothing and put it into my less-favored laundry basket. Overfilled with heavily soaked clothes, it probably weighed 100 pounds. I decided my only choice was to bring it down to the basement and put it in the laundry, so I dragged it down the stairs and outside, through the rain to the basement entrance. Lucky me - it was locked, and I had no idea how to open it. My house key didn't work. There was no way I could carry it back upstairs, nor did I wish to have it in my house, so it went into my car where I'll try to deal with it in the morning. 
I returned to my apartment and began mopping up the bathroom and kitchen. I mopped with some Soft Scrub and then tried to dry it all off, and then wiped down the tub, the sink where I threw the rug, the toilet, the corners of the floor, etc. with the wet cleaning wipes and some paper towels. I decided that it was the best I could do (although I can't smell things either way, so I hope I'm right) and I put the cabinet and the items back. I hung the rug out on my fire escape. 

I know I haven't been bothered to write lately, but I thought you all could enjoy this learning experience. This whole escapade took about two hours, so that could be worse, and at least my first class isn't until 11am. I think I did pretty well though - very quick thinking and problem solving, and I didn't panic, just took action.

Candy corn time."

"event","I haven't updated in a long time and I apologize to anyone who has been compulsively checking, waiting for the day when they'll see my Zoidberg icon again. 

Today is my last day of babysitting, and I'm glad. It hasn't been a bad job - although it had its difficulties, such as fighting kids, long hours and frustrating transportation issues - but I'm glad I'll have a little time off to play before school begins. I've worked ALL summer. This is the first summer that I've been so busy. It's been very, very different, probably for all my friends. It was the first summer I didn't spend hanging out with my friends all the time. Also, I got my own place, but had to shuttle back and forth between Fitchburg and Chelmsford and Arlington constantly. It was rather insane; more on that later, hopefully.
Also, one of my best friends was gone, away in California, and that made my idea of summer very different. There are certain things I do that are Steve-things, Steve-inspired, and without him it just isn't the same. Many things aren't the same, and in most ways that's okay, but change can be hard. I miss hanging out with my entire group at once. I haven't been able to do that a single time this summer - the closest try was Diana's party, but Steve's absence was still clear. Other times, other friends have been busy/working/absent for whatever reason. Working and commuting has mostly consumed me, and I've not seen my friends almost any days after getting out of work. I've seen Paul the most, but he has been working many hours as well, and our schedules have completely clashed, making it really difficult. 
So, on the friends note, things are changing rapidly. And that's inevitable and everyone has to accept it. We're all moving along with our lives and going in various directions. And we can all certainly stay friends, but it begins to take more and more effort. I'm glad I have such wonderful friends, though, that we can have a great time together even if we haven't seen each other in a long while. I'm very thankful for that, and for you all. 

I haven't been updating lately because I've felt that there's too much to say, and I haven't wanted to try and make a huge post on Bill's computer. The keyboard is strange, and it works okay, but I do make a lot of mistakes on it (the keys are squishy. SQUISHY, literally) and it discourages me from embarking on a significant piece of writing. However, I've learned a lot from babysitting and working with kids all summer, and I would like to write a bunch of it out, for the sake of my memory and for (hopefully) my faithful readers' interest. I will soon have an internet connection at my apartment, and this will help accomplish that task, as well as many others. It will also make Paul more willing to stay there. ;-) TV will be nice too.

Other updates:

I am awaiting a desk from Bill. I am using it right this moment, and have been for the past few weeks. I like it very much; it's very sturdy. He said I could have it, since he and Talya are redoing her office and switching desks around. I hope this happens soon. 
On the same note, I would still also like a couch. I am planning on moving things around in the apartment, bringing in the other set of shelves and moving the existing ones. I have been putting up a lot of artwork and decorations lately, and it's really cool. I love decorating my living space. It's pretty much all I did last fall, when I had almost no school friends, and it made me feel good. I had a lot of affection for my tiny room, since it was so personalized. That's what I hated about the dorm - having to move out so frequently. However, I have learned a few things about decorating from that practice, and I'm really enjoying my current projects. The walls are becoming increasingly covered with posters and artwork, including a project of my own, and I even bought a plant. :-)

I am getting a new car tomorrow! I had a difficult time deciding between a car from our mechanic and the car Bill offered to us, but I decided to go with the one from Gary. It's a '95 red Honda Civic, and is reported to be in very good condition. I was leaning toward Bill's car, a '95 Buick Regae, because it was bigger, more powerful and I assumed it would have a better feel to the steering and be easier to see out of. I haven't driven either of them, however, so those were guesses based on Paul's Buick, and Bill's affection toward the car. The Honda, though, will be significantly cheaper on gas, and should be for parts too. So I decided it's a better investment. It was a close call, though. I'm just happy that I won't have to drive Colin's car anymore - which I dislike very much - and that we won't have to shuffle the family around with trying to share. I'm very thankful that my parents can afford everyone their own cars. 

In my week and a half off before school begins, I will be pretty busy. I am going camping this weekend with Emma, which will be some wonderful and relaxing quality time that we have both missed. Then, I hope to be going camping with Paul for a short time as well, while simultaneously visiting Funspot to play classic arcade games. In addition, I have to attend a court arbitration, to debate an arbitrary car accident in which I arbitrarily tapped another guy's car, and he claimed to be non-arbitrarily injured and rejected the insurance company's settlement proposal. 
There's also my grandparents' 50th anniversary party, which my family has been working on planning for months. 

School begins on the 1st for me, but most of my friends begin a week later. That's ok. I'm pretty excited about school. My classes sound good, and I've ordered my books from Amazon at a big discount from the school price. I think this new start will be very positive. 

I suppose this was a rather long update after all; as I said, there's a lot to say. The girls would very much like to go to the library, however, so I have to rearrange the mountain of crap in my car for them to do so. I hope you all enjoy the final weeks of summer.

"event","'Twas a lovely day in Boston yesterday. I went in with the girls to celebrate Harmony's seventh birthday, and I was happy to be back. We went to the park and rode the swan boats, saw some baby ducks, and ate pizza and ice cream. I was pleased to go back to New York Pizza near my school, and as a treat I took them to Ben and Jerry's. It was an expensive ice cream outing, during which they managed to cover themselves in chocolate. We walked around, looked in a few stores and wandered through the Prudential Center shops. Cassidy was interested in a fancy jewelry shop, and we also looked in the candy store. The girls spotted the little courtyard/park outside the Pru, so we went there and they ran around for awhile and played in the fountain while I relaxed. We then got back on the T and traveled home. It was a nice day, a fairly long outing for them. I think we all enjoyed it. 

It's so nice to show Boston to people. I lived there for two years, and appreciated it some, but rarely went out anywhere. I do miss walking around, although not to class, but just those days and nights wandering around with your friends. I remember going into the city some time in high school, looking around and realizing ""What a cool place. I want to go to school here."" 
Boston was high on my list of priorities for a college, and Emerson seemed so perfect at the time. I'm glad I experienced it, but I'm also glad it's over. I love being able to go into Boston for an outing, but living there - with the slush and the traffic on the T and having to walk to get groceries - is not a life I'm really cut out for. But I'll always be affectionate toward it. There is a lot that I appreciate, and was happy to revisit yesterday. The ducks, especially. The art on the red line. Even my school, where I used my Emerson ID to get us in to use the bathroom, was nice to see once again. 
It's especially fun to show things to others because you notice things that you became used to, that you learned to take for granted, like how fancy and adorned the lobby of the Little building is. And I remember feeling that way, being rather awed by it myself - but over time I started to hate the building, not because of its decorations but because of the fear of confronting people who disliked me. But that's all finished now. I've moved on, and I'm not bitter anymore. That chapter is over, and I am better for it, as unpleasant as it became. I value the good memories still, even though these same people eventually came to hate me. 
Such is life. It changes. That's ok. 

I am, however, happy that I'll be able to visit Boston on many weekends this year, yet not have to live there. I'm looking forward to it."

Arg. So annoyed. It's been a long week, working 9 1/2 hours a day. I got a nice paycheck today, but still, I just want to go home. My brother's car is in the shop now, so I'm screwed for a few days because the transmission is all messed up. My dad drove me to work today and is picking me up, and it looks like it'll be that way for another half a week. That sucks because I wanted to take the girls to a museum on Wednesday, but I'll have no car. 
Even more annoying, though, is the weekend. I'm stranded. I've been at my house all week, and I really want to get back to my apartment to see my gerbils and find out if I have any new packages. I want to see my boyfriend and work on the Bender painting that I promised to an Internet nerd. I've been thinking about making a bag (purse type thing) and I want to look at the fabric store, maybe get some things. Take a weekend off to have fun and relax. The kids are really stressing me out right now, and I just need a break. And now there's this car problem to make me more frustrated. I just want to go home!

I haven't been getting the sleep I need, nor the time to do many things I'd like to. Life is difficult. I'm doing my best. I hope things become resolved.
Babysitting does give me computer time, though, but since it is not on my own computer it is limited against picture-sending and such. 

I may be acquiring Bill's car at some point. This would be useful. I hate my brother's car, although I appreciate his lending it to me so I can work. I probably hate most cars at this point, though. I have been driving 2+ hours a day almost every day this summer. If I had air conditioning, that would help a lot, but it still would not be fun. There are only so many things you can do to safely amuse yourself while driving. 

I very much want to go home and sleep. 5 1/2 hours to go."

"event","It's funny how people perform for themselves. I do this all the time, particularly when I'm in the car, singing to entertain myself. I am often very pleased with this activity, but don't feel comfortable performing for others, even people I like a lot. It's not a show written for an audience - only for me. 
I'm babysitting, and Cassidy is doing that right now. Kids do it a lot, and are less secretive of it. She's reading aloud, and is putting on a British accent for some of the characters. It's funny. I like reading aloud to myself, making voices and such, but I don't do them for other people because I'm not confident in them. I don't know what sounds will come out until they do, and I don't want anyone else to hear the mess-ups. Same with playing an instrument, etc. When I play it, I only really hear the correct notes; I filter through the mistakes to hear the song. But outside audiences can't do this, with a guitar or a crappy vocal performance. They hear it all.

In my Acting class, second semester of freshman year, two people did the scene from Angels in America where (I forget names) the girl is hallucinating and the guy with AIDS  (Lewis?) is in her hallucination, somehow. The scene opens with the guy sitting at a mirror putting on makeup, and he is performing for himself with philosophical poetry about his life and condition. ""Even drag is a drag."" The actor in my class had a tough challenge with this scene, because he had to figure out how to perform someone who is performing for themselves. In high school, Mrs. C talked about this as <em>private moments.</em> I haven't actually ever had to perform them, but I think it would be really interesting. Probably very hard, but I'm not sure. You just have to put your Permissions down on that file. (Security: Everyone) We are used to doing this with close friends and such; you feel that you are allowed to do gross or embarrassing things in front of certain people and not others. 
Speaking of which, this is how I see my introversion. I feel that I'm not Allowed to talk to people I don't know, for example, in class, so I don't. Once someone has begun talking to me, though, I feel that I have permission to talk to them, so I will without a problem. If I learned to assume there were no boundaries with who I could talk to, I would probably come off as being annoying to people. At least that's how I feel; I don't want to bother people who don't want to be talked to/at. So instead I'm shy and appear snobby, or perhaps dumb, I don't know. 

In any case, the Becki Show is most commonly performed by myself, for myself. The rare occasions on which is goes on tour should be cherished. ;-)"

"event","Paul and I had a wonderful weekend together, filled with adventure and amusement. First we went to see <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i>, which I liked very much and have certain theories about. However, I have already discussed it at some length with several people, so I don't feel to the need to write up my thoughts on it now. In short, though, I liked it very much, apart from the oompa-loompas. They were pretty awful. I thought the interpretation was successful, and the backstory that they added made sense with the way they portrayed Wonka. Johnny Depp was not creepy to me, as many people thought, but instead just awkward and unsure of himself, therefore coming off oddly to others. I can relate.

The next day, we took a trip up to <a href=""www.funspotnh.com"">Funspot</a>, way up in New Hampshire near Winnepesaukee. Funspot is a really cool arcade place that we had heard of a few months ago, and had been talking about going to. They have a ton of classic arcade games, like Frogger, Space Invaders, Duck Hunt, Pong, Pac-man, Mario Brothers, Donkey Kong, etc. It took us a long time to get there, and we left quite late (we are slow) so we only actually got to be there for two hours. It was not nearly enough time. I played a bunch of these games - each is only a quarter - but left wanting to try plenty more, and also to go bowling there and to play mini golf at the nearby Pirate's Cove, which Paul said was his favorite mini golf place ever. We will definitely have to travel back there, and arranging a weekend to stay there would be even more fun. We considered staying over in a hotel nearby, but the ones we passed were full, so we took the long trek home. 
I loved the old arcade games. They're so much more fun than any current arcade games I've played, other than pinball and Percussion Master. (They had 30+ pinball games; it was great.) I really hope to go back soon and play a bunch more that I didn't have time for. Great place. It had old pictures and signs everywhere. Their mascot seems to be the Gingerbread Man. 

On Sunday, we went to the Dollar Tree and amused ourselves purchasing odd items to send to people. Paul was buying strange toys for a Box of Things he is awarding to the winner of the Guess Surlaw's Favorites contest. Among them were a badly-assembled fireman action figure, a Tom Sawyer cartoon DVD, and the KFC Play Set (plastic chicken in a tub). I hope the recipient thoroughly enjoys it.

Thus was our grand weekend. Now I return to my last week of College Gate, to be followed by a month of babysitting for the girls."

Usually my dreams are very plausible events that I've been worried about happening - I'm testing them out in my mind to see how I would react. Coincidentally, I was just talking to Colin and Ryan about this the other day, and then that night my mind decided to prove me wrong. 

I woke up around 4am last night dreaming about some sort of cult place. This is what I recall:
I had been convinced to go there by a female friend, not sure who. We thought it was a sort of youth retreat. We arrived and were placed with roommates in a room that already contained a lot of personal things, like a normal house. We put our stuff there, and spoke to the two other girls in there. I felt somehow that the place was creepy, and I didn't really feel safe there. Something was off. At some point I was supposed to go to a dinner-type event and refused to go, and instead hung out in the kitchen. Two adults, a male and a female, chatted with me there and tried to enthuse me about the program. I learned that there was a video screening later than night, and figured out that it brainwashed you with subliminal messages. The adults gave up on me because I had figured out their scheme, and said ""Ok, leave"" or something. I went back to my room to get my stuff, and wanted to tell my friend to leave as well, but she was having a great time and I knew it would just upset her if I tried to explain. 
I got my stuff and went outside on the front porch. I studied the house. There was a wood porch. There were plants in the windows and in front of the house. The exterior was white, with black trim/roofs/gables, and the upper part was a bit yellowish. I called Paul, and he said he was there too, but I didn't believe him. I started looking at the house and asking him questions about it - I either didn't believe it was him on the phone or that he wasn't really there and it was part of the plot to make me stay. I could feel the cold wind as I sat on the front steps trying to figure out what to do. I thought it was probably a dream. I tried to wake up from it - something I remember doing when I was little, and have done a few times since - by cracking into my consciousness and making my body jolt or something. I wasn't getting through, though, and I wasn't positive it was indeed a dream. That's all I remember, so I must have woken up around then. 

Very unusual for me to remember so much of a dream. Paul was recently telling me that you usually remember dreams that you are woken up from, because your brain hasn't finished dumping the temporary files, if you will. That is seldom the case for me. The rare occasions that I remember dreams are usually when I've been sleeping late, not being woken up by an alarm or anyone, and I've been lazily half-sleeping and waking up and going back to sleep. He said that because I don't remember the ones I am woken up from, it probably suggests that my brain runs efficiently. That's probably good, or at least non-bad. But perhaps my processor is getting sloppier, since I remembered this as well as another odd dream the other day. But that's fine. Makes for interesting stories."

"event","I have not felt like writing much, but a few things should be announced:

-My brother has accepted a job at a video game company in Quincy. He has been looking for a long time, and LOVES this place. They seem to adore him. When he called to accept, she said ""There'll be a cheer when I tell the team."" What could be better? I'm very happy for him.

-My mom has been in Poland and Lithuania for the past week and a half, and is returning tonight. Tomorrow there will be much rejoicing.

-I have a new gerbil, as of the past two weeks. Her name is The Small. She is about 1/3 the size of Sonic. 
<a href=""http://img258.imageshack.us/my.php?image=10009742aa.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img258.imageshack.us/img258/8329/10009742aa.th.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"" /></a>
(Click for larger)
Last weekend, The Small got sick suddenly. She was having diarrhea (Wet Tail), and the internet told us that most gerbils won't make it 24 hours. We were very worried, but got her some medicine from the pet store. It was a struggle to get her to consume it because gerbils don't drink much water. We ended up soaking some of her food in it. Miraculously, she recovered in a few days. I still can't believe it. 

-College Gate is going well. I'm at the end of the second week, so just one more to go. I finally feel pretty good about it all. I feel like I've learned some of the tricks to teaching, and I've got things under control. This is my fourth year, and the first that I've felt this way. I've learned and improved, and it's very good to see that working. 
I have a new friend there named Andrew. He's a high school nerd, and he is fun. 
For the last day, I thought of a brilliant idea for when the parents come in for open house. I will set up my kids' work like an art show, with name cards and all. The kids themselves can create human sculptures, and be part of the exhibit! It will be fun. The kids liked the idea of the show, but I didn't tell them the human sculpture part yet. 

Generally, things are well. I had a great time at the Cape last weekend, but it was too short. I hoped to go this weekend and bring Paul along, but it turns out that Jen has plans Saturday night. I very much hope we can go again this summer, though. 
Love to all."

"event","I have recently been introduced to the world of Denny's, an all-night restaurant that turns out to be less crappy than I imagined. One of our recent trips there awarded us a squishy, polka-dotted walrus from the claw machine, and he has found his way into our hearts.
On our trip there this evening, we spotted another spotted walrus for the fishing. We made several attempts to retrieve him, but first won a fairly large, furry koala. He sat in a place of honour as we ate our meal, and during this we were amused by a group of two girls and one lady who each took several turns at the claw machine. They won several items, but among them were neither another koala nor the coveted second walrus. However, they did render the walrus more accessible. When our meal was finished, Paul got two dollars back in quarters, and we went to make more attempts at rescuing our walrusy friend. He was close, but unsuccessful, for three dollars' worth of tries. At the neighboring table was seated the girls who had been winning prizes from the machine. The lady admired our koala, and said she had tried to get the other one. I said, ""Yeah, it's rather large.""
She said, ""I'll give you twenty dollars for it."" I looked at Paul, laughing. 
""Ok,"" he said in disbelief as the lady reached for her purse. 
""I mean it; I collect koalas,"" she said. As she handed me the money, one of the girls with her said, ""She is so nice and kind!"" I handed her the bear.
""Thanks! Enjoy!"" I said, and we left, not sure whether we had really just received a free meal for the price of a stuffed bear. ""I wonder if the bill is real,"" Paul remarked. 

Although we did not yet succeed in building our army of spotted walruses, the battle will continue. And some free meals on the way won't hurt."

"event","""Yes, I'm fine."" 
""No, it doesn't hurt anywhere.""
""I was driving too fast around the curve... No, I drive this way every day...""
""I don't know.""
""Can you tell the girls that their dad will come to get them? Can you try to get ahold of him?""
""Mom... I broke the car.""

This was two Tuesdays ago. I've been slow in writing it up because my computer was broken, and just returned from Apple yesterday. 
It was the girls' last day of school, and they were getting out an hour early. I was headed down Route 2 East from Fitchburg to pick them up, as usual, but I was running a bit late because of their early dismissal and my sluggishness. Therefore, I was driving the car a bit fast, not wanting to keep them waiting for me at their school. 

I was almost there, and it was 12:45. I could probably make it, I thought. I was driving in the left lane, under an overpass, and didn't realize that the road was curving quickly to the left and I was going too fast. I tried to slow down, but my car wasn't staying in the lane. I was out of control. I slammed on the brakes, trying not to hit anyone, and I heard a terrible squeal, some thumps and a cloud of dirt. I was stopped. I turned off the engine, took a breath and got out of the car. I had crashed bigtime. 

My car had spun out, spinning across three lanes and smashing into the right guardrail. It was intermingled with the guardrail in its front left corner, and was smashed in on the left side backseat door. Since they were on the same side, I must have hit the side on the guardrail, spun around and hit it again in the front. 

<img src=""http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y231/dianemdavis/altimaultima.jpg"">

As soon as I got out of the car and looked at it, two women pulled up to me and started talking to me. ""I know you're in shock,"" they said. ""Are you hurt anywhere?"" ""What happened?"" 
""I really don't know,"" I said. ""Maybe something in the car broke? I tried to stop and couldn't...""
""When the police come, they'll take care of you. Can you call someone?""

The first person I called was Bill. Someone had to pick up the kids; they were getting out of school in a few minutes. He didn't answer. I called 411 and got the number to their elementary school, and spoke to the secretary. ""I just crashed my car on my way to get them... can you try to reach their parents? You probably have a number I don't have... can one of their friends' parents bring them home?""
Next I called my dad. ""I crashed the car."" I don't remember the brief conversation, but I saw the police coming over to talk to me, so I hung up. The two nice women told me they were leaving, now that the police had come, and I thanked them. The cop asked for my license and registration. He took them back to his car, while an ambulance and a fireman (in a van, not a fire truck) pulled up and asked if I was ok. ""You're in the good hands of the police now,"" the fireman said, kindly. 
While I was trying to call people, someone asked me for the keys to the car. I handed them my keychain dazedly, and then realized as I was trying to call people that my car was being pulled up onto a tow truck. I hadn't had time to take anything out of it. I was left holding my license, my registration, and my phone. I wished I had taken my cheezits.

The tow guy handed me a business card, saying ""This is where the car'll be."" The cop said something to him, and he responded ""Yeah, this is totaled."" He and my car left.
The cop came back and gave me a ticket for $200. He explained that he wrote down ""failure to stay in marked lanes"" and that I was going 55 in a 45 (I was going about 70, not realizing.) He said it could have been much worse, so he was giving me a break. He told me to come into his car and he'd bring me to the Acton Police Station. I called my dad and told him this, and he said he would leave work to come and get me. I had tried calling my house first to see if Colin was around, but there was no response. When I was in the police car, my mom called me back (after I had tried to reach her earlier) and I told her the news and started crying. I didn't want to cry, sitting there next to the cop, but I felt awful. My mom was just glad I was ok, and was very sweet to me and I told her dad was coming to get me. She was out having lunch with her mother and an old friend, so she had to get back to them, but talked to me for a few minutes and told me to call back if I needed to. 
I was dropped off at the police station, and he told me to go into the lobby and get a few accident report forms, because I'd need to send them to the insurance place, etc. I went in and sat down in the small lobby, and texted a few people, Paul and Steve included. I was still half-crying, and when Paul called me I went out onto the sidewalk to talk to him, balled up against the wall of the building. He was really worried about me. I also called Bill back, and he said he got my message on the answering machine and he was on his way to get the girls, and told me to not worry about it and to do whatever I needed to do. 
After this, it started to rain, so I went back into the lobby and waited. I read over the accident report forms, but didn't have a pen, and I didn't want to ask for one. Soon, my dad came in, found me and took me home. He didn't go back to work, but stayed home and told me to call the insurance company and talk to them. I made lots of calls, talking to the people and answering their many questions, and tried to be as responsible as I could. 

Later that night, Paul came to Chelmsford and we went looking for the car at the garage it was towed to in Acton. It was off in an obscure corner, and we found it only after a worker asked what we were doing there. He recognized me from earlier, and remembered exactly where my car was. We went to it and cleaned it out, putting all the stuff into Paul's trunk. I had been worried that things might have been stolen, like my ipod, but everything was there, albeit dusty. My bumper, which had completely fallen off, had been tossed into the window. The keys were in the ignition, luckily - my apartment key was among them. We collected all the items, I took a few pictures, and we left.

That's the main story. The next day, my mother and I went back to the car to deal with insurance/appraisal issues, but that's less interesting. The aftermath of this is not certain, however. My mom's in Europe right now, so I'm borrowing Colin's car and he's using hers. When she gets back, things will be more complicated. I had been planning to save up for a new car that I would eventually need, but my savings thus far have only amounted to $50.01. My College Gate earnings will total something like $800, but that is still not much, and I'm not sure what's going to happen. However, my mom said I wouldn't be able to take a summer course anymore, which I had been thinking about doing. 

How do I feel about all this? The night it happened, when I was hanging out with Paul in my basement, I started bawling. I felt incredibly guilty about the fact that I could have died, leaving him and everyone else that loves me. Once that hit me, I was really upset for a while, just thinking about what could have happened; feeling bad not for myself, but for who I could have hurt. I felt so guilty for this. When my mom got home from her day out, she said it was awful being away and not being able to hug me all day. I felt distant, though, because I didn't want to cry about it any more. 
My parents took the whole thing amazingly well. They both totaled cars when they were young, and said little about it other than ""I'm glad you're not hurt."" I appreciate this a lot. I felt that I handled it relatively well, also - the first person I called was Bill, after all, and I tried to take care of the insurance stuff right away. I think I did ok. 

I had a dream last night, in which I was turning around and crashed the rear of my brother's car into a telephone pole. I woke up, upset by this and dreading having to tell the others that I messed up yet AGAIN. I've been trying to be more careful. 

Feel free to ask questions, as always."

"event","""So, since I've been a lot better since I've been taking meds...""
""<em>Have</em> you been a lot better?""
""Yeah! You couldn't tell?""

If Paul couldn't tell that I've been a lot better, I suppose no one else can, either. So here's the news: I really do feel like it's helping a lot and things are a lot better. Here's why:

1. I can read now. I haven't been able to read on my own for more than a few minutes for a long time. I've had huge amounts of trouble this past year, especially, but freshman year also. I would sit down and try to read, and give up after five minutes, not being able to focus - even when it's a book I'm trying to read for fun. Recently, I've almost completed a book that I've been reading while babysitting. Completing a book for fun is something I haven't been able to do in a really long time. So this is an excellent sign.

2. I'm less afraid of people. I'm not hiding out in my apartment trying to disappear. I actually want to go out, to see people. I'm excited about seeing my friends, and I was even looking forward to the family event I attended today. I had been so nervous, so anxious, that at times I would actually be afraid of seeing my own friends and would rather stay home alone, where it's safe. I feel awful about that, now; but things are looking much better.

3. I'm feeling more stable. I'm not happy all the time, and when life is difficult it is still difficult, but I don't feel like I'm crashing and burning. I feel like I can handle things, I can handle the difficulties of life and things will be ok. When I'm upset, I need some time to resolve it logically in my head, but once I do that, I will be fine. I can even express myself better when talking to people; I'm less afraid of speaking. I feel like I can talk out problems more easily, and I can talk to people in social situations more easily as well. The road block that I had set up for myself has become more transparent, so I can deal with life normally, and not from behind the wall. 

This is a good thing. It really has helped a lot this past month, and although I felt guilty about not being able to solve my problems by myself, I think it is the right thing. I AM solving my problems; I had to do so by getting outside help."

"event","I began this post just over a week ago, and have been steadily adding to it every day since. I am slow and lazy, but this is a story worth telling. 
<hr>

The experience I had last night going to see the Dresden Dolls was something far more interesting than just seeing a band. 
It was on par with going to a Renaissance Faire - wandering entertainment, people everywhere in fancy and elaborate costumes, and a unique mystical feeling that you were in some kind of gothic Wonderland. 
Let me start at the beginning. We got to Comm. Ave, and quickly saw the long and thick line that was stretching down the street. We wandered down, and one of the first things I noticed was people drawing with chalk on the street. Dragons, fairies, people, words. I approved. Following the line down, I started to notice all the costumes. Painted faces, painted bodies. A lot of white faces with decoration, and random body designs as if it were tattooed. I loved this. There were a lot of gothy dresses, Victorian dresses, and punk/indie/hippy stuff. This was a cool place, much more interesting than I'd expected. This was a different world. 
<lj-cut>
We stood in line, and I was pleasantly surprised that we would be entertained during our wait. A girl with paint and wings walked by, and slowly gestured to me in a type of bow/curtsy, smiling. We saw a girl dressed in a top hat and long coat, who was trying to be a statue - ""living art"" or whatever it is known as. There turned out to be a surprising amount of this at the show. (This draws from Amanda's work as a street performer. There is a line in 'Perfect Fit' alluding to it.) The girl was standing on a chair with one arm out as if she was holding something. She occasionally shifted positions. At one point a guy picked her up and carried her down the street, and she remained in the position while she was being carried. 
A girl wearing indie-looking clothing came up to us. Her face reminded me of Alanis Morrisette in Dogma. She looked extraordinarily calm. She was carrying a diary, and said to us ""A penny for your thoughts?"" And held out the book. We each wrote a few lines in the book, and she rewarded us each with a penny. I wrote, ""People should paint their faces more.""
A man came up to the people next to us, and said ""Pick a color."" They said ""orange"", and he pulled out a small piece of orange paper and began folding it. He produced an origami bird which flapped its wings when you pulled its beak back and forth. He saw us noticing, and said ""I have extras, if you like."" He gave us each one of different colors. Mine was brown.
There was a guy walking on huge stilts, wearing long, long clown pants over them. I saw the stilts removed later - the had curved supports for the shins with thick foam, and platforms underneath with boots nailed on. It was impressive! If I remember correctly, at one point the stilts guy was ""controlling"" a person dressed like a marionette, who in turn was controlling an actual, very large, marionette. They formed a little parade. Also, there was a guy who painted his face to look like a puppet, with the lines on his chin as if it were wooden. He was walking around, very stiff-legged, and he winked at me. 
An almost-naked girl came by. She was wearing nothing but little red, lacy panties and red paint. There was paint all over her body, and she was coming up to people and letting them paint on her. The people behind us did it, and accidentally dripped some paint on themselves. The girl was covered mostly in bright red words, but I don't recall what they said.
At some point, a guy was fire-breathing and such, but I couldn't see it because it was far away at the front of the line. Mike could, though, because he is tall. Later, the same fairy that had bowed to me earlier came and said ""I am a glitter fairy. Would you like glitter?"" We said yes, and she threw glitter on our heads. It was silver, and Paul was confused when he found sparkles on my head later.

It eventually became evident that the show was starting rather late. We had arrived around 7, and the show was supposed to start at 7:30. It progressed to 8:00, perhaps 8:30 when we heard word that there had been a power failure on the street. Not their fault, but extremely inconvenient. We became bored and tired of standing, and ended up sitting on the sidewalk for awhile. Finally, at about 10:00, we were able to go inside and the interesting sights and events resumed. 

We walked into the building, and I noted that our reservations weren't checked. I later realized that it was ok to have cameras. This was annoying, because I wanted both Paul to come, and to bring my camera, but didn't. 
We walked down a hallway, and Mike recognized the venue from another show he had gone to. We saw a girl covered completely in silver paint, who was wearing a silver Victorian dress and carrying a matching parasol. She was posing as a statue, and was impressive. Across from her was a girl standing on a platform, looking serene and holding a small basket with cards on it. For each person that passed, the girl looked at them curiously, selected a card from her basket, and slowly handed it to them. The cards had lovely fortunes on them. I think I lost mine, but it had something about my dancing spirit. 
We found our spot in the crowd, and Mike got a drink from the bar. A girl came by with a tray of little shapes, and we weren't sure what they were. ""They're pins"", she explained, ""and they're free."" I took a blue star, and Mike took a heart, I think. Free souvenirs are always nice. 
Next to the stage and near where we had parked ourselves, an entire scene had been set up. There was a jar of pennies knocked onto the floor, with a girl frozen in a pose (that occasionally shifted) standing on them. There was a girl sleeping in a chair. There was a girl with black hair next to a mirror on a bureau with ""THIS PASSION IS A PLAGIARISM"" (I later found out, a line from a song) written on it with lipstick. There was another girl perched on the retro bench/couch. All were artistically dressed. 
Next to this living still life there was a fairylike girl sitting at an old-fashioned typewriter. She was typing on brown paper, and we saw her stand up on the bench and read a limerick she had written. She noticed Mike and asked his name, and then wrote him a limerick write there and recited it with grandeur. I don't remember the poem, but perhaps Mike will humour me and post it in a comment. The limerick itself was cute, but the idea was marvelous.

Finally the show appeared to start. An ornate table was on the stage, and we soon found out why. They were doing a ""radio interview"", where people came on stage and pretended to be calling in with questions. This was a little annoying, since we had been waiting to see a concert for hours and now we had to sit through an interview. It was interesting, though, and since I knew nothing about the band previously, it was neat to hear what they had to say. They explained that they didn't want to say they were punk, or goth, or anything else - they didn't fit into any genre, so they made up the label Punk Cabaret. ""Punk"", they said, not so much in the pierce-everything-moshing-spikes etc. way, but just the ""Do whatever you want, no one can stop you"" sentiment. ""Cabaret"" is what it sounds like; I wish I could explain it better. 
The band, I should mention, consists only of the female singer/pianist, and the male drummer. They were dressed relatively conservatively at this point - the girl was in a summery dress. One person asked who their musical influences are, and the pianist, Amanda, said it was mainly her mother, who introduced her to the instrument. I don't remember much of what the guy said. The band has been around for about five years, but only recently got signed. They're from Boston, which explains the incredibly enthusiastic support from the crowd. They explained that almost all of their publicity comes from word of mouth and their website, and that people got together on their message boards and planned all the things they were doing for the shows. Impressive - we had been wondering in line if the performers were hired, planned or completely individual. 

Eventually the interview ended, and there was a long period of people running around on the stage. There was one particular, clownish girl that kept appearing and moving things onstage; she seemed to be entertaining to folks less impatient than myself, but I was really tired at this point and just wanted to leave. We decided that we'd leave at 11:30 no matter what, because we didn't want to risk missing the T. We waited on. 

A group of young people dressed in black with white, torn strips of fabric pinned to them came onstage. They were introduced as the Lexington High School theatre students, and they performed a sort of interpretive dance to one of the Dresden Dolls' songs, recorded. It seemed completely random to me; I normally would have been more appreciative, but it was just getting later and I was really tired of standing. However, the fact that they were there was interesting, and I wonder if they were intended to be on the DVD or not. 
After some more stage shuffling, a singular girl heavily dusted in white powder came onstage. She was wearing an antique-looking white dress, and her face and arms and hair were completely covered in white powder that you could see wafting off in the lights. She performed another sort of interpretive dance (for lack of a better phrase) that involved repeated gestures that became increasingly more emphasized and frantic, and gestures describing the lyrics, which may of been signing. Diana asked if it was and I said no at the time, but I take that back - at least some of it probably was. It was to the Dresden Dolls' song, ""<a href=""http://dresdendolls.com/downloads_n_lyrics/lyrics/halfjack.htm"">Half Jack</a>"", which is the only song of theirs that I've listened carefully to, and still don't understand. I have a few guesses, but I can't pin it. Anyway, her performance was pretty cool, and the image still comes to mind whenever I hear the song. 

More shuffling of the stage occurred, and finally, FINALLY the band came on. A noticeable amount of people had left, and I didn't blame them. I'm glad the show was free, or I would have been more disappointed. 
We got to hear them perform one song, which I think was ""Good Day"", a song I now like a lot. They had changed clothing, and were a lot more dramatic. Amanda was wearing black and white striped stockings and more black, I think, and Brian, the drummer, had painted his face white and was wearing a very cool hat. They were wonderful to watch. Amanda's playing and singing was more passionate than a great night in bed, and Brian looked like he was having the time of his life. It was an incredible performance, even though we only saw one song. Seeing their show could not possibly disappoint. 

We finally left when they transitioned into a second song, and it had passed our 11:30 limit. My overall impression: Excellent, excellent. I would jump at the chance to see them again, and I can only hope that the crowd would be as creative and exciting. Although I was tired as hell when we left, I'm very, very glad I went. (Thanks to Mike, Di and Kim for the opportunity!) This was a completely unique experience that I'd love to repeat, but I'm sure it can't be done. In any case, it was the best introduction to a band that I could imagine.

I'm going to see the Dresden Dolls tonight for free. It's the DVD shooting, and Diana's sister won free tickets to it. Should be really interesting. Coincidentally, I hadn't listened to them before this week, and Mike just happened to mention the other day that they had an extra spot! They're really interesting. A lot of piano, kind of hard, dark.  Female singer who is both sexy and frightening-sounding. Sometimes screamy, sometimes innocent. My dad explained about Dresden - a city in Germany that was completely wiped out by the Allies during WWII. He said a Dresden doll would probably be an image of a charred doll, amidst rubble. This makes sense, from what I've heard of the music and lyrics. The songs I've really heard the lyrics to are about an emotionally needy, psychologically messed-up girl. ""Bad habit"" is about cutting, and ""Girl Anachronism"" is about general mental unhealithiness, and it being too late to help her or to understand. ""Coin Operated Boy"" is about yearning for a boy who she can cuddle with and who will say nice things to her but won't bring any complications, and is only in use when she wants.
These three are all very poetic, with very little repetition in the lyrics. It's really cool, and I'm excited to see them tonight. I think it will be neat to see how they shoot the DVD, too. ""This section, scream now!"" etc."

"event","Paul and I now have ""our song."" It is from the Katamari Damacy soundtrack - <i>Que Sera Sera</i>. (What will be will be.)
It had been Paul's favorite song on there for awhile, and I didn't appreciate it so much at first, but it grew on me. Yesterday I was driving around to various places all day, and I played this song and really listened to the lyrics. It's so simple - ""I'm so in love with you, I want to wad you up into my life."" Simple, but perfect. It's lounge-y, Sinatra-like. I listened to it yesterday and it just came to me: this is our song.

<lj-cut text=""The lyrics"">
Katamari Damacy: Que Sera Sera
<i>
I know you love me
I wanna wad you up into my life
Let's roll up to be a single star in the sky

I hear you calling me
I wanna wad you up into my life
Let's lump up to make a single star in the sky
To you, to you

I'm so in love with you
I wanna wad you up into my life
Let's roll up to be a single star in the sky

I need you to feel me
I wanna wad you up into my life
Let's lump up to make a single star in the sky
To you

I know you love me
I wanna wad you up into my life
Let's roll up to be a single star in the sky

I hear you calling me
I wanna wad you up into my life
Let's lump up to make a single star in the sky
To you, oh to you

Yes to you</i>
</lj-cut>

Katamari is a great game for a lot of reasons. For those who don't know, it's a game where you are a little guy with a ball. You roll the ball around the world, and it picks up items. You start with tiny items like matches and mice and spoons, and your wad grows and grows, until you're rolling up trees and giant octopi and buildings and islands. It sounds strange, but it's oddly peaceful. (This should explain the song somewhat.) The soundtrack is great, and you just roll around forever - I've played it for nearly an hour straight, by myself, without getting bored. There aren't any goals involved other than rolling up items in a certain amount of time, which is optional. It's not about competition. 
I love Katamari because you can wad up some philosophy into the mix. I see it as a metaphysical idea: The world is made up of items. <i>Stuff</i>. Everything is everything is everything. In Katamari, the giant ball you roll up becomes a star, and you can view the constellations you create. It reminds me of a moment in <i>I <3 Huckabees</i>, where a man is explaining to the main character the existentialist view that that the world is meaningless. Items in the world are just items, and you have to find your own reasons for living because the world does not assign them to you. In the movie, the man is holding a white sheet, to represent the universe, and putting his hand under it to represent some specific part of the universe. Then he moves the sheet and his hand pops up somewhere else under it. To paraphrase:
'This is a kiss. And this is a duck. And this is a continent. And this is an orgasm. And this is you and I, here in this room.'
The blanket truth - the world is made up of the world. 
This is what I see in Katamari Damacy. 

As for having an ""our song"", this is a new thing for me. I've tried, I've wanted to have one with every person I've gone out with, but it's never been mutual. There are certain songs that will always remind me of certain people, that I individually claimed as ""our song"", but meant nothing to them. I even remember discussing Beatles songs with Spencer, picking out a few that I thought were nice love songs, and he said ""they're all too mushy. How about Sgt. Pepper?"" 
So, this is special to me. A palpable, agreed-upon expression of love. A song that represents the same thing to both of us, the same ideas and images and feelings. This is very special. 


Good item to roll up in Katamari #34256: Elephants."

"event","In my last post, a week ago, my ""hint"" was that the next update would be about my gerbils. I thought this would be a happy post. But, unfortunately, it is not. 

Let me start at the beginning. On the weekend of May 14th, I was at Heidi's house for her graduation from Simon's Rock. It was a fun weekend. I noticed that she had some adorable little gerbils, and I mentioned to her that I was planning on getting hamsters for my new apartment. She decided, since she was moving to California this fall, to give the gerbils to me. I played with them all weekend and fell in love with them. 

I brought them home, and Paul fell in love with them as well. I renamed them Sonic and Tails. Sonic seemed smarter and faster, although also more aggressive, so I gave him that name. Tails was cute, but couldn't figure out the hamster ball like Sonic could, and seemed less quick at trying to escape your grasp, etc. Although they were both female, I generally have been calling Sonic a ""he"" and Tails a ""she"", just because it seemed right to me. I've had them for a week and a half, and I've been taking really good care of them, giving them lots of love, attention and paper towels rolls to chew on.

This past weekend, Harmony and Cassidy came over. They're the daughters of a friend of the family; they're six and eight years old. I have been babysitting for them for the past week, and I will be all summer. I knew they'd like the gerbils, so I brought the cage out and let the girls play with them. I left the house, but my mom said later that they were painting pictures of the gerbils and such. They enjoyed them a lot, and asked me to bring them to their house. I said I would. 

This is where the story goes downhill. I brought them over yesterday to play with the girls. They had been looking forward to it, and were absolutely thrilled. We let them run around in Talya's office, roll in the ball, and eat paper towel rolls. I let the girls hold them, but they weren't very good with it, and it made me nervous. I told them they couldn't take them out without me. 
After we had already been playing with them a lot, and I wanted to give them a break, the cage was on the table in the living room. Cassidy had brought it in from the office (where it was safe from the two dogs and the cat) and the girls were poking at them. I told them not to let them out, but they insisted, so I said they could touch them inside the cage but not take them out. Malinky, one of the dogs, was looking at them, and it made me nervous so I said that if they HAD to touch them, to put the cage onto the kitchen table. They brought it in there, and I was about to come in with them. 
Within about ten seconds of their going in the next room with the gerbils, I heard scuffling and shouting, and ran in there and they had wrestled Tails out of the dog's mouth. There was blood on the floor. The girls were crying. I couldn't breathe. I put the dog in the office and told the girls to go to their room. Tails was dead.

I didn't know what to do. I wrapped Tails in tissues and called my dad and told him. I didn't have their mom's number because I lost it, and my dad didn't know it. I thought about emailing her, but it was 5:15 by then and she usually gets home at 5:30. It was a very, very long 45 minutes until she got home. The girls were crying and crying. Cassidy, especially, felt horrible. She said she wanted to die, and I tried to comfort them. They drew pictures of Sonic and Tails and wrote me notes, saying how sorry they were and that they would buy me a new one. They tried so hard, and they were so upset. When Tayla got home I told her, and she suggested I take a few days off to recuperate. Bill, their dad, called me later and said he'd talked with the girls. He wanted to see how I was doing. 

I buried him outside next to the bunny, by the big rock. I want to paint both their names on the rock, sometime when it's not raining (if that will ever happen again.)
I'm so sorry. I felt so bad for myself, for Sonic because he'll be lonely, and for Heidi, because she gave them to me. I felt so bad for Paul, because he loved them very, very much. I was so afraid to tell him, because I knew it would break his heart. I hope Sonic is ok. I'm really worried about him, and we've been playing with him a lot. We are thinking about getting him a new friend, but I don't know if he would like that. 

I cried for hours yesterday, though. I cried with the girls, although I had to be strong for them. Then I had to be strong for Paul. Then, eventually, he had to be strong for me and hold me. I kept going over it in my head - every little thing that happened, every point at which I should have done something differently. I should have stuck by my decision to leave the gerbils alone. I shouldn't have let them open the cage. I shouldn't have let them take them in the other room. I shouldn't have brought them over in the first place. But I did, and what happened happened. There's no way to change it, no matter clearly I can fix it in my head. I couldn't get the images out of my head last night. We didn't go to sleep until 6am. Today, things look better, but I still feel a rock in my stomach. 

I'm so, so sorry, Tails. I'm so sorry, Paul. Heidi. Sonic. Harmony and Cassidy. I'm so sorry this happened. I loved him.

"event","Well, I have a lot of news, but I don't want to tell it all at once because people are less likely to respond (or read, but that's hard to determine.)

So, here's one bit of news: I'm going on antidepressants.

As most of you know, I've been seeing a therapist, a social worker. I've seen him a few times, maybe 5 now, and he thought it would be a good idea to see a psychiatrist to consider medication. I've been talking with him mostly about school things, procrastination issues, and why I can get A's on my papers but have a hard time showing up to class. I went to the psychiatrist, talked to her for 45 minutes, went over the notes from the counseling guy and she asked her own questions, and she decided that an antidepressant would be good. She said I'll still have to learn to deal with the procrastination stuff, but it should help me with the getting-out-of-bed stuff. 

If you remember, I did mention a month or so ago that I thought I was depressed, because of the classic symptoms like loss of appetite, libido, etc. Some of that stuff, I realized recently, was related to the birth control pills I was taking. I realized this clearly because when I skipped a week of taking it, and I suddenly felt a lot happier. So, I went to another doctor to talk about the pill, and to get on a different one. I was taking Ortho Tri-Cylcen Lo, which gives you a different amounts of hormones depending on the week, so the doctor decided to put me on a different one that is the same all the time. If that doesn't make things better, there are lots of other options still. The birth control was making me depressed, and understandably so. It is giving me more ESTROGEN! Of course it's going to make me more emotional and less sex-driven.  Females. *rolls eyes* Just kidding. So, it kind of sucks, but it's important for me to be on it. 

So, back on the antidepressant bit - I've never liked the idea of 'brain drugs'. I like to think I can solve things for myself, and I don't like the idea of not being in control. Things screwing with my mind. But when I decided to go to therapy, I accepted the fact that I can't solve this myself. It's just been getting worse, and I can't fix it. And if I needed medication, I would try it. The thing is, no one can MAKE me take it. They can strongly suggest it, but my parents are on my side, and I can stop going to doctors if I want to. So I do have the ultimate control, and I'm trying something that is supposed to help me. 
I took the first pill today. They are bright blue; it's called Wellbutrin. She said it probably won't help much with the depression for a month, but I might get side effects before then. Luckily, I'm not usually affected by side affects of things, but I've never taken anything like this before either. 

So, we'll see how it goes. My parents haven't said much on the issue; just ""Ok, we'll see then."" Paul is trying to be supportive, but he's unsettled on the idea. But we will see.

"event","I am going to look at an apartment in Fitchburg tomorrow, a one-bedroom. It sounds perfect - down the street from Paul's house, a mile away from the school, and it's in a <a href=""http://www.imageshack.us""><a href=""http://img132.echo.cx/img132/7875/housepictures6yl.jpg"" border=""0"" width=""1152"" alt=""Image Hosted by ImageShack.us"" />gorgeous Victorian house</a>. He has other people looking at it, so I'm nervous, but hope I like it and get it. 

I have also decided I want to get a hamster. Or two, who knows. I am very excited about this idea. Good names in mind are Sonic and Zoidberg. I've been looking at pictures and reading about hamu things all night. Squee.

My mom helped me get my room out of the abominable mess it had been stuck in. I was overwhelmed by all the crap from moving out of the dorm, and didn't know where to start, so that helped a lot.

My 'S' key has broken off, and that is annoying. I have to get it fixed at some point. 

My car, the '91 Toyota Camry that I've loved for two years, is being retired. Our reliable car mechanic Gary said that it wouldn't pass inspection without a crapload of body work, and it's not worth it. I cried when my mom told me this for certain. It was my first car, the first car that was my very own, and I have it decorated with Mario and Pacman toys and various stickers. I like driving it more than any other car I've driven, which admittedly is not many, but it's MY CAR. So I'm sad. My mom is buying a new car right now, so I can driver hers (the Nissan, which she wanted to get rid of anyway) around until I can buy a new one for myself. 

I spent the weekend with Paul, doing random nerdings, and that was fun. We recently had our six-month anniversary, also. Last night, I stayed over with Steve at his brother's house that he's house-and-dog-sitting, and we played air hockey and darts. It was also fun. I have a Mother's Day story that I will perhaps tell later.

I have now been home for a full week, and I need to get off my ass and start doing things. I made a few phone calls today, but that's not enough. I have to find a job, get things settled with Fitchburg, close things off with Emerson, and go to the gym. Onward!"

I'm glad I'm into Fitchburg now, so I can really start planning. Today I worked on getting my car back on the road and looking for a job. Minimal efforts, anyway. I didn't wake up until 3, and I need to get into a new pattern of getting up and doing things. This can't be like last summer.

I'm looking for apartments in Fitchburg. I filled out an application today for <a href=""http://www.plasterfuntime.com/"">Plaster Fun Time</a>, and I'm also going to look at their other locations, and various locations of the <a href=""http://www.clayroom.com/"">Clayroom</a>. 

My puppy doesn't seem too happy right now. She was crying last night for no apparent reason, and she wanted to go out at 2am and then wouldn't come back when I called her. She wandered off and I was really worried. She also had a tick, which is nothing to worry about but I worry anyway. She just seems to be hurting. :-(

"event","Walking around the city with Steve was really nice. We sat by the pond in the garden that I've considered my own for the past two years, and quacked at ducks and relaxed, reflected on things. There are some things I really will miss about being here, and some things I'm eager to leave. But I'm glad I had the experience.

<hr>
Wackiness: 48/100
Rationality: 76/100
Constructiveness: 48/100
Leadership: 18/100


        You are a SRDF--Sober Rational Destructive Follower. This makes you a Fountain of Knowledge.

        <strong>You are cool, analytical, intelligent and completely unfunny. </strong><strong>Sometimes you slice through conversation with a cutting observation that causes silence and sidelong glances. You make a strong and lasting impression on everyone you meet, the quality of which depends more on their personality than yours.
</strong>        You may feel persecuted, as you can become a target for fun. Still, you are focused enough on your work and secure enough in your abilities not to worry overly.
        You are productive and invaluable to those you work for. You are loyal, steadfast, and conscientious. Your grooming is impeccable. You are in good shape.
       <strong> You are kind of a tool, but you get things done. You are probably a week away from snapping.</strong>
        Addendum, 2004/07/19: this fits me 99%, there is a slight inaccuracy however. <strong>We are not necessarily completely unfunny. If we have a sense of humor (I do) it surfaces on the occasion with well-timed, completely dry, very sarcastic, wit.</strong> - Chase

<em>""You make a strong and lasting impression on everyone you meet, the quality of which depends more on their personality than yours.""</em>
Interesting. For a long time, I kept thinking that I was incomplete, I was only made up of the personalities of the people I interact with, and I was mostly a mirror. My personality does change very significantly depending on the situation and who I'm with, which I used to see as a weakness. Many people do see it as a sign of a weak character. But I've realized recently that it's just a part of my character to be flexible, and I naturally complement others and either follow their lead, or even take the lead myself if the other person seems to expect it. This is, I suppose, neither a good nor a bad thing. It is just me. I've often wondered why people like me - I'm not the most entertaining person. But I do, I think, let people feel comfortable being exactly who they are, which is not something everyone does."

"event","I don't like to throw this word around, and I don't like when others do it, but I might really be depressed. 

I hate this, because it feels like something I should just say ""Ok, stop being stupid"" to and fix. But I can't. I almost don't want to. 
Everything is hard. I'm sometimes afraid of being alone. I'm also afraid of going out and seeing people. I want to hide, but I'm massively lonely too. 
I don't want to do anything. Going to take a shower is a big effort. Going to eat is a gigantic effort. I haven't really wanted to eat lately, which I know is bad. I'm wallowing, and I know it's bad, but I don't want to go out and do things either. Scared of everything. 
I feel like I'm hurting everyone too, which makes me feel worse and I don't know how to get out of it. 
I've had random pains all week. In my torso, just completely random pains that seem to float around. 
I'm sleeping too much. I feel tired all the time. I go to eat, come back and feel like I need a nap. Sleeping is avoidance, and I want to sleep because of it, but I also honestly feel tired. 
I can't make decisions. I need people to tell me what to do. Nap or eat. Shower or do laundry. I recall Emma saying the exact same thing awhile ago, and now I'm feeling like that. Arg. 
I'm crying nearly every time I talk on the phone to my mom or Paul. I feel like I'm on the edge constantly. 
I feel like I'm afraid of everyone, I'm afraid to talk to anyone because I won't say the right things, or I'll be boring and bring them down, or something. And I feel bad about that, because I know lots of people care about me and are nice to me and love me. I feel like I don't know how to talk to people. I don't know how to make anyone happy. I don't trust myself, I can't predict my actions because when the time comes to do something, I don't know if I'll be able to make myself do it. 

I'm whining. I hate whining, and so does everyone else. I apologize. I'm really sorry for feeling this way and causing problems for everyone who has to deal with me."

"event","I went to the therapist again this week. It's good to talk to someone like that, because you have a sense that they've dealt with a lot of people and problems before, yet don't seem to pass judgment on you or make you feel guilty. If I tell my mom I didn't go to class, I feel like a terrible person. When I tell this guy, he just nods. Makes me feel understood; he says ""So, social problems made it harder to do [work] that it was hard to do anyway."" ""
He also suggested that Paul and I go to the library and do work together. I need someone to hold my hand and say ""do work now"". My self-discipline is so low right now, and I don't know why, but it's a huge problem for me and a burden on everyone else right now. I need to get out of this somehow, but I also need to deal with the immediate concerns of passing the semester. 

Only a couple of weeks left, and I don't really know how I'm going to get through them. Mom says, one day at a time. Stop thinking ahead and getting overwhelmed, just decided what you're going to get done today, and do it. 
The therapist said to stop writing giant lists of things that need to be done. I always write them and never complete them; he says that probably makes me feel more overwhelmed, instead of in control.
I feel out of control with everything right now. 

Things will be so much better when I'm out of here, I feel. I feel so trapped in the city. If I want something to eat, I have to get up and walk somewhere to find it, and spend money. I have no fridge or anything here, I can't keep much food. Even if I go buy things like juice, I have to carry them back from the grocery store. I find this needlessly complicated. I like my suburban lifestyle. I like driving to wherever I need to go. I feel like being here is a handicap, like needing someone to drive me everywhere. Trapped.

I've been having trouble being alone. Scared, lonely, not sure of what to do with myself and afraid of everything. At the same time, I've been having trouble leaving my room, talking to people, going out. Getting nervous just seeing my friends. 
Part of the problem is I have no real routine right now. Everything is random. I do much better when I'm on a real schedule, even if it means getting up at 6:30 am, like I did over winter break. I got to work and did my thing, and it was good. Here, I can't predict anything. I don't know when I'm going to get up, classes are not in the morning but I can't make myself get up at the same time every day, I can't make homework a routine thing. Eating, sleeping are unpredictable. I don't know how to fix this, either. It's hard when you don't respect your own authority. 

On top of that, the social stuff here is such crap. Can't wait to be out of it. I feel so unwelcome in my building. I can't go to the lounge to study, because I'm not welcome there by the sixth floor dwellers. 
I talked to Sandy the other day for a significant amount of time, which I hadn't done for a very long time. I told her all about how I'm leaving the school, and how I don't trust Era anymore, etc. I feel bad that she's on my side and therefore has gotten crap from Gorbo, but I'm thankful for her. I can't believe what a mess all this is. It seems unreal, and I don't think about it most days, but when I see Bryn or Era or one of them it hits me again and I remember all the hate they have toward me. But despite all that, I'm thankful for them. They gave me a feeling of security my freshman year, and I needed that. I had come from a close, tight high school group and needed somewhere to feel safe; they gave me that at first. It's hard to believe that all this fear and insecurity comes from those same people who I missed terribly just over winter break last year, having been so used to their constant friendship in the dorm. The people I drove hours to visit in New York and New Jersey. Things change. 

I love all of you who support me. Thank you. I will get through this; there is no other option. I don't like to disappoint others, and I know I have. Thank you for not giving up on me."

This is my window. I drew on it with crayons, all last semester, after realizing that I could get it off with Goo Gone and it would be a fun and awesome way to decorate. I thought I was brilliant when I realized I could melt crayons and draw with melted wax, hence the boldness of the star in the upper left corner. Not done yesterday, but I don't think I've ever posted it, and I'm starting to think about how I'll be moving out of this room soon. I've done a lot to personalize it; I'm realizing how much <em>place</em> means to me. Having my own space is really important to me, and I feel like I've made this tiny room my own in a lot of ways. This is just one of the many, but certainly one of my favorites. 
Also - the middle top panel is the angry Mario sun. Unfortunately, didn't come out in the picture - I might have to try taking it at night.

Another clever decoration in my room - chalk! I did this in a few places, just filling in colors to break up the white space a bit. It's neat. What makes me even happier, though, is that Jen liked my idea so much that she convinced all her suitemates to draw all over her common room and bathroom with chalk, and it looks great! They have a Guest Wall that everyone signs, and random words and pictures completely covering their suite. It really makes me happy that I inspired this.

I LOVE this. I'm so proud of it. I spontaneously thought that it would be cool to decorate my pill case - why should it lay there in its boring light pinkness? So I came up with this, and it makes me very happy to see. 
Also, this gives me the great idea that EVERYTHING can, and maybe should be painted! Such as, perhaps, my TV. Wouldn't that be fun?

This is my sword! Paul and I have been having a great time swordfighting, but my sword's taken a lot of beating, and his huge samurai sword hasn't. Silly Europeans. Since mine's angular, all the hits to it have become dents. It was very cheap, only $15, but I wanted to see what I could do to repair it before buying a new one. The quillion was pretty beaten up, but I decided I could repair it with my trademark material. (It was originally black as well.) I also sanded it down and repainted it, so now it's looking almost good as new, and I'm proud. I like to take good care of my weapons and instruments. :-)

That is all. Thank you for looking at my random things."

"event","I had a fun weekend. Saturday night I played the radio show with the Rob, which was fun for us, although none of our friends could hear it since the stream was apparently down. We made some makeshift posters advertising the show, and that was entertaining. Afterwards, we went back to Rob's place and played some cards and Scrabble, and it was very entertaining. Hooray.
 
After leaving Rob's at about 5 am, I called up Paul and bothered him, since I knew he had just finished writing a paper and was still up. I headed over to his place and we walked back to my room and went to bed. Later that day we went to see Sin City, which we both liked a lot. It's very stylized and film noir-ish and very comic book-y. (Go adjectives?) The storyline would make it seem like an action movie, but it wasn't really that sort of film. Very unlike anything I've seen; reminded Paul of old detective movies, which makes a lot of sense. I enjoyed it much. I also enjoyed being with Paul in the theatre and being cuddly. We don't go to many movies - this is only the third we've seen together in a theater - so it's nice. It was our 5 month anniversary yesterday. <3

Then we played video games all night. ALL night. He beat Mario 2, and we both beat our own high scores many times in Wario. I also sanded and painted my wooden sword, which had been hurting, and it's much happier. 

I made it to my 10 am class this morning, and am writing this from there, while the prof blathers about the Matrix and the book Fast Food Nation and makes strange jokes. Hey, at least I'm here."

Some idiot randomly BURNED a piece of meaningless paper that was taped to the door! WHAT IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE?

I told my RA, and we're assuming it was nothing personal, because if they wanted to piss me off personally there are more interesting things on the door to ruin. But WHY would someone do that?

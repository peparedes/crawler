her favorite song
A little girl with  nothing wrong
Is all alone

Eyes wide open
Always hoping for the  sun
And she'll sing her song to anyone

Fragile as  a leaf in autumn
Just fallin' to the ground
Without a sound

Crooked  little smile on her face
Tells a tale of grace
That's all her  own

Spinning, laughing, dancing to her favorite song
A little girl  with nothing wrong

But you weren't happy the day I watched you go

And all the things that I wished I had not said
Are played in loops 'till it's madness in my head

Is it too late to remind you how we were
But not our last days of silence, screaming, blur

Most of what I remember makes me sure
I should have stopped you from walking out the door

You could be happy, I hope you are
You made me happier than I'd been by far

Somehow everything I own smells of you
And for the tiniest moment it's all not true

Do the things that you always wanted to
Without me there to hold you back, don't think, just do

More than anything I want to see you, girl
Take a glorious bite out of the whole world"

I don't know why I was in such a hurry to escape three oaks, I miss being around people who pay attention to me. I miss having a best friend too, having&nbsp;a non-corrupt, nice, <u><em><strong>caring</strong></em></u> best friend. Thinking about how things used to be makes me want to cry but I won't because I'm sick of breaking promises to myself and everybody else and I'm sick of crying more than anything in the world. I want so much for my life to change, but at the same time I want it to be the way it was again. I was so happy.<br />I'm going to go take nap #2 now.</font></p>"

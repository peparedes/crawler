"event","Judita and I are back home from Australia. It was kind of terrible to live such a beautiful place but it is good to be home. Tommorow night is her show which I will be attending with her. 

As for the rest of my break I will probably just be spending time with Judita. Knowing her she will try to take me shopping again eventhough that didn't work out that greatly last time. Maybe I will go see my bandmates a couple of times too because eventhough I know they enjoy breaks, I like to interrupt them even more. I will also maybe enjoy things I only can in the US since it looks like for a good majority of the next few months I will be in Europe on my own band's tour or my girlfriend's band's tour.

This update is short because this is what happens when I update more often then I usually do. That is also my excuse for why this update was so terrible."

"event","Currently my girlfriend, my bandmates, and I are in Australia. The tour has been going well so far. Australia is a beautiful place and the crowds are some of the best we've ever had. Judita and I got here on New Year's eve to join up with Brody and Ryan. We came a few days early so we could celebrate Brody's birthday with her. I doubt she would have had as much fun as she had if we hadn't both been there.

The tour in Australia is almost half over. We have about four more dates left. I am sure this tour will end up being one of my favorites but I say that about every tour. So really that means nothing. They are all great I guess you could say. After this tour we have about a three week break before we head back to Europe again. After that tour I am pretty sure that Judita and I will head home before her tour with her band. So far I believe I am going to accompny her on that tour unless something comes up with the Distillers.

Christmas was spent with my mother, sister, Judita, and a few extended family members. I don't remember many details all I remember is that my mother and sister loved Judita and that it was one of the best Christmas' I've ever had. I hope everyone had a great holiday and a happy new year's. I know I did. It's time to end this now and I will be back with another update in a week or so."

"event","I know I've been slacking on the updates, but it really loses it's appeal when I could be meeting fans, hanging out with my bestfriends, or my girlfriend instead of updating. We are on our mini US tour right now. It's been going great. The crowd seems to get more amazing with each night.

I have no idea what I'm doing for Christmas. I will most likely end up going back to Rhode Island to visit my mom and sister. I should probably try to find some time to actually start getting presents or whatever. I always end up giving bad gifts. It's not my fault I can't read people's minds to find out what they exactly want.

There's many things I could update about but I don't feel like it. I've never been one to sit down and type for hours about things and just go on and on like some people I know. It's easier for me to say a few sentences and then come up with a paragraph of excuses to why it's short. That is what I have done just now. So this is the end, have a good day."

"event","So this is kind of late but who cares. Thanksgiving is almost over but I still wanted to make some type of list for the things I'm thankful for. I'm thankful for my bandmates who are the best friends anyone could have. I'm thankful for the success that our band has had recently. I'm thankful for my mother, my sister, and the rest of my family for always supporting me even when they were doubtful. I'm thankful that I'm in a band instead of some fucking 9-5 job. And last but not least I'm thankful for Judita and the time I've spent with her and the times we'll spend in the future together."

"event","So sometime on Friday I arrived back in California. I had to leave Judita and the rest of her girls to go back to Yorba Linda and do some signing. The instore and signing went pretty well. I was amused just by the town's name. I mean c'mon, Yorba Linda. How is that not amusing? I think another band was there, too. Maybe they were called Trapt? Yeah I think that's who it was.

The past few days I have spent either bugging Brody or packing. Eventhough I really have no reason to pack, I'm just going to wear the same thing all the time. It's just what I do, I guess you could say. And even worse it's a tshirt for a band I'm in. By the way that band, Darker My Love, is supposed to have a 7inch coming out sometime soon. So if that actually happens, buy it or something.

Tomorrow we are going to fly to Europe. Oh that flight shall be fun. I must remember to sit the farthest away I can from Brody and Ryan because really I'd prefer not to watch them on this long-ass flight. I think Judita is going to meet us at the airport when we arrive. Then she's going to come along with us on the tour. That'll be cool, just because it's always more fun when she's around. Now I should try to pack or something, so I can have maybe three shirts in rotation during this tour. I'll probably call Judita too, just because I miss her."

"event","There's nothing better than spending Halloween with your girlfriend and two of your best friends. Judita, Brody, Ryan, and I hung out and walked around in LA for most of the night in a drunken state. I can imagine how stupid I looked in that costume of mine. Remind me to never dress up as a bunny or anything else again. Brody dressed up as the Lone Ranger, how scary. So for a majority of Halloween I was drinking or drunkenly making out with Judita.

The rest of the band and I had a show in La Jolla a few days ago. It was some pretty scary shit considering it was so close to where the fires were going on and still are. It went okay I guess. Everyone seemed a little sidetracked but that was understandable. We got through it all right though. After that Judita and I went back to my place where we have been spending a majority of time together lately.

I will be spending the next few days helping Judita pack and packing for myself since I assume I will be going along with her to Europe. Just because it's convienent since her band has tour dates there right before mine does. I don't want to write anymore because I've written everything I wanted to say. So with that, this update is at the end."

"event","I haven't been up to much except hanging out with my lady, Judita. It's nice to have a few weeks off after a tour. I love touring but sometime it's just nice to be home and not have to do anything. Plus after awhile the bus begins to just suck.

On the 29th and 30th we have shows in the Southern California area. I'm pretty sure those are with Queens. I think Judita will probably go to those, too. Then we have more days off which I'll probably spend most of packing for Europe. We'll be there in November with The Bronxxx from the 11th to the 23rd. Then we get the rest of November off and December off for Christmas and shit. Then we go down under. I'm sure that tour will be really fun because Australia is just plain cool. I'm sure Brody will be taking some time to see her family, too.

This update really didn't have a point. Now I'm off to go spend some quality time with my incredible girl Judi."

"event","The past few days of my life have been spent spending time with a girl. This girl is really so amazing that it can't fully be described in words. She's also one of the few who think I'm not horrible. When I'm with her I  forget about everything else that's going on. She's different from any other girl that I've ever been with. She's special, I guess you could say. But not as in special ed. Special as in someone you want to cherish.
Someone you care for, someone you want to be with,etc.

She first came to spend the day with Brody doing girly shit or whatever. I ended up spending time with her after Brody left and I don't know. There was just something about her. I never really had gotten the chance to know her. After having that chance I saw her in a way I had never seen her before. She's different from every other girl. I enjoy spending time with her so much that it makes me want to be with her all the time.

There's really no words to describe how she makes me feel or what I feel for her. She's gorgeous, smart, talented, and just plain amazing. I really don't know how to describe it or anything else. I'm going to end this now though and go spend time with her or something. Just because it's better than talking about it."

"event","The tour has been going well lately. It's been a really fun tour overall so far. The Queens of the Stoneage guys have been great like always. We've been having as much fun as we did on Lolla with them.

Today we had a day off in San Francisco. San Francisco and the area around it is just a great place. I really enjoy it, eh. Brody and I walked up and down Haight Street for the majority of the day. We went into some of the vintage stores and costume stores. After we had looked at most of the stores that we wanted to we went to Amoeba Records. We spent a good amount of time in there since Amoeba is just one of the best record stores. They have everything, literally everything. I picked up a few cds that I had been meaning to get and I think Brody did too.

Later today I think Ryan, Andy, and I, maybe Brody too are going to go look for a local show to go to. I haven't actually been to a show that my band wasn't playing in awhile so it should be fun. I don't really have anything else to update about since I'm usually either playing a show and the rest of the time I'm drunk and acting stupid. It's a good time, really. Oh and you people should im me sometime- distiller tony . I get bored, even when I'm drunk."

"event","We have begun our tour with Queens of the Stoneage. We were in Minnesota yesterday. I don't really care for Minnesota. Now we're on our way to Colorado. This tour may only have 9 shows to it but I'm pretty sure it's going to be one of the best tours. We had a fun time with them on Lolla and I can bet this tour will be even more crazy.

The video for ""Drain the Blood"" is on Mtv.com now and most likely starting to show on Mtv2 or Mtv or something. I don't pay attention when our record label tells us this so I probably don't know all the info. But I do know our album comes out on October 14th and I'm sure all of you will be buying it. I think ""Drain the Blood"" is getting radio airplay, too.

We have a story in Spin magazine. It's actually a really cool article or at least how they set it up. It shows our white trash side and how I get drunk off my ass quite frequently. Speaking of which I'm going to go make the Queen's of the Stonage's merch girl show me how to make that drink that I love and after that get drunk while Brody and I play her and Andy's slapping game."

"event","i love touring with my bandmates. we really do make up one big white trash family. we have brody who's like the mother who makes sure you're eating or makes you watch crappy white trashy shows with her like roseanne. hmm she's kinda like roseanne..except not at all. i should start calling her roseanne. ryan's not really a white trash type of person, he just looks it. andy's like the dad. he always gets first pick at food, whatever. he basically gets his way most of the time. and then i'm sort of the weird kid that doesn't really fit in with the family. it's a good time, almost like typing with no real grammar sense and in all lowercases.

there's an article about us in alternative press. it's an interview with brody and she says good things. buy it, and buy blender because we're in that too. that's all, bye."

"event","Hmmm...let's see... what did I do last year?  I'll need some time to think about this.  What I really mean to say is, I'll go off and do other things and forget about my live journal for another year.  That's it!  I've finally figured out my new years resolution!  I will always be true to myself.  See when I wrote, ""I'll need some time to think about it"" I actually believed myself.  When really all I wanted to do was work on editing my movie.  Or maybe I'm wasting time on live journal because I'm tired of editing.  Man, being true to yourself is not easy.  Maybe I'll just take a nap.  But I'm not sure if I'm really tired of just depressed.  But I think depression is being tired of everything.  Is there a difference between mentally and physically tired?  Rubber tires are so much easier to figure out."

"event","Poe Stang Wins!  I just listed my CRX for sale on Autotrader.com.  My car will be listed on February 3rd. DON'T WAIT BUY NOW!!!  I mean wait until February 3rd then DON'T WAIT BUY NOW!!!
OOOOOOOOOOOH SNAP!!! I got cashier of the month at WAL-MART.  I feel so repected at my job now.  Now no one dares to look at me with even the slightest glimpse of discontent in thier eyes.  I can scan the shit out of some groceries and now everyone knows it.  I have unmatched speed and grace.  Not one chip fractured.  Not one egg shell's integrity compromised.  Not one bottle of sparkling red whine shattered on the floor and not one old man's heart stopped from the frightening explosion of wine and glass.  Wait, I think that one actually happened.  Most of the time I'm only half awake at work.  Well my ego trip lasted at least a few seconds.  Let go of my ego.  Silly rabbit egos are for crooks."

"event","I recently had to say goodbye to Sandcastle Designs.  I will miss moving furniture for a living.  I was fired a couple weeks ago.  I didn't know when to quit.  That job was too physically demanding, way too boaring, and way too outside.  Well not that outside.  It was inside a warehouse (AKA-easy bake oven).  Way too outside would be in a sandy field without a tree in sight.  
Ray I decided to join the dark side.  If you can't beat them, join them.  I went to Wall*Mart as a last resort.  I filled out the application not expecting much.  I actually got tired of filling out my job history and didn't list them all.  The very next day Wall*Mart called to schedule an interview.  I had my interview today.  I thought it wasn't going very well, but I got the job.  They also started me at a higher pay-rate than I expected.  My Blockbuster experience payed off.  All I have to say is, the Beans in this pot are definitely Cool."

"event","My life right now consists of work and more work.  I spend forty hours a week in the Sandcastle Designs warehouse moving furniture (Also making foam rockets and acid cannons on break).  On the weekend I do chores, home improvement, and maintenance.  Although I do somewhat enjoy fixing the house.  I just need a break.  I do it to myself though.  It's not like these things need to be done immediately.  I'm just a perfectionist.  Any unfinished project weighs me down like school homework.  I can't have fun until it's done.  Don't put off till tomorrow what could be done today.  I really wear myself out sometimes.  Well I have to get back to work."

"event","I feel like I must tell about these horrible images.  The sequence starts like a soap opera with the typical soap opera setting.  A guy is talking to a girl trying to win her back.  The funny thing is that I understand through body language because I don't hear any sound.  The guy is reaching for her but he has no arms, just stumps!  The sleeves on his suit are cut back enough for his stumps to stick out.  What is left of his arms is dried and pruney with the bone sticking out.  Actually the stumps look very similar to an old christmas ham.  
      Then the scene suddenly changes to Brian Dennehy staring straight into the camera.  He is looking especially old and decrepit with wild hair.  He lifts up his arm and he has the same putrid looking stump of an arm.  Then he takes a bite off his arm and chews it with his gross, gapped, disgustingly yellow teeth.  He is still staring straight into the camera with a sinister look.  He takes another big bite peeling it off the bone with ease.  The scene cuts again to Brian Dennehy holding what's left of his stump raised out to the side.  His whole shoulder area looks just as gross as his chewed up stump.  He is staring at his armpit and the camera zooms in on his armpit.  I could see something moving aroung just underneath the skin.  Then a jagged broken bone rips out.  The bone is moving back and forth slicing through meat and tendons.  As this is happening Brian says, ""Just cutting my arm off.""  That's where the dream ended.  Ummm... yeah, I don't think I'll get that one out of my head for a while."

"event","It seems most people try to stay so busy they don't time for themselves. It seems most people don't want to think about things.  Thinking about things doesn't always have to be depressing.  Stop and smell the roses.  Enjoy the beautiful things in life.  They may seem small compared to the bigger problems in life but that's why we're here."

"event","Squirrels don't like boys squirrels like nuts and honey.  Squirrels will laugh at boys when they're not funny.  Wait a second, do squirrels even laugh.  I wonder if squirrels have emotions.  I watch the cute little rodents in my yard somtimes.  I analized their movements, they move so fast and constantly twitch.  They also have emotionless eyes like sharks.  My guess is they function off of pure instinct.  Like a program that does what its designed to do.  In our primitive days us humans used to function like that.  But now we're all confused with these stupid things we named emotions.  I wish I could be an emotionless robot sometimes.  Life would be so much easier and a slightly more meaningless.  I'm tired I need to go to sleep.  Sleep is good.  I think I'll sleep with the squirrels tonight."

"event","I'm ready to start the routine.  Even being unemployed has a routine.  Damn!  At best I can look foward to thirty more years of this routine.  At worst about fifty!  It's definitely a good thing that time passes faster as we get older.  Oh it's not so bad.  At least we have our jobs to keep us busy.  I mean keep us from enjoying the best, youthful years of our lives.  Who actually enjoys their job!  Anyone who says they enjoy their job is lying to themselves.  All they've done is accepted this crumby system they're forced to live in.  OK, I'm not writing anymore today.  This can only get worse.  Sorry my first entry is so negative."

"event","While I'm all about speaking with your wallet, I'm also aware that most businesses in a franchise are in fact locally owned and it would be local people being hurt most by a boycott.  That's the main reason I didn't join in on the Chick-Fil-A boycott when its CEO proclaimed his bigotry.

In the case of the PPACA protests among franchise CEOs, depending on how the ownership share works out, the franchise locations owned by a particular franchisee are an individual business.  How many locations a person actually owns and how many full-time employees there are among them is the factor that determines whether the PPACA mandate applies (based on my reading, anyway), not the total number of full-timers in all franchise locations nationwide.

Because of that, I likely won't be joining in on the boycott this time, either.  If John Schnatter actually convinces franchisees to cut employee hours instead of bumping prices by a few cents per pizza, for example (something they have at least a year to hash out), I'll help compensate for their greed by increasing my tip to the driver."

"event","I received the tuner card I was waiting for on Friday, and after installing it I called Comcast to get a CableCard for it.  They gave me an appointment for the next day and, while I was hopeful, I wouldn't have been surprised if I were subjected to the same month-and-a-half wait that I had the last time I had this kind of thing done.

Imagine my surprise, then, when they actually showed up.  An hour into the 3-hour window, but it could still be considered ""on time"".  He didn't know anything about the tuner card, so he let me install the CableCard and take care of all of the other steps while he called in the numbers that Comcast needed.  Once things were synced up, I was able to successfully tune a few channels, but not all that I expected to get (missing were mainly HD and premiums).  He left, as we were both thinking that it might just take a bit of time for those to show up.  They didn't, but a quick call to Comcast sorted things out and minutes later I had all of the channels that I was paying for.

My TiVo replacement is finally up and running!

<img src=""http://www.caerleon.us/lj/wmc_dvr.jpg"" width=639 height=359>

<i>Granted, a better choice for a screenshot might have been either X3 or The Two Towers, but I can't do a full-screen Windows Media Center screenshot and those channels won't display in a window... blasted DRM.</i>

After getting that set up, I installed software for <a href=""http://mychannellogos.com/default.aspx"" target=""_blank"">channel logos</a> and <a href=""http://ww2.fatattitude.com/software/software-about-remotepotato.aspx"" target=""_blank"">web-based scheduling</a>, neither of which would work without a TV tuner and guide data being set up first.  The latter is currently disappointing in the fact that it doesn't honor WMC defaults for series recordings, but the developer is apparently looking into it.

If the next couple of weeks of testing go well, and at the moment I don't have any reason to believe they won't, I'll be wiping and deactivating the TiVo and returning the 2 CableCards currently in it.  At that point, the HTPC upgrade should start paying for itself (aside from the part covered by my year-end bonus), to the tune of around $23/month in savings.

Having 4 tuners instead of 2?  Icing on the cake :-)"

"event","Last night, I started rebuilding my HTPC, almost from the ground up.  One reason is to get some actual GPU acceleration involved, but another is to add DVR functionality to it.

The latter is prompted by my last couple of cable bills... I haven't cut the cable for a few reasons, but I can cut a little out of the bill by eliminating an ""additional outlet"" fee, which I still think is crazy.  While my Tivo Series 3 requires 2 CableCards, they're both in the same box, so treating it as another box seems to be the result of greed on Comcast's part.  I was debating getting one of the newer Tivo boxes, but after hearing reviews of a certain combination of hardware including a certain tuner card, I'm squarely in the DIY camp.  Also, cutting out the Tivo service fee would help even more.

The tuner card in question is the <a href=""http://www.cetoncorp.com/products.php"" target=""_blank"">Ceton InfiniTV 4</a>.  It takes 1 multi-stream CableCard, and gives the ability to tune up to 4(!) digital cable channels at once.  That's one headache I've had occasionally with Tivo... only 2 tuners to go around, and sometimes that just wasn't enough, requiring a shuffling of priority in my series recordings.  I'm in a waiting list at the moment for that part, as it's in such high demand right now, but I can continue with other parts of the project until it arrives.

At the machine's core now sits a <a href=""http://pdde.zotac.com/index.php?page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=flypage_images.tpl&amp;product_id=185&amp;category_id=7&amp;option=com_virtuemart&amp;Itemid=1"" target=""_blank"">Zotac IONITX-F-E</a> motherboard.  GPU acceleration?  Check!  It also has the PCI Express slot that the tuner card needs.

For an operating system, I'm using Windows 7.  It was a bit of a pain to have to buy a copy of Home Premium for this box, but Windows 7 Media Center is currently the ONLY thing that is supported by the (apparently) ONLY multi-tuner digital cable tuner card available outside of paid system builders.  Certainly the best card of its type that I've seen.  WMC's Netflix support also gives me one more reason to get rid of the Roku Netflix box.

I'm still using Boxee, currently as an option in WMC's menu.  It better handles the way that I keep up with podcasts these days, and I prefer its method of handling TV series episodes (on my media server and via internet streaming) to WMC's.

To control everything, I've written a proxy to translate network commands to keyboard input, something similar to what I did when the machine was running Boxee on Linux.  A bit of scripting on my Pronto remote sends those commands to it.  It's a work in progress, but I'll likely be releasing it after I'm satisfied with it.

I'd like to get Amazon's video download service working with it, but for some reason WMC can't read their video files.  A couple things I've read suggest that a Microsoft update is what broke things, but unfortunately I haven't been able to uninstall it (likely part of a cumulative update, which might break more than it would fix in its removal).  At this point, I still have Amazon's software installed, in the hopes that one side or the other will find a fix for it.

Economic meltdown:
""Government, stay out of it!""

Environmental meltdown:
""Why isn't the government doing anything?""

The truth is, they can't, at least not directly.  A federal law was passed after the Exxon Valdez accident in 1989 which gave the owner of the equipment the sole responsibility of oil spill cleanup, penalties and everything.  The government can't do anything except provide oversight, which they've done (via the Coast Guard) since the day that the drilling rig blew up in April.

Who was President when that law was passed?  Shrub Sr.

While, yes, the blame for spills should be heaped on oil companies in spades, there should have been some sort of clause in there for more possible intervention from the government.  Perhaps then, we could get these kind of things cleaned up quickly (as long as, based on historical evidence, one of the Bush clan isn't in office) instead of having to wait while the oil company at fault is putzing around.

"event","When I dropped traditional phone service (and even Vonage) for a more DIY phone system, there was a sharp decrease in the number of fees added to the bill.  I'm still paying monthly for E911, but that's only for one line... the PBX rewrites caller ID for the different lines in the house to one number for 911 calls, which works because they're all at the same physical location.

I always assumed that the others were covered somehow in the normal charges from my VoIP providers, or that they just didn't apply anymore.  Well, I wasn't quite correct in that assumption.

My main VoIP provider, Vitelity, is starting to charge for the <a href=""http://www.fcc.gov/cib/consumerfacts/universalservice.html"" target=""_blank"">Universal Service Fund</a>, and is doing it at payment time when people refill their prepaid balances with them.  I pay enough to cover 3 months at a time, so that means I still have one more tax-free month.  They're doing a credit for those with non-voice services on their account, but I don't know if I'll see any of that, as they give things like dedicated servers as examples.  I do have a fax-to-email number on mine, though, so we shall see.

At the very least, it 1) is less than $40/year at the moment and 2) can be partially expensed as 2 of the lines are business related.  It'll certainly make calculating those expenses more interesting, though.

Now I'm left wondering if the other provider I use, Gafachi, will be doing something similar at some point."

"event","To their credit, though, I was asking for something more on the unusual side for them for an end user.

I was looking for occasional-use mobile broadband, which didn't involve a monthly fee or contract, as I didn't want to pay every month for something I would only be using once or twice a year.  After taking prices and reviews into consideration, Virgin Mobile (via the Sprint/Nextel network) and Verizon (via their own) became the top choices.  Based on the kind of use I'd be making of it, coverage maps, and past experience with Sprint (granted, it's been a few years) and Verizon, I decided to go with the latter.

I started by trying to deal with a local store earlier today, but no one there was trained on dealing with their occasional use prepaid broadband service (known as DayPass).  In place of real information, misinformation was offered instead.  I knew from the website that both built-in and add-on EVDO modems would work, but according to one person there only the former was an option.  The others I dealt with just didn't know.

I came back home and called up the number given on the DayPass page for placing an order.  It took a while, and involved 2 call transfers, but I was finally able to place an order for the hardware.  Apparently, once the hardware and software are installed, I activate it through the computer (that's the ideal, anyway) and then pay for time as I need it.  The card should arrive later this week, and I'll set it up and pay for a session just to make sure that everything works.

The process could have been easier, but at least the result is what I was after."

"event","Based on my experience so far, the concept of integrated application stores (usually seen on smartphones) tends to be a double-edged sword.

On the up side, there are no support emails asking how to download and install such apps.  This is especially true in the case of those that tend not to read published documentation and/or FAQs that address such questions before asking them.

On the down side, it's too easy to publicly judge and then dismiss an app.  To a user, this might seem like a good thing, but to a developer it can be a headache... particularly when the user gives a relatively low rating due to the lack of a feature that is released only an hour or two later.  In the case of the Android app store, a user has 24 hours to cancel an app purchase before their card is even charged... surely that's enough time to send an email to a developer and get a response back, especially if done during the week.

Interestingly enough, since adding said feature, not one purchase has been canceled."

"event","<b>A little backstory</b>

When I started working with DIY VoIP as a way to save money, I ended up setting up accounts with 2 prepaid VoIP providers, Vitelity for voice and later Gafachi for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T.38"" target=""_blank"">T.38 fax support</a>.  So far, I haven't been able to get T.38 working all that well, so I started to think of other ways to use my balance at Gafachi... perhaps as backup in case I couldn't reach any of the servers at Vitelity, which so far hasn't yet happened.

<b>The new info</b>

Last Friday, I found out how to get the current international calling rates for both providers in easily-parsable download files, and wrote scripts to use those to periodically update a local database and then calculate charges based on the number called.  The original idea was to have that save me time manually calculating those charges if I ever made an international call that could be written off as a business expense, which isn't that difficult considering I work from home and we have partners in Europe and South America.

<b>The new idea</b>

When I was looking at the call rate info and figuring out the best way to parse and use it, I noticed something... while Vitelity has the same call rate for US48 and Canada outgoing calls (1.44 cents/min, the cheaper of the two domestic rates), the Gafachi rate for calls to Canada is less than half of that (0.68 cents/min).  While I don't make that many international calls, most of the ones I do make are to Canada.  While there are differences in rates for other countries as well, it's generally not to that degree.

That has me thinking this morning about the possibility of routing calls using one provider or the other, based on cost.  It actually wouldn't be that hard... I can use the same database table and query that I'm using for billing calculations, and add something to sort results by call rate as well.

This could be very cool indeed..."

Plans for the trip to Seattle in May are really starting to come together.  I now have reservations in place for a hotel room, rental car, and flight.  For those of you that I know in the area (read: <lj user=alathia> and <lj user=mieper>), let me know when would be best to get together over Memorial Day weekend... I'll be there for 4 full days, and on one of those (not sure yet which one) I have tentative plans to meet with a couple of friends from Vancouver at the Science Fiction Museum.  The rest of the time is pretty much open at the moment.

I've become a serious tea drinker this year... not Lipton's, not the flavored dust in bags that is sold at most stores, but good quality loose-leaf tea.  I've also become a big fan of <a href=""http://www.adagio.com/"" target=""_blank"">Adagio Teas</a> as a vendor.  Most of what I've bought there so far have been their sampler packs, so I can get an idea of what I do and don't like, but I'll soon settle into a list of teas for regular purchase.  If any of you are tea drinkers and want to try out their products, let me know... I can send a $5 gift certificate your way for that first purchase.

In the last week or so, I've also become a fan of Amazon's Kindle 2.  I bought one almost 2 weeks ago, it arrived later that week, and I already have a handful of books (mostly free... good timing there) and magazines on the device.  I also plan to make serious use of the (currently) free 3G web access, mainly to read several news feeds that I have funneled through Google Reader.

CacheMate for Android is coming along well.  I have a lot of the backend done now, and I'm currently working on piecing together the GUI, which the Android platform makes surprisingly easy for database-driven applications.  The only major hurdle that I have left is figuring out the best way to do import and export of data, especially importing as stuffing data into the database tends to be more expensive than reading it, and a person might want to do something else while that's going on.  I think I'm close to getting that figured out, though."

Dear Hulu content providers,

I know this is a huge thing to ask of media executives, but... don't be stupid.  Yes, that is the only word I can think of for the desire to confine the Hulu video player, which is where ALL of the precious non-skippable ad space is anyway, to the Hulu website instead of allowing it to be embedded in other places such as Boxee and TV.com.

The guys that actually maintain Hulu.com don't mind.  They actually want the extra eyeballs on the content and ads.  Why don't you?

As I said... stupid.

(For the record, Hulu was one of the least-used parts of Boxee for me, but only because it never worked properly. I was hoping for those bugs to be fixed, though, not for it to go away completely)"

Ever since its inventor was first <a href=""http://dl.tv/2008/11/dltv_ep_258_boxee_inventor_dav.php"" target=""_blank"">showing it off</a> online, I've been interested in a little software package called <a href=""http://www.boxee.tv"" target=""_blank"">Boxee</a>.  For those not familiar, it's a networked media player, but with a twist... it's socially connected, so you can see what friends are watching/hearing and make/receive recommendations.  It's also possible to stream video and audio from quite a few internet-based sources as well as from your own network and the machine it's running on.

Over the last weekend, I built a small computer and loaded the Linux version of Boxee on it, and so far I'm loving it.  It's still in alpha release status, so there are plenty of problems to iron out and features to add, but I'm already getting usefulness out of it.  The internet video streaming works quite well, at least for most of the sources I've checked out so far.  I've also been playing DVDs with it, not only directly but also from ripped images (one of my favorite features so far for local media... Matrix marathon, anyone? :-).  If things continue to go well with it, I may be getting rid of my DVD player, if only to reduce the amount of hardware.

One of the features that recently got me even more interested in it was the ability to stream video from Netflix.  As it turns out, this feature has a while to go before it'll be available on the Linux version, primarily due to the way it works with the site (their web-based player, I believe) and the fact that lots of work remains on what that system relies on.  They say it'll probably be a little over a year from now.  In the meantime, at least I've still got my Roku Netflix box.

Before I can get any real enjoyment out of it, I'll need to finish connecting it to the entertainment center.  I should be getting a digital audio connector for that purpose, sometime this week or next, and then the AC3/DTS passthrough will be thoroughly tested :-)

Another part of that was getting my Pronto remote working with it.  I didn't buy any IR hardware for the machine, as the remote can connect directly to things over a network, but on its own it can't handle the way that Boxee receives that sort of thing.  Most of the weekend was spent writing software top bridge that gap (which I plan to release after some necessary polishing) and scripting on the remote."

The funniest part of the entire call was the guy's insistence that he could downgrade the plans for the numbers I had on my account (3 of them at the time of cancellation), after they were already ported away from my account and Vonage therefore having no legal control over them.  Almost as funny were his repeated attempts at offering me other things to try to get me to stay (or come back, considering the aforementioned number porting).  I knew that there was no way in hell, though, that he could come up with anything usable that would match what I'm paying now.

After my repeating the news about the number porting at least twice, and just flat out saying ""No"" at least 3 times, he finally agreed to disconnect my service and wrap things up.  You'd think that these guy's paychecks were being docked for every customer they lost.

Hopefully I don't fall into the same pain that others have mentioned of being billed by Vonage after service was disconnected, or having their numbers kept around in Vonage's database so no one in their network could call the numbers even though they were being hosted somewhere else.  That one in particular can be tested rather easily, though.  If any of you Vonage customers that see this want to help, let me know and I can send you my digits and you can see if you get through.

In case I fall into the ""billed for nothing"" crap, I've already got hard copies of the disconnection emails and billing stuff from their website, ready to fax.  In fact, I may go ahead and use the private fax-to-email that I can do these days to get an emailable PDF of those ready to send... again, just in case."

<b>Backstory</b>

When I first started streaming music from Last.FM, I found a script called Last.FM Proxy that allowed me to use it with my SoundBridge and home stereo (my preferred way to listen to digital music at home).  It worked well for a while, too, but it didn't take long to run into snags.

Between my entertainment center and the rest of my home network is a wireless connection, which at times can be a little flaky.  When that happens, or even looks like it MIGHT happen, the SoundBridge can develop an itchy trigger finger when it comes to reconnecting to an audio stream.  In the case of LFP, whenever the SoundBridge reconnected, the proxy tried to do the same with regard to the Last.FM servers.  Those servers don't like it when you try to restart a song, so at times during the day I would end up with a lot of unwanted track skipping.

<b>My solution</b>

The idea that I had was to separate the Soundbridge&lt;-&gt;proxy connection from the proxy&lt;-&gt;Last.FM connection.  That way, the latter wouldn't be broken up by the former quite so easily, and instead the former would just pick up more or less where it left off.

In theory, this didn't seem that difficult.  The difficulty arose in making it happen.  Last.FM Proxy is written in Python, which isn't that big a deal (I don't know the language that well, but I can figure it out pretty easily).  What was a big deal was the fact that my changes would have to be fairly major, that Python is a huge stickler for indentation, and that the guy that wrote the script didn't believe in using tab characters.  That combination of things didn't do a lot for making that project approachable, so I decided to rewrite the thing in a language that I knew a lot better... C++.

<b>So far, so good</b>

At this point, I have a working Last.FM proxy server that streams from their servers to any Shoutcast-compatible streaming client (like the SoundBridge), scrobbles listened tracks to their servers, and implements the basic controls that are currently possible with the Last.FM streaming/scrobbling protocols (not everything that you can do in the Last.FM client, but most of it).  I did accomplish my goal of making it resistant to the SoundBridge's twitchiness, and an interesting side effect is that multiple streaming clients can receive the same content at the same time.

What's left?  Not a lot.  There are some rough edges to smooth out, but not many major pieces left.  Those pieces are a user interface of some sort and, oh yeah, a name :-)

The user interface is going to be web-based, using HTML and a healthy dose of JavaScript.  I already have what I hope is enough in the server code to support it, so now it's all about web development.  I'm also implementing things in the server that could allow for more interesting UIs... things like systray-style apps for GUI environments (starting with Windows, if I go that route).  It may even be an interesting first project using Adobe's AIR platform.

The name isn't so easy... I'm coming up dry there.  It's unfortunate that the most logical name for the program is taken by the one I'm trying to replace.  Any suggestions?"

I finally was able to build the dedicated box for the PBX when I got back from NC, and it's now up and running.  I've started on some features that I planned to do once it was at this point, and I'll be continuing on that in the coming months.

Already done:

<b>Web-based voicemail:</b> Essential!

<b>Anti-Spam:</b> Telephony spam, that is, which covers not only anonymous call rejection but also killing of auto-dialers that use toll-free numbers as caller ID.  If one of those comes up, it plays a telezapper tone, then delays a couple of seconds with a short ""please wait"" message before ringing the phone.  So far, if the phone has rung at all as a result of one of those, it's only rung once :-)

<b><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_Number_Mapping"" target=""_blank"">ENUM lookup</a> on outbound calls:</b> Checks for a possible free direct VoIP connection, as opposed to a non-free connection over the phone network.

Next on the list:

<b>White/grey/black listing for the anti-spam logic:</b>
White - bypass anti-spam checks/telezapper (expecting very few of those)
Grey - drop into the called line's voicemail w/o ringing phones
Black - reject call, with the possibility of dropping into a special voicemail box if they want to protest

<b>Caller ID name (CNAM) override list:</b> Per-line and global lists of numbers to specify names for, instead of looking the names up online in a phone company's database

<b>Quick-dial directory:</b> This may be tied to the CNAM override list, or be a completely separate list... I don't know yet.  The office phone can download an XML phone directory... I might have this feed that as well.

<b>More reliable fax sending:</b> Internal fax-to-email to mirror the external fax-to-email that I already have... internet VoIP sucks for that kind of thing.  If I encounter someone who needs an actual fax and not just an emailed PDF of one, I may have to set up some pay-as-you-go <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T.38"" target=""_blank"">T.38</a> termination, but I'll cross that bridge when I get there.

<b>Text-to-speech toys:</b> I'll be using Festival (an open source text-to-speech engine) for this.  The first one might be the day's weather forecast, but the possibilities are endless.

Any more ideas?

As the testing of the setup is still going very well, I'll start porting the numbers from Vonage probably next week.  After that's done, I'll likely be registering them so that others can find them in ENUM lookups as well.

So far, things seem to be working very well and, even better, with the IP office phone I finally have a speakerphone that works :-)

I don't think I've ever done any sort of per-minute payment for home calls (up to 1.44 cents/min for most outbound domestic calls), and that certainly isn't the norm for the US, but in this case it potentially saves me quite a bit.  For 4 lines and 1 virtual number, what I pay Vonage works out to be around $95/month.  So far, my usage with them has peaked at 782 minutes in a single month.  Worst case, that would come out to $32.13 (20.87 monthly + 11.26 usage) with Vitelity.  It would probably be even less than that, considering Vitelity rounds call times in 6-second intervals, rather than to the next full minute like Vonage.

I did have to add yet another service to the mix to get everything working... <a href=""http://www.cnam.info/"" target=""_blank"">www.cnam.info</a>, which does caller ID name lookup for US and Canada numbers.  Vitelity claims to have that service, but I could never get it to work.  It costs $.05/lookup, with a minimum of $2.50/month, but considering the savings stated above I'm certainly not complaining."

Why am I doing this?  The experience is one reason, but I'm also doing it to save a little money over what I'm paying Vonage each month.  Vitelity's service involves per-minute charges for outgoing calls, and for incoming calls in certain cases, but the cost just to maintain the lines is MUCH less by comparison.  I have 2 lines here at home that rarely get any kind of traffic and, combined with lower costs to maintain those and the lines that do get a lot of traffic, things start to balance out in my favor.

I've got a runnable PBX server at this point, as well as an account at Vitelity, and later this week I'll be getting some hardware so that I can get a good start on this project.  I can't wait :-)

"event","To those living in the US... Happy Thanksgiving!  A little early, but who cares really :-)

I must admit that I'm already well on my way with Christmas decorations (sound familiar, <lj user=eicnan>? :-), with the tree up and lit (though not decorated yet) and the outside lights up but not yet active.  I'm saving what's left for the weekend, but had some time to kill and figured I'd go ahead and get started on it.

Happy birthday to <lj user=djbrian_s>, and early birthday wishes to <lj user=msmorgie> and <lj user=bjeorn>!"

"event","It seems that Last.fm is getting very close to figuring me out.  Very few songs have I skipped today while streaming from their servers, and in the case of one of them it was a filler track that barely qualified as a song in my opinion.

The last week has involved a bit of virtual housekeeping for me:

- Creation of a <a href=""http://nexus.caerleon.us/"" target=""_blank"">new home page</a>, which reflects and slightly makes up for the fact that I haven't done anything with the old homepage on my server in years.

- Completed migration of photos from my old gallery site to the <a href=""http://www.smittyfoto.com/"" target=""_blank"">new one</a>.

- Moved the last of my domains that were handled by other DNS servers, primarily for URL redirection, to my own.  Now everything's under one roof, so to speak.

I'm definitely looking forward to a drive north on Saturday.  A couple of friends in Charlotte hold a bonfire at their parents' farm in Mt. Holly almost annually, and I've tried to make it every time as it's about the only time that I get to see a certain circle of friends in that area."

"event","If there's anything I like about working for a small company (or at least this one in particular), it's the flexibility of breaking down vacation time to even the smallest portions as needed.  My current benefits plan calls for 15 vacation days in a year, and with our being in the company for 5 months this year that comes out to 6.25.  The owner is cool enough that I'm able to take that 1/4 day (2 hours) off and hopefully beat most of the traffic heading north for Thanksgiving :-)"

"event","Thursday afternoon, I started looking seriously at <a href=""http://www.last.fm/"" target=""_blank"">Last.fm</a> and <a href=""http://www.pandora.com/"" target=""_blank"">Pandora</a> as not only a way to get some customized internet ""radio"" streaming, but also through that to discover new artists that I might be interested in.  Both seem to take different approaches to the same thing, but there were a couple of things about Last.fm that brought me to their side... the social aspect of it, as well as the fact that it's MUCH easier to get Last.fm streaming to the <a href=""http://www.roku.com/products_soundbridge.php"" target=""_blank"">Roku SoundBridge</a> (my preferred way to listen to digital music at home) than to do the same with Pandora.

So far, I'm enjoying it.  I spent most of Friday letting it monitor my listening to my MP3 collection (also easier to do with Last.fm), and at the moment I'm listening to some recommendations the site is making.  A lot of the artists I already know, but it's playing songs that I didn't previously know from those familiar artists, primarily because they don't get a lot of air time around here... that, or I'm not listening to the right stations :-)

If anyone wants to find me there, the username is the same as it is here."

"event","Months after I buy the Roku Netflix box, TiVo <a href=""http://blog.wired.com/business/2008/10/tivo-set-to-str.html"" target=""_blank"">announces</a> that they're going to be able to stream Netflix instant watch titles by the end of the year.  The cynic in me, knowing their previous attempts at keeping to a release schedule, says it'll probably be sometime next spring.  Still, it's cool.

I'm still planning to keep the Roku box, though, as <b>they</b> <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/technology/2008/07/02/netflix-roku-box-tech-intel-cx_mji_0702netflix.html?feed=rss_technology"" target=""_blank"">are announcing</a> that it will soon not be dependent on Netflix as its sole source of content.  The current rumors mention sites like Hulu.com, but I don't think they've officially announced any specifics yet.  It'll be interesting to see who they manage to partner with in that regard.

Two thumbs up on the director's cut of Dark City.  I know the theatrical version fairly well, so it was easy to see where the changes were made, and IMO they were well done.  Seeing the movie in HD was also nice :-)

Once a year, I take a few of my vacation days and actually <b>go somewhere</b>, besides NC which I see a few times a year.  Every other year, I try to make New Mexico part of that trip to see the part of my family that lives there, and this year the entirety of the trip was there.  At the moment, I'm thinking seriously about making next year's destination Seattle... not only for the sights, but also because of the 5 or so people that I know there, a couple of whom may be reading this :-)  Those up there that I have met before, I haven't seen in at least 10 years, so it'll be good to see them again as well as meet those that I haven't yet seen."

"event","This weekend was a busy one, but a few things were accomplished.  The biggest of them would be...

- Wrapping up the next Windows Mobile releases of CacheMate.  The Pocket PC version I released today, and the smartphone version I'll be releasing tomorrow.

- Paying off the smaller part of the 80/20 split mortgage on my condo!  Next on the list is the loan for the new Escape.

I'm looking forward this week to finally being able to resume the work project I was on before we were bought out nearly 3 months ago.  I tried to get back on it last week, but ran into having to do something I didn't think I was going to have to do.  I've made some serious headway on that, though, so I should be able to get back on the old project around mid-week... and then try to remember where I left off.  That's going to be the hard part after that long.

<lj user=eicnan>, I'm watching something at the moment that you'd probably get a big kick out of.  I'm not telling you what it is, but I will say this... keep an eye on your mailbox this week :-)"

I had recently learned about <a href=""http://www.dosbox.com/"">DOSBox</a>, and spotted my old Warcraft 2 CD the other day when I was looking for software while rebuilding my Windows tower.  Today, I finally tried installing the game on my laptop, and it's up and running now quite well!</lj-cut>"

"event","After I created <a href=""http://maeglin73.livejournal.com/244524.html"" target=""_blank"">this</a>, I started thinking about putting a print of it on a wall here.  I decided where I wanted to put it this morning, so I bought a frame and cranked out an 8x10 over lunch.  Now I just have to hang it :-)

One of the two ""desktop"" machines here, the one I use mainly for video editing, was running an aging install of Windows 2000 until a couple of days ago.  Now, it's running XP Pro and has roughly 3 times the system hard drive space as before (a separate half-terabyte beast holds captures and DVD/CD masters), eliminating a pitiful 6GB system drive and allowing more room to grow.  For one, that allows me to use the latest versions of TiVo Desktop, Kodak EasyShare (for the 8x10 printer), and anything else that running Win2K has held me back on.

The PS3 also got a storage boost this week.  What was a 60GB model is now a 250GB model (insert Tim Allen grunt here).

I also have <a href=""http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16823109056"" target=""_blank"">a new keyboard</a> at my desk.  Just before I started telecommuting, I upgraded the KVM setup to use USB for the keyboard and mouse (which came in handy for the work laptop and the ShuttleXpress cabling as well), with my old AT-style keyboard going through an adapter to make it work with the new setup.  Whenever I'd switch between machines, though, I'd get odd stuff in the keyboard buffer.  So far, using a real USB keyboard seems to have fixed that problem.

It may be designed to work with Windows, but the keyboard also works well with my Linux server.  The extra keys don't currently do anything, but some experimentation with <a href=""http://hocwp.free.fr/xbindkeys/xbindkeys.html"" target=""_blank"">xbindkeys</a> should help things there..."

The cool part?  Only two steps in between:

- Dry brush filter

For those wondering about last night's tweet, CacheMate didn't win any of Pocket PC Mag's Best Software of 2008 awards, but it was named as a finalist in the GPS Geocaching category.  That's what I know so far, anyway.  Apparently the whole charging for the award graphics thing is due to a cash flow problem with them, and this will likely be the last such contest, but still..."

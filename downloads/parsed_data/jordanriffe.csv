"event","so since the last time i was on here things have gotten so much better.&nbsp; the one girl i thought i liked didn't work but that doesn't matter because i finally got to hang out with morgan from work and well yeah it was amazing. everything about her her face smile brains looks everything... we have so much in common its rediculous.&nbsp; she has made me so happy i haven't felt like this in so long and it feels good.&nbsp; i can't stop being all happy when i'm near her or talking to her.&nbsp; things are looking up though. the band is going great and my life is going good other than work but oh well thats okay with me not everything can be so perfect. i also stopped taking the pills again this time for good i was depressed and that wasn't the way to go but it happens. i'm good now."

"event","so this weekend has been amazing it all started out on friday night when i went with dizzle, joe, fran, nalu, nick, matt, sue, and amy to see amy's art exibit. which was rather cool. but before i got there i took an ENDO that i got off of diz.&nbsp; it took me back to a time in my life that wasn't that great but it wasn't that bad either.&nbsp; so half way into the night i took another one and then started drinking... not a good combo, but i was fine and having a blast.&nbsp; after amy's art thing we went to sugar mom's (bar) and had some drinks then it got to be 11:30 and sue and matt wanted to go home and i didnt want to be out all night so i decided to go with them to the car.&nbsp; On the way me and matt had a good talk about how i have alot of feelings for his cousin lyne, he told me to go for it and i was shocked, i love matt for being understanding he knows how i am how i can truely be a nice guy when i want to.&nbsp; i told him that i would treat her right and put her on a pedastool because thats how a good girl should be treated like a princess. but enough about that.&nbsp; 

it's now saturday and i wake up sometime after 12:30 feeling good and rested from a long week of not much sleep and worrying, i call joe and get ready to go to his&nbsp; house while there i chill with him and matt and just bullshit about the day.&nbsp; later matt calls me and tells me its heather's birthday and she wants us to stop buy, we do it was fun and nice seeing her again. after that the fun bus(metaphorically speaking) at the pub. so we are all chilling there me, nalu, joe, fran, amy, pete, pagen, nick, matt.&nbsp; sue comes up cuz she heres that matts ex carly is there, that was funny seein her fat ass. me and nalu decide to raid amy's purse and to our surprise we find tylenol 3's in her purse so me and him split three of them and have more to drink it was such a good night woulda had more to drink if i didnt have to drive home but oh well another night.&nbsp; now being easter the first thing i do when i wake up at 12 is take a endo and buy vitamin water.&nbsp; i spend most of the day downloading music and talking to nick it was a pretty good day.&nbsp; but still i have on my mind that one person i would love to tell how i feel but i still can't/won't but what can you do.&nbsp; for the downward spiral... i may start back up again on somethings i really don't want to but just because there is nothing better to do i just might..."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so i've been having a hard time sleeping.&nbsp; i'm up all night for no apparent reason... well maybe there is a good reason. you like i said before i really like this girl and i can't do anything about it because... I'M THE NICE GUY, which pisses me off.&nbsp; i like her and she has a boyfriend so what i can like whoever i want when i want, it's just the matter of telling that person or just letting it go.&nbsp; You pick!&nbsp; i just can't and&nbsp; all the advice i get is to just go for it. I HAVE TO.&nbsp; may be sometime soon maybe not, i just wish i could sleep better.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  on another note, my job still sucks. i just want to move on but i'm comfortable with my position and kinda don't wanna leave.&nbsp; i wish i could talk in metaphorical terms but i suck at that so i just kinda have to go all out with it and be very blunt.&nbsp; i tell it how it is and sometimes thats a good thing and sometimes that can be a bad thing. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  (Moving Out)!!! thats what i wanna do so badly. i wanna come home to my own place or a place i can share with the band.&nbsp; i wanna be able to come home and not be bothered by anyone. no stupid questions or anything just a simple ""hi"" will do. and fuck trying to talk to me in the morning, i usually just kinda make a sound when someone in my family talks to me before i go to work. it sucks but whatever i&nbsp; dont really mind that much living here just i can't really drink at home because my parents don't like it and i have to respect the rules... i do live at home for free so i guess i can deal. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ANOTHER CONVERSATION THAT WILL GET LOST IN TRANSLATION."

"event","<font size=""2"">The story so far:&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This has been a crazy year.&nbsp; I've grown up a whole lot and learned so much about myself.&nbsp; Since I've been single for the last year I've grown to understand me, what i like, don't like and more.&nbsp; Some times i can be depressed for stupid reasons and other times i can be fine and happy. Since joining(reforming) the band Robots &amp; Racecars I have been happy not happy enough the the only way it could get better is if i was waking up in a van in some town i've never been to.&nbsp; Music is my life right now i try so hard to be the best i can and enjoy what I'm doing and it is actually working. since Nick has joined the band it's been even more fun. i love all of my friends to death, the band: Matthew, Frannie, and Nick. Joe b, Amy b, and anyone else i hang with on a regular basis.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  I also have some other things that I have a hard time talking about... girls!&nbsp; There is this one girl I like a whole lot but can't tell her. First reason why is because she has a boy friend and I'm not that kinda guy who would try to ruin something for my own gain.&nbsp; The second reason is I'm scared to death of her.&nbsp; when you like a person and you don't know how they feel about you, you don't wanna mess up the little bit of a friendship that you have.&nbsp; Now for the reasons why I like her,&nbsp; she is very intelligent, Beautiful, kind, loving, funny, quiet, and so much more that really can't be put into words.&nbsp; What do i do?&nbsp; tell her and feel stupid or just pretend like i don't and hope it goes away. It can't go away,&nbsp; I have been holding this in for eight months and said nothing to anyone.&nbsp; i had&nbsp; one chance about five years ago but when for a different girl... which i don't regret at all it was the happiest time of my life.&nbsp; Then i had another chance eight months ago or so and&nbsp; i may have blown my chance then.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was still dating this guy who was super controlling and a complete jerk off.&nbsp; I tried to tell her but she didn't listen and got hurt, but you live and you learn. &nbsp; Now i would love to be able to show her the time of her life,&nbsp; I'm a good guy in her words, but i want to be able to really show her that. When you look at her most guys would just want to sleep with her, well i don't even care about that i just want to be with her.&nbsp; I would try my hardest to be the best person i could ever be she just doesn't know it.&nbsp; I just don't know what to do about&nbsp; the whole situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My job discourages me.&nbsp; I love to work on cars, but not for such little money.&nbsp; I need a raise but it doesn't look like that is gonna happen anytime soon.&nbsp; I've been there 8 months and have gotten absolutely jack shit. i get treated like crap by my boss and i allow it.&nbsp; I can do more than the two other lube techs in that place and one when to school to be a mechanic i went for auto body.&nbsp; I just don't know why i get walked on by so many people.&nbsp; i have to stop it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  </font>"

Five glasses changed my minds
Seems like the tikking hands 
are taking their time
I guess I've been at home 
for longer than it takes to unwind
So slap me if I step out of line

Now in smaller spases, 
kareless lust intoxikated
Away from prying eyes
And rabid smiles
And everything's shattering
My invitation was 
involuntary dialation
And now I kan't rekall your name

I think we've met before
It was last Christmas 
on our parents' akkord
You were the young man in the kostume 
that was hard to ignore
And I was feeling 
hopelessly bored

now you're konversation's
scholarships and okkupations
you look so different than before
When... 
nevermind anyway... 
this rekless violation
tarnishing my reputation
Has left me nothing kind to say

<lj-cut text=""8 things..."">
1) I have alwayse tried to make a point of being open minded about things and wanting to try everything at least onse bekus of my aunt.  She said she hated seafood bekus she didn't like the smell of tuna...but she never tried anything, and I loved seafood and kouldn't understand how she kould pass up on knowing such great stuff bekus she was too pig-headed to try it...I think I was like 5 years old when I desided this...

2) My family would alwayse try to challange me with problems to see what kind of things I kould kome up with...they were just small things like ""One of my friends aksidentally bumpped his elbow when he was kleaning his ears and god a q-tip stuk all the way inside...what do you think we kould use to get it out??""  They seemed like they really valued my input and I think it's the reason I'm sutch a good problem solver today...

3) When I start thinking of an odd situation, I'll keep on thinking about it until I kan't kome up with any other possible weird chain of events...if they're gross I'll usually karry it out way too far...and then if I kan I try to bring things bak to the beginning kus full sirkle things seem more komplete in my mind...

4) Red hair on a girl has alwayse been and will alwayse be my favorite.  It started with a girl in my preschool Kathleen Rikatellie (don't think that's how it was spelled but that's how it sounded).  Long natural red hair, it was the sexiest thing I've ever seen and it's stuk sinse then.

5) I kan usually understand a lot of different things and if I don't, I try to get some sort of x-planation so I kan figure things out...but there are some things I will just never understand.  The biggest one is ""Why do people go to bars that have nothing else to do inside of them but sit and drink??""  It doesn't make any sense to me...lets go out to a jam pakked plase, that's really krappy looking when they turn the lights on, so we kan pay too mutch to get drunk and not hear eachother's konversations.  Give me a danse floor, pool tables, karaoke...anything fun to do and I'm all for it...otherwise what is the point??

6) I have bekome addikted to buying movies.  I'll make spesial trips to blokbuster or gamestop just to see what movies I kan get in the cheap sektions.

7) I don't know why but I've never been one to put piktures up at all...the only two piktures I ever put up like in frames and everything were ones of Jeanette that she bought me herself.  I really liked them a lot.  I've got an awasome pikture frame of Figment (the purple dragon charakter from Disney) that I put up wherever I move to, but I never put a pikture in it.  I don't know why, I really love having piktures of the people I love, but I never do anything with them...that's just how I am.

8) I have very sensative eyes and ears.  My eyes start to water at the slightest gust of wind and if I yawn too hard.  I kouldn't open my eyes under water until about 5 years ago, and if I get anything in them, I kan't funktion until it's out.  If I feel anything odd about my ears I freak out and immediately have to go klean them...I wind up kleaning my ears about 3 times a day on average...I think that's bekus no matter why I went into the Dr's offise when I was young, they alwayse said I had an ear infektion...it never failed...so now I'm massivly O""see""D about keeping them uber-klean all the time...

To change this up a little...if there's something I didn't hit on that you want to know about me...ask me...anything at all...I'm pretty open and honest about most things...

And as for taggin people...well...If you kan read this, konsidder yourself tagged I guess.  Most of you won't do it, but that's ok really..."

<lj-cut text=""Professional Grosserie Shopper..."">

There are many people that are pretty busy don't have a lot of time to spend grosserie shopping.  Not only that, there are even more people that spend far too mutch money on grosseries bekus they don't klip koupons, they don't look thru the papers to find the good sales, and they only go to one plase for ALL of their needs bekus taking x-tra trips are just too mutch of a hastle (espessially now with gas prises).

What if there was someone that kould offer to do all that for you??  On top of all the time and money you'ld save from going to do it all yourself, you have to remember that this person is doing it for a hand-full of people and kan save even more money by buying the bulk deals...I'm estimating that on an average, they kould save every person they shop for at least $50/month minimum in just the kost of grosseries...

So, now the question bekomes, if they would, how mutch would people (wether it be just one busy person, a house full of roommates, a family where both the parents work...whatever the situation may be) pay for that kind of servise??

"event","This is long and winded, horribly written, something just thrown together kus I was bored at work and started thinking about it...turned into this...probably has missing information, some of it might be wrong, but I only know what I know and here's my opinion from what I know...

<lj-cut text=""What if..."">

As a lot of you know or kould have guessed by now, I'm not really that politikal of a guy.  I know I'm a bastard bekus I don't vote and blah blah blah...but really, it's bekus I have no opinion.  I don't study up on kandidates, I don't watch debates, and I'm pretty mutch satisfied with knowing that no matter whoever I kould possibly vote for is hell bent on filling their pokkets with money and making a name for him/herself in the history books.  So seriously, I leave the voting up to the people who aktually kare about paying attention to the little things kandidates have to say about themselves so that they kan get votes.  This is an elektion year, and it is going to be one of the most intense in my mind bekus of all the things I've started adding up.

I only really talked to my mom about these things bekus she's been gung-ho about keeping tabs on things that the George W. administration has been doing...but it seems as though, sinse the beginning of his reign, he has been taking steps toward overthrowing our system of government to bekome the 1st emperor of the US...it may seem odd, but hear me out...

My 1st thoughts started with the patriot akt...it was probably the biggest step he needed to take...and really it was a brilliant way to go about it.  
You supply fear, the fear that a war is not only breaking out, but that the enemy kould be your next door neighbor. So now everyone is skreaming, ""Oh no, what are we gonna do??"" they step in and tell ya not to worry about it, they got it all taken kare of, all we have to do is take a way a portion of our freedoms, anyone speaking out against the kountry is deklaired an automatik threat to the kountry, and what does it matter, bekus the people who love this kountry won't be speaking out against it right??  Everyone is lulled into a sense of sekurity that they really don't even need.  And there's your step one komplete...

Step 2, the wire-taps.  ""Well now, we have to be absolutely sure that people we think are a threat, aktually are a threat, don't worry, we're not going to spy on everyone's konversations, only those that we believe to possibly be a threat...and who knows what kind of time it'll take to go thru all the paper-work mumbo jumbo?  You don't want a bomb to go off in time square and we not know about it bekus the order for a fone tap is sitting on some supreme kourt judges desk now do ya??  So what ya say we just go ahead and skip that branch of the governmet for a while...we'll take the burden off of their hands for a while."" And now big brother is listening...he has the authority to listen in on any and every konversation ever taking plase anywhere in or thru the US without having to ask for anyone's permission.  If you ask me, it's only a matter of time until every street korner has a high-powered kamera on top of a light post...I don't know how it is for the rest of the US, but for those of you in the Chicago area, I'm guessing it's gonna be a blue light spesial everywhere you go...

There were probably more steps after that and before the next biggest one that I saw, but I'm not aware enuff to talk about them.

The biggest sign I've seen is the forming of his own army...hey, if it kan work for a sith lord, it kan work for George W.  That's really the biggest step...if you have a bought and paid for army that is better than the one in the kountry he rules and only answers to that one man...what's stopping him from just saying, ""Listen kountry, you had a good run with all this demokrasy bs...but now your in my hood!""??

And really...it's probably really bad for me to say this, but there is a big part of me that kannot wait for it to happen.  I want the whole works.  I want him to try and burn everything the US is...just so that there will be a rise of power against him.  It would seriously give me a reason to fight for something.  I don't love the polotisians, I don't love the government, I don't love the skrewed up stories of fake history we teach kids...I love the basik kore prinsiples of this kountry.  Anyone kan do as they please as long as they respekt the same rights of other people and anyone kan be what they want as long as they work their asses off to do it.

Besides that whole point of myself...isn't anyone else bored??  I'm so sik of everything being so stagnant.  There are no huge natural desasters taking out half of the world in a single swoop, there's no outbreak of zombies, there's nothing changing...the major players in the way the world works are getting more kurrupt and nothing is happening to change it...it's all so boring.  It seriously makes me sik to my stomach that every day I wake up knowing that nothing is going to change on a world-wide impakt level.  There hasn't been a real revolution in how long people??  It's time that something worth mentioning aktually happens...

That's just my opinion, I kould be wrong...

So, as most of you probably know, I've been wanting to go to truk driving school for a whiles now...I wanted to wait till I had the money to just pay for it all myself...but with rent and other bills...it's looking like it's gonna take too mutch time and saving and bluk...so I'm gonna look into taking out some loans...

I havn't been at this new job...and I'm already tired of it...I don't want to be here, or at any other drafting job...I should've thought about it last month...but I guess I was just dumb...I have about enuff money to kover me for Desember & January bills...and if I took klasses now, I kould possibly start working a job in January...but that's kutting it a little klose konsiddering x-mas presents and then February's bills...

So I'm thinkin maybe stay here a few weeks, save up some money, get everyone some good x-mas gifts and what-not, start driving school in January, and then I'll be set on money for bills till the end of March if need-be...

I'm gonna look into it tonight and try to figure it all out...I'll let you know what I kome up with...any ideas or komments would be appresiated!!"

I don't really know what to say...just feeling quite alone yet not wanting to be un-alone...so I go bak to my old vises...Lj is the only one I havn't given up on...which is good kus as far as I know, Lj hasn't been the major kause of any kind of kanser and won't be detekted on a test involving bodily fluids...

I'm moving in a week or two...don't know where yet, but I guess finding a pikking the plase is the easy part.  I kan't wait...having a roommate again is just what the dr. ordered...espessially one I know that isn't gonna skrew me over.

I'm slowly but surely changing things about myself...I want to bekome a better, healier and stronger person.  I've quit smoking, started eating better, going to the gym more...I want to lose weight and be a better version of myself.

I don't know, I guess that's all that's really going on...it's so funny to me how different I bekome yet still staying the same...it makes me question choises and the past in general...but what's it matter when I'm here now??"

I'd make it storm like a winds you've never seen before

I spread the wings of time and watch it kruble away today
if we kould watch it together dekay

What have you done for me lately??

I built a snowman for you
so we kould watch it melt all summer long
in front of me
and endlessly
I kouldn't kure your soul

and when you said enlighten me
I thought I had
and now that you understand
one hand washes the other
there's nothing more to diskover...

what have you done for me lately??
Tell me...

It's been a while...but this is all I kan really remember...lol  so here you go...

Last week was definately my week, no question about it!!  I found a pak of smokes, won $40 at poker, and got $10 free gas do to kasheer error!!  I know it doesn't sound like mutch, but when you don't have any $, that's a damn good week...lol

I also started my new job...and it's still rokkin pretty hard!!  I'm designing plots of land for land-fills and stuff like that.  It's a different field, but it's pretty kew to say the least.  I work with some kew people, and they all seem to like me a lots...it's taking a little whiles to get used to it, but they're patiant and think I'm doing a great job...so I'm diggin it.

I'm sad to say that this week hasn't treated me as well as the last.  I found out Sunday morning that my Great Aunt Helen (she's the one I alwayse tell the ""Breakfast of Champions"" joke about) went in for surgery last week, and while they were in there, the doktors found that she has a verry x-tream kase of ovarian kanser.  They say that it isn't treatable and she doesn't have too long to live bekus of it.  She's only in her early 60's and seems like she's so full of life...of kourse she doesn't live/eat/drink/smoke healthy...so we were planning on going to see her this weekend...but I still don't know what's going on at all.

I'm really x-sited that I'm getting paid...I think I might only be getting paid for one week (which will just squeese me by for rent)...but then two weeks from monday I'll be getting three weeks worth...which will even things out and aktually save me $100 in the long run...but the point of the matter is that I'll aktually have $ again...no more worrying about playing katch-up and skrapping for bills...no more not being able to throw $ around for a night out on the town or having to chek my balanse to see if I kan afford something...it's time onse again to be able to live large and rok hard!!

That reminds me...I havn't been doing that mutch living lately...I really would like to...go out try some new stuff or maybe find a new hobby...or maybe pik up some old stuff...I don't know...just something to spend time on...so if anyone has any suggestions what-so-ever, I'm all ears!!

Then there's the ""L"" department...how I ""L"" and hate it so...and how I ""L"" that to hate it as well...I don't want to be alone any more...I'm sik of laying down in an empty bed and watching people pass me by bekus they know I'm here...it makes me wonder why I still am.

Well I think that's deep and long enuff for now...maybe I'll have something less to say later..."

I've surpress and over looked my feelings for far too long.  Wether it be to try to make the best of things, or to try to help out in ways that I kan't even begin to deskribe.  And bekus of it, I've realized that I've been betraying myself.

I'm at the worst point in my life right now...I'm living in a house that smells, bekus the fridge defrosted, bekus the power has been out at our apartment for over a week now...and it's not that we don't have $ for the power...well...we don't...but hopefully we will tomarro...it's the fakt that we waited till they shut it off to aktually register an akount with them...so this whole time has been them doing bakground cheks...and we're not sure how mutch longer it will be.  So that's what I kome home to at the end of the day...a stinky apartment that I have to skurry around thru to find a lighter in the dark, until I kan light a kandle, and after that, the only thing that I kan look forward to is a sigarette and a komfortable bed.

And before getting home, I'm surrounded with a life that has been so full of drama that's between most of the only people I'm friends with, that it makes me hard to live.  By staying true and helping one the others feel as if I'm betraying them.  So what do I do??  Tell me??  Do I be a friend or do I just go ahead and tell everyone to go fuk themselves??  How kan you tell someone you love to go fuk themselves??!!

Then I go and do something that's just down-right STUPID!!!!  Nothing but pure stupidity.  And it's something that makes me feel like shit, and if it's something that proves me ""untrustworthy"" after all of everything that I have put myself into...then so be it, I live and learn...appresiated or not, I'm living and I learn...and now the only thing I kan do is sit bak and re-assess all of what I've been thru and the way people have shown themselves to me, and kome to the realizations of who these people really are, and the way I feel about them and everything else...

Then there is another situation on top of that...and I really don't want to go into it right now, bekus I've already started talking about it onse today, and probably will again later on...and now's just not the time...but it's there.

So in konklusion...things have been more than stressful as of late...I just want it all to go away...I need to be happy again...I just need to realize how to do it..."

So where do I start in an update to my life??  I believe that my state of being is summed up into ""(somewhat)kontent in routine"".

I love my new konstruktion job!!  Every day I learn something new, the visible results of our work are soooo awasome that it hurts, and I think I'm bekomming stronger from all the manual labor while hopefully, slowly losing some mutch needed pounds...it's really not notisable yet...but I kan feel it.  We usually get home any time between 6-8 at night...which kindda blows for after-wards plans...but I don't really kare all that mutch...lol  It's bekome ""hanging out with a purpose"", bekus every day I'm with 3 awasome guys that are really good friends of mine, and while we do good and hard work, we have some good fun at the same time!!  Last week we all listened to the 6th Harry Potter togeather!!  How kew is that??!!

Moving on...the only konsistansy for after work aktivities would be poker!!  We play every Tuesday and Thursday.  I usually lose about $20-$40 a night...but I play to have fun rather than to win...although last thursday I won $70!!  So that rokked!!

Other than that...it's all pretty mutch hanging out, watching movies and relaxing with the people I love.

On a random note...yesterday I heard someone say ""you kan't have your kake and eat it too..."" and that's when I realized that there is a mutch better quote to be said...in a situation arized where someone went off and did something that seemed like a good idea to them, even tho you know they'd regret it (sort of an ""I told you so"" kindda deal)...and then they ask you to help them get out of it or something to that affekt...if you think they should rot in their desision, just say, ""well...you kan go ahead and have your kake...and while you're at it, why don't you just EAT IT!!!!"" I kan't wait to use that one!!  Going to be sooooo mutch fun!!!

So as you kan tell...I'm still going even more insane/retarded...but I think I'm alright with that!!  I guess that's really all...I'm happy with almost all aspekts of my life right now...I miss some people I havn't seen in quite some time...I'm somewhat getting in kontakt with some of them...so hopefully I'll have a chanse to see them sometime soon...

Well...looks like time to leave...probably won't be home till 8:30 tonight...just enuff to take a shower and get ready for Heartland...I love you and miss you all!!  Hopefully we'll get internet soon!!"

Tonight was the System of a Down show!!  It was soooo awasome!!  An hour andda half of just them playing at the Metro...too good!!  I was worried that they weren't going to play to ""Suggestions"", and it turned out to be the 3rd song, lol  I was really happy to say the least!!  

I went with Kowboy, Ramon, Samm, Deven, Jonesy, Brad, Ben, Ryno, Nikky, and this girl whos name I kan never remember...lol  We all started off in a group, and then the musik started and we were skattered to the krowd.  I wound up getting pretty damn klose to the stage, and squished in nise and tight with everyone...lol  Then some small ass dude was krowd surfing around by me and totally landed right on my head, making my nek twist way out of the right way and krak about a billion times...that's soooo gonna hurt in the morning!!  After that, I got knoked into land of the giants, and just desided to retire to the bak of the floor.  I was there for about 10 minutes, thinking I was just chillin by myself...then I look to my right, and I see Deven chillin there, and then I turn to my left and Nikky is standing right next to me the whole time...lol  Oh...Nikky is this chik that Ryno has been seeing for a lil while now, we were talking a bunch while we were waiting for tikits this past Sunday and she's aktually pretty kew.

Anywayse, I chilled over by them the rest of the show...it was really a fun time to say the least.

This Saturday I'm going to go see Nine Inch Nails with Mr. Pink...should be an awasome show!!  The new lineup for the band inkludes Jordy White aka Twiggy from Marilyn Manson...and this will be the third time I'm seeing him in a different band, Manson, A Perfekt Sirkle, and now NIN...he's a great song writer, so the new album should be pretty good too.

On a sadder not, we got a letter the other day from our land-lord...it said about how our lease will be up at the end of the month...and we will not be asked to renew our lease for another year...so by the end of the month, we're out of here.  It suks, but what kan you do??  So I'm going down to the apartment people after I get off of work tomarro...hopefully I'll find something good around the same neighborhood.  Part of me wants to move just for the change of senery, but part of me wants to stay...mostly bekus of lazyness and the lokation.  I really need to stay around here bekus of the whole using my parents kar and what-not...so we'll see.

This post is so weird...the momentum is waaaay off than usually...my brain is just still rattling around inside my head...so ya...I'm going to bed..."

So I'm going to just let my krap spew out here bekus I wanna say it but I don't really think anyone kares to hear it...so you kan all just stop reading now.

So...I've bekome pretty depressed as of late.  I've just been plagued by the realization that I have no ambition or goals any more.  I'm not really aspiring to be anything more than I am.  I'm not looking for a new girlfriend nor do I want to...and not bekus I'm pikky or too depressed about the breakup...I just don't think I want to be with anyone right now...I think I might need to be alone for a while to try to figure out what I want out of life.

My job is going quite well...I've kome up with a new method of getting thru the day...it's kalled not slakking off...and it's going surprizingly well!!  Everyone thinks I'm doing a good job, and the day passes like nobody's business!!

My newest hobby has bekome what I like to kall half day annorexia.  I wait as long as I kan before I eat...I kan usually make it till around 7pm...which is around 12 hours.  It's the weirdest feeling to just bekome so hungery and forse yourself to not eat...you kan aktually feel your body feeding on itself...your stomak starts to hurt for about 10 minutes...and then it gets this bizzar draining feel to it...and then you feel refreshed and replenished again...I think it's the reason I've been able to not feel tired at all durring work.  I know it's a weird thing to do...but it's bekome something to do, and I just really don't kare about worrying about it any more...so ya...lol

I'm thinking about kreating an imaginary friend that I kan talk to bekus I just don't feel komfortable talking to anyone else about anything serious any more.  It's just too weird for me, and I know that no-one wants to hear it, so what's the use in making someone listen to it??  I'm not insane tho...I'm not going to make up an imaginary friend bekus they're only an x-tention of one's self, and lord knows I don't want to hear about my shit.  But the one thing that I truely hate are the ones that just flat out lie about it...lol...it's the funniest thing too if you look at it from my point of view...seriously, I wish you kould see it from my point of view...it's hillarious!!  Every time it's the, ""Oh ya, go ahead, I'm here for you...but oh...not right now...I have to go...but we'll talk more about it later"" when later's somewhere around a week or so later with un-resieved phone kalls or un-responded text messeges...oh, and then there's the, ""I totally get that, it's like me with (and then a totally different subjekt that fokus's on them instead and has absolutely nothing to do with what you were talking about)""  I just wish there was someone else out there that aktually lived my life with me...it would just make things so mutch easier...just to have someone else that gets this drift...and I so wish that everyone would just get the balls to (when I start talking about my problems) just tell me ""Tuffy, shut the fuk up"" it'd just be refreshing every onse andda while.

On all of that note...I've realized that I don't have a best friend any more...(just to let you all know, that's not sposed to be a shot at anyone or a de-friending or anything all full of drama like that) it's just a fakt...I've kome to terms that before I kouldn't deside on who my best friend was...and now I know that it's no one.  I don't share enuff time and emotion or even do enuff stuff with anyone else to be able to kall them their best friends...and I would be verry surprized if anyone told me that I was theirs...seriously...my fone ain't ringing off the hook here...or pretty mutch at all for that matter...lol

I really don't know why I'm saying all of this...I'm not sure that I really kare about it at all...but I guess I must or else why would this krap be on my mind??  Alright...I think I'm done...ya...that's an ending."

Life is so odd right now...I truely don't know what I want.  Everything going thru my head is jumbled up into one big loose knot that doesn't want to be tightened or kome undone.  I guess it feels like I'm in the intermission part of my life...and every minute I wonder if it's more like the beginning of the end of it instead.  

I know I'm only almost 23 years old...but it seems like I've been thru 10 life-times already...and I alwayse wonder which one I will be the one that will stay with me for the rest of my eternity...and I don't know...I just don't think I want to roam around for the rest of my life wondering what it is that I want and need out of life...


P.S. I'm really happy that my friend Samm has been hanging out with us all the time now which is really great bekus I get some mutch needed girlie stuff time...not to mention that she's just an amazing person, and I'm just glad to see that she's finally kome around after these years!!"

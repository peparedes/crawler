I find it so odd that I am making such a big deal out of this, but I guess Ive been holding all my issues inside that I just got built up. You could say Im being dumb, but I find if you knew exactly what I was going through you would say somehting different."

"event","my mom is so fucking annoying. the stupid woamn thinks that im tlaking back to her oh please, she doesnt know when to shut the hell up! and she says that when i talk like that to her she wants to slap me across the face, how does she think i feel when i hear her voice every five seconds of my life. AND OOHHHHH MYYY!!!!!! i just love the way she blames the computer for my actions, the woman can not fathom that the cause of my anger is her. like GGGEEEEZZZZZ i just want to slap her across the face and tape her mouth shut so that i wont have to hear her talk anymore. and she talks like she has something over me, she has nothing over me other than shes my mother.and she tells me to go upstairs because she doesnt want to see me, THEN WHY THE HELL DID SHE FUCKING MAKE ME?!?!?! if she didnt want a daughter then she souldnt have gotten herself pregnet 14 years ago. and if she didnt want a daughter that answered back at her then she shouldnt have been so annoying and so bitcy over the past few years. THAT WOULVE MADE A DIFFERNCE!!!!!!<b>i fucking hate this woman with a passion</b>GOSSSHSHHHH she can never shut up!!!!and she thinks that shes soo good as a mother PSSSH thats an over exageration!!!! its not my fault that her husband thinks that shes an annoying little bitch. YEAH i think that too. and its not my fault that she thinks her husband is cheating on her. GEEEZ just because everything is going wrong in her life doesnt mean that she has to mess up mine. sometimes id just un away from home if it wasnt for the shit that they give me. like food and shelter. but if she really pisses me off im out of this house. i dont really care if imma be a street kid ill just go to school and not live with her. or maybe i can go to the sates for college or university. maybe by then hse will realise how aggrevating she really is. or maybe i should just be a psychologist like i planned and make a book just for women like her. i should title it <i>shut the hell up because we dont really care</i> GGGGGEEZZZ i wish i could just shut her up for at least an hour. i kinda like it when shes made at me. when shes made at me she doesnt like looking at me because she knows that i can call her out on all her shit. and because she wont talk to me*ohhh my gosh i can still her that woman* her voice keeps on going on like an annoying song!!!!!UUUUHH!!!! and i hate the way that after  MY DAD{yes my dad} tells her to appologize she tries to friend me up. <b> if im mad at you dont try to friend me up, it'll just back fire</b> UHHHHH!!!!! now im so fucking pissed its not even funny. i was going to write about something happy but the sound of her voice just drains all the happiness from me.

"event","well '07 have recently arrived and suddenly im feeling different about some people. i dont really know why though, all of a sudden as i talk and spend more time woth these people i find myself wanting to slap them across the face for being so annoying and incompatant. but i hope it will pass i really used to like this person and we are really close. but if this person wasnt so damn annoying the maybe it would be easier. its just how im feeling at the moment though. i dont think that this will carry on much longer. at least i hope so :S i just gotta take it step by step i guess. 

DUUDEE!!! <i> she </i> got straight bangs the one day i dont put my bangs like that she gets a new hair cut. man im not mad at her im just wondering what will happen when im not lazy to put my bangs back again, she knows i got them first though. but its ok becuase we're cool. but still she got straight bangs :( i should just shave my head so that people can copy that :(

boys are so confusing these days, one minuet they could be feeling you and the next the are feeling some other chick. GEEEZZZ! when will the madness stop?! is there no end to male complexity?!!!! im so confused about boys right now. a couple of them i dont know if they like me or if they are just being nicesoo confusing. and most of them flirt with you too making you think something could happen. BUUUUTT NOOOOO!!!!!they next thing you know they'll be doing that to some other chick (N) and yet we always fall for it. there are plenty of good guys out there but they are either taken or we cant find them yet. the one good guy that ive found is my bestfriend. big ups for me making a amazing guy in every way shape and form into my bestfriend, then falling completely for him then getting rejected for him. one of his best quailities made him not like me...the fact that hes such a good friend to his boys. MAN!!!!!but at least i know where his priorities stand. but its still so hard seeing him like four days a week always looking soooooo good *BITES LIP* oh i dont know and i hate how girls are always putting him down. i wouldnt do that he knows that. i told him so. he knows that i have his back and that im there for him no matter what. 

im glad that we are bestfriends still. i think that the both of us are way too mature for something like that to ruin a perfectly good friendship. thats what i like about him, hes knows how to tak to me and he knows how to react with me. DUDE! HES SO PERFECT!!!!! i need to find some flaws to make me stop liking him so much :("

"event","well yesterday my parents and i went to fairview mall. my dad said that i could spend twenty dollars. so im ok fine its after boxing week so its ok. tell me why everywhere i went it was a sale for that store but not for me. an extra 50% off GUESS? jeans is a sale, but not for my dadwhen it comes to 50$. so then i go to AE, it was pretty good there were sales all around but nothing came up to 20$. so then i go to ARITZIA, i find a nice black TNA scarf that ive been wanting since time. i figure that its on sale since everything else in the store is. so i asked the lady how much it was since it didnt have a tag. after the longest time it was 28$. so instead i buy TALULA mittens and a TNA toque. when we are about to leave we realise that the lady wanted the scarf for herself so she raised the price so we wouldnt buy it. PSSSSHHH!!! but its ok ill get that scarf soon times when i have money.

when i went to ARITZIA to look for something to buy i saw signs that said 20-40% off, so i figured that it was a good sale. NO REALLY! i say this relly nice TNA sweater original price was 85$ slae price 80$. dude thats no really a sale when it comes to the price. my mittens were like 2$ off. which is ok seeing how they only costed 10$ in the end. but still 5$ off is not really a sale. but i love that store stil. i just have to save major dollars for my shopping spree.

i have a finalized list of things that i would like to buy when i have the money:
-black TNA scarf{ARITZIA}
-grey TNA sweater{ARITZIA}
-white TNA polo{ARITZIA}
-grey TALULA jacket{ARITZIA}
-black GUESS? skinny jeans{GUESS?}
-cream AE jogging pants{AMERICAN EAGLE}
-navy AE sweater{AMERICAN EAGLE}
-black steeletos{ALDO}
-beige ABERCROMBIE sweater{ABERCROMBIE&FITCH}
-black CHUCKS with suede design{ANY SHOES STORE}
yeap thats my list and i think that over the year it will grow larger and even more pricey.

but today is ok though im just sitting and relaxing for the last few days of vaction, nothing special really. i just need to save up money qucik times for all of thoe things that i would like to buy."

"event","wow i saw <i>rocky</i> and tell me why it was one of the biggest wastes of my life?! i actually like boxing and boxing movies like <i>against the ropes</i> and <i>million dollar baby</i>. but whoa to me it was way too over dramatic for me. my dad said that all of the rocky movies are like that. the only good part of the whole movie was the actual match, which they didnt show all 10 rounds{which would've been much more interesting} but hey what can you go. but im not going to put down silvester stilon{did i spell it right?} because hes been doing a really good job writing and directing and acting in all films. 

after i told <i>him</i> about howi felt i feel that we've just become closer. we are telling each other more things and we are larning about one another. plus he helps me a lot. its nice to have a guy friend that i trust so much. not that i dont trust my other guy friends or anything, its just for whatever reason i feel so beyond comfortable with him. but im not going to be all soft towards guys now, no im still keeping my guard way up. especially when it comes to him. i always find myself wanting to be with him. hes a really good guy, i know that has no meaning anymore but he is. i hope he can get past what he thinks girls think about him. and i also shun the girls that think less of him, for putting him down like that. for all of thosegirls that did that to him they can go <b>SUCK MY TOE</b>. he been hurt enough already from what he has told me, hes trying to keep up his image as everyone seems to do these days but when we talk i know whats really going on. we're that close, and to think we've only knew each other for a few months and i care so deeply about him in this way.

and im not the only helping out in this friendship, he helps me a lot too. when i am feeling down he helps me cope with things. and he also gives me great advicce. he also know when to make me laugh and how to make me laugh. <u>to think, we're just friends...</u>"

"event","well seeing how this is the first post of '07 i feel that i need to look back on the past year... last year was full of pointless drama and what not but what year doesnt have drama. but i learned a lot from it and i coped with it surprisingly well. i learned how to choose friends and how to keep them. i also learned about <b>boys</b> mind you i didnt really master the complex minds of the opposite gender but i still learned none the less. i recently learned about not really takng them seriously anymore seeing how they never really take us females seriously anyways. i also learned to keep my guard WAY up when trying to persue a relationship with them... saves you from some major pain and sorrow. yupp <u>'06 was the year of learning</u> for me.

it was also a year of changes, but what year isnt. my tastes in music, fashion and my out look on things has changed through out the past year. impressive infact (Y)

but enough pondering on the past and lets look at the present for a quick sec. the new years party was LIVEEEE!!! it ws so much fun with all the youth singing and jumping up and down to the music. more fun than expected form a church event. it was so cool seeing everyone let loose for once. just goofing off in the spure f the moment. i was pretty crazy too running around the whole gym. even the adults let loose dancing with us ;p 

lets see what im looking forward to this year.... hopefully more experinces to look back on in the furture and tons for fun. maybe just a little drama even though i think its immature but sometime drama cna help you learn more about yourself. <i> no room for a man though</i>id rather not but if the right person comes by then for sure ill know it. but im not really looking for anything at the moment, ill wait for my time :D"

but its ok. at least i know where he stands in our friendship(Y)im not going to ask him for a chance, mainly because i wouldnt give a chance to anyone in the first place. i would rather have a guy that likes me as much as i like him than a guy thats giving me a chance to <u>check</u> if he feels something too. when you meet a guy that likes you there shouldnt be any chances needed he should like you completely from the start and nothing more. 

<b>boys are like chocolate</b> i know that i should've started with this explaination but i felt an intro to the reason why i came to this conclusion was needed. see there are those really good chocolates that always make you happy and make you feel good no matter what situation{<i>ferrero roche</i>}and then there are those other chocolates that are cheap and make you wanna throw-up{<i>those liquor chocolates;p</i>} see boys are like chocolate. i just hope i meet a guy that is like <b>toblerone&ferrero roche</b> a guy that gives me pure joy!

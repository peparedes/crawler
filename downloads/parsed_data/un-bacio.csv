"event","So I thought things were on their way to being smoothed out.
But then it turns out that they're not.
He said that he knows we're not going to work out right now, but then he still pushes to stay together.
And it's good, and it's fun, and I care about him...... but I don't know how to explain that it just doesn't work generally.
But who knows, I don't know.
What if I get my head sorted out and he is what I want and I fuck it up? Or that could just tell me even more so that it's wrong right now and it's not what&nbsp; I should be doing right now.
And he had to withdraw this semester because of everything..... and I don't know.
It's so stressful for everyone right now, and it's my fault for bringing it up again, but I think it's going to work and then it just doesn't seem like it wants to, and that's what I don't understand.
And thinking about someone else never helps. Especially if that's a dead end road.
I just know that if Ryan and I get back together, it's for life.... and that's terrifying, and I am not ready for that kind of committment. And&nbsp;I think if our relationship was just a relationship without all the strings of forever attached to it.... it would be much less threatening.



Uggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh



I just want to get belligerant and scream Alanis Morisette until I vomit.
Oh wait.
That was what I did last weekend."

"event","<p>And then life goes all crazy again. <br />I said it was over and done. <br />But then, I have someone over, he gets all jealous, and then is even more attached to me than he was before. <br />And it's confusing. <br />You don't act like that with people you're just friends with. Or maybe you do. Maybe he likes that about me, that that's the kind of relationship we have with nothing attached to it. <br />But it's driving me crazy. <br />And I'm really not sure how to respond to last night at all. <br /><br /><strong>Later that day....<br /></strong>So instead of being productive at all, I cleaned the room. I guess productive in some way, but not anywhere near the level of productivity I need to reach with my reading.<br />But it killed an hour and a half of not obsessing over stupid things.<br /></p>
<p>Oh Cait.. I wish you were here to talk to, our situations are so similar right now.<br /></p>"

Which is fine. I was really into it before, and then this week happened, and I've been completely disinterested in everything except not being here right now.<br />But it's fine. It's going smoothly. I have to go back to Cushing at 2:00 and hopefully I'll be done by 4:00 or 5:00 or maybe even earlier. The shots all seem to be really small. And Rahn overestimates time.<br /><br />Maybe next weekend.<br />I'll put the gas money forward. I'll wait up for him to get back from work.<br />I just want to spend some time with him and feel good for a little while. Like Caitlin and I were saying the other night, someone who doesn't make me feel like shit whenever I hang out with them.<br />I want to be in someone's bed who actually wants <em>me</em> in the bed with them.<br />I read back in Ry's xanga and just cried during all of the entries pertaining to our break-up. And I really don't know why I'm such an asshole. And then I texted him. And I can tell that he's beginning to let me back in a bit. Little by little.&nbsp;<br />Oh no, I can't leave next weekend because it's a fucking closed weekend for the costume shop and I have to work.<br />He has the week off, maybe he can come down like Sunday-Tuesday or something.... have him here for a few days during the week, that would be even nicer.<br /><br />Ughhhhh.<br /><br /><br />Ooooo just got off the phone with him.<br />If he finds his cell phone, he'll come visit me...."

...you fall in to places where you've never been (can't believe i still remember that from WVCA speech meet lol)

So I went to Valley Book & Bible to preorder ""Nothing is Sound"" by Switchfoot, and I came out with some books on prayer and a bio on Martin Luther (which is really good).  I've also been reading a bio on Gutenberg, which has been very interesting as well.

Also traversed to Sam Ash, and tried various instruments.  I was also intending to buy a music book fork, but I couldn't find a nice one, so I returned to VB&B to order one from the catalog.  It has the treble clef that's the 'J' in Jesus, like the necklace I have.

I can't wait to see everyone tomorrow!"

"event","So I'm reading my mom's old Bible, which has markings EVERYWHERE.  Whenever she found something she liked, she would star/ underline/ circle/ box/ highlight...etc it SUPERFLUOUSLY.  lol.

I'm really liking the book of James, cuz he says it the way it is.  1:22-25 stuck out to me as a call to action- a call to really obey the Word and not just hear it.

On a different note (pardon the pun), I'm really excited for the new Switchfoot CD coming out on September 13th!!!

1. Reply with your name and I will write something random about you.
2. I will say something that only makes sense to you and me.
3. I will then tell you what song/movie reminds me of you.
4. I will tell you my first memory of you.
5. I will tell you what animal you remind me of.

It's not too far from home, and it's a good class size in a room with uncomfortable chairs and lots of Canadian videoes.  People seem to be relatively nice, tho.

Boring?  Perhaps, but at least I got a good laugh.

All of a sudden, this ""tall guy"" (TG) sits next to me (there were plenty of other seats), and his friend sat next to him.  I was busy reading Fitzgerald, so I didn't pay too much attention.  He was making various kinds of smalltalk while I was trying to read, but at the break, people were playing games and stuff.  He asked me to play and I was bored out of my mind, so I'm like yeah, sure...

TG:  So how old are you, anyway?
me:  How old are you?
TG:  15 and a 1/2  (He looked older than that, though)
*I was trying not to bust up at this point*
his friend:  No you're not! *poke*
TG:  OK, I'm <i>almost</i> 15 and 1/2
*I'm really really trying not to bust up at this point*
TG:  How old are you?
me:  --

So I told him, and I could barely keep a stright face.  His look was priceless...

So this morning I went to my philosophy class at Pierce.  I've made lots of friends there, including one girl who's in her second year at UC Berkley and another girl who goes to El Camino HS.  It's a lively group, and it's been a good experience for me.  I can't wait to get my score back from the essay we wrote.  We had to compare two philosohpers' views with a movie and extrapolate and stuff.

Then I got ready to go to Mountasia with some peeps from our youth group.  Liz, Karen, Kim, Laurel and I rode in Patrick's car.  We're soooo loud!  lol.  We had such a great time laser tagging, bumper boating, DDR-ing, and chatting the time away.

Oh, before I left for Mountasia, my long-awaited AP scores arrived.  (well, minus the computer one, cuz I took that later)  =) =)
I thank God for sustaining me through the past school year

I really want to go to Boston and see Harvard, cuz they sent me this invitation to apply...the pictures in the brochure were absolutely beautiful!

Well, off to catch some z's before school tomorrow!  ^^"

Yesterday...
I was in the West LA area when I unexpectedly ran across this THREE-Story BORDER'S.
How awesome is that?
I was browsing each section (and their selection is so much better than that of Canoga Park or Northridge),
and it was like a treasure hunt for me!
But sadly,
time flies when you're having fun, and time flew away.
It flew out the window and I couldn't catch it,

"event","""But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith. More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised. For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either. And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost. If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are to be pitied more than all men. 
But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.""

"event","I was inspired by my pastor's sermon this morning...

Have you ever thought what Jesus had to go through to take on the sins of the world?

Have you ever thought went through His mind?

Jesus was quite alone in his mission.

An outline for those who don't want to read the whole thing:  :)<br>
Jesus...
1)had a mission no one else understood<br>
2)a sorrow no one else could share<br>
3)a cup no one else could drink<br>
4)understands our loneliness<br>
5)suffered, died, and rose again to remove the greatest cause of our loneliness<br><br>

<lj-cut text=""Sharing""> 
<b>1)  He had a mission no one else understood.</b>
He tried so many times to tell the disciples that He would be betrayed
and killed by sinful men.  Jesus told them so many times that He would
go to Jerusalem and be killed.  They didn't understand.

Peter even dared rebuke his Master, saying, ""Never, Lord!  This shall never happen to you!""  This is how Jesus responded:  Mat 16:23 ""Jesus turned and said to Peter, ""Get behind me, Satan!  You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men.""

When He said this, think about how Jesus must have felt.
His disciples, who left their former lives to follow Him, and even Peter,
one of the ""inner three"" didn't understand what Jesus' mission was.

Also, in Mat 21:9, ""The crowds went ahead of him and those that followed shouted,
""Hosanna to the Son of David!  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!""
Have you ever felt lonely in a crowd?  The crowd is cheering and going crazy,
yet Jesus knows that these same people would turn on Him in a few days.
No one understood His mission.  When they looked at Him, they saw a King,
when, in fact, He came to suffer and be a servant, a ransom for many.

<b>2) A sorrow no one else could share</b>
Luke 19:41-42 says, ""As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it and said, ""If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace- but now it is hidden from your eyes.""

Mat 26:37 ""He took Peter nd the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled.""

Jesus was a man of many sorrows.  He looked out at the world around Him,
the world which He came to save, the world which would torture and kill Him.
And He knew that even though the inner three maybe didn't understand His mission,
maybe they could keep Him company in some of His last hours.  But they failed Him.
They couldn't keep awake just to pray with Him.

<b>3)  A cup no one else could drink</b>
Mat 26:56 ""Then all the disciples deserted Him and fled.""
No one stuck around to share in His sufferings.
Not only that, but they couldn't have, even if they tried.
For a time, the full wrath of God was against Jesus.  For all His life, Jesus felt the Father's presence, knew the Father's voice, but Jesus, on the cross, received the brunt of God's fullest punishment and experienced spiritual anguish- the anguish meant for us.
Only Jesus could do this- only He could be our perfect offering, the One Propitiation that would save the world.  Imagine the responsibility.  Imagine the spiritual pain.
Mat 27:46 ""My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?""


What does this mean for us?
<b>1)  He understands our loneliness</b>
heb 2:10 ""In bringing many sons to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering.""
There is nothing we can go through in this life that Jesus hasn't already gone through.
He knows exactly how we feel in every circumstance; he's been there before, and He'll be with us.

<b>2)  He suffered, died, and rose again to remove the greatest cause of our loneliness</b>
Man was created to have fellowship with God.  A life without God is meaningless and lonely.  Sure, someone could deny it for awhile, but deep down, everyone needs God whether they admit it or not.  Jesus wasn't only separated from God, He experienced pure seperation from the Father- God's holy righteousness couldn't look upon the sin Jesus took upon himself.  All of God's wrath was focused on Jesus while He was on the cross.  That was supposed to be for us.

For this I am thankful to be a child of God.  Thank you, Lord Jesus.</lj-cut>"

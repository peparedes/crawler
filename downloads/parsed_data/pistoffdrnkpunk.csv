"event","Summer, I painted a scene that lit the stars for me. Said ""I can erase it for you dear."" That summer created those words that came to life in three. They were denied by you. Summer I laid down below a glitter adorned night and silently sparkled my own way. Summer I laid down by you and shared my frail light. You gave the dark to me. I looked inside to find the one I sent away. I nearly froze when I stepped inside to find the flowers turned to gray. I closed my eyes and kissed them one lest time. I wanted this excoriation. I thrive on this self mutilation. Summer, a morning so pale, alone when they found me. As I remained sleeping I heard them say ""This summer created a boy of abject misery."" He was designed by you. So like a lost child I will hide, and like a lost lie I will find a way to return to the one who made me. Cover your eyes and we'll die together. Will you cry for me? Will you cry for me, or will you cry with me? I've been a lonely one. I've had this whole world drained from me. Am I the only one? I've had this world drained from me. Summer, I painted a scene that lit the stars for me. Said ""I can erase it for you dear."""

"event","we fight like we're together, but when we're physically together, we act like we're sisters. im alright with it. don't reach for her hand or nothing n e more. it's getting easier. 

wednesday when i got home from school, i had to plead with her so she'd go to the Oxford St. lighting stuff. i had to explain my reaction and try to make sumthing clear to her... fuck what i think. she chooses when she wants to take my feelings into consideration and when she just doesnt mind shit i say. it's fine. if anything, NOW is the time to not care. who fuckn cares what i say or think, or how i react. we're friends. that's it. friends just... you do whatever the fuck you want to do and friends that hold you back are just jealous. i was jealous... she doesn't even care about lights or christmas... i do. that was what it was all about. that was it. sooo i told her to stop being a brat and go to the fucking lighting show! she started crying and i couldnt understand why. i still don't know why she cried. i made her feel bad for wanting to go in the first place, ok i get that. but i apologized and watever... its her fucking life, i just happen to pop in n out here n there. she needs to stop worrying about me. shit that's what's gonna fuck her up in her next relationship. she always had to protect la huera. she felt bad she left and hurt the broad or watever. im not like that... i dont need nor do i want that pitty. its gay. 

valencia was nice. it was a chill place, nice people, really easy to get around the city and nothing was super expensive. the beach was sweet. felt like home. the weather... ay guey... amazing. simply perfect. couldn't have asked for more. she had her bratty moments... i had my cold ones. i can help it, but i dont have to pretend n e more. it doesnt hurt that she doesnt reach for my hand. i even wonder why she pulls me in sometimes. i couldnt get why she wanted to sleep in the same twin bed when i had my own. i guess she rally was scared. i dunno.

i remember having 2 dreams on saturday night/sun morning. both wer about me n her. one... was her calling me tellin me that wat's her face was spending the night, and she wanted to know if it was ok if they shared a bed. i sed no. she asked why not... i dunno how the rest of it went or how it even began.

the other dream... i remembered it when i woke up. had something to do with her being okay and walking away from me. walking towards someone else. i told her i was FINE as long as it wasn't wat's her face. i don't remember whether it was or wasnt. i meant to write it down right away, but i got caught up and i was just a bit disoriented. we had to get ready and take of to the airport. 

sooo im back in school and back to my routine. i have friends... i have homework... and i have the piece of shit internet. why does she insist we talk all the time. i think if she didn't id be a lil sad, but it MAKES SENSE. all this up n down, ""i love you"" but i don't want you stuff... tellin me how im perfect and im beautiful and super sexy and all this crap... i tell her not to. i just disregard it because it's not what matters to me. i don't care if someone thinks im cute or not or watever. i could care less. where's it gonna get me in REAL life? nowhere. maybe int he corporate world/work force, it makes a difference. when it comes to friends and love and sacrifice and a relationship, physical appearance only means so much. me vale madre. 

i watched brigid jones' diary the other day... love it.
that's gonna be me when i get back. drinking. imma drink on my own, drink in a group, drink with my uncles. i don't care as long as i get a gooood buzz.
go out with straight people and just enjoy what's left of my youth. i guess now i can concentrate on my ""career"" haha whatever that consists of. oh! and i need a 2nd puppy =) that'll fix all my problems. ill b a workoholic, an alcoholic and get my love from my dogs. so ill have money, a fucked up liver and clothes full of dog hair, but i wont be sad! yesss i have found the solution =)"

"event","i knew there was more than one reason i stopped drinking. i was stuck on the whole blacking out and not remembering anything shit, but i forgot WHY id drink as much as i did. i told everyone... 3 drinks is my limit. well leyla decides to give me a cup with 3 parts vodka and a part of oj... 3 of em. so we ran in the street trying to stop this taxi on the OTHER side of the street lol... got home and went straight to max's for pizza... and its pretty much a mesh of time, everything's kinda blurry. i don't know what the fuck happened or how it happened! right when i think im making progress being away from LA and drama and jacky and being self sufficient and independent, i take 10 steps back by crying to leyla bout how my ""friend"" is my ex gf and how we're not together... lol.... and its over, but its hard for me and i dunno why... and blah,blah blah... what the fuck is wrong with me!!!! 

awww hahaha i was doing pretty well... kinda. ugh shit. that's why i didnt wanna drink too much out here, plus i dont wana end up in the hospital like victoria... tonta. i dont evn remember what i told her. i just member crying and holding it back, but not being able to and she was telling me everything would be okay, and id be okay. she wiped my tears like a really good friend and was very attentive and sweet and just let me talk and cry and it looked like she understood what i was going through. like she was there through the whole thing and she was really concerned with me being okay. it was a shitty but positive moment for me. 

sooo we came home and ate in her room and gossipd bout the people in the house, how guys are jerks sometimes and how we're like sisters. and i told her how people think im a bitch when they see me, but im pretty nice. and exlained the circumstances under which id act like a bitch lol... and she told ME how she thot i was a bitch when she met me haha. and how she was dreading the idea of living down the hall from a bitch. ohh geesus. i doubt she imagined she'd be at a party... drunk... hugging this ""bitch"" all night because we're gonna miss eachother when i leave in december hahaha and calling me her litt-big sister! and eve wants us to go to malasia, and when i go to holland ill visit leyla, and i want them to come to Cali and ill take em everywhere! lol we are funny. all that stuff was good and fun! ohh and i leared how to say fuck off in dutch, and piss off in german, but i forgot the german one =/

"event","tuesday... we went to oceana. i met rachel there and met marina for the first time. i guess leyla and michael are hangin out more haha but leyla has so many options. she gets so much attention, she gets sooo many compliments, she's super sweet... i tell her i hate taking her places or walking with her cuz people stop her left and right and my dumb ass keeps walking. OR, wats worse, i have to get her out of a situation cuz for sum reason these black guys cant get enuf of her haha. we wer on the balcony and VULA from BASEMENT JAX performed. before that, though sum gurls below wer dancing. one kinda lookd like rhianna so as i tried to look closely, her boob popped out of her tube top thing lol... i have magical power, i think. it was a pretty boob. the moment was hilarious! no one saw... no one knew i saw... UNTIL she lookd up and we laughed lol then 2 seconds after she fixed it, it happened again. 

wednesday & thursday i didnt want to go out. i wanted to be home and be warm and lazy. i fuckn hate the walk. it drives me insane! and its bloody cold at times and its hurting my fuckn lungs and im getting sick. i hate this shit. if i want medicine, i gotta walk to go get it! piece of shit. i think i would of loved being here had it been summer... when the weather was still good. i mean, i like it here but my body doesnt. i stayed up and watched chocolat with jax on tv-links. mine didnt have the last section tho... gay. we watched an episode of the L word, then i went to bed cuz i had class early thurs morn. 

so we're friends. just friends. if practiced... imagined she was here with me... and i just practice being JUST her friend. i think im doin pretty well. i put myself in the situation mentally, and act as i would. but i say little things i would want to say if she was here, just to get em outta the way. and after i say em i think ... fuck that was lame... so i feel less inclined to say n e thin wen she does come. i want to be her friend. its not that i dont... well at least for now i do. maybe when we get home i wont want to. im starting to miss her as a friend. starting to talk about her as a friend, that always helps. its not my ex gf that i dont speak about, its one of my closest friends who is in London who i care about and who i do everything with and who supports me... as a friend. 

went out last night. didnt want to but i made myself. im kind of tired of clubs. gurls look for the guys and i get bored. i like pubs... more chill... jusut talk to people and crack up. its funny when people get drunk at a pub, not as trashy. so we went to THE STAGE... older crowd but good music. walked home together and grabbed a pizza from Max's. It's so great to have outgoing flatmates. It helps. I was pretty buzzd last night and i dont remember wat i wrote but im pretty sure it was a friendly messge... not the former ""i miss you. i cant be without you"" bullshit. when did i become such a pussy?! ugh im off to zizzi."

"event","last night i was online with jacky trying to plan our trips. soo we're set for valencia, spain and paris, france. i wanted to go to venice, italy. super nice, small and romantic... well im glad we didnt go cuz i wouldve been disappointed. its a place of love n romance... where hearts melt in the sunset while a violin plays somewhere in the background! yeah... im fucking gay but that's how i picture is. being sure of someone's feelings for you and being sure u love that person enough to share the experience with them. yah i love her, but its not gonna mean the same to her as it would to me so why bother. ill go back... evn alone i dont care. i liked being consumed by romance, ... the thought that it will come my way again and not in the form of a trashy lesbian from LA who's been around a couple dozen blocks, IF u know wat i mean. shit happens and doesnt happen for a reason... ill know why soon enough. so my plan is, spend as little time sleeping as possible. the less time we spend together in the bed, the better my chances to not be affectionate... no joke. haha. shit im screwed. go to sleep late, wake up early. well the rooms have tv's so she's probably be distracted n e way. sooo paris the first week of nov., ... sister comes 2nd weeken-3rd weekend... then first weekend of dec. in paris. then two weeks later, im home!

soooo first day of school...

20min walk to the bus stop. 15 min wait for the bus. i dunno how long the ride took... all i know is i left my flat at 8:05 i got to school at 9:20. i was late for italian, but i made friends tryin to find the same class. some first years... really nice gurl from spain (maria) and this guy from taiwan (wendelle) who somehow spoke amazing english and was fluent in spanish as well. and he's taking an italian class now sooo ... yah he's a freak. saw rusha in my italian class... super nice polish gurl... then saw marina (german) in the cafe while i was talkin to rachel. then met uhhh sum grl ugh i forgot her name... shit i was doing good with names too! well met her in linguistics seminar. and kinda made friends in my ling lecture when i put the seat down to sit and it slammd and shook the gurl next to me so all the grls around laughed =) haha there's a cute lil gurl in my seminar. everyone's straight of course. got outta my last class at 5... jumped on the bus right away. stoppd by the grocery store on the way home... and got here at 6:30. long ass piece of shit day. let's see how much easier it gets as time goes on. at least i know ill be distracted and itll give me the opportunity to ADJUST to my ... what ever its calld... i gues it would be... life. my life."

what am i gonna do. i don't even know ... i... i just miss us so much. it was perfect, she's perfect for me. i just wasn't enough... my love wasn't enough. i can't... i dont even know what to write. i was ok, but today... i dont know what the fuck is wrong with me!!! she hurt me too!!! why do i fuckin want her. my freakin journal is full of entries where i felt betrayed and lied to, but i stuck with her and i wanted to believe her because i wanted to work and i knew that she loved me! and it was just gonna take time!!! and i know i need to leave her alone... and not bug her. but is it love if i leave her alone and let her come around, or is it love if i never give up? =( i dont evn know what the fuck she wants, how will i know wat to do?

she says she doesnt want me to change for her. but that means who i am is an issue. and eventhough im willing to change, she doesnt want me to. but i dont even know what the fuck is wrong with me! maybe wat she wants in someone has changed... and its just not me... im just not it. i can't believe its actually happened. i cant believe its still happening. some broad that i find disposable happened to get between me and jacky. wats fuckd up is, she says everythin that happened this summer... me goin out n all & jess n stuff... that's wat keeps her as well. but that's not fair cuz i didnt think i stood a chance at that point n e more! i cant help but cry cuz i have no control over whats happening. i dont even know what it is! and i talk to her soo superficially now... no sweet words, no cute names. instead when i wana call her baby, i call her buttmunch. and when i wanna tell her i miss her, i tell her i need her round so i dont have to make my own food. she cracks up... she's okay with it... all of it i guess. i wish it was that easy for me. 

i dont tell her i love you n e more. i told her the other day... i love you, and i wont stop saying it until u give me a reason to or u ask me to stop. the next day she told me it couldnt be fixed ne  more. it broke my heart. i can't bring myself to say it... because she means it as a friend and i dont. i can't say it to her. cuz then, this is what happens. i sit crying in my flat on a friday night until 2 sumthin the fuckin mornin... while she's out with friends. i see her in 2 weeks. hope it gets easier by then, cos i wont be able to cry if she's around. unless its while im showering. after we get home... im goin my own way. can't just be her friend. i can't. and im not gonna do it to punish her, if she'd really care, but because i cannot bear to be around her and not be with her. not hold her, not have her. 

we have gone through some really good times. but sum shitty ones. i don't know what imma do. i don't know how im going to do it. maybe it'll become more clear as the term ends. i need a new focus. i need a new... sumthin. i dont feel like myself anymore and i dont think i will be for a while. she made me comfortable to be myself. i gotta work on goin it alone now... shit."

"event","It was pretty sweet waking up with my lovely wifey next to me. She said ""happy valentine's day baby,"" and gave me a kiss. We both got up to get ready for school and took off. She was in a super bad mood cuz of some book she couldn't find, and cuz of a midterm she had that she wasn't prepared for. I was, however, a little excited to start my day so we can get to our evening plans ;) we didn't really have n e... we were gonna go watch rent, but it didn't happen.

i got outta class and was talking to annie bout her gurl problems. she was asking me for advice, and this time i felt okay giving it to her. i did hesitate tho, wondering if i'm the right person to advise her about relationships and wat not. after all, i didn't take my own advice back when... when maybe i should've... so i figure that kinda taints my image. regardless, i spoke my mind. a lil later, bf called me to ask for a ride cuz she didn't feel well. she gave blood earlier that day without eating (dumb butt) and now felt ""out of it."" i was planning on picking up jacky-o from skool since i was out a lil early, but i decided to check on bf first.

well, jacky ended up getting out of class really early so i couldnt go pick her up. instead, i met her on wilshire n western (where the bus drops her off to take the red line). we went to a delightful dinner at the Radisson in Downtown. It was super cute! we met a lil african girl... maybe 5 years old. she was super nice and started asking us questions about our families, about my husband (haha), and about where we live. i dunno, i thot it was cute. 

we left the lil restaurant and went to chill at my house... then just fell asleep watchin TV. Good times."

"event","Ive started this thing where i just get over stuff and not care. it's workin mostly cuz i have too much shit to do, so i dont really care to be bothered or watever. also, it seems to be that im the ""only one"" who holds grudges and i was advised not to because it just ages people and may endanger the health of the individual. so..... i sucked shit up already and have been kew with evelyn for some time, talked to jess here n there (but she still kinda can get kinda weird/annoying), and trying to keep my friendship with debbie chill while her n evelyn get over themselves. 

volleyball has taken up plenty of my time. i love it! its about time i dont feel like a fucking stalker, or a freak gf, or a bored ass friend who always calls gaby to be my ""date"" to coldstone or elsewhere. i mean, i still do that crap but not as much. i was pist today just walking in the gym... so practice wasn't as great as i wanted it to be. 32 minutes to get from downey to bellflower (LBCC) is soooo not kewl at all! i was really mad. not to mention the $45 i lost paying for my lap top repair crap. so, i was late to practice, didnt get to warm up with my bf which is always pretty fun, had heather on our team of three for queen of court, and pulled some stupid shitty tendon possibly connecting to my gastro... which may lead to a sick cramp on the belly of that muscle or just linger along the tendon, which sucks cuz it hurts more! i didnt wanna move... and after the shitty practice i cried about last night i wasn't ready to put forth the same effort. it didnt seem worth it, but i at least know that when it comes to the game ill be ready... adrenaline pumping and palms sweaty... ass on the floor and burnin flesh off my forearms... all that is volleyball. i love it! 

on a different note... i had dream bout pinky last night. the last 2 nights actually but i dont member what it was the night before, i just member i did dream and she was there. last night though,... that was weird. just chillin and driving together like the old days. the days BEFORE ""our days"". i woke up compelled to call her and see what she's up to. it's strange because i really do miss her and just... being friends... having that convenience of living 5 min. away from each other. even if people did think she looked like a man, it was okay cuz it didnt impair her ability to crack on other folks. i loved it... i still do. ive never met an asshole quite like her. its people like her that make it easier for me to be me. im not really sure what it all means, but i hope we some how reconnect... soon."

im here in my room, moochin off the sounds my sister is playin in her room... we're both in the same state at the moment i think. ive totally been in a ""coldplay"" mood and she has satisfied my craving. 

45min later...
i hate that my sister is goin thro crap. i hate knowing that there's nothing i can do to help her. no matter what, things wont change. i noe how that is... only a little bit tho. i guess things don't always happen the way u want them to. its kinda crappy cuz in a relationship, the people involved always tell eachother that they only want to make the other happy. everything they do is for their partner, out of love and appreciation for them. that may be true, but to what extent? it's never enough i guess n maybe im a bitch for wanting things to b a certain way... i just think it sucks that the only thing I wanted to be ""my way"" didn't happen. 

its like (yes anothoer one of my dumb ass analogies) when u are a guest at someone's house n they ask u if u want the last can of strawberry soda, a glass of water, or some coke. well coke gives u gas, and water isnt always good (dnt noe why that shit matters... haha), so u ask for the strawberry soda... n then they tell u to pick again cuz they really wanted that one. i dunno... even tho its sumthin lame like a soda, if it was ur first time meetin that person (first-impressions matter sometimes), you're gna be able to tell what kinda person they are. that's something as insignificant as a soda, imagine decisions made in the relationship! 

oh man... i have too much shit in my head. i should jst right a booka already. see jacky thinks that its cuz i want to show the workd how horrible people really are, n how they're all the same n they'll all eventually fuck up (with the xceptions of course). but thats not even it =/ i want someone to prove me wrong... fuck that! i want lots of people to prove me wrong. i want people to say my book is shit and my words dont hold truth. i dunno about a lot of shit right now. kinda feels like i stick with the familiar partly because i hate change... the other part is cuz i can't imagine how my life would b if it was at all different. i guess i gotta work with wat i got right? make the best of every situation... stick it all out like a true soldier... let nothing and no one get to me... mind over body and soul. sound healthy? i didnt thing so either =/ hehe it'll get the job done tho. 

**dayum... who the fuck am i these day?!?!?!?!?! hope i figure it all out... real soon.**"

"event","damn... i cant believe i took 1/2 an hour for a fucking shower this morning!!! the drive was a bitch too... stupid 605 n sprinkles! i didnt make it for my anthro film and i really wanted to watch it! no joke =P im just sitting here... in lot ummmm.... i dun even noe hehe. well, im in front of the pyramid waiting for my dad cuz imma go have breakfast with him. 

i dnt want to go cuz he disappoints me n... he's a jerk! but i dunno why i want to still keep it kew. i guess cuz at one point he WAS a good guy, and i cling to that memory hoping he'll go back to being that person. He hasn't seen me cry since i was maybe 16. I havent cried about him since... wooooooh since i was 13 maybe, until today. just thinking bout stuff really... really gets you thinking (go figure eh?) It's just hard to let go of the shit he's done. It still really hurts to know that he didn't care enough about his kids to just do the right thing. I mean, he and i were never close when i was younger. actually, i dnt really have too many good memories with my dad. i dnt even remember him at any birthday parties, or picking me up from school, or hugging me after a hard day at practice, or... or just smiling at me. 

i remember... father/daughter night my sophomore year. I had a late home game. He came and I played the whole game, which he said impressed him (but i dnt remember caring). I scored 26 points that game... 5 3-pointers, had a four point play on one of em, i was 4/5 at the line, and a few steals to get easy 2pts here n there. i remember the game cuz it was the bst i had ever had, AND it was really close, but dont remember anything after that. 

oi i dunno why, but everything just comes to surface when he calls. everythign just comes back... EVERYTHING. i couldnt/cant even tlak about it cuz it makes me cry. i dont care about him really, but i dont know how someone can change so much so fast, and not give a fuck about who he's hurting in the process. i don't understand it... but i guess (just like lots of other things in my life) i dont have to. it's not my business to undestand, right? fuck if i know... im just some dumb kid who's too strong for her own good at times and hides as much emotion as possible. im off for breakfast... with Arnold (my dad). Guess Imma suck it all up for the hour and see what happens."

"event","Ive been blah all day... and it sucks ass. i thot it was jst cuz i hadnt eaten, but i ate n the feelin was still there. oi i hate feeling like this. i think ive jst been thinkin too much bout yesterday. i wasn't mad when she was talkin bout melissa but... i noe she didnt want to turn her away. i know she likes visitors n im sure she's wanted to see melissa for a while already... barf! i mean, i told her it was kewl that they were friends but i still dont understand it. im still NOT mad or hurt or watever, but jst... i couldnt say my piece. 

i guess i understand why she didnt want to hear what i had to say cuz i didnt really wanna say it n e way... well, i did but not to hurt her feelings. i ended up doin it tho but i swear it wasn't intentional!!! oi me n my big mouth, but i think its just that ""thing"" in me that makes me want to shut someone up, especially when they're shutting me up. for so long she would try and pry shit out of me. now, shes tryin to make sure i keep my mouth shut. ""we're past what I want, jacky."" the worst words to say, but i swear they just came out. wat sucks the mostest is that i meant it. 
 
i think it was the fact that i was super tired n hadnt eaten cuz otherwise i wouldve jst let it all out. im kinda glad she tells me this stuff tho cuz it helps me control my urges to just go show up at her school n surprise her... it just makes me feel better after a long day cuz i miss her a lot n stuff. i mean, its now a good thing or feeling but it works.
 
i made my feelings known but it didnt matter in the beginning. i guess i forced to compromise, but i figured the compromise would b lettin go of jessica in order for her to let go of melissa. christ... n now they still have their tight ass friendship. guess i really am a bitch with no heart. oh well... i can still b friends with jessica wen i want tho. she IMed me last night n asked if we could b kewl online. i jst told her that i was busy... she said she'd try back later or sumthin. im not tryin to be her friend just to get at jacky... its just there. if anyone would understand it should b jacky, or at least thats wat i think.

i dont like not having control over a situation, but i dnt like having control over a person. i mean if she wants to see her, she should just see her. if she WANTS to see her... that doesn't change just because she doesnt get to. if n e thing it makes the want greater =/ *shrug* oh i dunno... i wouldnt wanna b there n e way if melissa was there. i think its because i think she's shady n fake with me. she just wants to b kew because she wants to b jacky's friend... and i think she wants jacky's friendship because she wants jacky. watever im over it. if they want friendship, they got it. i told her i have no problem with it, and i dont. so, i guess that means that they can just go on n b friends n do ""friend"" things. just hope it goes both ways... wats good for her is good for me."

"event","I kinda tired of waking up alone after dreaming bout my bonobo cuz then it jst makes me sad. it's really hard not to b able to b around the person u really love n have the best times with all the time =( but... its still kewl cuz at least i know we're together and we'll see eachother soon. 

Oh I love spending time with her! She's jst soooo much fun n sooo sweet n everything!! =) Last night was so much fun... going to City Walk with Tiif 'n Danny, having dinner at Camachos, and a nice lil movie to get us cuddlin... it was a really nice night. god i wish we could do that more often but its just that we hardly get to take naps together n lie together, so thats usually wat we do. i love our naps too... awww we're so cute. hehe 

this is just so different from anything else ive really felt. yah i loved xenia, i guess, but i didnt really LOVE being with her. id kinda push her off to her friends, but i dont remember if it was cause that's really wat i wanted or if it was cuz i knew that was what she wanted. it took me a while to tell her that i loved her, but now that im out of the relationship, im not sure i ever really was IN LOVE with her. maybe i jst wanted it to work because i put so much time into it, or maybe cuz i wanted to see if i could change her... i could spend all day with different ""maybe"" ideas but i jst dnt noe what the real answer is. i dont regret being with her cuz i learned from our experiences & my idea of ""what i want"" in a person was clearer once it was over. hmmm come to think of it, =/ i didnt really have fun with her... she was kinda wack n boring, unless we were talkin shit bout other people =P she kinda had a nice body tho, n her eyes were nice cuz they were a kinda light brown, but thats all there was to her. no substance, no depth, no intelligence... we were sooo different, i dunno how it lasted as long as it did.

all i noe is i NEVER even came close to feelin how i feel now. i love being with her and i know this. other people can tell too & im glad they can. it's almost been a year n im not sick of her, or anything about her =) im not surprised but im excited for our future together."

"event","It's just really weird to see a friend go and... grow up i guess. especially if she hasn't lived one day as a grown up in her life and shes 22 already. its kinda sad cuz she tells other people shes only 21 sometimes so they dont think she's too much older than them. anyway... guess she was gonna leave anyway and at least this way she doesnt leave alone.

she says she needs to grow up and stuff and she needs to move on. i dont noe wat that means but im assuming theres just something she's keeping from me/us. watever... i just wish she didn't have to let go like this. she's doin it all kinda wrong. i mean, where was this grl when alex got into her accident 2yrs ago? where was she when she was losing her little brother X-mas '03? i dunno... its jst kinda wack that its all gonna be lost because of some grl that f*cked her over in the past. 

i guess people never really do get over their first loves. i dont noe if that means that ive never had my first love =( i thot it was betty, but... i got over her... Xenia, but i got over her... i dunno. but then again, i hear i have no heart. i guess just cuz i can get over things... i dunno. people tell me that jst cuz i can, it doesnt mean everyone else can. i noe thats true but why?!?!?! ive been told that im just stronger than other people, but i think thats jst a nicer way of saying i have no heart... haha. oh well, at least I know i do. 

so i guess this is it for now for my friendship with Geneva Alexia Vega =/ it's just kinda weird cuz she did it all formal too. ""Ari, I've been thinking about everything and it's just becomeing a bigger deal than I thought it would. Me leaving is a good thing and I need to move one with my life and grow up and I can't do that knowing that you and the girls are over here so we can't be friends anymore."" All this on AIM... i hate the f*ckn computer! the lil wimp couldnt even call me! dont i deserve at least that?!?!?! oi christ she's sooo weird sometimes! i hate her!!!!!!!! ... =/ i love her... =/ i miss her already. y are gay braods so... dumb and broad-like? *shrug* dumb bitch she BETTER be my frined later! oi pues...

I guess things are better. i honestly can say all is forgiven n the trust is reinstilled, but its not forgotten. it's just kinda hard to know that everything we've been through could just have been avoided. its kinda gay to bring it up some more, which is why i dont, but i just don't fuckin understand enough i guess. i mean, its not keeping me from loving her or being happy with her, but it's just the fact that i dont understand n i cant just walk away. 

we were chillin earlier n her friend called talking about drama SHE has with HER gurl. it kinda sounded familiar, so i really feel for the gurl cuz its pretty shitty for someone to promise not to do something, do it, then tell u they were doing it all along, and follow all that up with the fact that she's not gonna stop doing it. see... normally, i would say just to leave her. i would tell her to just break up with her gf and let her think about shit on her own. i would tell this gurl that if her gf didn't care enough to just stop, obviously her chice was made. Her own happiness is more important to her, and who the hell would want to be with someone that selfish. yah well... thats wat i would normally say, but i guess i cant n e more =/ i didnt take my own advice and im kinda glad that i didnt because i do love her, but it still hurts that it even happened. 

in the summer, i had some shitty experience at the beach in rosarito. i kinda almost drowned or at least thats wat i was thinking was going to happen. i was screaming n crying but the waves were washing away the tears faster than they could fall. by the time we got near the sand after wat felt like hours, i ran far from the water and threw myself on the floor. it was the most horrifying experience of my life thus far. i still go to the beach... that im not afraid of, but i wont really get in the water. i still love the ocean, but i dont trust the waves. It kills me to know that it happened to me... and just being there brings back all the feelings of fear and panic i had that one day this past summer. 

I think i really need a therapist =/ gaby... we can go together n that way its less money =) hehe... i just hope things get even better between my love and me. i hope everything works out for the friend too. shes a kewl kid and no one deserves that kinda sh*t. wat sux is that now that its happened, its always gonna b with her especially if this is wats breaks them up. i wish em the best... swing homo*"

I woke up and got ready for skool in good time too, and i didnt go. i was soooo down for going eventho i looked like shit with my f*cked up hair and my puffy eyes, my fat ass lips (cuz they're swolen), and my dirty ass shoes. now i should really jst make my way to work but... i dunno as of right now that i want to go. i need money tho and i need to be more disciplined when it comes to ""real"" stuff like that. i wanted to jst go to skool cuz, eventho its kinda boring n i dont really talk to many people, it gives me a lil interaction with people n stuff. i think i really need that right now.

i found out who falttened my tire =/ but i dnt noe if its cut or if they jst let the air out. i gotta go get that shit checked cuz it looks really gay rolling on a spare. i ALSO got hit a lil while back... not too long ago... n it scuffed my back right side. now my car's making like a ""click"" when i turn so... i gotta check that too =/ but my dumb ass only got her # cuz i didnt want insurance to get involved!!! hell no i was at UCLA n if my mom found out she would kik my ass! haha oh well

yesterday... was fucken bad. i went to visit my bonobo right after school n jst took sum stuff to keep myself busy, like hw n stuff. i took mynew LT too so i could like go online or watever cuz she was gonna have to work a 3hr shift n i was gnna sit in the room doin nothing. well i had to look for the dumb chord but i couldnt find it so i just let it go. i talked to laura n was all worked up and just... i didnt noe how to just hold back tears so... i didnt =P i cried n she kinda wanted to too. later i went to get the faggo from work so we could walk up together but on my way down alexia vega (the gretest person i noe hehe)called me. its crazy how we have this thing where we can sense when the other is buggin or watever. so she called, we talked, i cried... same ol shit as always. me talking, us crying, her telling me what i already know but still care to hear cuz its from her. jax called me so i clicked over n told her i was waiting for her. she saw me a lil teary, but i didnt want to talk about it.

i dont noe why i do this shit. its no one's fault but my own cuz i put myself there. alex, i noe u think im an idiot, but wat can i say *shrug* i hate it when people lie to me, keep shit from me, hurt me, betray me.... but it jst feels like im doin it to myself cuz i hold back. i lie to m yself n make myself blieve what i want to believe. i mean, thats the way ive always been tho and im kinda gettin back into that mode. i jst got to try n keep the bitchy part of my past out of my present character cuz all it does is work against me. i tried to keep it to myself n act like nothing was wrong but i didnt do a good job.

when i was leaving mmy love was crying, then told me how i felt so cold when we were lying together. how i felt like a stranger, not her gf. she told me how i really hurt her, and i sincerely felt terrible bout it all. ""its just me."" thats all i told her. i said i was sorry more than a dozen times and she forgave me, but i still felt really bad. those emotions mixed with the ones from earlier... it wasnt good. i did fight back tears the whole time i was there and while she was crying, tho.

Once I started home talked to her tho, that was a different story. i started bawlin on the phone to alex bout everything!!! i had to pull over for a lil bit but not more than like 3 or 4 min. my <3 called me so i hung up with alex, controlled myself, and talked to her the whole way home. i got home n jst went to lie down... finally fell asleep 'round 2 or so... which sux cuz i woke up at 6:30 to not even go to school!!! gay ass shit!"

It's just... that's the way things used to be, we would tell eachother everything, but now they seem different. Not too much but just enough. Im just really frustrated with not having control over things. Iv never really cared about having control over someone, but a situation or problem... oi i dunno. I guess the trust has just diminished so much where I want a reason not to care. I know u noe wat i mean =/ just gime a reason. I hate secrets, but it feels like they're still there. Either lingering or growing... but i cant prove shit. do i want more problems??? NO! thats y i havent asked about anything. watever it is, it feels really important. I have no idea what the hell im thinking. Id rather put it here tho than make it known.

I guess im a weenie, but its because i really want to try and make it work. my feelings aside, things are perfect. i want to trust her like before but i dnt noe how. i don't noe wats true and wat isnt anymore. i can only pick and chose and hope im not being lied to. maybe im making it a bigger deal than it really is, but at least its ONLY MY DEAL to deal with. i dnt now how parents can take it... just keep quiet when u KNOW ur kids are lying to you. damn i dont think i could take that. that would really hurt my feelings a lot!!! damn this sucks.

we got there a lil late (me n jax) cuz she wnt to buy shoes n stuff so... yah that took a lil time. we got to dinner n it was chill, it was pretty fun from where i was i guess =P i sat at the end of the table (which i was pleased with actually) not really having to socialize but still hoping i would. i didnt surprise myself... i didnt really talk at all. jacky was in her world with her friends which was super kewl n ui had no problem with it... i swear! so... i jst kept to myself n kinda just ate. we had plans to go to a party for my friend Di who was throwing one for watever reason. AND amy was also having a lil kickback which i was supposed to attend but didnt get to... neither friday nor sat. instead,... after much debate... i went with jacky n her friends cuz we were gna drive to hollywood to walk the blvd. i guess. we never made it cuz the grls got restless and tired of driving... PLUS it was gettin late. walking in hollywood at midnight isnt really fun unless ur going clubbin'... which we werent. 

we were leavin OG n they were making plans to go to hollywood. i told her id go to di's with my sister as long as she could drop me off at home. i didnt drive for a change and i really wish i had. she made plans to go n they all finally decided, THEN... she asks me if its ok. i told her it was kew to just go n drop me off. that id go to the party n stuff... no big deal. she didnt believe me. i just want her to have her time with her friends. i dnt want her to do something she didnt want to do nor do i want her friends to think i have her on some string. she obviously wanted to go with her friends but felt obligated to stay with me. she told me she was going to stay but i didnt let her. she got mad n stuff giving me looks that showed her anger and frustration with me. wtf am i supposed to do. yes, its what i wanted... i wanted her to come with me @ first but that didnt matter enough. it wasnt that i was mad, but i could just TELL what did matter at the time... BUT THEN I CHANGED MY MIND... and wanted her to go with her friends.

she said she was gonna go home if she couldnt come with me so i gave in n told her i would go with her. wat really got me mad tho was when i was trying to talk to her to explain stuff n i was speaking in spanglish n shit n she made some comment like, ""I dont know why shes fuckin talkin like that anyway,"" cuz nat was in the car with us. nat doesnt speak spanish so i guess she thot i was tryin to keep shit from nat *shrug* PLUS nat was on her side. i dont noe why but things jst really hurt my feelings sometimes... alot of times. im very sensitive if i let soemone get to me, but if i dnt then im cold hearted. fuck im screwed up = /

i put my plans from friday on hold so i could go to ozz with them instead of to amy's kickback with the girls. i flaked on di after i told her i was going to be there just so the fucing drama/conflict would stop. i just gave in when she tells me stuff and it makes me feel weak. emotionally, mentally, and physically. i feel inferior at times because i let her get to me. i let the shit she does get to me and i rather not talk about it really in hopes that things get better on their own. i always tell ehr to decide what to do, where we go, what we eat, who we chill with, but hse wont. she doesnt like to because she likes to leave it up to me. when i decide, she doesnt care and figures she knows what i really want. the shit i TELL her i want, she won't do. there's a readon or other for doing shit. the stuff i tell her i dnt care for,... well she goes and does and makes excuses to justify. 

i dont mean i want to b without her, but i do need to put this shit down. if i dnt i think id explode and try for the 3rd time to leave. i jst dnt think im emotionally ready, nor am i confident enough, to be in a real relationship. i dont noe whos fault it is, but it doesnt matter. that's just wat i think. i need help =/"

anyway... the reality is this: i am not the best student in the world, i am sick of the bullshit my family is going through because they think we're still a ""family"" n need to act as one, im tired of LA traffic, im sick of fake people who are sooooo not dependable, im tired of the liars LA people think they have to be, im tired of everyone trying to protect me from shit or thinking they know whats best for me. ill tell u wat the fuck is best for ME because only i noe!!! i hate that!... everyone has an opinion when i dnt care, but when i ask for it they tell me to make up my own mind. thats super dumb, xcept for gaby who always tells me how it is. 

i think i may need counseling. i barely thot about it today on my here... to visit my bonobo. i never thot i needed it. in fact, i never really thot it worked, but i guess when ur me it can't hurt. i dnt have money tho... n i dnt want to go to some lame ass psych who can only pencil me in once a month cuz he/she has 32,000 other students to tend to. damn i need a vacation. i need a job. i need..... wat i really need is something to keep me busy, cuz skool isn't cuttin it. i wanna play a sport... intramurals even. i dnt really care what at this point =/ i cant wait till fall when i get to be with the vb grls from high school n live vicariously through them again. i loved it last year =) oh man... wat else can i do?

i really need to step up for school. i want to do better! i want to get into my program... i want to get a job already!!! i want to graduate in 4yrs (but god noes imma need 5), i want to transfer... to san diego state =( why? i dnt noe. to get away i guess. to just put EVERYTHING out of sight, n out of mind. to be able to deny anything at all is happening. this kinda sux cuz its not like me to just walk away from things. im usually the lil bitch that stays around to give a guilt trip,or jsut to be a constant reminder to everyone else that i overcame it all. when the shit happens in high school, everyone says its just cuz its that time of life... ""the high school years"" where everyone talks shit n life is always ""drama."" i thot that shit would end, but it hasnt. it has found its way into my house and my personal life, into my love life and my heart, into my head and is forever with me eventhough i go out of my way to avoid it. 

when is it gonna end? the least i ask is that i get a lil competition to i can feel great about kickin ass =/ *shrug* i gotta figure sumthin out i guess. im tired of being blah all the time. i was born to b grown up... no, really i was. at least thats what i think. it has to be right? or else y would i b having such a shitty time actually GROWING up?"

"event","i couldnt go through with letting go. i dont noe yet if sticking with her is a bad idea, but i jst noe for now its feels great. i went to visit yesterday n to talk about stuff that really did hurt me. i cried for a while then i just... i guess i came to and got over it. i stopped crying out of no where tellin myself that all i can do now is be strong, but not let myself b as vulnerable as i once did. trust is totally an issue now, which sucks cuz i loved that fact that it wasnt b4. i noe i love her and that she means the world to me, but who can really say that she doesnt mean the world to everyone else too. she told me its not a competition, but it really is. i compete with everyone/everything else as it is... now super best friends? bullshit! i dnt have problems with friends, but secrets and lies i dnt like. i have a biased... yah so what? i dont care. i want to be with her n if im not... then i feel lost. i need her, but if one more thing goes wrong... imma have to survive without her... without us. ""one day"" is hanging in the balance now. what was once so real and concrete has begun to erode... its being washed away by the dangerous waters. its gonna take a lot of strength n sh*t, but im willing. i can only hope it works out. thanks for everything goob. hope ur not disappointed... and thanks for letting me noe that im not an idiot for the shit i do/think. ur the best... i really do love you eventho ur a faggot n all =P"

"event","Coming back from SD i dropped off jacky n went home so memo could take me to my g-ma's. i was only there like an hour or so then called the faggy again to see if we could go to a movie or sumthing. so i end up callin when im exiting but no anser,... call her house but same thing... txt her cuz i know how much she LOVES to text... all while on the phone with evelyn jokin bout how imma pull up n her ex will be pulling away. sure enough i was right and it was the most shitty feeling in the world. to noe that watever plans we had were put on pause so they could talk. her shoes weren't on, not even ready to go knowing i was coming to pick her up. im pullin up n the dumb ass broad walks to her car. why she left i have no idea! nothing was going on, so she shouldn't have had to leave right? but they both knew that they're friendship was being kept from me. so.... that means everyone knew and no one said anyhting. my ""best friend"" knew but gave no heads up. i felt so ALONE!!! so lost and just fucking out of the loop *tear* watever... but i couldnt take it. so i got really talkative so i could just keep it out of mind not wanting to talk about it. we got back n i was ready to leave but gave in to her invite to go inside. from the moment i pulled up n saw them, i was deciding what to do. what action, if any, would be best for ME. i tried to do wat was best for ""us"" before but somehow it only went one way. 

what killed me wat that i was feeling so bad earlier for thinking te worst with no reason. i felt soooo guilty bout making a big deal before... i felt like the world's worst girlfriend for no believing the person i love. the same person who told me she didnt care about the friendship,... that she wasn't goin to talk to her or see her n e more unless it just ""came up"" becuase she wanted to do wat was right for us. what she REALLY wanted to do tho was tell me wat i wanted to hear. it doesnt fly with me when its all lies tho. when u dont have the willpower to keep from speaking to someone, its because you dont want to keep from speeking to them. 

i spent last night crying n explaining my feelings bout the situation/what happened. it was attempt #2 for me but she wouldn't let me let her go. she asked me to promise i wasn't leaving... that i wasn't going to break up with her. all the while i was saying i was sorry, that this is what i need, and that i love her. i finally gave in n promised, but i felt i had one promise to louse up since she had done the same. she came a little b4 1 to see me, but i had nothing to say. she asked me to promise again n i just said okay. now after it all... i just can't. i can't keep on like this pretending its all kay with me cuz its not. i don't really care wat people think about what ive done,.... which is probably the biggest mistake of my life but god noes im not that bad alone. imma die when she hooks up w/somone or gets back with her ex but if it comes to that... complete disconnect =( im crying here at school in the lab just thinking about all the great things,... all the great times we've had together,... the great times that were interrupted by phone calls, texts messages, stories about the past n ex gf. 

if i dnt bring up mine, isnt that like a hint? oh man what have i done? sending a myspace msg to end things is not wat i had in mind but wat else can i do? ive never hurt so much in my life...not even when i found out about my dad cheating on my mom with her bf, or him leaving, or my sister not talking to me for a year, or my mom nagging at me for years while in school. this is right up there with betty's death cuz it feels like im losing my best friend all over again. the one person who i consider to be my favorite person in the world, is the favorite of everyone else as well. i dont share... ima bitch like that. maybe with time i can change,... that's what all this is for. i noe i will always be willing to pick up where we're leaving off, i jst hope she feels the same.

"event","spring break '05 wasn't spent in Brazil with the girls or nuthin... it wasn't a bunch of fags getting drunk right before goin swimmin, it wasn't me with some of the biggest homos ever trying to see how far someone is willing to go for a number, it wasn't doing all the things me n the grls do when we're together... including missing my baby... because i got to be with her. friday morning we left with a few friends to san diego cuz i wanted to go to the zoo!!! i noe... kinda gay, but i LOVED IT!

 so friday we get there and check in n crap n im ready to call my mom but my fucking fone didn't work!!! i cld snd txts but not make calls. so i left my phone off pretty much the whole weekend, not knowing that incoming calls are possible!!!! yah well jacky let me noe SHE knew that, later of course... which kinda let me know in a suttle way (by the way she said it) that she had received a call(s) from people/person i dont care for. BARF!!! n e way... i let it slide didnt say shit cuz after all,... i didnt have to hear bout it or nuthin. 

hmmmm...... back to friday... we jst went to eat before hittin up ROSARITO n stuff & hangin at Club Iggy's or watever its called. girls gone wild was there but we were in like a corner not tryin to b on camera or n e thin. eventhough we were dressed like nuns and shit, we still got hit up on as a couple by at least 20 guys... no joke it was disgusting and annoying. some guy even offered us $1000 to take a picture w/him after we argued with him for bout 15min because we didnt want to take one at all. he swore he was gay but we didnt care! it was fun for the most part tho... we got back to the hotel to sleep n woke up saturday to go to the ZOO!!!!!!!! that was the highlight of my trip to SD... i guess its pretty nerdy but it was the shit!!! 

gorillas are sooo amazing but we got fucking scared when the silverback male ""the alpha male"" got too close to the f-en window =$ i wanted to see the polar bears swim but all the 2 were doin was chillin n lyin around! oi i want my puppy!!! i got to keep my comments bout my puppy to a minimum tho now cuz it gets on jacky's nerves already. *shrug* oh well =/ that night brenda n her boi got a lil faded b4 we went to dinner at the olive garden. it was kinda funny tho... brenda sober is hilarious so her drunk is a lil funny too =P we got back to the hotel to knock out n jst spend time cuz we'd b leaving the next morning. 

sunday we woke up n had breakfast n jst got shit together to go home. while we were gettin our stuff together jacky got a txt from some friend of hers, and although i don't not like that particular friend, i knew that the txt she received would only be the first of many for the day. DAMN I HATE BEIGN RIGHT THO!!! so we check out by 12ish and jst while int he car... the phone doesnt leave her hand. we're driving for 45min. already n shes still there txting god noes who... i could only image... sitting on the complete opposite side of the car hiding the phone WHILE texting!!!!!!!!!!!!! i think the worst so that watever it REALLY is doesnt seem so bad. PLUS... it just felt like i knew who she was txting but i was HOPING to b wrong. i hate fucking being pist in a car cuz u cant escape it,... the person... the things that but the hell out of u... the rudeness... the shit was that we had spent an awesome weekend togethr, we hadn't even completely gotten out of SD and we're already back to the same shit that was driving me crazy b4 we left. 

i wanted to cry... i wanted to walk home... i wanted to jst b by myself. i studied n listened to music, putting the shit as loud as i could, humming to myself to fall asleep or sumthing. telling myself that breaking up wouldn't fix anything,... tryin to calm myself down because i wanted to enjoy watever time we had left. well that time , no matter how I spent it, was being spent txting anyway so... yah. GOD I FUCKING HATE HER PHONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! im sick of phones already. that's her life, not me... her firends are her life,... not me, her family's her life... then comes me. i understand the family, but the rest can suck my toe. i need to stop feeling like this, acting like this, thinking this way. but why when im givin all the reason to?

xenia used to b on her phone all the fucking time too. she'd tell me all the time how she loved her phone and how it meant the world to her. she'd tell me how no matter what happened, when it came down to her friends or me and having to chose like she made me chose, she'd pick them because i was jst another grl and they had a past... they had memories and connections that i could never understand. i didnt really care too much, but it let me know wat was up. from then on i knew how things were gonna b,... how they weren't gonna last. i didnt break up with her then because i knew it would happen eventually... and SOON. i knew she'd fuck up some how and she did. so when i compare shit like that to shit like this, there are too many similarities for one to handle. wat started as the best spring break, turned out to have the most fucked up ending. totally killed the whole thing for me tho, which sux bcause it was almost perfect. fuck san diego... spring break '05 was a bust. good times at the zoo tho =/"

too bad i can only speak for myself when i say this is where i want to b. im not annoyed or tired of her/the relationship. i think, for me, it has to do with the fact that there is jst shit btwn us that for some reason HAS to come first... school, or family, or friends, or the f-en cell phone. something always finds its way through our tight bond. i think if were to move in together or watever, it would b easier kinda cuz we'd be eachother's FIRST priority. seeing her BEFORE i go to school... knowing while im with family/friends i know i still get to b with her b4 i go 2 sleep... spending the 8hrs or blissful rest w/eachother. i don't really know but it's jst been on my mind for some time. this is all i could come up with. either this or im just MEANT to b alone, on my own, single... not to ""play the field"" but just to be on my own and independant. hmmm... who the hell wants to be independant?!!?!??!!? christ,... i need a f-en vacation = /"

"event","so... im with this amazing person who i love, who all my friends love, who my sister loves (not like that of course), who i have the best time with. No one makes me feel like she does, ... i havent felt this way or loved somebody so much. Things have been super perfect for us as a couple, which made me wonder what the catch is. well,... i figured it out.
    It's so hard to just love someone and thats it. I mean, there are so many different feelings and fears that come with lovng someone as much as i do and i didnt noe it till now. ive never been afraid of losing someone cuz ive never really cared. why does love have to b so hard?... so complicated/complicating? I am a pretty understanding person, i noe this, and all i ask for is the truth. Ive never been jealous before and i dont really know why i am? i mean im kew with them (my gf and her ex... yah its weird) being friends, but then again i have to b. 
    when i started talking to her, sumthin she always brought up was her ex and how they werent friends anymore. she cared soooo much about this girl that it killed me even then, but we werent together so i felt stupid for being jealous then. i totally wanted them to because friends of course because i wanted her to be happy, but i didnt noe i was gonna feel so shitty. so now that they're finally friends, and ""best friends"" at that, it kills me even more. now all that comes to mind is how much she cares about this girl and their friendship... how she was so upset that they werent friends, which leads me to think that she still has feelings for her ex. 
    i asked her one time if she still liked her ex... this was a while ago... and she responded by telling me that she cared about her ex. she said she wasnt going to just stop caring because thats not the person she is. and i asked her again if she still LIKED her, and once again she avoided the question. no straight yes or no, just an explanation. from that day on, it was over. =/ i knew i was gonna go through this... through all this crappy pain. I dont tell her anything abou it cuz i dont want to make her choose. she shouldnt have to... i wouldnt ask her to do that. i try to brush it off but i cant... i really try. 
    im sitting up at almost 4 in the morning typing about it after talking about it for a couple hours with friends. its something i want to fix but i dont noe how. i just cry and cry about it, about this doubt i have in my heart. this doubt that my baby's heart doesnt only belong to me. it's the hardest thing to type because before this, it was always only a thought that flows through my head and a feeling that lingers in my heart. wat do i do?!??!?!?! all i can think of is just pulling out of the relationship to take some time to grow up and get over things. its just that im sooooo tired of crying about some girl that i dont even noe! im tired of feeling stupid for being with my gf.
when we're out she'll call and i can feel that its her right when the phone rings. it hurts my heart sooo much that i want to cry for hours until i fall asleep so i dont have to listen or b aware that they are even conversing. the tears i shed at the end of the day are to make up for not crying right then and there. my baby spent the night one time,... it had been a while since she spen the night... and i was already a lil touchy cuz she had kicked it with the girl a day and/or two before. they're best friends so they can do stuff like that, ya noe? anyway, its 3 in the morning and the phone rings. right when i jumped cuz the ringer scared me, i worked to hold back the tears cuz i knew it was her. i moved to the edge of the bed and stayed there after going to get water and going to the bathroom. i stayed there and sobbed quietly while she was on the phone. we talk on the phone and she'll get sleepy or i can tell shes bored of me n not listening, but at 3AM she was wide awake. i thought she had hung up but i couldnt fall asleep so i turned on the tv but kept it low... but they hadnt hung up, just go a lil quieter. i didnt sleep till 5:45 and it was cuz i had cried so much i got exhausted.
    this is the shit im putting myself through because i love this girl. why does love have to be like this though? its not like her ex is al kew with me n shit or respects the fact that she only spends the night once a month, if even that. i think the girl is a kew person, i really do, she seems really fun and adorable... as a person. when they interact, however, i hate her. its a never ending pain. if we're talking about stuff its about her, if we're not talking about it im thinking about it, if im finally at some point not thinking about it the child has the most ipecable timing and decides to call. 
    i noe this is super long but hey, i have nothing to do, and when this is most of what runs through your head daily, ud rather have it written or typed to sort of lift a weight off ur shoulders. undortunately, thats my wishful thinking cuz it isnt working. so now im off in hopes that all this crying that im doing will put me to sleep cuz i have work at 8am tomorrow."

"event","i went to a b-ball tourney with the homies... jacky n jen... today in irvine. it was kew stuff... n e thin w/sports (watchin or playin) is fine by me, especially if its free =) hehe 
n e way... i finally talked to the grls the other night. i really missed yasmine and carol, not so much alex tho hehe. there were like 7 f us on the line just talkin and they finally figured out how to make up for the bet i lost. they want me to rush the chick im crushin on! i was like #@$%#@$! they told me i was a weenie n sh*t... they call me ""nani le poulet"" but its not even that... im just... i dont wanna f*ck up our friendship. i mean shes actually funny n smart... i dont have friends like her. so they kinda dumbed it down to me just telling her that i like her. i was so nervous today when we chilled cuz they were gonna call me n i was supposed to tell her with them on the phone. well i didnt do it =/
the drive home str8 a lil weird cuz we were really quiet n there was a grip of room btwn us. its cuz i was super nervous tho... i coulnt stop thinkin bout the dare and i was gonna tell her in the car when she put her head on my lap, but i decided no to. i didnt wanna do sumthin stupid to kill the moment. i didnt wanna make her feel weird or watever... i was enjoying playin with her hair n kinda holdin her from fallin off the seat when jen broke f-in hard... hehe.
they dropped me off but mom wasnt home & i didnt have n e keys!!! i called jacky but she didnt answer so... yah. luckily my car was unlocked n i chilled in there and decided to keep myself busy by callin people. i called rachel n she came to chill w/me while i waited. we went to jack in the box and jacky called me back. well... i told her that i like her n that like... yah. rachel was right there and i felt really bad but i mean she noes i like the ""girl"". n e way... SHE LIKES ME TOO!!! =) it was soooo f-en... it was a really good feeling. my smile is still pretty damn big hehe *giggle. my mom came home n so... here i am... online... talking to the faggot goob as always. we're going to the movies tomorrow tho, like a date but not ;) even if nothing happens or whatever i noe we'll still be kew. i do like her tho so... im only hopin fo the best. so i guess i gotta thank the grls and call em in the mornin to tell em what happened. what the hell... ill call alex right now! =D"

"event","who wouldve guessed that spending a couple hrs w/soooo many fags would b soooo much fun?! i had a bomb ass time this year at pride... a lot different than last year, and i mean different in the best way possible. i wont really get into  detail about LB pride '03, but i will say that it was the day i went to pride w/high hopes of spendin time with my grl but instead saw her with another grl... needless to say we broke up. this year was awesome... totally makes up for last year! me, gaby, jacky, and jasmine went in my car n then tere met up with us there. i was kinda scared cuz i noe i made pride a big deal, so i worried that the girls werent gonna have as good a time as i made them think they would. i think we all had a pretty good time. the only thing that sucks is that im crushin on this one grl and i was gonna tell her, but shes not feelin me so i didnt say anything. YES GABY I NOE... I DENIED IT BUT I GUESS U WERE RIGHT *blush... it was kinda weird cuz the homie kelly thought she was my gf,... supposedly she was giving kelly ""a look"". hehe watever that means. but naw... she's just a friend i guess. i wanted to dance w/her but when i turned around she was dancing with some grl ( a friend of tere's) n l8r she was dancing with jasmine! christ... that one kinda got to me cuz they were pretty damn close.
its all good tho cuz i met some grl rachel there so i had someone to dance with... shes from BELL GARDENS! lol small ass world! =P i kinda saw her looking earlier when we first got there but i wasnt sure who she was looking at. i uno... we danced tho n i gave her my # but i felt bad cuz jacky was there n i wasnt sure what she was gonna think... but oh well =P she doesnt like me n e way. we're just friends so i got over that sh*t pretty quick. but no, not really cuz i do like her n i wanted to dance w/her her, not w/some grl that i dont noe. anyway... we danced l8r on but there were other people in a line w/us so.. i dunno. i think she likes me sumtimes but i guess its just me hoping. 
oh well... it was all good tho but then f-en jasmine was like holding her arm n stuff n totally burned me by bringing up rachel... grrr f-en kaspir! we went to in-n-out l8r n i took the grls home n tere took gaby to UCI. not really sure wat happened there but ummm ;) hehe yah. oh! then f-en jasmine told me how she thinks jackys peachy keen n sh*t... thats crap. watever tho it doesnt bother me cuz im not the jealous type... lol... watever that means."

"event","im over her n i told her today that its for sure not gonna happen... ever again. she seems pretty sure that we'll be together again some day soon, but she has to on sumthin if she honestly believes that. Its not cuz im crushin on sum1 either, its just because its over and i noe it... its been over. i honestly wouldnt get involved w/anyone if i was still sprung on the girl or even had feelings for her. the only feelings i do have for her are those of friendship, if even that.  i dont even think shes serious either about getting me back, rather she wants to see if shes got it like that with me. she likes being wanted and the reason for her acting like an asshole with me is because she wants attention, even if its negative. shes one of those horrible people who do shit like that... and for whatever reason, those people like to do their horrible shit to me. hehe its kinda funny how she isnt the first one to do so. they're probably all friends or ex-girlfriends.... hehe. i dunno... i just want this shit to be over. all contact cut, all memories put behind us, and all bullshit aside... i used to think she was worth it, but she really isn't. hehe... live n learn huh? =P"

"event","so... what do your actions really mean? do u or dont u love me? I guess im wasting my time wondering if its true, when i can't even see myself being with you. its over, ur gone, u f-cked with a good thing. but now ur back, ur here and u expect me to be the one who takes you back with open arms. how can i, when im trying so hard to hide the scars. the pain and the disappointment i had to go through, just for you to realize how much i really do love you. my words and actions weren't enough, u did ur shit to call my bluff. But who's hurting now while ur asking me back?... oh wait it's still me, but why the f*ck is that? i need to let go, i need to move on... i got 99 problems but a b*tch shouldnt be one.

"event","i went to some lame party where everybody there was str8 as f*ck n i didn't get along with some grl there. the guys were kew but the chix... omg typical shit. so... i go to see someone who from my past. i kick it with her for a while trying to figure out if i have feelings for her cuz i promised myself i was sooooo over it all. yah well... i guess i was wrong. we went to get starbucks n take it to sum grl she's talking to right now. i felt sooooooooooo f-en dumb!!! i can't believe i was second-guessing myself when i first got there. instead of feeling relieved that i had more of a reason to let go, i felt like i had to put up a fight or at least end everything with a lil smooch. But no... im an idiot. i always thought if i were to see her in public kissing n e one it wouldnt bother me. but today i realized that just KNOWING they have kissed and actually seeing them together totally broke my heart all over again. but why the f*ck do i care?!!?!?!? thats what pisses me off the most. i WANTED  to let go and move on. i told HER that we wouldnt get back together eventhough she was trying so hard because i didn't think i had feelings for her n e more. i was wrong. i lied to myself n tried to make myself think i was over it. i shouldn't have gone to see her... i shouldnt have gotten my hopes up or expected anything. i don't know what the fuck i want and im not sure i noe what to do any more. y cant i just b with someone who makes me happy who i can make happy too. then just maybe ill get through this. so now i wonder... do i miss her? OR is it i miss having SOMEONE to be with. I think that's it. I just dont like being alone... i dont have play with chix but for some reason she has always been there and she's kinda all i have, or at least thats how i see it. i dont have very many other options. being single is kew until u realize how ALONE you really are. =( anybody agree? dang... i was supposed to go back to the party but decided just to come home. im such a f*en dumb @$$. i could kick myself right about now!!! man... time to go put on some Coldplay... ""the scientist"" g*nite"

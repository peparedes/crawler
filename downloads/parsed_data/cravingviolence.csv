"event","At the 1994 annual awards dinner given for Forensic Science, AAFS President Dr. Don Harper Mills astounded his audience with the legal complications of a bizarre death. 
 
Here is the story : 

On March 23, 1994 the medical examiner viewed the body of Ronald Opus and concluded that he died from a shotgun wound to the head. Mr. Opus had jumped from the top of a ten-story building intending to commit suicide. He signed a note to the effect indicating his despondency and intention. As he fell past the ninth floor his life was interrupted by a shotgun blast which passed through a window, resulting in his instantaneous death. Neither the shooter nor the deceased was aware that a safety net had been installed just below the 8th floor level to protect some building workers, and, therefore, Ronald Opus would not have been able to complete his suicide the way he had planned. ""Ordinarily,"" Dr. Mills continued, ""A person who sets out to commit suicide and ultimately succeeds, even though the means or mechanism might not be what he intended, is still defined as committing suicide. The fact that Mr. Opus was shot on the way to certain death, but probably would not have been successful because of the safety net, caused the medical examiner to feel that he had a homicide on his hands. The room on the ninth floor, where the shotgun blast emanated, was occupied by an elderly man and his wife. They were arguing vigorously and he had been threatening her with a shotgun. The husband was so upset that when he finally pulled the trigger he completely missed his wife and the pellets exited through their window striking Mr. Opus. When one intends to kill subject ""A"", but kills subject ""B"" in the attempt, one is guilty of the murder of subject ""B."" When confronted with the murder charge, the old man and his wife were stunned and adamant, and both said that they thought the shotgun was unloaded. The old man said it was a long-standing habit to threaten his wife with the unloaded shotgun. He had no intention of murdering her. Therefore the killing of Mr. Opus appeared to be an accident; that is, if the gun had actually been accidentally loaded. The continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couple's son loading the shotgun about six weeks prior to the fatal accident. It transpired that the wife had recently cut off her son's financial support and the son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly, decided to load the shotgun with the expectation that his father would shoot his mother. Since the loader of the gun was aware of this, he was guilty of the murder even though he didn't actually pull the trigger. The case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the death of Ronald Opus. Now, Dr. Mills offers the exquisite twist to this case. Further investigation ironically revealed that the name of the couple's son was........Ronald Opus. In addition to losinghis ""financial"" security, he had become even more despondent over the obvious failure of his attempt to engineer his mother's murder. This led him to jump off the ten story building on March 23rd, only to be killed by a shotgun blast passing through the ninth story window. Since the son had actually murdered himself (according to the law), the medical examiner closed the case as a suicide. 
 A true story from Associated Press, Reported by Kurt Westervelt."

Billy loved Monroe with all his heart. But he never told a 
single soul. 
Monroe secretly loved him too. But she thought she would 
never have a 
chance with him. Billy asked his friends what they think of 
her and his 
friends thought she was gay. They didn't like her at all. 
So Billy just 
went along with them. 
They all made fun of her and made her feel really bad. Monroe 
was so upset. 
One day they followed her home from school making fun of her 
the whole way 
home. Once she got inside her house she dropped to the 
floor crying. 
She had a crush on Billy since 3rd grade. She didn't 
know what to do. 
When Billy got home he felt real bad about what he had done. 
So he decided 
to go to Monroe's house to tell her he was sorry and that he 
really loves 
her. When he got there he knocked on the door no one 
answered. The door 
was open so he walked in. He walked into the living room 
and found Monroe 
lying dead on the floor. She had slit her wrists. Billy 
was so upset. He 
knew it was his fault she killed herself. And now he could 
never tell her how he really felt.

i'm gonna share now words now:
To my ears the words taste bitter
There's sugar in your ears
To coat the words and make them sweet
Lies become chocolate for the mind 
Violence becomes a craving
You become obese with hate
It drips from you like honey
For everyone to see"

I am thinking about wearing my new green lacy thong panties. Don't know how he will feel about it, but I am thinking of springing them on him. Hope he likes them. 

I guess I will let you know."

"event","I think it'd be nice to find another guy to hang out with during the daytime hours who likes to play dress-up and isn't afraid to take little ""dares"" and go out in public together. I'd truly be fun. 

Later we could, um, relax together. 

It'd be fun to put make-up on each other and shave each other's legs. 

That's another problem. The whole wife thing. Can't really shave my legs or pits like I'd like. She wouldn't understand. Hard to think of a good excuse. 

I enjoy giving BJ's. I truly do. I really enjoy the taste of... well, you know. 

Sometimes I don't think I give very good head though. Anyone out there got any tips on how to improve this or to do this better... send me an email to new_secrets@yahoo.com

I'm thinking today I will dress up and go out. Where will I go? Hmmm... what will I wear? 

Never had the courage to go out in a skirt or dress before. I don't know what the difference is, really. I mean, I wear as feminine as you can get sometimes so why not go for it. Problem is finding nice stuff cheap. Don't really want to have to explain where the money to buy this stuff is going. 

I want to go out looking like a dirty little slut. Am I the only man who feels this?"

"event","So here I am. 

New frickin' Secrets. Yep. 

What do you want to know about me, and why do I feel that it is a good idea to share my intimate thoughts with you? 

Well, I doubt seriously anyone will ever read this anyway. 

So here goes:

I guess you can say I'm a gay man. You could say that. Well, I am a man and I have sex with other men, but I am married to a woman who has no idea about the gayness of me. Does this make me bi? I don't think so, because all of my fantasies are of men. If I were bi, wouldn't I fantasize about men and women equally. 

I am gay, but living the life of a straight man. 

I have a pretty regular fella. He's a real good guy and REALLY good in bed. I don't treat him very good though. Mostly because of the fact that I have to be so discrete, often I go weeks... months... without seeing him. Not fair to him. Of course, I don't expect him to remain celebate while he waits to hear from me... but it is a nice thought. 

We have different schedules, too, which further complicates things. When I do have a free moment... he doesn't necessarily. 

But GOD he is good. When he does me... why I can just about climax (and often do) just by feeling him inside me. Sometimes when he finishes in me... oh, I get such a tingly feeling without even getting off, its almost better, and I just want to savor it for a few minutes before he ulitmately finishes me off with his mouth. (mmm... that's good too, though, I ain't complaining). 

I guess I really have no reason to comlain about him. He has a good body, treats me really well, is very polite and understanding of my situation, and is really good in bed. So why must I... um... wander? 

I have a particular interest, and I am not sure if I am the only one who has it... but I am also not sure that he would be into it. 

See, I like going out in women's clothes. Now, I am not a tranny or a cross-dresser, at least not in the traditional sense. I am not trying to look like a woman. No... and I certainly don't want to attract guys because they think I look like a women. I just like to look like a man, dressed in women's clothes. Sexy women's clothes. Because it looks sexy to me. 

I don't know if any other men out there feel this way, or if there are any men out there who would be attracted to a man like this... but I am. 

I have tried to find things like this in the internet porn world, but have come up empty. All I ever find are she-males or men dressed to look like women. But not like I am into. 

Am I that weird? 

I have two outfits, that I prefer (and I must keep hidden from my wife). 

First (probably my favorite) is a pair of short-alls... real short. There are two buttons on each side that I like to keep unbuttoned to reveal the top sides of my pink flowery silk thong. I like to wear spaghetti strap belly shirts with this. And sandals, with painted toenails. Now... I said, I am not trying to look like a woman. Actually, I am built quite well for a man, so no one would probably mistake my manly arms for those of a woman anyway. Plus, I have facial hair (a goatee). But... I do like to wear lipstick and eyeshadow. And fingernail polish. Also, a gold bracelet and a necklace with a heart pendant. I think I look very sexy in this. Often I go out and walk around the neighboring town or in the mall or other stores dressed like this. Once I walked around downtown for about a half an hour dressed like this. I kinda got off on all the people stopping and staring. 

Weird, huh? 

Do you think this is stupid? 

My other favorite outfit is a little pink top & bottom set that I picked up with Tinkerbell from Peter pan on it. It has short short low-cut bottoms with ""Tink"" written across the ass. The top is a tank-top belly shirt thing with ""I Just Don't Care"" written on it, and a pic of Tinkerbell. When I wear this, the top of my thong sticks out in the back. Especially if I bend over. All of the accessories I wear are pretty much the same as on the other one with this. 

I wonder what my guy would think about this if he saw me? I wish that he would think I was pretty and encourage it. 

Usually, though... I wear it around then I end up going home and looking at gay porn videos while using my anal thruster on myself til I can no longer take it. It is so nice when I can get off without actually touching my penis. Sometimes if I hit just the right spot and keep just the right rhythm... my ass does all the work for me. And it is oh so nice. Mmmm. 

Well, I will try to write more tomorrow."

"event","<br />i'm three weeks away from my due date and very excited to finally see, kiss, hug, hold my daughter. on the flip side, i'm completely horrified of labor. i have no idea what to expect, how it's really going to feel, what's going to happen, if everything is going to go alright. i'm just at a&nbsp;total loss, because i've never done this before. and as much as i'm excited to be able to hold this child, rather than just hauling her around in my uterus, i have no idea what i'm going to do with her! i've never lived with a newborn, i've never had anyone depend on me to do EVERYTHING&nbsp;for them.&nbsp;i have no idea whether or not i'm going to be a good mother. and then..what if something happens and something goes wrong. i don't want to get my hopes up about having a healthy baby, because what if she's not? babies die all the time because of complications during labor and then there's SIDS. what do i do then? i've been waiting nearly a year for this baby to come and she <em>could</em> die or get hurt or get terribly sick and then what? i know i shouldn't be doing all this &quot;what if&quot; nonsense, but it's really hard not to think about all the awful things that could happen when you have no idea what the outcome is going to be like. and i know it's like that for so many situations, but this is another living, breathing (almost) human being that i made! that i've been carrying around and growing to perfection for 9 months. i just want her to be healthy and i want her to be here, so that we can love her. devin is so excited - he keeps telling her to come out, so he can hold her.&nbsp; she moves around every time he comes home from work &amp; she hears his voice.&nbsp; we both love watching her wiggle her butt inside my belly.&nbsp; right now she has the hiccups."

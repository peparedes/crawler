"event","I'm trying to get most intensively 0into SGA {as you can tell, I'm not a lit major b/c of my spelling :) haha]

1. Shep backstory coupled w/ McKay backstory: only b/c I [actually] thought the Mckay was in the series too much this year, yet despite it all,  I LOVE THEM BOTH AND [amazingly and obviously {though there will NEVER EVER be a replacement} they are the new daniel/jack.]
  
2.  I want new ""Wraith threat"" story lines.  Yeah, they can suck the life away, but where the hell did they evolve to that from?

3.  Weir, envolved w/ others. not so ,much just independetly, b/c I think her character is amazingly established.  She's play amazingly ;) haha Go Weir.

4. I miss Adien!!  I remember his actor being so pumped about his character and then he was gone!!!!  WTF?!  Honestly.  This might have been the most upsetting  thing in SG history [even more than non Daniel/Jack themes haha}

Oh, so sad..."

"event","I really don't think anyone is really aware of my existance at the moment [ :) ] but I have a few questions about the whole Stargate 'thingie' :)

1.  What episode is it that I see so often in fanvids where Daniel is talkin to Jack in a house [I presume HIS house] and playing chess and Jack's drinkin his Bud.  The conversation seems very important [Daniel is wearing the kind-of plaid/checkard shirt]  I have no idea.  I've never seen it and it seems very important.

2. What does the 'green' shirt mean on Atlantis [the one Chuck Tech wears]?  Seriously, is it for 'Non-McKay Canadian Inforcers'?

3. Why, in Aurora, isn't McKay concerned about how the ship was able to power itself for 10,000 years?  I know, yeah, it's a series, and I loved the playful banter between McKay and Sheppard [SUCH a McShep here!!] but still.


ANYWAY.  Haha.  I can't get these few concepts off my mind.

"event","I have felt the need to edit even my first posting :) I don't quite know what will come of this livejournal, but there is alot of Stargate fanfic and fanvid outthere that I love and want to try to get involved with.  I'm hoping that in the future I will post some of my fanfics, icons and even learn how to make a video or two.  I'm actually looking for advice on first time vidding.  Anyone? Anyone?"

we're giving an interview for a tech show on tuesday on the old (lol, old, we just designed it a month ago and it already old) system next tuesday, which means we need to sort out the mini-projector issues by the weekend. we've also got a d/vj set on sat - just some warehouse party, but it'll be the first show we use the new equipment at so it'll be a good system check. next turs we're leaving for portland for a fire show, then a dj set sat night... things should be awesome, i totally miss lauren, and we'll be tripping our faces and dancing the dub; well she'll be dancing, i'll probably be making the dub happen :) 
after that we hope to be setting up for another party here, but that depends on how the new hardware runs.

"event","So,

life's pretty great. :)
there are undoubtably things i'd like to change, bits that bring me down; but in the grand overview, things are pretty lovely. i don't think i've had much time to update anyone on my life since atleast pantheacon....so i suppose i'll start there:

pantheacon was one of the best this year. every year i think i say that, but i met some really amazing people, had the best discussions i've had in over a year, made almost 300$, and helped autumn in the vending room during most of the day -also the trip cost me absolutely nothing :) i stayed with friends, drove down with autumn, and got admission fees waived for all 4 days. 
i ran into jason newcomb, he invited me to his bio-feedback workshop, but it was full by the time i got there; no matter, he grabbed an extra headset from his car (note it was a workshop, not a lecture, by that i mean he brought feedback machines for us to use at ~10min rotations). it's hard to describe, but it was a fascinating experience - both isaac and i experienced first stage out of body perception; which apparently isn't exceptionally rare, nor common. we're both looking into further studies. :)

i wish i could go into more detail about the weekend, but there's alot of other things going on. ask me about it some time if you get a chance.
there is, however, one person i wish i could have run into there. unfortunately she wasn't in attendance. maybe another tyme.

monday night, after con (and keep in mind, i had just finished a 10 day fast the day before con, and had maybe 12 hrs of sleep the entire 4 days - no sleep at all sunday night) i was going to a dinner party with isaac, autumn, etc at aaron and kim's house. kim was organizing a show in monterey the following weekend, isaac and i, along with about 15 others, had been roped into it. neither of us had an idea what we were supposed to be performing. by the end of the night we had gotten 4 scenes each ""given to us""....none of which we had ever done before :/  keep in mind we had less than a week to get everything built, coreographed, and rehersed...
we were scheduled to do a two person contact juggling piece, isaac would do a single juggling set, we did a two person fire eating/breathing piece, a cbaret drag act, and i did a contortion set - on a bed of nails. there's a long story how that last one came about....ask me if you're interested in details :p
the evening was great; other than the torrential storm we had to push through to get to monterey. we met some awesome musicians, had some of the best sets of the evening (or so some ""unmodest"" audience members told us), and got tickets to the aquarium the next day :D hehehehe.  oh ja, and got money :p

there've been little goings onsince monterey - dancing, midnight birthday tea parties in the cemetary, 8 foot robots with jet engines and flaming florescent green eyeballs, sky diving plans, new stills, etc...but nothing too out of the ordinary ;)
(honestly the above run on sentence is what made me think i should post this entry. because while i dont mean to take these things for granted, that is pretty much my daily /bi-daily life... :))

i've got some interesting projects in procession right now, if you don't hear anything on them in the next few weeks remind me the next tyme you see me to update.

"event","not sure where to start on the life update bit, so here it is in no real order:

I finished my new corset:) 2 days before the Edwardian/Edward Gorey ball (unfortunately i don't have any pictures clearly displaying it) and it's quite lovely; black with white pen stripes, AND POCKETS!! im not sure why, but the cute little pockets on it really make me smile. Kalico was so great, she Lara and i spent nearly 10 hours the sunday before trying to get all our corsets done - unfortunately i dont think we got any of them finished that night, but it was fun tymes regardless.  i spent many more hours making a 6ft tail coat, waste coat, and top hat for stilting the show :) i was suffeciently pleased with their outcome. The ball went well, aside from the minor set bak of spraining my ankle the first night, during the first set :-/. it all worked out.

a week ot two prior to that isaac and i put up a new aerial silk in the warehouse - bringingin the  total to 3 silks, one trapaze and an aerial hoop that visits on occasion :). and i have to say, i thought i was in pretty good shape, until i was hanging 25ft up by a rock climbing harness on a rope that i was certain would break at any moment, waiting for autumn to re-rig the new silk on the ground...and then i worked out with Autumn for another 2 hours. i was dead by the end of it. ouch.

We had an ""eddie izzard night"" a few weeks ago; while i was giving a tour of the warehouse to some  friends i heard from the other room  a *snap*, followed by an ""oh fuck!"", and a boom... expecting to see isaac dead, i instead walked in on our 20 in. TV laying in pieces on the ground, as it had falllen to its death from the 25ft high platform on which it had formally rested. a cable had broken while isaac was getting the DVD player down. Fortunately we had anticipated it's possible sudden decent, and had marked on the ground a large 'X', where we expected it to fall. it landed dead in the center... :)  - don't linger on any ominous ""X's"" around the warehouse; they're probably there for a reason ;)

i ran into a girl i met at Dickens who does alot of swing dancing. she was suggesting some schools/venues in the area and i think i'm going to get together with her in the near future and start swing lessons. i've been trying to make it out to waltze lessons as well, but i've been a bit busy performing, or preping for shows. i don't tihnk i have anything coming up, so hopefuly i can fit classes in.

Feb. is full though, And One is playing, also De/Vision, Elliot's show, Meat, Emit later in the month, Pantheacon....it'll be great.

Oh, and Paul Mercer- my favorite violinist- showed up at the Edwardian Ball and played backing music for our performance, that was great. he invited me to some other things he had going on while in the area. i also ran into some of the Rosin Coven people there, the singer (whom i'd not met before, and who's name i can't recall at the moment :p) started talking to me while i was doing a demonstration at the Dark Garden booth and mentioned a few shows they were planning for later in the month, i might make it to one or two of them if i can find tyme.

oh, and my first absynth batch should be ready by pantheacon. that'll be fun.

I think if i can find tyme and money, i'm going to start taking fencing lessons again at the UC...i played with a friend the other day and remembered why i used to do it so much.

thats the last month or so...i think there were other bits of interesting things, but i can't recall them at the moment; and if i told you everthing now, how would i tell you about something amazing later?
;)
hehehehe


I recomend the movie ""Primer"" by the way; it's a bit B-side, but its low budget state almost lends itself to feel of the plot."

"event","i was at a really great lounge saturday, watching a guy i performed with at Sigil play some funeral lounge/dark ambient, etc. i quite like his music. anyways, it was one of the best 'venues' ive been to, asthetically, and had some great people. a few of them i encountered again at death guild last night(i hadn't been since burning man, it was wonderful to go dancing:) and we're supposed to be getting together later in the week to discuss some performances coming up.

i'll be doing the exotic ball with isaac and sophia, which i was rather hesitant to commit to; the ball has the worst reputation i've ever heard, especially among performers. but after that there's a show almost every weekend i'll be working on. the stage isaac and i stole a few weeks ago wants us to perform with them again- shadow circus. also a set i'm helping organize some music for, a set with Ksea and anastasia, and some dark garden show i'll probably be helpng with...i sort of got thrown into this performance thing, but it's working out. isaac and i put together a show in 10 mins that took the stage for the evening, it sort of gives me a confidence in the possability for this to work out.

and HP is filming a commercial in our warehouse today and tomorrow...means half our warehouse is taken up by cameras, stands and wardrobe; but they were talking about wanting some fire/contacting  for another set. i guess being in an HP commercial could be fun. get free food and a few hundred dollars out of it aleast. :p"

i want to look through your eyes. and then i think i'd like to see inside your head. but then there would be no mystery in you. or maybe there would be more. ""before you idolized me as a god, i was me"" if i didnt know, i'd think you werent real.

it's one of those things where words dont work. you're just. surreal. you carry yourself differently. when i look in your eyes, it's like looking into a misty forest. there's so much hiding, but it's blocked off. lol, i dont know. you seem like you could dissapear any second if you wanted to.

"event","And the magus is Love, and bindeth together That and This in His Conjuration.

The formula of Tetragrammaton is the complete mathematical expression of Love. its essence is this: any two things unite, with a double effect; firstly, the destruction of both,  accompanied by the ectasy due to the relief of the strain of seperateness; secondly, the creation of a third thing, accompanied by the ecstasy of the realisation of existence, which is Joy until with development it becomes aware of its imperfection, and loves.
....There is then little indeed in common between Love and such tepid passions as regard, affection, or kindliness; it it the uninitiate, who, to his damnation in a hell of cabbage coup and soap-suds, confuses them.
-ja, so says Frater Perdurabo.

Pantheacon was amazing. Spiritually refreshing, giving a second wind almost, remotivating, the entire wokd went on pause for 3 long days, and it left yet stream trails into the other world. i think that phrase 'other world' has a bit of a haunting connotation, more accurately describes this everyday world. I wish this world would bear more a semblance to the other. That factor, more than any other, angers me to no end with the humans... they can't just let themselves rise, they must torment themselves, then cast the switch into someone elses hand. Not even the latter part so much, if you're going to blame some one else, atleast rise above them, especially when the oppertunity lies right before you (as a race). ""All of this happened because one man had the capability and failed to actualize it."" this is going somewhere i didn't plan.
 i feel like a jewish Hermeticist (lol, thats alot of saving)with a vision of how much better the wold could be....but i think for now the only thing i can do is help  myself, i tihnk i need to spend some tyme concentrating there. I think pantheacon made me realize how much i don't knoe. at the tyme it was crushing, like a ship loosing it's rutter and compass, but i think in the long run it helped me realize where i need to spend more tyme. Never thought i would run into Lon Duquette either,let alone talk to him, he had a bit of an odd vibe, not sure what to think of it right now. Never thought i would like dancing, but, the trance dance was amazing. The drum circles were greeeeat, maybe one of my favorites. I look foreward to seeing many of those people again next year, annual friends perhaps, Never got to say goodbye to Thorn....
 Star dancingly amazing...."

"event","I finished Watson's book, Solitary Practical Magic. Not the greatest accomplishment, as i'd read most of it before, though i didn't finish it due to her distasteful writing style. This tyme through i didn't have so much trouble with her constant praise of Murry Hope, interesting, as i grew so tired of hearing that woman's name i didn't finish the book the first tyme.... interesting how things change so much like that. constant revolution, evolution, and adaptation are quintessential to the progression of all things, as so soon as anything reaches it's zenith, it begins to fall apart, but it all seems so different now.... I remember a tyme that had a very distinctive scent in the air, litteraly, when i could feel so much better than i can now, i feel like a condle next to what i used to be. The worst of it is that i knoe i could have it back, and more, if only i did it, but i don't, and i don't knoe why....perhaps the human is winning, weakness.

"event","I realize there are many things i need to do. Things you've been telling me to do for a long tyme, things i've been whispering in my ear for much longer than could be calculated on a simple abicus...My excuse? i don't have one. would justification justify the action, or lack thereof??? I need tyme to think.
  so a few hundred year ago some people, rather intellegent people conjued up this demon by name of 'logic.' Now this beast be damned as it has ravished the minds of many, in lands near, and far. But o! Fear you not! these men were none of magical calibre, rather simple men, mortal men, therefore their demon must be vanquishable! Yes, stab it with your steel and knives, send it bak from whence it came! you try so hard, why do you not end your madness now,before it ravishes another.
 I believe people often create complications in their own lives, so as to help them deal with their normal lives, more easily. i think if people relaxed, the river would flow far more easily, and their lives would better itself. i do not propose a life of non action, just embrace the Tao....easy, no?

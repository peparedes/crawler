"event","That big Christmas gift that I got is still here we hang out all the time and he stays over almost everynight.  I do not know if it is that he is lonely and wants someone to talk to or if he is really interested.  We went to see Spanglish last night and it was OK.  I fell asleep (oops). I still want to go see Phantom of the Opera.  He asked me last night a kinda serious question..  What would I do if my bf decided that he was going to move?  Would I follow him?  Would we break up?  I told him that I did not know because my ex did come with me when I moved to Florida.  We were in a serious relationship and it was what we decided on.  I think it would depend on my feelings at the time and the commitment that we were talking about.

I signed up for the Discovery Health total fitness package this week.  Woo Hoo!!  It starts on Jan 15th.  Aimee, Jenn, Bonnie and Darin are signed up also.  More people to go with.  I will be one hot hunk by this summer!!  

I started my 401k plan on Thursday.  35.00 a week right now.  not bad.  Disney will match up to 4% so I am getting a total of 10%."

"event","I went to South Beach with Greg and Jeremy this week.  I had a great time!! I slept most of the way down there.  The beachside hotel that we stayed at, Days Inn Art Deco, is in the heart of South Beach on Collins Ave. We picked up our keys, took the elevator up and were blown away by the mildew smoking musk smell we found. We went to our room but Jeremy and Greg could not open the door.  After we switched rooms I took a shower (interupted by someone) then we had a few drinks and walked around town for the rest of the night.  There was not much going on Monday so after a few hours of sightseeing we went back to the hotel and went to bed. *w/J*  We woke up the next morning (in our room) and went to the Vizcaya Museum.  The place,  the decor and the amenities in this house that were from the early 1900s was awe inspiring.  We left there and went to a mall and to dinner.  Went home finished all of the alcohol and hung out for a few hours then went out for the evening.  Got home about 2am went to sleep,  woke up at 6 got packed and came home.  I had a great time and can not wait to go back again"

"event","If I go crazy then would he be there to hold my hand?  Prob not.  You see... He does not know that I think he is hot.  He walked into my office today to return some things.  HE COULD HAVE STAYED!!!  He hints around but there is one problem that would stop it all I think.  He is my manager.  I would transfer in a New York minute.  If it is meant to be then it will be.  Oh well I can continue to dream.  AHHHH."

"event","This is my first entry.  I am 21 and single.  how depressing!!  
Monday: I was with my friend Mike at the Studios.  It was the first time I have been on Tower and Coaster since I had transfered to Admin Support.  We stopped by Commissary and talked to Todd D, then went to see Spectacle of Lights.  I had a great time that night.
Tuesday Night:  I was with my friend Mike again and we went to Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party.  It was soo cold but I had a great time.  I was a little tired but it was worth it.  No lines anywhere, free Hot Chocolate and Cookies.  We were in Fantasyland for Wishes,  the wind was blowing the ""smoking"" shells to the area right in front of us.  They had to cut out half of the ending because it was getting to dangerous.  Cool.  
Wednesday: SICK
Thursday:  Went to work that morning then went out to DTD to pick up a few things for some friends.  Ended up going to Pleasure Island, met up with Mike, hung out in Mannequins for a few hours and also watched the 12:10 show at Comedy Warehouse.
Friday:  Still working on that!!"

"event","okay i know i have been posting some, shall we say, dark posts recently. things arent really that bad, i just seem to only post when im in a down mood, and this is no exception. 

you know what like, real fear is? its not something that makes you scream, its not something that repulses you, that you cant face. real fear is something that follows you through night and day, good and bad, and though you know how stupid it is, its always there. i have a real fear. as im sure everyone does. every one of you has a feeling rising in your heart right now, thats the fear. your seeing flashbacks, or maybe just a feeling you cant place, but you feel it because i know, if your human, my words will hit home with you. 

Here is a story, here is my fear.

well, the night she....(she didnt die, im not using different terms, it was a drawn out death shall we say and obviously she means my sister, if you dont know the story you probably shouldnt be reading this) went to the hospital, so the last night she was concious. she went to bed, it wasnt anything bad, she went to bed. and i never said goodnight, i never told her i loved her, i didnt think it mattered. and i never got to tell her again. im not afraid of the night for myself, im afraid of it for those i love. if you dont say those protecting words, simple but powerful words the night takes away everything you care about. i wrote before once, that i feel i am a warrior, i fight everyday for those i love. i would accept my death for one of my loved ones protection. but nothing makes a warrior (even a self-proclaimed one) pain more than to be unable to protect those he loves. my weapon is love. i protect my loved ones with my heart. but tonight.... i didnt get to tell jill goodnight, or that i love her. i know she probably was just asleep when i called. or her parents were talking to her. and dont for a second think this is jills fault because its not. i just have this fear. it defies logic, and it seems nothing i do will displace it, but i have to some day. i must get rid of it. and when i see the opportunity, i will be rid of it forever."

"event","lets me say this. 


I have a lot of...shall we say, extra people surrounding me, that i dont need there. maybe its the mood im in, but im finding that, some people i used in the past (for me, the term ""used"" means i helped them, which made me feel more secure in myself, its not a bad ""using"" but its ""using"" nonetheless) are no longer neccessary to be present in my life. i feel very solitary. a person who i considered a best friend, has now been semi-downgraded in my mind. i just dont know about people anymore. the only person who, time after time, seems to be (stealing a term from cheryl) ""Real"" is jill. and shes just...i dont know. im just really confused about people. i just dont want to have one ""real"" person out there, and let alone that person be my girlfriend. she has to be that, she can be nothing else, but i would also really like a true friend, someone i can be very close to, and not have the little discrepincies that come with a relationship. this by no means infers i want to break up with jill. no no no, wrong wrong wrong. im just saying, i wish that i had more than just one person to turn to when things go bad. and i can think of certain people who may respond to this. think. think really hard. you'll know if i have shown you even a sliver of who i really am. if i have let a crack in my uter defenses so you can peek in. you know who you are. im just wondering if i can recognize you as being Real."

Who floats in silence.
Every night, 
he is a ghost in the darkness,
a ripple through darkened waters.
His age is endless,
for age is irrelevant.
He was there,
back when it was a plain.
He drifted there, night after night,
and everynight, he would feel.
He didn't know what he felt,
but he would feel it every night.
And every night, he would let a single tear fall,
this tear, falling by parted lips,
uttering ""It's not enough.""
A single tear.
Every night.
And every tear.
Drop by drop.
Became a river.
And when the river was full.
He drifted somewhere else.
So that every night.
Till the next was done.
He would drift out.
And drop a single tear.
""It's not enough.""
Forever."

I talked about Margie, Ellie, Annalee, Sarah, Jill. He would listen to my problems. We played games. Chess, backgammon, checkers, othello. Dr. Robbin's would always tell me how he used to get his money in college by betting on backgammon. How to win, its better to have luck than skill. How we made a backgammon bet one time, and he said i had been the closest person ever to beating him. every game we would play, first he would beat me. then slowly, i would get it. i would win, time and time again. even in backgammon, lady luck had found a new successor (though i admit, that game was more difficult to win at comparatively). he was paid to talk to me i know. but when i told him that i thought, despite i enjoyed his company, that i think i can handle without him. i said ""I know you were paid to talk to me, but I really appreciated the fact that I could be open with you."" and he said ""I may have been paid, but if you ever need my help, all you have to do is pick up the phone and call me. And I would prefer if you did sometime, just to keep in touch."" as i left, i told him. one of these days, we'd have to play a backgammon tournament for money. this time i wouldn't lose.

"event","Have you ever felt pure rush? let me tell you, there is nothing like narrowly avoiding death in rain weather with hurricanes whipping around you going 90 mph down 495. holy shit that ruled. i know im being reckless cause im depressed and numb, but key word being numb. i feel nothing and am everything, everywhere. if only i didnt feel so alone. oh well, i suppose rush can solve that too in time. just need to chat with friends, let the feelings i have out and let all be done and said in the end. So as a reason for the craziness, Jill and i broke up. this time for good. despite the fact she verbally broke us up, i would have done it if she hadnt. granted i think my mouth and mind were on two different levels, but if it came to it, im sorry dear, i was done. i love you, i really do. but i cant. and I NEED MORE MUSIC!!! MORE MUSIC AND MORE THINGS TO READ!!! FUCK!!! i have soo much free time because jasons girlfriend crashed his car and he has to pay off the guy under the table to not get in trouble, so he has to work all weekend. i realize that i have like, NO FRIENDS IN ARLINGTON!!! so im pretty much alone. oh fucking hell, i really need to find someone to race again. it was SOOO glorious. The Offspring ""Splinter"" playing, rain hitting my face (i had the windows and sunroof open), lightening forking all around, and me and a toyota camry ripping down Burke Lake Road at 80+. i sooo smoked him it was beautiful. i didnt think he was gonna race cause i passed him so easily from the stop light. but when i stopped accelerating, a few moments later, he came roaring past me. it was awesome ripping after him and waving as i passed. i had an experience which was actually more adrenaline pumping, but it wasnt racing, more just avoiding death. people need to signal. seriously. when a FUCKING TORNADO is going by, the least you can do is signal you lazy ass mofo SUV. could have completely destroyed my car by ramming it into the guard rails. anywho. ill probably say more later tonight. whatever i write i write i guess. but thanks to katie for being there, and actually i ate your pasta because my parents didnt really make me anything, so giving it to me was an awesome idea. thanks a bunch."

"event","I just got out of my bath. And i don't know if anyone cares, but i take really hot baths. in doing so i relax my body a lot and get a loose feeling before bed. But when i get out of the water, because its so hot, my arms and leg muscles bulge out a bit more. and to be honest, i like the look. it makes me feel like a mideval warrior or something. i used to think i knew what a warrior was. a warrior is someone with no ties to anyone, who would fight for justice and honor and peace and be a traveling hero. but i dont believe that anymore. i believe myself to be a warrior now. because a warrior doesnt just fight for ideals without an example, there is a reason for those to be in place. the warrior fights for those who support him to fight. i have two parents who would give me all the time in the world if i asked for it. my friend jason who (though can be a jerk sometimes) is one of the best listeners and pals a guy could ask for. i have my dog zack who, despite being a dog, is an added joy in my daily life reminding me to be happy when people get me down. and i have a girlfriend who i love and she loves me, that i would fight through the bowels of hell for. a warrior is someone who fights, its true, but they also nurture. because if they didnt, they wouldnt have that support to help them with the strength to fight. i thank everyone who gives me strength. you may not even know who you are, but i fight for you everyday.

I withdrew
And when you asked for light
I set myself on fire
And if I go far away I know
You'll find another slave

(chorus)
Cause now I'm free from what you want
Now I'm free from what you need
Now I'm free from what you are

And when you wanted blood
I cut my veins
And when you wanted love
I bled myself again
Now that I've had my fill of you
I'll give you up forever
And here I go far away
I know you you'll find another slave

(chorus)
Cause now I'm free from what you want
Now I'm free from what you need
Now I'm free from what you are

Then a vision came to me
When you came along
I gave you everything
But then you wanted more"

"event","well i had an experience. i get up at about 6:30 to go play golf at 7:35 with my dad and grandpa. i didnt really have any breakfast so i bought a mountain dew at the club house so i could wake up. i only had a gulp before i realized it was Diet mountain dew, and if i can bearly swallow the original stuff, ill be damned to drink the diet. so we start to play and i realize that ever time i take a swing, i get this blinding pain in my stomach. i think to myself ""Great that damn Dew is eating away at my frickin stomach."" So i'm gonna try and play the 9 holes back to the club house and get a sandwich to absorb the mountain dew. but eating the sandwich only made things worse. soon every shot i took i had to concentrate with all my strength on not passing out/falling over. and when my last drive (a shocking 250 some yard, feet whichever) actually made my back leg buckle from pain, i decided to stop playing. but dad was unwilling to go back, so i decided i'd just drive the golf cart since it didnt really hurt much sitting down. that was at 10:30. then at 11, sitting was causing my vision to blur because i couldnt focus on anything but the pain in my stomach. im dreamily thinking of going home and getting mylanta, because i assume this is just the worse acid reflux imaginable. but once i got home (finally) and did take mylanta, and it didnt do ANYTHING, i began to worry. i lay in bed shaking and spasming in pain trying to watch Family Guy on from my laptop DVD player to distract me. and when that didnt work, i called the one person who i believed might make me feel a little bit better. I called Jill. i think i was delirious, im not sure i dont remember much besides pain, but talking to her helped for a little while. but i was having difficulty keeping my mind in focus, and she began to figure (at least i imagine this) that i was worsening and told me to goto the hospital because i thought i made need to have my appendix removed. so i tell my parents that the hospital is beginning to look real nice. this is at about 1:30ish. so ive been like this for over 5 hours. i figured my time of ""waiting to see if it will just go away"" was over. we goto the hospital and wouldnt you know it, the pain starts subsiding. by the time im getting the sonogram im feeling almost pain free. but by describing to my doctor what happened, he gave me a diagnoses. apparently i have something called Biliary Cholehic. which basically meant that my gal bladder started spasming/shutting off and with that started effecting my whole digestive system, as it is all connected. which would explain why when i ate the sandwich i felt worse. this whole experience showed me im not invincible. which is a good lesson to learn. so im gonna try and tone some things down and think about taking care of myself everyonce in a while. *shrug* guess things need to happen. 

P.S. this happened 2 days ago. im absolutely fine now. so no worries people, if you had any."

Okay, My friend Aaron who now lives in egypt goes out of his way to write this email telling me whats going on in his life.

wow dear. im truely impressed. 

but now im back in a funk. true love. that doomed thing. there is lots of love. and all of it can be ended. all of it. or at least, physically. and believe me as humans are physical beings that means a lot. I love my sister. I miss her too. i dont like to talk about her and i guess i dont very much. But i'm admitting i love her. I miss her too. She is physically gone. Not in my heart i guess but physically. So this leads me to be paranoid about Jillian leaving me. Physically leaving me. maybe its stupid and maybe im wrong, maybe im right, but you know what, its a feeling that i'll never be rid of as long as i feel this terrible pain. and i will never be rid of that."

Maybe its because im moving beyond the ""love"" i had been semi-familar with and have moved to....well it can only be called beyondlove. Beyondlove is odd to me. i havent experienced it in a romantic sense. i didnt dream about it as i had in the past about love love. i thought romeo and julliet were fools but let me have a taste of their lust/love and ill be satisfied (for a time). i didnt dream about ""sitting reading the paper"" love, or ""just be on the phone, not neccessarily talking but being there"" love, i would NEVER have assumed ""angry at each other"" love. i dont understand any of this at this point. and its hard to grasp onto it. there is that giddish hype about seeing my loved one (duh, jillian) but i also have the ....well i guess it would be called married love. the love where it's jillian, i am happy to see her, and i do yearn when she leaves me, but its okay to watch her go cause she'll come back. i dont understand love. i had a grasp of it despite what i tried to tell people. i always wanted to appear niave and new to love but i could tell what was in store. just not feel it before hand. i dont understand this love. it feels rocky yet solid. like its about to fall apart yet its unbreakable. god im confused."

"event","Okay, the day started and ended oddly. i went to see Jill and i love her, we (sarah jill and I) walked 5 miles around Burke Lake and talked the whole time, and i had fun, but i started to be listless. i dont know if anyone noticed but my mind was sinking into a pit. the bright sunshine and cool breeze was only a mere whisper in my mind. i tried to be cheery and such, because sarah was there, (sorry sarah, im cant hide these things when its just jill) but i was really in the depths of despair. and once we got back, i suppose i could say jill's father was challenging me or trying to goad me. either way, (grumble) he did some things that knocked me into the present to think about what was important. which was i was here with jill, and she may not be okay, but i was going to make the best of it. it took energy, LOTS of energy, but i pulled it off. i would like to think i helped, maybe i didnt maybe i did but i tried my best and im not ashamed of the effort i put forth. but when i went home, or when i was going home, i rolled all windows down, and tried to outrace my depression behind me. i couldnt do it, it was right there in my head, but for brief moments when i heard the roar of the engine, the whistling of the wind, the blare of the heavy metal in my CD player, i forgot i was depressed at all. that something i cant address anymore was troubling me. when i got home i sat and watched About A Boy, second time in 2 days. when my dad got here, i said hi, and he knew something was wrong. we talked. and.... im really glad he's my dad. i relate so well to him. and he told me exactly what i needed to hear with regards to my feelings towards jill. he told me, and im not exact yet ill use quotation marks ""I'm not here to tell you what to do with Jill, I'm not telling you to marry her or break up with her, but I know your 17 and smart enough to make the choice if, and I did this with your mother for 22 years (its their 22 year anni today), if its worth it to go through all the trouble, and if it is, then your truely gifted to have something so special, and that was what made me decide to marry your mother.""

I'm glad he said that, I don't feel so foolish anymore I guess for thinking in certain ways."

"event","So, last night was my last homecoming as a high school student. The dance was a lot of fun. In fact, i think it was the best one yet. I loved my outfit last night. I wore a gray and black shirt with gray and black shoes a gray and black blazer gray cargo pants and a grey hat. I also wore the flower that sara got me. Sara, kyle, and Courtney all came to my house before the dance to take pictures. After that, we went to the dance. Everyone was so pretty there. Kat and mel both had beautiful dresses, as did everyone else. We spent most of our time with mel clinton and all their friends. The person i kinda like was there with someone else, so i was a little sad, but got over it quick. We danced the whole time. To my surprise, the music was actually pretty good. Kyle wanted to leave early, but i would not let him. After the dance we went to my house to wait for doug. Once he got their we went to steak n shake. We ate pretty fast and went back to my house. We watched tv ate jumped on each other for most of the night. Oh ya, we took rick(a.k.a. ricardo) out to eat with us and back to my house to spend the night too. When I woke up sara and kyle were already gone. Everyone else went home at about 1 or 2. I'm really going to miss homecoming. Its one of the only school things i like. Well, i hope you all had a good time too. Good night:-)"

I love someone very much right now, but im starting to think my feelings are one sided. I really want to make this work out. I feel like i always come last, and really neglected.

Friday, I spent the whole day packing for my Model UN conference. Around 3, I drove up to Central and met up with everybody and we all went to the Double Tree Hotel. When we got there, we picked up all our information and went to our rooms. Me and Kyle were roomies. After that we went down for dinner and then had committee meetings. My committee was very good. I was Denmark. Me and Katie Fanning got along very good because she was Israel and we talked bad about Muslim's. After our meetings that night, we all went to a karaoke party. Me and Brent ordered a pizza. It was good. It was cool, all the Central people sang We Are Family and Lady Marmalade, except for Kyle M. cuz he was no fun. Me and this dude from SLUH sang The Cheers theme. Kyle Gunning did karaoke too. It was funny. At 12, we had to go to bed. Kyle is very hard to room with. I think he was upset with me because I took a shower at 3 in the morning and blow-dried my hair. He kept getting after me because I left the lights on and he said it kept wasting energy. Saturday morning, Kyle got up and started ironing his clothes very early. Then when I was getting ready at the sink, he said I shouldn't keep the water on because it was wasting water. That pissed me off. After that, we went down to breakfast. I sat with Ashley and Patty. Nobody knew where Derrick was so we went up to his room to try and wake him up. Derrick was still asleep so we left him and went to our committee's. After awhile they sent someone up to get Derrick because he was very very late. My group came up with lots of good resolutions. Our committee's went for a very long time and around 3 we met and presented what everyone made. There were many good ideas. After that it was time to go home. It was a lot of fun and I really miss it. Now I have a scary Danish Nationalist Pride. Hopefully that runs out in a few days. As soon as I got home from that me and my parents left to go to Springfield, Illinois. In Springfield, we stayed in this very big expensive hotel. It was very nice. On Sunday, we got up and went to the Lincoln Presidential Library. It was very fun and educational. We spent the whole day there. After that, we went out to eat at Red Lobster. I got a big crab and it was good. After that, we went back to our hotel and went to bed. This morning, we got up early and packed up our stuff and went to the Illinois State Capital Building. We got a private tour and went to the Senate and House of Representatives. After we left there, we drove through a grave yard for about a hour. We saw Lincoln's tomb. Then we started home. I got home about 2 hours ago and now I'm really bored. I really really don't want to go to school tomorrow. I talked to Pooky a lot this weekend and I think we're going to try again."

After school, Sarabell came over for awhile and we exchanged Valentine's Day stuff. I've been watching the olympics tonight. Next time they have the winter olympics, I am going to go there and rape figure skaters. They are so fucking hot. Tata."

Saturday morning, I was supposed to go to the mall with DJ but he couldn't. :-( Then I had to go to work at 4 and it really sucked. Today was also pretty boring. I went to my little cousin Aiden's first birthday party. No one talked to me so it kinda sucked. One of my friends was sad today, so I'm kind of sad too."

The rest of the day was good but still pretty slow. After school i met up with DJ, and we went to tact. We had a election to pick a president and vice president for next year. I voted for DJ. In the end emma and tracie tied. In the tie breaker emma won by a landslide(even tracie's girl friend voted for emma). After the meeting, me, DJ, mex, audrey, and this one girl whos name i forgot all went to audrey's house. It was a lot of fun. We jumped on her trampoline ,and made mac and cheese. At about seven, my mom picked me and DJ up. When we got to his house, his parents had me and my mom come in and talk for awhile. After that, me and my mom started home. Me and my mom had a big fight on the way home. I think things are ok now, but it still messed up my night. But who cares.....Love ya all lots."

"event","This weekend was fun. On friday sara, sarah, and i all went to the mall. We all got a lot of stuff. I was so freaking happy. We met the lead singer from losers luck, and got his cd, so that was pretty awesome. Ryan and some of his friends were there too, so that pretty cool too. I love the mall so much. It made me so happy. Saturday night was really cool too. Sara, doug, kyle, and i went all over. First, we went to los fientes for tacos. They were ok(there was green things in mine). After that, we went to target. I got the notebook on dvd(don't ask). We also played in the toy section(weeeee). There was this dude with really cool hair. I wanted to try and get a picture to take to my hair lady, but he ran to fast. I stole sara's maxi pad, and stuck it on the back of a children's book. That should make some stupid little kid grow up a little faster. After we were done at target, we started out for my house. My mom would not let us come inside, so me and doug played animal crossing in his car. Today was pretty boring. I sat on the couch all day watching lifetime movies. At 3:30 i started out for work. Work went pretty fast. I was a little slow today, so i had to rush at the end. After work me, mom, and grandma went to olive garden for dinner. It was very good. I really don't want to go to school tomorrow, but at least its a short week. Well, see you all tomorrow."

Me, sarah, and amanda went outside and amanda slipped on the ice. She was ok, so it was kind of funny. After that, sara and kyle came to my house. Saturday was a waste. I went to work, and it was hard. After work i came home and tried to get some body to go with me to the mall, but no one wanted to, so i ended up just sitting at home. Sunday night was pretty good. Kyle, mel, sam, and i all went to mills at 7:30 to see a movie. When we got there, we found that all of the movie started at like 10 or 11. All the stores where closed since it was sunday, so we had nothing to do. We ended up going to family video and renting house of wax. When we got home, i lost the dvd. We finally found it after a very long time, but when we put it in, it did not work. We ended up just renting it on the tv. After the movie we took everyone home. Today i have done nothing. Such a great way to spend a day off."

But i remembered mrs. miller talking about how next time we buy something we need to think about how we could have put that money to better use. Damn school its ruining my fun already. But its ok. By next weekend i should be back to my old big spender ways. After all of that, we came bake to my house. It was great fun. I made everyone watch the golden girls. At about 11:45, everyone left.

I have brenn, and emma in it, but i still think i may try to switch into ms. horner's class(still have to explain emo to her). I like my math teacher. The only problem is that i'm like one of the only white people. I sit by this one girl that i went to grade school with, so its ok. My history class is pretty good. I sit by megan eye. I'm a little scared of the teacher. I think she maybe a notebook nazi. I love my economics class. Its really small. I don't really know anyone in it, but everyones really nice. Mrs. miller called me a good little marxist today so i felt loved. My lunch is also good. Sara, sarah amanda, alex, and dan are all in it. Band has got a little better too. Nina and april got moved into it so that was all good. I REALLY MISS LAST SEMESTER. This one just dosn't seem as fun as last one. I'm kind of sad."

There were things rangeing frow days of sopping, the joys of christmas, and being with the people dearest to me, to the loss of a dear family friend. I really am not ready to go to school tomorrow. I am really worrid about my classes and lunch. But who knows, things just may work out."

"event","Wow. I can't believe its 2006 already. Where has all the time gone? It seems like i was just a little boy celebrating 1995 not that long ago. Some times it seems like we are just growing up way to fast. Next new years eve will be my last one before college. I really don't know what waits for me after that. I guess we just all have to take life as it comes. We only get one shot, so why not live it to the fullest without regrets. I will miss this last year greatly. It came with its share of sorrows, but it also had many joys. I also think that this has been a year of much growing for me(mainly because of the sorrows). I am trying to look at this next year with optimism. I know that its going to be filled with trials. But i also know that we can all pull through, because we all have each other to rely on. I have been blessed with some of the best, most supportive friends in the world. For this i am truly grateful.
.....In closing, i just want to wish you all a happy, and healthy new year. Live it up for all its worth."

While my grandma got her perm, me and mom looked at some of the stores around the hair cut place. We had to go to the dollar general next door to get a cheap bucket to make water in to put in my fish tank(yoshi and bubbles have very little water in the tank). While we were there, i found the first dvd of tenchi muyo and tenchi universe for three dollars each. I was very happy because those were two of my favorite shows when i was in grade school. After we finished there, we walked over to belts to look at the fish and stuff(pet stores are fun). After that we picked up grandma and went to the villa to get my paycheck. When i got there, i found that they were not ready, and i would have to come back later. After that, we went to dairy queen. We finished up there, and went back to the villa to get my check. After we cashed my check, we went home. That night, i went out to eat with doug, sara, and kyle. After that, we went to the book store and another pet store. Then I came home."

My fifth hour final(english) was great. Ms Horner brought in bread co. stuff, and orange juice, and milk, and coffee. It was really cool. The final was really easy. After we finished, me, dan, and ryan all played mario kary ds. I got my ass beat, but oh well. My sixth hour(band) was really east. We didn't have a final so we watched elf, and messed around. After that I went home. Almost as soon as i got home, dan came and picked me up to go to his party at mills. Me, dan, ryan, matt D, and this one guy all went. we could ride the car thingies and play laser tag as much as we wanted. It was alot of fun. After that, i came home, and went almost right to my work party. Me, sara, and doug went(doug was our guest). After awhile, Leigh ann, and tim came. A little bit later, erica and her boy friend showed up. It was pretty cool. We all got presents, and free food. After the party, doug dropped me and sara off at my house. We left from there to go to the mall. Most of our time at the mall was spent talking to kaylee in gnc. We saw some candy in the food court, so that was all good. After that we both went home.

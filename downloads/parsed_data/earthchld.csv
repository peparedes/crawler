because love to me is the world, it is all around me, and you can ingore it if you please, but inside you really know that everything you are is everything you wish you weren't.

<P><FONT color=#ffff99><STRONG>PREAMBLE</STRONG>: The Rules listed below apply to the calling of <B>SHOTGUN</B> (referring to the passenger seat) in an automobile. These Rules are definitive and binding.<BR><BR><B><I>Section I</I>: The Basic Rules</B> <BR><B>Article 1</B>: In order to call Shotgun, the caller must pronounce the word ""Shotgun,"" verifiable by the driver. <BR><B>Article 2</B>: Shotgun may only be called if all occupants of the vehicle are outside and directly on the way to the said vehicle. <BR><B>Article 3</B>: Early calls are strictly prohibited. Shotgun may only be called while walking toward the vehicle and only applies to the drive immediately forthcoming. Shotgun can never be called while inside a vehicle or still technically on the way to the first location. For example, one can not get out of a vehicle and call Shotgun for the return journey. <BR><B>Article 4</B>: The driver has final say in all ties and disputes. The driver has the right to suspend or remove all shotgun privileges from one or more persons. <BR><B>Article 5</B>: An optional rule, stating that before Shotgun may be called, the vehicle must be in sight of the Driver and/or Caller. <BR><BR><B><I>Section II</I>: Special Cases</B><BR>These special exceptions to the above rules should be considered in the order presented; the case listed first will take precedence over any of the cases beneath it, when applicable. <BR><B>Article 1</B>: In the instance that the normal driver of a vehicle is drunk or otherwise unable to perform their duties as driver, then he/she is automatically given Shotgun. <BR><B>Article 2</B>: If the instance that the person who actually owns the vehicle is not driving, then he/she is automatically given Shotgun, unless they decline. <BR><B>Article 3</B>: In the instance that the driver's spouse, lover, partner, or hired prostitute for the evening is going to accompany the group, he/she is automatically given Shotgun, unless they decline. <BR><B>Article 4</B>: In the instance that one of the passengers may become so ill during the course of the journey that the other occupants feel he/she will toss their cookies, then the ill person should be given Shotgun to make appropriate use of the window. <BR><B>Article 5</B>: In the instance that only one person knows how to get to a given location and this person is not the driver, then as the designated navigator for the group they automatically get Shotgun, unless they decline. <BR><B>Article 6</B>: In the instance that one of the occupants is too wide or tall to fit comfortably in the back seat, then the driver may show mercy and award Shotgun to the genetic misfit. Alternatively, the driver and other passengers may continually taunt the poor fellow as they make a three-hour trip with him crammed in the back.<BR><BR><B><I>Section III</I>: The Bastard Rules </B><BR><B>Article 1</B>: If the driver so wishes, he/she may institute the <B>Bastard Rules</B> on the process of calling Shotgun. In this case all rules, excepting that of <B><I>Section I</I>, Article 4</B>, are suspended and the passenger seat is occupied by whoever can take it by force. <BR><B>Article 2</B>: The driver must announce the institution of the Bastard Rules with reasonable warning to all passengers. This clause reduces the amount of blood lost by passengers and the damage done to the vehicle. Please follow the above rules to the best of your ability. If there are any arguments or exceptions not covered in these rules, the driver calls the shots, as stated in <B><I>Section I</I>, Article 4</B>.<BR><BR><B><I>Amendment I</I>: The Specific Amendment</B> <BR>Any person who wishes to claim shotgun must actually pronounce either the word ""<B>Shotgun</B>"". One <B>may not</B> say the name of a type of shotgun, such as ""<I>12 Gauge</I>."" If a passenger does, then he or she can lay no claim on shotgun, and may be called by another person.<BR><BR><B><I>Amendment II</I>: Eviction </B><BR>If the vehicle is forced to stop for a serious infraction of the Shotgunner, the Shotgunner must relinquish his/her seat, if the driver so wishes. Serious infractions have been known to include spilling any beverage, being annoying, breaking parts of the car, and in extreme cases, just being ugly.<BR><BR><B><I>Amendment III</I>: Navigator</B> <BR>The passenger who has shotgun MUST serve as Navigator. By this, he must watch out for signs and intersections that the driver may miss during the course of a road trip. The Navigator must also ask for directions out the window. <BR>It is also the responsibility of the passenger who has shotgun to take control of the radio and air conditioning, however the driver has final say over the settings. The other occupants of the car can also have an opinion. If the passenger with shotgun is caught forgetting their duties and makes the car listen to commercials and/or bad music, then his privilege can be lost. Of course, this is all in good judgement of the driver. As Navigator, the driver may also ask him to operate other devices such as the windshield wipers, and rear window defroster.<BR><BR><B><I>Amendment IV</I>: Australian Shotgun</B><BR>Originally from Australia, if two people tie for shotgun, then the first person to put their thumb on their head is awarded shotgun. If they both do this at the same time, then an immediate pissbolt (race) to the car is required.<BR><BR><B><I>Amendment V</I>: Five Minute Rule</B><BR>This rule, which originated in Massachusetts, states that in the event that the passenger riding shotgun leaves the car (ie: to get something from his house or a convenient store) is allowed 5 minutes in which to return and still retain his shotgun privilege. If he does not return within the time frame allotted, another passenger may take his place. However, other passengers <B>may not</B> intentionally delay the Shotgunner by moving the car, restricting the Shotgunners ability to return to the car, or otherwise.<BR><BR><B><I>Amendment VI</I>: Awnings</B> <BR>Once all passengers have exited through the final doorway on the way to the car, (provided the car is in view), they are considered outside and may call shotgun no matter what covering is overhead. This rule applies to all awnings, covered decks and all outdoor shelters. Garages are considered outside so long as the door is open.<BR><BR><B><I>Amendment VII</I>: The Race</B> <BR>Under this amendment, if there is a tie when calling shotgun, the first person who touches the car wins.<BR><BR><B><I>Amendment VIII</I>: Alternative Seats</B> <BR>In addition to Amendment XIII, anyone who wants to be duct-taped to the roof calls ""Mir!"" If a trunk is present in the vehicle, then this ""seat"" will hereby be recognized as ""Ex-Wife.""<BR><BR><B><I>Amendment IX</I>: Duel</B> <BR>In such a case where any present shotgun rules still causes confusion between two individuals, they may duel for the honor of Shotgun. This duel takes the form of one best-of-three series (and <B>only</B> one series) round of traditional <B>Paper, Rock, Scissors</B>.<BR><BR><B><I>Amendment X</I>: Chinese Sneak Attack</B> <BR>In the event that someone manages to touch the car's handle, and/or is in the car before anyone called shotgun, then they immediately receive the shotgun priviledge. However, this amendment does not apply to someone who ran to the vehicle in question in order to do so.<BR><BR><B><I>Amendment XI</I>: Broken Seat</B> <BR>In the event that the front passenger seat in the car is extremely uncomfortable (i.e. has a big hole in it), the passenger who called Shotgun must sit in that seat. The other passengers may ridicule him as they wish.<BR><BR><B><I>Amendment XII</I>: Secondary Passenger</B><BR>If a passenger is ""just along for the ride,"" then they must sit in the back seat (or worst seat, if the car is otherwise full), because the ride is not for them.<BR><BR><B><I>Amendment XIII</I>: Double Shotgun</B> <BR>This rule from Delaware states that if a given passenger calls a valid ""Shotgun"", then he or she may not say ""Shotgun"" again. By calling ""Shotgun"" a second time, he or she would automatically forfeit their seat and shotgun is reopened to the other passengers. Other passengers are allowed to try to trick the person who originally says ""Shotgun"" into saying it again, in order to claim shotgun for themselves.<BR><BR><B><I>Amendment XIV</I>: No Bitch</B> <BR>This rule states that once Shotgun has been called by one of the passengers, the remaining passengers may call, ""No Bitch."" The passenger who calls ""No Bitch"" last, or fails to call it at all, is forced to ride bitch.<BR><BR><B><I>Amendment XV</I>: Additional Navigator Duties</B> <BR><B>Article I</B>: The Shotgunner must possess the ability (and the will) to insult other drivers and be heard, if they deserve it (i.e. being cut off). This is to allow the driver to continue to operate the vehicle properly. <BR><B>Article II</B>: The Shotgunner must possess the ability (and the will) to roll down their window and invite any chicks in adjacent cars to the driver's destination.<BR><B>Article III</B>: It is the duty of the Shotgunner to spot all speed cameras and police cars that could pose a threat to the driver and car. If the vehicle is stopped because the Shotgunner failed in his duties, he may be banned from riding Shotgun for a period of time dictated by the driver.<BR><BR><B><I>Amendment XVI</I>: International Travel</B> <BR>When crossing the border into another country. All shotgun claims are void, and passengers may once again call shotgun. If another passenger gets it, the driver must pull over at his earliest and safest convenience.<BR><BR><B><I>Amendment XVII</I>: Context</B><BR>A passenger may only receive shotgun if he says shotgun within the context of calling shotgun. For instance, a passenger may not be awarded shotgun if he says, ""Did anybody call shotgun?,"" or if he/she was talking about a shotgun.<BR><BR><B><I>Amendment XVIII</I>: No Hump</B> <BR>Local to Toronto, ON (Canada), this rule is relevant if there are five passengers in a car that has only four seats. After a successful Shotgun call is made, the remaining passengers may call ""No Hump"" to avoid sitting on the hump between the two back seats. The individual failing to make the call, or the last person to make the call, must sit on the uncomfortable, ball-breaking hump. This is a much-feared ""seat"" to Camaro and Firebird passengers.<BR><BR><B><I>Amendment XIX</I>: Shotgun Suicide</B> <BR>If the Shotgun caller attempts to open the car door as it is being unlocked (thus causing it to stay locked), he immediately loses Shotgun priviliges for the upcoming ride, and a new round of calling Shotgun must be executed.<BR><BR><B><I>Amendment XX</I>: The Handicapped</B><BR><B><I>Section II</I>, Article 6</B> states that preferential shotgun treatment may be offered to anyone ""too wide or tall to fit comfortably in the back seat"". Preferential treatment should be awarded to the handicapped as well as to these genetic misfits, especially if the injury prevents them from achieving maximum leg room, maneuverability, etc. (as might be the case with a broken leg, foot, etc.) Unlike with <B><I>Section II</I>, Article 6</B>, however, the handicapped are not to be taunted as with the genetic misfits if not awarded shotgun. Otherwise, taunting is okay.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

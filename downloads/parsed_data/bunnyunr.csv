"event","I'm finally starting to feel better about things. Luckily after having someone break up with you three times, the third time you get over it pretty quickly. My classes aren't bothering (as much) with the exception of Spanish. However, I do feel incredibly overwhelmed. I forsee many a night at the library in the future. There's only five more weeks of classes. Isn't that odd? Then I will start Summer School. Mini-terming it this year too. Gotta get those classes out of the way. 

Anyway, as for my weekend, it was interesting. I went out on Friday and Saturday night. Friday was spent at XOXO Bar watching a bunch of bands play. I enjoyed myself (minus the creepy guy from Battle Mountain, NV who wouldn't leave me alone). I also found a boy I completely ADORE. He's the lead singer of one of the bands. We actually spoke (sort of) and he gave me his number. But we've only texted each other since then. I don't know what to think about that. I'm not putting any eggs in any basket, yet. But I'm hoping he will text me again, after all, I don't think he would have given me his number if he wasn't at all interested.

It's been a nightmare not having my car. It's incredibly irritating having to mooch rides off of people or worse -- be stuck at my awful house. I'm crossing my fingers and praying and doing some witch dances in hopes I'll be able to pick it up from Saturn today after class. 

Anyway, things are looking up... sort of."

"event","Spring Break is over. Now I'm sitting in the library waiting for my 9 AM class to start. To be completely honest I'm afraid of what my grades are going to look like this semester. I'm quite sure they will be dismal to say the least. I absolutely have to do something about my Spanish grade or I will surely fail the class. I really do have to get at least a passing grade on the next exam. It's really unfortunate how getting depressed and missing three days of school can really fuck a person over in college. I now know how that feels.

The past week was full of getting drunk, sleeping a lot, and not thinking one bit about what I needed to have done for any of my classes (except last night when I opened my notebooks and realized I had a ton of homework to do). I also drove to San Francisco with Nicole. After leaving the city my car decided to take a shit on me while we were crossing the Bay Bridge. It wouldn't go over 25 MPH and the RPMs kept jumping all over the place. I got off the freeway in Berkley and fought with my mother for an hour on the phone over what to do about the car. Luckily in the process of driving around Berkley the car started to drive again.

My car... one more thing to add to the list of shit I have to take care of and to be honest, don't want to. I have to take care of my speeding ticket (50 in a 40). Take my car to Saturn to get it checked out. Take my laptop to the Geek Squad so they can (maybe) get rid of all the Trojan viruses on it. My rabbit has an eye infection and needs to go to the vetrinarian (God knows how much that will cost me). Oh, also I have to fix my dismal standings in all my classes. Plus I need to learn how to live like a normal person again since I basically didn't all spring break.

I really wanted to go home for Easter. I needed it really bad. But alas my plans were dashed away from me once again. Apparently the restaraunt I work at is OPEN on Easter Sunday. Isn't that ridiculous? And of course, I am scheduled to work. I cried and cried last night on the phone with my Mom because I can't go home. Now she's getting me a flight to Vegas for the weekend AFTER Easter. I just need to figure out how to get along until then."

"event","It's official. I had to actually go to his house and force him to talk to me, but... at least I have closure now. I feel pretty jaded. I feel like it's not worth it. It's not fair to love someone so deeply to have them look you in the eye and say they're not willing to make it work. To have them tell you your personality just doesn't jive with theirs... and that that makes them not want to be with you. It's pretty bad when they say you're just not on the same level as them. And then to have them tell you they have too many other things in their life that are, and will be more important than you.

I tried, and failed once again. I just couldn't make it work. I couldn't open myself up to another person enough once again. I don't really think I will ever be able to. I guess I'm selfish with my thoughts and feelings. I want them all to myself. Perhaps it was always doomed from that night we started talking to each other after the band camp party. Maybe this was two years that I needed to learn that I simply am uncapable of being in a relationship with someone. That I can't express myself and I can't open up. Maybe I'll always be that way... but can I do anything about it? I don't know.

It's going to suck. And I know he isn't going to call me. He won't say anything to me now. We won't see each other... probably for a long time. And even if it is just passing each other on campus - that's all it will be. I'm not on Myspace anymore so there won't be any communication that way. Maybe it's better that way.

Thus begins the end. What now? Where to now? To be completely honest... I have an idea, but that is for my thoughts only... for now."

There's other stuff that lead up to this as well, but when the string ravels away and there's nothing left, who cares about all the wadded up nasty pieces? You don't. 

Here are the things I know for sure: I have five more rent payments due at my house and then I will be free. I WILL pay off all my debt by August 1st. I've deleted my Myspace and I will not ever be a member of that horrid contraption ever again. I still love my boyfriend.

Here are the things I'm not so sure about: Where and what I will be doing after I am free from my financial obligation to my house and roommates. If I will go to UNR (or school at all) next semester. If I intend to stay in Reno after my lease is up at my house. If I can bear to see the faces of all the people in the music department who warned me against or were completely happy to see me and my boyfriend back together. 

Here are the things I'm pretty sure about, but have lingering doubts: If I'm going to talk to him again. If we're ""officially"" broken up. I'm going to fail my Spanish class. I have no motivation to go to school. I cannot live in Reno anymore.

It's Spring Break in the land of UNR and all I really want to do is leave."

"event","Do you ever get that sinky feeling in your stomach? Like you just know something is really wrong? Or shit is about to hit the fan in a really bad way? I got that feeling today. It made me feel like I needed to puke, run away, be alone, be with somebody, and just made me feel really upset all at once. 

I spent yesterday in class, feeling pretty okay about stuff. Then I got to my Journalism class... and well, I just started going down hill. These girls were sitting by me talking about how they've been to Europe and have Coach bags, and they're going on a cruise for Spring Break. And here I am. In Reno... again. I don't have money to go to Mexico for Spring Break. In fact... I'm working during Spring Break. I can't AFFORD to take an entire week off to go do whatever the hell I want.

After class I went to Bully's and sat in front of a keno machine and lost $35. Really good, huh? Then I drove around Reno, and then I drove to Carson City. I contemplated driving further... but I knew it would be for nothing. Really... what was I going to do? Just keep driving? Leave everything behind? Then everyone would really think I was crazy. Really crazy. I drove back into Reno and went to Target, bought a new DVD and a new shirt... that made me feel better... for like 15 minutes. And since I was on that side of town I stopped in at Starbucks to see my boyfriend. I thought seeing him would make me feel better. Instead it made me feel worse. He just looked at me like I was some kind of freak. Like I shouldn't be there. I don't get it. Shouldn't someone be happy that their girlfriend comes in to see them at work? I understand he takes his job very, very seiously... but he was so lame he couldn't even say goodbye to me when I was walking out the door.

I did a whole lot of crying and a whole lot of thinking last night. About a lot of stuff. Then I woke up this morning feeling a little better. So I decided to come to school early and knock out a bunch of work (and an essay that's due tomorrow). Well, when I got to the library I just started feeling pooey. I checked my Myspace and realized my boyfriend had posted a blog (at 1:40 AM), which is odd because he told me he was working until 2 AM last night. HMMMMM. So that pissed me off. Then, what ticked me off even more is that the blog was set to private, and I couldn't view it. Is it really that big of a deal? Or am I blowing it way out of proportion? It just irritated me I guess. Instead of writing my essay I started having a meltdown... I even tried calling in to work (I work at 4...), but I couldn't get anyone to cover my shift. So it looks like I'll be going to work whether I want to or not.

After that I called my boyfriend and left him a message... and then, still being swayed by my craziness sadness I walked to the music department and sat... and waited. Waited for my boyfriend to get out of class. Mind you this was ay 11:45 AM and he gets out of class at 2:30 PM. Very clever of me, right? So I sat, and sat, and sat... and got weird looks from people I know, and they talked to me, and then came back an hour later... to still see me sitting there. *sigh*

On top of all of this my Grandma is doing REALLY bad. Oh, and my laptop is broken... well actually it has 4 trojan viruses on it. YAY! Boy... this just sucks. Sucks, sucks, sucks. 

I don't think I have a purpose in life. You know how some people know exactly what they want... they have an incredible passion or zest for... something. I just don't think I got it. Whatever it is. I feel like the character in the play that gets killed off in the first scene just for the dramatic effect and is never heard from again.

"event","I really think I need spring break. I really think some of my friends need it too. I think it's that slumpy time of spring semester. Everyone is buried in homework, we all work too much, and even if we do have some fun it seems way too short. Like this weekend... I saw my boyfriend on Friday afternoon and we had lunch at Chili's, but then he had to do percussion stuff all day on Saturday and then go to work at Starbucks from 8 PM - 2 AM.

Nicole and I hung out and had pizza on Saturday afternoon. Then I paid all my bills (woo frickin hoo). Then Nicole had to go to work which left me with nothing to do and no one to hang out with. So, on a Saturday night I watched the Nevada men's basketball game and wrote an essay. Yesterday I worked all day long with the crappiest bartender/manager my work has to offer. Although Bill and Brad are both on my shit list for seperate reasons. Bah.

After I got off work (and I definitely worked since I only got a 30 min break all day) I brought my boyfriend a burrito and we watched Family Guy and Pulp Fiction. And that was all a majority of 5-ish hours, and then of course, since we both have to be up to go to school we went to sleep.

See... it just sucks. I spend more time with my books and with Mexican food than I do with my boyfriend and my friends. It just irks me sometimes how life's priorities get in the way of what is really important."

In all my other classes it was a take home type thing and I was able to sepnd hours upon hours writing it (since that's how long I need). Fuck espanol. No me gusta... EVER. I'm only taking it so I can graduate with a Journalism degree. I think it's dumb that they make us take it. I don't care to learn Spanish anymore then the very minimal I need to survive everyday in the U.S. (and yes I DO believe professionals should know some spanish these days). But seriously... do I REALLY need to know how to have full out conversations about what I look like or why I think your mother is retarded? I don't think so.

"event","Today being Saturday and it being uncommonly warm in Reno I wish I could have went out and did some outdoor activities. Or perhaps gone to our crazy far away outdoor mall to purchase wonderous items I don't really need, but I would buy anyway. However, I did none of these things.

But I did create some fantastic culinary cuisine. I'm really trying to healthy and for the most part I'm succeeding (minus my over indulgence of pizza and too much alcohol now and again). I made some really great stuff today and I'm proud. First of all I made some rockin salmon with dill, garlic, green onions, and sliced lemons. I haven'thad it yet because it's for a couple of my meals next week. Next I made some awesome open-faced french sandwhiches. I bought a baguette, goat cheese, organic tomatos, proscuitto, and a raspberry vinagrette. The awesome part about it is you can put all kinds of stuff on these sandwhiches and they're relatively very healthy. I made two kinds today:

1. Goat cheese, tomato, and crushed pepper - delish!
2. Goat cheese, proscuitto, and thinly sliced cucumber - also fantastic (I had thise for dinner)

Next week I plan on making Chicken L'organge. And then I think I'm going to find some easy Greek recipes because I saw some awesome Greek cheeses at Raley's I want to buy. Greek food is some of the most healthy food in the world. The more you know. *rainbow*

Oh, and also I'm so proud of my culinary masterpieces. For Valentine's Day for my boyfriend I baked a cake -- from scratch! It was a carrot cake. I got a recipe off-line and tweaked it a little to what I thought would be good and it turned out awesome! Lately cooking has been my relaxant in between doing homework and work. Plus... my boyfriend enjoys it and he cooks for me too, so we take turns. :) We even made this awesome stir-fry for our Valentine's dinner.

So, cooking is a good thing -- especially since it can be freakin healthy and cheaper than eating out!"

Fortunately I only got seriously stuck once and I sweated my ass off reversing, putting the car back in drive, turning the wheel one way, then the other, and waiting for douche bags to go around me who weren't giving me ANY leeway or room at all to manuver. Fuckers. Anyway my car didn't get stuck, but I did have to weave my way in and out of people who were stuck/pushing their cars up streets. What fun. Oh, and I didn't actually make it home, but luckily my boyfriend lives on the way to my home so I stopped at his house before I test my luck any further. He isn't even here, but his roommates are... who informed me their truck got stuck a mile down the road and they had to walk here. Yay for snow huh?

I saw <i>The Pursuit of Happyness</i> today. It was SO GOOD. I love Will Smith as an actor and his son was really great in it too. Go see it if you haven't, you'll cry, believe me.

"event","A controversial piece of writing by yours truly, Ashley. 

I'm not sure where to begin. Looking back on my four years of college already gone by I see a lot of happiness, but also sadness. I see all of the ups and downs. Now as I begin my 5th year at UNR all of these emotions from all kinds of events and people seem to mesh together. Sure, I can pick out moments of my college life and laugh while I tell them with friends that can relate and understand that one drunken moment, or those 3 awful months of heartbreak or those still ongoing years of being head over heals with someone. But I realize something through all of this: I've always just given in to the stereotypes. I think I've kind of been walked all over in a sort of way without knowing it. I like to think I've become intellectual, smarter if you will, about my life and what I should do about it. How to deal with it, and especially, the people that move in and out of it. After all, a person can not truly live their life unless it involves other people. 

I'm hoping the subject of this caught your eye, it was meant to. It is partially what this is going to be about. I think more though, this is about me coming into my own person. I'm no longer the scared freshmen who drank my nights away because I thought it was cool. I'm no longer the sophomore who began to understand drinking isn't all it's cracked up to be and the fact that people aren't always as nice or as cool as they seem. My ""party hardy"" days at Bell Street have already been lived to their fullest. They were fun, probably too out of control, but now, they are over. My senior year which turned out to be nothing that I ever thought it would be is also concluded. Now, here I sit, in a house that isn't my own, typing this blog on a borrowed laptop. I begin to wonder was it worth it? And I know that even though I could list off plenty of reasons of why it hasn't been worth it, it has. 

Now that the introduction is over, I'd like to get to the true context of this writing. It has come to my attention the topic of who I'm sleeping with, having sex with, hooking up with, whatever is being said about me, is being said. So, to ease everyone's minds I'm posting this blog. 

1. (a) Just because I live with someone doesn't mean I'm fucking them. Yes, I know it's hard to believe, but it's true. Just because I have been able to live in a house which MY FRIEND ALEXIS offered to me I get pinned with the scarlet letter of being a whore who gives it up. Guess what? I don't and to those of you who think it's true or continue to joke about it, I don't appreciate it.

(b) This housing situation of mine is completely TEMPORARY and was ALWAYS an agreement between myself and Alexis. Although the other members of the house had no problem with it the fact is: I am living here because I had no where to go and ALEXIS offered me the space.

2. I don't appreciate the discussion of my personal, sexual life, period, end of story. It's no one's business but my own and why anyone whould want to discuss it is really beyond me. Get your own sex life to talk about and leave mine behind.

3. I have not and never will have sex with, date, make out with, or ""hook up with"" anyone from the same fraternity as an ex in any case scenario. It's disrespectful and in my opinion completely wrong. Any of my actions with a Phi Mu Alpha be they hanging out, having a class with, talking to, or being friends with is JUST THAT and nothing more. It's not sex. It's not me trying to ""get with them"" and it sure as hell isn't me completely destroying the trust I have and/or had with a certain individual.

4. This probably makes everyone wonder because every other girl has done just the opposite of what I'm claiming. I have this to say: If you don't believe me then you probably don't know me. If you really did know me, you'd know what I'm saying is the truth. I do not strive to be ""that girl"" that gets drunk (or sober) and finds guys to have sex with just to piss off or get even with people/ex's/etc.

5. I think it's unfair for anyone to judge me. And I think it's especially horrible that many of you I have considered my friends for a long period of time are the ones continually joking about it. I'm aware of all of your jokes, assumptions, claims and stories about me. But I know what is true and what is not. My heart has been kicked, smashed, and completely crushed many times. It has caused me so much stress to keep my actions in check in order to stay sane in a world that revolves around drama, talking crap, and continual bull shit. I don't think it is fair. Even to people I dislike I would never wish upon them the discomfort I have felt after being told things about myself that have no validity at all.

6. This isn't me begging people to quit talking shit about me. This is me taking a stance about it because it's just really inappropriate and I'm sick of it. All I know is this: I tried to stay out of the problem. I was in a relationship and it's over now. I'd like to move on, but I won't EVER do so by having sex or hooking up or being in a relationship with anyone that would be a problem or ""cause drama"" with the aforementioned person. However, in saying that I think it is unfair for me to not be able to hang out with a person of the opposite sex I consider a friend.

Now that I've written out these things, and it is all completely how I truly feel I have no hesitation in posting this for everyone to see. If I could tell all of these things personally to every one of you out there that needs to hear it, I definitely would. I've learned that expressing yourself and speaking your mind are truly two of the hardest things to do, but also the most important."

"event","I've decided this Summer has probably been one of the best I've had. Here are my reasons. First of all I'm making money at work barely doing anything (minus hectic Thursday nights). Next I don't have to see all of the people I truly cannot stand. Such as people in band, numerous faces of people around campus, people in my ex-sorority I don't want to see, and etc. Also, I've been doing very well financially. I've been paying my bills (even more than minimum payments) and I've actually been able to purchase a few items that I've been trying to buy for a long time and haven't been able to (ie: concert tickets, pots and pans, GOOD food, etc). 

I just really hope this doesn't go all to pot when the semester starts. Although I do see some downfalls of next semester already looming in the distance: One, Greyson will be back in town. He's been gone ALL Summer doing Vanguard which has been utterly fantastic. I'm beginning to think about our torrid relationship less and less. As time moves on last year's memories slowly fade from my immediate concious. I will admit when I have absolutely nothing to do, or my mind begins doing what it does best (worrying and over-analyzing), my thoughts sometimes turn to him and all the good and bad times we had together. Unfortunately the bad times usually rule over the good ones. I guess it's because when a break-up isn't mutual the person on the recieving end tends to be a lot more cynical about the relationship. Also, it's much harder to allow the other person to be a part of your life. For instance I really don't want to speak with Greyson ever again. He did text me condolences about my Grandpa, but I didn't text him back. It wasn't because I was just trying to be a bitch, it was because I am not ready to let him back into my life. In fact, I don't think I'll ever be able to. 

Next I am NOT looking forward to seeing people in band. It is unfortunate band has become a sespool of back-stabbers and shit-talkers to me. But it has and I just can't see any other way around it. Things that have happened in the past to myself, my best friend, and others has really shown me the true colors of the music department AND most of all the Phi Mu Alpha's involved in it. Some may say my ""sudden"" hate of Phi Mu's and 90% of the people in the music department is irrational. I don't see it that way. It wasn't a sudden hate (and not even reall hate), but maybe pity of everyone who treads the halls of CFA seeking out ways to hurt or make fun of others. But I think it has been more of a wearing upon me. Dating Greyson last year was hard -- socially. Him and I had no real problems by ourselves, in fact, the alone time we spent together was always great. I think being an ""it"" person in the music program made me realize all of the TRUE sides of people. And to tell the truth I'm just really tired of it all. I'm glad this marching season will be my last and I will never have any reason to go into CFA ever again. Note that I will always, always love music. It's my number one passion in life (besides writing) and I never intend to give it up. But I have no problem leaving behind UNR's music department. 

Besides the whole Greyson and band thing I'm hoping next semester will be very productive and I can start taking my final steps toward graduation. Spring 07 is going to be really hard on me because I'm going to plan on taking as many classes as possible so I can finish my degree. Like I said I hope the way the Summer has been going kind of pours into next fall so I can get through it without too many hiccups."

"event","I took off to Washington on Thursday of last week to attend my Grandpa's funeral. It was great to see my family up there. It truly was a celebration of my Grandpa's life, not his death. Other than that I don't have much else to say as most people (besides family) would understand anyway.

I saw Pirate of the Carribean 2 with Alexis when I got back into Reno. Hey, I thought it was pretty good. I always enjoy Johnny Depp. And I personally liked the ending! A girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do after all. And besides everyone was begging for a make-out scene between Jack and Elizabeth anyway. I laugh at Will Turner. HA HA HA. 

Anyway I'm looking forward to moving out of my apartment. Unfortunately the house hunting kind of sucks. Hopefully I'll be moving in with two of my co-workers and if not I may end up in a studio apartment. I don't know yet.

Oh ya, summer escuela starts on Monday. Oh joy. I get to learn Spanish!"

"event","I've been slightly disappointed in the Summer movies. I saw The Omen onn 666, of course, because why would I see it on any other day? I thought it was kind of... lacking in scariness. Here's what I would have done to make the movie better!

1. The kid looked morose and pale. That was what he did. I can look morose and pale for God's sake. He should have grown horns and had a forked tongue for at least part of the movie. 

2. There would have been more crucifix stabbings. Actually there weren't any crucifix stabbings... why not? I'm not sure why there should be crucifix stabbings, but it just sounds cool.

3. The father's beliefs should have been played up more. I wasn't sure if he believed in God or not. 

4. Jackal childbirth. We should have seen it. It would have been freakish. Okay, maybe a little too freakish... maybe that's a bad idea. 

As for other movies I've seen:

X-Men III: The only thing that saved this movie was Hugh Jackman kicking ass. The Phoenix was shadowed by Magneto and should have been more evil.

The Da Vinci Code: Dry acting. How dare you disappoint me Tom Hanks. Great story, mediocre movie.

The Break-Up: I love Vince Vaughn. He made me laugh, but the movie was too freaking long. However, I applaud this movie for having a realistic ending. They actually broke up - and stayed broken up. Yay for dark romantic funny comedy. 

Oh ya, in other news... I'm still not drinking. Don't plan on doing it either. Work is work. Farmer's Market is this coming Thursday so I should be making bank while the servers are getting $500 - $700 every Thursday until the end of August.

I've been reading up on Tao and Zen. I'm thinking I might start practicing some stuff and meditating and what not. I just need something right now since I've pretty much decided the whole Christianity thing is a crock."

I was shaking, hyperventilating, sweating, crying, and my hands cramped up and wouldn't come undone. Also my face, hands, and legs went numb. Good stuff, huh? Hellooo my life is way too fucked up and my body just freaked OUT.

"event","I don't feel like writing a long ass entry. So I'll summarize.

I had an awful (second) break up with my ex-boyfriend. In response to this I have thrown myself into a downawrd spiral of crappiness. Meh. I deleted a shitload of people from my Myspace ""friends"". *jazz hands* I BOUGHT A BUNNY! His name is Kenny and he's the cutest thing in the world. He can't talk back, he can't make me sad (except when he craps in my bed), and when he acts up I can put him in a cage.

As for everything else... my Mom thinks I need to come home and I've been contemplating the idea. I'm also definitely thinking about going to Spain either Spring semester or NEXT Summer. I've already been speaking with the USAC program through the UNR Spain person... 

I'm moving back into Reno to live with Nicole until her lease ends in February and then we'll move out into a different place. Preferably a house. This is all of course if I don't decide to go home. 

Work is work. It's cool and I'm still getting along with everyone. I love the fact that I get whatever alcoholic drink I want for free after my shift. It's pretty awesome. Oh, and the fact that the cooks love me and give me pretty much whatever I want to eat is cool too.

I'm all right. I'm not going to kill myself, but hey... I think I'm like one more bad thing away from it. Suicidal awesomeness.

Oh, if you want the whole story of the breakup call me. Peace!"

"event","Ever worked at a Mexican restaraunt on Cinco de Mayo? Well, I have and it sucks. Friday night was a blur of people, enchiladas, and tequila shots after everything was said and done. Some people need to NOT go to restaraunts. Who comes to a place they KNOW is going to be packed and then complain about the hour wait? I have no sympathy. 

After my long ass night I went out with my roommate for her 21st. She came down to the Cantina to meet me and our other friend (a server there too) and we bought a round of Patron. After that we headed downtown. We went to Rumbullions which was awful. Then we tried Brew Brothers... however, my 21er friend disliked the music as it wasn't ""ghetto"" enough for her to dance to. After purchasing her a Tuaca shot and forcing down my Midori Sour on the way to the parking lot we headed to West 2nd Bar. It was terrible. I hate that place. Grinding and Ludacris over loud speakers + over priced drinks = Makes me want to leave and/or beat a small child. Luckily my friend got pissed (I still don't know why) and bolted from the place. As we chased her down she demanded we ""Not treat her like a child"" and ""She needs to drive her car home"". My friend and I tried to drag her to the car, but she freaked out and started walking/running/drunk stumbling away. We followed her back to the Eldorado Casino but lost her in a crowd. We looked all over and couldn't find her. Then we headed back to the garage hoping we could cut her off. We got to her car and she was no where to be found. After haning around for an hour we went back to the casino and checked every bathroom. We then walked back to West 2nd. By this time it was approaching 4 AM and bothe my friend and I had to be at work by 9 AM. There was nothing left for us to do, and we called her several times to no avail. I went home and about 15 minutes after I had gotten into bed I heard her stumble in and I heard a male voice (her ex-bf). I have yet to talk to her. I'm pissed.

As for the rest of my weekend... it was spent working. The street in front of Cantina was closed off and a huge Cinco de Mayo Meixcan street festival was set up. Arriba eh? Yesterday was freakin slow though. 

And now it is Monday, I have a HUGE project for Journalism due tomorrow. Wednesday is Prep Day for finals. I have a section head meeting for marching band that day and my portfolio for Journalism is due by 5 PM. Thursday is my Sociology final, and my final large power point multi-media production is due in my Journalism Media class. Of course, I have barely started any of this. Wish me luck."

"event","I'm tired. I'm exhausted with being the ""strong one."" I don't want to do it anymore. All my life I've been the friend that didn't get emotional. I was the rational one. I always thought about things and acted later. I am the rock. Cold and lifeless, because I have to be. I feel as though it is my responsibility to not allow my emotions to get in the way, because I have to be the stronger person. I'm to the point where I'm done with it. So many people count on me in so many ways. I feel as though there are millions of strings coming out of my body and they're all being pulled at once by other people. People I feel obligated to help, or comfort, or laugh with, or just be there. It has tired me, and I feel as though I can no longer do it.

I feel as though so much of me has been taken from me, that I don't have anything left. It feels bad when there is nothing left. I feel like a shell. I feel like my life is rushing by me and I am standing still. Things continue, I continue, but I don't, not really. I go on and I laugh and I do the things I have always done, but when I come home and sit down in my room, all the little things that were plaguing me before all rush back. They consume me. All the little things I pushed out my life, because they were problems. Problems come, and I squash them quickly, I take care of them. I don't blame other people or things for the problems in my life, because they are my own, and I deal with them, because that it the right thing to do. But now, I am beginning to realize the problems were only gone for a short period of time, and now they are resurfacing. All of these problems, all at once, it isn't fun. It is not enjoyable. I am very tired.

People think they can say things to me... and it will not affect me. Like, it will just roll off my back and I'll be the same person a few seconds later, laughing and being myself. But it does hurt. I may not show it, but it does hurt. I have feelings too, which may be a surprising fact to a lot of people who happen to think I'm just a cold, cynical bitch. Yes, I may play that part sometimes, just like everyone else, but also, just like everyone else I hurt, and I get upset. Just because I don't do it in front of people or make my feelings known to everyone so I can receive sympathy. It doesn't mean I don't get hurt just like everyone else. I guess I'm just a lot better at hiding it.

It's made me tired. And I don't feel like doing it anymore. When all of you is gone, there is nothing left. So where do I go from now?"

I have problems between friends. One friend connects me to my past and understands me and loves me, but I see that she is heading down a road that I can not follow. Then I have my newer friends who are like a breath of fresh air in my stale, lonely life. These friends are pulling me in a different direction.

Then I have myself to think about. I want to do so many things. I want to give everyone, and everything a chance. Sometimes I think it would be better to just get up and start new. But then my sane mind yells and screams at me and tells me what a horrible idea that would be. That I would lose everything if I were to do that. But then the other part says, would it really be so bad to lose everything now? Would it be that bad to just start new? 

I feel like I've fallen down the rabbit hole that never ends. It just keeps going, and going and there's no way I'm going to get out. No matter which direction I take, or what my decision is it will push me farther down into the void. 

I feel as though there is nothing inside me to tell me what to do. All that is inside me is useless information about journalism, sociology, and music. That doesn't make a person! That doesn't define who I am! Why is it I feel there is a large void where a part of ME used to be?? How could I have lost it? Did it just get up one day and walk away? Have I always been like this, but just now it is beginning to take control? Like a disease lying dormant in your body until you get sick and tired enough for it to strike?

I guess that's what got me thinking about it. 

Sometimes the people closest to you can just make you so mad. And I think the reason you get so mad is because you care about them so much. I can get mad at someone who cuts me off on the freeway, but in the next few seconds the anger is gone and I no longer think about it. But I can stew over an arguement with a friend for days, weeks even. The worst thing to see... is a friend walking down the wrong path. And it's hard to watch them go, but sometimes it's even harder to tell them to stop.

I often wish I could simply care for myself, and myself alone. Because life would be so much easier that way. But in the end I know it is impossible, because once you stop caring for others you have nothing left. And when you have nothing left but yourself suddenly you don't matter anymore.

"event","Today, in Catholic world, was what is called ""Ash Wednesday"". I didn't go get my ashes, because I haven't been a practicing Catholic in awhile. I don't know when (or if) I intend to go back to practicing. However, Ash Wednesday begins what is called ""Lent"". A time when as a Catholic you are required to give up something of great importance in your life. 

In the past I have given up things, caffiene, soda, fast food, meat, the usual suspects. However, I was thinking about it, and in all seriousness if a person is going to give up something, shouldn't it be really important? Candy, soda, and fast food seem so meaningless. An easy way out, I think. So, I thought about it, what is really important in my life?

Family, the number one thing in my life. Where would I be without them? My parents are my backbone, my pillars. Without them I would not be here. I can't give them up, it would be impossible.

Friends, the second most important people in my life. Where would I be without them? They are my support system, the people I laugh with, the people I love, my inspiration and my downfalls. They are my happiness and my sadness. They are the people who break me down, and build me back up. Although it would be possible to give them up, if I were to become a hermit and lock myself in my room for 40 days. I wouldn't want to.

Music, besides the people in my life music comes in third. Where would I be without it? I certainly wouldn't be the person I am today. Music gets me through my bad times, it makes me happy when I am sad. It is my world, I am immersed in it. Therefore, giving it up would be possible, but I wouldn't do it. 

Education, and by this I mean college. Everything about my education is extremely important to me, especially right now. This would mean not writing for 40 days. Not going to classes, not learning, growing, and moving forward. It would be torture. Once again, there's no way I'd give it up.

Cell Phone, although it seems dumb I couldn't give it up. It's my only link to my parents in Las Vegas. It's how I communicate with my friends, my alarm clock to get up in the morning. It tells me what day it is and what time it is. It's extremely important. I wouldn't be able to function without it.

So, what else is there that is important to me? And you guessed it, Myspace. It is important to me. It's my link to people in my life that I don't see everyday. I check it everday. I play on it, I write on it. I express my feelings in my blogs. It's ridiculous, but it's true. However, Myspace creates drama, it's like that evil ""fast"" machine in the VW commercials. I thought about it, would my life be better without it? What was it I did before Myspace was around? I guess I used Livejournal, but even that doesn't compare to the imense amount of time I put into Myspace. Would it be worth giving up? I still haven't decided on an answer to that question.

Think about it, giving up something for 40 days that means the world to you. What would it be for you? 

I know what it's like to lose something important. It hurts. And I'm still dealing with the pain. Perhaps willingly letting go of something wouldn't be as bad. But I don't want to add extra baggage on top of my already jacked-up life. Therefore, I pass on Lent this year. Maybe because I'm not into the whole Catholic thing anymore, maybe because I'm selfish, maybe because I'm dealing with stuff that already sucks, but in the end I keep what makes me happy, because there sure is a lot of sad in my life."

"event","I guess I finally got to that point when my mind said ""Fuck it"".

Yesterday while Reno was getting drenched in rain I drove to school in my shitty car. My windshield wipers don't work. And by don't work I mean that the left one is jacked up and I have to shove it back into place every 2-3 minutes or else it won't work. This involved me pulling over, getting out my car, and wasting about 40 minutes getting to school. Not only that, I left my lights on for 4 hours while I was at school. My friend Zeb happened to see my lights were on and sent me text messages throughout the day that I never got. When 4 PM rolled around and I had to go to band Zeb informed me of this fact. I was overjoyed, enraged, and I cried. I cried in CFA and just about everyone within a 10-mile radius probably saw it or heard about, or by now had heard about it. JOY OF JOYS.

After band Sara jumped my car. I guess it wasn't so bad. Then Zeb, Holly, Sara and I went to the mall. I bought a shirt and we went to Round Table afterwards. Then we went and looked at the river, because it was supposed to flood. I know, good idea right? It made me think of this book I once read in 5th grade about some kids on bikes and one of them drowned. It was called ""On My Honor"" or something like that. Haha. 

Anyway, Zeb and I talked about working with one of the high school marching bands here in Reno over the Summer and next year for their marching season. I think I'd really like to be an instructor. I think I'm coming back into my ""music"" self. I figure since I've been doing it for so long I might as well keep going. Besides, I love marching band. We might work with Galena or Carson. Zeb wanted to work with McQueen, but that's an obvious NO. 

I got home pretty late and kinda BS'd my final draft of my Online assignment for Journalism. I felt kinda bad about it, but damn it I needed to get out and just laugh and have fun with my friends who aren't depressing.

PS... It's snowing here."

We think we can save them forever, with technology? Even that will not stand the test of time. No, eventually it will all be gone.

Writings, documents, statues, computers, the Internet, ideas, thoughts, feelings, emotions - one day they will all fade. Eventually it will be a passing memory, and then it will no longer be thought of. Gone. Even people, yes, we put them in the ground and they go away.

Music. Written down pieces of work will one day deteriorate. Records, CDs, MP3s, those will go as well. Composers will be forgotten. Musical artists will vanish with their works. Instruments will die in time. Something will replace them.

Technology. As much as we love it now, it to will have no meaning in the future.

Wars, governments, politics, the U.S., Great Britain, Iraq, religions, Universities, one day these places and things will cease to exsist as well.

"event","What is there to say about a life that hasn't been lived? A life, when compared to others, seems unlived and unbroken? A mediocre passing of years trapped in an average world? 

Where should I begin? With the death of a loved one? I have had none. With a life-changing experience? Yet again, I fall short of that as well. A revelation of what it is I really want out of the time I spend here? I don't know. 

So, I ask again, how is it possible to describe a life that has not been lived?

I grew up in a family, like most children do. I was loved and cherished. My abilities and strengths were always praised. My weaknesses were worked on, but not pressed.

I was a very young person in my family. I still am. My brother and sister lived an entire decade and more before I came into the world. Why my parents decided on another child so late in their life, I don't know. Perhaps there is something wrong with me, because of this.

There are children who feel unhappy because they are the so-called ""middle child"". Looked at, but not seen, heard, but not listened to. This, because of their position as the stagnant middle. Not first, not last.

Then there are the eldest siblings. Unhappy because they were the first. The guinea pig child. All their parents faults can be centered around them. And when the parents improve upon their later chldren the first feels as thought their upbrining was unjust, unfair.

The only child also comes to mind. No siblings, no fights, no feelings of ""who is favorite"" in the eyes of the parents. There is only one favorite.

Sometimes I think I fall into this category. My brother and sister were so much older than me. I had no reason to fight with them. They were much more like everyone else in my family to me. Old, lived, knowing. By the time I was making sense of the world my sister had married and moved. My brother had moved as well, but lived in his own world. He still does. 

I close my eyes and try to thik about my past. Was I sad? Happy? Intelligent?

For the most part all I can remember is happiness. Growing up in a large house, my parents loved me, we had pets that came and went. We always had the comforts of food, cable television, VCRs, game systems, vacations, and going out to eat. Although this may seem like nothing to some... to most people it is luxury.

My parents had BBQs, plenty of friends. My Dad being in the Air Force gave us access to the Base. A military life. Trips to the commissary, tax-free shopping, and an income on top of an income. We also enjoyed the life of not only someone in the military, but an Officer.

My parents have always had, it seems to me, and underlying, but true love for each other. ""Dear"" has always been their pet names for each other. My father brought my mother flowers on their anniversary and jewelery for Christmas and Birthdays. I guess I grew up thinking ""This mst be how everyone's family is."" A child's perspective of life is so simple, yet unique to each one.

Was my life charmed? Clouded, because I only knew the good? 

Why is it now I wonder about these things instead of simply accepting them? Is it wrong of me? Selfish of me to ask why my life has been this way? Especially when compared to other lives, mine looks.... ""good""?"

Actually how I feel is wretched. Yes, I think that captures how I feel much better. I want to be an unhappy musician and write songs that make other people really sad. And my songs will be the songs that everyone listens to when they feel depressed. Yes, and I will make millions of dollars off of my songs, but I'll still be sad, because if I wasn't sad no one would buy my music. 

I hate Thursdays. Hence my subject. I think they suck because I only have two classes and I can't go to work. That leaves too much nothing time. I really despise nothing time now. I used to like nothing time. It gave me time to rest, to think, to ponder, to dream. I don't want to do those things anymore. They seem so.... unproductive. Like watching TV. TV is so goddamn unproductive. I should go back in time and shoot the person(s) who invented TV. At least being on the Internet allows me to be creative. Like now, I can share my feelings! Waaaah, feelings. *cries imaginary tears* 

I talked to my good friend Robb last night. We talked about a lot of stuff. School, friends, old friends, old times, work, relationships. You know, the usual 20-something whiney bull shit. Robb is taking this semester off of school, and I have to say I envy him. I miss Robb. He's a true person. The kind of person that doesn't change on a whim, or jerk people's feelings around. 

I asked Zeb if I should talk to Greyson. And he posed the question, ""Like.. right now..?"" and I replied, ""No, as in ever again."" Zeb's reply was, ""Well don't you want to get back together with him?"" My reply was ""Yes, but I never want to talk to him again.""

"event","I really fucking hate Reno. I hate just about everything that makes up this city. The sleazy casinos (one of which I now work for). I hate the weather. I hate icy roads. I hate bastard drivers. I hate Starbucks. I hate being here and not being able to leave. I hate my car. I hate not having snow tires or chains. I hate that I probably will never have these things because I can't afford it. I hate having nothing but oatmeal to eat.

I hate the feeling of spinning out on the ice in the middle of the night. I hate driving in shitty weather. I hate imagining all the ways I could possibly die when I'm driving on stupid roads that are iced over. I hate imagining all the things I could possibly be doing with my life right now, instead of what I am doing.

I thought about a lot of stuff today. I got really upset today. And some of the stuff I got most upset over were kind of surprising. Most of all I cried about my parents. I cried because they are moving. They are moving away from me. And that scares me. They're going to leave Las Vegas... probably next Fall and to tell the truth I'm not sure I can handle that. I considered moving wherever it is they're going... Texas. Whatever. I can transfer my credits and finish my degree there, right? My Mama can't be that far away from me. I don't want her to be far away from me. It isn't fair. 

Most of all I want to be happy. But I don't know if I am. I was talking with Nicole tonight, about lots of stuff. About dropping college all together. About why I'm a Journalism major. About how I always thought music was what I wanted, but when I realized I didn't have the talent, ability, or patience that idea was gone forever. About wanting to leave Reno. About how I have way too many semesters of college ahead of me. I won't kid myself... I will not graduate next year. There's no way. Considering the classes I'm taking now as a Journalism major I'm a sophomore. And I have yet to even do an intership. 

I thought about my aspirations of working in the music business and if I'm really capable of something like that. I can barely walk into an employment office with a resume without getting terribly frightened. How can I really make a career in such a competitive business?

I wondered why I'm such a closed person. Why I don't let people in. Why I don't express how I feel. What I think. 

I then decided I was being a little bitch. That I shouldn't be whining about my life. That things could be much, much worse. I'm in college, something most people don't have. My parents take care of me. I have clothes, internet, a computer, friends who love me, countless material possessions which are freaking ridiculous. Seriously, why the fuck do I own over 50 movies? 

I guess I will throw myself into my studies. Journalism, sociology, working. These will be my motives for my life right now. After all, there is nothing else I can do. Unless I pack everything up, say goodbye to my friends, and retreat to Las Vegas. But everything in my serious, intellectual mind screams ""NOOOO!"" to this idea. But my heart says, ""Yes yes yes!"".

At least I have the comfort of The Smiths. There's something about Morrissey's depressing voice that makes me feel just a little bit better."

I have a boyfriend. His name is Greyson and he's in the band. He plays center snare in the drumline and he's also section head. I ended up being interested in him during band camp and it just so happened we ended up together at the end of the end of band camp party. I really don't want to give out a whole lot of details, but I really enjoy being with him. He was in the Santa Clara Vanguard over this past Summer and he's extremely dedicated and talented. You know, there's something about someone who has more ambitions than just smoking a bowl that's really attractive. He has his flaws, but you know I've really opened up more to him than I have anyone EVER. I mean besides my best GIRL friends I never really felt the need to tell any guy I was semi-interested in/dating what I've told Greyson. I think our relationship works really well... even though everyone in band makes fun of us. But I know they all aren't being mean.. just being stupid band kids per usual.

Yay! I love it and my Mama came and helped me move and she of course bought me lots of goodies to put in my room, bathroom, and fridge! My bathroom has a sun and moon shower curtain, and the theme is yellow and blue with silver accents (trash can, tooth brush holder, etc.). The theme of my bedroom is purple, black, and silver. My new desk is black and silver, as well as my new night stand/book case. I also found a fantastic three light bulb silver lamp. I am still in need of storage for some of my clothes, but this will come in time. As well as a new stereo I plan on purchasing when I get my check back from the University. :D Frickin awesome. Christin is also giving me her book shelf. Unfortunately it is white, however there is nothing a can of black spray paint won't fix. Oh, as well I plan on buying new pictures/posters to accent my room with. I believe I am going to do a Parisian theme... we shall see how this works out later. 

As for the rest of the apartment it is coming along quite nicely. We have a fairly spacious living area with an area rug which Christin aquired. As well as a nice coffee table and of course my TV set and TV stand are in the living room as well.. since we have cable TV after all. We don't have a couch yet though... we do plan on getting one... or perhaps a love seat would be better. However, we do have a nice comfy chair of Christin's and another smaller chair. Christin's parents also bought us a new chrome microwave (much better than the OLD one we used to have) and we have a toaster over, George Foreman, and of course my coffee maker! The apartment came with a dish washer and a very nice stove, AND a washer/dryer!!! *praises the Lord*

Oh, we also have a kitchen table (from my parents), but no chairs for it yet. That's okay... all will come in time. Well, hopefully not too long from now. We DO have two bar stools though, which are fantastic. :) We also live on the top floor which is a blessing so we don't have to hear anyone above us. AND we have a great balcony. 

Of course the apartment is about 15 miles outside Reno. But since I've been making the drive it really isn't that bad. 

I work a lot this week because we lost 3 employees this past week. *weep* I hate working so much. But I do have all of next week off, but next week is BAND CAMP!! I can't believe it's so soon. My manager is upset I'm going to be gone for so long. She gave me a gift certificate to Port of Subs though... I've already used it of course. This bothers me though because I had been contemplating quitting. Now I feel obligated to stick it out there until December because that's when my manager is quitting and graduating from UNR. I will most likely stay there till December  and then put in my two weeks before winter break starts... that way I can go home for pretty much all of winter break. Oh yes, I will be in Texas for some time during my break since it will be my Grandparents 65th Wedding Aniversary.

Okay, I think I've typed enough. If you want my new address please let me know and I'll send it to you. I'd rather not have the entire Internet community seeing my address here on my journal. :)"

"event","Over this past weekend me, Nicole and Danielle went out. We went and saw Wedding Crashers. Oh man, that was hilarious. I love Owen Wilson.
However, we also made a bad mistake of going downtown. Of course it was Hot August Nights this past weekend. When all the people bring all their old fashion cars and drive them around Reno. Well, we figured there would be a lot of people downtown and it would be cool. We were right and we were wrong. There were a lot of people... just the wrong kind. Ghetto ass people from California were everywhere! We got called ""mija"" everywhere we went. And Danielle got asked where her baby's daddy was?? It was like an alternate universe. AND some creepy Mexican actually TOUCHED my arm and said something to me! It was scary.

Oh yah, I got a visor made at the mall. It says ""Mean Girl"" on it in pink. I'm totally wearing it to band camp. 

I missed the newest episode of Laguna Beach last night because I had a wretched head ache and went to bed. *tear*"

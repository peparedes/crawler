"event","lol. im such a loser. but i am very proud of myself lately. its the new year and all and of course everyone makes a resolution to lose weight. that wasnt exactly my resolution, but working out more (or at ALL) was my goal in the year 2005. and i'm actually doing it and sticking to it! ive been working out 5 days a week and im still at it. every other time i've said i wanted to work out and lose weight, i quit after like the second or third day. but i've been eating alot differently, which is good, and i've added alot of exercise. so hopefully i will be looking better and FEELING better about myself. i really am amazed at how long ive been doing it now, granted its only been like a week or so but thats longer than any other time! so if you see my ""working out"" away message not up for awhile...just remind me to get back to it! :-P

school is going ok right now. i have so much reading to do this semester. like every class of INST i have another chapter to read and the same for my reading class and i have alot of assignments and a paper due soon so i just need to stay on top of things while also finding time to work out 5 days a week. whew! its tough but i just gotta do it. i really want over a 3.5 this semester, that would be awesome! i'm going to get more involved in aggie school voluteers this semester, i did it last semester but didnt always go to the meetings each week, just the volunteer part. im volunteering at 3 schools this semester. im doing my normal volunteering of HOSTS at Neal(yay ms tuggle!) and then at college hills again and i think im going to go to fannin elementary in Bryan this semester too cuz one of my TA's in INST has a daughter that teaches there (my TA is really old, lol) and she needs some people to volunteer each week helping kids in her class with reading cuz they moved the TEKS test up to february this year for 2nd graders instead of april so they are in desperate need and i have the time available. might as well if im going to be a teacher for the rest of my life! lol...im really like all my teaching classes though, the more education classes i take, the more i like it and that makes me feel good. 

ok well i just got done working out (of course) and now i need to take a shower cuz im prolly stinky. haha ok well until!"

"event","so! another semester has started and i've gone to all my new classes now! i have the weirdest schedule this semester but HEY! i'm not complaining. i dont have class on monday OR friday which is a new experience but i do have FOUR classes on tuesday/thursday (not by choice, they messed up the classes) but i went to them and i think i can do it...maybe on a lot of caffeine, ha! i was really anxious cuz i was afraid that i would have a million tests on the same day but i dont really and if i do, its just two on the same day, whew! and im in all education classes this semester which i LOVE! but alot of them don't even have tests, just quizzes like every week. eh, whatever works. so here's what tuesday/thursday look like (11:10-5:10):

math 366-mila is hard to understand but i got most of what she was saying, lol...nicole and i are going to have a fun time in that class figuring out what she just said...congrence is not the same as congruence! ;)

inst 210-looks like an awesome class!! very diverse cuz theres so many different majors even though the class is pretty specific to teaching. they have some strict, old TAs though but at least we can eat in the class which i need to cuz i go to class like all day so i gotta eat sometime! but really the class looks like its going to really make me think about my opinions which i have a hard time figuring out sometimes...

kine 214-seems ok, its alot of group work so thats cool, got to meet 3 new ppl and one of them is even in my inst 210 class before hand. im not so thrilled about walking from zachary to read building though! that was tough! but i made it in 16 minutes so im ok. afraid of the group presentation coming up...

rdng 312-the prof came right out and said it was boring but it looks like shes going to make it somewhat of a fun class. this was the only class that didnt lecture or stay the whole time which was great cuz i was ready to go by 4:30. she did read us a book though which was really cute about a little girl who had trouble reading and she was almost crying at the end of it. shows that shes got heart.

wednesday (8-11):
rdng 301-so i get there and i meet two new people right away and they are nice and one of them is in my other reading class so thats cool! and the prof seems really nice and she seems like she would be a good person to come to if you needed help in ANY education class. started off boring, going thru the syllabus but then she did an exercise with us. she told us to pretend like we were 6 years old again and in the 1st grade learning new words. it was weird at first cuz we arent 6 and she was talking to us like we were and i was like ""ok this is weird"" but then she put this story on the overhead and we learning ""new"" words. it was actually english letters but with different letters and pictorial representations and we learned them and it had some words in english and others in this new language that we were learning and by the end of the story we could read in this totally different language. it was so awesome! the last page was all in the new language which looked like a bunch of gibberish but we knew exactly what it meant. then we could rememeber what it was like to learn to read and how children learn words and rememebr what the letters looks like instead of a mess of just squigly lines. it was a really cool activity! too bad the class is 3 hours...lol

so that was my first time in those classes and they seem like they are going to be really fun. i cant tell how the grades are going to go yet. all i know is im going to be doing alot of reading this semester! i better stay on top of things so im gonna go run some errands and come back and try to start reading...good luck in the semester everyone!"

"event","i haven't journaled in SO long...i guess its cuz im at home and not always at a computer. new years was good, went to dinner and did some fireworks, it was fun :-) i watched the season premiere of ALIAS at sam's house the other day which was awesome! got to see some friends and watch a good show. melanie and katie were there...my roommates for next year!...and so we all had fun watching together. i signed my lease at melrose for next year so im excited about that. i already know some of the stuff i want to buy for my new room. and guess what? its NOT going to be blue stuff! lol...im changing most of the room to maroon, thought it was time for a change but that does not in any way mean i dont like blue anymore :-P i'm a loser but thats ok. 

i have to clean out my room at home next week, like everything is coming out, even my bed. its ok though, i dont mind, my room wasnt that great anyways. we are going to put the futon in there until i take it for next year. i'm kinda excited to change my room in there. it will be a nice change from the past 13 years. i already took down all the signs that were on the walls, so now it looks really barren in there. it was kinda sad looking at all my old signs and stuff from people i hardly even talk to anymore or not at all. sometimes that isn't always up to me though. anyways i am ready for a different room. it will be nice :)

i am driving to lubbock tomorrow with chris cuz he has to go back to school a week before me. only staying the night though. i hate saying goodbye, it really sucks and i cry everytime. i know i will be this time cuz as it looks now, i wont be seeing him until spring break. 2 months is a long time. but as many people say, absence makes the heart grow fonder.

well i guess thats about all for now. i think i'm going to go back to college station this next friday. it will be kinda boring here now with chris gone and my parents both working. hope this semester is even better than last! see everyone soon!"

"event","so i finally got above a 3.0 for a semester! and boy does it feel GREAT!!! i can't believe it...i thought i was gonna do so bad this semester. my first D in college, no A's, a couple of C's but i did so good! well i have room for improvement, i did make one C and that was in chemistry but thank god it wasnt a D like i thought it would be. i got three A's and two B's! i hope next semester will be something alittle closer to 4.0 though, all the classes im taking practically have like 80% A's in all them. so i think my chances of making a 4.0 or anything remotely close to it are even better. my goal is to make a 4.0 at least one semester in college...and i'm working my way up! and now i dont have to worry anymore about keeping a 2.75 for the college of education, i'm all set to go! WOO HOO!! i got INST 210 added to my schedule so now i have to figure out what i'm going to drop so i can take it. there's no way im taking 18 hours..thats just insane! lol. i think i'm going to drop EPSY 320 which is child pyschology. they have like 85% A's so i dont really want to miss a chance at making another A but my advisor said i could CLEP test out of it and its kind of late in the day, and i've found out that i'm more of a morning class person (even though i hate getting up and going to bed early) but i like to be finished before the whole day is over so it works out. i'm only 37 hours away from my aggie ring! i can't believe how fast college is going by! anyways...i miss my roomie! i feel like i haven't seen her in over a month! i'm used to her being like 5 feet away from me at all times...which is really kinda weird cuz we are both only children so we are used to having our own space but its so nice to be able to have somewhat of an idea of what having a sister is like :-) well i think i'm gonna go shop for a new cell phone now cuz my dad said he would get me one for christmas and for making such good grades...FINALLY! lol...merry christmas in 3 days!!"

"event","first off, i hate being sick. i've never felt so weak in my life. i started getting sick thursday night and my throat was just hurting alittle but that was all. i had band rehearsal that night for the concert that was friday and stacie and i stayed to watch the concert band practice...they were so good. i'm thinking of trying out cuz i have their class time available and i know some people in it so that would be cool. so that night sam and i watched a primetime thing about ocean's twelve which comes out this friday! we are definitely going to see that. then we decided to get some snack food and watch ocean's eleven and thats when my throat started hurting. 

on friday morning i started feeling really tired and my throat was still hurting but i got up for class and got ready but then chris gave me the bright idea of skipping chemistry and going back to sleep for an hour before physics...so i did! i needed that hour. but then i went to physics and it went 25 minutes over, it was ridiculous, but we got to play with dice and that was kinda fun. so i went home and ate lunch with my cool roomie and then went back to sleep AGAIN while she went to class. i wanted to go christmas shopping when she got back but i was so exhausted still. so she read a book and i feel asleep once again.  then that night i had my band concert which was fine, sami got to come and then we decided to get some hot chocolate and go see the christmas lights at santa's wonderland. and as i was walking out of the concert, i saw....james and drew!! i was so happy to see them. i didnt tell them about it cuz i figured they would be busy but they showed up anyways. it was a very nice surprise. so i chatted for alittle bit and then went on my way. santa's wonderland was so much fun! but we were mad cuz we could have gotten hot chocolate there and for cheaper than what we payed! we could have santa sized that biotch!! lol ;-D and we forgot our cameras!! but i might go again with my family and i can take my camera then. after that sam and i rented white christmas and watched that cuz i LOVE that movie but we fell asleep before it ended, lol. 

on saturday, i felt AWFUL. sam had to go home to see katie for her bday and i wish i could have gone too :( stupid band and theater extra credit. anyways, i had a temp of over 101 all morning so my nice daddy came to see me and take care of me. i really miss him, hes always so busy and has only come to see me once this year. he came more last year when he was in mississippi for 3 months! but anyways, i enjoyed our day together. he bought me a lot of sick person food and we watched a movie together and he even washed some of my laundry (and sams!)...how nice! it was good to spend some father-daugther time just us. but then i had to go to a play for theater and it was such a waste of time and money. it was It's A Wonderful Life, and i have seen the movie like a million times and the play was just like the movie, word for word. so i could have gone to see a different play for more extra credit but i am gonna see it today with adrienne. even though she saw it already yesterday, lol. but i had a good time with ashley and adrienne at the play so i guess it wasnt such a waste of time, and it got me out of my room for alittle bit. 

so now today i still have to see one play and i have to write 3 papers for theater. so thats what i've been doing the past couple of days...just in case you cared to read all that. it was mostly a way for me to procrastinate starting my first paper :-D oh well. i'm getting tired again...ha"

dooby dooby do! so i had a good thanksgiving...i got to see chris alot and that was very nice :) and i went to sams tu party to watch the game! too bad we didnt win but it was good fun being with friends. i also saw the movie national treasure and i really liked it! it was a good movie. i would see it again. OH! there is a preview for oceans 12 on tv! i am so excited to see that movie...sam and i are going after our finals next friday to see it. it should be pretty good. so my physics prof said we could take our final next week instead of on the 15th! yay! i might do it cuz then i will get to leave on monday after chem final at 8. who knows tho. well i better get home so i can do other stuff. bye bye!"

so anyways...this week was pretty good..i dont really remember much of it, i didnt have any tests so i didnt really do much except hang out with sam, watch season 8 of Friends, and the first season of the OC, lol. i really haven't done anything educational lately :-P i need to get with it! i have a test on tuesday and i havent studied alot yet. then chemistry on friday, kill me now! i really need to do well on these tests this week...and then thanksgiving will be here!! waaahooo!

so this weekend the wonderful chris came in (at 3 in the morning!! geez :-P) on friday and he got to experience some A&M stuff! we went to midnight yell which i thought was fun and then we went to the cambridge tailgate party and got some free food before the game on saturday. the game was fun and i liked him being there with me but some aggies were really pissing me off. all he was doing was cheering for his team (and some of it was alittle annoying at times, sorry babe) and when an aggie got hurt, chris and some of the tech people behind us ""held their guns up"" to show support for the hurt aggie...we at A&M dont have anything like that, thats why we ""get off the wood"" and some girl a few rows in front of us turned around and said to chris ""way to show some f-ing class"" and that REALLY PISSED ME OFF...as aggies we are always saying how nice we are to people that come from other schools but i was definitely around the people who are not nice AT ALL. it really ruined the game for me (except for when we won :-D) and then other people were yelling ""shut up"" to the tech people all around us...i was so mad, i really want to write something to the battlion mail call...i think i just might! i am so angry about it still, i couldnt believe how awful everyone was. if it was a red raider that was hurt and he had done that, no one would have given a shit(sorry) what he was doing with his hands. i asked chris today what he thought of kyle field and he said ""everyone was rude"" it made me so upset that his first experience at our awesome kyle field was bad....thanks everyone!! >:o

but other than that, the weekend was wonderful :-) we went to outback after the game and after waiting for an hour had some really good food! it was a good time all around! but i was sad today when he had to leave, but thanksgiving is right around the corner and hopefully he will be able to come home *crosses fingers*

so then B and i had to come back for chemistry lab which is normally like the worst part of the week...i hate that lab, im so glad its my last one ever! thank god! but it was actually a fun lab today! we made this gak stuff and ours was blue! you know me and the blue! ;-) it was kinda fun! and it was short today...and the best news is that next week is our LAST lab week...wooo hoo!

so after all that...i got home and sam, bianca, and i went to the tent sales....again! lol. i have been to ever one this year...thats kinda bad! lol oh well! but the line to pay took 30 minutes!! it was crazy there! and THEN sam and i went to the mall and got yummy (but not so healthy, haha) pretzels for dinner. and did alittle shopping there too. so all in all, i shopped 3 times today! lol. thats a bit much! 

now its time to just chill with my roomie and watch a cute chick flick. yay!! im so exhausted! early bed time for me tonight! i started to fall asleep in lab today...lol. goodnight!"

"event","so the chem test today wasn't so hot. i knew it wouldn't be though cuz i went to the sneak preview of THE OC last night and it was so awesome! sam went with me even though shes never seen the show so i had to fill her in on some things that were going on :P we got there around 6 cuz i knew there would be a line and there were like 200 people in front of us, it seemed like there was alot of people there but the place wasn't even near full so i guess not that many people could come. i really shouldnt have but i didnt want to miss it. there were even guys there which was really funny cuz they were all into it too. 

and i won a prize! they had a raffle and there were a bunch of victoria's secret prizes and OC prizes and i actually won a pillow so that was cool! its pink so it kinda sticks out from all my blue! lol. and they passed out make up bags and OC mousepads. not to mention that the episodes were AWESOME! it was so weird hearing all the OC music again after like 6 months with no OC :( so all in all it was really fun and a great way to procrastinate! i probably would've procrastinated whether i went or not and this was alot more fun than sitting at home procrastinating! but yeahhh...about that chem test. i just hope i got a C. hope to god i got a C! lol. i really want my math test grade back, i felt really well about that test so hopefully that will bring me up to an A in there. that would be great!

ok time to go start studying for yet another test that is on monday. since i'll be in lubbock :-D this weekend, i wont have much time to be studying!"

"event","wow it's been awhile since i've updated for real. this seems weird, lol. It's been kinda busy lately around here. Chris came to visit last weekend and i was happy about that :-) i picked him up from the airport in houston and we had dinner with my parents. el palenque...yuummmy! it was really good and i enjoyed seeing my parents too. 

The football game last weekend was EXCELLENT! i couldn't believe it! we did so awesome and it feels so good to be ranked FIRST in the Big 12 Conference and ranked 17th in the nation. I've never been more proud of my FTA Football team! Gig 'Em Aggies!! :-D OH! and i'm also so happy about the HOUSTON ASTROS!! they came back from 2-0 and now we are playing right now to make it to the world series! that is going to be so exciting to watch! the game is on now and i'm watching it of course. we are already up 1 and its still the first inning. Let's keep em coming! 

i went to the mall today for my ticket to The OC Sneak Preview next week!! I'm so excited! I think i'm gonna get there insanely early cuz theres only 750 seats and they are giving away 1100 tickets. 750 does NOT equal 1100! lol...i can do math! woo hoo! i want to make sure i get in...yeah i know i'm a loser. big L! haha. i also got me, heather, and sam the new Spirit Of Aggieland bracelet at Aggieland Outfitters. i figured i'd get it cuz it actually goes to something! habitat for humanity could use the money so i'm stylin now with my maroon bracelet. it's exciting. lol. 

so i felt bad this morning cuz last night sam thought she had lost her favorite astros shirt and was really upset and this morning i found it in one of my drawers...lol. we did laundry together and so i accidentely took it. so today i bought her some cookies from a bake sale that someone was having on campus! and i bought her the bracelet too even though she has the Texas A&M one already. oh well! she can wear two! i hope she likes it! sorry sami! 

well i've written more than i thought i would...and it was all pretty much about nothing, haha. i hope the astros win! sam and i are going for ice cream tonight if we win! woo hoo! cold stone here we come cuz i know the killer B's wont let me down! Biggio, Beltran, Bagwell, Berkman, Bamb, Bent, Bizcaino, Bausmus, Bunro!

"event","so i start off the day by going to my theater exam. as i'm taking the test, i'm thinking...wow this is so easy! i know i only missed one so far but the grades wont be done til the end of the week so thats not cool. then i found out that i got a 12 out of 15 on my chem quiz and thats pretty good for me, i normally dont get double digits so i was happy about that too! then i got home and got to take a nice little nap which was refreshing and i ate lunch and then was off to HOSTS! it was so awesome! my hosts kid was really sweet and he walked up to me and i told him my name and he said ""nice to meet you, tristan"" and even shook my hand. he was so cute and polite! and then afterwards he gave me a hug when it was time to leave. he made my day even better! 

so i came home to study for math and hung out with samantha and even watched alittle bit of FRIENDS. so it's time to go take my test and i think i'm ready for it and i was thinking ""lets do good on this one just like theater"" *i hope i havent jinxed my theater grade now* so i'm taking my test and i'm doing pretty good and then i get to the end and i realize i havent answered a question worth 4 points and then i messed up on question worth 8 points and it was time to end the test so i was left without 12 points by the end of the test. and who knows what else i missed. that just ruined my whole day. i was so determined this year to make all As and i did the best i could and that wasn't even worth an A. i'm really upset with myself. and chemistry is coming up on wednesday and that is the class i'm really not paying any attention in.

so the day started so well, everything was going so well and i hate to end the day on a bad note but i'm just so disappointed. and now i have to go study chemistry. yay.

i just don't want to disappoint my scholarship donors again and my parents again and especially myself again. i don't want a repeat of last year."

i had my first test today, it was in physics. it wasn't that bad, i didnt study that hard cuz i felt like crap last night and just wanted to go to sleep. i think i did alright...watch i jinxed it now. hopefully i got at least a B. that would be good, i would be happy. some of the questions on the test were on the book website quiz so i knew some of the questions from that. yay. 

now i have to start studying for my two tests on monday. i dont feel like doing anything right now. i have theater and math and i'm worried about the math test. seems like theres so much to know. its an education math and i can do calculus but i cant do addition and subtraction! i feel dumb in that class. eh well.

there's alot to write about and i dont want to bore anyone with everything we did over the weekend but it was so much fun to be with him that much especially since i hadnt seen him in like a month. the texas tech (sss) campus is so beautiful though! i took alot of pics and they have such an awesome campus. i cant say much about the city though...haha. its alot bigger than college station though. it made me miss college station alot. everything there was tech and it just reminded me of how awesome a&m is. no offense chris ;-D

so then i went with my roommate and her friend melanie to silver taps and i picked up rebekah on the way, lol, cuz she missed going with her dorm. and that was...well it was silver taps, i cant really say it was ""good"" cuz it was sad so i'll just leave it with saying that it was very respectful. 

i had another meeting tonight. it was for Aggie School Volunteers and that was pretty cool too. i didnt know anyone in that organization tho but they are having alot of socials so i'm sure i'll meet some people in there. so now i will be volunteering at 2 schools per week cuz of HOSTS and ASV. thats cool though. it will give me a break from my school and the stress of that. 

the big tent sale is tomorrow!! i dont know why but im really excited...i guesss cuz of the cheap stuff...cheap is always good! my mom wants shirts too so shes gonna come visit and buy some too. thats cool. well i just felt like journaling to tell everyone about my awesome fall...it wasn't so awesome though. haha. 

hopefully i wont fall anymore! hope everyone has a fall-free day tomorrow!"

OH! i would just like to take this time to say how awesome my roommate is! shes so sweet and is always cracking me up :) we are getting along so well and alot better than our other roommates are. we have just been hanging out alot this week. we had a super exclusive party with just us and her friend melanie the other day, haha. it was fun. it was just pizza and girly movies but it was still nice. and then yesterday we did a lot of shopping. we got these cool magnetic photo frames for out desks that were definitely a dollar a piece. and then we went to lunch at cheddars with her parents who are pretty cool. today we went to church together which was fun. it was the first time i had ever been to church in college station. the service was really long though but the church was pretty nice. i think we are going to try a new one next week just to see what else is out there. but what was cool was that if you had never been there, you got a free dessert from the pie ministry after the service. that was awesome. after that we went to chili's to have a reunion with my DG but not that many people showed up cuz they were out of town which was not cool. and then we hit up Barnes and Noble for a little while. i just couldnt get out of that store! then we checked out the MSC open house and that was really cool. i saw the aggie wranglers preform for the first time ever and they were so awesome! 

what's weird is that she's an only child too (spoiled like me ;P ) and you would think we wouldn't possibly know how to share like others with siblings....but alas! we can!! hey! we aren't totally devoid of sharing capabilities! lol...yeah. so shes really cool and we have a lot of fun together. she's the coolest gal i know! haha :P and she loves FRIENDS! we've been watching so much of that already. we've already watched 2 seasons of it. crazyness. 

so anywho...i think it's time for bed...i have to get up reaaally early tomorrow. wow this journal was about my great roommate...but now she will have something to smile about! goodnight everyone!"

"event","well today was  the first day of class! getting up at 6:15 this morning definitely wasn't the highlight of my day, but i wasn't as tired as i thought i would be. i went to bed pretty early the night before so i got in some good hours of sleep. so i got up and got ready for my first class and there were like 50 people waiting outside at the bus stop cuz the cambridge is so freakin full this year. but i got to school in time and rode my bike to Zachry which was so far away! but im glad i have my bike now. 

my theatre prof was so awesome! he was really funny and even told us we didnt have to come on fridays which is great cuz now i can go out on thursday nights and not worry about wake up at 6 the next morning! woo hoo! and i even knew someone in my class! he lives at the cambridge too and he lived there last year so i was glad to see someone i knew. and the labs are whenever you can go to watch a movie so thats pretty cool too. i think im gonna go tomorrow after band and physics...im so nervous about those two! yikes!

so then i had chemistry and that was kinda boring, but jessica, dyanne, heather, and jennifer are all in my class so thats pretty cool. and he seemed pretty nice too. but i know i will have to go to that like all the time cuz he gives unannounced quizzes and thats not so cool, lol. going to class at 8 is definitely gonna suck but getting out at 10 is gonna be awesome! so i went home and got my eat on and then took a quick nap and watched tv. i should have done something productive but i didnt even think about it. 

so i wasnt really looking forward to going to my late class at 5:45 but the prof seemed really organized and i like that so hopefully that class will go well. i need to go print off notes actually. 

so just alittle reading tonight and thats it. but im not feeling so well so im gonna go take a bubble bath or something and see if i can feel better. read alittle and get to bed early cuz im tired. i hope everyone else had an awesome first day! sorry this was so boring, i just felt like writing about my day! goodnight all!

can't wait til the 17th!"

"event","haha thats me and my roommate's new saying. it's pretty awesome! lol i'm such a dork. so we've just been hanging out in our room alot. being loser, watching tv and being on AIM. thats the way to go. we've been really lazy lately but its all good. once school starts it'll get hectic. 

we got our books yesterday and samantha reserved hers from the MSC bookstore and she was in there for a freakin hour waiting in line. i felt bad for her. i was freakin out tho cuz i figured she would be done in like 20 minutes at the latest so i went around like the entire MSC looking for her, it was pretty funny. but then i found her downstairs below the bookstore. so then when we were done after an hour we went to Traditions to get my books which took like a total of 5 whole minutes. it was awesome. and my books werent too expensive. i had a bunch of gift cards tho so i got like $50 off so that was alot of help. then last night we went to see the princess diaries 2, hehe, i had already seen it but she hadn't and i wanted to see it again. it was cute the second time as well. 

i've been so lazy since i've been here. i've hardly gone out and i haven't gone to see anyone yet. i think i might go see james and drew tonight and see their new apartment. that would be fun, i havent seen them in a loooong time! well im gonna go continue being lazy. later!"

"event","and its really weird. there's so many people living here this year. i feel like really small in a mass full of people. i feel like i dont know anyone. i'm sure it will get better. my roommates seem nice, haven't really seen much of mine yet. but it's just the first day so it'll change. it's just kinda strange. i feel like a freshman all over again. but jessica and laura visited the cambridge today so that was cool! it was good to see familiar faces. :) 

well i think thats all for right now. more later. 

missing you already!"

"event","wow alot of people are already back and i'm still at home. my dorm doesn't open for good on wednesday. i'll be there soon enough. i'm getting more and more excited about going back and meeting new people including my roommates. theres so many things i need to do today. i got finish packing up my room. i hate packing. but we all gotta do it! i could not sleep last night thinking about leaving and starting over. i didnt fall asleep until about 3am i think. i was laying there tossing and turning. i figured i should do something productive, lol, so i wrote down the rest of the stuff i need to pack and some things my roommates and i should talk about when we all get settled in and our parents all leave. one day you might read this so...i'm so excited to meet you guys! Samantha, Jami and Lynn! :)

i feel so weird leaving this year. last year i couldn't wait to leave to get away. and now it's just like...eh. i mean, sure my parents get on my nerves every now and then but i still love them. i have a feeling that i'm not going to be seeing them as much this fall semester. i dont think i will go home that often. i dont really need to. first year everyone went home on weekends that we didn't have a football game cuz college was new and home was comfortable but now its like, college is the comfortable place, the place you belong. i miss it. 2 more days! 

well i want to get everything else packed by today so i better get on it. hope everyone is having fun moving in and such!

i'm not ready to say goodbye."

"event","lol...i've been sick for the past couple of days. yuck. it's definitely no fun especially when you have to move into your dorm. so i decided to move in my stuff early to the cambridge to ""beat the crowd"" HA! i pulled up to the parking lot and had never seen so many cars there in my life! i saw camille though and all the RAs that are still there so that was awesome! she said that there were 300 people checking in today!! and that 200 more will come on wednesday. good lord! she said that there are only 3 efficiencies left that aren't taken. that means theres like 550 people living there now! which is awesome! more people to meet! 

so i got there and was kind of overwhelmed at the amount of people there cuz last year there was like less than 100 people living there so it will be a big change this year. i got my room key and all that jazz and when i got to my room, i saw that my roommate, Samantha, had already moved in. but she didnt take the side i wanted so that was good :) man i have a crap load of stuff. chris came with me and my parents to help move everything in, thank god he came cuz i would have had to do most of it while being sick so thank you again :) but once i got everything in there it looked pretty awesome! i'm glad we went when we did cuz it started to pour just as we were about done and everyone was running around with their stuff and i felt bad for them. so i got to see a little taste of what this year is going to be like. i talked to kim online and she said that there seemed to be alot of nice people there so thats cool. i'm excited! and also nervous...

when i got home i called my roommate again cuz we had been playing phone tag all week so we finally got to talk. shes seems pretty nice! we didnt talk that long but we'll get to talk more on wednesday when we go back. she liked my ducks shower curtain, lol so thats good. and i hope we get along with the other two girls in the room. i havent talked to either of them yet but i'm sure it will all work out. it was a good thing we didnt all move in at the same time cuz i had so much stuff! i dont remember packing up all the stuff...actually yeah i do, lol. it took forever!

well today i just have to get more of my stuff at home ready so that i can move in on wednesday. 3 more days :)   :("

"event","haven't felt like updating lately. everyone always starts with that when they haven't journaled in awhile. 

my parents have been out of town since saturday early morning so i've been by myself for a couple of days. it reminds me of what its like to be in college station, sorta. its kinda scary here at night. and i'm never scared at night in CS. and my uncle isn't right next door in cs either, lol. i miss being on my own, its been nice this week. i wanted to go out the other night at 9:30 and my dad didnt want me to cuz it was too late already he said. i was like ""wtf mate"" but i didnt really say that, lol. he normally lets me but i guess he didnt want to that day, who knows. 

i saw the village last night with chris. it was alright. m. night shymalan's movies have been better in the past. i felt cheated when you find out the big twist. i was like ""thats it??"" but i was still scared during the movie. with all the scary music and weird turns around the corner type stuff. the movie theatre was like a tomb though! there was absolutely no one there. it was kind of scary! we were like the last two people in there. freakyness.

i think my parents come back tomorrow but i can't really remember. lol. maybe i'll call them later and see what they have been up to. i heard they played tennis yesterday. haha. i can just see my dad running around huffing and puffing chasing after the ball. i heard my mom won. haha awesome.

well i gotta go clean. yay for cleaning. yay go me. 

until next time."

"event","anne wrote a really great journal last night about loving your life whereever you are. if you are reading this anne, i just want to say thank you. last night i was really upset. when i leave for A&M, i'll be away from someone really important to me now. anne's journal gave me some hope that it can be done. i'm really excited about going back to college. getting back in my dorm, getting to classes on the bus, walking past the quad, running after the bus i missed. all that stuff. i cant wait to go to taco c in the middle of the night for some quesadillas. i can't wait to get away from my parents! lol. but i'm also going to be far away from chris and that scares me alittle. we've gotten so close and now he'll be 500 miles away and i won't see him and get to hug him everyday. i might see him a few times over the semester. and i'm afraid of getting back and not knowing him at all. but it's not as far as anne is going and anne probably doesnt get to come home until christmas. so thank you anne for writing that. it was just what i needed to see."

"event","You see him in the corner of your eye, 
And notice he is staring back at you. 
He sees deep within you as if you hide your soul, 
He is your prince with the glass slipper shoe. 
The time spent with you hand in hand, 
You walk everywhere, forgetting everything in the past, 
There is something on you as if a band, 
Making every minute together last. 
There is nothing to describe the fate, 
The red rose is not deep enough to see, 
The passion that will last, until the late, 
Birds sing, waking those beyond the blue sea. 
Your dreams of yesterday have now come true, 
Your wings of hope have spread as you flew.

"event","Life is about money,
life is about fame,
life is never funny,
life's always the same.
We kick & claw up to the top,
not caring who we hurt,
nothing can ever make us stop,
pushing others to the dirt.
What can ever make us say,
that we all are wrong,
before we throw it all away,
let's admit what we knew all along.
Life is being happy,
life is knowing love,
life is tears, it's sappy,
life's all the joy we know of.
Life is sometimes carelessness,
life is some mistakes,
life is absentmindedness,
life gives so you can take.
We always search for the meaning of life,
we've always known the truth,
but all our fear, it makes us lie,
so I'll walk all over you.

"event","This feeling I can't understand. Actually it's not a feeling at all. I need a friend to call. I need to turn this numbness into something real. I need something to feel. Maybe if i screeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaammmmmmmm!!! It'll help? Doesn't seem to work. Nothing does. I wish i could just be happy like i was. And now im in a room full of friends. But the freezing inside never ends. I'm shivvering from the inside out. Where's my passion? Where's my inspiration? Where the fuck is my dedication!? Now I leave my friends and walk home. All alone. the wind blowing at my back. Vibrance is what i lack. If i go home and write a song about this blizzard occurring in my soul, will it go away? Will i have positive things to say?"

"event","I stare out the window
the cars rushing below
it reminds me of life
they're headed somewhere that is unknown
in a beautiful city I hope to one day call home
to make crazy friends and hang at endless shows
my home is a place I cannot stand
but I seem to long for it's comfort
my own bed and all my stuff
the pictures on my wall
the mess on the floor
and there are people waiting for the bus
I hope they are off to have fun with friends
I hope this because I have longed to see my own
right now we'd be making memories and a toast
I'v been here and had a time
but I feel I have worn out my welcome 
they love me but want me gone
their cold silence are words unsaid
silence is always the shaper knife
that penetraits much deeper inside
and I fear I will go home and still feel i don't belong
on this road...headed toward the unknown.-Mocha"

"event","You walk down the streets with black hair that you've died.
Poetry stuck in your messenger bag, filled with pages on which you've cried.
You're converse are squeaking against the pavement.
Your really aching from the heart you've lent.
You're friends have got their own problems.
Sometimes they understand....
A lot of them just want to goof off while you're determined to start a band.
You love them.
But it seems they never listen when u read them you're songs.
You suppose there's always one thing everyone longs....
For you, its to be understood.
To tell a certain member of your family you want to be a musician, and for them to say You should.
Or to share the same interests in music with a lover.
Go to shows and mosh and agree its the perfect date.
but for now, you seem alone, and continue to wait.....

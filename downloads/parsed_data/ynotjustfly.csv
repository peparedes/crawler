"event","this weekend..

friday- went to orthodontist in the morning and then later drove to gas station to meet my wonderful amazing wife samantha. once we met up there i left my mother and went with sams family up north to waupaca camping! once we got there and unpacked everything me, sam, trevor, and jimmy went to ronnys (spelling?) and went out on the jetskis. then we went back and ate and went over to a campfire. at the campfire i played poker with some drunk people and won $7.50. no one was very happy i took there money... then by the campfire later that night i got t cuddle with sam!!!

saturday- woke up at like 11 and went to the little wolf river or something to go tubing down the river. and this is tubing where you float down it and no motors are involved.. the big group we were with kept getting caught on rocks. so i got out and walked the tubes down the river a couple times. i ended up tipping/falling in around 3 or 4 times. oh and the water was FREEZING. then when we came back we went around the campfire and stayed there until around 2. during this campfire extravaganza, jim, a drunk, said some funny things like .. Sharon you have some white stuff in ur hair and you have some white stuff around your lips too. she didnt get it..? all the while me and sam cuddled.

sunday- we packed stuff up and went over to ronnys again. we met up with the 50 pound kids and went to jellystone campground in fremont. at the lake there we went out and the jetskis and such. after that we started driving back to jackson. on the way back sam decided to leave me and go to sleep. right after she left her mom yelled at me to not go back with her. then trevor and i played the worst game of war ever. it was insanely long and dumb. soon we got back and i got the tour of the peterson home. i liked sams wall... she knows what im talking about. :-). then when i was being taken home, jimmy decided he would be real nice and make fun of me because i dont know the road names to get back to my house from jackson... thnx. then after they got the tour of my house sadly sam left.... :-(!!!!

"event","I've always had trouble finding the right pay-by-the-hour motel but this one didn't look so bad. It was a Universal Soldier-type whorehouse, with little bungalows peppering the fenced-off area behind the main office. I didn't want to ask questions, typically one doesn't when the guy behind the counter looks like an impoverished grunt with a cigarette hanging from his tracheotomy tube and a bottle of je ne sais quoi in a paper bag. ""Carnies..."" he babbled. ""They're right outside the window! Huge eyes! Get the gun from the drawer... I have two fake arms."" I averted my eyes to the perfectly good arms hanging off his torso and then diverted them to the water cooler behind him. The water cooler full of brown water. This was not the time to be Weak.

""You crusty chav... I need -- A room!"" I could've been William Shatner the way it flowed out of my mouth. My speech turned into something resembling muscular spasms and I let go of my baggage to form a white-knuckled fist. Brought it down hard on the desk. ""A room, dammit! Snap out of it, man! Can you not see this is Urgent? Can we not Communicate properly?"" His neck fat shook and shuddered as he breathed, his eyes grew, I was certain they would fall out of their sockets. Calmly, daintily, he handed me a key marked A4 and sat back to pass out.

The key fit in the rusty socket and unlocked the door, but I was prepared to kick it down. The doorjambs stuck to the door like it hadn't been opened in three millenniums, like they had been slathered on the holes around the door themselves to block out the clean air or to rubber cement the condemned building. It was like an omen. Stepping inside I wondered what the place next door looked like, because after wallpaper torn to the middle of the wall and a shower that ran brown and cold, it felt mighty appealing to sell my soul to Satan. ""Calm down,"" I told myself. ""This isn't so bad. I have slept in worse places."" My thoughts crept back to hard-nipple wet dreams of the Brazilian outback and my grandparents' riverside shack, the spot I almost took off my own arm jumping around in trees.



I'm feeling the worst sort of heartache and it's more self-righteous than longing or jealousy. Like I'm missing someone I never knew but they're still absent, they're still Not There.


What does everyone think of that goddamned European Constitution? Who has actually sat down to read it? Who cares?

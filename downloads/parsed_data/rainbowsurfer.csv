"event","Me and Cara broke up like a week ago. Oh well its ok. I wasnt that attached to her so theres not hard feelings for me. We only seen each other a total of like 10 days since Feb. which was when we started to go out. She broke up with me cause she says shes not ready for a relationship. She also said that the distance was killing her. She went to school in Jersey. She says that when shes ready for a relationship I will be the first one to know. She said she loved me after she broke up with me. Which I found kinda weird. I am not going to sit around and wait for her to ask me back out shes not worth my time. I mean she kinda fucked with my feelings. I hate when people do that. I thought I loved her. But I really didnt it must have been infatuation. It couldnt have been real love it just couldnt. If it was it wouldnt have taken me around 3 days to get over her. If it was real love it would have taken alot longer then it took me. Ok I am now looking for someone else. I do have one person in mind but I am not sure if she like me like that or not. Ill just sit back and see where life takes me. If life doesnt take me to her then it just wasnt meant to be. How ever I will talk to her and stuff in the mean whiles. On April 8th Cara is supposed to sing. But I dont think I am going to go watch her sing. But hey I dont know. Maybe I will. Its not just up to me either its also up to her. I will never do anything that she didnt want that would hurt her. I mean I still care about her in the way I dont want her hurt. WHY DO RELATIONSHIPS HURT LIKE HELL?
                                   
   Some Poem I Found That I Like

Blood, blood, the sight of it excites me.
I'm such a mess, slippery, excuse me.
I spent all day writing die on the wall,
And my hands all bloody and my fingertips raw
To the bone bone.
Now I'm all alone and Malaki speakin to me,
Callin on the crow.
Mixed with the blood, on the third night,
Will allow the dead to walk again in the sunlight
~Jami Madrox, Dark Lotus - Gimme Dat Blood~

<h2>Men See You As Choosy</h2>
Men notice you light years before you notice them
You take a selective approach to dating, and you can afford to be picky
You aren't looking for a quick flirt - but a memorable encounter
It may take men a while to ask you out, but it's worth the wait

"event","I am just sitting here at home right now when I am supposed to be in school. Well it really doesnt matter if I do go to first period or not. Well since my teacher is a bitch and is not giving me credits. I just go to class when I want to. When I dont feel like going to class I just dont. I go to all my other classes. I mean cause my teachers in those subjects are not bitches. I get credits for those classes. I am still just a lil tired. Well its kinda weird that I am tired cause I went to bed at like 6 at night last night. My mom knows that I cut and she doesnt care. She is just like so why are you cutting the first time I told her. I told her cause I was not getting any credits. She was like ok. Just dont cut the subjects that you do get credits for. My mom is nice. Shes like my friend. I can basicly tell her anything. Well I am goign to get some food and then leave for classes. Please respond. Someone please respond."

"event","I am still sick. When will it ever end. I did get some what better in certain areas. But I got worse in some to. I was having a stomach ache, felt weak, had a fever kept gaging, kept sweating, tired at all times, dont feel like eating anything at all, yea and thats pretty much all of it. Now I just feel weak, gaging more, sweating a lil less, I still dont feel like eating anything, and now I can actually stay up for a few hours. Rather then just like 2 minutes. So I dont have a stomach ache. I feel a lil stronger then I did the last few days. I dont think that I have a fever any more. The sweating has gone down alot. I am able to stay up for just a tad bit longer then before. And I still dont even wana eat any food. I stayed home from school again today. Well I got out of going to the quack doc. The school must be getting mad. Cause they keep on calling the house and my moms cell. Yea but we are not picking it up. Well why should we waste time on a unexcussed absence. I really did try to go to school today. But I just couldnt. I am so bored. I cant wait to get better. I feel like shit."

"event","I am still sick. I cant miss school tomorrow or my quacky doctor will find alot of reasons to give me a 1000 shots. I hate shots. But I love pain so go figure. Weird right? Anyways I found this thing on someones away message that I liked so yea I am go to copy and paste it. Do ever long conversations on the phone, can't get you out of my mind. Baby are you feeling me, feeling you. Everything you say and everything you do, get's me lost at your days at a time. Tell me are u feelin me feelin you. Yup that it. Yea so yea I am missing something deeply in my heart. This guy had the same thing last week that I had this week. I kinda freaky cause I mean like I was not even around him when he was sick. He doesnt know what it is. But his doctor told him that it is something that you get from a lack of sleep. Well I so understand how I got that. I mean like I never really do sleep that much. I am pretty much like always awake. Today I actually stayed up. Thats cool cause from like Friday at 4 to like today I have been sleeping. My body wanted to sleep all day but I did not let it. Just watch that I regret it some how or another. Well I am still sick so I am going to go back to sleep once agains."

"event","I just keep gaging. I dont really know why or how it happened it just did. I wana go to bake night but I am sick. So i cant go :( My girl is going but I cant since I am sick. Today is my girls b-day. HAPPY BIRTHDAY SHERI. Love you. I really did want to earn money for camp. I have never been sick like this before. Its kinda weird. I wana see my girl so I can give her the things. But I guess Monday may be a better day to give her the things. I hope that I can do that thing on Monday. If I dont then I dont know if I will ever be able to again. I dont wana be sick on Monday. I really dont feel like going to my doctor. I hate my Doctor. He is really cool when it comes to writing school notes and that is the only reason that I still go to him. I really dont feel like getting 500 shots cause I am a lil sick. Any ways I have been sleeping for ever. I am sick. So I guess that it is good that I am sleeping. Cause then maybe I can get better by Monday. I miss my girl so much. Last night I had Starbucks and Cold Stone. Today I only had like Starbucks. I am craving Dasani water so bad. Dasani water would be better then Poland Spring on my stomach. Bacause Dasan water is smoother on the stomach then Poland Spring. Well at least for me it is. I Love you and miss you. Yea I believe that every knows who that was to. If not you are probably ust a tad slow."

"event","Today I dont really feel good. I keep on gaging. I am a lil mad at someone but I'll get over it i always do. I have slept all day. I had spent my school day in ISS today. I cut class, I was 10 min late for class, and I kept my hoodie hood on at lunch. The person who wrote me up was Mr. Moriarty. I hate him. There are so many reasons as to why I hate him. There are way to many to name. Nobody understands me. Nobody knows where I am coming from. I dont even think that my girl understands y I hate Mr Moriarty. I heard a pop in the ISS room from my hand. My hand hurts. Its swollen and when u touch it u can feel a bone poping out. I am supposed to go to a bake thingie today. But I dont know if I am going to go cause I dont feel all that good. I dont even know y I am going to go. I mean I cant bake ill probably start a fire or something. I really do not want to set a house on fire. Well not today at least. I am sick and staying up late I am so weird. Well I guess I should be up considering I was sleeping when I got home from Hanging. I got home like at 4. I cut through the fence. You kinda have to climb the fence in a way. Going down is much easier the going up. Wow that so did not sound right. Oh well it could just be me and my perverted mind. I got home so late because I was out hanging at starbucks and cold stone for a while with my girl. I love hanging out after school with my girl. I dont know y i got sick. Or what I got sick from. I am so happy that my girl changing my journal it looks better now. U see that pic of the surf board and the rainbow in that background that is so much my life. Wana know how oks the rainbow in the background is my sexuality and the duude with the board is representing how I love surfing. My girl is so awsome. I was mad before I was writing in this journal. But I feel happy now. I feel like someone is there for me now. Journal I know that u will always be there for me even when no one else is. I guess thats because u cant move LOL. I love this journal thing. Any ways today is my girls B-Day. I got her some gifts. Which I normally do not do. Well at least with my own money. I hope that she like the gifts but even if she dont at least I tryed. But I am almost positive that she will like the gifts. I love my girl with all my heart. I love you Sheri. You really do mean the world to me."

"event","HI ... im here and this is my new journal yay.... one thing.... HOMOPHOBES SUCK MY PUSSY..... NAH I WISH.... HOMOPHOBES SUCK BIGTIME... THEY SHOULD ALL DIE AND GO TO HELL... HEE HEE

Ok I just got done for today. I took my shower and I am ready for bed but I cant just seem to fall asleep. Oh well anyways. I have a girlfriend and I love her so much. I dont know what I would do with out her. I probably would not even be able think or eat. Every one thinks that I am anorexic and it really pisses me off because I am not skinny at least I do not think so. Thats one thing that gets to me people calling me anorexic. Most people do not know me all that well to be saying that shit. I have a fear that everyone must know about I have a fear of girls that are either bi or lez turning straight that just freaks me out.

I am kinda mad right now because I cant swim. That is one of the ways that i relieve the stress in my life. I dont know what it is really its kinda weird everyone hates swimming. They complain when they have to swim. I just hop in the pool. I am very happy when I get to swim when the pools are not open. Thats one of my favorite things to do. I can only do it in the summer :( When I swim in seasons aside from summer. I feel special when I can swim. I hope my teacher understands the reason that I can not swim. Only some people know why I can not swim. I  just hope I can make the days up the I miss. I just LOVE SWIMMING."

"event","Well i don't have any thing too random like my other posts but i can say that I have found the meaning of life. Its that there is no meaning just a bunch of people sitting around looking for it thus creating a meaning for them which they will almost never figure out. In short (for all the people that are too stupid to under stand what i just said) the only way there is a meaning is for a person to make one for them self, every one makes there on meaning unless they figure out what i did and then they all ready know what it is and life is now pointless because they all ready found out what the meaning is."

I love them sooooo much.
I sure didn't want to come home.

But now i'm back and some sneaky person wrote on my car today...
who was it?  my guess is Megan, GA, and Lacey.
Thanks for making me feel loved guys.

Best moments of this past week:
shaving cream fight
learning to wake board and succeeding
spending time with Annie, Lou, Pat, Tay, Will, and Drew
playing four square
floating in the water
swings with annie!
lunch with my aunt cary
BE a MAN!
making hemp bracelets for everyone
eating ice cream, pudding, and cheese cake on the beach
then of course our great time together after we ate on the beach;)
I LOVE YOU GUYS! THANKS FOR THE BEST WEEK EVER~"

Ben and Annie are my favorite because they can entertain me at 12:06 in the morning...the day of the hit....dundunDUN!

Let's see what i did on saturday:
awoke to a beautiful day at noon~ isn't it weird how the day before a hurricane it's always pretty

ate some breakfast b/c that's all i can eat right when i wake up...not lunch
hummm.........

organized my cd's = very important business 

watched movies

hung out with the wonderful awesome amazing suzanne

talked online to my wonderful texas buddies

and that was my day for you! exciting...i know



so here you go, for your hurricane entertainment, i give you a questionnaire to cease the boredom for a moment in time: (post your answers)
1.  If you could be stuck in a sealed room with one person for 3 days and 4 nights, who would it be and why?
2.  If you could be a dance move for 10 years what would it be?
3.  If you could be any where in the world right now, where would it be?
4.  What is your brilliant plan for stopping the hurricane from coming (i know you've thought about it)?
5.  If you were a hershey bar would you rather be frozen and forgotten about, be melted in a young boys pocket and then put in the laundry, become a smore, be the topping on ice cream, or just eattin?

Hope all of you play it safe!

I love you all dearly.  hughug kiss kiss"

I have.





God has a plan in it all, but right now it's 
hard to trust, 
hard to believe,
hard to overcome this moment.



I'm so blessed.

I hope you are enjoying every moment.

I'm back writing and looking at my livejournal now!  woohoo  I know your excited.
well for the past 40 days (actually it ended up being longer than that b/c i'm a slacker) I've been fasting from the world (livejournal and aim) and feasting on God, while reading a book that went along with it.  It was amazing.  The book is A Call to Die if you are interested, let me know.  God is so good!!!!

So....school is almost out.  Yay!  I want to hear everyone's summer plans.

Guess what....Suzanne Beard is starting up cell group again this summer at my house.  I'm so excited.  Same time too.  We're starting soon but don't know exactly when.  if you were involved with it before--you better be back, but if you have know idea what it is then you better come check it out.  

I had a great day.  I just want to thank you personally for being an amazing person in my life.  You are incredible and I just don't know what I would do without you to make me smile!  Thanks~"

"event","AMAZING!

today was great b/c it was friday and i only went to school for 4 periods then got checked out.
and guess where i went.......
not to the moon
not to the top of the Eiffel tower
no...
to see the dead sea scrolls in mobile with Nika, my mo, Alex Tredway, and her mo

Let me just tell you it was amazing.  it was a pretty big exhibit and the scrolls were so cool.  it was crazy to think how old they are (around the time of Christ) and how preserved they were.  The scrolls were found by a shepard throwing a rock while he was trying to find a lost goat.  the rock fell into a hole.  before the boys knew it, they had discovered a cave with lost history in it--pieces of the bible!  These documents are the oldest scrolls of the bible found which was 1000 years earlier then the next documents.  that means that the bible was kept almost exactly the same by word of mouth for 1000 years....crazy!  it was so cool to see the actual thing.  the writing was all in hebrew so we couldn't exactly read it but there was translations and i was able to pick out the word Lord in one of them (which was cool).  

If you ever have a chance to go...take it!!!!
This is a once in a lifetime chance and experience.

As for the rest of the day...
we went to spring hill college to go to a flower festival
which by the way i saw this gorgeous arch which is going to be at my wedding...i've decided!
then we visited spring hill a little bit with one of my cousins that goes there.
It was really an awesome school.  I'm seriously thinking about it.  It was all i wanted in a college...but i'm worried about it being a Catholic college.  that's the only thing

then we went to dinner...yum yum...i ate salad...go me! :)

So i had a wonderful day and i certainly hope you did too.

Be blessed by His grace."

First Priority this morning..whoopwhoop!

then FCAT.  i finished in like 20 mins.  then i almost got in trouble for taking out vocab study cards when the test was still on my desk.  she got really mad.  but o well.  so i study until my heart was content b/c i had to make-up the test 5th period.  well i ended up having so much time that i just about wanted to stand up-scream, rip my cards in half, then run all through the halls singing :) soooo boring and pointless.  why do adults have to force me into doing absolutly pointless things in my life...i mean my life is ticking away in that useless spent time.

vocab test was ok.  mrs. mcleod had a sentence that read like this:
After hearing the emphatic (loud, shout, noisy) sounds coming from the cafeteria the deans rushed to the __________ _________ (change word), to discipline the ________,_________ students.  ahhh crazy who's ever heard of 4 blanks in one sentence!

Then we watched a moive in physics.

worked in spanish....boooo

then i went home and slept.  which was much needed

when i awoke, i went over to suzanne's for a yummy dinner she made sergei, ben, and i...it was great fun

now i'm home.  

If you don't know it already, you are loved and appreciated!"

So, back to reality.  I'm supposed to be letting her go.  Does this mean I'm supposed to stop thinking about her?  Am I not supposed to imagine scenes with her?  I guess I should just enjoy them, the thoughts and scenes.  I should get out of them what I can and then let them go.
I just can't believe it's snowing.  Hopefully the weather shapes up later on  because I am taking Wyatt trick or treating tonight at 6."

I am learning some how to let go of everyday things that can bother me and see them for what they are.  Close my eyes and take a deep breath and just let it go.  I am amazed at how easy it is and how good I feel when I don't get bothered by the little things.  WIth the bigger things I am realizing that I shouldn't fret over stuff I can't change.  I create every emotion I feel, so if I feel bad, it is my own fault.  It's a liberating way to look at life.  I am finding contentment with myself."

The students just got back into town last week and it was about 2:30 in the morning.  The bars just closed and I figured some idiot kid was climbing the tank so I called to cops to check it out.  Turned out to be nothing.  A couple years ago we had 2 college kids climb the tank to try to vandalize it, with a video camera to record everything they did.  They got arrested.  Getting woke by the pager at this hour of the morning can be startling.  Now I am just waiting to mellow out and get back to sleep. At least I'll snag some OT for this."

"event","You notice it's mostly married men who get addicted to porn.  Why?  Monogamy.  It's a man-made invention meant to trap guys into (rightfully) being parents invented in the biblical days.  Not saying men should not handle their responsibilities and whatnot, just saying that I don't need a legal reason to take care of my progeny.  But I digress, monogamy kills sexuality in like 80% of cases.  We (both man and woman) were never meant to be monogamous.  
So, you notice the prevalence of horny women on porn websites.  It used to be that you could argue that ""porn was fake"" and that ""real women didn't do the things in porn"" (#1 reason it became popular to begin with...), but today...89% of the videos aren't professional.  They're homemade clips of regular gals doing dirty shit with some dude they thought enough of to fuck.  Porno shit.  The kind of shit you hope your mom never knew about.  So when men today look at porn, they see all these guys getting some filthy fucking and wondering to themselves, ""why not me?""  Then they look at their old and fat wives (btw, some of the nastiest shit was the ""bbw"" crowd...) and go, ""she hasn't so much as cared about sex in 5 years, why would she do any of that for me?""
With that, the bored husband starts to seek out pleasure in other ways.  Porn.  Online.  24hours a day availability."

"event","I know this will piss a lot of people off which is why I'm writing here on LJ because, hey...who uses LJ anymore? LOL

The feminist movement has all but shoved a ton of crap down our throats, most recently, the phrase ""slut-shaming"".  As someone who made the terrible error of marrying one of these whores, I have a few choice words for supporters of stopping this practice:

""You are all fucking idiots.""

Slut shaming was pretty much started by men waaaay back in the Puritan days of America.  It was then adopted wholeheartedly by women, who as time passed, took it to whole new heights.  Men pretty much got over it because hey, a good slut used to be hard to find, and what guy wants to shame a chick into not giving up that which we invest so much time and effort into getting?

You see, women were/are the ones who took slut shaming to new heights.  It really started in high school, where if a particular girl got around with the football team and got all of the attention from boys, she was immediately deemed ""slut"".  Wait, I think I'm getting ahead of myself...  Let's first run a definition of the word ""slut"" before we delve any further into this (warning, your personal definition of slut may differ):

- <b>Slut</b>; 
<i>adjective, noun</i> - Meaning to have high amounts of sexual partners that exceeds the social norm and standard.  eg; (adj,noun) ""That girl is a total slut. She had a threesome with these guys last week.""  
<i>verb</i> - To exhibit overtly sexual behavior.  eg; (verb) ""Man, when she goes out, she really knows how to slut it up good.""

So back to how it all began, women did it.  Females, usually between post-pubescent and pre-menopause ages, championed this thinking because a slut basically lowers the value of female ""currency"".  A lot of people don't like to admit this, but guys want mostly nothing but sex from a woman he finds physically attractive.  If I ask you out, and we bang on the first date, then I have achieved my goals and can move on to the next female.  Why?  We're programmed that way (much to the chagrin of fem-nazi's).  If women try to emulate that behavior, most of the time they end up emotionally damaged.  Please, ask me how I know.  I'll wait.  Now, if as a woman, you play ""the game"", and build my interest in things about you other than the warm hole in between your legs for a month or so, then just maybe I'll continue sticking around because I've actually gotten to know you as a human being.

Truth is, if you ask a ""slut"" why she did what she did, most of the time, you'll get an answer that is not ""because it felt good"".  I mean, sure men and women have needs both of us.  But the disparate proportion of how many men a woman can bed vs how many women a man can bed leads to competition and jealousy.  Men are competitive by nature.  We compete for jobs, we (used to) compete for the affections of women, we compete with each other.  Now we have to compete with the women we are trying to bed? No thank you.  (see: rising divorce rate)  Between the loss of religious morality where a woman's chastity was her key to being taken care of by a man, and the feminist pussification of men, that female currency is all but useless.  Why am I going to stay with you and take responsibility when you have asked no one else to?

I know we're all supposedly moving to ""utopian"" and whatnot, but the reality is a woman's body is a temple a man feels he must conquer.  Sadly, the young men growing up today do not know the joy of that conquest.  Women are giving it up too easily, and the ""currency"" of women as a whole is cheapened, and when something is cheap, you don't feel like investing much into it. 

Honestly, some of this slut-shaming IS male driven.  The male ego is a constantly evolving and fragile thing.  Feminists won't be happy until they have taken everything from us.  Don't misunderstand me, I'm not saying men and women can't be equals in some arena's of life, it's just that there are some we are never going to be equals in.  Period.  The slut-shaming rule is very relative with men.  If a woman sleeps with more guys than the man, she's a slut.  If not, she may be date-able.  Most guys don't give a shit if a slut gives it up because hey, they're giving the male what he wants.  It's when that slut wants to be with them exclusively that things get messy.  The male ego can't really handle being beaten (there are exceptions; see ""cuckold"").  When women decide to sleep around, it is 150% easier for them to get laid than the investment in time and energy a man has to put in.  That difference, and that lack of self-control by women, is why the occasional male slut-shaming happens.

Fact is, and I know the feministas will lose their shit over this statement, <b>MEN AND WOMEN ARE DIFFERENT ANIMALS ENTIRELY IN OUR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL NEEDS.</b>  You are NOT men.  You will be emotionally damaged by slutting around.  But hey, don't take my word for it, I'm just an old-fashioned middle age man who's about to be divorced because his emotionally damaged ex-slut of a wife just can't seem to get it together for the sake of this marriage.  And to be fair, <i>I</i> made the mistake of marrying her thinking I could live in this utopian feminist world where a woman can get banged by every guy she meets, sometimes in duplicate and triplicate, and I am supposed to not care.

So please.  Keep shaming the sluts.  It's the only way they'll learn that they are not men.  It's the only way they'll learn that they have value that goes beyond standard human ideology.  I'm not saying call a rape victim a slut.  I'm not saying enact Shariah law and make women cover up (I do enjoy looking at them).  All I'm asking as that women take it upon themselves to re-value their currency.  Too often in today's life do we preach making decisions that have no repercussions.  The feminists are telling girls and women to go ahead and behave a certain way and expect no consequences.

Instead of telling society to change their thinking on female sexuality because ""men do it"", maybe teach girls the value of themselves.  Men are not the sole-reason girls are growing up with such horrible self-esteem issues.  Women are just as much to blame for giving such shitty advice.  We are NOT the same.  We will NEVER be the same.  It's time someone stood up to the feminist bullies and pointed that out."

I'm gone.  You will never find me again. You will never put bullshit restraining orders on me again.

You will however, probably suck someone else's dick just like you sucked mine.  Just like you sucked Dee's.  You're a fuckin' worthless WHORE and only God can forgive you.  Cause I never will.

Fuck you.  Die.  Yeah I said it.  And what's worse is that I actually mean it.  My life would be better if you just died.  I wish you had've died on that operating table...at least I'd be truly happy now.

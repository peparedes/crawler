Make her laugh. Pick her up & pretend you're going to throw her in the pool... she'll scream & fight you but secretly, she'll love it. Tell her your secrets. Listen to hers. Call her just to say hi. Hold her hand while you talk. Hold her hand while you drive. Just hold her hand. Look her in the eyes when you talk to her. Protect her. Support her. Tell her stupid jokes. Tickle her, even if she says stop. Slow dance with her. When she starts swearing at you, tell her you love her. Let her fall asleep in your arms. Get her mad, then kiss her. Tease her. Let her tease you back. When you're just laying there together, rub her back. Stay up with her when shes sick. Kiss her forehead. Be faithful. Let her wear your clothes. Kiss her in the rain. And when you fall in love with her, tell her...

"event","I am going to start living my life freely.With no worries.This summer I am promising myself a road trip.Where I go,I go and whoever I am with,I am with.As long as I have the gas money and fresh undies everyday,I can make it.Its not even about what famous person I may see in Cali,or how many new clothes I buy from Versace or any other store.Its about me.Me and my life.Me and my friends.No one else matters.If you dont like me.So what.If I dont like you,there is probably a great reason why,cause I usually get along with everyone.I dont care.I have no time for drama my life is too important to fight over boys or he say she say.Its pointless.Any immature person can fight,but it takes a strong person to talk,or even just ignore.Get over the little stuff.You wont even know why you didnt like someone as soon as you get out of highschool.And the main reason people hate is because of jealousy.I refuse to deal with it.My Mom always told me how Beautiful I am inside and out,And I finally realize she isnt talkin about how ""Hot"" I look when I get all ready and dressed up.She is talkin about how nice I am and how no matter what I look like I am beautiful to her.I think everyone should see other people like that.Life would be so much easier if everything was MINUS the Drama.


Just Live Life Freely...

"event","This is the BEST song created...


I didn't mean it
When I said I didn't love you, so
I should have held on tight
I never shoulda let you go
I didn't know nothing
I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I could not fathom that I would ever
Be without your love
Never imagined I'd be
Sitting here beside myself
Cause I didn't know you
Cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
Cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give
To have you lying by my side
Right here, cause baby
(We belong together)

[chorus]
When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on
When times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

I can't sleep at night
When you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Saying to me
""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute
This is too deep (too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial
Trying to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
""I only think of you""
And it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together
But I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things, crying
Trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
It ain't even half of what
I'm feeling inside
I need you
Need you back in my life, baby

[chorus]
When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on
When times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together, baby

[chorus]
When you left I lost a part of me 
It's still so hard to believe 
Come back baby, please 
Cause we belong together 

Who am I gonna lean on 
When times get rough 
Who's gonna talk to me
Till the sun comes up 
Who's gonna take your place 
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby, baby
We belong together

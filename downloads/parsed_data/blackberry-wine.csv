"event","&nbsp;<span class=""postbody"">When things in your lives seem almost too much to handle, when 24 hours in a day are not enough, remember the mayonnaise jar and the 2 cups of coffee. <br /><br />A professor stood before his philosophy class and had some items in front of him. When the class began, he wordlessly picked up a very large and empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with golf balls. <br /><br />He then asked the students if the jar was full. They agreed that it was. <br /><br />The professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles rolled into the open areas between the golf balls. <br /><br />He then asked the students again if the jar was full. They agreed it was. <br /><br />The professor next picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand filled up everything else. <br /><br />He asked once more if the jar was full. The students responded with an unanimous 'yes.' <br /><br />The professor then produced two cups of coffee from under the table and poured the entire contents into the jar effectively filling the empty space between the sand. The students laughed. <br /><br />""Now,' said the professor as the laughter subsided, 'I want you to recognize that this jar represents your life. The golf balls are the important things - your family, your children, your health, your friends and your favourite passions and if everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full. <br /><br />The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house and your car. <br /><br />The sand is everything else, the small stuff. 'If you put the sand into the jar first,' he continued, 'there is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls. The same goes for life. If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff you will never have room for the things that are important to you. <br /><br />'Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness. Play with your children. Take time to get medical checkups. Take your spouse out to dinner. Play another 18. There will always be time to clean the house and fix the disposal. Take care of the golf balls first, the things that really matter. Set your priorities. The rest is just sand.' <br /><br />One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the coffeerepresented. The professor smiled. 'I'm glad you asked. <br /><br />It just goes to show you that no matter how full your life may seem,there's always room for a couple of cups of coffee with a friend.'</span><span class=""postbody""><br /></span>"

Everyone's had a friend that's fooled around with a guy or a girl and after a while they come to you and say, 'you know that girl I messed around with a couple times?

Yeah, well I think I'm ""that girl"" in this situation. Sucks. Let's just say I'll be really rather surprised if I hear from him any time soon. Eh. I guess that's one way to solve a problem. :P"

"event","<p>So brief recap on the last few weeks. My birthday was a disaster. I fell for Jordan and told him so, also a disaster, in fact, any interaction we have, of any kind, inevitably leads to disaster. I've been drinking too much. I've been depressed. I meet Brad and everything is suddenly ok, whether or not anything comes of it. At least I finally got out of the asshole rut. Great. Peaches. Wonderful. Marvelous. And other such words as well. This morning I wake up feeling like I'm about to die. I go to Hall Health and discover that I don't have Strep like I originally thought, oh no, they did me one better. I have fucking <em>Mono</em>. MONO! I have <em>midterms </em>next week. I can't even stand without wavering. How the hell am I going to be able to take my fucking <em>exams!</em>&nbsp;<br /><br />And on top of that I have to call Brad and tell him that while he probably didn't get it from me because it's not really infectious until the fever symptoms appear and I didnt get those until this afternoon, he should still be on the look-out. Good thing he has an&nbsp;horrific physical exam in the next few weeks. Good thing he has to run 5 miles in under 30 minutes, climb a rope, run 12 miles in under an hour and a half in full armor with all his weaponry, etc etc etc. Good thing he decided to sleep with a girl who had FUCKING MONO! Christ, he'll probably hate me now.&nbsp;I didn't even know I had it. I feel horrible. I wish I'd known. I'll be so unhappy if I fucked shit up for him. He doesn't deserve that. Goddamn the world to hell. I am so fucking miserable.<br /><br />Now I just have to sit here and wait for the Vicodin to kick in. I am such a mess.</p>"

"event","So Friday night was pretty awesome, up until the very end when it was utterly horrible, which managed to overcome&nbsp;what awesomeness&nbsp;my night had previously held. Of the five people who were so anxious to take me out on my 21 run, two called to sing me happy birthday and tell me they couldnt make it, two just plain forgot and i haven't heard from them yet, and the fifth who did remember, well, we had a pretty good time until I made some drunken comment about how everyone wants to get laid on their birthday and he drunkenly took it as a hint and thought that I was going to go home with him. When I sent a text message to a friend of mine, who incidentally I'm growing unfortunately attached to, he got upset with me for 'hanging out with him and texting some other guy.' Needless to say it was all very awkward and very uncomfortable and I ended up taking a cab home, drunk, miserable and alone.

It gets better. Last night a guy I'd had a brief ""thing"" with, as I can't really call it anything else, and told me that the thing he appreciated about me the most was that I was exactly who and what I was and that there was never any game with me, and that I was always totally sincere and unapologetically honest about how I felt. This upset me because that very candor is the reason why he broke it off with me in the first place. Dick. ""But it's ok, Ari, you'll just be one of those people who are well-loved in retrospect.""&nbsp;

Today the Seahawks lost to the Steelers 21 to nil. The rest of my week will be abismal.&nbsp;

I've talked to several people about this situation with the friend I've become attached to, and they all seem to agree that I should talk to him about how I feel. I don't think this is a good idea, considering every time we've been together he's had some amount of alcohol in him. Yeah, I guess the prospect of sleeping with me is so horrible he has to be drunk to do it. Or maybe he's&nbsp;so much of pussy that he needs&nbsp;the little liquid courage. Yeah, Ari, wishfull thinking, that's what you need.&nbsp;But I can't complain, nor can I call myself a victim, if only for the fact that I'm a willing participant in my own psychological torture. Way to go, Ari, this is really good for you, keep up the awesome work.

It pisses me off that guys are always so surprised when I open my mouth and say something that ought to be common knowledge.

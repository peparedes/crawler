"event","For those of you that missed it, I am currently in Sacramento, CA learning how to be a card dealer. My first 4 days were spent learning how to deal Texas Holdem which is really big in this state. 

Let me tell you, it is a pain in the ass learning all the rules on how to shuffle, how to deal and how people are allowed to bet.  Took a break from that and will work on Black Jack and see if I can complete that this week and get my certificate, then next week go back to texas holdem.

At least it is warm and sunny down here, 80 most days with the temp falling to 50 at night."

"event","So it is the new year and I thought i should finally post an update.  I no longer work at Verizion Wireless after 10 years I finally had enough.  So now I am unemployed or sort of. I am learning how to be a waiter at my friend Ramiro's restuarant on Capitol Hill. Galerias.

This should either be a lot of fun or really frustrating. Hopefully I have gotten over the major portions of my Anal Retentiveness. 

Also at the end of this month I will move from Renton (I will miss Sterling especially when I'm stuck on a video game) to Capitol Hill. 

I worked my first shift Monday night for a private party with a fixed menu, so was easier than regular tables.  

Funny thing, so far working in a restuarant I think less about about food and eating than at my old job.  Guess I am not as bored."

"event","Had a great time New Year's Eve.  Of course I spent it at the Spot.
Was a very nice evening, good food, good company, good conversation.  
And I rung in the new year by playing with a good friend, what more can you ask than to start the new year on the rack with a good friend behind you. 

Went to lunch with Irene and Raoul, who finally finished their 3 day seclusion on Whidby. They both  seemed content and we had a fun lunch at Charlie's on Capitol hill.


Then later I took Irene to meet some friends downtown so she could do some bondage for a photo shoot and then a late supper at the Bamboo Garden. 

All in all, a very nice way to spend the first day of the year."

"event","Wow 2 weeks since my last posting. How the time flys this time of the year.

It is always interesting to look back to the last year at this time to see how things have changed or stayed the same.

Living conditions, I had just sold my condo and moved into my present room renting situation. For the most part except for one bad roommate it has been a very good change in my life. 

Work. Now that is an intersting subject, i have become very bored with my current position at work, yesterday I applied for a different job with the company, would be nice if I got it, if not I will keep looking around the comapny to make a change.

Social Life   Now here is a big difference. In December I joined the Wet Spot. One of the better decisions in my life I think. I think this more than anything has fueled a lot of the positive things in my life in the last year.
It has certainly been a boost to my self esteem.  I have made a lof of new friends, learned a lot about the the kink scene, learned a lot about myself and what I like and what I want and most importantly what I don't what.

And yes MISS  Your Brutal  it's nice to know I can do something like that in the context it was done.

And what i don't want is to have to narrow a group of friends. I find that I am much more happy interacting on a regular basis with women and not just gay men. 

Love life, well basically the same then and now, no one special to speak of, well maybe there is, but you never know about these things but I do know i enjoy his/her company and time we spend together.  And for all you nosey people no there has not been sex. And you don't have to worry MISS  Your Brutal   <grin> 


All in all not a bad year of progress. Actually looking forward to next year."

"event","Wel for the Adults Halloween is over,  just have to endure a night of beggars asking for candy!

For me it was a fun, relaxing, happy, and pleasntly different weekend. 

Spent most of the weekened :) Thursday night to Sunday night at different events at the Spot.

Thursday night was fun, Karen a Spot friend flew in from Boston for the weekend so it was nice seeing her again was a busy night got another flogging from a straight buddy of mine. Actually he is the only one who has ever flogged me, but even better he goves great after care. 

Friday was a mellow night, some interesting music mixes, and great conversations.

Saturday was a Volunteer night for me, so had to miss some friends Halloween party. 


Sunday night was the costume halloween party at the Spot. I of course followed type casting and went as Santa.
Was a fun time, did one scene with a buddy, and then at the end of the evening gave after care to a friend after his scene. 

Somewhat out of charachter for me, was I actually had some fun getting my picture taken, which normally I  hate to the nth degree. 

Even more unusal was that the reason i got my picture taken was that 2 different female friends wanted to get their picture taken with Santa.  Was fun playing with them for the camera. Nice time. 

One thing about going to the Spot over the last few months, it has made me realized how much I missed spending time in a gendar mixed evironment. 

Women may not be my cup of tea for bed but still fun to hang around with and do some cuddling with!"

"event","Well it finally happened. 

I got flogged for the first time on thursday night. I now understand why people like to get flogged, by the time the scene ended I was pretty well higher than a kite on the endorphins.

It was really great, and the guy that flogged me gives excellent after care, and the fact that he is furry and a musculear teddy bear, just added to the expierence even more. 
 By the time I got home I was really very mellow and ready to crawl into bed and had one of the best night sleeps in a long time.

Had to take a class as i have had several request from cute guys for me to tie them up. 

So figured I had better learn the right way and the safe way! 

Had lots of fun at the workshop and learned a lot!

Now when playing I am usually a Top.

But with rope I may have to switch and switch a lot for that!"

After being at the spot wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday and sunday and then doing a playtest for Microsfort tonight, I am ready to admit I'm tired and need a few nights home with nothing to do.

Pleasure in different forms can be just as exhausting as work, maybe even more so depending on what you are doing. 

LOL and to a certain friend or two, I'm not really brutal I am jusst t a good actor and can get the role i have agreed to play done in a good manner. Even if it REALLY goes against my natural inclinations :)

I love sensation play, hence the Glove. Had to change batteries twice last night, was fun.

I didn't get home till 3:30 and was still UP from the play.  

LOL but looking forward to going tonight, volunteering the early shift, but free the rest of the night to explore. 

<grin> And now off to do the mundane things in life such as grocery shopping!  

But maybe, I will just have to stop and do a little shopping for some pervertables!

Went to a great Luau last night at the Smith Family Luau. Great food and great place to have it. A 30 acre botanical garden, the dacing girls were nice, the dacing boys even better.

Not much happening today, just relaxing enjoying the sun and water, getting some souviners for the friends back home.  Flying out on Sunday via Hawaiian Airlines.  Will be my last flight on that airline, the service is great but the seats are so small my freind Iren even found them tight and she is a slender 5'6"" chinese girl. 

picked up this great candy dish (ashtray) to take to the Wet Spot, has a big wooden cock with a grass shirt around it sicking up from the bowl."

"event","So last nighg I went to the bar by the pool at the hotel I am staying at on Kauai. It happens to be the wednesday hangout of a group of gay men  that live here on the Island, and I had meet two of them at the Lei Bear Day last year. 

Lets just say the meeting confirmed my opinion that I enjoy hanging out with a mixed ( straight, gay, lesbian, bi, trans) kinky crowd than I do with a gay crowd anymore. 

On a brighter note I went on a snorkel adventure today. The catamaran left out of Port Allen on the south east side of the island and traveled westward around the coast to the NaPali coast.  It was an awesome trip.  The crew of cute tanned hawaii guys were friendly and helpful.  the captain kept sterering the ship to intersect with the pods of dolphins heading out to deep waters to feed.   

We anchored in a great snorkeling spot with lots of fish and great scenery.  All in all was much better day than the previous evening."

Now to say these people here are not kinky, would be an understatement.  In Waikiki doing the Lei Bear Day run, leibearday.com   and as usual it was lots of fun.  

Glove story. Saturday we went to a place called secret island on the North shore for a morning at the beach, very nice private area, warm water, sunny, bar bq, nice hammocks, kayaks, and shade for us white seattleites.  Had a great time.  So i pulled out the glove. 

Well first impressions from most people were they looked at me like I was the black hooded guy from the torture dungeon and was about to put them thru the inquistion.


Yeas there were a lot of freaked out people there. Once i started demonstrating on people, it turned around and there were a lot of guys asking where i got it and how do they get one.  

Works really well on pierced nipples.

well the run was lots of fun, I had lots of fun with the glove, and for those perves interested, I had no sex.   

On to Kauai, the garden Island for peace and relaxing."

"event","The TSA has finally gotten it's priorities straight.  I was checking on the latest security measure before I head to Hawaii for Lei Bear Day, or hairy naked guys frolicking in Hawaii day. 


Well you are now not allowed to take any kind of drinks, not even water on the plane in your carry on luggage.

But don't worry for all you wanna be Mile High Club members, the TSA says you are allowed to carry 4 ounces of personal lubricant in your carry on luggage. 

Now that would not be an issue except I need to carry the Glove of Doom on the plane with me as I have a 12 pack of hard cider in my checked luggage so no gloves with wires and batteries in the checked luggage. 

Hmm Lube and glove with wires and batteries. Guess I better put the lube in checked luggage.


Since I am not traveling with my mother, I will be happy to very loudly proclaim it is a sex toy when I  get asked at security. 

Then again, the only reason I wouldn't want to say it in front of my mother would be because she would take it away for her own use."

Even though it would be a fun read, I am not one to glove and tell. So I may just have to come up with the usual rants and raves about the goings on in the world.  

As for what the Glove is. Well basically it is a Massage Glove (read that SEX TOY) It is a water proof fully insertable battery (3 AAA) operated glove that has a vibrator pad in each of the fingers and thumb and comes in Left and Right handed.  Not that expensive as sex toys goes. 

Depending on the person it can be mildly enjoyable, or put you in to sensory overload with endophins for hours. 

Off for now, the hard part is done, the begining!"

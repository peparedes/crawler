"event","The weekend was uneventful. Spent time reading and hanging with the family. They took me out to breakfast Saturday morning to avoid the crowds Sunday morning. Sunday, Father's Day, I went to see X-Men 3. Holy crap that was a good movie. On so many levels. That's one for the collection.

Been reading ""Parzival"" by Wolfram von Eschenbach as part of my Arthurian Romances class. What an amazing book. I totally recommend it for anyone willing to take it on. It's a loooooong poem that reads like prose but the language is still a little slow going initially. So totally worth it, though. I've been focused on the women of the story lately, and how, for anyone on a grail quest, it is absolutely critical to have those women (or at least the strong feminine principle) to guide, support, and inform. The quest is utterly hopeless without it. I'd love to go into detail but that's a paper!

The house is still finding itself. It's been in a state wherein we can live comfortably. Now it's time to begin making it a home. Sage is grown enough and sleeps through the night regularly enough that we're pretty well rested for the days. I have a list of artists and art work that I'd like to decorate the place with; Hans Werner Sahm, Vacher, Michael Green, and Alex Gray to name a few. Google them if you get a chance. Worth it. I think I'll toss in a few shots from Hubble, too.

Work begins in earnest today. Lots of database junk to do. Updating permissions models. SQL scripting is not my strength but that's what I'll be doing this week. Lots of reading to catch up on, too. All good."

"event","My body is back from the Mythic Journeys conference in Atlanta. My heart is lingering in Atlanta, wandering around the hotel I think, which is now full of attendees for a Health Care convention of some kind. It's good to be home with the family again and there's still that vital core of my being disoriented in the transition. It happens monthly with my return from school with a lesser magnitude. MJ this year brought new connections and fine memories. I'm sad for now.

Another aspect of the reentry transition is the whiplash of entering the ""work mind."" Coming from immersion in the ether of myth there is a violence of being ripped from there down into the material world of binary logic, either/or consciousness. The blissful ambiguity of art, poetry, myth, people has little relation to my work world and I resist reentry! I know the demands of work will slowly take hold and I will have to let go of my melancholy at least enough to be able operate semi-productively and keep my job! Such is my life for now! A continuous tension between two opposing worlds and I need the emotional/spiritual dexterity of a ballet dancer to move between them with less anxiety and stress!

The kids are great. We just discovered Sage's first tooth poking through so that's another milestone reached. Irelyn is sharp and has a great sense of humor. Making them laugh is a quick way to improve my mood! So, I'm off to tickle the kids!"

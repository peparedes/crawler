"event","Well, I must say I was very pleasantly surprised today; it was a textbook example of the absolute best-case scenario. 

My best friend, Clare, suggested that her and I sign up for ballroom dancing classes, something I had mentioned before. She said she also had another friend who she described as ""a very smart very cute girl with a heart of gold who was sick of being single"" who was also interested in ballroom dancing. So today I met Clare and Amber at the train, then we went to the Danube for brunch. After that Amber and I (Clare had decided not to go dancing) went to the ballroom dancing class, and it was AWESOME. I don't know if I've ever had so much fun. It turns out Amber and I are actually kind of good at dancing, and we both had a blast. In fact, it was so good, she asked me if I had plans for the rest of the day. Neither of us did, so we decided to follow brunch and dancing with dinner and a movie. we went to Ricky's, had some awesome pizza, and an hour and a half later went to the theatre. We saw the first 15 minutes of night at the museum, which seemed to be awesome, before the fire alarm rang and the theatre was evacuated. We still had a good time and went and talked at the Starbucks for a while. we left and had a very good time waiting for the bus. It's weird because she actually lives really close to me, and even takes the same bus! 

Amber is an amazing person, she is everything that Clare said she was. Best of all, she really likes me. I think today marks the beginning of something truly amazing. Today exceeded the wildest expectations of both Amber and myself."

"event","Well, let's update. 

Long time no update. yeah. back in October I started workign part time at Games Workshop. The job rules. I like my staff discount, although the shrinking number of unused flat surfaces in my house as well as my bank card don't. It is true that redshirts get paid in miniatures. so far while I've bought 3 armies in as many months. I need to paint all of them by next month. oh this will be fun. what else... oh yeah New Years Resolutions!

Normally I don't make New Years Resolutions, things such as cut back my popcorn intake, or eat out less never last past a week. but this year, I've set myself a goal, admittedly one that I'd go for anyways, but I've got a goal nonetheless. My new years resolution is to get a girlfriend. I know I cn do it, and I know that decent, intelligent girls are out there lookign for decent intelligent guys, like me! so, my goal is to get myself in a relationship sometime before the end of 2007.

What else... I've discovered a couple new bands, Mr Bungle, some really nice and very trippy music, and Finntrollz, apparently they're one of the 'holy trinity of Scnadinavian folk metal' whatever that means. anyways, they're Finnish, and they think they're trolls. I think that makes them one of the coolest bands ever, jsut for that. and their music is, well, tolerable. 

Another semester has started at University, and my schedule is now finalized. I am studying: Womens' studies, American history after 1877, politics of the global south, and communications studies. All of my courses seem pretty interesting, adn hopefully won't kill me with work.

Unfortunately with all that going on I've not met any new people, which is kind of dissapointing. Oh well, hopefully I'll change that!"

I have to say, I like the models. It's also funny because I now own toys as old as I am!"

She's a nice girl with a good heart and strong morals. She's smart, going into medicine. She's also beautiful. She's got all the curves I like, and she's got gorgeous black hair that hangs down to the top of her thighs. And best of all, I think she likes me. We'll be meeting again on Wednesday. I think I just fell in love again. 

Side note: I stopped by Mr. Big & Tall on my way home. I didn't get anything, it was a social call. Apparently everyone there misses me, and likes me better than the guy they hired to replace me. Despite the way I left, they still like me there. It's a good feeling to know that they still think highly of me. Today has truly been a wonderful day. and it's only 3:30!"

"event","I've just realised something very important about myself. I like fat chicks. I'm not talking about the obese, ""I weigh as much as my car"" fat chicks, but the ""I'm too large for normal stores"" fat chicks. Why? I have no idea. Why do I like different music than msot people, why do I like the color blue? Why is irrelevant. No, wait, there is one relevant why. Why haven't I figured it out before now? I think I know. the reason is that there are not any clothes for larger ladies that don't look repulsive. The rules for dressing larger people are completely different than for normal people. the clothing has to hug in different places, size ratios are different, and <strike>some</strike> most cuts and patternsthat look amazing don't otherwise work. The problem is that the girls I like can't find clothes.<br /><br />I've taken it up as my personal mission to fix that. I will teach myself to make clothing, and create clothes for larger people. Skinny people need not apply, you already have access to good stuff. <br /><br />Now, I need to find someone to teach me how to make clothing."

"event","Something's been bothering me for the past few weeks. Nothing specific, but I just haven't felt right. I think I've figured out what my problem is. My problem is that I have no drive, no reason to try at life. I mean I'm not suicidal or anything like that so don't be alarmed. I went through that phase and am not going back there. I mean I'm just listless, purposeless, I go on existing but my life has no meaning or goal to it. What I need now is a reason. If I were an artist I'd say I needed a Muse. I need someone, something, some goal to work towards. I need sometihng to become so overarchingly important to me that it matters more than anything else. What that something is does not matter, I just need to have some goal, some point ro my life. The moral of the story: I now know that what I need is a reason to live, now all I need to do is to go out and find that reason. Whatever it may be."

"event","Anybody who knows me will know that my opinions of humanity are quite low. An event today left me scratching my head. I spent the day at Games workshop, and overall it was a very good (and productive!) day. I finished painting 5 more guardsmen, and I did the red coats for 5 more. I also played two games, where I defeated Rob's (store manager) Tau army and another guy's (Who's name I can't remember for the life of me!) marines. All in all a very good day. The thing the left me shaking my head happened during my first game. A group of people, I think two men and a woman, in their 20s, walked past the store, and one of the men felt the need to ahout something rude at the store. Steve (staffer who was in on his day off) became rather cross with this, and a 5 minute shouting match ensued outside the store, leaving everyone but me in a very foul mood. I later found out the guy had shouted ""You're all virgins!"" Now I understand the statement, and I know it likely describes tehmajority of us. It does me, but what I don't understand is why the guy felt the need to shout it out. I mean, If I walk past someone who seems like a drooling imbecile (and believe me that happens a lot), I don't feel the need to proclaim that I belive he (or she) is a high school dropout. I mean, what's in it for him? a reputation as an asshole? a few more people who wish him ill? Why, for hte love of God, why do people feel the need to do this? I mean this isn't a rare thing, I, being in the store on average once a week throughout the year, see it happen roughly every month. That means it happens roughly every 4 days. Which is really really sad. I mean, it's just senseless. I fully understand the enjoyment of a good insult, there's good fun to eb ha when someone can go on for 5 minutes about someone else's mental defficiencies using polysyllabic words, but random swearing and bad insults? why? where's the amusement? any idiot can swear and make simple insults, wo why does such a large minority decide to be vocal and rude? If anybody can give me a good answer either from personal experience having done it or from personal experience knowing a person who did similar things, I'll be very grateful."

"event","I went to Conflict Calgary today. That was some good fun. participated in a mega battle style event. I switched sides a couple times. More importantly however, I bought myself an armageddon pattern basilisk from the conflict store. That's a $122 model. I bring it home and I find out it's missing a piece. wonderful. Of course the reason I bought it at the conflict store is because that's the only way to buy it in Canada without mail ordering it from the UK. So, because the part's missing, I dont' have the luxury of dealing with someone in Canada, but rather I get to deal with people in England. I'm seriously worried about them being unwilling to ship the piece to me. If they don't... they'll have some nasty long distance calls."

my thoughts for the past to days have been, and for the next two weeks will be ""oh crap oh crap oh crap oh crap!"" Why? Mostly because of the ridiculous ammount of work I have to do for school. I had a take home essay test that occupied today. I've also got to write a prospectus for Thursday for a term paper due on the 22nd (a week from Thursday)In addition, I have to read a book, and finish the second half of the book I'm reading before my east Asian studies final. Oh, and I need to fit in studying somewhere in there. All this would be fine except for hellish ammounts of hours at work. Why? because two of our four full timers at work are missing due to injuries. I'm afraid that I might have to tell my manager to go fuck himself and walk out of the store, and then find another job later. I really don't want to do that, but I don't think I'll have much choice in the matter. Please guys, any support you can give please do!"

"event","Jsut got back from the swimming pool. Vic dragged me there. Our conversation went something like this:

Vic ""I'm going to go swimming, want to come?""
Me  ""Do you need to ask?""
Vic ""What?""
Me  ""Do you really think I'd pass up the oppertunity to see you in a bathing suit?""
Vic ""That's exactly what I was about to remind you of.""
Me  ""So, when are we going?""

And a good time was had by all. Swimming wsa really, realy fun. We definitely have to make this a regular thing. 

It's funny, before today, I hadn't been in a swimming poool for at least 5 years. I mean, I know what I look like, and figured I'd disgust people walking around with my shirt off. Then I got to the pooll, and I wan't the worst guy there. That and seeing Vic in a bikini severely reduces the ammount of attention I pay to anything other than Vic. all day I was so worried and so nervous. On the way back from the pool I told vic this and she said I was fine. That's such a confidence boost. I still want to improve my body, but I no longer have to be ashamed of it.

Russia almost defeated Germany, and Japan's mainland forces. after that we played Twilight Imperium (which Adam brought over). It's like the Master Of Orion games, but a board game, not a computer game. it's rather fun, once you get the hang of it. I lsot that game to. After that there was a bit of fun on the xbox before everybody left. With the exception of yesterday, I've worked every day since Christmas and I'm a bit mopey because of it. I also havn't seen Vic since last Thursday, and that's adding to my mopeyness. 

I'm planning to do something with Vic tomorrow because we both have new years off. What we're going to do I don't know. because Vic's not been responding to MSN for a few hours. She's probably playing World of Warcraft, which apparently is more addictive than crack cocaine. Damn you Blizzard entertainment for taking her away from me! anyways, I'm feeling sad and lonely at the moment, even though I don't have much reason to."

working at Mr. Big & Tall again, it's all right. finals SUCK. working and going to classes might suck too. 

Thursday I went to Vic's after supper and we exchangeed our Christmas gifts. I brought over a bottle of sparkling apple juice Gord gave me when I went back to Mr Big & Tall. it was enjoyed. I gave Vic the bomberman cartridge I'd been hoarding for a while. I also gave her a Hack/Sign DVD in case Bomberman went the way of earthworm jim and didn't work. fortunately it did work. I got Sid Meier's Pirates. it's an awesome game, esoecially if you love pirates as much as I do. earlier that day I'd gototen my present from my WARSEER secret santa. it's a King Kong toy, if you squeeze it it roars. I also got a rather funny christmas CD. 

now on to this morning's inventory

Leather jacket. awesome
Axis & Allies. excellent, now, I just need to find some new people to play the game with.
chapters gift card. cool
phone card. needed
toothpaste and 2 toothbrushes. not quite sure what, or even if my mom was thinking when she threw those in the stocking. 
and a rolling stones CD from Aub. 

apparently Vic didn't get much good stuff. that sucks. she liked my gift though, so I'm happy about that. now I've gotta be at my aunt's house in an hour and a half. seeya!"

"event","well, I thouhgt I was betteer Saturday morning, but oh how wrong I was. I missed school monday on account of being in absolutely horrible condition. with any luck I got a passing grade on my cpsc program, or barring that at least a couple pity marks. I've been sick since, and have only shown signs of my affliciotn lifting today. I was so worried when I suddenly got sick again monday. not for my own concern, but for Victoria. Why? because my beign sick on monday could have meant that I was sick all through the weekend, and hadn't in fact recovered on Saturday. that meant there was a possibility I might have spread my flu/cold/nasty phlegmy infection to Vic. That would not be good, especially considering Vic never catches colds. she catches plagues. fortunately, vic apparently is in good health and I have nothing to fear. I proabbly won't see her this weekend because I've got loads of work to do for computer science.

Yesterday I get to History to find out I've got a paper due tomorrow. crappit. then my prof announces a 1 week extension and I think ""You're my hero!"" so now I've got next thursdya planned. last night I got two books. 1984, and Vampire Hunter D. I finished Vampire Hunter D earlier tonight, and it's hands down the best book I've ever read. It's got the thorough descriptions that draw people to authors like Dickens, and others of his time, but manages to keep up a fast pace and plenty of exciting, quasi-supernatural action. It rocks. haven't started 1984, bu I guess that'll wait 'till tomorrow night. 

Earlier today I went to a meeting of local Green Party supporters, I volunteered to hand out panphlets and go door knocking sunday, and to phone various community orgnaisations to ask if our local candidate could participate in local debates. so there's my weekends. well, if any of you feel inclined to listen I'll tell you why you should vote green in the election! and if any of you don't plan on voting go and vote green, for me. why? because I'm a brilliant young man, and my opinion should count for more than usual. besides, if you claim to have no opinion, then allow me to give you one. as a bonus it'll even be an informed one! what a deal! 

reading through Vic's friends page when I fonud this in Dette's entry. I thought it would be interesting, and, considering I'm always willing to give a sincere answer to a sincere quesiton, decided to post it here.

and that's what Dette had in her journal. ask away!

Finally, I'v ehad quite possibly the nerdiest moment of my life so far today. I figured out that the techniques used in my current cpsc program could be used to write an army builder program. That said, I decided to write sich a program, so I'd have a program to use for Fantasy armies. I quickly realised that I should work in the simpler, more important homework program, and promptly lost interest in the whole thing."

today was Vic's surprise party. I'd been planning it for some time, but obviously no mention of it in here. after all, Vic might read it!.

Vic got a DS, and a blockbuster gift pack. it was good. apparently she doesn't like coolers. oh well, doen't meen I can't have one occasionally. Just means I won't be able to share it. oh the sacrifices I'll make... we played Circus Maximus, some crazy charoipt racing game that Ash brought, watched a crazy FF7 anime, again that Ash brought, played Crimson Skies, watched H2G2, had pizza, then Ash went home, then the four of us left played Chez Geek. it was loads of fun.

"event","Today was fun. I went to Sentry Box with Adam and Billy. Adam and I each got a small army of Warmachine minis. Adam went for Cygnar, the cazy technology nation. their element is electricity I think. I went for the protectorate of Menoth, basicly the medieval church on crack, with a much bigger, self propelled stick. their element is fire. BURN THE HERETICS!

anyways, the minis look good, but are a ROYAL PAIN to put together. the Warcaster (mage-General who allows yoru warjacks to act) model I chose is VERY big and complicated, so I think I'll go out and buy another, smaller, simpler one tomorrow. assuming Great White has warmachine stuff. 


I played Adam with the stuff we got today, and I beat him. I was losing the battle, then I noticed I had an attack with power 20. I used that, and instantly killed his warcaster. It went something along the lines of ""Menoth doesn't like you."" <enemy warcaster explodes> ""Eww. that was a bit messy."" the troops look awesome, and the battle told me that I need ranged anti-warjack guns to effectively defeat adam's army. a lot of his warjacks do damace to enemy warjacks cortex every time they're hit on melee. no cortex means that my warcaster can't improve the warjack, which means that warjack is not doing a whole lot.

now off to look around and see which warcaster I should get."

"event","Well, today I spent a couple hours with Victoria looking at shiny stuff in the mall, so I know what she wants for her bday. over the course of the evening, I got a number of gutterminds that she found amusing. she suggested I post them here, so here they are.

first one:
Vic: ""I hate cold benches. now I can't feel my butt.""
Me: ""I could probably feel it for ya.""

next one: 
Vic was standing looking at some stuff, I walked up behind her (she didn't notice me) she bent down to look at something as I announced my presence. I was standing right behind her. she says ""woah, I could have hurt you there.""(because when you bend over to look at something your butt sticks out) I replied ""no, I think I'd be hit with something kinda soft."" I promptly shoved my hand into my pocket because I realised proving said part was soft would not be a good idea. 

Third:
walking into the mall we noticed a christmas stocking at spencers that was literlly large enough to fit a person into. later on, at fairweathers, I noticed a rather skimpy red nightie. I think of someone wearing that, and in a stocking. 
Me: ""Merrry Christmas indeed!""
Vic: ""eh?""
I then explained the thought to Vic, and she laughed."

"event","Okay, so there have been significant developments sinc emy last post. I've decided to switch fculties. next term I'm temporarily going into social sciences, then next fall I'm going into International relations. for this term, I dropepd chem, which frees up a lot of time, and was in all likelyhood a good move. next semester, I'm takign 4 courses, all of which are social science courses. that means an easy semester, with none of this three hours of labs per course per week bullshit. hell, if the homework isn't that bad, I may even have time for a job 3 days a week. went to a Haloween dance with Vic, it was awesome. her catgirl costume was AWESOME! all I can say is that she's got a really really nice body, and the costume helped show it. The world could do with more catgirl costumes. it was good. I don't remember when, but I know sometiem between my last post (not the one a few minutes ago, the one on teh day of my chem midterm) and today Vic and I cuddled. not for long, but for long enough that I was happy. 

She's got a lot of homework, and when it keeps us apart, I get sad. I should be able to understand that although I may be more important the homework is more urgent, and I do. It's just that that stupid little piece of selfishnesss inside says I'm more important. I know that's wrong, or at least lack teh utter conviciotn it's true. true she may be the most important thingin my life, but that doesn't mean I'm the most important thing in hers. 

Another thing I've really noticed is how lonely I feel at night. when I go to bed, it doens't feel right anymore. I don't want to be living at home, dependant upon my parents for absolutely everything. I want to be independant, no, not independant, codependant. I want to stop sleeping alone in my parents house. I want to move out, get my own place, and somehow convince Vic to move in. more than anything that's what I want. I dont' care if she's got lots of homework, I dont' care if it delays my career, I don't care if I have to start tracking my spending and actually take responsibility. I don't want to sleep alone. it doesn't feel right. It's not that I need sex. What I want is to be able to come home and put my arm around her when I go to sleep, to kiss her goodnight every night, and to wake up to her smile. I know that one day that will all come to pass, and I will be happy. but until then, I must wait. Until then, I must wait and hope. Hope that I bring that day closer rather than later. 

Vic, If you read this, talk to me about it. I need you to know how I feel."

My main reason for posting is that I just saw Lord of War with Adam. Lord of war is a good movie. it's got style, good character development, and a very good plotline. the only thing that's bad is that where most movies will leave you with a feelign something alog the lines of ""wow, that was awesome."" or ""my faith in teh world is restored."" this movie leaves yo ufeeling like shit. no, I'll not leave any spoilers, but the ending is one you should see coming starting about half way through, but really you don't see coming until the last few minutes. The characters are very real. Too much so, for my tastes. Personally, I don't mind my heroes having flaws, theyr'e necessary. But when the star attraction of a movie is a character totally devoid of morals, decency, or even any measurable concern for those close to him, the character is too real. walking out of the theatre, I was left with a feeling of guilt and surliness. I don't even know why I felt guilt, only that I did. all in all, dont' see the movie unless you want to punish yourself. and if you want to punish yourself, seek psychological help, or confess whatever you did to the appropriate authorities. But dont' see this movie, it'll just leave you feeling bad."

"event","I know it's been a while, but I've had important things to do. the past few months (excepting this past Saaturday) have been exceptionally shitty. a few times I've missed seeing victoria for a weekend because she's too busy with homework. I can't stand it when that happens. spending time with her is so important to me... when I miss seeing her I end up feeling lonely all week. last week and the week before was spent doing homework, I got all my term assignments and big labs assigned to be done in teh same week, over the same weekend. Oh, my grandpa died a couple weeks ago, so on teh weekend I had two labs and a term paper to write, I missed friday night and Saturday to go out of town for a funeral. I didn't see Vic that weekend. Apart from actually not seeing her, it's been a while since we'v just sat together and cuddled. I know it may nto sound like much, but jsut sitting there with her leanign against me is well, ti's the best feelign I know, and I miss it. very much. I hope it's jsut a symptom of us being rather busy, not somethig I'd rather not contemplate. I've had a rather bad case of insomnia lately, and I can't seem to get to sleep before midnight or 1 am. not good when I'm getting up at 6 the next day. Oh, I've got midterms this week and next week, in fact, I've got my chemistry midterm in about an hour and a half. I hate 3 out of my 5 courses in school, and I think I'll be switching faculties. right now I'm in a bit of a grumpy mood because I got up at 5 am to get here by 7:30 to hand in a chemistry lab that (thank god) got extended to this morning. I'm going to be here until 9:30 in the evening for the fucking midterm. I really hate chemistry. Despite the past couple of months sucking, Saturday was awesome. Saturday was our one year, and I took Victoria out for dinner to celebrate. I got her a ring, it's got a stylised chinese dragon head on it, and a nice chunk of amethyst mounted next to it. she liked it. dinner was also nice. apart from dinner, i helped her make her haloween costume, a rather scantily clad catgirl costume, consisting of a furry bikini top and a furry pair of short shorts, with attatched tail. there were also full length fur gloves to be made and boot covering things. needless to say, I want to see her in the finished result. and out of it too... although we're both decent enough to know that'll not happen for a while so don't you go getting any ideas. and in adition, Games Workshop calle dme on Saturday, and I've got an interview set up for Thursday. if that goes well... sweetness. hmm I'm really in a funk today. normally describing a weekend with Vic will cheer me up, but I'm still feeling just as dour as when I started this blog. If I get teh job at GW, I'll see about going full time after christmas and dropping my uni courses down to one course at a time, to work full time and move out. it's times like this when I understand one of the big reasons for couples to move in with each other before marriage - you actually get to see each other every day, even if it's a simple goodnight after getting home late. I really wish I could see Victoria sometime soon, but I'm not going to see her until next weekend. and that makes me sad. If she has a lot of homework next weekend, I think my family may see me cry."

"event","Vic's been doing homework all weekend, in fact, she's doig homework right now. that means I've not seen her this weekend, and probably won't see her tonight, because it's 7:30 and we both need to sleep tonight. I've spent the day playing Winter Assault and watching TV, trying in vain to avoid moping over the lack of Victoria. I know I did just see her friday morning, but I still feel alone without seeing her this weekend. Yet more evidence she is the one. I can't stand to be without her."

important events this week

I turned 18 on Wednesday yay. my parents took me and Victoria to Kam Han, a semi-nice chinese resteraunt. I was originally thinking of going to Bill's Peking house (very nice place) bu vic said Kam Han was very good, so we went there. turned out that IMHO the resteraunt was not as nice as she thought, but apparently she has a lot of good memories there.  anyways, the food was good (best Wonton soup EVER). and the evening was nice. Vic wore her red dress for me, I was happy. when she wears the right clothes, she looks like a godess. anyways, after dinner we went to drop her off, but it turned out she forgot her key, and her sister wasn't home. so, we went back to my house, and in the end my mom ran up to thr hospital where her mom was working and got a housekey. meanwhile, I had a nice chat with Vic, although I probably wasn't at my best for conversation. that dress shows off her body very nicely. don't get me wrong, it's decent, but man, she's got one helluva body. and... I could go on for a LONG time about that, but I won't. my parents got me Winter assault and the H2G2 movie. WA is awesome, and H2G2 is not as funny the second time around, but still reasonably good. 

Adam took meand Billy out drinking tonight, I had a rum&coke, which was actually pretty nice. then Adam ordered a three wise men. I wish he didn't. it tasted like urine, mixed with battery acid and bitter grapefruit rinds, topped off with a little somehting that ignites when it contacts the back of your throaght. why people ever consume more than one of these in their lifetime is beyond me. then we ordered a platter of poutine, which was totally amazing. then I had a smirnoff twisted. it was quite good. I think next time I'm there, I'll go for a smirnoff twisted, and some poutine.

Victoria says she's got a lot of homework this weekend, so is seeing each other this weekend is an if. that's a bit upseting, but what can ya do?"

"event","Let's see what happened. 

Thursday I stayed home, went to see a doctor thta night. after two hours, I found out it was caused by the way I sit, something about crossing my legs the way I do twisting the joint beyond it's normal position, blah blah. so now when I sit I'm supposed to have my legs straight out in front of me. trut me it's tricky to change the way you sit. 

Friday I went to the morning of UofC 101, it was totally useless. I also didn't find my classes, as I don't have a hard copy of my schedule, and there was no way I was going to walk to the library to use a computer in THAT weather. I came home, played DoW, and then met Vic at the station and walked her home. she wsa pretty tired fromgetting up early, so that's all that I saw of her. I found out later that she went to sleep right after I left, and woke up at 7:30. friday night was spent playig more DoW and posting on Warseer. 

Today I spent the day on my computer, after sleeping for a marvelous 13 hours last night. unfortunately, that means I will not sleep any decent ammont tonight. it's 1:40 am and I'm not going to be sleepign any time soon."

"event","I have been trying to keep my spirits up by granting holiday wishes here on LJ, <lj user=""holiday_wishes""> So many people ask to be exposed to new music on their lists. It has been easy and fun to refer them to <a href=""www.gaiaconsort.com"">Gaia Consort</a>. Hopefully, in my own little way, I can help them fulfill <lj user=""gaiaconsort"">'s wishes as well!"

"event","It was only about 36 hours without electricity, but it was enlightening.&nbsp; I spent most of the time hunkered down on the couch with the pets, reading by candlelight. No internet, no phone, I read four books waiting for the power to come back on. About 4pm yesterday, the power was back on across the driveway. Except for a few blocks, my house and the rest of Lake City remained in the dark until mid morning today.
Although my house is surrounded by tall trees, we were lucky.&nbsp;I didn't have anything but lots of evergreen needles all over the yard. Not even any branches were down.&nbsp; At the corner, a tree crashed through a fence and blocked the road.&nbsp; Two blocks away a tree landed on a truck.&nbsp; Candles, books, pets&nbsp;and pantry snacks, I was pretty snug and feeling grateful."

"event","I had one of those low energy days. You know the kind where getting up off the couch takes momentual effort and concentration? I gave into my body's need to rest and snuggled up with the laptop. I spent a very enjoyable evening granting holiday wishes.&nbsp; I sent pictures, made icons, created a Christmas card list, compiled recipes and sent e-mails. It was extremely satisfying to do a bunch of little things to brighten up people's day. <br />Check out the <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/holiday_wishes/"">Live Journal Holiday Wish List</a> for yourself."

"event","For the last week, I have been struggling to do art. It would be easy to blame it on my muse, that is, if I HAD a muse.  Sometimes I can just sit down and perservence will reward me. Alas, that is not the case these days. I have been going through old works and placing some of it on deviant art, in hopes that it would inspire or motivate me, http://da-beanz.deviantart.com/. I have spent hours perusing others' works, seeking inspiration.  Doesn't that seem what we always do? Seek inspiration from without instead of within?"

breastlog.com/org/info is now mine.  Now don't go off running looking for it.  I am just holding them for a rainy day.  I still have a lot of decisions to make but since boobblog.com was already taken, I wanted to stake a claim.  
I feel strongly that it needs to be an independent blog, outside of the hosted blog influence and watchful eye.  I need to really research the software and hosting options that won't be squickish about BREASTS!"

"event","Two concepts have been coming up over and over again in the Business Blog Summit.  The first is to blog about your obsessions, the second is to develop your own unique and authoritative voice.  That felt intimidating to me, what did I have an authoritative voice about?

Yesterday, <a href =""http://chris.pirillo.com/""> Chris Pirillo </a>started his session by flashing his <a href = ""http://www.rentmychest.com""> www.rentmychest.com site </a>. Funny and provocative it stayed in my mind.  I mean magic markers? Body art? How could I not be obsessed?  Chris' site listed the option of female chest but when I approached him he was reluctant to persue it at this point of his business.  His partner, Jake Ludington and Chris, fanned some of my thoughts about a boob blog.

Because you know what you will get from me, I am also the one that people turn to when they are scared or feeling betrayed, confused or abandoned by another.  Griefing not being ""fun"" while trying to appreciate the safety that people seek from me.  Then I scratch my head and say what in the heck am I doing selling vegetables for a living?

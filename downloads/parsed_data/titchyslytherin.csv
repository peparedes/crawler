"event","Aww, isn't that just too bad.

If you're really all that interested, read and follow the rules, and I might give you the privilege. Ahem...
<lj-cut text=""DOOM!DOOM!DOOM!: The Rules"">
x Check my interests. Do we share at least 5? If so, move on to the next rule.
If not, scram! Why would I want to friend someone I have nothing in common with?

x Add me to your friends list. If you cannot or will not do this, get LOST.

x Leave me a comment. If you don't comment, I assume you added me by mistake,
and I will not add you back.

x If I do not add you back within 5 days, please remove me from your list,
because I never will.


<b>Once added...</b>

x Comment. At least once or twice. It won't kill you. If you don't, be prepared to be unfriended.

x I accept constructive criticism, but when you start getting rude, you've stepped over the line. Be prepared, for I will unleash the fury of... something or other. And you'll be unfriended. :|~

x Use LJ cut, or I will take you off my friends list. I'll give you a few chances, but after the fifth outrageously huge quiz result, you're getting voted off the island, Bucko.


<b>Be forewarned...</b>

x <b>I LOVE <u>Harry Potter</u>,</b> hence the username, background, friends only picture, sorting quiz results on userinfo, etc. I will talk about <u>Harry Potter</u>, and I may on occasion be a disgusting fangirl.

x I also adore <u>Artemis Fowl</u>. I'll talk about Artemis Fowl as well,
though I'm not as fangirlish.

x I take quizzes and surveys on a pretty regular basis. I use LJ cut, so as to not feck up anyone's friends pages, but the quizzes will nevertheless be ever-present in my journal.

x I don't comment on every single entry my friends write, but I do comment fairly regularly. If you want a comment for every ""I didn't do anything today"" and ""Here are a bajillion quizzes!"", don't friend me. I don't play that game.
</lj-cut>

Still interested? Drop me a comment, and I'll see what I can do.

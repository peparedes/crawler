"event","Saturday morning. It's football day! Hoorah! And I have the prospect of knowing I have work tonight, maybe for the last time...? (Again)

So as you probably all know, I shant be returning to Southampton... to study, anyway.

I heard that Jo is getting a job down there and it appealed to me straight away. I wouldn't be stuck in shit Aylesbury, where I couldn't go out because noone else is here, and it save A LOT of hassle on the house situation.

I've got bar experience now, so could work in a restaurant or something, or of course there's Brantano... ahem. Anyway, I'm popping down to Southampton TOMORROW (sunday) to have a look round, and I shall of course pop into my house. I think I'm gonna chuck some stuff in there.

Not sure how long I'll be there for. I can get a free lift home with my dad, or spend money and get the National Express. I think the free lift thing is easier...! I'll apply to a few places, maybe get some interviews or something and then come down in a week or so, hopefully with a full-time(ish) job! In the mean time, I'll try and work as much as possible in Aylesbury to get the money I need!

One problem is, I've already told people I'm not gonna be down there.. ah well. it'll be a nice shock to them..!!"

"event","So Neal was moaning (not really moaning.. just stating) that I hadn't posted on here for a while. It's a fair statement. I have no excuses other than to blame all the kebab vans around Aylesbury. I shall tell you more...

I've been working a bit lately. All the money I seem to be earning is vanishing everywhere. I've not bought any new tops. I've not bought loads of food... actually, that's a lie, I had 2 Subways the other day... bugger me, they're still lush! Oh God I'm hungry... Anyway. Yes, so, I've got no money. I've cleared my overdraft and stashed some dollar away, which is quite mature of me, but also I seem to be spending loads of money on going out. The last 4 Mondays, my friends and I (ooh laa la, fancy grammar) have got totally boshed and on average I've spent 25 Quid each time. Quite a bit on drinks, though yesterday I had 6 cans of Carlsberg whilst playing Tekken and Pro before I went out. Classic. Got a burger before I went in to Cago's, and the standard Chips and Cheese afterwards. Also pulled some munter but don't wanna think about that. Yeeesh.

Can I also send my sincere apologies to Kev (who won't read this anyway), Tanner and Neal for the texts I may have sent them last night. Shit, I just lost the game again. Fool. I paid the price.. mm, rice.. this morning with a sodding nice hangover. VK's every time...

I say this every time... but I love work at the minute. If I could have any job if I wasn't going to uni, that would be it. Sunday nights are never busy, but they brought me in anyway, which was fine, I wasn't doing anything anyway. Was probably just gonna eat.. and then eat. But I came in, and they said the big party cancelled. Thanks for telling me. But I stayed and worked anyway because I needed the drinking tokens, which some of you normal people call 'money.' It wasn't busy at all and I was farking hungry after a while. These 2 really nice (genuinely nice, not fit) girls were working and they cooked me a mahusive cheeseburger with loads of salad (reminded me of a Kiyu, but obviously not as nice) and I poured myself a Carling top. Bloody awesome it was. Plonked myself in front of the telly and saw them off. Who needs Tano's? Oh, Bullard does so he can stroke kiddies feet....and maybe Tanner, too.. he likes feet.

This reaaaaally nice girl (genuinely fit this time) has just left work to go to uni, but before she went, SHE asked ME for my MSN and phone number. Score! I'll keep a tab on her..!

So tonight is the Carling/Tetley/Worthington/Sprite/Tina Cup. Bees vs Luton. What a game. It's gonna be penalties all the way, but if we go through, we're facing the big boys. Bring you on over-paid knobbers!

That's all for now. I'm too hungover for this. Bring on Brainteaser and a sandwich.

Bon voyage tout le monde."

"event","Where do I start? Yes, uni. Right so, basically, I don't have a clue what I'm doing next year. I don't wanna carry on with French. There's no denying it, it's shite. I hated it. Carrying it on would be like Tanner going without banter for a year. It's just not healthy. So, I wanna do Spanish Single Honours with Italian. Sounds nice to me. However, it would mean starting all over again, meaning last year 'was a wasted year' as he said. I didn't agree it was wasted. Academically, yes. In every other way, no. 

I just hated French so much, I couldn't possibly carry on with it next year. 3 langauges is tougher than I thought. Oh, the confusion. I don't think I can just change courses half way through my course. I thought I could? but apparently not. See.. so confusing.

Moving on...

Work has been much fun lately! I worked my first day shift yesterday, as usually i'm up in the bar and noone drinks in there 'til about 7. Gays. So I was helping at the control desk. These 2 typical-Aylesbury-girls walked in. And I mean... woah. Proper full-on chavs with bling. They were filth and msut've been no older than 16. Yes, one of them had a kid. So they bowled. They paid for 1 game each but when I looked up at the scoreboard, they've put each of their names down 3 times. Thus trying to have 3 games each. They think I'm stupid? Then when they finished the game, they bowled again. I turned off the lights and their screen and yes, they bowled again. We had to actually remove them for their lane. They finally left and one of them came back to me and said, 'My mate (the one with the kid) wants to know if you've got a boyfriend.' I said, 'yes' (as you do when a DOG tries to get your number) and she went, 'ok, well it's just she's got one but doesn't like him.'
 First things first. Who's the dad? I bet she doesn't know and is going around Aylesbury trying to pick up guys as 'possible dads.' They left again and again the same girl came back and said, 'She was only joking apparently anyway' - I was like 'fine...' Then she came back later AGAIN and said, 'but she thinks you're quite fit.' At this point, i couldn't help but laugh and said, 'Does she know who the father is...?' She walked off in a huff but hey, it got fucking rid of them! The manager came up and said, 'they didn't look happy, what happened?' I explained the story and she loved it. 

Got home last night and played fusbol for 2 hours with my mates. Ruddy good laugh it was, too. I had to stop after 4 minutes as I had a heart attack, but soon recovered...and went in goal. Not really, I was good, it hasn't gone anywhere boys. Be warned... ;)

Then we thought, 'lets have a quicky in the pub' (A quick drink, Tina, don't get excited over there.' We went there and it turns out there's a quiz! Yippee! So we entered and were surprisingly good! Rounds were shit, and we averaged 6.5 per round! A bunch of students vs groups of proper adults. A good effort. Came 4th out of 8 I think. Respectable. I showed my geniusness by answering 'What's the maximum score a contestant can get on 15to1' BANG! Straight in there, 433, thank you very much. They doubted me, but alas, victory.

On the relationship side of things, things have been ok recently! Improvements have been made. That is all. ;)

And finally, a video for you all. Remembering the good times...

"event","I was merrily going about my business a couple of nights ago and thought, 'I know, i'll play some Football Manager as I'm 2017 and doing well as Sheff Wed in the Premiership. I've been England and won the World Cup but that bored me...'

So I go to load it, when I hear a 'blop' and a bubble appears on the bottom right hand of my screen.

'Corrupt file'

None of my games will load, and I can't start a new game. I broke down in tears. I now have to play FM'05 as my old Spurs game, which actually, I'm doing quite well as! But it's not the same.. after 11 seasons, to finally break like that is awful. Yes Tanner, you're further and probably doing better, but don't try me, i'll eat you.

Anyway. I've got a funky new haircut. It's thin at the sides and long on top and spiked as per usual, all over. I'm looking forward to Monday night with the lasses celebrating their exam results :D:D

Brentford are going well. Though todays result was a disappointment (we scored in the 89th to go 2-1 up, but H'field scored with the last kick of the game) I feel optimistic for the future. Our strikers can score. Look and learn Arsenal.

That's all for now. I've just got back from work and am suitably shattered. Au revoir mes amis."

Anyway, a mini-rant about Aylesbury.

1. It's shit
2. It sucks
3. It's shit

Why oh why do I insist on going out on Monday nights when it's so horrendous!! We'd start the drinking at 7. Plenty of time to get ready and go out, so that it's cheaper when we're out. Me and Tanner always did this, it's key.

So we get to town, and have to queue for about an hour because at least 3 gays are late or aren't ready. Therefore, when we're finally in, we're all sober again. So we get in, the ladies are ugly (although the year 13's are shaping up nicely.) Age is just a number.

The drinking starts and it's 1.40 for a Fosters - not bad! That's until they run out/barrel's broken/the cooler's bust.. so we have to go on the girly drinks. Now, I don't have a problem with this, but when it's 2.20 for a VK, you have to re-consider.

My mates who took a gap year know loads of people that us uni-gays don't know. So I'm talking to the uni-gays, and there's 1 person... Darren. Pisses me off like Tanner reading about Ashton. (Chin up...) The man gives it all this about how he can stomach his drink better than us lot, but he doesn't drink! We buy him pints and he doesn't have much, shots he refuses... and then if we're drunk/tipsy, he'll mock us and call us all lightweights. None of us have the guts to smack him, but one day lads... one day.

And there's only 4 places to go in Aylesbury! Now, i'm not saying don't come to Aylesbury, but it's the main point of Bucks. Shoddy.

I'm loving working though. I'm gonna ask to do 6 days a week. The people there are quality. (2 fit lasses, most are my age, and the older folk are jolly nice, too.) The customers are awesome as well and when there's no work in the bar, I can sit downstairs, drink coke, eat food and watch TV. Last night I watched the whole England game upstairs, with a burger and a cheeky pint. Noone knew a thing! Bring on work on Saturday nights when MOTD's on!

Rant over - I need a holiday.
PS. Tina you boob... I like your texts calling me fat, don't stop them and don't worry if I don't text back...!"

"event","So it's now Friday. The best day of the week and I stll haven't done that work I should have... Nay mind, I still have 2 weeks to do it. Stupid Italian.

So an update on my last entry. I realise Louise may have read it/read it soon and may hate me for it... but alas, things are better now. I sent a classic Manning text last night saying how I'm not bitter etc and that hopefully we could get back what we had before. (Gotta thank Stig, too..)

We were such great mates, I could tell her anything and really open up. She's one of my best mates and I've only known her about 4 months. There's loads of little things that we have, that only we would understand. Usually involving one of us saying something stupid, or something in a weird voice, too... To lose a best mate like that would be like me not eating for a 15 minutes. Unbearable.

Later on, I'm hitting the core of Aylesbury, having a curry and going bowling :D - Time to polish that ball of mine...

No doubt, I'll bump into my psycho ex again.. we seem to have done that a few times lately. Pints have been spilled...! Hope you're all well."

Monday 11.17am - Adam is eating in the kitchen. 

Fark it, too much hassle.

Tuesday starts and I get a call from my mate 'Fancy some pro' - Who turns down Pro?

I get home at about 5pm and see I've got a text. 10 minutes later, I'm a single man.

At the moment, 18 hours later, I'm mixed between confused, pissed off ( can't work out why) and a tad upset, though I had seen it coming to be honest...Don't know why.

It was all going alright, I thought! Went to see her in London. The chances of her coming to Aylesbury were always slim (unlike me). I didn't want her to die or anything.

But each day, there'd be a text/msn/phone call. Never argued and hardly ever disagreed about anything. After a pacey start, we kept it lighter for a while. Things were even getting better according to her. Then bang, the break-up call.

Don't know whether she wanted to be mates all along and rushed into the original decision...or any other reason. I know there's noone else. She just thought it was better in the long-run if we stay mates. 
I was under the impression that the summer was gonna be tricky, but we'd get through, and that we could start properly at uni in October. Apparently not.

Me thinks I'm gonna have a nice few days with the lads, as usual, drinking beer, playing pro, then going into town and getting lashed. Let's hope me and Lou stay mates... something tells me there's gonna be a whole lot of awkwardness somewhere down the line."

"event","In the immortal words of 'the lej' Harry Enfield....'Only me!' (And my 30st of pure butter fat) - God bless this banter. In every LIveJournal from Tina/Tanner, there be mocking about my fatness.

I love Tanner's mocking of Northerners, too. Sorry Kev, but you are a bunch of inbred weirdo's...

Went out last night for my mates' birthday. It summed up Aylesbury. First we went to Yates' where I was the only one not to get ID'd. (Must've been to scared to ask me in case I ate them) I had 1 pint and played pool. We were 5 balls down 'til a magical Manning clear-up got us the win. *Queue victory dance*

Then we went to Littentree (that place u lot had the Magners outside) - it's baaaaad in there. (not chav baaaad, just bad.)

Music was horrednous but bottles were 1.75 so couldn't complain. We planned to get my mate really drunk, but as always, we ended up more drunk than him.

We put 4 shots in his beer thinking it was a good idea. You could smell the Malibu and Goldschlager from 5 metres away.

I think the best bit of the night was the football games on the Arcades. We sucked at those, but Trivial Pursuit we rocked! Got the Jackpot up to a Fiver and couldn't get into the middle to pick it up, so lost it. Dumbasses.

Today I am going to C&G to get some money, and then working tonight.. yay!

I'm sorry to say there'll be no Tanner-banter as he's on holiday as of now... but we can all mock him I'm sure?

Maybe Bullard? Ahh.. Meg, of course.

Anyway, an update of my life since my Blog was written about 18 years ago. (Not a true story)

For the last 2 weeks since the update, I've done absolute sweet F.A... nearly.

Working at Jardines has been superb. Great fun, people, and money...chin up Brantano.

Saw Lou just over a week ago in Londonium. Interesting it was, too. Sooo different to Bedgrove (not Aylesbury) - made me feel like a right countryboy.

I have read Neal's, Stig's, Tanner's and Tina's 'soi-disant' ('so-called') entries.

They did make me chuckle. I think I lost count of the number of times the words, 'Manning' 'fat' and 'food' appeared in the same sentence. And bizarely, on Tanner's... 'pigeon' - Thanks for that mate.

So more money is coming out of my comment minute by minute. Farking charities by West Quay. Can't they employ less attractive women to talk to you? They suck you in, I tells ya. Disgrace.

1st August is mayday. It's obviously not.. it's Mayhem day. Paying for the house and my Dad's birthday means less drunken activities and less take-aways....(paid for by me.)

No doubt it'll be a while til I update this again as I don't actually do anything with my life. Dinner tonight is Quiche avec ensalada. Yumyums...follwed by KFC, McD's, Deep Pan and Chinese. Not a small chinese man..a big one.

Anyway, time to eat. Thank you Neal for making me do this. Was a pleasure.

"event","And the first year of uni is over. What a rollercoaster year.
 
Since my last entry in January, I can't really remember what I've done. Something about... spending too much money, drinking beer,beer festivals, something about exams..something about women... and of course, Pro Evo.
 
I've played a surprising amount of football since the turn of the year and especially since April. 5-a-side indoor football every Suday for an hour or two was knackering enough, but then some people thought it would be a really good idea to play every day for the last 2 weeks or so. Cheers Stig and Kev. Nice one!
 
Also, me and the lads entered some football competitions at Wide Lane near the Airport. We got to the 2nd round of one and were robbed. The lack of actual referee's got us in the end. Got through the group stage despite only scoring 2 goals (ahem.. yes, I scored one, thanks) and played some team called, 'We're gonna cheat to win'... I'm not bitter.
 
We were tugged, pulled, kicked and the 'referee' was horrendous. He gave us nothing the whole game and then gave the other team a penalty for me stepping in the area...I couldn't stop my momentum and didn't  touch the ball, yet he still gave the peno. - bender. Cheers to Stig and Tanner for managing us too in their suits. Good effort.
 
Also since January, I've met a whole lot of new people. At the start of the year, it was the C Blockers and A blockers. Now it's all them, plus J-Blockers and W-Blockers.
 
Rob aka. Jimmy Bullard - What can I say? The man is a legend. Some of the funniest moments I've had at uni are down to him. Top man. Never met such a pisshead!
 
Martin aka. Tina - Mr.Pro Evolution. I blame you if I failed this year...and for my fat increase! So much pro, beer and take aways. Absolutely loved every moment I spent with ya. Nicknamed me Chubby/Tubs or whatever aafter a recent BMI test showed I'm fatter .. remarkable.
 
Stuart aka. Stig - Again, top man. (Especially recently) thanks for letting me on the Surge Show so much, too. Loving the sarcasm of the man and the puns. Top work all round, cheers man.
 
Mark aka. Luton - Mr.Chav no.2 - Didn't really know him that well.. but hey ho. Still a top bloke.
 
The C Blockers - Spent a lot of time with Tanner and Tom still and unfortunately didn't spend as much time with the others, but still, always had a laugh when we saw each other. Tanner and Tom.. the 'never be Pro Champion' players ;)
 
Lucy, Meg and.... oh, yeah Louise - Not sure what to say.
 
Lucy - Only met (and James) recently when I lived round Tina's. Top lass.. and a great chef, too!
Meg - Nutcase. Scared of absolutely everything and pretends to be a nurse....
Louise - Well... what to say. Made my last month so awesome. More about you later...
 
Neal aka.... Neal - Good bloke. Shame I didn't meet you earlier in the year.. always up for a drink and a laugh!
 
Kev aka. northerner - the man whore of Southampton. Possibly always the happiest man in glen (apart from when playing football ;)) - Pleasure knowing ya mate. I'm preparing for many more laughs next year.
 
Anyone else.. sorry if I've missed you out but you've all made my uni life so good so err...thanks!
 
Right... it's that time again. No, not a beer or takeaway... talking about girls..
 
There's been a few ups and downs recently. I think everyone knows about Rachel. Shame that didn't work out to be honest. but since then, there's been a lot more ups than downs. Spending time with Tina often meant spending time with the girls.
 
For the last 2 weeks I've been 'seeing' Louise. Possibly the most liked girl in Glen! (sorry, Lou ;))
Had some great nights recently. shame I've come home now.. just wish I could be spending more time with you. But hey, summer's here and I've never been to South london (i know.. disgraceful) and if you're brave enough, you can come to Aylesbury. We share some things that noone else would understand (ahem.. weird) and I think that's why what's happened has happened... so thanks.. I don't know how many people can talk about Sheep Olympics the way we do...
 
Jobs - Brantano. The less said the better. Quitting is the best thing I've ever done. What a shambles.
Now this summer, gonna be working at Jardines Bowling Alley in the bar me thinks. Gonna be awesome.
 
I think that's it... I can't really remember. The beer has killed my brain cells and I can't think...
 
Hope you've read this with enjoyment and pleasure and haven't fallen asleep. I know there's a lot to read. If you have read it, I congratulate you!
 
I hope you all have an amazing summer. Hopefully catch up with some of you as much as possible. 
 
Take it easy peeps.. Love y'all

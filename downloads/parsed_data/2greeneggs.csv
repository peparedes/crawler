"event","Went around campus today and helped a friend fix their dorm.

i bought a usb port from one of their bookstores and the price nearly killed me. if gas wasn't already insane, i would go out to a walmart or something to buy one. too bad that driving would cost more than the flasher. gas sucks and i have a bit of a ""holiday"" so no loop hole gas prices for me. 

on the other hand, i did buy an awsome cd from some unknown underground store i found. they have the weirdest stuff there"

You try not to let<br>emotions get in the way of making a sound<br>decision, and are usually quite successful.

"event","Today was really great.
I got out of bed just before breakfast because the smell of cooking bacon woke me up.

I feel a bit strange because we've just moved to Idaho and there's a weird smell in the house.

I'm so hardcore. Me and Buzz went to the mall today, and I stole a whole heap of stuff. I got a Good Charlotte CD, a couple of DVDs and some new boots. Buzz got caught, but he fought his way out, and then we stole some lady's car and smashed it into a phone booth.

Last night I had to shave my entire body. Apparently, the lice that I caught from Amanda's friend are really hard to get rid of. I look quite strange with no hair and eyebrows. I'd post pictures, but my webcam is broken.

I am sharpening my knives before I go to work today, because I'm going to cut out Robert's heart and feed it to him for losing my mail. 

Today, I got a digital camera! Yes! Here's ten thousand photographs of my cat.

I want to say thanks to the world for absolutely fucking nothing! You all suck. I feel so alone, no one ever reads this journal, or even comments to let me know that I'm not suffering alone. It's cold here, and I want to die, but I cannot figure out how many of you to take with me when I go.

I went to the doctor yesterday, and he said I have bipolar disorder, and a healthy imagination.

You should all do this quiz! It's amazingly accurate. You just put in your name and birthday, and it will tell you next week's lottery numbers.

That's enough for now. But I'll leave you with this thought - sharing your life with strangers on the internet is the cheapest form of therapy available. Leave a comment and tell me I'm beautiful.

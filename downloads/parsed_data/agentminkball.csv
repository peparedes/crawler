"event","So Monday at 3:40 pm I was sitting in the oral surgeon's chair clutching a magazine with Johnny Depp on the cover being directed about my eating habbits for the next week. Then the doctor comes in and recl;ines the chair, my mom takes away the beloved magazine, and the doc takes my right arm. He does the whole process for the shot and hooks me up to an IV. I was kinda freaked by this, but i did ok. Then he says ""Ok, so now we are gonna give ya a little bit o this stuff here..."" and starts flicking at the pouch connected to the IV. All of a sudden, I feel kinda sleepy and start blinking alot. ""How long does it take for this to affect?"" I ask the now humming doctor. ""Oh, about 15 seconds at this point."" ""oh.......zzzzzzzzz"" and I am out cold. It was cool. So I lost all perception of time and the next thing I know is I can hear the nurse saying ""wow that only took half an hour!"" and they start waking me. I ask if they are finished and then giggle histerically because I sound like I have a mouth full of marbles. I still couldn't feel anything in my face. They instructed me on how to stand and they escorted me out of the room. ""wow, that was soooo fun....haha"" I giggled. The nurse asked me if I remembered her name. ""Scarlet... hehehehehe....."" said I. I was correct. And so I finally made it down to the car, which was parked, I remembered. I then confessed to my mother that I was a fish, and we went on our merry little way to the pharmacy to get my meds. Then I tried to drink water and since I couldn't feel anything in my mouth, I ended up drooling water everywhere. At that point I told my mother that I was quite high and needed to wait untill my mouth was back. hahahaha yeah. So I got home and sorta lounged a bit, changing my gauze now and then. Jennifer came by for a breif visit, I took some pennecillin, ate some mashed PO-TA-TOES and iced my cheeks. Then my mother came down to my room and we both went to sleep. 

At about midnight, I woke up. I was supposed to take the painkillers at 12:30, but I was hurting so my mom and I went out to the kitchen. I insisted on getting up. My mouth hurt so badly. As I walked into the kitchen, I suddenly sank down thinking I was going to pass out. I was burning up. I closed my eyes for a bit and mom observed me. When I opened them again, I realized I couldn't see anything. I wa sstill fully concious. I started panicing, and my mm called my uncle (who is our pharmacist) to find out if it could be the meds. After a while, I realized that I should clo9se my eyes because I had been staring up at where the light should have been. My mom said that my eyes were dialated and my uncle decided that I had probably gone into shock. Pretty soon my eyesight started returning, but it wasn't untill a full three minutes had passed untill I could really start to see again. I then began to shiver like mad. I managed to down some ice cream and a sprite to get my blood suger back up, I took my meds, and I went back to bed. That was purhaps the scariest moment of my life. I thought that I had gone blind, and in my brain drugged state i thought that the doctors had accidentally damaged my optic nerves. 

At 3 am I got up and had some more food and meds and finally slept in untill around nine am. I have been doing much better today, although I am still feeling the pain in my jaw. Jen came over and we watched Secret Window and Dirty Dancing Havana Nights. Then my aunt Tina, Uncle Gene, and Aunt Lynn came over. Aunt Tina and Gene are going to adopt this adorable five year old girl and she came with them and so i played with her for a bit, and now I am freezing and going to go read. Please, pretty please, someone call me or come over tomorrow!!!!!! 972-9143!

Bye all."

Yep. Yeah. Well. Hmm. My Bio class is really stupid. I mean, seriously. I have a 103.5% in that class. I wish i could get those grades without having to be surrounded by morons. 

Aaaand I think I am feeling depressed again. It sorta started yesterday and today it really started to manifest. It's really too bad I only seem to write in this when I am either on the brink of insanity or depressed beyond normality. I had a good time shopping today though. I got a pair of sunglasses and a purse. And I think I am going back to old navy to get some zebra striped shoes. Yeah they are so way totally cooler than cool. But then I got home and things started getting weird. And yesterday I almost didn't want to go to Jaime's party. Don't ask why, it was so bizzare. I think it was cause I feel sick. I don't think I am, but the air quality is so bad right now. I am really congested and I was feeling depressed. I had such a good time though. We played pool and went bowling. And then we chatted for hours. Just what I love to do!! i have decided that pool is like the most awesome game ever. 

I feel nauseous. I dont want to go to bio tomorrow. I haven't even talked to jen for about four days. I feel like shitcakes. Whatever a shitcake is. it just sounded like a good word at the time. Sorta sounds like grumble cake. I want a grumble cake. 

Why 

nevermind. 

How can someone totally and completely convince themselves that they are happy and organized when their mind is most definately not?

And what the flip is wrong with myself? It's like something has snapped and slowly leaked out of my whole system. Like a glow stick when you put a hole in the tube. Now all the glowing chemical is gone. It's sitting in a messy puddle at my feet. And all that is left is a plastic, artificial shell that tastes bad. But is that glowing stuff artificial too? If so then is my metaphor completely accurate? i will leave that up to you to decide your own thoughts on.

I am gonna go somewhere else now. Wherever I am, I am going to sit mindlessly. Maybe I will write in my notebook. Maybe I will write a poem. Maybe I will read, or clean, or sing, or listen, or maybe I will meditate. And now I go."

"event","sometimes i really hate my life. i know that sounds aweful- in actuality i am really quite lucky- but nothing seems to turn out right. everything i do is wrong. everything i try fails miserably. i have no special talents except humiliating myself. even when i think i know what i'm doing, like painting my dresser, it somehow turns incredibly wrong. then when i seek counseling from my mother, she gets angry instead of sympathetic. she tells me that i need to expect mistakes, it's only natural, but she says it almost spitefully. i think i am having a hideous mood swing right now. all of a sudden, i feel like i am on fire, like i just want to smash something. i want to hurl the phone at the window, topple the armoir, throw the computer to the floor. i can't contian it any longer. i feel like i am going to explode. and soon things will start to yell at me. i know if i don't keep myself distracted they will come back. i know because it happens. i start to yell back at them. maybe i'm going crazy. i have heard that if the thought crosses your mind though, that you can't be. but some people can tell that something is wrong with them though. they know that their sanity is escaping. that is what it feels like right now. i have to vent it somehow. this is how i am vewnting. typing, punching the keys in. watching them dive and plummet. it will be a good riddance. i can hear too much. the bird outside is trying to calm me. the computer's penetrating hum. the saw in back. my own breathing. my back cracking. the cloth moving. a ringing is persistantly echoing in my head. i am calming down. all i want to do is be alone right now, but i know that if i am i will start to hear things. 

i sound completely insane now. the other day i was in my room when i heard something- it is so hard to explain, but i tried in my poem, static. when you hear noise, and that is all it is, but then sometimes i can sense a meaning in it. i guess it is like a trance. when i came out of the trance i could realized i was getting impatient and yelling at my fan. i knew i had been, and it seemed almost staged, but i felt i had to tell it to go away. 

please don't think i'm crazy. i think i am just working overload in my head. maybe i do need to spend time with someone. but all i want to do is be alone for a while. i guess this is my form of being with someone. i can write in here as much as i want. 

ok i think i have made a bit of a recovery now. i need to go sand the dresser. i hope that mad episode doesn't return. you know come to think of it, that wasn't new... this past week i have been going through random spells where i overreact to things. i usually can come out of it ok though. wow i must monitor myself more. oh, and i havn't been sleeping well, either.

"event","So. I hope that everyone had a good Independence day! Mine was ok. The house I went to often goes really overboard on fireworks. After about the first seven went off, I was thinking to myself ""Money! You're burning all the money!"" What I really enjoyed was afterward we went up to the levy and watched Cal Expo's performance. It was spectacular. And Some of the fireworks made smily faces and Cat faces! That was nifty. It would have been twice as fun all around if I had a friend with me though. There was no one my age at the party, and so I spent alot of time talking to the adults. Which is ok cuz they were all talking about when they were in high school together. I love hearing those stories.

Anyway, I got home and worked on my project for a bit and then read a book of ""scary"" stories. Jen and I had a little project we were working on, but we didn't find too many good ones. I went to bed and OH before I begin the dream: I saw some teachers yesterday at Jen Smith's party. Her dad had invited them over. I saw Mrs. Miller and it was a huge shock. Instead of wearing one of her formal skirt-top dress things, she was wearing a rather fashionable pink top, black capris, and black sandals. She also had a pair of sunglasses, if memory serves. I did a double take. We talked for a bit and then Jen and I scrammed out. She seemed pretty happy to see me, which reassures me that I havn't scared her by my freakish director overload (yet). 



On to the dream (disclaimer: I wrote it mostly for myself to read, do not read it if you get bored by other people's dreams) Last night I had a dream that it was the first day of school, but Mrs. Jacoby (from Arden) was our new principal. She made an announcement that the new dresscode rule was no stripes or checkers. Of course, we were all outraged at such a nonsensical rule. Glancing down at my shirt I realized that I had stripes on it and vowed that I would wear it anyway. mrs. J also said that we were supposed to all take more showers in the lockerooms at lunch. I wondered if maybe the showers had been fixed then. So anyway, I was going to all my classes quite happily, untill Mrs. J herself stopped me for dresscode. When I asked what was wrong with it, she sent me to the office. There, no one would even explain what the problem was, and soon I was taken back out. Mrs. J was rough handling me and saying some stuff about my 'punishment'. Finally, so outraged, I started screaming at her. I cried loudly and yelled that it was unfair, and that the school administration had gone to hell and stuff like that. I also yelled that I would rather be expelled than be a student at her school. And she said that she might be able to arrange that. I was soon put under a type of house arrest which would ban me from going to school. (It was like a suspension, only it tied in with county laws) I managed to get to Drama before I left though. The LT was way different, but I found my drama friends. I waved to Mrs. Miller, and then started walking accross the floor and spotted another Mrs. Miller, this one wearing stylish clothes. I sortof stammered a bit, and then said ""you're twins?"" and she said naturally. I found out that Mrs. Miller was really proud of me and had been telling her sister about me :). When the class was over, I went back outside with [a friend and we were talking in the hall.] Pretty soon Mrs. J found me again and took us both to the office. I got an even tighter sentence, and my friend was sortof beaten a bit by the jacoby Henchmen.  The next part must have been later in the year. My English class was going on a feild trip to somewhere and I decided to follow them at a distance. At one point I accidentally knocked over some vendor's display, and was hurrying to pick it up when a friendly teacher found me. She warned me that if I was found I would be arrested completely and sent to jail. I then began my life as a fugitive."

"event","I was in a rather good mood today. I babysat for two hours and got a ton accomplished. I only charge five dollars an hour, but she has me over alot. So I keep on scorin pretty good cash. Although it wouldn't hurt for her to tip a little more... I seriously work my ass off at that job. But all is good: I like them alot. It beats workin for five dollars an hour painting or tiling. Honestly. i am still battling with my parents for a raise. If I work over ten hours in a month I go up to ten an hour, but I am already planning my financial future, and they arn't helping at all. 
 So after I got home from babysitting, I sorta helped a little preparing for lunch. My Aunt Lennie and Uncle Don came over (great aunt/uncle) and we showed off our nifty little house. That was a good meal, and we had cheesecake for dessert. After they left, I played around and then set to work on a project. No details here! hehe But lets just say that my friends are all turning 16 rapidly. Finally, I called Sam and we met up at around seven to go to the mall. we only spent about an hour there, but Express is having a gigantic sale so we got matching shirts for 10$!!!!!!! hot dig man! And they are soooo comfy!! So yeah. We got McD's (I havn't had that is a loong time) and they dropped me back off. It was good to see Sam though. Now I REALLY need to see some more of my friends. I havn't seen Jaime AT ALL!!! AAAH! I swear it is painful but stuff keeps popping up like major. I just have managed to weasel in some time here and there. Plus I have spent a ton of time with Jen Smith cus we are neighbors and pretty much sisters. Yeah. Oh and my bro and I chill too.

garble garble blab blab I talk too much. I wanna throw a party in the garage here sometime soon. Like a big party. Does anyone know how much DJs cost?? I don't like to spend a ton of money on stuff... hehe. Would you (the guests) pay like 5-10 dollars to go to help cover costs?? Then I could get snacks and music and everything. if someone can burn a dance track for me that would be nice too. skip a dj and just play cds. I want to try to recreate those european discos (well, minus the drinks and 'fags'(fags is a Brittish term for ciggarettes, not gays) Yeah. i love to dance! SPeaking of that, I think I will go dance mad tonight. hehe I sometimes put on my fav dance tracks or saturday night 107.9 dance just to chill. someone should come over sometime and keep me company. I feel stupid dancing all alone. aaaand i am writing this all why?? now i will have no friends and never EVER have anyone to dance with cuz they will think i'm a freak.... lol i hope not . ok bye

"event","Yes. I was in a poetic mood last night. It actually came on rather suddenly. I did some editing of the entrees, and then at midnight I went to bed. I am really tired today, even though I got like, nine hours of sleep. It's funny how that happens: you are tired when you dont get sleep and still tired when you do. I guess it's all about the classes, eh?

So. The room looks like it was hit by a storm. First, my old room got torn down (well, the partitions that is), and of course, that means that all my stuff got blown on down to my new room. Since I have nowhere but a closet and the floor to put stuff right now, my room is a complete and utter mess. I finally finished painting the bed and got that moved in, and next I guess is to paint my dresser white, paint the armoir black, paint the nightstands black, and finish the bathroom. Oh yeah, and I don't have a desk yet. My second closet is going to have a desk in it. Hopefully we will just buy a black one to start with. I hate painting. 

On tuesday my grandfather took our whole family to the Esquire Grill downtown and then to see The Producers. It was a birthday present for my Grandmother, and a party to celebrate the finished (almost) house. That was so fun. We decided to dress up a little bit, so I wore my black halter dress that I wore to homecoming frosh year and a pretty wrap of my mother's. I had a great time getting ready. I felt so pretty, witty, and gay once I finished my hair and makeup. LALALALALA-LA-LA-LA-LALA! (i borrowed some song lyrics haha) Yes. And so it was really windy downtown and it was fun because I like the wind. My mom said that the guys were checking me out, and I just laughed at the time, but yeah: I was lookin pretty hot. Too bad there was no one my age around :S ! anyway, the show was awesome! I was laughing the whole time, but I had a hard time hearing the actors. The sets were beautifully done. The whole thing overall had me wishing I would get more into acting. It's Springtime, for Hitler, and Germany! (oh I guess I'm in the mood to sing!)

Ok. So I'm gonna go now, yes?

"event","do you ever feel like you are slipping? 
falling- like a house of cards. 
it's almost like a dance: 
i'm dipping, 
slipping deeper go the cutting shards.
trapped within my own design,
hoping to wake up in time,
the music blasting ever louder-
ringing, humming, as you flounder.

the noise is more intense- finding-
calling so havok struck and damaged,
almost like the nightmare beat:
you're binding,
finding worlds too gray and ravaged.
Trying to escape you cry,
pleading just that you won't die,
The grin of hate is too demeaning-
suddenly you wake up screaming.

do you ever feel like you are slipping?
tripping into other hopes?
it's almost like a ship at sea:
you're tilting,
unable to clasp the end of rope.
then the current takes you in
a battle that you'll never win
the blackened skies are streaked with lightning
why do you even bother fighting?

Love love love. I just don't know. It kinda bites. Hard. Today let's just say that things went my way, slowly died, got really good, and the were pushed off the roof of Gotham tower.

 I'm bored. Moving on....
 I can't wait till summer. What's new? 
 Last night after I wrote this I never even got to watch the Sopranos. I watched SNL (my dad records them).It was pretty good- the one where Lindsay Loghan (however yuo spell her name) hosts. I think my favorite act was when she introduced herself and then they had actors portray Hilary Duff and Avril Lavign and Whitney Houston. The characters were funny. Wow, second major spelling mistake of the day. I just tried to spell were as where and earlier I wrote or as ore. Maybe I was tring to write whore (I was studying for chem).
 It juist occured to me that half of what I say doesn't even make sense. Has anyone else noticed that too or is it just cuz I spend too much time with myself?
 I am so confused. I don't know if I should really write about it online though. I don't really want anyone to read about it. But I guess that is what an online journal is for, isn't it? (Sorry, still not used to this) (I guess I shouldn't apologise to 'myself' then, should I?) (Yes I think I'm right.) Huh. Brackets. [stuff][words][this looks fun]
 Yep. So I suppose I should get back to memorizing lines for Sam H now. She might not show up tommorrow, in which case I have to take her part. (I am making an angry face) I donm't want to study this weekend!!!
 Last thing, today we did our play in English... HAHAHA oh wow we improved that like major. It was hella funny though. Last comment: There's two shoes in a box. Hahaha more inside jokes.
 O yeah and my cat Missy caught a hummingbird today. She was very proud of it and meowed at me. It was so cute I could have swooned!

"event","Well. I am here.... Writing about my thoughts... online. This will take getting used to but whatever. So how it started for me: Tomas (my wonderful friend) has a journal online and I said to myself 'cool'. That's how it started. And now I am trying to get used to typing instead of writing. 
 Today went pretty well. But one word: Drama. When I hear it it makes my neck tighten like someone just poked it with a magnet. I am close to a mental breakdown because we perform Friday. And it looks like serious... well I won't go there. Tomas and Sam P are helping me through it all. Ari is great cause she never ever misses a cue. Sim too. But I honestly am worried about Sam H, who hasn't been here at all. She has only been to like, 2.5 practices. And the song... It is from Grease... It needs psychiatric help. On top of the actual class, We are performing Ari's murder mystery tomorrow. trouble is, we havn't exactly gotten to rehearse yet. So that will require some grand improv. 
 In addition to the stress of... Drama... I am spazzing over finals. Particularly Chemistry. I love Mr. Montbriand, but I sure as hell have trouble with chemistry. Math too. I am not that sort of person. Maybe that means I will never be a good forensic scientist. I guess I can always try my hand at screenplay... or something. I like ellipses.... Ya and then I think about being a detective. But I don't know a ton about that. I suppose I could always try to start my makeup line, but again I don't know enough about that. Well, I guess I will be a hoe then. (lol inside joke HAHA not with myself with the swim team cuz we are all hoes). Anyway....(ellipses....)
 Now, another subject: Love. It doesn't happen to most people in high school. Which sucks because dating is stressful (like I date? yeah right) I have so much trouble expressing my feelings. I am a little slow and kinda weird, so most guys seem to find me a turn off. I feel so alone. I wish that guys would just take some initiative with me. If you want to ask me out, just do it! I am sick of wondering with some guys. And I am socially and romantically scarred. I feel like I live in a cardboard box, and I am leaping up to try to get out of the top, like a puppy, but I just keep falling down. I hate trying to pick up cardboard boxes when they have heavy stuff in em. The paper feels all nasty. And it often smells funny. Like sweet and stale. Sorta like old white bread. So anyway. If I ever manage to sort out my emotions, I will be the luckiest teenager in the world. I don't want to write any names, lest they read this and laugh, so all I will say is that drama rocks (ironic what with the above statements, eh?), and The Matrix. Haha. Only I get what that last one meant. Oh and there is also this guy that I see every day but I don't know his name. he kindof makes me think of Neo, to keep with the Matrix theme, but I don't know his name. Everytime I see him, he is usually walking somewhere. I always want to just walk up to him and say ""Neo!"" and hug him, but I don't even know a thing about him. i will drill Jaime later. I gotta go watch Sopranos, so I will write again another time. Gotta use the computer to play the DVD. Bye"

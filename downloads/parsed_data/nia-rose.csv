Drama Queen
Oscar Worthy
What a performance!
Just keep smiling
Just keep breathing
Don't scream, Don't cry
Don't let it out, Don't suffocate
On a life that is so distant from that which I wanted
That which I dreamed
Everything is hanging like a carrot
So close and yet so far away
My dreams mock me while they drift further out of view
My light, my light, what happened to my light?
What happened to this feeling of optimism?
I tried so hard to convince it was all going to be alright
Run 
Home
Run
Into a room with 4 walls and safety
Comfort
Familiarity
Look through boxes and imagine I'm 16 again
Create a new light
Create a new dream
Try not to let the scars stop me from believing again
In love
In life
In me...."

Want you to make me believe that I'm the only girl you're dreaming of
Want so hard to believe that this is going places
Instead of round in circles, smack bang into a brick wall
Want you to make me feel like I'm that person worth dying for
Want you to make me believe that I'm the one you adore
Adore me, Love me, Never ever leave me
Hold me, Kiss me, Never ever cause me pain
So why can't you recognise i'm sinking?
Why have you stuck you're head in the ground once more?
I'm drowning in the reality I tried to run away from
I ran so hard, I ran so fast, I found my smile
And now? It's gone, and is it worth it?
Is this feeling worth it?
So many questions, answers not so forthcoming
So I ask you the questions and mute you remain
Rely on me, let me in, don't push me away I hear you cry
Why? You don't have the answers, you don't have the cure
You have no forthcoming solutions to these problems
A problem shared, is a problem halved...
No it's not, it's doubled."

But sometimes hestitate when faced with such aggression
So snappy, so blatant, so arrogant in nature
Not everyone is as clever as you
Not everyone wants to start an argument or fight
The venom, the spite, the anger you possess
Is terrifying, alarming and ever so concerning
I stand only to make the pain go away
To make you feel at ease to feel emotion 
To feel content just being you, you don't have to try
What are you trying to prove? 
Why do you always feel the need to make judgement?
Never listen patiently and tolerantly
Not everyone wants to hurt you, why the high alert?
Just kill time, just smile and laugh and converse
Don't fight, and snap and stand to attention
It's just a conversation, it's not a threat or attack
Please just let it go, this anger, this frustration, 
This general air of contempt suffocating you 
Please... just breathe :)"

Why are you suddenly so insecure
I am loving you so purely and sincerly
Why are you working against me in this?
Why are you moving to cut me off?
I love you wholeheartedly, beautifully innocent
I said I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you
I spoke the truth
Why let these past demons destroy what we have?
Why is she always gonna be the reason why there's an edge?
The more you pull at me, and try to control me
The more the independence tugs,
The more I start to feel my fears emerge
Please, my darling, have some faith
Understand that I have given my all to you
But that does not give you the right
It never will
To dictate my moves, my roads and my decisions
My friends, my allies, my battles and my life
Do not underestimate my desire for independence
My tunnel vision for my hopes and dreams... and you
You are my one, true, everything
I have ever wanted or desired
Please have a little faith and understand
I sometimes need my space, my own counsel and laughter
But that does not make you any less a part of it
I am with you, every hour, every minute, every second
Of every day
Hopelessly loving you for all I am worth
I will never faulter if you keep believing
My darling, My lover, My one and only
.... I wish you were here right now."

Fuck your meritocracy
Fuck your lines of 'it'll all work out in the end'

Too qualified, Not enough life experience, Too much passion, Not likely to conform....

So what am I supposed to do now? Stand in the dole line like some leeching zombie?
Tell me now what do you expect me to do? Get back up battered and bruised?
I'm bleeding, it's pathetic, I'm fine, I'm fine.... I'm not and I know it
Even you know it
Damn it I wish you didn't know me this well
You know me so well that I know it's going to hurt
I could scream down this place, I could tear some people apart, 
I would cry... except I have no more tears left, my eyes are empty, 
I remember the days when I actually believed I could change the world
When my eyes would burn at the thought of achieving my goals and dreams
Now they lie in tatters, half the woman I wanted to be, soon you'll realise that and leave
I can't keep doing this to myself, how much further is life gonna push me?
Isn't it my time for some decent weather, some decent shot?
Where they aren't playing favourites or making me jump through hoops?
I'm smacking my head against a brick wall, I'm suffocating on my own anger
Give me something, anything to break as much as my heart has done already
Give me some piece of hope that I can be the woman you fell in love with
The woman I wanted to be, the woman I thought I was capable of becoming, 

How much more of this am I expected to take?"

That I could prove them wrong in my continued devotion and dedication
I am not just a pretty piece of skirt, I am a force to be reckoned with
I have stood in the line of fire, ever faithful to a cause and community
I followed you into danger, a naive shadow that never faultered to defend you
I took the abuse, bruises both inside and out, never questionning their worth
I loved the blue lights, the blue drama so unrequitedly and innocently
I never took a second to question their motives, I just felt the knives

The best form of response
The only form of response you know
Sitting in your back seat
Crying in your back seat
10 years, 10 years of our lives
And silence is how you repay me
Swallow your pride
Get down off that pedalstool
Find you cannot
And it hurts me more than you'll ever know
And it pains me more than you'll ever care
To know, To know
I'll never hear the words ""I love you""
To know there will never be a sincere word 
Formed in that mouth and heart of yours
Your walls remain solid, no bridge or hole for me
No space in your closed space for a friend
A friend that adores you
So true and so beautifully
10 years, 10 years of my life
And still no gratitude
Hypocritical words you sing out
""Be strong and learn to say the words I love you""
Find you cannot
And never will."

Whip and Spin out nasty tones
Nasty clauses so full of pain
Spiteful tongue
With no such love or no such cause
You find no faith in womankind tonight
Your desperation to feel a woman's warmth
Still lingers on inside your soul
Deny it, I laugh, I pull at your arm
Tug at your bottom lip and you...
Cannot speak
Spiteful tongue
Truth has been spoken
Can'st thou lie and be spiteful once more
Find you cannot
Truth has been spoken
And you have been touched
By the love of a woman
By the warmth of a woman
By the wanting gaze of a woman
And thus the spiteful tongue doth die
And with it all your damned illusions
Of what's it's like to be a with a woman
To be touched by a woman
And to be loved and adored by a woman."

At not so perfect timing
I don't just see the tunnell
I see the landscape, the world as my oyster
Something to live for, to die for
I refuse to be kept in this academic prison forever
To slave over books, To cry over the pressure and expectation
I deserve more than this
I want so much more than this
I need to travel the world, To write and sing
To act on a million stages, To get the passion back in my eyes
To dance with my love and to appreciate the little things
The little things we so often take for granted
I want to break out of this cycle, to run to safety and warmth
I detest these words of ""sense"" and ""proper""
How I loath these four walls that make up my nightmare

Just one more page to read in this book
Just one more little doodle on the back of my hand
Just one more little breath and I'll be done.... and free."

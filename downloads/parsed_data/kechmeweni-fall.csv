"event","i got this from heather!
it is sooooo sad!!
i cried!
;,(



her hair was up in a pony tail, her favorite dress tied with a bow.

Today was ""Daddy's Day"" at school, and she couldn't wait to go.

But her mommy tried to tell her, that she probably should stay home.

Why the kids might not understand, if she went to school alone.

But she was not afraid; she knew just what to say.

What to tell her classmates of why he wasn't there today.

But still her mother worried, for her to face this day alone.

And that was why once again, she tried to keep her daughter at home.

But the little girl went to school eager to tell them all.

Of a dad who's never there, a dad who never calls.

There were daddies along the wall in back, for everyone to meet.

Children squirming impatiently, anxious in their seats.

One by one the teacher called a student from the class.

To introduce their daddy, as seconds slowly passed.

At last the teacher called her name, every child turned to stare.

Each of them was searching, for a man who wasn't there.

""Where's her daddy at?!"" she heard a boy call out.

""She probably doesn't have one,"" another student dared to shout.

And from somewhere near the back, She heard another father say, ""Looks like another deadbeat dad, too busy to waste his day.""

The words did not offend her, as she smiled up at her Mom and looked back at her teacher, who told her to go on.

And with hands behind her back, Slowly she began to speak And out from the mouth of a child, came words incredibly unique.

""My Daddy couldn't be here, because he lives so far away.

But I know he wishes he could be, Since this is such a special day.

And though you cannot meet him, I wanted you to know.

All about my daddy and how much he loves me so.

He loved to tell me stories he taught me to ride my bike.

He surprised me with pink roses, and taught me to fly a kite.

We used to share fudge sundaes, and ice cream in a cone.

And though you cannot see him.

I'm not standing here alone.

Cause my daddy's always with me, even though we are apart I know because he told me, he'll forever be in my heart""

With that, her little hand reached up, and lay across her chest.

Feeling her own heartbeat, beneath her favorite dress.

And from somewhere in the crowd of dads, her mother stood in tears.

Proudly watching her daughter, who was wise beyond her years.

And when she dropped her hand back down, staring straight into the crowd.

She finished with a voice so soft, but its message clear and loud.

""I love my daddy very much, he's my shining star.

And if he could, he'd be here, but heaven's just too far.

You see he was a fireman and died just this past year.

When airplanes hit the towers and taught Americans to fear.

But sometimes when I close my eyes, it's like he never went away.""

And then she closed her eyes, and saw him there that day.

And to her mother's amazement, she witnessed with surprise.

A room full of daddies and children, all starting to close their eyes.

Who knows what they saw before them, Who knows what they felt inside Perhaps for merely a second, they saw him at her side.

""I know you're with me Daddy,"" to the silence she called out.

And what happened next made believers, of those once filled with doubt.

Not one in that room could explain it, for each of their eyes had been closed..

But there on the desk beside her, was a fragrant long-stemmed pink rose.

"event","30 THINGS GUYS SHOULD KNOW ABOUT GIRLS 

1. Whatever you do, don't just show up at their house...they run around in their underwear just like we do. 

2. DON'T CHEAT ON THEM. It may seem fool proof, but girls tell each other everything about everything. Trust me, they WILL find out and you will be mud. 

3. Never miss an opportunity to tell them they're beautiful. 

4. Don't refuse to kiss in front of your friends. If they laugh at you, it's because they're jealous. 

5. If they slap you hard, you deserved it. 

6. Don't be afraid to touch them if you want to. If they're going out with you in the first place, it's because they like being in your arms. 

7. You can be dirty minded in private, really...most of them are not offended by it... 

8. Not all of them eat like birds, a lot of them can eat like whales. 

9. Every girl should eventually get three things from her boyfriend- a stuffed animal, one of his sweatshirts, and a really pretty ring. Even if it's not a serious relationship. 

10. Make sure she gets home safely as often as you can. If you're dropping her off, walk her to the door. If you aren't dropping her off, call to be sure she's home safely. 

11. If you're talking to a female friend of yours, pull your girlfriend closer. 

12. Go to a chick flick once in a while. She doesn't care whether you enjoy it or not, it just matters that you went. 

13. You're dead meat if you can't get along with their pets, parents, and best friends. Be prince charming to their friends, Mr. Polite to their parents, and make sure to be nice to their animals.  

14. Don't be freaked out by PMS. It's not gross, and it really does make them feel like shit, so be understanding. 

15. If you're officially dating, and you're introducing her to your friends, you'd better damn well introduce her as your girlfriend. 

16. Girls are fragile. Even if you're play fighting/wrestling, be very gentle. 

17. Memorize their birthdays. You forget her birthday and you're basically screwed for life. 

18. Don't marinade the cologne, but smell good. 

19. Don't give her something stupid for her birthday or Christmas or Valentine's day. It doesn't have to be expensive, but it has to be meaningful. Jewelry is always nice. 

20. After you've been dating for a while, realize that they really have started to trust you. When you have a girlfriend who truly trusts you, you have a lot more responsibility, privilege and control than you would think. Be careful with it, most guys would kill for that kind of power, and it can be lost in a nanosecond."

You can now type over 70 wpm

You type messages to people who are right next to you or on the phone with you.

You won't work at a company that blocks AIM

You sign on and immediately get 10 messages from other people

You have a few screen names, some of them secret.

You type in random screen names, just to see if anyone has them.

Your screenname has the year 2002 or earlier in it.
   
You know what %n means
	  
You don't break for the bathroom - even though you've got to go real bad - until you think of a witty away message.

You check the away messages of your buddies, every day, to make sure they haven't changed.	  

You have a few people on your buddy list just to spy on them.	  

You've had a meaningful conversation with a bot.
	   
You learned Photoshop to make a super cool buddy icon

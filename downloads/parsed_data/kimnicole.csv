"event","<lj-cut text=""Free personality analysis from ColorQuiz.com.
Generated on Thu Sep 29 05:43:53 2005."">
<b>Your Existing Situation</b>
Sensitive; needs esthetic surroundings, or an equally sensitive and understanding partner with whom to share a warm intimacy.

<b>Your Stress Sources</b>
Wants to overcome a feeling of emptiness and of separation from others. Believes that life still has far more to offer and that she may miss her share of experiences if she fails to make the best use of every opportunity. She therefore pursues her objectives with a fierce intensity and commits herself deeply and readily. Feels herself to be completely competent in any field in which she engages, and can sometimes be considered by others to be interfering or meddlesome.

<b>Your Restrained Characteristics</b>
The situation is preventing her from establishing herself, but she feels she must make the best of things as they are.

Very exacting in the standards she applies to her choice of a partner and seeking a rather unrealistic perfection in her sex life.

<b>Your Desired Objective</b>
Intense, vital, and animated, taking a delight in action. Activity is directed towards success or conquest and there is a desire to live life to the fullest.

<b>Your Actual Problem</b>
The fear that she might be prevented from achieving the things she wants leads her to play her part with an urgent and hectic intensity.

<b>Your Actual Problem #2</b>
Fights against restriction or limitation, and insists on developing freely as a result of her own efforts.</lj-cut>"

"event","Chelsea Syndrome, written by Maria Micheles and directed by Kimberly Stewart, is the anti-romance of a straight man who finds it increasingly difficult not to be infatuated with the glamour of the gay lifestyle while living in Chelsea: a m&#233;nage ensues between a mysterious woman who walks into his furniture store and his queer friend.  Maria&#8217;s last full-length play was &#8220;Ambivalence,&#8221; produced at the Actor&#8217;s Studio.  Kim directed for the Brooklyn Playwrights in their fall production and has been single-handedly credited with the failure of American theater.

"event","<lj-cut text=""I'm happy to announce that this is a perfect moment. It's a perfect moment for many reasons, but especially because I have been inspired to say a gigantic prayer for all of you. I've been roused to unleash a divinely greedy, apocalyptically healing prayer for each and every one of you -- even those of you who don't believe in the power of prayer."">

And so I am starting to pray right now to the God of Gods ... the God beyond all Gods ... the Girlfriend of God ... the Teacher of God ... the Goddess who invented God.

Dear Goddess, You who never kill but only change:

I pray that my exuberant, suave and accidental words will move you to shower ferocious blessings down on everyone who reads this benediction.

I pray that you will give them what they don't even know they want -- not just the boons they think they need but everything they've always been afraid to even imagine or ask for.

Dear Goddess, You wealthy anarchist burning heaven to the ground:

Many of the divine chameleons out there don't even know that their souls will live forever. So please use your blinding magic to help them see that they are all wildly creative geniuses too big for their own personalities.

Guide them to realize that they are all completely different from what they think they are and more exciting than they can possibly imagine.

Make it illegal, immoral, irrelevant, unpatriotic and totally tasteless for them to be in love with anyone or anything that's no good for them.

O Goddess, You who give us so much love and pain mixed together that our morality is always on the verge of collapsing:

I beg you to cast a boisterous love spell that will nullify all the dumb ideas, bad decisions and nasty conditioning that have ever cursed the wise and sexy virtuosos out there.

Remove, banish, annihilate and laugh into oblivion any jinx that has clung to them, no matter how long they've suffered from it, and even if they've become accustomed or addicted to its ugly companionship.

And please conjure an aura of protection around them so that they will receive an early warning if they are ever about to act in such a way as to bring another hex or plague or voodoo into their lives in the future.

Dear Goddess, sweet Goddess, You sly universal virus with no fucking opinion:

I pray that you will help all the personal growth addicts out there become disciplined enough to go crazy in the name of creation, not destruction.

I pray that you will teach them the difference between oppressive self-control and liberating self-control, awaken in them the power to do the half-right thing when it is impossible to do the totally right thing.

Arouse the Wild Woman within them -- even if they're men.

And please give them bigger, better, more original sins and wilder, wetter, more interesting problems.

Dear Goddess, You pregnant slut who scorns all mediocre longing:

I pray that you will inspire all the compassionate rascals communing with this prayer to love their enemies just in case their friends turn out to be jerks.

Provoke them to throw away or give away all the things they own that encourage them to believe that they are better than anyone else.

Show them how much fun it is to brag about what they cannot do and do not have.

Most of all, Goddess, brainwash them with your freedom so that they never love their own pain more than anyone else's pain.

Dear Goddess, You psychedelic mushroom cloud at the center of all our brains:

The curiously divine human beings reading this prayer deserve everything they are yearning for and much, much more.

So please bless them with lucid dreams while they are wide awake and solar-energy-operated sex toys that work even in the dark and vacuum cleaners for their magic carpets and a knack for avoiding other people's hells and their very own 900 number so that everyone has to pay to talk to them and a secret admirer who is not a psychotic stalker.

Dear Goddess, You fiercely tender, hauntingly reassuring, orgiastically sacred feeling that is even now running through all of our soft, warm animal bodies:

I pray that you provide everyone out there with a license to bend and even break all rules, laws and traditions that keep them apart from the things they love.

Show them how to purge the wishy-washy wishes that distract them from their daring, dramatic, divine desires.

And teach them that they can have anything they want if they'll only ask for it in an unselfish way.

And now dear God of Gods, God beyond all Gods, Girlfriend of God, Teacher of God, Goddess who invented God, I bring this prayer to a close, trusting that in these mysterious moments you have begun to change everyone out there in the exact way they've needed to change in order to express their soul's code.

Amen. Awomen. And glory halle-fucking-lujah.

I was a part of OH NOES Drama once myself, and indeed I ""made"" fandom_wank. It occurred because I took what set me off far too seriously--though I still think confessing you're attracted to a cartoon character because she looks 12 a little too intarweb pedophile for me. The upshot was my journal was invaded by prepubescent boys with too much time on their hands and ""superior"" l33t speak on their side. It resulted in a few anonymous comments, but nothing more because I had already froze the post and moved on. Those folks were definitely cowardly bullies. It ended quickly because I didn't react to it enough to make

It taught me a valuable lesson. It's just the fucking internet, get over yourself. No one will ever win. No one will ever learn, or be schooled from that kind of exchange. If you think it's truly dangerous or wrong, report it to the proper people and get it done.

As far as being bullied, people can only bully you when you let their judgments of you undermine your self-perception. You compound this by then over-reacting in an attempt to prove to yourself they're wrong and you're right. (The 2nd person was just horribly beaten up here but I'm too lazy to edit it, so it stands.)

It's why the dramastars win. They have nothing at stake. You have a point to prove. One that sets you up for major hurt when someone callously tosses aside one of your core beliefs, but honestly is that their fault? Or yours for not handling your buttons more maturely and effectively.

This turned into a chance to connect with theatre people, and a chance to just hang.  Had a wonderful time meeting a whole new group of folk, and have felt reenergized all weekend.  I need more of this.  

Last night was wonderful, and my mom's surprise today for my birthday on Monday rocked my socks.  :-)
A new ""big ole vat"" of lotion, and <b> bubble bath</b> in my favorite scent, Almond from this fancy little store here called Caswell-Massey.  It was a wonderful surprise, made sweeter by the fact that my mom, who doesn't like to spend money, probably spent a great deal more than she needed to on something that she knew I'd never buy because of the cost, and I found out when they called me to tell me Happy B-Day, please pick up your order!  :-)

And evidently more surprises are coming...my roomie and pal, Meli, are dragging me out tomorrow to a an unknown location for dinner, and my sister has something in the mail for me."

Sun in Aquarius 
Although you are a loyal and caring friend, you are wary of emotional commitment. Don't sacrifice love for the sake of a quixotic ideal.

Moon in Virgo 
You tend to over-rationalise your emotions which can be detrimental. Better to recognise them, acknowledge them, and accept them as an intricate part of you and your relationships.
OR - if you were born after 10:35 AM GMT 
Moon in Libra 
You think before you react, and you hate disharmony. Your emotional antennae sense the first hint of discord and you will do all you can to defuse it. 

Venus in Aries 
You fall in love impulsively and overpoweringly. Not for you the soft lights and gentle music: a firework display and a full scale symphony orchestra are more your style.

Mars in Capricorn 
Yours is a simmering, sensual passion. Your cool outer shell masks a furnace within. Once smitten, no one can come between you and the one you desire. No one would dare."

For those unlucky enough to be in my gmail address book and on my theatre mailings list, they know exactly what I mean.

Evidently the ""lovely"" Mr. Alexander or one of his equally ""lovely"" friends decided to literally cut and paste the To field from my last come and see my show if you can email into their evite list.  In order. Literally, in a side by side comparison it's immediately obvious.  They spammed my e-mail list with a solicitation to attend a fundraiser.

So...after reporting it to their umbrella non profit and learning it's legal, I informed evite and their host.  It's a definite violation of evite's TOS, and the host has responded to let me know that they will look into it.

Weird thing about it:  There are at least two names on that list that are connected to my past, and have no real connection to ASDS.  One is a theatre guy, so I'm not too freaked, but the other, well he assumed it was from me because, as I understand it, <b>I'm his only East Coast NYC Theatre friend.</b>  He was looking at coming in support of me unknowingly, and it just really pisses me off.  As for the emails, I do not know how he got either, and it's just plain freaky.

<B>EDIT:</B>  One reason this is so upsetting is that he harvested several of my professional contacts I've made since graduation, along with the personal contacts, as well.

I asked my fragile psyche for a dream that would explain this card to me.  And it did... I now don't understand the dream...  Any thoughts?

<lj-cut text=""The dream"">I was in a stadium/auditorium in winter outer clothes.  I was with a man, but both of us were younger than we really are--we felt maybe 14-17 yrs?  It was someone that in life I have no contact with & suspect that if I saw him, we would argue vehemently over anything.  But not in this dream.  We were together, hanging out, in a rather large group, like a school group.  We were starting to leave, when we were surprised by a band suddenly entering watching a band perform.  So we both excitedly decided to watch them perform.  They were doing a song--Christmas--one I recognized that I had done before.  Me & this guy were dancing and hoping around--having a great time together.  I still worried about his censorship--negative reactions--to some of my more outlandish things--but none came.  He was just enjoying himself.  The song finished & we started to leave, when I was distracted by about 500 coffee mugs in a shipping stack.  I recognized them as mugs I had made in a dream the other night.  Colored & thin tipped fish in orange & yellow.  (The color of Vivi?)  He was waiting for me--again, patiently--surprising me because he didn't seem to mind my usual ability to be distracted by the bright shiny objects.  (in life, I always believed this man resented that facet of my personality muchly.)  I spoke with some people at work about it, and they admitted they had tossed a pallet on top of some of them and broke them, as I tried to take as many with me as I could--they were being given away for free to the audience as they left.  I did not mind this--I just wanted to make sure I had gotten to keep some of my work.  I rejoined my patient friend & we exited out.  I suddenly & in my over the top way got really excited when I realized they had skipped my favorite part of the song, and I began to sing it again loudly in the exitway of the stadium. Here strangely my memory goes blank--I dimly remember him joining in & us bouncing around together singing the song, but I also remember his just watching me, without rancor or enjoyment.</lj-cut>"

"event","is September 11th.  I hadn't realized that until a moment or two ago.  Time sneaks up on you.  Three years ago Saturday, my world, and everything in it was changed--sometimes subtly, sometimes more aggressively that I ever expected change could be.

Three years--enough time for one MFA class to graduate. Enough time to clear out the rubble, and begin the process of rebuilding.  Enough time for me to lose one of my best friends, leave NYC, move on top of a mountain, go home to my parents, lose & gain (!) the same 75 lbs, and finally come back here--home.

Three years ago Saturday, someone attacked my home, my base of security, and made me a witness to living history.  Three years ago Saturday, I realized watching it on TV isn't the same.  Three years ago Saturday all of my dreams were shattered--no--pulverized to dust, and I haven't found new ones.  The foundations I have tried to rebuild are rocky.

I miss the old world, there are few people in this new one who understand how I feel or want to admit it.  I feel lonelier than I ever have at any point of my life--my experience of that day separates me from others--isolates.  Very few people not in NYC that day truly get it.  And most people in New York have different & unique experiences of that day as well.

Would I change the bad luck that brought me here on that day to a window with ""a great view of the Twin Towers!""?  I don't know.  I haven't figured out the lesson yet, or if there is one.  I'm not sure what it really would be, honestly, anyway.

When I think of Nichol, maybe that why I felt so drawn to him--the wound, the loneliness, the isolation I feel--I think he felt, and I think I saw someone who understood my place or lack of it in this world.  Maybe not.  

I know I'm searching everywhere for someone who hears me talk, but truly understand the words, the core of it, I can't vocalize--the pain behind it.

What is wrapped up for me on the memory of that day?

I just don't know.  Surely it's more than the weight of the deaths of 3,000 people--my god, I saw the population of my home town die that day.  It more than the weight of the guilt of getting out of it with very little damage to my self & my friends, acquaintances.  It's wrapped up in the scream--the keening wail I held back, so as not to burden my mother with my pain that day.  To convince her everything was fine, there was no reason to pack up & come to me.  That wail, that sound--the need to let that fly, and fly, and fly.  It's always there, the weight of it, and yet that still not it all.

It's a damned puzzle, it is, and one that takes the head off my beer every time I have a good one.  There is something about that day I still do not get, and I need to understand.  Until I do, every September 11th will be filled with this same loss & regret.  The same ache that there's something there for me to share if only I understood where to look.  The something good I like to make of every tragedy that crosses my path."

"event","Been working on my novel again...

This time I'm developing characters & as a result back story.

So far I have Kate, named for Hepburn, Louden as my ""h""eroine & Alex Nichol as my ""H""ero.  Suffice to say, Kate is a bit insecure, & Alex is a know-it-all schmuck who means well.

It's being developed with Harlequin's flipside line in mind--I need to read their guide lines first.  I figured though that character development couldn't hurt & right now I'm just started to scratch the surface of the mess that is Kate & Alex's life.

Right now I'm working on Kate's best friends--Cass & Jenn.  Each brings out different elements of our heroine--Jenn is midwestern silly & Cass is NYC sophisticate.  God I love romance--fun with stereotypes!  Yay!

Anyway--if anyone out there likes romance:  <lj user=""fezabel"">, or is a writer, experience reader: <lj user=""deifire"">, <lj user=""featherweight"">, or is just plain willing to be honest about if it's crap or not:  <lj user=""sanacrow"">--let me know.  In a few month's I'll need critical readers, and I'm hoping that some of you out there might be able to make time for it...  Pretty please..."

"event","Well, I finished the show--it went well.  I think I made some very nice connections--the producers had been associated with Roundabout for a long time--and are producing a musical this fall.  They didn't ask me back out right, but we did speak briefly of next season's play development season.  (And according to the thank you note, that would be ""sincerely"".  Hee!)

In the end it went well--the issue was the script's meandering--the fact that so little, and so much occurred in the play.  I worked very hard to create a ""rotating set"", but sometimes it dragged us down.  I would stick with the choice next time, but get me a <i>real</i> crew person.  Paul--the playwright--really wished we hadn't gone that way, by the time we were open--but really I think it was more that his script wasn't working obviously--and he was hoping to place the blame on someone else.  The directing being the easiest.

It was a similar situation to what happened with Nichol--without the emotional intensity & stupidity.  I put one thing to rest--our partnership would have failed no matter what.  Mainly because in both cases the writers wanted the director to save their writing as a first result--not a second--and did not seem aware of what that attitude costs them.  It's sad too...in Paul's case, the producer really seem to like his script in terms of what it almost was--if Paul were open to rewriting or cutting or just focussing on one character--but he wasn't.  

When David Spaulding, said producer, came to the performance, he really went after Paul, trying to get him to open himself up to the possibilities.  Paul shot him down politely.  But afterwards, when we spoke it was clear at least that David could see what I was trying to do with the shifts--compensating for action w/ movement--and that he appreciated what the options had been w/ Paul, and what we--the actors and I had accomplished in approximately 25 hours on a 3 hour piece, first run.  The acting I had managed to get from everyone was accomplished, and over all at a good place for having actors with almost no experience.  (My twins dedicated lots of time out of rehearsal to work!)  I got the impression that he liked my work overall--and ability it took to accomplish it.

Along the way, Ted paid me a wonderful compliment.  He said, he hasn't been to such a professional audition in a very long time.  (Ted was another director, NYU grad, and experienced.  Nice person to hear that from.)  The one thing I may steal from Ted, was his strong organization & autorship of the rehearsals.  I used to have that command, but he basically took charge of rehearsal did it the way I used to.  He just did it, and there was no time for an objection given on Judith, one of the other playwright's and Paul's wife.  She was frustrated, but I heard it went very very well overall.

In the end, I got a couple free rounds, a fifty dollar check, I still haven't cashed, and a very nice thank you note. I got to shoot the breeze with another director, Khary--a very nice gentleman--in a way I hadn't since cohort 7, and, again, free booze.  My first paid professional gig in NYC.  I am a director folks.

All in all, after this year, that experience was a nice confidence builder.

<b>EDIT:</b>  One thing I forgot to say was how much I enjoyed working on the play w/ that group of people--several people--including my friend, Sarah, that I cast did me very proud, for sticking w/ my initial instincts on casting.  Sarah, got noticed repeatedly, and there were several nice comments made about her work.  INcluding by me--she did me proud.  :-)  

Another happy discovery was Patrick Cohen.  Patrick reminds me a great deal of Sean Harris--only less, less, LESS anxious. I enjoyed working w/ him, and he's the best kind of actor.  He's a really good actor, & him and Sarah paired together really wonderfully.  If I ever get the chance, I'll put them together again.  :-)

I would go into more of the cast in detail...but my fingers hurt..."

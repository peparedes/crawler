I find my self doing the stupidest shit to keep me busy and to keep my mind off certain things. Buts its hard to stay busy all the time and thats when my minds starts racing out of control.  Ya know i was so planing to be out of here by next summer, but i keep getting reminded that i might be here for the next 3 years, and i just refuse to blieve it.  Apparently i am such a great asset to the boat that they dont really wanna let me go somewhere else.  so they say but still i get treated like a peice of shit, who just joined the coast guard so i am below everyone. maybe it will all change when i make rate at the end of this month who knows. but back to my original point i got no one to share anything with. everyones always too busy it seem that i am always the one trying to call and keep in touch and everything i mean i know everyones go their own lives like work and school and falling in love but i mean it only take 5 mins to call and old friend just to see whats going on. I find the time inbetween work riding my quad going out on the boat, 4 wheelin all of that crap i always make time to talk to old friends.  I always wonder what i would be like if i wasnt in the Coast Guard. I joined to save lives and go out on calls help people ya know. BUT no i get to just put around and be the bitch of the coast guard. No one tells us anything like i have know for a month that i will be gone the last 2 weeks of this month which my birthday falls on as well. but i dont know where we will be untill probably the middle of next week, the week before we leave. its such bull shit. The Coast Guards # 1 Enemy is Common Seince. anyway i am done pissing and moaning.  on a lighter note my parents are here i havent seen them in just about 6 months so its nice to be able to show them what i have been doing and whats over here anyway i gotta get going fucking duty."

"event","Well here are some lyrics from a very familar band to me. I heard them on the radio on the way here, i thought thats pretty crazy that it seems these guys put out a song that goes along with my life right at that moment. 3 years ago they had a song.. and now they have this one, well i am gonna stop boring you and get right to it. here it is Lonestar with Not a Day Goes By.  

Got a picture of you I carry in my heart
Close my eyes to see it when the world gets dark
Got a memory of you I carry in my soul
I wrap it close around me when the nights get cold
If you asked me how I'm doin' I'd say just fine
But the truth is baby, if you could read my mind

Not a day goes by that I don't think of you
After all this time you're still with me it's true
Somehow you remain locked so deep inside
Baby, baby, oh baby, not a day goes by

I still wait for the phone in the middle of the night
Thinkin' you might call me if your dreams don't turn out right
And it still amazes me that I lie here in the dark
Wishin' you were next to me, your head against my heart
If you asked me how I'm doing I'd say just fine
But the truth is baby, if you could read my mind

Not a day goes by that I don't think of you
After all this time you're still with me it's true
Somehow you remain locked so deep inside
Baby, baby, oh baby, not a day goes by

Minutes turn to hours, and the hours to days
Seems it's been forever that I've felt this way

Not a day goes by that I don't think of you
After all this time you're still with me it's true
Somehow you remain locked so deep inside
Baby, baby, oh baby, not a day goes by"

You look so peaceful sleepin'
You don't know that I'm leaving
But I'm gone
Well, I did my best to beat 'em
But in my head the demons said
Move on
When you wake up your gonna curse my name
But as some time goes by I hope and pray

Chorus:
When you think of me
Remember the way that I used to be
Remember the times I held you tenderly
Remember the way that I love you

I think about the night I met you
I swore I'd never forget you
Well, I won't
I think about the way you'll live and breathe
Inside my dreams forever
Well, you'll be better when I'm gone
You'll be better when I'm gone
Cause I know you're gonna fall in love again
I'm sorry this is how it has to end
But...

Repeat Chorus

Oh, when you think of me

As I pick up these bags and turn around
I say a little prayer and hope somehow
br> Repeat Chorus Twice

Oh... 

When you think of me (4x)"

""Never take your loved ones for granted: they could be gone tomorrow""
all of my dreams seem to fall by the side like a discarded thought or the day's fading light
but I know that if I could just see you tonight forever at times we may fall,
like we all tend to do but I'll reach out and find that I've run into you
your strength is the power that carried me through forever

Your kindness for weakness I never mistook I worried you often,
yet you understood that life is so fleeting,
these troubles won't last forever inspired me truly you did from the start to not be afraid
and to follow my heart there's a piece of you with me they can't tear apart forever

Forever I'll find you, forever we'll be
Forever your power and strength stays with me"

"event","I have never been much of a writer, i tried to write poem or stories but i always fuck them up some how. I love to draw but i completly suck at it.  So all i can really do, is find something some one already wrote, that i can relate to, cause they are much more able to get these words on paper than i am, what i am getting at is there is a band, that i believe is one of the greatest punk bands of all time Bad Religion, Greg Gaffin is a lyrical genious, and i cant even spell, anyway he just has this way of putting words together, well i am gonna stop babbling this song, is on Punk-O-Rama 8 and i just learned that its on the Japanees and german versions of Process of belief but anyway here it is, Shatterd Faith, I especially like the last verse

The scientist purported that there ain't no purpose
and the theologian told me that it's all been designed
and I'm trying to maintain objectivity
The world won't illuminate what really matters
and I'm an imperfect modal/moral meaning extractor
processing the complexity
Born of the Earth (Are we blind?)
We weren't given a choice (There's no way)
What about free will? (What we have)
Do we have a voice? (Is shattered faith)
See them run in place (Here and now)
in the human rat race (No reward)
So much dead weight (No debate) to our disgrace (Accept your fate)
Life begins when you accept your fate
Paralysis from forces raging out of control until
my confidence and will are at an all-time low
Just directionless wandering
Eternal life, eternal truth, eternal secrets
Isolated hopes and hypotheses just
Leave me feeling so hungry
Born of the Earth (Are we blind?)
We weren't given a choice (There's no way)
What about free will? (What we have)
Do we have a voice? (Is shattered faith)
See them run in place (Here and now)
in the human rat race (No reward)
So much dead weight (No debate) to our disgrace (Accept your fate)
Life begins when you accept your fate
Right or wrong,
the main criterion is what you do and not what you say
The roads you take, the friends you make and those you throw away
The method is a simple synthesis of the past and present state
You never lose if the path you choose is one you can easily navigate
I had a dream, light and carefree
But now there's doubt and gravity
But I won't run in place (Are we blind?) in the human rat race (There's no way)
I can set the pace (What we have) and accept my fate (Is shattered faith)
Shattered faith (Here and now)
Shattered faith (No reward)
the part of me (No debate) I can't erase (Accept your fate)"

I find it desolate. 
I do implore these confines now as they penetrate,

Anyway I am stuck on the boat right now, fucking duty.

I just started on it, but i picked up a book of quotes, the subject means, the wounds of love are cured by love its self. i have a couple of other favorites like, cuique summ ( to each his own) exitus acta probat (the end justifies the means) or facilis descensus averno ( the decent to hell is easy) and frangas, non flectes ( you may bend me, but you will not break me)i know you all think i am retarded, but i think its cool anyway, i got a 1989 Kawasaki Ninja 600 the other day and i didnt pay a dime for it.. but i have been spending most of my time working on it to keep my hands and head busy... well anyway thats about all for now, i'll try to stay in the habit so i can welcome people in to my life i like to call hell."

I sure do, back when there wasnt so much to worry about like the 50's. I mean all it was back then was about cars, the cool thing to do was just cruz up and down the strip in your 54 ford or chevy and everyone else did too, thats where you would meet people and race and do all sorts of shit like that.  I know that everyone will make fun of me for this one, but i also would like to live in the 80's  not for the hair styles or clothing styles or even the music, i mean it would be cool be be around when punk really got off the ground, true punk ya know, not this MTV pop punk and shit, i mean some of its alright, but i think its really lost some of its heart.  but in the 80's everything was simple, well so it seems to now a days.  but anyway maybe its just a urning to get out of here maybe its just a phase or whatever you wanna call it. but i think it would just be fun to go back in time and hang out for a while, maybe all the way back to the 40's or even to see the turn of the century.  i dont know what it is and i dont know what i am really thinking here, but again i just think it would be fun to get away...."

"event","Well i havent written in a while, but if anyone is reading this i just recently made my decision on what i am gonna do for the next 4 years... I am joining the Coast Guard on September 17th.  I just have been tired of school and shit like that its just not my thing ya know.  i did go through the process of going to Fire Fighting school but i figured with the help of some friends, that the best thing to do was go into the coast guard now and then if i am still into it join fire school later. I finally came up with a pros and cons list of everything and the Coast Guard came out on top.  I have grown up basically around water, tho i never spent a whole lot of time on it, i have always marveled at its beauty and mysterys and i mean it does cover 75% of the earths surface, a little info for ya there. but anyway its probably the hardest decision that i have made in my life and might be for the rest of my life,  i mean i have to basically put the ones that i love on hold for a while.  cause i can keep telling my self that i am gonna be stationed in seattle, but the chances of that are actually only 25% but i am gonna work my ass off in boot camp and through school so have a better chance of being stationed where i wanna be.  I decided to leave at the end of the summer cause i just wanted some time to hang out and have fun here in bellingham and anacortes before i am gone.  4 years seems like a lot but it also did when i was starting high school and then it went by way to fast by the end of it, so thats what is gonna happen, I will still be a young 24 when i get out, and well there is a possibility that it could be more than 4 years depending on weather i like it a lot and how well i do in the Guard.  i knew that traning to kill wasnt my thing so the other services were cut out. but in the CG i have the chance to save people and just do amazing things, and get paid pretty good for it.  its just i know that i have like 4 months before i join officially it doesnt seem like a whole lot of time. and when the time comes what am i gonna do about my beloved cara, i have never loved some one so much and i dont think i can get any closer to anyone, and the best thing is it just keeps getting better and better with every day, even tho she gets grumpy at night and sometimes is annoyed with me, i still know that she loves me.  so i mean what are we gonna do, i cant really ask her to wait for me, cause thats just not fair. but even if she really wanted to, you cant controll life and both of us could meet some one, and with out haveing the other one around, that would just be the thing to do ya know.  i think it just might be something we will have to take day to day, and see how it goes from now untill then and from then on.
 Another thing is my mom being a mom keeps bringing up that fact that i could die or go missing in the line of duty, by my dad brings in a good perspective, that could happen at any day or anytime, life is an unsure thing. and you just have to live your life not regretting anything, another reason why i joined the Coast Guard.  Well i am tired, and this is the shit that i think about everynight every spare moment of everyday and even in class, when i should be listining but school is so fucking retarded anyway untill next time.."

Ya know i never thought that cara would get back together with me, i just thought it was impossible, just the way things were going or what she was telling me about matt and shit.  But it turned out that i was right the whole time that he was playing them. i am sorry that she had to have been put through that bullshit, but its what happend ya know.  but it worked out for the best cause she did infact wanna get back together with me and we have!!   seince monday cause it was the 14th and that was our anniversary when we dated before so we thought it would be best if it started on that date again! so probably cause it would be easy to remeber ;)   but i am just glad that i can hold her again and look in to her eyes and know everything is going to be alright. she is the most beautiful girl i have ever met, she is a amazing and she still amazes me every time i look or talk to her. its so nice to hold her and kiss her head and her sweet lips again.  just that simple little touch makes me forget all my problems in the world.  there hasnt been a day go by that i dont think about her, seince the first time we met. i mean there was hill but thats just a stupid retarded thing and i try not to think about it. anyway,  she is just amazing and it so fits that our song, is Lonestar - Amazed   its the best song we could have ever picked, and the other day when i was at her house, we danced to it again, it was just like old times. it felt so good, man its amazing to be in love isnt it!"

So lately, I've been wonderin
Who will be there to take my place
When I'm gone, you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face
If a great wave should fall
It would fall upon us all
And between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own

[Chorus:]
If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe, I'll find out
The way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days
If a great wave should fall
It would fall upon us all
Well I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you

[Chorus]

Runaway with my heart
Runaway with my hope
Runaway with my love

I know now, just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart and your mind
I'll stay with you for all of time

[Chorus]

If I could turn back time
I'll go wherever you will go
If I could make you mine
I'll go wherever you will go"

"event","""Mourning""

Is there something that you are trying to say
Don't hold back now
It's been a long time since I felt this way
So don't hold back now

I purposely forgot about
Loving anyone
Cause I'm the only one who has
Who has been stepped upon

Is there something that you are trying to say
Cause I can take it
Cause I grew up a man this way
And if I'm hurt I'll shake it

I'll crawl back into my cave
That's how I'll make it
Cause out of all this hurt we have
Beauty thus become
Beauty thus become

[Chorus:]
In the mourning I can see the sights
No wonder I could never keep you satisfied
In the mourning I can see inside
Myself and all the things that you were trying to hide
[Repeat]

Wishing all the best for you
And now I will say goodbye
Cause all the shit that we've been through
Put wisdom in my eyes

So walk away, don't turn around
Cause I won't be standing here
Cause all the lies that I've been living through
Are becoming very clear
And beauty thus become

[Chorus]

Then you conned me into thinking
That all I had was you
The small insinuations
Were cutting me through
Cutting me through

And now I stand alone here
Stronger than before
And I'll never go back
Never go back
Never go

Just when I thought I loved someone they changed.
Just when I thought that the girl was my best friend they change.
Just when I thought everything in my life was going ok it just gets
worse.
I thought when I got older things got easier but they don't they get
worse.
If I think life is hard now, just wait it will get worse.
I thought I could trust her but I was wrong.
I figured she would always be there for me but I was wrong.
I thought we would be together forever but I was wrong.
  The way she made me feel, the way her hands could always find mine
in the darkness of the night. The way I would always rush to the
phone and pray that when I picked it up that her voice would be on the
other end. It is her voice and we end up talking for hours, feeling
like little kids joking around and gigging until 3:00 o'clock in the
morning with her, until she says she's tired and you get off the phone
still smiling knowing her face will be the first thing that I will think
of when I wake up in the morning.
  Things change and we had differnt feelings about eachother and we
just drifted away not knowing why and not knowing how to explain it. The
nights grow cold I not ok with knowing that I'm alone in life
with out that special person to think of. All I can think about is to
find a differnt person that could make me feel the same way.
It's an on going cycle, but for some reason this one person I cannot
shake from my mind, i can't ever stop seeing her face in my mind. I once was in love but I think to my self that I will never feel the same love again with anyone,
all I know is that when I finally meet a new girl that persuades me to fall
into her arms then i will never want anything to change.

thats a little poem thing that i found, and i just kinda fit it to my self, cause it was from a girl to a guy so i changed all the hes to shes ;) anyway i like it so there ya go"

There is always something going on, but i guess that if it just stayed simple we wouldnt learn about life and all that it has to offer.  I remeber when i thought i had found the one, and there was no one else out there for me. but before i knew it, it was over.  almost as simple as that just over, gone, done with, time to move on. I was ready to move on and i still am haveing trouble. but no matter how much i want her back and how much i could give her and wanna give her and take her places and change what i was doing wrong and fix everything, that i was so blind to see before. but it is all clear now, the problem is i dont think it will ever happen again, no matter how hard to pray or wish for her to come back, she is already gone. I know that she still loves me wich helps but it will never be the love that we shared, where i could call her mine, and run my fingers through her beautiful hair, and kiss her sweet lips or just touch the soft skin of her hand or face, or look in to those deep eyes of her's and see the wonderful world that lies just behind those beautiful eyes.  Yes those were the days, now only locked in my memory where they will stay untill i am no longer living.  I would give anything just to call her mine, and just to be able to wrap my arms around her one more time.  but i know she wont take me back cause she has another boy in her life, which i am happy for her and i want it to happen, cause i know that he makes her smile, and the more that the beaufiul smile shines through the better no matter who she is with.  Well i need to move on, i need to pick my self up and do the best i cant with what i got.
On a different subject, for what recently just happend, i am extreamly sorry.  the girl that i thought was for me, wasnt for me. she was a wonderful girl. but i shouldnt have rushed into it with out thinking or concidering other people, i feel like a total ass, i dont know what was going through my mind, well i do but it wasnt what it should have been.  I about lost a friendship that i wouldnt know what i would do with out, and i didnt realize it untill it was too late, i never meant to hurt anyone, i just wasnt thinking. and i hope that every one can for give me.
So i am back out on my own now, its hard to be alone, the world seems so big and cold and i am totally lost, but i have learner so much, just cause it feels good dosent mean its right, so i am not gonna rush into anything with out thinking first and not to let my lonelyness to take over my decisions.  so we will see what happens....."

There is always something going on, but i guess that if it just stayed simple we wouldnt learn about life and all that it has to offer.  I remeber when i thought i had found the one, and there was no one else out there for me. but before i knew it, it was over.  almost as simple as that just over, gone, done with, time to move on. I was ready to move on and i still am haveing trouble. but no matter how much i want her back and how much i could give her and wanna give her and take her places and change what i was doing wrong and fix everything, that i was so blind to see before. but it is all clear now, the problem is i dont think it will ever happen again, no matter how hard to pray or wish for her to come back, she is already gone. I know that she still loves me wich helps but it will never be the love that we shared, where i could call her mine, and run my fingers through her beautiful hair, and kiss her sweet lips or just touch the soft skin of her hand or face, or look in to those deep eyes of her's and see the wonderful world that lies just behind those beautiful eyes.

This girl is so wonderful, i just cant keep my self away from her i cant get enough i want it all, and the crazy thing was is we both thought of it as a movie type situtation ya know, we both liked other people then just miraculasly found out that we liked each other more! ohh it was great, i have some one to hold now, some one to call my own again, i thought i would never be able to get over cara, and i am still working on it a bit, it was so hard to hear them talk about matt and what ever when they visited me today, but after thursday i was leaps and bounds out of the hole i just was in. 
so i am takeing the new girl, well by now you should know her name huh, its Learah. she is so beautiful just with everything, the way she looks the way she talks the way she carrys herself, its awesome. ok so anyway i am bringing learah home with me tomorrow to show her anacortes and for her to meet my parents and all of that good stuff.  and about the coast guard thing, i was so ready to leave in like january but i have decided to see whats gonna happen with me and learah and go in june if it shits out, but this feeling i have now i dont think i will be going into the coast guard for a very long time. so to some of you i know that is a good thing, but to some of you who want me the fuck out of here, is a bad thing, but tough shit cause i am here to stay.  anyway just wanted to let you know that i am haveing a wonderful weekend and it all it so great, i just cant believe it happend like this i had no idea, it was going to  but now that it did, wow. ohh yeah and a nother awesome thing was that totally made my day, is i thought she was going to work at like 6 like she normally does, but she had to go at 2 and i was still in bed so she came in and woke me up this morning with a kiss. it was the best thing i could ever ask for, my heart just races every time i see her and see her smile, wow."

I think i am depressed cause i havent ever been able to sleep this much in my life, i just dont get it and i dont like it either, i have no motivation to get out of bed or do anything i wanna start running but i just sit and watch tv instead i also wanna start swimming again or working out, but i cant get my self out of the lazy reclined position. i dont like it. and i cant do anything about it. nothings going well for me at all, so again i just wanna get away and start over so again the coast guard is looking good, my parents were supposed to set up an appointment with the recruter and then call me tonight but they havent yet, so i will call them when i get home.  
I cant stop thinking about this one girl, not the new one. but the old one. i thought i was well on my way to getting over her, but i cant its not that easy, and i know that i always will have feelings for her, but i just need to move on ya know, and i cant, maybe its because of my depressed state but i really dont know, every night before i go to bed, i look at all her pictures i have and read all the letters i have and i cant help but cry my self to sleep, i know that this sounds like a cry for help and all but i need to get it written out, and i dont mean for it to upset her either, i just need to write it out, cause i have no one that i can really talk with about it cause my internets dead.  i try to get my mind off it by reading a book but it seems everything i watch and everything i read it always talks about losing a loved one or a best friend, like when i watched top gun the other day and Goose died, i couldnt help by cry and thought he lost his best friend and so did i, i know that we are friends but i dont think we will ever be best friends like we were, and so because of that i have lost part of my self, it left when she did, a part of my soul.  bad religion has a song thats called marked, and my favortie line is ""every one you have loved leaves a mark on your soul"" it is so true but yet part of my soul is gone. and i will never get it back.  ok anyway i need to get home before i start breaking down right here in the library, so untill tomorrow or when ever i write again."

My parents are setting up a meeting with the recruter for wednesday so we will see how that goes. i really wanna join and get the fuck away from here. there is just to much shit here and i need to get out or i am gonna be mentaly scared for the rest of my life.  but there is also another option, i have been talking to tyler shortt about moving to san diego and just working he wants to go to school there with a bunch of people, but now he is saying he is just gonna work for a year to get a residency there to have tuition prices go down, so now that that has come up i am gonna talk to my parents about it, i talked to them before but they said i can only do it if i am commited to school, but seince no one else is i think that working for a year and shit would be a bad ass thing to do especially in san deigo or how ever you spell it i dont really care.  so we will see how that goes hopefully that turns in to a good option, but to me the coast guard sounds a little better, i will miss every one here, but i need to start over my life is not where i would like to see it and its not going that way either.  Bellingham is a cool place but liveing with chris and andy is turning in to a terrible thing. just all the little petty shit that goes on, chris is just such a woman its not even funny, and it looked like andy was going to be laid back and all but he is not he is almost just like chris, no wonder they are friends,  so i am a little otta place, and it is hard to meet people when you dont even know where to go, i dont know where any partys are and they do they either dont wanna go or just leave me at home. so fuck them i just dont care anymore and i wanna get the hell out of here, there is nothing stopping me, besides the girl of my dreams, if anything happend there i would drop it all and stay in school here and give my all to it, but i doubt its gonna happen, but i sure hope so. anyway my arms hurt i am a little outta typeing shape so i will write again soon, talk to you later"

I dont have the vocabulary or the mental capacity to explaine this girl.  But i hate how she is so far away, i just dont get it, its not like she lives far away but she is far enough out of my reach to see what she even thinks of me. I always hope and wonder if she thinks just the littlest nices thing about me. it dosent have to be much, i dont need much, just one small little inkling will make me able to die a happy man.  There is only one other girl that i have felt this way about, and she knows who she is.  One thing that i can say is i am not in love with this new girl or anything like that. but have you ever met some one who you were like damn, maybe love at first sight can work.  I am probably kidding my self her, and she thinking nothing the same as me, so i guess she will always be in my dreams.... just one little kiss or just one little hug is all i would need, thats it, thats how much this girl moves me. Ya know there is life after death, You are in an awesome relationship but a very amazing girl, and you have your life and your heart torn to shreds at the end, like nothing even matters...  and you wonder is it worth it to try again or do you wanna protect your self so you can keep your heart whole. and than thats all gone to shit when you find a girl like i have found, and all i wanna do is be able to open my heart to let her see what kind of man i can be, just the one for her.  and if again it would end and my heart would be tossed out in to the streets, all i would say is, i was lucky enough to even met this girl, just to be in her presence.  I maybe be going way out on a line here, but i have been doing a lot of thinking, and i didnt really knew i felt this way untill now, untill she is out of my reach. why the fuck does it have to be this way?? why do i have to be teased like this? i dont get it at all, and i dont think i ever will, such is life i guess.  Well i am in the library so i need to get going before i get kicked off for not useing the computers properly.  ohh yeah and one more thing, Cara i will never forget you ever, i can never love or feel the same amazing way with any one else, but you.  You are my one and only angel, and i wish happiness for you, with what ever you decided to go through with, I love you babe, always and forever, but you always said it best.... i miss you"

I have no motivation to continue, i hate being there i hate haveing to go i hate haveing to do school work.  theres no point i dont get anything out of it.  I have two options stop school and work full time for a while, or join the coast guard, I have always been thinking about joing the coast guard, i have always loved the water and everything about it, so being on it and doing things i like to do would be the best.  i would give up everything now, to do it. my friends my family especially school.  I mean i wouldnt give them up for good, but do to something that i want to do, would be worth it i think.  well all i can say right now, is i need to talk to my parents too see what they think. My dad has always been asking me ""Have you ever thought about joining the military?"" the coast guard is a branch of it, and all the others would be too much i think.  but anyway we'll see what happens."

Sometimes i thought i might have been dead in a gutter, if i didnt have the friends i have. cause i can say that i dont have the quality as what people call ""self-esteam"" but thats besides the point.  my head is so full of confusion, and i just need a direction or a light to follow and this new girl crystal, is that light, never has anyone been this nice to me, ya know i am just beginning to realize that there is life after cara, she was my first love and i love her to death and i always will,  but there are other better people out there for me, like her. I know that i have been a bit closed minded latly, but she is opening up my mind, same with zaine.  i will never forget her but i need to move on and a way from her, she is young and dumb, thats my conclusion, and all i wanna say is i hope when she grows up and matures she will be like, damn what have i done, and i can be like well you let me out of your hands its your own damn fault, but untill then i dont know.  I have been thinking a lot about joining the Coast Guard lately, i just need to give my life some direction and be in a place where i love, the ocean. it has always amazed me ever seince i was little.  but like zaine said dont make any rash decisions when i am upset, but i am still thinking about it.  but back to the point at hand,  I know that crystal can show me a world i have never seen before about life and love, something that right now cara cannot show me.  she has her own new boy toy, or whatever she is, so guess what, fuck her.  if she is going to be this way and not act like she wants to be at least friends, then why should i try? if she can give it all up like that then why should i try and hold on?? theres no point, all it will bring me is more pain and personal anguish.  i do deseve so much better. and there is so much better out there for me... 

We all need to grow wings and fly
if you find that some one, 
they can help you fly and show
you a world of endless possiblitys
While i have my feet on the ground
all i can do is look up at the sky 
and wonder when my wings will let me fly 
I wonder how high i can fly
how high i can fly, in the big blue sky 
but i wont know untill i try 

there it is, not an award winning poem but its the best i could do, for it being 2:30 in the morning and my heads full of clutter. but i will try again later
But i just wish that i could thank crystal and zaine for all they are doing for me, and i just wish i could return the favor. i really dont deseve all of this niceness, i never really have done anything this nice for anyone, so one day i hope i can return the favor and be there for them when they need it the most, they are truly wonderful people and friends and i just hope the best for the both of them.  but untill tomorrow, i am singing out.  need some sleep to fight another day, it can only get easyer from here, so i am gonna try to hold my head up and plow through all this shit, ya know i was blessed with looks and muscles, not really, but i have more of that than brains, so i just need to use it the best i can and move on, pick up all my shit and leave this horrid place called heart break town."

Wish I could find a way to disappear 
All these thoughts they make no sense 
I find bliss in ignorance 
Nothing seems to go away 
Over and over again 

shut up when I'm talking to you 
SHUT UP WHEN I""M TALKING TO YOU!!! (harecore beat)

"event","I dont get girls at all, what so ever i am so lost.  One minuet the girl tells me to move on cause basically she already has, and the next minuet she bitches at me for trying to. where the fuck did i go wrong??? I mean did i miss something or what.  But i mean she still really cares  if she feels bad if they even cuddle, so that makes me feel good, but when i read her journal she loved it and she acted like she couldnt get enough just by the way she was talking. We talked last night, and she said she still cares for me and she still loves me but its in a different way, it makes me feel so good. but then she was saying to move on cause basically she already has, she has ""different ways"" of moving on, and if you think about it all that kid is, is a replacement, he was the closest kid around so she grabbed him, simple as that.  but again i hear tonight that they  kissed, and that fucking hurts.  so i guess that he mad his choise, so i am happy for them and everything and i hope they fuck and have kids, not really but i mean ya know  that was uncalled for, back to the subject F U C K  girls,  how can they say something and then be totally differnt flipped around the next day?  I mean where did i become the hypocrite??  She got so pissed at me for going in to her journal, i think cause she was hiding it from me, not a matter that no one should read it,  just not me.  So she goes and reads everyone elses and its no big deal like she does it everyday and every one should do it, but not me, for some odd fucking reason, but that sounds a little hypocitical dont ya think?  and another thing, i asked her a couple of times a while ago if they kissed or did stuff, but a while ago i stopped asking that, one cause i trusted her and 2 i decided that i didnt really wanna know.  so i dropped it.  so what if a girl spends the night at my place and we make out a bit... if she has her ways of movieng on i think that i should too, but ohh mine are ""different"" so again, where the fuck did i go wrong. One thing that this tells me is that she really does still care for me and it hurts her to see me either with another girl or doing better, i dont know what yet.  but how do you think i feel when she likes a kid before we even break up and the next day is cuddling in the back of a car, but now she says she feels bad for it?? then why did it keep happening and why did she fall for this kid so hard, if she felt bad about it???? again please someone let me in on the fucking secret cause obviosly i dont get it or i missed something, but whatever it is i need to know, please some one tell me.  I mean what is all this happy horse shit anyway.  I need some sleep maybe i will calm down a little huh, who knows, all i know is that girls are trouble, but you cant live with out them, there is nothing like the love of a woman, fuck fuck fuck, now what.... i hope that tomorrow is a better day, but i have a feeling it wont just back into the depths of hell right when i wake up, when will this pass???"

"event","of you, thats the end to my subject

I talked to her last night, i was able to tell her most of the things i was feeling, but i think i said too much for my own good.  ya know what hurts the most is she has totally moved on, and i know she isnt the type to look back, cause she told me, but how can you not look back?? unless you just dont give a shit about the year and seven months we spent together, she said that it meant a lot to her, but i think she was just trying to make me feel better,  She also said that she still cares and she still loves me but its in a differnt way which i can understand, but its only been a month or so i dont see how some one can move on that fast well she actually moved on before we broke up, i just dont get it too pour your heart and soul into a relationship and just like that picked it up and moved out, She still has my heart and soul  and it will be with her forver.. I can never love another girl like i loved her, there is no other girl in the world like her, she made me feel so good about my self and what life has to offer, but again just like that she took it away.  Not to be mean or anything but i kinda hope that her new boy takes the other girl, nah thats mean to say I just want her to be happy, and i feel like I am the only one to give her what she wants, cause from the break up i have learned so much about life and about relationships, the only thing i cant give her is some of my time, cause we are in two different citys, thats it, other than that she can have everything she wants... but i know she wont come back to me its just the way it is, she cares about me but not like that and never again, why does life have to be so fucking hard,  she fucking has written in letters to me that i am the angel god gave to her, and she said that i was her fucking soul mate, but she is probably telling that to her new boy right now, FUCK FUCK FUCK  how can some people be so heartless??  there is the saying treat people how you would like to be treated, but i cant do that to her, she means so much to me i never wanna see her in as much pain and i am... it wouldnt be right of me to do so either, why should two people be in pain when one is takeing it all.  I just hope she is fucking happy and i hope that fucker treats her right or i swear to god, i will break him in half.  ok i need to calm down a little, i wish i had a drum set to pound on right now, let out a little anger while makeing productive music.  but i dont have one here so i am just gonna fucking hit something or some one, i was gonna take a nap but i am too riled up to now,  but why cant she just see what she is doing to me, she could be a little nicer ya know, i know that talking like we would like to will take time but fuck how much time is it gonna take??? I will wait it out untill the very bitter end so we'll see how i feel then and again i just wanna say that i will be there for her whenever she needs something or me and i want her to be happy, cause no one wants to be said, including me, but who fucking cares about me. I'll just get walked on more, i wish i could be mean but thats not the way i am, sure i can think and say a lot but i can never be truly mean, cause i know what it feels like to have some one be mean to me, and i dont wish it on anyone, no one deserves it, ever.  But some people just get fist fucked, damn i wonder how many times i have said fuck.  I didnt mean for this entry to be this way but i guess its what happens, just like girls moveing on  is there only way of dealing with a break up or whatever, which isnt right i think but if thats the way they wanna do it then do it but dont be mean about it, FUCK FUCK FUCK i need to go"

"event","So i met this girl right, we had an awesome time  we stayed up untill the early morning chatting away it was great, she is an awesome chick. But i am still in love with another girl, and i dont want this new girl to be a rebound or something i am using to get over her. I dont want to do that to her she is so cool. so we decided to hang out more to see what happens ya know, and i think it would be totally cool if we did get together or something cause this chick is rad. 
On a different note, I feel so helpless and pissed off at the same time, cause i see the girl that i am in love with setting her self up for disaster with that one boy and i wanna help her but i cant and i wanna beat the living shit out of the other boy, but i cant. I just dont know what to do. i guess all i can do is be there for her like i always have been and always well be and hope that everything works out for her, cause i care about her more than anything in the world. its late so thats all for now, more to come as events warrent."

"event","Not a day goes by that i dont think about the times we shared or the love that we had.
I cant go anywhere or do anything that dosent remind me of her, its hard to watch baseball ,its hard to get in to my car or my old truck, its hard to be on the computer or watch tv, its hard to get through the day with out seeing one thing that reminds me of her.

I know that i have trust issues and thats what i wrote about in my last entry
I know that i have trust in both her and a good friend of mine, but i just get these bad feeling about things. I know that she liked him and they talk all the time and he knows everything and just exactly what to say, and i never could.. maybe she still likes him who knows. but i just gotta put my trust into both of them, and i will, 100%.  

I dont know how to deal with my trust issuse, i think it has all to do with my own insecuritys, my whole life i have always thought of my self as stupid and ugly and everything like that, i have never been happy with my self, untill one day an angel came a long and showed me that everything wasnt what i thought, but i fucked it up. I heard her say it but i never listened, i would give up everything to do it over.  But that angel is gone and its too late, maybe i will get another chance but i doubt it. 
I want her back so bad, but i know that i cant be there for her like she wants and needs, its just to hard to be when you are in two different citys, but i would run the world dry of gasoline if i could, to be there everyday money is not an issuse, thats what jobs are for.  and talking is only a phone call aways, no problem thats why they invented calling cards.  But its not the same.... but she has some one that can do better than that.  I know she likes this kid a lot but i dont wanna see her get hurt and thats the way i see things going.  I wish that i could have two bodies, one takes care of all the crap up here, and the other is with her, it would be so easy and simple.  But she is happy and thats all that matters right now.  
I need to back off on talking to her, i need to get back the trust and easyness to talk to each other about our feeling and everything else, its going to be the hardest thing i have ever done but i will do all i can to make things better between us.  shit i just remeberd that i have some homework to do so i have to go for now, but this isnt over yet.
I will be there for her no matter what she is my best friend and the love of my life, i just wish i could let her know that with out talking to her or upsetting her. Some people say that you need life experience to find the one you want to spend the rest of your life with but i think that once you found one, dont ever let go and i never will.  I can picture it all, just growing old together me and her, always and forever and only YOU no matter what."

"event","Never give up on your hopes and dreams.  I know that i never will. I had a dream once. she was the perfect lil angel for me, I will never for get that angel that came to me and showed me everything about life and about love.. We went through so many things and had so much time and effort up in to our relationship, but it seems pointless sometimes.. 
I tried so hard 
And got so far 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
I had to fall 
To lose it all 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
Thats in the end by linkin park, it says so well what it feels like sometimes. but all the rest of the time, i think about the girl and all we did together and all the love we shared. it would be so worth it to hang in there just to hold her in my arms one more time to play with her hair one more time, so massage her back one more time to be her boyfriend one more time...  I understand about moving on and some people feel the need to, and i know that because we are in two different towns it would take a lot of effort to keep it going and i dont want to keep her from her senior year and all the fun and good times that brings. and on the other hand i just want her to be happy, and if this boy is going to bring her happiness then i will stand behind him and her  and i will always be there for her no matter what.  always and forever and only you no matter what... ""If i oculd only have one thing I wanted in this whole world, it'd be to have you by my side always and forever. God sent me an angel and that angel was you. Thank you for loving me Forbes."" ""You're my soul mate."" Words that i read over and over to my self everyday. These words come from cards this girl has written me over our relationship, sometimes it hurts to think about it cause how could she say these things and now has already moved on? Was she lying at the time? did she say it to make me feel good? also questions that run through my mind.  But of all the pain that i am going through i am gonna smile, and i always remind my self that i was lucky enough just to spend the short time with this angel as i have and all the wonderful things about her and what she showed me about life and loveing, I will never forget that or her, and i will always be there for her no matter what, always and forever"

"event","this one is going to be quick but i said i would write more later so here it is! 
anyway It hurts me so much to see her hurt, i would give up the world so she could be happy, i am not saying with me she would be but i would still give up anything for her.  i care about her so much, but i dont wanna be to pushy and i am afraid that i am coming off as being to pushy and protective, but i feel so helpless to see her like this.  and i just wanna break the legs of the guy thats breaking her heart... i never thought that she would be the type of girl to go back to something that hurt her so much, i know how much she likes him but know one likes or loves anyone that can be so cold about things, i know that the other guy has good intentions and everything is cute and sweet when its going well, but that sweetness fades and when it does thats the real test. I dont want her to set her self up for a fall, but maybe it wont be a fall. 

there are so many things that i have realized what i have done wrong or things that i should have done, and i hate how it has to come to this for me to realize it but maybe this was the only way. but i thank her for everything that she has shown me about live and about love that no one else but her could have shown me. and i just want to return that favor. Girls are so amazing with there giving powers, like a friend of mine said tonight. thats girls just give and give and give and us stupid guys dont see that. so when the girls hint at us giving them things we think that they are needy and always want things, but in fact they do want things, but we should be giveing it to them the whole time and not be so blind and ignorant about it. so what she wants right now is space, and i am doing my damndest to give it to her, but its hard to know where the line is of ""space"" cause you are afraid if you give them too much then they will be lost forever, but in fact i maybe just the right amount.  So guys, we need to open our eyes and our hearts and get ride of this manly bullshit, you dont always have to be the tough guy and say "" ohh i am not whipped"" but thats the whole part to being in a relationship.  there is nothing like the love of a woman just like travis tritt says.  girls have a way of giveing their all and thats what makes them so special, and we need to see this and give back, love runs both ways.  well this was gonna be short but when talking about love nothings short."

"event","Why is it so hard, why do you have to be put through all these feelings, feelings of pure love to feelings of hate, from hopefullness to hopelessness, why cant it just be plan and simple.  and why do girls choose to keep putting them in situations that get them hurt.  what is it about that guy that they keep running back to running back trough all the pain? see to me the answer seems simple, sick with me and all your problems will be sovled, thats what i would like to say, but i know i am not perfect.  I am do my very best to make everything right and not have any problems, but there are always things out of my controll. in my case it was my family and some of my friends. I mean most of them now are starting to see how they acted and regeted acting that way, but put in the words of some one that matters the world to me, Its too little too late.   another thing that bothers me, is what is going through the head of the guy that is doing this, i know that he doesnt see what a wonderfuly beautiful girl he has in front of him, if he could only see, i would hope that he would change his ways. why does this world have to be about lies and decption, its seems like to have to do it to make it through life, and thats not right. everyone needs to be just straight forward with everyone, and lots of problems would be solved.  I am not saying i am perfect and i never lie, but i never lie when it comes down to something i truely believe in and truly love.  Ya know relationships are a major part of growing up, and i know that you need to date lots of people to find the one you are looking for,  but some times it seems like you dont need to look any further than what you have right in front of you.  everything would just be so easy that way, but i know it cant happen maybe a little later down the road, but i know that people need to separate for a bit to see if those feelings are true feelings of being able to love that one special person forever, but as of right now know one knows.... i will probably have more to write later, so untill then"

"event","I dont mind much if a girl leaves me, i dont mind much when she likes another guy, that seems to be way more then she ever liked you.  But when that cock sucker hurts her, shit hits the fan.  I want nothing more for the girl to ba happy and haveing fun as much as it hurts me, it makes me feel better if i know she is happy.  When she calls you crying because of what another boy did to them, your first reaction is you are so glad that they called you and its so nice to hear there voice, but when you hear tears and sniffliing, you get pissed off cause you know that they are hurt.  And then you hear what that boy did, first reaction in to go home girl the girl a huge hug and tell her everythings going to be alright, and then next is to go to that boys house and break both of their legs... but then again you would ruin it with the girl that you are in love with.  there are so many emotions and feelings running through my head, why cant it just be plain and simple and easy.  Most times i feel like crying cause i know i cant play with her hair or rub her back or hold her hand and most of all to kiss her sweet loving lips... and other times, i think its for the best.. going to to different towns no matter how close, you cant be there for the person all the time, i mean you can be on the phone and everything but not in person to hug them when they need hugged and so on.  but they way i am feeling is i would do anything to make it work for us to be in the same town and to be there for her when ever she needs me no matter what, but i cant. thats what hurts a lot  is i cant be there for her. i know that i have to go to school and so does she, but you want to change everything in the world just to be there with her, even if we are dating or going out or not. just to stand by her side right now is all i want in the world, and her happyiness.  The thing that i am planning on well i shouldnt plan but i am hopeing i will say, is that i know she wants to be in bellingham next year, and just by coincedence i will be there too, weird ;)  but then i can be there for her and be her everything she wants me to be. but untill then i have to be her best friend and be there as much as humanly possible.  Ya know you hear it all the time that you dont know what you have untill its gone and absence makes the heart grow fonder. thats all i am holding on to, and the wonderful memories that she has given me.  I always smile and get all giddy like a little school girl when i talk to her and when i remeber all of the wonderful memories> i mean i came to the conclustion that i am totally retarded over this girl,  she does something to me that i cant explaine, she has so much controll over me, i remeber when my friends mad fun of me for being whipped, but thats the whole fun in the relationship, its so nice to have a girl bossing you around, if you have the right girl, its like you were put on this earth to serve this one beautiful and wonderful angel, and you would do anything for her. well this is how i feel, man there is so much more i could write, i could type for hours upon hours about this girl that drives me so crazy  crazy in an awesome way ;)  well anyway fingers hurt so i will write more tomorrow, good night sweet dreams my angel, I love you"

"event","So a few good buddies and i decide the best way to forget about chicks is to find some new ones.  let's keep in mind that i find it incredibly difficult for me to even leave my house, let alone go somewhere where i'll be surrounded by people i don't know.  But my friends convince me that there will be tons of cool girls at PB Bar and Grill (a local San Diego night club).  So we go, get drinks and such... and then the single ballsiest (that's a word, right?) move i've ever made, i go out on the dance floor.  Here there is a good ratio of guys to girls and everyone in dancing.  it shouldn't be so hard to find someone to dance with, right?  Good lord the demeaning things that happened.... I try to dance with several people, all of whom seem completely disinterested, and then the kicker.. I'm just dancing by myself, having a decent time, and a girl, who happens to be gorgeous and dancing near me turns around and gives me a ""look.""  you know, a ""hey what's up"" look and dances a little closer.  this was my perception, mind you.  so i continue dancing at a fair distance, not to be intrusive, and a friend of hers comes up and asks, get this, ""do you need help?""  as if i was shamelessly hitting on her and shit.  her friend nods, they dance away and move thier way to the other side of the dance floor.  So i get turned down before i even made a move!  a premptive stike of rejection.  i then proceeded to say ""fuck it"" to the entire scene and left.  that was my great ""get out have fun and forget about her night.""   dismal.  no other word, just dismal.  all this does is confirm my own paranoia.  i will never again leave my little house.  At least not in San Diego, home of the world's most beautiful cold-hearted bitches.  They're different in SLO, right? i fuckin hope so."

"event","So, i'm not sure who is on my friends page, or who has me on theirs.  i'm assuming a few people from the linnea's group or at least the bass-master himself.  so phaedrus, if only you get this, then, ""hey buddy!""  So, still being in the recovery stage of the last few weeks of my life i figured the best thing might be to journal a bit and get some things off my chest (and some people off my ass).  I'm here at my parents house in San Diego and i have far too much time to myself to sit and think.  on the other hand, being around my little brothers and sister and parents all the time i am not able to drink away my cares as usual, which i'm sure is healthy.  As much as i'm recovering, i'm still pretty ruined from my loss.  Even though i am convinced it was for the best, the void it has left in my heart and life is undeniable and i have this horrible empty feelihg i have to fill with something.  If you got any ideas just let me know, i'm open to any and all suggestions at this point.  Welp, see ya later!"

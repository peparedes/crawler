My question is still the same: Why?"

"event","Don't you just love how it looks, every shade and colour, every contour of every single object on it, madly cutting across or just drifting in that jazzy beat?  Look up, how can you not love it?  After all, we all share the same sky.

People say people only treasure something after they've lost it.  Should we wake up one fine day and see that the big blue above us is gone, how would it be like?  What would fill its void?  Or was it nothing but a void in the first place?  Oceans and water will appear clear and maybe slightly murky, the sun and clouds will be hanging in the nothing above our heads, like the old lamp dangling precariously over your computer table, supported by seemingly nothing.

The word nothing repeatedly comes to mind.  The sky is indeed a void - the void that comprises of all void in the hearts of the people linked together to form the common void of space above our ceilings.  A feeling of voidness will eventually bring someone to stare at the bigger void on the world out there, and feel so belittled by the void of nature.  By comparison, our individual voidness is simply, void.

Do you still have the picture of me in your head?  The voidness that tricks and deceives, until the void above reminds you that the worst sense of loss and remoteness will never be enough to completely enrapture you.  Through the stars, the black void, the blue void, the pinkish-orangish void, the void that is filled with looming clouds, with occasional flashes of light illuminating the world, how can it be that it is impossible to fill the void in us?

I sat there in my room, and got lost.

Embrace the sky.  Our sky."

"event","Graduation isn't gradual.
quite abrupt, a sudden shock.
like rushing towards a waterfall;
One moment we're afloat, and then we're not. 

Sure, we see it coming up ahead,
The water roaring into the abyss.
make a joke, act nonchalant, and look away instead,
Unable to acknowledge what this is. 

And then the moment's past, and we're the same,
smiling again, sunshine and laughter.
Someone kisses us and calls our name,
then we think and believe, that everything's all right. 

But life's like that,
bitched: things get smashed inside,
to our oblivion and unawareness. Foolishly,
We think we're in it only for the ride,
Yet mourn for all that can no longer be.

one big, fat tragedy."

"event","Blogger is down, but I am down-<i>er</i>.  I'm on the brink of losing my first and only blog ever due to some shit unsolvable problem that prevents me from posting my 317th entry and beyond.  I just had a vision a few weeks ago of myself still blogging on that blog when I hit my mid-twenties, and I was thinking how nice it would be to look back and reflect on all those times.  Even Blogger Support can't solve my problem, I've replied to them telling them how ineffective and useless their help is, but I guess all those mails are going into their Junk/Spam folder.  It's like extracting the last few fragments of those years left in your memories you're clinging on so dearly to until that part of your life is just filled with an empty void, no, a white, blank space smothered with liquid paper with no sign or clue of what lies beneath.

If my blog dies, just don't wake me up."

I fell asleep just now after lunch at 5, woke up around 7+ and ate strawberries and an orange.  And my dad just came home and bought chocolate cake from jane's cake shop omg it's not bad surprisingly.  Thought the only good choc cake that existed in sg was lana, but this one's not bad too."

"event","The past few days have been really rainy and wet.  Always as I alight at the bus stop and walk on the path back home, the cement against the soles of my shoes feel slightly different, like I was going to sink into the fresh and moist cement and make a mark.  Half the walkway is flooded, forcing me off the sidewalk and onto the main road, and the cars blare past me, some drivers shooting me a look that says, ""What the hell are you doing on <i>this</i> side of the road?""  If there had been puddles on the black bitumen, they would've sped through them and drench me to teach me a lesson.  For now I'm walking and enjoying the slight breeze, an unfamiliar chill in the air, and the fresh scent of lemons in my fingers.  I must've looked insane trying to stuff my fingers up my nostrils.

2 more days till I finish Sept for 100words.  It's been surprisingly fast this month.  Guess it's the counting down till the common tests):"

Will try to juggle between blogger, here and 100 words.  The novelty here is just so exciting.!!!  And the private posts thingy is just so convenient, n'est-ce pas? (:"

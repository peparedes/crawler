"event","i am a girl who is alone in a crowd.

i need to speak unhindered

to express my emotions

searing them into the flesh of the computer can make words more important or insignificant than they actually are, so I shall wallow in the anonimity

I would say that this Journal is friends-only, but I may never add anyone as who can ever really tell who their true-friends are?"

"event","But, I'm still not going to go.  I don't have a date (people would claim that is the sole reason for why I'm not going) but, I didn't have a date for Winter Wonderland and I almost didn't go then.  It took Amanda, Kelly, Leah, Alecia, Melissa, Julie, Jenny, Issie, and just about every girl I know to come up with logical ""reasons"" for <b>why</b> I had to go.  But, so many people here aren't going that it's not that big of a deal.  I mean really...is your so called ""reputation"" going to gag and choke on the utter embarassment of not being seen at some STUPID ""Underground Riverview"" home coming?  Get real.  Go Sharks, though.

I feel the demanding need to mention that Randi Robertson is going out with a hideous junior named Scooter.  What comes to mind when you think of the name Scooter?  Well, if you thought that a semi-short, bald, chunky, pastey white boy then you'd be most definetely correct.  I mean, Randi is very, very pretty and she could do so much better than that.  So I thought to myself ""maybe he has a good personality"".  About as good as cheese...except cheese looks better.  So I don't know if maybe it's just because he's a junior or what... Or maybe it's like that new movie coming out where this guy falls in love with this really fat girl and everyone around him sees her as she really looks but, he just sees her as he wants to see her (in this case Gwyneth Paltrow).  Who knows...

Congratulations <b>Kenzy</b> and <b>Anthony</b>!  Good luck, guys.

I think I'll end it here.  Might I say that I thought Mandi was going to be a total snob when I first met her (using those judging first impressions) but, she's totally cool.

Yeah, look down, the best thing in my life used to be Elena, but all of this was a lesson. I'm not quite sure what the lesson is yet, but sooner or later, i'll find the answer. I WILL SURVIVE. ha"

Today when i get home i'm going to take a long ass shower in my own ass shower. Then i'm practicing with a few guys from other bands. 


I hope you choke on those words, that kiss, that bottle- i confess. Now ash yourself, yeah out on the insides. When i said i loved you i swear i lied... Let's play this game called, ""when you catch fire"". i wouldn't piss to put you out. Stop burning bridges, drive off of them so i can forget about you. So bury me, in memory. His smile's, your rope. So wrap it tight around your throat."

"event","Caught at 12 again. I swear this is getting old... I think i'm gonna see a doctor about the, ""sleep"", issue. Maybe it's the weather. It's been so fu!cking hot here. I want to throw down my guard and cry. lol. I feel so overwhelmed by events that have already taken place, or are still to come. It'd be great if i could start time when i was like 0 years old. Yeah that would be kinda good."

"event","Today sucked for me because it was my first day back since spring break. I hate mondays as it is... school is so boring i hate it so much. I wanna skip that shit and get laid. ha jk. By the way if anybody hasn't seen, ""just married"", go see it it's my favorite movie. It's such a chick flick too.

It seems i'm having a lot of troube liking life right now. Not that I like to complain it's just life is way too boring and seems just not enough. I'm so sick of going to school pretending i'm happy. I've actually learned to like being depressed and that kills me.

Anyways i'm watching tv right now and it gets me motivated to do something i don't know why. I usually only watch tv only if chapelle's show or a movie is on. It's funny cause i won't manage to get to bed till like 12 and tv usually isn't involved in my late night frenzy (late night medic). I swear though if I go to bed at 12 i won't get to sleep till around 1 or 2. I guess that's just how i role though.

Well i'm outta here take care y'all."

</p><lj-cut text=""Just So You Know""><p>just so you know,
I&#39;m glad no-one can hear us talk
(or watch us, online)
because they&#39;d lock us up.
you make me grin like a loon
and giggle like a fool
(but I do the same to you)
and you already know.

just so you know
I&#39;m glad no-one can see our hearts
(or listen, as like music)
because they&#39;d rip us apart.
mine is hungry, ever yearning
for touch and taste
and other learning
(and so is yours)
but you already know.

I am yours and you are mine;
forever we are intertwined,
two hearts hungering and grinning,
always laughing, always singing.</p></lj-cut><p></p>"

This amendment would grant fertilized eggs and fetuses personhood status.<br /><br />Putting aside the contentious issue of abortion, this would effectively outlaw birth control and criminalize women who have miscarriages.<br /><br />This is not a good thing.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.jacksonwomenshealth.com/"">Jackson Women&#39;s Health Organization</a> is the only place women can get abortions in the <i>entire</i> state, and they are trying to launch a grassroots movement against this amendment. This doesn&#39;t just apply to Mississippi, though, as Personhood USA, the group that introduced this amendment, is trying to introduce identical amendments in <i>all 50 states</i>.<br /><br />What&#39;s more, in Mississippi, this amendment is expected to pass. It even has Mississippi Democrats, including the Attorney General, Jim Hood, backing it.<br /><br />The reason I&#39;m posting this here is because I made a meager donation to the Jackson Women&#39;s Health Organization this morning, and I received a personal email back hours later - on a Sunday - thanking me and noting that I&#39;m one of the first &quot;outside&quot; people to contribute.<br />So if you sometimes pass on political action because you figure that enough other people will do something to make a difference, make an exception on this one. My RSS reader is near silent on this amendment. I only found out about it through a feminist blog. The mainstream media is not reporting on it.<br /><br />If there is ever a time to donate or send a letter in protest, this would be it.<br /><br />What to do?<br /><br />- Read up on it. <a href=""http://www.wakeupmississippi.org/"">Wake Up, Mississippi</a> is the home of the grassroots effort to fight this amendment. <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/10/07/1023558/-Occupy-My-Uterus-My-Ass!-Fertilized-Eggs-Are-NOT-People!"">Daily Kos</a> also has a thorough story on it.<br /><br />- If you can afford it, you can donate at the site&#39;s link.<br /><br />- You can <a href=""http://www.democrats.org/contact"">contact the Democratic National Committee</a> to see why more of our representatives aren&#39;t speaking out against this.<br /><br />- Like <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/WakeUpMississippiorg/237684486281516"">this Facebook page</a> to help spread awareness.<br /><br /><lj-repost button=""And you can always push this button to repost on your LJ and spread the word"" /></div><br />Even if you don&#39;t think that this really will pass in Mississippi, or you think that it&#39;ll never get passed in any other state, Personhood USA must be squashed quicker than a scorpion heading for your pant leg.&nbsp; They and other groups like them don&#39;t care about the fetuses and embryos they&#39;re protecting; they care about <b>being able to exert control over the body of every woman in the country</b> -- you, your sister, your mother, your daughter, your wife/lover/significant other, your aunts and nieces and cousins and friends.<br /><br />This isn&#39;t about the moral and religious controversy surrounding abortion.&nbsp; This is about taking away women&#39;s rights, reducing us back to chattel."

Except it isn't you, not really.&nbsp; That's because you are human and have faults.&nbsp; You are too skinny or too fat, not blonde enough, strong enough, powerful enough, etc.&nbsp; So this you-but-not-you has all of these things fixed.&nbsp; So now story-you is six foot eight, with blonde eyes and blue hair, breasts the size of beach balls, and magikal powerzz the likes of which the Internet has never seen.<br /><br />What about your other faults?&nbsp; You know, your fear of the dark, your insecurities about your weight, your need for loud noises and crowds to distract you from yourself.&nbsp; But of course, silly me.&nbsp; Your character doesn't have those, either.&nbsp; He/She's strong and independent, doesn't need anyone except his/her faithful animal companion, and isn't afraid of anything.<br /><br />So you've got your character.&nbsp; Now you're ready to join the adventure.&nbsp; To go on the quest to save the world.&nbsp; To be a part of the team.&nbsp; To make friends at a new school.&nbsp; To fight evil.&nbsp; <em>To be part of something greater than yourself.</em><br /><br />Because that's the heart of what I've been getting at.&nbsp; Writing self-inserts is partly escaping the daily grind of reality, but it's also a way to connect to something greater than ourselves.&nbsp; Unless you're a police officer, firefighter, doctor, part of the military, or directly involved with (a) the higher echelons of government or (b) some organization that works directly to make the world a better place, it's incredibly easy to feel as though your life is meaningless.&nbsp; I'm not saying it is, or that you shouldn't be finding that connection through fanfiction.&nbsp; Find it however you want.&nbsp; I just hope that you do.<br /><br />"

"event","<b>Friday, 7:</b>&nbsp; Sisters and I dressed up for Act Like A Time Traveler Day, which was technically the 8th.&nbsp; But we wanted to dress up funky for school, and dress up funky we did.&nbsp; I was <a href=""http://iaith.tapetrade.net/doctorwho/images/rose2.jpg"">Rose Tyler</a> in a Union Jack t-shirt, Gracious was <a href=""http://www.forbiddenplanet.co.uk/images/P/PP30699-Doctor-Who-&amp;-Tardis.jpg"">Tenth Doctor</a>, Andrea was some other Doctor, and Pidge was just a random time traveler.<br /><br /><b>Wednesday, 12:</b>&nbsp; Half day!&nbsp; CoSaCo, Elec-Tech, Rock, and I went uptown for pizza.&nbsp; It was kinda rainy.&nbsp; Don't remember if anything else happened.<br /><br /><b>Friday, 14:</b>&nbsp; I was supposed to go see Equipaje in her school's production of <i>A Comedy of Errors</i>, but it got snowed out!&nbsp; :...(<br /><br /><b>Saturday, 15:</b>&nbsp; Went to Sizzle's family's party instead of the Holiday Dance at the school.&nbsp; It was all right.&nbsp; However, note to self: do not try to fit five girls on a double bed.&nbsp; They do fit, <i>in theory</i>, but sleeping doesn't work out.&nbsp; At all.<br /><br /><i>I could tell you about all the assignments I had to do over the weekend, but you don't want to hear about that.</i><br /><br /><b>Friday, 21:</b>&nbsp; FIRST DAY OF VACATION!&nbsp; Also, Pidge had a movie night with her boyfriend, Shorty.&nbsp; I got to invite Equipaje, who slept over!&nbsp; We watched <i>Transformers</i>, which is an unexpectedly hilarious movie.&nbsp; ""You want me to ride you home?&nbsp; I mean, uh, give you a ride home?"" being one splendid example.&nbsp; Didn't do much besides that.<br /><br /><b>Tuesday, 25:</b>&nbsp; Merry Christmas!&nbsp; Got some stuff, but not as much as previous years on account of a prior promise of shopping on the 26th.&nbsp; But among the things we did get was tickets to <i>Rent</i> on January 12th!&nbsp;&nbsp; XDDDD<br /><br /><b>Wednesday, 26:</b>&nbsp; ZOMGG CRAZY DAY.&nbsp; First outing was to the bank.&nbsp; Then the guy whose kid Attitude was supposed to baby-sit never showed up.&nbsp; Everyone else abandoned me to go shopping, 'cause I was waiting until 3pm to go down to a restaurant for an interview.&nbsp; Turns out they do want another busser for Saturday nights!&nbsp; O, restaurant work, how I have missed thee!&nbsp; Then Elec-Tech picked me up and we drove to the mall.&nbsp; Met Otou-san and sisters there.&nbsp; Spent lots of money!&nbsp; But it wasn't all for me -- I got the rest of my gift shopping done.<br /><br /><b>Thursday, 27:</b>&nbsp; Sisters and I were late in going, but we did eventually get to JP's house.&nbsp; Man, he got <i>tall</i>!&nbsp; And his license!&nbsp; (He drove us all back home.)&nbsp; Even though it was raining, we walked to Papa Gino's for lunch.&nbsp; They got a new jukebox!&nbsp; It's all digital!&nbsp; And totally not as expensive as it says it is!&nbsp; ^_^<br />Anyways, had lunch and much hilarity.&nbsp; Attitude laughed so much, her soda came up her nose!&nbsp; Good thing she grabbed her cup in time!&nbsp; ; P&nbsp; There were plans to show JP how much the mall had exploded, but they went out the window when Otou-san took the van.&nbsp; So we hung out, introduced him to <i>Firefly</i> and Elec-Tech, and had dinner.&nbsp; But the twins went to go see <i>I am Legend</i>, so they missed out on tacos.&nbsp; He and Elec-Tech found out about slash, which made for an interesting ride to his house.&nbsp; &gt;_&lt;;;<br />After dropping him off, Elech-Tech and I went to Bran's house to watch a movie.&nbsp; We got about 10 minutes into Monty Python's <i>The Meaning of Life</i> (another movie not to see!), but that was only because there was an unrelated sketch at the beginning.&nbsp; Then we started <i>A Bug's Life</i>, but I had to be home.<br /><br /><b>Friday, 28:</b>&nbsp; Wrapped presents all morning and didn't take a shower and get dressed until, like, 5.&nbsp; Then a little after 7, I headed to CoSaCo's house for her Grandiose Gathering of Great Geekery!&nbsp; I brought the Wii 'cause Equipaje brought her copy of Guitar Hero III.&nbsp; Mad Scientist, when he deigned to show up, also brought his PS2?&nbsp; I don't know what he has.&nbsp; But yeah.&nbsp; There were games and foods and people.&nbsp; Eventually, I got Shinigami, Caker, and Equipaje to play Lord of the Rings Risk with me.&nbsp; We played the lazy version: deal the cards to assign territories, roll dice against owner of adjacent territory, higher number wins.&nbsp; I heard there was a game of Apples to Apples going on downstairs, and a few strange pictures ended up on my new camera, but we were pretty absorbed.&nbsp; But Shinigami had to leave early, so we stopped to play GH for a little bit.&nbsp; When she did leave, the three of us divvied up her spaces.&nbsp; Caker and Equipaje tied.&nbsp; I got home late.<br /><br /><b>Saturday, 29:</b>&nbsp; The reason I couldn't join CoSaCo and Equipaje at their mini-sleepover was because my family was heading up to New Hampshire -- and didn't leave 'til, like, 2pm.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; But there was all sorts of running around to be done before we left: dog to kennel, last-minute gifts for cousins, etc ...&nbsp; <br />It only took us about two hours to get up to the inn.&nbsp; No stops, not even for the bathroom.&nbsp; Our <strike>room</strike> suite was AWESOME.&nbsp; There was a big bed at one end, and at the other a twin bed, a couch, and a double bed in a little loft-like area.&nbsp; The stairs up to that were <i>so steep</i> ...&nbsp; We also got a little porch, two bathrooms, and tv new enough to plug in the Wii!&nbsp; After claiming spots, Pidge and I went down to the Fitness Room to say hi to Abuela.&nbsp; We played catch with a medicine ball for a bit, then it was back upstairs so I could shower and everyone else could wrap gifts.&nbsp; Dinner with all -- and I do mean <i>all</i> -- the family started at five.&nbsp; The food was <i>gross</i>.&nbsp; It was like school food!&nbsp; And whoever taught one person to make garlic bread with garlic <i>salt</i> needs to be in pain.&nbsp; That was just <i>eeww</i>!&nbsp; And the <u>diet</u> Sierra Mist I had didn't help matters at all.&nbsp; XPPPP<br />Then presents!&nbsp; What our family does is a gift exchange for the kids.&nbsp; Each child gets someone else's name to get a gift for.&nbsp; But I think there was a glitch in the system, 'cause I ended up with .... *counts* 5.25 gifts.&nbsp; ^_~&nbsp; Lessee ...&nbsp; The Hot Topic gift card was from whoever got my name, the bath set was from my Abuelos, Aunt E gave us all little elephant purses from Bangkok, Nana sent all four of us monogrammed scarves and gift cards to Borders, and then the .25 is my share in the Guitar Hero III game we got.&nbsp; Which we played, back in the room, for about an hour and a half, despite the ""whammy bar"" being defective.<br /><br /><b>Sunday, 29:</b>&nbsp; Had breakfast around nine, then packed up and checked out of the inn.&nbsp; Okaa-san went out with a few aunts and Abuela, Attitude just hung out with cousins, and Gracious, Pidge, Otou-san, and I went skiing!&nbsp; I love skiing.&nbsp; But I don't love waiting in line 'til 11:30 for rentals, snowboarders, not having anywhere to sit come lunchtime, snowboarders, wiping out, and skiers who think they can just zoom down the edges of the trails and not have to watch out for people.&nbsp; Also, I do not love <i>ice</i>.&nbsp; Particularly ice on steep, steep slopes that I just want to take my time going down on.&nbsp; There was a lot of that today.<br />But other than the ice and the snowboarders, it was pretty nice.&nbsp; Wasn't too cold or windy, didn't have any trouble without goggles (wouldn't fit over my glasses), only wiped out about twice, and the lift lines didn't remind me of Six Flags on a summer's day.<br />So, we skied until 3, then brought all our rental equipment back and started on home, 'cause Okaa-san had gotten a ride with her parents back to her house, and Attitude rode with Uncle K.&nbsp; We met everyone back at my grandparents' house for pizza.&nbsp; But we didn't stay very long.&nbsp; And you can see what I did when we got home!<br /><br />All right, I think this entry has gone on long enough.&nbsp; You'll just have to wait until February, when I decide that I really ought to post about January, to hear about New Year's!<br />... That is, the parts that I can tell!&nbsp; ^_~"

"event","I love snow.<br /><br />.... All right, I love to <i>watch</i> snow.&nbsp; I like to see it falling in the cold, grey day, or in the frozen, moonlit night.&nbsp; The fat white flakes we had today are the best for it.&nbsp; I love to see them spinning down to rest lightly on whatever they touch, be it still-green grass, unbent tree, or some poor fall flower smothered under a blanket of white.<br /><br />I also love to walk in the falling snow for short periods of time, say ten minutes or so.&nbsp; To be able to see the swirling, whirling flakes pouring from the sky, like a hundred thousand down pillows all ripped open at once, without the insulating barrier of a window is mesmerizing.&nbsp; To hear the world go quiet, to feel it still beneath one's feet, is quite enthralling.<br /><br />But then the night passes, and some of the magic melts away with the rising of the sun.&nbsp; The snow, once pristine and perfect, is now marred with footprints and tire tracks, turning to slush at the side of the road.&nbsp; Once that has happened, once the novelty has worn off, is the new/old landscape fair game for skiing, sledding, building, and anything else one might want to do with it (up to and including shoving it down peoples' shirts)."

"event","<p><font color=""#993366""><strong>Sunday, July 29<br /></strong>Okaa-san woke us all up at quarter to eight, but we didn't actually get on the road until ten to nine.&nbsp; Though we probably got going much faster than we would have if everyone had eaten breakfast beforehand.&nbsp; But we didn't because our first stop was Hampton Beach, NH, to have breakfast at Nurse's fiancee's restaurant, French Toast Factory.&nbsp; Neither Nurse nor her husband-to-be were there,&nbsp; but that didn't stop us from having pancakes, eggs, home fries, and yogurt parfaits.<br />Our second stop was after a good two hours of driving, at a rest stop just outside Yarmouth, ME.&nbsp; There we decided that we really didn't want to drive another three hours all the way up to Arcadia, because Camden is a&nbsp;nice town, has a state park, and we've been there before.&nbsp; Also, on route one, it's only about another hour and a half, give-or-take.&nbsp; Camden also has a Shaw's, where we bought <em>more</em> stuff <font color=""#cc99ff"" size=""1"">(the car was already&nbsp;packed to bursting when we left)</font> before proceeding to the campgrounds.<br />We were assigned campsite no. 13; a good-sized patch of sand with picnic table and firepit already included.&nbsp; The bathhouse was right nearby, and the sit itself wasn't on <em>too</em> much of a slant.&nbsp; <strong>;P</strong>&nbsp; We put up the tent with very few problems, and then Okaa-san, Attitude, and I went across the street to another part of the park.&nbsp; There we found a path leading to the shoreline.&nbsp; You couldn't really call it a beach: there was no sand, just rocks, and a <em>ton</em> of starfish.&nbsp; Under every single rock --&nbsp; and the beach was <em>all</em> rocks, mind -- there were at least a dozen.&nbsp; Okaa-san went back up to the campsite to try and chivy Gracious and Pidge down to join us, but then she ran over to Home Depot to grab a second tarp.<br />When Attitude and I came back to the campsite, we rigged the tarp to hang above the tent <font size=""1"">(in case of rain, like)</font> by tying various corners to trees, the car luggage rack, and the left mirror.&nbsp; By the time we finished, it was time to roast hotdogs over the fire for dinner.&nbsp; Also, Okaa-san made macaroni and cheese on the little propane-powered camp stove.&nbsp; After dinner, I helped Okaa-san wash the&nbsp;dishes at the outdoor sink at the bathhouse.&nbsp; Then we had s'mores, and I took a shower.&nbsp; The showers in the bathhouse are <em>much</em> better than the ones in the harbor<strong><font color=""#cc99ff"">*</font></strong>!&nbsp; This tent is very crowded with five people in it.</font><br /><br /><font color=""#800080""><strong>Monday, July 30<br /></strong>Camden National Park is only a mile from the center of town.&nbsp; So guess what we did on Monday morning!&nbsp; Yup, that's right.&nbsp; We walked in.&nbsp; Spent a little time with one foot in '07 and the other in '02, and then we got lunch at a nice little deli.&nbsp; Ate it on a patch of sunny grass where the stream running through town meets the harbor, and then Okaa-san went to buy ice and we-all sat on the grass and read for&nbsp;a while.&nbsp; then Okaa-san came back -- though only to depart for the campsite again --&nbsp;and we relocated to the library.<br />Well, that is, everybody but me.&nbsp; I got distracted by the big, colorful signs of the store across the street: SALE ON PAPER!&nbsp; Half an hour and ten dollars later, I was in possession of a nice graph paper notebook, four very nice pens, and imported origami paper with colors so bright they <em>glow</em>.&nbsp; <strong>^_^</strong>&nbsp; Then I went over to the library.&nbsp; We stayed there until Okaa-san picked us up in the car to go swimming at Lake Megunticook.&nbsp; To swim was nice, but the bottom was all gunky.&nbsp; <strong>XP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Afterwards, Gracious and Attitude and I climbed to the summit of Mt. Battie.&nbsp; At 800 feet above sea level, the ships in the harbor and cars in the town looked smaller than toys, and the fog rolling in over the horizon reminds one of the view from an airplane window, high above the clouds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back at camp, dinner was ready.&nbsp; We roasted a few marshmallows later, then Gracious and I went off to shower just as it started to rain.&nbsp; When we were heading back, it had strengthened to a downpour.&nbsp; We huddled in the tent, hoping that it wouldn't leak enough to drive us into the car until daylight.</font><br /><br /><font color=""#666699""><strong>Tuesday, July 31<br /></strong>Thankfully, we all woke up in our sleeping bags on the hard ground.&nbsp; <strong>: /</strong>&nbsp; Once breakfast was over, Okaa-san hiked Mt. Megunticook and we headed down to the beach again.&nbsp; Stayed just long enough to get a nice sunburn on my belly, and then we packed up the car and headed home.&nbsp; I got to drive once we hit Massachusetts!&nbsp; Yay highways.&nbsp; Didn't do much of anything afterwards, though.</font><br /><br /><font size=""1""><font color=""#cc99ff""><strong>*</strong>About five years ago, we sailed the <em>Ceilidh</em> up to Maine, and one of our stops was Camden harbor.&nbsp; It was nice until we were headed back home.&nbsp; Then we hit a storm for the ages: eight foot seas and&nbsp;really strong wind going in the opposite direction we were, which meant that we were doing two-mile tacks back and forth as we belly-flopped over the crests all night long.&nbsp; <strong>&gt;_&lt;</strong></font></font></p>"

"event","Today, around 1pm, we went to the Lowell Folk Festival!<br />.... Well, sorta.&nbsp; Pidge and Okaa-san and Attitude did.&nbsp; Gracious and I went with Otou-san, and ended up sitting around in the back of a home improvement store in New Hampshire for almost two hours.&nbsp; We even ordered lunch from a local pizza place and had it delivered there!&nbsp; <strong>;;&gt;_&lt;</strong>&nbsp; But eventually, we ended up in Lowell.<br /><br />It was raining when we found a place behind an old mill to park, but it let up fairly soon after.&nbsp; We found Okaa-san, Pidge, and Attitude without any trouble; they were in the front yard of a church, listening to a Celtic band.&nbsp; To get to them, we had to walk down a whole row of crafts-people displaying their wares.&nbsp; But when I went back for a closer look, they were all packing up.&nbsp; <strong>:P</strong>&nbsp; One good thing about going back to see them was that Pidge and I ran into Aunt K and <strike><font color=""#cc99ff"">Ron Weasley</font></strike>&nbsp;her BF, who told us that there was dancing happening on a stage not far away.&nbsp; When Okaa-san heard this, she led us to a big tent with chairs and&nbsp;a dance floor and a Puerto Rican band!&nbsp; Latin music is so much <em>fun</em>!&nbsp; <strong>^_^<br /></strong><br />I was the only one <font color=""#cc99ff"" size=""1"">(of our family, that is!)</font>&nbsp;who went out to dance.&nbsp; Okaa-san, Otou-san, and Pidge sat at the edge of the tent, and the twins wandered off.&nbsp; When the band packed up, I tried some iced coffee from Dunkin' Donuts.&nbsp; It was surprisingly good!&nbsp; I also tried what I think was a frappucino from Starbucks, but it was too sweet for me.&nbsp; I'll stick to the watered-down coffee, thanks.<br /><em>........&nbsp;Anyways</em>, after dancing, we went off in search of the twins.&nbsp; Instead, we found a group of drummers and a whole big crowd of people following them!&nbsp; Okaa-san said I could join until they got to the end of the street <font color=""#cc99ff"" size=""1"">(too short a time!&nbsp; <strong>:....(</strong> )</font>, and to meet them at the church yard.&nbsp; I did, and then we set off to find Aunt K.<br /><br />After much walking, we finally settled in a small Southeast Asian restaurant that had an all-you-can-eat buffet.&nbsp; I am very proud to say that I have finally mastered the chopsticks!&nbsp; w00t!&nbsp; At the under-21 table, there was much discussion of various Mary-Sue fanfics and flame wars and other fannish subjects.&nbsp; And on our way to the car,&nbsp;the four of us&nbsp;decided to write a group fanfic -- a RuroKen/Atlantis crossover.&nbsp; I'll be sure to let everyone know when it goes up, in case you're interested.<br /><br /><font color=""#cc99ff"">P.S. This is the last time I will be online/near a computer until Tuesday.&nbsp; Why, you ask?&nbsp; 'Cause everyone <font size=""1"">(minus Otou-san and the&nbsp;dog)</font>&nbsp;is going camping in Arcadia National Park until then.&nbsp; So, yeah.&nbsp; Talk to y'all then!</font>"

"event","<p>So, at 3 pm on Friday the 20th, I went to Equipaje's house and met her friend Curly.&nbsp; We chatted in the kitchen for a while, put some fries in the deep-fryer,&nbsp;then went out to do battle with the raspberry bush.&nbsp; While we were out there, CoSaCo and Sizzle showed up.&nbsp; After a little bit longer securing enough berries for all, we adjourned to the kitchen.&nbsp; Then, the crafts began in earnest.<br />I made my shirt to say ""<a href=""http://copperbadge.livejournal.com/1373076.html?view=29940884""><font color=""#ff0000"">Aurors Do It Vigilantly</font></a>"" in red duct tape letters, while Sizzle worked on her green waist-cincher, and Equipaje was sewing up her corset.&nbsp;&nbsp; CoSaCo and&nbsp;Curly, both&nbsp;of whom&nbsp;only stayed until about seven-ish, were mostly in the basement, playing on Annoying!Cousin's Wii with El Monstruito.&nbsp; But they did resurface to have pizza for dinner before they left.<br /><br />Our show did not get on the road until nine o'clock.&nbsp; This was due to my putting ""N. Tonks"" on the back of my jacket as well as the shirt, doing Sizzle/Bella's hair, deciding on a cloak for Equipaje, and then Mrs. T, El Monstruito, and Annoying!Cousin deciding that they would, in fact, come for a little while.&nbsp; So we loaded up both cars and were off to B&amp;N!<br /><br />Upon our arrival, Sizzle and I went immediately to the magazine section to acquire wristbands that showed what group we would be in to get our reserve copies of&nbsp;the book.&nbsp; Though we were in&nbsp;group 11, Mr. T promised that he would try and sneak us through with his group, which was number 2.&nbsp; After this, we happened upon my good friend Elfie, who I have not seen for a good while, due to her quitting taekwondo.&nbsp; She was resplendent in a dark green dress as pre-Azkaban Bellatrix. &nbsp;And she had Lucius' pimp cane!&nbsp; <strong>^_^</strong>&nbsp; We were molested a few times by a group of mini!Harrys, tried to be in the utterly chaotic costume parade, and eventually settled down in the sci-fi/fantasy section.&nbsp; I read DeathNote, Equipaje summarized chapters from HP6, and -- oh!&nbsp; I forgot to mention that we had previously found the twins and Pidge, and they were with us.<br /><br />The mini-Harrys came by a few times, as did a vampire<font color=""#008080""><strong>*</strong></font>.&nbsp; Also, a trip to Starbucks was made, and we got a picture taken!&nbsp; Yup.&nbsp; Much fun.&nbsp; But the real fun began when they started calling the groups.&nbsp; First everyone in groups 1 - 3 got in line, and then there was the countdown to 12:01.&nbsp; The clerks were very efficient; within ten minutes, we were out in the parking lot, trying not to jump up and down and/or scream.&nbsp; <strong>^_^;;</strong>&nbsp; We started taking it in turns to read aloud once in the car, and continued as such the entire way back to Equipaje's house.<br /><br />Once in her room, we decided to take a break from reading and get ready for bed, for all&nbsp;our feet were hurting, and the costumes were hot and confining.&nbsp; As soon as that was finished, though, we were reading again.&nbsp; It was near&nbsp;2 in the morning when I decided to give up and sleep, but the other two continued reading until about 4.<br /><br />The next morning -- and when I say morning, I mean that the sun was actually up -- Sizzle's parents came to get her close to 12.&nbsp; It was their coming that got Equipaje and I up and out of bed, and down to the kitchen for ""breakfast"".&nbsp; My parents came to get me not long after.<br /><br /><font color=""#008080""><font size=""1""><strong>*</strong>The Vampire ""Conversation"" went as follows:<br />Mini-Harry 1: Hey, you're a Death Eater, too!<br />Me: Say hello, Bella.<br />Vampire: *showing fangs* Good eeeevening.<br />Me, Sizzle, Equipaje: ...... *blink*blink*</font></font></p>"

"event","<font color=""#3366ff"">On Friday the 13th <small>(bad luck! oh, no!)</small>, I went over to Equipaje's house while the rest of my family went to Lowell. Now, we were going to see HP5, but when the time came to leave, the van wouldn't start. And then Equipaje's dad didn't have his cell phone on, so by the time he noticed that we weren't at the movie theater and came back to the house, we'd missed a good half-hour of the movie. <strong>&gt;_&lt;</strong> Since Equipaje told us that important stuff happens in that first half-hour, her mom and I decided that we wanted to see the entire thing. So Mr. T took the little monster to the movie, promising to buy tickets for the first showing tomorrow. </font><br /><br /><font color=""#00ccff"">Mrs. T wanted to watch Opra, so Equipaje y yo walked down to the center of Natick. On the way, I called Icy, and persuaded her to meet us at Park Street for ice cream. We beat her by a good five to ten minutes, which we spent sitting on a bench in the common. When Icy finally showed up, out of breath <strike>and sweaty</strike> but happy to see us, we got ice cream and Equipaje was ambushed by a mother of somebody who goes to her school. We saved her, though, and retired to the same bench in the common to eat and freak out people with our conversation. <strong>^_^</strong></font> <br /><font color=""#99ccff"">Icy had to leave soon after that. <strong>:(</strong> Equipaje and I saw a cool door and windows, visited 5 Crows (closed), Anne Reagan (open), and the music store next to the Tea Stop that I can't remember the name of. <strong>^_^;;</strong> Aforementioned music store had a TON of old records for only a dollar apiece! I got two Billy Joel, Journey, and The Best of Jethro Tull. Then we went back to the house, picked raspberries, made nachos, and watched BSG season two until about one in the morning. <br /></font><br /><font color=""#666699"">The next morning, Equipaje and I <strike>were awoken by the little monster and the dog</strike> got up around eight-thirty. The movie showing was to be at ten, so this gave us just enough time to have Cheerios and get dressed. But the van wouldn't start <strong>again</strong>, meaning that instead of leaving at nine-thirty, Mr. T drove us to the theater at nine-forty-five. We made it in plenty of time. </font><br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Cut for TEH SPOILERZ"">Talking to people <font size=""1"">(a.k.a. Equipaje's family and Icy)</font> who had already seen the movie helped me understand that I should not be looking at the movies as literal translations of the books, but rather artistic interpretations of important scenes. So with that in mind, I actually liked the movie a lot! The scenes with Filch and Dumbledore's Army were my favorite, and Umbridge was just <em>perfect.</em> In fact, I liked it much <u>better</u> than the book, which is mostly to do with the book being all filler and very little plot, and the movie being all plot and very little filler. But I wish there had been more of the school falling apart when Fred and George left, and Sirius' death was just so <em>anti-climatic!</em> Anyways ...</div><br /><font color=""#800080"">After the movie, we went back to Equipaje's house, and had just enough time to watch about half a BSG episode before my mom came to take the twins to our grandparents' house, and Pidge and I to Connecticon. The drive to Hopkinton was fun. All the radio stations were playing good songs, and we saw a whole lot of really cool cars. <br />In just an hour and a half, we were in Hartford! Okaa-san pointed out the first coupla cosplayers, and Pidge and I were both like, ""Yup! Definitely in the right place!"" <strong>^_^</strong> The Connecticut Convention Center is very big, open, and airy. After Okaa-san got money from the ATM, Pidge and I dodged cosplayers until a kindly guard at the doors to the dealer's room pointed us to the registration table. It was there that I got my first free hug from an Ash cosplayer toting a Pikachu doll. Then, bearing badges, we returned to the dealer's room. </font><br /><br /><font color=""#993366"">Going into the dealer's room at Connecticon is like diving into a whirlwind full of confetti. There were people EVERYWHERE, buying, selling, talking, browsing, walking, hugging, and a million other things. 'Twas very loud, but an enjoyable noise. Also, despite the number of people present, it actually wasn't crowded. Pidge and I saw Mookie, Jennie, and Garth! I actually talked to Jennie <small>(*swoons*)</small>, and got my second free hug in front of Garth's table. &nbsp;After a little while in there, Pidge and I headed for room 13, in which a panel on the fan fiction writing process was being held.<br />The writing process panel, and the following one on fanfiction ethics, were all right.&nbsp; There was only one woman hosting it -- more like iving the lecture -- and I think that's what gave rise to my boredom.&nbsp; I didn't learn anything in the first one, and the second was really just a recap of how to behave online.</font><br /><br /><font color=""#cc99ff"">After the panels, we headed back to the dealer's room.&nbsp; I got a Kyouya cellphone charm, two buttons (rainbow, ""Got Pride?""; pink, ""Beta Mistress""), and two sticks of Pocky.&nbsp; Pidge got a Devil's Panties comic book and Mookie's signature.&nbsp; The last thing we did before getting picked up was go to another panel, this one entitled ""How to Become a Ninja in&nbsp;One Hour"".&nbsp; This one, despite not living up to its name, was much more interesting than the two fanfiction&nbsp;panels.&nbsp; Again, it was in a lecture format, but had a much more engaged audience.&nbsp; I sat next to a man carrying a piece of paper reading ""glomp me""<font color=""#ff00ff"">*</font>.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the panel finished, it was trying not to yell at Okaa-san as she made snippy comments about the cosplayers, stopping for gas and pizza, and driving part of the way home.<br /><br /><br /><font color=""#ff00ff"">*And I would have, too, if he hadn't left early.&nbsp; *pouts*</font></font>"

Hope High School for the Drum &amp; Bugle Corps competition!</font><br /><br /><font color=""#ffffff"">At the high school, we met Double-A and Spouse, who gave us tickets for bleacher seats.&nbsp; It was another&nbsp;twenty minutes before it was to start, though, so I was glad I'd brought <em>Mists of Avalon</em>.&nbsp; The dj played the Candaian national anthem, and&nbsp;ours was performed by a bagpipe band from Fettes College in Edinburgh!&nbsp; Kilts and all!&nbsp; There were&nbsp;a few announcements, including the winner of the Miss 4th of July pageant, and then the first band came out.&nbsp; Shortly after they performed, Okaa-san and Pidge showed up to join us.<br />My favorite was the&nbsp;Jersey Surf band, and they won first in their division, but in the other division the Cadets beat out both the Carolina Crowns and the Crossmen.&nbsp; Now, there's no denying that the&nbsp;Cadets are&nbsp;extremely good, but this year they had this hokey, supposedly inspirational, talking thing going on.&nbsp; Like, in the middle of the song, somebody would just <em>randomly</em> start talking about their personal beliefs or some such shit!&nbsp; And, I mean, <em>come on</em>.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Nine times world championship or not, you just -- no!<br />Needless to say, I was annoyed.<br /></font><br /><font color=""#ff0000"">The next morning, <em>Tianna</em> came alive with the smell of french toast.&nbsp; Then we were packed up and dressed in record time, and on the dock and in line for the launch before half&nbsp;the harbor was awake.&nbsp; Attitude, Pidge, Otou-san, and I were on the first ride over to the other side of the harbor.&nbsp; (It was only the four of us because Gracious and Okaa-san were rollerblading on the bike path.)&nbsp; Then we walked to<br />Double-A &amp; Spouse's house, where we found a whole bunch of people and a breakfast spread.&nbsp; Yum.<br />The parade lasted from eleven to one-thirty.&nbsp; I dunno about you, but I'd call that <em>too long</em>.&nbsp; 'Course, some of the duration probably ties in with the fact that, more often than not, there was a metaphorical <em>mile</em> in-between groups.&nbsp; &gt;_&lt;&nbsp; At least it wasn't too hot.&nbsp; There were hamburgers and hot dogs and other potluck things for lunch, and then lemon squares and a lot of chocolate things for dessert.&nbsp; <em>Mis hermanas y yo</em> kinda took over the backyard sitting area until it was time to go.<br />I got to drive home.&nbsp; I got to fight through traffic that was backed up for miles.&nbsp; I got to brave the highway.&nbsp; Yay.&nbsp; ^_^;;&nbsp; We left Bristol between three and three-thirty -- didn't make it home 'til five.</font>"

High school, the Human Rock-Tumbler, is no place for&nbsp;a serious relationship.<br />2. Never ask more than what your lover/partner/spouse/whatever is willing, ready, or able to give.<br />3. Know what you want to say and why <em>before</em> you go on and say it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OR: Instincts and urges need to be analyzed so that the subconscious&nbsp;reasons behind them may&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be discerned <em>before</em> action is taken.<br />4.

"event","<p><font color=""#808000""><strong>Beforehand:</strong>&nbsp; Friday was a half-day at school, so during the week my Okaa-san made hair and nail appointments for me.&nbsp; Both were on Friday afternoon.&nbsp; After school, I walked home with CoSaCo and Sizzle, then went to get take-out from the Grill.&nbsp; The chicken club is really good ...<br />Anyways, went home and ate.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><font color=""#99cc00""><strong>Preparations:</strong>&nbsp; Got in the car and drove to downtown Natick around 1:30, where at Salon Paradiso I got a manicure and pedicure.&nbsp; The pedicure was actually slightly painful at times, and I often couldn't keep my feet from twitching.&nbsp; The manicure was less painful, but more disconcerting, because I could see up close what the woman was doing to my hands.<br /><br />At three o'clock, the manicurist put plastic bags on my feet so I could put my shoes back on, then sent me off to Heads Up Hair Salon across the street.&nbsp; I waited only a little while, and then&nbsp;the&nbsp;hairstylist came over and brought my to a chair.&nbsp; I took out my braid and she got me a book of styles to look at, and we picked out one that had a long hank of hair hanging loose, and the rest of it up in the back.&nbsp; So she put my hair up in a half-high and wrestled the bottom part into a french twist.&nbsp; Then she proceeded to poison me with hairspray as she curled&nbsp;top strands and pinned them to my head.&nbsp; I never actually got to see it, but I was told several times that it looked quite nice.<br /><br />After that, Okaa-san, Pidge, and I drove over to Uncle Kevin's because we needed his hand-truck.&nbsp; I got flowers!&nbsp; Then it was run, run, run all the way home so I could be ready and&nbsp;get over to Caker's on time.&nbsp; So I put on the dress and my shoes and my make-up, stuffed extra band-aids, chapstick, and money into a little clutch purse, snatched up my fan, and was out the door in record time.</font><br /><br /><font color=""#339966""><strong>Rondezvous:</strong> Okaa-san had <em>insisted</em> that the parents be allowed a photo shoot, so it was arranged that we'd all meet at Caker's house around 6:15.&nbsp; That did indeed happen, and the parents got their pictures. It was mighty embarrassing.&nbsp; &gt;_&lt;&nbsp; Also, we got going kinda late, and didn't make it to the hotel until 7:30.<br /></font><br /><font color=""#00ff00""><strong>Prom:</strong>&nbsp; Though we needn't have worried about showing up after seven -- when Vud and I arrived, the line of people waiting to go in was <em>out the door</em>.&nbsp; We shook hands with teachers, handed in our tickets, got&nbsp;a picture number that we never used, and a table number.&nbsp; The crowd around the center of the hall was so thick, I had to suppress the urge to start smacking people with my fan several times.<br /><br />What?&nbsp; I don't do well in crowds, and that's what I brought it for!<br /><br />Anyways, we found our table, #29, and with it Shinigami-chan and Rock.&nbsp; Other people were seen, other people without nick-names, other people who looked really nice.&nbsp; Finally, Caker and Fluffy and Sizzle and Eagle (Fluffy's date) showed up.&nbsp; We talked with them and explored (but not exploited!) the back hallway and made plans to get a group picture.&nbsp; The big-band swing music in the background fit nicely with the Vegas theme, I thought.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Dinner, served at eight,&nbsp;was bread, salad, and&nbsp;either noodles or chicken.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the noodles (I think they were fettucini alfredo), and didn't think they were too bad.&nbsp; Dessert was some sort of <em>very</em> rich chocolate cream, which made me VERY sugar-high.&nbsp; *cackles*&nbsp; A little time to digest, and then onto the dance floor!<br /><br />... Which was about the most crowded place I have ever been in.&nbsp; Picture a school hallway, and then get everybody dancing at the same time.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; We did find a not-so-crushed place, but it was right in front of the speakers and that wa REALLY loud.&nbsp; After only a little while, we went and stood&nbsp;in the picture line -- only to find out that they weren't doing group photos for a while yet.&nbsp; &gt;_&lt;&nbsp; Argh.<br />So it was back on the floor for us, but we didn't stay very much longer.&nbsp; They played some good dance songs like Cotton Eye Joe and a dance remix of Sweet Caroline, which was awesome.&nbsp; Only a few slow songs, though, and everything else was rap.&nbsp; T_T&nbsp; So near 10:45 we ransacked the table and headed to Sizzle's house.<br /><br /></font><font color=""#ccffcc""><strong>After-Party:&nbsp; </strong>Vud and I made&nbsp;two brief detours: the first to my house, so I could pick up sleepover stuff, and the second to CoSaCo's, 'cause seh hadn't come.&nbsp; :...(&nbsp; She didn't come to the party, either, and I feel like it wuld've been a lot livelier with her there.<br />As it was, we really didn't do much.&nbsp; Sizzle continued the tradition of the tablecloth we could write on, and everybody just basically ate cake and drank sparkling cider and watched a bit of a TiVo'd SNL about animals.&nbsp; So cute!<br /><br />When the boys were kicked out, Fluffy, Sizzle, Caker, Shinigami-chan, and I gossipped in the kitchen for a little while, then&nbsp;headed upstairs.&nbsp; We talked, took <strong>SIXTY-SEVEN BOBBY PINS</strong> out of my hair, made Fluffy uncomfortable (Caker and Shinigami), tried on Fluffy's dress (Sizzle), then got ready for bed.&nbsp; An attempt was made at Truth or Dare, but we fell asleep too quickly for it to really work.<br /><br /></font><font color=""#33cccc"">All in all, I'd say I had a really good time.</font></p>"

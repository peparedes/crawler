<br>
</span><br>
<ul>
  <li>So can i just say i have the coolest friends ever! Today at lunch
was so much fun. Bringing back all those old songs.&nbsp; I love how we
all act dorky and know one even cares. ""U + Me = Us""&nbsp; lol it was
like are own little musical right Sarah...&nbsp; So Murray had the best
idea we should go singing to the old people which sounds really. Fun I
really think this year is the time for giving. Man I have so much stuff
to be grateful for and sometimes i think i take it for-granted. There's
not one thing that i can think of that i need. I have everything a girl
can wish for. So this year Christmas for me is all about giving to
others. I think a lot of people should try it. Here we are wondering
what we want for Christmas and some people would be happy just to have
a piece of bread.&nbsp; I think this year is going to be the best. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>School is going good. So far I have 3 A's and 1 B&nbsp; I have to
take my math and Econ test. Wish me good luck. So I found out what Mrs.
B did today and can&nbsp; I just say she is the rudest teacher I have
every had. I can't wait to get out that class. One more day of econ.
Hannah and then I'm free lol . I been really behind with my scholarship
stuff. I'm going to work on it all day tomorrow. I can't believe it's
almost 2006 school is going by fast. I'm so scared to have to go into
""The Real World"" lol omg I'm going to have to get a job. ha Murray
everyone has to get one sometime. But then I'm starting on my fashion
career which I'm so excited about. I never thought I'll find something
that I like doing and that I'm actually good at. Well besides dancing. <br>
  </li>

What you see's not what you get
With you there's just no measurement
No way to tell what's real from what isn't there
Your eyes they sparkle
That's all changed into lies that drop like acid rain
You washed away the best of me
You don't care

You know you did it
I'm gone
To find someone to live for
In this world
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
Just a bridge that I gotta burn
You're wrong
If you think you can walk right through my door
That is just so you
Coming back when I've finally moved on
I'm already gone



Sometimes shattered
Never open
Nothing matters
When you're broken
That was me whenever I was with you
Always ending
Always over
Back and forth, up and down like a rollercoaster
I am breaking
That habit
Today

You know you did it
I'm gone
To find someone to live for
In this world
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
Just a bridge that I gotta burn
You're wrong
If you think you can walk right through my door
That is just so you
Coming back when I've finally moved on
I'm already gone

There is nothing you can say
Sorry doesn't cut it, babe
Take the hint and walk away
'Cause I'm gone
Doesn't matter what you do
It's what you did that's hurting you
All I needed was the truth
Now I'm gone

What you see's not what you get
What you see's not what you get

You know you did it
I'm gone
To find someone to live for
In this world
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
Just a bridge that I gotta burn
You're wrong
If you think you can walk right through my door
That is just so you
Coming back when I've finally moved on
I'm already gone
I'm already gone
Oh, I'm already gone, gone, gone, gone
Already gone
I'm gone"

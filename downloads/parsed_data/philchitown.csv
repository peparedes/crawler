I just seen the proof, she cares still for someone else, after all the years, it had to come to an end, but to let it go down like this. ALways you have to make me flip out to make yourself feel better, and me to be the bad guy for a change, and not you. If you wanted to be with someone else just say it, instead of making get into a big fight, you say he's coming around like  a week ago, i understand now when everything was going great then you become so distance, no i loves you,etc, you got cold i noticed that, i knew something was going down. but again i was a sucker."

"event","In this life there are no breaks
but starting again is a chance that you can take.
i always thought that someday we would overcome
the bad luck and from the burden the gift would come.
maybe i should have kown better. 
but i know we're coming closer to the endof whatever this has been.
when your 16 you don't know what forever means.
when your 23 you couldn't be more sorry to say.
that after all this growing up together all the good has gone away.
sometimes the boys that should be your best friends become strangers with familiar faces.
just don't tell that it's all too far gone.. 
that they weren't mean;t to live on.
and don't let go.
i just don't want to pretend.
if we're not in this together.
if we're just stuck inside our own heads. 
and i'm sorry it took me so long to find the words to write the song that we can still truly believe in but i truly believe
that we can start again

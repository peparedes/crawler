"event","Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it is time once again for the year's biggest waste of time.  The following missive was sent to me (keep in mind that it /is/ August):

<i>I'm thinking of a few things for the holiday card, but I'm open to ideas.  I'd like each of you to get your favorite piece of music and burn a copy of the song for me.  If you can't decide between a couple of songs, just burn no more than 3 songs.  Also, start deciding what your favorite things are and be specific as possible (ex.  Prince not Soul, Spider-Man not comic books).  They don't have to have anything to do with music or books or the library necessarily, but we'll try to work a little library theme throughout the Powerpoint presentation.  Thanks.</i>

Every year, the coffeehouse intellectual makes an email christmas card to send out to people.  Last year, I believe he clocked an amazing 100 hours on trying to draw the card without any software except microsoft paint because he won't take it home to work on it where he has better software.

Mind you, my good friend Fabulous just got called to task because he was in the back room for fifteen minutes after being out on the floor for three straight hours.

Let us all sing an ode to the Back Room Club....

OHHHHHHHHHHhhhh
They sit on their butts
they talk and they futz
they discuss where they are going to eat
but ask them to work
and they'll call you a jerk
as long as you're one of the elite!"

"event","An extremely hyper woman just came in with her husband who seemed to have problems stringing together more than a sentence worth of words.  She wanted to ask about planting gladiolus.

I was helping someone at circulation so I asked her to wait until I was finished to help her.  I drifted over to the desk and she just blurted out:

""I want to know about how to plant things.  I need to know how to plant gladiolus, roses, and *dramatic pause, whisper* cannabis.""

I kept my face neutral like I was taught though the light bulbs were practically bursting in my skull.

She eagerly went on to talk about the uses of hemp, and I simply stated it was a shame we couldn't grow it here.  She seemed to relax at that point and we went on with the reference interview.

And they taught us in school that people would be embarassed about asking about medical questions.....;-)"

"event","Small vignette from yesterday.

We received a beautiful, flowery note yesterday.  In this note, the 'idea' people decided this significant piece of information:

""Nobody wants to feel discarded, including our gently used books and items.""

We stamp all of our books that we withdraw and then sell as Discards.  Instead, we are, apparently, going to help the self-esteem of these items by marking them ""From the Collection of the Friends of The Library.""

(Yes, it /might/ help sales a little.  Enough to make up for the time it came to come up with the idea, the stationary and the cost of two stamps per library, probably not.)

So in a fit of irony, the Coffeehouse Intellectual and I decided to try and send the Discard stamps back to the main office with a note that says, ""Nobody wants to feel discarded..."""

"event","Apparently I missed all of the fun last night.  A bunch of teens were in the library and threatening each other.  Apparently some girls came down to see one guy and then started glomming on another one and the hating started.

After that, one of them decided to start some trouble so he concocted his brilliant plan.  He waited utnil everyone was just about to leave and asked to use the restroom.  The Book Guard let him into the restroom.  They then waited with another boy until he caught the bus at 8:10PM (we close at 8).  They (wrongly) assumed the boy had left, but he waited for almost twenty minutes to come out and try to start some trouble.

Now imagine our library as this:

You walk into one side of the library hallway.  On the right side is the bulk of the library which you can get into only through two doorways.  On the left are the bathrooms which are always kept locked and the meeting room which is kept locked when it is not in use.  Directly in front of you is another door into the hallway.  The only other things in the hallway are the Friends of the Library book sale items and a bunch of fliers and free newspapers.

So the boy came out of the bathroom, looking to cause trouble, maybe steal some stuff, and lo and behold, he is locked in a 10 foot by 20 foot hallway with no means of escape except to break out a door.  (For those of you AD&D players, don't you just wish for a gelatinous cube every once in a while?)  After about a minute, he manages to set off the alarm in his attempt to find /anywhere/ he can go.

The greatest hillarity of it all is that he is claiming we just forgot him, but what he doesn't know is:
IT WAS ALL CAUGHT ON TAPE!!!!  LOL!"

"event","This is an actual conversation that took place before the library opened this morning.  We were discussing Mary, Mary Quite Contrary.

Captain Metadata:  ""I always thought that cockle shells sounded funny.""
Me:  ""It's a type of flower.""
CM:  ""I know, it just sounds...""
Me:  ""Well, your the reference librarian, you look it up.""
(Of course he didn't, I did.  I can't help myself sometimes.)
Me:  ""Here it is.  It looks like a hooded monk.""
CM:  ""There is so much I could say about that.""
(Pause for work.)
CM:  ""I just keep thinking the hooded monk is related to the little man in the boat.""
Me:  *gasp, snort, laugh, pause*  ""Well...it /is/ an orchid.  I think Georgia O'keeffe would agree with you.""

Yes, we are dirty, dirty people.

Oh!  And a passing tidbit from a whining child:

""But DaaaAAaad.  He said he was going to give me his two cents and he didn't give them to me.""  LOL"

"event","The first thing that faces me today as I run into work (late, as usual) is Destroyer of Rules asking me what I am doing there.  I stare at her blankly, so she takes me by the arm and shoves my face close to the schedule.  I normally work from 3-8 on Tuesday and suddenly I was working 4-8?  We then did a little dance where she preceded to push me away from the schedule and scribble things around until I was working my normal schedule, sort of.  This happens a lot more often than you would think.

I am sent out to sit the reference desk and decide to do what anybody in any library will tell you takes up at least 25% of their time:  statistics.  Who used what computer for what?  How many times did the videos get shelved?  How many times did we tell someone where the bathroom was?  How many times did they use proper English when asking us questions?  (Okay, so the last one is an exaggeration, but it would be nice.)

I'm tallying up these rows of numbers while dodging rubberbands flicked at me by DoR, when I notice that Mr. Normal has sent me a message:

""Get to work!""
""But I like counting things! :-P""
""Get to work, now!""

I just giggle and go on my merry way when the next message pops up:

""You are working so much harder than the Cap.  I'm so proud of you, Pinky.""

I look up and there is a smirking DoR standing at the computer.  I just flip a rubber band back at her and grimace.

You see, Captain Metadata does as little possible work as can be done while he sits at the information desk and he sits there seven out of the eight hours he is there a day.  To say that I was working more than him was like saying I was working more than a somnolent sloth.  On top of that, she made fun of my hair.  It is pink and I like it that way.  This, of course, means war.

I haven't decided what to do about it, but I'll figure something out.  Probably start ordering some embarassing books for her and leaving weird notes.  Maybe I'll send her a nice e-card.  Hmmmmm....

Well, I got distracted from getting her back today because of the parents who want their kids to use the computers.  They are INsane.  They try to have this polite mask while they say, ""I didn't realize that I was supposed to sign up.  I have been waiting in the room for thirty minutes and all of the children have been there a /long/ time.""  The truth of the matter is that they are really saying, ""Look, bitch, I'm sick and tired of taking care of my rowdy kids.  All I wanted to do was come here and plop them in front of mindless machines while I go enjoy some Omar Tyree or Zane.  Get your ass up and do your job.""

Don't argue with them, that is the one piece of advice I have for those of you out there that face this situation.  And, whatever you do, don't get in between the 'polite' battle between two mothers who are 'just certain' that their children were there first.

Meanwhile, the kids have wandered off and are reading a book, which, of course is not the /proper/ thing to do in a library apparently, because the parents proceed to grab them and drag them into their argument.

Typical day, typical moments."

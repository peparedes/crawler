Yup I have 5 hours from now and one free in school to complete a 5 page minimum rough draft of a paper I haven't started and don't have a solid thesis for. HUZZAM. At least we're watching a movie in Japanese and I have another free so I can sleep... Maybe I'll skip Physics and leave early. Muwahahahaa~
 
Gotta see Olivia before the summer. And Ben too. Throw Doug in as well. :Y

<i>In the dark lies a secret
In the mystic seventh black book
Nekron's dark words

He is Kron, Kron's disciple
He is sworn to return
To avenge the lost divine wars

Algalord arise, greater than before
Time of peace, not of war
Shouts of freedom from the castle's walls
Freedom in the land and
Hope for all... hope for all

Into the silent, dark and forgotten
Caves of Dar-Kunor
Deep in the secret book is awaiting
Unholy Warcry
Nekron promised bloody terror
Bringing death and hate to the new world

From the rocky mountains to the golden sea
To the barbarians' sacred hills
From the icy north and misty lakes
To the walls of Seth and elvish plains
All beware!

Into the silent, dark and forgotten
Caves of Dar-Kunor
Deep in the secret book is awaiting
Unholy Warcry
Nekron promised bloody terror
Bringing death and hate to the new world

Torment, pain and bloody rain... Nekron's resurrection
They must kill the demon king or fight another war

""Only one person could crossed the darklands sorrounding Hargor
and venture forth deep into the caves of Dar-Kunor...
His is a name the world will never forget...
He is Dargor!""

He is the chosen one
He walked out through the darkness
He met the wisdom's light
Chosen to find the last dark rhymes
The last rhymes of hell

He is Kron, Kron's disciple
He is sworn to return
To avenge the lost divine wars

There was only one who knew the way
He lived in the dark, lonely caves
The demon of the night could save the day
Should they take a chance or run away...
Dargor was his name!

Into the silent, dark and forgotten
Caves of Dar-Kunor
Deep in the secret book is awaiting
Unholy Warcry
Now they swore to band together
On a sacred journey
Called by fate, time to be great
Unholy Warcry
Nekron promised bloody terror
Bringing death and hate to the new world<i></center>"

"event","""'Somewhere, far far away, there's a shitty island. An island without a name. An island not worth giving a name. A shitty island with a shitty shape. On this shitty island grow palm trees that also have shitty shapes. And the palm trees produce coconuts that give off a shitty smell. Shitty monkeys live in the trees, and they love to eat these shitty-smelling coconuts, after which they shit the world's foulest shit. The shit falls on the ground and builds up shitty mounds, making the shitty palm trees that grow on them even shittier. It's an endless cycle.
 
As I sat here looking at you, I suddenly remembered the story of this shitty island. What I'm trying to say is this: A certain kind of shittiness, a certain kind of stagnation, a certain kind of darkness, goes on propagating itself with its own power in its own self-contained cycle. And once it passes a certain point, no one can stop it- even if the person himself wants to stop it.'""

Why?
  
<i>(One Day Earlier)</i> 
Teacher: ""OKAY GUYS you should have done homework C for today, and I strongly suggest you do D... as it's due tomorrow... okay? Hint hint hint hint wink.""
  
So I get to class with most of it done.

Dean (Co teaching class): *Quizzes everyone on Kurosawa, Oe, Shin-something or another, etc. etc*
""Alright guys, let's watch more of this movie!""

At least I did my homework. Haha. Aha. Oh well.
  
Tomorrow we have to go to this panel discussion at the Japan Society donwtown featuring Dai Sato(a screenwriter of <i>Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Cowboy Beebop, Wolf's Rain, Samurai Champloo,</i> etc.) and Hiroki Azuma(Japanese philosopher). 
 
For <i>homework</i>.
 
:DD

On another note: Maybe I should go manga binging. Of course I won't <i>buy</i> anything, just spend some time at B&N with their comfy couches and splurge. It's kinda funny to me that I've been taking Japanese for 3.5 years, and am spending half of my junior year on a course dealing with modern Japan... and will probably go there before college and I've read like 1 manga. Yes, omfg I probably won't read/see as much manga/anime as most people my age/younger/older evar. Hahaha."

Now normally while I don't give a flying fuck about the service today I had a damn good time, if only for a few minutes. It's pretty hard not to when you're singing your heart out with fellow friends and getting your groove on. Mhm.
   
Otherwise than that the service was dull. Much talking, yadda etc. Oh, and the 6 chiors that were supposed to come didn't, so it was just us youth and then the adult choir. Not like it mattered because we could probably outdo any other with our virulent passion. SHAZZAM.
    
Mom's wig is more stylish than my hair FTW. She got another one with plum streaks.
  
While on the subject of the angry woman, she seems to be a bit softer in terms of bitching me up and down the house for 4 hours on my sluggish pace of homework. Maybe there's still hope for that Japan trip.

"event","Mom is being absurdly mean again. Wait. More than usual. Sound the alarms.
    
I'm trying my best to stay on her good side... but as usual that tactic crumbles within days. I spent my allowance before the week was out, came home and there was nothing to eat. Nada. For two days. Mum bought cookies, so I binged. I realize that I had one to many and apologized. Did I mention that apologies are like waving that red flag in front of the bull? The woman inspects the pack, throws a fit, hurls it at the back door and all the remaining cookies fall out. So she sweeps it up and throws everything in the garbage, crumpling up the plastic container like a madwoman for a full minute and screaming the entire time about how useless, selfish and undeserving I am.
   
Earlier I asked if I could go spend Saturday with Olivia et Co., and she responded by throwing a fit about how I fucked up in school last year. Yes, last year. Did it matter that I've brought nothing but A's home since junior year started? That my performance level now compared to sophomore year skyrocketed? Of course not. She rarely take notice when I do well, just puts more emphasis on the bad things and drags it out forever, warping and distorting it until it's some glacial monster. I'm still getting shit about how I got a C in 6th grade in my old school. SIXTH FUCKING GRADE.
 
This always, always happens. I do well in school, I get over whatever hurdles are in my way, I act kindly and respectfully to everyone then the moment I bend out of shape by one degree the neighbors hear her chewing my ass out at 9pm. Lately I haven't been sleeping well at all(12 hours in 3 days), and was wandering around aimlessly around 1am. Dear mum happened to be off that night, and woke up. She stomped down to my room, turned on the light and yelled at me for damn long time because... it was 1am. Some of the elaborate crap she spews when angered is surprisingly hurtful, however I doubt she realizes or cares. 
  
So... yeah. That's it. I fucked myself over from now until late October. There's no way she's gonna let me go out with Olivia. She once again will ground me from everything again for two months and complain for weeks and throw a fuss and tell everyone at church and the people at her job and my teachers in November during conferences so they can get on my case too for screwing up in school last year and not being able to sleep and for being the worst damn person in the fucking universe who will probably end up a 'disgraceful, inconsiderate, friendless, poor, abducted, murdered college dropout' because I ate some fucking cookies. God fucking damnit, why doesn't she listen to the shit she says?"

"event","Bouncy... bouncy... look at the kitty!
Since my school is special we have a 6-day cycle, some electives meeting every other day(or once per cycle!), regulars meeting one period later each day. Color-coding classes is fun. <3
    
Precalculus: Mr. Leong, why do you bore me so? You sound like you're bored. Or stoned. Perhaps both. What a painful class.  
  
Japanese 3: How I miss Kawano sensei and his super unorganized, highly effective class structure! Everyone says Duke is easy-peasy and it's true. Which is bad! I want to expand my knowledge of the Japanese language, and at this rate I think I'll learn more from Naruto! (I love you anyway if only for the fact that you have chopsticks in your desk.)
   
Modern Japan: My Dean was supposed to teach this elective. He always does. But now we have another guy... who pwns. I've never had a more fun/interesting history-related class ever! Anyone who devotes a page of the curriculum guide to Hello Kitty gets instant props.
  
Physics: New teacher, great class. The guy's wired on coffee. He talks about being hooked on coffee as much as he slaps out instantaneous velocity problems. Now I sit in the back and doodle and joke with Nate, but the class is great! Rhyme!
  
Contemporary Fiction: My favouritest English teacher of them all. I <3 her. Listeing to her read a passage full of 'motherfucking fuckers' is hillarious, especially with a slight southern accent. Her jokes pwn, as well. It's like one of us students teaching the class. 6 juniors, the rest are seniors... but they're cool cats. Our reading selection owns, btw.
      
Painting & Drawing II: The teacher's awesome, the kids are dull. But there's Matt. This class consists of Matt and I drawing people and adding in WOW/FF/l337 backgrounds. :DD
      
Mosiacs Workshop: Besides the fact that I leave each class with dozens of microscopic glass tile shards imbedded in my hands, this is an amazing elective. <333 Mosaics.
      
Comics: Well I dropped creative writing, but Kawano-sensei, I'd never drop this club! Once again Justin and I pwn because we're juniors, and good artists. Teacher hopes to get our work in the Big Apple Comics Festival. High hopes. xD
   
FLASH: Holy crap we have a flash website. Currently being recorded, thanks to Tennyson the compwizard. Justin and I will get dibs on the Comics section, and I'll be a regular writer. <33
     
Strength Training: First Weight Training. Then Toning and Conditioning. Now this. Geez, make up your minds with the damn name already! At least those guys know that I'm not afraid to outdo them in the weight room. MUahahahaha. Did I mention that everything aches after this class? 
    
(Oh, and about the title. I have been craving a box of fruity pebbles for freakinge ever. xD )"

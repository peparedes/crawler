"event","Okay, lately so much has been happening that I will discuss rather when I am alone and in the comfort of my sanctuary, but right now I can admit that I am scared going home. I know Mom will be waiting for me, waiting to rip into me, which shouldn't be unusual to the ones that know the situation, but just for the new ones...I have a feeling many tears will be fallen.

I am thankful that Steve will be with me for one last night in SR. But I guess I'm just tired since we went to sleep around 6:30 this morning. Hehehe, we were up playing Magic the Gathering at Ru and Cop Steve's house with Fish Mike. Other friends James and Erica were there, they are friends of Moose Steve and Ru, and I loathe Erica. She looked at me for the first time with the look of disgust. What the HELL did I do to her?!?!?! Personally I think this girl needs a good kick in the teeth since shhe woke up Fish Mike by screaming a fit at him.

<b>I</b> can be a bitch at times...but GOD FUCKING DAMN!!! I realized how much I don't like a person, and I've only met her twice...no...three times. I don't know how James puts up with it...whatever floats his boat I guess. Well I am off to take a shower, and the next time I enter, I will be more thorough."

"event","Okay...with Christmas coming up so quickly I am in a dillema. Steve is the first and only true love that I actually contemplated at first thought for a christmas gift is a ring to prove my love. I saw a celtic ring I wanted to buy him, but I don't know his size, and still...would he wear it? I want to make him a ring from my love, something that is just for him, but would he accept it from me?

My job has kept me so busy that all I've been doing is work, study, work, study, work, study. Steve and I hardly talk, and when we do, he's not a phone talking person, and when I want a full length conversation we have to be online to do it. Sometimes I wonder if what I've bought him so far is enough. I want to spoil him, I want to prove my love not just physically and such, but with lots of gifts to ravish him. No one has spoiled him like I do, that's what he says, and I want to give him a ring so badly.

I know he wouldn't give me one, since we're still too early in our relationship...ten months...but in high school, that was enough time to give a ring. Mostly because we'd have been together everyday, enough time to get to know each other and such, but separately, I wonder if he'd reject us. Tera alone has been scared, because she agrees that the ring is perfect for him, but should we buy it is the question. I love him so badly that it hurts me, my other half, that even Tera is starting to fall for him as well, but she thinks that Derrick may come back for me too...but again...that's not one of my priorities.

Oh goddess...I need answers. I want to ravish Star and Shelby with gifts too. I saw this gift that I wanted to buy, screw the cost, I wanted it for them, but there's Nikki to consider, and I would probably be too scared to give them the gift anyways. So I didn't get it. But we did find something else that reminds us of when Shelby and I would play like puppies.

I want to get Sasha and the sisters a gift too, but I haven't spoken to them since I sent them my letter, and I fear that they too, will reject me. Lisa is my only confidant in this little battle, and even Tera wishes to embrace and kiss Tekenthis and Myrial and Sasha. We both do. But I may just send a card signing it with both our names and give it to Lisa to give to Sasha.

Again on the Steve thing: What in the holy-demon-hell do I do with these feelings? Oh goddess, I need someone to help me. I need advice, seriously. I never everyone I love to tell me what I should do. Someone please...give me something!"

"event","Okay, tonight I decided to go out and drink and such with Nikki, Shelby, Jason, and Iian, yeah it went well as such. I am still at the house, currently wondering about whether to sneak out of the house and go home. I want to sleep in my own bed, but unsure. I think Shelby dislikes me again, so I am not going to worry all to much since I am not sure we are still friends. Last time we spoke about this, we decided and agreed to go our separate ways. I am a bit confused on that, since I told her that I had loved her but she has Nikki, whom she loves very much, and I've got Steve, whom I love very much.

Anyways, I am currently calm, wearing no underwear, wet hair, and supposedly, Nikki is getting out of the hot tub. I don't understand how Shelby can handle Nikki having her and a guy at the same time. I can understand that a guy can only give a certain pleasure that a girl cannot, but a girl knows the body better, and the guy only has a dick. Well I guess its not my say at all, and I intend on staying out of it, but I hope Nikki doesn't hurt Jason the way she does with other guys."

I had a wonderful thanksgiving week with my father, and before that, a great weekend with Steve, and this is what I get? I got fucked in the karma department apparently. Well I did get paid today, and I gave my mom about a hundred and fifty dollars of it, because I wanted to help out and be curtious. So I'll have to wait until December 9th to get that skirt and shirt, hopefully that they will still be there when I go to buy them, because I really want to put the plan into motion.

"event","I want to scream my secrets out from this soul and let everyone know how I feel. I don't understand why I can't just be honest with them, and get on my knees in front of the person I miss so desperately. I woke up this morning without the feeling of dread towards Mike, without the feeling of my heart breaking because he's not with me, and I don't know how I feel about that, but it feels pretty good. I lied when I told him I sent my sister the pictures of us, the stuffed Snoopy and the pin of Naru Narusagawa. They sat in my room, the pin on my shirt over my heart, Snoopy on my bed every night to hold, and my pictures on my wall and shelves.

Today I took down the pictures, removed the pin, and kissed my Snoopy one last time, and taking all of the pictures of him and us together, even the ones on my computer are on a disc and are in the box and deleted, and are in Tony's garage. I felt relieved and a bit sad by this, and Tony wanted to know what was in the box. When I told him what was inside, he nodded his head and agreed not to touch or destroy the box without my permission.

I went to school today with this feeling bumping, and I started to walk home, on my way to work when I stopped and looked at the direction of where the high school is and my heart start to beat wildly. I knew where I wanted to be was in her arms, I hugged myself, remembering the way she used to embrace so lovingly and yet, so strong. Prom pictures of her and I together so happy, our slow dance still replays in my memory, and I smile so fondly. I hope someday she will understand why I did what I did, I had to protect her! Damn it! I loved her, you protect the ones you love...I just want to scream it all out.

I want to scream out the pain, the anguish, the fury inside of this tall and tiny body. I want to dance, dance into eternity and feel the wind in my hair. Sing with my voice and soul, letting out the secrets ripple through my body violently like an earthquake. Run as fast as I can, racing the wind through me or beside me, chase the animals from one end of the earth to the other. Jump high and fly into the stars opened arms, and then fall back down to earth with my arms spred wide open and a smile appears on my face. Kiss the ground lovingly like a lover greeting the other and just as happily.

Well I better run off to sleep and curl into a ball and go over my notes. Good night, and don't try and figure out my entry, I'm just switching through different songs on line and am just typing in what I feel. Night!!"

"event","Friday I went out with Nikki and Shelby after work. Shelby went to Bank of the West to cash her check because she got paid that week and I saw Tim Wong...Mike's older brother! He and I both were wide-eyed for a moment and I felt my heart racing. I wanted out of there, so I told Shelby to hurry. She was finished and I was already out of the door. I felt nervous, thank goodness Tim wasn't the one helping us.

We went to Outer Limits or Clark's as I call it, where Daniel and Alex were. And we were there for quite some time. Nikki had ""Dressed"" me for the night because we were getting seriously drunk, my first time seriously drinking like this, dancing and causing chaos. Well Shelby and I changed in the bathroom and I felt nervous walking out of the bathroom. The guys saw me and all went ""Woah!! Look at her!! She's hot!"" when I came out. I turned bright red and immediately ran to Daniel's side where I felt comfortable. Daniel just thought I looked nice, and later I ended up playing Magic the Gathering with Alex, which shocked me. Alex and I don't normally tolerate each other's presence very well, because we're both territorial of Daniel, and Daniel was being super cute that night!!

It turned out the guy we were waiting for wasn't going to show up, but was home...sleeping!! So Kitty came to Outer Limits, where is now our home to hang out, because of Arthur. Arthur, whom I met for the first time two weeks ago, is very sweet, cute, and is totally like me! Nikki wouldn't stop with the idea of setting us up if I dumped Steve. Well we all eventually went out, Kitty, Shelby, Nikki, Arthur and myself went to Club 440 to get alcohol. Actually Arthur did, the rest of us went to the gas station for food to eat, I got a lollipop because I wasn't very hungry. But it was interesting, because when we left, guys were starring at my red skirt and top and saying ""Yummy!"" at me, and I hissed at them and one of them smiled and made a take a bite movement with his mouth. I glared and walked away and the whistles began. I rolled my eyes and continued away, where I ran to Arthur and stuck my tongue out at the guys.

But it was interesting talking to Arthur. Nikki was ahead of us, and she pulled back behind us where Kitty and Shelby were and apparently when it was just him and I, we drifted towards each other, almost holding hands. And they talked about our asses. Apparently mine sways side to side, as if teasing the person looking, and Arthur's bounces. As if I was carrying how either of our asses moved. We got back to the store, where no one was after two hours of trying to kick out the last three guys, and Nikki poured me a double shot of tequila. I didn't know it was a double, so we all saluted and I downed it. It touched my tongue, but I didn't spit it out, I just downed it and made a face afterwards. Shelby was next and she spit out most of it because it touched her tongue. I felt dizzy and very floaty after that, after it kicked in. I began prancing around the store, it being my very first heavy liquor drink, and giggling.

""Pour me brandy, Kitty cat!"" I said happily.

Nikki was already working on her third shot and Shelby decided to stay sober, as well as Kitty and Arthur. I thought it was smart after the fact that I never knew how I acted when I was drunk, so it was good that a guy would be around to protect them from me. Kitty poured me start brandy and I liked it, enough that I mixed it with Pepsi and Dr. Pepper and ran to turn on the radio and play Queen of the Damned soundtrack. I started dancing around the comic store, and Nikki had finished half of the bottle of tequila already and Shelby was trying to get her to calm down. I, on the other hand, was busy dancing and listening to the music in my soul. I felt like I could practically fly and spun a few times and fell against the tables.

""Arthur..."" I giggled. He turned and looked at me, ""If I fall and I'm near you, will you catch me?"" I asked, again trying to look and sound sober...good luck.

""Yeah, of course."" He smiled and I giggled and ran to dance more.

But then I ran to Nikki because she was trying to have sex with Shelby and Shelby was pushing her away, so I attacked Nikki and we kissed for a bit. She bit my lip and I liked it! Finally Shelby pushed me away, and I giggled, running to make myself another drink. I had finished at least four drinks by that time, and I was downing them like water. Eventually Nikki began crying about Brian, I felt myself sobering up quickly, and drank more, because I didn't want to feel SHIT!! I wanted to forget everything...good luck on that part too. Once the alcohol kicked in MAJOR, I was too dizzy and I was crawling around on the carpet away from Kitty and Arthur. Shelby told them to watch me because she didn't know what I would do, so I collapsed on the floor in the back of the comics side and giggled for a long time.

Apparently Arthur and Kitty stayed by my side and I was pretty happy. Nikki was close by and so was Shelby, and I kept talking about how horrible Steve was to me and how wonderful Arthur was, even though he only met me for the third time. Then I got very angry and depressed. I was speaking English at first, curling up in Arthur's lap, wanting to be held desparately, and then I began crying. Memories of Brad and Tony, and some other things were coming back. I remember begging to reach my cell phone to call Sasha. I wanted to say I'm sorry to her and someone else.

""Please!! I've got to reach Teke! I have to tell her I'm sorry!! She needs to know I'm sooo sorry for leaving her!!"" I screamed and cried, and by that time, Shelby told me that an Irish accent kicked in big time.

It was hard for most of them to hear me, because I was crying into Arthur's stomach, begging to stop carrying and to stop remembering. Then I got angry and vengeful.

""Why did he choose me?! I was only eight years old!! God damn it!! I didn't deserve it!!"" I punched the floor, talking about Brad, and Kitty and Arthur had to stop me from hurting myself anymore than I already did my hand. My knuckle is sore but that's it. Then I began crying about Tony and I just clung to Arthur, and that time, Shelby and Nikki were there and tried to knock some sense into me.

""I wasn't good enough. Not smarter or well behaved! I wasn't good enough to be his daughter!""

""That's not true Ashley!"" Shelby said.

""Tony's an ass Ash, you gave more than needed to that jerk,"" Nikki said.

I just sobbed and begged to speak to Sasha. And after that was said, according to Shelby I began speaking Gaelic thickly. I remember fighting Arthur because I wanted...desired...yearned for my cell phone to call someone. I fought HARD, and elbowed Arthur in the balls, on accident, and smacked Kitty, on accident. I got pinned down quickly, but I fought and fought, I never made it, but I tried. Then I guess the depression hit so hard and OLD memories of the past came back and I began to talk about Daniel and Derrick, and I guess I wanted my knife.

""I have to end it! I can't do this anymore!! I NEED my knife!""

I fought Arthur and he just clung to me, and Shelby and Nikki pinned my hands down and Kitty took hold of my legs. According to Arthur, I was impressively strong for a drunk person, and yet while I'm sober, I hold back everything. I don't remember if anything magically happened, but eventually I curled into Arthur's lap and just sobbed until I fell asleep.

Then I remember sitting up quickly and begging for the trash can. Kitty held my hair back, Arthur held me up steadily, and I was puking all the alcohol up. Kitty tried to feed me water forcefully and I told her ""No"" and just pushed them away and threw up on my own. Nikki got sick before I did, and was passed out twenty feet away with Shelby. Eventually Kitty told me to calm down once I settled between Arthur's legs and laid my head on his chest.

""Sing for us, Ashley. Let Arthur hear that pretty voice sing,"" Kitty said smiling, wiping my mouth with a towel.

I began to sing ""Before I'm Dead"" by Kidney Thieves and my voice actually sounded in tune. I began to sing ""Ghost of You"" by My Chemical Romance when it came on and started singing something in Gaelic apparently, but I don't remember that. Then I remember Kitty wrapping me up in a blanket and slept in Arthur's arms for a couple of hours, but I woke up curled in a ball alone. Apparently Nikki was sober and they were all torturing Arthur sexually. I was clear headed surprisingly enough that I stood up, went to go to the bathroom and just passed by them like nothing. I felt numb afterwards and just wanted to get my jeans on. Apparently getting drunk in a skirt is a bad idea. Kitty helped me get dressed and we went to get something to eat because we all felt tired, except Nikki and I felt like shit, mostly myself. I was freezing because I left home without grabbing a jacket.

Arthur and I created this strong bond throughout the night and when I hugged him good-bye, he clung to me so tight that I felt chills run through me. I felt this urge not to let go and follow him home, but I had work to go to and it was almost eight in the morning. Thank the goddess for toothbrushes, toothpaste, clean clothes, and perfume and a hairbrush. Made it home in time and Mom was pissed the entire drive to work. I just put my headphones on and blocked her out. My head was pounding and I wanted nothing to do with her but do my work, forget the pain in my chest that got worse throughout the day and my dizziness.

Lupe, one of the women working with me, noticed that I looked pale, motherly instincts kicked in, and she handed me an apple. I'm like her daughter, I guess, because she treats me like a mother would, and after I ate it, I felt better. Pierre apparently has a crush on me, and he's pretty HOT himself. But when I got home after getting a free sweater and finding out that my friend hadn't passed out yet, I passed out for fourteen hours and didn't awaken until eight this morning. So...bully for me.

Now I'm just tired and am going to bed after I read the introduction to my new chapter for my English 302 class. I have at least get it to a C before the end of the class, or at least put some effort into it. Hehe, but hopefully I can convince my English 100 teacher that he shouldn't kick me out because I was sick for so long. If he does I'm so screwed and my plans will fall BIG TIME!!

Now I'm contemplating the terms of Nikki's quest to set up Arthur and I. I do like Arthur, and I felt an attraction there, but I want to see where things go with Steve right now. I'll explain that later, but hopefully things will be turning soon by next semester. I'll have my answer hopefully before then, or not. We'll see.

Oh! And I saw Mario there, I stole his hat, his cell phone and his Ipod...hehehe...I love his music on there. I was dancing to it constantly. I didn't know Journey sang ""We Built This City on Rock and Roll""...weird. I always loved that song. And I got to hear Disturbed's new CD, I love it!! Yay!"

"event","Okay when I was fourteen years old, I was naive, stupid and very depressed with lots and lots of issues. Again...I was FOURTEEN!! I had six years of built up guilt and depression and having a boyfriend wasn't what I needed at the time exactly. But here came William into my life...thanks to Hillary Hobson...that I am thankful for.

We were together for three months, my very first relationship and we were both three years apart from each other. William had fallen in love with me and being so young I got really scared and I ran. Naomi reccommended that I write a letter and when I did, she agreed to give it to him, but it took three weeks to get to him. And in that apparent time, EVERYONE read the letter!!! He was pissed and so was I.

A coward, that's what I am, because look how I treated Mike!! My beloved Michael, oh god! History repeats itself so often. But not too long ago Christina and I began talking again and we got together with William as well, since they are dating. Have been for three years. And when that began it broke my heart in two. I tried to break them up, but I failed and grew up, falling for Terry Beyak of course...hahaha.

But for three years William and I didn't see or speak to each other except very few occurances. It hurt me deeply, but seeing them together was worse, no matter who I had, it always did. But apparently being apart and never speaking hurt William too. On Halloween, he said that I am one of the very most important person to him and when he said that I felt my heart jump. I was speechless and all I could say was ""thank you, you're very important to me too."" Even at 3:45 AM he drove me home and walked me to my door.

William said that he is so happy that we are friends again, that we don't even need Christina to hang out and talk, since there are things we talk about that she doesn't even know about. Or maybe she does, but I don't know. I still remember from last night when William hugged me so tight and we almost kissed, if I hadn't moved my head and turned to hug him properly. He's scared of life, unsure of what he wants, and I told him it will get easier, just at a heavy price. He has my cell number and knows he can call me anytime. I told him that my door is always open to him, and knowing that we're friends again makes me feel much better.

He so protective of me still. Eric called me last night and William answered my cell phone. He didn't want me to have to talk shop with another guy while I'm in my friends' presence, so it was all good for me. I still love him, but its different now. He will always, ALWAYS mean more to me than Steve ever will...because he was my first boyfriend and I was his first girlfriend, and that holds my heart gently in his hands."

"event","Well last night, I got my answer to the entry that NiNi* helped give me courage to post. But it was the poem that really did it, that got him to answer. Mike was a bit snotty about the poem, but can I blame him?

I was hoping he would give me a second chance, another chance to prove I'm worth his love, but he rejected me and mine. I will honestly admit, that as he was saying it, I was sobbing into my pillow. I can't let my Mom know that my love went to someone other than Steve, and hearing me cry would probably only give me more trouble than its worth. Thank you Neen for talking to me, you saved me from wallowing in my deep sadness after he logged off.

I was wondering if Mike was shocked or glad that I told him ""I love you"" after he said ""Love ya"" when he was going to leave, because he said ""took you a year to say that to me."" I know it did, but one of the main reasons I left was I was afraid of myself. I didn't know these feelings inside my heart, I didn't understand what they meant until I started dreaming about Mike again three months ago. Also I was really ""Weird"" as he calls me and means it, but I believe I was immature in high school, and since I've graduated I have matured. I have had to deal with things that if I was surrounded around the ones that I loved and returned it, I could've handled better, but oh well, you get stronger every day. I always believed guys were meant to destroy women in every way possible, to deceive us in ways unimaginable, so I cut off from love, and that was my mistake.

Because the second I saw Mike, I was hooked. He owned my heart and soul and body if he wanted right then. But I couldn't believe when he said that saving my virginity was a turn off. I hold my only value very high, and that is purity to the one I marry. Its my only gift to my future husband, he being my first in every way. I was hoping that Mike would have been it, but I guess my destiny isn't with him. I'm not even sure my journey is with Steve either. I have been so confused lately. Crying constantly over a guy that took my heart and put it in a blender. I told Mike that if I'm worth the wait, as the guy thinks I am, then he's worth the fight as I am to him. Maybe he thinks I'm foolish for believing that, but that's his loss then.

Especially since the only reason he wanted to get back together with me because of my fantasies with him and I together. He does want me back...for all the wrong reasons. He says that he stopped carring after he heard about Steve and I together, and that he wants us to be together, but he doesn't feel the same way for me like he did before. I can understand, since we are officially living in this world, not in high school where drama is meant to be. I've changed, as he has, and I wish he knew how much I have changed. Physically and mentally and emotionally and spiritually. But he'll never know, because he never wants to see me.

How are we supposed to see if we have that connection anymore if we aren't around each other? But it is his decision, I'll just be ""living"" and loving Steve since there isn't much left for me now."

"event","Mike doesn't get it that I've been in love with him since I saw him walk into Mr. Brennan's government class. He thinks Steve is the love of my life, if only he knew. I don't think he even read the entry I wrote for him. He even said that he might have given me a second chance if I just asked him to come back to me.

Guys are complicated.

I talked to Steve about three or more days ago and I was talking about how I don't know how much more I can stand. How I was ready to give up, that whenever we're together its great! But when he leaves, its like breaking up and getting back together a few weeks later. Apparently he was crying. CRYING! Steve never cries! He hasn't cried for two years where I cry myself to sleep every night and have since Mike and I said good bye, or else I can't get to sleep.

I was getting everything off my chest, telling Steve that it hurts me deeply that when we talk on line, he's playing World of Warcraft when he IM's me and he never answers back or when we're on the phone and he's really distracted. When we talk it means so much to me, but it breaks my heart when he treats me badly. Now he asks me if its all right if he does something or goes somewhere when we're talking. What am I? His mother?!

And apparently his father and everyone else expects him to screw up and fuck everything up. And I guess I'm the only good thing in his life. I almost just ended our relationship right then and there, but if I did and Mike doesn't care, I'll be alone. Granted I'd rather be loved miles away, than ignored ten feet away. But when I was about to tell him that I was leaving him because just being apart and how I've felt up there around his friends and when he's around mine just breaks me down, he tells me that he's taking a semester off next semester. I was so shocked and I asked him why. And I guess he's always failing at least one or two classes, and he needs to refocus and wants to move down here to Santa Rosa and get a job to live near me.

I don't know how I feel about that. I'm partially excited and partially not. What if Mike says he wants me back and I end the relationship? Steve will be stuck in this town where I'm frequented daily. My friends are everywhere, surely to spot him and talk to him. Oh things are so complicated.

I kept my mouth shut about breaking it off with him, because if Mike just hurts me and tells me no, then I'll have Steve and attempt to give Steve all my love like before. But why does my heart break at that idea? Why can't I silence these voices in my head screaming for an answer? I want silence! I want to wallow in my pain and ignorance and stupidity, so why won't they leave me alone?

Why can't I get the answers that I need so my heart can attempt to mend on its own?"

"event","Tonight, just recently, I read NiNi* entry about her father, and it made my eyes tear up, because it gave me flashbacks of Tony. My step-father. It gave me the memories of when we lived next door and he would destroy my hopes on ever finding a boyfriend, ever marrying, or ever having real friends.

Tonight, during dinner, he was going off on me about chicken. CHICKEN!! Then I got up and started clearing the table, like I always do and Mom went to get his laundry for him. That makes me cringe that she does his laundry as well as her and I doing our own. Why can't he do his own? He has the nerve to call me lazy and irresponsible when he doesn't even do his own laundry. He frustrates me more than he should, since I am eighteen, I don't need my Mom to stand up for me, and I can finally have a say. But even my mother treats me like I'm two. She gets shocked when I tell her my age, and that I have a say like she does and don't need her to tell me to shut up when I'm defending myself.

I'm always defending my mother, since she believes that a wife just sits back and allows her husband to treat her anyway he wants to. After I was abused by men too many years in one way or another, my once-removed-stepbrother, my father, my stepfather, I don't ever want someone to think I'll be Susie Homemaker, a home-maker wife that cooks, cleans, and raises the kids. But I followed them upstairs, because Mom was even going to fold his clothes for him as well! He fondles my mother in front of me in a joking matter, when you should do that in private, and it's supposed to be an intimate thing, not a joke! I told Tony to stop treating my mother that way or I would kick his ass. ""You mean kiss my ass, right Ash?"" No...kick your sorry ass! I told him. I wanted to talk to my mother, and Tony started making a stupid comment about the dishes. I asked Mom if she wanted me to put the string beans in a pirex bowl, and Tony was using his hands to show me the size, when I knew exactly what they were. ""What do you think I am...stupid?!"" I asked Tony. And the bastard nodded his head.

I reacted before I thought. I growled. I acted like a little girl, calling for my Mom to stand up for me, and she didn't, so I growled at her. Tony called Mom a slave because I wouldn't go downstairs immediately to do the dishes. I wanted to go back next door and go home, into my room where I'm safe. But when he made that comment, I exploded on him. ""How dare you call her a slave! She's nowhere near that! She does so much for you without making a sound that you don't even appreciate her, you jerk!"" Mom yelled at me to shut up and I got pissed because I was defending myself and her as well. So I walked downstairs, and did the dishes. Mom came downstairs and tried to get me to let her do them and I growled ""Back away from me, Mom. Don't talk to me right now...I mean it."" She had no idea what I was being ""crabby"" about. I wanted to scream, cry, and tell her to open her eyes that we don't need this again. My mind was reeling over the memories that were coming back to me just standing there, doing the dishes.

I told her that I was eighteen, I had a voice, I didn't need her to stand up for me, and if she ever would, to fucking pay attention. ""I didn't know anything was happening, Ashley.""

""Of course not! You were too busy doing his laundry.""

I was angry, I was bitter, and I didn't care. She left me hanging there like a wounded, caged wolf like she did two years ago, and after all the counseling I went through, I'm not doing it again. I wanted to pack my bag, leave for the night, go somewhere, anywhere! I wanted to be held while I cried. I wanted someone to make my pain disappear, like a lover does. Mom came up to my room later and said that she talked to Tony about what happened, and that he wasn't even aware that he did something to make me mad. Of course not! The alcoholic was downing screw drivers and wine tonight. Why would he think he did anything wrong?

It was hard for me to read NiNi* entry because it broke my heart that someone so kind and sweet and angelic was being yelled at or made cry tears that aren't happiness or in pleasure. I don't understand why our parents try and control our actions, or why my mother has to be so blind even still. At least NiNi* has someone to talk to, my mother rejects my opinions, so I'm stuck with myself or the comfort of my journal here. And the first time in five months, I was begging myself to call up Mike and ask for some company. I just needed someone to make these memories stop, because I live next door to the same man that made me attempt suicide TWICE and fail. Apparently I didn't mix the drug properly, but I have the right ones now. I still have the access to the liquor, codine, my own medicine Stratterra, Advils, Excedrine, I have it all.

So maybe I should just up my move sooner, but fiancially I can't. I don't have the money to move at this moment. Goddess! I could really use a strong drink right now. Just something to numb these memories. I feel like curling into a ball, holding myself, and crying again. NiNi's* entry had a bit of bringing them back, but it was 98% because of Tony treating me like that again. How much more blood of mine needs to be spilt for my mother realize that we need to get away from him? How much more will he do to me? Why didn't I just object to this move in the first place?

<i>I'll get on my knees in front of you for peace and silence. I'll get on my knees and cry for your love. I'll beg and plead for just your touch upon my face. I love you! But you hate me...so I understand why you're gone. How much more suffering will this childe endure?</i>"

"event","I know I didn't write it in here yesterday, but I was in too much shock to do so. On my way home from hanging out with my new found crush Erik, I nearly got hit by a gray van. I don't mean that I happened to play frogger like most of you know I do on Mendo, but this time I had the right-of-way.

The light turned green, the sign said I could walk, and the second I was about to do so, a van brushed right out in front of me. I froze! I couldn't move until I fell to the ground, shaking, sobbing. A man in a car that watched the entire thing pulled over, ran over to me, and checked to see if I was all right. All I could do was grab hold of him and cry. But when I told my Mom what happened, she held onto me tightly. She has still been trying to grasp the idea that I'm safe after I was almost taken a couple months ago.

The only reason I'm not dead right now is something/someone held onto me, not letting me go, before that van ran the red light and drove in front of me and tons of other drivers. No, the cops were not called, as far as I know. I went home as soon as I could walk and dry my tears. Tonight, as I am writing this, Steve knows about the accident, so I hope he doesn't get too worried about it. There's nothing he can do...so whoop-dee-doo if I did get hit. I know a few people I could name right now that wouldn't care that I died.

*sighs* I'm going to go and lie down. I just wish Death would just fucking take me now and stop playing stupid games with me."

"event","I posted the entry on Dark Hunter like NiNi* suggested, and normally I get responses from people, but when it comes to the one I need a response from, some sort of reaction, nothing! Just the coldness of nothing that everyday seems to break my heart. I wonder if Mike knew about my plans to move up north if everything goes south?

Steve had asked me to move in with him and I planned on it, but I couldn't until I told Mike how I've fallen in love with him since we met and see his reaction. If Mike feels the same towards me and gives me a second chance, I'll stay down here, leave Steve and pursue my love that was meant to be. But if he breaks my heart, I will retreat from Santa Rosa for good, until I have a good reason to come home. I'll send emails and letters, but why come back to this town where I know the location of where my love lays his head at night? Life can be cruel sometimes.

Everyday at the JC I have become gittery and paranoid. Looking everywhere to make sure that I don't run into Mike, because what if he breaks my heart in person, that would leave his words from his voice in my head and I'll hear them forever. And I know for a fact that I will cry every night to sleep if I heard his voice be cruel to me. After knowing Mike, I've become so much more sensitive than I have ever been accostumed to and I hate it! I hate that my heart breaks never hearing his voice, seeing his smile, feeling his touch, or that we're apart. I hate that my dreams cry out to be loved by him and I am, for a moment in my dreams, I'm in his arms again. He's kissing me tenderly, telling me he loves me, caressing me, Oohh! I can't do this again!

I'm a fool, I know this! NiNi* knows that I call myself a fool. Even before I knew Mike's name, I was always watching him in government class, CW's confirmed that, and that's because I was instantly attracted, but too scared to step up to the plate and play the game. I need to stop listening to this sad sappy songs about a lover going away, and they're begging for them to come back. It's making me depressed, and I have to make Mike think I'm not shedding a tear, even though every night, I sit on the roof begging the moon goddess for a second chance.

Why can't I get anything right? Please, someone...anyone! I just want some straight answers! Even if he doesn't love me anymore, I'll back away, I give my word and soul on it, but I want to know. God! It's killing me not knowing. Why must I let myself fall for someone like this, leave them for what could be something great, but yearn for them anyways? I know the pain of losing them is a lot worse than anything in the world, so why can't I stop crying out for an answer?"

"event","Agonizing two days so far out of the five I need to go before I write anything more on Dark Hunter. I feel like Aloctera again, hell...maybe I'll change my name to Aloctera and become her officially. Sasha would be pissed, but I don't care! He wouldn't even smile for me, why should it matter?!

Two days since I wrote that update on Dark Hunter confessing my feelings with the help of my beloved and gorgeous sexy goddess NiNi* Without telling her, or letting her know about this journal, I wouldn't have had the nerve to do anything. I would have just sat here on this journal, and wonder about Mike and my feelings for him. I mean, it's bad enough that this last Saturday with Steve here, I kept thinking about Mike, whenever I had a moment to think, I was thinking about him.

John Parr's song ""St. Elmo's Fire(soundtrack theme)"" came on Comcast and I was making chocolate chip cookies with Steve. We were just finishing up when I heard it. I finished my tray, and ran out in the living room to dance. But in my mind I was thinking ""I'll dance for Mike, even if he can't see me, I'll still dance like I did before."" I put all my heart into the dance, even though Steve got to see it, I dance more for Mike.

It hurt even more that night when Steve was lying next to me, sleeping, he never once turned towards me to hold me. Sometimes when your lover sleeps and someone's next to you, you instinctively reach out and wrap your arms around their waists and hold them close. Well, he doesn't just reach out and hold me, not even in his sleep. I sat up that night, just watching him sleep, and I wrapped my arms around myself. If he won't hold me, even in his sleep, then maybe I'll find someone who will. Even if it was just some guy off the street, at least for a moment someone might hold me.

Sure we had fun making cookies, he says he had a blast with me, and I had fun too, but it's only fun and a blast when we're together. I've told him that it's very hard on my heart to see him for a day or two and then have him leave me like that. It's like being dumped and going back to the guy. He says ""It'll be easier when we're living together and we see each other everyday."" And I wasn't so sure. Dating is supposed to figuring out who the person is, and whether you want to spend the rest of your life with them. Not live hours apart, see each other what? Two to three weeks to a month for a day or two? And I can't keep denying myself of the love I had broken and want to so badly rekindle.

Goddess damnit! I want to be held! I want to be kissed awaken in the morning by the one lying next to me. I want to be given a flower just because. I want to be shown that someone loves me. I want to be loved and protected while being wrapped in their arms. I want to openly love someone by hugging them, kissing them and doing whatever I wish to them. I want to be noticed by their friends and family and people around us that I'm theirs and not feel invisible.

But...I had that with Mike. I lost that. I lost my chance. So why am I crying over him? Why must I shed a tear for a guy that is trying to hurt his best friend by steal the girlfriend? But what is sad is that while dating Mike, he told me that he's seen Madi naked, full-bodied naked before. Goddess...I wish I knew the truth. My heart is breaking with each day going by. I'm backing away like NiNi* said, but my dream last night told me Mike will just break my heart. He'll just comment and say ""I don't love you anymore. I found someone better.""

But then after that, I dreamt that Mike came to my apartment here on Edwards Avenue, knocked on my door, and when I opened it he had a single red rose in his hands. He handed it to me and smiled saying ""I love you, Ashley. Leave Steve, come back to me, I promise to never let you feel lonely like he does."" And I smiled, my heart beating wildly and I kissed him lovingly. And I told him ""I love you too. And I will be yours again.""

So I don't know anymore! I haven't even cried that Steve is gone, because he left in the morning while I was out the door and off to work. My Aunt Diane wouldn't even let me have five minutes to say good bye to him. Guess we can't get what we want."

"event","Today, I was walking through the parking lot near the Tauzer Gym and before I hit the parking, I saw a boy on a skate board that I didn't much attention to until I looked up and guess who? Mike!!

Now don't get me wrong, I was excited to see him but also frightened, nervous, and happy! But before I could act shocked, I gave him the biggest, most genuine smiles of smiles. I've never done that for Steve, I had realized that. He smiled at me, and that hurt because he rode on by on the board after we exchanged hello's. I took a triple take, looking back and my body got the ""good"" shivers. ;-)

He had recently gotten a haircut, that I could tell. He wore green shorts and this white shirt that complimented him nicely. I could tell that the smile was genuine as well, and not a fake acting smile. But that was it! He just rode on by like Sasha did, acting like I was just another person on the street that passed their lives like a fly. I would rather have a cold shoulder glare than a smile that to this day makes my heart go *pitter-patter*.

At first I was laughing, because I gittery after seeing him, but I was laughing to get my heart beating again. Because when I first saw him, yes, he made my heart stop! He made it skip beats through those five seconds. It felt like minutes, but it wasn't until it started breaking that it started bothering me. I got a sharp physical pain in my heart and an emotional pain as well. My hand flew to my mouth, blocking my cries, as I tried to control my body, stopping it from curling into a ball and sobbing until the earth crumbled.

My heart seeing him was screaming ""I love you Mike! Forgive us! Come back to us!"" While my mind was saying ""Remember, he's forgotten us, he's moved on."" I found a corner near the high school by a house where I stayed for a while and sobbed. Curled in a ball, sobbing from the pain that lerched in my chest, demanding to be screamed out. I wanted to yell out his name when he left, beg him to come back and end this torment I put us both through, but I couldn't.

When I bought my diary <i>Dirty Secrets</i> it was meant to put my secrets on paper about Mike, so incase I get NiNi* to have us get a three-some date, I can leave it open, where my darkest secrets and fantasies are contained. Maybe if he read them, near that looking at our pictures of us together breaks my heart uncontrollably, maybe he'd forgive me and give me a second chance.

A second chance? Do I deserve one? What about Steve? I feel myself drifting from Steve because of our distance, so what can I do? I need someone here daily, I need a lover. But when I think the word ""lover,"" ""boyfriend,"" and ""forever"" Mike comes to my mind immediately. My body remembers him, my memory does, and definitely so does my heart. It remembers the way he would make my pulse pound wildly when he would walk towards me, the way he would play with my ponytail when he wanted my attention, or the he would smile and kiss me, wanting another one more and more.

Okay, I'm going to go and do some crunches on my bedroom floor, some jumping jacks, push-ups, dance moves, and high kicks and punches to get into shape. I've got a costume that shows off my legs and body, and if I'm going out to anywhere for Halloween to show it off, hopefully to run into Mike and jump his ""pulse"" then I've got to look GOOD."

"event","I don't know why long distant relationships don't work. Lately I've just been really confused about my own relationship. I know he's just four hours away, not states or countries, but he's not here with me when I need him. At night I hold my pillow, missing him, and I hate being in that depressed state, since this wolf isn't allowed out of the house too long without fighting for it.

It's really hard to watch couples together, and I wanting that so desparately to hold his hand every day, kiss Steve, waking up with him beside me, etc. I want to be held, desired, and ravished, but when your lover is far away, how can you feel wanted? Sure there's the Internet to chat to, but these machines are impersonal, you can't tell the tone of the speakers voice, their emotions in their eyes, or body movement. The phone is better, but you still can't see their face, but it helps to say things that are important so you only have to hear their voice. The visits are hard, because eventually Steve will leave, and it breaks my heart to watch him or not watch him, leave.

I miss having a boyfriend here that I'd see all the time, who knew how to romance me, wanted to be with me and comfort me when I cry. But instead at night, I cry in the corner alone. Mom says I've been a really sad person, down all the time, and she's right, I have been. There's no one for me to talk to around here that wouldn't criticize me, or tell me to grow up or to deal with it. The ones I talk to are gone, or aren't speaking to me. But...I need to be held, to be kissed, to go to sleep with someone by my side and have them there when I awake.

When I'm with Steve, sometimes it's all worth it, being apart. But in other times, it makes it harder. You can't go out on dates or be together for special occasions like you want to. When something bad happens and you need comfort, there's no one there to protect you. No one to come over quickly and make it all better. Where the best friend? Where's the lover? No where. 

Lately, I haven't the faintest idea what to do with my heart. One part says ""Steve! He's the one! Wait for him! We'll be there soon!"" But the other side of my heart is screaming ""But so is Mike! We fell in love with him too! Remember how it felt when he kissed us! How special we felt even standing beside him.""

"event","Oh man, this would be the hardest entry for me. I knew that I would dedicate an entry to him, but I hate doing it while crying. I guess it's because everytime I think about him, I regret breaking his heart, breaking our relationship, and never telling him how I truly feel.

It was the hardest thing in the world for me to write that letter to Mike. I had a choice, Mike or Steve, because if I didn't make a choice Shelby and Nikki would do it for me. Either way, myself and one of the boys would end up crying. It was hard for me to write every word on that paper, to make Mike cry a single tear or be scared that I was going to kill myself and I wouldn't let him talk to me. He must hate me, even today, he must despise me.

I was his first girlfriend, but he was the first real boyfriend in three years for me. Yeah I fell in love with Steve while at the faire only a month before meeting Mike, but he really opened up my heart to love. Mike was the first person I kissed, the first person I learned how to kiss from and make out with. I remember the first time he came over to the apartment on Marlow Road and I got butterflies. I was so anxious, excited, worried, nervous, and happy. Alone with my boyfriend(now ex), a teenage girl was jumping up and down inside of me when he knocked on the door.

When he told me he wanted to say he loved me, those scary three little words, I was frightened and HAPPY at the time, because I too felt the same way for him. I fell in love with him. Everytime we got off the phone, or said good-bye, I wanted to tell it to him, but something in me stopped me in my tracks.

First it was the fear that Derrick was coming back, because he told me he was, and then there was Steve to consider. But at that time Steve wasn't even mine to begin with. He wasn't mine until February, and my time with Mike, I wasn't thinking of Steve, I was loving Mike. Mean to Steve now, when I think about it, but I was in love, and it broke my heart into a million pieces when Mike asked me if I wanted a ride home and a chance for us to talk. While in that car I wanted to reach over, grab his hand, interlace his fingers with mine, and kiss his cheek. I wanted to steam up his windows like we used to do, feel each other up, and be left breathing heavily, but I'll never be able to do that anymore, Mike would never let me near me.

Then we fell asleep in his car, and when I awoke, I didn't want to leave. I wanted to continue sleeping with him by my side, safe with him. It was strange. He kept me safe, and he was dangerous to me, mysterious, and crazy all at once. He could romance you until you were breathless and weak in the knees before you realized what happened to you. But then he would surprise you and whip your world around in a circle with his spirit and his generosity.

Walking me to my door, and asking for our last kiss destroyed my heart and soul. When we kissed I wanted to grab him, throw him into the apartment and do all the things my fantasies and dreams at night wanted to do to him. I wanted to cry when his lips touched mine, but I had to be strong. But ever since, he walks by me like I'm no one, like Sasha does today too. He doesn't call to hang out, he never answered my emails, nothing.

I was for sure thinking Mike hated me, that he would delete me from my life, until I found out he's been checking up on me. Sometimes I enjoy writing like this in this journal, knowing that Mike could access this entry if he wanted, but he never would. He wouldn't put two and two together that Aloctera is me, he wouldn't know my favorite character's name, except Dark Hunter. Sometimes I day dream Mike shows up at my apartment here, tells me he loves me, and that he wants me to leave Steve and come back to him. I would in a heartbeat if he did that. Mike gave me that romance I dreamed of, fantasized about, he always got me hot and bothered when we kissed, or when he would hold my hand in government class or play with my hair.

Alas, Michael Wong hates me, I can feel it, so why do I miss his touch, his heart beating against mine, his kiss, his company, etc?"

"event","I went out today to be with my guys, and what a surprise, my mother has a problem with it! I never get out to be with my friends. I get so lonely. And when I get lonely, depression seems to set in to my little brain and I think bad thoughts. But it was nice to see Shelby, Nikki, Kitty, CW and James(Uncle Mike). I missed them all so much. I wanted to cry, because that was how much I wanted to just stay with them. Then we went to the high school.

I had to return things to Lisa and get my CD from Sasha, but when I saw Sasha, my heart broke. He didn't want anything to do with me! I had to ask for a hug instead of him giving me one automatically. CW said that he saw me hurt because of how he was treating me, and felt bad for me. I wanted to stroke his cheek, kiss his lips and whisper ""I love you"" in his ear, but I couldn't feel his heart anymore. I just felt a shell. When we left, because we got caught on campus, I looked back at Sasha and wanted to run back and kiss him, because it hurt me so to leave him, but he didn't watch me leave. I doubt he even cared!

Then we all met up with Uncle Mike at the downtown mall where we had lunch and went to FYE and Hot Topic. It was nice to shop for a Halloween costume, and I had money, so I wanted to find a sexy costume for once. I wanted to be a police officer, and there was a perfect outfit, but it was $35 plus tax. I almost bought it, but I wanted to see if I could find something cheaper. We went to two other places, we found sexy costumes, but nothing that would be nice for me. I wanted something to wear for Steve, but I didn't find anything sexy enough.

But after Kitty, Nikki and Shelby left, and after the girls and I all crowded on my bed, Uncle Mike and CW and I sat at Coddingtown for a bit...just relaxing and talking. CW asked if I wanted to come to his apartment to hang out with him and Uncle Mike, I wanted to see where he lived to get an idea where he lived, so I called Mom. She flipped that I wasn't home. My leash seems to get tighter and tighter each day. She wanted me home before she got there, but I didn't care.

I hung up and stayed there to hang with my friends. I don't care what she says, I never see my guys so I was milking it for all its worth. Eventually I went home, the guys walked me home, and I went to tell Mom about my day. I told her about the costume, but she stood there not saying anything when I mentioned the costume, just like how Steve did that to me as well. I wanted her to be apart of what I did today and she acted like it didn't matter. Halloween doesn't matter to her, but it does to me. It's my favorite holiday, and apparently it's only meant for kids, but that's a lie! It's for everyone who remembers the old ways, the ways when the pagans ruled the holidays, and magik was known.

I was just pissed at Steve because I was talking to him after he called me back, and he wouldn't talk to me. He didn't do anything but hang around the house with his friends and didn't get any of his work done that he should have done. Then he sounds like something's wrong and doesn't even mention his opinion to me about my costume ideas or my day. I felt hurt, so I told him that since he's sooo busy, I'll just talk to him later. He said ""Well Mike's coming over, and I just wanted to call and tell you I got the messages and that I love you."" And that's when I said ""Fine. I'll talk to you later. Bye."" Click."

"event","I finally got the guts to talk to my old friend Christina Malley. We have so much to catch up on, but what can I tell her? That the sisters are still around and that they never really left? Or the fact that my boyfriend is just like hers?

Then I mentioned Derrick coming back, him commenting on my other livejournal, but she flipped out. She doesn't want to deal with him, and I understand. My dreams have shown him returning for me, and she thinks he'll come after her again as well, but I'm not sure anymore. I told her of my dreams of being pregnant, ripping my claws into a young woman and lapping her blood up with my tongue from my fingertips. Gross to some, but the sight of blood has always made me hungry.

She thinks that maybe the father is a werewolf, which I have contemplated many times. I never told Steve of my thoughts about my dreams, but only to Christina. But does that mean that Steve will not be the father, or is he? Just so much confusion, so many theories she wants to try out. And she wants out of the magik business. It's going to literally kill her. But Will is being so persistant about this business. Wanting more answers, while I am being patient and waiting for the answers to come. Chris is only trying to protect us both, but there's only so much she can take of persistance.

It's still hard to hear about Will giving her a ring for their third-year annaversary. My first boyfriend, her forever lover. It's something I've learned to accept, just haven't really gotten used to. I love Christina so as long as she's happy, then I'm happy. I can't wait till tomorrow to finally see her, to smell her wonderous scent, to see her smile, and to hear her voice."

"event","I miss my other half...Steve Altemus. When he left Sunday night to go back up to Humboldt, or McKinleyville, I started crying. I know, a warrior crying over a lover leaving. How pathetic. But whenever he's with me, I feel complete. Happy. Excited. Like I could dance in the middle of the street, shout to the entire world ""I'M IN LOVE!!""

But when he leaves, I feel like my heart is ripping in half. It breaks every single time. I cry every time, and I know it hurts him to see me cry. It takes every ounce of strength in me just to walk away from his car when he's leaving, to go through the doorway, and close the door. Hearing his car pull away tears my soul to pieces. I can feel her screaming ""Run out there you fool! Bring him back! We need him!"" I clench my hands into fists, shutting out the voice and go into the livingroom where I collapsed to my knees sobbing. My mother hates how badly it hurts me to say good-bye to him.

My father called after Steve left and I cried to him. Dad, for once, didn't give me a lecture about being stronger. About getting my emotions under control. He just let me cry, until I was better, and then calmed me down a bit to just talk to me. Mom made me comfort food and a root beer float. It was a nice treat, but when she told me to come downstairs for a minute, I was praying Steve would be there, and you know what? He wasn't.

He did leave. He says it's hard on him too to leave me, but he never shows it. He doesn't cry to show me any emotion that he's sad we're parting. Granted his coming back in two weeks, but it's the fact we part. I knew the day we met that my heart and soul belonged to him the INSTANT we met. I guess the old cliche of ""love at first sight"" fits perfectly. But he doesn't really know what he's getting into. He says that he wants to marry me one day, have a family, etc. But can I provide a family for him, let alone myself? What about the war? What about Derrick?

My heart breaks everytime we talk on the phone, because knowing he's not here beside me hurts too much. And when we're AIMing each other, it takes so long for him to answer me back because he's raiding in World of Warcraft. If he's so busy with that game, he shouldn't talk to me, because I drop everything just to talk to him. And I yearn for those conversations so badly. I love him so much, I miss him desperately, but sometimes I just want to tell him my thoughts and secrets that I hold inside of me. I doubt he'd understand them, but I still miss him.

I miss my other half of my heart, I miss my lover."

"event","I went to SRHS today after leaving my Introduction to the Criminal Justice class and I was looking forward to seeing Sasha and Lisa. But when I got there I was welcomed by many of the kids there except...Sasha. Lisa was home sick and I wanted to check on her, but decided not to.

Sasha acted like I was nobody. Just someone that showed up. He wouldn't even smile for me. God damn it!! Doesn't he see that I love him so much?!?! I wanted to get on my hands and knees, beg for his, Tekenthis' and Myrial's forgiveness for breaking their hearts. I wanted to cry and run away from his judging eyes. Those eyes couldn't possibly see the pain I was feeling inside of me.

Why is the world so cruel to me? Not letting me to love Sasha? Because it's unholy to love someone in a girl's body? I don't care!! I just wanted to kiss him like I wanted to do last year at prom. I wanted to ravish him and show him how badly I missed him and loved him. But damn it! He just walked away from me, not wanting to spend very much time with me at all. I was lucky to even get a hug from him.

That pissed me off a bit when I walked him to his class and reached out for a hug and I got it, but he tried to move away so quickly. But I wanted more time to talk, to be in his presence, to smell his addicting scent. Damn it, Sasha! Why must you condemn me to this cold shadow of a world where you won't even smile upon me?

Tekenthis wouldn't even smile for me. Myrial won't speak to me, it's all my fault. What was I to do? I had a boyfriend at that time, someone I fell in love with, even though I fell in love with Sasha in my junior year of high school. I wonder if Sasha even knows how badly my heart was breaking at the sight of his blue eyes, hearing the sound of his voice, or watching his body move towards me. Probably not...damn him. Damn him!"

"event","I am so foolish for thinking that that demon would ever come back for me to love me. I got wrapped up in his words, his promises of eternal love, but instead all he did was disappear without a good bye, a letter, or a kiss. It broke my heart when he left me, not dumping me, just...left. Yes, I was stupid, I still have some of his emails to me, calling me his love, how I will hear his voice, and he will finally be able to love me openly. He never will. He loves Christina too much, I am just second to her, I am below the food chain compared to her. She is a goddess and I am a lowly warrior.

But what is more foolish is that I have a lover of my own, Steve Altemus, and I still cry out to Derrick in the middle of the night. I still pray for his safety, listen for his voice in the wind, and try to bring him own with my spirit. I am so stupid! Wanting something I will never have! A foolish human emotion, and that is something that must be rid of.

But why cannot I stop thinking about this demon? Why cannot I move on without thinking he will one day show up, holding out his hand, wanting me to be with him? I keep praying I will see his screen name pop up and my heart will thump wildily, hoping he will say ""Hi"" but he never will. He is probably dead like Christina says he should be, but I pray he is not. My heart would die if he was.

<i>""Oh Derrick, come back to me and be mine once more.""</i>"

I was so pissed that i was shaking and when I was yellin for ma to call the police i didnt even recognize my own voice.


I tried breaking up with chris a couple days ago because I never get to see him, but being the pushover that I am, he convinced me to stay with him, then he broke up with me last night becasue I ""threated"" him. We were taking a nap on the couch and I woke up and he was moaning in his sleep and i nudged him and i was like ""baby, shut up!"" and he was like ""whatttt"" and then we both stayed laying there and we were talking and he said something slick and jokingly i told him i was gonna grab him by the balls.
So he ran and told mommy and she called me bitching. How immature. fuckin pussy ass nigga. fuck em.

It bled EVERYWHERE. I could feel the blood gushing out of my face, and it was the most horrible thing in the world. blood all over the place. We soaked it up with one of emmas shirts and it was all over her blanket.
THEN when i stood up to walk to the bathroom i walked into the door frame and almost knocked myself out. turned on the water, let it run on cold and splashed some on my face...i lost a lot of blood.
lol
so, the back wasnt all the way through and i was trying to push it through and it was so painful, and it was still bleeding.
I started getting light headed and my ears started ringing soooo bad. so i leaned against the sink and tried to hold myself up. I couldnt see anything, and i felt like i was going to throw up and pass out so i laid down on the floor and lindsay brought me a wet towel and i laid on emmas floor until i felt better.
It passed in like 10-15 minutes but it was sooo scary, i thought i was going to die.

I will be working in a consumer home for special needs patients. Taking care of them, taking them to movies, shopping, parks, and doing other such fun things with them. talk about exciting! Ive been wanting to do this for about 3 years now! I cant wait. My dad said ""good, move here and maybe find a rich husband"" I started geekin really bad.

Im really excited for this weekend also. Payday tomorrow, well technically today...but yaknow, havent really slept yet so...lol. Looking for acid for a friend. Buying some nug, fruity pebbles to be exact, and im sharing my wealth with my friends, you better believe it. Maybe tyler will be able to join us? But no! he doesnt smoke. whatever.
Im not too sure about him though, i dont think i like him as much as i thought i did. Hes kinda a really big dickassdouchebag. But oddly enough i like him enough to date him? weiiiird. Im a hypocritical asshole sometimes. At least i embrace it.

I dont know if im just being a typical pothead right now, with the paranoia and shit but i feel like everyones always watching and judging me. And that people i hang out with dont really like me they just hang out with me to get me off their backs for a while. I really hate fake people. soooooo bad. And everyone here seems to be just as fake as the next. FUCK i cant wait to get out of this godforsaken town. I swear to GOD im going insane. Not like where people just arent having a good day or anything like that. I actually have some form of mental illness.

Monday was such a good day too, and it was just ruined by that. 
Oh and I found out that my best friend is going into the service too. 
=[

SO, i got really really fucked up, and around 10:30pm my mind was gone.
I was at the odyssey with lora, the one who's leaving, and she though it would be a good idea to make me walk.
well turns out it wasnt such a good idea and i threw up right as i got out the doors. Went home at 11, went straight to bed, and when i woke up i was still fucked up for a good 4 hours or more. I felt like dying at work. Then i saw him there, when he didnt need to be and my heart dropped into my stomach and i started shaking really bad. He tried talking to me and i told him not to becuase i was still hurt, but then i went and gave him a really big hug like a couple minutes after that. I know thats a really fucked up thing to do but I miss his affection so much it kills me.

After thinking for a long long time i realized that Nick did the right thing though.
Even though i was falling in love with him and it hurt me that he gave me false hopes, i realized that we make better friends than lovers. Shit just wasnt working out. He also has far too many emotional problems for me to try to deal with along with my own. so i guess its just whatever now.

He came and picked me up last night around 7 to hang out and we left my house and we were turning off my street onto university dr and we got t-boned by some dick driving a porshe. It wasnt nicks fault AT ALL, and nick got the ticket which is bullshit.
Our turn was almost fully completed, and that asshole was driving in the middle of the street. Then Nicks mom came and she was being a total bitch to him. I wanted to punch her in the mouth. So i guess Nick's grounded now for a really really long time, and he doesnt have a car anymore.

"event","""i get this weird feeling when i talk about her.
shes the number 1 person im afraid of seeng in public.
and i guess shes afraid to see me too, and isaac, and you and melissa.
i think ill always be jelous of her, or like weirded out, cuz im still all weird like loosing isaac to her, even though he doesnt talk to her...
i really wanna see what she looks like.

vegans dont die their hair colors, and dont wear alot of makeup, unless its non animal tested or doesnt use animal by products, but that shits expensive, idk if she'd buy it..i dont get it, its so not like her to look like that.
i miss how she use to be.""

not my quote...just a quote from an old friend.
Why were we talking about her?
Thats too unlike me....

Why? The last time i saw her everything was perfectly fine.
Maybe its cause she ran like a little bitch. Who knows, but i wanted to rip her fucking eyes out.
ughhhh, she makes me shutter."

I didnt just realize this now, i realized it a few months back, but it didnt sink in till a few days ago.
I have so much to be happy for and about, but im just not. I want to fall over dead, and the only time i dont have a strong passion to kill myself or everyone around me is when im high.
Not good at all.

I jsut dont understand, ive got SO much to be happy about, but thats petty little shit, but when i think about it i dont really have anything to be sad about. Its pretty lame, but i guess thats just life. right?"

"event","Im so glad its spring break now.
Ive been needing a break for a while.

This bladder infection is kicking my ass, and anything I eat or drink comes out one end or the other. All ive been drinking is cranberry juice, which is flushing my system. 
Today I tried to eat a sandwich and some chips, and I took a couple bites and thought I was going to throw up.
Like, last night I was supposed to go with Bryan to pick up jeremy from work, and I ended up puking everywhere about 20 minutes before we were supposed to leave. Im allergic to the amoxicillin I was taking to fight the infection.
Im just a hott mess.

ANYWAYS
I met this awesome guy named jeff, and he lives here in sussex. Hes really fucking hot, and we've been talking.
I think hes coming with me to get my tongue pierced on my birthday =)



I wonder what happened to emma. Any ideas?
Did I get ""punked"" If so, im kinda pissed...

I wanted to meet Ashton!"

FUCKFUCKFUCK.
I love him, and thats deffinately not good. I told him today though.
It was funny! We were saying goodbye and I said ""alright, I love ya"" he paused...and I was like ""you love me too, josh!"" and he told me he loved me and we laughed about it.
But, hes moving to Texas in a week and I was really planning on seeing him before he moved, so when he told me I started crying. We kept saying over and over again that we missed each other and it was kinda sad. I miss him so much. shit, I havent seen him in 5 months. 



I think he's afraid im going to fall in love with him again, and to be honest, I im afraid too.
Im really scared."

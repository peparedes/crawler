"event","What an amazing thing... Live journal is like a typewriter in the face of... facebook. I do believe that true art comes from the lack of convenience... and although live journal is more convenient than communicating with a typed letter to all my ""friends"" it actually feels like, after all these years, I can write... just to write. Not to vent my emotions in a 'day to day' way, or even a way that simply lacks the use of our literal mind. OMG I totally LOL'd about the BITD of some MILF that though I was FR. But in all honesty, how real have you been? I do understand that social evolution makes us uncomfortable... and that being uncomfortable is the only way we can grow beyond now (yes we can become comfortable with change), but we have to 'remember'. When it's cool to forget, we find ourselves back in the time of Hitler... or Homer... or Akhenaten. We are at a turning point. We are almost heading back out of the dark ages of man. Instead of self-centered and self-absorbed, we will begin to find self-realized, and self-socialized again. Imagine a world that allows us to regain our loss of self in the face of community. Image us building a pyramid because we value each other without a master... what a tangent... but at least on this abandoned site, these words might have a chance of actually being read.

     It's been months since my last confession. This time I've got such a list... 

   I went to prom with a minor; no sex though mr. president
   I made soap; but I'm not making bombs... I swear
   I did start an office job... I knew that would make you smile
   I have the neighbor children over while I get drunk
   I have a friend in jail... I knew that would make you smile too
   I am 25 and still not married
   I haven't washed my sheets in awhile
         and mr. president... 
                    Creed broke up...
   I know it's not cause me but, mr. president... that one made me smile a bit"

"event","Often times I wonder when delusion and misinformation really are that. I tend to have trouble being understood, but what I notice is that to most of the world I speak in riddles. Jealousy is ugly. Lack of clarity makes the waters difficult to travel. I couldn't imagine this water I'm in to be any more clear, but it's really all a matter of perspective. So here is perhaps a bit of clarity. I am being wooed and sought after by many different people for many different reasons. Some of these people have been around years, some only months, some from here, and some from there, some big, some small, some fat, some tall, you get the fucking picture. At this point I only truly have one real solid relationship and that is with 4 of the best people I know. As far a life Love goes, I'm not closing my mind or my heart. I tend to have the often unfavored dream of a wife and kids someday (so un-rockstar, fuck off) but I'm a smart kid from a broken home (oh, hold all your fuckin' tears you little papa roach cocksuckers) so I'm making no compromises. The one is the one. And I guess to add to a little of my life experience, I've already found that once, and I still believe she left because she saw my dream, so if I'm a little determined, forgive me. 

Note: This entry is a bit like a normal ""live journal"" entry. I appologize. Next time I'll have more conversations with myself."

I think I needed that comfort of the past to remind me that I can't go back. I can't go back because it's all the same. It's quick now... the way I find my confidence but I must admit the comfort sucks me in... it's been a long time on this road, and I'm gonna catch you on your big red can. I've learned a lot since the last time, devil. But I'm still afraid and not as quick as I need to be. Do you remember Mike Tyson's Punch Out? Well I'm only on the second Bald Bull, or maybe E. Honda... All's I know is that I'm getting closer and each time I die I only become stronger and more patient... I learned the math... the patterns... the quickness... the next lesson I look forward to.

"event","Today was eventful. We made a trip to Schooners of Lancaster where we discussed with the lovely Heidi the rules of the ""Battle of the Bands"" we have recently entered. It seems a bit more professional than we have been used to, not to mention we are looking to a whole new location for fans. March 21st, we will be one of three bands in the evening, only one of which will make it to the next level. The grand prize is still undetermined but I think we still have a lot of work to do before we will get to any grand level. I'm looking forward to meeting new bands, talking to like minded folks, maybe gaining a new cult member or two, but most of all I just can't wait to play again.

"event","I made a point to myself a few days ago to stop eating and sleeping so much, but my body thought it'd be a funny joke to crave those two things more than usual. Hibernation. I've been able to curb sleeping but the tiredness has been haunting me on the hour drive to work in the morn. Eating. I've been eating at least four meals a day and snacking constantly. Candy at work keeps me content. I've been trying to curb myself from the coffee without being a nazi about it, but I really do think it necessary for the self preservation that I've recently learned is driving me ... well, making me upset unnecessarily. My original idea was to stop eating and/or sleeping so much because I seem to function more productively in neglect, but most recently the torment of self preservation has come to the surface. I must think of myself as having no purpose, no obligations, no reason to live (or self preserve, anyhow). I am God without reason. I have no fear when without purpose. I am productive and I create indiscriminately. And too, in the lack of fear I find Love again in my heart. Love."

"event","Fuckin' traffic. Took me about 4 hours to get home. I did stop at Don Cucco's Mexican Restaurant. A beautiful fountain inside the place made me immediatly feel... well, thoughtful, I guess. I had a bannana-strawberry Margarita, and my usual, Pork and Chilli Verde Burritto... A La Carte. Damn fine meal. Anyhow, I think I was having, what you might call a Schizophrenic episode... which I hear can get more intense with irregular or lack of sleep. Fuckin' sleep. Voodoo... If I got you... then who the hell's got me. Maybe some other me. If I dose off and wake up sometimes and I occassionally get hints that I was interacting with others but to me it just seemed like the blink of an eye... I can only guess. I felt like pouncing on prey in the restaurant. But then I had a moment where I chose a more sophisticated approach. Now I'm still fairly sure that my mental scenerio lapses are all in my head because I still have yet to find an outcome actualized from one, but the possibilities do concern me a little. The prey in my mind was something much like me but weaker, and the sophistication lied further into a guiding role. Hmmm... Yes another interesting spill out of symbolism as life. Have I chosen this role as guide for others to follow, and if so, why is it so hard to just let them follow without being hand fed all along the way. Tomorrow's another day. I hope the fuckin' freeways not packed on my way to work. grrrrr.....

My solitary company was good and the night passed quietly, but my heart was in Arizona. I felt like fighting. I felt like tossing midgets and lifting couches with the virile tension all through me. I felt excite...able. At some point there will be a revolution and I will stand rediculously tall in front of everyone.

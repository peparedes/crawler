I'd like to thank you so very much for that potion you made for me. I'm glad to say I'm back to normal! You are a true Ravenclaw, and I owe you so much. Really, I don't know how to repay you. If there's anything I can do, let me know, even though I don't think there's truly a way to say how thankful I am.

I have enclosed a small outfit I made for your doll, however. Maybe that's a start.

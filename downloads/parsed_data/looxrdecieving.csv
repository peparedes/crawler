"event","by not going to english, but im so tired and that would require sooo much time and effort. Id rather just work a little harder and do a few extre credits to make up for it. 

So life has been pretty okay lately. Those pills the doc gave me make me really happy and i just went back and he upped the dose. Gotta love doctors :)

Boys.. are the same as always, the only difference is that right now i really dont care. Aj is really needy which is annoying haha. 
Joel is joel, im going to a movie with mike this weekend (if all goes well), steve.. is well... new subject. 

School sucks. I totally got my ass kicked by a test in biz law today. Speech will be okay i think. I got an A on the only test we've had and i participate enough so.. my only reaal concern is english.. well maybe biz law too. haha. I just need to kick it up a notch. 

J is out of the hospital. She says it was horrible and i can just imagine. I hope we can succeed in making her feel less lonely. 

My mom is being nice i guess. She is always on my ass about school and stuff. 

I had another interview at Ruba but he told me to call him if he doesnt call me within a few days so im going to call him tomorrow, because it will have been 3 days since the interview. My phone is ringing and if its ryan im gunna be pissed. He wants me to go to some thing in corona and hes been trying to get me to go for weeks!!!

It wasnt him. It was J! and we are going to the block. :) 

So ya. things are looking up. There is a bright side to every.. tunnel. Or something. I dont remember how that saying goes. My memory is shot to hell. haha. im hungry."

I cant help picturing her in whats sure to be a stark white room with a metal railed bed.. and the girl next to her babbling. Shes bound to be crying and wishing things were different, but she cant take it back now, and i kept telling her that.. what do you want to happen now? What was the point? But she doesnt have an answer. I completely get her and i think she knows that, but i wish i could do more.. but what can i really do? This is her battle.. and she has to want to win. 
Gosh now AJ broke up with A... crap. i dunno what to do.. its not my fault though, they were having problems before whatever happened happened. Joel is being disgusting. ew. the thought of someone smelling my shorts makes me sick. Why do guys do that? Noodle and i were talking about that the other day. wierd freaks, id never try to smell a guys shorts!!!"

"event","I went to the doctors yesterday and talked to him about stuff. He was new so ive never had him before, but he talked to me ALOT which was annoying, but it was nice that someone actually cares about me, even if he is paid to. He seemed to keep talking in circles, and more for his own enjoyment, but oh well. Talking is nice.  I dont know how this whole cafe ruba thing is going to work out. The girl really liked me, but i dunno about the guy. I guess i will know my tomorrow, but my hair isnt acceptable or something. Tooo bad, im a package. I dont come without my hair lol. Tonight was stupid. I had a feeling that nhu would hang out with chris instead of going to the movie so i wasnt to annoyed when it actually happened. I wish he wasnt such an ass to her. We are all so stupid, we follow guys around like little puppy dogs batting our fucking eye lashes hoping to catch their attention, even if only for a second. Then we cry when they walk right by us... and start the whole pattern over again. I wish that for once we could like someone and have them like us back on the same level. Is that ever possible? I doubt it, not as far as ive seen at least, but then again i prefer to keep my eyes closed to the whole business. Its 10:09 on a friday night and i dont even give a fuck that im home. I think i am going to start staying home more and hopefully i will get this job and that will occupy my time. I just need to make sense of things and find my place among all of this chaos. As noodle said this has been a trying week, although i dont think anyone is taking it seriously enough, but its not my family so what can i do? I shouldnt talk though, my family kind of tends to ""forget"" when i fuck up.. no one wants to face the ugly things in life. No one wants to stand up to the truth and realize that they may need some help or may to need to step up and help someone else for a change. My doc. says i need to be less selfish and try to think about what other people are going through and how they feel to. thats good advice, but first i need to figure out how i feel. I feel positive for the first time. Im going to take a hot bath and read, and then maybe i will write some more, or go to sleep."

Hes like call me sometime or IM me, and im like ""i deleted your SN and number"". i think he got mad. Then he waited a few minutes and IM'ed me again saying that he wanted to see me , so to call him, and he gave me his number. I told him that i will probably not call for a while cuz im wierd lately. He didnt understand. i didnt expect him to. To much went on today to writa all about it. Very emotional. Trang is going to be in my prayers big time. She is very lucky to have brian by her side. I know that if i went through something like what she is going through i wouldnt have anyone there for me. im going to take a hot bath now.

Mrs. Shacks class Freemont Elementry School in Long Beach. Its so wierd. Ive known her longer than anyone that i am still in touch with. Ive known chanelle and Anise longer than that but i never talk to them anymore and wouldnt consider them friends really anymore, although Devon is some what in touch with them, i could kind of care less.

Like everthing goes well for a few months whatever, and then they either get to clingy or i just get disinterested. Im really fat right now. it kinda sucks but back to my other point, who have i got to impress? hahaha. lala. i like my speech class , i like my english class, and i like my bizz law class, so school is going ok. im pretty sure ill pass all of those classes but im dropping econ. id better hurry up and do it though. cuz this is my united states of whatever. ok here are some things i need to change. um.. maybe i could learn to a little bit more self disclosing... i tend to think that my middle name is enough self disclosure for a relationship. i guess id like to be more open and emotional.. i am in my head, but the words just wont come out.. its kind of frustrating, like trying to tell someone you like them but not being able to. ya kinda like that. infact exactly that. hahahahahahaha. im so funny, and no body knows it but me. haha. wierd. ok, soo what elsse could i change. i guess i could be more social, but thats no bueno. although im not happy im my bubble i am less than willing to burst it. make sense? probably not. well lets see whats on TV shall we? cuz the celly is blowin up tonight. perhaps i will hang out with my buddies ben and jerry. they love me ever with all of my imperfections. hehe"

Crushing me and at the same time lifting this wieght off of my shoulders
Relieving this pressure.. free at last


Tonight , went to boogie with janelle. All ugly people. she wouldnt dance. cant blame her so much. everyone was dirty south and beat up from the feet up. Gunna get my hair cut soon. very stoked on that. cant leave my hair well enough alone, im going to fuck with it until im bald. no hair on girls is hot though right? riiiight. 

i just got a tall glass of water and on my way back to the comp i spilled it all over the floor. Dah well, leave that mess for someone else, although with this heat in the air it will most likely evaporate before i have a chance to slip and fall and die. 

phrase of the day: ""why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?""

So true, story of my life, but oh well , i will continue to give the milk away for free, thus never getting a boyfriend.. because.. well yooou read the phrase of the day. I just keep repeating the same pattern. Hey lets hook up even though we arnt together and then, like, you wont want to date me because why throw away bachelorhood when you can get the fucking milk for free!?!? 

well i cant sleep because i have tooo much on my mind. Im wasting my life. i need to get out. i need to get off of this damn computer for good. focus on school. forget about boys. forget about shopping. forget about my hair (riiight). maybe once i cut it i will leave it alone then i will go join a nunnery or whatever you call them and take a vow of silence. thats sounds like a jolly good time. 

I am agile
I can bend without breaking 
If i do break i bounce back with a smile ...... dashboard says something along those lines.. 

mmmy only problem is, i think im wearing thin and if i break again i might not bounce back. Im kind of tired of faking this smile. 

All of this bending is causing me to crack, with each crack i draw closer to the edge. With each fake smile my heart breaks a little more. 

I keep waiting for the sky to fall.. the heavens to crash down on me and end this misery

My mom FINALLY got the right kind of top ramen. Chicken. the only way to go. Not oriental or beef, although when im depressed and hungry at 2am.. any thing edible finds its way into my tummy. Thats why its growing so big. although maybe im pregnant. NOT. Nhu and i were talking about that though, It would be horrible. I would die. My hole isnt big enough to fit a baby through!! Ouch. Well seeing as i havnt had sex for months i dont think i am pregnant haha . UNless i am the next virgin mary.. although im not a virgin so scratch that and my name aint mary.. so perhaps im the next slutty sierra.. ya that sounds more like it :) has a nice ring to it. 

Staceys mom has got it going on. 

I want to marry chris carraba. no seriously, i dont care how tall he is.. ive fallen in love with his lyrics. I cant think of another artists that touches me in the same way... nope, no one. I think i will go dream about him

i will probably end up dreaming about something wierd and random like last night where i madeout with this kid ryan or brian or something generic like that from my class, in a pool, and scott was watching and said like ""sierra, i dont know if we are together anymore"" and then i went and sat on olivers lap. Well it doesnt look as though scott and i were together in that dream seeing as i was sluttin it up. even im my dreams im sleezy, how appropriate."

Now if i see something coming at me from within a mirror ill know that it is probably just my gaurdian angel coming to talk to me after having brought me back from the dead.. twice. 
Last night: 
*hung out with noodel and jordi and sam and nick and carrie and watched IT which was terrifically stupppid

*Saw texas chain saw massacre with Mike T.

*Went dancin at Tapas with Liz, stephanie, cheree, and vanessa. Gooodtimes had by all, all the old guys bought us kamakazee shots, which are my new fav!!! Id forgotten how much i loved them!!! 

*SLept till like 3pm then went to the gym for a while

*Hung out and drove around with Janelle for a couple hours, we went to Blockbuster but as usual we couldnt agree on anything, because i am not willing to compromise my taste toward.. lets say... CRAP. 

*Hung out with joel :)

*Went to barnes with Steve and looked at sex books haha

*Went to Harb with Joel 

*Came home and talked to joel on the phone and then finished The FACE

Gosh, dean koontz and steven king are such amazing writers. I think i prefer Steven king though. His words weave such brilliant tales and conjur up these incredibly believable images in my mind. Each line paints a picture as easy to follow as a movie and with every page of his books I am left awe-struck and jealous for such a talent. Every time i read one of his books i want to sit down and try my hand at writing a novelette, but know that i will surely fail miserably as i do at most things i attempt. I hate how i am kind of just okaaay at things. I can kinda sing, kinda draw, i am kind of okay with fashion and design kinda stuff. I guess maybe if i applied myself i could achieve... wow wierd thought. I need a glass of water. back... 
I was looking at hair magazines at barnes and nobles and realizing that there are so many amazing things that i neeeed to do with my hair. Not want!! NEED!! It needs to be longer though, so i can cut way more layers into it without getting to short. I will just have to wear it in pig tails and eventually pony tails through the akward growing stages until it reaches a desired length. I want it short on top so i can spike it and put it into a hawk but long on the sides and in the back, but not like a mullot. 
Well, maybe some what mullet-esk but not really... or something. I shouldnt have slept until three today because now i am wiiide awake and it is , hey look at the time!! three, again. twelve hours since i awoke from a really cool, wierd dream. I was at church camp but we were sleeping with guys in bunks that were designed to look like the inside of a space ship/airplane. And then joel and i were like making out on the floor cuz my sister asked us to kiss, and then shes all ""no i meant on the cheek"". it was wierd. There were alot of crazy characters (friends) that at the time i recognized, but now i am at a loss to conjur into memory. Wierrrrrrrrrd. I just have like a vague idea that i knew them, as so often one feels after a particularly sturring dream. I dont think i have ever had a black and white dream, always color. I remember someone saying something about the signifigance of that, but i dont remember. Story of my life, i dont remember. Id forget my head if it wasnt screwed onto my neck. I think the saying is id loose my head blablabla but i.... forget. hahah. im a spazz. spazzy magee (school of rock, the drummer kids alias (good movie)!!!).
Well im off to sleep, or at least to bed. To curl into a ball and will my mind into shutting up long enough for me to drift off. I think tooo much right before i go to sleep and sometimes my thoughts wake me from an almost sleep. Like ill think ""omg do i have a test tomorrow"" and ill wake all the way back up. although i dont think i have ever thought that. Its usually something wierd, but that is the first example that came to mind. Although not because i infact have a test tomorrow, because i dont. do i? no i dont, and i say that with 50% confidence. Im such a scholor."

"event","* went to lilian's (which is also joel's) and waited for eddie, greg, and alex to show up. After a few set backs we finally made it to hollywood only to realize that i had forgotten my ID. haha. we figured some place would let us in, so we walked around and looked at the stars on the ground, alot of which are people i have never heard of. The big names are like by the big theatres. Like nicole kidman and steven spielberg's stars are right outside the chinese theatre. Anyway, we went to some cute little hot dog stand and the guys ate and we asked the owners if there were any good 18+ clubs around , and the guy was like... ""um there are some good alternitive clubs"" (smile).. so he sent us to this place called ... i dont remember the name but it was an S and M club.. and the bouncer was like.. ""i dont think this is your scene"" and at first we were all excited to go in, but upon closer inspection.. i really dont think it was our scene. there were all these freaky freaks in black and and uugggh they were mighty scary. it was way scary. holy crap. it was like these people crawled out of hell. SO we politely excused ourselves and walked another million blocks, and by now my feet were kinda hurtin, damn those tall shoes!! so then Lily got us some booz and we went to some back alley like 2 blocks away and drank. haha it was so ghetto, but funny. those little bottles are so hard to take shots from, the stuff like drips onto your tongue. So then we went to this other club, the ruby.. or rubys.. i dunno, but they wouldnt let me in with out an ID , so we went to this place called the knitting factory and there was some hip hop club goin on. Greg and i went up and i said that my friends all had ID's but i didnt and he was like, oh thats cool as long as your not drinking, and i was like , oh ya only one of us is (ya right) so instead of making us wait in line and pay $25 he let the five of us go in ahead of everyong for $8 a piece. So we went in there and drank some more and danced our butts off. a little drama happened, but its not worth mentioning. i had alot of fun and i really wanna go back to LA soooon. SO the walk back to the car was like over a mile haha and i was tipsy and barefoot, and trying not to look at the roaches on the sidewalk or the bums sitting on every other wall. very sad. so we go to the car and i was so sore cuz i dunno, eddie was making me dance all wierd and my back hurt so it was nice to sit down. then i hung out with joel, but that is a wholeeeeeeee nuther story"

"event","i love the song ""this i promise you"" by nsync. its so good. i havnt heard it in a really long time. 
i was just watching jerry springer, Gawwd the chicks on there are so gross!! They have cellulite on their arms and stomaches. its like.. keep your god damn clothes on. Ew, dont attractive people ever cheat on eachother and have love triangles and stuff? that would be better to watch, at least then i can see why they are all attracted to eachother. freakin hill billys. ew ew EW. 
I feel like writing in here.. but i dont really have anything to write. So far im getting a B in bizniss law. I think i will actually study for the next test, so maybe i can KEEP the B. i doubt it though. i suck at anything school related. I always do ok in the beggining then i slack off and it all goes to hell. Last night i went to cafe ruba and that was chill, then i saw joel and he was being dumb so i went home and i was sposed to hang out with chris, but of course he never called back. I should just give up on that whole thing. Well i had , but he got back yesterday and he called me like 4 times.. so i thought.. what the hell maybe he still wants to hang out. Im naive though. he probably just couldnt get ahold of anyone else to makeout with. Oh well. At least i wasnt dumb enough to wait up for the call huh?
God, i have really been thinking about it alot , and i need to loose wieght. its like gross ... my stomache is all pudgy and just... ew. My mom says that my diet is horrible, which is true.. but im soo used to eating junk food and all of those diets i try never work. The coke diet worked well but i get too fucked up and sick the weeks after. Plus ive been doing to well to start that shit again. i need to take a shower , i have to go to GW pyscho 100 today. so lame. i think ill bring a book."

"event","gosh, everything is so pointless. i feel so young and at the same time i feel like i need to rush to make a life for myself. find someone... stop sleezin and figure out at least what some of my goals are. its so frustrating seeing happy couples together.. where the fuck is my other half? But im only 18 and i have years and years to find a guy, but i dont feel that way. I just wanna latch onto the next guy i see but god knows i cant do that. ive never been that kinda girl, never dependent on boys and i dont see why i should start now, right? My sister and her boyfriend totally revolve around eachother. its sickening and yet i wish i had it. i hate them and yet i envy them. so lame. im a walking contradiction. oh well boo hoo poor fucking me. so gay. i need to shut the fuck up.. even though i know i never will. i complain alot. 
so anyway this weekend was chill ,hung out with noodle and had a blast and hung out with joel .. for a change.. lol. Fun as usual.  We went to church and bible study and ate at chiles and harb a few times. i hung out with ryan for the first time in a long time, and tonight i went to a movie with steve, which is funny cuz i thought id never talk to him again. Mike Le and dustin seem to think hes kinda ... sleezy or something, but i dont know if that really matters. ive madeout with like 100 guys by now, so i really dont have room to talk. i need to get some sleep. i havnt been smoking lately, yay me. i think i have given up on the twins. we are baby sitting my friend jeff's dog ""puckers"", but i call her ""kujo"" cuz its cute and i dunno it just popped into my head. such a cute doggy, im gunna go take her out of devons room and put her on my bed. i like sleeping with someone or some cat or dog near me. it makes me feel safe."

he asked me if i smoke and i was like.. eh.. sometimes. thats shitty, i wish i didnt smoke. oh well, he will prolly never talk to me again now that he has met me ,but it was a good time anyway. 
my friend scott, the boogie Dj, said that when he and janelle have a kid they are going to name it sierra nicole, after me. how cute. hehe. thats like the third person who was gunna name their kid after me. One time this lady i worked with for like a year told me that she thought she was pregnant and that ""if i have a girl i am going to name her sierra after you, because your such a sweet and wonderful person"". it was really nice. its nice comments like that every now and then that get me over the mean shit people say. people can be so mean and hurtfull sometimes. 
OMG i just accidentally erased all of that, but some how i got it back, so scary!! anyways , i dont really know what else to write. im hungry and i want to go to harb but joel is talking to bet and so he wont want to go. oh well , all is fair in love and war.. whatever that means. alls well that ends well... ya. enough with the phrases sierra. 
Today i just got this total feeling that i needed to leave OC. like get away for a while and re-group my thoughts. But i have school and stuff, so maybe this winter. i dont know where i will go. maybe vegas to stay with judy and micheal. that was sucha great summer , when i just left for two weeks to seattle to stay with them. i was by myself and it was just so awesome and carefree. i visited some great museums....  im suuure i could do some major damage in vegas. especially if i took my car. hehe. three hours is a long drive alone though."

i am heaven sent dont you dare forget. i love that line, gosh , its so good.

Im eating these chocolates that are like calcium suppliments , cuz i dont drink milk.... so anyways , they are called viactive. which makes me think of viagra.. cuz thats just how my mind works. maybe thats why i have been wanting to makeout alot lately . soo kidding.

my mom just came home and was like ""soo.. if someone were to get you something for you bday.. what would you want"" and im like ""why dont you just ask me what i want mom"", and she like giggled. shes so wierd sometimes. 

i already asked for speakers... and i got my hair done which was like 160 and i dont really want anything else.. except that victoria secret thing.. i dunno. birthdays make me depressed, but i think they do that for alot of people. 

""in 1814 we took a little trip, something something something down the mighty mississipp"" my mom was singing that yesterday. in my family we always just break into song and all three of us start like singing oprah and stuff. our poor nieghbors. even when we have people over , we like sing and stuff. we need to learn to shut up. 

last night i hung out with dusty and then joel. D and i watched Nell , and then J and i went to harb and then drove around and listened to his dope-ass cd's. i like just drivin around watching him be a dork. its rad. 

Noodle and i went over to drews to get her car charger, then we went to wahoos. yumm. well kinda yumm... the coke was rather refreshing. 

i need to read and finish this damn book, its taking me forever and a half.
Im out like trout. 

Oh ya , i called scott last night cuz i was listening to ""baby"" by juliana theory, and he didnt pick up , but he friendstered me yesterday and said ""you called but i was asleep, whats up?"" 

WHY would he message me?! thats soo lame. hes soo lame. god!! i replied ""nevermind i was just seeing how you were doing, it was a mistake, my bad""

i dont even know what i meant by that, but oh well.

im on the phone with joel
so i cant type

im in a better mood now. sometimes talking to joel does that and sometimes it just makes me even more upset and often he is the reason that i am mad in the first place haha. but mostly he puts me in a better mood. 
biz law tomorrow, hot twins, ooh lala , i cant wait :)
apparently i am now going to go dream about joel cuz he takes up 60% of my brain, and noodle only gets 10%... i think she will beg to differ. we only use like 10% of our brains as it is, and those twins have got to occupy at least 90% of that! i hope i dream about them, if ya know what i mean. haha. im sucha sicko."

oh ya im officially out of a job. crappy, kinda. 
i just got back from joels. i hang out with him like as much as i used to hang out with janelle or alex. well not alex. we would go like two hours max without seeing eachother. i loved that. i loved just being able to show up at her house in the morning and pounce on her lazy ass to wake her up. such good times. annette was like a second mom, even though my mom is cooler. haha. 
i was just feeling sad about how underapreciated my mom is. i wish i could sit her down and tell her how much i love her and how greatful i am for everything she does for me. i just cant, but i think she needs to hear it. 
joel and i made rootbeer floats, yummmm. i think that i can only study alone, because then.. there is like a 10% chance that i will actually do it.. whereas with an acomplice im am 100% less likely to even open my book.. haha. so shitty

she called me at three and was like lets hang out now.. and im like ""no, im asleep"". geez she is so demanding , i dunno if i can handle a whole night and i kinda wanna go to matts and drink... or go anywhere and drink.
i wanna hang out at johns and talk to dustin :( 
but noods never wants to go over there and even though john told me to come over whenever.. id feel wierd. 
dustin is such an alky. haha. 
i wanna take forensic pathology, but i hope i dont have to like look at dead bodies!! 
haha when i write in this i forget that other people can read it. i probably come off as soo dumb. 
back to the show
k, its over.
i want to talk to those frikkin cute guys in my two classes 
they are so cute and they like always look over at me which either means they want my nuts or something bad. like that i smell 
god , janelle just called and she is being annoying
im like ""are you sure you wanna go? cuz ive told ryan id go twice.. and i didnt.. so i dont wanna flake again"" 
and shes all ""well im like 80% sure cuz i still have to get ready and i dont even want to think about that..""
right.. well whatever.. shes a drama queen but its cool , best friends can be annoying and joel has proved over and over again.. hahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhahaa 
gosh that was funny. 
well i guess ryan is goin to go to coles show with me. how exciting, my first show. hahah.

i madeout with chris B. tonight. that last initial is only to differenciate.(spelling) him from the other chris i sometimes makeout/madeout with. 
gosh, i dunno why i did. hes so cute and stuff, but like he seems older than 21, plus i told him i was 18... and that my bday was july 19th haha... i hate lying , i feel so shitty
cole is trying to convince me to go to his show, and chris wants to go to a show, so i guess ill go.. its on the 28th and id invite joel, but he hates cole, so that wouldnt work 
im not too fond of the guy either
he seems sleezy 
oh well who cares?
im sleezy
i make out with guys the first time i hang out with them
gawddd i want a b/f and thats why i did it 
cuz in the back of my head i was thinking.. chris would make a good b/f 
maybe he will want to date me
im so pathetic
i seriously cant get a bf and thats so lame 
the ugliest and fattest girls get bf's
is my personality THAT horrible? eh, i dont even want to know. 
life is going gay right now. 
joel crashed into a pole and i wanted to make him feel better, but im bad at consoling people
im bad at anything involving emotion
thats why i need a non emotional b/f
i just wont know what to say to him 
when scott ever got emotional id leave or tell him to shutup and quit being a baby or call him a drama queen 
im mean, but i dont see how people can be so open
i just like to push my feelings inside 
janelle says thats why i errupt when i get mad 
could be
i figured out that that whole thing when i was 9 is why i shop so much and why i think spending money will make me feel better.. its wierd how stuff is connected like that
something from 9 years ago still makes me uneasy around men today and stuff.
i figured it out from my psych class
i could be wrong but it makes sense"

kingocatastrophi: are you trashed like usuall?
kingocatastrophi: =D

hahaha, thats sad when some stranger says that to me. gay
im never drunk
only like once a week
im currently starving
not drunk!!!
never drunk 
no seriously 
so tonight... 
first went to hot off the chris... what!?! i meant hot off the grill. god im wierd and i cant type.. anyways went there with noods and cory and pha and noods little bro, who kept burping haha. it was silly. burping is silly.
then i went to liz's and she, stephanie and i went to her friend martins house and met all his friends and they were all from like cuba and argentina and they spoke spanish the whole night and i understood like two words
but luckily i was trashed soon after arriving and in my own little world :)
then we went to the boogie
ok 
so my intentions were pure
i wore a long skirt... over my frikkin bootie shorts and fishnet garter thingys.. but pretty soon the tequila kicked in and the skirt came off and ahh, oh well whats new? who at the boogie hasnt seen my butt? i got lots of beeds and boogie stuff. which is silly and i give it away but oh well. i like the sparkly beeds.
but no matter how slutty i dance or dress..... i didnt hook up with anyone.. even when brian like kept trying to kiss me, i wanted to, cuz i know kissing him is wrong which feels so rrighhht , cuz its bad , and bad is good, as in fun.. get it? well i do and this is my journal and that is all that matters. ha. 
so anyways i didnt kiss him 
then that song joel likes came on and i was like shit this song makes me think of wanting to be with someone , only cuz thats how joel put it and i dunno i just though of it and it made me sad, even though i dont usually attache sentimental stuff to crappy ashanti songs. blah. oh well . so then like i wanted to makeout with brian but i didnt , cuz that woulda been stupid and i would have regretted it tomarrow, and he is suuuch a BAD kisser. If i wanted my face to be swallowed i'd... well nothing, because i cant (at the moment) think of anything that even remotely relates to kissing him. ew . ew. ew. hes cute though, he died his hair brown and he got mad when i messed it up, so i did it again. and hes all i changed my phone number.. and im all ""good thing i havnt tried to call you"" and he got mad.
ok enough about brians bad kissingness and such. 
then we went back to liz's friend martins and i just wanted to go home cuz it was like 130 and i was sobering up and i was pissed from how crowded the stupid sleezy boogy got (and yes i realize that i contribute to the sleeziness with my slutty outfits, so sue me?!), so i was cranky and i think i might be pms'ing, i hope not, i hate that girly shit, so i was all angry and like ""lets go"" and that guys we were with were like all clingy and shit so i got mad haha and hes all whats wrong with you and i dunno, he was scary ugly so i was disgusted and even more mad. then stephanies BF got mad at her and we had to go home (oh darn). 
oh ya and i called joel and hes all are you with girls blabla and matt was like are you with girls blabla
i dont think i ever call them and ask them if they are with guys. 
""hey matt...... um are you with guys right now?""
oh well, so i hung up with them and this was all before we left martins, so i wasnt mad at them at all , just annoyed that i was stuck there until liz decided to drive us home and those fuckers stopped trying to keep us there

all in all it was a super fun night and stuff
the boogie is OKAY every now and then, like once every millenium
maybe not that long

ya know what i realized? i am going to have to re take my drivers license pic or die my hair light blonde, because nnnnoooo one will believe its me
in that pic i was 15.... long blonde hair and i was tan like a negro
now im pale and have short darkish hair 
haha , oh well
an excuse to get my hair ""did""
im starving
i am going to have to eat and risk puking in like an hour or two 
fuck tequila and smirnoff and mikeshardcranberry .... yummmm... 
at least i didnt have a beer tonight 
the last thing i need is a bigger beer gut
i want a bf :(
i want someone to care when i go out late with the girls 
and to worry that im hooking up with other boys
as crazy as that sounds, it would be nice
as of right now no one cares where i go or what i do 
well scott still does... but that doesnt count
that will never work
i gave him a ride home from his grandpas today and he was like trying to touch me and stuff and i was like soo turned off , i was just like ""hey bro,stay on your side of the car"" then after he didnt stop i had to tell him that if he did it again id let him out and he could walk, but he didnt stop, and i didnt pull over, oh well 
at least by then he was only like playing with my hair and stuff
drama drama drama  
i really dont like hurting him"

SIF!<br />I was probably more mature back in the day!<br />I was dreading today, because I didn't want to go to school.<br />But it was amazingly fun!<br />I got to see everyone again! Everyone was happy. So it set a general mood :D<br />There's another Catherine in my class, so I'm the 'Other Catherine' LOL!<br /><br />My friend went to Vietnam, and she got these infamous pens! Which are like 5cents in our currency! She gave me some :D<br />All the other year levels got to go home at 12:30pm. But Year 12 had to stay to watch 'The Crucible' in the audiotorium.<br />We are supposed to have read the book. I haven't read it LOL!<br />And I fell asleep while watching the movie! Uh ohhhhh LOL<br /><br />Katrina tagged me, so I'm going to do it I suppose. Even though I'm not quite sure what to write..<br /><b>A. List seven habits/quirks/facts about yourself. <br />B. Tag seven people to do the same. <br />C. Do not tag the person who tagged you or say that you tag ""whoever wants to do it."" <br /></b><br />1. When I draw, and if a person I draw makes a certain expression. I'm embarrassed to say that I tend to make that expression while I'm drawing the face without realizing it. Not in public of course.<br />2. I wish I could play the violin, or the piano. It makes me angry that I can't.<br />3. I don't like instructions, I'm the type who says 'I'll figure it out'. Then I don't admit I don't know what I'm doing.<br />4. I'm nostalgic. I'm often saying 'Remember when?'. Perhaps I yearn for the old days. I'm sure I do.<br />5. I have a Polish accent when I speak to Polish people, and an English one when speaking to English people. And sometimes a random British one pops up (LOL?)<br />6. People can mess with my head very easily. Aubrey does it a lot, and succeeds.<br />7. I just broke a nail for the first time in my life.<br /><br />I tag:<b><font color=""#800000""> </font><font color=""#800000"">I don't think I even have 7 people on my friends list. So screw the rules. You can do it if you see this.</font></b><b><br /><br /></b></div>"

I'm too lazy now anyway.<br /><br />I've been in a bloody mood lately.<br />LOL<br />So I was drawing. It's what I did today. Not all day of course. Most of it?&nbsp; This isn't everything though. Saving those for a bigger dump in the future.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img175.imageshack.us/img175/1340/sketchfkndumpnx6.png"" /> <br />The first pic on the left. I was thinking of the Queen of Hearts, and I always thought Ace was better than Queen... Soo. The Ace of hearts LOL She could kick the Queen's ass anyday. At least if she wanted to, she'd get off her butt and kill Alice herself. <br />Then there's Yin. This is a character Aubrey came up with. She made her for her fan story for PW. It's a REALLY great story. She thought it up really well. Yin freaks the fking shit out of me, but I love her character nonetheless LOL<br />LE GASP. It's Kana. I was thinking how she would be deep down inside perhaps?<br />Irvineeeeee LOL He's from FFVIII. He can be pretty hot. He's like, one of the few FF guys that are giddy and flirty and stuff. Most are just angsty.<br /><br />One of my friends was kinda scarin me cause she was saying how I should just get Cinnamoroll for my birthday, cause then I'll know from pics if I like her or not.<br />And I haven't gotten a reply from Shana's partner, Mike, soooo.....<br />I want to buy the Super DS card anyway...hehheh...<br />So as much as I love Cinnamoroll now, I don't know if I'll risk it. Just in case JP decides to be a jerk. After all, I don't want $150(AUD) to be a waste. I wouldn't make that money back anyway if I sold her once I got her.<br />LOLOLOL<br />I'm so WEIRD<br /><br />I still have homework to do. LOL<br />WHOOPS<br /><br />I'll take photos of Kana tomorrow Katrina.<br /><br />Poker night. WAS THE BEST!<br />When I first got there. I rang the doorbell, and I heard my friend go 'Oh crap' LOL<br />Then I got in, and for some reason I was really nervous LOL<br />I sat down, and there was only the originals there. So we started to play. <br />I won like, once.<br />But then Mark and I went to play Pool. And as we were finishing, everyone came, and watched me kick his ass at it. LOL<br />And we were all in there making suspenseful noises while the others played pool. LOL<br />Then some played poker, and others kept playing pool.<br />Then we went to watch the newest Halloween. I was laughing while I was watching it.<br />It was the most fun.<br />But Mark and I wanted to play pool again, so we snuck out to play. LOL and Adrian's brother taught me some tricks of pool HAHA<br />I better start nagging for Poker Night for the next holidays :P</div>"

Hasn't it?<br /><br />Not that much has happened I suppose.<br />I've spoken to PullipStyle, and I've pre-ordered Cinnamoroll.

Damn I hate saying that title, cause it sucks ass.<br />But it's a good MMORPG. It's got a good storyline, and the people are incredibly friendly.<br /><br />There aren't any elitist people on it, which I'm happy about because that's not what a game needs. That's not what anything needs really.<br />Though whenever I need a tank and a healer, they are never on at the same time.<br />I wanted to get a pig, which you ride, it's really cute LOL But you need to beat this really hard boss, I think it have like 7k HP. So I asked one of my friends if they knew someone that could kill it. So they came and killed it for me, so I could get the pig.<br />Then afterwards I received an IM from a friend I had met earlier asking if I wanted to join a league. So I said okay, and funny thing. The league was run by the same person that killed the boss, and the members were practically everyone on my friends list. LOL I had about 30 people on my friends list at the time.<br />Everyone knows everyone else. But the leader is like 'Is everyone lvling?' so I can't do anything but lvl LOL But it's what I need to do so I can start using a new bow...<br /><br />Yeahhh<br />It's 3:15am now, but last night I stayed up all night again. I was talking to Aubrey LOL You should know her by now LOL<br />I've been getting snide remarks from my father about how I stay up.<br />'You stay up all night and you sleep all day' He says.<br />LOL<br />Is like... 5am-10am all day? SIF<br />And of all people, he does night shift LOL<br />But I says 'These are my holidays, and I'm enjoying them the way I want to enjoy them'. OYEY.<br /><br />Tonight I'm having poker night with my very good friends from my old school. It's going to be hot, but it's going to be incredibly fun catching up with them all again. I miss them very much.<br /><br />Hmm. Sorry Katrina, no picfics lol. And no Kana. I'm sorry LOL, not this time LOL<br /><br />That must be it I suppose? LOL</div>"

So I kept my promise and did it today.<br />Since I don't plan to make more picfics (this was just to prove my crappy skillz at it), I decided to shed some light on Coral's history.<br />I was planning to name her Reira, because she looks like her (NANA) but, I think that name might be too mature for her personality. So she is Peony. SO, I've decided her real name is Reira, but she is named Peony among her friends as a nick name because it's her favourite flower. But the others call her Peo.<br />Basically cause I would want her to have a nickname. And Rei is too widely used, and seems a bit too mature for her, and I think Peo is cute.<br />Peo was born in Kyoto, Japan and is Care's (I need to change her name, so be prepared for that) cousin. She calls Care 'onee-san', because Care is more like a big sister than a cousin. Despite living in Japan for a long time, she knows english really well, some of her relatives only speak english, so she became fluent so she could speak to them.<br />Although Peo is smart, she is pretty lazy, so she doesn't do homework.<br />Is that enough?<br /><br />On to the pic fic &lt;3<br />(I renamed Panda btw)<br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""VERY Picture heavy""><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img507.imageshack.us/img507/3673/26392998kr0.png"" /><br />Olivia (Panda): Do you know why this backdrop is up?

"event","<div align=""center"">I went to the city with my good friend Meg yesterday. I had one of the best times all year. It was so much fun, so much laughing. <br />When we got there, we were both really hungry since we hadn't had breakfast, and it was lunchtime-ish. So I had coupons and we went to Hungry Jacks (Burger King for you US folk). They have really good chicken burgers. Without the damn thick tomato in it they are awesome LOL.<br /><br />Then I went looking for 'Victoria Hobby Centre' to get MSC. I had forgotten to get the address. So I relied on what I remembered. It was on the main road, but I hadn't even been paying attention to find it yet, and we found it! We went up the stairs (I thought it was going to be downstairs ;_;) And I bought a can of UV cut flat for 16.50. The man was telling me that it took 6 months for the first shipment to arrive LOL. I only got 1, and I wanted 2, but I wanted to see how much money would be left. <br />So we went to Chinatown, and went to buy a few things. Which I hadn't done yet.<br />It's really hard for me to buy things. Unless I'm 100%, cause when I'm in chinatown, there's so much stationary I want. But since it's all expensive, I always find myself putting things back because I question the purpose of what I'm getting.<br /><br />I realized that I didn't have any cash on me, so we went looking for an ATM. But damn, it was raining. I love rain in the city, but uh, my pants were soaking wet, and so were my socks. I took out $70, which would be enough for anything I wanted.<br />So I bought a really adorable notebook, with Mamegoma on it, for $3.50! And it's totally real (I'm writing pullip profiles in it). I bought a chain thingy of hello kitty to put on my phone, it's super cute. We went and I bought bubble tea with cream YUM.<br />We went to get sticker photos, but we had no ideas! So we were both dead in our photos. But we made them funny when we added stuff to the photos.<br />Then we went back for another can of MSC, so I would have the spray for YEARS.<br />On the way home, there were some flowers my mum really liked, but they were always so crappy looking and expensive at home, so I bought a big bunch for her and she loved it.<br /><br />But when I woke up this morning. My feet were killing me. Every time I took a step, it felt like there was no skin on my feet. Just raw meat. It's so painful. And I said to my mum 'Mum, I NEED new shoes. My feet are killing me, I have no shoes to wear other than those vans, and I haven't asked for shoes in a really really long time!' and she said 'The Nike ones?' and I said 'I'd prefer them'. Sooo we went to a big shopping centre, to look for a pair that I saw in the city. But they were too big ;_; Why do I have girl sized feet?!<br />So when we got home, my mum said to buy those easter ones I wanted online, I checked and they never got my size in stock. But there was a Glow in the dark pair I REALLY loved since the beginning, so I bought those :P<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img253.imageshack.us/img253/7003/3127861313mu4.jpg"" /><br />Look at them GLOWWWW.

"event","I can't believe how quickly this year went. It kinda makes me sad to think so.
It makes me feel like I've missed out on so many things, that I haven't accomplished anything.
Will I always feel that way after my last year of school?
I hope I don't.

I'm started to really think about what I REALLY want to do after school.
And I must say, I am pretty much set on becoming a commercial photographer. That would be such an interesting job.
But I'm kinda of wondering if I can do it.
I've had two days of being a Year 12, and there is so much stress on it already. They make it sound like we can't have any sort of personal life..

A very good friend of mine, Aubrey, went to the Phils today! : (
We drew on the walls at school. We drew Phoenix and Edgeworth (We don't support that couple! We love MayaxPhoenix, and MexEdgeworth LOL) And we drew Starman and Stupid Face. Aubrey and I came up with Starman, because we were talking about the Kirby anime, and we wondered what the warp star would look like if he was a character. LOL
Anndddd stupid face is a character she came up with, who is currently having an affair with Starman.

I was supposed to go to an 'Awards Night'. And I was supposed to GET an award. BUT, I'd never been to an 'awards night' before. So I didn't know I was supposed to go in uniform, which is stupid anyway. I'm not going to wear uniform I had been wearing all day on a hot day. So when we got there, and I realized I was to be in uniform, I just thought 'CBF, let's go home'. It was a waste of time apparently LOL.

On Tuesday I had a day off, because I didn't have exams that day. So my friend, Charmie, and I visited our old school (We go to the same school now, and went to the same old one WOO). We walked in the heat for an hour or so. And we realized how unfit we are! Just a year ago, we would go every day skating in that type of heat, and it wouldn't phase us. We weren't allowed to visit WTF? But, we went around, where there is no fence, and we saw our friends! But then all the fakes (These girls back-stabbed Charmie as soon as she left. I thought they were my friends, but I I realized how two faced they all were as soon as Charmie left) came up to us, and were like 'You're hair looks nice, it suits you!' and I we were like 'Okay'. They noticed we didn't care and they left. It was funny treating them with the same amount of respect they treated us. Our real friends came after school with us and played basket ball! It was so great catching up with each other. And we could immediately speak to them about anything, it wasn't awkward at all. I was so happy, nothing could have ruined my mood.

I guess that wraps up the last week."

But I had a four day weekend, monday was a day off, and today, was the races.
My dad and I had been speaking a lot about getting a laptop so that I would have one next year for Year 12.. We decided that it would be best if I just did it so I paid like $20 a month over heaps of years. But no store was having that deal, so my dad said that when we find a good laptop, he'll buy it and I'll pay him back $20 a month.
So we went to harvey norman yesterday, and found the CUTEST laptop ever, it's 12.1"". So it's super small and cute. I never liked those huge wide screen ones, they look ugly.

So, we looked at the price. $1749. It was already marked down to clear from $1999. We asked the salesperson what was the best deal we could get for it. He said $1700. We were content with that. So after much deliberation, we decided to buy it. The guy threw in an $80 bag for it, I think he knew it was for me.

So I've been spending most of the day transferring my files from my PC to this laptop...Using a 1GB stick, since my PC doesn't have a DVD drive (never was interested in buying one sicne we have 2 in the house). But I've finished now. And I still can't get over it HAHA
It's so cute, I just love it.
I'm going to take it to school : )

My friend, Meg, was talking to me about how we should go to the&nbsp;city these summer holidays and go buy stationary for the next year. We don't go to the same school anymore, but I'm super glad we still are in contact. Now I can't wait for exams to pass, and Year 11 to be over, so that I can just relax and have some fun for a good 2 months.

I watched NANA last night, the anime btw. Meg gave it to me, but none of the computers wanted to play it. I got up to episode 8, when I decided to get to sleep. It's good, I want to watch more, but unfortunately I can't now, since I'm super tired.

The long weekend was fun, but it's over now.. On to studying for exams!!

So I guess it's just in comparison.<br />I've been playing my DS, and apparently I'm very good with memory. I made it a case. Unfortunately its a TINY bit to small (didn't measure) but it'll stretch out.<br /><br />I got a really bad stabbing pain where (my mum says) my appendix is. It last for about 15 minutes, because I took pain killers earlier on, so I think it went away because of that. In a way it freaked me out because it was so painful. But it might just be normal to have pains in places every so often.<br /><br />At school, the Year 12's have finished, and they have there exam in the coming week. So in our building, it was the Year 12's and Year 11's upstairs. And because the teachers want the Year 12's to have their exams upstairs, we were sent downstairs. So now we don't have to go upstairs all the time (It really gets to you when you go up the stairs 6 times a day). What's better is we have access to the Year 12 kitchen now. So we get to bring cold food and heat it up, or we get to bring our own noodles. Everyone has vowed to never buy from the canteen again.<br />Though, I don't eat lunch at school....<br /><br />I drew a picutre of Lolee, one of my custom pullips.<br /><br /><div align=""center""><img alt="""" src=""http://fc01.deviantart.com/fs19/f/2007/300/c/0/Lolee_by_sweetbox.png"" /><br /></div>It's her in a dress I want to make for her someday.<br /><br />Speaking of Pullips. That Hello Kitty pullip sure is cute. I love her stock outfit. I want it. But I don't think I'm willing to pay such a price. The cinnamoroll DAL is cute, but I wonder how much she will cost.....<br /><br /><br /><div align=""center"">Anyway! I'm off to play some kirby. </div>"

I got my DS! Probably the only blue one available in Melbourne! LOL, prolly not. But I checked over 10 different stores, and no one had blue. So I got the LAST blue one and Big brain Academy for $230. I'm borrowing elite beat agents from a friend tomorrow. So I can elarn to kick her ass in it while she plays the jap one LOL

I'm so happy now. I have the blue one, and it's so hard to find! And I didn't have to wait another month to get it!

GOING TO PLAY~"

"event","I must have horrible luck. It's always been like that. 

There's a good deal at JB Hifi, for a Ds lite and a 'Drawn to life' game. I called up yesterday, and it was still available. I waited until today, so that I can go buy it, with a blue DS. I got there and it turned out that they had no blue ones left, and that the deal won't be on when the blue ones come in stock, if they ever do. Shattering much?

So I went everywhere trying to find another deal. No one has a blue one. Except harvey norman, but that's too expensive.
So am I being told to get the pink? Or wait for the blue (Or buy the expensive one at harvery norman)?

This makes me so angry."

"event","I dont' think I have gotten used to getting up at 6:30am, to get to school after my holidays. But I keep thiking about what's going to happen after I finish Year 12. I've been in this routine for so long now, I can't really imagine myself doing anything else other than going to school. 

Well, I told my friend Aubrey, who has the normal pink DS, that I am now stuck with the decision on getting blue, or pink. She told me to get pink, so we can be 'PINK DS BUDDIES'. But I like the blue as well. I'm always annoying with these kind of things, since I'm a paranoid person, I always fear that I'll make the wrong decision, and regret it later on.
She's already agreed to go to the shops with me to buy it. She actually is more excited than me!!"

"event","Well. I think I'm going to drop Chemistry as a subject next year. For one thing, my teacher said 'It's no walk in the park', and I believe her, AND, I don't need Chemistry to become a commercial photographer..<br /><br />My friend, Shirley, who wants to be a commercial photographer( for those who don't know, taking photos of models..etc) as well, is going to attend the same university as me! So I think it'll be really great continuing a friendship in Uni. My other friend is going to the same one as well, but completing a different course.<br />I think I feel more confident about my education now. It's really hard preparing for further studies, in practically, two years.<br /><br />In other news, I'm saving up for a Nintendo DS lite, in Metallic rose! <br /><br /><div align=""center""><img alt="""" src=""http://img150.imageshack.us/img150/5889/meallicroseqw6.png"" /><br /><br /><div align=""left"">It's a new colour variation that was released in Japan earlier this year. I had originally planned to get pink, but my friend got that and it isn't the type of pink I would want. But then I wanted to get the blue one, since it was released here only a couple months ago (strange isn't it?). But when I was checking eBay for cheaper prices than what they offer here, I found the rose beauty! I instantly knew I wanted this one. <br /><br />Unfortunately, the AC adapter has a different plug, so I can't plug it here. Even if I got one of those converter travel plugs, it wouldn't work since US/Japan is 110V, while Australia's is 220V. SO, I would need a transformer for that, but I'm not willing to pay $60. LOL<br />So I found out that you can use USB cables to charge, so despite the fact, that I have to pay more to it work, I'm still going to get it. I'm very stubborn with the the things I want!<br /><br /><br />I wish they made a pastel green DS lite. And I'll cry if they do. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law"">Murphy's Law </a>is that they will come out with one after I've bought the rose one, and that they won't if I don't buy the rose one.<br />But I love the rose one either way.<br />I've planned to buy a DS super card, so that&nbsp; can just download games xD My friend has already told me heaps of games to d/l, so that we can verse each other in our maths/photography class!<br /><br /><br /><br />I've been looking into Final Fantasy VII: Crisis Core. I've never really liked the Final Fantasy VII game (maybe it's because of the graphics??), but I was very interested in Advent Children. And I found out a lot reading about Crisis Core, and it sounds like such an interesting story! I don't have a PSP (and nor do I want one), so I decided to watch the ending, and it's pretty sad. The graphics are so good, they have really improved in 10 years!!<br /><br />Well, that's all I have to say for now : )<br /></div></div>"

My last day of school holidays D' :
I never really accomplished anything these holidays. I was supposed to take lots of photos of my pullips, but I got lazy. D:

For some reason, when I feel like taking photos, I get really excited about it, and can't wait, but as soon as I get outside, I don't want to anymore. 
I really have to try take more photos of them. I feel bad. 
But Kana is just a head, because her Obitsu keeps going wobbly at the neck. Marie (formally Heart) needs a white wig. And I guess they all just need new clothes -____-;;

I'm meeting my friend today at the park, so that she can help me with my Chemistry homework. Now now, I didn't procrastinate until the last day, I just got really stuck on Stoichiometry, since I was away the day it was taught -___-;;. And the test book is no help at all. And I have 16 questions left to do, which is lucky my class got so little, the other chemistry class I used to be in would have gotten more."

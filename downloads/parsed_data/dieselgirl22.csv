"event","oh no the hurricane is headed straight for my old home! 

so i'm sittin here in my last few days with cable tv watching whatever happens to be on ... and they are still having issues or talkin about suing fast food places for making people fat-""the cheeseburger bill"". i don't think i even need to say it but i'm totally against fat people using that as an excuse... but then ya know if all the fat folks did sue fast food places, the fast food places would go bankrupt and out of business and then there would be no more fast food places to make those people fat. and then the fat people would find something else to eat to get fat on, but they would have all that money from suing the fast food places and then maybe just maybe they would realize they need to balance out their over-eating/under-exercising and then maybe they would hire personal trainers such as myself with all that money.  ...as long as they didn't try to sue SONIC cuz that would just be taking it too far. 

the end."

"event","remember a few weeks ago when i kinda tripped and fell while i was running. ...well yeah i thought that was long forgotten about all but the scars on my knees. oh well i was wrong cuz while walkin out the gym today some guy says hey i saw you fall while you were running! ...even the best fall down sometimes.

and since i need to give my girls more freedom and be less restricting i just let diesel go outside today. she didn't last long cuz she got scared by a truck. but i was so tired of her crying and pacing everyday that fuck it let her go and if she's not back when i decide to move well thats too bad. (no actually i probably wouldn't leave her but i have to tell her that so she'll come back)

...everytime i start feeling like my back is gettin better it always reminds me that it will never be the way it was before.

"event","in the past month (not including the regular 'its that time of the month' 5 lb gain and then 5 lb lose) i have lost 4 lbs and 1% body fat. ...ok ok not bad especially since i haven't really been workin out that hard and well its very easy to eat ice cream and M&Ms all the time since we have enough of those to last a whole year! and its just really  hard to find healthy food in this house. 

the goal for the next 3 weeks is 3 lbs and 2%."

"event","just the thought of moving again in the very near future is overwhelming. and moving again a few months after that....geeeeezzzzz. everytime i move i seem to have less and less personal belongings to actually move. this will be the 4th move in 10 months. and maybe i'll even make it 5 moves before the year is over!

but hopefully the next place i live doesn't have as many spiders as this place!"

"event","sometimes it feels like the whole world is destroying itself or being destroyed or ...i don't know....falling to pieces. globally and in my own small circle. 

for some strange reason my dieselcat is acting like this is the end of the world and she doesn't want me to leave her side to even go take a shower(but that isn't the reason i didn't shower yesterday). 

the rubber band is stretching and stretching and being pulled in so many directions and when (not if) it breaks what will be left of us?

despite all this i feel extremely lucky and grateful for some reason."

"event","hhhmmmm...hanging with the 7 year old aka babysitting was a little more interesting today. rode my bike over there. 3 miles over there of nothing but steep hills. but it was fun. so the neighbor boy decided to come over to play today. this kid was annoying as hell. just asked too many questions. like do you work or go to school? ""no i don't work or go to school. and if you're as cool as me when you grow up you won't have to work or go to school either.""  i can't stand the kids that ask too many questions cuz then i start gettin sarcastic and shitty with them. but this kid got punched right in the balls! ha! but not by me of course. other than that today consisted of bike races in the middle of the street, eating lots of candy, chugging a can of mt dew and then seeing who could burp the loudest, ultimate fighting on the living room floor, and playing catch. i'd have to say that was the most exciting hour and 15 minutes of my day.

<LI>there really needs to be a 'changing of the guard' with the sports reporters/analysts these days. there needs to be a lot more females out there especially on the shows like PTI&nbsp; mostly becuase those guys are so fuckin ugly they should not be on tv cuz no one wants to look at them! not saying they don't make good points or know what they're talking about, but can't they&nbsp;get like makeovers or at least look halfway decent? no female reporter would ever go on tv looking like some of those guys do.</LI>
<LI>i wish catnip had the same effect on me as it does my DIESELCAT.</LI>
<LI>never thought i'd say this but i kinda don't mind babysitting... or as i like to say hanging out with a 7 year old kid. jumping on couches, playing catch in the house, eating lots of candy bars, and watching cartoons is not all that bad. </LI>
<LI>i wonder how many if any people read this. ya ever wonder how many people hit that random search button and actually land on your site and read what you have to say even though they don't even know you? like what are the chances that you hit that button and land on my site? it must be like winning the lottery, but not quite as fun. </LI></UL>

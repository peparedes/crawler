"event","Whenever i get bored i always write in my journal, then i read peoples live journal, and i always say ""sy, you should start one."" Then i do and stop writing in it, but im really really gonna try this time, i promiss.

So last night was the prom, and at first it sucked  a l o t. It's really funny because you go there, and shake evrybody's hand, and hug people, and tell them they look 'sharp', or whatever. Then in your head your thinking, hey i really don't like this person, or they don't even look nice.. it's funny, i dunno. Then we all ate it was pretty good food, then we all started dancing. I love dancing so it was definately a good time there. After prom we got a hotel and drank a little and just hung out, it was very nice.

So i woke up with a little headache, haha, and now im just sitting around.

I can't believe tomorrow is class day!"

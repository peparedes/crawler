"event","A pretty exciting night, this last one was. As I was sitting on my porch having a smoke and reading the news ( much as I always do) this guy walks by whom Id shared a CS class with last semester.  We'ed always given the 'whats up' to each other, cause, well, thats what smokers do.  We got talking and he invited me to this party, and it was the wierdest goddamn thing Id ever seen.  Most of the time we just drank beer and watched South Park and shit, but then this guy started running around with a slingshot and bb gun.  That was interesting.  To escape the projectiles, me and a few guys went upstairs to these girls' apartment and sat around talking about geo-politca bullshit.  I think I totally impressed them with my ""Why George Bush should be re-elected"" speech.  You know, the funny one about armageddon and what have you.  Then me and this girl named Autumn drank tea and smoked on her balcony for what must have been an hour just talking about all the cool shit we knew (obviously, most of it was from classes).  She's a Literary Studies major so we had alot to talk about, considering Ive taken at least one Lit. class every semester since Ive been in college.  Then I noticed all the guys had gone downstairs, so I ent down and found out that a bottle of vody got cracked and then began the confusion.  I think I came back home around 4 or so."

Everyone plays Tekken, Smash, and Dance Dance.  Somehow, even with all the atheists, intellectuals, and anime nerds, I still feel out of place.  I'm lucky that I grew up in Odessa, for it makes me quite the individual.  Spencer let me have/borrow his skateboard, so getting to class is hella easy.  Downhill both ways.

"event","Ah, the pursuit of knowledge.  Nothing like some good ol' pedagogy to get me thorugh my day.  Eating delicious flesh of the sandwich beast.  Its my mom's birthday, but more importantly, its Canada day.  I need to celebrate (hint hint), but I have finals tomorow.  Quite a conundrum.  On one hand, the professional success and happiness and on the other hand, one stupid night of getting wasted and passing out around 4 accomplishing nothing.  Well, duh."

"event","<P>hmm. i wish i could delete my last 11 entries. basically brad went to colorado the day after we started officially going out..then we broke up while he was there b/c he didn't plan on coming back. then he ended up coming back and he got a new girlfriend. basically after everything..i wasted like 6 months? which sucks, but i hate regretting things because in the long run, they make you a better person and you learn from your mistakes. so he was just a 6-month mistake :-) but yeah i've been sick for the past 2 days..so i already have to take finals. meh no big deal..i was gonna have to anyways..i always take them.</P>

"event","<P>wow, its been a while since i wrote..well a little over a monthh.&nbsp;well my last entry was basically about uncle rick's being sick and me really wishing he wasn't and even though he was, i wanted people to give a damn i was hurting? because i was, i was hurting so badly..but i realized who was really here for me..when shandi found out about everything she called me crying and she went to the hospital and saw him every night..and yeah ashley and katie came...but katie just ended up blowing me off most of the time, usually for lostant..and yeah she did have&nbsp;ONO, but still she could have at least called me like ashley did?&nbsp;and then&nbsp;theres&nbsp;caitie..we would hang out a lot because i really needed to get it off my mind..and thursday morning Rick told Monica that he loved her and how he missed his stairway..and was afraid to go to heaven, but was ready to go there, then&nbsp;he told monica he wanted her and the kids to go with him, but he knew it wasn't their time, so he'd go there and wait for them..welll then they thought he was going to pass away on friday the 21st..so they took me out of 3rd hour and i went up to the hospital to basically say goodbye..and the doctor came in and said he basically had hours to live...well for some reason he was still holding on, something was keeping him here..what? i dont know, i guess we'll never know, but he lived until Monday morning at 1:35 he took a big gasp and then he was just gone. it was the best way for him to go, he was suffering..but its just so hard. and i miss him SO MUCH.&nbsp;and yeah me and brad are getting better..we've talked about it and he's made me feel so much better about everything..and most of the time he just takes my mind off of all the problems with my family. and thats exactly what i need right now..</P>

"event","<P>well i haven't actually written in this thing in forever.&nbsp;and yeah me and brad are still whatever you want to call it? we're not going out, but i guess you could say were more than friends? i dont know..but he's moving to colorado in like 2 weeks...and last night we were on the phone at like 11 i think...and he was&nbsp;in a bad mood and was saying he couldn't wait to move and w/e to get away from people..and i like almost broke down b/c i really don't want him to leave..and i was like brad--i'll never see you again? and he was telling me how he'll be back from christmas and spring break..and i was just like um ok 2 times a year..wow?&nbsp;and he was like im going to be 18..i'll be back all the time..and this summer i'll be here the entire time. but i dont think he realizes that a lot can change in that time..he's moving and is gonna meet so many other girls..and he says he'll come back now..but what if he doesn't mean it? he promised me he'd come back...but that doesn't mean anything because he'll probably forget all about me..well us. yeah well i have to go with my sister..so i'll write more later..</P>

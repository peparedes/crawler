"event","Wow I think it is about time to update. 

I wish to never treat my own like this. It all seems petty in the scheme of things, but is it? IT is that I have been blind all this time and now I can see? What has made me so? The only person I truely care about is too far to comprehend, while those unwanted are too close to tolerate. All that has been rummaging through this confused head is now just starting to organize itself, and the reality that has untill this point been ignored is now realised. While I know I should be strong and have confidence in myself when troubles and emotions appear, I feel I am too weak to passivly tolerate this abuse. 

If they ask anything nicely (rarely) I am almost inclined to ignore them, almost, as if they did not mean it. But when they yell, that is when I respond. But this is innate. I have been told all my life that the only way to get any type of response is to either yell, whine or threaten. These to not contain any positive/healthy inclinations. They try to take/threaten me with what I want or need most so that I am forced to be pleasant and their perfect little child. They think they can will my favor with posessions. But wat I truely want is respect and independence. I can have performed challenging tasks without screwing up. Haven't I already proven this with everything I do? LET ME GO. I am no longer ""their little girl"" who thinks everything they say is right and just. NO one in this world is ever right all the time. And then I am expected to treat them as if they always are? 

Hummm.

wow i have kinda forgotten about livejournal. It is bad. well right now I cant really type anything, since I am really busy, like usual. Homework and just plain stuff to do has been invading my time. 

Jon just left today and started his second semester at Michigan Tech. I miss him. And I dont like him being gone. 

I envy people with bf's only 5 minutes away all the time. It would take me 10 hours to drive up the the UP to see him. Sometimes i have the urge to just drop everything I am doing and drive up there, just to see his smiling face. *sigh*. Back to my busy life.

got this from kendras livejournal... kinda liked it... but i dont think of myself as a prep... everything else is pretty accurate though lol

so i talked to my mom today about maybe getting a tatoo, like the treble clef on my hip/back area or shoulder, i dont know yet. It would be VERY small and yeah... she didnt make any promisses but didnt say no, so pray for me! 

worked today... meh

hey jon's b-day is comming up, if anyone has any suggestions on what i should get him, let me know! i am completely lost... this is my first boyfriend!"

"event","Hey so today I started working at Milk and Honey, this fancy kosher (sp?) restaurant in the Jewish Community Center. I know you guys are going to think I am dumb, but I actually liked it. I LIKED working. Haha, it is not like I would still go there if i didnt get paid, but it is a nice way to earn money. The people there are very nice and easy-going, and plus I get FREE FOOD! WOOO. and the food is AWESOME! haha i could eat all the time if i wanted. I am going to get fat. 

anyways, I am halfway done with my chem summer assignment. that is good. it is kinda fun too, but time consuming. I am really not looking forward to school, because it means i will have to have 2 books plus the book of job (bible) read with three corresponding essays, and a sample college admission essay for AP english. wtf. mr brown is no longer the instigator of fun, more like the instigator of crap that sucks a lot. 

well yeah, been kinda boring around here with jon gone. meh. i miss him. 

ANGLEA GOT A TATOO! now i want one! hehehe. maybe a music note or the treble clef. we will see when i am 18, because there is NO WAY my parents will let me get one now.

Jon just went off to college wednesday... 

I am sad. 

I dont know how else to put it... 

To have something so good, and then have it taken away from you is the worst feeling in the world.

To be treated differently, like a princess, to actually have someone that CARES. 

God what the hell. 

Screw me over once again why dont you, you have with basically everything else.

Civic sucks too. Screw Mr. Burke. Fuck.

I am in a bad mood.

There was no point to this entry.

School is comming, FUCK. Screw school. 

I want my life to be how it was, please, i was so happy.

Now it is gone."

Well anyways today was not nearly as exciting as yesterday lol. I practiced essentially all day because I have not practiced for sooo long. Wow I really need to practice more... I am beginning to get worse. The Second Movement of my solo is wonderful, adding emotion makes playing 100 times better. The sadness and then the hope that arises... like the sunrise making the dew of a past thunderstorm glisten... aaaaahhhh IM SO CORNY! I have been reading too much. So hopefully my private teacher does not become too mad at me for not practicing that much... but hey there has been a lot on my mind!

So thereafter I went bowling with Angela, Mandy, and Shawn which was extremely fun. Forgetting about how many gutter balls I threw, I actually played pretty decient. Two strikes wooo. Well too bad I am horrible. Having time to spend with friends is the best! Friends are cool. 

Haha lots of questions about Jon from everyone. Believe me he is GREAT!!! aaaahhh yay.

Yesterday Angela, Chris, Zach, Shawn, and I went to Canada. No reason or purpose, only our inclinations. Anyway... it was fun. Canada is so peaceful. There is diversity and every different type of house you could have sitting right next to eachother. Parents walk their children down the street with no fear. I only can wish it will some day be that way in Detroit.

This has been on my mind lately, especially since meeting new people opens my eyes to different aspects of my life.

Complicating the fake to make it seem real is ingenious to you. You see what you have and then ignore it anyway with blind and misguided communications. You expect me to thoughtlessly respond to your beckoning only because of tradition. Too bad I know. Too bad I can see now. I can see your careless, ungrateful, and timid actions. I can hear your lies. I can feel your abuse, consistent arguing ringing through the willingly blocked depths.

Hopefully that doesnt creap you out too much. But if you think it is for you, if anything correlates... then this is probably for you. 

Today I woke up at noon, kind of unusual, but laying in bed is just so nice, especially when you have a lot on your mind.  

Chelsea wanted to see Dodgeball, and I really wanted to see it too, so we went at about 3ish. That movie is hilarious. I cant tell everyone reading this how funny of a movie Dodgeball is. I was cracking up at least every minute. Haha Ben Stiller is the best. 

So anyways... I planned on going to private lessons today but I was a dumbass and forgot we rescheduled it for tomorrow (wednesday)... so I drove all the way to southfield for nothing. GRR.

I had met up with Jonathan (Jon for short) in Livonia since I wanted to see him again. We went out to eat at Bahama Breeze and I ordered this really good angel hair pasta thing. Jon tried paying for me, but I refused to let him. I do not want to be one of those girls who depends on her date for food and stuff. I know it is traditional for the guy to pay... but hell that is ridiculous, we are in the 21st century. If women want equality we better start showing it. Haha. Well I only had 12 dollars so I just gave all my money to him. He was trying to not take it again but I told him I would be very mad if he did not take it. Lol. 

Well aaannyyways. It was still light out, nice and sunny, so we went to the park to walk around and just talk. It was a different experience when you are with someone you ""like"" than just with your friends. Hehe talking is fun. He was talking about this one sitcom thing from the 70's called ""Soap"" which parodies a typical soap opera. I thought it sounded neat, so we went back to his house to watch some episodes he has on DVD. I met his parents earlier, but I talked with them some more... about Ireland and such haha. We then watched the episodes in his basement, if you want to know some details then just ask me lol. Not posting this for the whole world to see. Nothing big though, so dont worry ;) I gave him a nice big hug before I left, haha then another because it was so nice hehehehe. He helped me find 96 West so I could get home... because I had gotten VERY lost comming to Livonia. I was a half an hour late lol. Thank you Angelas mom for helping me!!!!

wooo love how im too lazy to update my journal.

ANNYWAYAZZZ

So today I washed everything I saw... including my bird cage and every inch of my car. It looks new now! haha i wish. Kind of proud of my non-lazyness today.

Now lets cover a broader span of time...

***Three turns should do it Miss Granger***

UMMMM Chelsea came back from Interlochen so now we are planning our SECRET CONSPIRACY that everyone will envy when completed. yes. haha. Only special people (and Lauren) know some of the details of this mission. hehe. So I have been researching on a lot of that. Besides the fact, TOTALLY unrelated, I have been reading Harry Potter like crazy and am currently in my favorite book of the series, Goblet of Fire. Very estatic about that, not that you care but I do. We also watched the first movie with this special audio chelsea downloaded. You put the movie on mute and play this cd at the same time. All I have to say is Ron likes Twizlers. Huummmm no one gets it... of coarse you wont untill you listen to the audio as well! Funny stuff. 

So I went with Angela and Mandy to Livonia or something on Thursday to see Spiderman 2 with Mark's friends. The tickets were free because Rob? (i think was his name) worked at the theatre and could get us movie tickets. Soooo neat. I talked awile with Jon about some Harry Potter, and he recommended some other books I should read! He was VERY nice and had really pretty blue eyes hehe. He gave me his # so we will see how that goes... ;) 

Also saw Anchorman with Chelsea and Lauren! That was extremely funny, but not as funny as I presumed. Ben Stiller spanish?! ummm just because you make his hair long and greasy doesnt turn him hispanic hahaha but still hilarious!!!

Well nothing else is going on I dont think.... I will try to update more often just for my benefit because I really like reading these 2 months from now. Hehe.

Went grocery shopping with chris and zach yesterday. I swear they have never been inside a grocery store before, good thing they dont read my livejournal haha. Well ANYWAYS we went to zachs house and his mom handed him his SUMMER INSTITUTE music (really hard summer orchestra camp im going to too!) which lists the seatings. Proud to say, I am the 3rd chair Violist! WOOT. hahaaa I am above all the sinfonia people and with the CIVIC violas. haha stupid people. 

so my mom yelled at me for downloading this spy-program that i thought would delete spyware, but then they had their credit card # stolen from the program i downloaded. So i was throughly bitched out. hummm so goes for trying to help. i just got pissed and went in my room to read some more."

"event","Wooo I am so happy. This is the first weekend of summer, and I have already had so much fun! I have accomplished my goal for this year, to earn all A's!!! woot now my grade point average for all three years of high school is a straight 4.0! :) Now just worry about next year... aahhhh. 

Well too bad its summer! 

AHAHAHA

After school on Thursday Chris, Zach, and I went to the mall. I bought these frickin expensive Coach shoes from Nordstroms... but they are so cute! you have to splurge a little, especially after working really hard at school all year. Zach also had his Civic audition, so Chris and I went downtown Detroit to support him. He did perfectly fine, of coarse. We then pulled a prank on this guy who was sitting inside a gate house for this gated community in West Bloomfield,and you have to tell them the name of the person you are visiting and they will let you through... without even checking, they just racially profile you or something. we kept on asking for weird chinese names like... Ho Ping Showg or whatever... we just kept on pulling in about 6 times asking for a different asian names. the guy was so confused, but he couldnt refuse cause they dont have a sheet of names or anything to see if we are lying. haha stupid people. 

so friday i did nothing except go to my back doctor. He said i need to excersise more so my back doesnt hurt. hes all like, ""doctors like to classify people like you as CP's"". I was so confused and asked him what that meant... and he said ""couch potatoes"". haha i know im lazy... i just thought that was funny. 

so today im tanning so im not as pale as i usually am, planning on hanging out with angela after she gets off of work at 6... so we will see!

So hey. DID YOU MISS ME!? It is okay if you did not... I know how I am haha. 

Washington is the most beautiful city I have ever been to. The classic style of the buildings and the scenery (amazing) makes me want to just drop my jaw and stare off into space. I am seriously considering living there after college, or even possibly attending a college there like George Washington University or Georgetown University. I feel like I am stepping back in time... moving to a different surrounding that I can forget all the drama and stress of high school and truely enjoy myself with the people around me. Honesty the best trip I have been on in a long time. 

Also, traveling with Sinfonia on a small, crammed bus when the DVD player makes the TV screen fade in and out degrades the trip, but my wonderful friends that can make me laugh the hardest I have in YEARS made the bus ride truely amazing! Thank you soo much Clair, Laurnen, Jenna, Zach, Braden, and EVERYONE for making the trip unforgettable! 

I really did not know how much drama could be produced by a whole bunch of orchestra dorks, but supposedly a lot lol. Some people are stupid... especially when you think you knew a person and they turn out to be the complete opposite of what you presumed. Haha there is going to be some major payback for some things... jenna you might know what im talking about. well thats about it, so bye bye!"

"event","HELLO EVERYONE! say hi back! hehe

Well today was eventful. Went to Sinfonia with Clair and Lauren. When we get there... Mr. Burke tells us there are some Civic people there so im thinking hey thats cool. So then I look back at the French Horn section and see ZACH!! woooo havent seen him in Sinfonia since last year, so that was exciting. Haha Lauren thought there were 4 extra horns... but it was just Zach. He is soooo good. **jealous**

So I thought I played my Viola rather well today. Johanna (my stand partner) and I had to sit FIRST STAND today since Carly and Drew were slackers and didnt come. Mr. Burke actually acknowledged the viola section (especially the FIRST STAND) for playing really well. This is comming from a guy that gives little compliments... the violas will be complimented maybe once a year... and it was when I was in front!! woo go violas.

So then supposedly a vacumm cleaner blew up in a dressing room or something... and all of orchestra hall had to be evacuated because the fire alarms went off. haha I took my viola cause I didnt want it to get burned up, but nothing burned so we went back inside.

After Sinfonia Clair and I went to the mall so she could pick out her birthday present, so we went to Sephora and got this really expensive lip gloss stuff that all the celebrities use for $20. Yeah, seems ridiculous but you get a lot and it is the BEST! seriously. 

Went to Clairs house for her Birthday party. Lets see, umm Clair, Leigh, Megan, Melissa, Lauren, Chris, and Eugene (dont know him) were there and we were supposed to play ultimate hide-and-go-seek but it was raining, so we went to go see MEAN GIRLS instead. It was sooooooo funny OMG I thought it would be a dumb movie but I really liked it. Everyone was cracking up... I was about to die at certain points. Haha. 

Unfortunately after the movie Leigh started feeling really sick and nauseous. His forehead was very hot and he couldnt feel his hands or feet. We almost took him to the hospital, but he insisted on going home. We dropped him off, and the weird thing was his parents didnt seem concerned at all. I was soo worried, but not as much as Clair (its her boyfriend). I am still worried about him, hope he gets better.

Then after that we went back to Clairs house, ate cake, and unwrapped her presents. Fun times. Drove back home with 3 minutes till curfew. Thank God I got home on time because my parents were waiting for me. SCARY!!

Took a nap, my mom made meatloaf, went to private lessons, and homework. WOOO fun day. 

The only thing that happened which was sort of interesting was what happened in my AP European History class. We were told we would have a DBQ today (Document Based Question, a sort of essay), but we have had a BILLION DBQ'S and everyone was protesting and boycotting the DBQ when we walked into class. So we were all arguing with Mr. Drummond, and yeah. Adam was the only one who actually threw his test on the floor (well Andy Johnson too, but hes dumb) the rest of the class chickened out, including me haha (HEY I dont want a 0 out of 50 for one of my assignments okay??) so anyways, we wrote the frickin thing and drummond told us about when he was a senior in high school and he tried to sneak out of the school for lunch. It was quite funny, I laughed. Anna-Kristen was pissed, haha it is soo funny seeing her mad because she just bottles it all in and you can see her about to explode, but she never does. LOL good times

"event","It turns out that the many ""guest conductors"" Mr. Burke kept on bringing into Sinfonia were in fact interviewing for the New conductors position for the civic ensembles. Not that many of you care... lol. So the flamboyant guy from Oakland Youth Orchestra was hired, and he conducted us again on Saturday. I really like him though, you feel like you can actually talk to him, and you are not intimidated by him either (unlike Burke, he scares me!!!) I said good job to him and he was really nice and complimented me back and everything. He is going to be good.

ANYWAYS. worked some more and got sunburned. RAA. I really needed to vent from all the pressure on me right now, so Angela and I went to the mall and bought stuff. We saw Dan Grimes working at his job, the kiddy playground thing at summit mall. That job sucks. haha. We laughed.

So now I look forward to what?! HUMMM AP TESTS!! wooo I am warning everyone right now do not piss me off because I will blow up. literally. dont try. 

WOOOOABBEEERRNFICKLE.

"event","Yep I had Viola lessons Tuesday night and it made me very happy lol. I guess I was playing my solo very well, and my private teacher got all excited and she is saying, ""wow! you are going to make civic!!"" and all this other stuff. It is nice to see all this hard work pay off somewhere. I swear a compliment is the best thing, it makes someone feel special! So everyone give people compliments, even if you have never talked to them, cause you might make their day. Yep. 

Well Wednesday nothing happened really, I watched the OC which is my FAVORITE tv show. Ahh this week the episode sucked though. 

Today was Earth Day so NHS had to pick up trash outside of our school for community service. HAHA Erika, Chelsea, Eryn Klager, and I found the most bizarre things! Here is the results:

4th Place- Me for finding little boys underware... WTF
3rd Place- Erika for finding testosterone cream???
2nd Place- Chelsea for finding a joint (on school grounds?!)
1st Place- Eryn for finding a condom box, wrapper, and the actual used condom. Yeah that is just nasty.

Had a little talk with my brother today about some conflicts I discovered over break... I made him promiss me certain things. I promissed him I would come and pick him up from anywhere at any time of night if his ""designated driver"" was a little too tipsy. I do not care if I have a curfew, I just do not want him to get hurt. 

Also referee season started. Sucks because I had to ref a U10 travel girls all by myself. Ahh too much running for me... those suckers run fast. Then my timer died. And yeah that sucked too. Oh well im making $25 an hour, and I will say that is worth the parents screaming at me from the stands.

Sorry you picked your job and have to teach dumbasses for your career. How accomplishing. Thats why I could never be a teacher, always really happy or about to explode. Teachers can be classified into two categories: 

1. Love teaching so much that they are at school 3 hours early. (or)
2. Everytime they see a student they secretly want them to die.

Im telling you there is no gray area. 

So there is my analysis on teachers... kinda strange. Now back to homework... :("

I went over Anglela's house yesterday and she had some people over. We watched Texas Chainsaw Massacre (scary!) and then we watched the video Lauren, Angela, and I made the summer after FRESHMAN year with my pet lobster Chelsey. Yeah I really did not like how I looked then because it was after my surgery...my hair looked like crap, my clothes were way too big for me to hide my scoliosis brace, and I acted completely different than I would now. I was very shy and when I did say something it seemed like it was worthless. I remember that feeling. I just tried to laugh it off when we were watching it; this ramble seemes pretty stupid, but I dont know why anyone was friends with me. I still dont know why. My whole surgery had and has still ruined my self confidence with anything: appreciation of myself, my accomplishments, my social life, my family life...

Raaa that wasnt supposed to turn out sad. Typing these things out helps a lot though. Well we got bored after that and went to jump on the trampoline. That was fun, just my back hurt a little. Then everyone stepped in dog crap and Angela had to vacuum her house. EWWW. good thing I didnt step in any. Everyone had to go home after that cause of the dumb driving curfew at midight. We talked online for a little (esp Angela and Julie acting all horny and all that good stuff to Adam). LOL Adam really needs to have another girl after all his ""conflicts"". 

Too bad Angela was too tired to make our movie! It would have been grrrreat. HAHA no.

My grandma left today, and thank god! She was being so annoying! She thinks she has to tell me EVERYTHING I need to do, and that I am completely disfunctional without her. I guess that is just old people for you, they are so cute. Especially when they eat applesause, it gets all over their face. 

I then went to Jenna's house and drove to downtown Detroit for Sinfonia. It was fun, we had this guest conductor and he was soooo flamboyant I could not stop laughing, just the way he waved around his conducting baton you knew he had a boyfriend at home. It still pisses me off that Mr. Burke keeps me in the middle of the section, when it is clear I deserve a higher chair. WTF. These people cant even play a friggin scale. Hopefully my audition will be sooo good that he just has to put me in the Civic Orchestra!!! wooooo then I can go to Kansas! Yeah, that has just been bugging me for a little, so thats the end of that.

I am not looking forward to going back to school monday. Its dumb. I have a lot of homework and I am just lazy and dont feel like doing it. The good thing is I have had a great spring break! I have seen Angela and Lauren a lot. I still have to pull a prank on Angela for what she did a couple days ago. RAAA. My parents and brother are comming back tomorrow. They need to do my laundry, cause I dont know how. But I miss them too!! I talked to my brother on the phone, I could tell he misses me. Aww how cute. Makes me actually feel a little bad for him.

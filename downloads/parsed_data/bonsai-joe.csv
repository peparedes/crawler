When I'm with you I don't care what else is going on or what other people think. My world is Sofiocentric!! I LOVE YOU!! Yeah!!!

I made this post just to tell everyone how much Sofi means to me. I really don't know what I would do with myself without her. And next year is going to be hell. Which is why it's a good thing that I'll be coming back to visit every weekend and my phone bill will be skyhigh. I love you Sofs!!!!





(Lila... just in case you read this... the love I have for Sofi is a different kind of love than that which I have for you, hehe!)"

I hope that it isn't too late for you to get this email. I haven't been able to go on this computer (the only one with internet) until just now. We've had people over for shiva calls until now, and this computer is in the same room as where my father is sitting.

I've tried to work on my paper, but every time I sit down to write, someone comes and I have to do something. My house is just to crazy now with the shiva, along with all my other homework, (I was just called again to figure out what to do for breakfast tomorrow, mom is leaving early with my sis and my dad can't do any of the work. and I have to wake up earlier than usual, ugh is how I'm feeling...), (ahhhhh! just got called again to take care of the dog...), I simply don't have time to sit down long enough to think and write about this paper.

I'm stressing out so much, I have so much work to do, both for school and for my dad and this shiva business. AHHHHH!

"event","This song reminds me most about Timor... about Timex.. Remember that's what we used to call him? I remember when we called him from Eve's house at her Holloween party and I called him that. He said that he hadn't been called that in a really long time. 2 weeks ago we talked online, promising to talk more often. I've seen him online since, recently in fact, never said anything...
This song is ""Chris Cayton"" by Goldfinger. On their ""Hang-Ups"" CD. Does anybody remember the email he sent us right after he first moved to Florida that had the lyrics from ""San Simeon"", but he changed 'San Simeon' to 'Chicago'? The song said that no matter what happened he would always remember Chicago. This song reminds me of him so much, I taught him out to play guitar, he was good, real good. He had a band down in Florida, gigs and whatnot. More deeper stuff...
Timor... Timor... Timor... I will never forget him. He was my best friend. I hung out with him so much that some of the other people joked that we were gay. Of course we weren't, just best friends. I really don't know what to say. I locked myself in my room since I foung out at 5:30 and have been talking to a few people and crying and sleeping since. Timor was my best friend. I will never forget him. I just don't know what to do anymore...

"event","I was writting an email to Ilana when I realized I had nothing new to say, and instead of writting the same thing over and over, or making the email really short, I figured I would ramble. However... I ended up writing an essay. I figured I might as well post it. hehe. Enjoy, I think.


   Swearing... I once had a conversation about this issue in school with my friends. We were talking about how much some of us swear. And those of us that swear all the time were either told not to swear by their parents when they were younger, or their parents swore all the time. Then I said that my parents never really told me not to swear, at least not that I remember, and Evan said that I never swear. Therefore, it can be concluded that when swearing is present in a household, or even the idea of swearing, then the child will more likely grow up to be a teenager who swears a lot. In a household where swearing isn't used and the idea isn't even a notion, then the child is much less likely to grow up to be a teen who swears.
   But the real question is why does this diffence occur? Evidently, when, in case A, of swearing in the household or being prohibited, the idea is implanted in the head of the child. Then when the child grows up to be a teenager, the rebelious insticts arise and since the prohibition is implanted in their minds, that is one of the first things they start to break. Or they simply feel that it is ok to swear.
On the other hand, the children in case B, of the lack of the notion, are less likely to swear because the idea not to isn't present. When the child becomes a teenager and becomes rebelious, there is no notion that they cannot swear to go against, thus these case B teens feel that there is no need to swear.
   Now, what is the point of all this? If the parents really don't want their child to swear and are concerned about it. If they feel that if they don't say anything then their child will swear freely, the best idea would not be to reinforce the 'no-swear' rule. Alternatively, what should be done, is the complete lack of using any swear words by themselves, and whenever the child uses one (s)he heard from his/her friends, the parents should mildly reprimand. Enough for the child to feel that they did a bad thing, but not enough for them to feel that what they did was horrible and that they should never do it again.
   In Vayikra 19, pasuk 15, it says that if you see your fellow doing something improper, you should reprimand him, but not incur guilt and thereby a sin upon urself. What does this mean? This means that, as parents, you shouldn't tell your child that swearing is wrong all the time and then later on he/she'll swear all the time and therefore you will be sinful. But you should gently tell your child not to swear, so that the child feels it is wrong, but will not have a desire to rebel against the notion later."

"event","HHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH. I doubt my parents will let me go up and see Ilana. This is the happiest day of my life! Asides from when I actually find out they wont let me and have to tell her. That will surely be the happiest time. Don't you love it when everything works out perfectly? My plan has been going so well! It looks like everything is going to work out!!!



Note... if you take everything that was positive and good and happy in the paragraph above, and turn it upside down, ram a concrete dildo up its ass, light it on fire and throw it out a window and over the Niagra Falls, you would know exactly how I really feel.

Thank you..."

"event","so....the Halloween Party was awesome. i wish i took pics. My sugarlips was so effing hot and adorable as Pencilious Von Kampft. Marcie was a cute and innocent witch. Junie was a girl from the movie Sweet Sixteen...or was it Sixteen Candles?? i dont know, you know june and her movies ;-) and she was pretty. I think Ami was a purple tinkerbell. Tricia was a PapaJohn's delivery driver... haha. (when i first saw her i thought she was Bill ;-O) Laura was an awesome vampire fairy. Dean had kool demon horns. James was a Samurai Warrior and brought a real sword to work...asshat. Will Kane was Captain Nintendo!!! everytime i think about him i laugh. no offense will, you just remind me how much i love my dorky brother-in-law. ;-) Will Johnson tried on Morty's hot dog suit and joey mask but didn't wear it for long. Morty was Joey before I showed up. And Sean, well...i feel bad cuz he got stuck at work but he came home and got drunk with the rest of us!!!  Yeah, i downed like 3 1/2 glasses of alcohol and was trashed. And YES I AM A LIGHT-WEIGHT but oh well...i had an awesome time. I just wish i was there when Will J shot the dots through the mail slot in the front door to the kids! i heard it was freaking hilarious. oh well. oh, i forgot about me. i was a cute goth school girl. i freaked out at first because i didn't think anything was going right, but everything went perfect, except for me falling around acting like a fool, but that's me!! ;-P i love hanging out with all the people i love, it just feels great. i always have a great time. lets hope that parties at the new house will continue. anyway, thank you everyone for being awesome! love u all!

And to my honey... thankyou for taking care of me, without you, i would've been on the front lawn ;-)  you're freakin awesome. i can't wait to spend the rest of my years with you. <3"

"event","when i was a little girl, i use to get hit/beat ALOT for anything and everything, and shit i didn't even do. i had to deal with this for 10 1/2 years. ""NIGGER LOVER! FAT BITCH! WHORE! SLUT! WHITE TRASH! TRAILER TRASH! YOU'RE GONNA BE JUST LIKE YOUR MOTHER, A FUCKING WHORE WHO WILL NEVER AMOUNT TO ANYTHING!"" those are some of the words that i would hear everyday. whenever i heard that tone come from someone, i would always start crying and try to hide, cuz i knew that i was going to get a beaten. either choked against and up the wall until i lost the feeling in my toes, beaten til i couldn't feel my back anymore, or punched until i couldn't see. this would be a daily routine....until we left to come to maine, when i was 16. 
i never got read to when i was younger. i never had friends, except when i had to get along with the daughters of my mother's new boyfriend. i was never shown affection. i had to dream of things i wanted to do when i grew up and who i thought i wanted to be. i was a big dreamer.
i always told myself that i would never lie, cheat, or be a nobody. alot of good that did me. i have become what i swore myself i would never be.
i can't figure out who i am. because i have seen so many things, and have been through so many situations, i just dont know how to think for myself. i always have to have someone tell me what to do because that's what im use to. ""dont tell wayne that we were over dave's, he'd kill me"" ""you better not say anything, or i'll beat the living shit out of you"" ""come on you stupid fucking bitch, if you break that tooth brush, im gonna make u clean that floor with you god damn tongue! now starting scrubbing, you low-life whore""
im so tired....
im just ready to give up
im going nowhere.
i never will
i will always be the child that never got a fair shot at life."

why are people so mad at me?

this is to no one in general....but seriously, whatever i do, it's not good enough. i try and try and try to do what i think is right and i get nowhere. i can never do anything right in anyone's eyes. there's always something for me to get yelled at. no matter where i go...there's always negativity. and people want to know why im so negative all the time...well....my house has it, my whole family has it, school has it, work has it...and my bird...she's always sqwauking at me.

anyway...im tryin to be good with everyone. im tryin to be nice to everyone. i don't like being hated by other people and i don't like hating people. that's not how i want to live my life. i just want a life without all this shit in it...for once in my life!

When the Goverment started telling people to stock up on duck tape, you were waaaaaaaaaay ahead of them. 

You walk into someone's house and people are sitting around smoking what they call ""the garden""

On one side of the road there's Wal-Mart and on the other is a cotton field

"event","Friday was my rehearsal for graduation. i raced my friend Rusty on toilet racecars and i won. and i raced sarah through a blowup maze thing. well, the fabric caught my glasses and flung them across the maze thing; so i lost that one. and i have two skin burns; one on my right arm and one on my face. oh well, i had fun anyway.

Saturday was my dinner and dance. i looked super hot!! omg, i don't think i've ever looked that good. (no, im not conceited) the dinner was awesome and i danced my ass off. i had soooo much fun...after, i went home and went to sleep. had to be up at 7 to get ready for graduation. got home and called morty to wish him and marcy a happy 1 year anniversary! congrats guys!

Sunday, got up at 7, got ready (looked good again). drove to the whittemore center, near UNH. waited with my college friends until i saw my family. my mom, aunt, grandmother and her boyfriend, and my grandfather showed up. then about an hour later, junie showed up. and then it was time for walking. walked down the 40 steps to get to the bottom. walked and sat down where i sat for an hour and a half because people wouldn't shut the hell up! god! i didn't listen to a damn word they said. BLAH, BLAH, BLAH! and Andrew Card, the Secretary of State, talked for a damn hour and 10 minutes! damn you for making me stupider!

i kept looking up to see my family and june sitting there next to me cheering me on. and then ryan showed up. yay!  he looked so tired, everyone i knew sitting next to me was laughing cause he looked like he was gonna pass out. but it was all good. then it was time for me to walk up.......i was so nervous. my legs were shaking and i thought i was gonna fall cause i didn't eat anything before i went. the lady said my name right, i shook Andrew Card's hand and walked toward the back. a lady took my picture with me chewing my gum and looking at my fake diploma. it'll be a bad picture. had to walk to the back to get the professional pictures done. i look up and saw this lady waving at me and this guy next to her was standing up with a camera. i was like, who the hell is waving at me? so i looked behind me and there was noone there. 

""Meaghan! It's dad!""    OMG!!!!!!   i never thought in a million years that my dad would be there. of course the waterfalls turned on and i was the next one up to have my picture taken. and of course, it lookedlike shit. i didn't care, my dad was there!

after everything, everyone got together at Weathervane and had an awesome time. you couldn't even tell that they hate eachother, they got along so well. 

THAT WAS THE BEST GRADUATION EVER!  

and i received many gifts and $170!
($100 from my dad, $50 from my grandfather and $20 from my  grandmother and her boyfriend.)

i just want to say thankyou to everyone who came and made my day the best day of my life!

i love you guys!

i'm sorry for the rest who couldn't come.......though i was thinking about you."

"event","Lord, don't you know she's my angel
You got plenty of your own
And I know you hold a place for her
But she's already got a home
Well I don't know if you're listenin'
But praying is all that's left to do
So I ask you Lord have mercy, you lost a son once too

And it must be kind of crowded,
On the streets of Heaven.
So tell me: what do you need her for?
Don't you know one day she'll be your little girl forever.
But right now I need her so much more.
Lord, I know once you've made up your mind,
There's no use in beggin'.
So if you take her with you today, will you make sure she looks both ways,
And would you hold her hand when she crosses the streets of Heaven.

rest in peace
i love you grandma

This is freaky as HELL... DO NOT 
CHEAT 
(You'll kick yourself later) I was a little 
skeptical trying this, but if you follow the 
instructions to the ""t"" you'll be surprised!!!! 

All of my answers were accurate. We'll see 
tomorrow if the wish comes true. I'll let you 
know. Take 3 minutes and try this...it will 
freak you out! The person who sent it to me said 
her wish came true 10 minutes after they read 
the 
mail. BUT NO CHEATING! This game has a 
funny/spooky outcome. 

Don't read ahead...just do it in order! It takes 
about three minutes...it's worth a try :) 

First..get a pen and paper. When you actually 
choose names, make sure it's people you actually 
know and go with your first instinct. 

Scroll down one line at a time...and don't read 
ahead or you'll ruin it! ""

1. First, write the numbers 1 through 11 in a 
column. 














2. Then, beside numbers 1 and 2, write down any 
two numbers you want. 












3. Beside the 3 and 7, write down friends of 
members of the opposite sex that you know. 












NO LOOKING AHEAD...OR IT WON""T TURN OUT RIGHT! 




4. Write anyone's name (like friends or 
family....) in the 4th, 5th, 

and 6th spots. 












5. Write down four song titles in 8,9,10, and 11. 












GO WITH YOUR INSTINCT PEOPLE!!!! 




6. Finally, make a wish. 













And now the key for the game..... 






1. You must tell (the number in space 2) people 
about this game. 













2. The person in space 3 is the one that you 
love. 












3. The person in 7 is one you like but can't 
work out. 












4. You care most about the person you put in 4. 













5. The person you name in number 5 is the one 
who knows you very well. 













6. The person you name in 6 is your lucky star. 













7. The song in 8 is the song that matches with 
the person in number 3. 












8. The title in 9 is the song for the person in 7 














9. The tenth space is the song that tells you 
most about YOUR mind. 













10. and 11 is the song telling you how you feel 
about life 




NOW...post this bulletin within the 
hour... IF you do.. 
your wish will come true... 
If you don't it will become the opposite.""

Tuesday I am fading
And by Wednesday I cant sleep
Then my phone rings
I hear you
The darkness is a clear view
I see youve come to rescue me

Fall with you I fall so fast
I can hardley catch my breathe

"event","Dear Jamie,
I cant even remember the day that me and you first laid eyes on each other .. but I know that as soon as it happened it was a friendship made in heaven. From exchanging gifts EVERY christmas to you not wanting to leave your parents in 1st grade... all the times you would get mad at me and lock me out of your room.. falling in boxes...taking down your swing set, playing Barbies,power rangers, swimming in your pool. I remember i would come over and rusty would jump on me. Me and you always dress up and I even put on ur moms wedding dress! she was so pissed lol every time i look back on the past there is always a memory with you. I dont remember not knowing you! COuld u just imagine if one of us would have moved into a diff area? WE never would have met and my entire life would be completely different. STILL together  to this day! If u were not on this earth.. My soul would b ripped out and my heart would go along with it. You cross my mind 24/7 and your family is my family.. u were ther for me when my parents got divorced .. and when my family members passed away.. and u were the reason I needed stitches in my lip for running into the corner of the wall. but i wasnt even mad at you I still loved you and I always will i dont know how else to say it jme u make me who i am.. the Christine Marie Cichowski! We shaped each others lifes growing up.. and we are gonna grow older .. and get married and have kids .. and we will STILL b talking...STILL b crying... and laffing and singing! God puts you on earth to complete a journey and once you fulfill your journey god takes u to heaven. There is no way i can fulfill my journey without my Jamie Lynn! People say oh so and so is my best friend but i dont think anyone even knos what a best friend is. When I say ""Jamie you're my best friend"" its so truthful and its life longgg. I love you. I thank god for bringing you to me. (( Christine and Jamie Best Friends Forever))

Love christine

you wrote that to me.. :/:/"

Everything I know about breaking hearts 
I learned from you, it's true 
I've never done it with the style and grace you have 
But I've made long term plans 
based on these mistakes"

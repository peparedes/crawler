"event","Earlier today I finished reading <a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16799/16799-h/16799-h.htm"" target=""_blank"">Dangerous Ages</a> by Rose Macaulay.  While not perfect, it's a diamond in the rough, chock full of exploration of relationships (romantic, platonic, mother-child), aging, and some of the social issues of the time.  (Free love, psychoanalysis, women's education, and the like.)

In the same year that <cite>Dangerous Ages</cite> was published, Virginia Woolf wrote about a meeting with Macaulay in her diary.
<blockquote> Rose Macaulay dined here last week - something like a lean sheep-dog in appearance - harum-scarum-humble - too much of a professional, yet just on the intellectual side of the border. Might be religious though; mystical perhaps. Not at all dominating or impressive; I daresay she observes more than one thinks for. Clear, pale, mystical eyes. A kind of faded beauty; oh badly dressed. I don't suppose we shall ever meet for she lives with Royde-Smith, & somehow won't come to grips with us.</blockquote>

Royde-Smith was Naomi Royde-Smith, an editor.  An <a href=""http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,975703,00.html"" target=""_blank"">article</a> concerning a biography of Dame Rose has this to say:
<blockquote>One of the secrets that LeFanu investigates, but doesn't solve, is whether the secret affair [with Gerald O'Donovan, a lapsed Irish priest, himself a novelist, a married man who never left his wife and children but incorporated Rose into his family life], with no hope of children, was particularly suited to a woman whose sexuality was ""ambivalent"". As a child, she wanted to be a naval captain; many of her heroines are boyish or androgynous; she shared a house for a time with the literary editor Naomi Royde-Smith, de la Mare's lover. LeFanu deals with her subject's sexuality rather tentatively; she doesn't say whether she thinks Macaulay was bisexual or not. (I would have liked to know more, for instance, about her attitude to Radclyffe Hall's The Well of Loneliness, which she was prepared to defend.)</blockquote>

That explains some of the complicated relationships in <cite>Dangerous Ages</cite>.  In addition to a number of novels, Macaulay wrote a <a href=""http://www.blupete.com/Literature/Essays/Best/MacaulayRCatch.htm"" target=""_blank"">lovely essay</a> about language, gender, how we use words and how we seek to manipulate with them.  It's called ""Catchwords and Claptrap.""

<blockquote>This fantastical currency, minted by the requirements of human thought and feeling, circulated by the urgent desire we have to convey these somehow to our fellows, so precisely, so delicately wrought and cast into exact and minute forms ...</blockquote>

Finally, Anglican Barbara Reynolds <a href=""http://copies.anglicansonline.org/churchtimes/000910/feat.htm"" target=""_blank"">speculates</a> about a connection between Macaulay and Dorothy Sayers.  Interesting reading.

D.L. Ashiman's <a href=""http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/folktexts.html"" target=""_blank"">Folktexts</a> collects a number of fairy and folk tales, including <a href=""http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/perrault.html"" target=""_blank"">Charles' Perrault's tales</a> from the original Mother Goose book.  (The versions you're probably most familiar with have been, well, Disneyfied or sanitized, in some cases.)

I've started reading Nicholas de Caen's Dizain des Reines <a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11752/11752-h/11752-h.htm"" target=""_blank"">in translation</a>.  de Caen was a Frenchman writing about English events, particularly, at least in the part I've read so far, English nobles, and he seems to have had little affection for them.  (Particularly Eleanor of Aquitaine.)

Today's <a href="""" target=""_blank"">must strangle</a> article: 
<blockquote>""According to a report in the city's Globe and Mail newspaper, French said women did not make it to the top because ""they're crap.""

Nancy Vonk, a Toronto-based creative director at WPP subsidiary Ogilvy & Mather who attended the event, said French described women as ""a group that will inevitably wimp out and go 'suckle something.'""</blockquote>

Though apparently, the guy <a href=""http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1835800,00.html"" target=""_blank"">denied</a> saying that, at least initially.  And yet he resigned.

In a <a href=""http://www.azstarnet.com/dailystar/dailystar/99156.php"" target=""_blank"">similar vein</a>, a woman who was raped was encountered several pharmacies and pharmacists who couldn't or wouldn't fill her scrip for the morning after pill regimen.  Hmm, Tucson's probably off the list of places I'd like to live.  (Why support those attitudes by living there?)

<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/22/AR2005102201072.html"" target=""_blank"">This</a> is amusing.  For your reading pleasure, I've extracted the most amusing bits:
<blockquote>They traded their opening day starter, Tim Rattay, to the Buccaneers for the equivalent of four magic beans. That surpasses in lameness the Bucs' earlier deal for Luke McCown. And the Dolphins swapped onetime starter A.J. Feeley to the Chargers for Cleo Lemon, who I believe had a big hit in the early '90s with ""No Rain."" Or was it that cover of ""Mrs. Robinson""? ... One of these days, Falcons Coach Jim Mora is going to go crazy during a postgame news conference just like his old man used to. Man, that would be sweet.</blockquote>

Also, yesterday Hines Ward scored a touchdown, and imitated Chad Johnson's celebratory riverdance.  (Chad Johnson is a Bengal, and the Steelers were playing Cinci.)  Supposedly, even the defensive players were amused by this.  (Though it may have been because Hines isn't much of a dancer.)  ESPN showed the footage of Chad's dance and Hines' dance side by side, and hilarity ensued.

The art gallery Dada Moxie (or maybe it's Moxie Dada) in Bloomfield has a neat gallery of dinosaurs.  And they still have the cute cat."

"event","So...  I have been working as a travel agent for the last 3 weeks, or at least training to be one.  I gave Intelesure the middle finger on November 9.  Stupid fuckers.  And I started my new career at Carlson Leisure Travel on November 10.  I have to say that I am actually EXCITED to work there.  The GDS system that we use to ticket seems incredibly easy.  My fellow trainee classmates seem it is necessary to give me shit for picking up on how to do things so quickly.  Oh well.  All I know is that 5 weeks of training is way too much for me.  I felt ready to go on the floor at the end of the first week.  Crazy enough, we still have two weeks left and then 4 weeks of OJT.  Gah.  This job still seems as though it will be worth it.  I am making 2 more dollars an hour than I was at Intelesure, which is NICE.  Plus, I get commision at this job.  Not to mention all the perks like $750 a year to use toward a familiarization trip AND $350 to use toward any airline ticket of your choice.  I am super excited to go to Japan and I know this job will help me get there.  If all goes well, I should be able to go for my birthday in April.  *squeals with excitement*  I have to say that I am happier than I have been in a long time."

"event","Yeah.  I haven't been on here in like forever.  Damn you myspace!  It eats your soul!

Anyway, i have a libido again, and it is awesome!

I've been having a real period for the last 3 weeks.  Lame.

Brian tried to stick his hand down my shirt Saturday night.  I squealed and put my hand up in protest.  Why?  I don't know, but if he tries it again, I will let him.

I have been more tired lately than usual...which is pretty difficult to pull off.

Becca's son doesn't recognize me anymore.  :(

I have been flirting with someone from Nampa like hardcore over the last few days.

My car is being kind of stupid.

I got offered a trip to Japan by an older Japanese business man who thinks I am hotter than liquid hot magma.  lol

Miyav's new album fucking rocks! (As well as Perfume's)

That's about it for me."

"event","I never realized how daunting it is to find a job.  I usually have no problem with it, but I guess since all I need is a second job, one won't just come to me.  I applied for the sales associate position Dillards has open in their lingerie department and now I have to schedule a time to get down there and fill out the little online thingy-ma-bob.

The new car is working out fine for the most part.  The financial side is a little bit insane though.  I knew what I was going to be taking on, but you never really how horrendous things will be until they happen. The scary thing is it's only going to get worse.  I still have to buy insurance for it.  My mom is paying for this month, but that's it.  I am so scared that I am going to have to starve myself for the next 2 months until I get my laptop paid off.  

Blargh.

So here is how my finances will pan out after I get my own insurance:

   1150
 -  325 - rent
---------
    825
 -  180 - car
----------
    645
 -  100 - insurance
----------
    545
 -  200 - laptop
----------
    345
 -   50 - cell
----------
    295
 -  200 - Anthony
----------
     95

So, I am left with about a hundred bucks a month to live off of.  Can you say ""Fuck!"" boy and girls?  I knew that you could.  :P  That adds up to $15 a week for food and the rest for gas.  Man, I cannot wait until my laptop os paid off...or until I get a second job.

I had a crazy dream about Anthony this morning.  It really made me reassess my feelings and think about how much things have changed over the last year.  *sigh*  I don't know anything anymore I guess."

"event","I know no one reads this...since only about 4 people know it exists...  But anyway, I have not visited LJ since about mid-January and I thought maybe I should see what everyone is up to.  

I am currently not doing anything exciting as of recent.  Work was UBER stressful today and just plain shitty.
My car is still being stupid.  I put $20 worth of gas in it on Tuesday and guess what??  I'm almost on empty again.  To that I say: What the fuck car?!?!?!!!?!!1/1?
Speaking of things that make you go wtf...  I had started filling out my taxes and noticed that I might not get back more than $300.  Sad...very very sad.  I made more money this year and last year I got back almost $700.  So, IRS, what the fuck???!!!1!1!!!?11?1//?  I wanted to get enough money back to actually make a difference in my life, but I guess I won't be that lucky.
Maybe I should think about getting a loan to get another car.  I just can't fathom the condition in which my vehicle might be in a month from now.  *sigh*
On somewhat more exciting (but not really) news...  I left for work about 20 minutes early on Tuesday to stop by WalMart and purchase Corpse Bride on DVD...  Lo and behold, the one day I leave for work early, I get pulled over. Yadda yadda yadda, I was about 5 minutes late for work.
Fuck man.  Life is just too damn irritating sometimes."

"event","I, like Ms Felony Texas, have started looking for another job.  However, I feel too guilty to just quit Intelesure all together.  So, I have applied for another FULL TIME job at Saia as a data entry bitch.  I think they called me back today but all the message said was to call Chris Smith at blah-bitty-blah number.
We'll see.  
I am the brokest I have been since I was unemployeed last year.  How is that possible?  It is probably the fact that I have just taken on an extra $225-a-month responsibility.  I really thought I could handle the rent out here, but it is definitely proving me wrong. Okay, so I make $1000 a month... $325 to rent, $210 laptop, $55 cell, $60 gas...Where is the rest going?  For a while I was spending $30 a week on antifreeze because it has been disappearing from inside my radiator...and it's not leaking.  I have said ""fuck that"" and have stopped buying antifreeze all together.  
I don't know.  There is no way I have been spending over $300 in food each month.  It just doesn't make sense.  And now I need a new car, new clothes since my have become quite ragged, etc.  I don't know what to do.  This has been one of those months (well, 2 months) that makes you rethink all of your priorities.  Fuckity.  Maybe I just feel like this from only getting an hour of sleep before work this morning....maybe.

"event","Yeah.  I'm tired.  What a long/short weekend.  I am finally reading the Harry Potter books...granted I only got through about 15 pages in The Sorceror's Stone today, but that was a good start.  And if you notice what time it is...I should be asleep, but no.  I slept from 11am-3pm and took a nap from 10:30pm-12:30am.  Yeah.  I am really lackin' on the sleep.  I need to force myself to take Sominex like everyday after I get home from work so I will get maybe 8 hours of sleep.  I really long for sleep.
Anyway, here is a post from my myspace blog...back-dated to 12/27....deal with it.

PS  I hate it when people steal things out of your car.  I'm out about $80 now.  FUCK!


*********************************************************************************************


Not a lot going on lately....  My car is a piece of shit and likes to explunge all of its anitfreeze every few days.  I have no idea what its problem is, but it can stop that anytime soon.  I have now been up for 24 hours...  not the longest I have stayed up, but since I only sleep about 3 hours everynight, this really sucks.  I got 13 hours of sleep yesterday.  Maybe I needed it.... well, of course I did.  One cannot live off of cat naps alone.  I think lack of sleep will be the death of me.  It has been making me physically ill and pretty damn depressed.  I believe it was also the cause of my 5-week long period a few weeks ago.  I know, that may not sound that unusual, but keep in mind I can go two years without mensturating....which is also weird but I have come to terms with that.  Of course, I do believe I am incapable of having children due to some problem down there...but I do not have insurance or enough money to go get checked out. Blargh.  

Anyway, everything sucks....  I miss hanging out with everyone...  I miss Holli and Aubrey...  I haven't seen my best friend since her birthday on 11/10...  I am a horrible person.  But with my car acting up and the fact that I now live 20 miles away from Boise, I can't bring myself to drive out there to spend maybe one hour with someone.  

And the thought of getting married has re-entered my brain.  I got kind of depressed while looking at jewelry at Fred Myers with Anthony and Brian last week.  I know I will never get married, but I still have some sort of hope that I am holding on to.  It would be pointless for someone to get me a ring anyway... I'm allergic to metal.  Besides, there must be something so terribly wrong with me that no one has ever had a true interest in me.  I have never been on a real date, never been asked out, never had a boyfriend, never been loved back.  I suck.  That's the bottom line...  Even the most evil and murderous of people can find love...but me?  Nope.  Ain't gonna happen.

So that's that.  I am not going to say anymore for the time being.  I hate myself and I hate life because I don't know how to better things."

Having a stupid EMO moment.  I was looking through Casey Pound's profile (say hi to your mom for me) and of course, I started to think about senior year.  *insert flashback effect via Wayne and Garth*  Things were so awesome then...especially around this time of year.  FCCLA, A Cappella, football games, soccer games, actually being involved in school for once....  I never would have experienced those things if it wasn't for someone I considered a dear friend back then.  If you know me well, you know who I am talking about.  

I feel like I am missing out on life without him as a friend.  He always knew about exciting things to do and where all the cool kids would be.  I guess I just wasn't cool enough to stay in that crowd.  It doesn't really come down to the cool crowd or popularity or anything, I just miss him.  He helped me come out of my self-loathing shell enough to enjoy life for the first time.  Where would I be today if he hadn't taken the time to become part of my life?  I don't know if I would even be alive.  Maybe I am giving him too much credit, but I seriously doubt it.

It would be nice if he would at least tell me if we are still friends.  I have tried to establish some means of communication on here, but to no avail.  What is going on?  If you hate me, let me know so I can stop believing we will be friends again someday."

For Christmas, I would like to see Gackt perform his Christmas Eve concert in Tokyo.  Just imagine being able to see Gackt make out with You and rub himself in person!!!  Oh the joy!  Too bad it is just a little out of my price range...almost $3000 for a round trip.  It's nice to dream though....

<TD>You have SEVERE self-esteem issues. I would suggest you do in fact kill yourself, and save some oxygen for the rest of us. However, an alternative could be to find a goal. For instance, you might want to try, 'making it through another day'. Or, more inspiringly, 'making a friend'. As much as you would like to think so, animals are not as good as people, and have a hard time recognising themselves in the mirror. I would personally suggest you force yourself to go out more. </TD></TR>

"event","So, I must be pretty deprived or something.  I have no idea what has come over my thoughts lately, but my dream this morning was pretty intense.  I don't feel the need to share the somewhat scary parts in which someone is trying to kill me.  That seems to occur in every dream of recent.  I will, however, share the disturbing and dirty details.  :)

It was late in the evening.  Panda Charmer and I were sitting on the couch downstairs at his house.  We were watching a movie though I cannot remember what it was.  PC turns to me and smiles.
""What?"" I ask.
""Nothing.""
""You are.""
""Am I?"" A typical response.
We go back to staring at the TV.  A few moments later, he turns to me again.
""Hey.  Can I..."" he trails off.
""Can you what?"" I reply.
PC scoots closer to me, which is weird in itself.  He finally get out his request.  PC asks is he can feel my boobs.  I didn't have an answer.  I just giggled since it was not a request I never thought he would ask.
PC moves even closer, our thighs brush against each other.  He slowly slides a hand up my blouse while the other takes advantage of the situation and goes between my legs.  Thank God his hands knew what to do because he did not know how to kiss. 
The rest seemed to happen so fast. We pulled off each others clothes as we slid to floor. I don't know what possessed me to want to be on top for the sex, but I was and it was PHENOMINAL!  We must gone for at least an hour...which is very long time since no guy has ever last more than 15 minutes with me.
A few days later, I came across some photos of that night.  I don't know where they came from or who took them, but they were freaking hot.  As I am leafing through the glossy images, PC walks in.  What a supreeese. (Don't ask)  So, we go for it again.  It wasn't quite as hot as the first time...especially since Numero Uno walks in on us.  Oops.  But that wasn't necessarily a bad thing because he joined in.  Weird, I know.  But it was hot.   We were on the floor and they were kneeling in front of me, kissing my neck and groping my chest....  Ah yes....  Hot-ness was in abundance.

My dream was a lot more VIVID than that, but you guys get the picture.


By the way...thank you brain, for making me more confused than I was. :P  Stupid brain, I don't need you, useless gray/pink wrinkled glob."

So, what a shitty day.  I don't know if it just the utter lack of sleep that is making me depressed or what.  Today sucked so much at work.  Being half asleep doesn't help for one thing...or coming in at 6am.  It is nice to know that big corporations like Delphi, General Motors, Alcoa, ConAgra Foods, Pfizer and so forth, put off all their fire pump/sprinkler/alarm system tests until the last day of the month.  I had about 30 faxes to enter into the computer, along with the 55 voicemails.  PLUS I had to get today's callbacks finished before leaving.  Fuck.  I was just so inundated with data entry and phone calls.

On top of that irritation, it just seems like I will always be stuck on this loveless path for eternity.  I wish I could find someone who will take a chance on me.  I am sure a lot of you girls can only imagine the detriment I  feel...never knowing what a relationship feels like, or how it feels to be needed by someone.  So empty.  My life is a huge obsidian void that will never be filled.

 

What is wrong with me?!?"

"event","Since the birth of my ""nephew,"" I have never been more paranoid in my life about being pregnant.  Of course one of the ""pee on a stick"" tests said I wasn't but I really feel like I am.  I guess it would just explain a lot of changes that my body has gone through over the last few months.
Plus, even though it would be incredibly inconvient, I would really love to have a child sometime soon.  Charlie is gonna need someone his own age to play with and I am sure Becca's sister isn't planning on getting knocked up anytime soon.  So, the idea has come up at work that I try to seduce one of my guy friends.  Ha. Yeah right.  Me seduce someone? Highly unlikely.  But it would be nice I suppose."

"event","So, I stayed home today because I am sick.  I pretty much slept all day.  Odd thing is I had a different dream every time I went back to sleep.  The first one was so weird.  Brian and I were walking around Borah, running into tons of kids I knew.  We would stop and talk to pretty much everyone and I ended up kissing a few of the guys along the way.  Brian turned to me after the third kiss was like ""What the hell is up with that?""  I told him that I make out with all the boys.  He got all jealous and was like ""Except me.""  So, Brian and I kissed, pretty passionately mind you, for 2 or 3 minutes.  Then we were pretty much inseparable from then on.  We kept walking around, talking to my former classmates, but we held hands and every once-in-a-while we would kiss again and just hold each other.
                       FIN


GAAAAHHH!!!!  I woke up thinking ""Stupid brain!  I'm already conflicted enough!""  Being sick makes me think of random things I guess.  I have the lamest fever ever.  I took some tylenol, but it didn't help at all.  So, I am sweating but I start freezing if I don't have a blanket on.  LAME!!!!!"

"event","*Copied from an email I sent to Anthony about my day*  

So... I had the most insane phone conversation after work today.  I was sitting in the living room, elbow deep in pumpkin guts and the phone rings.  I didn't get up because I had crap on my hands, plus I figured it was for Zane.  My dad comes out and says it Becca.  I carefully get up and go to the phone. I ask Becca what's what up and she asks me if I am sitting down.  So, I sit and ask WTF is going on?  She informs me that hasn't been feeling well for a couple of weeks but didn't think anything of it.  Yesterday, she was having some really bad cramping and went to the doctor.  Lo and behold, she was pregnant....  but, that's not all...she was already having contractions at only 7 months.  SSSOOO, Becca gave birth to little boy this morning at 1:18.  I did ask her MULTIPLE times if she was shitting me and she said she wasn't.  I even said I would call her mom and ask if it was true.  She said that was fine, I could talk her right then if I wanted to since she was sitting next to Becca.  I figured that was proof enough for me.  Becca would never make up something like that and stick to it if I threatened to tell her mom or dad.  I didn't ask her how much the baby weighed or anything, I was little in shock.  She said his name is Charles Alexander, not what Becca had always said she would name her first son, but whatever, and she'll be out of the hospital on Thursday.  I plan on going to St Al's tomorrow after work to see her.  Fun.  Definitely no moving out now and I am going to try to help out with the baby as much as possible.  I am really worried for Becca.  She definitely was not ready for something like this and didn't even see it coming...and what perfect timing too.  Her dad gets shipped off to Iraq next week for 2 years.  I still have some doubt about the situation, but Becca never giggled, snickered, or laughed once... plus she would have called right back to tell me it was joke.  This is just so bizarre!!!!!!!"

I too have been getting into making flash files.  I have 3 vids under my belt and I have had this program for only 24 hours.  I am pretty impressed with how quickly I am picking it up.  I  might even bring my laptop to work tomorrow to see if I can make a panda related thing.  :)  We'll see though.

There is SO much crap going on at work.  We haven't been able to do any regular campaigns.  We've been helping out on the radio things.  All the leads that we got on Tuesday didn't save into the system...so Tiffany and I have been spending a few hours each day listening to all the recordings and saving the important info into Excel.

Plus, Dustin was going to show us how to use this program called Seibel for the GE campaign we start on Monday....but their system was down.  Plus, GE was so confident in our abilities, they fired their in-house call center reps.  What a bunch of dumbasses.  We haven't gotten to use their system yet and they fire their employees?  God damn it.  So, they actually wanted us to start taking calls for them TOMORROW...but we haven't done any more training than a stupid webex meeting...looking at some slides of sprinklers and shit.  Gosh the stress....

There was a total of 5 people on the call: Dave(one of our project managers), 3 CEO's from the company who hired us, and myself.  I got to run through the client's script with one of the big wigs while he pretended to be a prospect.

Working at Intelesure was going alll dandy and shit, but I decided to look for a second job.  I stopped by JIB becuz I wanted a chicken sandwich.  Oddly enough, Tammie and Mike were there.  Tammie came into the dining room and asked me if I was looking for a job.  I said it would depend on how much someone was willing to pay and I told her how much I make at Intelesure.  She said she would think about it and walked back into the kitchen.  Well, Mikey came out and said they desperately needed the help and said he would talk to Tammie.  He went back to speak with Tammie.  A few minutes later, he reappeared with a slip of paper.  ""This is how much we are willing to pay you,"" and he handed me the paper.  Written in bold, Sharpie-like marker was ""$100/hr"".  I just about crapped myself.  I was like ""Do I have to fill out an application still?""  Tammie said I did.  Bitch.  LOL  Then suddenly, Koda Kumi, in JIB uniform, pushes me so she can go out the door to have a cigarette.

End scene

Weird dream, huh?  I don't know why Koda Kumi was there at the end considering I wasn't even listening to music during my nap today.  Oh well."

"event","So, I had a dream where Johnny Depp was my boyfriend.  IT was freaking awesome.  Everyone was so jealous and girls were constantly being so nice to me in hopes I would share the Johnny.  I think not.  It was a lovely dream though.

I had another dream last night about school. The class of '03 was going to Seattle for a small vacation.  Becca was supposed to pick me up so we could drive there together.  She just parked in front of my house for about 10 seconds, honked her horn and drove off.  I was so upset.  Then my folks tell me they are going up there to watch the kids but won't take me with them.  So, I end up somehow riding my bike all the way there.  All of my classmates were complete asses to me...except Rich.  He was nice enough to talk to me a few times, and try to get me to sleep with him.

Interesting dreams.  Guess that's what happens when I haven't been sleeping long enough to dream for over two months.  Sadness.

On another note, I got Brian's b-day present today.  The cd/dvd didn't even get shipped until Friday....  and it was from Japan.  I am impressed."

No, seriously....

I hate me.  I hate myself so much.  I know, I am whining.  As soon as I have enough guts to find a fucking piece of glass, maybe there will be less of the whining.  Damn it....  I know, my counselors always told me to pick up a pencil instead, but glass is SO much more gratifying.  Of course, the other day at work, I was trying to use the chewed up end of my pen to dig into my wrist.  FUN!!!!  Oh the suicidal-ness is so abounding lately.  Not that anyone fucking cares, but I write about it anyway.  At least then I am not just saying it out loud to myself.

Holy shit...  My entries on diaryproject.com and still searchable....  They're SO old!!!  If anyone wants to read them, you just have to go to advanced search options and type in ""eddie izzard"" for the author and there I am.  Maybe I will read them before I pass out.

Fuck it all."

"event","Things are...blah I guess.  I need to get a new job.  Next week, our workload is just going to be unbearable and I am scared...scared that I won't be strong enough to not randomly quit because of the stress.  We'll see I suppose.

So, I have been making myself angry lately, in case no one had noticed.  I am trying to force myself out of a state of mind I was in, which was a good state for me, but I fear it was hurting the other person.  In order to change my mindset, I have been trying to make up excuses and tell myself lies about them and hope that I can convince myself to believe them.  Yeah, it's total bull shit, but it's probably in the best interest of the other person.  And so, I have been kind of on edge lately, trying to make myself hate(or like less) someone that I love so dearly.  But, I have to let go of them in order to give up on such things as love, hope, companionship, etc. completely.  It isn't fair...but it is something I must do I suppose.

Anyway...yeah...  life is hell and I am always conflicted with myself.  It's really not worth putting up with.  I'm writting any wills or testaments...just contemplating.

I need to find my purpose..............if I have one."

Just been busy!

I need feedback on the tracks I have been producing. 
I am releasing a Minimal Electro CD in Feb 2007, and need some feedback.

The two tracks I am recently working on are: ""Dirty Fnck"" & Don't Spread It"".

With that CD will be a ""Randoms"" CD that will include all of my drum & bass, breakbeat, and downtempo tracks.
As well as some mix cds.

Please send me feedback to my myspace page (where my music is located) or my email.

Thank you!
Happy Holidays!

"event","been a long time, been a long time, been a lonely lonely lonely lonely time (minus the lonely...teehee)

But it has been a while.

Lots have changed

starting my own business through another company in the next three months....
A multi-million dollar man is flying out in his private jet to help me set myself free, and get me started in this (I am super nervous about it, I need to buy some suits! EEEEEK).

This all popped on my suddenly and out of the no-where, but my cousin got me started in it.

And shit... I am not going to turn away an oppurtunity to possibly make $200,000.00 - $550,000.00 a year depending on how hard I work (and how well I develop skills to talk to people).

I am not going to give big details, because the last thing I need is a bunch of negativity coming at me in a time where I am just trying to get by....

:)

Music has been on a holt since Burning Man.

But only until I get things up and running online for good... \
Then I am mastering my songs, getting them out to a bunch of sites (Beatport and Juno are a couple of them, that are waiting on me), and starting to get myself recognized dammit.

I don't come on LJ anymore... I have better things to do with my life.
I barely go on myspace either, but your more likely to get ahold of me (after heavy trying) on there, or to see when I am playing, or what I am up to, or new songs... on there.... so visit till I get my website up.

:)
Cheers!

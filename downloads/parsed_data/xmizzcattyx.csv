"event","lately i've been thinking an awful lot about who i am, and where i'm going, and where i've been.

sometimes when my past comes flooding back to me it shocks me; i can't quite believe that it's real..  and should i feel the need to relate some part of it to another person, i speak as if telling a story. i am even beginning to do this when thinking to myself. i relive my memories in the third person.

perhaps the issue is that now i have a degree of distance from the whole sorry affair, i can see just how horrific it was. i couldnt quite grasp that at the time; i wouldnt allow myself to. confined not only by the physicality of the ward, but by the failings of my own mind, i lacked perspective. i believed that my illness was no more than i deserved, and that i wasnt worthy of the help i was getting, or the attention.

.. to be continued"

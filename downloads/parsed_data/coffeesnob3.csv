I have a roof over my head, clothes on my back and food in my fridge.
My dogs are pretty cute too.

I'm still fucking dissatisfied.

Here's what I&nbsp;want humanity to do:
Follow through on your promises. (so, don't promise what you can't, or won't, deliver.)
Communicate.
Treat people with respect.
Don't talk to me like I'm a fucking idiot.
Don't tell me how to run my business.
Pay your debts.
Shut the fuck up."

"event","An Omen?&nbsp; (or two?)<br /><br />I was going to write in this space about how excited I am about our purchase of the Shanty and about our plans for the next few months. <br /><br />It was official at about 7pm on Friday evening - we all went to our lawyers office and signed a TON of papers, <i>in triplicate,</i> and then initialed the corner of each and every page just to be sure.&nbsp; The plan was to then go out to <a href=""http://www.grapevinesalem.com/home.asp"">the Grapevine</a>, as we had just received a gift certificate thereto, and celebrate.&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; I had (still have) a horrible cough, chills and a fever - so we were just going to go home.&nbsp; The boys who were selling us the joint ( Ok, just one of them) really had his heart set on a toast to seal the deal, so we all went to Major Magleashes and ordered a round.&nbsp; I ordered a Jack &amp; Ginger 'cuz of my sore throat and cough, little did I know it would come in a <i>pint glass </i>with a straw.&nbsp; Now, I'm the kinda girl who orders her cosmos in a rocks glass because martini glasses are too unstable for me.&nbsp; I'm sick, I'm shivering, I whack the straw and send that full icy pint of boozy goodness Right Onto My Crotch!&nbsp; As if I weren't already cold enough....&nbsp; So, Major's was filled with displaced Shanty regulars, and no fewer than three Shanty employees - embarrassed and miserable?&nbsp; Nope, not me....ok, me.&nbsp; They were kind enough to give me a refill and a rag&nbsp; (Yes, someone even made a joke about me being on the rag.&nbsp; Sadly, I was too weak to bludgeon him to death.)&nbsp; The owners of Majors have been great friends of the Shanty over the years, I'm glad to see the good will continue.&nbsp; I promised not to spill anymore drinks on their rug...<br /><br />Now, we had been at the Shanty all week, cleaning, measuring, packing things up and throwing things away.&nbsp; RCG, a local developer,&nbsp; is currently <a href=""http://www.rcg-llc.com/company_press.php"">tearing down the old Salem Evening News</a> building <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/coffeesnob/2212981306/in/photostream/"">right behind us.</a>&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/coffeesnob/2212985526/"">The last wall standing is about 7 feet from our back wall,</a> so to tear it down they are parking a giant cherry picker in front of our building and <i>reaching over</i> us to horizontally jack-hammer away sections of brick and rebar.&nbsp; It makes the place shake and shimmy and it's pretty noisy.&nbsp; I've been waiting to get a phone call from RCG saying that they knocked a hole in our roof or some other such rot.&nbsp; I've posted our cell phone numbers on both doors of the place, in case they need to reach us pronto.&nbsp; The morning of the sale I called an insurance agent, just to get things started.&nbsp; I've left all of the other calls, utilities, vendors etc. for Tuesday morning since Monday is MLK day and most office workers have the day off.&nbsp;  <br /><br />Aaaah, three day weekend, a 'fridge full of food, plenty of cold medicine, a pile of DVD's to watch (Thanks, Kev!) and nothing I can officially do until Tuesday anyway.&nbsp; I'm gonna git me some rest!!!&nbsp; Sunday night, I eat a big ol' sandwich, watch an awesome <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coen_Brothers"">Coen Brothers</a> movie and go to bed around 11pm.&nbsp; I brush, take my vitamins, some cold medicine and a sleeping pill, I bring my cell phone into the bedroom and put it on my bed table, insert my trusty ear plug and hit the sack.<br /><br />Heaven!&nbsp; I sleep until <i>almost noon</i> on Monday, awesome!&nbsp; If you don't count the tossing and turning when the dogs moved or the Hubz snored I slept for 13 hours!&nbsp; I still felt like I needed more, I was drenched with sweat and my head was all spinny.&nbsp; I looked over at my phone and saw ""4 missed calls"" I glanced at the list figuring it was my family who always calls me early in the day - as if I were a real person.&nbsp; One of the calls came from inside the Lobster Shanty at 12:05AM!!!!&nbsp; ok, I roll over, Hubz is still right next to me, where he has been all night.&nbsp; Who. The. Fuck. Was. In. The. Shanty?!&nbsp; Using our phone, no less!!!!! I listen to the voice mail - it's one of the former owners (who's name, of course, is still on everything, such as the alarm company's emergency call list as well as the police's) telling me that <b>there was an attempted break-in </b>and asking me if the lock 'was supposed to look this way' and informing me that he told the alarm company to ""ignore sector one alarms"" (the f**king front door!) because it was probably the wind.&nbsp; <br /><br />I'm now playing this on speaker phone, so that the Hubz can hear it too and so I have my hands free to get dressed so I can rush right down there.&nbsp; I call the guy back, <i>twelve hours later</i>, to find out what happened.&nbsp; He pretends to not know what the lock used to look like, and thinks it was nothing serious.&nbsp; I get in the car and head over, now the Hubz is feeling really sick so I ask his brother to join me 'cuz I'm a bit nervous about going alone....&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Obvious</i> signs that someone has tried to pry the hasp and padlock off the front door, obvious! - it was hard to even unlock the darn thing.&nbsp; I hammered it back into place and made it flush with the door again - tomorrow I'll replace it with a whole new hasp set-up.&nbsp; (Not that there was anything in there for them to steal.&nbsp; We even removed the empty cash register.&nbsp; No money, no food, (no heat) and only a few half-empty booze bottles.)&nbsp; What we really need, though, is a new door.&nbsp; A year or two ago the fire alarm was tripped and the fire dept. came over and crow-barred the doors open (even though there was no smoke showing) and wrenched the whole frame out of alignment.&nbsp; The whole mess is pretty wonky anyway.&nbsp; However, we need to get new doors approved by the city - we can't just replace them without asking The Man.&nbsp; I'm wondering if they come in cast-iron.<br />Anyway, I call the police to follow up - even the dispatcher thinks it was the wind.&nbsp; I'm just grateful that our Wicked Loud Alarm and our Super Lame Locks prevented them from actually getting in.<br /><br />Ok, home again, made some tea - lots of honey, got my book, and a 'warm foot' sleeping bag and I'm ready for that rest.&nbsp; Phone rings, it's my awesome brother in law (my sister's hubz) who has been gracious enough to offer and help us with carpentry stuff.&nbsp; He wants to go in and measure things and talk about plans for the work he's scheduled to do on Wednesday.&nbsp; I told him I'd be totally flexible to his schedule since he's doing us a favor and his hours are crazy-busy; now's the time so off I go.&nbsp; Luckily, while we were there two cops come by to inspect the hasp - I tell them I've already hammered it back into place.&nbsp; They tell me to replace our crappy front doors as soon as we can and that it was probably the wind.&nbsp; Perhaps the Hubz and I should take turns sleeping behind the bar with a shot gun...<br /><br />AAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />We've only owned the place for 76 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />I hope this gets easier."

"event","When coffeesnob is all sad she has tons of time to write her woes on LJ, but when she's busy she doesn't have time for you (and is therefore happy because she is working hard and defines herself by her work which is a wholly American and unhealthy way of going through life)<br />Hel-lo run-on sentence! (although parenthetical)<br /><br />OK Thanksgiving was up in the air: Did I order <i>too many </i>turkeys? (four, twelve-pounders) or <i>not enough</i> turkeys?&nbsp; A nice fellow who received his requisite <a href=""http://www.rockafellasofsalem.com/home/default.asp"">employer</a>-gift-turkey gave us a frozen-like-a-rock number on Thanksgiving eve, which I promptly put into our delicious brine of orange juice, sage and molasses.&nbsp; We started the day with five twelve pound birds and 8 or 10 flimsy promises of ""stopping by"" on&nbsp; Thanksgiving, hopefully for dinner. <br />&nbsp;<br />We try to get there by 9am but some crazy person scheduled a road race and didn't plan ahead with any traffic detours.&nbsp; Um, the race went from the WIllows (near our home) down Essex Street (which connects our home to the rest of the world) at exactly that time.&nbsp; So we sat, and sat, in turkey day traffic while crazy nut-bags ran, yes ran, for some noble goal at 9AM on THANKSGIVING.&nbsp; I thought this was the one day, <i>ONE DAY</i>, when you didn't have to exercise or contemplate calorie burning.&nbsp; arrrrrrrgh!<br /><br />Anyway, we got the doors unlocked by 9:15am, which by the way is a ridiculous time to open a bar.&nbsp; 9:30, no customers, 9:45 no customers - where were ALL the people that <i>promised</i> that they needed a drink that early on Thanksgiving day?!&nbsp; (aaaah, watching the loonies run, that's where!)<br /><br /> Into the smoker the <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/coffeesnob/2056591616/"">turkeys</a> went - filled with cranberries, fresh bay leaves and oranges.&nbsp; I crossed my fingers and had a bloody Mary.<br /><br />by 10am the bar (and my heart) were full; full of good, local regulars, families and employees happily watching the parade (oooh, Shrek!)&nbsp; - the only time I've been comfortable with a six year old sitting at my bar.&nbsp; We sold a good amount of bloodys, champagne and egg nog.<br /><br />Bald Bill one of our long-time bartenders made a French-Canadian specialty called Gauton (or Caton, depending) that was essentially ground pork boiled for hours with fresh ground spices, onion and garlic - but it was more than that; it was fucking delicious!&nbsp; Part pate, part stuffing and all nummy.&nbsp; We put some out (cold) with crackers as an appetizer and then more on the table (warm) as stuffing at meal time.&nbsp; He promised to make more for Christmas, I can't wait.<br /><br />I had prepped my turkey stock (for gravy and stuffing), my <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirepoix_(cuisine)"">mirepoix</a> and roasted mushrooms (for stuffing) and my mashed potato ahead of time. I also had snipped, blanched and shocked my green beans (no <a href=""http://web.foodnetwork.com/food/web/encyclopedia/termdetail/0,7770,3026,00.html"">haricot vert </a>for this lot) and diced my <a href=""http://www.lowellbros.com/"">butternut squash</a> and onions.&nbsp; Oh, and I made a dozen pies (four pumpkin, four squash with <a href=""http://www.grand-marnier.com/"">Grand Marnier </a>and <a href=""http://landingpage2.captainmorgan.com/gatewayFlash.htm?BrandId=RUM&amp;RefUrl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.captainmorgan.com%2fHomePage.htm"">Captian Morgan </a>and four sweet potato pecan pies with <a href=""http://www.jackdaniels.com/age.aspx"">Jack Daniels </a>macerated pecans).&nbsp; I diced and toasted by bread for stuffing, put everything in the oven to warm or in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bain-marie"">bain marie</a> to hold hot and waited, and waited.<br /><br />At 2pm dinner was served, my mom had stopped by to eat and was <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/coffeesnob/2055781923/"">pressed into service</a>.&nbsp; I was weeded at 2:10 and stayed that way until about 4pm.&nbsp; Most of my time was spent figuring out what the fuck I was doing - how do I keep the plates warm?&nbsp; Where does the squash go?&nbsp; What do you mean they don't want corn?&nbsp; Where are the clean towels?&nbsp; We need more large plates!&nbsp; Where's my bloody Mary?&nbsp; I put the gravy in a coffee urn and set it out on <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/coffeesnob/2055781933/"">the table.</a>&nbsp; Yup, one big table in the middle of the Shanty, <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/coffeesnob/2056591610/in/photostream/"">people </a>came and went but that's what we did.<br /><br />Suffice to say we sold out of turkey and we fed over 30 hungry people.&nbsp; I took a bath on the price, $12 for a full meal, plus pie, plus seconds (only Ethel, my favorite waiter had seconds), but the good-will we created and the positive word-of-mouth that we generated were worth every penny, every burn on my flesh and every fretful moment.&nbsp; People have been talking about it for days, people who work at other restaurants have come in after work to say ""I hear you put out quite a spread for Thanksgiving, my customers were raving about it"".&nbsp; <br /><br />Next year I'm going to take reservations and do it properly.&nbsp; <br />This was only a test, had this been an actual Thanksgiving I would have been drunk by noon.<br /><br />The only thing I am sad about is that more <a href=""https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26522792&amp;postID=114680011965742906"">framily</a> couldn't make it; some were busy, some were ill, all were missed.<br /><br />Peace,<br />CS"

Thursday.&nbsp; Big night, new menu! brought in an extra waitress, prepped a TON of food.&nbsp; Took my vitamins.
Served 12 people.
Did NOT kill myself.&nbsp; Pushed the thought from my mind.

Ok, it was Thursday, weather was bad, no worries Friday will be better, usually a busier night anyway.
Friday Arrives. Opened early (we serve lunch on Fridays) brought in a waitress, ready ready ready.
Served 20 people... Paid bills, did payroll, cut the waitress early.
Did NOT kill myself.&nbsp; Pushed the thought from my mind.

I will not slip into despair, even though I threw away 9 lob$ter$ today - they died because I ordered them two weeks ago and we haven't sold them since.
I will not slip into despair, even though my business partner FORGOT he was working today and I had to shut down everything and turn the alarm back on, lock up the restaurant and drive to go get him 10 minutes before we opened at Noon.
I will not slip into despair, even though all that rushing was for naught - our first customer didn't come in until 1:30PM and all he had was&nbsp; beer.
I will not slip into despair, even though my next day off is Christmas Day.
I will not slip into despair."

One of my favorite old co-workers from Shubie's, Sheila, came by this afternoon with some friends.&nbsp; The Shanty was so quiet it was great to have some very loud and very cheerful drunk ladies having a good time - it filled the place with life.&nbsp; It was really nice to see and old chum too.&nbsp; I'm wicked glad she came in.

My Mom and my Dad and his wife all stopped by today - it was swell to see the batch of them.&nbsp; (Thanks for the bean pot, Dad!)

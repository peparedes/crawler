"event","verse 1:

what is this feeling inside 
this feeling i really shouldn't know
all this hatred built up in my chest 
i feel that im going to explode
and all these thoughts in my head 
i bought somehow 
i wish they could be sold
but instead there all just memories 
hugging my brain 
and their never letting go

chorus:

so treat me like an animal 
dont let me breathe fresh air
lock me up inside my head 
im better off in there

verse 2:

I wish i could get out of here
have a place where i could always go
and live a nice calm life for once 
instead of it all just being for show
then maybe i could come to peace with myself 
and all of you could just follow
i'd be in such a happy state 
then i could finally grow

chorus:

so treat me like an animal 
dont let me breathe fresh air
keep me locked up inside me head 
i'm better off in there

bridge:

chorus:

so treat me like an animal 
dont let me breathe fresh air
keep me looked up inside my head
i'm better off in there"

"event","verse 1:

segregated by value and color 
together still as sister and brother
forced to fight the ultimate sin
we're killing off our own next of kin

stakes are high 
many will die 
no need for all this death
this shall not be my last breathe
i will stop at nothing less

chorus:

these times of grace have come to an end
blank faces that will never repent
number 53 back from the dead
to tell the story how it should be said

verse 2:

separated by insignificant traits 
we are all just paper plates
are all our visions lost 
we're just impaired 
to rise against them do i dare

lacking intelligence to disagree 
but together we can break free
away from all this misery 

chorus: 

these times of grace have come an end 
blank faces that will never repent
number 53 back form the dead 
to tell the story how it should be said"

"event","verse 1:

everyone seems to be a hypocrit
dont do that while i do this

chorus:

dont be like me 
i've already tried 
dont ever sacrifice your life

verse 2:

lessons in life 
are never what they seem 
you cant learn from them if you dont know what they mean

chorus: 

dont be like me 
i've already tried 
dont ever sacrifice your life

bridge:

verse 3:

People dont care what they do to themselves 
they just look at all others 
others just rebel

chorus:

dont be like me 
i've already tried 
dont ever sacrifice your life"

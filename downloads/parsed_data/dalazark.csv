"event","Owowowowow...I ache all over! Ugh Jin is incredible...especially tonight...WOAH he was amazing. He made both of our dreams and more come true. He always has...what have I done to deserve him! I'm surprised I had a chance to do this but Jin is taking a nap right now...worn out from all our activites. When he gets up though...mrow.

Rae's birthday is tomorrow! I hope to be there with her tomorrow. She's done so much for Jin and me...so many people have...Yemotari and Mikio especially...Komen, Andrei, Daiako, Akoi, Sion all of our friends. Oh and darkness too...can't forget darkness! When Jin was asleep I recvieved a phone call from Yemo...

Striker and Darren got Komen alone and dragged him to their gang hideout. They all took their turns with him...DAMN IT!!!!! Why can't they leave him alone...why...? What did he do to them?! What?! Fuck I'm crying now...and Jin's waking up...shit...I just want Komen to be happy...that's all any of us want but fate is so cruel to him...soso cruel..."

"event","Well...Yemo's left to stay with his uncle...I suppose it's for the best...Shadow Shorn and Kassandra stopped by. Shadow told us that there's been a reward put out for Ax's head so until we can come up with a better plan Shorn is basically Ax's body guard. Heh heh poor kid. 

Kassandra was a wreck she barely said two words. She had all kinds of bruises and scratches and stayed behind Shadow like a scared puppy and Kassandra is NO scared puppy!!!!!! She was acting totally different and it took a while to figure out why but I think it's pretty obvious now she was raped...

Do people take some sick pleasure out of raping others because it makes me sick. I talked to Shadow about it and she said Kassandra had been drugged and she was going to try and talk to Tomoyo to see if it was okay if Kassandra stayed there for a while. She said if she could Sev would be gone and not Kassandra but she needs him for one more mission before he's out.

It was hard to watch...she shyed away from everybody and even looked afraid when I tried to hug her. Shadow is lost on what to do and only hopes being near Dean might help her. Shadow herself seems upset after the loss of her brother Zen. 

She also had another interesting pice of news...there was an old gang called the flame that recently got well...blown out...However they used to have a tight alliance with the Shadow so all the old members from the flame flocked to join the shadow...even the leader himself: Flame. heh heh he's a lot like Shadow very mysterious and wise. Shadow and him decided they would run the gang together from now on and agreed to have Kassandra and Tal [Flame's right hand man...] take over once they were gone.

Tal seemed like a good guy...very quiet but he seemed genuinely concerned for Kassandra. I also got to meet Della and Dekka two female twins [Tal's sisters heh] from the flame they bickered a lot but seemed like overall good females. Anyway while they were there a guy came for Ax... I swear trouble follows that kid like a lost puppy...plus with the bounty it made sense...However it was an interesting encounter especially because we got to see Flame and Shadow work as a team.

Now that was a sight...those two were amazing together! Plus I got another surprise...Shadow and Flame used to be a couple...Which explains why Rorin seemed so quiet and ticked watching it all. Any fool could sense a strong bond between Shadow and Flame though I think Rorin is worrying over nothing. 

Eh I better get going I want to say goodbye to Shadow, Flame and the others before they leave us...See ya. 

counting today...FIVE DAYS UNTIL I GET MARRIED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

W00T! I'm really happy! A bit worried about Jin but I have faith in him...I was watching what I could of the battle telling whim where to move and when and that he had my support...sure I was far away and whispering but there are more ways to hear than just through your ears. My heart is with him wherever he is in whatever condition he may be in...

"event","I feel like shit...we got Sergiou back only to have him crying and screaming for hours Striker was in a terrible mood about it and not able to take it out on Sergiou...he took it out on me. He didn't even consider the fact I might miscarry...I am VERY lucky I didn't...I ache all over I can barely walk and I'm lucky my face didn't get marred...just a few scratches that won't scar and will be gone in time for the wedding. There's a nasty gash by my forehead but a spike of hair covers it up.

His moods are bad but rarely this bad...when he was done with me he let Bosoli take a turn...he's never done that before. Usually he's the only one that will do anything and it will be just a few punches and that's all but this time was different...I was raped...two days in a row...

Ugh...no matter how hard I fight and resist I can never overcome my brother or Striker...shit...Yemo's pining for me isn't making anything any better plus Sergiou is blaming me for getting hurt just like Striker is blaming me for hurting him...meanwhile everyone else is asking me for advice when I can't even help myself. I'm going to go cut myself and then try to sleep...this time with out the nightmares I endured last night..."

"event","Today was very...I'm not sure how to put it really...Apparently there is a new gang called the shadow and their leaders name just happens to be Shadow. Evidentaly they've gotten very strong very fast so much so that they've caught the eye of not only the ax's but the dark hand as well!!! Both want an alliance with them and there might even be some sort of fight over the shadow...ugh.

Anyway their gang is very secretive and the only way for them to reveal anything is to become a member and earn their trust. Another strange thing about them are the markings right next to their eyes. I believe they're tattoos which signify members of the gang. Yemo and myself joined but luckily you don't get the tattoos until you've been a member for four months. 

The really odd part is we haven't met Shadow yet and we can't until they're a hundred percent sure they can trust us...which won't be until we're given the tattoos. There's this whole loyalty test after the four months then you meet Shadow who takes you to get the tattoos done. Despite not meeting him we've heard tons of stories...

It was kinda interesting actually...we met a lot of people. Most of them were great guys...great SEXY guys. *cough* right...

Here's who we met: 

Shorn - One of Shadows right hand men. Very distant almost cold he seems to space out a lot but you can tell he is very fit and a good fighter. [He is also verrrrry sexy]
Rorin - Shadows other right hand man...he's very close with Shorn and even closer with Shadow whom he is going out with. Rorin is very nice and not the kind of person you'd suspect to find in a gang but he's an excellent street fighter and damn is he cute.
Sig - we didn't get much info about him except he's dating Tak he's surprisingly level headed which is odd due to his eccentric boyfriend
Tak - now this guy is quirky with a capital q 
Westlander [West] - Now this guy was hot and when I say hot I mean STEAMING. He gives a new meaning to sexy and beyond. He's a huge flirt and when you meet him he won't hesitate in pulling you into a kiss as me and Yemo both learned. Not that we minded...though we did feel a bit guilty and had to tell him not to do it again sense we're both taken...Why do I have a feeling that's not going to stop him?
Liliana - Shorn's sister she's very kind and hit it off famously with Yemo due to the fact both care deeply for animals but despite this she is an awesome street fighter as well and we got to see her and Rorin battle it out in a sparring match. Blond hair brown eyes a total babe.
Kassandra: good friends with Liliana. She also took part in the match and like Yemo with Liliana I found we quickly became friends...she's a lot like Kotori. Redish brown hair green eyes sassy.
Waromi - out of all of them he seems the most responsible
Hardware - their computer hacker very serious about what he does though not so much so that he can't break to make sarcastic comments he's only been a member three months so he doesn't have the markings the others do.
Zen - Very cool guy...he was somewhat distant but in a mysterious yet kind way he likes to shoot snide remarks and keep the others in line
Sev - goofs around a lot can't stay serious he's pretty perverted


I really like it there they all seem really nice and don't seem too interested in forming an alliance with the Ax's or the dark hand. Seeing as how they didn't seem to be such a big threat we stated that their gang didn't seem like the one for us...they said they understood but we were welcome to visit anytime we wished and to come back to tomorrow. They even said they'd see if Shadow would make an exception and meet with us! Man I hope so...Shadow sounds beyond cool.

In other news...Jin's and Mikio's entries have both Yemo and me annoyed...we're feeling a bit better now that we've talked to each other about it but...gah...he wants Mikio to teach me how to dance?! I'm not good enough for him or something!? *fumes* 

He's just lucky he talked about me being sexy or man...I don't mind that he and enjoyed watching Mikio dance or kissed other people... I should but the only thing that's truly getting to me is how he said he wishes Mikio would teach me. As for Yemo...he seems very borhtered that Mikio would dance for Sora and enjoy it so...Oh well...what ya gonna do...*sighs* 

I desperatly need to go dance more...not only to work out how upset I am but to practice so maybe someday I can be good enough for Jin...and here I though dancing was one of the few things I was good at...After all I've been practicing since I could walk! My mistake apparently no matter what I do Mikio will always be better at that and everything else."

"event","Well...Jin and I had quite the adventure...we were thrown back in time...it was kind of weird seeing younger versions of ourselves...man we were so different. I just hope we didn't fuck up the past by showing up!!! 

I wonder what it was about that day that made it so bad for Jin...could that have been the day he killed his parents...? He and Sion made an interesting couple...what was more interesting is that Jin didn't want to be gang leader or be with Sion really! I didn't think it was possible for Jin to ever not be a romantic! Ah well...first time for everything...

And I was just as I remembered me...I hope Jin didn't find out anything personal from him...gah still so many more things I have left to tell that no one knows about yet...damn...you think by now all my secrets would have been revealed...

Past Jin didn't like the idea of having sex with me or going out with me! I was insulted! He didn't seem much for love at all really...I suppose that could be expected. The kid was only 16!!! 

According to Catylia the past will be okay...all that we did she says is speed things up between us...and that even if we were to wipe their memories they would find each other...according to her our love was written in the stars long before we were born and that we're soul mates... *Dreamy sigh* I act like such a lovesick girl sometimes but I suppose that's sort of what I am and I think what she says makes sense...

She seems to  thinks we ought to check up on the past every once and a while make for sure we didn't mess it up and that we end up like we're supposed to..she says she has no doubt we will though it might be sooner than expected...

You know that no matter what the dimension or time frame we'd find one another...it might sound crazy but I feel attached to him...like he's a part of me. Heh...I'm being stupid again...though I'm sure Jin would see some sort of truth in it...anyway I better go...see ya later..."

How could you god...how could you do this to me?! Everytime I get over one misery you give me another...everytime I get close to someone you rip them away...

After years of anguish I was finally getting over Kotori...building up a new life...making new ties with less fears and what's my reward?! Death...all around me...Jin's sister...my daughter...my father figure...my twin brother...How could you!? <b>HOW FUCKING COULD YOU?!</b>

Do you enjoy playing with me god? Am I your fucking play thing?! Is that all I am to you?! What's next?! Kitty?! <b> JIN?! </b> If you think that by taking Kitty and Jin away you can crush my spirit away...you're wrong...you did that when you took Areazna, Striker, and Kiji from me all in one day...all in one hour...

So you wouldn't crush my spirit from ripping Kitty and Jin away from me...you'd <b> <i> destroy </b> </i> ME. You would be taking away the very soul from my body and ripping it apart...

Because of you I don't care anymore...I just <i> don't </i>. The only thing that really seems to matter now is Jin and Kitty...and if you take them away from me I won't hesitate in killing myself...I'll see you in hell Tero...you bastard."

They practicually groped poor Tokaji and have been trying to get him to break up with Sora...damn Sora had better not find out what's going on or he'll be so pissed...

Catylia put a spell on me and Daiako...*sigh* The thing is we have no idea what it is yet...we won't know until we sleep apparently...[it takes a long time to kick in or something...] Daiako and me have been trying in vain not to sleep but we know it's got to happen some time...*shakes head*

Plus the last time I slept I had the best dream with Jin...mmm Jin...with no clothes...kissing me...HOLY CRAP I NEED TO SLEEP!!!! How am I suppose to dream of such things if I'm not sleeping?! ...I wish Jin was here...I need to touch him...embrace him...kiss him...make love to him...*coughcough* >>;"

The nerve...right after we had an arguement too!! Did he even think once about me?! Pft...probably not...FUCK HIM!!!!! I can't believe him...first he goes insulting a part of me then he leaves and forgets about me and flirts shamelessly...well I'm glad I mean that little to him...

Fuck it...fuck everything...I'd kill myself but I'm pregnant and the last thing I'd want is to kill Taro...*sighs* Jesus...I need to go do something to take my mind off this...I can't drink...not that I could even if I wasn't pregnant...me and Yemo made that pact after all...gah...fuck..."

"event","I got my heart checked yesterday. Turns out it was a mix of stress and too much coffee so no surgery will be needed!!! Yemo's already started to hide the coffee like Sora suggested. Grr...Anyway we ran into the sexiest guy yesterday. He was smoking hot! 

Jin would probably be upset if he read this but it is so true. He pissed Sora off though. He's staying at the house and he is such a flirt. He's nothing compared to Jin though. My hot sexy buff Jin...

Why did I have to turn my train of thought to Jin damn it...I'm so horny right now...This journal is starting to sound like some kinky sex thing...

I can't help it really though...Tokaji is very confident and often walks around without a shirt. After his shower he'll walk around naked. Let me tell you he is HUGE down there!!!...I'm starting to sound like Yemo...Please don't let Jin see this!!! 

Sora and Tokaji would make such a cute couple. Though Tokaji would probably be the seme and I'm not sure Sora could handle that. ...Okay now this really is Yemo's journal...

Gah...I need to go take a cold shower...bye."

"event","yes I actually got a journal...go me...damn you yemotari for making me get this!!! I told you I'd have nothing to say!!!! Anyway he insisted I get these damn teal kittens! How many times must I insist I am not a kitten!? 

Me and Yemo finally made up after Rae locked us in a bathroom yesterday after Yemo had so politely told me to look for my keys up my ass. -_- I don't know what made me forgive him when we were in that bathroom together...I guess I just realized how much I value his friendship. 

You know if I MUST write in this thing I'd like to try and get Jin to get one too...*grins* that would be interesting. Speaking of Jin...Yesterday I told him how I got an A on that exam I was so worried about proving he was right once again. He did a good job of calming me down earlier though. He's great at massages and even better when he ties me to a bed covers my eyes and teases me! IT WAS HEAVEN!!!

Even if we did get cut off way too soon...ah well...Jin was really cute with Kitty yesterday wanting her to be comfortable and all. I'm really disappointed that he doesn't want more kids at the moment but I'm not going to let him know that. 

Yemo is expecting a kid of his own from Mikio and will be getting married to him at a later date. I wish he'd tell Mikio the truth about his past. They are lovers after all! They have to share this kind of thing! I know that's sort of hypocrisy seeing as how I hid things from Jin for so long but I've told him a majority of my little secrets! 

Anyway I better be going...I have to save Daiako before Riozo decides to attempt to rape him again...*heavy sigh* Jesus this house is so fucked up...

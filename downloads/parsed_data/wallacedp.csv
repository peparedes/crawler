lol, ok ok. ill explain. I was reading somewhere ages ago that if you shag ur own sister(keep it in the family) and she has a baby and the cycle continues then it messes with ur genes and you start to look really undeveloped and stuff. Well anyways, bearing that in mind.... Surely if the world did start with Adam and Eve then the whole world is (keeping it in the family). Spose it mite go part way to explaining why we are fucked up as a race. If we really are the Bi-products of a perfect couple then it would be like using the same video over and over again. So assuming that they were the PERFECT humans I bet they didnt look anything like what our media defines as perfect (models etc). I bet they were just efficient. Infact, they prob didnt even look human....dam thats creepy. Anyways... fuck adam and eve(no pun intended) We are just bi-products of our own dis-efficiency to live honest lives."

"event","Its really shitty and awquard when you have to deal with someone who had lost a relative or person close to them. I began a conversation with one of my first customers today in a very cheerfull tone of voice and a bouncy feel to my sentence. 

ME:""what are you doing today"" *bouncy bouncy* *happy happy* (hoping to stay that way)
CUSTOMER:""its my mothers funeral..............""
ME""..............""
CUSTOMER""............""
(now at this point you have several options, (1)do the normal polite thing and say ""im sorry"", (2) say a mild amusing comment or (3)be quiet)
(1) the problem with saying ""im sorry"" is that hes heard it probley a million times now and you think that mabey if you say that it will remind him of the mourning hes going through and he will start crying really loud
(2) You think to yourself that mabey the death wasnt ...that recent and he might somewhere in his heart see the comical side of things so pop a line like ""well did she have a good innings"" stealing the comedy of Harry Enfield.
(3) Sit in complete silence in the hope that he mabey forgets his mum is dead. But that could backfire the silence could cause him to think about it more.

So anyway I stick to (2) and say a mild amusing comment.

ME:""how old was she""
Him:""78""
ME:""ooo so she had a good innings then""
Him: ""well not really...she was disabled and blind""
ME: ""im sorry""
Him: ""..........""

I honestly belive that there is no right way out of that situation without making is worse. It feels really fake trying to make up feelings for peoples dead relatives. I feel sorry for the person but I didnt even know his mum so how can I be sorry, I didnt kill her. 

At my funeral I dont want people to be sad. I want people to eat lots of food and get drunk and remember the good times. If people are sad when I die then I obv have lived for no reason. The only think that upsets me at funerals is other people crying. hmm."

"event","I have a cream sofa. Not a good idea I know. Ive had this stain staring at me for a few days now. I decide that now is the time to take action so I purchase some Vanish..which ya know I hoped would make the stain..vanish. I squirted the stuff on and left it for a while, well the stain did not vanish but where the stain was and still is for that matter is a big 'vanish' stain. so now its a stain within a stain(holds onto sanity) so what do I do, Ive been at work all day and im tired so my brain obv isnt working right. The vanish stain is almost the colour of my sofa so I decide that the only option is to spray the entire seat bit of my sofa with vanish just so it wont look silly. Well ya know what...it does and now ive not only got a stain within a stain staring at me...Ive also goto sit in one giant stain. My life today...is just a stain. 
    I was ment to come home and do a big clean sort of grownup thing. But after the sofa thing I dont think I can handle it. I think I will sit here and eat a whole pack of maryland cookies. The strange thing about them is that they only taste good when you eat them whole. Suppose they pack more of a chocolatey punch that way. 
  Dont go and see Lost in translation. It only re-establishes what we already know about life. The only thing that made me stay awake was the beautiful girl walking around in pants throughout the film. It was such a anti climax to going out last saturday. much like the end of todays entry."

"event","No matter whats going on in your life bad, good anything Marvin Gaye can solve them all. Marvin knows his shit. Hes the man of men, he leaks quality from every letter of his name. Hes such a legend. None of his songs are bad. In an age when all that counted (well mostley) was your talent he made it too the top. Imagine being born into todays society called Marvin especially with a second name Gaye...he would soooo be a goth by year 9. Lots of people can write a harsh song about breaking up with someone and convey that feeling through music but it not often you hear a positive song(not ska ) that really does feel like the emotion the writer is trying to convey.Its one thing to write a song and make the lyrics sound realistic. But a whole other world to make the music and lyrics and voice to work so well together it creates the emotion for you. 
Im pissed off with people having their friends pre-define a set of genres that they have to listen too to be able to fit in with the group. Its making people out of touch with what they think is actually a 'good' piece of music. We are on the planet for only a small amount of time and its just not enough time to listen to all this ace music thats around. I bet in the world somewhere is the perfect song. In some far reaches of some jungle is some tribe that knows the perfect song. I bet if someone found the perfect song their head would explode."

"event","<P><FONT color=#33ccff>I havent updated in like 2 days.. my bad. Well las nite i went to JHS graduation with mo n ec n beck. Beck was an ass the whole time wahts new and we faught the whole time too.. gah. Ne ways it wasnt that sad and the speaker girl talked about god and thats sweet n everything.. but she was WAY over dramatic i thought and she knew noone was gna go follow god after that.. they were all gna go party. ITs relle sad. How everyone is fuckin up their lives with drugs n shit. But i guess its not my buisness since i dont do all that. Sure everyone tries stuff once in their life but sum jus abuse it.. and it makes me sad cuz its gna turn around on them sumday n bite them in tha ass and they dont seem to see that. Even tho its right there in their face.. they see it happen everyday. I couldnt imagine havin to hav a drug to get by. That would be horrible. BUT anyways i dont wanna be sad. Im bored i guess im stayin home tonite which is a first haha but i didnt go to VV graduation with mo n ec cuz its boring i dont know any of them. But 2 days left of school woo hoo.. finals suck tho. BUt oh well they r always easy. Im scared about summer tho cuz i think me n beck will either fight the whole time or break up. i dno how loyal i can be and him either... i mean bein outta town and at tha lake and all that stuff its jus gna be hard cuz there are so many other guys.. i dunno i guess we'll jus try this out and see how it will work. But at this moment in time im not talkin to him hes called like a million times n txt but i havent answered.. cuz earlier on tha phone we were talkin about this guy that i have had probs with lately.. like me n him talk n hang out n beck hates it and i was like yea what if we did stuff and he goes r u sayin yall did and i go mayb and we had been jokin around well he gets pissed and was like leave me alone and hung up on me. So now im leavin him&nbsp; alone and hes sad. and now im sad.. but im still not gna answer yet. I wanna see sumone else tonite.. no names will be said haha.. but i want to and i dont understand why? does that mean i wnat this other guy and not him? or im jus not over this other guy or what.. im so confused. I hate boys sumtimes.. i love em but hate em haha. My main plan kinda is to let beck down easy like not answer his calls n kina not talk to him as much so mayb he will want to break up with me. Cuz he gets so sad about it and it kills me so i cant break up with him.. i dont know if i even want to. He relle does deserve better tho. Im mean to him. But i dno i guess im a bitch whats new. And whats sad is if i talk to this other guy tonite and he wants me to come out with him i prolly will. This is krazy.. summer is gna be wild. But fun.. i cant wait to spend it with my friends. Well i guess thats enough.. ill holler</FONT></P>

Me n ec were on our way to school this morning and we were like.. well i wonder whats gna happen today cuz all these black ppl were mad at us cuz we dropped tha N bomb hahaha. oh well. DIDNT NUTHIN HAPPEN. thas what i thought... ANYWAYS after 6th period beck walked up to me n was like omg i hav football til 6 and then at 630 i gotta try out for this baseball team.. well i wasnt relle listenin so i didnt ask him about it then the announcements came on at the end of the day and its LEGION tryouts.. which means like a game everyday out of town cept sunday and i heard they practice on that day. That means NO TIME FOR SHAINA.. so screw this relationship. I told him i was gna break up with him at summer cuz well.. hahaha im to krunk to b tied down. JUst kidding. But i relle wasnt i was jus fightin with him cuz we always do that.. its like us i dno. but now we relle are goin to cuz obviously he doenst hav time for me.. and i want him to play itll be good for him and him nrees r goin to football camp early june so theres another time to be away from me.. I cant put up with that crap. I want a boyfriend that i can hang out with ..not go watch play baseball every walkin minute of my life and i prolly couldnt even go to that cuz itd be out of town so much. But so im really upset cuz i didnt wanna break up but this is obviously a sign we need to right? or am i wrong. WHO knows. I just am sick of all this shit. I cant wait for school to be over theres soo much stress on me lately. I jus wanna lay out all day and party all nite. YES. Sounds like a good summer to me. And if i gotta party single then i guess ill deal. Even tho ill miss him ..but whatever im mean to him neways. He deserves better probaly. Im a bitch. BUt then again he hasnt called me tonite and i kno try outs gotta be over.. he never calls me unless i make him which is sad. And we fight a lot so i guess this is for the best.. im scared tho. But i guess ill holler bak latr on</FONT></P>

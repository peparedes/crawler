"event","So here's a tough question, how important is timing in a relationship?  Do you think that people miss out on great relationship with someone they could be really happy with, but life gets in the way:
ie: already in a relationship/not over a previous relationship
ie: living in a different damn state
ie: in different points in their life
...you get the idea.  Things that they can't necessarily control.  If these things do get in the way, how does one keep from playing the what if game?  A horrible game...that can cause many a stomache ache/cold sore/sleepless night.  Is it just a situation where we must convince ourselves that it wasn't meant to be?"

"event","Dreams can be so frustrating, you have no control over what happens, who is in them, and you can't just wake up so that the dream will stop.  Do any of you girls believe that dreams have a deeper meaning or is it simply a jumble of random thoughts that mean nothing?  Do you believe that dreams can be an indication of the future, that you can dream (in a sense) what's going to happen.  Thought this might be an interesting topic."

"event","Anyone want to share their 21st Birthday story?  I personally started out with dinner and then proceeded to a bar to play pool.  All in all I probably had about 8-10 shots of Southern Comfort, a few rum & cokes, & a few other drinks that I really have no idea what the hell they were.  I didn't do anything too stupid but there is a picture of some guy's hand (not sure who it belonged to) grabbing my boobs!  :-O  Didn't get out of bed until at least 2 o'clock the next day!"

If a (sane) guy really likes you, there ain't nothing that's going to get in his way. And if he's not sane, why would you want him?"

"event","Oh Jackie....those words are so true.  That stage after you told someone how you feel about them...that period of time (sometimes minutes, sometimes days, and I hope not months!) where you are waiting to see if the they feel even remotely the same about you...yeah...not gonna lie...that stage freakin' sucks.  :-)  But it's worth the risk of getting rejected cause if they feel the same way...there is nothing better than that.  Right?  To love someone so completely and know that they feel the same way about you...nothing beats that...nothing....therefore it's got to be worth the risk of getting hurt.  

What if I got it wrong
And no poem or song
Could put right what I got wrong
Or make you feel I belong

What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side
That you don't want me there in your life

Oooooooh that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Oooooooh that's right
How can you know it if you don't even try
Oooooooh that's right

Every step that you take
Could be your biggest mistake
It could bend or it could break
But that's the risk that you take

What if you should decide
That you don't want me there in your life
That you don't want me there by your side

"event","Personality definately is more important that looks, yes you have to be attracted to them but I personally am not usually attracted to a jerk just because he's cute but I think you can be attracted to a average or less than hot guy based on his personality. 

I was watching Average Joe last night and there were some okay looking guys on there but their personalities definately made them attractive.  And we all probably know a couple where their looks just don't match up ( a hot girl with an average guy or vice versa.) and it raises the question what are those two doing together...well obviously personality played a much bigger role in attraction than looks did.  That's the way it should always be but it hard when t.v., magazines and all the media make looks seem so important...have you seen the show the swan...hell they are even doing plastic surgery to some of the guys on average joe.  Should plastic surgery be the only way that an average guy can get a beautiful girl??"

"event","You meet someone, you go out on a first date and you have a great time, now what?   How do you keep yourself from the ineveitable drive to talk to them all the time, hang out with them in all your free time?  In other words how do you keep from ""rushing into things"" ?  I currently have two friends (yes Sarah, your freak out phone call inspired this one!) that are in the beginning stages of dating/relationship, and they both talk about their respective guys non-stop, want to talk to him, see him all the time...not necessarily a bad thing but it can be.  So how do you keep things under control, so that it doesn't have a negative effect?

I personally have no idea, cause I have never been able to do it. LOL.  I think that the point is to not change your schedule around them, do things that you normally do, and enjoy the time that you do spend with them or talking to them because lets face it, the beginning is always great!  So enjoy girls!! :-)

"event","Do you have a checklist of qualities that you are looking for in a mate?  Is that even possible?  Can a person really know everything they are looking for in a person?

I know someone who has a checklist of sorts.  He has these certain qualities that he's looking for and if a girl meets those qualities then bam..he's in love.  It just seems so...so...cold.  I don't think it's possible for a person to know everything they are looking for in a person.  That's why dating is so hard...and also why it's so fun.  It's hard because you find someone who meets your ""checklist"" and then you think they are the one...and then you figure out something else that you want/need... and they don't meet that...but it's also fun because when you really do find the one...okay..they meet your checklist..but chances are..they are going to show you things that you never thought of but that you just love having."

It's amazing how once someone feels insecure aout their partner's love, all kinds of problems and mistrust come into the relationship, possible leading to the end of a relationship that really just need a little extra effort, a few words of appreciation, a night of quality time...etc.  I want someone who chooses me, chooses to love, chooses to put in the effort to make me feel loved, without me telling them what to do, chooses to learn what makes me feel loved and makes a consistent effort to express their love in the ways I understand love.

"event","when a guy you went on a couple dates with but decided not to date anymore cause he was moving much faster than you were comfortable with(aka dropping the L-bomb)tells you that he thinks you dumped him because you are scared by how much you love him and didn't want to get hurt so you ran away???  I mean...does that even make any sense...why would I dump him if I loved him...and hello it was only a couple of dates...the L-bomb shouldn't even be in play at this point.  

Couple of random thoughts:

How often do you think a guy ""moves in"" on a girl when she vulnerable because she just got out of a relationship or she's going thru a hard time?

How often do you think the girl tries to pick up with the new guy where the last guy ended...like trying to force herself to have the same level of emotions with this new guy who seems so wonderful and so what her last boyfriend wasn't?

Do you think that you can choose to love someone simply because they meet your ""ideal meet"" qualifications?  Meaning if you agree with someone all the things that are important to you...religion, kids, etc...can you ""choose"" to love this person or is love something that you have NO control over at all?

"event","is officially the worst game ever invented.  What a waste of time...to sit around thinking...if only I hadn't been this way..or done this...or if only I had said this or done that...things could have been different.  However...as much as I hate this game and feel like it is a waste of time...I can't help myself.  Things would be so different..and probably better had I done things differently...but I have to figure out how to stop beating myself up over it.  What happened is in the past...I have to accept it and move on.  Every experience teaches us something...even if you made mistakes...so take those lessons and do your best not to repeat your mistakes.  The lesson I learned is that if you love someone...you tell them, show them, make sure they know it...never hold back when it comes to love...it's too important...too precious...it's worth the risk of getting hurt...because if you don't hold back...at least you know you did everything you could...you put yourself out there...put your heart on the line...and yeah..you might get hurt because you can't control what other people do...only what you do...but at least you won't be sitting around playing the what if game."

"event","So I saw this quote that said that love, not time, heals all wounds.  I'm wondering if this is true...do you think that you need to take time to heal after you have been hurt before you get into another relationship or do you think that when you find the right person any issues (distrust...etc.) you have from previous relationships will work themselves out??  Romantic relationships are such double edged swords...on one hand, they shape us into the people we are and help us figure out what we want...but on the other hand...when they end badly...they leave us with these issues and fears that no matter how hard you try to not let them...affect your future relationships.

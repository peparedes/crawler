"event","Well, after updating my monster.com resume, I've been offered a couple of jobs. Unfortunately, they're MOSTLY all for privately owned insurance compaines. If I'm selling insurance, I guess I'd prefer a reputable establishment to avoid fraud. You know how you always hear about that kind of stuff. Hell, I've had friends who've fallen victim to fraudulent insurance companies, so eh. The others were some weird company based out of California who only offered me the position because I listed taking Japanese in my education section. *rolls eyes* I don't speak it well at all. I read it way better than I speak it. The other, which I actually have an interview for today, is a position at the Tacoma Petco. I actually don't mind that one because I frequent pet stores to see the animals and browse the adoptees. They offered full and part-time, with benefits for either. So, that was a plus. Might not be the best paying job in the world (especially after the epic post office pay), but I'll take anything right now...except the food industry. <i>I've</i> seen what goes on behind the scenes at a food establishment! I ain't gonna have that on my conscience again! No sir! LULZ.

So yeah. 5pm, today. I'm actually not fearing it. I usually get pretty anxious over potential job related shit, but I'm actually feeling pretty laid back, for once. Yay, me!

I still wish I could go back to the post office, though. I mean, how can you beat no dress code, no money-handling, no dealing with customers, and just listening to your iPod all night for an excellent amount of pay!? I'll keep checking back to hopefully get back on there.

ANYWAY. You know what's awesome? Replaying FFVII. I'm way to lazy to move my PS2 to another room to play it, so I busted out the ol' PC version. Unlike most of my PC games purchased 10 years ago, this is one of the few that still runs on WinXP. So, yay. I forgot how much I actually <i>loooove</i> this game. Mm-hmm.

Bah. I guess I'll go get ready for the day and play more game. Yup. K, bye.

"event","Sakura-con is already over!! NUUUU! Seems like it goes by faster and faster every year. This was supposedly their 10th anniversary. Their banner read ""Bringing two cultures together since 1997"" even though the first Baka!-con was in 1998. So, technically, it's a 10th CON celebration, not 10th year like they were emphasizing. I'm not criticizing, it's just something I happened to notice. I know what they're probably trying to mean. Meh. Moving on.

First of all, I really found <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v654/kouketsuno_rei/escalator_caution2.gif"">this sign</a> amusing while I was there. Hence, my latest icon.

Despite some mild lack of communication that sent me into a worry *coughTEDcough* and the obligatory otaku funk, unknown drunks, and hotel check-in/check-out crap, the con was pretty awesome, this year. All seemed well and good. Had 8 in the room this year. Me, Ted, Jake, Pam, Hannah, Chrissy, D, and Monty. Didn't get a handicap room, again, though, so it was a little cramped this year, but we made it work.

<b><u>THURSDAY:</b></u>
I <i>really</i> procrastinated Wednesday night on my packing. I really should have started earlier, but oops. I started packing way late at night and only got like 2 hours of sleep before getting up to round up people for the trip up. I said ""up"" a lot in that last sentence, huh? Anyway, Hannah and Pam just came over after they got off their night shifts and slept a little. Loaded up the car after we all got up and made a quick stop at the store before going to Seattle...er rather, stopped at Gabe and Jake's first to pick up some of Jake's stuff. Arrived at his place to see his epic Stabby McMohawk. Yep. Quite epic. THEN we went to the hotel. They changed the layout a bit so a lot of crap was in different places. The unloading area was kind of a clusterfuck. We had to pull the car up to the curb in front of the new valet entrance and had 3 minutes to unload ALL the shit from our car and get it out of there. We took longer, but oh well. They were at least nice enough to give us 2 luggage carts. Ted checked us in and then booked back to Tacoma so he could go to work. We dropped all the stuff off in the room, took a few pre-room disaster pics and then Monty showed up. THEY BS'ed about RO and Hannah dumped like 10 pairs of shoes in the closet. Why the hell she needed that many pairs of shoes for 3 days is beyond me. We were gonna head to the pre-reg line, but Hannah wanted a shower. Met Rob, another RO player friend, and he went and hung out with us. When we got there, the line was pretty long for a Thursday. I remember the last few times we went early, there were barely ever any people there on Thursday. So, a half hour later, we got to the front of the line and luckily Sandy and Tess got there to cut in line. We ASKED if the people behind us wouldn't mind, so we weren't complete dicks! Aleeza and Matt were with them, but had to go. So, we got our badges, I chatted briefly with Al, and we decided to take the bus to Uwajimaya to get some food. I'd never been on the bus before, so something so seemingly anti-climactic to Seattlites was amusing to me. We got there, fooded, bought room rations, and went back. Hobos smell like pee. Sorry, but I noticed that hardcore on the bus. Anyway, so we just hung around, watched AMV Comedians, and talked about costumes and stuff until everyone decided to turn in. I, unfortunately, had a hard time getting to sleep cause Ted still hadn't shown up. He was supposed to come back after he got off work. Turns out he stopped off at Paul's to visit since fucking Matt was in town. Matt answered his cell phone and told me some bullshit story about Ted and told me he didn't know where he was when he was actually there the whole time. So, I stayed up worrying for nothing because Matt's a fucking cumdumpster. Ironically, I'd written his name in Sandy's Death Note earlier that night, so after my rage had passed, I'd gotten a laugh. Yep. Matt: Death by cock gangrene.

<b><u>FRIDAY:</b></u>
Got up with next to no sleep and we all put on costumes. I wore Gatts, again, since I didn't have a new costume. Remember, I had a choice of a new camcorder or a new costume. After having already watched the con tape, I'm glad I picked the camcorder. We wandered over to the convention center and I started taping some stuff. Pictures were taken, props were peacebonded, and hallways were stunk up. I headed to Betsy's booth in the dealer's room and she ""beat me up"" for my costume, again. Wandered around some more and then hung out with Chrissy and D in the pre-reg line to keep em company awhile. Jake showed up shortly after that, so I went to hang with him in the slacker registration line. He brought...ORGANIC soda. It tasted weird. The wait was suck and it got too warm, so I left and wandered out to the courtyard for air...but it was fucking warm outside, too!! At least it didn't rain that day. D and Chrissy got their badges and joined me outside in time to go to the Bleach photoshoot. D and Sandy were in it. It was cool she did her Rukia costume! I wish I coulda done my Hitsugaya, but there's always next year. There were some good costumes in it, but a lot of epic failures, too. I was hoping for more reenactment shots or pairings, but it was a majority of same-character shots and 1 huge group shot over and over. I mean, we did get a few pairings and individual shots, but ya know. Anyway, after that, we hung around the courtyard a little longer and some decided to change or change costumes. I went back to the room and changed into regular clothes then went to the AMV contest with Jake. Last year's contest kind of sucked, so I didn't get too psyched for this year's, but curiosity compelled, so I went. Even though we were late, the contest still hadn't started, so we had to watch all of them. There were a few really good ones, but for the most part, nothing I went 4koma over. Went back to the room to dump Jake's extra luggage off and I changed into my Naruto pajamas since Chrissy had <i>just</i> finished her Tsunade costume. Went back to the convention center and hung around outside the dance room. Apparently, the con had hired some well-known raver DJ, so unfortunately for the con goers, it attracted a lot of ravers who weren't even there for the con. Turned out some underaged whore started passing out ecstasty on the dance floor. How fucked up is that. Sucks that the DJ attracted a lot of retards who were out of the con's element. I guess I heard a lot of them got busted by cops throughout the night and some other people who were tripping on it got busted for underaged inappropriate ""behavior"". Anyway, took some more pics while we were up there, checked out the console gaming room, then sat around in a group and hung out. Got hounded by staff to show our badges a billion times and then headed back to the hotel. Some wanted to be up earlier for photoshoots, yeah. Went back to our room and we looked at pics, played Bleach DS 2nd, and stuff before getting some sleep.

<b><u>SATURDAY:</b></u>
Ugh, woke up a little later than I'd have liked, but eh. When I got up, it was just me, Chrissy, and D in the room. I put on my Kankurou costume (even though I kinda didn't want to) and then we hurried down to find the Naruto photoshoot...only to find out it had either NOT happened or they fucking started early and ended even earlier, again. Like, the Bleach shoot on Friday had started a half hour early, so a lot of people showed up at the right time only to find it had started and was almost over. Anyway, we just hung around then. Took pics, watched people act like morons, and then raided the dealer's room since we hadn't exactly bought anything yet. I bought a Chappy Soul Candy prop, a Bleach fortune figure (got school-boy Ichigo in it), and a Matsumoto plush before we headed back out into the courtyard after seeing the RO shoot going on. Gabe and Noelle were in it. Took some pics of that and then noticed some Bleachers were doing a mini shoot. I guess we just caught the end of it, but hey, at least we saw some of it. There was a serious lack of decent Renjis, I noticed. That's just my opinion, but still. I loaned Sandy my Soul Candy for her Rukia costume. We were getting hungry, so we went over and braved the Subway line. Well, I didn't, but I was over there, anyway. We sat at a few tables and we hung around while waiting. The idea of Lo needing some Hollow Food came about...and the cheesy pitch of ""Got a hollow stomach? Eat Hollow Food!"" Retarded? Yes. Amusing? Very. After that, some waited in line at Starbucks while the rest of us searched for an ATM that still had money in it and then back to hit the dealer's room one more time before it closed. Wandered the aisles and found a Rukia/Kon model at a decent price, so I picked that and a school-boy Hitsugaya plush at one booth, picked up the new Cosmode cosplay magazine, and two cell phone charms one of Yoruichi and one of Soifon. Went out to the courtyard, again, to sit and watch people. Took a few more pics and then all decided it was time to go back and change/change out of costumes and order dinner. Those in Tarra's room ordered Chinese food while we ordered pizza to ours. We ate pizza and watched a show about train disasters which we found amusing. It sounds morbid, but it really was humorous. You'd have had to have been there. I changed into my Naruto PJ's, again, gave some apples to Lo and Sandy since apparently ""shinigami love apples"", and we went up to the 35th floor of the hotel to see the city at night from that high up. Jake jumped on a treadmill and turned it up as high as it could go and actually ran with it. Again, you'd have had to have been there to get the epicness. Then, Chrissy and D left to go to a Hellsing premier and the rest of us headed to the con center, again. Went up to the 6th floor to see what exactly Club Sakura Feudal Japan / Soul Society was. Basically, it was just a retarded rave where they played the same shitty techno music just with episodes of Bleach being played on the giant screens. I was amused at it's dumbness! Like, a bunch of ravers dancing around while something sad or tragic occurs on the screens...just seems a little retarded. Amusing, but retarded. Anyway, we went out of there quite fast and sat in the hallway where Betsy was selling glowsticks. Everyone wanted to head back to their room to get a drink and said they'd be right back, so I decided to just wait cause I really didn't want to walk all the way back to hotel after just having walked there. I sat there with Betsy and her co-worker/friend chick. They sold glowsticks and I played DS. Jake, Gabe, and Noelle came around sometime later and told me that everyone who had left (an hour earlier) were on the level below me doing shit. Seems I waited for nothing! /pif  Sooo, we met back up with Chrissy and D and we sat around and talked before heading down to find everyone only to find they were heading back up. We went down and discovered an area on the 3rd floor we'd never ventured to that had these scrolling marquee screens with random sayings on them. It was...weird because of it's randomness. We were gonna head back to the hotel, but decided to hang out awhile, so we went back up to the 4th floor.  Gabe, Noelle, and Chrissy went up to the 6th floor while me, D, and Jake stayed on the 4th...where Jake became ""Whalebones"", telling us of the things he did and created. You'll have to see the video to get the greatness. A short time later, me, Jake, Chrissy, and D wandered to a few of the video rooms to see what was playing. Not much was on. We walked into the live action theater just as a scene with a long gunfight started. After the gunfight scene ended, we left and headed back to the hotel. I uploaded my pics on my comp and me and D did some epic zooms on some of the epic zoom worthy ones which was just a riot!! Chrissy was in tears she was laughing so hard. Video taped that amusement, too. D, Chrissy, and Monty then went to sleep. Ted and Hannah were out with everyone else hanging out and drinking. Jake and I decided to go back to the convention center since we didn't want to have to be quiet for the sleepers. We went back up to the 6th floor to see what was going on. Saw Rob and Ted in all their drunkeness followed by Hannah who joined us after the other two ran off. Since it was like....almost 4am, the Saturday night dance was about to wrap up, but I still wanted to see what was going on inside. They were playing the usual techno stuff, only this time on the screens, it was some Sailormoon stage show playing. Made nooooo sense, but stupidly amusing nonetheless. When we left, we went and sat on some ledge overlooking the floors below and then Sandy, Tess, Lo, Pam and uh...people found us and hung around with us. They had had a few drinks I guess and written more stuff in Sandy's Death Note. So, me, Hannah, and Jake wrote our names in it, too, along with how we'd die. I think Hannah wrote she'd die playing RO or something; I wrote I'd die in an epic battle against the Wang Dynasty; Jake wrote...some crazy shit followed by an A-bomb. Then, some random guy who had obviously been drugging earlier came over and Sandy had him write in the Death Note. He seemed really confused. It amused me. He only came over because Jake had picked up some green sticky ball thing he'd dropped. We threw it around and the guy eventually left. Ted and Rob came back...then Rob left and went down to the 4th level and started drunk-talking to a convention center employee. We watched from the 6th floor. I wrote some other random shit in the Death Note and then me and Jake took off. We wandered around awhile, looked in a few of the movie rooms, again, and after finding nothing to do, we sat at a table outside Subway and played our DS's until like...6am. We wandered back up to the 6th floor in hopes of finding something to do up there, but decided to just forget about it and try to sleep. I was originally not going to sleep cause I knew it would be too hard to get back up, but I couldn't take it anymore. We saw Lo sitting by himself up there doing some work on his laptop. We looked over the ledge down to the 4th floor and it was almost 6:30am when we saw a girl sitting in the registration line for Sunday reg. EARLY. Went back to the room...and slept.

<b><u>SUNDAY:</b></u>
Ohhhh, shitastic morning. Trying to get everything together and get us checked out while being tired was an irritating task. It would have taken 30 minutes to get a luggage cart, so we just decided to do it ourselves and make a few trips. Unfortunately, the elevator waiting game was ridiculously long. They shut down 3 of the 4 elevators that went above the 20th floor...we being on the 22nd floor, and all those above us, were pretty much fucked as far as getting a quick trip up and down. Totally retarded. 2 trips with mostly everyone helping out and we were able to get the shit in the cars and back to the con center for a last wander-round. Took a few more pics. Took one last stroll through the dealer's room where I bought a Bleach skull decal and a Tensa Zangetsu prop. It was pretty nice quality and only $20, so I couldn't pass it up. I'm a weapons/props whore, so yeah. Another addition to the collection. Sandy went to the same booth a little later to buy a shorter sword from them since they sold shorter ones for $10 that she could modify into Sode no Shirayuki since she wants to redo it. We didn't have much time to do a lot since we needed to head back to Tacoma to ensure Ted was home in time to go to work. So, we rounded everyone up and said our see-you-laters before heading out. Me, Ted, Hannah, and Pam headed out first, followed by D and Chrissy later. They wanted to come back with us to watch the con tape. We got back long before they did, but they called saying they were waiting for Ron to find them so he could come, too.

It was cool cause when we got back, I had completely forgotten it was Easter. My mom hid a dozen plastic eggs out on our back deck, so she let me, Hannah, and Pam find them. LOL! It was pretty fun, actually. I hadn't done that since I was a lot younger! Kinda nostalgic. We took our candy out of them and put more inside them so we could re-hide them and have Chrissy, D, and Ron find them. We were all trying to find the hardest places to put them. I thought I had the hardest ones to find, but then again, so did Hannah and Pam. After we hid them, Pam had to go since she worked that night. When they arrived, we had them go out to look. It was so awesome to watch. I video taped it, of course! Hannah hid the hardest egg to find. It was really amusing. So, they went to get some food, but came back and we all had some of the spaghetti my mom made and watched the con tape. Epicness, galore. Me, D, and Ron 4chan'd for a bit and then everyone had to get going.

So, all in all, the con was a lot of fun, this year. Picked up <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v654/kouketsuno_rei/sakura07_stuff.jpg"">some awesome stuff</a>, too! Yeah, there were a few inconveniences and stuff, but it was all good. Great to see everyone, again, and it was cool that Lo and Tess were able to come all the way here, too. Always more fun in bigger groups when ya can. I wound up with a lot of digi pics, too...like, 315 or something. Epic con tape, as well....except for the parts where I kept accidentally hitting the record button while standing around. That button is so sensitive.

I think I'm gonna retire my Gatts costume. I've enjoyed my run with it, but I'm kinda getting tired of repairing it and lugging it around. It'll always be one of my favorites, though. Now, I'm gonna start the process of getting everything going on my Desert Punk and Hitsugaya costumes. I think those, along with my Naruto PJ's, will make up next year's roster. I don't think I'll fully retire my Kankurou costume. I think I'll just put it on hiatus until I decide what to do with it, propwise, next. Yeah. Gotta get a job to afford all that stuff, though. Good to have goals to motivate ya, huh?

Oh, and my apologies if I seemed kinda bitchy on Sunday. Checking out of the hotel got a bit strenuous and I was so tired as it was. So, sorry if I snapped at you. It wasn't intentional.

Another Sakura-con come and gone. Gotta get together with everyone soon for the post-con gathering. So, until then...

"event","Pft. Well, boredom has seemingly overwhelmed me, so I guess I'll just post some shit here. Yep, that's what I'm gonna do.

So, I'm still trying to find new work. I really kinda wish I could go back the post office. I mean, just as the job was ending, I was starting to get used to being on my feet that long, again, so that would mean I would have no problem with the job at all. It was so awesome not doing retail and being paid for it. It seems now that I may have to go back to that, though. Doing what, hasn't come to me, yet. I guess I got a few options...one of them, though hasn't been built yet, but it's still an option nonetheless.

Not much going on. Been going up and doing Nerf wars and Wii shit with Gabe, Noelle, and Jake...except for the last 2 weeks. Last weekend, I went with my parents to go bowl with some of my dad's friends. They're all pretty cool and apparently think I'm rather amusing. *shrug* I guess I have an odd knack for amusing older warped minds. I spose that's better than being in a total awkward silence. Only played 2 games and then played pool with my mom. Hey...there's nothing wrong with hanging with your folks. I'm completely unashamed to do so. I enjoy it! Definitely want to go do that, again. Bowling and billiards kicks ass.

So, I got dragged to Neighbor's with Ted and Hannah the other night. I really wasn't gonna go at first, but Hannah made the point of she hadn't seen me since the Halloween party and really wanted me to go and hang out, so I went. Besides, it was a Wednesday night, so I KNEW it would be dead there. Not to mention no cover charge and free billiards! So, took advantage of that. Now, what amused the fuck out of me was the fact that there were only 3 females, including Hannah and me, out of probably like 20 people or so, so there was a lot of flamboyant males there. There was one guy who was going to town on a stage with a railing in front of it. He coaxed this other guy to come up with him, so the dude dances over and jumps up to grab the railing, but his hands slip and he falls back right on his ass. Like, not just tripping, I mean falls off the stage's height. Then, to cover up for it, he jumps back up, slaps himself on the ass, and continues dancing. <i>Quite</i> amusing. Yeah, I'm a jerk. I'm also a loser who goes to a bar and plays Nintendo DS while everyone else freak dances.

Hmmm...gah. Sakura-con is 2 months away. It sucks cause I know I won't have a new costume for it. I had one of two choices...buy a new camcorder or do my Bleach costume. I chose the camcorder cause I REALLY need a new one. I have Fanime to take my Bleach costume to, so I'll hold out for that. THAT way I'll have a new costume that I'll wanna wear a lot which means less luggage since I won't be bringing so much propage. I guess I could technically get the costume made, but then I'll have <i>no</i> money. Just enough for the hotel room and that'd be it. Gah. I hate choosing...NO. I'll save it for Fanime. Gives me something to drive myself to get down there.

Hmmmmmmmmmm. This is such bullshit rambling. I'd also like to add making death parks in Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 is fucking hilarious. Now...I guess I'll finish watching my last couple episodes of Bleach...NOT dubbed. fuckingretardedassdubsalwaysgottabedestroyinganime.

"event","WTF is up with the weather around here. This is just getting ridiculous. I hate wind. Just watching forecasts shows there's always some kind of ""wind storm"" every other day. How irritating! I'll be glad when this shit winter is over. Worst season ever.

Nothing much else going on. Christmas was nice. Spent it with family as every year. It was nice to be able to have a few dollars to do some gift stuff with. I was fortunately able to go home from work at 4am and sleep some before getting up for festivities. After doing that, which was fun, we went to the grandparents' place for brunch and eventually dinner. Saw the family we don't ever see. Good company, good times, good food. Yep. Unfortunately, we had to leave earlier than I'd have liked so I could get home and get ready for work...which was fucking cold on that damn dock.

Worked until the night of the 28th and that was it. The month went by way faster than I expected it to. The job wasn't bad. Just hated being cold and having the foot pain after each shift. It was nice not having to deal with customers and money handling...aka retail. That was probably the best part of the job! Wasn't there long, but I got attached to some of my co-workers. They were pretty cool people.

New Year's was quiet, but nice. Ted got screwed by his work so he couldn't make it to the planned New Year's party. I didn't want him to be left out, so I skipped out and stayed home with him and the folks. At midnight, we went outside and watched a bunch of fireworks go off at nearby homes. They were pretty cool.

So, while it wasn't a bundle of money, I did buy some things I've been kind of wanting, like some anime sets for Noir, Excel Saga, and Bubblegum Crash (which didn't suck nearly as bad as most fantards said it did), some pants, and an epic new Nerf gun. Got an external CD/DVD burner to replace my crapped-out internal one. It'd be awesome if the fucking DVD-Rs would burn right. Everything else works, but the DVD-Rs always fail. Real annoying.

Anyway. Eh. Nothing else comes to mind. I guess I'll go to bed. I'm bored and if it's gonna be fucking stormy again, tomorrow, I know I'll wind up being awake throughout it. I can never sleep when it's really windy. Fucking shitty weather just needs to stop, already. It's getting old.

"event","1) Was 2006 a good year for you? 
Semi-not too bad. It was an epic year for punching babies, I must admit, though.

2) What was your favorite moment of the year?
There were quite a few really. My family getting out of the financial slump, the conventions, Pride-fest, Nerf wars, stuff like that. 

3) What was your least favorite moment of the year?
My car being dead for 9 months, having no money, almost losing my grandpa, the drama, and of course, political bullshit.

4) Where were you when 2006 began?
A New Year's party with like a million people at Sandy's.

5) Who were you with?
Didn't I just say like million people?

6) Where will you be when 2006 ends?
I don't know.

7) Who will you be with when 2006 ends?
Not sure. Family? Friends? Both?

8) Did you keep your New Year's resolution of 2006?
Regretfully, no. I didn't curbstomp 200 people (only 127), I didn't get to beat the shit out of any religious cultists, Tom Cruise didn't die, and I didn't go to any epic concerts.

9) Do you have a New Year's resolution for 2007?
I do. Not that they're anyone's business.


In the year 2007 I resolve to:
Gah...persistent, aren't you, survey?
Fine, you stupid survey...I wanna finish the pre-college hurdles and work to improve myself. Yep, survey...you a nosey fucker.


10) Did you breakup with anyone in 2006?
Break up? No. Break? Yes.

11) Did you make any new friends in 2006?
And how.

12) Who are your favorite new friends?
Eh. Too many to list.

18) What was your favorite month of 2006?
Hm. Probably a draw between March, May, and June.

19) Did you travel outside of the USA in 2006?
Does going in the ocean count as technically going outside the country? I mean, it's not like I'm on U.S. land. I'm in the ocean.

20) How many different states did you travel to in 2006?
Oregon and California.

21) Did you lose anybody close to you in 2006?
Let's just say nobody died. 

22) Did you miss anybody in the past year?
Sure.

23) What was your favorite movie that you saw in 2006?
I don't know. I really can't remember seeing anything. I guess maybe Advent Children.

24) What was your favorite song from 2006?
High and Mighty Color: Ichirin no Hana
30 Seconds to Mars: Was It a Dream?
Muse: Knights of Cydonia
MSI: Straight to Video

....fuck it. Too many others.

25) What was your favorite record from 2006?
Anti-Flag - For Blood and Empire
Muse - Black Holes and Revelations
Weird Al Yankovic - Straight Outta Lynwood


...btw...was I the only one who didn't give two shits about the Red Hot Chili Peppers' ""Stadium Arcadium""? I personally thought it sucked and a lot of the songs sounded the same.

26) How many concerts did you see in 2006?
Pft...none worth mentioning. I missed 4 concerts that I can think of that I wanted to see: Muse, MSI, Anti-Flag, and 30 Seconds to Mars.

27) Did you have a favorite concert in 2006?
.......

28) Did you drink a lot of alcohol in 2006?
Hell no. You can't get accurate aim when you're intoxicated.

29) Did you do a lot of drugs in 2006?
I've NEVER taken so much Excederin!

30) How many people did you kiss in 2006?
Like...romantically? Or like...the kiss of death? Cause those are big differences.

31) Did you do anything you are ashamed of this year?
I guess so. I wouldn't really say ashamed so much as I was disappointed in myself.

33) What was the worst lie someone told you in 2006?
Whoa...that's a toughie. Woudln't know where to begin....

34) Did you treat somebody badly in 2006?
Evidently.

35) Did somebody treat you badly in 2006?
Sure, but what can ya do.

36) How much money did you spend in 2006?
Probably about $600 and that was just this month.

37) What was your proudest moment of 2006?
Standing up for myself a bit more than I normally do; discovering my interest in a potential career path, and going through hell to get a job...even if it was for only a month. Oh, and shooting Gabe in between the eyes with a sticky dart. Nice shot.

38) What was your most embarrassing moment of 2006?
Can't really remember. Probably being called ""sir"" so much, but I'm used to that.

39) If you could go back in time to any moment of 2006 and change it what would it be?
Would have liked to get into school when I had wanted or gotten a job I wanted, earlier. Both are out of my power, so oh well.

40) What are your plans for 2007?
College, cons, pride, new job, film ""Killer Lamp""...probably more, but I'm spontaneous."

"event","Holy shit. So, the realization has dawned on me that I have exactly one week until my first official work day. I have training on Friday, but eh. I can't believe how fast this month has gone by. It's freakin' nuts! I guess trying to clean the house up for the appraisal and then waiting for all the shittastic weather to go away is the reason it's probably flown by so fast. Yep.

I'm not too worried about the job. I guess it's mild anxiety as it's been quite a while since I last actually worked. Heh, yeah, pathetic. I'm looking forward to it, but at the same time, I'm not. I need money and a sense of knowing I'm doing something, but at the same time, I'd be lying if I said I haven't enjoyed having a flexible social life. It's all good, though.

Sucktastic thing right now is the snow. I really don't want it to snow. At least not until <i>after</i> I've gone up to Seattle for my orientation. If it gets bad, I'm worried about getting up there. /pif

I'd just like to say that the Nintendo Wii is as epic as I thought it would be. Gabe and Jake came down to hang out and Pam and Noelle joined us a little later. Jake brought his Wii with him, so we hooked that bad boy up and Wii sport'd! As dorky as the Mii profiles are, they're pretty awesome. Especially the fucked up ones we made. Tiny Tim is by far the scariest one. I still want one, but I'm gonna hold out just a little longer and see whether or not any new colors for it are slated for stateside. I reallllly want a red one. I'm also looking forward to Twilight Princess, the future Resident Evil title, and Naruto 5. I'll have too see what else is coming, too! Hrm...I wonder if there'll be a Freeloader type device for imports. I hope it'll be like the GameCube one. So much easier than that mod shit for Sony consoles.

""NERF WAR FOR SUPREME EPICNESS II: Electric Boogaloo"" has been postponed.

Thanksgiving was nice. Ted and I went with out parents to the grandparents' place to spend it with the rest of the family...or at least the ones who were pleasant enough to grace everyone with their presence. A lot of awkwardness on that side of the family, but some get along better than others. It was relieving to have our grandpa there after that heart problem scare in October. So, it was a lot of sitting around and exchanging ""what's been going on in life"" stories. We don't see that side of the family often, so there's always something to talk about. The dinner was epic, as always. Lots of good stuff. Watched some holiday stuff briefly, got our share of the leftovers bagged up, and headed out. Kind of a record for us really. We were there a little over 6 hours. We usually don't stay long, so it was cool. Despite the awkward ""feuding"", it's always good to see the family. Next stop: Christmas.

Hmm...I guess I'll go back to editing my KUBE 93 sticker into a PUBE 93 sticker. Later.

*shrugs* 'kay. So, I took this 4 times and never changed the first 4 questions, but changed the bottom ones as I couldn't choose only one...but still got the same result. The one above. Then, I went with my first choice of answers and just for the hell of it, changed 2 of the first 4 and only THEN did I get a different result.

There were darts flying everywhere! It was great! It sounds lame to some, but dude, it was so cool! That's some epic entertainment right there. Who says kids only have fun? So, I scrounged up some bucks and got myself a NERF gun and some extra darts as well. THANKS GABE. Leave it to you to find entertainment in the randomest of things.

"event","Well, I went to my interview at the Tacoma P&DC, today. It was the pre-hire phase. I have to go take a drug test and get fingerprinted on Thursday morning. As I know I'm not a druggie, I'll pass, so I'm hired. Only thing is, I don't start until December 1st. Oh well, at least I have a little more free time, lol! Anyway, I barely had any sleep, whatsoever. I was pretty confident about it, but that still didn't calm my anxiety. I'd finally started to doze off and on for about an hour before Risky decided she wanted to ""talk"". So, wound up staying up. I found the place, no problem, and waited around for an hour for my turn. Signed my name on line ""lucky"" #7 and got all the nice interviewers. There were 2 that reviewed the interview packet, 1 nice, 1 pissy, and then 2 that did the actual interviews...1 nice, 1 pissy. So I got all the nice ones. *phew*

It was cool cause I pretty much got my choice of position and shift, so I picked graveyard mail handler, as I'm up all night as it is. This way I don't have to adjust my sleep schedule at all. Only suck part is that it's seasonal, so it's not going to last any longer than 8 weeks. At least it'll get some money in my account. That and I'll have some new job experience for potential future employment.

27. Are there any covers you think are better than the original?
t.A.T.u.'s cover of ""How Soon is Now"" and Aikawa Nanase's ""Roppongi Shinjyu"". Also, it's not necessarily better than the original, but I loved Brandi Carlile's cover of Radiohead's ""Creep"".

28. What food(s) do you go to the store for ASAP when you run out?
That requires caring enough to leave the house.

I was born mostly deaf. I also didn't vote for Bush.

37. What's the best field trip you ever went on?

38. Have you ever dressed up for Halloween at work?
I wore my Chris Redfield costume when I worked at GameStop, but I wasn't actually working that day.

Uhhhh...no? Yes? Maybe?

49. Ever have those moments when you realize that you somehow just cheated death?
Yeah, everyday I'm alive. That's not an emo response. I just mean, if I'm alive at the end of the day, that means I didn't die that day.

50. Does it boggle your mind?
No. I'll tell you what boggles the mind, though. Find enough boredom to complete these stupid surveys."

"event","Okay...holy crap! I spent way too much time playing <a href=""http://jet.ro/dismount"">Dismount games</a> last night. I was looking for pics for the Gaglardi thread on Gaia and happened to search for pictures of people falling down stairs...and I got the link for the Dismount games! I told Jake about them so he downloaded them, too. For something so simply made, it's hours and hours of endless fun and frustration! Though...some of you have probably already played them.

One is called ""Porrasturvat"". I've played that one before some time ago. It's a game where you push a guy down stairs and try to rack up as many points as you can by the amount of damage he takes. There's lots of angles to push him from, too.

The other game is ""Rekkaturvat"", it's the one I'd never played before. It's a game where you crash a truck into a wall after you put a guy in a certain area to inflict damage on him, whether it's in the truck, on top of it, or in front of it. It's so cheesy, but so fun! Hahahaha!

Play them! They're so stupid, yet so funny! Not to mention the music in them sounds like 70's porn!

Gotta play, again...but I've got too much to do, today. OH NOES!

"event","Ah, man. Being home all by myself is fun, but boring at the same time. Just kinda sitting here, waiting. Apparently, there's gonna be something to do, today, but I don't know what or when. Goddammit, I'm so bored. I don't feel like cleaning the house, more. The folks went to a hot rod/classic car show out at Curtis High School, today, and Ted's at work. It's TOO QUIET! *flips table <i>two times</i>* Yep, two times.

I managed to to get on a ""normal"" sleep schedule (again). It's weird. Shouldn't get too used to it, though. No matter how many times I regulate my sleep, it gets fucked up, again. Eh, oh well. The good part is, I'm up when everone else who is home is, so that's kinda cool. I get to go places a little more when I'm up at ""decent"" hours, too. Liiike, going to get shoes with my mom. Originally, I just went for something to do and to get outta the house, but I got some shoes out of it, too. That's kinda cool, cause I haven't had new ones in like...2 years.

I've been playing more classic SNES RPGs. Still playing ""Lufia II"" and ""Zelda: ALTP"", but I've played those a million times, so skimming through the countless games on the list, I found some fan-translated RPGs I thought I'd take a whack at. So, I'm playing the ""Sailormoon"" and ""Ranma 1/2"" RPGs. The Ranma one is kinda...gay. You'd think the Sailormoon one would be the gay one, but it's actually more fun...not to mention translated better. I wanted to play the ""Lodoss War"" one, but it's translations are fucked up and the game is a little glitched. /sob. Then, D and Hannah came over last night. Played ""Champions: Return to Arms"". Sorta gay at first, but it got better...for what we played, anyway.

So, I'm going down to the ocean, again, at the end of the month with the family. I'm pretty stoked about that. I love going down there. Bodyboarding and stuff is always cool. Blading in town and lots of pictures to take. I still think cosplay pics would be awesome at certain places there. Too far, though. Then, it's cool how clear the sky is at night. Since the city lights are so far away from the place we stay, it's awesome to see the planets and stars since the sky is so dark. I know that the Milky Way, Venus, Jupiter, and maybe Saturn, are visible, but Mars and Mercury will be too close to the sun to be able to see well, if at all. /pif.

Fucking YAWN. OMG, I'M BORED. I'm gonna go make a sammich.

"event","Okay, seriously? There is a point to my title. Though...I think only Shady-kun will get the joke...but that's okay. It's still funny. I've been feeling nostalgic this last week, which is the main purpose of this entry. Anywho!

Okay, so ridiculously insane boredom hit me like a tire iron recently so I went browsing the <a href=""http://www.shoujoai.com"">Shoujoai.com</a> forums looking for something to read and somehow nostalgia and morbid curiosity after reading a thread compelled me to check out that ""Pretty Guardian Sailormoon"" live action series thingie. I watched all of it and surprisingly didn't hate it. It was pretty good in a nostalgic kind of way cause I can't believe it's been 10 years since my Moonie-days. Time really fucking flies. Memories come back to you...not just the show stuff, mind you, but the friends you shared those memories with. The notes we all exchanged between classes and crap that were just riddled with funny anecdotes, comics, doodles, the pairings we shipped, and of course, obligatory aliases. Haaaah...it's weird when you aren't friends with your old friends, anymore. Whether it's for better or for worse, you never forget those (weird) days.

Anyway, moving on. After watching that series, the nostalgia bug kept nagging me, so I went off to check out some of the old stuff I used to love. Bless you, Intarweb! Anyway, I came across a webpage full of the Urban Legends of Sailormoon. Some of that shit is funny as hell! One of the legends listed had me go look up some old eps on youtube.com (yes...cursed youtube.com) and check out some of those things. I came across an episode where Usagi acted like a ninja and failed miserably at it. It reminded me of a time when Shady and I thought up this thing about a crappy ninja who wore a nametag that said ""Hello, my name is: Shittiest Ninja"". We found that fucking hilarious and after thinking about it again, it's still funny! *wipes tear* ""HOO boy, dat's sawm fawnnee fawkin' sheet, mawther fawker!"" Er, I guess you'd had to have been there.

So yeah, I've been reliving some of the old days this last week and I must say, it's been pretty entertaining. Hahaha! Well, since being bitten by the nostalgia bug, common sense dictates, I gotta keep checking stuff out! I'm really enjoying this trip down memory lane! Not to mention basking in some of those shoujo-ai pairings, old and new, that I shipped back then. XD

Yep, good times, good times. Hmmm...I guess this post wasn't as poignant as I inteded it to be. I was gonna reminisce a little more, but that's okay. I gotta finish reading something so I can go to sleep.

Whoo-whoo for being a fantard after all these years! LOL!

"event","Okay, to sum it up, really hot outside and crowded. Not saying that that's a bad thing. It was a good weekend, though. Lots of stuff going on throughout the whole time. Seattle's Pride fest, Hannah's 21st birthday, UPC 3 at Gasworks, then Ted's 23rd birthday. See? Lots of stuff!

<b>FRIDAY:</b>
Friday afternoon, Hannah came over and I met Brian, a friend of her's from RO who's visiting. Got all my shit together after having next to no sleep and we all drove up to Silverdale to stay the night at D, Chrissy, and Francis's new apartment. Got there around 7pm or so and we basically blew off sleep as long as possible and played Naruto 4, Halo 2, and other video games till like 3am. I came to the conclusion that the Xbox 360 isn't a horrible system, it's just not one I really wanna shell the bucks out for for a number of reasons. Anyway, didn't sleep much at all that night. It was hotter than fuck and the fact that their couches are leather didn't help matters any. It's like sitting on a vinyl carseat in 90 degree heat for hours on end. Yeah, hot and sweaty feeling. Gross. I didn't actually sleep really at all. Maybe an hour. I started to drift off better, but that was around 11am...when everyone was getting up...and so Saturday started.

<b>SATURDAY:</b>
All I gotta say is, after sleeping on that couch and feeling all gross...I got to take the best shower ever. Feeling clean after a night like that was the most refreshing thing in the world! Anyway, we were gonna take the ferry over to Seattle and wander around the Saturday portion of Pride...but we didn't. I later found out that I was right and there <i>were</i> festivities going on at Capitol Hill. The ""Queer Fest on the Hill"" was going on. So, it's the same pride fest as always, just organized by different people. Complete with their own parade and same events at Volunteer Park. Wished we woulda went now. Oh well. I at least know to go next year, then. So, we went and got some food and went back to the apartment and watched ""Grandma's Boy"" and ""Running Scared"". Both are fucked up movies, but in different ways. One was hilarious, the other, freakishly fucked up. I liked them, though. After that, played Perfect Dark Zero and then went to get Chrissy from work so we could catch the ferry to Seattle. It was about midnight when we finally left the dock. I've never been on the ferry at night, but it was awesome! The night air was calm and clean and smelled really great. The stars were out and showed up really well once we were in the middle of route. It was dark, so it looked so nice. The city lights when we got to Seattle were awesome, too. Made our way over to Sandy's after getting off the ferry. She's just gotten back from Taiwan and went to the Pillows concert, so she was like...tired. Lots. We all knew we had to get up early, but just couldn't find it in ourselves to sleep. Well, some of us, anyway. Gabe even came over at like 3am. Around 5am, we all went to sleep. Or in my case, tried. Once again, I got about an hour of sleep. It was too hot and Hannah stole my fucking favorite spot on the floor, so I slept in the other room. As usual, as I started to sleep...it was time to get up.

<b>SUNDAY:</b>
As much as I would have rather stayed asleep, I knew I should get up. The last couple Pride fests, we've always tried to get up early enough to catch the beginning of the parade, but we never do. This year, I forced myself up and sure enough, we made it. We had a nice place in the shade on 4th and Denny across the street from the 7-11. Got lots of pics and video tape. The parade seemed a little calmer, but I think that's because they were testing the new location and the fact that it was televised this year. <b>BTW, those who care to rewatch it, channel 11 is rebroadcasting it on July 9th at 10pm if anyone wants to see it, again.</b> It had parts where there were big gaps and people kept leaving thinking it was over, but we overheard someone say it wasn't, so we stayed. It gapped out two or three times, but we stayed till the end. Walked over to Seattle Center afterwards. The heat was intense, but tolerable. Briefly ran into Akiko at the center house. Gabe wasn't there cause he sucks. I never got a chance to meet her parents who were visiting, but she pointed them out in the crowd at least! Met up with Tarra and Theo and then went wandering. Sat under a shady tree and watched stuff. The ""rave"" in the center fountain was pretty cool. Anyway, Sandy, Chrissy, Ron, and Brian went to Aleeza's UPC shoot at Gasworks a short time later and the rest of us stayed. Ted and Monty showed up awhile later. Then Tarra and Theo took off. Wandered a little and then Ted and Monty took off. So, me, D, and Hannah were left. Her mom and sisters were there, but disappeared in the crowd. We got a call from Tarra and Theo asking if we'd give them a ride to the UPC, so we left the center and went to Gasworks Park after picking them up. Got there around 7pm. There were still people actually there! I mean, it did start at like 3pm and it was really hot out, so it was surprising to see people still braving the heat. Any cosplayer knows that sometimes, it burns to wear costumes in heat. After the shoot, we went to Red Robin for Hannah's birthday. She got a few drinks bought for her. We had like...14 people? Me, Tarra, Theo, Hannah, Brian, Chrissy, D, Ron, Sandy, Aleeza, Jackie, Chris, Joe(?), and Matt. Yikes. After that, went to the Parlor, a billiards club. Hannah got another drink as did everyone else. Then played 2 games of pool. The first game was me and Ron vs. Chris and Sandy. Somehow, we won. Then, game 2 was me and Ron vs. Chris and D. D played a very epic game considering Chris stopped playing half way through. It even got down to a battle over the 8 ball. It was an epic game. Somehow, we won that one, too ><'. We'd have played again, but we needed to haul ass to catch the last ferry. We crammed Ron into the car since he originally didn't come over on the ferry with us. He took it over himself, but we all needed to get there. So, he layed across the laps in the backseat. It was a crazy ride. We got into the home stretch behind Qwest field to the ferry dock and had to dodge a cop who was in the lane next to us. We made it though with only 3 minutes to spare. The fucking sucktastic part was...it was FORTY FUCKING DOLLARS to go to Bremerton as opposed to $14 to go to Seattle. BIG difference. I knew it costed more to go from Seattle to Bremerton...I didn't know it was THAT much more. Anyway, everyone was half dead, so I was the only one out on the viewing dock. It was too nice a night not to. So, I went the whole ride outside looking at the stars and stuff. Docked, dropped Ron off, dropped Chrissy and D off, drove back to Tacoma, and I fell asleep as soon as I layed down.

Tuesday was Ted's 23rd birthday. Hannah, Brian, and I went up to Seattle and took him with. Bought some dango and udon. Happy day! Hannah bought Ted a manga and we hung out awhile. Woulda done more probably, but we needed to be back by 7pm cause my mom was making Ted dinner. Picked him up a cake and then went home. Watched all 3 AMV Hells before Hannah and Brian took off. Did Ted's cake thingie at 11pm and then that was about it. His present from me is still on it's way. ^^ I'm sure he'll like it. Cause if he doesn't, I'll jam it down his throat! /gg

Soooo...for those in the area who give a rat's ass, Ted and I are going to Tacoma's pride fest. Anyone else going?

And now...time for sleep. If I don't now, the sun will come up and it'll be too hot to sleep.

"event","Haven't done a whole hell of a lot since my <i>epic</i> return from San Jose, but eh. I can say that I've been bored out of my fucking mind, though! I've gone out 3 times since I've been back. It's really quite sad. /sob

A lot of us went to a housewarming party at Francis, D, and Chrissy's new apartment. It was hella crowded, but it's all good. Getting out and seeing everyone is always a good thing. Lots of people I knew, some I didn't. Exchanged some Fanime pics, Naruto'd it up on the Gamecube, and then after most of the people got drunk or tired, Jake and I entertained ourselves by throwing a foam ball into a lampshade for about an hour and a half. It was actually more fun than it sounds! Then, wandered around the place, drank lots of oddly flavored 7-up, and watched the ""Wacky Delly"" episode of Rocko's Modern Life. Twas rather epic, yes.

Saturday was awesome. I went over to Pam's to hang out with her, Noelle, Gabe, Jake, Chris, Aleeza, and a friend of Noelle's who's name I never actually got. Got over there and watched Jake's US History project film which was funny as hell. Since the housewarming party, we've been plotting our epic horror film, ""Killer Lamp"" and more and more ideas come all the time. It's going to be so fucking awesome...and epic. Yes, epic. <i>Insanely</i> epic! You don't even know how epic it will be because you don't know the meaning of epic until you've been a part of the epicness that is ""Killer Lamp"". Please note that I love the word ""epic"". Anyway, we plotted that some and watched Pam play Suikoden V. Went to IHOP after that and I had banana stuffed french toast. It was actually really good. Went back and made obscene gestures and noises at pedestrians. Got back to Pam's and we decided to Naruto it up on the Gamecube. Noelle hooked up the import Gamecube that we lovingly dubbed ""the Toaster"". It looks like a toaster and does so much shit you'd expect it to actually be able to make toast. Anyway, put the game in and went to load the memory card and the toaster erased my data!!! 31.5 hours and my 910,000 point Anko score attack, GONE!!! I only needed to unlock Sharky McSharkShark, Kabuto, and Akamaru and I'd have everyone! Fucking /sob! So, we tried checking the card on Pam's domestic Gamecube, but it was already gone, so we just played with the stock characters until we got bored. Played a few 1 player missions to unlock some stuff, but if you've played Naruto 4, you know it's monotonous to unlock characters. So, played a little more 4-player mode and then went and watched some AMV Hell clips before everyone headed out. Since then, though, I've gotten about 75% of my lost data back. That's a lot of fucking playing, but it's better than sitting there being pissed off and doing nothing. /pif

In ""work"" related news, I'm still in the process of playing phone tag with a potential employer. It's pissing me off to no end. I <i>hate</i> phone tag. It's like...why fucking call me at all to offer me a job if you're just gonna give me the fucking run around? It's a waste of my time and theirs! Good news is, I got my results from the post office entrance exam back. I got an 80.5% on it! I'm quite surprised really considering I didn't study much. I crammed the night before as well as I could and didn't sleep a wink before the test. I'd been up for 24 hours already and still had to sit around for 4 hours to take the test still, so I think I did pretty fucking well for next-to-no studying and absolutely no sleep. So, I'm on the register to be considered for employment. I reallllllly hope they call me for a job. They got some bitchin' pay and benefits I could really use!

I guess according to my dad, I might be getting my car fixed within the next month. I really hope so. I can't believe it's like the day before the official first day of summer and I don't have a car. It's been almost 5 months since I've driven it. That depresses me!! I miss my car. So, hopefully, everything works out and I can get it back up and running. When I do, I'm giving it a hardcore detail job. Poor thing has been sitting there getting weathered and it makes me sad. So yeah.

Holy fucking shit...it's like...7am. I'm really tired and I've officially fucked up my sleep schedule, yet again. So, time to sleep and then stay up for like 24 hours after that and RE-regulate, again. Yeah. Whatta bunch of crap! ><;

"event","Quick little note. Since my last post, one of my ears have popped finally and my nose is clearing up a lot. Still a little bit of pressure, but way better than I was over the weekend. Anyway, let's see. One, two, three, four, pick it up, here we go.

Fanime 2006, down in San Jose, California. Everyone there: me, Aleeza, Dorjan, Sandy, Pam, Tess, Rose, Atobe, Chris, and Meg staying in our room and then Lo and Shkurygin came by some of the days, too. Sadly, Ted couldn't make it down this year. We missed him, but we all understood his reasons. Besides, we're planning to make it for Kumoricon, so that'll be good. Anywho, it was so cool to see everyone! Whatta craaaazy weekend! I had a really great time down there, except for my weekend-long sinus headache and ears that wouldn't pop. Quite a trip, it was, though. So, let's see how much I can remember. 

<b><u>THURSDAY:</b></u>
Got up around 1pm. I would have much rather slept a little longer, but I just couldn't. It was too warm and my mind was too full. So, I got up and got the last minute stuff together. Got dropped off at Aleeza's a little before 7pm. It was me, Aleeza, and her brother Dorjan and we took his car down. We miraculously got all the stuff to fit in the car, but realized that the car was already lowered prior to putting stuff in it, so the back end was riding a little low to the tire. We rode around the block to see how it'd manage and all seemed doable. So, one stop for gas and we were on our way down. Lots of talking and stuff until around midnightish. The rain started falling and when we got into the more...mountainy outskirts it got really dark. No street lights or anything. So, it was hard to see. To top all that off, the windshield wiper on the driver's side of the car stopped working. OMGWTF! We stopped at a Pilot truckstop and Dorjan worked on the problem. After about an hour of work and rain, we were back on the road. When we got to the Siskiyou Forest area, there was this 7 mile declining hill with lots of turns. OMFG...my ears were killing me! We crossed into California shortly after. We stopped at a rest area in Yreka and then stopped again around Weed to fuel up and stop for an hour nap. I didn't sleep, myself.

<b><u>FRIDAY</b></u>
Then, back to driving. Through, Redding... Red Bluff... Corning... and eventually through Oakland with a view of San Francisco and onward to San Jose...but not before an hour's worth of traffic. Anyway, we finally arrive at the hotel and check in and get all our stuff up to the 18th floor. Then, went to get our press badges and look for everyone and some food. Everyone in our room was there except for Chris and Meg who were coming the following day. We all wandered around the con areas in different groups. The elevators in the Marriott were so slow. I was waiting for 3 minutes for one to come. When I heard it coming, I could hear the song ""What is Love"" playing and then the doors opened and there like 8 people in it doing the head thing from ""Night at the Roxbury"". It'd have been funnier if I'd had my video camera, but I didn't , so I was kind of annoyed I waited 3 minutes for that. Eh. So, I came into the room and noticed everyone putting on costumes. I wasn't planning on cosplaying that day cause I was so tired, but seeing everyone wearing them, I gave in. So, I wore my Gatts costume. Rose brought her makeup stuff from school and was doing makeup for people who wanted it done. Rose wanted to know if I wanted anything done. My Gatts costume only has a scar across the bridge of the nose, but we'd mentioned it was a pretty bloody anime, so Rose was like ""Okay, so like do you want me to beat the shit out of you or what?"" and I'm like ""Well, I've never answered yes to that question before, but okay."" So, she used all her nifty makeup and gave me like realistic cuts and scratches and a black eye! <a href=""http://images.cosplay.com/showphoto.php?photo=698267""> It was really awesome!</a> After the costume preps, everyone went down to the convention area. Ran into a group of teens who were really impressed with my sword, so they all wanted to get to hold it and have a pic of themselves with it and then one of me with it, too. Flattering really, but took a little while longer than I'd have liked. LoL. Eventually found everyone taking pics and stuff. Pretty much just wandered around taking pics and getting pics taken for the rest of the night. Stopped at stage Zero and watched a few AMVs they were showing there. There was a funny one of FMA to Sublime's ""Date Rape"". It was so wrong, but hilarious. If you've heard the song, at the end, the lyric, ""...he was buttraped by a large inmate"", just picture Al's suit of armor and let your mind do the rest. X_x. Sandy and Tess were sitting there in their Al and Ed costumes, too. Got a little laugh and such. Anywho, went back to the room, ordered like 10 pizzas and some turned in for the night (me being one of them) and the rest went out wandering.

<b><u>SATURDAY</u></b>
Woke up around 10am and decided to cosplay. We all got ready and Rose did my makeup, again. Headed down into the convention area and wandered. Dorjan and me followed Pam who went looking for one of her RO friends, Var. Ran into Al (Eurobeat King) and talked for a few with him and he took some pics of me of Dorjan. Found Pam who then found Var. He was still in the huge line for registration, so we ran by the Bleach photoshoot to get some pics of Lo with the other Bleach cosplayers. Everyone was kind of in seperate groups, again, so it was more random wandering. After about 4 hours, I got overheated in my costume and decided it was time to change out. I needed to take more pics and video anyway. I have a hard time getting pics and vid shots when I'm in costume. Too much to carry in general and I only have one functioning arm in my Gatts costume. I went back to the room and then Chris and Meg showed up. They were pretty tired so they layed down for a bit to relax after their drive. I wasn't sure if I wanted to wear my Gatts costume, again, later, so I left the makeup on. Went back down to take pics and stuff. Got some double-take glances from people passing by who saw my makeup. Since I wasn't in a costume, it was a little odd to have a ""beaten"" face. LOL!! Scoped out the dealer's room and artist alley where I hung around Aleeza's booth for a bit. Went outside and saw a Resident Evil gathering taking photos, so I hung around there and took lots of pics. Night time rolled around and I went back to the room to shower before the whole group came back. I was gonna go to sleep, but I was too warm in the room, so I put on my Night-time Naruto costume and wandered back to the con area. Sat around with Sandy, Tess, Aleeza, and Lo and messed around. Got randomly poked by a person who recognized my pajamas and then told me they were wearing a concept ""Orochimaru pajamas"" costume. Pretty funny! Eventually, around 3am, everyone was getting delirious and everything was funny. Said excuses to get away from people like ""Yeah, that's great. Gotta go, my grandmother's on fire"" and stuff. I love saying that. Rose and Atobe found us a little later after leaving the rave. Then, time to go to sleep.

<b><u>SUNDAY</b></u>
Got up about 10am, again. Everyone was getting ready for another day. Sandy and Tess were getting ready to go the FMA photoshoot. I got up and did my Kankurou makeup and put my costume on. I wanted to be sure I'd be up early enough to find out when the Naruto photoshoot was since there wasn't a scheduled meet at Sakura-con because someone is an idiot. Anywho, headed down, took some pics of the FMA shoot, then noticed a small group of Naruto cosplayers playing ""Ninja Twister"". It was pretty funny to watch. They had a boombox there playing the Naruto music while they played. Eventually, it turned out that the Naruto shoot was at 2pm, so everyone was pretty much gathering for it. There were quite a few people, but last year's shoot looked bigger. Anyway, they sorted everyone by village and did group shots of them. There were 3 other Kankurous besides me. There was even a Sasori cosplayer! It was cool! After the village shots, we all ""paraded"" across a few intersections to a park in the middle of the street and took character pics. Some were pretty funny, too. Lots of odd stares as there was opposing lanes of traffic on either side of this park. Other passersby stopped to watch, too. After awhile, I headed back to con center and got a few more pics before I started getting tired and hungry. Not to mention I sort of fucked up my makeup when I got an itch in my throat and started coughing. It made my eyes water really bad, so my eye makeup got messed up. Went back to the room, changed, and sat down for a bit. Ate some leftover pizza and a chocolate muffin, watched a little Harry Potter 3, and then joined Aleeza and Dorjan to head to the cosplay event. It was cool having a press pass cause I got to sit in the second row to video tape the event. I taped the whole cosplay! It was entertaining. I enjoyed myself. We were there from 6pm to 10:30pm. After that, headed back, and looked for people. Kind of got separated. Chris and Meg saw me and we went back to the room so I could drop off my stuff. Went back downstairs, called Sandy wondering where they were all at. Stopped at an info booth and found a pamphlet for San Jose tourism with a picture of a girl screaming on it standing next to a stream of water shooting up next to her. It looked more like someone next to her got vaporized. We laughed a lot at that. I wrote ""SAN JOSE: THIS COULD BE YOU"" on the picture and wrote ""daddy's lil' mistake"" on the girl's swimsuit. Then I said if I ever cosplayed as Hughes from FMA, I'd carry that pic around like it was the guy's daughter he's always talking about! LOL (btw, I'd never cosplay Hughes). I also thought that <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v654/kouketsuno_rei/vaporized.jpg"">""I GOT VAPORIZED IN SAN JOSE""</a> would be a great tagline for that picture, too! Hahaha! Lo took the pic with him and I never saw it, again. Requested Sandy grab another pamphlet before she left. Anyway, we decided maybe we'd go check out the Hentai room to get some laughs. Sandy, Tess, Pam, and Lo went back to get IDs and such, so Chris, Meg, and I waited around for them...for an hour. So we went to the H room ourselves and got some laughs. God, those crazy hentai movies! When we were walking out, this one girl was like ""OMG, it wasn't so bad, but why did she have to grow 3 dicks!?"" We busted up at that. Headed back to the room and decided that was it. I started packing up my stuff I wouldn't need later and then headed to bed.

<b><u>MONDAY</b></u>
Got woken up at 7:30am. Dorjan had to be at work at 8am the next day, so the 3 of us had to leave early. So, got everything packed and rolled out at 8:30am. Stopped at McDonald's for some breakfast real quick and then we left. Took a wrong turn at a fork in the highway and ended up in San Francisco. It was okay, except for the toll bridges. Took a few pics and gased up before moving on. Stopped briefly in Corning at a (gasp) Flying J cause I needed some medicine and to use the bathroom. Now, being there, I was like...this isn't so bad. The place looked nice, the people were friendly, they had lots of room, bigger restrooms, more stuff... it was just a much more pleasant atmosphere than the Flying J I worked at. If the one I was at had been that nice, I could probably have tolerated it more. Go figure. Kept driving on and stopped at Castle Crag State Park to gas up. The views in Northern California are really nice and it was a really nice day to take pictures, so I took pics on the drive through of the park, Mt. Shasta, the hills, all kinds of views. Stopped somewhere near Halsey, OR to gas up, again, and then it was a straight shot back to Tacoma. No traffic or anything. A nice smooth ride back with no issues. Got back home at exactly 9pm just as Dorjan guessed.

So...that's the trip. Didn't really buy anything worth mentioning. Snagged a Gaia Online poster, though. Anyway, a tiring, yet really fun weekend. I'm glad I had the chance to go and I wanna thank Ted, Aleeza, Dorjan, Sandy, Tarra, and Theo for everything you guys did to help me have the chance to be there. I really appreciate all the help you offered and gave and it really made me feel special. Hopefully, I'll get this job I'm lined up for and that way I'll be better prepared to get to Kumoricon in September. I'm also looking forward to next year's Fanime. It's a really awesome convention and if you haven't had the chance to go, give it a try.

"event","Well, back from Fanime. Good times had by all, but like all convention weekends, it went so fast. I just wish I hadn't been so blah! The trip down was eventful. The trip back was a blur as it's like....holy crap, tired. I got home, unpacked, updated my mom on my trip, and went to bed. Slept the whole night through after taking some meds, but I still feel fatigued. Eh, all's well. Still happy I got to go.

I brought back a sinus headache and severe pressure in my ears that I've had since I got there. Didn't let it mess my fun up, too much, though. Going to sleep was the only part of the weekend I never looked forward to, as my sinuses and ears drove me and probably everyone else in our room nuts from all the sniffling, possible snoring, and my complaints about the problem. So yeaaaaaah, sorry about that. I never get ""sick"" at conventions, so I was a bit miffed with that situation. Stupid ears...stupid sinuses.

But yeah, I'll elaborate on my weekend more, later, when my ears clears up. I can barely hear myself typing. It's so faint, but you know it's happening...and it's MADDENING! AJS:DJ:LAKSDJ:AJSIHOIhyb.

Later. ^^

"event","Okay, so it's still looking good for me to go to Fanime. I got a call back from Tarra and that helps even more, so '00t. I'm coming up with the rest of the moneys, at least enough to the last penny to get me there, hopefully, so it should be okay.

Ted had an unfortunate bit of luck and got a flat tire on the freeway in Federal Way, yesterday. So, my dad and I went to go help him out cause Ted wasn't sure about it since it's a new car and all, so he didn't want to fuck it up. We got stuck in traffic on the way there, so it took like 45 minutes to get somewhere that normally takes like 20. When we got there, my dad removed the tire and we were confident that it would just need to be plugged since it was just a small nail. We took it to Les Schwab and they said that the rim shredded the inner wall of the tire. There was about a handful of shredded rubber inside the tire. The guy suggested we take it back to the Suzuki dealership and see what they could do since the car is still practically brand new. It's only been here less than a month. So, we take it down the street which was conveniently next to the tire shop and they say the tire is no longer manufactured. Okay, I can understand that, but you can't tell me that there's nothing you can do about it. I mean, shit, most all dealerships have a warranty for that. ESPECIALLY for as little time as he's had the car! Well, nope. They all but said fuck off. So, poor Ted had to shell out the bucks for a mismatched tire. Hasn't even had the car a month. Those style tires aren't cheap, either. My dad is less than thrilled with that outcome. So, I guess he's gonna check into it with the warranty people, not the actual dealership employees.

Sooo, back to Fanime. I can't believe it. Day after tomorrow I'm rolling outta here. Just shocking. I'm really looking forward to seeing everyone. Last year was weird cause when we were there, it was just me, Ted, Aleeza, Sandy, and Chong. We didn't know anyone else! Whereas, at Sakura-con, you recognize or know just about everybody. How is it that it's come up so fast for me? I've been killing time! How...? Reliving the past with...

...VINTAGE VIDEO GAMES!! Since Ted got his Xbox modded, there are soooo many games to relive and ones to play that I never had a chance to play. Right now, I'm wrapped up in Lufia II. I loved that game. Ted loved it more than I did! Then, playing all the SNES Final Fantasy and Bomberman games and the NES Zelda and Castlevania games...just to name a FEW. Some old Atari ROMS and even some Colecovision! *wipes tear* Memoriiiiies~. It's so cool to relive the good days and now I've killed enough time for it to be trip time! Huzzah'd!

I might have a job coming up, finally. It's a shitastic job, but it's better than nothing and they <i>are</i> the first ones to call me. I'm still gonna wait around for the post office and if they do offer me a job, I'll take it. Anyway, it's working in the home department at Fred Meyer. Now, before I think it totally sucks, I've thought of the good points...like, it's primarily a floor position, which means limited-to-no cash handling. They have the same union as Ted's store which means some benefits if I stay long enough. It's like...10 or so minutes away from my house as opposed to 35 minutes for my last job. So, yeah, I'm supposed to get in touch with them next Wednesday. Hopefully it works out. I'll work there through the summer at least and hopefully get into school in the Fall. Since my course of study is full time, I'd rather not go to school on top of work. Too stressful.

Whew...things are looking up. Fanime might be my last fling before re-entering the work world (fucking finally). I got pretty pessimistic about finding work on my own after being fired. I mean, evidently being fired is frowned upon by most prospective employers. So, since I know I can at least find <i>something</i> regardless of my previous termination, I say, ""FUCK YOU MATT PANIPINTO! YOU CAN'T KEEP ME DOWN!"" Random to some of you, I know, but he's the reason I got fired from my last job. Tried so hard and succeeded in getting me in trouble only to quit <i>his</i> job there shortly after. Now he's a scuba diver off the coast of Louisiana and I hope he never comes back! Choke motherfucker, choke!

Rambling...oops. Okay, time to play some more games and live it up. If I get hired, my very lazy days are gone...and my kinda lazy days will be here. So, back to killing time! Probably won't update again before I leave, so see everyone at Fanime!

Okay, so like, ya know the opening theme to Full Metal Alchemist, ""READY STEADY GO""? (I can't stand L'Arc~en~Ciel btw) Okay, so I opened a can of soda and let it sit there. It's dead quiet in my house at the moment and I while I was reading something, I faintly heard the opening guitar riff from the that song...coming from the fizz in my soda. WTF~~~~!

*punches self in face* WHY would I know or hear that? I've barely watched much FMA, let alone enough to know the song! Ted plays it in his room sometimes, but jeez! /swt

"event","Wow...Fanime...one week. If all goes right, I'll be on the road in just one week. This crept up way too fast! ><;

It's kinda stressful, though. I mean, Aleeza and I have no solid plan just yet. Since Pam is flying down and like 2 other people bailed on us, we've been kinda S.O.L. cause we won't be able to afford the rental car on our own. Then, we find out the little details about the policies of renting vehicles. Well, I don't have a major credit card, but I'm 25. Aleeza does, but isn't 25. Renters under 25 are charged an additional $25 per day of the rental...non refundable it sounds like. I could use a debit, but I'd have to have an additional 150% over the cost of the rental on my card as well. So, we debated who had a car. Mine still isn't fixed yet. I can't use Ted's old car cause it's too old for that hard a trip. I guess Matt and Dorjan both drive stick shifts. So yeah, it's like ""what do we do now?"" We've tossed around some ideas and only one seems to have a possibility of working.

Now, I know what the last suggestion would be...fucking flying. Nope. Can't afford that on top of the registration fee and hotel fee. Not to mention, I can't take all my stuff. Like, I'm planning ot bring some food of my own since I won't have much money, if any, left to eat with. Can't cosplay if I fly, either, which is 1 of the 3 reasons I wanted to drive down in the first place...which are taking a road trip, it <i>is</i> cheaper, and I can cosplay. Then, the train is just as expensive as flying and the bus doesn't have a trip down for the time I need.

So, while I'm getting anxious to go, I'm not 100% certain I am. I'm not giving up though. I'm trying to stay optimistic. Some stuff has come up and I've gotten more positive, so I'm just hanging in there and whatever happens, happens.

Hopefully, I'll see everyone who's going next week. I got my fingers crossed.

"event","Haven't really done a poignant update in awhile.

Haven't done much since the con. Just looking for jobs, hanging out with friends, playing video games, still waiting to repair my car, and ""playing"" Gaia online. Ted got his Xbox modded with a few thousand old school roms. It's been quite nostalgic playing those games. The car situation isn't as bad. Ted has since gotten a new car since he got his new job and now the rest of the family has been rotating use on his old car. So, I have some wheels every now and then instead of not at all. Which is why I'm spending money to go to Fanime instead of fixing my car right away.

Gaia online. Who'd have thought I'd play that. It's perverted, it's kinda boring, it's riddled with fantards, and there's no real RP interaction. It's all forum stuff and I'm not really patient enough to forum RP. On the other hand, though, making the AVs is fun, playing some of the mini games is fun, and spamming our GAGLARDI thread is fucking awesome. Not to mention making fun of the idiots who think we're stupid. Heh heh. I made myself a custom Gaia online Anko and an Itachi for Chrissy to put in our signatures. Couldn't help it. I've been a real Narutard lately. Mostly since they did the Anko arc in the filler eps. So, I've been kinda in a kick lately. I do that sometimes.

What else? Hmmm. Whoa...Fanime is less than 2 weeks away. I'm still not 100% positive (more like 80% positive) I'm going, but I'm doing what I can and I've been thankfully and appreciatively given some options thanks to Tarra and Theo. I mean, I guess it does seem like I'm trying too hard to go to this convention, but I love Fanime and almost all my friends will be there. Well, the ones that aren't going to AX, anyway! LOL! Not to mention it's going to be a ROAD trip. I haven't taken a road trip since (icky) Yaoi-con '01. I've been planning to road trip down there for months and I'd hate to have it fall through now. AND I'd feel terrible if I couldn't go and had to bail on Aleeza. >.<

Gah, ya know, I have been feeling really moochy. I mean, Pam has been tremendously generous and has helped me to look for work and Tarra and Theo helping me with the whole Fanime trip issue. And everyone else who has been kind enough to loan me a few bucks to get some food and stuff. I just want everyone to know it has <i>not</i> gone unappreciated. You all know who you are and thank you.

The job hunt goes on. It fucking bites, but at least I'm trying. Well, I guess it'll be like 3 weeks until I hear back on that post office test. Wondered how long it would take. It went better than I thought it would. I was pretty nervous about it, but I  finished the whole thing and even got to leave early. A few days ago, Pam told me about a Costco that might be hiring. So, put in for that right away. Among other things. Haven't gotten any word on any of them, though.

I guess I'm gonna go down and fight with the financial aid people at the college, again. I've missed 2 quarters that I could already have behind me. It's pissing me off. I just wanna go to school, find a part-time job, and feel like I'm doing something with my life. I mean, everyone has some direction or options. I'm still the same as I was the day I graduated high school and I while I'm not against enjoying my youth, I want people to see that I <i>can</i> do something with myself and that I've got some direction. My 10 year high school reunion is in 3 years. 3 <i>years</i>. I was never involved much in school activities, but morbid curiosity compells me to go to it and if I do, I wanna at least go not being exactly like I did 10 years ago. Career and education wise, anyway. I want some direction and I don't want people seeing me as being dependent on everyone or being a mooch or <i>completely</i> lazy. I already know I'm lazy, but you can be lazy and still have some direction.

Hmmm. This turned out differently than I thought. Heh, I wasn't planning on doing self reflection, but that's okay.

Well, it's officially Mother's day. I feel kinda bad cause I can't really afford to do anything super spectacular for my mom. My mom isn't materialistic (though she loves to buy stuff like anyone would) and she knows we love her very much, but it's still nice to do something <i>extra</i> special for her. Now, those who know me and Ted know we have an excellent relationship with our parents and we'd do anything for them, so on Mother's day, Ted and I try to do something really special, but it never quite works out. We're either strapped for cash or my mom insists we don't do anything <i>because</i> of money issues, but it doesn't mean we don't feel like asses. What's worse is her birthday is on the 24th. Double whammy of guilt! >< Yikes! I hope we can whip something together for her.

I guess I'll go do some planning. Got lots of planning to do. For mom and for this convention. Whaaa~

Anyway, my 25th birthday fell on the Sunday of Sakura-con which I'm sure will never happen, again. LOL! March is early for Sakura-con, but it was just the perfect time for me since just about everyone I know attends the con and being my birthday, it was nice to see everyone during it.

I wanted to thank everyone who wished me well and/or spent the day with me! It truly meant a lot to me to spend the day with almost literally all my friends and family. I don't really do anything on my birthdays. They usually pass and some people are like ""WTF, your birthday was then!?"" Hahaha! Anyway, but yeah, it was great to have a birthday on a con day cause it was cool to be able to spend the day with lots of people. Also, thank you to those who ventured down to Tacoma with me so I could spend some of the day with my folks, too!

Also, thanks to:

Ted & Monty - for the Rukia plush and Rukia/Kon keychains
Chrissy & D - for the Sakura Taisen figure & DS game case
Noelle - for the Kuta-Kuta Heen plush
Sandy - for an actual <i>YURI</i> RO doujinshi
Gabe <i>AND</i> Jake - for the Wreck-Gar toy (offensively posed AMV Hell 3 style, LOL)
Tarra & Theo - for the Tessa Testarossa figure w/ boobs & buttcheeks
Pam - for just everything you've done and put up with over the last few months ^^
and of course...
Jenna - for flying all the way the fuck here to visit us! LOL!!

It was definitely a memorable day and I was thrilled to spend it with everyone!

p.s. uhhh Sandy, I checked the lyrics to the song I'm playing...and uh...it's ""...smell like stool"". We're saying it wrong...but our wrongness is way fucking funnier! ROFL!!"

"event","Okay, so this just premiered on Anime Network. For those who don't know, Anime Network is one of the banes of my existance as I <i>hate</i> most dubbed anime, but I saw this for sale at Suncoast, but didn't buy it. I was, though, interested in what it was. Since it premiered on here, I thought I'd see what it was about. I didn't expect much as I never expect great things from stuff picked up by Funimation, but lately, the company has been surprisingly better. So, I watched it and it's actually really funny! I think the dubbing, in fact, makes it funnier, but who knows, I might like the original Japanese dialogue. It kind of reminds me of a cross between Golden Boy and Trigun: guns and boobs in the desert! LAWL~

I'm not a hardcore DBZ fan, but I have watched it and I recognized the dubbed voice of Trunks as the title character. He's pretty funny in this role though. Why? Calling another character these two words: ""Tits McGee"" among many other boob-related names...ROFL!!!! Which is hilarious considering I and some people I know like to make up names for jugs. I don't think that would be as funny in the sub! So, I'm gonna watch what's available on here and see if it gets even better."

Yep, I've made my list, looked for all my stuff, got the new camcorder battery, dug up the luggage, and pretty much finished all my costumes! Huzzah! Actually, I still have to get that room. I know, it's cutting close, but Ted supposedly went to put the money in his account today, so we'll reserve it in the morning.

As far as costumes go, I finished my Naruto pajamas, finished all my improvements to my Kankurou costume (aside from restyling ""karasu's"" hair), and all I have left to do is attach one more part to my Gatts arm and I'll be FINISHED! Now I'm officially excited for the convention. Something cool about my Kankurou costume is it fits much better now! I can move way better in it than I could back in August. Seeing some results really makes you feel better about yourself! Yay, me!

I think I know what days I'm going to wear costumes. Gatts on Friday, Kankurou on Saturday cause I'd kind of like to go to the Naruto group photoshoot that afternoon (provided they ever actually officially schedule it), and Naruto PJs on Sunday. I might even wear the PJ's on Friday and Saturday night since I won't want to wear my complex costumes ALL day long.

Wow, we all get to meet Tess on Thursday. I remember her telling us like in October or November that she was going to come here and now she'll be here in like 6 days. Man...time freakin flies by, nowadays!

Since my RO account is expired, I caught up on Naruto scanslations. So, that puts me up to date on Naruto and Bleach...anime AND manga. TOO much free time."

"event","Those on my LJ that are rooming with me at Sakura-con:
Ted, Pam, Sandy, Chrissy, D, and Tess...wow almost all of them. Francis is joining us to fill in that 8th spot to keep our rates low and as they originally were. So, we're set for that as far as people and reservations go. It's going to be about $80 per person for us all to stay Thursday night through Sunday. Check in time is 3pm and check out time is 12 noon, Sunday.

I wanted to let you know, though, that it would be helpful if you were able to give Ted your share of the hotel fee on that Thursday so he can find a bank and deposit it into his account <i>before</i> the convention instead of having to go and find a chain of his bank in the area during the con. That and we can't deposit the <i>full</i> needed amount on a Sunday obviously as the bank would be closed. So, yeah, depositing it on Thursday night and having it ready would be extremely helpful and convenient.

Also, as we have so many people in the room when only 2 people are actually reserved, there are only 2 keys. I know it's an inconvenience, but the problem is, the rate of the room goes up per person. So basically, for 4 keys instead of 2, it'd be an additional $150 to split up. I thought I would try asking for a replacement key on Friday night, saying I misplaced mine. If there is a minor fee for it, no biggie. $5 or whatever is better than $150. So, please bear with me. We all have cell phones and mostly all of us will be spending most of, if not the entire, convention around each other, so it shouldn't be too bad.

Once more, as we have so many people, I do not want any housekeeping in the room. So, we'd like our ""do not disturb"" sign up all weekend. We'll request a few towels now and then, but we strongly suggest bringing one or two towels of your own from home to hang up and reuse and your regular toiletries as needed. Asking for 8 or more towels a day might be a little suspicious.

I don't know exactly how spacious the double rooms at this hotel are, so, if absolutely possible, try to cram as much as you need into as little luggage as you can. I've never been in a room with this many people for this long, so 8 people and they're luggage for this amount of time might be extremely cramped. I know I'll have 2 bags and my 2 big props that I can stow somewhere out of the way. I'm not trying to be picky, I just want this cramped situation to be as comfortable as possible for everyone.

Oh, and pleeeeease don't think I'm being a control freak, but being this isn't a convention-backed hotel, the hotel staff may not be as lenient about room stuffing and may just charge us for the extra people if they find out. So, we'll really need to try and keep it down at night. I'm sure during the day it'll just seem like we have a lot of visitors or something.

I'm just trying to think of the things we can do to keep this as comfortable and inexpensive as possible. So, if you guys have any suggestions or anything, let me know, okay? Just 29 days left, yo!

I have pre-convention stress!! Oh no! I got quite a few things left to do before the con...which is in 30 days. I can't believe it. Time creeps up faster these days. I think as far as hotel fee goes, mine is covered once my tax return gets here, but since I'm not entirely sure how much it's going to be, I don't know how much will be left. All I know is I gotta get my car fixed! Kinda need transportation up there. That and I actually have a small list I made of stuff I wanna look for at the con...

*a few select RO, Bleach, and Naruto doujin...provided I can find 'em.
*Gashapon! Lots of em!
*the new Bleach plushes
*...and I guess whatever impulsed I come across. Usually never a lot.

Dunno. Guess I'll see how it goes. LOL! It's the first time I've actually had something to look for. Usually it's just impulse buys. So yeah.

Now, aside from con stuff...

Holy freakin' crap. The light...it's so bright! I spent the last 2 nights watching all the available episodes of Bleach. There's actually like...7 more I can get, I just haven't finished downloading them yet. So, I watched 21-63 over the weekend. I haven't had a marathon like that in awhile. The last one was a Naruto marathon shortly after Fanime.

I actually have a ton of characters I love in this show as opposed to Naruto, where I had a lot, but not nearly as much. I mean, I can't really think of too many I disliked...except for some of the OBVIOUS Shinigami. No spoilers for you non watchers, though. I do really need to stab Ichimaru, though...lots. His face among other things make me homicidal. I mostly like the female characters, but I have to admit, Renji is the shit! LOL! Oh, and now that I've actually seen Kenpachi and Yachiru, I think BBC and Noelle could cosplay them, great! LOL! Speaking of, I think I found someone from Bleach that I'd like to cosplay as, too. Hitsugaya Toushiro! He short and spiky haired! Hahaha! Not sure if I'll actually make him, though. Might be one of those ""when I look better I'll do it"" costumes. Anyway, I guess he isn't as mainstream, but I thought he was pretty awesome. How I'd do his hair right, is beyond me, but I can try to improvise. I'd do Renji...but I'd never do him justice. Maybe someday. I wish I was taller!

"event","Holy freakin' crap...I hate winter! This weather has been totally retarded. The temps dropped to like 23 degrees with an 18 degree wind chill...and the damn wind is relentless. It's been blowing since around 11pm last night. LOUDLY I might add. As some know, I hate wind because of the trees behind my house. It always gives me a uneasy feeling. Probably because the media has been scaring falling trees into my head since I was really young. So...I'm just annoyed with the weather.

<a href=http://www.geocities.com/underpants_ninja/wintersucks.html>....winter sucks....</a>

So yeah...I hate winter even more...um...today.

Among other stupid things...my car still doesn't work. My heater hose nozzle snapped when we were trying to tighten the hose clamp. Apparently, those nozzles used to be made of copper...not plastic...so an inexpensive, yet difficult, repair job has become a $250 repair job. It's actually cheaper than most were gonna charge though since we know the guy who's gonna fix it. Still sucks though. The worst part is, the money I was hoping to keep and buy a new camcorder with is gonna have to go to fixing my car instead. Of all times it had to do this to me, it had to be now. Something usually always goes wrong financially when I'm planning to do something else with the money. So, my only hope now is I can find someplace that has a replacement battery for my old camcorder cause since one broke, I'm down to one and they don't last a really long time. Since I have to make a con tape next month, it's important I find one or the means of affording a new camera.

Bah, I'm gonna stop staring at and listening to the wind before I go crazy. Back to watching Bleach...until the power probably goes out. *shakes fist* Curse you, winter!! Curse youuuuuu!

"event","So, the weekend was nuts, but I figured it would be. Turned out better than I expected, though. Yes, yes it did.

Spent Friday night at Pam's place. D and Chrissy were down visiting. So, I wandered over and then we went Walgreen's. Got ice cream and socks! Impulse buy'd! Then, we watched ""My Fellow Americans"" cause D had never seen it. I love that movie. Later that night, into Saturday morning, the wind storm rolled in. As I've mentioned, I hate wind. D and I watched some fucked up internet videos and then I headed out. Just the drive home was crazy...all 4 minutes of it. The trees whipping around and all the branches falling down. They don't look that big until they're right next to you. Got home and couldn't sleep. The wind was too loud and unsettling. So, played some DS and eventually drifted off. I made it a point to sleep the day away since the wind was supposed to be gone by 5pm...and it was! Yay! That night, I spent my time playing DS and stuff, watching some TV and then went to sleep, again.

Sunday was nice. The weather was good, for WA anyway, and of course, a neighborhood Super Bowl block party! I went over for a few hours, had some drinks and food, watched the game up until half time and went home. The game just pissed me off, too much. Any STEAL-ers fan would say ""oh you're just bitter cause the Seahawks lost"", but that isn't it. I'm not much of a football fan at all, but hey, it was Seattle, so I stuck around. Watching the Hawks get ripped off by the refs just irritated me, so I stopped watching the game. If their 2 touchdowns that were ""flagged"" hadn't been taken away, they would have won. So, the Steelers stole the game from them. Typical sports. The favored team gets their victory no matter how ill-won it was.

The bad shit, aside from the game, was my dad got pretty tanked at the party and wound up falling down and splitting his head open. Fortunately, it wasn't bad enough to take him to the hospital or anything. My step-sister was freaking out and bawling like he was critical or something! I'm like, shit, would you chill out. He's conscious and talking so stop making a scene! Besides, it isn't like she was over there to be with the family or anything. She was just there to flirt with our neighbor's son who was in town. If he hadn't been there, I'm sure she would have been at our next-door neighbor's house (her in-laws) to watch the game. God knows she would never come over unless she benefited from something. She's still married, too! God, she's so transparent! She was so busy flirting that she expected me to look after her kids. Uh, look, in case you've ignored me for the past 7 years, I hate your kids! So, I just let do what they wanted up until I left. If they fucked up, it ain't my problem. She should know better than to entrust her kids on me. They're little shits and I'll be goddamened if I'm gonna babysit while you whore around. Then, she flips out because she finds out another neighbor we don't associate with has a sex crime on record. She goes running outside to ""check"" on her kids and then comes back in...WITHOUT them. She's like, ""oh, they're fine"". If you were so fucking concerned, then why'd you leave them outside? With her mode of thinking, I bet she hoped something would happen to them so she could sue and get money off it. She's a money-grubbing, gold-digging bitch when it comes right down to it. I didn't know about the guy's offense, but it's like, you don't know the whole story. It could have been DECADES ago. I mean, the dude is old. Yeah, old people are just as capable of doing such crimes, but it's like, don't make a scene if you don't know the whole story. Don't expose him if it was something so old it's not an issue anymore. I hate sex offenders, but it's like, I didn't know about him, he's been in that house for years, and nothing has happened...and there's shitloads of kids on this block, too. It doesn't hurt to be aware, but don't make a scene. She's infamous for that.

After the game ended and I made sure my dad was well taken care of, Gabe messaged  me, so me and Pam randomly wound up driving to his place to hang out awhile. It was kinda late, but oh well. We invited Sandy over, too. Just hung out, skimmed through the good stuff on the Anime Evolution video since Jake didn't get to see it, then went to Shari's. We had that really chipper waiter that's always there when I go. Dude's funny. Hung out there, loudly I might add, for a few hours and then went back to Gabe's. He showed us his Christmas present...a copy of <a href=""http://fuckthiswebsite.com/"">FUCK this Book</a>. We had a great laugh. We want to get the stickers and do some of what the book entails. We won't send them in though cause why should they bank on something me and Gabe should have thought of first! LOL! We'll just take pics for our own amusement. After that, Sandy went home, and we watched some Mystery Science Theater 3000 shorts. Man, I forgot how much I love that show! It's been so long since I've watched it! I'm gonna have to get some of those DVDs when I get some moneys. Relive the good TV years, ya know.

Well...here's another day. It's almost 6pm and there's still some daylight left! The longer days are almost here. Finally! Less than 2 months until Sakura-con, too. Man, I need to get my shit in gear. I got a lot left to do. Costume revamps and some things left to buy. Gotta get some more money for expenses and a few other things. No worries though, I think I should be okay.

Well...off to play more DS. I can't wait to get back to RO, though. 'kay, bye.

<b><i>Gregoire signs gay civil rights bill</b>

02:23 PM PST on Tuesday, January 31, 2006

Associated Press

OLYMPIA, Wash. - Gov. Chris Gregoire signed a gay civil rights bill into law Tuesday, though the law may be held in limbo if opponents are successful in forcing a public vote this fall.

Nearly 200 people gave Gregoire, and bill sponsor Rep. Ed Murray, D-Seattle, a standing ovation, as Murray waved the pen that signed the measure that adds ""sexual orientation"" to a state law that bans discrimination in housing, employment, insurance and credit.

""It's a joyful, emotional moment,"" said Murray, one of four openly gay lawmakers in the Legislature. ""It's a moment to celebrate after a very long struggle.""

After approval in the House, the measure passed the Senate on Friday on a 25-23 vote, a major victory for gay rights activists who have watched the measure fail in the Legislature for nearly 30 years.

Sen. Bill Finkbeiner, R-Kirkland, was the sole Senate Republican to back the measure, a year after it lost by just one vote in the Senate. Two Senate Democrats voted against the measure. One Republican was not present.

AP

After she signed the bill, Gregoire hugged Murray, and the three other Democratic gay lawmakers: Reps. Joe McDermott of Seattle, Jim Moeller of Vancouver, and Dave Upthegrove of Des Moines.

Gregoire thanked Murray and the other lawmakers involved in the bill, as well as previous supporters of the measure, including the original sponsor in 1977, former Sen. Pete Francis of Seattle, who attended the bill signing ceremony.

""It was their first steps, those courageous steps, that brought us where we are today,"" Gregoire said.

The amendment to current law makes Washington the 17th state passing such laws covering gays and lesbians, and the seventh to protect transgender people.

Republicans amended the bill on the House floor to say that it would not modify or change state marriage laws.

The state Supreme Court heard arguments on a case challenging Washington's ban on gay marriage last year, and a ruling is expected in the coming weeks.

A Senate amendment last week also added a caveat saying the state doesn't endorse ""any specific belief, practice, behavior, or orientation.""

The law will take effect in June, 90 days after the end of the Legislature's session. But if initiative promoter Tim Eyman is able to get enough signatures by the June 7 deadline for a referendum, the law will be frozen until a November vote on whether it should be overturned.

In addition, Eyman is pushing an initiative that would also remove ""sexual orientation"" from the law, and prohibit state government from requiring quotas or other preferential treatment for any person or group ""based on sexual orientation or sexual preference.""

A referendum refers a law passed by the Legislature to a vote of the people. Initiatives are generally used to propose new laws, but have also been used in recent years to overturn the Legislature's actions.</i>


After nearly 30 years, a bill passes that will help take a large step toward equality. Christine Gregoire signed the bill that was voted by lawmakers and passed...so why the fuck does it get challenged now??

Tim Eyman is a piece of shit. Just when you think he's done fucking with society and out of the picture, he goes and surprises us again. What the fuck is wrong with this bill? All it's doing is protecting sexual minorities and allowing them to live just like everyone else. What's wrong with wanting to be treated equally? Who in their right mind would oppose this bill? Everyone is entitled to live without discrimination, so why should it be any different for the GLBT community?? We're people, too, and have the right to be treated as such!

Eyman pushes all these ludicrous initiatives one after another, thinking he's some kind of mainstream icon. It's like he goes to bed every night and tries to think of some new thing he can get attention over. Something as big and controversial as equality for GLBT people is obviously going to make headlines...so he's going to fuck with it and make another unnecessary initiative. How's about I go and get 500,000 signatures in support of an initiative that prevents Tim Eyman from making more useless initiatives!? For fuck's sake, Eyman, just let us live! We've waited this long for even an ounce of equality and you got to meddle with it! If it bothered you so fucking much, why didn't you show any opposition BEFORE the bill was passed!? That's right, because it wasn't even on your mind then! Now that something so controversial is supported, you have to get a self-righteous hair up your ass and fuck with it!

WHO IS IT HURTING!? We're all fucking human! Just because we love differently, we should become third-class citizens!? They'll try and tell you it's God's will. What happened to the separation between church and state!? All these political assholes who push their religious beliefs to ""protect God's will"" and ban equality obviously have nothing better to do. Just what is ""marriage protection""? Do you think that if you let GLBT people marry, all the straight marriages will be ruined or something?? How do you figure? I would love to hear someone explain that to me. Really, I would, because I honestly don't understand who the fuck it's going to hurt. Just because some douche bag politician says it's wrong then it must be true? I don't think so. That's the politician's belief and he's abusing his power to enforce hatred (not-my-President Bush, I'm looking at you).

Tim Eyman can take his initiative and shove it up his ass. He could start an initiative that makes car tabs FREE and I won't vote for it because I refuse to support such a bigot in any fashion, whether is benefits me or not. I'll sooner pay more money than vote for anything he wants balloted.

This anti-discrimination bill has already passed and had been signed into effect. As of June, Washington state will protect the equal rights of GLBT people. Keep up the fight for equality, people!

Tim Eyman...you can fuck off and die.

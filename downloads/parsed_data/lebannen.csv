This place is, for me, mainly about the porn and chocolate.  It contains links, references, etc to material which some people may find offensive, or at least surprising.  If you're under eighteen, please don't look too closely, as there is bound to be something you shouldn't get caught looking at - but then, this is Livejournal, what did you expect?

If you are someone who knows me elsewhere, under this name or avatar, or if you think you know me in person, it would be great if you'd leave a note to say hi - anonymous comments are possible if you don't have a livejournal or don't want me to know your LJ name, and all comments will be screened so that no-one else can see them.</font>"

"event","If you don't read <lj user=""news""> or <lj user=""lj_biz"">, this probably won't make much sense. So go and read <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/lj_biz/243697.html"">this lj_biz post</a>. Or if you don't want to read it all, the short verion is that LJ has created a new security feature thing to filter material which is potentially NSFW / not appropriate for the kiddies. This may affect the way you can see or access posts on LJ, including the way some posts show up on your flist.

Part of the lj_biz post says (emphasis mine):<blockquote>How Will This Affect My Search Results?

There are three Safe Search filtering options, which are as follows:

Use Moderate Filtering <b>(default setting)</b>: Filters only explicit adult content.
Use Strict Filtering: Filters both adult concepts and explicit adult content.
Do Not Filter Results: All search results will display, including those marked as explicit adult content and adult concepts.

You can change your search settings on the <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/manage/settings/"">Settings page</a>.</blockquote> Don't know about you, but I take exception to people making new defaults that limit the information I receive. So I went off to the Settings page to change it. And when I got there, I found <b>a whole new feature not mentioned at all in the lj-biz post</b>. It looks a little something like this: <blockquote><b>Viewing Adult Content</b>	Collapse adult-oriented material written by other users: [Dropdown menu offers the following options: Do not collapse / Collapse explicit adult content only / Collapse adult concepts and explicit adult content]</blockquote> If you do not have an appropriate birthdate on file in your <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/manage/profile/"">Profile</a>, this will be set to the most restrictive option, with the other two greyed out. Fixing this allowed me to see a post on my flist without the auto-generated 'adult concepts' cut-tag; I don't know what the default setting is for people with a birthdate on file.

I can see how this might be a handy feature to have, in that it auto-cuts potentially NSFW posts for those who read their flists in public / at work, but I'm not impressed with the way it's been implemented by default."

So, here we have an oil refinery, a couple of tankers, a little local ferry and a couple of yachts. Note also the flames coming out of a chimney, and hint of black smoke.

<lj-cut text=""My journal is called...""> 1. My username is <lj user=""lebannen"">, because I like the name. This is despite the fact that the original Lebannen is a fictional character who is male, and I am not. (well, not male anyway. I sometimes doubt my own relationship with reality, but not terribly seriously). Some people may believe that the name has some sekrit connection with my real name, and are welcome to continue doing so if they so desire. The surname 'Luitreath' was completely made up (using James Lovelock's method of getting a name for his company; take something obscure, and mis-spell it), and never used to get any hits on google. Now it gets two, and oh look, they're both me. This has possibly scuppered my chances of ever calling a company 'Luitreath Ltd' and not having any connection with my lj-identity. I can live with this.

2. My journal is titled 'Stuff and nonsense', because some of it is stuff and some of it is nonsense. Some of it is also nonsensical stuff; you could draw a Venn diagram of it if you were bored enough.

3. The journal's subtitle is, uh, [goes off to c&p it] '(but probably more of the latter)', which should be pretty self-explanatory in the context of the title.

4. My friends page is called 'Romance and knitting', which is a Good Omens reference that seemed amusing at the time. I don't change these things very often, and have yet to think of a better title anyway.

5. My default userpic is my new hat what I made in needlepoint. I think I already explained about it. It is also as close as I'm getting to something seasonal this year, being all colourful and whatnot.</lj-cut>

... and if it's so simple how come this is the <strike>second</strike> <i>third</i> edit? Oh yes, that'd be because I clearly can't <i>type</i> today. Le sigh. *headdesk*"

This is my latest and most ridiculously complicated needlepoint project (the pictures link to larger images). It's also a hat which is currently, annoyingly, just a bit too big. Unfortuntely I don't think my head's ever going to get big enough for it to fit comfortably, so either I will have to find some amazing way of adapting it, or never wear it. Or possibly both.
</lj-cut>

Sort-of (but not really) relatedly, someone is trying to sell cross-stitch patterns of SGA characters on eBay. 170*230 stitches, which works out at over a foot tall. In <i>cross-stitch</i>. Which is mostly background (or don't you do background in cross-stitch? I don't know). That's - oh god, I just checked - that's a <i>lifesize picture of Sheppard</i>. At 14 dpi. <a href=""http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/JOE-FLANIGAN-CROSS-STITCH-PATTERN-STARGATE-ATLANTIS_W0QQitemZ8236936390QQcategoryZ3092QQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem"">and somebody has bid on it</a>.

More SGA - how did I not notice that Caldwell is the former AD Skinner? I'd read fic predisposing me not to like him before I ever saw the show, and then on sight suddenly found it impossible to hate him <i>but without recognising him</i>.

So given that I know about them, yes, I should have been sufficiently warned. But none of them were so graphic - and none of them had a little historical note at the end of the book saying <i>oh yes, that bit was real. probably.</i> I'm not sure whether that made it worse or not, actually.

It's not quite what I thought it was going to be, but it's close enough.  I also have another picture that was nearly an icon, but decided not to be; it should be over there on the right, but I don't always get my code quite right so it may screw up your page or just plain not show up or something.

I also have new wallpaper; it looks like something that might be used as a background on a PotC site or something, ripples and sand and sunshine on sea.

"event","Never volunteer for anything while in a pub.  I should have learnt this by now; maybe writing it down will somehow fix it into my mind, but I doubt it.  On Friday night, I agreed to join Little Brother's rowing crew for practice on Sunday morning, since one of them was going to be away.

At two o'clock this (Sunday) morning, after having sat up reading pirate smut, I remembered this.  At nine o'clock I was out in the rain getting the boat ready.  The things we do for our families, eh.

So as a recognition of this outstanding piece of selflessness, I present pictures of boats, taken in April and May of this year: 
<div align=""center""><lj-cut text=""lots of little boats"">
<img src=http://www.littlefish.charitydays.co.uk/Lebannen/gigs/shah-apr04.jpg>
This is the boat we were rowing, crewed here by a variation on a theme of the men's A crew - it was at the start of the racing season, and they didn't have a settled crew then. The crew I went out with this morning was techincally the men's B crew, but ended up so motley as to be more of a farce.  In the rain.  I now have muscles aching that I had almost forgotten existed.
<img src=http://www.littlefish.charitydays.co.uk/Lebannen/gigs/shah-stern-on.jpg>
Same evening.  These were taken while waiting for the start of a race, but the light was going and all the rest of the pictures I took that day were somewhat rubbish. So here are some from another race:
<img src=http://www.littlefish.charitydays.co.uk/Lebannen/gigs/near-start.jpg>
This is not in any way the normal appearance of a racing start line!  The Pilot Gig Racing World Championships are held here every May, and the first race of the championships is one great long free-for-all, with ninety boats on the line.  A normal race has more like ten gigs taking part.
<img src=http://www.littlefish.charitydays.co.uk/Lebannen/gigs/moreboatsthansea.jpg>
From that first big race, quite near the start.
<img src=http://www.littlefish.charitydays.co.uk/Lebannen/gigs/stern-on.jpg>
And again, but just coming up to the finish line.
<img src=http://www.littlefish.charitydays.co.uk/Lebannen/gigs/manyonbeach.jpg>
And afterwards, all pulled up in front of the most horrible bit of seafront we have here.
</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""and one big sailboat, (a brig, in fact)"">
<img src=http://www.littlefish.charitydays.co.uk/Lebannen/june-web/SS-Prince-William.jpg>
This one's the SS Prince William, which belongs to the <a href=""http://www.tallships.org"">Tall Ships Youth Trust</a>, and is very cool despite the name.  It just happened to be passing, one day. It's now somewhere between Ipswich and Antwerp, and spending the rest of the summer in the North Sea, the Channel and the Irish Sea.  So it'll probably be back sooner or later.

"event","What with having just reinstalled my OS and started again with all my preferences completely blank, I decided that maybe I needed some new wallpaper.  A fair number of the photos I've taken lately looked quite suited to the task, so I set about scanning and rearranging them.  Then I thought, well, maybe I'll share them with the world as well - aren't I lovely?  They're by no means all that interesting, just snippets and scrappets of (mostly) low-contrast landscapes, but behind the cut you'll find a handful of little photos (and I may have made the small ones a bit <i>too</i> small to really see properly, sorry), some of which are links to 1024*768 wallpapers.  If all goes according to plan, the ones that are links will have borders, and the rest won't.

<lj-cut text=""So, on with the pictures"">
<div align=""center"">
<img src=""http://www.littlefish.charitydays.co.uk/Lebannen/june-web/hightidehouse.jpg"" height =""206"" width=""300"" border=""0"" alt=""[Gugh at high tide]"" vspace=""10"">
If you look at my icon, you can see that it's a map of two islands close together.  At low tide you can walk across a sandbar between them, but for a few hours at high tide they're cut off from each other. Standing looking across at the smaller one on a sunny evening, the view can look a little like this.
<a href=""http://www.littlefish.charitydays.co.uk/Lebannen/june-web/bluewater.jpg""><img src=""http://www.littlefish.charitydays.co.uk/Lebannen/june-web/bluewater-s.jpg"" height =""225"" width=""300"" border=""2"" alt=""[tide over the Bar]"" vspace=""10""></a>
Same place, same evening, it's a closeup of the tide flowing over the sandbar.
<img src=""http://www.littlefish.charitydays.co.uk/Lebannen/june-web/Carn-Agnes.jpg"" height =""205"" width=""300"" border=""0"" alt=""[Rocks and Sea]"" vspace=""10"">
A different bit of coastline on a different kind of day, I'm not sure when in the winter it was, but maybe January.  
<a href=""http://www.littlefish.charitydays.co.uk/Lebannen/june-web/whitewater.jpg""><img src=""http://www.littlefish.charitydays.co.uk/Lebannen/june-web/whitewater-s.jpg"" height =""225"" width=""300"" border=""2"" alt=""[Breaking wave]"" vspace=""10""></a>
Once again the same place, the same day, but this time looking down from a little cliff (that's so small as to barely deserve the name) on water somewhat closer.  I think I may have fiddled the contrast a little bit on this one to make it a bit hazier.
<a href=""http://www.littlefish.charitydays.co.uk/Lebannen/june-web/pastelstripes.jpg""><img src=""http://www.littlefish.charitydays.co.uk/Lebannen/june-web/pastelstripes-s.jpg"" height =""225"" width=""300"" border=""2"" alt=""[More rocks and sea]"" vspace=""10""></a>
This bay is just around the corner from the previous, and the photo was taken on a spring evening just after high tide, when the light was doing some very peculiar things.  I think the sun had gone behind a cloud before I took it.
<a href=""http://www.littlefish.charitydays.co.uk/Lebannen/june-web/wintersunset.jpg""><img src=""http://www.littlefish.charitydays.co.uk/Lebannen/june-web/wintersunset-s.jpg"" height =""225"" width=""300"" border=""2"" alt=""[Winter sunset]"" vspace=""10""></a>
A sunset.  In winter.  With the colours slightly fiddled to make it look more like it did in the original.
<a href=""http://www.littlefish.charitydays.co.uk/Lebannen/june-web/ontheedgeofsunday.jpg""><img src=""http://www.littlefish.charitydays.co.uk/Lebannen/june-web/ontheedgeofsunday-s.jpg"" height =""225"" width=""300"" border=""2"" alt=""[Farther West than West]"" vspace=""10""></a>
This picture's called <i>On the edge of Sunday</i>.  I'm not entirely sure why, but it is.  It's also the one I currently have as my wallpaper.  Beyond those rocks (seen on a May evening), depending on exactly which direction you're going, you might be able to head in a straight line to South America without seeing any other land on the way, but the Caribbean might be more likely.  Head too far to the left and you'll find France or Spain, too far to the right and it'll be Canada.

<lj-cut text=""More yesterdayspam in here"">
<img src=""http://www.littlefish.charitydays.co.uk/Lebannen/apr-web/tulips.jpg"">
These are the only flowers we have at the moment, apart from the pink triffids which don't like being photographed.  They're rather nice, but I have no idea what they are called, beyond being tulips of some sort.  (The pink triffids are <i>Geranium anemonifolium</i>, apparently.  But there aren't any pictures of them.)

<img src=""http://www.littlefish.charitydays.co.uk/Lebannen/apr-web/lookingwest.jpg"">
Once again, it's the view out of the window at work.  This is actually the reason I have the digicam at the moment; we're meant to be taking pictures for adverts.  I think that everything we've got so far is crap, and I'm going to have to go in early tomorrow before there are any messy customers about, and try and get something sorted.  My boss took what <i>would</i> have been a lovely, sunny picture yesterday, but didn't seem to notice that all the rubbish had been left just outside the door.  We'll see what we can do...

<img src=""http://www.littlefish.charitydays.co.uk/Lebannen/apr-web/perconger.jpg"">
Eh... a bay, a boat, some more islands over there *waves, vaguely*.  Just like a hundred and one other holiday snapshots.

<img src=""http://www.littlefish.charitydays.co.uk/Lebannen/apr-web/shahonland.jpg"">
So, this is a boat that's been wheeled out of its shed so that someone can escape from his houseguests and sit in the sun painting it.  Which is fair enough.  But he wouldn't let me take a photo of him, so you get the boat and a bit more of the same bay as above.  The strangely rectangular patch of pale yellow in front of the darker yellow gorse in the background, is the remains of a flower field.  The farm has been derelict for twenty-odd years but the bulbs were left in the ground, and the flowers come up every year through the brambles and dead bracken.
</lj-cut>
</div>

If anyone feels like it, they can ask me three questions and I'll provide an answer of sorts."

This is one of the maenads dancing round Dionysos in the middle of the vineyard in the Warm Temperate Biome.  They're very cool, and some are scarier than others.

Quoting directly from the blurb, ""the Humid Tropics Biome, the largest conservatory in the world, is 240 m long, 110 m wide and 50 m high.""  What this means is that it's plenty big enough for full-grown palm trees, and plenty more!

OK, so it's not the most exciting picture ever, but I quite like it.  It probably helps that it reminds me of a day at a different end of the earth than the one where I'm currently resident - that one had cliffs, caves and many treeferns.  It also had a large sealion, some penguins and a lot of rugby fans.  Quite a lot of things to get into one day, but it was a while ago...</lj-cut> The picture of tree ferns is dedicated to <lj user=""mirabile_dictu"">, for making me cry in a good way, and specifically for <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/mirabile_dictu/7785.html#cutid1"">The End of the World</a>, which has rather larger tree ferns of its own.  does that make any sort of sense?  probably not, but there you go."

"event","I said to someone the other day that there should be more photospam in the world, and I've been enjoying <lj user=""heathcee"">'s occasional piccies of Scotland, so I thought I'd inflict some of my own photos on y'all.  They're all from the cafe I worked at over the summer; here's part of the view out of the window -

This one's part of the view further round to the left, taken on a foggy day cos that's the only way to get the contrast of the one rock against the carns in the background -

Optimistic and caring, you tend to see the best in people.
You tend to be always smiling - and making others smile.

You are shy and intelligent... and a very hard worker.

Your subtle dry humor leaves your close friends in stitches.</font></td></tr></table>

I worry about my friends and fellow teenagers and I don't want to sound snobbish or above anyone but some of the things I hear about and read and know about makes me worry more. I wish there was more that I could do for everyone including my closest friends but I guess due to my nonsocialness or the misconception that I will judge leads everyone to not consider me for help or comfort.

"event","Your dominant element is earth. Even if you sometimes pretend otherwise, do you kind of like hanging out with your folks or siblings? The ancient Yin-Yang scholars saw earth types as pretty family-oriented. Also, they are generally trusted by their friends and, being very reliable and responsible, rarely disappoint them. Earth people like to invite friends over for low-key activities like watching movies or just to hang out. 
Do you have a fairly stable temper? It's not easy getting Earth types worked up. 

Even if you grab a handful of earth and throw it up in the air it will always settle back to the ground. The element earth is therefore related to stability. 

Trustworthiness is the dominant feature of the elemental energy of earth. This promotes the loyalty and responsibility in us. 

If it isn't disturbed, earth can be very stationary. The earth element therefore allows us to sit still for a while and not to change our mind too often. 

Things that provide security will encourage the positive qualities of earth. Everything from a sturdy bag to a well-built house can fulfill the need for safety. 

A humid climate is best for earth as it keeps the earth damp and stops it from getting blown away. The colors that correspond to it are yellow and brown. 

Earth types are known for having a sweet tooth. 

NOTE: Earth types look huggable. They tend to have full cheeks and a generous mouth."

in Individuality. Different, amazing, and all your<br>own. You like be set apart
from all others and most love that you do. You are<br>solitary at times, but for
the most part, there is no greater compliment to<br>you than someone telling you
that you are different. You're most likely a bit of<br>a fighter and you hate it
when anyone attempts to change who you are. You<br>wear what you want, look how you
want and don't let anyone tell you what do to. You<br>can be a little immature at
times and have trouble dealing with authority and<br>asking others for help. You
like to do things yourself and are independent<br>almost to a fault. But, people
still find your individuality amazing and the fact<br>that no matter what happens
or what anyone else anyone thinks about it, you<br>will not change who you are.</font></p>

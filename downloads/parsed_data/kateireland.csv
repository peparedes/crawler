"event","Things to do if you are a swim team asshole and are staying at Kate's residence:

Play pranks on your fellow swim team members. This is fun. Prank-pulling may involve:

- putting ketchup in your roommate's shampoo. She will come to the logical conclusion that she is bleeding and run up and down the hall howling unintelligibly. Contrary to what Kate will tell you once she has determined your roommate is not dying, this IS funny. 

- smashing an egg on your roommate's pillow. Your roommate will then carry the pillow down the hall, dripping, to Kate and insist she clean it for you.

And lastly, but certainly no less fun and odorous,

- spilling a can of sardines down the hallway that your friends are staying in. Only make sure that it is a carpeted hallway, otherwise it will not rot in the heat and it will be easy to clean up. 

Grrr..."

"event","Horrible dream that involves dead-ish babies *shudders*

<lj-cut>

So I had this dream that Adam and I were going to have a baby, and we were nervous that our parents would be mad so we didn't tell them. Then I guess I had the babies and it turned out that they were actually quadruplets and they were born really prematurely at 4 months old (repetition of number 4 is very scary).  They were really, really little, doll-sized, and they all fit in this one little sleeper that was made for them. And eventually we sort of just started showing up at family stuff with them and our families realized that we did have babies and they were semi-mad but it turned out to be okay (because who doesn't like babies?). But the scarier thing was that whenever I went near them (which was pretty often as they were very young and I guess needed lots of attention or whatever) they didn't even look like babies. They looked like these wrinkly, with barely-formed human features things. And they didn't move. They were just kind of there, but no one seemed to think there was anything wrong but me.

Why, why did I have this dream? I woke up in the middle of it which was two days ago and I'm still freaked out by it. If we ever do have kids I'll be terrified of them."

"event","Just finshed The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold. It was wonderful. She writes beautifully, and her insights into the many different participants in the tragedy made me wonder how you could have so many people in your head at one time and have them all feel real and worth knowing when it all comes out in print. I feel like I should have felt more than I did though. I've thought this before. I don't know anyone who's died, or had anything bad happen to them. Or had anything bad happen to me. I've often wondered if this means the universe is just waiting to deliver me a big one or am I just lucky? Though it's not necessarily lucky not to have experienced a big part of what makes us human.  But I'm glad all the same that I haven't.

On a different note...

I'm taking the Philosophical Issues of Feminism class starting on Monday. I'm a bit worried. I decided to take it because I've always said I don't beleive in feminism but have never actually thought about what it means, so I figured I'd learn and then form a slightly more educated opinion. I hope I don't offend anyone in the process."

"event","I didn't write in my progress last week because I was really disappointed.  I only lost 0.5 pounds.  Half a pound.  Is that even worth quoting?  I feel like that's just taking a pee before my weigh-in.  Hardly something to write about.

Last night I lost 1.5 pounds.  Much better but still not the 3.5 I wanted to make my body down two stone.  Hopefully I will lost 2 pounds between now and Monday (because I have to switch my meeting to where is close to me) but I am doubting that's possible in a healthy way.  But I NEED to lose these two pounds to make myself feel like I'm actually doing something.  I need to get off those two stone, those 28 pounds so I can BRAG and say, ""You know what?  I'm two stone lighter than I was 2 months ago.""  That's a lot of weight but I just can't seem to get there.  I can't.  And it's driving me mad.

And then there is the Christmas goal of 30 pounds.  It's only 4 away.  Just four but that four might as well be 100 because right now it just seems so far in the distance and not possible.  I am an instant gratification type of person and this half a pound a week crap is just ticking me off.

I don't know what I need, but I know what I don't need.  Four pounds."

"event","Weird things I have noticed lately:

When you are sharing your weight loss with another friend who is also trying to lose weight, resentment will pop up against the person who is doing better.

That person is me.

This week I went to my WW meeting and I lost 5 pounds.  These weekly drops are an incredible achievement and I am sure that it will slow down soon and regulate.  But since I weighed so much to begin with my body doing <i>anything</i> different with itself is going to cause me to lose weight.  When I get down to a size that my frame can handle, it will definitely slow down.  Right now, though, it's not and I have been losing on average four pounds a week.  

And when I get this all people tell me is that it's unhealthy.  That I'm doing WW wrong.  That I shouldn't lose that much weight that quickly.  I do actually agree with some of these statements.  I <i>shouldn't</i> be losing weight that fast (24.5 lbs to date) and it isn't exactly what is considered to be healthy weight lose, but I'm not exactly what would be considered a healthy person, am I?

But I AM doing WW properly.  I am eating all of my points, eating veg and fruit and drinking my water.  I am sticking by the rules and now starving myself.  And you know what?  Just be happy for me.  That's it.  Just say GOOD JOB! because one day you will have a huge break through, or reach a goal and I know that you want me to be happy for you.  And I will.  Because that is what friends do."

"event","Another week or weight watchers comes and goes and this time I lost 3 pounds which I have to say, I find amazing.  I have been feeling bloated all week and even though I was keeping to the points and making sure I didn't over eat, or eat anything naughty, I was convinced that I would have gained weight.  My wedding rings have been hard to get off and on and when i looked in the mirror I saw added bulges that I never thought should have been there.  Yesterday's weigh-in was a good one.

This weekend, however, might not be so good.  We have to move into our new place.  I really psyched about it but at the same time it's really hard to cook a good meal when you are moving and unpacking boxes.  I know my husband won't let me eat anything I shouldn't, but I know I'm going to want easy and convienent rather than something that take time.

On the subject of food, I had planned an eating day for the bank holiday weekend coming up at the end of October.  A friend from London is coming over with her husband and her sister so I figured we would be out and about having lucnhes and coffees so why not make it a whole day where I can eat what I want?  But, I don't think that will do.  Not if I want to reach 30 pounds by Christmas.  That's losing 1 pounds for 9 weeks, and 2 for 1 week.  It's possible, very very possible, but I don't think I have room for ""eating days""."

"event","Another day, and more points counted.

There was a leaving do on today for a woman who has worked here for twenty years.  Good for her.  And isn't it fantastic that she requested a CARROT CAKE?  Only my favourite kind of cake in the world.  Did I eat some?  Did I eat all of it?  No, I'm a good dieter and I politely passed.  *Pats self on back*

My mother knows I am dieting again and is supportive, but seems to be as disappointed as I am when I don't lost more weight in a week.  Seriously, I thought a pound was considered good!  It's rather cheeky of her to tell me what I should be losing every week, no?

Anyway, this weekend we move in with my mother-in-law for a few days until our new apartment is ready.  Stress makes me want to eat pizza.  That and just being alive makes me want to eat pizza.  Must. Hold. Out.

On a different note I made two new icons for this journal because when I get into things I instantly have to open photoshop to create something to symbolise the moment.  I could be doing worse things, I guess.  Like getting drunk and putting babies on spikes."

"event","Hi old friends, it's been AGES and I mean AGES since I have posted anything in here.  And you know what?  Right now I still weigh the same amount.  HOW is that possible, you say.  Because I then, in the past year, GAINED 16 pounds and I have been on weight watchers for the past 4 weeks and have lost that 16 pounds, putting myself back at the same weight I started with last year.

What happened to me?  I was so motivated but just the working out wasn't cutting it.  I would still eat anything I wanted and then bit by bit I stopped going to curves and just ballooned up bigger than I was before.  I cried that first day at weight watchers but I knew it was something I had to do if I ever wanted to have kids.

Yup, that's what it came down to.  I went to the doctor and got all the blood tests done.  He found out my cholesterol and blood sugar was slightly high (but not dangerous) but other than that everything else in my body was producing the proper hormones so there was no reason I shouldn't be menstruating properly.  No reason other than my weight.  So, if a January 2009 date is my deadline.  I would like to be 100lbs less by then.  100 lbs.  That's an insane amount, but I actually think I can do it.

Start: 302
Current: 286
Week: 5
Goal for Christmas: 272

Wish me luck."

"event","I have been bad about going to Curves lately, even though I enjoy it.  I don't know why I can't just MAKE myself go for the three times a week.  This week I am committing myself to Monday, Tursday and Thursday so I don't have to go on Friday and Saturday.  I meant to go on Saturday this week but when it came time to waking up and getting there, I just couldn't do it.  It's only open until 1pm on Saturdays so you have to get up and go if you want to make it there in time. 

I haven't been that great at eating either.  I'm being a crap dieter is what I am being.  Help get me back on track please?  Before my weigh-in on the 13th?

What else has been going on? Work is stressing me.  My boss is just up my arse all the time and so that give me the gitters about going in in the mornings.  I want to be happy in my job, and I'm usually happy, but right now it just worries me.  This is of course attributed to the fact that I have my performance review on Thursday.  Wish me luck."

Unfortunately, I love cocktails.  Today I had two martinis at our department Christmas lunch.  And they were goooood... but oh so badddd....   The hotel we had the drinks in is posh as all get-out though, and I look forward to going there again.  It's a new place in Dublin 4 called <a href=""http://www.dylan.ie/dylan_bar.php"">Dylan</a>.  It's about the most opulent place I have been in in Dublin and it was so worth those 5 billion calories.

But, my stomach wanted none of it.  I had a healthy dinner with E since the husband was at his Christmas-do tonight but since then my stomach has been protesting.  I've seen the toilet tonight more than I have seen the couch and that's pretty impressive since I do love me some couch.

Anyway, I have to pack because we are off on Thursday.  Oh how I dread this.  I hope I find all of my new friends happy, healthy and rapidly losing weight :)"

"event","So today I had my first session at Curves.  It was good.  The girl instructing me was a bit...manly, though which put me off the program a bit.  In the end I asked her if she was ever overweight and she told me she hasn't ever been but she's very healthy so at least I know it's not the program that made her look like that. ;)

I broke a major sweat and since I was so drunk the night before and so hung over at the time I swear you could smell the gin coming off of my skin.  I did straighten myself up enough to do a proper and full workout, though.  I was proud of myself and I felt about 4 billion times better afterwards.  Seriously, my hangover has been minimal all day.  When the new year is here I plan on becoming a full member and start losing the pounds.  I think if I do this properly I can lose weight with it, I just have to get there at least three times a week.  Since it's pitch dark here at 4pm, I know it's going to be a problem.  When the dark comes so does my sleepiness.  I HAVE to work through this.  Help, anyone?

On a non-weight note:  I have been massively emotional lately.  I cry at the drop of a hat.  Tonight I met up with some of the girls and when they called to tell me that that restaurant was a different one to the one I thought it was, I cried in my husband's arms.  What the hell is wrong with me?  I seriously can't fathom this is considered normal behavior.  I hope once I get home and I'm happy it will be okay.  I will work through this emotional period.  Geez, do I need to for my husband's sake alone!

One final thing for the day -- I fell off of one of the machines at Curves and hurt myself.  Yes, you read that right, <i>I fell at Curves</i>.  I was doing the waist machine, took my pulse and then fell right off of the little platform into the window sill.  I twisted my ankle, banged my hip, and permanently damaged my pride.  The instructor was really sweet about it and wanted to make sure I was okay to go on, but all I could do was apologize for the possible impairment of the window.  I'm such a drip, it's scary!"

"event","I can't remember if I posted about this yesterday but I am scared of my mother.  I know this doesn't sound normal, but this has been from a lifetime of trying to compete for my father's attention.  Personally, I never saw it as a competition but it wasn't until college that I realized she means business when it comes to my relationship with my dad, and she will do anything in her power to make me feel badly about myself.  She obviously didn't think this through because on more than on occasion I have cried on my father's shoulder because of her comments.

Anyway, as I have explain ad nauseum in the past few posts, I have gained a bit of weight in the past year.  Probably around 43 pounds.  She hasn't seen me in a year and when we go home over the holidays, I fear her comments.  I also know she bought me clothes, clothes that <i>I picked out</i>, and I'm pretty sure they won't fit now.  She will have something to say about this and it will make me cry.  And I know, beyong a shadow of a doubt, that if I tell her I'm serious about getting on a good workout regime, that I will be eating healthy and getting help in the new year, she will laugh it off and say, ""I'll believe it when I see it.""  That's just my mom.

So, I am making a vow to weigh less than I do now when I see her again in May.  I don't know how much I will have lost by that time.  I would love to say 130lbs (ha!) but obviously that's not reasonable or healthy (or possible?) to do in four months.  I will, however, have lost some weight and I hope it show.  I would like to smack her in the face with it."

I'm not sure what I'm going to have for lunch yet but I'm sure it's not going to be the best of things to eat.  Sensible eating and no <i>real</i> dieting until the new year.  I'm giving myself that.

Tonight I am supposed to go to my mother in laws house but I'm just not in the mood.  Since seeing my weight the other day I have sort of hermitted myself and I don't feel like coming out just yet.  The husband is very supportive and understand that I want to hide a bit, even though he thinks I'm ""beautiful just the way I am"".  Sometime I wonder how he could truly believe that.

I'm also really nervous about flying home, for several reasons:
1.  I don't know if I am going to fit in the seat.
2.  I KNOW my mother will mention the weight gain and humiliate me in front of the husband and my father
3.  I'm getting new clothes for Christmas and I'm scared I won't fit into them.

Anyway, I'm not sure if the food was healthy.  Should I be eating avocado?  How about buckwheat noodles?  It all felt very healthy.  I had California roll and then noodles with chicken and veggies in it.  Healthy?  I don't know.

Now for lunch I had a roll which I know was my first mistake.  Too much bread.  The on it was ham, turkey and cheese.  Why cheese?  Because I love it.  I need to learn how to give it up, though.  I know how bad cheese is.

So far, the diet is going crap, but remember the real diet doesn't start until January."

"event","I can't believe I have let myself go this far.  286 pounds.  That's a feat for a 25 year old woman.  

I have been heavy my whole life but nothing like this.  Over the years as a teenager I probably could have used to lose 10 pounds but I never thought much of it.  I was always very conscious of my weight, and hated my body, but I didn't hate it enough to do something about it.  I could have starved myself, or gone on fad diets like the other girls but I was getting along just fine the way I was so I couldn't be bothered.

And now, 10 years after stepingon a scale and seeing the dreadful (dreadful for the age of 15) number 150.  I cried that day but I am crying harder today.  I weigh 136 pounds more than that.  I could lose a whole, healthy person and still not be a skinny minny.  It's unfathomable.

I went to the doctor today because I have been having problems with my menstruation cycle.  It hadn't been coming on time since I had moved in with my husband.  Many times I thought I was pregnant only to see it show up two weeks late.  I have gotten used to it by now and I buy pregnancy tests only when pushed to do so by my anxious husband.  They are always negative.

So, I went to the doctor to find out he didn't have any intention of helping me.  He told me he wouldn't refer me to a OBGYN until I am having less than 5 periods a year.  Now, this doesn't exactly sound pro-active to me but he's the doctor.  He said my irregular periods could have something to do with stress, life or even...my weight.

He paused at weight.  I could tell he didn't want to say it out loud for fear I would sit on him.  I knew I was massively overweight, I just didn't know by how much.  So he handed me this panphlet entitled, ""Are you Ready to Lose Weight"".  I put it in my purse, and hoped never to see it again.  he then took my blood pressure (""It's a little high... nothing to worry about though""... which is weird since I have never had high blood pressure) and then I got on the scale.  130kg.  <b>130kg</b>  Holy shit.  That's a lot of weight.

And here I am, starting a livejournal with the hopes that I can lose the weight in the coming year.  Since the holidays are upon us I am going to wait until the new year to get started.  I can't imagine starting a diet over Christmas.  What hell!  So...January 8th, when I'm back from hoidays, I officially start but I will be cutting down the calories immediately.

I'm worried, a bit stressed and anxious, but hopeful. My goal is 150.  I want to weigh what I did when I was 15 because I truly believe my teenage years should not be my best years."

"event","So now Hermione is leaving too. I guess I should have seen it coming. Even if there weren't a new war looming, she would have wanted to move on and to do things. I still don't understand why she didn't tell me about Ron earlier, but with her announcement that she'll be joining the DA, it wasn't something to be asked.  I'm still surprised that she chose the DA. I guess I'd always seen her working for the Ministry and making great changes - especially now that the Ministry seems to be run more competently these days.  I'm sure Neville is running a tight operation - it's amazing how he's changed and grown from our days at school, but I guess we all have - but it's too localised and the purpose is too specific.

If the Death Eaters are out there, there has to be people doing reconnaisance on them. There has to be people going out and gathering information or coming up with counterstrikes against anything they might have planned or doing more research to defend against the Unforgivables. There needs to be more researchers and more Aurors. <s>Even I</s>

At least Sirius is coming to stay.  I can't imagine how he must feel about being back, having lost three years of his life like that. In some ways, it must be even worst than Azkaban. At least he was...<i>somewhere</i> while the world went on.

I don't even know how I feel about it yet. I should be happy, but at the moment I'm mostly nervous - nervous that he'd turn out to be an imposter, or nervous that he'd be taken away again. With another war coming, who knows when I'll lose him again?  Who knows who else I'll lose?  Who knows who else I'll kill?

But there's time to talk, I guess.  He, at least, knows what it's like to return to a world that has no place for you anymore."

"event","In 1940, London was bombed for 76 consecutive nights as part of the Battle of Britain campaign conducted by the German airforce.  Most of the east end was devastated, but among the ruins of the buildings surrounding it, St Paul's Cathedral remained standing.

Hermione and I took some time to walk around London and visited the cathedral. Watching the tourists admire this stony survivor of the Second World War, I couldn't help but wonder if any of them realised what they'd so recently survived and how close they'd been to enslavement at best and total annihilation at worst. I watched a father pull his young son off the pews and I watched an old couple light a candle under the Virgin Mary, and it struck me how innocently peaceful they looked about what could have happened. About what might happen again.  This was what we gave them, this peace of mind.  Our fight hadn't been in vain.

And it won't be now."

"event","It's one of those rare moments when the pain is bearable and I think I'm going mad.  I've been bedridden for several days straight now: several days in which Dudley has been getting further away; the Death Eaters have been reconvening; and the Order has been organising.  Several days in which the world has gone on without me.

I've been quite happy to let it do just that after the war.  Even if they wanted me to be part of the reconstruction, I didn't.  I'm just so tired, and now I'm wondering just what the war was for.  Why did people fight, why did they give up their lives if all that they gained was some time before the next conflict?  What good was my parents' sacrifice if all they did was delay Voldemort's attack?  What good is any of this if it never ends?

It just never ends."

"event","I once heard someone say that when you surround yourself with your own grief, it's hard to see that anyone else is going through the same thing.  I know that I'm not the only one who suffered from the war. I know that I'm probably one of the luckier ones in what I've managed to keep.  But I've also gone through things that no one else has, that no one else can understand.

I encountered Michael Corner on my last visit to see Ginny, and I could see that he blames himself for her death.  I suppose I ought to feel better because of that - because someone else is sharing my burden of guilt - but I only feel cheapened.  How does simply moving away even compare to holding the wand that killed her?  He wasn't the one she stayed on the battlefield for. He wasn't the one whose life she begged for. He wasn't the one she looked at in shock as the green flames engulfed her.  

Maybe it's because of his love for her. I could see, too, that despite how they'd broken up, he did love her.  And maybe still does. In that, he has a claim over her that I don't.  I liked her, certainly. Respected her greatly. Needed her, even.  She was my anchor when I needed one. She brought me back from the brink so many times I couldn't even begin to count.  But I never loved her, not the way she wanted me to, and not the way everyone else thinks I did. The bards sing their tragic ballads about how Harry Potter lost his One True Love in the war, and it's just another lie to add to the list.  The prophecy and the war took all I had to give, and in the end there was nothing left for her.  For anyone, really. 

<strike>Prof</strike> Remus is right. I have to get out of this house. The memories are bearing down on me and oftentimes I feel like I can't breathe.  But here, I have the privacy I need. Ron and Remus are gone, and Hermione and Malfoy keep to themselves. Here, I don't have to be what's expected of me.  Here, I can pretend that the tremors aren't getting worse."

"event","No, I <i>do</i> know what to say; I just don't know how to say it.

Neville Longbottom sent me a letter the other day to let me know he'd been named head of security for Dumbledore's Army.  I suppose I wasn't too surprised about that piece of news - Neville accomplished a hell of a lot during the war, and now he's making something out of his life while I'm running around trying to pull off juvenile pranks that aren't even successful.

What did surprise me was that he asked me to join him, and I was strongly tempted to set fire to his letter after reading that.  As it was, it took me several days to be able to reply to him.  It's not that I find the idea of the army repugnant or useless; on the contrary, I think it would give the citizens of Hogsmeade some peace of mind as long as the security of Azkaban remains in doubt.  But the wounds are too raw and I know that if I join, I'd be expected to take on the part of Hero again.  I'm not a hero, and I don't want to be.  I am where I am by pure chance - it could just as easily have been Neville in my position.  I wouldn't wish it upon anyone, but I can't help but think that Neville would have been able to cope with it better.  

I know that he never asked to be where he is now either; I know that he didn't want to be a part of the war, but when it came down to it he got the job done.  He's still getting the job done, but I can't. I can't go back to the reminders of the war, I can't face it day in and day out. I can't make it my life. And if that makes me a lesser man than Neville...well, that's nothing new."

"event","I can't believe I slept with Parvati Patil. It wasn't planned - I wouldn't even have thought of it at all. But she was there at the pub, and we started talking, and she was so lonely, and...

Maybe we needed to be not so alone, just for a while.  Maybe I was just sick of memories of death and wanted to reach out for some life.  Maybe I was sick of being cold and wanted to share some of her warmth.

Maybe I was just really, really drunk.

And of course, I had to act like a complete fool when I woke up. I don't remember half the things I said, but I remember the look on her face, so obviously I didn't say the right things.  Maybe if Ron and I were still--no, not even then.

I need a drink.

But first, I need to apologise."

"event","I'm already regretting agreeing to let Malfoy stay.  Just the other day, Hermione came up to me in hysterics. She kept saying something about Malfoy and pumping her fist up and down in front of her, but she was laughing too hard for me to make out what she was trying to say.  I don't think I want to know."

"event","Dear Ginny,

I know you can't read this, but I really need to talk to you.  I know I don't have the right.  I'm sorry - I'm so sorry.  They called me a hero today and all I could think of was you. I didn't even want to be up there - it should have been you.  You're the real hero, and I'm just a complete fraud.

Everything's all wrong.  Dumbledore's vision has been realised, but he isn't here to see it.  I'm finally away from the Dursleys and living with my friends, but I can't talk to them anymore.  I can't even look Ron in the eye because of what I've done.  And I'm too much of a coward to tell him what really happened that day.  Things are bad enough as it is; I can't bear to see the awkwardness turn to hate.

Then there are times when I think that even my best friend's (can I call him that anymore?) hatred is better than the lies.  All my life, people's reactions to me have been coloured by someone else's actions.  They call me the Boy Who Lived not because of anything I did, but because of my mother's sacrifice.  They're calling me a hero, but you're the one who saved my life.  Even Snape hates me not because of who I am, but who my father was.  If I tell Ron, at least he'll hate me for something <b>I</b> did.  But will I be able to stand it?

I don't know what to do, Ginny.  I wish you were with me.  I miss you.

Harry."

Damn Snape. What right does he have to come here and criticise my choices? He's no longer my professor; he has no power over me.  He doesn't know what happened on that battlefield; he has no idea what's happened in the last three months.

I shouldn't have come back. I'm not ready for this.  I can't be the ""role model"" the Ministry wants to foster. How can I ask anyone to believe in me if there's nothing to believe in?

In a sense, it makes things easier; there are too many memories, too many ghosts to face without the presence of others.

It makes things more difficult, too.  While it was good to see them again, I know they want answers I'm not ready to give yet.  And after the events of the past three months, I'm not sure if I'll ever be ready."

"event","Well seems every one has jumped on the My-Space wagon, I have one but have realized that i dont really like it.

So things have been going really well.

I have quit my job and am going to school YAY!!

Shannon and I are agreeably happy... almost one year, and still not a divorce statistic!

Yes we do have our arguments but anyone who says that they do not have a tiff once in a while is a liar. That is not possible and it would make things very boring. 

I like living."

"event","Well today has been nothing less than a realistic blow to the head. 

It all began when Shannon woke me up this morning when he got off work as usual. But, this morning it wasnt the typical kisses and loves. This moring he woke me up because he was in pain. For those of you who dont know Shannon works in the coal mines on night shift. Last night he was working on a piece of machinery and it blew up, when it blew up it knocked him off of his feet and into a wall, at the same time the light was so bright that he couldnt even see for about 3 min. Somehow he managed not to get burned except for the hairs on his arms. 

This made me realize how close I came to loosing him. Its one of those harsh realities that hit you like a ton of bricks. To have him wake me up this moring was actually a miracle. As we sat in the emergency room this morning it felt like I was smothering. I couldnt even imagine life without him. Even now tears fall as i think of how empty my life would be. On top of all these emotions I had to sit helplessly by his side as he lay on a hospital cot in agony. I wished a hundred times over that i could have been in his place. I had never had to experience those emotions before and I dont even know how to explain it or even if there is a word to call it. 

At any rate we found out that he fractured his tail bone, something that they cant do any thing about so they gave him some pain pills and sent him on his way. So now my ex-drug addict husband has been legally issued pain killers. Not the best thing in the world, so hopefully this does not make him digress. 


Its true that life can vanish in an instant. Hanging on to every instant is the only way to live."

"event","So far this week has been less than joyful.

Turns out i have a cyst on my lower back, near my butt bone which is what was causeing me  much of my back problems, and it just came to the surface. So Sunday Shannon made me go to the ER, and they had to drain all the goo from the cyst, That was the most pain i have ever been in in my life, even with shots to numb it. And now i have to take antibiotics and pain killers that make me SO WOOSEY! But I had to go to my first visit with my new doctor today to have the packing taken out. What a way to make a good first impression! I has hoping that draining it would be all that was needed to be done but Dr. Leslie thinks i will have to have surgery to remove it. Wendsday I have to go to yet another Doctor to have it checked out. I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE SURGERY!!!

Because of all this i am going to miss so much work, now i wish i hadnt joked with cayci about contracting her kidney ecoli..... ERRR. be carefull little mouth what you say. 


Lets hope everything goes well

~much love~

in six monthes and one day i will be a married woman... hmmm... strange.
then what? children? not for a while i think... although shannon wants 4 children!! 4? i think not, 2 maybe....? But first i want to finish school, which mean actually going back to school, how incredibly wastful of me to not go back. 

shannon and i are fixing up a beautiful old home to live in when we get married.. ok who am i kidding its a junky pile of shit trailer that my great grandma used to live in.  I HATE IT!  It is horrid!!! i dont even want to talk about it ne more. death to my old rotten trailer.

I miss my friends i would love one more day at central but one of the good days where you get to skip school or something hahaha.

I think the best feeling in the world is when you are completly and utterly in love. 
 
10 ways to know you are REALLY in love

1 You think about them constanly
2 it takes three minutes and one kiss to stop being mad at them
3 thier farts dont bother you anymore
4 you would rather spend time with them than watch Aqua Teen
5 You only fight about meaningful things like the remote or who loves who more
6 Your best friend likes them
7  one or both of your parents hate them
8 You want to jump there bones when they tell you ""you got a purdy mouth""
9 you hate their car cause they spend time with it
10 thier dog is jealous of you


welp im ottie( well actually im an innie)

Its gonna feel so weird to no wear a uniform to  work, i mean yeah i have to wear the smock but big deal. And no greasy food.. im excited. Cashiering i hope will be good. 

My sister got hit by linsy weddington today in the school parking lot..  shes ok but her driverside door will nolonger open... and all of this mahem was a product of willie freebody having a drivers license.


On another note... can someone please explain to me how someone can tell you that you are ""THE ONE"" after dating for 1 month and some odd days? why do guys always want to move so fast with me... i cant handle this whole falling in love thing again... i know i love him but i hate loving him because sooner or later its goiung to come back to bite me in the ass.. nothing is ever as good as it seems. I guess im just gonna have to hang on to it as long as i can and then just let go im getting used to that... God i ramble lol. one day at i time i guess.

1 I cannot make him want to be with me
2 I cannot make him happy
3 I cannot make him love me

So there is nothing left to do except in Jays words ""pull up my pants and leave"" i wold like nothing more in the world then to make this work but i know his mother was right he is too much like his father.. a sad thing. He will never meet somone else who loves him like I do and treats him like I do.. I however have no fear that somewhere someone will love me. The beginning of the rest of my life. 

to anyone who reads this and knows Jay please do not reveal that our end was premetitated because i dont thing that would be the appropriate thing to do.

in other news cayci and i are venturing to EKU on thurdsday and will be there at about noon, Missylissa is traveling with us and i have informed the rents that I have to go to whitesburg that day because of work... so this operation is very hush hush. Im excited to meet all Caycis friends and have a good time. So ne one in the area who wants to see us drop me a line and we'll arange some kinda somthing or another lol."

"event","I have found that putting to much thought on any certain subject is not a good idea... in-depth thought proves only to complicate an otherwise simple matter. It can cause one to invent things.. such as forming something or someone into a pillar of perfectness where there should be fault, and finding faults where there are none. Have you ever heard the old cliche ""let sleeping dogs lie""? well that has a whole new meaning for me.. Incandescent ramblings of one who has the greatest fear of loss. 

I have found that I am a creature of habit, and I tend to plan things too far ahead.. I suppose that i thought I NEEDED to have everything set straight before it was time.. This i have discovered is one of my many follies... I seem to want things that can never be and despise things I already have.. Just food for thought, though i wish my thoughts were starved instead of overly nourished.


On another note, I have heard nothing of my dear friend sean in the past few days and I am wondering what has become of him... Sean dear if you happen to read the words of this idiot please let me know how you are, its not like you to disappear."

"event","Ok so today rocked!!! 
Jay and I are making real progress... (breaks are not the end of the world... they work) he kissed me after work tonight and Cayci make fun of me because i was so happy about getting a kiss from someone I was engaged to and has given me the worlds greatest *bleep* (censored to protect those with virgin eyes, and of course my dear sister who would rather not read about my escapades in *bleep*) But i was so excited and It was wonderful to feel his lips against mine again and hear those three beautiful words.... ok im getting all mushy and noone wants to hear that.

Well for christmas my cayci gave me a hamster that i didnt want after it bit me but i kept and now i love her... lisa bought scabbers a hamster ball today (it would be ridiculous to get her a guinea pig ball) That was sweet of my dear sister..

And i must apologies to Lisa for being a *bleep* to her for the past few days... i sorry sister i was irritated... the whole thought of loosing my love made me disgruntled and you unfortunately walked into my path and were hit with me *bleep* rays... sorry.

Going to the boarderline saterday... if it dosnt snow... i went once and didnt like it but with bad company noone has fun.. perhaps this time will be better... If ryan and brandon dont go with me and cayci then us girls from work are going to have a girl snight out which will be fun.

Well fans of ThE QuEeN, (lol) i must depart 
~much love~

"event","well Jay and I are on a ""BREAK"" not broken up but not together... does that make sence? well because we fight like a republican and a democrat in a steel cage its best that we take time to fix us.. i love him more than anyone or anything i have ever had affection for in my life.. it was hard to accept that we need this but im sure it is the right thing to do.. i feel empty without his ring on my finger... not the ring but what it represents... perhaps we jumped too fast like everyone says but i really do love him.. not school girl crushes like ive had before and not simple infatuation like ive had before but true and passionate love.. well thats enough of that... lol

Snow is bad... i hate it.... its beautiful but it made me stranded at work... daddy came and got me i was gonna spend the night with my cayci but daddy shoed up just and her dad was getting ready to take us home... oh well

I love cayci being home... i know that shed rather be at school and i wish that i had gone too but things happen... im glad that we get to spend more time together now it makes me happy.

life is monotonus nothing exciting ever happens.. i work too much."

"event","I know ive been really lazy on updating but so much has gone on that its really been hard to find time to breathe never the less here i am... i guess its pointless to try to go back over what has happened to ill just skip ahead to today.
Cayci came in today so we desided to go to the movies... but we wanted to bowl first.... we forgot that they are shutting down the mark so there we were with nothing to do before the movie. 
I was just kidding around and suggested that we go play Bingo... and we did. 
Bing Bingo virgins we had no idea about how to go about getting started... and the guy at the counted asked us if we had blotters.... needless to say we didnt know what the hell a blotter was.. (its the marker thingy used to mark your numbers)
there were like .001% young people at the Bingo place yet one chick came and sat withus and explaind stuff to us... who knew bingo was so complex.
There are some old lady's that take it very seriously... they have sepcially made bags to hold thier blotters... its funny.
there was one evil looking old woman sitting at the next table who yelled out ""son of a bitch"" when another person yelled bingo. Then she sat there complaining about how much she hated bingo... hmmm....
It was a vey interesting day."

"event","Ok i know that i havnt updated in quite a while, however that is because life as of late has been complety full and i havnt had time to breathe much less spend my time on my silly lil journal.... which i actually find comforting at times. 

School isnt so horrid ne more.... i actually kinda like being able to actually listen in my classes apposed to talking as i am accustomed lol. (except in Gillis's class w/ Kel but that dosnt count lol)

Work is still a bitch except for Ash and Jay... but it pays the bills who am i to complain?

Love?!?!?!? me? yes actually i have fallen in love.... its quite amazing how a person can change your veiws on everything by just showing that they truthfully care about you and are not interested in you soley for physical reasons (however those physical reason have become a plus to the love we share) At one time in my life i never thought i would ever care about another guy in my life but it has happened and every minute has been completly earth shattering. We have no secrets from eachother, even my past (which he dosnt approve of but accepts me for who i was and who i am now) I couldnt ask for a better boyfriend than Jay. He makes me happy, hopefully we will share a good future together. 

I miss Cayci despite what she may think, its really hard living life without ur bestfriend to turn to whenever you need her....it feels like she is a million miles away.... i miss ya babes and i love ya.

Ryan i hope u made the right decision and are happier."

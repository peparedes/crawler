"event","&nbsp;I feel just down. This weekend of loss of lacking. I should think this is a time of abundance but when is life not a constant repouring of water from glass to glass? My grandmother used to make tea that way, pour it back and forth from one delicate tiny vessel to the other setting the temperature just right, me drinking it anyway she would hand it. &nbsp;I don't think I handle death well. Well I dont know how can anyone really say they handle death &quot;well&quot;.. its just internalized to be so final."

Problems are far more likely to arise in the social sphere.

"event","Sick of all this working - longing for a sinking.

I am doing an art installation. 400 white origami cranes, suspended by fish line, weighed by little pearls. Im 1/4 way through this venture - it has to be installed Saturday morning. This is for the techno/house monthly I am involved with. Our kickoff was very successful last month. Think late 80s, early 90s detroit sound, mixed with current minimal ""sophisticated"" sound of berlin. We were written up in the local paper. The people who came were lined out the door and it was a really great mix, 21+, gay, straight, much older people, foreign students, it was all there - sweaty dancing. The garage door flew open to the strings of life and the party spilled out onto the sidewalk.

For the 20th I am supposed to do another installation for a sascha funke show. Its pretty trying since the budget is typically less than 100 dollars - and this is something I am doing gratis. 

Besides that I am in the home stretch on my building. My BIM workflow has so far been proving itself - its not perfect however and I am still stressed because I really want this to be successful. So far the client is very happy, 2 of us have turned out what will be 100% CDs in one month time for a 64k sq. ft. facility. Its record time, impeccable detail - there are glitches that I get hassled about from my PM - but this is also an incredibly new foray for us so its expected - and we are pretty much the only ones trying this ""method"" in our area. Anyway, if this pans out, there is a future for another 2 projects via this client atop the snazzy apartment building I will be applying this approach to in the meantime.

I know things are drying up, but here we are pretty busy at least (for the next 6 months of backlog)  after letting 4 people go.. 

My days, including weekends have been 10-12 hours working at the office, then home, to make the orgami installation. I am really looking forward to Monday."

"event","Ive had this friend through a blog journal who ive been following for a couple years... she was moving to new zealand when i first found her blog so i followed it cos it was interesting. She was around my age when she passed away this week, she moved to new zealand, started her own Mac business, filmed a documentary about her ordeal moving, getting married, and discovering she had cancer... leukemia.
 
 its weird because as there are many people we all interact with online sometimes casually sometimes more, even people on here ..you get a glimpse of their personality sometimes and more.. Melanie wrote at lengths about her leukemia and about her move and about all the things she was looking forward and it feels odd that her life has extinguished. It makes me mad that something like cancer can strike someone who was healthy, happy and living well. I know its not a &quot;typical&quot; death as in a friend you actually knew in real life but its still feels uncomfortable and sad, because for a brief moment you read the thoughts and feelings of someone as if they were a close friend...
 
 &quot;There are no certainties, only opportunities.
 We are here to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is.&quot;

Watching something like this makes me think about - what it is I&nbsp;am doing in my life - when life is so short in the grand scheme of things, when there are so many people that are in need or at least comfort, compassion.. It frightens me a little too, to think of my own parents - when they talk about moving back to Poland, what will happen to them when they become elderly?? It reminds of my grandmother..."

I&nbsp;just want to kiss him and hug him =) I&nbsp;wish and want to spend&nbsp; more time with him.. perhaps in the spring I can make more trips Chicago bound for weekends.. I&nbsp;love coming down 55 and merging onto the Kennedy and&nbsp; the skyscrapers reveled. I&nbsp;make a point to drive down Lake Shore Drive and gaze at the lake every time. The sheer amount of life and energy is very amazing....and ever present sailboats, even in the fall and winter.. just make me so, surprisingly happy. 

I felt happiest when Larry and I&nbsp;were at subterranean and there was great house music, the bar was packed and everyone was dancing. I&nbsp;felt content when I stayed with him at his parents house. I&nbsp;felt grateful when we shared dinner with Tara and my family and our friends at Tara's house.. I&nbsp;wish I had more time to spend with my sister and just now I realize how huge an adjustment this is, for her to be married, all of a sudden. I miss her, she was so eternally young in my eyes, being the older sister.. and yet now shes this &quot;married woman&quot; LOL.. &nbsp; I&nbsp;did spend time with my mom, which as always was stressed in a very familiar way.. but even that this time.. I&nbsp;had to let go. I&nbsp;enjoyed her awkward company in away, especially when we visited her friends, it was such a tiny tiny peek into the context of the life my mom came into when she immigrated here, and its not often seen. People can be pretty animated and pretty private yet wise. 

These days I feel so utterly pressed for time, like I&nbsp;need to get in all the good time with my family that I&nbsp;can.. not that anything is imminent but just cos... it all passes so quickly. 

I ventured to Pilsen this trip, to the Skylark.. and up Blue Island. I&nbsp;used to live there, that was my context, that was my life so long ago! ... And I&nbsp;even ran into Sheryl and had an impromptu thanksgiving leftover feast with Touissaint and his brother...

I&nbsp;feel like its been 9 lives, that Im very grateful for.. and yet long for as well.. it all came and went so fast...

 and now its back to Pittsburgh, my home here, with Larry."

Sometimes I go whole days  
listening bored, half sleep  
I won't say anything  
that's worth a thing to me  
One day, suddenly, time  
took a turn that once felt so brief  
I blinked to see polite ghosts fading quickly  
 
What begins as an unguarded  
train of thoughts slowly can become  
an addiction to the slumber  
of disconnection and the resonance  
of memory that no longer has a shape  
but keeps you numb through  
the hours tills gone is another day  
 
Be aware, my darling  
these things I say I mean  
are just traces of something  
I long to feel again  
I see our time expand  
in the air almost forcibly,  
spreading thinner till it dissolves completely"

It's the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches in numbers this nation has never seen, by people who waited three hours and four hours, many for the first time in their lives, because they believed that this time must be different, that their voices could be that difference.

It's the answer spoken by young and old, rich and poor, Democrat and Republican, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, disabled and not disabled. Americans who sent a message to the world that we have never been just a collection of individuals or a collection of red states and blue states.

We are, and always will be, the United States of America.

It's the answer that led those who've been told for so long by so many to be cynical and fearful and doubtful about what we can achieve to put their hands on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope of a better day.

It's been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this date in this election at this defining moment change has come to America.

A little bit earlier this evening, I received an extraordinarily gracious call from Sen. McCain.

Sen. McCain fought long and hard in this campaign. And he's fought even longer and harder for the country that he loves. He has endured sacrifices for America that most of us cannot begin to imagine. We are better off for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader.

I congratulate him; I congratulate Gov. Palin for all that they've achieved. And I look forward to working with them to renew this nation's promise in the months ahead.

I want to thank my partner in this journey, a man who campaigned from his heart, and spoke for the men and women he grew up with on the streets of Scranton and rode with on the train home to Delaware, the vice president-elect of the United States, Joe Biden.

And I would not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support of my best friend for the last 16 years the rock of our family, the love of my life, the nation's next first lady Michelle Obama.

Sasha and Malia I love you both more than you can imagine. And you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the new White House.

And while she's no longer with us, I know my grandmother's watching, along with the family that made me who I am. I miss them tonight. I know that my debt to them is beyond measure.

To my sister Maya, my sister Alma, all my other brothers and sisters, thank you so much for all the support that you've given me. I am grateful to them.

And to my campaign manager, David Plouffe, the unsung hero of this campaign, who built the best -- the best political campaign, I think, in the history of the United States of America.

To my chief strategist David Axelrod who's been a partner with me every step of the way.

To the best campaign team ever assembled in the history of politics you made this happen, and I am forever grateful for what you've sacrificed to get it done.

But above all, I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to. It belongs to you. It belongs to you.

I was never the likeliest candidate for this office. We didn't start with much money or many endorsements. Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington. It began in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concord and the front porches of Charleston. It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give $5 and $10 and $20 to the cause.

It grew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation's apathy who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep.

It drew strength from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on doors of perfect strangers, and from the millions of Americans who volunteered and organized and proved that more than two centuries later a government of the people, by the people, and for the people has not perished from the Earth.

This is your victory.

And I know you didn't do this just to win an election. And I know you didn't do it for me.

You did it because you understand the enormity of the task that lies ahead. For even as we celebrate tonight, we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime -- two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a century.

Even as we stand here tonight, we know there are brave Americans waking up in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives for us.

There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after the children fall asleep and wonder how they'll make the mortgage or pay their doctors' bills or save enough for their child's college education.

There's new energy to harness, new jobs to be created, new schools to build, and threats to meet, alliances to repair.

The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year or even in one term. But, America, I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there.

I promise you, we as a people will get there.

There will be setbacks and false starts. There are many who won't agree with every decision or policy I make as president. And we know the government can't solve every problem.

But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face. I will listen to you, especially when we disagree. And, above all, I will ask you to join in the work of remaking this nation, the only way it's been done in America for 221 years -- block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand.

What began 21 months ago in the depths of winter cannot end on this autumn night.

This victory alone is not the change we seek. It is only the chance for us to make that change. And that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were.

It can't happen without you, without a new spirit of service, a new spirit of sacrifice.

So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism, of responsibility, where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves but each other.

Let us remember that, if this financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers.

In this country, we rise or fall as one nation, as one people. Let's resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long.

Let's remember that it was a man from this state who first carried the banner of the Republican Party to the White House, a party founded on the values of self-reliance and individual liberty and national unity.

Those are values that we all share. And while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight, we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress.

As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours, we are not enemies but friends. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection.

And to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn, I may not have won your vote tonight, but I hear your voices. I need your help. And I will be your president, too.

And to all those watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces, to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of the world, our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand.

To those -- to those who would tear the world down: We will defeat you. To those who seek peace and security: We support you. And to all those who have wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright: Tonight we proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity and unyielding hope.

That's the true genius of America: that America can change. Our union can be perfected. What we've already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow.

This election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations. But one that's on my mind tonight's about a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta. She's a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election except for one thing: Ann Nixon Cooper is 106 years old.

She was born just a generation past slavery; a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two reasons -- because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin.

And tonight, I think about all that she's seen throughout her century in America -- the heartache and the hope; the struggle and the progress; the times we were told that we can't, and the people who pressed on with that American creed: Yes we can.

At a time when women's voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot. Yes we can.

When there was despair in the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal, new jobs, a new sense of common purpose. Yes we can.

When the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness and a democracy was saved. Yes we can.

She was there for the buses in Montgomery, the hoses in Birmingham, a bridge in Selma, and a preacher from Atlanta who told a people that ""We Shall Overcome."" Yes we can.

A man touched down on the moon, a wall came down in Berlin, a world was connected by our own science and imagination.

And this year, in this election, she touched her finger to a screen, and cast her vote, because after 106 years in America, through the best of times and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change.

Yes we can.

America, we have come so far. We have seen so much. But there is so much more to do. So tonight, let us ask ourselves -- if our children should live to see the next century; if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see? What progress will we have made?

This is our chance to answer that call. This is our moment.

This is our time, to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids; to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim the American dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth, that, out of many, we are one; that while we breathe, we hope. And where we are met with cynicism and doubts and those who tell us that we can't, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people: Yes, we can.

Thank you. God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America"

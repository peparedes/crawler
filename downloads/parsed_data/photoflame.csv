I Tested it out last night and it works wonderfully. I have to say making the rooms light tight was a pain in the ass though. Five trips to home depot.....ugh. Hope everybody had a happy V-day. I spent mine alone with my chemicals. yeah."

The funeral is on tuesday morning and I have a long drive ahead of me. I wish my family could get together under happier circumstances. I still have no idea where I'm staying and politics are getting in the way of me bringing a co-driver. 
Thank you to <lj user=""in_effigie""> for keeping me company in the hard time today. I needed it.

I didnt do one thing right today. 
I didnt show what I needed to show.
I didnt act how i needed to act.
It nothing new I suppose.....shooting myself in the foot. More aptly in the heart........
Ive commited emotional suicide more times than i can count.....
I hold on in all the wrong ways......
I cant let go though, I just dont know how to control my heart  when it screams out to do something.
I should learn the harder I try to grip, the more it slips away......
I wish I could just be the person I need and want to be.
I simply not good enough.
I know it sounds dramatic but thats what I was told by three people today.
I think they are right. 
When will I have the strength to be the person I need to be.
With time can trust ever be truely earned back.
I need to scream but I know i dont have the courage.
My thought are now in fragments not phrases.

I am devoid of speech so these describe how i feel.

O, never say that I was false of heart,
Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify.
As easy might I from myself depart
As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie:
That is my home of love: if I have ranged,
Like him that travels I return again,
Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,
So that myself bring water for my stain.
Never believe, though in my nature reign'd
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
That it could so preposterously be stain'd,
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;
For nothing this wide universe I call,
Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.
Shakespear's sonnet 109

In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,
For they in thee a thousand errors note;
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
Who in despite of view is pleased to dote;
Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted,
Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,
Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited
To any sensual feast with thee alone:
But my five wits nor my five senses can
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,
Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man,
Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be:
Only my plague thus far I count my gain,
That she that makes me sin awards me pain.
sonnet 141"

"event","Your type is: INTP

INTP - ""Architect"". Greatest precision in thought and language. Can readily discern contradictions and inconsistencies. The world exists primarily to be understood. 3.3% of total population. 

INTPs are very logical, analytical people who like to think about concepts and ideas, searching for the perfect solution to problems. They are detached, intellectual, and complex, always looking for different challenges. INTPs are very independent, skeptical and often brilliant. They are able to stay calm, even in the most difficult situations. INTPs are intolerant of redundancy and slow people, and are bored by simple issues. They are likely to ignore any rules, people or tasks they consider trivial. One thing they often consider trivial is emotion, their's and other's. Because of this they don't realize that other people need praise and reassurance, and INTPs are usually not good with relationships. They are intensely private, and very hard to get to know. INTPs are highly selective about with whom they will share their ideas, and they won't share their deepest feelings with anyone. They dislike and distrust authority, only respecting knowledge. 

INTPs are on a constant search to understand everything, and learn everything they can. They learn anything they decide is worth the effort at an incredible speed, and are able to apply the knowledge to other areas immediately. INTPs have a natural skill for finding flaws in projects and logic, and at findingsolutions to the problems. They are good at thinking up ideas, and starting projects, but they often lose interest or ignore the details of it, and it doesn't end as well as they had hoped. INTPs work best alone, and when in groups they seem detached and rarely contribute. They have creative imaginations and see possibilities where others don't. INTPs have a global perspective, and are more interested in theories than their practical applications. 

They are not very good at sharing their complex thoughts and ideas, and in conversation they will often pause to think. INTPs are not very appearance-conscious and often look slightly disheveled. They also are not generally well-understood, and feel slightly isolated."

"event","so let me get this straight
say now you loved me all along?
what made you hesitate
to tell me with words what you really feel

i can see it in your eyes you mean all of what you say
i remember so long ago, see i felt that same way
now we both have separate lives and lovers
insignificantly enough we both have significant others

only time will tell
time will turn and tell

we are who we were when
could've been lovers but at least you're still my day late friend
we are who we were when
who knew what we know now
could've been more but at least you're still my day late friend

but thoughts they change and times they rearrange i don't know who you are anymore
loves come and go and this i know i'm not who you recall anymore
but i must confess you're so much more then i remember
can't help but entertain these thoughts
thoughts of us together

so let me get this straight
all these years and you were no where to be found
and now you want me for your own
but you're a day late and my love's still renowned"

"event","It's quiet now
And what it brings
Is everything

Comes calling back
A brilliant night
I'm still awake

I looked ahead
I'm sure I saw you there

You don't need me
To tell you now
That nothing can compare

You might have laughed if I told you
You might have hidden A frown
You might have succeeded in changing me
I might have been turned around

It's easier to leave than to be left behind
Leaving was never my proud
Leaving New York, never easy
I saw the light fading out

Now life is sweet
And what it brings
I tried to take
But loneliness
It wears me out
It lies in way

And all not lost
Still in my eyes
The shadow of necklace
Across your thigh
I might've lived my life in a dream, but I swear
This is real
Memory fuses and shatters like glass
Mercurial future, forget the past
It's you, it's what I feel.

You might have laughed if I told you (it's pulling me apart)
You might have hidden a frown (change)
You might have succeeded in changing me (it's pulling me apart)
I might have been turned around (change)

It's easier to leave than to be left behind (it's pulling me apart)
Leaving was never my proud (change)
Leaving New York, never easy (it's pulling me apart)
I saw the light fading out
You find it in your heart, it's pulling me apart
You find it in your heart, change...

I told you, forever
I love you, forever
I told you, I love you
I love you, forever
I told you, forever
I love you, forever
I told you, I love you
I love you, forever

You never, you never
You told me forever

You might have laughed if I told you
You might have hidden the frown
You might have succeeded in changing me
I might have been turned around

It's easier to leave than to be left behind (it's pulling me apart)
Leaving was never my proud (change)
Leaving New York never easy (it's pulling me apart)
I saw the life fading out (change)
Leaving New York, never easy (it's pulling me apart)
I saw the light fading out (change)
Leaving New York never easy (it's pulling me apart)
I saw the life fading out (change)"

CHOICE 1:keep the bull shit up, and i'll juz resort to playing that childish b.s. game..cuz i got quite a few things i can go ahead and tell people..plus since ya find it so easy to lie, i can start that as well.
CHOICE 2:grow up, act mature as your age, and we need to have a little talk..this is keen, I DONT WANNA EVER BE WITH YOU AGAIN..but this needs to get resolved for both our sakes..
so there ya go, the choice is yours, but remember, I have COMMITMENT..and if this continues, i'm done being the mature, adult who ignores it all..i'll go right into it, and my clout and reach has grown ALOT in the past couple months."

"event","""I heard a voice through the dischord
Of a deluge of passers-by.
I saw one gaze frozen in time
Watching me passing by.
I swear I'll know your face in the crowd,
And I'll hear your voice so loud
When you're whispering...

Hey unfaithful I will teach you
To be stronger, to be stronger.
Hey ungraceful I will teach you
To forgive one another.

Here's my kiss to betray
Desperate to brush the lips of grace.
Do you feel hollow when you think of how I've lied?

Oh sweet angel of mercy with your grace like the morning
Wrap your loving arms around me.
Oh sweet angel of mercy with your grace like the morning
Wrap your loving arms around me.

Hey unfaithful I will teach you
To be stronger, to be stronger.
Hey ungraceful I will teach you
To forgive one another.
Hey unfaithful I will teach you
To be stronger, to be stronger.

Hey unloving,

I will love you.
I will love you.
I will love you.

Jesus, I'm ready to come home.
Jesus, I'm ready to come home.
I'm ready to come

Hey unfaithful,
Hey ungraceful,
Hey unloving,
I will love you.
Hey unloving,
I will love you.



ok..aint done alot on here for awhile..so here goes..
memories...as part of my OpSec training in the service, i was taught how to forget certain memories, to the extent that they could never be brought back. now what better gift could i be given, ya know? and God only knows i've tried to use it..yall know what memories i tried too, cuz if ya know me at all, ya know what i'm referring to. but regardless, it doesn't work. i remember sitting on debbies bus, freshman year, noticing the long-sleeve 'fox' shirt..i remember the ""i love landon"" written in ink on skin..i remember the ""justin...make them stop.""'s..and the ""i love you""'s, the clandestine hand holding, the hug at the mall, the secret kiss, 'lord of the rings' and 'cheaper by the dozen'..the cruise, olive garden, the drive from the bookstore to red lobster, the bikeride on christmas eve morning, the prayer in the woods, the hour long goodbyes..i remember the front porch after the dirt bike accident, the distance in clarksville, the musical, the friday tacos, the pool..i remember the disney world story, speak, coming home, and the littlest mile..i remember the letter in red with pictures that made my heart ache and a fear i could never let come true..i try to kill it all away, but i can't..i remember everything.
alot of time has come to pass..the sun rises and the sun sets, and between them my life changes..since the moment i came into this world, i've been different everyday. somebody like you lindsay, has no idea what i've become. no idea of the evils that took root deep within, no idea of the goodness also taking hold..as i cannot honestly say a single word of what YOU have become, having not seen or talked to you in almost a year, YOU, likewise, cannot honestly say a single word about me. ya see, you reading this proves my very point: i am not dead to you, whether ya wanna believe it or not. no more then you are dead to me, which regardless of how much i try to convince myself of such, is also untrue. allie, (since i know you're also reading this), i like ya alot. lindsay can say i liked all her friends, but really theres only one, being you. now i already made that apparent, as well as my knowledge of chances, in my myspace blog..no need to repeat it here..you two are the best lookin gals i ever saw, and probably the funnest to be around as well. defenately the coolest. it's done been established that i'm not cut out for relationships, which leaves me at the same place i am left with my friends. leaves me at the same place i was 2 years ago..and that is happiness, and it's assurance. lindsay, i told ya before, all i care about is your happiness..if it was to be with me, awesome, if not, i'd have to deal..and i gave my word on that, so my word i must keep. the same is to be said to allie. me and lindsay aren't friends, yet she still gets the treatment of my friends, and that's my undying loyalty..anytime my friends need help, they call me, because they know i'll get the job done, that i won't let them down..whether it's desired or not, both yall, lindsay and allie, deserve that..can't do it in the service anymore, but it's in my blood, so i must continue..

and yes, lance, sarah, annalisa, matt, david, mikey and nick are all still considered my friends under that treatment..no matter how much of a ghost they make me.."

"event","ok, so, lets do this...
i've fucked up, alot, in my life. more times then i could count. so much so, that i've lost count. and thanks to my trying to pretend they didn't happen, only god knows for sure all of them. somebody told me awhile back that i hurt them. that what i did was unreversable. i know exactly what they're talking about. and while i question the alligation that i hurt them, judging from their reaction and subsequent actions, i still have to come to terms with the fact that it may be true as accused. and considering such, i have to look at myself and say ""i did do that"" not ""i didn't"". the prospect of it being true, hurts me more then my father ever could have. more then anybody ever could. to make peace with god alone would never suffice, and to make peace with the afflicted would never happen, regardless of how strong i tried. even to a jesusfreak i'm unforgivable. and not just for the one offense either..for any/all of them. i went to a padre a few times over the week, and to say i've learned the act of contrition by heart is an understatement. of course what do they tell ya to do? confess to and ask for forgiveness by the person ya wronged, which i would try, knowing the outcome, but all the same. only problem is it's impossible for me to speak to the person, so this is all that i've got. 
i got an ass load of stuff to get off my chest, but that'll wait...one sin at a time, as the padre put it..."

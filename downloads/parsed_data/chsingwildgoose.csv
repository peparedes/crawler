"event","Quick! What do you get when you unite a college professor, a record label owner, a molecular geneticist, and a veteran punk rock record producer? You get pop punk legends Squirtgun! For the last decade, this Lafayette, Ind.-based outfit has been setting the standard for composing songs laden with infectious guitar riffs, sweet harmonies, and poignant lyrics. Don't believe me? One needs only to watch the opening credits of Kevin Smith's ""Mallrats"" for recorded proof.

Squirtgun is very much a DIY (do-it-yourself) band. Guitarist Flav Giorgini, when not publishing his research findings in some of North America's most respected scientific journals, actually builds the guitars and basses that Squirtgun uses. He also crafts them for folks in other bands. Members of Alkaline Trio, Supersuckers, Danzig, and Monster Magnet swear by Flav's Giorgini Precision Craft wares.

Bassist Mass Giorgini serves as the band's resident producer and recording studio facilitator at his own Sonic Iguana. When Mass is not recording his own band, he can be found working with a veritable who's who of punk rock. Various members of Green Day, Operation Ivy, Amazing Transparent Men, and Screeching Weasel have done time at the downtown Lafayette studio.

New drummer Mike Felumlee hails from punk sensations Alkaline Trio and legendary Chicago outfit the Smoking Popes. He also runs Double Zero Records, whose roster boasts the likes of pop craftsmen Duvall, the indie-pop of Jenny Choi, and Alkaline Trio's Dan Andriano.

When singer Matt Hart is not freaking out on stage, he edits Forklift, Ohio -- a Cincinnati-based zine dedicated to poetry and short stories -- and teaches at the prestigious Art Academy of Cincinnati.

Currently on tour with radio darlings the Ataris, Squirtgun has just released the stunning Fade To Bright via Fat Mike's (NOFX) label, Honest Don's. A defining moment of the band's work, this album brings together Squirtgun's penchant for cleverly written sing-along songs with their friends in Anti-Flag, the legendary Jawbreaker, the Chinkees, and the aforementioned Ataris."

The God Awfuls
If you don't know them yet, you will soon. They only have one cd out and they are already my favorite band. They are kinda like an Anti-Flag with a way better singer and faster music, and more outstanding guitars.
Album - Next Stop: Armageddon
Songs - East Side One, Sister, Bullets and Batons

Happy Campers
Crazy band with very awesome fast and cool sounding guitar stuff. Entertaining and often funny lyrics. Awesome band. Bad Religion, Pennwise, Nofx influenced.
Album - Happy Campers
Songs - Please, Hurting You, Tubes

Tsunami Bomb
Sounds simular to an AFI but with non-screaming female vocals. Awesome music, hot chick.
Album - Ultimate Escape.

Bad Religion 
I don't need to explain.

AFI - Rizzo in the Box

I'm always around you to show you that I care, but I don't know what for. 
It seems to me that you couldn't care less so I'm not gonna do it anymore.
I see no reason why I've placed such a value on you, but my thoughts have changed now,
I've opened my eyes and now I'm through.
Looking back at my short life, the few pleasures that I've found,
All your misconceptions pummel me to the ground.
Now, I look at your small life and it doesn't mean a bit. 
I pick myself up off the ground 'cause I don't give a shit.
They say all good things come to an end, I wish this didn't apply.
You were once someone I called my friend but that's all changed now and I don't know why.
Things are very different now.
You've got nothing to say.
It's sad when someone you know very well decides to fucking die and go away.



AWW! no need to thank me, trust me, you deserve much more than this."

Two ways to go but you can't decide,
Follows all rules, has no say...
Ends up in somebody else's play.
Close your eyes cause you just don't need them anyway!
Lose as directed, don't take no chance,
Don't hinge your life upon circumstance.
Mystery and misery go hand in hand,
So you better follow the master plan.
Don't use your head, lose as directed!
Little boy sitting in his master's arms,
Safe and protected from any harm...
Wants to be a man, wants to branch out,
But he's told not to ask questions or doubt.
Close your mind, it's a book of instructions now!
Lose as directed don't take no chance,
Don't hinge your life upon circumstance,
Mystery and misery go hand in hand...

Don't use your head, lose as directed,

Monkey see, monkey do,

Don't hinge your life upon circumstance,
Mystery and misery go hand in hand...

"event","Well, i guess it is safe to say it is fairly obvious that this is my
new livejournal. I deleted the other two if you have not noticed. I did
that because both were filled with shit i just didnt want to read
anymore, not all of it is bad, but more of it was than good. In this
livejournal i have decided to only provide postive, entertaining, and
informative entries. No more complaints, no more sad shit, nothing more
than.... well, what i listed.<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>"

"event","There was a man who banged his head against a wall,
<br>
He banged for 20 years, the damn thing wouldn't fall,
<br>
He left an honest life,
He left a broken wife,
<br>
He left it all behind, just to see what he could find...

<br>
<br>
Millions and millions chase the wild goose tonight,
<br>
To conquer loneliness they'll chase it all their lives,
<br>
And when they find it they can just lay down and die,
<br>
It seems the game is mostly pointless in the presence of the prize...

<br>
<br>
There was a woman who had a man as cold as ice,
<br>
He built four walls so strong and he kept her locked inside,
<br>
She harbored loneliness,
Her husband couldn't guess,
<br>
That she'd take off her dress,
And kill herself without a mess..."

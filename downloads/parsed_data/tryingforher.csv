"event","This week has been really tough. I have not shown the sadness that I feel inside of my heart, but i can feel it setting in. I lost my Abuelito this week to cancer, and I feel angry. Anger is never the answer, and i know this none the less, but all i feel is anger about losing my Abuelito. I remember when I was four and my entire family would go to my Abuelito's house for Sunday's, we would all just laugh and eat together. My parents and my grandparents have taught me so much. Becoming older is not such a terrible thing, you grow so much as a person and develop an entirely new sense of self. My Abuelito was the person that told me one of the most important things in my life, ""know what you want, fight to keep it."" Throughout this entire year I have grown so much as a person, school is going so well, work is still work, family relationships are no longer fractured, overall the statement that my Abuelito told me is a large truth. I miss him so much that i find it hard to fight the tears away. 

Finals is finally done!!! I am so excited to start winter break already, I thought that it would never come. I love the holiday season, with all its cheer and warmth, the world just seems so happy during this season. Kiyana is on her way home, and I don't have the words to express how happy that makes me. She will be going to Europe in a month, and I know that I will be very sad, but the odd thing is that when a sane person would think twice about falling in love with someone who leaves so much, i relish the opportunity that she has to travel around Europe and experience things that are going to be totally new to her. I know that we are still young, but i believe that fear should not dictate any part of our lives. I was terrified to go into Victoria's secret to get her something, but I did it all by myself. I choose not to let fear dictate how i act in my relationships with my friends, family, and Kiyana. I can only hope that Kiyana can realize what i have realized the first moment i saw her at hana's, because even though she will be away for four months, she will be close to my heart every single day just as she is now. 

This winter break I have had my share of heartbreaks that are still eating me up inside, and hopefully i dont begin 2008 with another heart break. 

""know what you want, fight to keep it!""

I love you Abueltio. Thank you for teaching me so much and to also know how to have faith in someone, even if that someone doesn't have a lot of faith in herself."

"event","I have not updated this in a very long time, in fact t's been almost four years!! well, no time like the present. Here is an update on what has been going on in my ife...

1. Finishing up my aa in Edmonds community college
2. Learning how be a better brother for a sister who is trying to find herself
3. Currently with Kiyana Daba who lives in San Fran but also resides in Seattle
4. Looking forward to the next eight months of absolute craziness
5. Learning how to look forward to the future but not forgetting about the present

These are just some of the few things that i have learned about for the last year or so. It's crazy that I have a sister who is now going to be 17 years old, a brother who is starting a new career, parents who are looking towards retirement, and also a girlfriend who shows her true brilliance every moment i am with her. I have learned a lot over this year, and I have become as strong as i could have ever thought that i could have been. I am truly in love and I know that is enough to get through anything. 

To sum up, this year has been the best year since junior year and i am looking forward to more!!!!"

"event","driving is such a good thing. i can see her without even having to ask my parents if i can go to her house and see her. it's such an easy thing to do, but it's also a responsibility."

"event","haven't updated in awhile, and someone told me too...so since i'm kinda sitting in my class doing absolutely nothing, than there's no better time than now...the last two weeks have been pretty stressful. finals, basketball, and work. never a good combination. kiyana can't even understand how i seem to be so calm on the surface. i remember how she was for her finals, she was so stressed, i just thought that if i was like that i would not be helping her if i was doing the same thing as she did. kiyana was gone for a weekend, i mean i didn't talk to her for a whole three days, hahaha. i know anyone who is reading this is probably thinking to themself, ""three days isn't that long."" well, kiyana and i have not gone two days without talking. i really missed her. i missed her so much that i skipped school yesterday and decided to go be with her. it would have been a picture perfect day if there wasn't that stupid doctors appointment. he told me that i tore some ligaments in my hamstring, and that i should not play on it. screw that idea, i made my basketball team, and i'm not about to let it all go to hell, cause of some stupid doctor. see, i've been telling my friends for years, that doctors are no good... it's always bad news. oh well, at least she's back now. i'm so glad that she's back, i've missed my babi!"

"event","ever wonder, what life would be like if certain things did or did not happen...i don't want her as a friend...i want her as more than that...i want to hold her, to hug her, to love her...friends are always great to have, but that one person is so hard to find. i found it, and i will not lose it..i dont care if i have to annoy the hell out of her...i will get back with her...i know it may sound odd to anyone else but her and i, but i really do love her, so much more than just a friend...i knew i loved her before i met her, and it still feels like that...i need her as my other...i need her so much, that i have to tell her about what it has been like for me the past couple of weeks...i love her, and because i love her and she loves me, i'm going to fix this, and start from scratch...i have been waiting all my life...i will not lose her."

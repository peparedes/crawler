"event","Well i'm off... TExas here i come!  The Sunset looks so damn cool up here!  There is one thing that i hate about flying, i get 5 hrs to think... think about everything.... This whole moving thing is actually something I've done for me.... No one else! just me. I got away from the WA environment... its time to finally be truly happy again! Texas brings all the joy in the world.   I was talking to Jessye in the airport in Seattle... and we decided we are going to be sober together.  We are growing up and i love it.  Lately i have been looking around at my surroundings and its so crazy... we are growing up... im almost 18... i never thought i would live that long haha!  when i was cleaning and packing, i found a lot of pictures one in particular jumped out at me... it was a picture of me, kenya, rachel travis, Kaytee O., and Jaimie in the 9th grade at the park having a picnic. That was back when i used to smoke cigarettes and when we all thought we were rebels! we looked so young.. but now we all drive, have jobs, have/had boyfriends, we are living.... SEnior year is here... its almost over.... my alltime... To BE CONTINUED!"

On and on and on and on and on
I am lost in the see-thru
I think you lost yourself too
Throughout all of this confusion
I think we'll somehow make it through
Each day just drags on by
Bringing with you a new life
Just when I think I could die
You come and bring me back to life, and you say
You can't change the way you feel
And you can't tell me this ain't real, cuz this is real
In the end it's all I've got, so I'm gonna hold on (and on and on...)
On and on and on
Ohhh....on and on and on
Now you've got me watching your eyes
Got me waiting just to see
If it goes away, it never will
Your eyes are watching me...oh
And I practiced all the things I'd say
To tell you how I feel
And when I finally get my chance it all seems so surreal
And now you got me thinking 'bout the first time that I met you
And now I can't foret you, now I won't forget you, you say
You can't change the way you feel
And you can't tell me this ain't real, cuz this is real
In the end it's all I've got, so I'm gonna hold on (and on and on...)
On and on and on
Ohhh....on and on and on

hey yall! yeah today was pretty okay.. i was havin a pretty shitty day at first cuz whitney and i were not talking.. and i was just sad.. and then we started talking again in 4th period! haha so that made me happy.. then in 6th period i had an appointment in the counseling center to talk to my counselor. and i had asked him about what he thought of me going to a school in texas that will help me graduate. and he talked to me about how i would be living and all that and how i would support myself and me and my logical answers made him come to the conclusion that i should do it.. so right now im thinking.. should i talk to my mom about living with Jessye, or should i talk to my dad about living with him. i dunno thats the next decision to make. i know that my dad will be very skeptical about it cuz he doesn't like me living with him but i have a way to prove that im not the horrible child that i used to be or so he makes me out to be lol.. I wouldn't be going until may. then i would have my license and i could get a job and i would have to tell him that the only way that im going to graduate is if i go to the school Jessye goes to.. yeah i dunno i got a lot of thinking to do tonite.. i have church also.. and i need to clean my room. american idol is on tonite also.. wow.. lol so i guess im gonna go to church and have my mom tape american idol.. then i will watch it when i get home while im cleaning my room haha good plan!! ya! neways.. yeah this Peter guy.. hes pretty cool. a nice person to talk to online and stuff.. its weird tho him and his friends remind me of the people in the book im reading haha! HI PETER!! haha! and then there is Justin! ahh he amazes me. i wish there was  way to put it all into words. he makes me oh so happy. there are two things that are killin me right now. not being able to be in texas to see Justin. and not being able to be in texas to see all my friends.. it sucks but soon.. if not may.. then definitely June.

I got accepted as an LIT to Camp Gilead and i dunno.. i have like 3 days left to turn in my contract i dunno tho if i wanna do it.. we'll see.. maybe some major thing will happen and make me want to do it more than anything. who knows.. neways.. ttyl..

You may think you see 
Who I really am 
But you'll never know me 
Every day 
It's as if I play a part 
Now I see 
If I wear a mask 
I can fool the world 
But I cannot fool my heart 

Who is that girl I see 
Staring straight back at me? 
When will my reflection show 
Who I am inside? 

I am now 
In a world where I 
Have to hide my heart 
And what I believe in 
But somehow 
I will show the world 
What's inside my heart 
And be loved for who I am 

Who is that girl I see 
Staring straight back at me? 
Why is my reflection 
Someone I don't know? 
Must I pretend that I'm 
Someone else for all time? 
When will my reflection show 
Who I am inside? 

There's a heart that must be 
Free to fly 
That burns with a need to know 
The reason why 

Why must we all conceal 
What we think, how we feel? 
Must there be a secret me 
I'm forced to hide? 
I won't pretend that I'm 
Someone else for all time 
When will my reflection show 
Who I am inside? 
When will my reflection show 
Who I am inside?

I think that everyone can relate to this song. i think we all have something to hide. but we are scared to show it to the world because we cannot handle what may happen. shitty deal.

I want to tell my mom about all the things that have been going on.
I need medication.
I need to be happy.
I need Justin to be near me.
I need to get my nails filled.
I like to sing songs and i want to become famous.
I like Justin a whole lot more than words can explain.
I like the feeling that Justin gives me 24 hours 7 days a week.

wee i just dunno what to say. i miss myself. the last like 3 days have been rather blurry to me. Jeremiah told people he likes me, and i dont like that. he is just a good friend. he is nothing that i would ever want to date. all my friends at school have this intent to hook me up with someone. I dont want to be with anyone. i truthfully only want Justin even if i cant have him for 4 months or whatever. I told whitney yesterday that i didn't understand why people are trying to get me a boyfriend. and she was like well i dont know really why they are and i was like all i need is Justin. if anyone added up to being more than Justin i think i would die. because Justin is perfect. Whitney talked to Justin online the other night and yeah she threatened him haha. she told him if he ever hurt me that she would kill him with her baseball bat. haha violent. thats my best friend for ya. Yeah today is Tolo at school. (sadie hawkins dance) im not going. everyone is all hyped up cuz the theme is famous couples. what i dont think they understand is that.. well.. the junior class if putting it on and we are -2000$ right now. so its going to suck. too bad too bad. school is gay. i'm sick of being around  fake-fucks all the time. everyone at school is fake. the only real person i see is whitney. Man. Jeremiah wants to hang out today and watch a movie.. and yeah i dont want to. so i think im going to just tell him im not up for it. cuz truthfully im not. i have to clean my room and i dunno i have just been in thinking mode. i really really want to drop out. i want to stop everything. i just want everything to be normal again. i want to be 2 again and have my dad not leave and be gay. i want to have a normal family life. and i want to live in texas in that normal life. lol. lala otay my rambling is confusing me. ttyl. -Rei"

-Talked to Justin. He is rather awesome. One of the few people who make me smile. Too bad he's in Texas.
-Straightened my hair.
-Talking to Whitney right now.

So yesterday was kind of an odd day.  I went to a Christian Camp on Friday night. It was okay. I really wasn't planning on going. but i give into pressure easily. Julie called and was like 'Reilly you really need to go' and i was like blah fine. So i went. and there were some cute guys there. and Tara and Chelsie were there. and Heather W. and yeah it was okay. it wasn't super. but i did have a little bit of fun.  so yeah i came home at like 5 and i got online and i started talking to Justin. he is a cool guy. we talked for a long time then he was gonna take a nap and i was watching the state bball games. BLAH HORRIBLE GAMES.  yeah and i fell asleep and my phone rang at like 12:45 and it was justin so that was sweet. i was sleeping and i accidentally told him that i was going to sleep and that i had to get up for church. but i didn't have to get up for church so i called him back and talked to him till 3. and then this morning woke up to my faja calling me. He is sending money. only cuz my brother asked him and when he sends my brother money he has to send it to me also or else my brother gets kicked out hahaha. I just kinda sat all day. I'm getting sad again. Whitney just let me read her journal thingy. and yeah lets just say. it made me cry. its crazy how much best friends can think alike. like her and i both used to be so close. everything was great i was so happy. i had the best friend ever no one in the way. nothing in the way. and then stuff went downhill. for their own reasons i guess. but its crazy cuz we both see it happening. and neither of us are really doing anything to fix it. ya know? like i want to. but i dunno how. everything lately has gone to shit. i have been thinking about dropping out of HS. and i have been thinking about moving. and i have been just thinking. i think thats my problem. i think way way to much. sometimes i wish i was 2 again so that i could just reverse everything that has happened to me in my life. thats when everything went shitty. i often wonder what life would be like if my parents were still in love and still together. and if my dad wasn't gay and a drug addict. would i be different. maybe smarter. maybe a better friend. I learn from what i see. I did drugs cuz i thought it was okay. i failed at what i am capable of because i thought it was okay to do so. My father doesn't know what he does to me. no one really knows what they do to me. wether it be good or bad. its like they aren't seeing my changes in life. Blah. Im just going off into nowhere land. but fuck. im sad. i dunno if im going to go to school tomorrow. i hate going now. i feel more alone now than i ever have before. ya wanna hear the funny part about all of this. I have one friend in my school. and im losing her. One TRUE friend that is.

Was interesting.
I dunno whats really going on with me. I guess there really is a reason that i am alone. it is because i dont know what i'm doing. sometimes i think that im crazy. i have this way of doing things its rather different. I can't keep a guy around thats for sure. Gabe. Rob. Nick. Josh. Perfect guys? so i thought. i was wrong. they are all really great guys themselves and i totally understand they just weren't right for me. but truthfully i don't understand. no one really gave me more of a reason than, ""i think we should be friends."" whatever. life is shit then you die. so i might as well get over it. neways. im confused about my life. what is the point of me going to school. im not going to graduate. why not just get my GED then go off and get a job that i can work at during the day. im getting my license in 2 months or so. i waited long enough already. almost 17 1/2 and i dont even have a purpose in life. i am not driven by anything. School. the way i look at it. who needs it? then again. who doesn't need it? blah. i need to stop thinking for once in my life. im a loser. im losing my best friend. im getting lonely. i miss texas. otay bye.

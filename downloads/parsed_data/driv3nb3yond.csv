dead poetic- new meds


These are the words that tear you apart.
And these are the words that take you away.
And these are just words they'll tear you apart.
When no one here will say what needs to say.

New medicines should ease this pain.
They're the only ailment for it.

It's this air and time that's bringing me home again.
A lame attempt at playing the part again now.
In a place you don't know.
And this stance as sturdy as leaves in a storm.
The premise and motive fueling blank faces.
The fool in a place you don't know.
In this place, you don't

New medicines should ease this pain.
They're the only ailment for it. All over again.

These are the words that tore me apart.
And these are the words that'll take me away.
I'm not in the business of faking to please vain opposers.
A dead legion of new, cloned followers.
You're cornered in a place you don't know.
In this world, you don't.

New medicines should ease this pain.
They're the only ailment for it. All over again."

my chemical romance-to the end

He calls the mansion not a house but a tomb.
He's always choking from the stench and the fume.
The wedding party all collapsed in the room.
So send my resignation to the bride and the groom.
Let's go down!
This elevator only goes up to ten.
He's not around.
He's always looking at men
Down by the pool.
He doesn't have many friends.
As they are
Face down and bloated snap a shot with the lens.

If you marry me,
Would you bury me?
Would you carry me to the end?

So say goodbye to the vows you take
And say goodbye to the life you make
And say goodbye to the heart you break
And all the cyanide you drank.

She keeps a picture of the body she lends.
Got nasty blisters from the money she spends.
She's got a life of her own and it shows by the Benz
She drives at 90 by the Barbies and Kens.
If you ever say never too late. 
I'll forget all the diamonds you ate.
Lost in coma and covered in cake.
Increase the medication.
Share the vows at the wake.
(Kiss the bride)

If you marry me,
Would you bury me?
Would you carry me to the end?

So say goodbye to the vows you take
And say goodbye to the life you make
And say goodbye to the heart you break
And all the cyanide you drank.

And say goodbye to the last parade
And walk away from the choice you made 
And say goodbye to the hearts you break
And all the cyanide you drank.

So say goodbye to the vows you take
And say goodbye to the life you make
And say goodbye to the hearts you break
And all the cyanide you drank.

So say goodbye to the last parade
And walk away from the choice you made
And say goodnight to the hearts you break 
And all the cyanide you drank.

To the last parade
When the parties fade
And the choice you made
To the End."

soad- ego brain

Life is but a dream,
Drifting on a stream, a stream,
Consciously it seems,
All of what remains,
Ego brain,
Man made shame,
Shame, Love after it rains,
You see my pain is real,
Watch my world dissolve,
And pretend that none of us see the Fall,
As I turn to sand,
You took me by the hand,
And declared, that love prevails over all.
I am just a man,
Fighting other men,
For land, for land,
While I turn to sand,
In spite of the pain,
Ego brain,
Man made Shame,
Shame, Love after it rains,
You see my pain is real,
Watch my world dissolve,
And pretend that none of us see the Fall
As I turn to sand,
You took me by the hand,
And declared that love prevails over all.

Never thought you'd make me, break me

Such a brilliant star you are
And will your love keep burning baby
Burn a hole right through my eyes
All these short times feel like no time
I thought you ought to know
I'm so far gone now I been running on empty
I'm so far gone now
Do you wanna take me on?

Do, Do you, Do you know?
Do you know how long I've waited?
To look up from below,
Just to find someone like you?
And will your love light burn me baby?
Burn a hole right through my heart
I think I might just trust you, maybe
But I'm not sure
I'm not sure I wanna know

I'm so far gone now I been running on empty
I'm so far gone now
Do you wanna take me on?

Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa
I think you could make me girl
Could make me and take my life
I know you could break me girl
Take all of me
All of me, yeah hey

Wake up 
My love
Never thought you'd make me, break me
Now I'm up from below
Such a brilliant star you are"

Avenged Sevenfold- i wont see you tonite part 2.

Come back to me, this is unconceivable
Breaking apart the ones you love
Hate runs deep for what you've done to us
Left alone through suicide...suicide

I just want to die, take away my life
lay by your side, please...

Come back to me, this is unconceivable
Breaking apart the ones you love
Hate runs deep for what you've done to us
Left alone through suicide

Look at my face you pierce with a blank stare
No dream could prepare a heart for a lifeless friend.
He's gone. Nothing will take back time.
I need him back, but nothing will take back time.

I can see just fine with you in my life,
there by my side as it starts to fade
I know this can't be right, stuck in a dream
a nightmare full of sorrow

Nightmare  full of pain 

I look back and see the twisted road
Best friends and despair took its toll

Take away 

Sorrow, sank deep inside my blood
all the ones around me, I cared for
and most of all I loved
but I can't see myself that way
please don't forget me
or cry while I'm away

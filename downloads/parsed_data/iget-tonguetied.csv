I think this Christmas is going to be good. Well I suppose it already is Christmas. Merry Christmas. 

I'm in love with the following...

So it seems things may be returning to <i>the way they once were</i>. Yep, Brett, Brandon, William and Jmo are all in my basement playing pool. It's been <b>so</b> long since William's even been here. I missed him. The <u>little</u> things, you know.
<br>
I knew everything was going to be fine with Allison's court. Well we'll know for sure tomorrow, but it's looking better than we thought.

<i>I swam across 
I jumped across for you
Oh what a thing to do 
Cuz you were all <b>yellow</b>
<br>
I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh what a thing to do
And it was all <b>yellow</b></i>

Feeling <i>impulsive</i>? Even though you <b>swore</b> you'd keep resisting the urge? Well, <b>good for you</b>. Who says there being truly happy has to have anything to do with behaving yourself? <i>Let go and enjoy some attention</i>.
<br>
Will today be a good day? I certainly <i>hope</i> so. I'm worried about Allison of course, and what the outcome will be for her, but for some reason I have a feeling it won't be <b>terrible</b>. Her horoscope looked very positive today & she's got <b>the man</b> on her side, I made sure of that yesterday.
<br>
For future reference, Christmas is no longer my favorite time of the year. It's too sad. All I can think about are the fourteen years of good holiday celebrations I had with my family. It's hard to be in the Christmas spirit when I don't even feel like we should be celebrating anything. I helped pick out the tree, but the entire time I was thinking of my father. The way he <b>always</b> chose the largest tree in the lot. That's the way he lives his life - everything to the extreme. Maybe that's why I do the same. But I'm better at controlling it than my 48-year-old father, hmm. Oh well.

I feel like <b>Scrooge.</b>

To be <i>lost in the forest</i>, to be cut adrift
You've been <u>trying</u> to reach me, you bought me a book
To be lost in the forest, to be cut adrift
I've been paid, I've been paid

Don't get offended, if I <i>seem</i> absent minded
Just <b>keep telling me facts</b>, and <i>keep making me smile</i>
And don't get offended, if I seem absent minded
I get <b>tongue-tied</b>.

Baby, you've got to, <i>be more discerning</i>
<b>I've never known, what's good for me</b>
And baby, you've got to <b>be more demanding</b>
<b>I will be yours.</b>

I'll pay for you, anytime
I'll pay for you, anytime

And you told me you wanted, to <i>eat up my sadness</i>
Well <b>jump on, enjoy</b>, you can gorge away
You told me you wanted, to eat up my sadness
Jump right!

Baby, you've got to, <i>be more discerning</i>
<b>I've never known, what's good for me</b>
And baby, you've got to <b>be more demanding</b>
Jump left!

<u>What</u> are you holding out for?
What's <b>always in the way</b>?
Why so <u>damn</u> absent-minded?
Why so <b>scared</b> of <i>romance</i>?

Ah, this <b>modern love</b>
<u>breaks</u> me.
Ah, this <b>modern love</b>
<u>wastes</u> me.

<i>Do you wanna come over</i>
                  <b>And kill some time?</b>
               Throw your arms around me.

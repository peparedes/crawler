"event","It is October 13th and no it's not a Friday, it's a Monday&nbsp; but if we are going by my work schedule, Monday is the new Friday so it is in fact Friday the 13th which explains the kookiness that has happened today at work. In actuality today is like every other day here at Cascade Park but I think more than anything I have been affected by this pseudo Friday the 13th, so bare with me. It is my opinion that the little things in life make up the bulk of life. The randomness is what makes the world go round and to me holds some sort of magic undiscovered by scientists because they have made a formula for randomness and dismissed it. Here are the little things that make me smile. 
Today we had some very vocal kids, they weren't screaming or crying, laughing or singing, they were just making noises for their own amusement. The funny thing was that it was contagious. I started to imitate their sounds and soon others followed. I know why I did it, I like to make weird sounds for my own amusement and so to join another kids strange warblings put a smile on my face and made the minutes role by. Why my fellow workers were also making these sounds I could not say but it equally amused me, unexpected for sure. The power of a pseudo Friday the 13th is that people don't realize what is making them act so strange. 
Later on in the day I overheard a woman checking out books on CD and she felt it was necessary to comment that she can in fact read but simply does not have the time. I am glad she explained this because I was thinking to myself, &quot;how horrible it must have been to be illiterate before they created audio books, or better yet I was surely thinking: Egash! What a simpleton! Leave me be, I am much too busy and have no time for you!&quot;&nbsp; There is always a compulsion to explain yourself, in fear of being judged I suppose, but I thought those things even after she said that, because now I am suspicious and think she only said that to cover the fact that she cannot read! 
Then today there were the book titles I read that took a different direction completely. A how to on turning your children out to be respectable kids I inferred as a how to on turning your children out onto the streets because what with this economy, extra baggage like kids are such an easy expense to be had of. Oh no! Now that I have said it others are going to steal my idea, right their own books and make millions off of it, like usual. Damn and blast!
I swear if it weren't for the little things at work, I would simply die of boredom. Yes I am still counting down the minutes till I get off work and can begin my weekend that happens to be in the middle of the week but I have at least almost barely have made it through the day. I wish sometimes that people could tune into my brain to see what I am thinking or to see what I see, but then that gets a tad creepy and very 1984 and I don't wish that anymore. Oh yes, I know the consequences of my wishes. And with that said, I complete yet another non-sequitur by yours truly. Aren't you so glad I did?"

"event","Last night I had an experience like none other. I&nbsp;have been a fan of Sigur Ros for a few years now and it wasn't until last night that I&nbsp;finally got to see them live. I&nbsp;have heard them in movies, I&nbsp;have their albums and have watched their documentary but not until I&nbsp;was there in person have I&nbsp;felt the raw power that is Sigur Ros. The only word that comes to mind is genius and yet that doesn't even begin to describe the concert. They are so creative and so smart and have such a great understanding of our senses that I&nbsp;am in awe of them and extremely envious. They could have just gone up on stage and played their instruments and sung their songs and it would have been fantastic but instead they blew my mind, our minds, they put on a fucking extraordinary show. A feast for your eyes and ears. The concert started off simply with harsh green lights backing Jonsi which projected these gigantic monster versions of himself playing his guitar with a cello bow which creates this beautiful and distinct sound that mesmerizes you. I&nbsp;was taken back to when I&nbsp;was a kid and you see strange shadows on the walls of tree branches silhouetted in the moonlight but your imagination takes over, makes you think you were seeing something scary when really it was something quit ordinary. You see this shadow and it's this monster and he has two arms but one reaches long and it strokes something but you cant grasp what but then you turn to the stage and Jonsi is beautifully playing his guitar. But this is only the beginning, the way they lit the screens and giant balloons that pulsed with light played so in sync with their sound that it became one cohesive experience that delighted the senses. You could hear light and see sound. Then there were videos that ranged from them playing their instruments both in black and white and a super psychedelic color fest to these hypnotic and haunting videos of children's faces and at one point it felt like I&nbsp;was trapped in a lake full of sea grass with hands groping outward trying desperately to get through the grass or at least to see beyond. All of this of course enhances the music you are hearing. They take you on a journey and it is an emotional journey. They play melodic music that lulls you into a trance and slowly they build you up until you think you are going to burst, but they don't release you they lull you back into that trance and slowly build again in a teasing fashion and when you can't bear it anymore they let loose with a sound that is so raw and powerful that it takes your body and mind and you are the music it fills you entirely and you never want to part it. Towards the end of the show they get the crowd to clap along at a feverish pace which makes you want to dance and sing and in the moment of it all they released confetti onto the crowd and the theater became one giant snow globe. It was truly a spectacular night and I really wish it didn't have to end. My soul was aglow and life was beautiful as if I put on rose colored glasses and now that it is the next day I&nbsp;hunger for that experience again, an itch I&nbsp;so badly want to scratch. I&nbsp;want to hear light and see sound, I&nbsp;want to experience Sigur Ros.&nbsp;"

"event","So I was stumbling along and I found this ""invention"" that is so right and so perfect for Cascade Park Library, I am sad it wasn't available 10 years ago. It is a revolving kitchen. For those who have not had the privilege to check out the Cascade Park Library, let me fill you in; it is a very small library, only approximately 2500 sq ft, and it is roundish. I say roundish because there are bulging sections for our round shelves. Oh yes, round shelves for square books. This place is so tiny our kitchen is practically the size of a airplane's john and our break room is the pathway to get to the kitchen from the work room. Anyways, so I found a round kitchen and instantly I thought of work. It would have fit so perfectly. So sad now that we are getting the new library we wont have a need for this. But I feel we should put it in our new library just so we can keep a bit of the old Cascade Park with the new.

"event","I am curious as to when libraries transformed from sanctuaries to asylums. But then again it feels like the whole world has changed in this fashion. There is something sorely missing in life and it's a simple thing. Respect. For goodness sakes, there is a song all about R-E-S-P-E-C-T, but it seems like nobody knows what I'm talking about. As a kid I was taught that you should be quite and respectful of other peoples space, to whisper, to sit quietly and read. It wasn't boring, it was quite the opposite. The library for me always had this magical quality to it, with a spark of imagination there were so many places a library could take you. Wander over to the 398s and you are whisked away to castles and dragons and curses that could only be lifted with a kiss. Skip on over to the 500s and you were rocketing into space where it so happens a T-Rex lives on Mars (little known fact) or you could dive down in a submarine and experience the ultimate light show with <span class=""me"">bizarre</span> fish full of photophores' and bioluminescence. Today though, kids read either because their parents/teachers make them or because they are getting prizes for it. Unfortunately there is the ever present allure of the internet, computers and toys. When I suggest the idea of picking out a book to sit down and read, the kids look at me like I am mad. Instead they run around, bang around and scream at the top of their lungs and it appears this is the normal behavior of kids. It is a rarity that parents try and quiet their children or even discipline their children for fear they will scar their fragile minds. But really I cannot blame the children because frankly they don't know better. They have learned this was acceptable from their parents whom disregard all rules of conduct. Their cell phones ringing so far off the hook we made hooks obsolete. They fight and scramble for precious internet time and desperately try and get more. They too scream and put up a fuss they don't get what they want and most of all they have no concept of an inside voice. On a side note, people no longer have any patience as well. I actually had people walk out on me today because I didn't get to them fast enough. But what could I do, I was the only person around and I was busy helping a patron. They had to wait a whole of five minutes, but they couldn't. They were far too busy, could not be bothered to waste such precious precious time. It ties back to respect. They could have seen I was busy and have the respect to wait, but no. Everyone is far to busy and important to have respect and it is a word that has become meaningless.&nbsp;"

I do doubt this a little bit because Disney only rated as 23% evil and Microsoft garnered a 50/50 rating...."

"event","Okay, random thought here. 

Asian food, while I do love it, is not something that I can eat every day. Unfortunately since I now work at <A HREF=""http://www.cameronmitchell.com/restaurants/restaurantinformation/index.cfm?rid=18"">Molly Woo's Asian Bistro</A> I've gotten all of the Asian food that I can stand for a while. It's good food, don't get me wrong, but how many different ways can you use 'Garlic sauce' and 'Brown sauce' in a dish?

On the bright side, the banana spring rolls kick ass."

Jim, why did I think that this was gonna be a good idea? I mean, who the hell cares about my life. Apart from a few funny moments at work (and restaurants make more than a few funny moments in a day), there's nothing remotely interesting about me.

Oh well, at least I got the damned thing running."

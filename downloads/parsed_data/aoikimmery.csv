"event","Another one of those waking moments, yet again I am surprised by stillness. Suspended, in the center of a teeter totter. &nbsp;Well - almost center. &nbsp;I&#39;m a few weeks ahead still, in the warm arms of the longest night. &nbsp;Janus smiling, although I can&#39;t tell which face he&#39;s showing me. &nbsp;And it doesn&#39;t matter.

I&#39;ve never been more acutely aware of time. &nbsp;Of its infiniteness, its elusive illusion. &nbsp;Relentlessly restless, restlessly relentless. I&#39;ve never had a better understanding of forever.

"event","Hello World. It&#39;s been awhile.

Amid this never-ending quest to uncover my own truth, I have decided to do the opposite of what my saner friends have done. Instead of privatizing or taking this journal offline, I&#39;m making everything public.

When I left LJ land five years ago, it was because I felt I could no longer afford desperate cries of help. I decided I had to be tough; to bottle every unwelcome emotion until I could use them in a song. I saw the whirlwind of pain I had created by speaking my feelings, and I resolved to be more responsible. In a storm of double kick and power chord chugs, I could play the priestess, fierce but untouchable as a statue.

And it worked beautifully, for five years. Until it didn&#39;t.

So when everything else in the world is shifting and flickering inconsistent, I return to the first obvious instinct of my past self: Words. More and more words.

<i>And the heart is hard to translate
It has a language of its own
It talks in tongues and quiet sighs,
And prayers and proclamations
In the grand days of great men and the smallest of gestures
And short shallow gasps

But with all my education I can&rsquo;t seem to command it
And the words are all escaping, and coming back all damaged
And I would put them back in poetry if I only knew how
I can&rsquo;t seem to understand it

And I would give all this and heaven too
I would give it all if only for a moment
That I could just understand the meaning of the word you see
&lsquo;Cause I&rsquo;ve been scrawling it forever but it never makes sense to me at all</i>

It&#39;s the only chance I&#39;ve got at proving I existed in a universe of ephemera.

---

I have to call Ruth. I have to. It&#39;s scary and I don&#39;t want to do it, but I have to.

Drew believes it&#39;s too late to salvage anything. That may be true. &nbsp;But if there&#39;s any small chance that something I do can change that, I have to try.

The main mistake I&#39;ve made was letting Ruth&#39;s misunderstanding of me grow through distance. &nbsp;I had resolved to stop mincing words with her and try to let my actions speak for my beliefs. &nbsp;But then she stopped seeing my actions, because of physical distance, and then what little could be seen was distorted through the lens of Mariana&#39;s pain.

And so, just as I decide to put all my energy towards living honestly and without suspicion, she became more skeptical. &nbsp;Two trains, heading in opposite directions, barely missing each other. &nbsp;As always.

Somewhere, between March and August, Ruth stopped seeing me as a person and started seeing me as some confused force of evil.

Well, I am certainly confused. &nbsp;I do not have life figured out. &nbsp;Every time I think I&#39;m on to some secret epiphany that will explain everything, life throws me another curve ball. &nbsp;It&#39;s horrible and at times like right now it hurts like hell - but each time, I get a little closer to &quot;me&quot;.

I am confused - yes, definitely. But I am not evil.

I don&#39;t believe anyone is evil. &nbsp;I believe all people have the intention to love and be loved, deep down in the centre of our souls. &nbsp;We trip up because existence continues to become more and more complicated, and as a result it becomes more and more difficult to communicate our true intentions.

So that&#39;s why we have to sing. &nbsp;Because music and voice can transcend the limitations of language.

That&#39;s where I should have began, way back when I first moved here and Ruth asked me what I believe. &nbsp;Because that&#39;s it. &nbsp; That&#39;s truly, truly what I believe, with every fibre of my being. &nbsp;It&#39;s not more complicated than that.

I was just afraid. &nbsp;I was afraid of how strong my feelings of certainty were about Drew, and I was afraid of religious practices I didn&#39;t understand. &nbsp;But I believed so strongly that Drew was the person I&#39;m supposed to carry out this &quot;mission&quot; with, that I buried that fear rather than facing it.

And later, I became so worried that I was inadvertently manipulating Drew that I compromised on values I wouldn&#39;t have compromised before. &nbsp;Things I didn&#39;t want him to be caught up in, things that I knew he didn&#39;t want to be caught up in, but I couldn&#39;t speak up - because I didn&#39;t want to come off as judgemental or controlling.

I feel embarrassed that Levi saw my mental breakdown this past weekend, when Drew told me that Mariana thought I&#39;d brainwashed him into thinking Mexican food was bland. &nbsp;I know - a completely absurd catalyst.

But God - that hurts. After all I&#39;d tried to do to help her, to make room for her in my life. &nbsp;Giving her books and teaching her about business; including her in everything the band did. &nbsp;I brought her to Windsor, after three very difficult weeks of trying to explain to my parents how I was okay with Drew having a girlfriend, and why they should allow her to sleep at their house - why she was there at all.

Because I wanted all of us to be one family. &nbsp;I wanted her to get free creatively so she could sing and play violin in the band.

And now that I see she was just pretending to be my friend, trying to wait me out until I disappeared and Drew could be her Prince Charming again, I feel immaculately stupid.

But! At the same time - there is a sense of peace. &nbsp;Of happiness, even though I&#39;ve cried more this past year than I think I&#39;ve creid my entire life previously. &nbsp;And that peace is because I have zero regrets - because the whole time, I&#39;ve been listening to my heart.

So the place I&#39;m at now is this: &nbsp;I feel grateful for everything that has happened this past year, because it&#39;s taught me more about the person I want to be, and the way I want to live.

I still love Drew, infinitely, beyond all comprehension. &nbsp;I still feel my best possible future includes him. &nbsp;I think we can achieve more together than we can separately, in the mission of teaching the world to sing. &nbsp;If someday I think having kids would be more rewarding than my music and teaching career, I have a hard time envisioning anyone I&#39;d rather choose as the father of my children.

But in that vision of the best possible future, he&#39;s also chosen to be there with me. &nbsp;And it also includes our families, celebrating and mourning all of life&#39;s intricacies together. &nbsp;In the cul-de-sac.

So if that future has no chance of happening, I will let this go. &nbsp;I said when I first came here that I would give it a year, and now I have. &nbsp;So if the best thing for me to do is go, I will go. &nbsp;And we will all survive.

This is the best shot I&#39;ve got at speaking truth.

So I&#39;ll try. One last time."

"event","When I last wrote about my musical identity, I was at a crossroads in my practice.  I had too many interests and not enough direction.  More than anything, I was afraid of making sacrifices and choosing the wrong path.  However reluctantly, I began to realize that dedication is a prerequisite of success, and that dedication may require sacrifices.  The past year has been filled with difficult decisions, but they&#8217;ve helped me to improve my focus and find a new sense of purpose in my musical activities.

	Currently, the centre of my musical practice is with Perpetuate, the heavy metal band that grew out of the poster I answered in October 2009.  In just short of a year and a half, the five of us have gone from being strangers to practicing 3-4 hours a week, playing shows every three weeks or so, writing and recording a original album, signing an international distribution deal, and achieving very modest radio play on some local stations.  The self-titled CD will be released April 1st, then we will be putting together a mini-tour through Chatham, Kitchener-Waterloo, and Hamilton in May.  Two years ago, I wouldn&#8217;t have even been able to imagine all the things that have happened.

	The first aspect of my identity as a musician is now as a part of a five-piece whole; as a singer, keyboard player, and lyricist.  The next is as a composer and arranger.  Dr. Robert Rival&#8217;s voice-leading class gave me more confidence in my knowledge and empowered me to a higher level of writing.  I was able to put these skills to use in Sun Salutation and a full-orchestra arrangement on a Perpetuate song for the album.  Beyond graduation, I would like to pursue opportunities writing VST orchestrations for local bands; the feedback from &#8220;Medusa&#8221; has revealed a demand for string arrangements I didn&#8217;t know existed.  I haven&#8217;t yet abandoned the dream of composing for film, and more orchestration practice is a practical step in that direction.

	The most difficult choice I&#8217;ve had to make was giving up classical voice lessons, to the enormous disappointment of my teacher; but I had to be honest with myself.  Going further with my technique would require a level of commitment I wasn&#8217;t prepared to give, and while I will always love opera and classical music, I knew a career in the classical realm wasn&#8217;t really what I wanted.   Instead I want to hone my instrument with alternative methods, to open myself to new colours and extended techniques while working towards the goal of precise physiological mastery of my voice.  After attending a workshop with Estill Voice International I&#8217;ve been thinking about vocal technique from a more scientific, anatomical basis, rather than in the lofty metaphorical language of bel canto.  I will be taking a full course this summer in Quebec and hope to integrate Estill&#8217;s approach with my own teaching method.  I&#8217;ve found a lot of satisfaction coaching a few private students and the Perpetuate guys for back-up vocals and I would like to continue teaching on the side no matter where the future leads.  

	Now when I look forward, I see possibility rather than uncertainty.  I once felt pressured to go to graduate school, but for the moment I feel happier to wait.  Working with concert promoters, booking agents, the musicians' union, and media outlets piqued my interest in the music business, so I&#8217;ve decided to stay in Windsor until December to complete the Arts Management Certificate.  While the outlook for Perpetuate is good, I&#8217;m going to keep giving all my energy to the band.  The realist in me knows that even if we get a lucky &#8220;break&#8221;, heavy metal isn&#8217;t something I&#8217;ll be able to do forever.  I can work, perform, write, and teach for now, then go to school later when the time is right.  Depending on how my interests evolve over the next few years, that may be for composition, vocal pedagogy, or intellectual property law.  Or I may never go back to school.  Whatever happens, I can be content with the skills I&#8217;ve learned here, because I will always use them; whether I&#8217;m touring in Europe or playing open mic nights or teaching my child to play the piano."

"event","Time for another Confession: I'm beginning to feel trapped.  I know it's silly, I know I'm paranoid.  But all these future musings have my heels itching, partly in defiance and partly in fear, because this time I can't just jump ship.  I've given you too much of my time and I'd have no idea how to get it back.  I had braced myself against this. I knew all the warning signs, yet I allowed myself to tell me otherwise, believing.  Now I'm not so sure.  Yes, I'm in love, unquestionably - but the object is no longer clear to me.  When it all comes down, how long will this last?  Another year or two or five or twenty?  And when it ends, what then?  Will you still look at me with the same expression of pride and certainty, and will I look at my feet half-heartedly, wondering where the time went?

I try not to panic, but your arms are starting to look more like baricades, too thin and futily groping at the wind.

"event","This is the seventh year that I've done this survey.  Traditions are good to have.

<b>1. What did you do in 2010 that you'd never done before?</b> Turned 21, kissed someone with a lip ring, kissed a girl, performed as Perpetuate, played tic-tac-toe with strangers online via webcam, got a backbone, recorded in a studio, worked 9-5 for the man, taught a high school class (while supervised, of course), made an actual enemy, gave a campus tour, brought a boyfriend to Thanksgiving dinner with my extended family, wrote a piece for full orchestra.

<b>2. Did you keep your new year's resolutions, and will you make more for next year?</b> I don't remember making any conscious resolutions last year, though I planned on a bunch.  They worked out okay, if unintentionally.  This year, I want to save money, eat slightly healthier, keep up with Aikido the whole year, and play a Perpetuate show outside of Windsor.

<b>3. Did anyone close to you give birth?</b> Not that I know of.

<b>4. Did anyone close to you die?</b> Not that I recall.

<b>5. What countries did you visit?</b> Canada, and the States.

<b>6. What would you like to have in 2011 that you lacked in 2010?</b> A CD!  That's 100% going to happen.  Some more lofty things: a new keyboard and a little more self-confidence.

<b>7. What dates from 2010 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?</b> All the dates we played shows, because they've been few and exciting enough that I remember them all: April 23rd and 30th, June 26th, August 14th, Sept 18th and 21st, October 1st and 29th, and November 26th.  July 11th, when we went to Rack and Roll.  August 2nd, when Jamie threw up in my bathroom.

<b>8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?</b> Hands down, the orchestra piece.  It's premiering January 16th. Also, getting my GPA back to 11 (11.07, in fact).

<b>9. What was your biggest failure?</b> Aikido.  I was supposed to be training for my shodan this year so I'd be ready to test in May 2011, but I got swept away by school, lethargy, red heads, and heavy metal.

<b>10. Did you suffer illness or injury?</b> I've been very healthy all year.

<b>11. What was the best thing you bought?</b> Damper pedal; don't know why I didn't own one before.  Also my travel loose tea mug, which literally saves me ten minutes every morning.

<b>12. Whose behavior merited celebration?</b> Ben, for finishing high school, choosing a major which will lead to a practical career, and just being a really cool bro.  

<b>13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?</b> Reid, for a while in the first half of the year before we stopped talking.  Everything's cool now, though.

<b>14. Where did most of your money go?</b> McDonald's and Sam's.  It's okay though, because they're always there for me.

<b>15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?</b> Perpetuate milestones: playing shows, recording, getting the t-shirts printed.  We've come a long way in a year, my friends.

<b>16. What songs will always remind you of 2010?</b> I didn't buy too many current albums this year.  The Final Frontier, in August; mostly loved.  Most recently I bought Trapt's new one (which I am on the cover of, no joke), so I could say any of those.  The Trooper, 'cause it's been our go-to cover song all year.  Also the ""Backing Up"" song that the Gregory Brothers autotuned.  That's kind of lame, isn't it?

<b>17. Compared to this time last year, are you happier or sadder?</b> Unbelievably happier.

<b>18. What do you wish you'd done more of?</b> Spending time with friends.

<b>19. What do you wish you'd done less of?</b> Stressing out about everything in general.

<b>20. How will you be spending Christmas?</b> My mom's side of the family in a few hours for Christmas Eve.  Christmas Day we'll do here, then go to my dad's sister's house.  Usual gameplan.

<b>21. How will you be spending New Years?</b> NOT WORKING, for the first time since 2003.  Seriously; my 2004 version of this survey doesn't lie.  Therefore, I will be tearing shit up this year.  Dinner party with Sinan and friends, then I'm going to see if I can wiggle my way to the Manchester to see Skuza's piano/sax cover band play a bit.

<b>22. Did you fall in love in 2010?</b> Unexpectedly.  

<b>23. How many one-night stands?</b> I think perhaps one.  But I totally got jipped so I don't want to count it.

<b>24. What was your favorite TV program?</b> Dollhouse; I caught up when the DVD of season 1 came out.  I've recently been rewatching it one episode a day while I run on the elliptical, because Eliza Dushku's body motivates me.

<b>25. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year?</b> Sort of.  Maybe more like cold indifference, to one ex-drummer, for obvious reasons.

<b>26. What was the best book you read?</b> I didn't finish I single novel this year.  Started a bunch.  Right now I'm reading ""You Suck: A Love Story"", that Ben lent to me; it's pretty cute.

<b>27. What was your greatest musical discovery?</b> This year, I <i>actually</i> got into metal.  What I thought I knew before, I knew nothing.  Jamie, Chris, Mike, and even Dez (for the month that I was talking to him) introduced me to a lot of really cool, really great bands.  I learned the difference between metal and hardcore.  I learned that odd meters are best felt through melodic accents instead of memorizing strong-weak patterns, and I learned a ton about improvising in a group through jamming to kill time in band practice.  In school, I learned a lot about accomplishing musical effect in modern settings, writing idiomatically, and voicing gestures throughout an orchestra.  I also learned a fair bit about the values of Baroque music, on the days when I managed to get to class, and a lot about vocal health, from the Estill workshop and from watching the class I did labwork in.  I didn't learn much about teaching voice from my voice tech class, but I did learn a lot about teaching musicality, which is perhaps more important.

<b>28. What did you want and got?</b> Respect.  Not supreme, immaculate respect yet, but pretty good so far.  Enough that any more might be weird. 

<b>29. What did you want and didn't get?</b> I really don't know.  Nothing.  Perhaps the lead role in this feature I'm doing now, because she's a lounge singer and it would have been fun to sing.  But I get to play this awesome, badass thief/sex goddess, so that's not even a loss.

<b>30. What was your favorite film of this year?</b> I saw significantly fewer movies this year, unsurprisingly.  I might say Inception was my favourite; plus the company was excellent.  Also the Social Network, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, and Kick Ass.

<b>31. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?</b> I turned 21.  On the day of my birthday - it was a Thursday - we went to Red Lobster and I opened gifts there; mostly CDs and DVDs, which were cool.  The next day we (my brothers, a bunch of the Nerds, a few people from school, Jamie, Jared, and Jared's friend whose name I don't remember, Kory and Karl, and a few people I may have forgotten) went to XS for laser tag and DDR.  We went to Joe Schmoe's after for some drinks, where I got moderately drunk and Kory inappropriately psychoanlayzed people.  Bad Kory.

<b>32. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?</b> If I could have eliminated some of the stress I unnecessarily put on myself.  And kept up with Aikido.  I think the two are probably related.  Most definitely.

<b>33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2010?</b> The same, except I stopped wearing all jewellery when my watch stopped.  I thought about ordering a new watch piece, but I started to like asking people for the time.  Also off-the-shoulder tops, which my mom hates, but I love.  It's a way to show more skin without strangers calling me a slut, although my mom still does.

<b>34. What kept you sane?</b> The music lounge, shouting/singing to the max in the car along to Bjork, and cuddling.

<b>35. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most?</b> Really, like none.  Ryan Reynolds is still super hot, but I didn't see him in anything that really excited me this year.

<b>36. What political issue stirred you the most?</b> Bed Intruders, fo sho.  He's climbin' in your windows; he's snatchin' your people up.

<b>37. Who did you miss?</b> Jaimie fucking Christmas.  :'(

<b>38. Who was the best new person you met?</b> I've been introduced to pretty much the entire Windsor music scene this year.  That's a ridiculous number of people.  Jamie has some pretty cool friends, especially Dusty, Jayden, Andrew, and Jeremy; but not Mike Muzyka, because he's not a bro. Mike the drummer is very good at drums and also at listening (and picking up chicks). We should basically make Mike Faul an honorary member of the band.  

<b>39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2010:</b> The distance between greatness and getting by isn't nearly as far as I thought.  It's just stepping out of your room.  It's answering a poster ad, it's going to a long-shot job interview, it's taking a chance and saying yes when the easiest or most obvious answer is no.  I have the kanji for <i>ko do</i> framed on my desk right beside me, and it's been there for more than three years, but I never really understood it until now.  You can let things happen to you or you can make them happen.  And from what I've seen, the things you make happen are infinitely better; or, at the very least, more interesting. 

<b>40. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year:</b>
<i>So the time is right
So tell me if you wanna?
You should change it if you're gonna
But I don't really know how
I've already tried
Involve

I don't want to save my soul now
I don't want to lose control
And even if it takes a lifetime to learn, I'll learn

Don't fall in line
If you're thinking that you're gonna
You should maybe think about a reason in your own mind
You've already gone
Evolve

I don't wanna save my soul now
I just wanna lose control
And even if it takes a lifetime to learn, I'll learn
We learn</i>"

"event","Thanks a lot, Devin - because of you I've spent the last hour digging into grade nine.

For me it goes further than nostalgia.  I legitimately think things <i>mattered</i> a lot more back then.  Definitely in the grand scheme of my life, it has.  The person I am now I became largely due to all our silly problems and processes. 

But even at the time, we had an acute awareness of time.  That THIS NOW would greatly affect everything that came hereafter, and that by extension, THIS NOW was monumental.

That knowledge was valuable at the time, because it meant that we sucked all the life we could get out of every moment.  It was also a burden, because every experience was under close and constant supervision.  And because it made the low points seem so fucking low.

It's convenient for us, because we lived those moments in words; on paper and wherever the hell this abstraction is.  It's convenient for archiving and assessment.  Or inconvenient - depending on whether you view compulsive self-reflection as a convenience or not. 

I stand in the middle of a teeter-totter.  Maybe what I miss isn't the connections or the good times; maybe it's just the <i>nowness</i>.  As of late, 90% of my thoughts are occupied by the impending future: looming deadlines, showdates, career decisions (romantic decisions?), all the things I need to accomplish in order to feel accomplished.  The other 10% is stuck in high school, still trying to figure myself out.  I tend not even to notice the now until it's passed the threshold into the past.

That's a big part of what I like about Jamie.  Sadly, it has very little to do with him, but what can I say.  He reminds me to slow down; to go get lunch, to go to bed early, to lie around and do absolutely nothing.  Somehow, without me really noticing, the times when I'm accomplishing absolutely nothing became the only times I really feel happy, or really feel anything other than stressed.  Inarguably I can say there would be a lot fewer of those times if it weren't for Jamie.

Gosh, is that ever depressing.  I'd like to say it sounds worse than it is, but it'd be a lie.

A couple days back I thought about cutting for the first time in a long time.  I was having a particularly difficult day, and while I was looking at my reflection in the mirror, I had a sudden wave of memory.  It seems so far away now, and flashing back to those feelings felt like an out-of-body experience.  I remember the ache I would feel in my solar plexus, and the warmth that flooded my body as would it disappear.  I remember the smell and the seemingly deafening sound of my heart beat, but it feels like someone else.  And rather than being a comfort - that I'm come so far past that - it scared me.

I don't remember the last time I cut.  It was very, very long ago.  It bothers me that I can't remember.  I didn't exactly write anything anywhere saying ""Today I cut myself for the very last time.""  

Briefly I considered relapsing, but I won't.  That may not sound convincing, but it's that simple.  There are lots of really important reasons that cutting is a horrible idea, but none of them matter.  I just won't.

I worry about the evolution of my identity, and what darkness could possibly come next, given this current shade."

Oh, I can paint a symphony, but...I wonder if I've chosen the right path, and if I am still stubborn enough to follow through.  I certainly hope so, lest curiosity and impatience get the best of me and ruin the two best things that have ever happened to me.  It could be quite the hellfire.

2. The ultimate irony, which would leave a certain pure soul damaged beyond repair, a trickster pleased but appalled, and a lost soul laughing with bitter satisfaction.  I daren't speak it or even write it; the shame would be immobilizing.

3. Childish and infuriating.  But in spite my disdain I find myself wanting to see you again, or at least some small signs of life.  I'm ready to be friends.  Correction:  I have no desire to be friends.  What I want is to see on your face that I was right, that time has been true to my words.  You will regret, and I will not yield.  Perhaps someday I'll have some sympathy for you, but for now I believe I'm entitled to some epicaricacy.  Four years worth, at least.

4. Is it happening again?  Am I falling into the same pattern?  You seem so confident and bold, maybe it's candor.  Or maybe you don't need me at all.  In lucid moments I see that you don't, not at all, and it is my heart in your teeth.  If I told you this you would laugh and hug me closer to you, ridiculing; but I know that it's true.  I've been here before and I don't like it, yet I can't seem to stop.  I'm starving, selfish.  I'm at your mercy, simply, completely.  Never before have I had this much to lose."

"event","I suppose some archiving is in order.  Just for fun, let's rewind.

Last two hours were spent practicing keyboard.  Learned that I don't have the chops to play the stuff Phil told me to look at for the Milkmen.  I have a jazz vocab of nil.  I had to send him a really pathetic email, apologizing for getting his hopes up.  I'll stick to singing.

Before that Calvin was over, to go through the setlist for Doomsday.  Jamie was working an afternoon shift, and Chris worked a midnight shift and was therefore sleeping.  Jared is out of town, again.  We did okay, though.  We played along to the guitar pros and I coached him through the new break in Medusa.  He's good with everything except Medusa, but he can get it in time for the show.  I think the show being on a Saturday the 14th is a good omen.  I was born on a Saturday the 14th.

Before that I was working at the museum; by choice, because we worked out a deal where I wouldn't have to work Saturdays.  I went in today because I had too much stuff to do.  I thought that scanning photos all day wouldn't really feel like work, but it got old pretty fast.  I think I'm past the halfway point, but I'm not sure.

Before that, I had extreme difficulty waking up at 8am, as I had only arrived home from Jamie's circa 4am.  He conned me into going to a CS party across town.  The instant I walked in and saw the split screens, it was like stepping back in time.  Granted, now it's Halo 3.  I ran around with my gun pointed at the sky for a few minutes before handing back the controller in shame.  We switched to Rock Band shortly after, thank god, at Jamie's suggestion.  I raised my eyebrows at that, because I distinctly remember him swearing never to play Rock Band again, after the Caesar's tournament fiasco.  He's got my back.

Before that, I made an appearance at Kory's birthday luau.  It was buggy and a bit chilly to be outside, and I felt more than a little awkward, since I hadn't seen most of those guys in three to five months; but it was a good time.  I would have stayed longer if I hadn't accidentally fallen asleep beforehand and showed up late, and if I didn't have all those photos to scan in the morning.  So if Kory is reading this right now, he shouldn't think that I ditched early to hang out with Jamie and his friends.  Although that's what I did.  Whatever; what is LJ if naught for cleansing the soul?  Yeah, I ditched early to hang out with Jamie and his friends.  What do you want.

Before that, I went out for dinner with my dad after work.  At work I had a meeting with Chris and Ray at the Federation office.  I like those guys a lot; they have a way of making me feel really competent, even when I'm not.  Spent the rest of the time scanning photos and making phone calls, as usual.

Before that, Jamie and I broke the news to Jared and Chris after practice.  Well, Jamie did most of the breaking; I just kind of stood there trying to hide my smile while Jared fist pounded Jamie and asked how he met this new girlfriend of his.  ""Through a flyer,"" Jamie said.  I don't think Jared understood until I started laughing.  Chris was packing up at the time, but he poked his head back in to say congratulations.  Seeing their reactions, it felt silly to have been so nervous.  The appropriate Facebook adjustments were made that evening.  Facebook has a sneaky algorithm that picked a photo both of us are tagged in; it happens to be from our first show, which is both cute and humiliating.  Sinan took it, which is a large irony.

Before that, work and what-not.  A guy came in and donated a zillion photos of old bands.  They're really cool, but there's way too many of them. I burned the afternoon in Leddy archives, taking notes and photos for the exhibit and just of cool stuff.  I'm hunting for programs with Mr. Overton's name on them, so I can show him at his retirement party next year.  Found two so far, from '78-79.  It was a nice day, and I spent most of my commute literally skipping as I walked, along to my iPod.  I would have sung if I thought it would draw fewer suspicious glances.

Before that, I struggled to stay awake while scanning photos and writing emails at work, until Jamie and I went to meet with Dan Bombadier at Print House on my lunch break to work out a deal for Perpetuate t-shirts.  He had an awesome cat in his office and seemed to like our design.  Seems like a lot of money to be spending all at once, but with any luck it'll pay off.  Got lunch at Burger King 'cause I was sick of sandwiches.

Before that, I drove home bleary-eyed on the express way at 3am, from Jamie's.  We saw Inception, which was perfect.  He had gotten in from London an hour or so before that.

Before that, I went out for dinner with my mom after work.  Work was more meetings and scanning photographs.  I had lunch with Jaimie and we did some minor catching up; I miss her.  The morning I spent in Studio A helping to train the 401 Sunset crew.  By ""helping"", I mean I sang duets with Dr. Lewis and played piano for their screen tests.

Before that, I talked to Nick Beno online, thanking him with uncertain certainty.  I awkwardly conversed with Kory, after we'd had dinner together; it was his birthday the next day, and I had forgotten and asked him to dinner solely on a whim.  Perhaps it's in my head, but the instant we talk in person, I see the wheels in his head turning as logic unwinds and a seed of renewed determination begins to grow.  I feel like a jerk to have to crush it once again, and he responds with a quiet outrage, especially since I won't tell him who.

Before that, I nearly lost it at work, feeling lost and over my head.  I called Ray and he helped me feel a bit better; then had a meeting with pianist Kenny Crone; he's an interested character, and Chris along came to talk shop.  I went to the U to meet the 401 Sunset crew and sit in on training a bit.

Before that, Jamie threw up in my bathroom at 2am and I could no longer contain my emotions, so I told him everything.  I felt his hands, alarmingly cold through the fingerless gloves I wore on mine, and felt a wave of calm pass over me as we smiled and talked mechanics past 5am.

And so begins the backwards saga of this next chapter.  My fourth-grade self would be proud."

When we got there, Jared wasn't awake, so Nick broke into his house through the band room window and let us in.  It was the highlight of my day.  That's a lie.  Today has already had a lot of highlights.  Playing through Medusa and having it work somewhat.  Universal sustain pedal helping everything I do sound better.  The Trooper being fucking amazing.  Jamie telling us that Andrew asked us to play a show with them next month.  Mostly that last bit; that's excellent.  It would be so sweet to be opening for Sledgehammer on a regular basis.  

I'm jittering, I am so excited and nervous right now.  This could be the start of something great.

"event","I suppose I could be going over my history notes, or practicing some figured bass harmonizing, or typing notes for my percussion journal, or something else exam-related, seeing as we're going into exams this week.  But, I decided this morning that after the wonderful chaos of this weekend, I would reward myself with an evening of vegging out.  I admit I hoped that vegging out would entail something more interesting than sitting in front of my computer refreshing Facebook while I dig out dried blood from underneath my thumbnail with a needle; but this is what I've got, so I'll take it.

This weekend has been pretty much non-stop since Friday afternoon, when I went to the casino buffet with a bunch of people from the school of music for lunch.  In fact, until dinner tonight, I hadn't eaten a full meal since that one.  The food was okay.  I'm sure it was good at one point in time, but buffets are buffets and heat lamps are heat lamps.  The company was terrific, though.  Five-star company.

We had an amazing band practice/jam on Friday.  I think we've been individually panicking about the show on the 23rd.  I know I have.  So when we came together, this manifested as productivity to the max.  Straightened out our set list, talked specifics, jammed through some potential covers.  When I looked at my watch, it was 8:30.  We'd started at three.  So we went to McDonald's for a snack and wound up sitting there until past ten, discussing philosophy and the nature of the universe.  I love my band.

I just realized that I'm doing a report entry.  I haven't done one of those in ages.  

Well, it doesn't look like I'm about to stop.

At about three in the morning on Saturday, I woke up frantic about my ikkyu test.  I had to get out of bed and pantomime my way through the rotary throw.  With so much other excitement going on - concerts, finals, semiformal (yes, I was excited for a dance, give me a break) - the gravity of this test didn't really sink in until that very moment.  

Xana was even more nervous than I was.  Sensei gave us the first forty-five minutes of class to go over our testing techniques and relearn each other's rhythm, because it had been more than a week since we'd trained together.  Somehow, seeing Xana panic caused a calm to fall over me; I don't know, I guess being older, I felt like I should be an example for her, even though we're the same rank and under the same stress.  I'm not sure if it helped her at all, but it definitely worked for me.  My breath was deep through my nose and my sinuses didn't feel blocked at all, in spite of the pesky congestion that'd been bothering me since the day before.  

The test went by in a blur.  That air of calm didn't stay with me during the test, unfortunately, but I felt a singularity of intention.  I was completely absorbed in each isolated movement and moment.  Once, when returning to kamae after one of the ushiro waza, I couldn't remember if I had started with the proper hoja dosa.  It was impossible, but I had no memory of it.

Sensei called katate mochi shomen irimi nage ichi for one of my shite waza, and from the second Xana's hand closed around my wrist, I knew that I didn't know this technique.  I froze for a second, then did a modified tenchi nage.  Sensei chuckled and later said he just wanted to see if I knew it.  Because that fucker called a technique that was from the shodan list of shite waza.  Pfft.  It didn't bother me, though.  My tenchi nage worked.

Inarguably, the weak point in our test was the jiyuwaza.  I expected that going into the test and we slow danced through a few techniques during our forty-five minutes, but there was no way around it; not this late in the game.  There's no substitute for practice.  And trust is such an important element of jiyuwaza.  Trust has to be practiced.

Hmm.  

Anyway.  The jiyuwaza was bad.  Xana seemed afraid hitting me and I wasn't getting a large enough motion on my right side.  On her right side, I was hitting hard but without intent and she had to pick up the slack.  On the left side I kept cross-stepping back to right side, but instead of doing proper number twos I executed a bunch of small and sloppy modifications; Xana was jumping on a few occasions.  And on her last side, I was wiped out and stumbled to my feet on the second to last throw.  It was just shy of humiliating.

But in spite of the many short comings, Sensei and the others affirmed that it was a good test.  I do feel like it was mostly good.  After class I went to dim sum with Sensei and Rick, though I didn't eat much, being still full from the buffet and the symphony concert being just a few hours away.

I was still decorating my mask at quarter after six, so when I realized how little time I had to get ready for the concert, I bolted downstairs and took a lightning fast shower.  Still, I was a half-hour late for call.

The concert went well...ish.  We were only part of three numbers; which I had no problem with at first.  But, because I was part of the ""Neptunian"" women's choir, the operations manager made us leave the stage during intermission and stand in the wings (Neptune is very high and very quiet, so the women's choir is often off-stage) until Neptune came around.  We stood/leaned/squatted/sat in the wings through Jupiter, Venus, Mars, Mozart's Jupiter Symphony, and Uranus.  It was complete bullshit.  J-Walk claimed that we sounded good, but we definitely didn't sound good from where I was standing.  I attribute that to discomfort and rage.

To say we were in a hurry to leave the Chrysler Theatre after the concert is an understatement.  I stood at the mouth of the stage door stairwell with Maddalena, Emily, Adam, Bri, Rashaana, and Bill, and we were anxious as fuck.  A NASA astronaut was doing some guest voice overs during Venus and between the other movements, and he put the concert at a half-hour overtime, ending at 10:30.  We were four hours late for our ""ball"", as some so aptly put it.  It took us a lifetime to get out of the building, but we made it eventually.  I played bus driver.

By the time we got to the Legion, dancing fervour was on the decline and the majority of people had given up on their masks.  Becca and Astrid were even on the way out.  Only three dinners were saved for us choristers, so most of us didn't get to eat.  That was fine with me.  I wasn't really there to eat.

What were you there for, then, Kim?  To stand around nervous and unnecessarily shy?  To greet everyone with enthusiastic hugs and hellos, except the one person that you're actually enthusiastic about?  

I'm a retard.

I got over it quickly, within the first five minutes or so, but for those first five minutes, I had devolved into my high school self.  As soon as I realized it was happening, I medicated with booze.  Got a quick fast buzz via tequila shots with Dave and Drew and washed down with vodka cran.  It wore off just as fast once I started dancing, but it was enough to give my bizarre bout of bashfullness a kick in the arse.

I had an amazing time.  I didn't do any drinking after that first bit, but I didn't need to.  We sang at the top of our lungs or mouthed lyrics obnoxiously.  We tried out kitschy dance moves like the sprinkler and the drunk conductor.  We laughed at the DJ's poor song selection and his inability to match tempi.  We sweat and group hugged and didn't bother running to the washroom to touch up any makeup.  When it got too hot and the DJ started playing N*Sync ballads, we went outside to catch some air.

I'm positive that, had other people not been around, there would have been a moment.  You were looking in my eyes and everything.  

The bigger problem is that I don't know whether I'm relieved or disappointed.  I don't know anything at all.  And I'm somebody else.

When Allen and his posse had torn off all the chair covers and the Legion people turned the lights on, I wasn't ready to go home, so I talked Sinan, Rashaana, and Unis into going to Golden Griddle, where we sat and talked percussion and jazz and clown noses and the deliciousness of apple custard crepes till three am.  

It was a night for the history books, or at least here.

Ju no kumi tanto this morning in Kenshu.  I was a half-hour late for the symphony call again, because I forgot my music.  We sounded much better today, even K-squared, and even despite my sinus congestion getting worse.  Congestion gestating?  That's disgusting, but I kind of like it.

Came home, cleaned out the car to turn in.  I get the new Jeep tomorrow.  It's exactly the same, but black.  

Which has forced me to remember that I'll not have a car tomorrow morning, so I need to get up early to catch the bus and get to school in time to practice with Anna.  Guess I'd better go, then.  Tune in next time for something more cryptic."

But when I'm staring at my Schubert score and trying to decide what would make the best bass line, in no time at all I've completely lost focus and gone back to grinning idiotically.  And then I come up with a few redudant questions to ask, so I open up Facebook again and search for signs of life.  Rinse and repeat.  Maybe I'd have better luck working with the woodwinds for awhile.

I'm aware that writing here is actually not a remedy for my distraction.  Realisitically though, if I don't write something here, it's going to spill out into my Facebook status; and nobody needs that, least of all me.  That would be the anti-subtlety.  Astrid thinks I'm not subtle at all, but she's one to talk, so I remain stubborn as always.

Let's migrate from this subject.  I read the first Diary of  a Wimpy Kid at the dinner table last night; it was cute, and I'm itching to see the movie now.  I haven't seen a movie since Alice at the top of the month.  Clash of the Titans is this weekend; that'd be a good movie to ask him to.  There I go again.

Second attempt:  Jamie has the details for our first show nearly ironed out.  We're playing April 23rd at Coach and Horses, with Sledgehammer and Assassinate the Following.  Naturally, we'll go wayy way first and only play twenty minutes or so; maybe a half hour if we can get one of the new ones sorted out.  I'm still having a block about a few lyrics in Insideout.  That title will probably change.  I'll possibly maybe get around to posting lyrics here.  Eventually.  

Needless to say, I'm pumped.  And nervous, though none of the other guys seem to be.  I suppose a fair bit of the attention falls on me.  Jamie's primary concern is whether enough people will show up, which is the least of mine.  We're still looking for a second guitarist!  Probably jamming with Josh sometime this weekend; we'll see.  

Alright, enough nonsense; back to work."

That's not an emotion I've the luxury of experiencing on a regular basis, so I must say - it's nice.  A sure sign is that my pulse no longer quickens.

"event","We talk about things coming full circle.  I can say that my life definitely seems to be doing so.

Off school this next week, a pleasantry that I'm hoping will be productive.  I've got big plans.  Write my string quartet arrangement - I decided on a JS Bach Polonaise.  Start analyzing my piece for Sally's paper, or at least choose one.  Start organizing my perc notebook, master the snare etude for the midterm.  Try out the yoga place behind Blockbuster.    Catch up on Caprica, which I realized I forgot about completely.  Hangouts, I'm sure.  Some reading, with luck; practicing and memorizing lyrics.  Aikido, lots of Aikido.

Aikido has become the fulcrum of my daily life.  Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays seem long and directionless.  As for the other days, slowly but surely my body remembers.  Some things are still strange; my sword cuts don't have the same intensity as before, and my jo thrusts feel a little lopsided.  On of the other hand, some things that were once difficult seem simpler this time around.  Hiriki no yosei, for one, and my pivots.  We'll see.  I'm pretty positive that I'll be testing in April.  Sensei thinks I can.

Sensei has also managed to talk me out of my crush.  We were psychoanalyzing conversations over tea and pizza on Thursday night; what are the good signs, what are bad.  He's one of those people who look for signs in everything.  But the reason I'm reexamining my motivation isn't that he's pointed out some bad omen I'd overlooked.  It occurred to me that to be hunting for omens at all at this stage in the game is ludicrous.  Yet another example of me getting too far ahead of myself too soon.  I'll be the first to admit that I was getting a little silly.  It's entirely possible, probable even, that I've misinterpreted politeness as interest.  In any event, I've lost nothing.

I feel so childish.  I don't mean that negatively.

Tonight I cancelled plans with a friend from school, because I was feeling really drained from Aikido and doing chores all morning/afternoon and didn't feel up to a six-hour laser tag marathon lasting into the wee hours of the night.  On the one hand I feel kind of bad, especially for not suggesting some alternate, less-involved hangout.  On the other, I'm relieved to have evaded a night of potential awkwardness, because I'm beginning to get the vibe that this friend has a hidden agenda.

Actually, I've been getting that vibe a lot recently, from a few different people.  Maybe I'm just paranoid as fuck.

So, since I had the evening to myself, I read Oryx and Crake.  I'm not surprised that I loved it, but I am slightly surprised by the degree.  It's perfect; so perfect that I almost want to suggest something dumb, like nicknames.

I might go to bed early.  Dream on fallen civilizations and jo tandoku dai san."

"event","I have a crush.  

It's a really silly, grade-school kind of crush, because he doesn't even know I exist.  I mean, we've spoken a couple times, but not nearly enough to justify the giddiness that I experience when he crosses my mind.  It's making me a bit of an idiot.  I've made subtle modifications to my daily routine in order to increase my chances of running into him.  Hanging out in different hallways, just little things, so I can stare at the back of his head for a few seconds.  Rehearsing my smile so it appears immaculately casual.  I impress myself on a regular basis.

I know what you're thinking, Journal.  ""Kim, you're a smart, attractive, independent young woman!  You've got no reason to be sheepish!  Take charge, ask that boy out!""  And ordinarily, that's exactly the sort of thing I would do, except that this is not an ordinary situation, for two reasons.  The first is that I am in such awe of him that I may as well be an eleven-year-old with a crush on a poster.  I might take rejection especially hard.  

The second is that I am just enjoying this feeling too much.  I like having a secret that I can entertain myself with.  I haven't felt this way in ages.

Last night I saw Neil Sedaka at Caesar's with my parents.  My mom invited me to go with them since I was with her and it was around my birthday when she bought the tickets.  Going to the casino with my parents kind of annoys me, because my mom bets poorly and loses sense of how much money she's spending, and because my dad is too uptight with his money.  Neither of them listen to reason, especially when it comes to the dinner menus.  Dinner for the three of us at the Artists' Cafe came to $104, when we could have eaten at the market buffet for $35 each and gotten a lot more than just salads and sandwiches.

But seeing Neil Sedaka made earlier tribulations worthwhile.  We sat in the very front row.  He made eye contact with my mother and I as we sang every word.  At seventy, he sounds exactly the same as he does on records from forty years ago.  What a voice; and man, can he play piano.  It was clear that he was not even trying.  I suppose that happens when you've been songwriting and performing for fifty-eight years.

There were odd moments when I was profoundly sad.  Like when midway through the set, they showed an old Scopitone of ""Calendar Girl"" on the screens, as a nod to Neil Sedaka's golden days.  The video is a bit ridiculous, with overly bright colours and bizarre costumes on each model/dancer, and the music is overwhelmingly simple with naive, 50s lyrics, but I was hit with waves of bittersweet nostalgia.  I learned the months of the year singing along to ""Calendar Girl"".  I can see myself dancing around my old living room with my Blondie doll to ""Happy Birthday Sweet Sixteen"", jumping on and off the couch to peer at myself in the mirror while I sang.  My voice remembers all the harmonies from ""Breaking Up is Hard to Do"" and I fully understand all the ""Solitaire"" lyrics that I didn't get as a toddler.

The worst by far is ""The Diary"":

<i>How I'd like to look into that little book 
The one that has the lock and key 
And know the boy that you care for 
The boy who's in your diary 

When it's late at night what is the name you write? 
Oh, what I'd give if I could see 
Am I the boy that you care for? 
The boy who's in your diary 

Do you recall and make note of all 
The little things I say and do? 
The name you underline, I'm hoping that it's mine 
Darling, I'm so in love with you-oo 

Please don't leave me blue, make all my dreams come true 
You know how much you mean to me 
Say I'm the boy that you care for
The boy who's in your diary</i>

Then I'm tearing up, remembering myself at three years old, asking my parents what a diary was and deciding that this was the sweetest, most romantic song in the world.  The three-year-old me wishing and wondering if any boy would ever feel that way about me.  It's possible that this song is why I started keeping a diary.

It's funny how neglected memories can be triggered so instantaneously. 

I was arguably the youngest person in the audience.  Probably.  Pretty well definitely.

Today kicked off the Windsor Canadian Music Festival with Papador's recital.  I skipped out of Musical Mayhem rehearsal to go, in part to take notes for one of my concert reports for percussion tech, and just because Papador is awesome.  He played some very cool pieces, some I'd heard before and some new ones.  Points d'emergence blows my mind everytime, and I loved Lahara and New-Thann, a neat tabla-inspired piece on top of a droning tape melody.  I think my favourite on the program was Papador's own piece/etude, A Very Welcome Song.  It was very beautiful in an understated sort of way, with lots of planing tenths, which I understand are pretty hard to play.  I should try to play the marimba sometime.  I wonder if we'll get to it in perc.

I'm singing a bit at the Phog Phunkfest on Tuesday with Martin the bassist from DMAP and a couple of his friends. On Wednesday, I'm conducting Biology 101 and performing again in Dave's piece for the student composition recital; which I'm very nervous about, considering that there may be some pretty big deal composers in the audience.  Virgil Moorefield!  Jordan Nobles!  Robert Lemay!  I study these guys!  On top of that, there's Sundar and Rob Rival, who've not yet heard any of my compositions (Rival knows my style from voice-leading and arranging assignments, but it's not the same).  It'd be nice if I could impress them, especially Sundar.

All that being said, I should probably call it a night.  I'm rehearsing Dave's piece with Mary and Joey tomorrow morning, plus I still need to learn how to play snare drum in time for the demo tomorrow night.  Life is good.

Life is excellent, actually."

My resolutions:

- Pack a lunch, instead of buying food from 7-11 every day at school.  Eat more vegetables.
- Go to the kids' class at least once a week.
- Figure out the mystery of the whistle register.  Aiming for G6 (that's a 3 semitone increase).
- Work out twice a week (excluding Aikido and yoga).  Cut 5% BF.
- Read one new novel per month.

Let's see how this goes. :)"

"event","Last night was the first O-Soji in the new dojo.  Elbow powers instead of sword cuts, my shoulders are killing me.  But there is meaning in this.  I cross over into the peace that exists beyond pain; the divine connection between myself and the universe, and others.  My body remembers yours, where my mind had driven you out.

<b>1. What did you do in 2009 that you'd never done before?</b> Turned 20, saw Jewel in concert, stayed in a hotel without parental supervision, used Ableton Live, went to the casino, had laser hair removal, worked as a teaching assistant, took a class over intersession, spoke at a roast, went to Fan Expo in Toronto, sung free-form improvisation, answered a band flyer, was paid for an acting job, participated in (and won) the 48 Hour Flick Fest, had one of my compositions performed live, felt like a real musician.  I'll be seeing the Olympic torch go down Malden Road later today, so I feel that needs mentioning as well.

<b>2. Did you keep your new year's resolutions, and will you make more for next year?</b> I was a veritable failure with last year's resolutions.  I have a bunch in mind for 2010.

<b>3. Did anyone close to you give birth?</b> No.

<b>4. Did anyone close to you die?</b> No one I was especially close to.  My dad's aunt and a number of people from my mom's church.

<b>5. What countries did you visit?</b> Canada, and the States.

<b>6. What would you like to have in 2010 that you lacked in 2009?</b> Some discipline.  My ikkyu, and an 11.0.

<b>7. What dates from 2009 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?</b> January 16th - when the final season of BSG returned after the hiatus.  February 14th - seeing We Will Rock You with Reid in Toronto.  The zombie short-film, ""Run Like Hell"", shot on August 6th; Kory's roast was on August 8th.  The entire weekend of Fan Expo - August 29th-31st.  The Bill Cahn free improv workshop that changed my life, on October 1st.  November 3rd, when Aikido Seikokan reopened in the new location.  November 15th, the Flick Fest results gala and subsequent madness.  Finally, December 18th, Avatar's release.

<b>8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?</b> Probably the Flick Fest win.  We were stunned and I was so proud of everyone.  Also my grades improving steadily and surviving this past semester; it's been rough.

<b>9. What was your biggest failure?</b> Being consistent.  Hands down.

<b>10. Did you suffer illness or injury?</b> I've been very healthy all year.

<b>11. What was the best thing you bought?</b> iMac, my kagami pendant, and Kory's Christmas present, which he will be super impressed with when I give it to him later today.

<b>12. Whose behavior merited celebration?</b> People who worked on the Flick Fest short for being awesome.  Kory, for graduating.  My mother, for landing her dream job at Chapters, and Nick, for landing a killer co-op placement in Windsor at a well-established accounting firm.  Ben for getting his first honours report card.  Myself, for various musical-academic achievements this semester.  And James Fucking Cameron, for creating the most perfect film I've ever seen.

<b>13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?</b> Jesse Bonk.  We started hanging out a bit over the summer, but I quickly discovered that he was being somewhat of a slimeball, so I started avoiding him.

<b>14. Where did most of your money go?</b> It's hard to say.  Food and movies, probably.  I'm a social eater, and I love movies.

<b>15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?</b> Auditions - What the F in Tofino, Rent, Gavin's film, Run Like Hell, Rock Paper Scissors and Killjoy, Kill, and Riot.  Of all these that I auditioned for, I only got roles in three of them, and one was by default.  Nonetheless, I love the audition process and will keep going to as many as possible.  Also the return of BSG, Toronto, Fan Expo, the Flick Fest, and the release of Avatar.

<b>16. What song will always remind you of 2009?</b> Anything from Imogen Heap's Ellipse or Creed's new Full Circle.  Also ""Discipline"", because I worked endlessly on arranging it this past semester.  Anything by Eric Whitacre and a few select songs from Rent.

<b>17. Compared to this time last year, are you happier or sadder?</b> Sadder, I think.  I'm still okay, but I have a lot less figured out than I did last year.

<b>18. What do you wish you'd done more of?</b> Spending frivolous time with friends.  I've been pretty disconnected, especially over the last four months.

<b>19. What do you wish you'd done less of?</b> Debating my own morality.

<b>20. How will you be spending Christmas?</b> My mom's side of the family tomorrow, on Christmas Eve.  Christmas Day we'll do here, then go to my dad's sister's house for a gathering of what's left of his side.  

<b>21. How will you be spending New Years?</b> Working, most likely.

<b>22. Did you fall in love in 2009?</b> Not exactly.  Maybe a little.

<b>23. How many one-night stands?</b> Maybe one.  None in the traditional definition.

<b>24. What was your favorite TV program?</b> Battlestar Galactica (I shed a tear for thou), and recently, Glee.  I tried to get into Dollhouse, but I couldn't keep up with it.  Hopefully will get season 1 for Christmas so I can watch it uninterrupted.

<b>25. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year?</b> Surprisingly, no.  There are a few people I've grown apart from, but I wouldn't say I hate them.  

<b>26. What was the best book you read?</b> Naamah's Kiss, Postmodern Music/Postmodern Thought.  I need to read more.

<b>27. What was your greatest musical discovery?</b> Burkholder's article ""Museum Pieces"" completely opened my mind about musical modernism.  Bill Cahn's improv workshop changed my life.  In the spring, I was totally hooked on pitch-class set theory and a lot of Schoenberg.  I started listening to some more experimental, avant-garde, and minimalist music this term, like Meredith Monk, Steve Reich, early Glass, and Chris Cutler.  On the pop music front, I got more into Bj&#246;rk, IDM, and Yoko Ono.  Soon I will be listening to music genres that have an audience of zero.

<b>28. What did you want and got?</b> Understudies in High School Musical, for Gabriella and Mrs. Darbus.  

<b>29. What did you want and didn't get?</b> For a great part of the year I was thinking that I really wanted a boyfriend, which I didn't get.  But, it ended up being better for me, because I no longer think I'm ready to be in a relationship.  I'm ready for the receiving, but not the giving.

<b>30. What was your favorite film of this year?</b> Avatar, by a mile.  Also Surrogates, District 9, (500) Days of Summer, Push, the new Star Trek, and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.  I should mention Drag Me To Hell because of Kory - it was good, but not as good as he thinks it is. :P  I saw nearly every movie that hit Windsor theatres this year.

<b>31. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?</b> I turned 20, and I honestly did not do anything.  I was supposed to have HSM rehearsal, but it was cancelled, so I stayed at home and my parents took me to Red Lobster.  Kory came over and dropped off his gift to me, but proceeded to say ""I have somewhere else to be"" and left.  The day after my birthday, Mike came down to hang out for a few days, and we had a little BSG party on the 16th.  Mike disappeared without warning on the 17th.  

<b>32. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?</b> If my emotions were not so extremely inconsistent.  Getting better now.

<b>33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2008?</b> Basically the same; pretty plain.  Jeans, t-shirts, H&M tank tops, zip-down hoodies.  Sneakers or black heels/boots.  Natural makeup, with hair down or braided.  I started wearing my glasses more often, now that my prescription has been updated and I got new frames.

<b>34. What kept you sane?</b> The music lounge, and checking in with Reid on the phone or Skype whenever I was about to crash.

<b>35. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most?</b> Ryan Reynolds, Chris Evans, and Chris Pine right after Star Trek came out.  Should also mention that my life has been completely upturned by Sam Worthington.  Rising genre star.

<b>36. What political issue stirred you the most?</b> The CUPE strike.  I went so far as to interview some of the picketing CUPE for an assignment.  

<b>37. Who did you miss?</b> Nick, being away at school.  Jaimie, because we fell out of touch quite a bit since she moved back to Windsor.  Reid and Kory, at various odd intervals when we were not respectively speaking.  It's been a strange year.

<b>38. Who was the best new person you met?</b> Jamie, Jared, and Chris, the band guys.  Couple first years are amazing, including (but not limited to) Maddalena, Mitch, Tyler, Aimee, Katherine, and Mark.

<b>39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2009:</b> I am learning the real meaning of forgiveness, and the theoretical line where the divine cross over into naivety.  The truth is that the truth doesn't matter; only that you commit to your interpretations.  And I don't think that's anything I'll be able to do in the forseeable future.

<b>40. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year:</b>
<i>In every wonder, what you are
I've blurted everything I know just for a piece of it
Flash frozen, patchworked and fallow
I sprung up in hearts and arrow superhighways

Watch it closely, you see it begin to move
Watch it closely, you see it begin to flicker

While we're here, let's see what happens
What we've got, got, got to lose
While we're tidal and flexed on a full moon
It'd be a sure, sure shame to not to

Do you what you feel, just how you like
Nobody has to know</i>"

"event","I hate composing, because it's difficult to do while listening to music.

But, because I'm taking the week to work on my sketches for NMW, I figure I should probably work on them a bit, instead of leaving them to the Sunday night.   So, I finally got around do plotting the spectrum of the bullfrog sample for Biology 101.  The peak frequencies I'm working with are:

165 Hz &#8776; E3*
560 Hz &#8776; C#5
816 Hz &#8776; G#5*
928 Hz &#8776; A#5
1040 Hz &#8776; C6
1784 Hz &#8776; A6
1934 Hz &#8776; B6*

*Highest content

That's mostly for me, but it's also kind of interesting, which is why I'm posting it.  Of course, there are several others too, but these are the most prominent frequencies in the sound of a bullfrog.  Isn't that weird?  We think of it as noise, but is it really?  Maybe we just can't hear it the way we hear a nice, sinusoidal 164.81Hz.  Maybe it's not random.  Maybe it's just irrational and adheres to some sort of pattern our number system just isn't very good at explaining. (Just for fun, Sketch #2 is going to be &#960;). 

Now I'm going to walk through the pc set analysis; partly to try to organize the scribbles I have written down, and partly to show off with the coolest thing I've learned in school.

In pitch-class set analysis, octaves are equal.  Therefore, the series we're working with is:

E, C#, G#, A#, C, A, B

Put into ascending order:

E, G#, A, A#, B, C, C# (within a M6)

Condensed to smallest interval:

G#, A, A#, B, C, C#, E (within a m6)

This part I'm a bit rusty on.  Transformation theory:

    A = (8, 9, T, E, 0, 1, 4)
T0A = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8)
  I0A = (0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
       ------> T0A is most condensed
&#8756; setA = [0123458]

This set is really too big to be very useful.  I might fragment it to make motives, though.  I haven't decided.  I like this series because of all the semitones.  Maybe I'll go hardcore and relentlessly repeat the series in order, only varying the rhythm and which pitches are sounded harmonically.  Most likely not, though.  I'll play around with it some more, but I think I'll probably end up using the series as a scale, rather than a row or a set.  We'll see though.

Hooray for composition in reverse!  I should really be doing this after I write the piece.  I guess I was just seeing if I would get inspired by the numbers - sometimes interval classes inspire me.  Ah well.

Now it's pretty late and I'm starting to get tired.  Which is a drag, because I wanted to write about shooting my simulated sex scene for the film today, or going to yoga for the first time; both of which are far more exciting than the above.  Oh well; another time, I s'pose."

"event","<b>Kimberly Grace</b> gets relationship advice from her fifteen-year-old self.

I had it all figured out back then.

Got Ti&#235;sto's new one, <i>Kaleidoscope</i>, yesterday.  It's perfect for the mood I've been in lately; a nice, isolating sound.  I think a lot of people (maybe on just a subconscious level) like dance music because the rhythm is so relentless.  Layers change gradually, subtly over time, drifting in and out like recurring dreams.  The texture swells but the rhythm stays constant, it stays sane.  The rhythm drives your thoughts.

I spent yesterday before work cleaning up house, literally;  I vaccuumed everything, and I never vaccuum.   I think I've vaccuumed my room a total of four times since I moved back home - that's four times in a year and a half.  That's disgusting.

I had a bunch of plans for today too, things I was going to do to get ahead for school, but none of them have materialized.  Instead I've been walking in a fog of history-induced lethargy, reading, writing, listening to music, and watching TV on occasion.  Jake called me this morning, asking if I'd be free to shoot my scene tomorrow rather than next week.  I said yes and he said he'd get back to me with the details, but later he sent me a text message asking if I could do Wednesday instead.  Now I have no idea what's going on and I don't like that at all.  I've become very fond of the immaculate day planner that gets me through the school week and the work weekend.  This stupid Uwin week is fucking up the system.

That's really not the only thing fucking up the system.

Couldn't put off talking to Kory, though I tried.  I'm very happy MSN was invented; I'm no good at being cold in real life.  He was furious that I disappeared from Coach on Saturday night, which by itself is a big whatever.  I wasn't going to wait there by myself while he leaves for an hour to pick up someone who doesn't like me, not when I know much of the crowd that's already there is also not crazy about me.  So when Reid and Ryan said they were going, of course I went with them.  Plus, I'd sent Kory a message telling him where I went and I fully planned on going back later; only I didn't, because of the angry reply he'd sent back.

I know he's extrapolating.  I can't hold that against him; I'm not exactly a trustworthy person anymore.

And so, to find the right words, I dip into my records.  Suddenly the whole situation seems very sterile, knowing that I've been exactly here before, even if in an extremely juvenile way.  Maybe that's why he says I don't seem sad - which is ridiculous, of course I'm sad.  You're my best friend; I don't want to hurt you.  And so I don't elaborate; nouns, not verbs, no details.  I'd been determined not to sugar-coat anything, but of course I do, a little.  I'm not cruel.

That was about four hours ago; we seem to be talking fine now.  As fine as possibly possible.  He's saying goodbye, and strangely, he's the one comforting me.  Fricking men. :P

I know that I say the all the time, but I feel confident about this.  Around this time last year, I was unsure as to whether or not I was making a mistake.  This time, I'm sure that I'm not.  It's not a choice between one person and another; it's a decision to be completely selfish.  What I want to be happy; it doesn't involve anyone else.  Maybe that's unkind, but it's what I need.  I think, in the long run, he'll be happier for it as well.

I talked to Jamie more about stuff for this band.  He wants me to audition with Vicarious, by Tool, so I need to come up with something cool to do with it.  I don't know why I'm so nervous about this thing, but I am.  It's just because it's something I've wanted to for a long time and I really want it to work out.  Plus, he and the drummer are slightly younger than me, and I want to prove that my education has given me some sort of edge.  Not that my classical voice training is going to be useful to them at all.  I guess I should demonstrate what I can do, though; screams, growls, and operatic Ebs in all.  That's on Thursday.  

Tomorrow I'm going to go for a tan, so I can look more ethnic for the shoot on Wednesday.  Maids are supposed to be ethnic, right?  Then I'll try the library to get started on my 20c term paper.  I want to try analyzing 20c art music in the parameter of sci-fi culture; mostly literature, but I'll have to dip into film as well.  I think it's a good angle, and think I'm the right person to do it.

How sweet is that?  The most superficial place I could go, followed by the most intellectual.  I like the contradiction that is my life."

"event","I found <i>Gordon</i> at Best Buy for eight bucks, so I bought it and I've been listening and relistening to it for the last five hours while working on my paper for 20c studies.  I'm feeling pretty dumb for not listening to the full album before, because it's terrific.  Every single cut.  It might be the very best album I know; it has everything.

The paper, since you asked, went okay.  Not as great as my first one, because I find Nazi revisionism and appropriation to be slightly less interesting than the invention of art music. I'm also about fifty words over the limit, but whatever; it couldn't possibly be shorter.  When I went to see her today to pick up my last paper, Sally said again that she wished I was going into musicology.  I told her I'm not ruling it out.  She might be disappointed with me this time.  

Had a meeting with the prog-metal band poster guy today in the CAW.  It was fun trying to find him at first, because I had no idea what he looked like.  Then when we found each other and started talking a bit, I realized he was at the improv workshop I talked about in my last entry.  He was also a zombie in the Run Like Hell short that I did over the summer.  Truly, I walk around in a fog.

Mostly we just talking about music; what we like, what we think, what we want to create.  I think we might be able to collaborate pretty well.  I was worried he'd be a metal purist from the list of influences he had on the poster, but thankfully he's all over the place like me.  He's got some good ideas and seems super serious; he wants to get an EP together in five months or so, so we can start gigging right away, and he seemed super let down when I said I wasn't sure I could do weekly practices this term.  

We'll see, though.  It'll come down to how we play together.  It might work, it might not.  His names is Jamie.

Jason's also been talking to me about starting a new music ensemble.  We've only talked really casually about it so far, but I have a feeling it could easily develop into something more serious.  Joe says he's up for it too.  I mean who knows?  They've both got great ideas.  I think we're all working towards the same aesthetic, even though we're coming from different places, and I think the aesthetic is good.  Wouldn't it be wild if, in twenty or thirty years, we're doing something like Nexus is doing now?  It'd be insane.

The reality of what I'm doing in school seems very heavy this term.  What everyone said about music being a useless major is completely untrue.  I have so many directions I could go, and they're within my reach, now.  I read professional journals and I can envision myself writing for them.  I slave over a folk song arrangement and I can envision myself arranging pop songs for sheet music books.  I'd never really considered a career in performance other than as a kind of distant fantasy, but that's entirely possible too.  I could be part of a new music movement; I could be fronting a metal group.  I could be writing for and directing choirs, or working for an orchestra doing bookings and box office.  Of course film.  

Teaching isn't even on that list.  That was going to be the final destination, but I don't know anymore.  I could do anything.

I do want to write about something other than my music school adventures, but I'm rather tired, so I'll just make a vague reference to my current emotional state.  And that is optimism.  Strangely, remembering muddy nights brings a sense of bewilderment instead of heartache and longing for the past.  I'm amazed at how my problems have changed, especially because I thought they never would.  I don't remember the precise moment, but at some point I actually let go of a grudge.  No way, right?

And that makes me hopeful about my current grudges.  Tragedy is relative, right?  While I contend that the aches I travel with now are more seroius than those I faced in my youth, I remember how I felt back then; I remember seeing no way out.  Diaries, scribbles, LJ - Lord knows, I have records of every single one.  And they do fade.  I don't take little white pills anymore.

Maybe I'll survive this thing after all.  Go figure."

"event","So, I'm a coffee drinker now.  Even assam tea wasn't enough to get me through the past week, so I've reformed myself, slowly.   Started with the Kona coffee we got from Hawaii so long ago, then the coffee at work, and now I'm onto Sleven coffee.  It works really well during the day when I need to snap out of my perpetual fog, but it keeps me up.  All.  Night.  *Sigh* I don't even really care for the taste of it.

Last Thursday morning NMW and the diverse musics practices class had a ""creative music-making"" workshop with Bill Cahn, of the Nexus group (a world-renowned percussion ensemble for those who don't know).  He focused on free-form improvisation; and I do mean <i>completely</i> free.  He asked for groups of volunteers, started the digital recorder, and told us to ""go"" with only two rules: 

1) You can play anything you want, whenever you want, on any instrument you choose.
2) You should listen - to yourself and to others.  However, there is no penalty for breaking this rule, because that's when interesting things happen.

As little as a year ago, I would've thought this was completely nuts, not to mention pretty lame.  I'm so glad I've adjusted my view.

It was the scariest, coolest, weirdest, most liberating thing I've ever done musically.  My first group consisted of Joe on marimba, Denton on piano, and James Staley from DMP on guitar.  Nothing I've learned in school or in practice had prepared me for something like this.  It was especially scary because I didn't have the bulk of an instrument to hide behind.  I just stood a bit sheepishly at first, staring blankly and shhshing air until slowly I thought of other things and tried to listen.  Listening is not easy all the time.  Mostly I tried to avoid consonances, and to get lost in the sound.

When we listened to the playback, I was surprised, in a good way.  We'd hardly created a symphonic masterwork, but parts of it were really, really cool; especially when James came in with a tiny riff, or when Denton rolled out crazed bursts of...well, noise.  The marimba added this terrific depth, more of an ambience than melody or even rhythm.  We sounded almost like a record.  We sounded pretty cool.  I sounded pretty cool, too.

Later, we had to pick groups for the performance that night.  Jason, Wayne, and Denton formed a group that non-chalantly absorbed me.  And that was a crazy good feeling, because I had been picked.  I felt like one of the athletic kids on the playground who was first picked for soccer-baseball or some equally awesome game.  Like I had something worthwhile to offer.  I rarely feel that way.

The performance was as much fun as the workshop.  We titled our jam ""No Food No Drink"".  That sounded like a jazz song to me, so I tried to incorporate some jazz vocal slides; best I could do for knowing nothing about jazz.  It ended up being wild, weird, and the most dissonant of the four groups that performed.  And I was unbelievably proud, of our group and of myself.  

I completely believe that music therapy might work, under these kinds of terms.  Like when I was watching <i>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs</i> a week earlier, I completely forgot all of my problems for a while.

What problems do I have, anyway?  Reliving this is making them seem very, very far away...

we live on a mountain
right at the top
there's the beautiful view
from the top of the mountain
every morning I walk towards the edge
and throw little things off
like
car-parts, bottles and cutlery
or whatever I find lying around

it's become a habit
a way
to start the day

I go through all this
before you wake up
so I can feel happier 
to be safe up here with you

it's real early morning
no one is awake
I'm back at my cliff
still throwing things off
I listen to the sounds they make
on their way down
I follow with my eyes 'til they crash
I imagine what my body would sound like
slamming against those rocks

and when it lands
will my eyes 
be closed or open?

I go through all of this
before you wake up
so I can feel happier
to be safe up here with you.

"event","One day, I'll come up with titles that aren't what I saw on some screen today.

Is my life a giant charade?  

I have no idea where I'm going.  And for not knowing where I'm going, things seem to be going pretty quickly.  The weekend was insane, trying to squeeze in working and casting and grading papers.  I got another TA job this semester - in fact, two.   Theory I with Makoto Mikawa and Themes in Pop with Sundar again.  Graded circa 50 papers for Makoto, and meeting with Sundar tomorrow.  I may have to turn the Themes in Pop one down.  I don't want to spread myself too thin.

I might be long past spreading myself too thin.  

The casting call for Thomas's movie this weekend was fun, if not as productive as desired.   About half of the people who'd booked appointments with us showed up.  Which is great; I had expected worse.  Of the maybe ten people we saw, we really liked about four.  And we can really only for sure use one.  *Sigh* I'm planning on slowing down once we're through with casting.  If I get my way, the really fantastic girl we saw Saturday afternoon will be playing my part and my involvement in Kill will be limited to consult only.

I like being busy.  Most of the times.  It spares me the opportunity to think too much.  To address some things I'd rather not deal with right now.  Or ever.

I know that someone in my situation doesn't get the luxury of complaining about being sexually frustrated - or is it romantically frustrated?  There has been some blurring of the lines and I'm not sure which is more pressing.  Polishing silverware, my mind wanders and I think about strange locations, mostly from high school, when alone-space was such a commodity.  I laugh to myself and feel faintly sad.  I miss being crazy like that.  

Again, I've no real reason to complain, because there's no reason I couldn't be similarly crazy now, except for the associated memories.  He owns them.  It was fun, but I can't act that way with anyone else.  I just can't.

Maybe this is the whole being-forgetful thing again.  It seems we tend to undermine the good aspects of the present and glaze over the bad parts of the past.  It seems to happen whenever I'm alone.  After all, it has been nearly five days.

That can't exactly be a good sign.

I could rate my contentment in percentages.  I could draw up some sort of contract for myself, like an oath.  I could lay out a list of pros and cons and systematically come to some sort of proper conclusion.

Or I could suspend myself in limbo.  Uncertainty and foolish games.  

I guess I know which way I'm leaning today."

"event","Let's give this another try.

Life is now in full-swing.  Year the III has begun, and I'm swamped in a fantastic, terrifying, daunting way.  Taking courses I want to take, applying myself.  Working way too hard not to disappoint people, and yet I am.

I'm an enormous flake; consistently inconsistent.  I thought I had done something courageous and considerate, but movies and that look in your eyes makes my firmament sway and crumble.  I'm not sure what I want.  Just that I want to be near you, always.  Whatever the cost.  

And no, we're not perfect, but is anybody, really?  I don't need perfection; I don't even like perfection.  I especially don't like the thought of somebody else's hand pushing your hair gently out of your eyes, not at all.  I want to claim you for my own.

We talk about the importance of spectacle and I realize I've not changed a bit.  I hunger still, for a comfortable strangeness.  I need my heart to feel a pang of loss, of guilt, of complexity.  Why?  I'm not channeling it the way I once was.  Scribbles are daily reports, art is empty ellipses on staves.  Music is sharp and skeletal, strangling me at times.  The confines of second species, straight-toning.  Autonomous anonymity; no G naturals.

My writing is garbage.

But somewhere underneath it all, today is a good day.  I like sharing bits of my life with you.  I'd like to share all of it.  I wouldn't mind spending every day like this.  

Or at least every Monday."

"event","See this movie.

I've been laying low since I got back from the convention.  I feel a bit like a bitch, but I'd like to be laying lower.  I'd like just to completely disappear for awhile.  Rent a movie or two.  Cook for one.  I like it.  I feel independent.

I've not had too many chances to feel independent before.  Many of my friends have the idea that being home alone doing nothing is synonymous with being not busy, and I've thought that way before.  I'm not sure what's changed.  Where I used to feel lonely I now feel comfortable.  I used to call that lethargy, but maybe it's not the same.  Depending on what you do with your time, I suppose.  What have I done?  Laundry.  Reading a bit, writing a bit, listening to some new music.  Small victories.  They don't feel small.

Of course, I'm not really alone.  I've got Denny with me, who's been spending more and more time hanging out with me, because he likes my new duvet.  When I came home the other day from errands with my mom, he was asleep on my bed, waiting for me.  It would be nice to find a man who'd wait so eagerly.

Not that I'm really looking to find a man at all.

I don't know.  A couple things became clear to me over the course of the weekend.  One is that Sensei is right; when I feel the ""spark"", I'll know it.  And I know that this isn't it.  

That conversation with him on Thursday night made me feel a little...apprehensive.  In the past I've regarded myself as a bit of an expert in the ways of the heart.  Well, not quite an expert, but experienced enough.  People would come to me for advice, and I'd give good ones.  I'm level-headed enough to see everyone's problems except my own.  Maybe I have no idea what I'm talking about.  Maybe I've no better idea of what love is than anyone else; than schoolgirls, than pubescent boys, than thrice-divorced housewives.

I want to go someplace.  I really want to move.  Maybe a big city that would pay no attention to me.  People wouldn't ask to take my picture.  My mom wouldn't feel sorry for me seeing a movie by myself and insist on tagging along.  

Work, study, save money.  It's easy Kim; just work, study, save money, and wait; and you'll be as free as you want."

"event","I get into this habit of lurking over old memories.  It's addictive; it always starts small, like spontaneously following a Facebook link from one person's profile to another, and then it spirals out of control until I'm scrambling to pull myself out from staggering waves of nostalgia.

Lately I've not been responsible.  People are seeming to pop back up, when I thought they would disappear.  That used to be sad, but I've learned to acquiesce.  That's just what happens after high school, college, the end of romances, etc.  It used to make me sad. I used to be completely paranoid about losing touch with people.  I don't know when that changed.

But it seems I was wrong, at least in some cases.  My lack of preparation has left me completely unable to cope.  Even though I was only at Bon's thing for all of three minutes, it was...weird.  I had to get out of there.  I had (remarkably) accepted the fact that Reid had permanently vacated my life; until he called, and I entered a state of mild panic.

Not all of these re-encounters have been negative, though.  Rob called me out of the blue on Saturday, saying that he was in town, so I went out with him, Peltier (who I haven't talked to in a year, despite him still being in Windsor and still living just a couple blocks from my house), Ara, and her boyfriend, Peter Marier (it's a small, small world) on Monday night.  We went to the casino and drank - well, I drank - and reminisced.  

Then today, Marc Parent randomly showed up at Aikido (yes, I went back to Aikido - started back in July).  He joined the Navy in the winter.  Seeing him made me want to cry tears of joy.  I settled for hugging him about six times.  

Being back at Seikokan is so terrific for me.  I like to think it's been terrific for everybody else, too; it seems like they'd missed me, especially Sensei.  Now Marc is back until April to finish up his degree, and things can be like old times; maybe, with a couple of changes.  Sandcastle is closing to make way for the new Windsor-Essex Parkway, so our last class is September 10th.  We've got plans to relocate, but there's likely to be some downtime between closing and moving to our new location.  I hope everything works out, and with good speed.  Aikido is everything.  It gives me focus and direction and an outlet for my energy.  It brightens my thoughts when I've got intent to write a brooding, melancholy journal entry.

Back to change.

Sometimes acquiescing to change feels a bit like settling, and maybe it is.  Is that the stage my life has currently reached?  Is that what I desire on some sub-conscious level?  Now that it's happening, it feels too easy and out of my control.  I expected there would be something more.

I feel so much older than I am.  

This transition to stability is making me restless.  Maybe it's a part of maturing, but it makes me feel caged and helpless.  And lazy.  I had my teenage angst at eight years old and felt the anxiety of independence at fourteen.  Maybe what I've got going now is my mid-life crisis.  Coming to terms with my mortality.  I wonder if I'm going to die young.

Maybe I'm looking too closely for something to go wrong.  For something to complain about.  Maybe I'm hoping that something will go wrong.  This isn't just about romance, though of course it is, in part.  It's always about romance.  I have irrational fears; problems with commitment, possibly severe problems with commitment.  The dreamer is a cheater; an intellectual whore.  I wonder if I thought myself into having this problem.  Manifested destiny and all that shit.  I wonder if all those years spent worrying about the possibility of developing this problem jinxed it into being.  Probably.

Anyways, I don't know where I'm going with this.  I just felt the need to write something that someone could potentially see.  Call it a cry for help, if you will.  I'm not crying, just trying to stay hopeful.  Sorry for all the parentheses."

That mock-seriousness that was my life.  I filled book after book with my petty worries and complaints.  I walked through my daily life saving them up, storing them and letting them seethe until they became dark enough to fuel my misgivings.  Nights were blue and uncomfortable.  Comfort was red.  In those days, everything was monumental; when I oozed poetry and papercuts.  The code I had written - I thought I was so clever!  I thought I was preserving myself, preventing the bruised blanket I had wrapped around myself from falling away and leaving me naked.  I thought I had crafted an illusion so vast and thick that no one could fathom the truth.

But you don't play those games.  Maybe you're simple, or maybe you're too tired to continue the disguise, like me.  Whatever the reason, it's your way.  Cut and dry, you cross the line, again and again.  You played translator over and over for those old times when I was too shy or scared to speak my mind, because you knew it all.  When I had bottled myself and unplugged my emotions, you were there and you broke through; in one deceptive cadence, like it was easy.  Like it was <i>easy</i>.

In your voice I hear all the ghosts of my past.  A catch in your throat; a growl, a furrowed brow.  It runs through my veins.  Your voice is an echo that torments me.  

You torment me, and I love it.  I love every minute of it.

"event","<b>1. What did you do in 2008 that you'd never done before?</b> Turned 19, auditioned and was accepted into the B.Mus program, participated in a voice masterclass, ordered my own alcoholic beverage at a restaurant, solved a Rubik's cube, painted walls, dressed as the Easter Bunny for Easter Brunch, failed Kenshu,  performed on the Chrysler Theatre Stage, sang a Take 4 recital, went to a jazz club, sang a jury, checked out of residence, lived in the basement, got my G license, was cast as the lead in a show, was cast as the lead in a show that got cancelled, did the bar thing downtown, drunk myself into a stupor that caused vomiting, auditioned for and was cast in a (B-level/student) horror movie, acted for a camera, had to kiss someone for a scene, had to be partially nude for a scene, had to attempt to vomit for a scene, rode a train alone, went to Mexican town, stayed up all night talking, was left home alone while my parents were out of town, drove in the States on my own, drove to Toronto on my own, auditioned for Disney Cruise Lines, adopted a stray cat, went to a strip club, skipped days of Night Thoughts.

<b>2. Did you keep your new year's resolutions, and will you make more for next year?</b> I didn't really make any last year.  I'm still considering for this next one.

<b>3. Did anyone close to you give birth?</b> My forty-five year old Aunt gave birth had her sixth child in April.  His name is Xavier.  I think she's going to get her tubes tied after this.

<b>4. Did anyone close to you die?</b> The McFaddens' grandfather; we all went to his funeral viewing.

<b>5. What countries did you visit?</b> Canada.  And the States, for numerous Vanilla Coke quests.

<b>6. What would you like to have in 2009 that you lacked in 2008?</b> A piece or two that I am satisfied enough to add to my portfolio.

<b>7. What dates from 2008 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?</b> To be honest, I have very few.  I was very spotty in my record keeping of 2008, largely due to school, the shows, and my disgust and contempt with myself repeating the same things every day.  July 28th, the day we started shooting Moonlight Sonata, is probably the biggest one.  Other than that, there's August 4th, when we celebrated Kory's birthday, the day after Thanksgiving, when I broke up with Kory, and October 24th, when High School Musical 3 came out.  That's kind of sad, when I think about it.

<b>8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?</b> I did really, really well on my first jury.  Other than that, I consider Moonlight to be a big achievement, in that I went out on such a limb and have a terrific time.  If my biggest rival were standing in line at Starbuck in front of me, I would probably start discussing it loudly in order to illustrate how successful I've become since high school.

<b>9. What was your biggest failure?</b> Being a girlfriend.  Also Kenshu and Aikido in general, because I've had to take this last semester off.

<b>10. Did you suffer illness or injury?</b> I had a giant bruise on my knee from falling down at work.  Other than that, no.

<b>11. What was the best thing you bought?</b> My fluffy yellow bathrobe and High School Musical candy canes.  I'm really proud of the Christmas presents I bought everyone (with some exception).  And the cat, if you want to count him.

<b>12. Whose behavior merited celebration?</b> Jaimie and Reid for making it out of Windsor.  And for their continued kindness in returning every once in awhile to visit us.

<b>13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?</b> Sarah Allen; that's why I don't speak to her anymore.

<b>14. Where did most of your money go?</b> The cat.  Jesus, the cat is so expensive!

<b>15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?</b> Auditions - Cabaret, High School Musical (again), Moonlight Sonata, High School Musical (yet again), and the Disney Cruise thing.  And the Hockey Anthem Challenge. I just really like performing.

<b>16. What song will always remind you of 2008?</b> ""Waiting"" by City and Colour. ""Different When It Comes to You"" by Bruce Cockburn, and ""Motorcycle Drive By"", even though it's from 1998.  Pink's ""So What"" and that awful new Nickelback song, ""Gotta be Somebody"".  Anything Feist or from Apocalyptica's <i>Worlds Collide</i>. All the pieces I sang in school, as well as things from Aida and High School Musical 3.

<b>17. Compared to this time last year, are you happier or sadder?</b> A good deal happier.  Oddly enough.  I think I have a better idea of my ""place"", so to speak.

<b>18. What do you wish you'd done more of?</b> Writing! I hardly ever write anymore.  I don't really remember if I'm good or not.

<b>19. What do you wish you'd done less of?</b> Whimpering and breaking promises to myself over and over again.  Trying to convince people of things that clearly are not.

<b>20. How will you be spending Christmas?</b> My mom's side of the family tomorrow.  Christmas Day we'll probably do here, then go to my dad's sister's house for a gathering of what's left of his side.

<b>21. How will you be spending New Years?</b> Working, or (if I win the BNL tickets) at the BNL show at the Fox.

<b>22. Did you fall in love in 2008?</b> There were some close calls.

<b>23. How many one-night stands?</b> I'm not really a one-night stand kind of girl, but I will say that I had seven failed potential romances over the summer.  That's actually what I've titled Summer 2008: The Summer of Failed Potential Romances.

<b>24. What was your favorite TV program?</b> Battlestar Galactica; I can't believe you are nearly over. Also Dexter, and True Blood.

<b>25. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year?</b> I don't think I hate anyone, but I greatly dislike Sarah, Ashley, and a person or two from the shows.  

<b>26. What was the best book you read?</b> Kushiel's Mercy and Healing Love Through the Tao.  This has also been Late Summer/Autumn of Twilight, so I feel it needs mentioning, although I think its fandom is overrated.

<b>27. What was your greatest musical discovery?</b> I completely understand Bach's two-part inventions and fugues now.  I also know way more about film music now, thanks to Sally Bick and a good deal of extra research that included viewing more than 25 horror films in a two-week period.  With keyboard, I am finally feeling the cadential I6/4, whereas before I merely knew of its uses.  Neopolitan sixes are <i>such</i> a turn-on.  

<b>28. What did you want and got?</b> I wanted someone warm and energetic to love me.  I got a cat. :)

<b>29. What did you want and didn't get?</b> The lead in Theatre Alive's High School Musical.  Even an understudy might have been nice, too.  I've pretty much accepted that this show hates me.

<b>30. What was your favorite film of this year?</b> Quarantine, Hamlet 2, The Dark Knight, and Hancock.  Yeah, and High School Musical 3.

<b>31. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?</b> I turned 19. I had some people get together at Naysa for dinner, then we went back to my rez and played Catchphrase, because I told people it was BYOB and nobody brought any.  With the Aikido guys, I got really drunk on Viva Puff shots and went to Coach and Horses to watch Marc's band play.  The weekend after my birthday, Mike Duncan came down from Fort Erie to visit; we saw Cloverfield on opening night in the front row, watching High School Musical, 3-Iron, and Transformers in my dorm room, stomped some arrows and played Guitar Hero, got a teensy bit drunk with Jaimie and Roman, and went to Golden Griddle.

<b>32. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?</b> If I were not living in my parents' basement for the latter part of it.  Which is not so bad; they leave me pretty well alone, but I've been missing out on some freedoms.

<b>33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2008?</b>  Plain but classic.  Jeans, t-shirts, ribbed tank tops, zip-down hoodies.  Sneakers or black heels/boots.  Hair down, makeup natural.  Girl-next-doory.  

<b>34. What kept you sane?</b> The music lounge and keeping busy.

<b>35. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most?</b> Ryan Kwanten (Jason Stackhouse of True Blood) and of course, Zac Efron.

<b>36. What political issue stirred you the most?</b> The American election, and this buy-out business.

<b>37. Who did you miss?</b> Reid, Jaimie, and my brother Nick.  Why couldn't your schools just move to Windsor?

<b>38. Who was the best new person you met?</b> The people from Moonlight Sonata, with honorable mention to Kory, Ken, and Joel.  Bill, Sinan, Ashley, and Amy: the best first-years ever.  Jake, Jen, and other new people I met in the shows.  And Dr. Sally Bick.

<b>39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2008:</b> That life's a bitch, and then you die.  It's easy to get caught up in the little things along the way...and you know what, maybe that's the point.  Life doesn't follow a simple A to B to C plan; there are subsections and cross-references and digressions galore.  And it seems that these disgressions are the parts I like the best.  Indulge yourself, wisely.

<b>40. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year:</b>
<i>A coma might feel better than this
Attempting to discover, where to begin
You're weighed down, you're full of something 
Of sickness and desertion
You're weighed down, you're full of something
You're underneath it all

So say goodbye to Love
And hold you head up high
There's no need to rush
We're all just waiting, waiting to die</i>"

"event","It's strange magic - and the extreme desire to not ruin the book by seeing the movie first - that had me reading Blindness all day, on Thanksgiving.  It is by no means an easy read, because Saramago decided not to use paragraphs or quotation marks in the conventional way, nor name his characters.  That's not criticism, because it ends up really adding to the feeling of chaos that pervades each chapter.  Humankind astounds me; we take so many things for granted.  I see why this book won the Nobel Prize.  I'm not yet finished, but I can tell it's going to be a new favourite.

The point of mentioning this is that it made me think about how lucky I really am.  I've always said that if I had to choose, I'd rather be blind than deaf (for the obvious reasons), but truth be told, I'm rather fond of seeing.  And hearing, and smelling, and tasting, and feeling.  My senses alone blow my mind in their awesomeness.  My body is capable of so many awesome, awesome feats.  Buttoning up buttons, dancing, elbow powers.  To think of the miracle that all these crazy factors came together and formed this incredible machine blows my mind.  It's a pretty perfect vessel for this soul thing of mine.  No matter what you might believe, I think you have to admit that's pretty fantastic.  I have to believe that this was more than a random accident of motion and matter.

I have a pretty great family, though quirky and dysfunctional like any other family.  My quiet, genius, weird-as-shit brother Nick, who actually hugged me when he saw me coming out of LaSalle Music yesterday (he was heading to Boppers and spotted me from across the parking lot - he's home for the long weekend and he's never, ever hugged me).  The deranged, anarchist, metal-head Ben, who keeps getting better and better at guitar, to the point that it's actually starting to frighten me.  My dad, who is ridiculously empathetic and would never say no to anyone in spite of how extravagant their request may be.  My mother, who is, very simply, my hero.  My red-neck extended family, with whom I ate pre-stuffed, frozen turkey tonight, and my mother's side: all the pseudo-grandparents, pseudo-aunts and pseudo-uncles, pseudo-cousins, who were able to love my mom so much that they made her one of them.  They didn't need to take on her burdens, had no obligation of blood or seed, and yet they did.  And yeah, I'm a bit estranged from them - from the cheerleader, football player, model, dancer, grossly American-stereotypical cousins of mine - but they are my family too, by choice.  A family formed without having to be guilt-tripped into existence; a family forged on love alone.

I'm glad for my friends, as much as I may put on a show of being tough, as much as I complain to hell and back about them from time to time.  I'm so happy to know such a weird assortment of people; it's made me confident that I can deal with virtually anyone.  For every facet of my personality (and there is a lot of them), there's also a person to match, a person who understands that part of me perfectly, even though they may never see the whole sphere.  People who know I can be two-faced and moody and vain, and stand by me anyway.  People I can hurt and who can hurt me without any qualm or fear, because I <i>know</i> they will be there.  That to me is what loyalty really is: knowing that no bridge is ever truly burned out.  I'm so lucky to have found people who put up with me in this way.  I'm not sure I could put up with myself if I weren't me.

Most of all, I'm thankful for the happy accidents that brought me here.  Yeah, the road has been steep and slippery and I fell down and banged my knee more than just a few times, but it has been such a worthy journey.  Even the things I thought would torture me forever have done their good: they've shaped me and helped me learn.  Now that my adolescence is pretty much at its end, I'm able to appreciate that more than I ever thought I could.  You, you rough, dirty, dark times, you are what has been my compass in navigating through this awesome, awesome world.

And so, at the expensive of sounding like a total nerd, I sing to you:

<i>I love the mountains
I love the clear blue skies
I love big bridges
I love when great whites fly
I love the whole world
And all its sights and sounds
Boom de a da, boom de a da, boom de a da, boom de a da

I love the planet
I love the dirty things
I love to go fast
I love Eyptian kings
I love the whole world
And all its craziness
Boom de a da, boom de a da, boom de a da, boom de a da

I love tornados
I love arachnids
I love hot magma
I love the giant squids
I love the whole world
It's such a brilliant place
Boom de a da, boom de a da, boom de a da, boom de a da
Boom de a da, boom de a da, boom de a da, boom de a da...</i>"

"event","Hello World.  I guess a lot has happened.

The strike is over, so I'm back in school.  Second year of music at the University of Windsor.  It's exciting and aggravating.  I face a constant battle with myself over whether I'm doing the right thing.  There are times when I feel completely talentless, even in a sub-standard school like Windsor.  There are times when I feel so behind, with gaping holes in my knowledge, and there are times when I feel I'm only getting stupider.  It's getting harder to keep an open mind when people are pointing fingers at all your role models, shouting ""Soulless! Unoriginal!""  Stop the snob train; I want to get off.

But at the same time, there are times when I feel connected, like a cog in gear just ticking along.  Times when I'm perfectly contented anaylising the shit out of this trio sonata, this prelude, that nocturne.  My buddies are always joking that I'm going to be the world's best theory professor - is that my destiny?  I was under the impression that there'd be something more.

This year, I'm living in my parents' basement instead of in rez or downtown.  Rez was fun, but I didn't want another year of dealing with stoner roomates and loud neighbours and unnattentive RAs.  With Nick gone to Waterloo, we traded bedrooms so I could have more privacy, and so far it's been great.  My room is huge and I'm rarely bothered by anyone else in the house (except when I leave my alarm on for an hour in the morning).  It's making me a better student too, because I'm less tempted to skip classes, and a more social one, because I don't go to my room and sleep between every class.

I'm seeing a new guy now.  His name is Kory, and we met over the summer while working on a B-level student horror film.  He wrote it and cast me in a major supporting role, kind of at the last minute because they were desperate for female actors.  I ended up loving the shoot so much that I hung around on set every day for almost three weeks.  We were doing 15 hours days, so it's not surprising that we got pretty close.  

At his best, he's witty, smart, enthusiastic, attentive, conscientious, honest, and sweet.  At worst, he can be cold, whiny, and needy.  As of yet, his pros are out-winning his cons.  The thing I like best is that I'm able to be completely candid with him.  My vanity - not to mention just plain meanness - doesn't seem to bother him at all.  He shouldn't have to put up with me, but he does, and appears to like it.  I'd feel better about the whole thing if I felt like I deserved him.

High School Musical insists on stalking me, wreaking havoc on my sanity.  In June, I was cast as Gabriella in a small, county production of High School Musical with the Space.  A few weeks later, Theatre Alive announced that they'd also be putting on High School Musical in the spring.  Subsequently, the Space cancelled their production, due to drop-outs. I was bummed out about that, but hopeful in auditioning for Theatre Alive.  The casting calls were made just a few hours ago, and I've got a spot on the chorus.  Which I guess isn't the worst that could've come from it.

I'm trying not to think about it, because it makes me really angry.  It feels kind of like I got robbed.  My Aida buddies seem to have been, as well; all of them stuck in parts too small or wrong for their talents.  The last few hours have been full of phone calls and emails and text messages comforting each other.  On the bright side, we're all in this together.

Life would be pretty lonely right now if it weren't for my musical buddies.  Between Nick leaving, Jaimie splitting to Brock for geography, and Reid in Toronto at Humber for acting, I'm basically missing my life-line of confidants.  I talk to Jaimie often on the phone, I instant message Nick every once in awhile, and Reid and I are not speaking at all.  You don't have to be too creative to deduce why.

I'm still working for the catering company at the golf course, although right now they suspended me because I skipped out on a shift to go to one of the HSM calls.  I've also got a job teaching voice at Jay Swatman's music store in the Burger King plaza on Saturdays.  It's fun, even though I only have two students.  I feel a bit bad for their parents, because they're paying a fortune - $20 a week for half-hour lessons - and I don't even have my degree yet.  Especially since I get paid only $16 an hour.

I started nude modeling at the college for a life drawing class.  At first it just sounded like easy money, but I'm actually enjoying it a lot.  Once I got over the initial nervousness of being naked in front of a class of 20 people, I found it very calming.  For three hours, I think about just my body; my muscles, posture, and expression, keeping as still as possible.  It makes up for the time I've been missing in Aikido due to lack of money.  There was a substitute prof last time, and he said he could tell that I was into martial arts.  I have good body awareness, apparently.  It makes me wish I was still doing art of some kind; I haven't worked on anything in awhile.

I've been working on getting back in shape, emphasis on the 'working' bit.  I managed to lose the 10lbs of rez weight from last year, putting me at a solid 135lbs; now the goal is to cut my body fat down to 22% (I'm at about 28% now).  It's going well so far: I jog and do elliptical training every day with alternating calisthenics and weight training.  Cutting back on junk food has been the hardest, because I love going out to eat, but I've made small improvements.

In a nutshell, things are on the up.  By extension, my Celexa dosage is on the down: 30mgs compared to last year's 50mgs.  I'm confident enough that I could cut it out completely, but I'm weaning, just to be on the safe side.

Things are great.  I am great.

So how does that explain the uncertainty?"

"event","My third year; my fourth anniversary of this quiz:

<b>1. What did you do in 2006 that you'd never done before?</b> Turned eighteen, went to Florida, dissected a squid, swam with sharks, held a snake, got a tattoo, auditioned for a university, was accepted to a university, played piano while in character on stage, had my wisdom teeth removed, went to prom, wore a corsage, went to an after-prom party, performed one of my own songs for the Talent Show, won Musician of the Year, drove to Grand Bend, went camping without parents, got drunk while camping, moved out of my house, had a roommate, had to buy groceries, went to a foam party, attended Dirty Bingo, auditioned for Theatre Alive, got called back for Theatre Alive, was cast in a show wit Theatre Alive, drove through a drive-thru, hosted a drunken party, played an acoustic show at a coffee house, wrote university exams.

<b>2. Did you keep your new year's resolutions, and will you make more for next year?</b> I made a ton of resolutions, mostly to do with music and Aikido, and had trouble sticking to most of them. I didn't go to kids classes, and I gave up on my 100 sword cuts a day after two months. The music ones I mostly kept, albeit I didn't compose as much as I aimed for. The relationship ones I kept, even ones I should have given up on. I'll make more, of course, because I like them.

<b>3. Did anyone close to you give birth?</b> I think my aunt did. She's pregnant again now. And still over forty.

<b>4. Did anyone close to you die?</b> My great foster-uncle Pat passed away just a few weeks ago. He lives in Tennessee, so we couldn't go to the funeral. He was an amazing man; an opera singer and escort to movie stars. He collected beautiful things and spoiled his wife. She's probably heartbroken. We are too. 

<b>5. What countries did you visit?</b> Just the states: Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia, Tenessee, North Carolina. 

<b>6. What would you like to have in 2007 that you lacked in 2006?</b> Patience. Mostly patience.

<b>7. What date from 2006 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?</b> Let's see. My birthday was incredible. March 11th I took Reid to see Rent, which was awesome. March 14th he took me to get my tattoo. Prom was May 11, though I'd almost rather forget that. Graduation - June 26th. I moved out on September 2nd. November 5th.

<b>8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?</b> I think it's my theory progress. Theory doesn't come easily to me, so I really have to work at it, but I do because I love it. I had a 91% on my midterm and my final went even better. And because that plays such a huge role in my future as a composer, I'd say that's the most important. Although I don't really consider it an achievement, because I didn't really do anything, I was ecstatic and humbled to win Musician of the Year. 

<b>9. What was your biggest failure?</b> Lately I've been failing to invest my money wisely. 

<b>10. Did you suffer illness or injury?</b> I had my wisdom teeth out, and I loved it.

<b>11. What was the best thing you bought?</b> I love my alarm clock-iPod stereo. I am also quite fond of my guitar, though technically I haven't bought it yet, because it isn't paid in full. 

<b>12. Whose behavior merited celebration?</b> Nick for being the smartest kid in grade eleven. Ben for getting really good at the guitar.

<b>13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?</b> No one in particular. I kind of hate Ashley, but I would hardly call that appalled and depressed. 

<b>14. Where did most of your money go?</b> School. I bought so many provisions for the dorm. Plus lessons with Stacey and all the music books. 

<b>15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?</b> Going to see Rent, HSM the Musical, prom, various parties, camping, moving out, Halloween. Sarah's Christmas party was last night, and it was awesome. Currently I'm excited for ice skating tomorrow. And my birthday party, which will be awesome.

<b>16. What songs will always remind you of 2006?</b> ""Stay"", the Lisa Loeb one. I know it's from 1992 or something, but it just gets me. ""In My Dreams""; thanks for that, Reid. ""Big Girls Don't Cry (Personal)"" - I know it's Fergie, but I love it. Also John Mayer's ""I'm Gonna Find Another You"". All Imogen Heap. Moby's greatest CD, especially ""We Are All Made of Stars"", ""Beautiful"", and ""Extreme Ways"". And, of course, ""What I've Done"".

<b>17. Compared to this time last year, are you happier or sadder?</b> I'm wiser. That doesn't necessarily mean happier, but...My balance has improved, for certain.

<b>18. What do you wish you'd done more of?</b> Writing. Once again. I don't think I've written a single poem all year. I guess that's what happens when I decide to focus on music.

<b>19. What do you wish you'd done less of?</b> Being a girl. By that I mean being unreasonably emotional and fickle. I think I'm improving, though.

<b>20. How will you be spending Christmas?</b> Christmas Eve with the Smiths. Christmas Day with the family, then down in Leamington later to visit my aunt and her family. Boxing Day I want to go see Sweeney Todd with Reid.

<b>20. How will you be spending New Years?</b> At the Ambassador Golf Course, catering to my little hearts discontent.

<b>21. Did you fall in love in 2006?</b> It's a long, slow, pointless slide.

<b>22. How many one-night stands?</b> None.

<b>23. What was your favorite TV program?</b> Dexter. It's over now, but it blew my mind. It still blows my mind when I watch the reruns.

<b>24. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year?</b> Ashley. Last year I didn't know who she was. This year I fantasize about punching her in the face with a coffee pot, so that she'll get both broken glass and hot coffee all over her.

<b>25. What was the best book you read?</b> Kushiel's Dart, Kushiel's Chosen, Kushiel's Avatar. I'm in love with the series. I also really enjoy my Theory textbook. Ralph Turek makes endless hours of studying at least a little enjoyable.

<b>26. What was your greatest musical discovery?</b> I have discovered so much this year. From my Pop class I've fallen in love with the Beach Boys, Stevie Wonder, and The Police. I've learned a ton about modes and harmony; I am actually beginning to break free of my I-vi-IV-V rut. I have a new appreciation for opera thanks to Stacey and Tim. 

<b>27. What did you want and got?</b> Validity.

<b>28. What did you want and didn't get?</b> I still don't have a puppy. We have a bunny now, though. 

<b>29. What was your favorite film of this year?</b> Transformers. High School Musical 2 and Hairspray. Awake was terrific. Across the Universe was probably my highest favourite. But I haven't seen Sweeney Todd yet. 

<b>30. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?</b> I was 18. Reid came over to take me to see the Curse of the Golden Flower, with Gong Li. I was really looking forward to it, because my mother said she loved it. As we were on our way, Reid realized he forgot is wallet so we stopped by his house. He invited me to come in with him, because he wasn't sure how long it'd take him to find it. I went downstairs to wait, and then, suddenly, Ryan, Richard, Keith, Kyle, and Bon tumbled out of the laundry room. Reid had this whole surprise party prepared. He had even made a video for me, interviewing all of my friends and his friends about me. It was hilarious, touching, and wonderful. After we had penguin cake (aww), we made the staff at Applebee's want to commit mass suicide as we showed up unannounced with fourteen people.

<b>31. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?</b> If I were in the B.Mus program right now. I should've just auditioned.

<b>32. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2005?</b> Basics and classics. I liked plain shirts in bold colours; a few funny tees. Always jeans. I also started incorporating some more girly styles in attempt to mimic Vanessa Anne Hudgens, so I can steal Zac from her.

<b>33. What kept you sane?</b> Venting to Reid, Sarah, and more recently, Jaimie. When I still had baggage when they were gone; home or to sleep, I went to my keyboard; my guitar. It's been doing me well so far.

<b>34. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most?</b> Still Zac. Nobody beats Zac.

<b>35. What political issue stirred you the most?</b> I don't even know. I didn't really follow at all this year.

<b>36. Who did you miss?</b> I miss Rob a lot, since he's in Ottawa now and we never talk. I missed Sarah a lot over the course of first semester, because our schedules conflict and we hardly saw each other at all.

<b>37. Who was the best new person you met?</b> My roomies, Amanda, Roman, and Chris. Roman and Chris don't actually live with me, of course; they're across the hall. I love Amelia, Astrid, and Jessie; my Aida vocal girls. Pretty much everybody I've met at the U has been great. 

<b>38. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2006:</b> That there are some things that just cannot be changed. Trying is one thing, but at the end of the day, you are only in charge yourself; only your own actions and reactions. You are your own responsibility. And yeah; in a way that means looking out for number one. But more than that, it means nurturing yourself. Is this what you've been trying to tell me all along? I think I'm starting to get it. 

<b>39. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year:</b> 
<i>Put to rest what you thought of me
While I clean this slate with the hand of uncertainty
So let mercy come and wash away
What I've done
I'll face myself 
And cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

For what I've done 
I'll start again
And whatever pain will come
Today this ends
I'm forgiving what I've done</i>"

So you sailed away
Into a grey sky morning
Now I'm here to stay
Love can be so boring

Nothing's quite the same now
I just say your name now

But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You don't need me back
You're just the best I ever had

And it may take some time to patch me up inside
But I can't take it so I run away and hide
And I may find in time that you were always right
You're always right

So you sailed away
Into a grey sky morning
Now I'm here to stay
Love can be so boring

What was it you wanted?

"event","I need money very, very badly.  I should never have left Chapters.  I haven't worked in three weeks.  

Upcoming Expenses:
- U Windsor Audition fee ($40)
- Jeanette-sensei Clinics in Windsor ($150)
- Terada-sensei Clinics in London: ($200)
- Aikido ($215)
- Class ring ($250)
- Prom dress ($?)

Andrew says he thinks he can get me a job waitressing at A-1.  It'd be a nice in-between-catering-gigs job, because it's easy, right down the street, and I can get instant tips.  That would be really nice.

So right now I should be writing my WC letter to the editor of the Star, or doing comprehension questions, or at least practicing my aria so I can wow Stacey tomorrow.

But instead I am doing nothing at all.  Chewing gum.  Listening to the same song and Ben playing Gunz beside me.  My parents keep calling me upstairs to talk, but I don't feel like moving yet.

Today is one of those days when I have to tell my parents to grow up.

I sort of miss writing, so here we go:

True story.  I'm at the mall, trying on a wild assortment of odd, florrid, hideous hats.  Grab one off the shelf, slap it on my head, dart to check the mirror, squint to check the price tag, and trade it for another.  With each new hat that I slip on, there's this reborn flame of hope: ""Maybe this is the one?  Maybe this one will fit?""  When I run to the mirror, my shoulders sink and the light flickers out.  Too small, too big, the color is too overwhelming.  I grimace at my reflection and my washed out face, pale with lethargy and eyes still rimmed red.  I look like disaster, like a train-wreck, like a ghost.  And it seems that no matter how many hats I try, no matter how many colours I play with, nothing quite distracts from my prematurely aged face.  I look like a child, playing dress-up and fooling no one.

And just as I'm about to give up, I see one that looks perfect.  There's that orb of light again, this time quicker, catching in my throat.  I believe it feels like that as you near the edge of utter desperation.  I know my time and patience are running out, and finding this one is a relief; no, even more - it must be fate.  I hesitate to open my eyes, but when I do I'm overjoyed.  This is exactly what I've been looking for!

I'm all smiles as I waltz to the counter to pay, thrilled at my good fortune.  Of course, then I catch the price tag.

Why do the things we want always seem to cost the most?

When I was younger, I considered myself to be a hat person.  My mother used to crown me with pink frills and wide brims, and I grew to love them.  But as I grew older and I looked at the old photographs of myself in my earlier years, I learned to be embarrassed.  What I thought looked right was so obviously wrong - didn't I see it?

I was thirteen, and I gave up those ridiculous dreams.  The quirks of a cute bucket hat.  The casual elegance of a ball cap.  The romance of a wide straw hat on a summer day.

So I guess it goes without saying that this was a bad idea from the start. 

Hats, scarves, nooses, washcloths.  

...But that's past.

How's that for a microcosm, sir?





On another note, I now know my daughter's name."

"event","I got my acceptance letter from York yesterday; for English and Professional Writing.  My mom was super excited for me, offerring to take me out to dinner to celebrate, but I declined because I'm pretty sick right now.  My dad came home and looked sheepish and said, ""Well that'll be a good back-up for you.""

I'm somewhere in between the two of them.  I'm still hoping for Laurier, but I feel as though my chances of getting in are slipping further and further down as each week passes.  My audition is March 24th.  I have no idea if I'll be ready by then.  

Not much else to report.  Dreams about stealing cars.  Mother may be beginning to see me as an adult, since she granted me permission to take the car to Detroit.  That would be pretty amazing.  Today is Rachel's birthday.  I think we're bowling, but I still have to check with Marc and find out what else is going on.

Alright, I'm gonna go shower before Aikido.

Aikido!  That's something I should talk about.

I tested for my 3rd kyu a week ago Thursday - Sensei gave me an extension because I was in Florida before.  The test went fairly well (I'm told my knife solo was deadly awesome, but I royally screwed up shomen uchi shomen irimi nage #2 on my shite waza, and I did the yonkajo throw twice on my continuation), and I got my results that very same night.  On Thursday Marc and I hung our wooden sticks on the wall.  

If there's anything that makes me hesitate in leaving Windsor, it's Seikokan.  I know, if I'm in Waterloo I can probably bus to Nic Mill's dojo once or twice a week, and if I'm in TO there's Aikido all over the place, but it won't be the same.  I really want to do my shodan here.  Casagrande and Rick are telling me to screw university.  I love it here so much, I almost want to.

Alright now, how about that shower."

"event","It's a little late, but here are my January reviews:

<b>Brave New World</b> <i> by Aldous Huxley</i>
This one took me the better part of the month to finish, because for about two weeks, I couldn't find it.  Stolen from the A-Hall Teacher's Reference closet of wonderful English novels; I didn't record it, so no one knows it's missing.  So, part of the reason I was interested in this one was because of the snippet description Mr. Carrick gave us on the day we chose our ISUs.  Anyways, it's now becomse on of my favorite books.  After readering the Handmaid's Tale, I've been looking for all the dystopian novels I can find, and this has been the most rewarding so far.  In Huxley's world, people are not born, but hatched; not raised, but conditioned.  Society is engineered so that everyone is content with their lives and circumstances, and if for a second they feel down, there's always soma - the ultimate mind-altering drug that offers just enough high to get you back on your feet.  What's scariest about this novel is that from an economical standpoint, it may be entirely possible.  Unlike Gilead of the Handmaid's Tale, which is religious, and 1984, based on extreme governmental surveillance, the Brave New World is ruled by consumerism and capitali-based goals, not unlike the world in which we live today.  The thing I found most intriguing and also the most terrifying about Huxley's creation are the hypnopaedic methods of ""teaching"" the children.  While they are sleeping, messages play over and over, as to embed societal values and even their own personality traits in their mind, at a subconscious level, in order to readily influence their conscious selves.  Some of the messages are pretty hilarious, in that they're commercials.  Slogans.  In closing, I loved it.  And in spite of all my snobby verbosity, it's a quick, easy read, as entertaining as it is thought-provoking.  5 stars.

<b>Fairest</b> <i>by Gail Carson Levine</i>
This is probably stretching the teen genre a bit; it's catalogued in the 9-12 section.  But I love Gail Carson Levine so much, that I thought I'd bend my own rules a little.  Some of you may be familiar with Levine as the author of the Princess Tales and Ella Enchanted, the ground-breaking, award-winning youth novel that inspired the horrendous Disney film.  In Fairest, Levine takes on the story of Snow White, with a few unexpected, slightly dark turns.  Her Snow White, an inkeeper's daughter named Ada, is hardly the fairest in the land.  But she does have a lovely singing voice, a gift cherished in Ayorthia, a land of singers.  By a series of chance coincidences, she finds herself attending the King's wedding, where she meets Ivy, his young, vain bride.  Its such a unique story that you almost can't tell of its basis.  My favorite thing about Gail Carson Levine is her ability to dig up real emotions in her characters.  She gets right into the head of a fifteen year old girl, and for those of us who can remember, it's heartwarming (strange to think that's already three years ago for me).  Though her writing is ageless, it's definitely a girl book, though I also would suggest it to any males who are looking for a good reading experience and want to improve characterization in their own writing.  Mind you, it is a fairy tale, written for pre-teens, so don't expect anything too profound.  A sweet story that, like all of Levine's books, are enjoyable to read over and over again. 4 stars.

<b>The Straight Girl's Guide to Sleeping With Chicks</b> <i>by Jen Sincero</i>
Finally, my free pick of the month.  Reid got me this book for my birthday, after I jokingly mentioned I wanted it.  First of all, the cover.  It has the most fantastic cover on earth.  The Venus/female symbol, with a red-painted fingernail poking through it's hole.  I'm immensely proud to own it.  All laughter aside, this is actually a how-to book, not a novel.  It's aimed at straight but hesitantly bicurious women, as the title suggests.  Sincero humourously walks you through how to know if sleeping with chicks is right for you, making your first move on a chick, how to thoroughly pleasure your chick, what toys you and your chick should try, even how to keep your relationship with your chick from getting too emotionally involved, all while firmly maintaining your heterosexuality.  After reading this book, I've decided that not only do I believe there is such a thing as bisexuality, but that sexuality is more of a spectrum than a black and white scale (If 1 is perfectly straight and 10 is perfectly gay, I'm probably around a 3).  Sincero often interrupts herself with insights from a few of the many women she interviewed in gathering information for this noble project.  To conclude, I had a good time reading this book.  I gobbled it up in about an hour because the subject matter is just so <i>interesting</i>.  I recommend it to all people, bicurious or not, female or not.  It has some pretty awesome masturbation tips if you're so inclined.  It's also the kind of book that you'd like to highlight all over and casually plant in your boyfriend's room one day, so there are definitely some aspects of the book that will benefit men.  Or guys, you could just get off in picturing your girlfriend killing herself over hooking up with a chick just like you would.  3 stars."

You sometimes go overboard in interpreting signals.<br /><br />You are deeply philosophical and thoughtful. You tend to analyze every aspect of your life.<br />You are intuitive, brilliant, and quite introverted. You value your time alone.<br />Often times, you are grumpy with other people. You don't appreciate them trying to interfere in your affairs.<br /><br />You tend to be pretty tightly wound. It's easy to get you excited... which can be a good or bad thing.<br />You have a lot of enthusiasm, but it fades rather quickly. You don't stick with any one thing for very long.<br />You have the drive to accomplish a lot in a short amount of time. Your biggest problem is making sure you finish the projects you start.<br /><br />You are friendly, charming, and warm. You get along with almost everyone.<br />You work hard not to rock the boat.

"event","<span style=""color: rgb(153, 51, 102);"">I guess its time for an update letting everyone know what I have planned the next few months if you are interested!<br /><br />So far, I&nbsp;have to clean my apartment! I have my wonderful Andrea coming down to spend some time with me here and boy, I&nbsp;need this place cleaned, straightened and stocked! Its awful... looks like a bachelor pad for sure! XD&nbsp; Totally need to fix that!&nbsp;<br /><br />We will be going to San Japan with Jamie, Sami, Jason, Edo and Gettoe! I can't wait! The line up of VAs is really amazing and with *most* of my favorite people there, I know it will be fun. (I am sad that ALL&nbsp;my favorites can't be there. I love you guys and will miss you!!!) Plus, I am also meeting my bestest friend from Jr. High out there and she has invitied us to do Ripley's Believe It or Not haunted house and the Tomb Raider ride out by the Alamo/Riverwalk on Sunday. I am THRILLED about that. I&nbsp;miss her horribly even if right now we live only 1/2 an hour apart! We work totally opposite and never see each other! So I'm excited about some of my friends getting to meet her too!!! ^_^<br /><br />After that, is going to be YaoiCon. I am excited about seeing San Fran with Andrea! We are totally getting there either early or staying late to see the sights together! And I think one day, we are going to hang with Scotty too, which will be really nice since we didn't really get to see him at AX. On top of that, Ashley and Eevee will be there with their Junjo cosplay and with them having a room and Andrea and I have one.... we are totally doing a naughty(ish) shoot! Nothing vulgar or anything, just cutesy romantic stuff. ^-^ I know I will need to bring an extra bag to cart my new novels in too. hehehe. Although, I&nbsp;AM having trouble with finding ones that don't have non-con. Its cool if thats your thing, but its a HUGE turn off for me and actually gives me nightmares. X_X<br /><br />Some point in all this my cousin is going to have a reception. She is pregnant and getting married. I wish I could meet the guy and all... kinda scout him out since I care about her so much. But I suppose thats not really my call and I have to just be happy for her. She, Paige and I all grew up together so I am kinda possessive of her just like I am of Paige. She is like a second sister and its her that looks more like me! XD<br /><br />Then in early December or late November, I am going to Vegas! Gwd, I need to saaave monnies!!! I am thinking 4 nights for two will be good. I&nbsp;have to buy tickets for the plane, Cirque, ect. and make hotel reservations. I think the Mirage will be a nice place and plus it has Japanese food AND a &quot;Bodies&quot; exhibit where you can look at corpses under glass. Soooo up my alley. I know, Im a mess! XD<br /><br />So other than that stuff, I&nbsp;am working a ton. Melissa, my coworker and friend, is gonna be out having her little one! Im thrilled for her! Bronson will be born when Andrea and I&nbsp;run to Galveston I think, so Ill be texting all day to check on her between the pyramid visits. <br /><br />And I am back to role playing and LOVING it. Ever since everything last year, I have just been writing on my own but writing with someone is totally different and makes me feel so much more creative! I hope to do more in the future... but doing this now just makes me feel so much better! ^-^<br /><br />The only current rants I have:<br />1. I have new neighbors that don't know how to STFU at night and just stare at me like morons when I tell them its after midnight and need to be quiet outside my damn window. <br />2. A certain friend's posting on LJ griping out con stuffs and other personal stuff with that person. I&nbsp;am just so frustrated now, back to square one with that person from before when I was upset. I was pissed off before and now? I am again. It makes me not even want to try to be friendly, to be honest. Which isn't fair because they have been there for me when I have gone through all this stuff last year and I&nbsp;feel I&nbsp;really owe it to them to try to be.... but right now? I just feel angry and defensive since I try so hard to be nice but feel like it is NEVER enough. I am always Eeored and feel I don't do enough or the right thing. Its just not working for me! X_X I just want to scream!!! I am SICK of feeling this way each and EVERY time we talk these days! UGH!!! <br />3. I have this girl at work that is charging over me. Don't get me wrong,... I am not ready to do that. I don't want the legal responsibility of being in charge the night a 30 weeker comes in not breathing, moving or whatever and we have to make life and death decisions based on my 1 measely year of nursing experience! BUT, it pisses me off that the girl charges over ME, who has been there longer than her in that unit AND holds a higher degree than her (my Bachelor's to her Associate) and has been at that hospital less time than me. (I have been there almost ten years people! COME&nbsp;ON!!!) Plus, shes cocky and thinks she can do no wrong. She ALWAYS&nbsp;tells me I look tired when I come in. I want to say to her &quot;You look retarded, but you dont here me telling you that everyday you come in.&quot; Srsly, shes pretty and smart, but has NO people skills whatsoever. And she doesn't really know how to work the computer system and with me being an ex-ward clerk of 3 years, I&nbsp;have it ALL&nbsp;over her. Plus, I&nbsp;know people in high places. So, why is she over me now? Cause he is sister-in-law to one of the head nurses. Pbbbbt. Whatever. I don't wanna be in charge. Its just the principle of the matter that pisses me off really.<br /><br />ANYWHO.... moving on from all that.... Less than two weeks till snuggleglompweeeee of doooooom!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^//////^&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Woot! And then everything else coming up is yea! I am going to try to either have Andrea come in for Ikkicon (I took off so far for New Year's unless we figure out you can't go... then maybe Ill try coming up there the week after and seeing you instead in LA. I could see Buffie too if I&nbsp;did that! XDDD I miss her too!) or try going to ALA (I think thats what it is) the next week. Plus, I am looking at what other conventions and stuffs I&nbsp;can go to in CA now more and more. Jamie and I&nbsp;might cosplay together and go to ComicCon next year. I dunno, we will see. And Ashley has been wanting to go sooooo badly, so yeah. I&nbsp;know that would be a winner. I just would be kinda O.o at all the stuff, but hell.... seeing celebrities, friends and all would be awesome! XDDD In addition to the cons, I&nbsp;might try traveling next summer just whereever when school is out again. I&nbsp;wanna take certain people to see certain things &gt;_&gt; so yeah. Cons might or might not happen, but still it will be fun nonetheless!<br /><br />Okay, back to cleaning for realz. Much love to all my friends on here that have been keeping up with my stories, my sillies and my rants. I thank you guys so much for all that. You are my rock and my light. I love you guys and appreciate you all so much!<br /><br />&lt;3<br /></span><br />"

We walked around and looked at the stars in front as well as tried putting our hands and feet where other famous people had left their marks in the pavement there.

I moped on the way back up to the room even though I tried to leave them with a smile. UGH. Im a dork. -sigh- Whatever... anyways...<br /><br />When I got up to the room, Edo was waiting outside since she had run downstairs during that time to get a coke. We sat on the bed and watched game shows for about an hour (And did quite well at answering the questions, thankyouverymuch!) before getting bored and hungry. After walking to SEVERAL sushi places, we found none were open. So what did we do? We went back to Little Toyko!!! YEA! We had some GREAT&nbsp;sushi, ramen and tempura. It was awesome and the scenery was great too! I really enjoyed getting to spend time doing that with Edo since we never get to just hang out the two of us.<br /><br />When we got back, Edo had to go and that left me. I packed up my stuff...&nbsp; pretty bummed about everything ending and talked to Andrea on the computer a bit before going to sleep. The night was kinda O.o since sirens and people were SO loud that night.... Guess thats what you get for being 8 blocks away from one of the biggest events in history. The next morning, I got up and headed out EARLY since I&nbsp;knew traffic would be horrible (it was) and getting a cab nearly impossible ( and it WAS!). After I got into the airport, I had to check in... this line was awful! And you have to go through security stuff TWICE. X_X&nbsp; Then my flight was really late and all.... So by the time Jamie picked me up I was really coming off my wonderful high of being with everyone. Still, when she dropped me off at Sami's house, I was offered homemade fried rice and chopsticks and just smiled. Even though I really REALLY miss being in LA.... it was kinda nice to be back in Houston and Sami's mom is always sweet. After dinner, Jamie took us over to her house and we looked at my pictures until I finally went to sleep. <br /><br />"

We all slept in pretty late since we were exhausted from everything during the week. But once we did get up and moving, Andrea put together her Sebastian cosplay and I put on my &quot;other&quot; cosplay. (Not going to elaborate). We took a shuttle to the convention and wandered around the dealer's room looking for some Yoko figurines for Andrea and a few more Hetalia things to round on the mix. At one point, we met up with Edo and Jason and walked with them too. That was nice.

"event","Yea! Third LA post!<br /><br />The fifth day was Saturday... the day of the Code Geass meet up. Andrea, Buffie and I had such a difficult time waking up that day that when we finally got dressed and out the door, we walked in on the end of it. I snapped a few photos of the group posing and whatnot and then we bolted to get food. And yes, food at that point was WAY&nbsp;more important since we hadn't really ate since Denny's tore us up the night before.

They played some preshow stuff that was interesting the first time around... but the second and third time we heard it was awful. UGH. We&nbsp; did had really good seats, but even with that... I couldn't get any really good pictures since you weren't allowed to use a flash. There were ten contestants: five va and five singing. I totally agreed with who they picked for the VA winner but COME&nbsp;ON! The singing winner was NOT who I would have gone with. This one guy who might as well been Adam Lambert totally should have won in my opinion.<br /><br /><a class=""menuTrigger hover"" title=""Click to zoom out."" href=""javascript:void(0);"" id=""zoomedLink"">             <img galleryimg=""no"" alt=""DSCN2921.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/Los%20Angeles/Los%20Angeles%20-%20Day%205/DSCN2921.jpg?t=1247194266"" id=""fullImage"" style=""width: 540px; height: 405px;"" />         </a><br /><br />Anywho... after that, we met up with Jason and Edo and walked the dealer's room (the part we missed) in addition to the artist alley. Scuttlebutt had an AWESOME Hetalia cosplay and even asked to borrow my helmet. I am totally going to send them the pics from that! All five of us had lunch in the little food court/cafe thinger at one end of the hall and shared nachos, sandwiches and most importantly... TYLENOL! After a little bit more time browsing, we headed off to the Masquerade only to find that we were once again made to STAND&nbsp;IN&nbsp;THE&nbsp;FREAKING&nbsp;HEAT!!! WTF?! That is a major fail in my book! A double fail was them showing AX backstage repeatedly. UGH. I literally howled &quot;Nooooo!&quot; after a third go around and its no surprise everyone else around us joined in. Still, we went and stayed for about an hour and a half. It was interseting and some of the costumes/skits were really well done while others weren't really up to par. I guess that can be said for any con though. <br /><br /><a id=""zoomedLink"" href=""javascript:void(0);"" title=""Click to zoom out."" class=""menuTrigger hover"">             <img style=""width: 505px; height: 380px;"" id=""fullImage"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/Los%20Angeles/Los%20Angeles%20-%20Day%205/DSCN2939.jpg?t=1247194397"" alt=""DSCN2939.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" galleryimg=""no"" />         </a><br /><br /><a id=""zoomedLink"" href=""javascript:void(0);"" title=""Click to zoom out."" class=""menuTrigger hover"">             <img style=""width: 508px; height: 383px;"" id=""fullImage"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/Los%20Angeles/Los%20Angeles%20-%20Day%205/DSCN2949.jpg?t=1247194437"" alt=""DSCN2949.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" galleryimg=""no"" />         </a><br /><br />Once we decided to head back, Jason and Edo picked us three up and drove us back to the hotel. We all got ready and went to the dance downstairs in the Westin.... which turned out to&nbsp; be a fail rave. X_X&nbsp; We stood in line no less than an hour for this thing, only to turn around and immediately leave. It was pretty lame. But the kareoke pretty close by was interesting and would have been great, if not for the lack of lyrics and rarity of songs in English. Still, I enjoyed watching what I&nbsp;did while we were there even though I would have loved to hear Andrea, Buffie and Edo sing...<br /><br />When I noticed Jason falling asleep in a chair back a few rows, I suggested we leave since it was well after midnight. Overall, I had alot of fun and for me, even just walking the dealer's roomand eating with everyone was great. ^_^ It was a long and busy but great day!<br />"

"event","Yea, post number 2 from LA!<br /><br />Ok, so day 4 for me was the second real day of the convention, aka Friday. I totally took over the bathroom that morning because I was going to be Sebastian from Kuroshitsuji. Combining nearly white base with my own base, I got some mixture that not only was super pale, but also had the staying power of Color-stay makeup. Add to that this awesome white powder Andrea lent me and I was freaking WHITE! It only worked to offset my black wig and red contacts... I LOVE this costume now! And it only got better... Andrea was my Ciel and her costume was really incredible. Even though I couldn't figure out how to pin her hat on well (sorry!!!), she still looked amazing and I was really on cloud nine with the entire cosplay! Once we got to the con, we looked for the photoshopping panel. There was something else still going on in that room, so while we waited, we took pictures. I love the way they came out!<br /><br /><a class=""menuTrigger hover"" title=""Click to zoom out."" href=""javascript:void(0);"" id=""zoomedLink"">             <img galleryimg=""no"" alt=""DSCN2765.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/Los%20Angeles/Los%20Angeles%20-%20Day%204/DSCN2765.jpg?t=1247189503"" id=""fullImage"" style=""width: 553px; height: 417px;"" /><br /></a><a class=""menuTrigger hover"" title=""Click to zoom out."" href=""javascript:void(0);"" id=""zoomedLink"">             <br /><img galleryimg=""no"" alt=""Sebbygloveoff1.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/Los%20Angeles/Los%20Angeles%20-%20Day%204/Sebbygloveoff1.jpg?t=1247189545"" id=""fullImage"" /> </a><a class=""menuTrigger hover"" title=""Click to zoom out."" href=""javascript:void(0);"" id=""zoomedLink""><br /></a><br />We staying in the photoshopping panel for a good long time and I&nbsp;even recorded it for my friend, Ashley. But the girl wasn't too much of a public speaker and it was SOOOO long, that we cut out about half an hour early. At that time, Buffie agreed to stand in line for us for Morikawa's autograph while we ran to find food. Along the way, we ran into Edo and Jason. YEA! ^_^ <br /><br /><a id=""zoomedLink"" href=""javascript:void(0);"" title=""Click to zoom out."" class=""menuTrigger hover"">             <img style=""width: 527px; height: 397px;"" id=""fullImage"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/Los%20Angeles/Los%20Angeles%20-%20Day%204/DSCN2775.jpg?t=1247189837"" alt=""DSCN2775.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" galleryimg=""no"" />         </a><br /><br />When we finally got back to where autographs, there was DRAMA. First off, Buffie was no where to been seen. It was apparent that she had been taken somewhere else for autographs and since they lead you all around that convention, you can get pretty turned around. She couldn't tell us exactly where she was. When we asked where the autographs were, Andrea and I were pushed off on different people... and NONE of them had an intelligent thing to say or knew how to help us. Finally, I got the idea to grab Andrea's pencil board and make up a story on how my friend was in line for autographs but didn't have her pencil board to get signed and wouldn't have anything to get signed if I didn't bring it right away. (Ok, this is mostly true... Buffie had nothing to get signed if I hadn't brought that board so&nbsp; yeah....). All of a sudden, the morons running the autograph lines knew not only where the people in lines where, but how to quickly get up there. X_X&nbsp; I was allowed to ride the elevator up ALONE, go INTO&nbsp;THE&nbsp;ROOM&nbsp;ALONE, and give Buffie Andrea's pencil board. And when I&nbsp;realized that I was being stopped, not for entering the room unescorted but for PICTURES, I told her I would return and promptly went downstairs to retrieve Andrea who was still standing in that stupid line they put us in. After a little convincing, I brought her upstairs with me... again with NOBODY&nbsp;stopping us, and walked her in to where Buffie was holding our places in line. But then there was another problem... we didn't have a secondary ticket for the event. WTH?! So I calmly walked up to the guy standing next to the door and explained to him that we didn't get our tickets when we came in... and we needed some. He looked at me confused a minute, but I didn't really give him a chance to think. I&nbsp;just reached in his hand, took two (ok, three) tickets and walked back where I distributed them. XDDD And after all that, as we were approaching the front of the line, they warned us that they would soon be cutting off the number of people that could go in. T_T&nbsp; Still, we just made it and we all got our stuff signed. Andrea didn't have anything since Buffie got her pencil board, so she took the DVD from my BL DVD and had him sign that to her. And with me following her immediately after that with the case, Morikawa laughed quite a bit. Still, I'm thrilled I got it signed and even more happy Andrea got things signed since I&nbsp;knew that really made her day. I was just pleased I could help out. ^-^<br /><br /><a class=""menuTrigger hover"" title=""Click to zoom out."" href=""javascript:void(0);"" id=""zoomedLink"">             <img galleryimg=""no"" alt=""DSCN2792.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/Los%20Angeles/Los%20Angeles%20-%20Day%204/DSCN2792.jpg?t=1247190499"" id=""fullImage"" style=""width: 499px; height: 376px;"" />         </a><br /><br />After that, we walked the dealer's room with Edo and Jason who had waited patiently for us to finish with all our stuff upstairs. But soon we were all pretty hungry, so we walked halfway between the convention and the hotel (about 4-5 blocks) to Denny's and had lunch. That was alot of fun... but after that? Notsomuch. The chicken on Andrea and I's salads were undercooked and we both felt pretty gross after that. We made a quick run to Famima for candy, cokes and such and then headed back to the convention for a little while since there was an improv panel I wanted to see. Needless to say, though, that didn't happen. With Andrea and I&nbsp;both feeling pretty nauseated and Jason and Edo pretty much wiped.... the five of us went back to the room instead and watched hysterical videos online until late. After Jason and Edo left, Buffie, Andrea and I went to sleep. <br /><br /><a class=""menuTrigger hover"" title=""Click to zoom out."" href=""javascript:void(0);"" id=""zoomedLink"">             <img galleryimg=""no"" alt=""DSCN2851.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/Los%20Angeles/Los%20Angeles%20-%20Day%204/DSCN2851.jpg?t=1247190760"" id=""fullImage"" style=""width: 496px; height: 374px;"" />         </a><br /><br /><a class=""menuTrigger hover"" title=""Click to zoom out."" href=""javascript:void(0);"" id=""zoomedLink"">             <img galleryimg=""no"" alt=""DSCN2854.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/Los%20Angeles/Los%20Angeles%20-%20Day%204/DSCN2854.jpg?t=1247190793"" id=""fullImage"" style=""width: 497px; height: 373px;"" />         </a><br /><br /><a class=""menuTrigger hover"" title=""Click to zoom out."" href=""javascript:void(0);"" id=""zoomedLink"">             <img galleryimg=""no"" alt=""DSCN2862.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/Los%20Angeles/Los%20Angeles%20-%20Day%204/DSCN2862.jpg?t=1247190975"" id=""fullImage"" style=""width: 500px; height: 376px;"" />         </a><br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","-slumps-&nbsp; I am finally back home from LA after a long day. Who knew when I was making these plans that 1. A VERY famous music star would have his memorial service 8 blocks away from the hotel I would be staying at and 2. that I would have such an amazing time. <br /><br />The first day I got brought to the airport early, so I hopped on an early flight that left right pretty much immediately after I got through security. ^_^ After getting to LA, I got a cab and traveled to the Westin. Man, that place is epicly huge! I got so turned around but still, so nice having a hot breakfast from the food court! XD After that, I wandered downtown a little and took pictures. When I came back, I&nbsp;wandered the hotel and to the YMCA to take more before crashing in my room. I was sooo tired from working so much so it was kinda nice to just be able to relax and catch up on sleep. <br /><br /><a class=""menuTrigger hover"" title=""Click to zoom out."" href=""javascript:void(0);"" id=""zoomedLink"">             <img galleryimg=""no"" alt=""DSCN2432.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/Los%20Angeles/Los%20Angeles%20-%20Day%201/DSCN2432.jpg?t=1247027969"" id=""fullImage"" style=""width: 350px; height: 462px;"" /><br /><br /><br /></a>The next day, Andrea and Buffie showed up bright and early and we all took a cab to the beautiful Huntington Library and Botanical Gardens. It was an amazing place and so beautiful. I am so thankful that Andrea suggested it... it was truely breath-taking. I took lots of pictures and some came out better than others but meh. The decent ones I put up on deviantart and the rest I just saved for myself. I would love to go back there and see things maybe again in the Spring since I am sure the Cherry Blossoms would be in bloom in the Japanese Gardens. <br /><br /><a id=""zoomedLink"" href=""javascript:void(0);"" title=""Click to zoom out."" class=""menuTrigger hover"">             <img style=""width: 449px; height: 338px;"" id=""fullImage"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/Los%20Angeles/Los%20Angeles%20-%20Day%202/DSCN2482.jpg?t=1247186911"" alt=""DSCN2482.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" galleryimg=""no"" />         </a><br /><br /><a id=""zoomedLink"" href=""javascript:void(0);"" title=""Click to zoom out."" class=""menuTrigger hover"">             <img style=""width: 452px; height: 340px;"" id=""fullImage"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/Los%20Angeles/Los%20Angeles%20-%20Day%202/DSCN2497.jpg?t=1247186966"" alt=""DSCN2497.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" galleryimg=""no"" />         </a><br /><br />After that, we went straight over to the convention. That... was terrible. We had to wait HOURS in the blazing sun to get our prereg badges. Poor Andrea got sunburned something awful and I just felt light-headed from the heat. It got so bad that they started handing out sunscreen. But once we were inside, it all ran smoothly. The check-in process is done on computer and you do it yourself, so its pretty fast once you finally get in! Once we finally had our badges, we started back to the hotel... but not before stopping at an ice cream shop for some quick treats. YUM! Once back at the hotel, we ate some pizza in the hotel food court and then headed back up to the room where Andrea and I watched Winter Cicada. It was so nice to have someone watch it with the same enthusiasm for the story and the characters that I do! ^-^&nbsp; So much fun!!! Late that night, around midnight, my other friends finally showed up and passed out in the room. After such a long day, it was easy for me to fall asleep. Zzzzzzzz....<br /><br />The next morning, Andrea and I dressed in our Junjo Romantica costumes. I was THRILLED with the way they came out. She made an absolutely wonderful Usagi!<br /><br /><a class=""menuTrigger hover"" title=""Click to zoom out."" href=""javascript:void(0);"" id=""zoomedLink"">             <img galleryimg=""no"" alt=""DSCN2642.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/Los%20Angeles/Los%20Angeles%20-%20Day%203/DSCN2642.jpg?t=1247187682"" id=""fullImage"" style=""width: 393px; height: 521px;"" />         </a><br /><br /> We got to the convention right when things started, but to our suprise.... there was no DMP panel! :(&nbsp; Still, we got to see Yun Kouga's panel (the mangaka for Loveless) and hear her answer questions about where she found her inspiration and such. She also asked about our opinions on a Yaoi doujin.... :D&nbsp; HECK&nbsp;YEA! Lose those ears, Ritsuka!!! (I'm bad, I know!)<br /><br /><a class=""menuTrigger hover"" title=""Click to zoom out."" href=""javascript:void(0);"" id=""zoomedLink"">             <img galleryimg=""no"" alt=""DSCN2620.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/Los%20Angeles/Los%20Angeles%20-%20Day%203/DSCN2620.jpg?t=1247187770"" id=""fullImage"" style=""width: 428px; height: 322px;"" />         </a><br /><br />After that was the panel for Toshiyuki Morikawa. OMG -swoon-&nbsp; For you that don't know, he is the voice of Sephiroth among a SLEW&nbsp;of other things. He even has done LOTS&nbsp;of dubbing for Japan of our shows. Its kinda comical to me that&nbsp; he has been Ennis (Heath Leger's charactrer) in Brokeback Mountain. Srsly... look it up. But since he IS the BL king over there, my big thing I wanted to seem him for was of course due to his work on Winter Cicada and Embracing Love as my BLfavorite character of all time. He was so entertaining and a great sport as far as catering to ANYTHING fans asked. I had an amazing time watching him work. At the end of the panel, they handed out these little blue tickets that allowed you a chance to get his autograph. -squee- <br /><br /><a class=""menuTrigger hover"" title=""Click to zoom out."" href=""javascript:void(0);"" id=""zoomedLink"">             <img galleryimg=""no"" alt=""DSCN2669.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/Los%20Angeles/Los%20Angeles%20-%20Day%203/DSCN2669.jpg?t=1247187822"" id=""fullImage"" style=""width: 391px; height: 502px;"" />         </a><br /><br /><a class=""menuTrigger hover"" title=""Click to zoom out."" href=""javascript:void(0);"" id=""zoomedLink""><img galleryimg=""no"" alt=""DSCN2670.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/Los%20Angeles/Los%20Angeles%20-%20Day%203/DSCN2670.jpg?t=1247188414"" id=""fullImage"" style=""width: 391px; height: 517px;"" />         </a><br /><br />After the panel, we walked the dealer's hall. OMG HUGE! Its like, four times the size of A-Kon's and that thing was big! They even have ATMs in there... its absolutely insane! I think we only got a little less than a third of the way around before we all started feeling the need for grub. So we ditched the con to go back to the hotel via the shuttles and proceeded across the street to Johnny Rockets for food and fun. <br /><br /><a class=""menuTrigger hover"" title=""Click to zoom out."" href=""javascript:void(0);"" id=""zoomedLink"">             <img galleryimg=""no"" alt=""DSCN2728.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/Los%20Angeles/Los%20Angeles%20-%20Day%203/DSCN2728.jpg?t=1247188630"" id=""fullImage"" style=""width: 458px; height: 344px;"" />         </a><br /><br /><a class=""menuTrigger hover"" title=""Click to zoom out."" href=""javascript:void(0);"" id=""zoomedLink"">             <img galleryimg=""no"" alt=""DSCN2730.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/Los%20Angeles/Los%20Angeles%20-%20Day%203/DSCN2730.jpg?t=1247188670"" id=""fullImage"" style=""width: 426px; height: 567px;"" />         </a><br /><br />On the way back, we stopped at this giant statue a nearby bank had outside. It was PERFECT for our Junjo cosplay. If you have ever seen the manga or anime, you know there is a part of the story where Misaki gets sent statues of bears with salmon. Well, this is exactly what the statue was! So Buffie agreed to kindly take pictures of us in our cosplays by the statue, which became some of my favorite ones. <br /><br /><a class=""menuTrigger hover"" title=""Click to zoom out."" href=""javascript:void(0);"" id=""zoomedLink"">             <img galleryimg=""no"" alt=""DSCN2737-Copy.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/Los%20Angeles/Los%20Angeles%20-%20Day%203/DSCN2737-Copy.jpg?t=1247188824"" id=""fullImage"" style=""width: 370px; height: 552px;"" />         </a><br /><br /><br /><a class=""menuTrigger hover"" title=""Click to zoom out."" href=""javascript:void(0);"" id=""zoomedLink"">             <img galleryimg=""no"" alt=""DSCN2740-1.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/Los%20Angeles/Los%20Angeles%20-%20Day%203/DSCN2740-1.jpg?t=1247188853"" id=""fullImage"" style=""width: 390px; height: 626px;"" />         </a><br /><br />After picture time, it was time to head back to the convention. The Gurren Lagann movie was debuting there and we wanted to get good seats. It was a bit dark in there, and that made me drowsy, but once it started... it was awesome! Andrea talked to me about cosplaying Yoko... might have to look into that! XD&nbsp; Thats pretty much it. After the show ended, we headed back to the hotel and I&nbsp;crashed. Soooo sleepy. <br /><br /><br />"

"event","So its been a really busy but pretty good week for me except for one tiny, or should I&nbsp;say about 50+ tiny problems: My apartment is infested with flies. Now, I'm not a dirty person nor have I failed to clean that place. Actually, I had my mom visit the other day and made sure everything was dusted and the floors were mopped before she got there. So needless to say, it was not due to food or trash. I woke up after sleeping from work and got in the shower. I was grossed out to see a few flies in the bathroom, but didnt think much of it and killed them with some tp and good ninja-like reflexes. After that, I&nbsp;went to work and when I came home, those few flies had a HUGE&nbsp;funeral procession with ALL&nbsp;its family members. I was stunned and horrified all at the same time. I have never seen so many flies. I didnt even want to breathe. ICK! I sprayed Black Flag at them everywhere and then ran to my bedroom and shut the door. Luckily they werent really in there since I&nbsp;shut my bedroom door when I leave to go to work. I slept under a mound of pillows though just to make sure they didnt land on me while I slept. When I woke up, I went ahead to the office and reported the flies to the office. They told me that they could have come in from the toilet (WTF?!) or from food. I was like &quot;This is not three flies. This is more like 300 flies!&quot; When they came, the guy said he could tell I kept my place clean and nice and he had never seen flies like that anywhere. So I sprayed again, he hung fly strips and I went to my doctor's appointment. Had to drop my sweet doggy off with my Mom so she wouldn't be around all that spray. When I got back home fro my appointment/work 18 hours later, they were pretty much all dead. Now I&nbsp;have TONS of dead flies EVERYWHERE. Its gross. I get to clean again tomorrow. Fuuuuuun.

Besides the flies, things are going well. I am going to get my hair chopped tomorrow. What color do you guys think I should do? I know Im getting it short though since its summer and Im doing a crap-load of wigs.&nbsp;

I am getting my iPhone on the 19th since thats when they release the 3Gs model. OMG soooo excited! I usually have dinky phones, so this will be the first time I&nbsp;will have a fancy one. Man, having a GPS for my lost butt will be NICE. This one will actually tell you what direction to walk. Its going to be great for walking to Little Tokyo with my girls in LA. 

Speaking of which.... 3 weeks until Day 1 of AX! Im thrilled beyond words! I FINALLY&nbsp;get to hang out with Andea and Buffie!!!! I&nbsp;think the idea is for us to go to some awesome places before and after AX and tour the sights. I&nbsp;know for sure Im gonna hit up Hollywood while I'm there and Little Tokyo (maybe more than once since its a mile from the hotel!). Plus China Town is right nex to it so YEA! I spent time last night looking at the Santa Monica pier and getting ideas on how to shoot the sunsets plus photography tips. I want to do better than my Hawaii ones for dang sure and might wind up bringing multiple cameras just in case I&nbsp;can't get my new one to take the shots I want. Definently need the tripod. I loved the pictures from under the pier. Reminds me of a peaceful reoccuring dream I have where Im walking barefoot under a pier at sunset.... I might have to try it out and see what kind shots I get! XD

Before all that happens, I'll be doing a girl's night out with Les and Melissa from work. Days does SO much together as a huge group: going to eat, bowling, ect. and we really don't get to do that kinda stuff because us three ARE the full-time night shift and its always that we are working when they do that. Soooo we are planning a girl's night just the three of us. Im thrilled. We are going to see &quot;My Sister's Keeper&quot; and eat. I still have to work that night, but I'm going to get the girl's from days to stay over for me that night for a while. (I come in super early all the time for them, so asking once isn't going to be a problem). I know we are going to have a blast. Leslie and I have been working overtime and Melissa is 7 months pregnant so much lately that the time away is welcome.

Well, thats about it for my update. Much love to all my friends. I&nbsp;miss you guys terribly and hope you all are having an awesome week!

@Ash - Hope your job is going well and you are loving the sno-cone stand. Im still gonna try to come see ya if I can before I&nbsp;fly out!

"event","This morning we had a little bit of trouble getting up. I guess we were all a little tired from the jet lag catching up with us. It took me forever to get ready in my Lelouch, but it was worth it!!! Sami gave me these AWESOME gloves to wear with it... REAL leather that fit my hands like, well gloves! After we were ready, we went down to Edo,&nbsp;Jason and Scotty's room. They were finishing getting ready still in their One Piece cosplays and such.

We all walked to the convetion center after that. It was weird walking down the road in the Zero costume... let me tell you. It probably would have been easier to wear the mask than carry it all the way, but honestly, we were all getting enough looks as it was! Anyways, when we got there we went to Opening Ceremonies. The drums and all at the beginning was really neat! Almost made me feel like we were at a luah or something. Then the voice actors came up. Vic was talking to Aaron Dismukes on the phone at SakuraCon and he held up the phone for everyone to yell hi at him.

After opening ceremoies was Briana Palencia's panel. She seems very down to earth and Sami was thrilled to get to take a picture with her since she does One Piece.

Laura Bailey's panel was next. She was so full of energy. She did raps from Kodocha, lines from FMA in Lust's voice, ect. Shes so funny.

From there we ate some quick food from the food court and took random cosplay pictures. Sami changed so that we would be both in our Geass outfits. Hard to believe she whipped up that costume from scratch in such a short time!!! WAY&nbsp;TO&nbsp;GO&nbsp;GIRL!

After walking around the dealers room (YEA&nbsp;KURO&nbsp;POSTERS!!!!) and letting my friends take LOTS&nbsp;of silly pictures in my helmet, it was time for Caitlin's panel! It was nice to get to hear her speak alone since it was the first time I had been to one that was just strictly her. She loved our Ouran group. ^_^ After that panel, I was approached by a great Suzaku cosplayer. Made me REALLY anxious to go to AX and see Andrea! He was really nice and even put on my helmet. I was a little nervous handing it over, but I love the picture of him in it so I guess it worked out okay.

Travis had his panel next. He was SOOOO hyper, just as I&nbsp;remember from all the other times! He had the crowd really riled up during the whole thing. I think my favorite parts were him eating that sushi, talking about his injury and pondering if he were a super hero. Hes SUCH a goober. Hard to believe he was Ginko in MushiShi!!!

After his panel, Sam and I&nbsp;RAN back to our room. Scotty kept up with us and went back to his room to change while Sami and I scrambled to get into FORMALS in less than 15 minutes. WHEW! Jamie showed up a little later and we all helped each other in lacing and zipping up the dresses for that night. I&nbsp;wish I had had the time to get a picture of that!!!&nbsp;XD&nbsp; Still, when Scotty showed up, Sami and I&nbsp;put on our wigs and dashed out in order to make it back to the convention in time for the concert. Along the way, Scotty let us know that we had seats waiting for us a la Michele, so we were good as long as we could get inside. 

Finally making it there..... BAREFOOT and carrying my heels in my hand, we climbed up the stairs to the convention and were promptly yelled at by the staff cause I wasn't wearing shoes. Lord. I put them on and they seemed to still be grumpy but still we found the line for Vic's concert and got in it. It was then the trouble with my bag started. I had a bag that contained my video camera, ball ticket and camera in it and I was told by staff that I couldn't take any sort of bag into the concert. I&nbsp;was PISSED. So, in my formal, I sat there and had it out with the guy, asking where in the world I&nbsp;was supposed to put it and what to do if someone wanted to go to BOTH events AND take photos at the ball. Yeah. The guy had no idea.

The next three to five people along the line also tried telling me I couldn't have a bag. Being frustrated over it, I&nbsp;just told them &quot;Fine&quot; and continued to move forward as the line started to go inside. When I&nbsp;got to the door, another person tried to stop me AGAIN. I just jerked away from them and stormed inside, calling over my shoulder that they could just talk to Vic about it and I&nbsp;was going in regardless. I think Scotty and Sami were surprised by me, but I was WAY too stressed to comply at that point. Jamie, Edo and Jason hadn't shown up yet! I spotted Michele when we went in and took a seat next to her upfront. &nbsp;Michele and I talked about how much weight I had lost... and I&nbsp;had to tell her it wasn't due to good stuff. She was so nice, sharing stories with me and such until they dimmed the lights. 

The concert started and still none of the other group was there. They wound up missing Vic singing his Tamaki song and I&nbsp;hated that. I knew they would have really loved it. Sami and I&nbsp;were thrilled to get to see FullMetal Fantasy though and Scotty appeared to be having a blast too.

After the concert, we walked with Vic and Michele to their autograph area. We met Jason and Edo out there and they agreed to stay and help if we wanted to go to the ball. WELL.... when we finally tried to go to the ball, we were told that even though we had prereg tickets, they were no good and we couldn't get in. I&nbsp;was FURIOUS! Not that I really cared about the ball, but in the principle of the matter. We had bought tickets, and now they had sold OTHER&nbsp;tickets to people and let them in instead of us. -_-&nbsp; I asked the guy at the door why that was and he backpaddled a little, saying that they figured after an hour we weren't going to show and so they gave our spots away. Me? I'm thinking.... I had a spot RESERVED that I PAID&nbsp;for.... like hell I'm just not going to show! Thats why I had a ticket reserved in the first place! The only thing he said he could do for us was give us a refund.

Jamie had shown up and heard my confrontation with the doorman and started getting upset. I was even MORE&nbsp;mad now, because they were making my friends upset. I went over to Michele and slumped down, telling her the ball was a no go. After talking to Vic for a minute, they made some calls and all of a sudden... there were more spots available!&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;_&gt; &nbsp; So Sami, Jamie and I go into the ball. WHAT&nbsp;A&nbsp;JOKE! It was a TINY room with nasty punch, a two couple dance floor and crappy music. I was in there literally, maybe a minute before I walked out. I brought Michele and Scotty some punch and asked they what they thought of it. They both said it was gross and tossed it out. So much for that.

But the autographs were right outside the room for the Butishake, so Jamie, Sami and I wound up dancing there instead. Scotty hung back and danced a little near the door watching us girl hike up our ball gowns and get down to the Japanese remixes. lol. Edo stayed with Michele and Jason helped selling CDs. After all that, we went back to the hotel and I think everyone crashed. We were so tired and our feet hurt, so it was good.

Tomorrow.... lets hope for LESS&nbsp;drama!"

I made scrambled eggs, sausage and nuked some eggo waffles. Yum. Edo and Jason came down a little after us girls had ate, so they got left overs.

Ala Moana Park is only a few blocks and about 10 minutes from our hotel, so we just walked down there even though it was cold and dreary out. We only swam for a little bit since the water was cool. I went waist deep and that was good enough for me and Sami, but Jamie went pretty far out.&nbsp; The water was really pretty though! Jason and Edo skipped stones pretty much the whole time even though we all tried to drag Edo out into the water. Sami made a character from One Piece out of sand while we were there. It was pretty nice considering she did it all by hand!<br /><span class=""outline""><img style=""width: 260px; height: 347px;"" galleryimg=""no"" alt=""DSCN0264.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/HAWAII%20-%20Day%202/DSCN0264.jpg?t=1239856221"" id=""fullSizedImage"" class=""media"" /></span><br /><br />When Scotty called and said he was at the hotel, we all cleaned up, changed and walked back to the mall and waited for him to walk there so we could have lunch. After lunch, we went to more of the ABC stores to get souvieniers and shop a while. We went back to the Japanese place again at the mall to show Scotty the awesome chairs and once again got free massages from them. I love those things!&nbsp;<br /><br /><span class=""outline""><img style=""width: 244px; height: 326px;"" galleryimg=""no"" alt=""DSCN0283.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/HAWAII%20-%20Day%202/DSCN0283.jpg?t=1239856267"" id=""fullSizedImage"" class=""media"" /></span><br /><br /><span class=""outline""><img style=""width: 435px; height: 326px;"" galleryimg=""no"" alt=""DSCN0289.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/HAWAII%20-%20Day%202/DSCN0289.jpg?t=1239856306"" id=""fullSizedImage"" class=""media"" /></span><br /><br /><span class=""outline""><img style=""width: 285px; height: 375px;"" galleryimg=""no"" alt=""DSCN0292.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/HAWAII%20-%20Day%202/DSCN0292.jpg?t=1239856324"" id=""fullSizedImage"" class=""media"" /></span><br /><br /><span class=""outline""><img style=""width: 440px; height: 329px;"" galleryimg=""no"" alt=""DSCN0312.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/HAWAII%20-%20Day%202/DSCN0312.jpg?t=1239856371"" id=""fullSizedImage"" class=""media"" /></span><br /> <br />Jason, Edo and Jamie went back to the hotel after we got done shopping and that left Scotty, Sami and I to go back to the beach to take pictures of the sunset.

The convention center is made of glass and has lots of places where its just open, so you can see the skyline really easily. It even had palm trees right in the middle, so I took pictures of that too. The check in process went pretty fast. Sami won $2 off a T-shirt.

"event","So we finally made it to HAWAII!!!!!<br /><br />The flight went well, albeit REALLY bumpy. The turbulance over California was so bad that it woke me up from a dead sleep but also dumped Sami's drink in the process. Still, it was fun. We managed to move our seats once we checked in so that Jamie, Sami and I all got to sit together. The plane gave us free headphones since we didn't take off on time (which just gave us more time to listen to J-Pop). Sami and I&nbsp;are such geeks... we heard the Code Geass opening and jammed.... people including Jamie just staring at us when we were laughing and dancing in our seats on the runway!<br /><br />When we arrived, we called Jason and Edo to find they were waiting at baggage claim for us. YEA!!! So we rushed down, got our baggage and headed out to the shuttle. It took a while for us to reach our hotel, so we cut up, talked, and took pictures along the way. We saw a TON of ABC stores though the windows. Its worse than freaking Wal-Mart!!!

They were GOOOOOOD!<br /><br /><span class=""outline""><img class=""media"" id=""fullSizedImage"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/HAWAII%20-%20Day%201/DSCN0091.jpg?t=1239854440"" alt=""DSCN0091.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" galleryimg=""no"" style=""width: 402px; height: 301px;"" /></span><br /><br /><span class=""outline""><img class=""media"" id=""fullSizedImage"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/HAWAII%20-%20Day%201/DSCN0102.jpg?t=1239854479"" alt=""DSCN0102.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" galleryimg=""no"" style=""width: 402px; height: 301px;"" /></span><br /><br /> After we ate, we played around... looking at the Koi ponds, enjoying the cool air from the open sky above us and took lots of pictures. We ended up at this Japanese place that is like, three stories tall and ran amok. They had SO&nbsp;much stuff that it took us hours to get through it all. The bottom floor was like a flea market and the second floor had anime kinda stuff with manga and whatnot. <br /><br /><span class=""outline""><img class=""media"" id=""fullSizedImage"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/HAWAII%20-%20Day%201/DSCN0128.jpg?t=1239854510"" alt=""DSCN0128.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" galleryimg=""no"" style=""width: 426px; height: 319px;"" /></span><br /><br />They had the best massage stuff up there too, so we sat in the chairs and got free little massages. They squeeze you everywhere, including our butts, so theres all these pictures of us laughing and cringing as it worked. I laughed until I cried at all of us.<br /><br /><span class=""outline""><img class=""media"" id=""fullSizedImage"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/HAWAII%20-%20Day%201/DSCN0151.jpg?t=1239854544"" alt=""DSCN0151.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" galleryimg=""no"" style=""width: 384px; height: 288px;"" /></span><br /><br /><br /><span class=""outline""><img class=""media"" id=""fullSizedImage"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/HAWAII%20-%20Day%201/DSCN0137.jpg?t=1239854583"" alt=""DSCN0137.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" galleryimg=""no"" style=""width: 346px; height: 461px;"" /></span><br /><br /><br /><span class=""outline""><img class=""media"" id=""fullSizedImage"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/HAWAII%20-%20Day%201/DSCN0131.jpg?t=1239854612"" alt=""DSCN0131.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" galleryimg=""no"" style=""width: 359px; height: 478px;"" /></span><br /><br />After that, we left because we were all so tired and needed to unpack. Along the way we ran to the beach and took a few pictures of the sunset. The sky was this really pretty purple and hot pink. I wish I knew how to work my camera better so I could have taken better pictures. Along the way back, we stopped by one of the ABC stores and got groceries so I could cook breakfast in the morning. I got eggs and sausage but I still need to see if I can get a skillet and a few bowls from downstairs because this place is really skimpy on what they give you in your kitchenette. <br /><br /><span class=""outline""><img class=""media"" id=""fullSizedImage"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/HAWAII%20-%20Day%201/DSCN0174.jpg?t=1239854649"" alt=""DSCN0174.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" galleryimg=""no"" style=""width: 380px; height: 285px;"" /></span><br /><br /><span class=""outline""><img class=""media"" id=""fullSizedImage"" src=""http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l139/AngelWingsBSN/HAWAII%20-%20Day%201/DSCN0188.jpg?t=1239854669"" alt=""DSCN0188.jpg picture by AngelWingsBSN"" galleryimg=""no"" style=""width: 374px; height: 280px;"" /></span><br /><br />The girls are asleep and I need to unpack. Tomorrow is when we are going to the beach. Hopefully we still get too because it was really overcast today!"

My day started at 3:30am at JC Penny, getting some bras (yes, the nearly boobless still need bras, darn it!) and a new jacket since my black one has white junk all down it. Then Mom and I went to Sears for some SD card and then to Target for my sister's Christmas gift and some new sheets, thanks to some birthday money!&nbsp; -grins at how luxurious the sheets feel- After that I went to Express and got some jeans and dress slacks. -sighs- I wish I didnt have to spend that kinda money on pants... Im a size 2 now. -_-&nbsp; So my 12s, 10s and 8s from earlier this year look like clown pants. I only bought 4s though, I am hoping that they will fit and my 6s from a couple months ago will all fit better soon enough.<br /><br /><img height=""240"" width=""320"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/angelwingsbsn/pic/0000d7aa/s320x240"" /><br /><br /><br />Well anywho... Thats about it for today. Only have one baby here at work so I suppose Ill work on scheduling myself some more days and maybe finish that last book I have in my series. -shrugs- We'll see how productive I feel... lol.<br /><br />Night!<br /><br />Angie<br />"

See pics above for me. We were dressed by an Indian woman who loaned us her Saris. They are pretty! I LOVED&nbsp;the dancing, man! I&nbsp;have always loved dance and this just makes me want to learn even more! It was cool and informative. Yea!<br /><br />So thats that. More update tomorrow. Im tired and thinking that since the internet keeps killing me off, Ill just call it a night.<br /><br />Angie<br /><br />"

It was interesting but a little old hat for me and the rest of us at our table. We just sat in the background and chitchatted about things as part of the walla and then had to act excited about halfway through. Its was nice to see people I hadn't seen in a while: Pyro, Sami, Edo, Melissa, John, and Alex... And Tiffany Grant was in the commerical too. I guess her and Vic both flew in as well as Edo. Anywho... we sat around and laughed as we flicked lima beans at each other between takes and I filmed bits and pieces behind the scenes. Pyro and Edo had speaking parts (woot!) since they were dressed in their Ouran cosplays and Sami sat with me and I watched her draw chibi Vics as he did crazy things. Very funny.<br /><br /><br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/angelwingsbsn/pic/00005611/""><img height=""240"" border=""0"" width=""180"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/angelwingsbsn/pic/00005611/s320x240"" /></a></div><br /><br />After that, we went back to Pyro's and watched Ouran. That was alot of fun. We watched the outtakes and ROFL'd as we ate cake. I wish I&nbsp;had pics of Edo eating cake in front of the tv, still dressed as Huni. ^_^ But alas, I was tired and just ate my own piece. It was nummy&nbsp;(my favorite: chocolate cake with the chocolate whipped cream icing... OMG yea!). I got asked if I&nbsp;would crossplay with them as Tamaki... that was really exciting. I&nbsp;have been wanting to crossplay, so that will be really fun! I need a couple new costumes so that will give me a costume to track down. Im thinking I want to do one more, but we shall see where the money thing takes me. lol. <br /><br />Guess thats about it. Nothing too big.

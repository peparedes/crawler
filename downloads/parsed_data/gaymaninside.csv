"event","So since I just got a new piercing (go look on twitter or on fb!) and Melissa's recent posts about tattoos, I'm going to do a revised/expanded tattoo/piercing post!

<lj-cut text=""Oh my gods so many pictures"">


Piercings:

I currently have: 00g lobes
                  right side lip 
Still want: left side lip (my other one is perfectly positioned for snake bites)
            second right lobe 
            tongue
            possibly left side nose (single or double)

Tattoos:

This would be a chest piece, from one shoulder to the other. I would be replacing the stupid looking hearts with classic birds, like the ones Kitty has on her shoulders. The flowers would be blue (forget-me-nots), and the leaves are green maple leaves, and inside the book will be written ""How now, Spirit! Wither Wander You?"" which is a line from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. I don't know what font I'd use, I'm still trying to figure that out. The tattoo is symbolic of my childhood: when there were maple trees and forget-me-nots in our front garden, when my mom had a glass blue bird on the kitchen windowsill, and when A Midsummer Night's Dream was my favourite Shakespeare play (I still love it, but it isn't my favourite one anymore)

I've already put this one in my older post, but I thought I'd put the phoenix in again. I would change the head slightly, so that the neck curves upward in a more triumphant pose, with a small crest on its head. This would be a back piece, the wings framing my left shoulder blade and the tail dropping all the way down to my tailbone. I would be getting it in colour, with a red/orange gradient with the very edges being purplely. This tattoo is a symbol of compassion/forgiveness/new chances at life, the belief that you may have to burn but you can always begin again and leave your ashes behind you.

I am getting this, hopefully at the end of this summer, on my right thigh. The whole lyric is ""Things have changed for me, and that's okay"" and it's from Panic! At the Disco. It basically is a reminder to myself that it's okay to not know what's going to happen to you years and years in the future, that it's okay to just live in the moment and be open to change. 

Another one I want to get I'm not sure where I'll get it, probably on my left shoulder/wrapped around my upper arm/bicep, and it will be a golden snitch that is a mix between these two designs: 

The pattern on the ball of this image 


<img src=""http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/023/5/a/snitch_by_platypusswings-d37w9cy.jpg"" />

and the wings and positioning (i.e. facing forward with wings stretched out) of the bottom snitch in this image, except the top part of the wing would be perfectly curved and not have that stupid looking dip thing
<img src=""http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/191/b/2/golden_snitch_by_alzhorse-d3lmwmo.jpg"" />

The ball would have outlines in darker yellow/gold, and the body in a lighter yellow/gold. The wings would be outlined in either black of a lighter blue, with white ink inside the wings because white ink is awesome. Across the top, running along atop the wings and ball would be ""I solemnly swear I am up to no good"" and under the ball would be ""mischief managed"". I actually would ideally like to get this as a tramp stamp, but I'm not sure how that'd work with the phoenix tail. Harry Potter, and in particular HP fanfiction has played a huge part in my life, and was basically all that kept me sane and not suicidal through high school and the years of isolation caused by somewhat negligent parents and having crippling social anxieties that are directly in conflict with being an extrovert who NEEDS to be around people. 

Somewhere, not sure where, I want to get a small ""DFTBA"" tattoo. It stands for ""Don't Forget to be Awesome"", which whether or not I am still in the community it comes from, the Nerdfighter community, it's still a message I will always want with me.


I would also want to get a very, very simple Labrys on my inner right ankle, which for me symbolizes both my love for the ancient cultures it was used in and also the feminism/LGBTQ bent that it has taken in modern times. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labrys"">Wiki page about the Labrys</a> It would just be an outline, nothing fancy. Like so, except less janky looking: <img src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/twitpic/photos/large/367033304.png?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJF3XCCKACR3QDMOA&amp;Expires=1312736067&amp;Signature=3%2F%2FBG8FsWFfh1sVwSME%2FCimUokY%3D"" />



<img src=""http://th01.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2011/107/a/7/bass_clef_by_tonyalbuquerque-d3e8xal.jpg"" />


And finally, I would want to get one of these designs done on my inner left ankle. The patterns all hide a bass clef inside of them. Music has played such a huge part in my life, and bass clef is a better representation of me because of having been a cellist for so long. I'm still not sure which of these designs I would use, but definitely one of them.

"event","Hey All,

I'm listening to the audio book for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in preparation for/celebration of Pottermore, and there's a few things which don't make sense. I decided to point them out, and then try and give explanations if I can think of some.


1. Why doesn't McGonagall seem to recognize Dumbledore's lemon drops in the first wizard scene of the book, when they're portrayed as a constant in the books, and Dumbledore doesn't seem to have just discovered them?

Possible Answer: ???

2. How does Tom, and the other wizards who say hi to him on the street while he's still with the Dursleys, recognize Harry when he's been out of circulation since he was a baby? Especially when Draco and the Weasleys don't recognize him?

Possible Answer: Simply a matter of whether or not his scar was showing?

3. How does Hagrid do wordless magic without specific wand motions when he was expelled after 3rd year?

Possible Answer: ??? 

4. How does Hagrid disappear in a blink of an eye when he puts harry on the train back to the Dursleys?

Possible Answer: He apparated. However, this doesn't make sense. Even if he is allowed to use some magic to deal with picking up/helping out Harry, he wouldn't have been allowed to get an apparating license if he'd been expelled for (SPOILER) killing someone (Moaning Myrtle) (even if he didn't actually do that, we don't know that yet.

5. How come Dumbledore didn't realize that Quirell was possessed by Voldemort when he came back from his sabbatical? The way Hagrid describes it to Harry, it sounds like Quirell had been teaching again for a while before Harry got there. It would seem that Dumbledore would at the very least be seriously concerned if one of his long-time professors suddenly became rather squirrely.

Possible Answer: ???

6. It's unlikely that there are so many phoenixes, unicorns, and dragons in the world for each one to give something for a wand only once, so why is it that the whole brother-wands-can't-fight-each-other seems like such a new and weird thing?

If any of you can think of any answers I haven't figured out, or can think of other questions I missed, feel free to comment!

EDIT: Sorry, numbers were wonky!"

"event","Maybe I&#39;m being selfish. Maybe I&#39;m being self-centered and inconsiderate by being incredibly, unspeakably hurt by the current situation in my life. I like to think I try really, really hard to make people happy, to be there for my friends when they need me. At least I like to think that. I&#39;d gotten that impression from being called a Saint and a Llama Herder so many times.

One of my greatest fears has always been being not wanted. Not even abandonment, exactly, because it&#39;s a fear that stems from being a child, sitting at the top of the slide at the back of the playground singing to myself because no one wanted to play with me. I want to be wanted, or at least for it to matter if I&#39;m not there, for people to notice, people to care, people to want me to be around. I try really hard to give people reasons to keep me around.

I feel like I&#39;m being like Bl saying that I&#39;m hurt that one mistake seems to be enough to negate how hard I&#39;ve tried to be a good friend. But I can&#39;t put it into words that sound less self-aggrandizing. I&#39;ve said many times that I wouldn&#39;t know what to do without A in my life. And I don&#39;t. I&#39;m falling apart. It sounds stupid, that getting the cold shoulder from a friend can make me cry myself to sleep some nights. But it does. But I don&#39;t know what to do. I tried to apologize, but I&#39;ll be honest, I didn&#39;t do a very good job of it because I was/am angry at A for the aggressive behavior, having been given a cold shoulder before I even know what I&#39;d done to deserve it. I understand a little now why, but that still doesn&#39;t make it feel like that should be okay with me. I feel like I should stand up for myself, that it should be okay for me to let her know that she hurt me. But at this point I don&#39;t want to. I&#39;m sorry. I just want to stop feeling like I&#39;m worthless, I want my bb back."

&quot;Te amo, te amo,&quot; she says to me
I hear the pain in her voice
Then we danced underneath the candelabra, she takes the lead
That&#39;s when I saw it in her eyes, it&#39;s over

Then she said &quot;te amo&quot;
Then she put her hand around my waist
I told her no, she cried &quot;te amo&quot;
I told her I&#39;m not gonna run away, but let me go

My soul is awry, without asking why
I said, &quot;te amo, wish somebody&#39;d tell me what she said&quot;
Don&#39;t it mean &quot;I love you&quot;?
Think it means &quot;I love you&quot;
Don&#39;t it mean &quot;I love you&quot;?

Te amo, te amo, she&#39;s scared to breathe
I hold her hand, I got no choice
Pulled me out on the beach, danced in the water, I start to leave
She&#39;s begging me and asking why it&#39;s over

Then she said &quot;te amo&quot;
Then she put her hand around my waist
I told her no, she cried &quot;te amo&quot;
I told her I&#39;m not gonna run away, but let me go

My soul is awry, without asking why
I said, &quot;te amo, wish somebody&#39;d tell me what she said&quot;
Don&#39;t it mean &quot;I love you&quot;?
Think it means &quot;I love you&quot;
Don&#39;t it mean &quot;I love you&quot;?

Listen we can dance, but you gotta watch your hands
Watch me all night, I&#39;m movin&#39; to the light because I understand
That we all need love and I&#39;m not afraid
I feel the love, but I don&#39;t feel that way

Then she said &quot;te amo&quot;
Then she put her hand around my waist
I told her no, she cried &quot;te amo&quot;
I told her I&#39;m not gonna run away, but let me go

My soul is awry, without asking why

Personal Analysis:

If I were ever to tell Kitty how I felt, I feel like this song would exactly describe the situation. There would be pain in my voice when I told her, because this can be painful at times, as evidenced by the fact that I cried for three hours straight after discovering this song. Also, I have the fear that the current closeness we share would have to go, by her decision, because it&#39;s not healthy or fair to me. She&#39;d do it for my own good, I guess. No hard feelings about it, just she&#39;s not going to indulge me in hurting myself over her.

I would say &quot;I love you&quot; to her, and I probably would touch her affectionately, as I do on a regular basis, including putting my hand around her waist. I don&#39;t think she would run away completely (as is one of my greatest fears associated with the situation of her finding out that I&#39;m in love with her, and that I don&#39;t just love her), but she would definitely be firm in that I can&#39;t cling to her/hold on to her.

I think while she would never admit it, there would be at least some ambiguous feelings on her part on the situation. Also, I don&#39;t think Kitty actually knows what love is, not the kind that I feel for her. That might be horrible of me or I might just not know about it if she does/has experienced that kind of love, but I don&#39;t think she really understand what love means, at least in this sense.

I <i>would</i> be scared to breathe, afraid of the consequences of telling her. Because she does love me, even though not in the way I wish she would, she would probably comfort me, especially if I cried. If we were doing something which she at some point realized was probably too intimate/romantic she would leave (that particular situation, not in general), and I would probably be hurt and protest, asking her why the fact that I told her had to change how we interacted with one another.

I can dance with her, I can spend all my time with her, but I can&#39;t touch her, claim her as mine, she would enforce that distance (in as nice a way as possible, but enforce it regardless). She wouldn&#39;t hold it against me, and wouldn&#39;t reject me because she understands that feelings aren&#39;t something we can always control and that everyone needs to be loved. There&#39;s no way she could fail to notice the manifestations of how I love her, especially after I had told her that I was in love with her, but she doesn&#39;t feel that way. Apologetic, but won&#39;t change how she feels because she just doesn&#39;t feel that way about me.

I think that aspect is what made me cry. The part of this song/situation that is so sad is that it <i>isn&#39;t</i> horrendously sad. She understands, and wouldn&#39;t cast me aside or be horrible to me. But it&#39;s just never going to be that way between us, period, and there&#39;s nothing that can be done about it. It&#39;s the hopelessness of the situation, while at the same time not being something that can healed. You have to be hurt, actually grievously injured before you can heal from that hurt, but if there&#39;s never an actual hurt to heal, the hopelessness just remains, the situation in stasis just short of what is desired."

"event","It&#39;s probably just because I&#39;m very, very tired, but I&#39;ve been hit with one of those episodes where I feel like I&#39;m a completely worthless person, and rather than lying awake for several hours while I cry and try to be silent enough to not wake Kr, I came down to the kitchen to just write it out, get it out of my head, and hopefully set it enough to rest to be able to fall asleep.


Despite the fact that several of the people I&#39;m close to, like A and Kr, are my age, I feel like I&#39;m a baby in my friends group. I&#39;m actually younger than K&#39;s sister. Only by a few months, but still, she made the exact point that I&#39;m younger than her sister. It&#39;s hard to feel like you deserve to be treated as an equal by people you care about and respect as much as I do for K when you&#39;re younger than their crazypants sibling(s). Also because of being isolated so much before, I know so little, about so few things. I do enjoy listening to people talk about things they know lots about and love, but it&#39;s still depressing to realize you CAN&#39;T contribute, even if you wanted to, because you have never heard half of the things they&#39;re going on about.

After having listened to K and Mis talk all last night, and then her and Kr&#39;s younger brother this evening...they&#39;re all really brilliant, interesting people who have a lot to say and know so much. I&#39;m so stupid and uninteresting and boring. When Js and K came over to have dinner with Kr, her brother, and I, I felt like such a fifth wheel-- not because K was flirting with Kr&#39;s brother, but just because they were having such a great time talking avidly and rapidly about subjects I didn&#39;t have a hope in hell keeping up with them in. I retreated to the kitchen and did dishes and ended up crying silently on the kitchen floor while listening to my comforting/sad-songs-soundtrack on my iPod.I don&#39;t know right now why anyone enjoys spending any time with me, other than perhaps because I&#39;m either quiet enough to not have it matter one way or the other if I&#39;m there or not, or maybe sometimes as comic relief because I say and do stupid shit.

This feeling is only reinforced by how badly I&#39;m doing in school. How much work and time goes into writing a paper, and how much I need my friends to motivate me to do it. How much I feel like I don&#39;t know anything and I shouldn&#39;t even speak because I&#39;ll just show everyone how empty headed I am every time I listen to K, A, or Dan Rivers argue something in a class. How I managed to not only not send a paper I thought I&#39;d sent, but that I accidentally deleted the most recent copy of it and have to go back and rewrite huge chunks of it because I only have the crappy first draft version left. This was a paper I had an extension on until this past Monday. I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m going to explain this to my professors without it sounding like a lie. I haven&#39;t contacted them yet because I just don&#39;t know what to say and am sort of despairing.

I&#39;m terrified of doing so badly in school that I&#39;m forced to drop out of Smith, and then I&#39;ll have to go back home. I can&#39;t emotionally handle that, as much as I&#39;m struggling being here. I don&#39;t want to go back to Chicago and leave K and A and Kr and Jk and Js, those people I love and rely on. And I feel like that&#39;ll just prove I&#39;m too stupid to stay here.

I&#39;m ugly. I&#39;m short and chubby and have spots on my face and an unimpressive chest and have really plain and boring features. I hang around so many beautiful people who everyone has crushes on, and I feel worthless and unattractive next to A with her beautiful princess hair and pretty eyes, and Js who also has princess hair and is generally dashing, and Jk and K and Kr and lots of other people in SSFFS. I may be prettier than some people (like Kt. Urgh.) but...It doesn&#39;t surprise me that K isn&#39;t in to me. When people who are close to me try and reassure me that I am attractive and wantable I can&#39;t help but think they&#39;re just saying that because they love me and want me to feel better. I want to stop eating so I get less fat, but then when I&#39;m depressed or stressed I end up eating to make myself feel better, and I get paranoid about not eating because too many of my friends have/have had eating disorders for me to be able to get away with it. They&#39;d force me to eat and then I&#39;d just feel ashamed of both my body AND for having tried to do something that I know isn&#39;t healthy for me and getting caught in the act.

I&#39;ve figured out why I tend to get so upset when I&#39;m sobering up, especially when it involves K doing silly things that are a tiny bit inconsiderate. I figured it out by the fact last night I was fine, but spent the entire time I was sobering up with my head in K&#39;s lap while she finger-combed through my hair over and over while she talked to Mis. And how I used to get super physically affectionate and touchy and cuddly after sex with Navy Boy. When I&#39;m coming down off of things I&#39;m emotionally more vulnerable, and less in control of my emotional need for affection. Basically I turn into an affection-starved cuddle whore when I&#39;m sobering up. I need cuddles and affection and so each time that I&#39;ve ended up being isolated before I was sobered up and/or K did something that hurt me for one reason or another, it hits really hard.

And of course there&#39;s always the emotional tangle of dealing with shit with K, even if things are about as good as I ever expect them to be with her right now.I&#39;m just really emotionally strung out right now, I guess. When K and Js left, K didn&#39;t even look at me and they both high-tailed it out, just shouting &quot;bye&quot; back through the door as I was trying to speed-wash some cups so I could get a hug from K. It feels ridic that the fact that I didn&#39;t get a hug made me want to burst out into tears, and that I ended up hiding in Kr and my room while Kr and her brother watched fringe in the living room so that I wouldn&#39;t end up accidentally crying in front of them and having to try and explain all of this. I really see Kr and by extension her brother as siblings--I love them, particularly Kr, but as much as I love her I don&#39;t feel comfortable with talking to her about some of my emotional shit that I feel more safe talking to A or Jk with."

In that way that I&#39;m not actually angry, I&#39;m just really hurt and don&#39;t know how to accept that/deal with it. I AM upset with A--but not because of A. It&#39;s more of a I blame K thing, because not only has she done things that betrayed my trust in her on a regular basis, but this time she was directly involved in the only instance that I have felt vaguely betrayed/hurt by something A did. I don&#39;t really blame A at all, because with all the shit she&#39;s been having to deal with, and K definitely orchestrated that situation."

"event","Well, I&#39;m about to make one right now. I need to just not drink with K. It&#39;s tons of fun, but there&#39;s always something that happens that leaves me miserable at the end of the night. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s that I&#39;m just generally super cranky when I&#39;m sobering up, or what. I guess my emotional tenderness for her comes out more when I&#39;m less inhibited, and so I&#39;m more vulnerable to any sort of rejection? It really doesn&#39;t help that she was like &quot;you should go to bed&quot; to me, and since I can&#39;t really go to bed until I&#39;ve had enough water to not have a killer hangover, I&#39;ve just been sitting by myself in the Sessions living room. When I went to the bathroom, K and A were having quite a ball. The crack-monkey giggle was featured. I don&#39;t really know if I have any right/whether it&#39;s reasonable to be a bit hurt/feel frustrated, because it&#39;s not like they&#39;re doing it on purpose or anything. A was really worried throughout the night, because I have been being a bit distant, and it was really sweet of her to be concerned. I don&#39;t really know why I&#39;m doing it, especially since right now I&#39;m really desperate for affection. I think it&#39;s a subconscious defense to the emotional kicking (however basically self-inflicted it&#39;s been) from/about K, I&#39;m pulling away from A too. It doesn&#39;t make any sense logically, but emotions aren&#39;t exactly logical creatures, are they?"

"event","So I don&#39;t really know what&#39;s the deal lately, but I&#39;ve been longing to make gestures of affection towards someone, anyone at all. They&#39;re romantic, in a way, but at the same time not--because I do these things with people I am not romantically attracted to, but love very deeply in some other way. So I guess they&#39;re just loving gestures. My brain decided to do an outpouring for me of these gestures:


To rest my forehead against yours, and to brush noses softly
To cup my hand around your neck and pull you close to me
To run my fingers through your hair
To brush it back from your lovely eyes and tuck it gently behind your ear
And to trail those fingers down your neck to rest over the heart beneath your breast
To wrap my arms around you and sway softly side to side
And to press tender kisses to your shoulders
To whisper sweet names and murmurs of affection into your skin
And to punctuate my praises with the press of my lips
To caress the lines of your face
And memorize your features with my eyes
To hold you when you cry
And dance with you when you laugh
And rest softly with you when you are weary
To brush my eyelashes against your skin in whispery kisses
To share all of my secrets and my fears with you
And to share all my joys with you
And to have you share those things with me
To sit quiet and close to you without expectation
And to be a comfort to you when you do not yet know you need the comfort
To kiss you with tenderness and love, with playful affection
And to soothe away all your aches and pains as best I know how"

"event","So the first thing I put on this list is something that in itself is inconsequential, but has influenced further interactions I&#39;ve had with people.

<lj-cut text=""Oh the drama of primary school!"">

There was this kid in the Fourth grade named Justin Stern who I had the silliest crush on, and I sent him a &quot;valentine gram&quot; on valentine&#39;s day. I was very nervous about doing so, so I even disguised my handwriting as best I could. He still managed to figure it out.

Now, this wouldn&#39;t have been so bad, even if he had been...well, a fourth grade boy who thought all girls had cooties. But not only did he figure out that the valentine was from me, he proceeded to announce that I had sent it to him, read it aloud to the entire class, and got the entire lot of them (including my so-called friends) to laugh at me until I fled the classroom.

I have never been the one to make the first move with anyone since, and have really nasty rejection issues. This has continued to be an issue up into present day, where I find it really hard to 1)tell people how I feel about them, 2)trust people to not cast me aside automatically if they don&#39;t feel the same as I do, or 3)be able to handle it maturely when someone I care about rejects my affection (whether that affection happens to be sexual or platonic).

I even lied the first time my first boyfriend DJ asked if I liked him, and ended up waiting a whole &#39;nother year before we got together.

Not that it has any direct relevance, but for the sake of a time line, I&#39;ll mention I started homeschooling again after that year. I&#39;d started homeschooling halfway through the third grade, but had fought with my mother so much she sent me back to public school halfway through the fourth grade. I resolved to figure out some way to get along with my mother no matter what after that because with the combination of the teasing, back-stabbing/catty friendships, and then finally the thing with Justin, there was no fucking way I was going to stick around in public school.</lj-cut>"

"event","I just...I&#39;m still not doing well. I&#39;m really really really stressed out. I nearly had a panic attack in the middle of my lab class today, just because Gary (my prof, but also happens to be my advisor) gave me an odd look. I&#39;m freaked out and I&#39;m trying really hard to not bother people &#39;cause I know everyone else is really stressed too.

but I just really wish.....I keep wanting to touch her, or hug her really tight. I keep having a really strong urge to put my arm around her waist when just standing there next to her. It was most ridiculous this afternoon in Seelye basement when she was telling me about something (It was about the Mormon post she made I think, or something that emphasized how she can be awesome in the most eccentric ways sometimes) where I really really wanted to kiss her, that sort of thing I do with you sometimes where it&#39;s like I&#39;d be saying &quot;oh Kitty, you&#39;re silly and awesome and I love you&quot;. More than anything I just want an honest to goodness snuggle/cuddle from her. But I&#39;m terrified to even ask for a bloody hug.

I&#39;m just pretty sure what I want is more than she&#39;s comfortable with, but I&#39;m in the realm of I /need/ it from her. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve noticed, but I&#39;ve been getting more touchy with everyone lately, including Becca and Liz and Kiersten as well as with you and Jayke and Kitty. It&#39;s because the more stressed out I get, the more I just /have/ to touch people or I&#39;ll just fall apart. And you and Jayke and Kitty are the three I trust the most and so seek out the most for touch and comfort and you two are basically all that&#39;s keeping me standing but I really need Kitty too to be able to actually stand and get past this rough spot, y&#39;know? And I hate being a burden and asking, but I feel more comfortable asking you and Jayke because you&#39;ve been here for me again and again and never let me down but because of all that has happened with Kitty and her general tendency towards flakiness I&#39;m terrified to ask her for that sort of support.

I can&#39;t ask for anything she doesn&#39;t want to give and doesn&#39;t give freely. I just need to suck it up and act like an adult and keep myself standing instead of bugging you all. I&#39;m sorry to bother you with this stuff. I&#39;m just being silly and over emotional because it&#39;s late, I&#39;ll get over myself.


Amalia, I&#39;m in tears just talking to you about it, I just...I can&#39;t. This is one of the reasons I end up in these situations where I&#39;m totally overwhelmed, because I wont ask for help unless I&#39;m absolutely, 100% positive the answer will be yes because being that vulnerable and working up the huge amount of courage it take s for me to be able to actually reach out and ask for what I need and then being told no, being rejected at all /destroys me/.


It&#39;s like reaching out my hands asking for someone to help me stand up off the ground and being told no/someone refusing to offer a hand and it makes me pull my arms back in on myself and rock and like I don&#39;t deserve it and need to stop asking anyone at all for it and I should just stay on the floor until I can get up by myself

I know, and I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re here bb. I really would not be dealing with this as well as I have been without you. I&#39;m just so bad off right now I need/want all three of you. It&#39;s taking a lot to admit that I&#39;m really this bad off, because I shouldn&#39;t be so weak, but I have to be honest with you at the very least.

I&#39;m doing poorly in both my math classes already, and every time I try to buckle down and try to do the work it&#39;s so hard I end up freaking out and have to go do something else. I&#39;m terrified of going in and talking to Gary, because I really respect him and don&#39;t want him to be disappointed in me. I feel guilty and horrible and like a bad person and student because I&#39;m not keeping up with my readings for vampire, and I haven&#39;t kept up with a lot of the SWAG readings which is even more of a &quot;I&#39;m a failure&quot; feeling because I REALLY respect Dan and love his class. I&#39;m terrified and embarrassed about my SWAG paper because it was really poorly written and I had to ask Dan for help and that was scary and I still need to email him to ask when he can help me. I&#39;m really sensitive and don&#39;t take critique very well but know I need it so I&#39;m really apprehensive about him helping me learn how to write better.


I have to go face my calc prof to pick up my exam which I failed, which also freaks me out because I also really respect her and feel like I failed her. I still have to go meet disabilities services, and I&#39;m having to keep track of all of this paper work and arrangements with my therapist and taxes and the summer research stipend thing and disabilities services and the beds and the room thing and asking for help from people is terrifying and I hate it and it freaks me out and I&#39;m forcing myself to do it a lot right now and it&#39;s making me freak out.
and I&#39;m trying to force myself into being able to express my emotions but I don&#39;t know how to do it right because I&#39;m so used to suppressing shit so now I&#39;m stuck in between feeling my emotions intensely and actually having them instead of being relatively steady and calm most of the time and not being able to bring myself to inflict it on other people. I keep trying to reach out, but the littlest things make me pull it all back in a shut down.
and I&#39;m trying to reach out and trust people but it&#39;s really really hard and Kitty hasn&#39;t been making it easy and I know it&#39;s not her fault or anyone&#39;s fault at all but it just really really hurts when I&#39;m trying so hard to trust people and little things happen that make me not want to rely on anyone ever because I&#39;ll just be disappointed when other people are too busy/stressed out/etc. to help me out at the moment.
And I feel guilty about wanting things from Kitty so much because you and Jayke are trying so hard to help me and it should be enough and I feel ungrateful.

xmsmollydollyX: I don&#39;t think that you can look at it like that
xmsmollydollyX: you need support from the person that you care about
xmsmollydollyX: and as much as you care about me and jayke
xmsmollydollyX: there is a special place in your heart for kitty

Rei: ...yeah. But she doesn&#39;t want it.
Rei: She&#39;d really rather I didn&#39;t, is what I mean.
xmsmollydollyX: but she can&#39;t dictate what your heart wants
xmsmollydollyX: or what your emotions crave
xmsmollydollyX: It is the same way with me and jayke
xmsmollydollyX: I want things out of him that he isn&#39;t always willing to give
xmsmollydollyX: or gives and then regrets
xmsmollydollyX: I mean, it is all about the give and take of any relationship that a person is in
Rei: I know. And I know I&#39;ll be happier if I just suck it up and be content with what she IS willing to give me, but right now I&#39;m just not strong enough to do it.
xmsmollydollyX: and that is perfectly normal
xmsmollydollyX: I think that you have to ride this wave
xmsmollydollyX: b/c if you surpress it, it will only get worse
Rei: I&#39;ve also just been having really shitty self-esteem lately, although I&#39;ve been trying to fight it. I just feel fat and ugly or at the very least uninteresting and generally not attractive and unwantable.
xmsmollydollyX: YOU ARE NOT UGLY. INSIDE OR OUT.
xmsmollydollyX: (sorry about the caps)
xmsmollydollyX: Why have you been feeling this way?
Rei: well, partly because it&#39;s something I&#39;ve ALWAYS struggled with a lot, but I guess also it&#39;s just been little things, where none of my clothes really fit any more and the spin-the-bottle thing where almost no one properly kissed me and it was automatically assumed when Kitty Kiersten Liz and Betsy and I were talking about NPCs for the vampire game that I&#39;d be the one who&#39;d play the character who was most clothed and not a stripper despite all of them except for Kitty being fairly modest people.
xmsmollydollyX: I think that that was a little insensitive of them, as for the spin the bottle thing- for me, I didn&#39;t know your comfort level
xmsmollydollyX: since we were friends
xmsmollydollyX: *flails*
Rei: and probably a little bit of a tiny irrational voice in the back of my head saying &quot;If you were more attractive Kitty would care about you more&quot;
Rei: I know
Rei: I know people weren&#39;t trying to single me out or make me feel less worthy or whatever by acting the way they did for that.
Rei: Not even Kitty, although she was the most conscious of actively not kissing me properly.
xmsmollydollyX: that was because she was being a dumb
xmsmollydollyX: and a durnk I believe
Rei: It&#39;s just one of those things where I know logically that it&#39;s not that way, but in my bad moments where I&#39;m weak and already feeling miserable the little voice in the back of my thoughts whispers these things maliciously to me.
xmsmollydollyX: right, and the little demons within us are rather malicious *sigh*
Rei: so much of my self-esteem is reliant on being wanted, approved of, and/or liked by others and I know that it&#39;s bad and I try not to be that way but it&#39;s something I&#39;ve always had as an issue and it&#39;s one of the reasons why I get so upset when I do poorly/slack off in the class of a prof I really respect
Rei: and why I put so much effort into being there for everyone even when I really don&#39;t have the spoons to handle it"

"event","So, in hopes for a more cheery, less internal-angsty entry, and tipping my hat to <lj user=""sophronia-chaos"" /> , I&#39;m posting pictures of tattoos I want/possibly want.

The one that I am most sure of, and have wanted since before high school, is below:
<img src=""http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs16/f/2007/225/5/5/bird_by_DesignTheSkinYourIn.jpg"" />

The wings would frame my left shoulder blade, and I might change it to have the neck arch upwards and the head have a crest on it, but I&#39;ve already consulted with the artist and she said I could use it. While the image is supposed to be just a random bird, to me it&#39;s a phoenix. Phoenixes resonate with me. Because I think that everyone can recreate themselves, and that there&#39;s always a chance to start a new. You&#39;re going to have to burn in fire to get there, but you can get there. I can&#39;t really communicate fully what it means to me, but yeah. Next to it, in vertical/right-to-left text to the right of the phoenix, I want written in Japanese (which I can do since I actually understand the language): &quot;Greater than Love, deeper than Trust, sweeter than Friendship, and stronger than Blood, is compassion and understanding&quot; (or some variation in there of. I don&#39;t have the exact wording down). I hold the belief that you don&#39;t have to be friends with someone or even know them to make their world a better place and to help them when they are most in need of someone to understand them and show them compassion.


There&#39;s another one I don&#39;t have an image form but I want to get the constellation of Orion on my left hip. I&#39;ve for a long time had a strong interest in astronomy, and Orion has always been the constellation I found it easiest to find. I also have connections to it because of some of the stars it&#39;s made up of, and a few other more personal things. So yeah.

I&#39;ve thought about others, but those two are the ones I&#39;m most sure of. :)"

"event","So my therapist says I need to stop discounting my feelings and putting them down as stupid or silly or what have you, so this is my attempt to not do so. I don&#39;t know how well this will go.

<lj-cut text=""cut for unbridled emo"">

I was pretty high strung yesterday, from the stress of my classes (I have so much work, and was thinking about I literally would not have enough hours in the day to get all the shit done that I needed to get done and that was freaking me out) and from the lingering stuff with K (I&#39;ll get to that in sec) and then my therapist kind of pulled a stupid and scheduled me at the exact same time as another person, even though we had made plans in advance that Mondays 2-3 would be mine always. So I only got a half-hour session. Since I&#39;m in the spirit of being honest and not discounting my feelings, I was upset, because of all of the times that I&#39;ve been to see her that was the day that I really needed to talk to someone. I even ended up crying a little in front of her, which says a lot for my state. I hate crying in front of people I don&#39;t explicitly trust (read: people not Jk or A) and even though I did my best to suppress it, I couldn&#39;t entirely hold back the tears. I was talking about how things have turned out with K, and how more than anything how this has gone down has hurt because of my past.

I&#39;m a very loyal, loving, forgiving person. I don&#39;t leave people, and I put my trust in people and my whole heart into caring about them. But everybody leaves. I try so hard, but it&#39;s always been my experience that people always leave, no matter how much effort I put into being good enough. It&#39;s the root of a lot of my self-esteem issues, because it&#39;s hard to figure out why people would leave unless I&#39;m ugly or unpleasant to be around or something like that. But it hurts because I trusted her. When I told K about my past, I was opening up the most vulnerable parts of me that I have, showing her enormous trust that I don&#39;t give to most people. The only people I really trust like that are Jk and A, and even they don&#39;t know as much as she does because I trust them enough to cry in front of them and haven&#39;t had the emotional spoons to break out in tears over stuff lately. With her, since I can&#39;t trust her enough to cry in front of her (which should have been in all rights a clue to me that I shouldn&#39;t have told her, but I wasn&#39;t really thinking about it like that at the time) I could pull it off. But that I gave that to her, and she pushed me back to barely acquaintances in terms of closeness? I can&#39;t really emotionally handle this, because acquaintances aren&#39;t people I can tell these things, it makes me vulnerable and it means they can hurt me. I always hurt when I lose someone I thought I could trust and care about, because there&#39;s so few people who fit into that category, but that I gave her so much means not only am I hurt by the loss of her but I am also terrified by what she could do to me. It&#39;s not that I think she&#39;d actively (and probably not even subconsciously) employ any of that information to try and hurt me, but it&#39;s more of a principle thing. It&#39;s dangerous to me for people who don&#39;t care about me as much as I care about them to know what my weaknesses are.

Last night, I worked up the courage to keep following her to her room when we got back to Sessions, instead of retreating to my and Ki&#39;s room. I ad a legit reason--I needed one of her books for reading for Bite me--but I stayed even after I realized I didn&#39;t actually need a book, that it was moodle post thing. I even climbed up on the bed and sat next to her. Not quite like old times, but elbows and knees touching sort of sitting close together. When she went off to work, I commandeered the bed. I had never actually experienced before the &quot;extra gravity&quot; of K&#39;s bed, but I did then. The combination of the mattress topper, the ring of pillows, and her scent made me never want to move again. I plowed through a bunch of readings and felt inordinately happy. Jk, when he left for his meeting, came and flumped full-body down on me and rubbed my shoulders a little bit, which I really enjoyed. Not just the back rub, but the flumping, since I enjoy a solid weight on top of me and also that much contact with another human being, especially one of the same or greater weight/size. When she got back and kicked me and Ki out, we both went back up stairs and made our own nest on the futon and talked well into the night, which was nice.

Today was...today. Classes were canceled, so that was nice, and they&#39;re canceled for tomorrow as well, which helps take some of the pressure off of me for school, although not entirely because it still all has to get done and I just want to sleep away tomorrow, not get up and do work. But I ended up spending the afternoon locked in my room, doing some tidying up and thinking too much. I promised my therapist a document that I had started a while back which details my past romantic/etc. relationships, and I need to expand it and fix it so it&#39;s not addressed to my ex (I never did up sending to him, but it was supposed to be so he, a sociopath, could understand me a bit better). It was a lot more emotionally taxing and generally triggering than I thought it was going to be. That combined with my continued sadness about K just made me feel really sucky. I ended up sitting all by myself at dinner while everyone else in SSFFS socialized at the table behind me, and I resorted to reading Twilight fanfic because I needed to forget my problems and read about someone elses, some one&#39;s who&#39;s tales I know are going to have a happy ending. Thankfully Jk and A took me in, and both gave me lots of cuddles and loving and we watched El Darado (I am the armadillo!) and Jk gave me a back rub with lotion and I gave him one and then I gave A one. It was nice, although since I did both of them after Jk did me (lol, my inner 14 year old boy is giggling) my back is pretty much back to its original state. My poor A is struggling, and I did my best to help her feel better, but I can&#39;t fix it all and I wish I could. One good thing though is I did seem to break the kiss/smooch barrier with Jk today, as much as Jk ever likes to smooch at least. So no longer is the slightly awkward with my being able to smooch A and she being able to smooch him, but us not smooching each other.

Eventually I needed to come back to Sessions because I need sleep, but I ended up dropping by K&#39;s room to see how she and R were doing (they had tweeted about rum and coke and I kind of rolled my eyes...K drinking again. sigh) Once here, I worked up the nerve to ask if I could stay, because I knew I needed to write this down/talk to A online about how I was feeling about K. I&#39;ve been being kind of tired/sarcastic to K&#39;s face. We ended up going outside for a bit with R to smoke a fake clove (one from the states), and then R left. Now I&#39;m just sitting here in K&#39;s room on the floor futon, yawning a lot and typing. I really do need to go to sleep, but it&#39;s like I said to A, I guess I&#39;m masochistic because I don&#39;t want to leave even though being here and just staring at her and feeling so distant makes me sad. I need to talk to her, probably. That&#39;s what I should do. But the thing is, that did shit last time. If anything, it made it worse, because at least before it was my decision not to spend time with her, not because I felt like I shouldn&#39;t be around. It just ended up with me being vulnerable to her and miserable now. So how is talking to her supposed to help? I don&#39;t want to hurt her, which I might end up doing if I&#39;m honest and admit that I regret telling her about my past and that I don&#39;t trust her. I don&#39;t want her to end up pushing me even farther away because she doesn&#39;t know how to deal with the situation/ feels guilty and doesn&#39;t know how to deal with THAT either/fix the situation. I want cuddles and kisses from her. I want to curl up in bed next to her like I do with A, kiss her like I do A. The only difference is that I would want those kisses to be a little more intimate than they are with A, and since I would be perfectly okay with those sorts of kisses with A anyway it really isn&#39;t different.

</lj-cut>

Anyway, I&#39;ve thought for long enough. I&#39;m exhausted, and really need sleep, and it&#39;s nearly 4am. A says I should try talking with K tomorrow. Maybe it will happen. It probably won&#39;t, since I&#39;ll be doing shit and am afraid to do it and she will probably sleep the day away. But maybe it will happen. Maybe I will go to sleep and dream tonight that stuff turns out okay after that. I am so exhausted, I apologize for any egregious errors of spelling or grammar."

"event","So, I&#39;m getting kind of irritated with myself. And by kind of, I mean lots and lots.

I still spend way too much bloody time thinking about K. I&#39;m sure/paranoid that everyone is sick and tired of me dragging this out, and to be honest, the more rational part of myself is too. I want to be able to just shrug and say she&#39;s a friendly acquaintance who lives in my house, and leave it at that and be happy spending time with my close friends A and J and getting to know Bc better (because she&#39;s awesome, even if most people write her off as scary-cranky-pants). Those two, I dunno what I would have done without them this past week. Certainly nothing pretty. The cuddles and emotional support have been basically what kept me from just sort of turning into a puddle of miserable goo on the floor of Sage # 306.

I&#39;ve done a lot of scrambling around in my head, trying to figure out why I&#39;m clinging so much to the feelings of closeness that I want from her, and I think it&#39;s because when we had our Talk I shared a lot of my back story. It was stupid, in retrospect, I shouldn&#39;t have done that when I knew, at the very least subconsciously, that she&#39;d be another one who&#39;d leave (let&#39;s not talk about my abandonment/rejection issues), but I was trying to give her context to explain how I felt about her (which I did a shitty job of doing, anyway). But to get back to the point, I think my brain is resisting sticking her into the acquaintance box because she knows more about the events that at least in part define who I am more than anyone else, period. She knows more than my&nbsp; mother, she knows more than any of my ex-boyfriends, more than Sel, more than Dearheart. More than J or A, although I told some of the stuff the most recent shit to A tonight and will probably tell both those two more eventually. Because I trust them. That information makes me vulnerable, and I hate (this is an exaggeration, but it certainly makes me very uncomfortable) that I&#39;ve exposed that vulnerability to someone I know I can&#39;t trust and doesn&#39;t want my trust, not on the level that I gave it. My rational mind says she wouldn&#39;t do anything with what she knows, but other parts of me are terrified of having given her that power over me. I guess that&#39;s also why her rejection hit me harder than I was expecting it to. 

I&#39;m sick of no matter how much they try and help, my close friends just can&#39;t make it better, because what I really need/want is hugs from K.&nbsp; Which is silly, because if I can&#39;t trust her enough to cry in front of her or feel comfortable with sharing the information I have with her, logically she shouldn&#39;t be able to comfort me better than two people I trust enough to both share that information with (although I haven&#39;t had the time/spoons to yet) and cry in front of, but there&#39;s my brain for you, I guess.

<p>I don&#39;t even know how to approach dealing with it, though. I don&#39;t think talking to her about it would make anything better, because 1) it didn&#39;t last time,&nbsp; and 2) I don&#39;t think it would change the results other than possibly making her feel hurt (if I told her I regretted telling her about my past and that I don&#39;t trust her) or a bit guilty maybe. Hell if I know at this point, since I&#39;m trying my best NOT to empathize with/around her.&nbsp; But this current situation just isn&#39;t. Working. For me. It&#39;s distracting and frustrating. I mean, I really really need to have been asleep half an hour ago, but I needed to get this out of my head. It&#39;s making me act really snappish towards some people (mainly friends online and B), and retreating socially and emotionally from everyone else.

I just want a friendship with her sort of like J and A, closer to A. Is that really so odious/scary/wtfever?</p>"

I can understand that she may not feel the way I do about her, but she even properly kissed, flat out made out with Jk after all the &quot;nuuu looks like my cousin too much!&quot; business. Way to fucking single me out and make me feel unwanted. Way to make it very clear you just don&#39;t see me as anything like a close friend. Rejected rejected rejected. Not wanted. Ugly. Unworthy. Just wish you weren&#39;t there, that&#39;d you go away, stop making my life difficult or awkward. I&#39;m so tired of feeling unwanted, of not being good enough for anyone. I try so hard. So very hard. And she just rubs it in my face that no matter how hard I try, I&#39;ll never be good enough. Not enough for her, not even to be her friend."

<lj-cut text=""I have a whole zoo of metaphors"">

I feel guilty about what I&#39;ve been doing to K. I didn&#39;t really feel bad about it when I was at Jn&#39;s, because I just wasn&#39;t seeing her at all. It wasn&#39;t my being blatantly obvious about avoiding her. Now it is. I&#39;m doing my best to not be in the same room as her, and when I need to be, I won&#39;t look at her. I keep any verbal interaction with her to a minimum. I&#39;m basically the biggest dick head in the entire world. Part of it is me being stupid and petty and horribly cruel, because god fucking damn it she hurt me and I&#39;m fucking bloody tired of getting walked all over and lead on and then rejected and ground into to bloody fucking dirt.

I feel like a shit excuse for a human being. But the other part of it is I&#39;m doing this so I don&#39;t do something worse. Like say something truly unforgivable, or trying to lash out physically, or giving her my angry face. It would really, really hurt her if I did any one of those things, more so than what I&#39;m doing now, and I really do care about her. I want us to be okay again. But I can&#39;t right now. I can&#39;t. I feel like maybe I&#39;m just making up excuses for my behaviour.

I&#39;ll probably cave in the next day or so, because I can&#39;t take much more of her being sad. I&#39;m weak-willed, I can&#39;t hurt her. Not K. Not my K. I just want to hug her and make her problems go away. Or I want her to hug me. But It&#39;s difficult to ask for a hug when you refuse to be in the same room as the other person. But this is exhausting me, emotionally. I just want it to be over. The black llama is staring me in the face with her sad sad eyes and I feel like sinking into the mud and hiding. Her voice sounded so sad.

If anyone is reading and has an opinion, help me out here. I don&#39;t know what to do.

"event","I&#39;ve been doing a lot of verbal ranting lately, and I think it&#39;s high time at least some of it got down in textual format.

<lj-cut text=""Herds. HERDS OF LLAMAS EVERYWHERE"">

First bit of drama llama-ing didn&#39;t actually have anything to do with a current event. I was talking with my new roommate Ki about B, and I finally admitted to her that some of the stuff that B has done/said to me have upset me. Like the night she came over and we wrote papers all night (literally--me until 4am ish, and her until 6am ish). We were mutually commiserating over K, and she was all &quot;Let&#39;s be fuck buddies&quot; and I was sort of &quot;er....(how do I say no without being very rude?)&quot;. We kissed twice, the first having been awful but considering we were in the totally wrong arrangement/angle for it I thought eh, lets try this again. Did nothing for me. At any rate, this was just before Thanksgiving I think? Because when we were all hanging out on the library steps after we all got back, while K had a clove, K said something to the affect of &quot;and you and B totally made out all night&quot; of course, protesting and saying no, we actually DID&nbsp;write bloody papers all night just would have made me seem defensive and like I didn&#39;t want to be associated with kissing B, and at the time I didn&#39;t have enough of a problem with B to not feel sort of bad about doing that. I couldn&#39;t tell by her tone or body language if she found it amusing, or was sort of sullen about it, or what. I don&#39;t know why B would exaggerate things or lie to K. Actually, that&#39;s a lie, I can conceive of reasons why she would, but I didn&#39;t want to think she&#39;d do that to me at the time.

The second thing from B was one night where a bunch of us had been hanging out in K&#39;s room and I just ended going back to B&#39;s room with her. We were talking, and she basically did that smug bragging thing she does sometimes. She said that K doesn&#39;t know what she wants, but that in a few years when she&#39;s grown up a bit her and B would make a really good match. She also rubbed my face the fact that K stayed with her family and&nbsp; claimed that she was oh so much closer to K than I am and therefore she has a much higher chance with her than I do. I&#39;d already agreed to spend the night, but as soon as she&#39;d fallen asleep I invented some laundry that had been left in the washer so I could escape, or else I might have done something rash. At the time, when I really did think I had a honest-to-goodness-the-whole-shebang crush on K, that really hurt. I shrugged it off and ignored for the most part, but once I talked to my roommate about it and she got really upset with B about it I realized that it did bother me a lot.

Okay, so, I&#39;ve been spending a lot of time trying to figure out in my head just what the fuck I want from K, as is evident from the past two entries. I basically want to have a relationship with her like I have/had with S, or with J (before the threesome thing, which is going to be dealt with but that&#39;s an entry unto itself). (ETA: It&#39;s actually closest to the relationship I have with A).Emotionally close, physically cuddly and affectionate, more than &quot;just friends&quot; but not into the realm of &quot;crush&quot; or &quot;dating&quot; or whatnot. I find her very, very attractive, yes. This&#39;d be SO&nbsp;MUCH&nbsp;EASIER if I didn&#39;t. I kind of want to make out with her, yes. But I&#39;ve definitely come to realize that I don&#39;t want to date her, and I don&#39;t want to have sex with her (even if I&#39;ll occasionally joke about it).

I&#39;m glad I figured that out before the R Incident, because it would have been even more unpleasant if I still thought I had strongly romantic feelings toward the K.&nbsp; At the time, it didn&#39;t actually really hit me what was happening. I had a bit of alcohol in me, no adderal, sleep debt, and just generally people around me were either high emotion of a negative sort and I was doing my best to block them out or, as in the case of R and K, very cheerful and that sort of muted my own response until a bit later. But that was a dick move, K. Asking her out in front of a room full of people who have at one point or another admitted to having a crush on you? Smooth. And particularly that it&#39;s R that you picked. The fact that R is so gleeful about the &quot;break&quot; with M sends off all sorts of warning bells and flashing lights in my brain that this is going to end messily. When M gets back, shit is really going to hit the fan, and I do not look forward to it. I don&#39;t even know if K is picking her because she&#39;s the best option and she&#39;s using her to make it clear to everyone else in the room that she isn&#39;t available without actually saying so, or if she really does have an interest in R or what.

It wouldn&#39;t even be nearly as upsetting if she hadn&#39;t gone around before that stating over and over again that she doesn&#39;t date within her friend&#39;s group. Sure, I would have angsted over it for a few days, but then I&#39;d have gotten over myself, had she just been honest and upfront and said that she simply wasn&#39;t interested in me as more than just a friend, instead of making excuses. I try very hard to be honest with everyone, even when the truth isn&#39;t nice or happy or pretty, and I try to trust the people who are close to me. So it really hurts to have that trust betrayed (ugh, that sentence is an entire herd of drama llamas unto itself,&nbsp;I apologize), and to have to wonder each time she says something whether she&#39;s actually telling me the truth or making excuses and bullshitting again. I already take most of what she says with a grain of salt, do I need to haul around a salt lick now? I guess it just makes me kind of sad, because I want to be emotionally close to her. I know, intellectually, that she doesn&#39;t really trust anyone, not completely, and she&#39;s not going to (because of all the nasty stuff that happened to her over the years), but deep down I&#39;m still sitting here going &quot;Hey. You can trust me. I want to be that person.&quot; Kind of foolish, but hey, emotions don&#39;t always cooperate with reason.

So, the combination of all that drama and the frustration bred from worrying about her academic issues, I&#39;ve been avoiding her. I feel bad about it in one sense, because I&#39;m sure she&#39;s got at least somewhat of a clue that something&#39;s wrong, and while she knows full well that I have every right to be upset she&#39;s still a bit hurt about it (granted, take this with a grain of salt because I&#39;m working off of empath sense and not direct communication). Like Jk said, I&#39;m usually up against her side, because that&#39;s my favourite place to be. But right now I just can&#39;t be there, even if R wasn&#39;t occupying that spot. I&#39;m disappointed in K, a bit hurt, and mostly angry/irritated/frustrated. I can feel it in my face, my posture, and my voice when I talk to her that I&#39;m being short and irritable. Not to the point that you&#39;ll really notice it if you aren&#39;t looking for it/don&#39;t already know the situation, but it warns me that as much as I&#39;d kind of like to just get it over with, I can&#39;t have a talk with K right now. It&#39;d end up in either one or both of us crying (either from being generally upset or possibly in my case anger, since I tend to start crying when really angry), or my flat out yelling at her. Neither of which would be particularly helpful right now. Basically I need to be able to give her a completely calm, probably a bit cold face, and be blunt and honest with her. She&#39;ll be upset of course, but I think that she&#39;ll most appreciate the straight-forwardness. I&#39;m not going to let her make more excuses with me. I don&#39;t want to deal with that shit. I&#39;m going to call her on it. Or at least that&#39;s the plan. Who knows what&#39;ll actually happen. *gloom*

I still have to go over stuff about A and Jk, and about my living situation and about LARP stuff, but this is long enough. I&#39;ll get to that in another entry.

</lj-cut>

I&#39;m so thankful to my friends for letting me figure some of it out by bouncing my frustrations off of them, and the past three days of having something all consuming to work on helped as well. I&#39;ve been able to throw out a lot of emotional garbage along with the loam on the floor in that room."

okay, so this is my second attempt to get this all figured out. I&#39;m sitting in her room RIGHT NOW, and we could totally use this time to talk about it, but to be really honest? It scares the shit out of me and I don&#39;t want to do it. The reasons I&#39;ve been hand-waving at it are totally legit--she has comics she&#39;s supposed to read and a paper to write. She doesn&#39;t really need the strain of me wasting a big chunk of her time by blubbering at her (&#39;cause, c&#39;mmon, I&#39;m gonna blubber. It&#39;s just gonna happen, &#39;cause I&#39;m a wibbly mofo. Either &#39;cause I&#39;m hurt or because I&#39;m so pissed at her.) and trying to explain what it is I feel and want. Which is pretty difficult to do, since I&#39;m not sure how I feel and what I want from her.

I understand a little bit more than I did before, having been able to think about it while away from her for an extended period of time and having talked about it even more with different people, but still, I&#39;m not one hundred percent sure. I really care about her, and want to spend time with her in any way that I can/ she will let me. I won&#39;t say that in as many words, because it comes off as desperate and needy, but yeah. I find her really attractive, more than I should? I really really like her, more than I should and in a greater than strictly platonic way. However, I totally understand that she doesn&#39;t feel that way about me, and I accept that, and that I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;ve made her uncomfortable at points. I&#39;ve been trying very hard not to overstep boundaries with her, give her space when I get the sense she&#39;s uncomfortable or wants space, but if she wants me to back off, she&#39;s going to have to tell me that.

The preference for her, being with her, cuddling her, touching her? Yes, that has to do with the fact that I&#39;m attracted to her. But the acts themselves, of hanging out with people and being very cuddly and touching affectionately? That&#39;s just what I do. That wasn&#39;t meant to be anything more, and still isn&#39;t. I&#39;m just affectionate and very, very tactile as a person. She&#39;s also just a really good person to cuddle with, because she&#39;s low-key and it can be a relaxed thing rather than a dependent agh-I-need-to-cling-to-someone sort of thing. It upsets me a little when I feel the need to start second-guessing my every move around her because of the vibes of being uncomfortable that I get from her. I&#39;m not B. I&#39;m aware of how she feels and am doing my best to not do anything that she wouldn&#39;t want. I&#39;m not entirely successful, it&#39;s true, but I think that&#39;s understandable, and at least I&#39;m trying, right? I&#39;m human.

So basically, this is how it is: I like her more than just as a friend, but I understand and accept that she doesn&#39;t feel that way. I&#39;d really like it if we could have what I have come to think of a player-plus friendship: spending a lot of time with her, cuddling her, and I&#39;d sorta like to kiss/make-out with her at some point. But if that&#39;s not cool, and she wants things to stay exactly as they are now, I can deal with that. I mean, I&#39;ll probably angst about it for two days and then I&#39;ll get over myself, since I&#39;m kinda used to being rejected by this point.</lj-cut>"

"event","<p class=""MsoNormal"">So, I&rsquo;ve got a bit of time on my hands until my finals, and I don&rsquo;t really want to sit in McConnell twiddling my thumbs for the next hour or so&hellip;so here we are. In the basement of Seeley. Which hell if I actually know how to spell that correctly. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter, since I&rsquo;m not even sure that I&rsquo;ll be posting this anywhere when I&rsquo;m done or if I&rsquo;ll just delete it. Largely depends on what I decide to ramble about, doesn&rsquo;t it. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m brave enough to ramble about what&rsquo;s really on my mind out here in the open where the &ldquo;enemy&rdquo; might approach. *glances about suspiciously at other people in the lab*

</p>
<lj-cut text=""Rambly Letter of Doom"">

<p class=""MsoNormal"">To be 100% honest, I don&rsquo;t fully know how I feel. I&rsquo;m still trying to figure it out for myself, so I can&rsquo;t really explain it to someone else. However, I can try and wrangle up something vaguely intelligible and tell you what it is that I actually want. Want isn&rsquo;t a good word to use here. It sounds pushy. What I&rsquo;d like to happen. I don&rsquo;t want to be too wordy. Gods know that in reality this won&rsquo;t go anything like how I&rsquo;m planning it out, because I&rsquo;m awkward and yeah. I&rsquo;m kind of curious and anticipating how this will come about. Will it happen outside, or in? Late at night, or during the day. I can see it happening either on the steps or on the bed, but I think it&rsquo;d be silly to think this would happen during daylight hours. Neither of us is like to even be awake during those hours. I&rsquo;m pretty sure we&rsquo;ll just work ourselves around the clock for the entirety of J-term. Awww, my wonderfully cryptic and anonymous entry has become totally transparent with just a few key words. How charming. Except not at all.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Anyway, I need to get back to sorting this out in my head. I like you in a more than just-friends way. You know this, and so does just about everyone else. I have been operating on the assumption that you find the ridiculous number of people interested you somewhat awkward and unpleasant, which is why I haven&rsquo;t brought this up myself. I like candid honesty better, even if it can end up being the source of angst, because at least then I can drown in angst for a few days and then get over it, rather than continue on knowing that I know the answer already, and being conscious of the fact that I am willfully pretending that I don&rsquo;t know so that I can continue on with enjoying my fantasy world. If you hadn&rsquo;t asked/brought it up, I just would have continued as is, which, although not my ideal, is something I&rsquo;m perfectly okay with. Regardless of the fact that I find you incredibly attractive, I really enjoy just spending time with you because you&rsquo;re an awesome person. Now that I&rsquo;m in Sessions, I can see us becoming relatively close, because, let&rsquo;s face it, I&rsquo;m going to be around more often than not unless you actively will it otherwise. I feel most comfortable with you because Of everyone here, you think the most like I do. There&rsquo;s plenty that&rsquo;d different about you and I, but there are also many things that are similar. Of course, I could be imagining similarities just as an excuse to be around you for the sole reason of ogling you, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m self-aware enough to be able to tell if that was the case.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">I don&rsquo;t even actually want to sleep with you. I mean, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I wouldn&rsquo;t say no. But 1) I&rsquo;m just not looking for that right now. I sort of have an on/off switch. When I&rsquo;m in a relationship or having semi-regular sex, I&rsquo;m insatiable, but right now, my sex drive is at a minimum. I mean, I still have longings, but it&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s difficult to deal with or distracting. 2) You&rsquo;re significantly more experienced than I am, and that&rsquo;s a little intimidating for me. Mostly because I have a deep-seated need to please my partner, so I feel really uncomfortable when I don&rsquo;t know what the hell I&rsquo;m doing. I know I have to get past that at some point. But in practice my nervousness about being &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; for my partner means that that small part of me is kind of relieved.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">(small interjection. Aggggh. Just hoping we moved away quick enough so that she didn&rsquo;t really figure it out. If she did, well, that&rsquo;s kind of embarrassing, but I am hoping to basically tell her all of this anyway, so I suppose it doesn&rsquo;t matter. But Still. *blushes*)</p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Ideally, I&rsquo;m interested in what I&rsquo;ve come to call &ldquo;the player-plus version of friendship&rdquo;. I like spending a lot of time with you, even if it&rsquo;s literally just us sitting side by side doing our own thing, I covet cuddles, although not especially the sort where I&rsquo;m playing guessing games the entire time about whether you&rsquo;re just you with your certain level of cuddly or if you&rsquo;re not returning cuddles because you feel slightly awkward about the possible implications of cuddling. (on a side note, it&rsquo;s true, you&rsquo;re my favourite for cuddles. I&rsquo;m sure some of it is because of being attracted to you, but, as shallow and silly as it sounds? The main reason is that you&rsquo;re just exactly the right shape and size for optimal cuddles, at least in my book.)</p>Amalia just came by, so I had to cut off quick so as to go out and sit with them, while emergency smoking happened. Anyway. I also have the ridiculously strong urge to kiss you at times. *shrugs* so that about sums it up. Player-plus friendship, spending time with you, cuddles, and maybe make-outs. That would be the ideal. Now, since I&#39;ve rambled on at you for this long, it&#39;s your turn: what do you want?</lj-cut>"

"event","<div style=""text-align: center;"">An antique shop lives in the alley behind the library, and the windows are streaked with dirt and an &ldquo;out
of business&rdquo; sign hangs listlessly in the window.

You, a brave soul, venture beyond the stiff book bindings of the library to the shop, and a small bell
above the door chimes quietly, the sound strangely muffled by the patchwork quilts draped over the
more precious pieces inside.

Everything seems faded, veiled by dust which has settled over everything like snow, deeper in some
places than others but blanketing every surface regardless.

Single tea cups sit with their saucers, the sunny yellow of hand-painted buttercups a powdered
ochre upon a small table, the Cherry wood marred by scratches and scribbles from children wielding
permanent markers.

A rusty red leather case filled with faded photos, scraps of paper with unrelated notes tucked into the
pockets, and a tiny lock and key on a chain is tucked in with the teddy bears and a tatty baby blanket.

Beside it on the shelf, a little ways off from the other toys lays a clown doll, broken strains of music
drifting out to the ear as the string inside pulls tight again, every so often missing a note where the teeth
of the movement have been broken off inside the clown&rsquo;s head, which is slightly flattened on one side.

Wandering through the shelves into the depths of the shop you come across one shelf that is different
from the others. In the dust lays the perfect outline of a heart, as if it had been removed so recently
there hadn&rsquo;t been time for the dust to creep in and age its clarity. Next to it on that otherwise empty
shelf sits a box, a small indescript box tapped shut with brown packing tape and tied like a bakery box
with soft looking twine. You reach out your hand to stroke the contours of the box, to feel the softened
edges of cardboard corners that have lived to long, to sympathize with the fibers of the rough brown
tape, to smile wryly at the inevitable fraying at the ends of the twine.

The desire to give in to curiosity is strong and you have just begun to pull at the string in earnest when
another presence makes itself know. A woman, with eyes as old and sad as the ancient earth stands
with a regretful smile on her face, leaning on the broom which does not stir the dust. She says,

&ldquo;I gave my heart out

To a girl who picked it up and played with it like a glass paperweight that caught her eye before
discarding it,

Where it lay forgotten under the floor boards, struggling to be seen under handwritten pages,
suffocating in the heavy moments, choking on the dry rasp of ink.

Eventually the delicate hand-blown glass bauble made its way back to me, returned when it found
no use to her heartless life. So precious it was, I cradled it in my hands and cried with joy, but it still is
stained and clouded with sorrow for chances lost.

Now I&rsquo;m saving it,

Wrapped up in a box with newspaper and twine for a man who promised me to take care of it, its been
set aside on the shelf you see, safe in the knowledge that one day it will be his and his will be mine, sharing the
same abuse yet swirling In a symphony of different colors beneath the surface to create
on overall harmony.

It&rsquo;s true, I sometimes wonder

If his words are sort of like those promises made in the War by young boy-soldiers,

Men who&rsquo;ve left dark-skinned forgotten women wrapped in tattered silks still waiting on lost, lonely
islands in the Pacific,

But each day I pull at the strings of the box that holds it and set it on the shelf again open to the world &quot;for sale&quot;,
I remember his smile,

his soft fingertips curled around his own precious glass, offering me the currents of love trapped inside
despite the livid scar across its surface.

And then I cry for his loss and his hope and set aside my own heart once more.

So I&rsquo;m sorry,

But I haven&rsquo;t anything left for you,

To buy or barter or steal or what have you.

I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have to try your luck elsewhere.&rdquo;

And as you leave, the saddened bell above the door rings softly and the dust seems to whisper a</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">goodbye.</div>"

"event","I wonder if you ever realise just how much I don&#39;t say to you, how much I hold back.

how much my face hurts from smiling every time I hear your voice, see your words on the screen, or hear the clacking of the keys beneath your fingers.

I wonder if you know how much I still care for you. Care so much it hurts. How I can look into your eyes and realise that I still can&#39;t let you go.

I wonder if this feels as intimate to you as it does to me. Probably not. after all, you can&#39;t hear the whisper of my smile, the breath of my laugh, and you don&#39;t care for me the way I do for you.

And that breaks me down and pulls my mouth into a frown. It makes my eyes droop with weariness again and oh by the Gods I miss you.

I miss the closeness we used to have before I went and ruined it all.

I&#39;m holding back so hard that it&#39;s awkward and I don&#39;t know what to say, don&#39;t have words because all I can think of is the &quot;I still love you&quot; that wants to tumble from my lips and burst from my chest."

and lose the identity that makes me question

"event","Harry stepped back as if struck, and was mortified to realize the burning in his eyes indicated that tears were threatening to spill down his cheeks. Stumbling, he made let out a strange, strangled sound that could have been a sob, and ran from the disgusted look in those icy dark eyes.


This little snippet is part of an idea which I came up with and subsequently posted a search on snarryficfind for (something in the ball park of the subject, anyway):

<lj-cut text=""Cut to try and save your brains from my rambling thoughts"">

I'm not sure if this even exists or not, but I figured if anyone could help me it'd be you guys.

I was wondering if there were any stories in where Severus is placed as a guardian to harry, or trains harry, or in anyway somehow becomes a parental/mentor figure to Harry. There are some fics like this where Harry develops romantic feelings as well as those mentor feelings for Severus, but what I'm interested in are fics where Harry ISN'T thinking of Severus that way (not that he's averse, just hasn't occurred to him), but Severus develops romantic feelings for Harry. I'd really love if anything where Harry admits his mentor feelings/asks Severus to adopt him/etc., and Severus rejects him rather forcefully. Harry has no idea why, and is devastated. Severus refused because he wouldn't be able to stand the moral issues involved with lusting after a child under his care.

This all sprung from a image that popped into my mind where Snape has just rejected Harry's request to adopt him, and Lupin goes storming to Snape to ask why, and Severus is purposely crass and vulgar in order to get the point across to Lupin. Lupin then is tight-lipped when Harry asks about it, but suddenly is agreeing with Severus rather than taking Harry's side. Harry, being Harry, goes and demands an explanation from Severus, and again Severus is deliberately crude in order to try and scare Harry off. Unfortunately for Severus, Harry has the exact opposite reaction, even though he's not ever seen Severus in a sexual light before hearing Severus' fantasies about bending him over the Potion's Master's desk.

I know there's probably not anything that close but I thought I'd put it out there on the off-chance there was. Also, I've already read that fic (pain and contradictions by atypicalsnowman) with the Fates and Severus' stupid self-hatred mucking everything up, but it's sort of like what I'm looking for."

"event","AHHHHHHH attacked while watching a couple of snarry vids (gobuss, ariel lindt, and gin119 are amazing, you should look at their vids over on Youtube and gobuss/ariel lindt's site http://arielgobuss.tnb.pl/viewpage.php?page_id=14 ) by this snarry idea:

<lj-cut text=""Oh dear, Chan?"">

Okay, so this is either very, very chan (third year) which I'm personally not a huge fan of but don't mind if done right, much later when Harry is the DADA teacher, or some time in between, where Harry is either doing a boggart for the  DA (reviewing patronus for new comers?) or helping a teacher with a class. 

Harry has been seeing Severus for some amount of time, and either Harry has been secretly harboring insecurities or Severus remains rather IC and keeps up the somewhat mean-spirited snarks, insulting Harry's intelligence etc., although he means it more as teasing than as to hurt Harry (socially awkward!Snape). 

Anyway, Harry is expecting his boggart to be a dementor, but low and behold it's a big, bat-ish Snape sneering down at Harry, uttering the choicest, juiciest cannon insults (Mr. Potter...our new <i>celebrity</i>, etc.). This completely shakes Harry, but the students/his friends/if the chan version, Professor Lupin, don't make the connection and just give him a sympathetic pat on the shoulder and commiserate with him about the evilness of the potions master.


Maybe that gets back to snape later, and confronts Harry about it, or Severus later feels betrayed by Harry (someone kisses Harry and Sev sees, thinking Harry is cheating on him, Harry publishes something in the paper about how Severus is innocent and it pisses Sev off, there relationship is splashed across the front page of the Prophet and Severus gets howlers and is mad/breaks it off with Harry), and Severus unknowingly copies the boggart and Harry has a break down of some sort, either manly or sobbing-teary-mess type. Having Ron take detention for the rest of the term so he can revenge Harry's hurt by decking Severus would be a nice touch. 


See, I have all these ideas! but I can't write very well. What am I to do?!"

"event","This story line came from a trip to St. Louis, although it originally started as a dream. 

<lj-cut text=""Oh, my formatting, it hurts."">

My Character list is first: 

1. Chuck--The manager of the gay restaurant/exotic dancer place that plays a prominent role in the story

2. Alex Prince--the name harry Potter takes to disappear into the Muggle world

3. Andy--one of the dancers, sandy-haired. Used to be in a relationship with Harry, when Harry first came to the dance place (I haven't got a name for it yet)

4. Scott--another dancer, currently Andy's partner, Scottish red-head

5. Jazelle--The fabulous, tall, mocha-skinned drag queen

6. (An)Tony-- a taller, Italian-y version of bill! master of pole dancing and gymnastics, is currently teaching harry those trades.

7. Chris--the bartender

8. Sam--another dancer, only a bit taller than harry (this story has short!harry), basically fannon!Draco equivalent: snarky but hot, laid back cool etc.


Okay, now for the story. This'll take a bit, since I'll have to translate my handwriting. 

okay, So, after defeating voldy, the wizarding world has no use for Harry Potter? other than perfect figure head auror with Ginny as a wife. turns out not interested in killing for a living, and maybe caught experimenting with a guy, giving a blow job? anyway, decisively submissive position and that way downs his popularity. prejudice against gays is about the same as it is in the muggle world, although muggle-borns are pretty okay with it because they've experienced the prejudice against them from other wizards and know how it feels. anyway, harry leaves and goes to live in the Muggle world. 

5/24/09--Okay, on with this story.

Harry goes to London, thinking it's going to be easy to get a job. But it turns out that doesn't work, for a bunch of reasons. he's got no documentation of his existence, no High School  (er, euro equivalent to that)/Uni diploma, and at Hogwarts they really didn't learn either manual or intellectual skills needed to function/work in the muggle world. Harry sends his trunk and Hedwig to Grimauld (sp?) but doesn't go there himself. He refuses to go because a) it would be admitting defeat, and b) he doesn't want to face his friends' rejection. SIRIUS IS ALIVE, and either he's really anti-gay or harry thinks Sirius/Ron will have really anti-gay reactions to him, because of their tempers. Harry would rather starve etc. before facing the possible rejection. 

Late one night, Harry's just run out of money, so can't go back to the cheap hotel he's been staying in while he hunts for a job. Doesn't want to go back into the Wizarding world to get more money, so shrugs and says ""oh well, I'll sleep in an alley for one night, it's no biggy"". Ends up getting picked up by a pimp (Harry doesn't realize this right away) who starts out being really nice to Harry. He teaches Harry the trade of prostitution (Harry's got the body for it), and feeds/clothes/shelters him. But later, after Harry is pretty much a master at doing the naughty, the pimp starts to get cruel, using Harry himself, maybe saying something like ""Okay, now you're started, I'm gonna just pay you, not feed/clothe/shelter you anymore"". Turns out the money really isn't enough to feed himself, so Harry runs away from the pimp and starts searching around for gay clubs and whatnot. comes across some gay club, which is more a restaurant that serves gay couples and a exotic dance place. Not a whorehouse, gay strip club? With less stripping. I hope, if anyone is reading through this, you know what I mean. Harry applies, and thinks he can use this place to make himself his own pimp.Waits tables, flirts, and takes men ""home"" with him (to the cheap little hotel room he was renting before the pimp picked him up). After a while, the manager, Chuck, pulls Harry aside and gives him a warning, telling Harry (who has taken the name of Alex Prince, by the way) that ""This isn't that sort of establishment"", and that he has to stop taking men home. Harry is secretly distressed, because the pay as a waiter really isn't enough to support Harry, but he does as Chuck asks. 

Time passes, but Chuck pulls Harry aside again, and is really angry this time, because harry has been nicking food from the kitchens. Chuck fires him because Harry is too ashamed to explain why he's stealing (because he can't afford to buy food AND keep the hotel room, which he needs to have access to the shower there to be presentable enough for work). Harry becomes a Alley whore, because now that he lost that job, and because he isn't with a pimp, he doesn't have enough to keep the hotel room, therefore not having enough to keep himself looking nice, which lowers his number of customers, etc. etc. vicious cycle. ((This here next sentence is an actual SCENE)) Harry resigns himself for the first time to eating out of a trash/rubbish bin.

Time passes, and the story is from Chuck's perspective. Chuck and a bunch of friends are out at some really awesome restaurant, that gives HUGE portions, and fresh food every day, and the Chef ends up tossing a lot of food in the trash. Chuck and his friends are laughing and walking home after dinner, and Chuck sees movement/hears a noise out of the corner of his eye (or the hearing equivalent)and glances into the alley behind the restaurant. Chuck does a double take, because he sees a filthy, tattered-rag-wearing Harry sitting in the dumpster, picking through/devouring food.

Chuck, of course, is horrified, although Harry acts real casual, either because he doesn't want pity from Chuck or because he's gotten so used to his life style that he doesn't really notice how bad it is. Anyhow, Chuck takes Harry back to the club with him and gets the whole story out of the kid. Chuck feels horrible, but he is determined to take care of Harry because he's a good kid, not out of guilt. Most of the dancers at the club live together, renting two flats on the same floor in a nearby neighborhood. Most of them are also social outcasts because of their sexual preferences, from well off families (so don't really need the money) but working to express themselves or escape their families who are pressuring them to conform. Harry is taken in by them, untrained (un-whorified), retrained, loved, brought into the family, etc. Andy, one of the dancers, teaches Harry how to make love, instead of just fuck, and is Harry's lover for a while but they both know they're just really close friends. 

One night, they (the dancers, but not Chuck or the bartender, Chris) are all having a party in one of the flats, and there is alcohol involved. Harry ends up either doing some sort of magic or blurting out something about the Wizarding world,possibly doing some magic or something. I dunno. would harry keep his wand on him? I'd probably go with some other theory, like he left it at grimmauld, because otherwise things would probably have been a little bit better off for him. Anyway, he does/says something that makes it quite obvious that he a) not normal/magical, and b) that his departure from his previous world is something that was tragic and emotionally harmful to him. The guys, despite a certain level of inebriation ((I think maybe harry will need to just be really, really bad at holding his liquor here, for this to work)), exchange serious looks, and the roudiness of the party immediately goes down and they all know there will be serious talk in the morning. Perhaps Harry starts crying, or just gets tired, but they all decide to turn in for the night."

Sarafen = tiny (REALLY SMALL!!!), innocent looking kittens (will never grow larger) with a venomous bite. Venom will paralyze the victim swiftly and for aprox. 48 hours. Very useful for dealing with death eaters, or others. 

Could also be a magical animagus (sp?) I guess. I don't know, up to you."

"event","Okay, so this is completely unedited, and totally random for anyone else, but I thought I&#39;d chuck it out into the universe. This will possibly--MAYBE-- go into the Mpreg that I&#39;m supposedly writing, but never work on...

Anyway, it was inspired by a picture on Deviant Art which I have since lost. It was Severus outside the Gryff common room, asleep on the floor, holding a lily, determined to stay there all night if he had to so he could get his chance to apologize to lily for calling her a mudblood.

&ldquo;Severus. Severus! For heaven&rsquo;s sake, get up you great greasy bat of a man!&rdquo; Philius sneered as the man in question sat up, hair in disarray, glowering at the painting. &ldquo;What is it, Philius, that is so urgent that you must deprive me of the precious little sleep I get?&rdquo; Philius&rsquo; lip curled into a nasty smile as he answered, &ldquo;A student. There&rsquo;s a student outside in the hall, been there for hours. Not a slytherin, either. Though you might like to know.&rdquo; Severus fought the urge to pinch the bridge of his nose as he smoothed out his hair and pulled on his dressing gown. Sighing, he asked, &ldquo;Who is it, Philius?&rdquo; If possible, the portrait&rsquo;s smirk grew even crueler. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m sure you know him, Severus. It&rsquo;s Harry Potter.&rdquo; Severus Snape let out a vicious, wordless snarl of rage, stalking to the door and throwing it open. &ldquo;Potter!&rdquo; he barked, &ldquo;Come to humiliate me further? I should have known you would be just like your father, you arrogant&hellip;&rdquo; Severus&rsquo; voice trailed off, his anger receding at the sight before him, guilt welling up in its place. Damn the boy. Damn him. Curled up against the cold stone wall outside his door, the Potter boy lay, obviously asleep. His young face was streaked with tears that were just beginning to dry, and it sounded as if he was having trouble breathing. How long had it been since Severus had seen the boy cry? He wasn&rsquo;t sure he ever had. Even when Potter&rsquo;s precious mutt died, the boy had not cried. Shaking off this disturbing thought, Severus noted how the boy shivered, half wrapped in his invisibility cloak. As he was staring at Harry&rsquo;s&mdash;no, Potter&rsquo;s&mdash;sleeping form, Severus&rsquo; eyes were drawn to something in the boy&rsquo;s hand. Clutched against the boy&rsquo;s chest was a lily. Or at least, he assumed it was a lily. It wasn&rsquo;t very much of it at this point, nothing left but the stamen and two bruised, torn petals attached to a stem, but Severus&rsquo; heart still clenched at the sight, gasping quietly in pain and surprise. Damn him for giving the boy his memories! But Severus was unable to ignore the memory that floated to the surface, of a young man, also in tears, clutching a similar flower to his own chest, shivering outside the gryffindor common room, determined to sleep the night out there if that was needed for him to be able to apologize to Lily. Severus couldn&rsquo;t ignore the plea behind Potter&rsquo;s action, the appeal to his conscience. Steeling himself, he bent down and roughly shook the boy&rsquo;s shoulder before quickly stepping back, setting his face into a blank mask of indifference. Potter started awake, looking around wildly before his eyes settled on Severus, towering over him in the door way. A gleam of cautious hope appeared in the boy&rsquo;s eye, and Severus had to look away to keep himself from giving in to that hope. &ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, you imbecile, get inside before someone sees you!&rdquo; he snapped, waving the child through the door as he scrambled off of the floor, tangled in that infernal cloak of his. Once inside his sitting room, Severus pointed to the couch, and imperiously ordered, &ldquo;Sit.&rdquo; To his surprise, Potter followed his instruction, curling up in his usual corner, looking rather self-conscious. Severus left him to surreptitiously wipe the tears off his face, soon returning with two mugs of hot chocolate. Setting his own down on the coffee table, he thrust the other into Potter&rsquo;s hands, saying shortly, &ldquo;Drink that, and then you will immediately return to your dorm.&rdquo; But as he attempted to step away, Potter grabbed hold of his wrist. &ldquo;Severus,&rdquo; he pleaded, setting his mug down next to Severus&rsquo; with his other hand, &ldquo;please.&rdquo; Severus stiffened at the familiar hand on his arm, but did not respond, staring blankly at a spot high above potter&rsquo;s head. Sighing, Harry slipped off the couch onto his feet in front of the other man&rsquo;s feet, resting his head against Severus&rsquo; thigh.


This was his only chance, Harry knew, to get through to his lover. &ldquo;Please, Severus, just listen. If&hellip;if you still don&rsquo;t want me after that, I&rsquo;ll leave. I won&rsquo;t--&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s voice cracked and he cleared his throat, &ldquo;bother you again. But let me explain.&rdquo; He waited, holding his breath, for Severus&rsquo; answer. When none came, Harry&rsquo;s heart sunk, but he plowed on anyway, pretending that his lover&rsquo;s silence was an indication that he was willing to listen. &ldquo;I&hellip;I hadn&rsquo;t seen any of them for so long, Severus. What with the war, and classes, and my all ways down here training with you, I just hadn&rsquo;t seen any of them in forever. It was just supposed to be a friendly get-together down at the Three Broomsticks, a couple of drinks between friends&hellip;&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s voice trailed off despairingly at this point, before he took a deep breath and shouldered on, trying to hold the tears back. &ldquo;We were having such a great time, and I warned them that I really should be getting back, because I had promised you I wouldn&rsquo;t be out too late. Everyone protested, and Ginny insisted that I stayed for just one last round, on her. I gave in, and she marched up to the bar and got us all another butter beer. I didn&rsquo;t notice anything wrong with it at all. It wasn&rsquo;t until later, when I&hellip;well, after that started that Hermione got suspicious and confiscated my drink. She&hellip;She p-put something in my drink, Severus. G-g-gin g-gave me ____________.&rdquo; Harry gave into his tears and sobbed quietly against Severus&rsquo; knee. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m s-so s-sorry Severus, p-please, please, forgive me! I d-didn&rsquo;t m-mean t-to!&rdquo; unable to continue, Harry just clung to Severus&rsquo; trouser leg desperately, hoping that his love would understand.


Only Severus&rsquo; years as a spy enabled him to remain impassive through Harry&rsquo;s tale. So this is what the Weasley chit meant, he thought. &ldquo;Get what&rsquo;s mine&rdquo;, indeed. He would plan his revenge against the girl in good time. For now, he had a sobbing Potter to deal with. Part of him wanted to wrap Potter in his arms and sweep him into his bedroom, making slow, sweet love to the distraught young man and kiss those tears away, but the other, more responsible part of him knew he had to take this chance to set the boy free. Better let him go now, while he was still in control, than wait until Harry realized what an old, withered, shell of a man his partner was, and started straying away from him. &ldquo;Some things cannot be forgiven.&rdquo; Severus said in a voice devoid of emotion as he stepped out of the boy&rsquo;s strong grasp. Turning on his heel, Severus said coldly,&ldquo; Good night, Mr. Potter.&rdquo; And swept into his bedroom, slamming the door behind him.


If anyone is paying attention, please comment!

"event","So I knew this would come cause it always does. But driving home tonight from work wasn't to cool.  I just got that lonely feeling.  Not the I'm lonely and I want sex feeling.  The I don't have anyone feeling.  The thing is I don't want anything to do with anyone around here in that sense.  Well I haven't met anyone I would want to really pursue.  There is someone back home but she's never around to talk to.  I really hoping when I visit I get to see her.  That would make me happy.  I want someone in my life. No matter how lame it sounds. If you think its lame then fuck off.  I would just rather not be alone as much as I am.  I would rather feel as alone as I do.  I just really want something that has substance.  Thats all."

"event","So Thursday I went to work at 4:30 pm and I got home at 2am. Then Friday I woke at 7:20am and had to be at barnes and noble for an 8:30 - 4 shift. AND then I had to go to redstorm at 4:30 and worked until 1:30 am and getting home at 2am. This was the same for saturday. and sunday. Both jobs tons of hours next week I am gonna buy a three finger ring that says my name cause Ill have loot.Not really, but i am so shot I havent talked to any of my friends in 3 days and I found out I might not be able to go to NY for thanksgiving which sucks but I ll have to deal with that is it happens. Life is good im a little tired other wise everything is awesome . I miss people, but it happens. Its like this. You know someone and they are really cool and shit like one of the funniest and weird person you ever met. Anf you like them. But you dont get to see them ever. then you move and think about them and your like wow im a dick for not attempting to hang out. now I missed out on an awesome lady. But whatever there is always the telephone. One of the guys I work with at redstorm showed me a design he map for a skate park and its hot im gonna build it on the park editor. I wanna learn about 3d animation. Im gonn look into it. It may be sopmething I enjoy especially if its building maps for games or something. I seriously have no clue what  iwanna do I have ideas but im gonna have to research some things Im watching trading places im gonna go to sleep."

"event","I hatethe fact that it didnt work out and that I was left with sitting there with my dick in my hand.(not-literally) But yeah I know I have a probelm when it comes to these situations and I deal with it the wrong in most cases. Its like the perfect person comes up to you and shows a significant amount of interest and them punches you in the balls. Thats kinda what it felt like ... Yeah this was a few months ago buts it still bothers me cause I really gave a shit for once. I was retarded for her. Like to the point where I was like "" I'll stay on long island for her"" But I glad it didnt get to that, but disappointed at the same time just cause it would have been great. So shits happens and blah blah blah. I apologized for being an asshole which I was but she said she never led me on which is totally shit but ill get over that quick Ok, im over it . She was just way to cool. And I couldnt take the fact that she would be with someone else when I wanted to be with .. so yeah what it comes down to is that I am a dick so fucking what. One the homefront Im still working like a mother fucker i havent had a off since 2 sundays ago and I wont have a day off until oct 15th I am hardcore. so im gonna watch the salton sea. FUCK~!"

"event","So this week is flying by.The new job is flippin' awesome. I start at barnes and nobles next tuesday so two paychecks= lots cash.Im pretty happy about that. I should be getting my car 2morrow so then im set for a while. Once i get enough money ill get a new car. My dads dying or something. But he is a prick and I feel like a total asshole for saying it but it doesnt bother me. He doesnt wanna talk to me or see then why should I care right. My mom is telling me I should call him cause I'll never see him again but shit two months ago he wanted nothing to do with me so that is how its gonna stay asshole or not Im not gonna call him and act like he's a great dad cause he isnt. He spent my childhood getting drunk. Fuckin guy never even took the training wheels off of my bicycle. For the most part he wasnt there for like father should be. There were a few times where he may have been cool and helped me out. But not enough to get the father title.shit i have friends that have done more for me then him. I learned alot more from Raleigh(my other dad) then I did my real father and he died when I was 12. I kinda pissed I didnt visit his  grave before I moved. I go there when I visit in november. That guy was the best. When he died it really messed me up cause I loved him to death. Yeah he did drugs but for the amount of time I spent with him I only saw him fucked up once and it was on accident. I knew about it but it was good he didnt want me knowing ya know. Because I looked up to him and he didnt want me seeing him like that. I wonder what would be different if he was still around."

"event","I started my job last thursday and I couldnt be happier. It;s alot of fun and the other guys in the lab are cool as hell. I had an interview today for Barnes and Nobles whcih went very well .I wanna have 2 jobs so I can make enough money to pay rent and make car payments and still have some to put aside.With 2 jobs that will not be a problem. As far as spare time goes I dont really need any I dont really know anyone here so its not like I party or anything.But I am way happier here then I was in NY. It was a little rough at first just cause of no job but somethings take time. It was well worth the wait.For once girls are the last thing on my mind. I like it better this way. Less drama. I still miss my friends and I will continue to until I go visit for thanksgiving. Im trying to talk a few people into hitting up AC whcih would be fun.im not getting as much of the basement as I thought i was but I'll just pay less rent so i dont really care as long as my stuff fits ill be happy. Tomorrow im gonna go pick out a car and probablly get it on the road like tuesday.Im pretty stoked....."

"event","So I saw the movie tonight.I thought it was pretty sick. It made me think about relationships and all that jazz. I like the fact that all drives around here are at least 20 minutes it gives you time to just think.After the movie I went to the 24 hour walmart an bought pens.But back on track here.I was thinking about how my passed relationships pretty much sucked.Except One. But mainly cause I didnt get to know who the person really was. I did eventually but something like that should happen before you even get involved in that way.Im just ranting for the most part. I just want a real deal girlfriend. It sucks that I'm picky.But the few times I was like eh whatever it didnt turn out to well so I'm picky for a reason.And I'm gonna stick to that.Tomorrow starts the week of watching my niece. She is insane and its great.At least ill be occupied for the week.So yeah Im gonna smoke and go to bed."

"event","So I finally got one of these things. I have no clue how to put up a picture. Well I do but it wont let me. After about 3 months of waiting I'm finally out of NY which is a good thing. I was pretty sick of all the petty bullshit I had to deal with there. I'll be getting my money soon which is a good thing.Its pretty lame when your mother steals 10g's from you . But it feels damn good getting it back.Im looking for job here. I cant start for 2 weeks cause i have to help with the kids but i dont mind they pretty much rule. I need to get drums fast I need to start playing again I miss it a lot and I still suck at guitar but its fun. I wanna see garden state Jon said it was really good so im going to see it 2morrow. That should be fun I totally need to get out more.But so far so good. I miss a few people. Buts its not really bothering me. I guess its cause I like having time to myself I have always been that way. Ill be seeing them all in November though. So its not so bad.I hit up blockbuster tonight and got Party Monster for 4.99 and rented Owning Mahowny so im gonna go watch it ... Hopefully I keep up with this thing.."

Congratulations, you're rabies!

Transmitted by rabid animals, you're most commonly found infecting creatures such as raccoons, skunks, bats and foxes. But don't worry, you affect humans too, causing either paralysis or hyperactivity in your advanced stages, and ultimately death.

Your most famous symptom is hypersalviation - that delightful foaming at the mouth that we have come to know and indeed love. However, you can also cause hallucination; think of the fun you could have at parties!

Hah. Never trust a shrink when they say 'a little' in reference to side effects.

My memories of the entire last day are pretty hazy. I spent most of it half asleep due to that stuff. The parts I actually remember weren't nice either, it felt like I was drunk all the goddamn time...

On the upside, however, no more fear and anxiety. The stuff works, in a big way.

On a completely unrelated note, this weekend I'll go to the Spielefest (game festival) in Vienna. It's a three-day convention for board games, RPGs, TCGs, <i>everything</i> game-related. If the last few times I was there are any indication, I'll have a blast once again. 

That, however, means I won't get to play too much Everquest 2. Which is kinda bad. Because seriously, this game is <i>the shit</i>. It's a complete and utter MMORPGasm.

I currently have two of my three characters leveled up to 10. I'll work on Thesik next, trying to get her up to 15 so I can finally get the hell out of Freeport (which sucks). And then...I'll be one of the very few (perhaps the only) good-aligned Iksar wizards =)."

"event","Pouring Silver Nitrate over your hands is not a good thing.

Why? 

It's a matter of chemistry.

Silver Nitrate is used to detect halogenid ions, like chlorine, bromine and iodine. With those, it forms silver-halogenids, insoluble compounds that can easily be seen in a test tube.

The problem with pouring it over your hands is this: Sweat contains sodium chloride. Which means chlorine ions, which in turn means silver chloride. And silver chloride is not a stable compound. Under the effect of sunlight, it falls apart into chlorine and metallic silver. That's how photography used to work, back in the day.
And metallic silver is, in this form, black. And extremely hard to get rid of.

As a result, I have large black blotches all over my hands, and so far, they have resisted all my attempts to remove them. Water won't work. Neither will soap. I've even tried the acetone we use to clean test tubes in chem lab, and it didn't work.

I'll stay blotched until my skin regenerates, I'm afraid."

I won't go into too much detail here, but it seems some of my online friends have been busy making enemies all over the place. All this hatred flowing around...it is <i>invigorating</i>. 
The Shadowrun game got a little bogged down, but next time should be all action again, so it's probably alright. Can't have non-stop action all the time. Also on this front, some of my players' characters are starting to worry me. David is a one-man escalation of violence :P.

Today started off with golf. And verily, I did SUCK at it. Full mightily. Seriously. I landed one or two good ones (including a chip-in from about 10 meters away...boo-yah), but for the most part I hit absolute stinkers. And I couldn't sink a putt to save my life. Oh, well. At least my opponent didn't show up so there was no competition. I hope the real deal won't be quite as embarrassing. I really should have taken that water pistol along...

Oh, and since Mahtar keeps writing about how low he's running on his meds...I've been <i>out</i> of my antidepressants for, oh, about two weeks now. Not that I actually feel any different...
Oh, well. Next shrink meet is set for tuesday. I've survived puberty without the stuff, I can take another week or so.

And I won't get much sleep between today and tomorrow, either: This evening is our weekly Shadowrun game, and tomorrow morning I'll be playing golf. Yay. Don't get me wrong, I love the game, but I could definitely live without the 'early rising' part. For the most part, I'm not truly awake until 2 PM.

I fucking hate chemistry. Even though today was kinda fun. Me and my good buddy Markus finished first with our morning work, had perfect results and thus got the luxury of a two-hour lunch break, and on the afternoon assignment, I was again the first to finish, and I again had <i>nearly</i> perfect results. Apparently, my sample should have contained chlorine. What I found in it was bromine. I redid all the tests and got the same result, and finally, the prof in charge let me off the hook and told me to go ahead with my result.

It wasn't until a few minutes later that I figured out what had gone wrong: At some point along the way, I must have accidentally swapped samples with somebody else. I probably should have marked mine...or at least I should have committed its exact position to memory. Oh, well. I got out before the other guy showed up with chlorine instead of bromine in his sample, which would have tipped the prof off to what really happened pretty damn fast. No sense in hanging around for something like that, that's best left to deal with later on.

On a more personal front, I've started to forget my appointments with my shrink. My reason for going to said shrink? I kept forgetting things...This is probably karma.

Now, what else...ah, yes. Learned a few new tricks at Kali practice today (now I finally know what Faragon meant when he talked about a Heaven-Six). Shame it will be the last time I get to do this for half a year. Thanks a lot, Ill, Omni, Mahtar, Sets and so on. This is because of <i>you</i>. The reason?

Created a LiveJournal, that's what.

I've always been dead against those things, because of all the unnecessary drama they lead to...but then I realized...I LIKE drama. Really. I like to watch egos implode, I like to see the shitstorms evolve...I love to hear the wailing and gnashing of teeth. Really, I do.

I'm quite the asshole.

So, in order to get a better view of these things (from the front row, as it may be), I've opened up my own LJ. Hive of Scum and Villainy indeed.

But enough of my boring motivation, here's what you all desperately want to know: Who the hell am I?

Well, I'm 24, live in Vienna, Austria (for all you americans: That's the little splotch on the map just above italy. You know how to find italy, don't you?), I'm studying (with varying degrees of success) biology at the university of Vienna (Alma Mater Rudolfensis for those who like these important-sounding names), hoping to eventually get a job teaching that shit. Why do I want to go into teaching? Hey, I already told you, I'm an asshole, and I like watching people suffer. Seems to me that's a good 90 percent of being a teacher.
In terms of job...well, I try to avoid work whenever possible, which is another reason why I'm going for teacher.

Let's see...what else...ah, yes. Likes and Dislikes.

Well, here's what I like: Good food, good books, gaming of any kind (RPGs, computer gaming, I've even done LARPs), heavy metal (especially Nightwish), peace and quiet (yes, those last two ARE compatible), some friends of mine.

What I dislike: You. Yes, you. Specifically. Also, all manners of annoyances (spam, telemarketers, sticking drawers, people who talk during movies...) and, this is important, being bothered when I'm trying to relax.

Now...hobbies. Well, there's gaming (currently: DSA -a german RPG-, DnD -three groups-, Shadowrun), Inosanto Kali (martial art involving breaking arms, legs and various other body parts with hardwood sticks. Later on there will be knife-fighting two. Basically the street-fighter's martial art), the PvP Forums, reading. That's it, really.

Well, time to get this show on the road..."

Ah. What better way to spend our anniversary than lunch at Ristorante da Valentino :) We had the highly raved Squid Ink Fettucine with Crabmeat in Creamy Tomato Sauce and Chicken &amp; Sundried Tomato Pasta in Cream, Garlic and Tomato Sauce. Oh man, typing the out makes me hungry already. The food was really good. Can tell a lot of thought and heart have been put into it. Also the staff were really friendly. Perhaps cuz it&#39;s a weekday afternoon with not much crowd. Have came across some bad reviews but to each his own I guess. I had a good meal PLUS great company ^^

Can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 2 years already. Matt is graduating soon and moving onto the next phase of life. I&#39;m so excited for him :)
Thanks for putting up with me for the past 2 years!! Really thankful to have you around, to cheer me up whenever I had a bad day or even to calm me down when I got followed by a cat -.- To give me advice, praises and of course, your naggy lectures. Love them. Shan&#39;t get too mushy here but anwz hehe cheers to even better days ahead! &lt;3"

So we decided to scoot off (literally via Flyscoot) to Bangkok during my recess week in Feb for a short getaway / retail therapy! The protest was still ongoing but according to ladyironchef who captured some videos, the atmosphere was more of a fair/bazaar where the locals set up their shops along the roads.

Accomodation - <b><a href=""http://www.lemonteahotel.com/"" target=""_blank"">Lemontea Hotel</a>. </b>
From their online pictures, the hotel looks really clean and decent for 2 so we decided to go with it. Plus it was so affordable! Free wifi and complimentary breakfast which was quite yummy! The only downside is that they didn&#39;t have hot shower. Not sure if they have fixed it already but we had to shower in unbearably cold water boo. But that aside, we had a hell of a time camwhoring in our room heh. Self timer. Selfie. What else?

Restaurant - Karmakamet Diner
Heard so much hype about this place that we hadddd to check it out. Had our brunch here before a long day of shopping at Platinum. It was a saturday afternoon and the crowd was.... umWHAT CROWD??? We were the first customers and had the whole place to ourselves so we explored a lil bit and took some pictures of the interior. The staff were probably used to it so they left us alone until we wanted to order. Food wise, it was acceptable but I&#39;d rather have my phad thai and mango sticky rice!! Or stick to brunch in SG. Nevertheless, this secret garden is still worth a visit! <b><a href=""http://www.ladyironchef.com/2013/11/karmakamet-diner-bangkok/"" target=""_blank"">Click here</a></b> for more pictures and directions.

Shopping - where else...
We conquered Platinum in a day and Chatuchak the next. The sun was so freaking hot and we bought so much our hands were gna break. Didn&#39;t manage to take any pictures there cuz so hot + sweaty = no mood!! But anwz we&#39;re happy with our buys and I&#39;m getting excited for our next holiday trip!!^^"

The day I receive this dress from ASOS....

<lj-cut text=""Read about how ASOS sent me the wrong dress"">I was super excited to see the parcel lying on my table. Finally! My CNY dress is here. I can try it and alter the length if need be. I tore open the parcel and to my horror.... found this.

In that moment I swear I was in a state of utter shock. CNY was a week away and I didn&#39;t have my dress. AND how did <b><a href=""http://www.asos.com/ASOS-Petite/ASOS-PETITE-Exclusive-Lace-Skater-Dress-with-High-Neck/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=3372440&amp;SearchQuery=exclusive%20lace%20dress&amp;sh=0&amp;pge=0&amp;pgesize=36&amp;sort=-1&amp;clr=Ivory"" target=""_blank"">THIS </a></b>turn into that.

I spent the whole day wondering if I should return it or re-order and get express shipping which costs a bomb. In the end, I typed a long email to the ASOS cust team. (After spending 1h on the web to find the email contact form because they ask u so many questions before allowing u to email them. So smart.)

<b>This is what I emailed them. Haha some white lies told...</b>

So I went ahead and mail my parcel to the Singapore SkyNet office (in Changi lol) and hopefully they will get the parcel safely back to ASOS. This costs 13USD but its refundable so yippee. The express shipping for replacement was waived too!

Lesson to be learnt: Order in advance lah don&#39;t wait until last minute. Somemore ASOS shipping takes 3 weeks. If not then buy from SG blogshops next time. </span></div></lj-cut>"

Last Wed the 3 of us had brunch at Selfish Gene Cafe!!! The brunch is gooood! And affordable too. My highly raved brioche with the raspberry or blueberry sauce idk which, was only abt $10. But it&#39;s quite messy and unsightly to eat lol when the sauce flowed everywhere. But anyway I love brunch!!! After that we walked around Duxton area and cabbed to town to shop haha. And I went back home to host a steamboat gathering for 25 people............

OK i have to admit that I typed Din Tai Feng into the subject line and only realised that it&#39;s supp to be Tim Ho Wan instead hahaha. Guess it says a lot.

Food was okay but the variety (or lack thereof) wasn&#39;t impressive. At least now I can say I&#39;ve tried it haha. Can&#39;t believe it. This is like 5 mins from school but I&#39;ve never eaten there till now.

It was fun catching up with the AC mates! Miv is graduating soon but Freddie still year 1 and Anne and I are going on exchange next sem.&nbsp;Time flies!!! Still rmb the good ol&#39; days skipping PE tgt, hanging out at the void deck and copying each other&#39;s homework for idk Math or Bio haha. Stay gold my friendssss ^^"

Sent my lil brother off to Taiwan for 3 weeks of training. Now the house is extremely quiet with his absence.

Went for a marketing &amp; PR internship interview at Club Med yesterday. Crossing my fingers real hard because they usually take in French interns but this year they decided to recruit Singaporeans. It&#39;s a 6 month internship and I&#39;ll probably go on leave from school if I&#39;m selected. Andd maybe drop my communications major so that I can graduate in 4 years. Omggg still can&#39;t get over how the office is SO clean and fresh. Such a nice place to work at!

If it&#39;s meant to be, it will beeeeeeee. Study hard peepz"

Dropped by the fabulous baker boy with Lilin to try their cakes! The bakery is quite inaccessible. You can walk from Clarke Quay MRT or take a bus from God knows where that might actually stop right opposite Liang Court. It&#39;s directly opposite the taxi stand where all the Clarke Quay bars are at. And by the time you walk in, don&#39;t expect any aircon to welcome you graciously.. The bakery closes at 6pm on weekdays. We went at 5pm and there were less than 10 people there. Picked a nice long bench right below the ceiling fan and in front of a nice shelf. There are not a lot of tables around like.. around 10? Or maybe lesser. So either avoid going during weekends or just takeaway i guess.

<img alt="""" border=""0"" height=""489.53125"" src=""http://i32.photobucket.com/albums/d1/Jo0o0o/null_zps95f3751d.jpg"" width=""650"" />

Cakes go for abt $9 a slice. Price is rather steep. One cake can buy two of us a meal already haha. But the portion is quite big... I had the blueberry infused with lemon cake which was guuuud. Lilin had the red velvet which didn&#39;t really impress. The taste was quite bland. Their homemade iced tea is not bad. The guys (yes, baker boys) at the bakery are very friendly and patient. They probably see people taking pictures of their cakes every single day. So when we do it, they just wait quietly or stand aside to let us have our way. So nice.

Looking forward to more cake adventures~~~ ^^"

Admiring the view from Ion&#39;s level 55 ^.^

The restaurant week price was $35/pax but the bill came up to $124 because we also ordered wine ($12 ea for both red &amp; white) and still water ($12) -.-&nbsp;But it was worth it to get an exceptional dining experience. The view is amazinggg. I love the whole concept. If I can open such a restaurant I can die happy.

Am excited to see the spam of restaurant week&#39;s photos from everyone~</div>"

Omakase was soOooOo good. Even though it&#39;s a lil overpriced and inaccessible, I really think everyone should try it.
I had the Omakase cheeseburger ($14) and Matt had the Bacon one ($16+). Also ordered truffle fries ($6+) and A&amp;W root beer float to share. Omgah the float was so good. Matt thought it&#39;s damn con money cuz it&#39;s just ice, a can of drink and some ice cream. Ok lor.
The ice cream damn nice leh but maybe its just Magnolia or Walls lah haha.

So.... after Matt finished his meal, this happened:

Matt: Eh I think I forgot how the burger tastes like alr
Me: HUH what the hahaha?! (smlj?!) 
Matt: Can I have a bite of your burger to just remember how it tastes like??!
Me: (O_O Finish your food now it&#39;s turn to eat mine?!)

This boy damn sly. and greedy.

Went to check out Pasar Bella after and it reminded me of the this market we visited in Melbourne. Really miss all those damn good Aussie cafe food. In sg everything is sub standard and overpriced.

Didn&#39;t take any pictures inside Pasarbella though as the lighting was too dim. We didn&#39;t get anything there too since we were quite full and I didn&#39;t know what was good there....

Went home after and knocked out from the food coma. So much for wanting to study.</div>"

In a class called New Media and Organisations now and we&#39;re supposed to create a blog, twitter, pinterest, second life and review accounts (if we don&#39;t have yet).

So now I am dedicating one post to this class activity.

I bidded for this class because I thought it&#39;d be really relevant in this day and age. Everything is going online, every one is using social media. This class doesn&#39;t just teach us HOW to use Facebook or Twitter, but rather, why people use these platforms and how we can effectively reach out to consumers, bringing in concepts such social presence, media richness, self-disclosure, self-presentation.

Initially I thought it was funny that we need theories to understand social media. But Prof has made it clear to us that it&#39;s essential for example, how we need to interpret and make sense of data; understand implications as well as predict magnitudes/direction of trends.

So apparently in order to increase my social audience, I need to share this post across all other channels but that would be weird right. It&#39;s like self-publicity. How about I just promote my other platforms here hehe.

SOOOO happy that Matt is finally back from exchange. Sometimes I&#39;m still not used to it that I will forget to text/call him because I&#39;m too used to the time difference we used to face! I know right it sounds retarded. We had our first proper meal together at one of Matt&#39;s fav Jap restaurants, Sun with Moon. Food was great but couldn&#39;t beat ze company ^^

I&#39;m just really thankful for all these technologies around that made communication a lot easier while 12 hours apart. Whatsapp and Facetime is all you ever need. So despite the distance it was easy to keep up with whatever that&#39;s happening on each side. He would send me beautiful scenic photos and I would bitch about my work to him in between some selfies LOL. Stop judging la. Haha ok enough of our R/S don&#39;t want you to start going &quot;ewwww&quot;.

Yes I&#39;m back. *.* !!!!

Just wanted to write about my 2 KL trips this summer. Because of internship, I couldn&#39;t go anywhere else after I got back from Europe, hence had to make do with short weekend getaways!

For those interested, I&#39;m gonna share the 2 airbnb apartments! Personally I would rather stay airbnb because it feels more homely and usually is cheaper than hotels. Also, the hosts are locals and are more than happy to recommend food/landmarks around.

During the first trip we stayed in KLCC at <a href=""https://www.airbnb.com.sg/rooms/1148887"" target=""_blank"">Chris&#39; apartment </a> When we burst into her room, the girls were all squeals and &#39;Omg!&#39; simply because the furniture and room deco is TOO CUTE! Wouldn&#39;t mind coming home to this everyday *.*

There were 1 queen sized bed and 1 really comfy makeshift bed (cut off in the photo) so it was just nice for 3!

This service apartment condo-ish place is really near all the shopping and whatnot. And 5 mins away from zouk. Technically it&#39;s behind it but you have to walk one big round to get there OR you can take a shortcut across a school by climbing over a gate, tried &amp; tested ;) Superrrr convenient. The only problem is probably wifi. The connection wasn&#39;t strong enough to surf. But fret not, just head to any nearest starbucks to enjoy complimentary wifi.


&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;


The second trip we stayed at <a href=""https://www.airbnb.com.sg/rooms/1099279"" target=""_blank"">Greg&#39;s place</a> which is 10mins off from the city.

I only chose it BECAUSE of the infinity pool. Yeaaaa my friends all wanted to kill me when they saw how lame the room looked. It is big but just, really empty and not thattt homely as the first. It&#39;s also not really convenient to get around. At night the condo provides taxi booking services but in the morning they don&#39;t (don&#39;t ask me why) and guess what, this condo is situated right beside some highway. Flagging for cabs in a traffic jam is really not funny. Cuz the drivers will try to bargain the fares with you even though their taxis are supp to be metered. The last thing malaysians care about is rules haha.

But it&#39;s probably the safest (and a rather new) condo in Malaysia. Even at night we can easily count 10 security guards on duty lulz. It&#39;s called The Regalia Residences for reference! Oh and um wifi in the room only works if you have a laptop with you. Boo, yet another wifi letdown. But there&#39;s complimentary wifi at the lobby so you can camp there while waiting for ya cab.


&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;


KL has a lot of food. Many people go to KL to EAT. Whether you are looking for cute quaint cafes or legit streetside food, there&#39;s something for everyone.

After seeing all the raves on TripAdvisor for<b> Antipodean Cafe</b>, I really wanted to try it. Esp their french toast. There are 2 branches so don&#39;t go to the wrong one! There&#39;s one at Bangsar but I went to the Tan &amp; Tan one by accident. Hoho blessing in disguise because I came back and read online that this is bigger and better than the Bangsar one.

Let&#39;s just say... this is one of the best post hangover meals I&#39;ve ever had hahaha. My fav is the french toast!!! It&#39;s super gooood I&#39;d love to go back for more. The scrambled eggs a little disappointing though. After eating so much scrambled eggs in Australia, I must say the bar has been raised a little. The eggs benny were good though! Actually everything just tasted better because 3 of us shared everything heh. And the bill came up to about <b>90RM</b> for 3. That&#39;s some affordable brunch I would say.</div><div style=""text-align: center;""><b>Antipodean Cafe @ Jalan Tun Razak,</b>

This place reminded me of the formal steamboat stretches at Marina Bay MRT!! Really rows of zhi char, hokkien mee, satay, thai food whatnot. We walked all the way to the end because the last stall apparently had the best chicken wings. But no we couldn&#39;t wait 20mins for some wings so we just chose some random stall and ordered some food to share.

If you are game enough, try the fried lok lok stalls. I didn&#39;t really dare to eat anything there but Grace &amp; Enru went ahead and picked some sticks. I tried the fried mushrooms and quail eggs and DAMN, they&#39;re good. Like legit good. But next day we all kena stomachaches lah hahaha. Guess our stomachs not used to lup sup food.

The chicken wings were standard ah. I thought the stingray from newton circus nicer though. The chilli plays a big part man. The prices at Jalan Alor are not say ridiculously cheap though cos it&#39;s sort of a tourist hotspot. Just remember to bring cash and- bring all your friends so you can order everything and share!!!

Clubbing wise, just head to Zouk KL or Butter for a good night. Best is get some liquor from the duty free zone and pre-drink. Make sure you get mixers because it is <i>impossible</i> to find 24/7 shops or 7-11 anywhere. Entry for Zouk was 38RM and actually for ladies the age limit is 23 but I guess the bouncers don&#39;t really care once you flash your pink IC. Music is good at both, like house, electro all. Not disappointing at all! But pls pls keep a lookout for your belongings. Malaysia is malaysia afterall. Some idiot stole Enru&#39;s iPhone 5. Then we saw a fight at zouk where this indian bouncer was screaming profanities at some dude and kicking him all. We were just standing at the random hotdog stand when it suddenly happened.&nbsp;Fricking scary man.

Shopping in KL is cheap but don&#39;t expect to find a lot of nice stuff.. My best buy is this pair of SIZE XS (YEA BUD) Zara shorts at only SGDS$28 cuz it was on sale!!!! Cute? Matt thinks its like PJ shorts not meant to be worn out :&lt; but i luvvv it its my most nua shorts eva.

You can go to Sungei Wang for, quotes yuqing &quot;Bugis street in an air conditioned building&quot;. I don&#39;t like it tho cuz very hard to find sizes for me and like most of the shops sell the same old chiffon shit and blogshop stuff that are mostly ill fitting and of stiff material. You can also make a trip to Pavilion for the high end brands, overpriced F21, and better restaurants. Quite surprised to find NO QUEUE outside the Ippudo outlet there. I would say KL is more for food/partying than shopping. You only need abt S$150 for flight &amp; accomodation. And probably $150 more to spend? Of course if I had more days I would rather go like Bali/Phuket or even Bangkok but what to do.


Gonna end here with a few gay shots of myself.. Goodnight! 2 more weeks of internship left lezzgo.

<span style=""line-height: 1.4;"">Back then I had bad hair, bad fringe, bad pimples, bad clothes, bad finance. How I survived all that I have no idea. These are like the most decent photos i dug out. The rest should just be buried. Sigh pie. I think it was a tough year but I had all these friends to count on. Even tho might have lost touch with some of them, but at least when i look back, i rmb the fun times and happy memories. I guess I wouldn&#39;t have been me without all these people.</span>

Best 3 weeks of my life :&#39;) Rest of the pictures up on my FB la too lazy to put them up here. Anw I got the chance to go to Munich - Rome - Florence - Venice and then back to Paris. My first Europe experience definitely has been fulfilling. Amidst the beautiful scenery, rich history and great food, I realised that we have a lot to be thankful for in Singapore. We don&#39;t have to wait 20 minutes for a train, transport fares are SO cheap here, toilets are everywhere, 3G (of course), no language barrier, no need to worry about pickpockets and gypsies, asian food in supermarket, HAWKER CENTRES/FOOD COURTS. The list can go on forever. But this trip really make me realise that life in SG isn&#39;t so bad after all. And of course nothing beats coming back to your comfort zone, no longer living from a suitcase and worrying if you have enough underwear to last the next few days or so.

Lol.

Anyway, I have to OT on saturday. Because guess who&#39;s back?

MARINER OF THE SEAS. Yes Royal Caribbean has a lot of fleets. I wonder who comes up with ALL the names. So yes this ship is back from cruising and the media and some VIPs are coming onboard to have a look (and a few nights of fun to KL and back). Unfortunately, interns do not have privileges to go on a cruise but we do get a free.....buffet lunch onboard? That&#39;s the highlight really. Other than handling other duties like registration, tour guide etc. 

Before I end, here&#39;s my current ear candy/travel buddy. It&#39;s SOO good you must listen to it. I want to catch him live so bad.

OOOOmg I can&#39;t wait for my last accounting paper to be over on Monday. And my first long haul flight alone. SOOO excited~~~
But first I need to get over that exam sigh. Paper ends at 4pm and flight is at 11pm ^^

Can&#39;t wait to touch down at Paris and see my boy for the first time in 2 months hehe. I know it&#39;s only 2 months but trust me, that&#39;s a lot when you were seeing that person almost every single day. And when I come back from Paris, it repeats. Matt will finish up his remaining 3 months of school while I start my internship. When he comes back, it means summer is about to come to an enddd.

Will be exploring Paris, Munich, Rome and Venice so can expect lots of pictures to be up on my instagram~~ I hope it isn&#39;t too cold there, brought a coat along even tho it&#39;s Spring now. Weak is me.

Now back to studying. .. ...</div>"

Really really in love with my Rebecca Minkoff Mini Mac Bag. Nude is one of my favourite colours but somehow I can&#39;t pull off nude colour clothes so HOW CAN I SAY NO TO THIS!!! ^^ The strap is not adjustable but I think it doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re wearing a dress! Anyway, this was what I wore to Lilin&#39;s 21st birthday party. The theme was Oscars so had to glam it up a bit. Lilin said I look prettier for her party than for my own HAHA. Duh, look pretty for you what ^^

I&#39;m sure you enjoyed yourself a lot during the party what with all the special performances your friends prepared. Sorry I can&#39;t sing or dance :( and also too shy to give a speech in front of everyone ehehe. But you know, deep down I love and treasure you a lot as a friend :) So I shall hereby express my thoughts and feelings.....

We&#39;ve known each other for almost 5 years now. I&#39;ve seen you grown from a young delicate flower to a fullly bloomed one hoho. From how we used to attend and dress up for church events to sunday outings to study/movie/shopping dates, I&#39;m thankful for all these memories we have created. Will always remember alllll your retarded moments. That&#39;s what makes you YOU so don&#39;t change any of that heh. Now let the pictures do the talking shall we? ;)

2009 was the year I felt so much more belonged in church because I found YOU. What a turn of events! I can&#39;t remember when and where exactly did I meet you but from then on the three of us kept hanging out in and out of church. We started taking A LOT of pictures (now I understand Rebecca&#39;s obsession) to document all these events. It was also the year of the owl handsign &gt;O&lt; I think when I first met you Lilin, I thought you are a very cool and funny girl. Cooler &amp; funnier than me lah ok give u credit. And also because we were both going to junior colleges, I was able to talk to you more about school related things :&gt;

2010 was amazing because of all our sunday outings. I always looked forward to the weekends because we will just dress up go out and eat/shop. Retail therapy from a whole week of school. It was also the year when you fell madly truly and deeply in love. I could see how happy you were and I think I was probably wondering when it will be my turn haha. Hmm it&#39;s also in 2010 that you became super indecisive about your hairstyle so we see you going from long hair to short hair to long hair extensions. Looking back now, wow that was a lot of changes. But at the end of the day, you still emerged looking like a pwincess ^^

2011 was super fun because we were both having that 8 months break from JC. Young carefree and wild bahaha. Grew closer to you this year because I think Reb was very busy with Josh and school so sometimes it&#39;d always be just the 2 of us in church. We started having more interest in dressing nice, taking photos all that. (girls what.) And oh seeing the christmas picture above, I got reminded of our yearly gift exchange. Always loved picking things out for you girls not because it&#39;s easy but because we are so close that we kinda knew what each other will like. Omg i&#39;m digressing, the attention should be on you not me. Ok yes, so, you&#39;ve also been a super good listening ear to all my problems, whether school, boys or friends. And though we might have our downs sometimes, I knew I couldn&#39;t afford to lose you as a friend...

Ahhh, we entered university and began a new chapter of our lives. I think we were probably too busy with school and our other halves that we didn&#39;t make much time for one another. Hence, the lack of nice pictures :( Despite this, we would still meet up for those special occasions like birthdays and hmmm... mahjong at Reb&#39;s house?

The year is not over but I can already feel like bigger things are going to happen! Look how we&#39;ve grown up omg. Look at youuuu. SO pretty and sexy now weet weet. Am glad that even now in our 2nd year of uni and with Reb working all, we can still find time for each other i.e. Starbucks meetup occasionally or just going out for a meal :) It&#39;s nice to know there&#39;s always a group of friends you can count on to talk about anything. I&#39;m thankful that God brought us together and pray that He will guide us to accomplish greater things in life ^^

It&#39;s time for my heartfelt words to end so&nbsp;Happy 21st again my dear, love you! Study hard for your exams too :)</div>"

The last time I had a birthday party at my house was when I was 10. I didn&#39;t even think of doing anything big for my 21st but just rly wanted to have all my good friends over to celebrate this moment with me. Hence, 2 weeks before the actual date, I suddenly announced to my parents that I will be hosting a party on the 5th. Luckily they were really supportive. At first I wanted my parents to cook for my friends but as days went by, I realised that there might just be too many people to cook for. Hence my mum settled on getting a caterer + my grandma volunteered to cook her special awesome chicken curry just to add on one more dish ^^ All that was left was the decorations which was quite a bitch because of the theme I picked: &nbsp; CANDY CRUSH. Piece of advice for party planners, don&#39;t think colourful is fun, it&#39;s crazy when it comes to deco.

Every deco in my house was DIY-ed with a lot of help from Rebecca, Lilin, Mivio and Grace :) I basically bought every single colour of crepe paper to do up the colourful photo wall. Just cutting them up in strips and hanging them on a ribbon which was then fastened to the sides of the wall. I thought the crepe paper would be long enough to cover the wall but nah. It&#39;s alrightttt. So then, the photo booth props came into the picture. I found free printables online and just downloaded them, print, cut and stick onto foams. The only hiccup here was, I stuck the mustaches all wrong side up :P Ah well.

I have this long big white wall in my living room and couldn&#39;t really think of what to do with it. Actually wanted to spam colourful tissue balls on them like what I see online. But it was really too much work so in the end Rebecca helped me with the Joanna&#39;s 21st cutouts. I thought it was damn weird to cut my own name out haha cuz usually I do cards for people and i&#39;ve never done my own name before duh. We used this nice turquoise glittery foam that made me regret choosing a colourful theme and not like..... pastel. or green and white. or something else. haha OWELL.

But in the end I still manage to pull off everything including this little candy bar ^^ Didn&#39;t have time to get more sweets or like cupcakes though but lucky I had a lot of plain white bowls and plates to display the stuff.

Really really am so thankful for my dad and mom. My mom especially for being SOOO patient with me the whole night. Even towards the end, I keep bugging her to help me with this with that, she just willingly did everything without a word of complain. Sigh, so touched by her actions. And oh do you like my cake? Does it look like the candy crush combo ball? Hehehe need to thank LINGYU for settling this for me. So glad that we got closer this sem. Y&#39;all don&#39;t always say what when Matt comes back I will ditch u all leh, I cross my heart now and promise I will still reply your texts and not be a bastard and leave the whatsapp group HAHA.

This one my jar of hearts. Hahaha thank you Matthew Chay for sending these lovely roses in the morning on my birthday. Not just this, he even specially ordered 21 mini boxes of awfully chocolate ice cream for my party. So timely cuz now I have something to serve as desserts (after the cake haha yes just to make everyone fat) AND i still have like 5 left in the fridge YAY ME ^^ (INSERTS GLEEFUL SMILE) This deserves the best boyfriend award. I love you. Even though he couldn&#39;t be present, we facetimed during the party and it was nice to see his happy face. My friends carried him around on an ipod dock and took turns to entertain him while I cut the cake and break the pinata hehe.

Heh in the pictures above you can see how my pinata looks like before it got destroyed. I had a tough time breaking it because I HAVE NO STRENGTH WHATSOEVER DON&#39;T LAUGH. In the end I only managed to break the head from the body LAME. The sweets didn&#39;t even sprinkle out like it&#39;s supposed to haha fail. So I was allowed to take off my blindfold and break it :P

Group photo with all the lovely people ^^ Thank you everyone for coming and making this night a special one for me. The next day when I woke up, the house felt terribly weird without all the noise and laughter. Haha I can see myself in the future hosting a lot of parties in my big big house (Matt pls note) and inviting everyone over to eat drink and be merry ^^

Thank you for alllll your presents! I think I privately messaged everyone to thank them but just want to shoutout here, I really appreciate all the heartfelt words in your cards and the presents you guys sincerely picked out for me. THANK YOU &lt;3

To all the facebook, twitter and instagram wishes, thank you! Always a joy to receive a blessing from someone whom I&#39;ve lost touched with because it made me think back on all the good times we once had but now can&#39;t because of circumstances. Just know that deep down in my heart, I will always remember and cherish that friendship with you :)

Now that I&#39;m 21, it&#39;s time to be more mature. NOT. Hahahaha. As much as I&#39;m excited to see what the future will bring, I just want to be in my 20s forever and not grow old and stuff. No, that wasn&#39;t my birthday wish haha. And now I&#39;ll just abruptly end my post here and get back to studying.

It&#39;s 2 more weeks to Paris to see my love, and i really can&#39;t wait!!! ^^</div>"

In the past two years, I think I&#39;ve relied heavily on my instincts and not what people say/think. Which is good because if not I would have missed out on many opportunities in school. From organizing random events to joining a case competition, all these rly exposed me to learn much more than what the courses/modules in school offer. I think the first step you can take is be initiative because these opportunities are not gonna present themselves on a plate to you. Like for my internship, I sat down one day and figured out the industry I wanted to work in and then drafted a gazillion emails to send out. And well, it was worth it because the next few days I got not just one, but several calls from interested companies (even tho some are small firms), but I felt relieved because finally something was falling into place. Now I can&#39;t wait to start my marketing internship at Royal Caribbean!

Ok gonna go find some food to eat! Only had wanton mee and bread the whole day :O</div>"

I like to travel, eat, photoshop (though i&#39;m quite a noob), so yes I think I will probably continue doing all these more often. I think by uni everyone would have discovered some rare passion or interest in something, what with the gazillion CCAs in school. I&#39;ve met people who skydive, ski, backpack, DJ, and it&#39;s always inspiring to talk to these people and find out why they like what they like. For me it&#39;s like, I want to travel because I want to see the world and everytime I&#39;m overseas, there&#39;s this sense of euphoria that I can&#39;t get from being in Singapore. Maybe it&#39;s the feeling of discovering something new and unfamiliar. Photoshop let&#39;s see....I picked it up in 2011 when we had to design some posters for a school event? (thanks) I think maybe because it demands a lot of attention to detail and I am quite OCD so can spend like 4-5 hours playing around and not get sick of it. But of course I&#39;m really a noob compared to my genius friends who do like freelance and projects. But hey, I&#39;m here to learn ^^ a kind friend of mine has offered to teach some lessons in the summer for a friendship price heh heh so i&#39;m looking forward to that! Hoping to achieve those skillz that killz.

People that makes me happy....hmm. Definitely Matt &lt;3 and all my friends.&nbsp;Recently did some course surveys that repeatedly asked if we have a choice to choose who we hang out with and if we did not like the group, do we have the choice to leave?
<span style=""line-height: 1.4;"">I don&#39;t think anyone is forced to hang out with anyone but that you have 100% freedom to choose your own friends. And i</span><span style=""line-height: 1.4;"">f you abhor the people you are currently hanging out with, pls save yourself from misery and hop along. You&#39;ll probably gain more than you lose :)

Ok wow that&#39;s a lot of words. Anyway, this is just a small inspiration project to keep my blog alive so i&#39;ll be posting 20 habits up in the form of pictures/words and these are actually taken from <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/elite/2012/20-good-habits-start-20s/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.

1 month to see my boy in Paris! So excited to a point that I am about to give up on my revision and just screw everything, pack &amp; go. But nooooo that can&#39;t happen or else my GPA is hitting rock bottom. I am so bad at prioritizing really. Everytime I get down to studying, there&#39;s something that steals my attention away, especially when it&#39;s Photoshop-related. Gahhh need to stop spending so much time playing around. But i really like it help :(

The NUS Pitch It Marketing competition is happening this saturday. My team and I got into the final round with abt 7 other teams from other universities and polytechnics. Quite nervous about it. First prize is like $2k cash or something. Hope we do well!!! Sigh, I should get back to my readings/editing my pitch/finishing up acct report/studyyyy.
Or maybe just sleep....?</div>"

<div style=""text-align: center;"">Hi peeps. So. Did you know that PAUL (at Takashimaya beside Kino) has awesome Cr&egrave;me br&ucirc;l&eacute;e? If you like sweet things go try it! But best is share it with your friends so the sweetness will not be too jelat. I went with the girls and we had that and a raspberry tart which is not as mindblowing. Love the interior of the place though!

So yesterday I went on a tour of two of our ships, Legend of the Seas and Voyager of the Seas. Oh yes btw I got accepted so I&#39;ll be doing a marketing internship at Royal Caribbean for 14 weeks in the summer. ^^ Always been fascinated by how big cruise ships can get and how it can have soooo many facilities and whatnot. So back to the tour. It was just to explore the ships, eat free buffet and take lots of pictures. Apparently the staff gets discounts so they always go on the cruises. The food was not too shabby! I love the rooms with the balcony view cos the view is stunning and it just feels damn shiok to wake up and see the sea beneath you. I wish I could go on a fancy nancy romantic cruise with my boy someday :) (gay la sorry)

Okay it&#39;s time to start studying and stop wasting my time online!!! </div>"

My life has been pretty mundane so don&#39;t expect anything exciting up here... Remaining projects include Management Accounting and Knowledge Management. Zzz i don&#39;t understand why are accounting mods a prerequisite for business students. Isn&#39;t it self explanatory that i chose Business and NOT acct or econs or wtv pfft. But anyway. I&#39;m just glad school&#39;s ending. The sem ends on 5th April aka My 21st hehe. I have no idea what I&#39;ll be doing for my birthday cuz it seems like everyone is just too busy with school and projects and whatnot. Maybe I&#39;ll just stay at home and FaceTime Matt. Or study for the final papers. Sian I have no life la. Can&#39;t wait for the day I touch down at Paris and see him. The flight there will probably be the longest 12 hours ever. School is draining me of my energy srsly. Everyday I come home I just want to sleep. Ytd my mum bought home some new pillows for me. So touched :&#39;)

It is time. To get back to editing my MA report.</div>"

</div><div style=""text-align: center;""><br />Thank God for friends who look after me when Matt&#39;s away. Just wanna thank all those (you know who you are!) whether in SMU or not. You will have good karma next time when I&#39;m rich and successful or something haha! Anyway, it&#39;s been about 2 weeks now. I&#39;m surviving pretty well... Of course I&#39;d feel sad or maybe sometimes cry when I feel helpless about things (like stupid FaceTime that only works on Wifi). But I try my best to be strong and not get too affected. Anyway, I&#39;m gna fly over to Paris when my last paper ends on 22nd April so the thought of that makes everything seem less gloomy. Will get to travel a bit w Matt before I come back for internship and work my ass off while he finishes the rest of his semester. Next year when I go on exchange it&#39;ll be like this all over again. But it will be different cuz this time I&#39;m not the one left behind.. But I&#39;m so thankful that this boy is so concerned for me even though he&#39;s so busy overseas settling in. Always checking on me and stuff. Communication is key my dear friends.

Anyway, went for my marketing internship interview today. I emailed them a week ago and managed to get a call back.The interview was great, the only thing is, I couldn&#39;t commit for 16 weeks cos they usually have interns for uh 6 months. But I said I don&#39;t mind like skipping first 1-2 weeks of school to help them. What a sacrifice. The pay is cui and I pray I won&#39;t work too long hours or do mundane tasks. ^^ Hope the reply is good.

Sigh April needs to come like now now now.

Uh oh my blog is starting to look bad with all these party photos.&nbsp;These were exactly one week ago when Matt played at Avalon&#39;s Spider Room for Aussie Day. Spent a long time deciding if I should go down and in the end I thought I shouldn&#39;t miss his last gig before his exchange. So there, +gf points hehe. Had a great time with the girls! We need to have more chill sessions together :-)

My week has been pretty mundane. School is getting busy with presentations in the next 2 weeks. Plus an accounting test on Wed. CNY approaching = deadlines approaching so I&#39;m not really looking forward to dat. But then...I can&#39;t wait to feast!! Steamboat, reunion dinner, potluck, cny goodies etc etc. O_O

One more week to get through!"

I had been looking forward to this since last year and can&#39;t believe it&#39;s now over. Damn, I wish I could go for every electro gig and festival. Maybe during exchange in Europe. So here&#39;s some photos (and a shaky video) that do not do justice to the awesome setup and production of Swedish House Mafia.<br />

Crayyy night with constant flow of drinks 2 wks ago at Mink to celebrate Yuqing&#39;s 21st! Hope you had a good time bbg!! It&#39;s impossible to find a nice group photo of everyone cuz almost all the pictures have LEGS behind us. The dancefloor was just behind us so 50% of pictures are filled with legs in action. See how i tried to blur them legs out lol. Looks SO bad. But still, great night with the girls. Wish we could meet up more often in daylight. Ok la CNY party comin&#39; uppppp."

2012 has been both good and bad. I found love in a hopeless place (as cheesy as it sounds) but also experienced a great loss. Looking bad, I&#39;m not sure how much I grew as a person but probably (and hopefully) more patient, loving and mature. This year, I met so many wonderful friends and I just wanna thank you for being a page in my story.&nbsp;Though some friends eventually drift apart, I&#39;m most thankful for my steady group of girls who will always be there for me. You know who you are guys. I love you loads! I also managed to travel quite a lot despite the tight schedules and hope I can keep up with that before working life kicks in. And to the most amazing person who &quot;doesn&#39;t have to be right but just doesn&#39;t have to be wrong&quot;, thank you for loving me. I know that you know that I hate it when you&#39;re right but at the end of the day, you always are. I like how we are so alike and sometimes even say the same things simultaneously. You can sniff out even my tiniest sad moment and never fail to cheer me up &amp; make all my problems go away. Even though you are going through the roughest patch now, just know that I will always be here for you and that I love you &lt;3

Here&#39;s my 2012 in photos:

Photos from Bali (which are all taken by my iPhone and edited with Photo Wonder)

Many people asked about the accomodation which we stayed in. It&#39;s basically a 3-bedroom villa with private pool that we found on Airbnb (<a href=""https://www.airbnb.com.sg/rooms/439379"" target=""_blank"">https://www.airbnb.com.sg/rooms/439379</a>)&nbsp;It only cost $90ish per person for a total of 4D3N and there were six of us staying together. It&#39;s not very far off from the main area (Seminyak) and you can just walk out or take a cab. Cab fares are dirt cheap so no worries. We also had a housekeeper coming in every day at 11am to clean up our mess. The owner Christophe is super friendly and he even helped us out when we got hit badly by a monsoon on Day 2. The rain was so insane that the waters flooded into our rooms even though the windows were shut tight. The room I shared with Kaili kena the worst. Our bags were left on the floor and everything was soaked. Even my passport. Dayummmm. The arrival stamp that I got from the airport couldn&#39;t be found and I was so scared that I won&#39;t be able to leave Bali. Fortunately the airport people rly don&#39;t give a shit, they just wrote my &#39;In&#39; date above the &#39;Out&#39; stamp. Thank God.

So, how do you spend 4D3N in Bali? Almost everyday involved swimming/drinking/eating indo food/chilling. Super relaxing. Indo food is gooood. Minus the chilli. And you can club everyday in Bali too. Because everyone&#39;s there for a holiday~~ we went to Sky Garden one night and I had the worst hangover the next morning. Insane. Not touching vodka in another 8253632 years. We also went to Potato Head, a beach club which was full of ang mohs. Avoid going there if you are self conscious of your body. Ok kidding. No but seriously, almost everyone there had the perfect tan and body. I was just hiding my gems in the waters of the Infinity Pool.. Also went all the way out to Rock Bar, which is really a bar by the rocks. The journey there took like half an hour. But the view was quite worth it. Saw a romantic wedding at sunset! But that was the hangover day so I pretty much felt like shit the entire day...

Found 200,000 rupiah in my shorts yesterday!! So happy cos that was the money I thought I lost the night we went to Sky Garden!!
Lost AND found. Oh and if you are thinking of doing a manicure/pedicure in Bali, either find a good manicurist or don&#39;t do it at all. Kaili got two of her fingers cut by this young girl who took half an hour to paint her nails. Scary... Oh but the body massage was good. Only 75,000 Rupiah for 1 hour. Couldn&#39;t have felt more energized after.

This trip was worth it after all :)</center>"

Went to support our men at a floorball match agst each other just now. Ate at Two Chefs after the match and spent the rest of the night at Grace&#39;s, watching live streaming on the Man U match (don&#39;t ask) and other retarded videos. Love chill nights like these :&gt;

Flying to Bali tmr at 12pm with the Stereometa gang. Can&#39;t wait to spend four days living eating and chilling like a king. Just hope the monsoon weather will calm its tits down for us. Here we comeeeeee~"

Just bought 3 pairs of shoes from Taobao hehe so excited!&nbsp;I must be rewarding myself for all the hard work last week.
Can&#39;t decide if I should get the last one in black or brown though! Yay they will probably arrive around New Year&#39;s. New shoes for the new year ^^

My mum is so awesome she bought me some crayon lip balms for ma lips.&nbsp;So far I&#39;ve only tried the orange one but am loving it already. Not only does it moisturize, it also adds a slight tinge of colour. The only colour I probably won&#39;t use is the dark shade of red. Don&#39;t rly like it and can&#39;t picture myself in it haha. Anyway I think it&#39;s a great Christmas gift idea for girls. Who doesn&#39;t like lipbalms!! PLUS now it&#39;s lipstick/lipbalm. *.*&nbsp;

Okay time to catch up with my all time favourite buddy otherwise known as Sleep. Gonna attempt whipping up some good ol&#39; aglio olio with Matt tmr. Can&#39;t wait! Good night xx"

Now I&#39;m looking forward to my legit first-job-after-uni pay cheque ^^ Ok hopefully I&#39;m more motivated to study for the remaining 2 papers! Somehow I always end up feeling very aimless and lost during exam week. Like I can see the world turn around me while I go about the usual routine of sleep, study, repeat, and I just feel so detached from everything around me. Gahhh just need to survive until Monday and then my life will return to normal happy cotton candy style.<br />"

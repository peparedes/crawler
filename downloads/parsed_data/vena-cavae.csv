A bit like that but it'll have a normal front closure. I'm so excited, it's being custom made from the US so it should fit great. from http://www.meschantes.com (I've heard really good reviews about them). The prices are good too :)

It was a tough decision to go for the white, as I'm going to have to think hard about outfits.. I wanted something a little bit different, but the price you pay is that it's not as flexible as for instance plain black.

Any ideas? I have a few for general and clubbing outfits, it's really fun having something new so that I can't just mould back into my normal combinations with. Lingerie, of course, will be easy ^^


As for the rest of stuff, I screwed over one exam this week, and the other wasn't bad. Oh well. I've gotten the hardest over with, I can hopefully take the weekend to relax and catch up on sleep.."

"event","People are so <i>rude</i>. The more I work at the bookshop, the more I notice that people are fucking morons everywhere else. I know everyone who has ever worked in retail has just as many horror stories up their sleeves, but it's irritating going home in a rage so often. It's the elderly, and the mothers. The middle-aged and the people my age are all nice as pie.

Nnnngh.

An odd thing happened today. I went on a little quest to the dodgy end of my town looking for a new amplifier and set of speakers... the used electronics store was open, playing all the TVs and there was a half-drunk cup of tea on the desk, but nobody anywhere to be seen.. I could easily have run off with anything I fancied, especially as when I called the man said he wouldn't be back for an hour and 45 minutes... I was sitting in this abandoned shop waiting for someone to turn up for about ten minutes feeling like a criminal ^^

Didn't get any amp or speakers though. This is getting irritating.<br>

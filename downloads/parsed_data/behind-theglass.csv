AnywayS, I am leaving you at livejournal and switching over to Xanga, because it is supreme to Livejournal. AND because this site is stupid and I cannot access it from home, only from school and the office, so it seems really pointless to have an LJ if I can never update it at home. SO, yeah. Come visit! I will post a link to it when I have it ready for ya'll, but the user name will be the same. Just search for Behind_theglass. Peace and love, goodbye forever.

"event","<P><FONT color=#ff0000 size=5>Ok, it has been such a long long long time since I have gotten back up in here. Sorry. I cannot access the site from my house, so I didn't really check on it at all over the summer. I just happen to have a couple of open hours free today so that I why I came wandering back. Accually, I was reading Jameson and Stephanies Xangas and that reminded me of the whole LJ thing, so alas, I am back. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000 size=5>So much to catch up on!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000 size=5>Here's the skinny:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc size=5>Trout was awesome as always, Sonshine was okay, cross country trip was decent (everything seems so long ago) and for the most part, senior year is awesome compared to every other year in this place. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc size=5>Right now our school is pretty hyped over the whole football thing (as they should be) so we go play at the dome tonight. It is going to be AWESOME, I am so glad my coach talked me into doing it this year. We play Champlin tonight, and when we win, we will play Wayzata (probably) for state. State will be a hard game because Wayzata will be out for blood since we pretty much humiliated them on their homecoming this year, so that should be a super good time. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6633ff size=5>Um, yeah, life is good. I am falling waaay behind on my small group responsibilities and I have to teach this Sunday since Katherine is going to be outta town. I have no idea what I am going to teach on yet, considering I haven't gone through the lesson for the week yet. Ah, the downfalls of being lazy.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6633ff size=5>This weekend should be fun, after the game I will probably head over to Applebees with Ben and whoever else wants to come, maybe even play some Halo afterwords. What is sad is that I have Halo, and Halo 2, but I have only played it once. It was the old version too. I stink at video games like that. Anyways, back on track again...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff9900 size=5>I am totally jealous because Jameson has left for France. Paris specifically. He gets to see Yann! I wish I was going, I had a chance to talk to Yann online over MSN which I haven't gotten to do since, I don't know, the beginning of October probably, so that was super. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000 size=5>Oh and I finally got my Bethel application sent to admissions (it was funny because all of my references probably arrived before my application did). I was waiting on my ACT score, which finally came last week. It was a huge risk to put it off until this October, but what good would I do on a standardized test without some good old fashioned pressure? I got a pretty good score, which pleased the parents and I got my dad to consider letting me work at Trout at least half the summer because the score racked up some scholarship coinage. I am going to take it again though. I really really want to get a 30. But if I don't, no big deal. I will just be in debt for the rest of my life because my parents can in no way pay for me to go to Bethel, but we probably won't qualify for substancial financial aid, so I will be working my butt off. Yeah, that is pretty much what is stressing me out right now, which is why that paragraph is so long. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc66cc size=5>This is maybe the first time I didn't have a whiney, life sucks LJ. Change is good, eh?</FONT></P>"

<P><FONT color=#cc33cc size=2><STRONG><EM>So on friday I went to see Shrek Dos (hilarious movie!) and then went to hang at Jameson's after. That was pretty sweet. </EM></STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc size=2><STRONG><EM>Saturday was so much fun! I slept in and cleaned (well that wasn't so fun) the house for my uncle and aunt who are coming into town tonight, and then I went to Liz's grad party. After that, we all headed over to Starring Lake Park for the other grad party (it was combined, so there were a lot of people there). Then it started pouring down rain, so Ryan, Katie, Andrew and I went and frolicked in the rain. I love doing that, it is so fun. </EM></STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc size=2><STRONG><EM>We all headed over to my house after the party and started watching zoolander, but then we decided to go to target to pick up some rubber bands to pour on Jameson's driveway. We then headed over to Jameson's and proceeded to throw rubber bands about, but then Emmy thought someone was coming and ran... so we all ran after her, and it was a false alarm! It was so funny! So then we went back adn finished up, Steph took a picture in front of his door next to all the plastic eggs, and then we all took off running back to the getaway cars for real. Yup.</EM></STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc size=2><STRONG><EM>Then I took Andrew home, and after that, Steffi and I went on an 'adventure' to her house. It was way fun, and since we are both sort of directionally challenged, we had a long time to talk, so that was really cool. We also saw a van that looked like the Mystery Machine! It was so cool! So I sped up to drive next to it so we could wave and point, and the guy who was driving must have thought we were crazy, but he gave us the 'nod of approval' to our antics, and all was good. So that was my crazy saturday.</EM></STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc size=2><STRONG><EM>Today I got to wear my uber cool skirt that is all crazy looking, so that was exciting. It was also really weird to see all the new faces in Sr. High... but really cool. When i wasn't looking, Jameson and Jake snuck away to plastic wrap my car, and I started getting suspicious when Chris told me he wanted to walk me to my car... and everyone followed, and then alas, there it was. I got a picture, and there was fun had by all.</EM></STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#cc33cc size=2><STRONG><EM>I then went home to weed the lawn, finish up cleaning the house, put away laundry, then go to the office and clean the office. (boring and boring). Then I went to Katie's grad par-tay and got to meet David, the new college dude, so that was cool. </EM></STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc size=2><STRONG><EM>Now I am just procrastinating because I don't want to study. But I probably should... my big spanish final of death is tomorrow. Woot. So yeah, this weekend was an answer to prayer, I finally learned the trick to feel care-free: just&nbsp;decide not to&nbsp;care. Hence the&nbsp;'free' part of&nbsp;'care-free'. If only I had known this sooner... :)&nbsp;</EM></STRONG></FONT></P>"

I was told by someone that the big huge paper of death was due today and I thought it was due tomorrow. So I asked the teacher if I could go get a drink, and sort of walked to the 'bubbler' in a daze contemplating wether or not I could convince the nurse I was sick enough to go home because the more and more I kept thinking about the paper and the huge tests that day, I got all freaked out. (Normally I wouldn't have cared, but it was the biggest paper of the year in English, and I also had the biggest test of the year in that class today, and she didn't accept late papers whatsoever.) Well, I ran into steph in the hall, she told me that the paper was not due, and that the final was not even that hard. Talk about major relief! </STRONG></FONT></FONT></P>

It has left me feeling sort of blah.&nbsp;Friday was cool cuz we got to go to Sarah's. It was fun to just run around outside and have fun, being crazy. Then I came back in when everyone else was still outside and played Sukie's guitar until everyone started piling back into the&nbsp;apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwords we went to ""stargaze""&nbsp; at the park (there were no stars though, just rain) got kicked out by a cool cop, then hung out at wendy's and taco bell. Good times. Saturday I got to SLEEP IN. It was wonderful. Then I went to a movie with a buddy from escuela and that was way fun. We then went to Amelia's house to watch movies, but her brother was home from college and all his friends were sort of drunk, so it was a little weird. Then they stunk up the house with their smoke, so that was&nbsp; gross. Um, Sunday I went to church and to Culvers, then driving around, and ended up at Caribou and visited Katie. That was fun, I love just not having to think, just drive around with the windows down, and singing along to the radio. Good stuff. That night Karen, Stacy and I were going to go to a movie, but that fell through, so we hung out on the top of the parking ramp in Hopkins and it was way fun. We got to talk to John! Ah, I miss him so much, he is so crazy. I feel bad though, cuz' it was like an hour or something long distance charges that he had to pay to talk to us, but I am sure it was worth it. Haha. I got to talk to Stacy and Karen a lot too, and that was cool, and I am so glad that you have no boy problems at the moment Karen! Maybe I will just become a nun. Haha. I fell asleep while watching Uptown Girls , so Stacy and I watched it today before going to the Memorial Day picnic, and it was a good movie. The picnic was boring (just like every year), but Kenny drove by (my mom used to work at a camp, and he was the director of the camp, so he has known me from when I was born) and yelled my name out of his Timber Bay van, and I got all confused because I didn't know who he was at first, but then he stopped and I went up to the window and was like ... ""oh. Hi!"" It was fun to see him again. He had taken a group of guys from my school up to the boundary waters, and when I leaned into the van to see their faces, but they all sort of turned away, so I couldn't tell who anyone was. Awkward! So yeah, that is what happened in my boring life this weekend. I have to study. Boo Studying. I have to talk to my teacher in Spanish tomorrow for one of my finals, and I don't know what to say. I am scared. Oh well. I am outta here.</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>"

<P><FONT color=#3366ff size=4><STRONG>Friday- Falling up concert, that was cool, they are talented, fun to listen to in concert. I only wish I had known more of their songs, I could only sing along to 3 or 4. Maybe I will buy the CD. Hemo was there! That was way cool. </STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff size=4><STRONG>Saturday- I went sh-sh-shopping with my mom and bought some ropa. I also got my hairs cut. Nobody noticed though. Except me, cuz i got bangs now. Sort of. THEN I went to see the battle of the Bands at 5050 and that was fun, Melissa and I are self-proclaimed groupies. I got my name temporarily changed to Karen Kruse... got beaten by chris at air-hockey (only because I was distracted by things like hair and chris's shooter thing flying across the room) and invented a new game with the things hanging on the walls of the hallway. Good times. Brett and I chatted, at the time I was sorta sad, but now I am okay with it all. He is a smart guy, that Brett. </STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff size=4><STRONG>Sunday--- was so fun! Sr. High was cool with all the seniors talking, went to 'big service' (haha manservent is a funny word... stacy and I were discussing this in service... and kept laughing whenever leith would use it in his sermon. haha). We all went out to lunch after words, ran around in the rain, went to EP center to hot topic, then I went home. THEN I went to the senior service, and senior party. That was really sad. But happy too. </STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff size=4><STRONG>Moooonday- um, monday was a blur. All I remember was cheerleading practice. It was so fun to be back with my seemingly family again. Yay cheerleaders. I got to be the scoop instead of the flyer now! (I bribed my coach into letting me not fly anymore... he he he ::michevious laugh:::) So yeah... that was fun. </STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff size=4><STRONG>Tuesday- I don't remember tuesday at all. Sad. Oh yeah, the Wolves lost. Which is especially sad for me because I have money riding on this series. (sure, it is only a dollar... but it is the principle of the thing...) </STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff size=4><STRONG>Wednesday! Carpenter's Shop Cafe! That was uber fun, I enjoyed it very much. My buddy from school came and he had fun too, so that made me happy. Went to applebees and got made fun of. Jeff Anderson told me not to wear make-up anymore. I told him that he couldn't tell me what to do. </STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff><STRONG><FONT size=4>Today! Um, I went to school, all the seniors got to go to a retreat, I was jealous. I came home, Chilled around the casa, made dinner, then went to Adels with Andy and then on to Minnetonka Music to buy a distortion petal for the geetar. good times, except they didn't have the right violin strings, just the cheapos. I was not happy. But now I am because the Wolves are a point ahead as of now. Yay. And I am listening to Ashlee Simpson, and I like her song a lot a lot. Yay. I like to sing and jive along. <EM>On a Monday I am waiting, on a tuesday I am fading, then on wednesday I can hardly sleep...</EM></FONT></STRONG></FONT></P>"

Sorry about all the complaining last night... oh, and the song lyrics didn't really have anything to do with anything... it wasn't like a message about how I was feeling yesterday or anything, I just wanted to have the lyrics for later.

<P><FONT color=#6600cc><STRONG>Today it was a total conspiracy! Every class talked about the DaVinci code! Even in Spanish! (yes, with the gay spanish teacher...

As soon as you stepped through my door,
I saw You for the first time all over again.
And time well spent seems 
Lonelier than the way it used to go.

As I smell you for the first time all over again
I'll begin to remember to be alive
So if you don't mind
I think I'll wear my heart on my sleeve,
'Cause I'm tired of not being able to breathe.

All of us are searching for an open arm.
Well, it's a shame how I curl up in the dark
When it's the same old word giving me the spark.

I've felt a loss for some time
I slipped, stumbled, but fell face first 
straight into your hand.
Then I hit my head on your palm
And waking up to the smell
Of tears drying up in the sand

All of us are searching for an open arm.

(All of us are searching for an open arm)

Blindside~ All of Us


    Anyways... (yes, anyways) I was thinking about it... this journal thing is a thing of beauty because you can spill your guts on it, get the satisfaction of getting it out, without feeling like you just dumped a burden on someone with your drama while talking with them over coffee, on the phone, or in the car (sorry bout that one time chris...). So yeah, if you get annoyed, then you can just close the window. (Take that as my disclaimer).

Well well well. Where should I begin. Ever have one of those days where people pretty much don't seem to care, or know that you are there? For example, lets say I skipped this whole day and stayed home, I doubt anyone would really notice. Maybe my lunch table would notice. But that is pretty much it. It is so frusterating... sometimes I just feel so used because people come to me with their problems, and we talk about it, but then when I need someone to talk to, nobody really seems to be there. Don't get me wrong, I love talking to people about their problems and stuff, and I really wish that certain people would talk to me more about what is going on in their lives... but that is a different story. I guess I just feel over-burdened. 

THEN there are the people who are all like ""bri, you are so lucky. You have the perfect life. Why would you have any problems... you seem to happy to get all full of 'issues'"". People like that piss me off to no end. Just thought I would share. Obviously they really don't know me as well as they think. Whatev.

My spanish teacher is gay. Just found out today. That was a shocker. Well, now that I think about it... not really.

I cannot wait until this weekend is over and everyone will stop talking about PROM! My school has gone freaking crazy! I feel like if I had a dollar for every time someone has asked me if I was going to prom, or why I was not going to prom and why, I would be about 30 bucks richer right now. No joke. 

Maybe I am just all wacked up because I haven't been to bible study in like, 2 or 3 weeks. It has been so long... I am just really spiritually hungry. I guess Katherine is the other person I can dump my burdens on because that is what she is there for. Plus, when I talk to her, even when I decide ahead of time not to say anything, I end up spilling my guts, and feeling so much better, and get so much insight. Such a God-Thing. 

Why is it so hard go feel full and at peace when you are in high school... or anytime in your life? My moments of peace last for a day, and then things seem to go bad again. There is always one more thing that could be different to make things better... the end of the comp season, when that was over, it was to get a huge paper and speech done, after that, it was to get my spritual life more in depth in the word daily, then boom, march just had to suck with just about everything taht had been going right before so hey here I go again. Now I find myself in May, no idea how I got here, things have been so bumpy.

I cannot wait to go to trout to escape most of this reality which is sucky. I cannot wait to build into the girls I am going to meet! Especially lately, I have just been so anxious to build into someones life that is younger than me, because I feel like that is something I am really missing out on right now, ever since I stopped babysitting. I have no little kids to love! Boo hoo for me. Anyways, moving on.

It is really getting late, 11:22... I need to be at school early tomorrow for a dress rehearsal for our concert tomorrow night! I am so excited about this concert, it is going to be so sweet. Our songs we are playing are going to rock, they sound so good. I don't know how pirates of the caribbian is going to sound with the younger kids... having 100+ kids on the stage will mess up the sound a little. Nobody else seems all that excited though... the only person who would care enough to come and listen is Kaylee, but she is way over in Colorado. Stacy makes fun of orchestra all the time, (the last time she heard us was back in 5th or 6th grade) and she refuses to come and listen during the dress rehearsal, even though she is going to be at school. She would rather sit in the cafeteria by herself instead of let me proover her wrong; i mean heck, it has been 3 conductors and concerts and trips later than she heard us, so it has been a long time since we were bad. We kick butt now, so there.

Dude, this is like the length of some of my English quote analysis papers. Looks boring too. Oh well, if you read this whole thing, you should get an award. It would read something like this:
            Congratulations!
            You now know a little bit more about what goes on in Bri's head...
            Or, now you think she is a psycho. 
            Maybe both.
                                                  -But thanks for caring none-the-less."

Well it is working, because I am believing it! So yeah, the past couple of days have been good,  yesterday (wednesday) was sweet, I got to talk to people and have a good time. Eh, my happy mood just turned to less than happy because I just got yelled at. Man, times like now make me wish I was living on my own. I don't know, blah blah blah. Anyways, I am WAY excited for trout this weekend, to meet all the new people, and see old buddies. Woot for a weekend outta the house! WEll, I guess that is all for now. I have a lack of motivational quote or song lyric to end with, so this will have to do. (This is a quote by my lovely english teacher, Mrs. Van Pilsam after seeing some skanky sophmores throw wrappers out the window of their car, and seeing them in the parking lot) ""I just wanted to tell them that I hoped that they would sleep in trash, get caught and severely punished, I wanted to see them suffer for this!"" (It made my day, because it was totally unreleated to what we were talking about, and I am not a fan of Minnetonka sophmore girls. Except for Jenna, Tibbie and Sarah. But that's it.)*randomness alert!*"

Also, I was thinking to myself, ""why aren't there any fun songs about being seventeen?"" because I really am not enjoying being seventeen right now. So, I found a fun song by Tim McGraw...

Backseat of her daddy's car
I was trying not to go too far
Kept thinking about the words the preacherman said
Lightnin' flashed across the sky
I saw love in a young girl's eyes
And that's a look you never forget

Seventeen only comes once in a lifetime
Don't it just fly by wild and free
Goin any way the wind blew, baby

Seventeen, livin on crazy dreams

Rock and roll and faded blue jeans
And standing on the edge of everything
Seventeen

Legs hangin' off the Bayou Bridge
Feedin' fish potato chips
And talkin' about the mysteries of the universe
Yeah, the world was somewhere else
We had the Summer all to ourselves
And the stars went off like fireworks

Seventeen only comes once in a lifetime

"event","Yeah, I didn't have school today, and it was super boring! Everyone was either gone, or decaring it a ""no hanging out with Brianna day"". Stupid Minnetonka people. I watched CSI, and that is all I really remember doing. Oh, and going to school to talk to my coaches and watch as Reid locked his keys in his car. Those were good times though. Silly guy, that Reid.
After I left the school, I didn't want to go home because my parents were all up in my face, so I drove around for a while. I had brought my CDs to Iowa, so they were still in my dad's car, leaving me without music, so I turned off the radio and just sang Sanctuary over and over, and just sort of prayed. It was really cool because I really needed that right then, and eventually I turned back towards home and here I am I guess.  
Anyways, I had that picture up yesterday, but I decided it bordered on the creepy side, so I took it down. Maybe I will put up a new one. We will see.
Ever feel like you are standing still while the entire world is going a bazillion miles per hour around you? Sometimes I feel like just sitting down and waiting for someone to come yank me back up, because I am sick of trying catch up with everything.
Well I am outta here, I need to sleep really bad. School tomorrow. I am accually excited to see civilization again."

"event","Well well well. I am bad at updating this on a regular basis, but whatever. I am listening to Everytime by Britney Spears, and I really really like this song for some reason. I am trying to figure it out on the piano... it doesn't sound too difficult. 

So, I got back from Iowa tonight, and I watched the last episode of Friends with my mother. Yes, my life is that exciting. 

Whenever I go to Iowa I inevitably have a lot of time to just think, and pray, and read (books and the bible). Sometimes I overthink things, sometimes I don't think enough, but this weekend was really good for me because God really told me some things that I needed to hear, and that were really encouraging, sort of to keep me from having a breakdown I suppose. Too much is going on at home at school, and pretty much everywhere else, but now I decided to just let it all go, and I just figure that whatever God wants to happen will happen, without me having to worry about it. 

On saturday, I got home from this church thing my grandma brought me to, and I just got so tired, I fell asleep for 5 hours and was woken up in time for dinner. Things like that sort of worry me sometimes, because, I mean, what if the disease my mom has is hereditary? That would royally suck. 

I guess I will end this on a happy note, my grandparents in Iowa live on a farm, so I got chill with a bunch of baby animals (calves, chicks, and 2 week old kittens.) awwww. I love farms. But it is nice to be back to civilization (or as my hick cousins call it, the ""Big City"". 

I'm outta here..."

"event","Come on
And finally the silence,
looking out, looking back across the sky,
Trying to find a meaning,
knowing that I just left it all behind
Still I smell a lingering softness
Where did she go, how did she go, I wanna know
I wanna know that she'll be coming here to me
Come on, without you I'll never feel the love inside
of me
Come On, you know that we belong
come on, come on
Thinking back before her,
I never knew the meaning of alone
Still the flag is feeling foreign,
I live the day to escape into a phone
Speaking of a world not real then
where did she go how did she go, I wanna know
I wanna know that she'll be coming here to me
Come on...
She's coming, She's coming here to me, I'm needing,
desiring to kiss her now, I'm living for her,
breathing for her, singing for her fairytale.


--Come On, by Ben Jelen


woot. good song, I totally was like, hey, stacy would like this song. Yeah, today was fine. Just like every other day. Alone in a crowd."

"event","Well, I am not very computer savy so it took me a chunk of time to figure this all out. It took me forever to get a name... all the ones I wanted were taken. So, I did this one, it has a meaning, but I don't know how to explain it. It is the name of a song I wrote. Maybe I will put the song in here someday. Today is not that day though.

I am not really sure why I am doing this online journal really, I just wanted to join the fun, add some thoughts, and maybe it will jog my memory in re-writing my real journal in the off chance my locker catches fire and my real journal is burned to death.

Anyways, today was a sweet day, I got to go to see the eagles play some lacrosse. When I came home my dad told me that I had better not get interested in any lacrosse boys, then I informed him I was at a GIRLS game. My dad is crazy. But I love him. 

I got to go to Jimmy Johns or whatever that place was called with Karen after the game... that was yummy... woot! Good times, good times.

***side note, I really really really like certain songs, and if they are extra special, I will put the lyrics in here so I can remember them, and I suppose you all get the joy of reading them. Yay for everyone."

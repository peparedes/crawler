<i>Quinuclidinyl Benzilate</i>

I can't spell it
but I dream about it.

This dream would
be easier to get through
if
I could wake
or see the sun

but

in the night
there's Mason Lancer
syringe in hand

he lectures
he injects
I drown


<i>Potassium Chloride</i>

Full.

Stop.


<i>White Bed, Light Thoughts</i>

When I come back
from the dead (and that's
what it is, you know, dead)
I think
I don't
I shouldn't
be here and
so aware
of what's come crashing down
of
the lives lost.

I say:

It's not like getting
killed
was part of the original
plan.  I
knew it was a risk
but you know, Don,
(no, really you don't)
when you survive Afghanistan
you come back with
your mind
in two extremes.

At the same time you
feel invincible for surviving
you know
that you've been closer to death than
most people will be
before they're old.

Don knows the power of 
just listening
and that's what he does.
Just listens.

I spill.
I tell Don 

everything.
Everything

except
that the part about the tunnel
and the white light
is true.

That's the kind of secret
I could only
share
with Dwayne.

Don's been shot but
never nearly died and I don't need
his pity or
his sympathy
just
his understanding which
I'm sure
I might get
if he'd talk to me instead
of just listening.


<i>The Darkest Hour Before Dawn</i>

It's not every night
but
enough nights
that I sit up
bowl of cereal
infomercials
sometimes reruns of <i>Angel</i>
and I regret.

Regret is
weighted on both sides.
Like, I regret
that my actions got Dwayne killed
and not being able to come clean to Don earlier
and that I had to lie to so many
God, so many people.

But I don't regret
doing the right thing.

At least
I think I don't.

I might know more after
I figure out what
exactly
is the right thing.

I wonder
if the infomercials can help.


<i>In Re: Things I Could Do Right Now if Don Wasn't Sleeping With Liz</i>

Pick up the phone
Hit #2 on speed dial
Remedy.

Drive to his apartment
Tell him my final secrets
Release.

Explain why I did
what I did
Rebuild.

Show him why I belong to
the FBI, his office, his team.
Reestablish.

Back to the stakeouts
to the running and the rush.
Regain.


<i>In Trust</i>

Don's reliability in the field is 
one thing.
His emotional reliability 
(he likes to think he hides it
but dude
glass is less transparent)
is
quite another.

Liz 
wouldn't understand
because
her idea of trust
(where Don is concerned
anyway)
is a little
different than mine.  

For a while
(subway
cell phone
guns
train coming)
I wasn't so sure Don
would be able to 
put himself aside
to realize how much it meant
that I could have called
David
Megan
Alan
Charlie
Larry
but

I called <i>him</i>
because I trusted
<i>him.</i>

Don knows being trusted
is greater than
trusting others

and he might remember that
if he
ever forgives me.


<i>If I Had Three Wishes</i>

1.  I wish my last words to Dwayne Carter hadn't been ""Because I hate owing you.""
2.  I wish my last words to Dwayne Carter hadn't been ""Because I hate owing you.""
3.  I wish my last words to Dwayne Carter hadn't been ""Because I hate owing you.""


<i>Idle Minds Do the Devil's Work</i>

I have 
the cleanest apartment in LA
perfectly feng-shuied furniture
alphabetized all my books by author
and then again by title
run from here to Cleveland and back on my treadmill
watched three Law & Order marathons
learned to make homemade pasta (thank you, Giada DeLaurentis)
ironed all my shirts
visited every legal porn site on the web

and I
am going absolutely crazy.

I stare
at my cell phone, lonely
on the coffee table.

Maybe the Eppes family
wants homemade pasta for dinner.


<i>Where I'd Go If I Wasn't Basically on House Arrest</i>

Despite my newfound skills
of organization
I miss
the controlled chaos
of 
Charlie's office.

I miss his dartboard and
his math toys and
chalk dust
gumballs
papers everywhere
coffee cups
computer cords
scattered books

I could just
sit there
watching him work.

He wouldn't even have
to talk to me
and really
at this point I wouldn't
care if he didn't 
want to.

I could just
sit there

and maybe without my talking
Charlie would know
how much I owe him
how Megan told me he
(of all people!)
was the one who put math aside
and said that they 
could only know
what was in their hearts.

Their hearts.

Charlie.

I'll be damned.


<i>In the Clear</i>

""You're cleared,""
comes the voice from the phone.
""You can go back,""
he says
and I think,
no,
I will never be clear,
I can never go back.

But I know
we're talking
about two different things.

Just when I've taken up
the swing of Don's team
the PTBs offer me Washington
and the Medal for Meritorious Conduct
but I'd trade both of those
and hell, even all the stuff from my desk,
for LA.


<i>The Book of David</i>

If looks could kill...

it wouldn't really matter
because I'd be too dead
to see them.

Don told me it
was David 
who pulled the needle from my heart
started CPR
realized in that minute
(which might have been 
a day)
who I'd been all along

and yet

it's David who
only talks to me when he has to
looks at me
eyes narrowed
mouth tight
never has
a kind word
if he has any words at all

and I know why.

I let David think
he knew all my secrets:
the hell of Afghanistan
the heaven of Idaho's open spaces
and how stakeouts were my idea of purgatory
because
telling him those
truths
made my 
lies
easier for him to 
believe.

I don't really expect forgiveness
but it seems

that 

at the end of all of this I
have only traded one life
debt
for another.

Well, maybe not.
I mean

Dwayne never wanted me 
to forget.  Maybe
David never wants me
to remember.


<i>Lonesome Tonight</i>

I act like
two years of celibacy 
was no big deal.
Duty to the country
and all.

Secretly I think I
deserve
a medal just for <i>that</i>.


<i>On the Night Don Made Me Talk</i>

I find it funny
in that sick sort of ironic way
that Don is the one who's so
eager for sound
as we sit
coffee and silence
gotta love stakeouts.

I had a string of questions ready to go.

""Can I come back?""
""Who would partner me?""
""Is the team ever going to forgive me?""

Of course, I didn't ask the
most important question in my arsenal:

""How can I ever repay you?"" 

The most important question
doesn't have to have an answer
out loud.

So I jump out of the car,
and trust Don 
with my life.

All I'm sayin' is that Amazon, you better not screw this one up like you did my Supernatural S3 DVDs.  That was a very unhappy day in the Cedar household."

Colby, to me, is a ""still waters run deep"" character, and I've always been of the mind that we see a lot less of Colby's thoughts than what he actually has.  He's devoted to his work and stays on task at the office, but you can't tell me that three years of keeping all those secrets hasn't had any effect on him.

I'm working on the Charlie fic, too, but that one is extremely difficult.  Maybe it'd be easier to write if I could add and subtract."

"event","My RL commitments are somewhat lessened for the month of July, which is very exciting.  I'm still going to try to read at least two books a week, but the project I've spent two years on (I wrote a book!!!) is done and I have a few weeks before I have to start working on books 2 (finish proposal) and 3 (give outline to my editor).    In the meantime, I might write some fic, w00t!  I have a fic due for a Supernatural ficathon and my usual Harry Potter fic for August, but other than that, fandomthings are quiet.

I've been without internet for almost a week.  Dare I ask how things are in Numb3rsland?"

"event","I know I have been neglecting this fandom lately.  It's because I've had major, major good things happen in my professional life and those have taken priority.  But I'm here now.  How are all of you?

So, as some of you know I have been in the Harry Potter fandom for six years, and in that time I have written het, slash, and gen; fics rated G, fics rated R; fics that focus on Harry, Percy, James, Lucius...you get the picture.  In the Numb3rs fandom, I'm working on a Charlie-centric gen fic, a Don-centric het fic, some Colby gen, and am kicking around a few other ideas.  All of this boils down to one thing:  I like to be diverse in my fanfic.  I have no OTP.  I'll write poetry.  I'll write in any point of view and will try writing any character once.  The problem is that not all fandom archives are willing to take all ships, styles, and ratings of fics.  FictionAlley and Fanfiction.net won't take anything NC-17.  The CalSci Library only takes gen.  My favorite site for archiving my HP fic is probably <a href=""http://archive.skyehawke.com/"">Skyehawke.com</a>, a multi-fandom archive where you can put any fic with any ship and any rating.

And now, Skyehawke is hosting Numb3rs fic.

Right now, Valerie Vancollie and I are the only people contributing N3 fic.  There should be more there!  If you don't already have a Skyehawke account, comment here and I will do my best to get you an invite.  (The archive is invite-only.)  I love being able to host all my N3 and HP fic in one place.  Those who talk to me long enough will learn that I am almost fanatic about encouraging diversity in fanfic and making fandom a place where all interested parties can participate as they see fit, and I encourage all to use Skyehawke because they place zero restrictions (within reason) on what you can post.

Go forth and use Skyehawke!"

<strong>Pairing/Characters:</strong>  Don
<strong>Rating/Category:</strong> PG

<strong>Summary: </strong>Don turns to religion in a time of need.
<strong>Notes:</strong>  I'll probably expand this beyond the 300 words because I do think there's a longer story here but for now...

<lj-cut text=""...he embraced it as he saw fit."">

Don never had a bar mitzvah and there was no empty chair at his circumcision, but on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur he would walk by himself to the nearest Reform synagogue. Attending the services made him feel all at once connected to his fellow human beings and comfortable in his solitude.  He never owned a menorah and knew he loved shellfish too much to keep kosher, but it was his heritage nonetheless and he embraced it as he saw fit.

The day Margaret died, Don and Alan were at her bedside.  If he strained his ears Don could make out the sounds of clacking chalk and cursing from the garage.   It was three in the afternoon and the sun warmed the solarium.  The moment Margaret passed Don felt a shift in the air in the room, a fleeting chill.  Alan buried his face in his hands.  With his throat tight, Don said, ""I need to... I'll be back.""

Don let himself cry on the way to the synagogue, the wind streaking tears across his cheeks as he walked five miles over concrete and asphalt. The sanctuary was empty when he opened the doors and for a moment he wished he were Catholic just so he could sit in a confessional and hear someone else's voice, something to reassure him that he wasn't alone.  

He pulled a prayer book from the back of the seat in front of him and looked through the side written in English. Finding what he needed, Don took a deep breath and began to read aloud softly.

""Exalted and sanctified is God's great name...""

Tears dripped onto the prayer book as Don read the <em>Kaddish</em>.  When he finished he felt lighter, purified.  He exhaled deeply and remained in his seat, letting the quiet room cradle him.  </lj-cut>"

<b>Summary:</b> Megan is Larry's warming trend.
<b>Word Count:</b> 100


<lj-cut text=""Peaceful in Warmth"">Warmth is always relative to the cold experienced by an individual.  Larry had a student from Minnesota who wore shorts and t-shirts when the temperature was in the fifties.  That relativity of warmth, Larry noted, didn't just extend to outside temperatures.  He could be temperate of mind until Megan walked into the room and then, no matter where his thoughts were, he was always somewhere tropical, paradise found.   Megan was Larry's light and heat when the monastery and CalSci formed frost on his thoughts.  She understood what it was like to freeze in your own environment, and she melted him. </lj-cut>"

"event","<lj user=melissima> gave us the prompt ""gone"" at the <lj comm=n3_slashchat> and here's what I came up with (written in 15 minutes, 101 words):

Too many people in David's life had disappeared while he watched.  There was his neighbor, gunned down in a drive-by, and the girl who dumped him for his college roommate.  By his tour in Tel Aviv David had accepted the idea that the people in his life were simply never going to be there for very long.

Then he boarded the Chinese boat and there was Colby with a needle sticking out of his chest, dead for all intents and purposes.  Dropping to his knees, David started CPR. He'd be damned if Colby would appear on his list of beloved gone."

"event","From <lj user=elysium1996>:  <i>Comment if you want to do this and I'll give you a letter. Then you go and list ten things you like starting with that letter. </i>

<lj-cut text=""Ely gave me the letter G!"">

1.  Grapes.  Especially when they're frozen.

2.  Galleys.  Galleys are unfinished copies of a book that librarians and reviewers get before a book's official publication.  They're cool to have.

3.  Gratuitously bad television:  <i>Flavor of Love</i>, <i>Rock of Love</i>, <i>Judge Judy</i>...

4.  Guerlain Aqua Allegoria Herba Fresca perfume.  I hate floral perfumes.  I'm partial to herbals, citrus, and spices.  The Herba Fresca is green with a mint note and it is AWESOME.

5.  Geddy Lee.  Whether or not you like Rush is entirely dependent on how you feel about the sound of Geddy Lee's voice.  Personally, I like it.  Plus he's a great bass player.

6.  Grande pumpkin spice lattes.  When will Starbucks wake up and realize that some of us like pumpkin in February?

7.  Godiva chocolate.

8. Green, John & Hank, creators of Brotherhood 2.0.

9.  Gummi bears!  But only the red and orange ones.

10.  Gaiman, Neil.  No explanation needed, right?

There's still one more day to sign up for what is my most favoritest fic exchange ever, the Remix:  <lj comm=remixredux08>  

Here's how it works, basically:  Assuming you have at least 5 stories of at least 500 words in at least one fandom, you can <a href=""http://www.illuminatedtext.com/remix/signup/"">fill out their form</a> and participate.  You get assigned a writer, and you take one of their fics and retell it.   Come on.  You KNOW you've seen fics and said, ""I would love to see this fic told from Character B's point of view instead of Character A's.""  Or set a fic in New York instead of London.  Or whatever.  

If you want to see an example of what a remix looks like you can read my fic <a href=""http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=12349&chapter=1"">An Ancient Magic</a>, which is a remix of <a href=""http://goseaward.slashcity.org/Fics/hero.shtml"">Good Little Hero</a> by <lj user=goseaward>.  

Although my only eligible fandom right now is Harry Potter, I've let them know that I can also write in Supernatural, Numb3rs, Veronica Mars, and Star Trek: The Next Generation.  Numb3rs is not a popular enough fandom to even get its own listing on the sign-up form, so let's make it popular enough to get a spot next year!

I wonder, though, if no one signs up for N3 in this round of the ""official"" remix, if we could have a N3 fandom remix..."

"event","IIRC, in the world of Lord of the Rings hobbits give presents as well as receiving them on their birthdays.  I never thought of myself as much of a hobbit (although I am short and love to eat) but I <i>am</i> having a birthday.  As are Janice Dickinson, Paris Hilton, Denise Richards, Jerry O'Connell, Larry the Cable Guy, Rene Russo, and Michael Jordan.

So, in honor of my birthday, I'm going to give you a present.  The bad news is that I have no photo editing software so I can't make icons.  The good news is that I can write you a drabble or ficlet in Numb3rs, Harry Potter, or Supernatural, or I can write a short essay about any of those fandoms on the subject of your choice (quality of essay not guaranteed).  Or I'll put together a five-song playlist for the HP/SPN/N3 character of your choosing.  Or you can pick something else I can do that doesn't require photo editing software."

<lj-cut text=""Take Heart from Earth and Weather""><b><center>Take Heart from Earth and Weather</center></b>

Outside it smelled like wet potato peelings.  New Jersey sweated under thick clouds and suffocating humidity.  It was Saturday morning and Charlie was studying but the growing storm distracted him.  Everything around him felt dense and magnetic.

Lightning split the sky.  Seconds later, thunder shook the apartment building with the sound of huge sheets of metal.  Charlie ran outside.  Rains in California never had this electric sense of danger, the crack of air so hot it produced shock waves.  Charlie stood in the stinging water.  In seconds he was soaking, exhilarated, closer to beauty than math had ever taken him.</lj-cut>"

"event","I continue to be the world's worst fandomer because I have not checked my friends page in too long.  *offers chocolate to friends*

I'm still progressing through Numb3rs/CSI crossover I've mentioned.  It needs a more creative title, and it's got a beginning and an end but not much of a middle.  <lj-cut text=""However,  here's some of what I DO have in the middle"">  An excerpt:

Don dreams of nothing and when he wakes around nine his bones feel like they're made of lead.  Everything aches.  His upper back is stiff and the place where his neck meets his shoulders is knotted.  His hips and hamstrings are tight.  Groaning, he stumbles out of bed and into the bathroom.  The tile floor is so cold he nearly jumps and the light over the toilet blinds him. Before going back to sleep he thinks that a massage might be worth the expense.

He finally gets out of bed around two in the afternoon feeling disoriented and dehydrated.  This feeling of being hung over from too much sleep is always worse than the feeling of not getting enough sleep.  Some restaurant somewhere is probably serving brunch.  That, however, would require Don to get dressed and make himself look presentable.   He's really more thirsty than hungry, anyway.  Flipping on the TV, he opens one of the liter bottles of water he'd packed in his bag.  He channel-surfs while sipping the water.  Saturday afternoon TV is always terrible.  Infomercials. Football.  Chicago is playing Green Bay on ESPN and those games are sometimes fun to watch just for the crazy fans.  A marathon of America's Next Top Model.  That's about all Don's brain can handle right now.  He puts the remote down.

When half a liter of water is gone, Don stands and stretches.  Last night is still burning on his skin.  He turns side to side, cracking his spine, and rolls his head from shoulder to shoulder.  It helps, but he knows what will help more.  From the drawer above the one where he's stored his clothes, he pulls a box of Epsom salts.  If he'd learned anything from playing professional baseball, it was how to recover from a demanding practice.  The TV goes dark with a snap of Don's remote.  After an hour of letting the sun in through his shades, the light in the bathroom doesn't seem so bright.  The sound of hot water pounding into the porcelain tub relaxes Don.  When the tub is full to where he likes it he pours in the Epsom salts and sheds his boxers.

He lowers himself into the water and chokes on a scream.

</lj-cut>

I've also got a few handwritten pages of a Charlie & Colby genfic based on ""Breaking Point.""  Problem is, I wrote those pages when I was beyond tired and I'm not entirely sure I'll be able to read my own handwriting when I go back to my notes.  Guess I'll find out later this week.

Is it bad that I think about the writers' strike with a sense of relief?  Like, finally, I have time to catch up on some fic before there's new canon.  Being in a TV fandom after years in a book fandom takes some getting used to."

Margaret's Christian friends didn't know that you're really not supposed to send flowers to a Jewish funeral.  For days Don had to handle the endless bouquets of lilies and roses and who knew what else that inundated the family home, their layered perfume sickening.  

Don knows his mother's friends meant well and he doesn't fault them for any of his memories.  But the first time he went into a florist's shop after his mother's funeral he ran out five seconds later, retching and kneeling on the burning pavement next to his car.  Since then, he's always brought chocolate on dates.</lj-cut>

"event","<lj-cut text=""Thoughts inspired by Numb3rs 4x04"">""It's because you're not Indian.""

Oh, Charlie, come sit next to me.  Have some tea.  I know what you're going through.  Let's talk.

I'm the only Jewish person I've ever known whose parents didn't care if I was dating someone Jewish.  Both of my parents are Jewish, as are all four of my grandparents and all eight of my great-grandparents.  My mother's father was raised Orthodox and kept kosher until he entered the Army to fight in WWII.  My parents met through a young adults group at the Rogers Park JCC.  Like the Eppes, though, my parents were never very religious.  We lit the menorah at Chanukah but they haven't been in a synagogue since I was a kid.  I never had a bat mitzvah or anything like that.  Maybe my parents felt they couldn't dictate who we dated because they were hardly setting an example of leading a religious life for us.  But anyway...

I've never dated a Jewish man.  I didn't do that intentionally; it just worked out that the guys I was in relationships with before I met Mr. Cedar were all Protestant.  My sisters have dated guys who were African-Amercian, Asian, Jewish, Polish Catholic...why yes, we did grow up in a very diverse area.  Mr. Cedar is Roman Catholic.  But let's have a story.

Mr. Cedar and I were visiting his parents over Christmas (since I don't celebrate, we always do Thanksgiving with my family, which is my dad's favorite holiday, and we do Christmas with his family) and his sister Wendy, who is five years younger than he is, was dating a new guy.  She told me, Mr. Cedar, my FiL, MiL, and Mr. C's grandmother that she liked this guy a lot.

""What is he?"" asked my MiL.

<i>Um, a guy?</i> I thought.  A split second later I realized that she meant, <i>Is he Italian?</i>  Mr. Cedar's family originates in Sicily.  For generations his family's surnames have ended in vowels.  They take pride in cooking Italian food (and he, his mom, and his grandmother are all fantastic cooks) and following Italian traditions.  And ever since, I've had a knot in my stomach about my in-laws.  I already know that my MiL doesn't particularly care for me.  We're from two different worlds.  She has a high-school education and has rarely traveled out of Pennsylvania.  She doesn't comprehend how driven I am to succeed in my field, she doesn't read, and we generally don't have a lot to talk about.  I think she's a good person and Mr. Cedar turned out pretty okay, but we don't understand each other.  But ever since I was party to that conversation between Wendy and my MiL, I haven't been able to shake the idea that one of the biggest bones of contention my MiL has about me is that...

Yeah, you guessed it.  I'm not Italian.  And there is nothing I can do about what I'm not, except not make excuses for it.  Maybe the Ramanujans will be more accepting of Charlie than my in-laws are of me.  Mr. Cedar and I have been married for four years, together for seven, and they still think Chanukah is the Jewish Christmas.  And although Mr. Cedar swears up and down that his parents have always been cool with my not being Italian and being Jewish to boot, I have no doubt that MiL and FiL had some very late night conversations when Mr. Cedar and I weren't around.

Bad news for Charlie in the end re: Amita's plan:  My parents are not particularly enamored of my in-laws.  Well, that's not entirely true.  My FiL is a saint, a truly kind man with one of the biggest hearts of anyone I've ever known.   But I'm like my mom:  I believe in book smarts and drive and being fulfilled by a career, and Ma Cedar can't see eye to eye with my MiL (and not because my mom is 5'9"" and my MiL is 5'0"".)


P.S.  Cheryl and Nicholas, you're not fooling us for a second.  We KNOW Charlie's standing on a box during his makeout scenes with Amita.  You probably even borrowed the makeout box from the set of Supernatural.

P.P.S.  When Colby jumped in the ocean after the bag, I shouted, ""YES!"" so loudly I scared my cat.

P.P.P.S.  WHERE THE FUCK WAS THE DON AND CHARLIE INTERACTION?  Why do they think I  WATCH this show??</lj-cut>

"event","At the <lj comm=""n3_slashchat""> on Saturday <lj user=""sororcula""> had us writing ""5 Things"" prompts.  Having never written one I thought they were supposed to be like little ficlets so I went kind of overboard.  My assignment was...

<lj-cut text=""5 things Alan wishes for his sons""><b>5 things Alan wishes for his sons</b>

1. The truth is that Alan only wants one thing for his sons, and that is their happiness. As much as he might tell them how much he wants grandchildren, how much he wants the house to be a family heirloom, the most important thing to Alan has always, first and foremost, been Don and Charlie's happiness. And if they find that happiness in being gay, or childless, or selling the house, or running off to live in England, then so be it. He'll hide his feelings. His feelings are not as important as Don and Charlie.

2. Alan wishes for Charlie to have a day of <em>average</em>. If he had his way, Charlie would go out to lunch and have to use a calculator to figure out how much how to tip the waiter. He would have a day of Charlie working as a librarian, or a chef, or an insurance adjuster. Just once, Charlie would spend twenty-four hours without genius, without his astonishing capacity for numbers, without his <em>extraordinary</em>. One day in the real world. One day to be everything he was born not to be.

3. Sometimes Alan watches Don watching baseball and although Don tries to hide it, Alan can see the pain of missing something that was an intrinsic part of life. Alan watches Don's hands curl as though he was gripping a bat, can see his shoulders dip and his hips twist and the swing and the followthrough and the way Don's legs clench as though he means to run. And though he knows that Don has found his calling Alan sometimes wonders if there are days when Don wouldn't give anything to have made the major leagues.

4. Some day Don and Charlie are going to have to resolve those years they spent apart, and Alan wishes that day will come sooner rather than later. On that day, he's sure something in the house will be broken, a cabinet front shattered or a door smashed in or even a piece of furniture splintered but it will be worth it for Don and Charlie to have the poison of secrecy leached from their systems, all their resentment face up on the table between them, all their secrets flowing like an open wound. Like an open wound, the day will take some time and special attention to close, and there will be scars, but the closeness they'll gain will be worth it. Alan hopes.

5. Above all, Alan wishes for forgiveness. He wishes that Don will forgive Charlie for stealing the family limelight and that Charlie will forgive Don for pushing him out of it now that they're adults. Charlie has to forgive Don for their estrangement and Don must forgive Charlie for his years in New Jersey and England and even the first years back in California, the years of silence. He wishes that Charlie will forgive Don for the life he led in Arizona, the life with friends and his own office and an almost-fiancee, and Don must forgive Charlie for P vs. NP. Most of all, he wishes it will happen before they are all reunited with Margaret.</lj-cut>

"event","One of my clearest memories of first grade (besides getting my ears pierced) is of sitting at my desk with a sheet of addition problems in front of me, not being able to figure out for the life of me what 9+4 equaled.  Even today I still have to think for a moment before I say that the sum is 13.

Numbers have never come easy to me.  I don't balance my checkbook and I hate even figuring out what I owe at a restaurant.  It wasn't until very recently, however, that I've come up with an explanation for why math eludes me.  Why I didn't think of this before, I don't know.

To me, words are a synesthetic experience.  (And ""synesthetic"" IS a word, LiveJournal!)  When you say the word ""corn"" to me I can think of images and other words that spin off from it.  Yellow.  Silk.  Tall.  Fields.  I know what corn tastes like and what it looks like on the cob.  But when it comes to numbers, there's nothing for me to relate them too.  Nine of what plus four of what is thirteen of what?  To this day I cannot do math without picturing the numbers on some kind of weird line or a Chutes-and-Ladders style board...I think I watched too much Sesame Street when I was a kid.  Numbers exist in my head by themselves and I find that really disconcerting.  I don't have other numbers to connect them to the way I can connect words to images.

Um, so my current long Numb3rs fic is eating my head.  Does anyone know a fandomer with medical expertise?  I need help to write one of the really important scenes.

"event","Over my years of reading fanfic I've learned to smile and nod at slash writers who have clearly never seen a penis and <i>definitely</i> never studied basic anatomy.  We live and learn and laugh at ourselves, right?  Sure.

The Potter fandom certainly sees its fair share of blood, but it's got nothing on Numb3rs.  Don't try to tell me otherwise.  The Potter fandom, afaik, doesn't have an entire community dedicated to beating the crap out of character A and having character B angst over it.  Secretly I kind of like CWDA fics, but when I read them I often find myself smiling and nodding at the writers who have clearly never broken a bone or know what it means to go into shock and <I>definitely</i> never studied basic anatomy.

But we live and we learn and we read <a href=""http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/008884.html"">Making Light's Trauma and You series</a>.

<A href=""http://www.nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/"">Making Light</a> is a wonderful blog run by Patrick and Theresa Nielsen Hayden.  They're both experts on the art of writing science fiction and usually have thoughtful things to say on writing and politics.  Lately, they've done a series of posts every Numb3rs fic writer needs to read, called Trauma and You.  <b>Editing to correct:  The Trauma and You series is written by co-blogger Jim Macdonald, an EMT (among other things)</b>. I've linked to part 1 above, part 2 is <a href=""http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/009148.html#009148"">here</a> and part 3 is <A href=""http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/009238.html#009238"">here</a>.  It covers the reality of all the body trauma N3 writers like to put Don and Charlie through.  There's also  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Body-Trauma-Writers-Wounds-Injuries/dp/1933016418/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-2271912-9127140?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1189694741&sr=8-1"">Body Trauma:  A Writer's Guide to Wounds and Injuries</a>, which offers most of what you could ever want to know about how to hurt fictional characters in a multitude of ways.

Don always criticized Charlie's lack of connection with the real world but Charlie thought in secret that Don was the one in the ivory tower.  Cal Sci had campus security. The FBI building had ID badges for employees, armed guards, and agents with guns.

Agents with guns.  Right.

Any illusions Charlie had of Don's office being an ivory tower were shattered by the bullets to the whiteboard, the windows, and nearly, his skull.   He knew the shooting was an isolated incident, planned and executed, but every time he went to visit Don after the rampage Charlie felt a little nauseous.

"event","That would be weeds as in ""growing like one,"" not ""removing useless books from a library collection"" or ""marijuana.""

I'm completely burned out on work right now.  I feel, looking at the basic facts, like I've got no excuse for this.  I don't have a high-stress job.  I work 35 hours a week, 9-5 M-F with an hour lunch.  I have a beautiful corner office, cool coworkers, all the books I could want, and most importantly I'm in a career, not just a job.  I have accomplished much but I also have much to accomplish.  But then I look beyond the facts, which is difficult for me to do, and I see that I'm not taking enough of my vacation time, I'm competitive to the point where I'd alienate people if they knew exactly how competitive I was and as a result I think I've taken on much more than I can really accomplish this year.  I don't get an option not to complete all my projects, however.  Man, I HATE being one of those people that requires eight hours' sleep a night.  

I know I'm burning out not by my emotions, but by the amount of time I spend avoiding work.  At work it's not that bad; I do read a fair number of non-work related blogs but one really important aspect of my job is keeping up with pop culture so I don't feel horrifically guilty about it.  At home, however, I find I can't write any more book reviews.  I can't work on my overdue book anymore.  I can't produce the articles I want to write.  I can't read the books I need to read for the awards committees I serve on.  Instead, I've produced 25 pages of the long Charlie-centric fic <lj user=""emmademarais""> is helping me with, and some drabbles, and 10 pages of the mostly-Don-centric humor fic, and started to kick around <lj comm=""yuletide""> fandom ideas.  I'm re-watching S1&2 of N3 and spent an entire weekend watching SPN.  

I AM NOT SUPPOSED TO BURN OUT.  It's my job to set an example for other professionals.  If I am not 100% on my game all the time, if I'm not always articulate, energetic, knowledgeable, full of ideas, and if I haven't read twice the number of books everyone else has this year, I am a failure.   And I love my job!  I'm doing what I've always wanted to do and I'm in a great place in my life.  Outside of work, I have interesting hobbies, I exercise regularly, and I have super-adorable cats.

I don't like to write Don fic because it's too much like looking in a mirror, and oddly I've stopped to ask myself right about now, ""What would Don do?""  I know the answer:  He'd disappear to wherever and then resurface in a week.  Which I'd love to do, but I have the husband and cats.   And really, I don't want to go anywhere.  I want to sit on my couch and watch TV and not think about anything.  Okay, well, maybe I wouldn't mind doing the crossword in the Washington Post, and I'd keep up with my workouts.  It's perhaps a sign of the stress I'm under right now where I feel like I'm best understood by a fictional character but more and more I do understand Don's pressures.  Granted, being an FBI agent is probably a bit more stressful than being a librarian but we're both under the pressure to constantly impress ourselves, our superiors, and our team.  

I'm tired of impressing.  I need a vacation.  Or some Valium.

Thoughts I've scribbled to myself recently:

-People say ""You have trust issues"" like it's a bad thing.  I know where my trust issues come from, but I wonder where Don's come from.  I have a few ideas, certainly, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't sympathize with him entirely when he shows an abnormally strong sense of a self-reliance tied to distrust.  So now I have to wonder (and put into a fic, of course):  Has Don been betrayed in the past, before Colby?  If he hasn't experienced that really shattering level of seeing someone you trusted shit all over you, where do his trust issues come from?  There's argument that Charlie betrayed him by spending those three months in Numbersville when their mother was dying, but I think that's different.

After I produced a few fics in the HP fandom I became known as a Peter Pettigrew writer.  I find Peter fascinating, though I am seriously frustrated that we never found out exactly why he betrayed the Potters to Voldemort.   Everyone was always so focused on Peter betraying James that they never really stopped to think about the effect the betrayal had on Sirius and Remus.  Yes, the obvious answer is that James is dead but the less obvious answer, and the one I explored in my fic, is this:  <em>Secrecy binds closer than friendship.</em>  Sirius, whether he acknowledges it or not, wants revenge on Peter not just because James is dead, not just because Sirius was robbed of seeing his godson grow up, but because he trusted Peter with a deep secret.  Because he trusted Peter with the Animagus secret, because they experienced that secret together, Sirius believed he could trust Peter with his best friend's life.  

We have yet to see the fallout from Colby's betrayal, but even though David worked with Colby more, I'm willing to bet that it'll be Don who is most deeply affected by it.  Will we see it?  Probably not, at least not in Don's words.  ESTJs are famous for not expressing their feelings in words.  But like the most famous ESTJ in <em>Harry Potter</em>, Percy Weasley, Don speaks through his actions.  One would think that waiting years for the Potter books (I waited for every book from PoA onward), I would be fine with waiting a summer for new eps of Numb3rs, but I'm really not.  ARGH.

-Writing this Charlie fic, which I'm guessing is going to be about 115 pages when it's done, is an exercise in restraint.  I don't really have a problem writing teens...all those YA novels I read are good for <em>something</em>...but what's difficult is keeping the mindset that this fic is about who Charlie was, not necessarily who he became.   Outside of the technobabble, I have to be really careful with the dialogue and his thoughts.  FWIW, I am kind of proud of the fact that I'm doing a much better job of showing and not telling with this fic, which is a huge problem I've always had in the Potter fandom.  But wah, Don is SO MEAN in this fic, it's almost painful to write.

-I want to write a fic called ""Don, Quixotic"" but Don is the least quixotic character in Numb3rs.  Then again, it's called fanfic for a reason.

-I have to make a post about my thoughts on the state of my relationship with my family, but at another time.

"event","""Cedar, stop treating me like I'm eight!""

Those words were uttered by my youngest sister, Michele, at the age of twelve.  I was twenty-two.

How could I explain to her that no matter how hard I tried, it wasn't easy for me to remember that she was twelve?  I knew she was twelve mathematically, of course, but she didn't understand that people stay frozen in your memory as they are when you leave them.  I left home at eighteen to go to college and never came back for any appreciable period of time except for the eight months I lived at home between the time I finished my BM and moved 600 miles away to start my MLIS.  Michele and I see each other maybe once a year.  In the four years since I've been married, I think we've seen each other three times.  I love her very much, but she lives in Las Vegas and I'm in the NYC area.  It's just not possible to see her that often.

In my mind, Michele is still about sixteen.  I didn't do it intentionally, but I can't help it.  And there are no words with how much I can sympathize with Don when he wants to protect Charlie from the world, not just because he's an ESTJ, but because in his mind, Charlie is still thirteen and desperately in need of that shelter.

<lj-cut text=""Don Eppes and the Prisoner of Azkaban"">When Don and Charlie split up to go to college, Don was eighteen and Charlie was thirteen.  They didn't see each other for any appreciable amount of time for the next sixteen years or so.  In that time they both grew, but their lack of contact with each other meant that neither was forming new memories of the other.  Don had no idea Charlie lived with Susan Berry for two years and Charlie knew nothing of Don's engagement.  Michele knows I was engaged in college (and I should have taken her word:  she HATED him, as did my grandfather) but she knows very little, if anything, of other guys I've dated besides my husband.  Conversely, I don't know what she was like in high school besides popular and never home, or what her life is like at college.  In her mind, I am still twenty, the smart older sister who listens and who's always up for helping her with her homework.  To Charlie, Don is still eighteen, still one of the best athletes he's ever known.  Remember, Charlie's biggest goal in life aside from the Cognitive Emergence work is impressing Don.  Charlie takes this to heart regarding Don more than Michele does regarding me because Charlie was much more sheltered than Michele and has more of his own personality to form than Michele did.  Michele and I also have a better relationship with each other than Don and Charlie did, despite the fact that Michele and I have twice Don and Charlie's age gap.

Admittedly, I couldn't figure out why I had such a hard time adjusting to Michele's growing up until I read <i>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</i> and saw the way Sirius treated Harry.  Sirius treats Harry in many of the same ways I unintentionally treat Michele.  Sirius loves Harry fiercely and would do anything for him, anything in his power to protect Harry and give him safety, security, and family.   But in his love Sirius is also blind.  He doesn't recognize that Harry is fifteen and has been through so much.  He views Harry more as an incarnation of James than as Harry.  When he and Harry reunite he hasn't seen Harry for twelve years.  Harry was frozen in Sirius's memory for those twelve years as a baby and in thirty seconds Sirius had to come to terms with the fact that Harry was a teenager.  It's near impossible.  In the time Margaret was dying, Don had to grip his leaving his fiancee, taking a demotion at work, moving back home, and living with his spoiled, coddled, genius younger brother in a very short period of time.  If FSM forbid my mother or father got sick, I don't know how well I'd deal with living with either of my sisters in my parents' home, which is a Tudor nowhere near the size of the Craftsman (but it does have a basement because Midwesterners love their basements).   

Don was thrust into the idea that Charlie was 29 and working full time and able to drink legally and not a virgin.  Sirius and Don and I must all deal with someone close to them growing up and coming into their own while we weren't watching AND not telling us much of anything about it.  And it freakin' SUCKS.  Even if we don't get along with our families and moved for a reason, the shell shock of ""Wait...aren't you still in high school?"" is difficult to face.  The shock still hasn't worn off for Don, but it's morphed into Don's need to protect Charlie from the worst parts of his job, the parts where he sees how truly evil people can be.  Academia generally doesn't see that kind of evil outside of books and Don knows this.  It's in Don's nature to protect and like many ESTJs (myself included, ha!) he has a very clear idea of what he thinks his little brother should and should not see regarding that in the world which is not good and right and normal.  This frustrates Charlie, who wants more than anything for Don to see him as a capable adult.  This is not something that can be cleared up easily, either.  Don has YEARS of memory to recoup.  

As the oldest child I have to say I'm not entirely sure if this is a problem that youngest children encounter, but I'm willing to guess that if it's there, it's not as big a deal because the youngest child has always seen the oldest as more grown up and making their place in the world years before they're out of high school.  As far as Michele's concerned I'm guessing I've always been some degree of wise, intelligent (Michele and I agree: she's the pretty one and I'm the smart one), and talented, and as far as Charlie is concerned Don has always been the parts of Charlie he wishes he was:  athletic and respected with a strong grip on humanity.</lj-cut>

Where I'm going with all this I'm still not entirely sure, but it felt kind of good to write that out.

"event","Or:  We always want what we can't understand

Sometimes, said Albus Dumbledore, we have to make the decision between what is right and what is easy.  And when I write Numb3rs fic, I have both of those choices.  Don is easy to write, but if I want to develop any sort of writing skills and not just write the same fic over and over, I have to do what is ""right"" and explore characters whose motivations and values I don't look at every day in the mirror.  

This said, my reasons for wanting to do what is ""right,"" and write Charlie. <lj-cut text=""Cut for length"">

1.  I can't resist a challenge.  It's not that I necessarily seek out that which doesn't come easy to me.  If I wanted to that, I'd have tried majoring in chemistry in college, a subject I always found interesting but couldn't do much with because I wasn't any good at math.  But I like to seek things that will be difficult but not impossible to get to.  Don is an easy character for me to get to and Charlie is not.

2.  Introverts, which Charlie is (and he is most <i>definitely</i> an INTP), interest me.  When I take those MBTI tests, I always answer the statement ""I would rather live alone"" in the affirmative, but that's because I think best when I'm at home and can mold my environment around my likes and dislikes.  Other people living in my environment disrupts the way I like my life.  (Yes, I have been asked if I'm obsessive-compulsive, and I'm not.  I just like things a certain way and I like to keep a certain schedule.)  But I could not live without regularly being around other people.  I love parties and publisher dinners at conventions and statewide meetings.  I find other people generally interesting and like to hear about the different ways people live.  (I just don't want to experience them up close.)  Introverts are less willing to give up this information so it's all the more rewarding when they do tell you about their lives.    I could never be a person who is more satisfied with solitude than the rush of people around.  My sister Allyn is an introvert and I realize more and more that I don't know much of anything about her, and sometimes that drives me crazy.  I want to kind of crack Charlie open and see what's inside.  Like one of those Cadbury eggs.  Or a pinata.

3.  I think Charlie's carrying a lot of baggage that I know is there but won't see unless I set my mind to it.  Don's baggage is obvious to me.  He carries it outwardly.  Charlie, the introvert, carries his thoughts inwardly and while he's not cold, he's less enthusiastic than Don about relating to other people.  I'm not saying that Don is the party sort, but it's his ESTJ tendency to take over as a leader, indeed, to get paid for his inherent ESTJ leadership skills, that helps him share some of his burden with others.  Nor am I saying that Charlie carries as much baggage as Don does.  He doesn't.  Honestly, I think he only carries half the guilt and anger Don does over their mother's death.  Charlie's way of working through the things that distress him at the deepest level is to retreat into Numbersville and, well, not think about the things that distress him.  When Don is shot in season 1 during the Charm School Boys chase, Charlie goes to Numbersville and Don confronts him.  Don believes that Charlie is dissociating himself not just from the horror that was the situation in general, but from the idea that bad things could happen in his (Charlie's) world.  Charlie's been sheltered and coddled and often this makes it difficult for him to deal.  I think Charlie's retreat into Numbersville, though, was something much more interesting than just ""Bad things aren't supposed to happen to me.""  It's ""I wasn't supposed to send Don in to get shot,"" subset ""My math was not supposed to send Don in to get shot.""  Numbers don't fail Charlie because his numbers are never wrong.  Even in this case, they weren't wrong.  But it's not what they DID account for, it's what they DIDN'T account for, and it's why he'll be working on that Cognitive Emergence thing until he DIES.  Numbers can't equal the wide range of human emotions, Commander Data.  (Once again, Don did the total oldest-child thing with both Alan and Charlie when he was reticent in talking about the wound on his arm and how it got there because he has self-sufficiency engraved on his brain.)

4.  It's easier for me to hide behind Charlie than it is to hide behind Don.  It's not that I refuse to ever write Don, but it will take a long time for me to face.  My not writing Don in the Numb3rs fandom is like my not writing Remus for so long in the Potter fandom, and even when I write Remus I feel like I have to keep him at arm's length.  Writing Remus is still very hard for me, not technically but emotionally, but that's for another fandom.
</lj-cut>

I stayed up late unintentionally the other night and cranked out 1300 words of a Don-centric fic.  I find that when writing Don it's so much easier to write actions than words.  Yes, yes, they supposedly speak louder and all that, but I wonder if I'm not connecting the story emotionally to the reader.  I need a beta.

I always thought as a teen that ""write what you know"" was a completely ridiculous notion.&nbsp; What did I know at sixteen?&nbsp; And what I did know I couldn't communicate as well as I can communicate it now.&nbsp; Today, a few years out of high school, I can write what I know.&nbsp; I have the knowledge, the experience, and the vocabulary to do so.<br /><br />But I don't want to.<br /><br />I could easily sit down right now and write a hundred pages of Don fic.&nbsp; I know Don well, because we are very much alike.&nbsp; Let me count some of the ways. <div text=""Cut for length"" class=""ljcut""><br /><br /><ul><li>We are both oldest children who grew up in the shadow of a younger, more gifted sibling.&nbsp; We weren't necessarily ignored by our parents, but our gifts were somewhat forgotten in someone else's wake.&nbsp; This is a really hard blow for an oldest child to take, because oldest children not only perpetually deal with getting over the idea that they are not their parents' center of attention, but they're learning that they're NOT good at everything, and that their younger siblings, the ones who are supposed to look up to them and want to be them, have gifts of their own.&nbsp; It was obvious to Don, as it was obvious to me, that a lot more time and money was being spent on his younger brother.&nbsp; I don't know how Don processed this as related to his emotions, but I know when I was growing up, I felt like time=love.&nbsp; My parents spent more time with my sisters (especially Allyn, who was a competitive figure skater), and therefore I believe they loved them more.&nbsp; My parents had a lot less patience with me than they did with Allyn or Michele, and I think this is a two-pronged issue that Don dealt with as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither Don nor I were dumb,&nbsp; and both of us were outgoing and not big troublemakers, and I believe that this led to our parents thinking that we had the skills to easily survive on our own.&nbsp; That's the first prong:&nbsp; If it<i> looked</i> like we could get along without our parents' support, we must have been able to.&nbsp; Growing up, I hid much of who I was from my parents.&nbsp; I still do.&nbsp; Allyn and Michele are much more open with them; Michele's relationship was often antagonistic, but it was always open.&nbsp; Even today, she talks to our parents with about four times the frequency that I do.&nbsp; While I'm not envious of Allyn or Michele's relationships with my parents, I do see it as being very different from mine.&nbsp;&nbsp; The second prong is tied to this.&nbsp; Don and I get along with our parents, but we are more likely to view them as advisers rather than the people who love and guide us.&nbsp; <br /></li><li>Our parents gave our younger siblings more than they gave us.&nbsp; This goes back to the self-sufficiency mentioned earlier.&nbsp; Don and I both watch as our younger siblings are given the things we worked for.&nbsp; Working for what we wanted made us more independent, but it also makes us jealous.&nbsp; Don watched his mother go off to Princeton with Charlie, and even though Don was in college at the time, he had to have felt some loss at the physical if not emotional split of his family.&nbsp; He may have even blamed Charlie for his feelings.&nbsp; Charlie would have been an easy target.&nbsp; If it weren't for his genius, his parents would still be living in the same house and he'd be in eighth grade where he belonged.&nbsp; I don't blame Allyn or Michele for the way my parents treated them, but it has been a source of perpetual hurt to watch them get handed many of the things I worked for (especially Michele).&nbsp; One could argue that Don's view of how much his parents gave Charlie shrunk when they split up to go to separate coasts for college, but Don never forgot it.&nbsp; Secretly...well, not so secretly...I think he's reminded of it every time he enters the family home.&nbsp; He may be proud of Charlie's accomplishments, but when he walks into that house he has to know on one level or another that his parents' gifts of time and money to Charlie are what enabled him to buy that house.&nbsp; Charlie never had to work for things the way Don did.&nbsp; Numbers came easily to him.&nbsp; Don will never, NEVER move out of his apartment and into the house because he cannot let go of the resentment, even if he can hide it.&nbsp; I have no idea what FBI team leaders make, even in LA, but I'm betting it's not enough to save enough so he could buy an incredibly well-preserved Craftsman house in Pasadena with cash (about 1.3 million US dollars).&nbsp; Don has more independence and is more self-sufficient than Charlie, but those are hard things for him to remember when he walks through that house.<br /></li><li>Don and I are both Type A personalities with Type B younger siblings.&nbsp; This is a constant source of annoyance.&nbsp; I could scream at Allyn for hours when we were younger and she'd never so much as raise her voice.&nbsp; My mom thought this was hilarious.&nbsp; I didn't.&nbsp; I still don't.&nbsp; People who don't get excited over things, who don't keep things just so and don't follow rules and don't do what they're supposed to do (that is, work hard and do the right thing) to get ahead infuriate me.&nbsp; I think this is somewhat related to Don and I both being ESTJs as well.&nbsp; If we want something done correctly, we know we have to do it ourselves.&nbsp; We are more likely to express our anger physically.&nbsp; Don's been known to yell at Charlie when Charlie's pissed him off, and when Don yells, he expresses not only the things he really means, but the things he think should be.&nbsp; It's an ESTJ thing:&nbsp; We're very big on doing the right thing simply because it's the right thing, not because of what we'll get out of it.&nbsp; <br /></li><li>Oldest children learn very quickly that the world does not revolve around them, and not just because of the birth of the younger sibling.&nbsp; Don's world stopped being about Don the minute Charlie multiplied those four-digit numbers.&nbsp; What I experienced, and I think Don did as well, was a message that not only did the world not revolve around us, but that our interests and talents were not as interesting or as important as the interests and talents of our younger siblings.&nbsp; We weren't completely ignored, don't get me wrong.&nbsp; Alan, Margaret, and Charlie went to quite a number of Don's baseball games and my parents, Allyn, and Michele came to some of my concerts and recitals (but never a swim meet, even though I competed for seven years).&nbsp; It's just that the percentage of other people's time and efforts expended on our behalf was noticeably smaller than the time and effort expended for our siblings.&nbsp; The thing is, we grow up knowing this, even expecting it and modifying our lives to become more self-sufficient and less in need of validation from our families, but we still remember the important times when they weren't there for us.&nbsp; Not that I still remember that my sorority sisters, not my parents, threw the reception for my senior recital at the end of college because my parents didn't want to drive the three hours on a weeknight to where I went to school.&nbsp; THAT made me feel like a jackass.</li><li>The protector role is ingrained in both Don and myself.&nbsp; Our siblings don't really need us now, but we felt like they did when they were younger.&nbsp; Don did sometimes have to physically protect Charlie, which I never had to do for Allyn or Michele except in one case where some little boy was hitting Michele...he came from this family of delinquents and thought he could get away with anything because his dad was a cop...but with Allyn and Michele I felt like I had to protect their academic and social careers.&nbsp; Allyn, the middle child, was more a loner and developed her own thing, but Michele took my hints and ran with them.&nbsp; She was born popular, dramatic, and outgoing and took immediately to anything that had to do with being on a stage, which is pretty typical of ESFPs.&nbsp; Don would do anything to protect Charlie from harm, and I have to say I feel the same way about my sisters.&nbsp; I can't do much for them physically since they live three time zones away, but I always worry that they have enough money and good relationships with their boyfriends and that their pets are healthy.&nbsp; Even though our siblings are independent adults, Don and I both feel the constant need to make sure they're going the ""right' way in life.&nbsp; So be forewarned:&nbsp; If you're the younger sibling of an ESTJ, you're doomed to a lifetime of their worrying and trying to steer you the ""right"" way.&nbsp; They mean well.&nbsp; Love them for it even when they annoy you.&nbsp; In the workplace, Don protects his team (again, typical of the ESTJ to ensure the safety and security of your team) and is a bit of a control freak, as am I.&nbsp;&nbsp; But we can't really help it.&nbsp; ESTJs tend to lean towards wanting control because we are some of the strongest leaders out of the 16 MBTI types, and those facts we like so much and the passion with which we can do our jobs lead us to take an even, if sometimes harsh, hand to everyone in the workplace.&nbsp; We have high expectations for ourselves as well as others, and it simply doesn't occur to us that others in our chosen fields could view and perform their jobs with anything less than complete enthusiasm.&nbsp; <br /></li><li><b>Editing to add:&nbsp; </b>I'd almost forgotten this one until I was looking through the ""Don Eppes"" Wikipedia entry.&nbsp; Don expresses sympathy for Taylor Ashby by saying that he knows what it's like to want to have your life to mean something.&nbsp; This is something I struggle with on pretty much a daily basis.&nbsp; Maybe it's just a symptom of today's ""bigger, better, faster, more"" lifestyle, but I feel like I've accomplished nothing in my life, especially now that I'm 30.&nbsp; The younger you are, the more value your life is perceived to have, which I think is complete and utter bullshit.&nbsp; Despite that opinion, I am worried that my life up to this point has meant nothing, that I have accomplished nothing beyond the mediocre except do a really spectacular job of ruining my credit and ensuring that I could never work in national security because I could never get clearance.&nbsp; I'm not sure Don feels this way.&nbsp; I really do think he thinks his life has meaning.&nbsp; He saves innocent people from criminals, which I think is very important and meaningful.&nbsp; But when he compares himself to Charlie I think it'd be easy for him to feel like I do, that he's done nothing with his life.&nbsp; </li></ul></div><br /><br />For me, writing Don fic is a lot like looking in a mirror.&nbsp; It's easy and works for flashfic, but for longer pieces I think it would be painful, rather than fun or analytical, to write.&nbsp; Don and I both carry a lot of resentment even though we love fiercely.&nbsp; And no, we can't just ""get over it.""<br /><br />Part II-B: Why I'd rather write Charlie than Don, even though I don't understand Charlie as well.<br />Part III:&nbsp; How Don views Charlie (30 going on 13).&nbsp;"

"event","Part I:  Don and Charlie as related to my dad and uncle.

My dad has one brother, my Uncle Paul, who is six years older than my dad.  I am, if I do go so far as to say this myself, Uncle Paul's favorite of my dad's three daughters.  We are a lot alike: culinary omnivores (as opposed to my middle sister, Allyn, who to this day is a horrifically picky eater), interested in academics, museums, our family history and relatives, jewelry, and we have the same sense of humor.  Uncle Paul has spoiled me rotten since the day I was born, but he has never married nor had children of his own.  Uncle Paul also speaks five languages fluently and to this day is still a little upset at my dad never let him take me and Allyn and Michele for Spanish and French lessons when we were children.  Uncle Paul is an <a href=""http://www.mypersonality.info/personality-types/esfj/"">ESFJ</a>.

When Grandma Dee asked Uncle Paul when he was six if he'd like a baby brother, Uncle Paul gave the most honest response:  ""No!  I told you I wanted a cocker spaniel!""  Grandma Dee went to the pediatrician with this disturbing statement and the pediatrician said, ""You'd better get that kid a dog.""  Uncle Paul did get the dog, but at the age of six, right about the same age Don was at Charlie's birth, he got a little brother whom everybody paid a lot of attention to.

My dad's not a math genius, although he is very good at his field of engineering.  He was born, however, three months prematurely.  With the medicine available in 2007, he'd be okay but in 1940 things looked a little dicey.  Dad told me when I was an adult that the only reason he survived the first three months of his life was because the kid next to him got put in the defective incubator at Michael Reese Hospital.  Dad's incubator was perfectly constructed, but the one next to it was not.  So Uncle Paul had two major firstborn traumas to deal with:  First, he was no longer the center of his parents' attention.  This is something all oldest children go through, and something I'll talk about more when I do the post on my sisters and birth order as related to family dynamics.  Second, my dad had something about him that required special attention.   As Charlie had his ability for numbers, my dad had his medical needs.  There's a gap in the time that takes; Charlie expressed himself via numbers at three and my dad was born needing that special attention.  Uncle Paul had no time to get used to Dad.  So there he was, six years old, and all of a sudden very lonely because the adults in his life were paying attention to the baby.  At least he had the cocker spaniel.

Dad and Uncle Paul never got along as kids.  Why should they have?  What does any kid want with another kid who's six years younger? Uncle Paul is outgoing and friendly and he had his friends and his interests and Dad didn't fit into that.  Add to that the fact that my dad has ADHD (although this is long before the diagnosis was popular, or even really recognized, all the symptoms were there) and Grandma Dee was always being called to school to talk to Dad's teachers about his misbehavior.  Dad was never mean, never a bully, nor was he dumb, but he couldn't sit still and behave the way kids are supposed to behave in a classroom.   Uncle Paul is more relaxed and in tune with what is considered good behavior.  So not only did he have a baby brother, he had a hyperactive, annoying baby brother and everybody paid more attention to the squeaky wheel of Dad than they did to intelligent but more quiet Uncle Paul.  Unlike Don, Uncle Paul didn't have to work on protecting Dad so much because a) Dad could hold his own and b) they were never in the same school at the same time.

Uncle Paul went off to college at eighteen at the state university three hours from home.  He loved college and didn't come home very much over the next four years.  After college, he got a job and moved out to San Francisco.  San Francisco was great, but eventually he came back to Chicago because of SF's high cost of living.  When he came back, now in his late twenties, maybe early thirties, he discovered something:

He and my dad got along.

Dad calmed down a lot over the years and did very well in high school, particularly in science, and was even accepted at MIT.  He went to a local university, however, because he couldn't afford MIT.  (How well do we all know that story?)  He worked to put himself through school and lived at home, and when he finished his engineering degree he got a job and moved into his own apartment.  Now, Dad and Uncle Paul, 24 and 30 years old, respectively, were both adults.  They found that as adults they could talk together, and they did some traveling together as well, to Mexico and Spain.   Uncle Paul was the best man at my parents' wedding and showed up with a three-foot teddy bear the day I was born.  My dad and Uncle Paul disagree on some things but they're ultimately good friends.   

What this is all getting at is that I can see a lot of my dad and Uncle Paul's relationship in Don and Charlie.   Both sets of brothers have a wide enough age gap so that not only is the role of the parents' center of attention fully ingrained in the oldest child, who's developed a distinct personality, but he's old enough to be aware of what he's losing when the new baby comes along.   Don more than my uncle Paul was forced into the role of protector, but I think the protector thing is something that comes in one degree or another to many oldest children.  I know I personally felt (and still feel) very strongly about my role as protector to my two younger sisters, but that's for another post.  Both older brothers had younger brothers who needed some form of special attention and while their parents figured out what to do about those special needs they got shunted to the side unintentionally.  It's not that their needs were less important, but they had the skills to function independently and they weren't as big a concern to their parents.  It made childhood hard but as adults my dad and uncle, like Don and Charlie, have found some common ground.  They had to find it, though, on their own terms.  Don and Charlie's reunion was precipitated by Margaret's illness, and Dad and Uncle Paul's by Uncle Paul's move from San Francisco back to the family hometown of Chicago.  Neither was a completely desirable situation in which to strengthen bonds between brothers, especially because Charlie was such a wreck, but the effect in the end was still the same.

I am in no way saying that my family defines everything Don and Charlie feel.  I'm just using my personal anecdotes to relate better to the characters.

Next post:  Being the oldest, self-sufficiency, the protector role, birth order.  Or, why I could easily write Don but find Charlie more interesting."

"event","I love MBTI tests.  I find them fascinating and mostly accurate (nothing's perfect), and they're nifty little tools to have when ficcing.  And the nice thing about Numb3rs as opposed to Harry Potter is the small size of the cast; they're easier to manipulate.

I thought for about a day that Charlie was an <a href=""http://www.mypersonality.info/personality-types/istj/"">ISTJ</a>, because he's clearly an introvert and most comfortable with facts.  But upon further reading of MBTI type descriptions, I think he's much more of an <a href=""http://www.mypersonality.info/personality-types/intp/"">INTP</a>, an Engineer.  No description is 100% accurate, but this one comes the closest.  What I forgot when I wanted to convince myself that Charlie was an ISTJ, an Examiner, is that he's not always the most logical person.  Also, loyalty and a strong sense of duty are important to an ISTJ and while those things certainly are important to Charlie, they aren't at the top.  Colby is more an ISTJ.  (And yes, I do believe that there's more to Colby's being a double agent than meets the Janus List.)  INTPs are quiet until you piss them off, and then watch out.  My dad is an INTP who, interestingly enough, is a professional engineer (and certified as such by the state) and is stubborn as hell when you disagree with him.   What Charlie has that my dad doesn't, however, is a degree of naivete, probably gained by the enormous gap between his intellectual and social developments.

Don is definitely an SJ, rather than an NT.  SJs are classified as ""Protectors,"" or ""Guardians,"" both of their own and of others' security.  SJs like to deal in facts; we make decisions based on what we can easily see and what we can easily see developing from facts.  The E vs. I is a little more difficult to pin down; he could be an ambivert, he dates but he's also had long periods of solitude in his life.  But the E part of being an <a href=""http://www.mypersonality.info/personality-types/estj/"">ESTJ</a> translates to being a leader in the workplace,  a self-starter, and someone who likes rules and procedures and believes the rules and procedures are there for a reason.  ESTJs like to manage people.  Don's not a people-pleaser enough to fit the ESFJ profile; Alan is more the F type.   

I have to wonder, though, if I think Don is an ESTJ because I'm an ESTJ and it's easy to pick out the qualities you see in yourself in a fictional character.  It makes them easier to identify with.  You want to look at the things that fit the profile and ignore the things that don't and say, ""Well, everyone's different and this is just a personality description, not rules.""  But sometimes you just look at people, and you look at the descriptions, and the label fits immediately and well.  My sister the actress is a textbook <a href=""http://www.mypersonality.info/personality-types/esfp/"">ESFP</a>; I'm perpetually amazed by her understanding of people and how many friends she has.  Charlie fits his label better than Don fits his, at least, the label I think Charlie has is better suited to him than Don's.

The brothers-and-sisters post will have to be next.

"event","We find out early in Season 1 that Charlie's security clearance exceeds Don's, but Don doesn't know about it.  However, in order to achieve Top Secret clearance, which is what I assume Charlie has because he's cleared at a higher level than Don, Charlie would have to pass a background check that involves interviewing of friends and family members.  A friend of mine from high school who now works for the CIA had her background checked to the extent that our band director was interviewed.  And we'd been out of high school for a good seven years at that point.  

With what it takes to achieve Top Secret clearance, I cannot believe that the NSA would never have interviewed Don.  A brother in the FBI would be one of the first people the NSA would go to, I would think, when doing Charlie's background check.  

So either the writers are missing something or I am."

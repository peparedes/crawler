So, you know, here I am. Here I've been. Self imposed solitary confinement is nice, but sometimes it wears a little thin. I think I need to get out and see a few old friends. First on the list is Carlson. It was nice to hear from someone after so long. I spent 90% of my time with Lori, which is fantastic, but it would be cool to see some old familiar faces again.




What the fuck would an LJ post be if I didn't gush over all the shitty music I've been hooked on?

Sunn O))). Neurosis. Isis. Ocean. Mastodon. Pelican. Red Sparrows. Gregor Samsa. Godspeed You Black Emperor. Swans. 

And when I'm feeling all icky happy...Rose Melberg. Fuck what you heard on Pitchfork. Her new record is gorgeous.

"event","It has been quite some time since I wrote here. I never really think of it anymore. That's probably due to the fact that I'm quite sure nobody cares to read about what's going on in my life anymore. Hell, I don't even care to write about it, to be honest.

Alright, so it's true. I've become a hermit. We all know this. It has been a steady decline for a couple of years now. Is decline the right word? Is cutting yourself off from a load of shitty people who were more concerned with hair and clothes and they were about people really such a bad thing? I'm inclined to say, no, not at all. However, I have lost touch with some upstanding, genuine people, and that part upsets me. 

Let me also say, the people who I do have around are great. The above complaints should in no way make them feel any less important.

So about a week ago (maybe longer. The days are running together.) I spoke to Jesha. It was nice to catch up and hear about what she has been doing, from her own mouth. I read her lj, but that couldn't feel any more impersonal. I just now spotted a new picture of her. It's weird how much people change over the years. It has been a long time since she and I met, and we've been to hell and back, but I'm still very glad to know her, and it's comforting on many levels to be on good terms with her still.

I just realized I need to buy Dinosaur Jr tickets soon. If that show sells out and I don't have a ticket, I'm pretty sure I'll flip the fuck out.

You mention an album that you've been listening to and enjoying, regardless of it being an overhyped monster, and this person gives you some bullshit about how much that band sucks...but here's where it gets interesting. A month later that same person is quoted as saying ""I love this record"". Priceless. I know we've all done it from time to time, but man is it fucking annoying.

You know, last year was a good year for music. There were quite a few fine records released, a few of which still see near constant play in my stereo. This year is shaping up to be even better. So far the cream of the crop has to be the new Six Organs of Admittance. I haven't stopped listening to is since I got it. Then of course you've got the new Decemberists. Need I say more there? You either love them or hate them, and I'm not afraid to admit to the former. Oh, and the Yo La Tengo 3CD set. Not exactly new music, but a new release just the same.

The Wedding Present are playing out here soon. Tickets need purchasing.

I just hope they get in soon, because I'm sick of being in with nothing to do. So far my evening has consisted of the following;

- Playing my guitar a bit.
- Playing my Xbox a bit.
- Brainstorming on where to apply for jobs this week. Number 1 on the list is the new Newbury Comics opening at a mall out around Worcester.
- Watching tv for about 5 minutes before remembering that I hate tv unless it's Deadwood, The Shield, or The Venture Bros.
- Listening to the new Wedding Present cd on repeat. I think It's going on spin number 10 soon.
- Cleaning.

So as you can see, it's been quite the party over here. I think I need to make new friends. I think I'll take Scott up on his hangout invite this weekend. It'll be good for me.

I really want the new Bloc Party record. Does that make me a bad person? If I end up picking that up before the new Six Organs of Admittance, somebody shoot me. Please.

Oh, and I just found out that my ""friends"" have been home for 45 minutes and didn't bother to contact me. Nice. Whatever, they went to see Vanessa Carlton. I shouldn't be hanging out with people like that anyway."

It's just a crying shame that more of us don't fit into that small demographic of young people who understand that things aren't going to change themselves. We have a strong enough collective voice, that if even half of us had gone out and voted, the election would have been ours. However, only 17% of people between the ages of 18 - 29 thought that the world we live in matters enough to get off the couch and down to the polls. That's the exact same number as last election. The Republicans were quite happy when they announced on the radio that our generation had not come out in droves as was expected. Why is it that young people still cling to the nihilistic punk ethos of the late 70s? Is it really cool to say ""fuck you"" to society? Hell, at least in the 80s, the punks cared enough to have some sort of movement. Tell your friends, if you really want to rebel, then rebel agains those who are keeping you from getting a job, keeping you from getting health care, keeping your homosexual friends from having the rights they deserve, and trying to keep a woman from truly owning their bodies. With rebellion must come action."

Lori and I didn't go see Magnolia Electric tonight though. She has a long 12 hour day of school tomorrow and wouldn't be able to function on only 4 hours sleep. Can't say I blame her. We also won't be able to make it out to see them in RI tomorrow night because she won't be home from school in time. What a kick in the balls that is. Ahh well, there's always next time."

What am I doing with my life? 23 and what do I have to show for it? Don't get me wrong, I'm not one to thing that being a young, creative, opinionated, educated person is a failure. However, as far as conventional standards go, I'm not getting anything done. I need to get out there, make money, pay more than just sales taxes, meet people, make connections, and get some fucking direction. So far this year wasn't the success story I had hoped for. The good news is that I've grown a lot as a person though, and that should certainly count for something. My personality has developed a lot, and that will help me get it together in the very near future.

I guess just not being in school or anything is getting to me.

"event","Joanna Newsom sounds far too much like a mix of Devendra Banhart and Lisa Simpson. I love her music, don't get me wrong, but come on. I feel like I'm listening to The Simpsons Sing Free Folk. 

Last night Lori and I went and saw the new Exorcist movie. I liked it a lot. It made Lori uncomfortable, and she ended up watching only about half of it. It was scarey, but it certainly was upsetting and creepy. Good character development also.

So tell me, why the hell is it that all of the Miles Davis reissues on Columbia are $8.99, except for the two that I REALLY want? Granted, Kind of Blue, On The Corner, Sketches of Spain, Porgy & Bess, etc. are fantastic, but I need a bit of Bitches Brew and Live-Evil. Sure, they're double cds. So why can't they be $19 instead of $25? Fuckers.

So, I need a fucking job. I wanted to work at Journeys with Lori, but the manager girl hasn't gotten back to me. It may be easier to find something now that people are going back to school, but shit, I need work NOW. Anyone know of anything?"

"event","I probably shouldn't be on the computer right now, due to the constant thunderstorms. If it starts to get really bad, I'll shut it off. I'm actually glad it's raining so hard out. You could feel that it was coming for weeks.

So, what's new, right? Well, yesterday I spent the day shopping with Lori. Shopping with Lori consists of me following Lori around the Mall, going into every female clothing store she sets her eyes on. Sure, I complain a lot during these trips, but that's what gets me through them. The highlight was me trying to swoosh some shawl into Loris face while we were in Filenes, but accidentally knocking the hanger into her glasses. A woman who worked there was about 10 feet away when this happened, and looked like she was about to jump into action and either call the cops or take me down herself.

I picked up a copy of Miles Davis - On The Corner. Certainly one of my favorites of his records. I was looking for a cheap copy of Bitches Brew, which doesn't exist. The reissue is a solid $25. They did have Kind Of Blue, and Sketches Of Spain, both of which are essential. Good to know Newbury Comics sells their Davis and Coltrane for low prices. Now they just need to throw some Sun Ra into the $8.99 section.

I am becoming obsessed with Chess at this point. If I'm not playing it online, I'm wanting to play it. Tomorrow I'm going to teach Lori how to play. After this, we need to start up a Poker night. Carlson, you down broseph?

So, Jesha is in NH right now. Apparently she was in Boston yesterday. It feels weird knowing that she's only 2 hours from where I am. Oh well.

Alright, the lightning is kicking in. Time to go read a book."

Well, wouldn't you know it, they came out for a 2nd encore. There was just something special about everyone in the crowd being silent, or quietly singing along as the band played without the use of electricity. It was certainly a night to remember."

I'm adding Jesha now. NOW!"

"event","So, I've never been a big fan of The New Pornographers, but Neko Case has some amazing solo stuff. 

The Pixies are playing Lollapalooza in NY. Fuck the MA dates, we need to get tickets for NY. Their only east coast show? You betcha.

I think I ate some bad chicken. I feel a bit ill at the moment. Or maybe it was the year old valentines day candy I got from the dollar store. Either way, I want to barf out my ass presently."

"event","Its nice and dreary outside. I don't like that in the winter, but I love it in the spring/summer. Nothing better. Lightning last night while I was walking to Chads. Wonderful.

I'm having a hard time finding all of The Handsome Familys records in stores, and even having a rough time of finding them online. I'd really like to get everything they've put out.

My nephew is insane.

I won an intense game of Monopoly last night. At one point it looked like I was going to be out. I made a comeback and took the win. How awesome am I? I'd like to start getting bi-weekly Monopoly games going. Anyone want in on this?

Nothing happening today, sadly. I would like to go out and do something, but it doesn't look like that's going to happen. So it'll probably just be me and my gameboy.

Bananas make my mouth feel weird."

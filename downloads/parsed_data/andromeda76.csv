"event","This has certainly been one of the more pleasent holidays I've had.  Honestly, I was never a large fan of the expensive and elaborate balls that we always had that required me to wear some sort of stuffy gown and pretend as though I wanted to carry conversation with near complete strangers - if you can imagine so.  It really has been lovely just being able to lay low in my flat with Severus's company and the occasional visit from Sirius.

I hope everyone is enjoying their holidays!

I don't want to go back to Hogwarts.  I haven't dreaded returning to school this much ever.  Normally at this time I would be counting down the days, but this year I want to stay in London.  However, I do need to finish Hogwarts, even if Sirius is right about me not needing to get a job.

I only hope that once we are all back at the castle things don't become dramatic again.  Although things have undoubtably managed to be dramatic outside the castle..  We'll see."

Regulus,

I'm sorry it's taken me so long to do this, but we should talk soon.  Please let me know when you're free, all right?

Severus,

I've had quite a bit of homework lately, but I'd like to see you some time soon.  When are you free?

Sirius,

I'm speechless.  I'm not entirely sure as to why I am as I know you too well and should've expected so much, but really.  Thank you so much, Sirius.  I appreciate everything you've done and once I'm settled I'll treat you and Regulus to a homecooked meal.

Love,

Your favourite cousin"

"event","Well then, have'nt these been a few awesome days? I think yes, because the past few days i have spent with tiffany and well there are just a few things that don't need to be said but I will always remember and she might too. It's nice to have somebody to talk to where my mom lives and Tiffany is here so that is awesome, i just can't get by how somebody can be so oblivious to whats going on around them, two people know what that means. I was on the phone talking to her when he called her, she put me on hold to talk to someone that i could of just handed the phone to. Is'nt it great? I think yes but I'm gonna stop for now cuz thats really all thats been on my mind lately."

"event","these past few days have sucked i got robbed, i have discovered my relationship enemy and aptly named it ""the cuteness"" which the person i like just happens to have it even though i was told to give up on it the damn cuteness overcomes all emotion and quite frankly i cant stand it anymore i always fall for the cuteness but it comes back to bite me in the ass every time but i really like her(but im not supposed to because she has the cuteness.) But back to my last few days i was robbed, but it wasnt the fact that i was stolen from it was the fact that it happened right in front of me so i paced in bobs house until there was a hole in her floor(technically)and then i went up to the mall to see the person that i like alot (even though they have the cuteness) and that was cool...until the person that she likes,(besides me...supposedly) came up there and i was ignored for the night. that night only got worse though... because i was told that the person with the cuteness really liked me and i should kiss her, so i was going to until when i was getting ready to do it she called the other person that she likes(NOT me) so it didnt happen...then i got back to bobbis and later fell asleep.. that was the first night. oh yeah i got shoes too they are cool. thats the end of that night...then the next day came and it sucked too. i didnt have my cd player because it was taken the day before. and then i sat around for a while and i thought about how much the day before sucked then heather came over telling bobbi she had something for her that rhymed with crouton, it was tuscon(some army guy that was supposed to be in germany) that is one of bobbis bestest buddies, which doesnt rhyme with crouton at all sooo we went up to the mall and walked around for a while(meanwhile being told that i should give up on the person that has the cuteness) so then we went back home and bobbi talked to heather which was a horrible nightmareishly disturbing conversation that made me throw up twice and have horrible thoughts going through my head then i talked to tiffany(a.k.a the person with the cuteness) which reassured me that i shouldnt give up on it. then i fell asleep and that was the end of that day then started today i woke up went to my grandmas house and then i got online, checked mail and then walked to bobbis where i found out that the person i like has a boyfriend now. soo that really sucked and sort of ruined my day then i went to the mall and saw the reason i got sick twice the night before then we left and im here now typing about my crappy days so i think im done now."

"event","Today was cool i actually woke up before noon and then i went with joe to take nana to work then me and joe went to uncle bills and he bought a fish. then i went to kellys to pick up some of my stuff and then we were off to joes. i like going to joes because theres alomost always a gaurantee that i am going to get fried which was the case today. the day is always better when for at least 4 or 5 hours of it you believe you are stuck in slow motion and eat alomost a entire bowl of jello pudding. then i came back ""home"" which is were i am right now, but i dont have my cell phone so i cant call certain people that i said i was going to call, which in fact i did want to call. but anyways other than being stoned for most of the day it was kinda boring."

"event","well today sucked because at 9 or so my moms phone rang and i woke up. then i tried falling back asleep but then the phone rang which really sucked because i couldnt go back to sleep. i hate my moms phone its possessed by satan every time you want to sleep you hear that annoying phone. but then i woke up and i guess it was my moms friend joann, which i dont like but then joann talked to kelly and david(kellys ex husband) was going to get his ass kicked because he was messin around with a married woman and her husband wants to kick davids ass, i have 50 on the married guy but then krystal woke up.....i think and then bobbi woke up and we were talking about how heather fell asleep on her bed and bobbi told her not to and then my mom left with the devil phone and chichi and shes not in my story anymore because i didnt see her the rest of the day then kelly went to do the laundry which was cool until later in the day, but im not there yet then we ate food and then i got in the shower and i forgot kelly was doin the laundry so i had to air dry which really sucked because its cold in bobbis house then we went to the mall. well im gonna have to end the story for the night because im tired and its 4 which is late so im going to sleep."

And don't you worry, we will be bringing ample sunscreen to block any hint of a tan!  Bah ha.

In other news, I will be having company from Ottawa this weekend.  Sara is ditching me to go to Guelph.  I'll keep my ears peeled for attempted concealments of the door closing and locking at 4 am as the bf leaves.  *Shudder*.

People are stopping by with the landlady to scope out the apartment and it's a disaster.  I have finally taken it upon myself (after having several reasons to do so...ha) to CLEAN and organize the place.  I smell of cleaning products.

Happy Pride Month, everyone.  Debating whether or not to be a Dyke March Marshal / Security again and be useful or just watch.  The boycott of RyeSAC continues.  *High 5 Gregory!*  Splendid good times.

"event","Inside Out is over.  It was fun while it lasted... I got to see 4 films and I met some cool people.  Sara and I took her mom and Sean to see ""Women's Prison"" yesterday.  It was in Farsi with English subtitles, and obviously the subtitles didn't do it any justice so we got the full story from Sara and her mom afterward.  Turns out the ending was super important and I'm sure NOBODY ELSE in the audience got it as there were NO OTHER Persian people there.  It's a good film, see it if you get a chance.  But be sure to have someone who understands Farsi nearby.  

Overall it was an interesting experience.  I'm sure Sara's mom was in lesbo-overload-mode after their little talk and the walk out of the theatre (which entailed hoards of hand-holding women with weird short hair).  Not to mention the Inside Out propaganda and the handouts ( Queer Black Women's Film Festival, etc).  I swear she looks at me with a different squint in her eye now."

My Grammy raised my mom and aunt in New Brunswick when their mom (my grandmother) moved to Toronto for work.  I never got to meet my grandmother, she passed away before I was born.  Grammy had lots of pictures of me in her room, but supposedly I look exactly like my grandmother did when she was young so I think she was confused.  

When my great-auntie Glenna retired, she turned her basement into an apartment for Grammy.  She lived there until she moved into a nursing home a few years ago after falling and breaking her hip.  My family used to drive to St. John to visit every other summer or so.  I remember she even flew here with Glenna to visit once.  

My mom's family came to Canada from Denmark and chose to leave their language and much of their culture behind.  They settled in New Brunswick and helped build the little town of New Denmark.</div>

I'm going out for sushi with Greg and his friends after his theatre group tonight, and then Sara and I are going to see ""Crazy Town"" (shorts).  I finally get to see something!  I will get to see the films that I'm working tech for, as well as getting a voucher for each shift.  I saw Adam Jones during my last shift and he sucker-punched me in the kidneys.  Hmph.  I'll be able to see Pow! Wow! during my tech shift, but I will be working hard that night because both screenings are shorts and I have to help set up each film (21 in total).  I hate headsets so that will be a treat.  

I spent all of Victoria Day weekend helping my mother mix soil and plant her flowers, while dogsitting for my brother at night.  My mom picked me up for breakfast (mmm real food) and would drive me to my dad's sporadically throughout the day to pee the dog.  Dylan is super confused by random family members stopping by and leaving again.  

My dad found a place in Saskatoon close to his work.  I hope he likes it there and everything goes well.

I have read a couple of  books in the past few weeks (me?  read?).  ""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time"" was charming, I recommend it to everyone who values truth in simplicity.  I also read ""Rubyfruit Jungle"" and hated it.  Horrible.  Who has sex when they're in grade 6, and then sleeps with every woman they meet?  Ugh.  Horrible!  Now I'm reading ""The Scarlet Letter"" for lack of better reading material.  At least it's semi-interesting so far.

Sara and I have kicked the DVD burner into high gear.  We're getting our money's worth at 7-24... muah ha ha.  Everyone must see ""Blue Gate Crossing"".  BEST MOVIE EVERRR.  How I love foreign films (it's from Taiwan).  We have also gone through ""Goldfish Memory"" (cute Irish film from Inside Out last year), ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" (enough said), ""Journey to Kafiristan"" (HORRIBLE!!!), ""High Art"" (cut out the ending and it's great, although Ally Sheedy could be a little less creepy), and ""Ma Vie En Rose"" (classic).  Fun.

Finally got film for the old camera (colour this time) and will make a few trips out soon.

My dad left this morning for Saskatoon.  He's driving there, around the Great Lakes, and staying in/near Thunder Bay tonight.  *Shudder*.  He doesn't have a place yet, which is so not like my dad, but I guess he's doing the same thing as when he moved to Canada.  He will be working on the University of Saskatoon campus, which is cool.  He seems excited about the change, and I think it's good for him.  His contract is only 18 months, so he can decide where to go after it is up.  He said he might move on to Calgary.  Dave has the house to himself and is in charge of Dylan.  I'm on dog duty this weekend (a great way to spend May 2-4, pffft) because he's going away with his friends.

I got an odd (super-dykey) gift from my former boss in the mail.  It's a Batman journal.  Where do I begin...

I also checked my marks last week, I suppose they are good except I did horribly in Social Policy.  That was to be expected for several reasons.  But I got an A+ in Anti-Oppression!  :o)  

My first shift at Inside Out is on Friday.  I'm super excited to see some of the stuff they have this year.  I am a big fan of the compilations of shorts.

My mom and I decided to go to Little Italy for Mother's Day instead.  We walked all the way across College past Ossington (into Little Portugal) looking at restaurants, and then turned around and ended up at Cafe Diplomatico (594 College).  It was really good, and there was a line for the patio so we figured it was a good choice.  We had been walking in the sun for a while so we ate inside.  Definitely a place to go back to... the pizza looked amazing and appropriate for accompanying a few beers on their patio.

It's always a good time exploring with my mom.  She has these stories about moving all over the city and how the neighbourhoods used to be.  She used to work at the Esso station at Dupont and Dovercourt when she was really young.  Is it still there?  She also spoke of electric streetcar-like buses on Ossington.  Cool beans.  We stopped to gaze at a super long ""true"" laneway... I will definitely take my camera back there.

"event","I left my jacket on the Greyhound.  I was sitting on it.  Sara and I were too busy beating each other during our U-Haul game to notice that I left it when we got up to ask the driver to stop.  I remembered that I had a jacket as soon as the bus pulled away.  After attempting to call the bus terminal several times and having nobody pick up, we ventured downtown on the Guelph city bus (which actually had a nice driver this time, compared to all of the usual incompetent assholes).  They have recently changed the routes, so we got off a few stops early.  To our disgust, we found ourselves right in front of the Cornerstone (a.k.a. Guelph Lesbo Central).  I kid you not, we peeped into the always-steamy window and counted a good 3 dread-heads.  And that unmistakable stench that poured from the walls.  *shudder*  The lesbo smell.  You know what I'm talking about... every lesbian bar, and lesbo, smells like it.  Except me and Sara  :o)  

Anyhoo...

We got to the terminal and the dude said that the bus had gone to Kitchener and that the driver would be back in Guelph sometime that evening.  I left my contact info and we went outside to catch the city bus back to Sara's.  We had time to kill, so we wandered up and down the street looking at restaurants and stores.  And trying not to breathe in the pot that passers-by were smoking.  Sara told me a cute story about Tegan and Sara staying at that hotel and the Pita Pit across the street.  I was baffled that Frank & Stein's wasn't a family hot dog joint.  The same bus driver was driving the bus, and she looked the other way when we used the same transfer for our return trip.  Thanks for not causing us to be stranded.

The dude called Sara's house before we got home to say that my jacket had arrived.  Sean drove us to the terminal the next day and I retrieved it.

On the Greyhound there was a German couple sitting beside us (we could tell before they even sat down that they were German... the tight shirt, etc.)  About half-way to Guelph, the guy whips out a tupperware container full of apple crumble.  I couldn't believe it!

"event","Had an odd assortment of days recently.

My exam on Tuesday went alright I think, there were a few ridiculous essay questions on things that nobody took notes on.  I know this because our 8 am 3-hour long class never bothered to.  Yes, this includes me.  It is definitely one of those schemes to bring the class average down... *mumbles*.  Not to mention that I hate writing exams in the GYM!  I went to hand the thing in and my prof told me that it was a pleasure having me in his class.  Aww.  I will miss him... Ryerson needs more profs like that.  He always made me smile and was fun to talk to.  Hire more young smart cute bald black gay men, Ryerson!

Sara and I went to my dad's house yesterday.  We took Dylan for a walk and raided the fridge.  My brother and dad looked happy to see us.  I made dinner and then we watched tv as usual.  My brother bought a black '97 BMW in the past few weeks (dumbass, my dad is now teaching him to drive a stick shift.  He's driving my dad's car in the meantime).  My dad drove us home in it and it's super nice... leather interior, sunroof, 6 cd changer, etc.  

Meanwhile, back at the ranch... (who is it that always used to say that?)

The fighting continues and there is no solution in sight.  I am to think about it and try to fix it.  It's much more difficult than it sounds ,with no starting point to push off from.  

I'm supposed to be at a lunch right now, but I don't feel like making small talk and I'm not too fond of the venue anyway.  Blah. 

On with the job search..."

"event","So I got my first choice placement for next year.  It's a supercool agency.  I had my interview this morning and was taken on a tour of the building and programs there.  I got to meet all of the participants and get a feel for whether I want to do my placement there next year (by the end it had been set...yes).  The lady who interviewed me sounded a bit mean on the phone (and even through email), but she was really nice and she did most (all) of the talking.  I think she asked me a total of 1 question other than administrative stuff.  She talked for an hour, but it allowed me to get a really good sense of the services and programs that they have, and by the time we walked around it was pretty much exactly how I imagined it.  It's going to be really challenging, but I like the teamwork setting and it has ALL of the positive aspects of an agency that I can think of and have learned about.  Well, other than the fact that it's a poor agency that is losing some funding.  That's a shitty deal.  But I will be working there for FREE 2 days a week for 2 semesters.  I'm a bit nervous about asking if I can miss 2 weeks to rendez-vous with my family in Florida and make them up at the end of my placement.  If not, that's really sucky but ok.  It will save me from the akwardness of ""no, Grampa, I'm not 'courting' any boys or planning to get married without inviting you"".  Ah, the joys of having most of your relatives in other continents.

I'm excited, but the lady intimidated me when she said that my interview would be when clients will be there.  I guess I am glad to know that ahead of time though.  Of the crappy selection in the 3rd year binders, I found ONE place where I wouldn't mind working (it's name is promising: C.O.R.E. - Centre for Opportunities, Respect and Empowerment), I have some sort of formal background working with the client population (adults with disabilities), and it's within walking distance of my apartment.

They seem very nice.  Gilo and I went to Dutch Dreams for ice cream.  Mmmmm.  Gilo spoiled me by taking me shopping and giving me some presents that she had stashed at her place from past birthdays and Christmases.  She got me a really cool necklace, a bunch of cool Body Shop stuff, and a book that I wanted to read (The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time by Mark Haddon).       

I got my first exam out of the way yesterday... I think it went well.  You can never tell with vague essay questions though.  And a 70 year old prof.  Ah, Bernie.  I finally handed in that damn social policy paper too.

I still haven't adjusted to the spring transition from random snow to random thunderstorms.  I never really noticed it when I lived in North York, but since I'm so close to the lake now, the crack of thunder is much louder.  Not to mention the cheap windows in my highrise building rattling.  

The weather is seriously different here.  I didn't think a half-hour subway ride would divide climates so much!  Then again, the amount of green up there and the lack of it down here is quite a contrast.

"event","Of all weekends, we have to lose an hour from THIS one.  Still so much to do.  Meh, I can deal with it... it means Sara will come home one hour sooner.  And also that little factor of the longer daylight days.  Yes, that.

I watched 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' today (I had an urge to go shopping yesterday (how odd of me.) and ended up using my HMV gift certificates to buy two things I had never heard/seen before (how odd of me.).  The movie was alright, it seemed to drag on but the end was kinda sweet.  The annoying actors weren't too annoying.  Sara's right though, it's not a movie you can watch over and over again like some of our favourites.    

The other thing I bought is 'Let It Die' (Feist).  I finally got to hear the song Sara dedicates to me... aww.  I'd heard it before, but if you know me you know that I'm horrible with labels (names, titles, etc.). I have listened to the entire album maybe 20 times since I bought it.  It's short, but still.  I haven't bought a CD in a really long time.  Not that I pirate a lot either... my mp3s are ancient.  Something new(er) is refreshing.  And I can't really say that I like some songs more than others...diverse yet solid.  Just how I like it.

Where it all sprang from:  we were watching Vicki Gabereau (why?) and couldn't figure out who was on.  (See, my sub-par labeling skills at work.).  We got to 'Montreal pomo' (the best kind, sophisticated and genuine, unlike 'Toronto pomo' and the various subgenres therein - (tangent: the flip flops have officially been brought out already, which is ok as long as the fuzzy (or non-fuzzy for that matter) pom pom boots are gone) - who defeat the purpose of 'being weird for the sake of being weird' by spending $400 on clothes that quite possibly came straight from the dumpster.  And WHY does the street always smell like incense?!  Ahem.  'Montreal pomo', although she's not from Montreal, turned out to be Feist.  There ya go.  The point."

The lady who works there looks kinda like Marina from The L Word (Mmmm.) and she looked at me as though I was crazy when I ordered.  Speaking of crazy, on my way over, I remembered my recent conversation with Monika about OCAD looking like a children's mental institution (at night). (Nope, in the day too).  It's really true!  Well, from my building's view anyway.

We hightailed it out of there and went our separate ways home.

When I got to the front of the line, she wanted to see I.D., and of course, it was in my jacket inside.  I showed her my coat check ticket.  She told me to take my I.D. out of my jacket next time I went outside so I could get back in.  Great system.  I've been going there for what... 3 years now... and still get carded every single time.

Tango went through a stage when my friends and I went there every weekend and got trashed and flirted the place up (well, at least THEY did).  Then it went dead and we didn't go as much.  Then a wave of young teenage faces came in (barely 19) and we avoided the place all together.  Apparently, the crowd has changed dramatically again.  Hot people!  An equal ratio of hot to creepy.  There were also a few cute couples.  It's nice to see people flirt with each other (I haven't been out in a while!).  Creepy woman checked me out. *shudder*.  Cute girl smiled at me, I smiled back.  She moved to stand beside me and bumped into my arm and apologized (ask me about it, I'll draw you a diagram).  Real smooth.  Yes you, green-shirted girl.  The music stopped, lights came on, and I retrieved my jacket from the coat check.  The girl who works there called me sweetie and asked me how I was.  I was nice back.

Met up with the RyePride/SAC crew and of course, it had to be THE WINDIEST DAY EVER when we needed to carry a long banner.  Ugh.  That pocket knife really comes in handy a lot... I made some windholes and we were off.  The student groups met up at Dundas Square and marched over to Nathan Phillips Square to join the rest.  There were a few speakers there to set the tone for the day.  Politicians, former U.S. soldiers who refused to murder innocent civilians - and their families who are seeking refugee status here in Canada, and a 14 year old Iraqi girl.  I liked her speech the best.

We ditched the march when the cops had to separate the Ukrainian demonstration from the Troops Out Now! marchers.

"event","Mad props to Greg for all of his work:

""Thank you everyone on your help!

Today, I contacted the Port Perry Star, which was very interested in doing a
story, as soon as the reporter comes off of holidays on Monday.

Bruce Rogers, the esteemed journalist, author and 2004 candidate for the NDP in
Clarington-Scugog-Uxbridge voiced his support, and is graciously writing a
letter into the Port Perry Star about the matter

I canvassed approximately 50 houses, and received far more support from the
community, of all age groups, than I did opposition.  I collected over two dozen
signatures, and a handful of the pamphlets (many people threw them out already,
naturally), and I'll be going around the community some more tomorrow.

My main concern is, as always, the community, especially those that will be
effected by the outcome of this bill (be it personally, or through a loved one),
and the backlash that people will face from all the homophobic rhetoric and
propaganda, especially in areas such as the schools, that I know all too well. 
I'm trying very hard to put a human face of support from within this community,
but there is no way I could even canvass a fraction of Port Perry, let alone the
rest of the area, on my own.  Please, if anyone can provide help in that area,
as the feedback has been great, I'd appreciate it.

Thank you so much for all your support and help, I wouldn't be able to do
anything without your support.

In Solidarity,
Gregory Allan Evans""

I dragged (ha! wow I'm clever.) a friend out to Sneaky Dee's tonight for Genderfukt!.  It was such a great show... the best drag show I have ever seen, in fact.  Many steps up from the regular Wednesday night shows at Tango.  I didn't even mind paying to get in.  I never really took to drag king shows before.  I was always more fascinated by drag queens.  After all, many lesbians are genderbending in the way they dress anyway, but gay men... not so much.  (I was told by a friend that back in the day, lesbians would do drag in dresses.  Now that's genderbending if you ask me).  Anyway, the thought and artistry that went into this show was impressive.  I wanted to go last time as well, but there was a blizzard and I decided to stay home instead.  Now I'm sorry I missed it, and I will definitely be at the next show.  It was good to see some old friends and familiar faces, as I have been a hermit lately and as you all know, a loner.  :oP

Time for bed."

"event","In the office, in a deserted building, at 6pm on a Friday.  Making up hours.  Look at me working!  

I ended up in Guelph for St.Patrick's Day after all and didn't really drink.  Only one of us did, and that was quite funny... should have done the permanent marker thing.  Next time.  Muah-ha-ha.  I finally slept well for once.  

The march and rally are tomorrow.  I hope it doesn't rain.  :o(  If it does, the banner will be heavy.  But still held high.

I must update myself about what's going on with the family and friends.  Also must start studying.

Going home now... this place is creepy when nobody's around and still smelly.

Peace out."

"event","Got stuck in a barricade with a bunch of drunken engineers today.  They even brought their pitchers of green beer outside.  Bless them.  I think I have lost a good 15% of my hearing though.  At least we will get the hint if there is ever actually a fire.

I finally got rid of those damn bins in the office.  We shoved all of the contents into the co-ord office for now, cleaned up a bit, and rearranged furniture to try to figure out a good arrangement.  It looks like a living room right now, if you imagine the monitor is a tv.  It would be nice to get bookshelves though, you know, for those things...oh yeah, books.  

The 8am presentation went well, I think.  It was one of those presentations that you can't remember for the life of you what you discussed afterward.  Prof said that we did a ""very good job"" though.  Meh.

Grabbed some lunch from Oakham and gave a tip, although it was takeout, because I confused the poor girl.  She was clearly not familiar with the concept of people showing their student cards to get the student discount.  

Curse you, Cleve LaPinder and associates!  Doesn't it occur to you that you are disrupting other peoples' lives as well?  It ain't gonna happen! Dah.

Gonna call mom... she wants to go for udon again.  Mmmm.  How I love you HoSU.  

Later: drinky drinky."

"event","I designed and painted a banner for Saturday today. It finally feels like a community in the new building, having spent most of the day with coordinators from the other CSGs.  With only about 3 ""real"" weeks left in the school year, it's a shame that this feeling originates so late.  

I have a presentation at 8 am tomorrow.  Joy.  Gettin trashed afterward (St. Patrick's Day...yes...good excuse).  Went to the airport today as well.  We had to go to Terminal 3 though, not 1.  The flight was actually early!  Good timing.  I took a different bus back to the subway... and it did take like an hour.  That meant that I got to see a part of the city I usually don't see.  Passed by the Canadian Tire at Dufferin.  R.I.P. car.

Winter is officially ending in 4 days.  :o(  Farewell, odd sensation of having frostbitten ears and sweaty pits at the same time.  My mom's call on the extreme weather jacket proved to be a bit much.  At least I didn't wear a windbreaker all winter, like some people.  Ahem.  I really don't like summer though.  Apart from the bright colours and having less things to carry.  All I'm really looking forward to is having a break from school and maybe going back to Wonderland to test out our theory again.

Happy St.Patrick's Day. Party at our place.  Byob."

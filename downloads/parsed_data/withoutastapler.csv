After work I had to do my Physics homework....Mr. Boren is a stupid fuckhead.......grrrrrrrr......anyway, I will try to call you soon.....right now I have 7 classes including my college one. I am uber busy. Lots of love! Oh, by the way, I do remember playing Mother May I behind the restaurant. Do you remember staying up late in the living room playing Donkey Kong on the N-64???

For some reason I don't think this is possible. I finished the night off with doing my Physics homework. How high can I throw a ball???? FUCK YOU MR. BOREN!!!! d=Vi(T) + 1/2a(T^2).....I guess I can throw a ball 22 feet high......Taking in gravity into account. 
I ate a wonderful Veggie Delight sub from Subway for dinner. For lunch I had a can of spaghettio's(not heated) and for breakfast and brunch I had a special k bar and nachos and cheese, respectively. 
I ate no meat today! Woooohaa! Go me.

I hope Colin is recovering. Keep posting and maybe someday I will reply to a post!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

If you're out there, I miss you!!!! I hope you are reading the book I left for you to read! Today was such a boring day! I wish I could be laying out in the sun with you on the trampoline! 
Today wasn't a total loss, I went to a pet store with Billy and got 3 fish for the fish tank! They are so cool! You can see through them except in their intestines, the company that stocks them injects a neon dye! So I have two see through fish with lime green and neon pink intestines! I have another kind of fish that is soooo shiny! He is a baby blue color, I think you would like him the best!
I made Billy watch Spanglish with me this morning! He liked it soooo much. 
Today it rained so hard that you couldnt see through your windshield. It sucked. I start tanning tomorrow to get rid of my tan lines.
My dress came in the mail yesterday and it fits me awesomely!
I hope my shoes come soon.
Well, I better get to bed. I have to work tomorrow.

Whats one day late? 
Today is another long, hot day in Sunny Texas. So far, the high today is 104 with absolutely NO BREEZE!!!! 
I just love to fry like an egg in a steamy mini van. Fun fun fun. 
Currently, I am bored out of my mind and thinking of my hunky man slaving away in a kitchen some thousand miles away. I'm sure he's having sooo much more fun than me. ;P 
Well, I'm getting super excited about my birthday coming up in August. Can't wait for no driving restrictions. (Not that I ever get pulled over for driving past midnight anyway)
Senior year is a few short months away and I am so excited I can hardly stand it. It will be my last year of Wings of Harmony and I'll get all of the seniority. I'm sure by the last month of school I'll be begging for more time in my Youth. But, until then, pleeaasse get over with so I can get married and have kids and go to College and have my own house and not care about run on sentences. (haha)

Currently, I am in Texas visiting my Uncle and his bratty children. This is day four of ten that I must spend ""down South."" I am so ready to go home it is unreal. I want to spend time with my friends and listen to my music and play my guitar. For some reason, I thought ten days would go by fast and I would be having a great time. Well, I am a complete idiot. I don't know what the HelL I was thinking but I'm sure I wont be thinking it ever again. 
I found my way to Live Journal after realizing I forgot my member name and password to Dead Journal. Its very sad but I am afraid my account there might have been terminated. Oh well, I must make the best of this one. 
It is 11:38 pm in Texas which means that back in Michigan it is 12:38 am. Fun fun fun, fun in the sun. NOT!
Not fun in the sun. Hell in the sun. Today when I woke up it was already 95 outside. That promised a horrible hot, sweaty day. I dont know why anyone in their right mnd would want to live in such a hot hot hot place.
The only good thing about this place is that I get to spend time with my cousin from Reno. She is visitng her Dad for the summer. I also enjoy spending time with my uncle, whom I rarely get to see. His wife is very funny in her own quirky way. Lets just say she needs to have a girl of her own before the boys drive her mad.
Well, I'm sure I keeping everyone up with my typing.

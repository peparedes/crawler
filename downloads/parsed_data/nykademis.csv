"event","WELL now not only am I a secret shopper (it's when you go to a store and buy shit and then write the company and tell them how good or shitty the store did then get PAID) now I also sell Avon. So if you need Avon shit order through me. If your not even in Maryland well for 3 bucks they deliver it to your door. And yes Avon is a worldwide thing. 

Kaden rolls over now! Well he doesn't do it all the time, but he did it for the second time in two weeks today. He also slept alot today I think he's exhausted. We spent most of the week outside my house because we didn't have AC. Well we FINALLY have it and he SLEEPS ALL DAY! I didn't get a chance to talk to him today. Usually we talk for about 2 hours everyday. Well I talk he just babbles back and smiles really big. When he starts talking I'm in so much troubgle. The amount oof babbling that he does right now tells me I'm gonna have one of those ""Why?"" kids. I'm actually looking forward to it.

And he's 3 1/2 months old and he's eyes keep changing color. Monday they were this awesome green color. Tuesday they were gray. Wednesday they were hazel, thrusday they were brown, and today they were this golden brown color and last time he was awake there was a definite green tint to them. He's growing up to fast and I'm glad I'm not missing it. I'd hate to put him in daycare, and recently due to horror stories about daycare I don't think I ever want to.

Don't know what I'm talking about? Google Kaleb Schwade. Then tell me I'm not doing the right thing. Wanna help me out? Order some Avon even if it's for your mom, your ex, that chick you met at the club last week. The more money I make the less chance I have of having to put him in a daycare where he can get sick hurt or worse. Wanna see Kaden in all his glory? Email me there's tons of pics.

While you're not sarcastic at all times, you definitely have a cynical edge.
In your opinion, not all people are annoying. Some are dead!
And although you do have your genuine moments, you can't help getting your zingers in.
Some people might be a little hurt by your sarcasm, but it's more likely they think you're hilarious.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/howsarcasticareyouquiz/"">How Sarcastic Are You?</a></div>"

So now I work from home sorta freelance as a secret shopper, my house has no AC and it's like 80 something degrees and 90% humidity. I have no money left after medical bills, my old job won't fill out the info I need to get retro pay from the insurance company of the lady that hit us on Christmas Eve. Which is what sent me into pre-term labor in the first place. People suck, but I'll survive. I'll just have to bitch about it.

Oh so that's kinda it for now."

I haven't seen it in so long I'm wondering where all the doctors went. There's like 3 new people on the cast. And the only original cast memeber is that Jerry guy that works at the desk. And he left for like 3 seasons at one point. And now there's another doctor/doctor wedding. Big surprise, but she's way hotter than Alex Kingston, who I'd do too. She was hot for a blonde woman.

I hate this time of year, peoples heads are stuck even further up their asses. Rushing to buy their little bratty ass offspring shit they don't need. I had one woman walk out of the store yesterday yelling at me about  ""If I wanted advice I would've asked for it"" to which I replied ""You might wanna get that baby puke off your shoulder then"" under my breath. People suck, and that's sad. But sad people don't suck, they're just...well sad I guess. I need to remember to give Rachel her book back. Maybe I should write that down somewhere, so I stop forgetting. Oh well that's done.

"event","Well not really but I'm still up for some strange reason. I know why. I'M READING STAR TREK FANFICTION. Not as good as Buffy, but the chicks are equally hot. Wicked (you know the slacker) knows what I mean. And Dee if you're reading this. GET A FUCKING LJ. I'll read it. Promise.

Ok now I love my job. 

A little girl walked into my store with her dad today to do some school shopping. He said he had no idea what to get her and kinda handed her over to me and sat in one of our visitor chairs. So after asking her name and age, we weighed her and started picking out clothes to try on. After a rather rousing conversation on the evils of the color pink (she was pretty smart for a 7 year old) we got down to business.

$378 and are 17 outfits later we have pity on Daddy and call it a day. As we're ringing her up he asks her if this is what she wanted and if she got everthing. She brings up needing to get shoes (aside from the 3 pairs she's got from us) and a bra (oh poor Daddy) she's happy. 

I really love my job.

But now I can't sleep cuz I took a friggin two hour nap this afternoon, and woke up to a nice seafood dinner and a movie I haven't seen in years. Then I talked to Spaz until I thought I should be in bed, then found out I couldn't sleep but she isn't online anymore so now I'm all bored and harrassing Dee again. Which is fun as hell if I can get her to talk dirty to me (wink a wicked) but she tends to be a bit shy unlike certain people from California who fornicate daily and live to tell about it. So I'm gonna watch the episodes of THe L Word that I've got downloaded then probably do some ungodly things to myself with a vibrator before going to sleep.

PEACE OUT BITCHES!"

"event","Jordana Brewster is worth obsessing over. She's as hot as Eliza Dushku. And's that's saying alot coming from me. So Spaz. YOU FINALLY DEVELOPED SOME TASTE! And don't take that the wrong way. You know how I am about apologizing if you're not Val or a certain 'Mounted Canadian Pillow Queen Fucker Dork.

So yeah watched D.E.B.S for the second time in as many days. And planning to buy the DVD with my next paycheck. I gotta get the special edition though. I want that extended sex scene Spaz was masturbating too this morning.

But Emily you are still unhealthily obsessed with Katey. Not that I can really blame you seeing as Katey's quite fuckable. But still, calm down a little, she'll let you lick her eventually (hopefully Katey's isn't reading this.

Wicked is still a slacker, but a slacker with a part time job, even though she sleeps 19 hours a day and then stalks girls with smaller boobs than her (she thinks it's funny).

I'm almost in the mood to write again. So if anyone actually 'reads' my fanfiction, hell if anyone 'skims' the crap there might be more coming soon. But don't hold your breath, my Muse is a tempermental skank with sex on the brain (like Spaz only she's not a skank).

And YAY LISA! It's about time you found someone you could love (besides me since you deserve WAY better *wink wink*)

Hmm...well I think that's all I have to say today. Maybe more....some day other than today.... uh....bye."

While bathing I happened to look down and admire my breasts (as women often do. DON'T LIE BITCHES) and noticed that my bikini top had been nice enough to leave light colored triangles on my otherwise brown breasts.

And my neck and shoulders are all red because unlike 'normal' black people. Us light skinned negros (you know the ones what woulda worked in the house?) can have sensitive skin and BURN!

So THANK YOU ANEMIA you've FUCKED ME OVER AGAIN!

I have sunburned.

Shit.

But on a happier note, I don't feel like warmed over DEATH anymore. Which is always a plus."

"event","Ok so everyone knows I hate skirts. Well lately I LOOOOOOVE the skirts that I've been seeing so I bought two in less than a week. Now the blue one I bought has like 3 shades of blue in it, and then I bought a purple one, which happens to match like 5 shirts I already had. And I didn't do that on purpose. I swear. I like purple that's all.

So anyway I look like a girl today. And it's nice, since it's fucking hotter than good porn outside. And all I'm wearing is a tank top with no bra, a skirt and no panties (yeah that's right bitches COMMANDO). So yeah I havta find more skirts. It's like an obsession now. But since Emily is obsessed with Katey and Spaz is obsessed with Jordana Brewster and Wicked....I think she's just a slacker. I need my own obsession. Oh and I smell good too."

"event","Ok so in the paper today there's a story about 3 guys.

One is a Bartender one is a resturaunt manager, and the third a buss boy.

Well these three 'gentleman' ,and I use this term very loosely, decided to get drunk after the resturaunt closed. Well the Bartender passes out, and the Buss Boy and Manager keep drinking. So the buss boy who's only 19 can't really hold his liquor, as he's fading in and out of consciousness the Manager who is also drunk (and apparently some kind of sadist) takes him out to the alley behind the kitchen shoves a hose up his ass and turns it on full force. While the buss boy is on his knee's suffering, he decides (the manager) that he's just gonna wank off to this. Later he passes out. The buss boy is slowly bleeding out in the alley the bartender is still unconscious and the back door to the kitchen is wide open setting off a silent alarm.

The police show up and find the buss boy barely alive and the other two still passed out.

Sounds like a frat party. But nooooooooooooo, 2 grown men, WILLINGLY gave alcohol to an underaged person, and one decided to violate him. AND THE BASTARD IS ALREADY OUT OF JAIL!

Fucking shitty legal system (no pun intended)

Ok. Now I'm gonna go...hide."

Except into your own mind which can be dangerous....or creative...possibly insightful. Unless your me. Then it's just unheathly. Last time I did that I wrote a 52 chapter Buffy fic. Well that was creative...kinda....but mostly dangerous. I don't recommend doing it alot. It becomes addictive then you wake up with your fingers in your....well that's another story.

So fourth of July was awesome. Watched two chicks make out for a while. SO totally GOD BLESS THE USA and all it's fake bisexual beauties. God I so need a girlfriend.

Know any single lesbians?

"event","So! I switched shifts with a co-worker today (Emily) I usualy work mornings and get off at one, but she had a funeral or something to go do so we switched. I went IN at 1 and got to do stock instead of cashier, which was way funner than I thought it would be. I got home around 6 (instead of 2 obviously) and now I'm not tired at all when normally I get home and pass out until about 8 or 9pm. I started talking to random people on yahoo and lately I haven't been much for talk, and we share a bunch of photo's which led to me updating one of my albums, so for now I'm obsessed with scrapbooking again. Which is a terrible thing. I need a real hobby, like licking hot girls, or just not being home at all. SOMETHING different would be nice.

So today wasn't too too bad. I found out I am apparently an item with a girl I wouldn't mind being an item with, and my ass is comparable to Jessica Alba's. My ego has been stroked to orgasm. and I forgot to add wicked as a friend. which she just reminded me to do. So wicked if I forget again just like reply to this or something."

And why they never brushed their hair. Then I fell asleep. And then I watched Xena. Minus the chocolate. Paris' feet smell like old popcorn. Do they make doggy foot spray? If not they so SHOULD. My room smells like feet that aren't mine. Well technically they ARE mine since I do kinda own the dog. But jeez, she's funkay!

"event","I took my first exam today. Totally sucked, cuz I studied for it. Now after I've paid the $700 dollars to go to AACC this semester I've decided to once again change my major. I lack serious people skills, so I'm thinking that Human Services is NOT the field I should go into. Which means I'll be paying well over $1000 dollars next semester for computer classes. Machines I can deal with. People, I tend to avoid like some kind of plague, or a bad smell. IS that 'bad' or one of those kick ass 'know thyself' things everyone smarts about? Either way, human contact is by far overrated in the realm I studied. I think I might take creative writing too. Make my own little fictional world and fuck it up according to my own rule. Fun. No really it is.

So I took my dog (Paris Hilton) to the vet today. Not that she's sick or anything, but they needed a fecal sample to check for heart worms. So me and Rachel collected 'poo' and took a nice ride to PetsMart, where Paris took the opportunity to mark her 7 inch territory on the floor in front of the sliding doors. Which I found hilarious, but the woman who stepped in it seemed kinda pissed about it. Some people, if shit happens one would think piss happens too.

And being the slightly anti-social butterfly I'm gonna go drown myself in Xena fanfiction and maybe some chocolate."

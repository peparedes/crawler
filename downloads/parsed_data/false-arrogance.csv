"event","Though this blog was ment for my entertainment only I guess I've got a few loyal fans out there wanting to know about my life. Things come and go. But I think finally one thing will stick. <b><3 My Baby <3</b> I hate seeing blogs that say that...but now I'm glad to use it.

<b>New Semester Just Around The Corner</b> We've all been waiting for it. Some of us didn't want it to happen but it's finally here. BUM BUM BUM! I've got my classes perminently changed.
1] Advanced Art - Mr. Jervis
2] TA - Ms. Sugden
3] Drama - Mr. Finley
4] Photography - That one teacher
Yes!!! Hardly any homework. I have two art classes because Ms. Shin wanted me to take them because I'm a great artist blah blah blah. Then I'm finally a Teachers Assistant but with Christine ^_^ I'm taking drama because I'm really good at acting and I love my wild accents (and to piss off Finley again).

Today 'the guys' and me are about to hang at my place. We haven't hung out in a LONG time. Only because we have girlfriends and stuff now. But oh well. Video games, pizza, ducttape. I can see it now...

~Well I'm outta here, Mike"

"event","Poop. Another day of school. Oh well, guess I have to learn. Not much to do since it's the end of the semester. Just a couple finals here and there.

I needa change my classes. They're basically all electives. Nothing special. Mostly art. I have Advanced Art with Jervis. Photography which sounds real fun too. And Design Tech. OMFG! I love these classes. Hard time to fail there boys and girls. Plus they are all electives that'll help me in the future. ^_^

Still so happy.

"event","Hey everyone. It's your favorite star...MICHAEL!!! Well right now I'm in my computer room dressed up as a Beatnik (50's coffee house poet). I have on my barret, tight black shirt, soul patch, square sunglasses...oh yeah, I am the man.

Well looks like I'm gonna go and practice some more of the poetry.

~Tata for now, Mike"

"event","Well nice to see you. I'm Michael. -shakes hands-

Guess I have to introduce myself better. I'm a coconut flip guy (Filipino that thinks he's white), I listen to punk rock and do sports such as skateboarding. I like to shop alot, usually for clothes and stuff. I'm easy to talk to...just don't start any talks about sex or stuff like that, I could be a bad boy. I'm SOMETIMES excessive compulsive like at school if I see someone's stuff out of order or tilted I fix it...or go crazy. I LOVE ALL MOVIES. Except ones that are basically stupid (AKA house of the dead and that one movie where there are two people lost at sea and there are sharks). I'm fast at typing and I mess up spelling rarely. I have the best handwriting on the west coast. Looks like ARIAL on a computer. Some of my talents are; writing backwards, climbing things and winning at bloody knuckles. Oh yeah, I'm also part computer geek. I know tons of HTML and web building stuff, I'm also trying to major in graphics and animation.

Well hopefully that'll give you a taste of who I am.
~Mike"

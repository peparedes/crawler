"event","and so it has been the way that negative space tends to define the edges of me.  borderline realities create the outlines which i choose to call my life.  by what i am not, by what i am not to do, by what i cannot be, by what i cannot have.  by these things i crouch, a child by the seashore letting go of shells one by one, dropping them back in the ocean until left shining precious alone on my palm is....is what?
and this is the moment the sun blinds my eyes and i cry intuitive unable to catch glimpse of this.  just this."

"event","thank you ""julie"" for nt writers center acknowledgement that nursing happens and you happened.

A patient: lets call her julie
beautiful, from boorooloola
beaten by her husband
did i mention she is beautiful
her jaw - okay - on the xray
but her lung collapses out of pity

Dont say home, she says

(julie smiles and smiles at me
when the bandage from 
her brow to her jaw
is unwound slow and sure
did i mention she is beautiful)

But her lung collapses out of pity
(later - dont say home - she'll moan)
treatment is a drain to reinflate her lung again
stuck in the space
between her lung and her chest wall

They bring her here
did i mention she is beautiful
Perhaps thats why the ward doctor
accompanies her
an act ive never seen before, pushing
the cranky hospital bed himself

Dont say home, she said

Our doctor props her sitting up
with pillows
bent forward arms hugging them and her belly
her flank exposed vulnerable
it is cleansed with orange betadine
antibacterial violently industrial 
against the fragile skin

small needle at the spot local painkiller

pink needle stabbed in
Julie moans
then scapel
cuts a bigger hole
then dialators, four sizes
increasing stretching
for the drain
for the hard plastic of the drain
the size of cannelloni
Julie moans - did i mention

""Im painin ""
""Im painin fuck ""
""Fuckin stop, Im painin ""

The doctor 
switches from
adulation
to admonish her.

""Dont swear
at us 
helping you""
""we're gonna fix you up
so you
can go home""
""Dont swear
at us
helping you""

Julie sits silent
Tears and Tears fall and slip
a pile of tissues grows
Dont say home.

The drain, when in
is connected to a tube
which is connected to a bag
which collects dark yellow bubbles
the dirty scum on a river
the debris of degraded hearts
the flush of soluable persons.

We are finished.

I put on a clean, I mean, white 
dressing on
""This'll fix you up
 This'll get you home."""

"event","A shift begins and ends with a coven.
I enjoy them,  the intersection of shift workers.
Talking. Saying. Words.
A gathering of fresh new nurses.
Presided over by weary experienced nurses from the former shift.
A coven, a gathering, a ritual meeting  HANDOVER

The elders tell tales of health and wellbeing
Illness and functioning
With subtle and not-so-subtle direction
For the coming hours
For the acolyte nurses
Giving charms and magic tips to stretch time
For the next shift to accomplish
All that needs to be done.
Like a covenant of care in a dusty volume
On ancient paper
A formula  HANDOVER

Nurses talk.  Nurses talk and talk and talk and do.
Words shape around bodies, Define conditions
Relate emotive timescapes,
Predict fortunes and fates.
Words tell tales of what has been and what might be yet.
The next shift usually has a piece of paper
And a pen To record them.
They sit with quiet rapt attention
Channelling the wisdom earned
After 8 hours intimacy with another humans body. 
Words have weight
In NURSING Handover Rituals.

Handover can be frugal.
Name, age, history, diagnosis. 
The night nurse stumbling dyslexic with tiredness.
I lean forward to decipher the mumble
I slump back in the chair feeling the start of hectic shift
The workload seems impossible. Then.

Handover can be garrulous.
Name, age, history, diagnosis
Life story, possible plans,  discharge dreams
Emotional predictions,  personal interaction.
The morning nurse in a sweaty glow.
the ache of achievement in her Proud drained voice.
I take precise notes, 
knowing grateful
that The patients are painfree  
medicated judiciously
And ready for the coming day.  

For all the shades of nurses
For all the variations and themes of our lives
Out here,  with you
Put on our uniform, enter our profession, 
Human here and now
Handing over from each to each
Like a coven
Like a tea ceremony
Like a ritual born of women
24hours a day
nurses say and say and say what they do
FOR  YOU"

relinquish kombi craving, relinquish lifestyle, greed, ignorance
the lovelorn pathe' of least resistance
bookmarks scattered scrapbooked photo-shattered memory
now
the minimalism
sets in, the bare bones i was and i am become

easy transitions from work love and nursing nurture
to the energetic transient tribal gatherings supporting 
the fascism of government interventions while i vote from darwin
the future of reclaiming the night while i flagellate from darwin
the headthrown back laughter of a genuine woman
when elemental sensuality is discussed in relation to darwin weather patterns and biorhythms and such.

then hammock hugging buttock 
swing my sweet lonely
and sleep like christmas eve
every day present
beach picnics, kite surfing lessons, coffee confidentials,
solo night driving safe with mates car
spontaneous sound appartments and mc moments 
thrashing out the song i wrote
the breakup song sung loud and proud and open


wholesome body nurture balance
lounge room blessed free of television
kitchen free of the dead meat
most poignant in unbitten nails
returned flat stomach allows the dragon to fly again
the wiggle in the pants of buying underware independance
sensual soul nurture balance
slow slow imperfection tolerance
gazing at the revealed navel
grateful
to relinquish 
this
my red kombi"

When there are no eyes upon me,
I expand.

Dawn dirtbike down the Darling,
Bewailing its fate with
Moriaty mumbles and
Muscle-pumping jumps
Of, could it be, happiness?

Dawn again, on the downs,

you sit by the fire. thinking traditional fireside thoughts. wishing to think other original ones.

you think that maybe, despite, those boys from brokeback mountain had the right idea. as far as affairs go.

"event","isn't it delicious when you meet a stereotype person, get to chatting, and find out something quirky?
yesterday, a patient was russian. russian as in grey square bushy beard.  russian as in vodka belly. russian as in florid round cheeks. and one eye. he had lost the other. ""where?"" 
and russian in telling long complex engaging stories. he was born in china, very poor, was playing on the rubbish dump when  he found an old kerosene glass lamp, except they weren't old then, they were modern, so he kept it and 'thought and thought  what to do with it' he decided it would be best fun to throw it against a plum tree, where it smashed and a shard of glass whipped into his eye. 
20 minute story.
i didnt ask about the fact he only had one leg as well.  i knew he had lost his leg right here in the hospital that week, no story there.
one other thing he said, among many, is having raised his kids all bilingual, so his youngest 'tiny tot' who is five doesn't know when she is speaking russian or english, just burbles away with a patchwork of both.  Mr B said his father had a proverb (chinese?russian?) that 'a another language is never a burden'.  
people tell you so much when you nurse them, its an honourable exchange."

"event","""Claire watches Mary close her eyes, the lids swollen red sore.  She takes a tissue and dips it in the water jug.  Claire silently wipes Mary's eyelids.  The scales in the corners require harsh rubs that belie the gentle intent she feels.  Claire recognises Mary's short tender breaths; she says ""Im going to get your pain medication, okay?"" A grateful blue gaze thanks her, a pause so often found in nursing, seldom in a paypacket.  She returns with chilled strawberry jam and opiates.""

""Mary declines dinner - she says she as no stomach, no bladder, no bowels.  Her tasteless tongue has stopped functioning yet is retained like a faithful labrador, dirty yellow lying in her dry mouth. Claire swallows spit in sympathy.""

there i find a town called aramac.  it was called marathon for a while. not long. it was one of those well known shearing towns for a while. but we white aussies dont do much inland anymore. 97% live coastal. i will find a town, and a hospital, and nurse there for a while.  

its a whitefella town.  they had their massacre of 26 aboriginals, and moved the rest away back in the day....i wonder will i meet any. i will be able to fossick for treasure which im looking so much forward to...i wonder if i will find an opal, emerald, saphire? i will be able to go to the site of the muttaburrasaurus...old dinosaur http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/dinosaurs/facts/Muttaburrasaurus/

old land. i can smell the red dirt from here. im so lucky. in a lucky country. john pilger tells me the original quote for that was that we are lucky because we are top people run by idiots we can ignore. it was always intended ironic.

A.  Nursed for Oxfam in the 70's.  This meant wearing a bhurka and smuggling aide to afghanistan under the noses of the russians.   This meant Africa and various 'Insurgents' who are now the legitamate govts of their own countries.  And now, to put us to shame, this intrepid english adventurer does rural placements, ""not in whitefella towns though"" and keeps the aide coming.  Truly inspirational, including her inital anthropology degree ""when i was young"", her current multiple PhD's, her teaching voice that speaks modest clarity to me as I stop all paperwork to listen and listen and listen and listen. Wow.

B. Nursing for 45 years. This means a double knee replacement and wearing a TENS machine for her back while she works...(micro electric pulses to muslces).  This means stories of when morphine was a tablet you heated up with sterile water on a sterile spoon.  This means a matrons voice which she uses to great effect to convince a brain injured patient to return to bed.  This means listen and listen and listen and listen.

Nurses like these, their stories.... Where are their medals, glory, fundings?  They themselves dont want celebrity, a different generation, where actions speak louder....listen listen listen."

Human here and now.
Everyone can do it / some choose it
Some become / more / some how.
Approach bodies as whole entities
Entangled ecosystems / true galaxies.
Commonsense then holds true,
What happens here / effects there
What effects me / effects you.
Nursing is the idea of causation
Made fundamental by molecules.
Earthern human / most part ocean.
Nursing is environmental protection.

So when all the bombs are dropt
   when the seas are risen
       by melted ice under gaseous skies
   when food becomes a problem
       local personal
   when fuel is devolved into 
       pedals and pedestrian and
       honourable equestrian
So when all the bureaucracies implode
   when governments dissolve to tribes
       by minute uprisings of
       common-law common-sense.

Then I will nurse. 
Nursing is an easy expression.

I will nurse the truths smuggled into our system now.
I will nurse the real pain
  with the real respect it earns.
I will nurse the slow thoughtful means of health.
I will nurse the creed of community participation.
I will nurse those who serve each other action naturally.
I will nurse the births 
  and deaths with dignity.

When all the apocalypses / have ellipsed the earth
in its eternal struggle,
I will nurse / as i breathe
the best of each to each survival."

My theories of parenting styles and personality types leading to these bowel problems.
Quiet research ive been doing - Ive found these patients to be interchangeable.
Like people with a mental dis-ease. Such similar personality traits, use of language.
In comparison to some cancers, where you get a mix of types, the bowel people run along the same lines.
Im sure natural medicines around the globe would uphold this idea of mine.
Plus easily a western problem, easily diagnosed, cure?
Be nice to your bowel and it will be nice to you.  Ignore its rumbles, its meant to talk to you.
Eat good food always, dont be picky, your guts can handle everything as long as its fresh.
Most of all, be nice to your stomach, please dont rap on and on and on about how 'delicate' it is.
Words are powerful, you spend forty years saying that and the lining of your body will swell, in self defense or self perpetuating truths. cure? move where they eat less without a choice.

I learn:  doctors can prescribe morphine and methadone at the same time (!!!!)
I learn: its a crazy sad system, leaving C with an IVC (needle direct to vein), so he can wander in and out of the ward, shooting up in between his operations and analgesics
I learn: its a crazy sad system which gives me (the agency nurse) to nurse this boy who is so lost he scratches a beard crawling with lice, its so sad i cant be there day in and day out to provide the sweet support he needs to even begin to overcome this beast thats got him.
They give this boy from nurse to nurse, as unclean, as unclaimed, as unredeemable.
I go to the ground floor to get him the meal he ordered when they bring him the wrong one, the one they thought 'would do' for him. 
I learn: its easy to make a young boy smile.

this weeks wards-

Infectious Diseases: Alice, 85, meningitis. i had been told to feed her, that she was not orientated to the time/day etc (MSQ4), that she needed 'full nursing care' a euphemism for treating an old person like a child.
I set up her liquid food tray and hand her the spoon, i had forgotten a napkin, i leave the room to get it, on my return she is taking her first mouthful, smiling at the taste. later i brush her false teeth. they had been in her mouth for so long there was black/green gunk dried on them. when she puts them back in, she smiles again. she sleeps. 

Psychiatric: Mathew, 22, paranoid schizophrenia. tells me and another nurse that another patient is eyeing him, fronting up, that he will have to go hit this other patient soon to put him in his place.  asks that we just watch, so we can verfiy this. i watch. he is right. A patient is staring at him constantly. corralling mates in corners to complain about mathew. i talk with mathew. youre paranoid, i say. but not about this guy. mathew stands tall. but, i say, why hit him, its so teenage. the man in mathew responds, he grins shamefacedly, says this is how we do things, we men. in here, i say, they dont see it that way, they will see paranoia. he says, i cant win can i. i have no reply.

i nursed a woman who was unprepared for her operation. she had no idea what the surgeons were going to do to her, and so couldn't sleep.  i mumble vague promises of thorough education in the morning, wondering why no one has told her her diagnosis. patient rights. ha.

i nursed a woman who was bleeding rectally, 86 years old and with an apology for the 'trouble' she was causing me, because it was night and i should be getting 'some rest'. two jugs of fresh bright blood later, the transfusion i sped up seemed to slide directly through her veins and out. her face, already soft white vulnerable, becomes a whiter shade of pale... she has no analgesic order, i call and wake the young irish doctor, who advises panadol. i give a heat pack as well, nurse initiated, ha. workers rights. dying rites.

i wonder about my rights. i understand a little that my proletariat position is necessary to you. but i wonder what life would be like with no money woes. 
perhaps i could think. create. learn.
until then i hold the hand of the dying and comfort the afraid, and say 'i understand' with a sincerity which transcends all semiotic dissection."

I will hear your tentative lines and not burn you down.  I will not blush when you trial a dirty story, but not support your sexist bullshit either.  
I am the school nurse. so also i got to help.  The guy in the kitchen who sliced the top side of his thumb off, into the meat! i couldnt eat it tonight, sliced and delish as it looked.  I wanted to yell out from the masters table ""anyone seen a bit o' thumb then?""!
but nope.

"event","and the poem wasnt even very good. darn, those emotional trainwrecks are terribly old fashioned.

anyhoo.

news of the night. night shift again. oncology again.  the ages of the cancer patients sends me to tears in the toilet.

blame the toxic environment, rather than me getting older!

seriously, the sixteen year old, learning guitar to serenade his favourite nurse. 

the thirty year old, waiting for his brothers bone marrow results to see if he be okay for transplant.

the fourty one year old, unfailingly polite even as his urodome fails and his bed is soaked in urine.

the standard mix of ""oldies"", getting aggressive chemo so their last months can be full of vomit and burning.

i plan my speech, as i jump the train with my bike, what i would say if the guards stopt me.

(it being a monday morning, and me not being s'posed to take the train citybound with a bycycle)

some speech about lifes precariousness.  something pompous no doubt.

but no one stops me, and i get on my bike for the short ride home, exhausted and delerious as only working through the night can do to a body.  no drugs equal this experience. i want to take my friends with me, i want them all to work in a ward, just for one night.  then maybe, maybe some understanding, some connection would be possible.
maybe i just need more nursing friends. to whom i can say, i had oncology last night, and need no further explanation.
maybe i can be happy with the connections i made last night in themselves. 
comfort and morphine, dignity and  maxalon.

g'nite."

"event","An interview by a reporter from our city newspaper.  Finally, I say, nodding sagely.  Finally, they have recognised my unique and erudite perspective on the intricacies of the healthcare system in said fair city.  Finally, I think, my voice gets into the scrum of contenders talking about a new report dealing with this healthcare system.
Nope.
Ive just been interviewed by a reporter from our city newspaper, asked my opinion on the healthcare services of our state; from the perspective of a consumer!
Yes, Ive just been interviewed as a sample, an example, a representative norm, a 'mentally ill person' in the 'community'.
Yes, I gave my opinion in my sage, unique and erudite fashion.  But i really had hoped it would be in response to questions about my appalling first novel, or my difficult radio play, or at the very least the obscure poetry prize i won.

No, we talked about how mental illness is polarised here: either you are acute needing hospital services and full govt funding, or you are on your own to find your own therapists for $80/hr, your own NGO support groups which meet in dingy community halls, you take yourself to emergency every four months for stiches or sedation, then you get back to work, 
because if you dont work you dont qualilfy for any govt assistance, and what you need isnt financial, its the CBT/DBT programs, or the therapists, or at least a careworker; but you dont qualify because you can work 2 or 3 days a week.  
and the rest of the time, you dont cause anyone any harm shellshocked sitting in your apartment, and when you do get the rage or the pain, you take a scapel and cut delicate symbols of ancient rituals on your thighs or belly as you have done since you were eleven which is gosh, eighteen years now, and no one needs avert their eyes from your scars because your not usually 'attention seeking', you really dont trouble anybody in anyway mostly.
  
So you survive, and fuck it, thats just the way things are, i dont really want to complain too much. im not getting shot at, or bombed, or starving, so fuck it, its survival, and i do my little bit of good nursing, and i try not to impact on the said 'community' and thats cool.  

but really.
I did want to be interviewed by a reporter for an achievement, not an abscence, of life."

"event","is it an aussie thing? the trachy vs the trache?  
anyways looking after him last night in neuro was tough.  not the trachy, only four or five suctions of not-too-bad secretions, dressing ok, only a swedish nose and a touch of O2.  
but he was sadly NFR.  fair enough, SAH (brain bleed) whilst in car leads to MVA (car crash) leads to GCS 3 (coma-ish) leads to NFR (not for resucitation if heart/lungs/brain stops).
but they (DR and family) still want full medication given through NGT (tube in nose to stomach)
they still want masses of food given thru this tube, enough so he will get fat yes.
and this will keep him alive long enough to develop pressure sores, and chest infections, and spend months maybe years getting turned from side-to-side-to-back every three hours, and getting sponged down once a day and basically being a little factory for basic bodily functions and site of family grief.
damn it, i wish we had euthanasia."

"event","oh and i had a lovely entry here: about transience.

and sweet lord above if it didnt just dissolve into stardust and cyberspace when i hit submit.

uncanny.

to recap:  i was ranting about submission to cultural bullshit like medication which advocates a cold withdrawl from the stuff of life. i took the pills for over a year, a humdrum kinda numb. i feel it wearing off like asbestos. i feel the tortured writer within picking at the old scabs and letting thin pain and thick sunshine trickle back in. i feel it now, when they rape my sistas. complacency and compliance are not 'appropriate' reactions to this. i feel it now when economic overloads and health professionals serve soma cookies at my teaparty.  rants and rages and my old kickass humanist beliefs are more 'true' nourishment. even if i choke on it. 

no more medication. if i feel, if i get sad, this too shall pass. achingly simple one small life in a universe sized world of transience just returning to stardust.

just: dont hurt the whole as you meteor through.

take care of your transience. it will take care of you."

not just for me, for the multitude.  and yet the endless fascination with self-expression....

i cant deny the products are asthetic inventive entertaining. but its the urge that will endlessly  puzzle  me. why art, why journals, why poems?
must reality be actualised before its recognised?
and recognition from whom?  if yourself, then why proclaim?

camus said we should live without appeal... i tentatively think that these 'things' are appeals, each to each.  call it communication, then its a fluid facillity, yet discourse is proven an object  itself, and so, well truthfully.  i think these objects bulky.

creating more obstacles between actual  human/spiritful intercourse.

true, i use touch.  therapuetic touch is the cornerstone of my profession, the drugs i dispense, the procedures undertaken, the rationality of my uniform:  splendid rituals around the central healing act of touch and silent contact of spirit.     none of which i personally can delinate in words, though some have done, as some have painted, as some have spoken, as some have danced, as some have played, as some have designed. 

and im not denigrating the attempt,  i just think more people should spend more time nursing each other.  its a part of our human contiuum that has been wrenched from us, the ages assunder, the kids in their instituitions, the sick violated by separation from community. 

try disaffected after ten hours with a dying/transitioning man, try joy after watching her sit herself up in the bed, try  wanting to be original after  seeing him  learn to breathe  again.
 
i get it,  i do.  i  mean i do it too.  but i understand its urges are part of the theme, not the whole damn song.  pretty enough, and im always glad to hum yours on my walk to work, just dont expect an anthem."

if your temperature rises above 38 degrees celcius, please come to ED.  in the emergency department, we insert a cannula, take your blood, take your urine, take your clothes and give you a gown.  we leave you and your wife in a room with no pictures and a really really bright overhead light.  your wife begs to be diagnosed with munchausens-by-proxy.  you dont talk, and only half sentences that she finishes for you.  forty-five years married.  your wife is worried about recalling your only son from his buisness trip to dig more oil out of western australia.  last time he went to the north, this happened, you in hospital,  trying to find out why youre sweating and shaking.

in ED we will take and take and give nothing back.  as you leave with no answers,  your wife will give me personally three numbers to contact you on, if i have any ideas, if i find any clues, to assuage this need for closure.  no one mentions your history of bowel cancer or luekemia or heartattack.  we smile beyond social convention,  as i slip you the cup of tea ive stolen from the staffroom to wet your whistle while you wait for the taxi home."

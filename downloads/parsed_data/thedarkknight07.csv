Then after that we went to Dicks sporting goods. Played tennis and then Dan nailed a tennis ball then ran the Miranda got mad at Dan for not going to get the tennis ball. Then we got back to my house and SURPRISE. A lot of people were there and we were kariokein( major sp) and ppl got in the hot tub and Kevins friends dumped me in the pool and my phone was in my pocket so it got wet and short circuted and now its dead so i get a new phone YAY.

"event","Well this past week was another BORING summer vacation week. I really diddn't do anything till Wednesday when me and Dan worked out asses off. We got 50 bucks for it so i guess it was worth it. On Thursday I had to do some more yard work. On Friday I went to the Carnival with Jennifer, Brett and Dan wasted A LOT of money there about 60 bucks. Later that day me and Dan went to the fireworks and Miranda called me and said to meet her by the entrance so we walked to the other side of the park to get her then she wanted a candy apple so we went a got one then the fireworks started so we said we had to go but she said she couldn't walk back alone so we walked all the way to her parents then all the way back to where we were sitting the fireworks were ok but they weren't great. Then on Saturday went back to the carnival and rode a few rides. It was fun. Today really diddnt do anything except sit in the hot tub =) I forgot to say I got a hot tub WOO HOO. Well that was my week."

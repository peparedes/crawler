He fired at them and killed one, possibly hitting another loser as well.<br /><br />Christopher Childress the loser who was rightfully shot in my honest opinion, is painted under a different light by his friends and family, They talk about him as if he was a good citizen and would never do such a thing, but the evidence shows that he broke in, And Ohio has a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Doctrine_in_the_United_States"">Castle Law</a> in effect.<br /><br />Now for the twist to the story <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.toledoonthemove.com/news/story.aspx?id=419993"">I just discovered while writing this</a>. It seems Mr. Joplin isn't so innocent himself, He had <span>marijuana in his home.

A third guy is still on the loose, I'm sure Michael Brown will rat him out in no time :)</span><br /><span><br />I suppose the only good that comes of this story is a bad guy is dead, Guns still save lives and despite his unlawful drug activities Mr. Joplin was justified in shooting these guys.

Realistically I don't even know how or where to start, But I'll give it a shot with <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/11/protester-with-gun-found_n_256614.html"">this.</a> A citizen of the United States of America exercizing his second amendment rights is singled out at a meeting where the anointed one was to speak on his health care reform agenda.

<lj-cut text=""Continue on!"">
If you watch the video you will see that the journalists are SHOCKED to learn that not only does this man have the balls to make good use of his rights but he's also doing so near a place that the president will be attending. Now I understand that anyone no matter how clean of a record they might have and regardless of how well dressed they may be, There would naturally be some concern in this situation. But for the journalist to first ask why a gun is present and then to go on and ponder why ""all the layers in New Hampshire"" can't suspend this man and everyone else's 2A rights for the day? I'm sure what he really means is why not forever...

As if that wasn't enough, the huffington post ran a second story later on with a video from MSNBC who interviewed the gentleman who was <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/11/chris-matthews-to-town-ha_n_256952.html"">carrying.</a>

Not only does this reporter berate the man over his constitional right and choice to open carry, He also talks over him most of the time and asks questions without giving him much of a chance to answer them. He also attempts to paint him as a ""birther"" early on, Anyone with half a brain can see he's picking the guy for <i>something</i> to make him look like a loony. He is unfortunatly unable to and continues on with his tirade against him. Chris Matthews even gets so upset with him that he curses him for ""bringing a god damn gun"".

I for one salute this man for standing out in the crowd, for taking a huge chance regardless of his constitutional rights and the rights he reserves as a citizen of NH. He handled himself well with Chris Matthews. Hopefully we see more great things involving him in the news soon!

<a href=""http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/08/police-spokesman-confirms-that-gun-was-dropped-at-dem-congresswomans-event.php"">full story found here.</a>

<i>""Yelling and screaming is counterproductive,"" she told the Sierra Vista Herald at a Congress on Your Corner event last week. There, one visitor dropped a gun at the meet n' greet held in a Douglas Safeway, her staff says.

That has aides, who called police to the event, concerned for her safety.

<b>""We have never felt the need before to notify law enforcement when we hold these events,"" said spokesman C.J. Karamargin.</i></b>

So someone dropped a firearm while at this meeting, Yet they didn't panic and go on a shooting spree. This leads me to firmly believe that it was a legal CCW/CHL permit holder who was probably bumped into or somehow managed to lose his carry piece. Poor judgement on his/her part for maintaining retention of their firearm in what was most likely a crowded room.

Although I could discuss much more on that matter I feel the need to point out the reporters other commentary. <i>""Yelling and screaming is counterproductive,"" she told the Sierra Vista Herald at a Congress on Your Corner event last week. There, one visitor dropped a gun at the meet n' greet held in a Douglas Safeway, her staff says.""</i> Nowhere in this story do they say that this person who dropped the firearm was hysterical or otherwise causing a problem, yet they link them to the counterproductivity these peddlers of the chosen one have been pushing.

<i>""That has aides, who called police to the event, concerned for her safety.""</i>

Why because someone dropped a gun? I bet they'd be surprised at just how many legal firearms are being brought to these events.

<i>""We have never felt the need before to notify law enforcement when we hold these events,"" said spokesman C.J. Karamargin.</i> Of course you haven't... your events have undoubtly always been attended by your ""constituents"" Also known as your loyal supporters.

Thats because you've never pushed so many American citizens against the wall before. People are pissed off and more and more they're taking action against what they believe is not right for our country.

Expect more and more concerned citizens to voice their opinions louder and louder in the coming days. Violence is not what anyone wants (the majority of us anyways) Yet we will stand firmly on what we believe, and we do NOT believe in obama and his ideals!

"event","Fast approaching 26 years of age, A new chapter in my life is beginning. My grandfather James A. Kelly served in the Army air corp. during WW2 as a rear gunner on a B-24 bomber, After the war he was in the motor pool. My brother and his wife are both currently enlisted in the USAF, They've both been to war and have returned safely.

I'm currently unemployed and the prospects of a halfway decent paying job in my area is slim. Ever since I was 18 in 2001 just months before 9/11 occured, I'd toyed with the thought of enlisting into the service. Why haven't I? Well... A lot of reasons. None of them really for me now that I think of it.

Family, My Mother is against it since she already has one son in. My Father feels the same I'm sure but he has not said one way or another. Then there's my friends and my strong ties to my current location. But what really keeps me from making that commitment? Fear, I'm scared to do it. But like any fear that I've felt in my life I worked my way through it and get things done.

A couple months ago I contacted an online chat recruiter for the Air national guard. He and I discussed some stuff and he took my info to pass onto an actual (local) recruiter who is supposed to contact me. Strangely I still have not recieved a call from them.

This weekend my brother, Dan and his wife, Sherry came into town to visit. I always enjoy their company, I feel very lucky to have a sister in law who I'd rather call my sister because of how well we get along. I've spoke with them about my plans of enlisting, Perhaps I'll go full time into a different brance of the service if I like it. But joining the A.N.G would be a great start since mainly what I'd like to learn more about and do is done at the Camp Perry which is located within 35 miles of me. The Red Horse Squadron which does civil engineering, builds & rebuilds bases everywhere.

The best part about what they do is the fact that they're very closely tied to the USAF and the deployments of them. So chances are if I got deployed and either/both Dan & Sherry did as well, I'd end up near or at the same place as them!

I guess what I'm getting at is because of my current situation and getting older I'm ready to do what feels right to do, That and I'm used to an expendable income. This unemployment thing sucks ass. My expendable income is about $50 a month right now. And realistically all of that should goo towards bills. But I firmly believe life is meant to be lived.. Not just getting through it.

So Happy Memorial Day! Thank your closest military member for what they do and no matter what realize that someone else has it worse than you do.
I'll leave you with a couple photos of our denny's adventure last night.

It seems in the first three months of this year we have bought enough firearms to arm both the Chinese and Indian army! Since obama won the election Americans have bought 6,871,120 firearms of all types. Now how much ammo has been bought, Thats another story. I would bet that the fine upstanding citizens who bought a new firearm in this period has at least some ammo for it. But I know as well as other gunners that the shelves are nearly empty or are empty just about everywhere you go looking for ammo.

However, Maybe that'll send the proper message to gun grabbers. We may still not be the majority... but he who holds the gun makes the rules!

I leave you with a picture of a Mosin Nagant that belongs to a friend of mine, I've been storing it for him while he had to move out of his apartment because the owner is getting foreclosed on. Fine battle rifle and packs a hell of a punch! Oh and ammo is still cheap and easy to find. ;-)

"event","Story from the washingtontimes.com

President Obama's pick to head the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration raises a few red flags. If confirmed by the Senate, Chuck Hurley, CEO of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, will drive motorists over the cliff with regulation.

The nation's traffic-safety czar has broad powers to control the roads and road-going habits of Americans. Mr. Hurley has a history of pushing laws that harass millions of law-abiding citizens to ensnare a few lawbreakers. He supports returning the 55 mph speed limit to our highways as well as roadblocks and random pullovers to make sure drivers aren't doing anything wrong. This methodology is based on a presumption of guilt - not innocence - of the average driver who is doing nothing wrong.
<lj-cut text=""rest of story"">
Mr. Hurley has promoted a mania of overregulation at MADD. Absent from his advocacies is the principle that a punishment should fit the crime, or that a crime even needs to be committed to incur a penalty. Under this influence, MADD has been lobbying to lower the allowable blood-alcohol content (BAC) for drivers to .04 - which means one glass of Pinot can land anyone behind bars. The constant lowering of BAC limits has separated what is punishable from what is actually dangerous.

As a result of MADD-fueled binges for tougher laws, extreme drunken driving punishments - such as loss of driving privileges, jail time, fines and legal fees beyond $10,000 - often apply to individuals who were not drunk and in some cases were not even driving. Last month, the Connecticut Supreme Court unanimously upheld a driving-under-the-influence conviction against a man who was sleeping off his bender in his car even though the keys were not in the ignition. In 2005, the North Carolina Court of Appeals upheld a DUI sentence for a tipsy man riding a motorized skateboard. The Georgia State Police charged a woman with drunken driving for riding a horse.

Such absurd cases will continue to proliferate as long as the breathalyzer machine is the sole determinant of guilt rather than evidence of unsafe conduct. Machines are prone to error, and basing guilt on a digital reading leaves little room for the specific facts of an individual situation. The same reliance on machines can be seen in Mr. Hurley's obsession with red-light and speed cameras. Mr. Hurley is a former board member of the National Campaign to Stop Red Light Running. The innocuous-sounding outfit frequently testifies at congressional hearings as if it were a nonprofit victim's advocacy group. In reality, it is a well-heeled lobbying shop for big business.

The so-called National Campaign's phone number - (202) 828-9100 - is answered by a receptionist at the public-relations firm Blakey and Agnew. Among that firm's big-ticket clients are the traffic-camera companies Redflex Traffic Systems of Australia, Gastometer BV of the Netherlands and Lasercraft Inc. of Britain. These foreign corporations all seek to rewrite state laws to allow machines to issue traffic-camera tickets, thus reaping huge profits for the companies that operate them - including Redflex, Gastometer and Lasercraft.

The position of NHTSA chief requires an administrator of sound judgment, not a zealot beholden to special interests. Mr. Hurley's associations and background raise the specter that he could use NHTSA regulations and safety grants to benefit his friends and coerce states into adopting his overbearing pet policies. For these reasons, we urge senators to reject this nomination. Mr. Hurley should be offered one for the road and sent on his way."

"event","The hostile crowd that confronted a lone Modesto police officer and his police dog early Sunday threw glass bottles at the officer, and one suspect punched him in the face, according to details released by police Tuesday.

Witnesses and police say some in the crowd taunted the officer as they closed in on him, shouting, ""Shoot me, shoot me!"" when he drew his weapon. Someone in the crowd said, ""You know you're not going to make it out of here,"" said Sgt. Brian Findlen, the police spokesman.

Some witnesses said the face-off was ""horrifying"" and ""like something you would see on 'Cops,' "" the TV show that showcases confrontations between police and criminals.

<lj-cut text=""Rest of story"">
Residents described their neighborhood as ""scary,"" especially after dark. Gang members and regular people live side by side, they said, and neighbors fear retaliation if they call police.

In Sunday's incident, the officer couldn't call for backup during the five to eight minutes he was alone with the crowd because the radio on his belt was broken during the struggle, said Findlen. About a dozen officers responded after 911 calls from neighbors.

The incident happened about 2:15 a.m. in the 1700 block of Pelton Avenue in southwest Modesto.

The officer happened upon the crowd while responding to a report of a stolen car. The officer stopped when he saw a group attacking one man. When he tried to break up the fight, the crowd turned on him, police say. One man challenged the officer to a fight. When the officer tried to arrest the man, some people pulled the man out of the officer's control, said Findlen. Three suspects were charged with ""lynching,"" a term for removing a suspect from police custody.

<b>A loaded assault rifle magazine was found later near the scene of the assault, said Findlen. During a follow-up investigation, police said, officers found a loaded, banned assault rifle. Callers to 911 earlier that night reported gang members were shooting a rifle into the air.</b>

Six people were arrested in connection with the struggle. Some suspects who contacted The Bee on Tuesday said police treated them unfairly, beating them and arresting them in connection with crimes they didn't commit. Police deny those accusations. Two witnesses said police did not use excessive force on the suspects.

Police say some in the crowd were gang members; three of the suspects told The Bee that they're not involved in gangs.

The officer and his dog were slightly injured, said Findlen. Reports from officers at the scene described the size of the crowd as 20 to 60 people.

Some in the crowd were listening to a police radio scanner, police say. When they heard other units were responding, they ran, Findlen said. One witness said others in the crowd tried to help the officer during the struggle.

Coverage of the incident, posted on the Drudge Report's Web site, struck a nerve, prompting online comments, phone calls and e-mails from across the country to The Bee. Some linked the confrontation to the recent shooting deaths of four Oakland police officers, which exposed a deep divide between police and residents there. Authorities say a parolee shot the Oakland officers. ""Where do people get this boldness?"" said Patrick Manion of Morro Bay. ""I want to go to Modesto and say, 'Who are you?' ""

Findlen said he didn't see the attack as evidence of a new level of hostility toward police. ""Are we seeing specific incidents or ties between incidents that lead us to believe that violence is shifting more aggressively to police officers?"" he asked. ""I don't think we have enough information to say something to that effect.""


I just love how not only were they caught with a banned ""assault rifle"" they also go ahead and claim police brutality. I wish the police we're a little more brutal upon groups of idiots like these. If you're gathered in a group on the streets at 2 in the morning, Chances are you're not up to any good.

Well, everyone but those lucky enough to be a member of the Pelosi-Reid Congress.

They gave themselves a raise last month.
They now make $174,000 a year for their 3 day work week.

The US may be in recession, but like the president, the members of Congress won't feel the pinch this year. The Pelosi-Reid Congress also gave each lawmaker an extra $93,000 in petty cash to spend this year. And now they just gave themselves an 11% increase in spending.
McClatchy reported:

Congress wants to boost spending on itself by nearly 11 percent this year, an increase that's part of a massive spending bill that has smaller increases for most agencies that deal with public health, education, energy, and other domestic needs.

The congressional budget, which the Senate is considering this week as part of a $410 billion fiscal 2009 spending bill, is higher than the 8 percent overall boost for most domestic programs. As a result, Congress now appears well on track to approve spending $4.4 billion on itself, up from $3.97 billion last year."

"event","Large stash of guns removed from Staten Island home...

Police pulled an arsenal of rifles, shotguns, handguns and ammo out of the Staten Island home of a 54-year-old man this morning, authorities said.

A small army of plainclothes and undercover police officers armed with a search warrant descended on the 864 Jewett Ave. home of Gary Granato, 54, this morning. Inside the Westerleigh residence, they found close to 80 firearms, and a hefty stash of ammo, authorities said.
<lj-cut text=""Rest of story"">
At this point, it's not clear why Granato had collected so many weapons, an NYPD spokesman said this afternoon. Police arrested him on weapons possession charges, but formal charges from District Attorney Daniel Donovan's office are still pending.

Several unmarked vehicles flanked the house this afternoon, while officers dressed mostly in plain clothes came and went. At about 1 p.m., they carried out five plastic crates of guns and ammo, at least two green metal ammunition boxes, at least four rifles, and a pump-action shotgun.

Despite the number of officers present, the gun operation appeared relatively low-key they stretched no yellow police tape outside, and for most of the morning, only a single marked police cruiser accompanied the unmarked cars.

<a href=""http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2009/03/large_stash_of_guns_removed_fr.html"">Full story with photos and comments.</a>

I'm not fully up on NY law but this seems to be a infringement of his 2A rights. From what I do know and a quick search on <a href=""http://www.ar15.com/forums/topic.html?b=8&f=9&t=307707"">ar15.com</a> tells me they have indeed infringed on his rights. Plus the audacity of the ""NYPD spokeperson"" to question his collection pisses me off.

I'm hoping theres some updates to the story soon. Mostly I'm hoping this guy is legal in every way so it's not yet another hit towards our 2A rights

"event","Among other things, the inauguration of President Barack Obama was ""the largest temporary toilet event in the history of the United States,"" an official of Don's Johns, the firm that provided most of them, said Wednesday.

Here's the mystery, however: Did it have to be? According to Conrad Harrell, vice president of Don's Johns in Chantilly, Va., most portables were about a quarter full Wednesday morning. Harrell had thought they'd be half full, as they are after most events.

Adam Carter, the operations manager for Alpine Portable Restrooms of Round Hill, Va., was puzzled, too. He said Wednesday that he'd ""found whole rolls of unused toilet paper in some.""

Here are the possibilities: The planners overestimated demand. The crowd was so dense that people couldn't get to them. The crowd chose to use Smithsonian museum restrooms, the better to escape temperatures in the 20s. Or the crowd thought ahead.

The evidence appears to support all those theories, and also to suggest a slight lack of enthusiasm.

Kristen Tortorici, 28, an accountant from Birmingham, Ala., for example, admitted that her experience with a portable toilet ""could have been worse.""

Harrell and Carter think that inaugural committee planners overestimated the crowd. Planners did, at any rate, pay the Smithsonian Institution $700,000 to open all its museums, including their bathrooms, to the public on Inauguration Day, and long lines of waiting customers trailed from the museums all day Tuesday.

There also were long lines at several McDonald's restaurants close to the National Mall, and at other restaurants.

""We bought doughnuts because they were checking receipts to use the bathroom,"" said Hanna Kim, 22, an exchange student from South Korea who's attending Montgomery College in Silver Spring, Md.

Other tactics required planning.

William Broker, grocery manager at the Giant supermarket in Bethesda, Md., said he'd noticed that sales of Depend, a common brand of adult diaper, rose 20 percent in the days leading up to Tuesday.

Several couples told him they were getting them to survive the dense mall crowd.

<b>""At an event like this, you really have to wear Depends,"" said Karen Johnson of Fredericksburg, Va., who isn't a fan of portable toilets. ""It's so nasty inside those things,"" she said.</b>

Carter, the Alpine operations manager, said that he loved his job but was saddened by customers' disdain. ""People just don't appreciate them,"" Carter said.

Seriously, people chose to wear depends and piss/shit in them and  feel their your own piss or shit against their body for who knows how long.

And also what disturbs me is that the store owner tracks the adult diaper sales so closely lol"

"event","Robert J. Newton of Toledo, passed away January 20th, 2009, at Swanton Valley Healthcare while under the care of Hospice of Northwest Ohio.


<lj-cut text=""Rest of obit beyond here""> Robert was one of five children of Eugene and Helen Newton. Robert was born at the family home March 27, 1924, on Leybourne Ave. As a young boy he sold newspapers on the Toledo streets and earned his membership at the downtown Toledo Boy's Club. His family pursued farm life on the Manore Rd. in Neapolis and also on their Genoa, Ohio farm. Bob acquired his can-do attitude from his father and older brother, Warren. He met his wife, Maxine ""Mickey"" in Neapolis in 1948 and knew immediately that she was ""the one for him"".

They were married in Whitehouse in 1950. In 1951 he, with the help of brothers and his Dad, built a family home in Whitehouse. Later in 1962 the family moved to Toledo. Bob and Mickey were avid dancers and knew how to ""cut a rug"". Bob was active for many years with the Peter Navarre Scouting district. Bob went on many camping and hiking trips with Troop 60. Bob was also influenced by his grandmother, Margaret Crockett Winover who was active in the union movement and encouraged him to pursue a career at Willys Overland (later Jeep). He worked from 1943 to 1984 starting as an ash shoveler and eventually acquired a boiler operators license.

He went on to boiler repair duties and eventually welding. Bob was an avid traveler and he and Mickey visited most of the lower 48 states during their travels. Bob also enjoyed working with his best friend, Al Davis on many different business ventures, as well as frequent fishing trips. Bob loved fishing and when no one else could reel them in, Bob always could. His fishing stories were numerous but one of his proudest was saving a small boy who had fallen from a breakwall and had to be hoisted out of the water. Bob also dramatically rescued his own son from the Whitehouse quarry when a very young Danny slid deep into the cold water. Bob dove 20 feet to the bottom, looked up and grabbed his son on the trip back to the surface.

Bob was active for most of his later years as a member of Salem United Methodist Church, where he was a former trustee and a member of the Pastor Parish Relations. He was also active in the church's outreach program and served as assistant usher. Robert also volunteered his services as the church's repairman. He was a good example of a man trying to do the right thing.

Bob was preceded in death by his parents; his brother Gordon, and his sister, Margaret. He is survived by his brother, Warren (Ila); sister, Jean, his wife Maxine; sons, David (Diana), Danny (Jamie); his grandchildren, Christie (Chad) Henderly, Rachel Newton, Danny W. (Sherry) Newton, Adam (Andi) Newton, Joseph Fuleky, and great-grandchildren, Rowan, Mayson, Maddilynn, and Gabbriella.

Visitation for friends and relatives will be held on Friday, January 23, 2009 from 2-9 p.m. at the Witzler-Shank Funeral Home located at 701 North Main St. in Walbridge, Ohio. (419-666-3121) where services will be held on Saturday at 10:00 a.m. Robert will be laid to rest at the Willow Cemetery in Oregon, Ohio. Those planning an expression of sympathy are asked to consider Salem United Methodist Church. 602 Federal St.. Toledo, Ohio 43605 or Hospice of Northwest Ohio. Condolences for the family may be made at www.witzlershank.com

Yes, My grandfather saved my dads life, I've been told the story a time or two... My dad says that while fishing at the quarry his father told him to be careful on the rocks or he might fall in... What do kids do? Not listen :) And since my father hadn't learned to swim yet my grandfather had to jump in after him.

What the obit won't mention is that my grandfather had a bit of a wild streak in him, He had a motorcycle for a while, smoked a pipe (and cigarettes) for a few years. And once when my dad was about 17-18 and had one of his 1960's muscle cars he decided to take it out on the interstate and give it a ""little"" gas While doing so he passed my grandfather who seen him speeding, so whats he do? He speeds too trying to catch up. Well when he finally did I guess he flagged my dad down and first thing he said to him was ""I don't know how fast you we're doing but I had my speedometer pegged at 120 and I still couldn't catch up"" LOL

I remember as a kid on Sundays my brother and I would get dressed for church and go with our grandparents. When the collection plate was passed around he'd take our .50 cents and give us a dollar to put in.

While my grandfather only had a 9th. grade education he was very smart when it came to his work. My friends were amazed at his garage. The tools he's fabricated and his grinding wheel setup, and other aspects of his personal work environment.

Him and his stories will be missed."

"event","<i>President Barack Obama's new administration ordered all federal agencies and departments on Tuesday to stop any pending regulations until they can be reviewed by incoming staff, halting last-minute Bush orders in their tracks.

""This afternoon, White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel signed a memorandum sent to all agencies and departments to stop all pending regulations until a legal and policy review can be conducted by the Obama administration,"" the White House said in a statement issued just hours after Obama took office.

The review is a tool commonly used by a new administration to delay so-called ""midnight regulations"" put in place by a former president between the election and Inauguration Day.

Midnight regulations have been heavily used by recent former presidents, including the Democrat Bill Clinton, Republican George H. W. Bush, and most recently, the Republican George W. Bush.

<b>Controversial late rules by the outgoing Bush administration include allowing the carrying of concealed weapons in some national parks and prohibiting medical facilities from receiving federal money for discriminating against doctors and nurses who refuse to assist with abortions or dispense contraceptives based on religious grounds.</b>

Federal law requires a 60-day waiting period before any major regulatory changes become law, so some presidents try to publish new major regulations to ensure they go into effect before the new president's inauguration on January 20.</i>

Funny how they specifically mention our newest pro gun law concerning CCW in national parks. It also mentions the federal funding for the anti abortion doctors. Goin on barack's stance on abortion (which I'm all for that right) and his views on gun rights, I""ll be looking forward to what action they take on both issues."

Armed officers raid home, hold mom, kids for 6 hours
Health department cops allege licensing issues over food co-op Jacqueline and John Stowers, An Ohio family whose members have served their friends and neighbors with food cooperative services involving bulk and discount supplies has been targeted in a raid by armed law enforcement officers wearing black fatigues who forcibly rounded up the mom and 10 children and held them for six hours.

<lj-cut text=""Rest of the story"">
The raid prompted a complaint filed today on behalf of the family by the Center for Constitutional Law at the Buckeye Institute. It alleges authorities &quot;made a haphazard unannounced entry into the property with guns drawn, as other officers surrounded the property, with guns drawn,&quot; then &quot;confiscated the family's personal food supply, personal computers, and personal cell phones.&quot;

The complaint names the Ohio Department of Agriculture, the Lorain County General Health District and the state's attorney general. A spokeswoman at the Department of Agriculture said its officers were at the scene in an advisory role. A spokeswoman at the county health agency refused to comment except to explain it was a &quot;licensing&quot; issue regarding the family's Manna Storehouse.

An prosecutor assigned to handle the case declined to respond to WND requests for a comment.

It's not the first such case of authorities invading a home over issues involving the operations of food co-ops. WND reported several months ago when authorities in Pennsylvania demanded $4,000 in fines from a farmer who provided raw milk to friends and neighbors.

That case also was highlighted by a SWAT team-like raid on Mark Nolt's farm, when government agents confiscated tens of thousands of dollars worth of his products as well as pieces of machinery he used for his milk handling and sales.

John and Jacqueline Stowers, whose Ohio home was raided, explained their work in providing affordable, healthy foods to friends and neighbors in a video posted both on YouTube and on the Buckeye Institute's website.

<lj-embed id=""26""/>

In the video, Jacqueline Stowers describes how she first started ordering bulk health foods for her own family, and gradually other families asked if they, also, could gain access to the food sources.

Then, about a year ago, the family had a conversation with county officials about licensing. The family asked questions but heard nothing further until the armed raid Dec. 1.

&quot;We had a sheriff's department group of about 11-12, I don't know, 13 men come into our home. It was violent, it was belligerent, they didn't identify themselves,&quot; she stated.

She and 10 children were forcibly herded into a room and held there for at least six hours, she said.

&quot;In the meantime we had people with guns inside and outside,&quot; she said.

The Buckeye Institute's Maurice Thompson said he took legal action in Lorain County Court of Common Pleas because of alleged violations of the Stowers' constitutional rights.

&quot;The use of these police state tactics on a peaceful family is simply unacceptable,&quot; said Buckeye Institute President David Hansen. &quot;Officers rushed into the Stowers' home with guns drawn and held the family &ndash; including 10 young children &ndash; captive for six hours. This outrageous case of bureaucratic overreach must be addressed.&quot;

The Buckeye Institute argues the core issue &ndash; the right to buy food directly from local farmers, distribute locally-grown food to neighbors and pool resources to purchase food in bulk &ndash; are rights that do not require a license.

&quot;The Stowers' constitutional rights were violated over grass-fed cattle, free-range chickens and pesticide-free produce,&quot; said Thompson, the institute's Center of Constitutional Law director. &quot;Ohioans do not need a government permission slip to run a family farm and co-op, and should not be subjected to raids when they do not have one. This legal action will ensure the ODA understands and respects Ohioans' rights.&quot;

The institute said licensure law enforcement is one thing, raids are another.

&quot;The Buckeye Institute seeks an injunction against similar future raids, and a declaration that such licensure laws are unconstitutional as applied the Stowers and individuals like them,&quot; the institute said. &quot;There has never been a complaint filed against Manna Storehouse or the Stowers related to the quality or healthfulness of the food distributed through the co-op.&quot;

&quot;Agents began rifling through all of the family's possessions, a task that lasted hours and resulted in a complete upheaval of every private area in the home. Many items were taken that were not listed on the search warrant. The family was not permitted a phone call, and they were not told what crime they were being charged with. They were not read their rights. Over ten thousand dollars worth of food was taken, including the family's personal stock of food for the coming year,&quot; said one.

The complaint notes Manna Storehouse deals with wheat, flour, sugar, grass-fed beef, lamb, turkey and eggs from free range chickens, mostly coming from local farmers. The raid was based on an affidavit from Ohio Department of Agriculture agent William Lesho that &quot;makes numerous conclusory and unsubstantiated claims,&quot; the complaint said.

The complaint states:

The affidavit does not indicate that the Stowers are dangerous.

The affidavit does not indicate &hellip; exigent circumstances &hellip; that would warrant using force.

The police knocked on the door, and Katie Stowers opened.

Police shoved Katie to the side and immediately entered the residence without first announcing (1) that they are police; or (2) the purpose of the visit.

During the raid, at least one, if not several police entered the home with guns drawn, and the Stowers home was surrounded by police who also had guns drawn.

Once having obtained entry&hellip; the lead officer &hellip; with his gun drawn, swiftly and immediately moved to the upstairs of the home, where he found eight small children.&quot;

The officer used physical force to get Jacqueline Stowers and her children down the stairs.

The officers held the Stowers family captive in their living room for in excess of six hours.
The complaint raises issues of unlawful search and seizure, taking of private property, due process and unlawful application of police power."

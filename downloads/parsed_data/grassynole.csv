"event","So you know my last entry...well i should start wishing for stuff in livejournal more often because this week has kicked serious ass!!!  it started with me and J starting to talk again.  i hadn't talked to him in a while and out of the blue he messages me and just like that we pick back up where we left off....that's what i love about him, josh, and chris.  i could not see them for years and we might meet on the street and nothing would have changed!! anyway, we start talking and flirting and stuff and the next thing you know he's telling me that he loves me and always had and that i stole his heart and that he'smoving back to the us this summer and wants to see if we might get back together!!!!  MADE MY LIFE!!!  it made me the happiest person on earth.  even if things don't work out, the fact that he loves me and always will just puts a smile on my face.  i love him so much...more than just a first love type thing...it's a real love thing.  kind of a scary thought...that he might be THE ONE.  that i might be one of those people that ends up with one person for the rest of their lives.  but i've thought about it and it doesn't worry me when i think of spending my life with him....unlike how i felt about others that i have loved.

so basically that is great.

on tuesday i went to the Texas State marching band contest.  it was ORGASMIC!!!  seriously...if you really want to know about just ask me cause it's too nerdy even for live journal.  on top of all of this soo much has gotten done in the costume shop and we might actually finish!!! yeah!!

ok, i'm tired so this is a good night.  

smile'n hardcore now!!"

"event","so this day has been really wierd.  i mean i've been happy all day and in gerneal in a really good mood.  then suddenly tonight it dropped.  i mean i'm happy...but i'm also nervous for some reason.  

i messaged those that will be called B&B and apologized for any problems that i caused and asked that all this stupid awkwardness be ended.  now i don't really think that i have anything to apologize for and i think this is why i am uneasy, but i figured that for anything to be acomplished someone had to say that they were wrong...and i'm not going to hold my breath for you know who to say he was wrong....he's never wrong in his mind.  so i feel i've cheapened myself in a way.  but i guess we all have to make sacrifices every once in a while to make things better.  

why are boys so stupid....why can't J come back....why can't I find someone that's just nice and sweet and not so bitchy and full of problems....it's things like this that make me think that i shouldn't have come to baylor.  but then i think of all the good things that have happened and i'm glad i've stayed.  R seems nice, and he's fun to be around...maybe i'll ask him out...i'll wait a week though before i do anything to make sure it isn't just a rebound type thing 'cause that's one of the worst relationships you could ever be in.

I guess overall I'm happy and things are going well but I'm lonely and wish I had someone to spend the night with...nothing special...just someone to hold me or my hand every once in a while.  wow, haha, this entry was supposed to be a happy one and it's taken a serious turn.  but remember that i am happy!!  and i'm smile'n!!  love ya"

"event","Wow it's strange writing on this thing.  I mean with facebook allowing you to connect with people that you need to every second of the day, cause everyone is addicted and checks their facebook all the time, there really isn't a need for writting in an online journal anymore.  

I was reading my last entries....such happ times...the best summer of my life!!!!  some of the things i wrote made me smile, and some made me cry(seriously i began to tear up).  i wish i could relive that summer just once...

so an update to all me LJ friends...that is if you even still have a live journal.  I have lost another boy.  This one was strange...i mean we didn't work well together, we argued a bunch, we looked kinda strange next to each other...yet i loved him.  now it's been a month and he's moved on with another boy but yet for some bizzarre reason i still have some feelings for him....it really sucks because there really wasn't many good things about us. anyways it's over and i shouldn't think about it.

my last entries were focused around high school graduation and looking forward to college.  well fast forward because i
m getting ready to move into the real world.  for those that haven't heard i'm at Baylor studying costume design and construction and i'm planning on going to grad school after undergrad and eventually working in the theatre in NYC or Boston.  BIG PLANS!!!  hope they happen.  

ok,that's enough for you LJ.  ENJOY READING THIS AMY!!!  oh yah!! i heard something....not going to tell you what...but all i can say is judgement was everywhere...even in my raccoon wounds.  PEACE!

"event","hi everyone!! sorry it's been so long...but i've been really busy!  i love it at Baylor, though it is a bit conservative.  the theatre department is NOT however.  it's great and everyone's so nice and i have so much fun with everything!  even band is fun, but it takes up a bunch of time.  oh well... i'm making new friends but i haven't forgot ANYONE at home!  i do miss you guys though.  but life moves on.  enjoy clements...HAHA, hang in there, college is a blast!  but that's what everyone tells you.  the key is to get involved with things that you LIKE!  not what you think will make your parents happy.  Waco isn't too bad either.  we make our own fun and things are just fine.  now i will tlak to Jeremy so if you are anyone else you can stop reading.  i love and miss all of you and i'll try to see you guys when i come home to visit!! take care!!



ok, so i know that everyone will read this anyways so there's no point in writting just to Him.  in case any of you didn't know, i'm dating, a couple with, and now promised to Jeremy Williamson.  i love him.  he's great!! and the best thing that ever happened to me.  right now we are working on a long distance thing.  it's hard and most of the time very frustrating, especially since his parents aren't very accepting of certain issues.  but in anycase we are doing great!  he's depressed and i'm optomistic so it balances out.  i'm NOT going to leave him...serously, in Waco there isn't like i have a large group to tempt me....  and if everything goes well, which i don't see why not, i really can see myself spending the rest of my life with him.  now a bunch of you are goign to think i'm crazy or think that 2 guys is gross...but too bad! this is my journal and i TOLD you not to read this part so it's your fault.  i love youu Jeremy..in case my e-mails haven't gone through... and i'll wait for you!  love Everyone and i miss you all terribly! have a great fall semester!!!  i'll see you when i can.  Bye to all!"

hey everyone!  so..yah, as you can see, this is jeremy and he's made me sooo happy!! as most of you know...  but yes, i had yet to introduce him to my journal so this is it.  i really do care for him, he's great! i haven't beent his happy in a while, Josh can justify that.  i don't know, maybe i shouldn't be so bold with this...but i want to.  i'll probably get caught though....

but you know...i've been thinking aobut it and i really think that my parents know and just aren't saying anything yet.  in anycase i really think they'll find out sometime soon...and that scares me...

over all, things are going great for me!! i have a great guy, great friends, a great job, and i'm going to a great school!  i'm really excited about the idea of starting over and and not being scared of being myself.  i'm not looking forward to leaving you guys though.  i'm really going to miss most of you...especially Josh and Leah...

...geez, you 2 have been there for me always and i love you guys.  i tell y'all everything, more than i tell my real family.  in my eyes, you two ARE my family!!  i wish i could describe more, but i think i said it all in the cards...

i'm also, though it's selfish,, am going to miss Jeremy... i know i know, we just started dating and all, but...i don't know...it's different than with other guys i've dated...in anycase we are going to try for making it til christmas, so wish us luck!! and thanks for everyone's support so far...this all makes me sad to think about...

but i really am happy!! trust me!!!

I've been in almost every river there now i think, not to mention all stores in the outlet malls in San Marcus...they're having their sales... over all it was great!!  I got to meet new people, drink a little.... it's not all that it's cracked up to be... work on my ""tan""  and of course spend time with Leah....i think we're set for a few weeks.....

but i can't think about that right now....something's happened,  I don't know what it is....i haven't felt this way in a while....i feel sick, but in a good way, and i sucks that it's coming at the end of the summer....but what's weird is that it came so sudden;y...but finally...

"event","hey yo! so the month of june is over, and what a month it has been!!! i've goten t do sooo much and it's been a blast.

first off, i wanna give a BIG thanks to Deepak and Josh. guys, if it warn't for you, i'd have been so bored these past few weeks.  and stevie!! thanks soo much for letting me hang out with you guys and driving us aroundlate at night.  

that's pretty much what i'e been doing...hanging out with good friends and having a blast!!! i did go to pride....it was fun, but i wish i were 21 and could stay for a while, but no worries.

it's decided, i'm going to Baylor!!  studying theatre!! and i have 14 hours next semester, not bad at all.  

ok, as many of you have noticed, i've been a bit more open about myself, and for a while it was really awesome!!  i had no worries and really no problems and i felt more relieved and confident than i ever have before....but now that's kidda past.  i mean, it's stillnice and comfortable, but i'm scared people are grouping me as another gay guy and more importantly I don't like ow i've been acting more.... feminie i guess.  now i know some of you gys are like ""huh?!! he could be WAY more girlie.""  but i don't want to.  i don't want to be treated differently.  i don't want to be girlie, i don't want to be a stereotype.....grrrr...

ok, that's enough thoughtful stuff.  you don't really need to worry about that whole thing, it was mainly for me, it's nice seeing your thoughts ""written"" down.  

as usual thanks for reading you guys!! hope your summer has gone well too and happy forth of july!!!....see ya!

I see it more as a celebration of life and the freedoms that each person has to choose his or her own lifestyle. So get out there whether you're bi, straight, gay, lesbian, curious, transvestite, or trangender and live your life!!!

ok, enough on that...so...i'm officially a college kid.....  whooty freak'n doo....

graduation day came and left and so did pro-grad....the casino was fun, and the palm reader and hypnotist were really good... but i'm not a big ""lock in"" person....

overall...i'm kinda sad...i've made sooooo many friends recently that i REALLY don't want to leave yet.   i'm finally getting close to these guys and i have to go away to college...it sucks....but i do have the summer i guess!!!  yes yes...SUMMER!!!!

oh man, i'm so excited..why?...i'm not really sure, but it shall be fun!!! one last hurray before i go to Baylor i guess.  

ok, that's about it....OH WAIT!!!!  now THESE are some wonderful pictures...the explanation is Chris...that's all, so enjoy!!!

fri: band UIL,got to miss a day of school and got all 1's...big deal.......that night, 80's night...with Stevie!!!!  sooo mondo cool beans!!!  he danced and everything!!  him, Josh and I had such a great time...one of the best i've had there...just good friends having fun and dancing!!!

sat: work day in the morning, i got to paint a picture...people were all oggling over it, i thought it was ok but nothing special...then it was off to Courtney's house to swim!!!  i know i know, i NEVER swim but i did!!!  we had a blast...in the end the group wound up being me, stevie, courntey, zach, hillary and deepak....even more super cool beans!!!  we got coffee, talked, solved life's problems....ok not really, but we did spend a long time finding a movie and riding around in Stevie's trunk....wow, now that's a ride.....    we also got pizza, the movie was okay..about a really stupid black boy and a crazy inestuous white family...it was kinda sorta scary at times, but mostly a typical cheesy horror movie....

and that was my day...well...days... they were sooo much fun!!! and now here am i talking to my computer.....being a loser and conforming like everyone else to confide in a live journal...which i learned people actually read.....haha......so i guess a bunch of you know my little secret...haha...awsome!!   thankyou and goodnight...ummm...morning....

   basically last week was really fun and kinda pointless because i only  had to go to 1 day of school...band has become rather crazy

         I""M SORRY STEVIE FOR MISSING SO MUCH!!!

so this past weekend was the band trip, and it was sooooo much fun!!  sooo much happened...well...not really, but it makes it seem more interesting that way..

   i have decided that the best way to explain my weekend is with pictures....yeah!! pictures!!!

on a deeper level....i don't think people should deny who they are...i know i'm exactly the epidemy of pride, but i don't exactly deny what i am.  if someone asks me i'll tell them, but it isn't really their business.  however i have a few friends... more like one particular friend.... that really refuses to admitt what he is or even was....and that bugs me....you shouldn't be ashamed about yourself....

ok ok, enough of that crazy thoughtful stuff...this week is crazy and next week is crazy and i love everything that's happening!!!  especailly with the decisions i've made recently......i think i'm almost over it

OOHH!!!!  i think i've decided on a college..didn't get the big scholarship from ACU, which i'm kinda happy about, but not my parents..oh well, it's my life! 

   LOVE EVERYONE!!!!

so friday of course it was off to numbers after making sure my parents were gone...but wait, they aren't gone!!!  not only are they at the house, but sitting downstairs talking to my sister my her boyfriend!!!  so i can't exactly walk out in my ....ummm... present attire so i pulled the little middle schooler rutine and wore some kinda baggy clothes over them....they quickly came off in the car...then i went to pick up our specail guest....PRIYA!!! she had to do the same as me, she complimented my on my outfit and we were off..
     it was sooo much fun...ok , so it was a little boring for me....god damn hair...but priya loved it and amanda and josh and gus and erica were there!!!  and i LOVE seeing them!!!  i think priya likes me, but i'm not sure.....you'd think she'd figure it out by me bringing her to NUMBERS in MONTROSE and wearing TIGHT CLOTHING and DANCING not in a christian manner, not to mention my verbal knowledge of gays.....honey, i love you to death but seriously!!!  think about it!!!.....

haha, i just realized that i just like came out to EVERYONE..but oh well, it's not like i'm ashamed....guess if you didn't know you do now, haha, but most people that read this already know...but don't say anything at school guys, it could seriously hurt me....thanks

so saturday and sunday i'll sum up.....went to a church tournement doing puppets and signing...i got gold medals...had dinner with the family....screw the family, i hung out with leah!!!

monday i went to a show, very cool beans!!! Stevie thought i said something bad to him when he messed up and he flicked me off....ouch...but i told him it was ok, he's a great director!!

    I""M SORRY STEVIE FOR ALL THE TROUBLE I CAUSE !!!!!! KILL BAND!!!!

tuesday was devoted to english....enough said...

the rest of this week has been useless...one day of real school!!!  HEY we took senior class picture and guess who's sitting on the front row...ME!!! it's awesome!!! 

OH!! i cut my hair....it's wonderful!!!! and short!!! and....well, fits my personality better, haha

"event","...yah...so my title pretty much explains all the important stuff that's been going on with me...

   first off, as most of you konw i was really really sick last weekend and earlier this week....it's PHARNGITIS....but suddenly, it like totally disappeared or something...yah, wierd, and now i have to take this strange pink medicine to keep it from coming back...THANKS MR.KISER!!!

    second is the play i'm in.  YAH!! i got casted!!!  i was sooo happy!!! especially since it's Stevie B.'s play, which only has 2 characters which means a big part...and it's Stevie, duh!!!  h'es a super cool beans guy, really nice to me, and i find him funny..well.. light-hearted most of the time.....but the play he chose is very serious....the ONLY serious play in fact,  and that kinda took me by surprise.  but it's a really really good play and i actually like!!  i was just shocked Stevie chose a serious play....hmmm

     third....the directors suddenly don't like me, well one of them doesn't.  HE thinks i have a bad attitude, that i think i'm ""the deal""...now, it normally wouldn't bother me if HE didn't like me too much, but he told this to LEAH, who tells me EVERYTHING (almost), and he did it BEHIND MY BACK!!!! WHILE I WAS HOME SICK!!!!  i thought those guys liked me...plus, it's kinda wierd for a teacher to complain to a student about another student...

     forth...again i still like him, but i don't know why....it's obvious he'll never like me again....but why not?!!!  i'm not sure why i'm still caught up in that boy, but i'll just say this...if he asked me back tomorrow, i'd drop everything and drive to where ever he was in a heart beat!!!

    ok ok, and lastly...if that's a word....i'm confused why when my sister lived here my parents wuld wait up for her or at least my daddy would sleep on the couch so he knew when she got in...yet now that i'm the oldest in the house they really don't care i guess.  i just got home at around 3 in the morning!!! and not a single person is up...not a single person noticed or will notice what time i got home....i guess that's kinda cool beans dude!!!

and that is why i'm dumbfounded!!!.....yah..."

"event","ok, so after my rather depressing past entry, like...wow...you guys are sooo mondo oober cool beans.  it's nice to know that i gots some good friends!!!  i'm not depressed anymore...at least i don't think so.  haha.  went to number's with joah, nick and AMANDA, yes yes AMANDA were there too!!!  i freaked out!!! i got to teach her how to dance, and she's pretty good!! (don't ware heels next time though sweety)  it was sooo much fun....some people were drunk...not sure hw i feel about that.  today i went to speech UIL, you know, the one i've been all excited about....well... i didn't get past prelims....that really sucked, because the judge said it was because of my voice. 
     As most of you have probably noticed, my voice has been kinda strange lately...it's my throat...it's alll swollen.  Leah's mom looked at it today after i told her i had bumps on the back of my head (swollen liph-nodes)  she thinks i have an acute case of tonselitis or something....crap, not cool beans.....but it feels much better than it did friday!!!  ok ok, so in conclusion...thanks guys for being concerned and i'm much happier right now!!!!  LOVE YOU GUYS!!!


OH YAH!!! i got to see Leah play with P1!!!! awesome job girl!!you are a super star!!!"

"event","So, i'm not sure what's going on right now.  I go to school everyday, and by the time i get home i'm not sure if i even went, i don't remember anything that i ""learned"" apart from practicing with leah.  i haven't done ANY homework, all of which are projects due this next week.  I'm trying out for one acts...yah, not sure if the band schubule is clear for that.  i'm trying to get someone that i can't have.  I think i'm getting sick... at least my voice is going.  The sad thing is that i don't really care anymore....but i cared a lot last week and i think that's what has worn me out.  But i'm trying to be happy, and energetic, because , as Zach Lamb said ""being depressed sucks""...but i'm not sure what he's depressed about....hmmmm...yah, ok, well...i guess feel free to read this and not answer as usual......


.....y'all could at least say hi every once in a while...i'll even write you back!!!   but i fear my pleads are in vain....i still love you guys i guess...

I started off being kinda nervous, i mean, 'd never beent here before, didn't know anyone, AND i had an audition for the Theatre program. so..this is what happened

Savannah is the PRETTIEST city/town that i have ever been in in my entire life!!!  the pictures at the bottom only give you a glimpse...but..wow like don't even begin to sow it's true beauty...i LOVE it.   every one, and i mean everyone is sooo nice!!! i even talked to a girl from houston!!! she was really nice and had red hair too!!  my audition was great, i met a bunch more people all sooo great!! they all act just like me...it was scary...mommy was all ""these are your type of people Carl, this is where they all hide."".....haha mommy....OH!!! i got accepted!!! into the college AND the theatre program AND i'm up for a media and performing arts scholarship!!! i'm soooo happy!!!  my parents might actually let me go!!!  OOHHHH!!!! and the funnest part of the entire weekend was the Ghost Tour

So we have some family friends that live in Florida so they drove to Savannah to see me!! ME!!! anyways, Saturday night we went on a Ghost tour..'cause Savannah is the most haunted city in the US, sooo cool beans....it was kinda creepy walking around these old houses late late at night hearing about how all these people died in these abscure deaths, but it was sooo much fun!!! i love SAVANNAH!!!!

ok...other things on my mind....1. the directors are all on edge because Leah and i (mostly leah) and ""acting strange""...basically acting mad and like we don't care..which we don't..so that's funny...2.UIL is this weekend and i'm kinda nervous, but my pieces are rally funny and i'll probably be presenting then to my friends throughout the week..so be prepared!!! i finally get to hang out with speech guys again!!!...3. i shouldn't mention this...but...i still like you, still never got over you, and now this happens...crap....what to do...i'd try harder if there could be another chance...4. finally, one act play auditions are on thursday!!! WOOT!!!! i've been looking foward to these all this crazy long year..""God i hope i make it""...that's from A Chorus Line for all you unknowing people...but seriously it's sooo much fun!!! and i am getting nervous about it

"event","well ladies and....well, i don't know if any straight guy look at this besides Erik...anyways, today i leave to Savannah.  I audition tomorrow so wish me luck!!  I'm looking at SCAD (an art school) and this is my first and maybe only visit....i'm scared.  so that's what i get to do this weekend.

     I'm sooooo upset i can't stay here...my friends are not only going to Number's tonight, but they are also finishing season 3 of Queer as Folk, only the best show ever!!!   It's not their fault at all, i'm just sad i can't be with them...I LOVE YOU GUYS!!!!!  Instead i get to spend the weekend with my mommy...yeah.....

   now, I love my mommy, she's a great lady!! but i spent my whole spring break with her, seen her all week, and now am about to spend this weekend with her....i'm mommied out!  she just constantly worries about things and decides to tell me what she's worried about which akes me worried and mad and overall not fun to be around....i don't know, i just need a small break to go with my friends and do stuff that we want to do...she's also been in a bad mood this week...

    Mr. Siak (band techer) has been in a bad mood too!! he yelled at us today, i mean hardcore yelled!!!  and almost everything he said was not true.  it made me mad because i put soo much of my time into band and then he stands up there and tells us that we don't care about it!!!  leah and i might quit...it's just not worth it...and i understand that he has family issues right now AND that someone tried to burn down the school by starting a fire in a practice room, but it's this entire year that has been a reason to quit...i'm not sure what to do...

oh well, apart from being mad, nervous, and a bit loopy from my head ache medicine...i'm GREAT!!!! I hope everyone has a great weekend and i'll see you all sunday morning (we got an early flight back to Houston)---BYE!!!"

"event","hi there!!! it's me, your favorite little red head!!!  so, this weekend has been..interesting.  Saturday was great!! well it ended great.  in the morning my mom and i drove back to Houston from Abiline where i had auditioned and head scholarship interviews, and the whole way back my mommy is doing her fake happy act, which really irritates me.  now i love my mommy, but she pretends that everything is ok, but it's not....mommy, face the facts, i can't keep lying to you....  and while we're on that topic

 ...i still like you, maybe even love...grrrrrrr....come back to the dark side dude!!!!  it's fun!!! and that's my reason for staying....i wish you had told me what was going on, but that's all over and there's nothing that i can do....which makes me sad, kinda, in a way...

ok, sorry about that, so Saturday night...well afternoon i call up josh and am like ""Hey yo!!! i just got back in town!! what is there going on?!!!""  and he's all ""Hey Carol!!! you KNOW what's going on, now get you ass over to Allison's before the episode's over!!!""     DAMN RIGHT!!!!!  it was, for lack of a better word, FABULOUS!!!  then we (me, josh, stevie, allison, amanda, brian, depok, bryne, jonny, jasmine, sam-boy, and will) went to depok's house to watch a few more episodes...soooo good.....then we went to play volley ball where daren, courtney, and mike and this girk named jessica i think joined us...i want to be on PFLAG!!!! then it was off to Sonic for food and chalk...then a park...then driving around with stevie, depok, and josh!!!    WHY CAN""T WE ALL BE 18 SO WE CAN GO TO BARS OR CLUBS!!!!  oh well, i love you depok and josh!!! your day will come...

today, sunday, was ok.   Nick is back so it was Josh and Nick day, but luckly Leah came home!!!  we hung out for a while, and then there was puppets....BOOOOOO...and then back to Leah's, but------UHOH!!!!-------my tire blows out, not cool beans, but i got to be all manly and stuff and change my tire, check and fill the pressure in all my tires, check and add the oil, and fill up the gas!!!!  haha, and while i was doing all this, i thought of something i thought was funny:
      FIXING A CAR:
straight- pro-gain knowledge about machines and look really hot for some girl to look at you and think you'd be a pretty good provider
          con-get all dirty and smelly..which no one wants, and risk the chance of making yourself look stupid

gay-     pro-get to watch some really hot, muscluar guy fix your car, getting all sweaty and stuff, plus your car gets fixed AND you get to flirt with him by being all hospitible
         con- .....what con? you stay clean AND you get to watch a hot guy!!  unless it's some fat ugly guy....ewwwwe!!!

ok, sorry about that, i just thought it was funny!!!  BOOO!!! school starts tomorrow and i haven't done any homework...so i'm going to go do that ok?!!!!


HEY!!! WHY DON""T YOU PEOPLE COMMENT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE!!!!  bye guys :)"

"event","hey! hry! HEY!! YOU THERE!! guess what time it is...that's right 2:30 in the morning!!! haha you are all asleep, and i could brake into your houses right now if i wanted to....but i won't, 'cause i like you guys.  so late at night is when i think i talk and think rather out of the box so here is my influencial entry so you can just deal with it!!

  1:Restraunt Bathrooms- ok so i don't understand why those bathroom doors swing in and you have to pull to get out.  if you are going into a bathroom most likey you are not concerned with germs and might even be entering to get rid of those vermin.  thus you wouldn't mind putting your hand on a dirty handle infested with God knows what...but the bathroom door people decide to torture us.  so oyu have done your business and go wash your hands, hopefully, and are now ready to vacate the room with your clensed self, but then you notice that your exit is blocked by a grotesque handle, probably converned with infestations for the barbarians that don't believe in personal hygine.  you are then faced with 3 options; put you hand in your shirt to open the door and risk embarressment, stand there and wait for someone to come into the bathroom (which could be a while), or open the door with your hand and infect your once clean hands thus nulifying your original perpus.  none of these are good choices.  so why not just have te doors push to get out!!?  another point is that what if there was a fire and you needed to leave quickly, a push-to-exit door would be more effective!!

  2:Gay Marriage/Pride-  i have nothing against gay marriage or homosexuals in general, but i'm getting really bothered by their behavior lately.  they are pushing themselves and their lifestyle down the thoats of everyone!! it's ok to have pride in your lifestyle and to want people to accept you, but the truth of the matter is that not everyone will.  Why is that? it's because humans are naturally hostile to things that are different from what each person had grown up with. there are going to be people that will never agree with you and might put you down...well you know what, get the hell over it!!!  you can't make someone like you, they'll just dislike you even more-so.  now on the topic of marriages...dudes, you can't win!!!  the gay population, though it is growing, is not big enough to support gay marriages.  the only way that it will become legal is if the supreme court decides homosexuality is a minority group, and personally i don't want to be a minority.  every legal doquement you'd ever fill out, or test, or even job reference thingy would have on there that you are gay.  it would never change!!  it would be like a brand.  but it will never be made a minority because it is not a race of people.  it is a lifestyle of a grop of people.  overall, they should just give up and be content with what you've got...i mean at least wait a few more years, you just got sodomy legal, you can't get every equal right at the same time!!!

  3:Your Middle Toe- which one IS your middle toe? is it the 3rd toe, or the one that is in the middle of your foot and it is most likely longer than all the other toes, save you big toe.  i believe you middle toe is really the second toe; the one in the middle of your foot and is the longest..IT's YOUR MIDDLE TOE!!!


ok, those are just some things that i thought about today...by kids!! have a great springbreak and wish me luck on my interviews and auditions!!!"

"event","ok, so this spring break...YAH SPRING BREAK!!! is starting off just perfectly.... first on Friday...

        I didn't do a single thing all day at school, after school i went and volenteered helping my friend Joanna...such a sweet girl...with her gold leaf project  (girl scouts for you oblivious people), then my brother and I actually got along for the afternoon, i went and hung out with Leah and Maggie....soooo precious!!!! i hope we don't corrupt her...... and then it was off with Erica and Josh to 80's night.....wow..

    so we all look soo cute and i'm all scared for Erica because she's still broken, so i kinda pal around with her the entire night...also because Agustus hooked up with this guy and so Josh and the guy's best friend became best friends suddenly and Erica and I were like ""uh, what are we supposed to do?""....but it was ok because we soon had a group of people and danced like crazy, even salsaed together!!! (though Erica was in pain the entire time, she's such a great sport)...overall i had sooo much fun dancing, though i didn't see anyone i new, but made a few new friends....

Now for Saturday.......slept

       ........that's right i slept until almost 12, theni woke up and slept on the couch for a little while, then around 5 i met Allison, Amanda and Josh at the mall,  we were such middle-schoolers!!!  soo much fun and reminded us of how stupid we were..are....WERE!!!  We then pocceeded to my house where we indulged in candy, sodas, Taco Bell, and Queer as Folk...

 OH MAN!!!!! Queer as Folk is sooo good, like wow, ok so i like love it now, yah, like Mikey!!! wow, and Bryan and Justin...awe so cute.  but yah, ok so it's basically Dawson's Creek but a bit more grown up and about gay guys....sooo great!! thanks Josh.....  ""PFLAG!!!! EVERYONE!""  haha, oh man, wow, ok, dude, like it brings up soo many issues....speaking of which, i'm preparing an entry that will be on the issue of Gay marriage...stay tuned

but yah, Amanda and Allison..i love you...seriously!!! you guys...gals....are great!!! and soo much fun to be around, and i'm sorry Stevie if you felt uncomfortable, you're a great sport (he came for a little bit but i think he felt weird watching basically gay porn with a plot)  but in anycase, thanks for letting me hang out with you guys...means a whole bunch!!! And of course i love you Josh, friends forever!!!

...so i've come to the conclusion that you shuld be proud of what you are..whatever that is...and of your talents, but that doesn't mean that you have to flaunt it...there is a difference.  I don't think you should through things in people's faces when they feel uncofortable....but that's my opinion..what's your's!!!??

...and I'm spent!"

YEAH!!  my friend and i have worked things out and started over...thanks to anyone that helped!!  as of right now i'm sooo great it's not even funny.  this week, though slow, has been actually kinda fun....spending most of it with Leah or Josh of course.  Stayed at Leah's house until 12 last night...wow...that was crazy


....do you ever have that strange urge to do something...well...strange?!   well that was last night, with me randomly becoming part of the talent show.... 
              THAT""S RIGHT I GET IN FOR FREE!!!
....and then going outside to dance like some nsame person!!!  soo much fun, you must try it.....on cars, around cars, infront of people, behind people...  HEY NOW!!!  haha, just kidding guys...


...you know i really don't think people read this....so why does one keep a journal that reveals all of this kinda important stuff about ones life if no one will ever read it but one's self........     the seems to be that one hopes for another one to find and become better friends with one....making two.....

    seriously though i'm feeling so much better, like wow, ok, so i got my suit in!!!! and (insert curse word used to descride something indescribable) it's sooo mondo cool beans!!!     PIN STRIPE THAT'S RIGHT!!!!      the lady at the store thought i was like 16 and buying it to go on a date or something.....yah....not too many of those planned....

OH MAN!! Leah i going insane, but in a good way.  She's inviting people to have dinner with us, and when i say people i mean Maggie Bear....oh man, so cute that Maggie, she just brightens everyone's day!!!   I told Leah we should invite more, cause there are a few more people that are on our ""want to get to know you better"" list....are YOU on it??  I'll tell you someone who is...HILARY!!! oh man...ok...so she is so great....i have found my project friend, but we are already friends thus why she is on the ""want to get to know you better"" list.  Serously, if she wasn't taken and i was interested in her in a more than friends kind of way...which i'm not....i'd so try to snatch her up before someone else!!!   but what you must understand...you nonexistant people you....is that Leah and i just want these people as friends because they are super cool peole that make us happy just being around!


WOW, it's amazing how much nothingness you can write about, bt it's late so i shall make myself scarce and.....yah i'll see you guys at school i guess.....and remember that saying hi to a band person is not a crime!!!"

"event","Wow, i'm loving this week so far....ok, parts of it, but overall Monday was great!!!  school was..well school, until band where we laughed at our drumline performance (it was really bad yet we won 1st) and that put me in a better mood.  I got to hangout/talk with all of the theatre kids/guys/gals/people (they are sooooo mondo cool beans) and Allison and Stevie B. said they loved me!!! which brings me to this!!

anyways....after that, Leah and I went to Fuddruckers and got on a sugar high.  We proceeded to kidnap our friend Sarah and dance liek crazy people outside the band hall with miss Jenny Westbrook, only the BEST Wendy ""Peter Pan"" has ever seen!!! After drumline....BOO....Leah and I continued our rampage and visited Zach and Denise....you guys are great sports..... which consisted of playing James Brown really loud and dancing in front of their houses until they came out, it was fun.  To top off the day, we went swimming and my mommy and I had a nice talk...something everyone should have once in a while.  Dudes!!! I love all of you..especially you!!!  that's right, you right there!!! you know I'm talking to YOU!!!!  ok ok, enough of that, i'll see you cats later, i just thought I'd tell y'all about my day...which was great!!!"

"event","ok, so i'm sorry i don't update all the time...but you know i do have a life outside of this journal, so there.  Like that sugguests i've been soooo busy it's been crazy!!  The important things are that Peter Pan ended (sad), drumline is about to end (happy), i had my college theatre auditions (scared), i have super cool amazing friends that i get to hang out with (excited), and i have my money once again (just cool beans).  This week has been nerve-racking and difficult, but it's over!!!  I'm getting back to my semi- ""heartless"" self, so a few of you will be happy to know that.  You know, I don't know what I'd do without Josh and Leah...i can tell them anything and they're there for me!!!  I love you guys sooo much!!! oh man...just thanks guys.  

OH!!! The Passion!!! what doy ou guys think of it, i'm seeing it this week but i want to know what you think about it.  I think it's an awesome idea and a great profession of faith.  Lately i've become more religious for some reason.  It's been sooo great!!!  I finally have some friends that i can talk to about God and his love for us and they don't try to question it.  I don't understand why they question it though....I mean, if someone sacrificed himself for me, which Jesus did, I wouldn't care what it was for... i mean, that is the biggest form of love ever!!!  He loves you guys...remember that, even if you question it, he loves you.


Now for a lighter side......Did yo know that ""Dr. Pepper"" is so called because during the 50's, doctors said that during the hours of 10 in the morning, 2 in the afternoon, and 4 in the afternoon people were the most tired, and you could pep yourself up by drinking soda with pure sugar cane sugar in it.... thus Dr. Pepper was made in Dublin, Texas...cool beans huh?

ok, that's enough, time to be busy again!"

Too many things have happened over the past...well...month or so tht I can't even begin to tell you guys, but I can tell you the majorthings.  (deap breath)  thanksgiving was great I ate way too much and got to see all of my family and my cousin's new girlfriend who is kinda wierd cause she's obsessed with video games but so is my cousin so they are a perfect match but still i don't know what he sees in her but hey it's his choice not mine.  (Deap breath)  I've been applying to colleges lately and literally I think I'm starting a bit late 'cause all of my friends already have thier acceptence letters like my friend Eric wo just got into George Washington which i guess is a really good school 'cause his parents through him a party but in anycase i'm up for this big scholarship for full tuition to this private school and i have a chance of getting it but i'm really scared anyways!  (deap breath)  i tried out for our school play...well it's a musical not a play and there is a difference which many people fail to realize but we're doing Peter Pan and it was between me and this other guy named David Coade for the part of Peter but he got it but it's ok because i don't have the voice for that part and i still get a big roll 'cause i get to be John the middle child with the glasses and the top hat and nightgown and i get to fly and spend lots of time with theatre kids so i'm really excited it will be soo much fun especially with Josh!!



i thought your eyes might need a break...

"event","ok, sorry i haven't posted in a while but i've been pretty busy between band, friends, and having a life.  RECAP!! this week was awesome!! It started with my mom and little bro leaving town for the entire week.  I got to do whatever i wanted!! I worked a little and got paid for it and hung out with daddy.  Tuesday found me with an armfull of trouble, as ERik and I had a field day with Leah's night of sluttery.  In the process She got mad for some reason, but in true Leah fashion, her anger melted and we enjoyed a fabulous night at Magic Island the following night.  I went to Corpus and found myself bored to tears, but i left the next morning, just in time for Carl/Leah bonding day!! We went to Spring/woodlands and went shopping, flirted with guys and met up with this guy named Tim (the mallet god) and we all enjoyed a night of pool.  This is all in lu of going to numbers though (P.S. Hi Marvin, got your call but your little brother intercepted and then my phone died). Saturday was Carl/Josh bonding day.  We also went to the woodland's Mall and marveled about how cool beans their mall is.  I got to see Josh get ready, something noone is allowed to see.  Leah met us for lunch at Fridays and I discovered that I am a recluse and that i will suffer from mental depression!! YEAH!  Finally it was back to Leah's for an episode of ""Queer Eye for the Straight Girl""  she's sooo pretty...now.  HEHE, but then i had to leave to babysit.  The little guys were tired so it was fun and now i have money!!!  That brings us up to today.... where i am in a boxers doing nothing!!! i love it, and all of you!!! Have a great week guys!

"event","OMG!!! so, i thought this friday (today) would be boring...boy was i wrong.  It started easy enough....i woke up late but got to school early prepared for a useless day because it was senior skip day and...i was not skipping.  Anyways, my first 2 classes were extremely dull...4 people in my government class!!!!(so we all got free hundreds and retake our tests with partners AND books!)  so 4th period(studyhall) comes and i go to the band hall as i usually do, only this time to find my friend Joanna standing around.  She informs me that she is skipping (shock!! since Joanna is one of the good kids).  Leah comes along and says that she asn't even gone to her classes...so we all leave school and eat at Chili's where Leah finally gets to pick on me.  We go to Leah's house only to find....her mom, who quickly gives us a talk'n-to and sends us back to school for band.  It was fun though, we played Christmas Festival (YOU SUCK BRASS!!!) After school i went shopping with Josh!

Now for the night!!! It was the night to end all nights of the past!!!  Josh came over and we dressed ourselves in cute yet a bit slutty outfits and then went to #'s (a club in montrose) stopping on the way at Jamba Juice.  So we get there and not much is happening....then we met some really friendly girls.  They were oober nice.  Then things really took of....Chris (from Katy) stopped by to see US!!!....Marvin (my long lost love)  suddenly appeared and we picked up like old friends!!....i met all these cool beans people....Erica Agustus and Crystal show up and we danced the night away!!!! I danced with sooooo many hot people...they love me.hehe.  it was awsome!! the music was great, the peopole were great, and i got a goodnight kiss from someone (sshhh it's a secret)  and to top off the night, i got myself some Taco Bell AND my sister is home from college!!!!   I LOVE MY LIFE!

        I have been on 2 dates with someone, it's a secret who and then we had a tiff, caused by me being grumpy one day and writing a hateful e-mail (i'm really sorry!!), my friends are so awsome, leah and i are married (not literally), marching has ended!!! i'm a smarty pants 'cause i made all A's, and....i cleaned my room today and it looks beautiful.  so there, i hope you are happy leah darling.

"event","let's start off with friday:  i had to go to a football game...and that's it.  It was kinda boring cause our team is really bad, but willowridge's band is so fun to watch, that most people didn't notice.  A bunch of my friends that are in college now came and 2 of them told me i had to come and stay with them some week or weekend!! that would be awesome!!!(one of them goes to Columbia in NY)  i also got to meet this really nice deaf boy (i know sign language)  so that was cool.  While i was doing all of this, my friends were out living it up at Number's 80's night, grrrrrrrrr.  I haven't been in so long, but in 2 weeks i can go again and dance it up!!!!  Now for Saturday:  i had a band competition.....it was hot and humid and miserable in the morning, but we made it to finals!!!  We ate at this mexican buffet which didn't sound good, but it was!! that night it got cold and we had the best performance we've ever had!!! we ended up winning 3rd place out of like 20 bands!!!  This is good news for you guys too cause that means you no longer have to read about marching band.  we got home at 2:30 so i've been tired all day sunday.  

Now for random stuff:  My friend is obsessed with my friend with benefits at the moment.  She thinks that i don't like him and think she's silly to like him, but this is not true.  I just like giving her a hard time about it.  He is a really nice guy (though a little too enthusiastic about band) and overall i approve.  I give her a hard time because everytime i what to talk about who i like she tries to change the subject, which isn't fair, why should i listen to her then?  But yah, i hvae a crush, but it's more than a crush, i think we might go out and that would be sooooo spiffy cool.... . . . .  .  .   .    .hmmmmm, just thinking ::smile::...it's cold!!! i love it!! i'm learning to crochet a scarf to wear!! well, this is long so bye bye!

"event","So... today was like totally boring, i could have skipped (which is bad) ALL of my classes and nothing would've happened.  I laugh at my nonschool busy life.  So i decided to fill out college apps..  I also found out that i was chosen to be in a talent contest in 2 weeks!!  My friend Leah and i are doing 2 marimba duets and we could win!!! wish us oodles of luck!!


I'm sooooooooooooo excited!!! i found my mommy's super spiffy digital camera and decided to take a few pics so you guys can learn a little about me, as a person!! Now i only have 1 so far, but there will be more to come, i'm just learning though so let's hope this works! hehe

"event","ok, so i'm in the school band.  now don't think that i'm some stupid band nerd 'cause i'm not!! (i'm drumcaptain so there).  NEways, so we have this rehearsal that's 2 1/2 hrs. long!! and our drum major (the one that just flops her arms around) is AWEFUL!!!  no no, she super sucks and she can't keep a steady tempo.  I was about to yell at her today, but i'm too nice cause it would be rude.  OK, enough band.  Thanks to all you guys that welcomed me into the LJ world, y'all are super swell, and i mean hard core neato!!!(i like using old ""cool"" phrases and words)

             ""Cookies are best when you eat them infront of hungry people!"" love ya!!!"

"event","Hi there!!!  Here I am, after weeks and weeks of nagginf friends (whom I love with all my heart) I have my very own Live Journal!!! So, you're probably like Woopty freak'n Doo, but I'm like ...PIZZOW!!!  As you can tell I'm kinda colorful (in more ways than one).  I like to enjoy life...well not all the time, sometimes one must loathe life and lust after to sinful, but at the moment I am happy.  My weekend was ok, I had band compitions and church all weekend.  Now, that doesn't mean that I'm some goodie goodie, cause i'm not (ask droolmuch).  I go clubing and dance with the best of them.  Thanks to all you guys that taught me and who got me to get a Live Journal.. I LOVE YOU ALL.  Now it is time for me to hate life and do homework...  WHORES DON'T GET A SECOND CHANCE!!!  haha, yah right!"

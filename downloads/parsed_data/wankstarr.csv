Havent done too much interesting stuff lately, just hangingh out with friends BSin and stuff...i havent drank for a while, so thats pretty good i guess....it actually would be cool to drink in like, a social environment, but, Im not 21 after all...so aybe i should cool it and wait a few years and it will be that much sweeter when i get to it. Hangin at bars sounds pretty fun.

Anyways...so, theres a girl. I sorta have been interested in her for a while, but it just never went anywhere....i suppose i could chalk it up to me not trying to hard...but i just havent had the ambition to chase her. I really hope <i>something</i> transpires....but i really dont know the move to make, as i cant risk making it awkard, by just maybe telling her about it.

On the other hand...when you say dumb shit, there CAN be repercussions...i could be royally pissed, and be thinking, ""im not gonna judge people? what the fuck is that supposed to mean...? next time i see that kid im strokin him....Period.""&nbsp;You gotta think before you SAY shit...just these two things : A) Will this get back to the person im talking about? and B)How will they react if it does? Apparently dude, you didnt think before you spoke... Im not going to say EITHER way how Im feeling....but...it could be either way. So before you say ANYTHING...EVER again...since you have no CLUE how its gonna end...ask yourself a third... C)you willin to risk it, cowboy?

"event","what the fuck...? Read the PSA. Enjoy the PSA. Find applications for yourself in the PSA. But DO NOT misread the PSA. If you think something applies to you, then either your right, wrong, or have a guilty conscience. You decide. But dont assume stuff....really.


But yeah....new shit goin on? Nah....was drinkin last night, so that was cool. Me and Tilka are 'Drankin' Patnaz'. So we been gettin liquored up, and thats fun. My parents are stressing me out though, they seem to think that I have a drinking problem....so, i dunno how thats gonna play out. We have a friend of the family whos a substance abuse counselor, so I agreed to talk to him. I mean, <i>I</i> dont think i have a drinking problem....but what drunks really know that theyre drunks... Ha! So, aside from that im just kinda takin everything a day at a time.... Oh, but check this out...I found my college admissions letter that i sent out  en masse :
<lj-cut text=""(i think i may have been drunk)""> Where is the instruction manual? What is the next step? As I walk the path called growth, decisions and dilemmas attack me. Where do I want to be in the next 5 years? The honest truth; I don't know. Year after year, students are asked what they want, and where they want to be. Listening to them, you hear a multitude of answers. Some have great aspirations to start their own business, while some work to tune their skills in the fine arts and see where they end up. I have never had an answer. When the topic came up, I was the nervous 'kid' in the back, slinking down in his seat.

No concise plans, and no staged goals. To an onlooker, success wouldn't appear to be high on my list of priorities. I, however, possess what I think is the most important of the values needed to succeed; ambition. As of now I may not know exactly what I want to do with life. I may not have chosen a career path, and I may not have worked religiously to better myself. Maybe by my seemingly negative view of myself and my life, people think that I may not be intelligent, or I may not be willing to work for what I want. Immaturity kept me from excelling when necessary, not ability. Spending an entire summer not working, and literally doing nothing but watching my friends and peers prepare to move on in life, sparked an ember. Everyone around me bettering themselves, was like gasoline, turning that ember, into a roaring fire. That fire is what drives me now to apply all of my effort into moving now, before it actually is too late. 

I may be a student who didnt have the top GPA in school, and I may not have taken advantage of my natural abilites, or any of the oppurtunities offered me early on in life. I may not have struggled in life with money, or asserted myself as much as I should. I might've skipped writing goals, and taking career aptitude tests. I don't know where I want to be in 5 years, 3 years, or even next month. Only two things that I do know, one is that no matter where this letter takes me, I won't be holding back. The other; I don't care where I go, the only stipulation is that im growing when i get there.

Im thinking about finding an additional job, as I haven't been getting many hours. I really enjoy working there. Most of the people have been really cool.

Once i get my streetbike (god willin'), Im just gonna GO! Like, hop on I-5...or...99 and just ride. Until I find a place, where everything is perfect, and its all gonna work out like i want it to. I think its an extreme waste of time to commit to people and activities that i no longer am interested in...Washington, and the surrounding areas....just kind of blow. I know some things are only as good as you make them...but i mean, this state just hasnt worked out for me in the past 18 years. I dont feel that i owe it anything. 

Life is a wakin up next to a beautiful girl, beign happy. ITs that first paycheck from the first few weeks of your career. its gettin grounded for bad grades. Its stayin up hella late on christmas eve, to wait for santa, and his punk ass not showin...Life is not synonymous with exsistence.  Exsistence is the physical counterpart to life - the physical representation of what life isnt. I just feel done with exsistence...Im missing life...its all monotony...and it pretty much sucks.

<b>THIS IS A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT</b>
To everyone who talks shit, and then runs when the beef comes, to all the girls who get WORKED over and 'dont wanna look like hoes', to all the guys out there that think theyre badasses, and to anybody else that needs to know, let me give  you a little piece of advice...just a little piece.
SHUT THE FUCK UP. Period. Nobody cares that you dont like the RX7, nobody cares that i fuck fat chicks as a hobby, nobody cares that I fucked you after knowing you for an hour or two, nobody cares how cool your car is, or how much abercrombie/ecko/AE/Triple 5/Gap that you wear...no body gives a fuck. Especially me. Come to me with your drama, and ill say...""i dont care"" Come to me with your beef, and ill say"" i dont care"" then punch you in the mouth.Come to me talking about fat chicks, ill say ""i dont care"", punch you in the mouth, then fuck your girl. Bottom line, everyone has rights, but there is no right to be doin gay shit, or saying gay shit, so just cut that bullshit out.

Other than all that, im doin good,maybe ill post a little more later...until then

cheers and godspeed

*edit*

just got home. Man, i went all the way over to Travis' and his ass wasnt home. Fucking jew. Its ok though...man, so whats new? Im gonna be hella bored, i dont work today or tomorrow...and i dont have anything to do around here. But fuck, theres gotta be soem activities. Oh yeah, last night, i didnt do much, nothing cool happened at the gathering, then me and tilka went over to Anas room, and she talked on the phone for the whole time, while i finished watchin finding nemo. LOL, its kinda funny, because last night when we started it, this girl NIkki was in the room, and Steven was all mad that she was like, intruding. From what i gather....so was Ana? I wasnt too much, because i wanna bone that girl, oh, and the other girl thats in there somwhere, i dont remember her name. That college is GAY! There arent many chicks, no drinking, no keggers or anything, and just like...nothin to do. No Kara's to fuck or nothin. 

im abotu to head out apparently, something came up. So, adieu."

Actually, hasnt been down, but ive been playing SOCOM II online, and i cant have the PC and the PS2 hooked up together, so i just ditch AIM, LJ, and all the nerdiness that follows. WEll...updat, still like workin where I work, and i especially like the girls there.  Right now, I just got done drinkin two forties, and im not even that faded, just sorta buzzin.... so thats cool....didnt lose my self control on lent, just kinda got tired of missing out on good oppurtunities to chill...still no food of the fast variety though. So yeah, chillin. Just kinda doing my own thing, Gina left. WE were drinking for a bit, and before that, I almost got into a fight with a friend. Im not sure how that worked out though, somethin just set me off all crazy. As far as that, who knows...and who really fuckin cares. Me and gina went back to my place and conntinued to drink teh FORTIES. Then she had to leave, cuz she had to drive, which is cool. I think Gina is the only attractive girl ive ever been around without wanting to fuck em. I mean, dont get me wrong, id work gina over 6 ways to wednesday...but, id rather just cruise around in her truck...or my retired rx7...you know, shes that kinda cool. So, thats my mood now,curious, as to why all the girls that are actually worht the time, make better friends...thats how it always seems....

This girl at work Danyelle is hella cool, im attracted to her hella, so I think ill see where that goes. Its kinda odd though, because normally, i dotn really look at girls for more than a quick lay of the pipe, but danyelle is dateable. Ill see what happens, probably nothin, shes not out of my league or anything, just kind of, well, i dunno how to explain it. Gorgeous...funny...smart(?)...and she likes to drink beer. BAM! Shes in...sounds like gina! Hmm...well, im off to hit the proverbial hay, after a few games of SOCOM...

Oh yeah, i decided that im gettin; a new tattoo...a custom built computer for FFXI, A new piercing....(uh oh)...and im gettin a gym membership to lift weigts with Steven. Well...

<i>Man I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurrre
The concept of school seems so securrre
Sophmore three yearrrs aint picked a careerrr
She like fuck it, I'll just stay down herre and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus (a Lexus)
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well
Man I promise, I'm so self conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this!
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the american dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coop/coupe

I say fuck the police, thats how I treat em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shortys hollering ""where the ballas' at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack
And a white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon act holier than thou
Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spending before I get it
We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit it </i>

Yeah...and to you...miss fanciful...i hope you understand what it means to me to see another so insightful! I like how Kanye west addresses not beign able to leave the house wthout soem fresh kicks, and a hot throwback. It speaks to me, as I am the same, in my inability to be comfortable without my comfortable AE or AF sweatshirt...and a hat or two... I just dont get it. Must be because of the McDonaldization of america...(read fast food nation)"

"event","Finally, released from the trappings of xanga...the lesser blog. As of right now, nothing interesting is going on in life. I do have employment, however, and thats working out nicely. Interesting....It has come to my attention, that my writing style is intriguing to a select few people out there. I dare not say names...however, I dwell on the fact that i was drawn to post in a peculiar manner. The simple facts are, that i am guilty of the sin of immaturity. I wish from the bottom of my embarrassment soaked heart, that i was not the offender in this situation, as an intriguing person was disconcerted by my off-kilter behavior. The statements against ""The Schools"" athletci department were both accurate, and warranted; while the statements regarding skin tone and other ridiculous factors, were based more on anger, possibly jealousy, and more importantly..a feeling of rejection. Eh, it happens to the best of us...yet my cockiness and comfort in the female persona, has been disrupted, making me lash out in strange and abrasive ways. Maybe the rejection was so blatant, because of the uniquity of the situation with this particular lady, who i believe to be the first to intrigue me in a non-sexual matter....

eh well...im off to enjoy the night...somehow...chatting, drinking, I cant say for sure...i apologize from the bottom of my bitter heart!

Oh yes, and horny is a cool mood....the mood thing pwnz xanga, and everythign about xanga sucks....so yeah...gay!

A thought - What compels me to wear the Abercrombie sweatshirt, or the Gap sandals...?surely not to impress females. What compels me to want a streetbike...? I dotn liek speed that much, and its dangeroud... oddly, what compels me to do anything...i do not know."

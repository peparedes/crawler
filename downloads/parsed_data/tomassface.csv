"event","I don't get it. People seem to hate me so much. I guess it's because I'm such a loner and I don't talk to people. WHY MUST EVERYONE HAT ME? Sometimes I wish I could just kill myself... I just end up crying and crying until I pass out... the only problem is, well... I have a disfigurement where my face is actually an ass.. so when I cry... it's like... liquid... erm... and sometimes, when I really cry hard... a little.. erm... nugget comes out... it really drives people away, which makes me cry even more, so its a vicious cycle.... BOOOHOOOHOOOO*PHHHHHHHHHHHHTTT*.... ewwwwwww."

"event","Feel you heart race, feel your blood run
An ancient place b'neath an endless sun
The heat engulfs the air you breath
And your soul will never want to leave

The endless planes go rolling on
And city life soon fades to gone
The wind blows free against your face
Your spirit soars on wings of grace

Silent Shadows slinking by
Within the darkened grass they lie
A hunter's moon lies full and low 
The prey's life blood begins to flow

See the watchers, skirt the light
Eye's gleam golden, it's almost night
Eternal twilight fills the air
The hunter's stalk with patient care

So leave the social ways behind
Reach deep and find your primal mind
The hunter or the hunted be
The darkness claim your soul
you'll SEE


im not what you think

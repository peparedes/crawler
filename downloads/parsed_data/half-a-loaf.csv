"event","ahhhh! friends! they're here!
so here's a quick update on my life:
craig and i broke up in december and after being apart 6 months we started seeing each other again,and now we seem to be on a really healthy path in life together.(we just got our portraits done dressed up as zombies,HALLOWEEN is almost here!!)
i left ValueVillage in april and worked at ardene for a short time,but as many of you could guess i really wasn't me. when i left there i was unemployed for a couple months and had a lot of time to read and re-evaluate life.
anyway,now i'm working at carlton cards,which a really enjoy,and i'm trying to put together a buisness plan so that maybe one day i can open up my own little shop.
mix in a few trips to ottawa to see rachel,snoop dogg,ryan moving back to hamilton,several drinking binges and you've got my life for the past year or so.

i got paid like $120 today, for what?
sitting in the back of a truck, waiting for people to drop off donations, i thought there was going to be tons, but i guess everyone decided to drink instead.
there were a few, including a couch,which i put in the truck and then sat on that for the last few hours of ""work""
craig also made it more enjoyable by stoping by with iced tea and butter tarts for me.

he had the internet, but a broken computer. i had a computer and no money for internet,so together, we lugged my pc on the bus (his car just broke down) and here i am now.

so anyway, i havn't really talked to anyone all that much lately..i hope you're all doing well.
i guess everyone is home for the summer?
drop by.
i should be home more often now that the heat wave is over.
oh, i may have to move soon, they're selling the house and theres constantly realestate peeps walking through scaring bambam..bastards..as much as i bitch about the ceilings and stairs there, i really like the place, it's the perfect size for me and bambam,neighbours are all pretty anti social which is exactly what i wanted,and i'm minutes away from the casbah,jackson,the market,..what more could i want?
so anyway,yeah, i'm still working at good ol' Value village, one year this week!..today actually..i get a raise!

it makes me feel old and kind of depressed that everyone is off living there own lives..and the fact that ANNEKA AND JOSEPH both promised to come visit my new place and never did..(anneka that one time didn't count because you were there to do homework!)
also, reading my old posts makes me think about the 'cale days' it was nice to have someone to go home to..i'm not saying things were perfect,maybe i'm finally at that stage where i'm letting go of all the nasty stuff and jut remembering the good times..
well..not too much new from last time i posted.. i got to see dan alot this past week,him being home and all..i really didn't want him to go home, when we hugged goodbye i wanted to cry..good thing i'm a rock that doesn't cry anymore.. (ha.)
things with anthony are kinda bringin me down, i really like him, but he totally sees me as 'one of the guys' now, not his girlfriend,or a girl at all for that matter! this always happens,everytime i like a guy,and spend time with them,the totally just see me as another guy..i think theres only one answer..breast implants! (obviously)

wow.. i sure feel great right now.. it's a good thing i stopped at the store and bought a whole lot of chocolate on my way here..
well..talk to you laterish

yup, i'm at mohawk,i'm loving it here, it's so much better then high school, and now i don't feel as pathetic when i come on here, and all you are talking about your college lives..sure i havn't finished highschool, but the fact that i'm finishing it by goiing to college classes is far cooler!
i really don't care for this ece stuff though..i thought it was what i wanted to do but it really isn't very intellectually stimulating...not to mention it's all dumb girls..
that is why i've changed my career path...private investigator here i come!!
oh! for anyone who doesn't know yet..me and dan are getting married, i think dan is embarrassed because he won't tell his parents about it.. but yes, april 7th (or around that date(jackie chan's b-day)) of 2013 we'll be having a kung-fu zombie wedding..WITH SUBTITLES
hope you all can make it..
:)
so yeah,work is starting to suck..all my friends are quitting! this week alone i think there were 4 people who quit..they're the only part that make it fun..well that and being allowed to play the ""wear whatever you find on the floor,the creepier the better"" game...
eeew...there are some very gross items donated to VV

today i went to a hockey game, chris's hockey game. it was fun, it made me want to learn ow to skate again.
chris offered to teach me how to skate, anyone else know how? i have a feeling anthony will get jealous if i start spending too much time with chris.
i can't believe i bought anthony that stupid gun for christmas, i was planning on getting him somthing nice, clothes or a zippo lighter or somthing, but no, he wanted a marshmellow launcher...oh well..
DAN's home! *rejoice*
i can't wait for the kung-fu action to begin!

this may be the last post from me for awhile as i am moving in to my apartemento on sunday.sure,theres still school,the library,and cales when i visit,but it's just no the same.
i'm a bit dissapointed right now, i went over to my apartment around 2:30,mrs.P and mr.B were supposed to come over at 5ish,and we were going to go up to value village..but around 5:45 mrs.P showed up saying we couldn't go because she had to babysit another teachers kids unexpectedly..

anyway,cale's making dinner,i'm glad because i'm way too cranky too stand up.
bah,i don't even know why i went to school today..the only class i had was math,and i just played cards with alanna..2nd period was spent wandering about,lunch was spent walking around with dan (and that damn sword!)and a bit in the courtyard..(WAY TOO MUCH CREEPINESS IN THERE) then i came home,ate a chocolate bun (one week till i can have another!) and had a non-bubble bath,i packed my bubbles,i was so mad!

anyway,everyone come visit me!!!
i think it'll be a week on my own before my cat comes to live with me,so i'll need you!

speaking of the man with a plan, he's apparently taking pictures today and wants us to come along,i think he feels guilty for cheatin' on us last night by going out with anneka and sharon..hehe i guess i have to learn to share dan,i mean he is leaving hamilton this summer.
i should get takin pictures as well i havn't done much photography..i think because i like taking pictures when i'm happy and i havn't felt all that cheery lately. i need to get out of here,get a place i can call ""home"". i've gone so long without a place of my own.

it's for a group called focus on the family,i thought that discrimination was illegal but i guess i was wrong when ads like this are being printed in our papers.
the web site is ridiculous!

""Marriage explains the rich genealogical nature of heterosexual family ties""

""The bottom-line is that in marriage and parenting, gender matters.""

""Parents teaching their children that marriage is the union of a man and a woman, would face marginalization and possible public reprisal""

"event","wow
it really is goregous out there,speaking of goregous,that's the name of a really cool jackie chan movie i saw the other day.
today dan and i were talking about how NOTHING could stop jackie..
speaking of dan,he's leaving this summer,which sucks..cale,carlo and i are supposed to be moving in to out own apartment this summer,which will be great,but i'm sure i'll feel like the third wheel all the time,so dan,you either have to come visit often,or find a replacement for you. (if you'd like to apply for position of dan's replacement, send your resume to loloburger@hotmail.com ,requirements: the love of jackie chan, ability to make and take your mom jokes,and you have to be a total bastard)
so anyway,cale's sitting over yonder watching star trek,god i love him..i really hope he gets this job with carlo's dad,it wouldn't start untill may,but it would be so good for him..
well i'm going to see if i can find somthing to barbeque
how can you NOT barbeque in this weather?!

"event","hey
ugh,this morning i slept in a bit,and was planning on still showing up for 1st period,just really late,but everytime i think about going my stomach flips,and i panic..i do still plan on going,just to talk to mr.B and mme.dunfield
and get the work i need..crap,there was a spanish test today..eh,i probably wouldn't have written it today anyway..
cale's still sleeping, i'm going to try to get him up so he'll come with me..
maybe if i make him pancakes he'll do it..
well i hope to see you guys,even if it's just for a minute, today, if not then i'll see you punkass bitches tomorrow.

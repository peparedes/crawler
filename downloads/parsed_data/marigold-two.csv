And I'm ridiculous for not knowning how to ut up photos are tag links.
You would think after my addiction to myspace it'd be really easy to figure out, but alas I have nothing to show but my words.
sucks.
On a MUCH HAPPIER note...dun dun da daahhh...tomorrow is my 21st burthday.
I really don't know why I'm excited. Actually, not that I really listen to my heart beat at the thought of my birthday, I'm actually not that excited.
There's nothing that special about the big two one.
I've been drinking for years...and this past year specifically I drank almost every Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday night.
So, its not all that momumentous, aside from the fact that I will finally be able to buy beer on my own. That's the only thing to look forward to as far as tradition and twenty first birthdays go.
Other than beer buying, its just another day. 
I'll get to eat at Il Sole in Hollywood and cahrge an obscene dinner bill to my father's credit card.
Yeah, tomorrow is nothing out of the ordinary."

Superman. The 3D made my 10bucks worth while. Plus I got to keep the snazzy glasses.
The Devil Wears Prada. Merryl is hilarious and its quite a cute movie, but in the end I felt aweful for eating that crunch bar and small buttered popcorn.
An Inconvient Truth. Way to go Al Gore! I think conserving is an ethical responsibility, and I'm happy someone finally made a movie about it.

"event","It is Spring. There is a gloom about Beijing and I have never been happier. It seems my last month here will end as it began- gray and pleasantly bustling with life. I have evolved in such a way that is sometimes hard for even me to comprehend, nonetheless my friends and family. I hear it. I see it. I look in the mirror and feel it. I have taken away so much from the people I have met. They have offered me so much love, inspiration, and encouragement I think I would be set for life if I didn't meet another soul on this earth. But I will meet other people, and perhaps impression on them the things that have been given to me. The other day, a wise boy told me that even when we forget people, discontinue our casual contacts, or fail to call and email those we said we'd stay in touch with, we still somehow keep them with us in the way we live out their influence. There is truth in that. Hopefully I will never forget what these people have meant to me. Erik has taught me to be more accepting of the different shapes of love. Theresa has showed me how rewarding it is to have faith in something greater. Connor reminds me of what great music can do for a person's sanity. Rachel shoves a care-free attitude down my throat and I can't get enough. Tim reminded me to never be embarassed of the little things that make us ""nerdy."" Sara makes me want to work harder at loving myself. Will brings out the wit in me and challenges me to show my poetic side. Cait exemplifies the strong, goal-oriented woman who never forgets what it is she's after. Chris, Dhruv, Thomas, and Jose bring out the goddess in me. Pau and I complete one another and it will be painful and impossible to leave him- simply put. I could go on forever about the people I have found here. I could go on forever about how they have reshaped and molded me into a better woman. I am so thankful for them. I will always love them all."

what is the point at this age?
nothing is consistent when you're twenty.
nothing should be consistent at this age.
consistency and commitment, especially at such a primitive stage in life, is for suckers with no imagination.
i didn't use to think this way, but i'm starting to believe it more and more everyday.
it is the perfect ideology for now.

i can add, subtract, and divide my personal equation whenever i want, and as often as i want.
i am happy. don't i look happy?? i'm really fucking happy!!

"event","I don't think I could ever really describe China. I know I could explain what the food tastes like, show pictures of the vast landscapes I've seen, and detail the rituals and customs of the people; but I don't think I could ever truly convey what it is like to live here. I don't think I could put into perfect words what it does to you or, at the very least, what its done to me.

The country in itself brings, at least once a day, a shock value unlike any other. The people are wonderful, but god damn do they act in strange ways. Perhaps it isn't fair to call them ""strange"". They probably think I'm strange with my ""God bless you""s after someone sneezes and my unheard of size forty-one shoe. The people are different. Refreshingly different. I can't remember the last time I saw as many bikes on the road as cars; nor can I remember the last time I saw someone smoking a ciggarette, talking on their cell phone, and riding a bike at the same time. 

Life here can be so chaotic- its' still overwhelming at times. I think I need that though. I think I need to be pushed and shoved at while trying to pay for clothes just becuase the Chinese have absolutely no conception of what ""waiting in line"" means. It's wonderful. Absolutely wonderful. I am constantly reminded of how good life is back home. At the same time, however, China makes me realize how much better life could be. Everybody here is so ambitious. The country has a long way to go on the whole, but Beijing in itself is moving at a rate that the world probably isn't ready for. Maybe its the rate at which I move while living her that puts everything into perspective.

I feel unbound living here. I don't get that same feeling in the states, and I'm not sure what it is about China that brings it out in me. A few nights ago, while acting incredibly wise and emo beyond my years, I was sitting in a coffe shop/english library (The Bookworm) taking a break from my current read (a book Chris leant to me) and sipped my cafe latte as I starred out the window and down onto the street. You know how feelings of security and understanding and joy can just rush over you unexpectedly? Well excuse me for sounding so emotional and pathetic, but that's pretty much how I felt. That's pretty much how China feels.

I've seen a lot in one semester and formed friendships worth hanging onto forever. China makes me feel alive. I'm sure other places out there in the world somewhere will make me feel the same, but its the first time any place other than San Francisco has really produced this thriving feeling on my being. There is so much freedom here. There are endless opportunities. There is so much potential in this enormous country- both in the people and in its economic and political arenas- that I am somehow reminded there is a lot of potential within myself. Ok, so that metaphor is somewhat of a stretch and shamefully cheesy, but I don't know how else to put it. I feel remarkably independent and strong and I don't know if I would feel that way if I were living in, oh, let's say Europe. I haven't been, so I can't judge, but I am here in China presently and it's good. Tha'ts all that really matters- that life is good. It's good, I'm happy, and I owe a lot of that to this crazy place we call China."

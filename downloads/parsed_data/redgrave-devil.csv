"event","Tony raced down the street, the charms on his coat jingling loudly, as he looked for Vergil. But there was no sign of his brother. Not at Bobby's Cellar (no demonic auras there, thank whatever deity was listening) or at Grue's place (no demonic auras there either). And definitely not in the Nexus like he'd initially feared.

That left only Nell's place.

He pounded up the steps, the book he'd read describing her death on his mind. Bursting through the door, he nearly faceplanted as he skidded to an abrupt stop, staring at the scene in front of him.

The old lady was sitting at her work table with a gun in pieces in front of her, and sitting on a corner of her desk was Vergil. Unarmed, no disguise. Both were looking at him, Nell in surprise and mild annoyance, Vergil with a faint, almost mocking smirk.

""Don't you know how to knock, kid?""

It took a moment for the question to register, but for the life of him, Tony couldn't muster up his usual retort to Nell's greeting. In fact, he didn't seem able to summon a response at all, his mind still struggling to wrap around what he was seeing.

And damn Vergil for looking so smug about that fact."

"event","Tony whistled cheerfully to himself, feet propped up on a desk as he flipped through a book, his sword propped against the desk within easy reach. Despite his affected cheeriness, his eyes were hard. Hearing approaching footsteps, he dropped the book out of sight moments before a familiar bandaged figure stepped into the room.

""Gilver. Hey. Glad you could make it,"" he greeted the other man, waving him toward a seat.

Gilver nodded slightly at the greeting. ""It was only polite to accept your invitation. Particularly since you were so insistent.""

Tony grinned and stretched, then slipped his hands behind his head. ""How's your head? Bobby's vodka is a shock the first time."" He snickered at the other man's groan. ""Yeah, they robbed me blind the first time, too.""

Gilver's eyes flicked toward Tony's sword.

""No, they didn't get my sword. I had the foresight to leave it behind the first time."" Tony smirked faintly as he watched Gilver's reactions. ""Ain't no way I was going to lose my protector.""

""A wise choice.""

""Yeah, I make those sometimes."" Tony eyed the other man, then decided to make his first move. ""You know, I been wondering. Gilver's an odd name. It mean anything, or is it just a nickname?"" He hid a smirk when he saw the other stiffen almost imperceptibly.

""Why do you ask?"" the other man asked, voice calm.

Tony shrugged dismissively. ""See, I used to know someone who wasn't too creative when we played spies 'n stuff as kids. His idea of a flawless secret identity was rearranging his name. Stupid junk like Vigrel and Grivel.""

The other man was slowly tensing, though his expression couldn't be seen through the bandages.

""He was most proud of the stellar name of <i>Gilver.</i> Right, Vergil?"" He grinned as 'Gilver' went completely still.

For a moment neither moved. Then they both burst into a blur of movement. The brief scuffle was over in seconds, ending with 'Gilver' sprawled out on the floor, several darts protruding from his shoulder. Tony grinned triumphantly, then crouched down to tear the bandages off...and his information was confirmed as he gazed at his twin's unconscious face.

""Welcome back, brother,"" Tony murmured. ""We've got a lot to catch up on."""

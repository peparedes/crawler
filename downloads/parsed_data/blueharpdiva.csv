"event","so...the point to this journal....

I am starting to do more with my music, and I wanted to write more about it here on LJ.  But I didn't want it to get mixed in with everything else, so I thought I'd put it here.  I welcome comments from everyone, especially those who are actively making music with me.  

While some of this does pertain to harp jobs such as weddings, I'd like to keep it focused on solo stuff, recording, projects.  Stuff besides being 'background music', although being background music is what I get paid to do usually.  

I also have started a publishing company, Aria 51 (trademarked-dont you dare try and steal it!), and it will also serve as my own label.  As soon as I get stuff all ready to go I will take it down to Aztec, make it into books, of a sort, and sell them.  Hopefully ebay-well, surely ebay, but I'm hoping Concord Music might be interested in carrying a few of them.  I know the VA harp center is.  

Feel free to add me as a friend, and let me know if you'd like to be added."

I just finished writing a really long entry and I clicked on some stupid link and when i pushed the 'back' button on my browser to come back to this stupid screen (the one that you write your entries in) everything was erased. In short I'm going to Europe and I'll be back on July 22. How was Spider Man 2?"

"event","It's been awhile since I've updated and many things have happened. First, I got my guitar. I've been consumed with that. I was off from work this week so I went out a lot--Lida had a get together on Wednesday, and Anna had a get together on Thursday. The other nights I've been out to B-town including tonight. I'm leaving July 2 so I've got about a week left to see all my peeps. I'm already looking forward to Cross Country and Homecoming but definitely not school and all the work. Oh yea--I went running with Julian, Greg, Chris, Jared, Danny, Ben, and Jesien on Friday night. It was a short run and it wasn't too bad but I could have done better (if I had been training). After we went to Chipotle. Good stuff."

"event","Tennis camp was really fun today. We went to McDonald's for lunch. We rode the Metro home again like always, and the metro-bus driver told us that it was the last time we could use our i.d.'s; now we have to pay everytime we ride the bus. When I got home I chilled with Greg, went to WJ and met up with Francois, and came back home. Now I'm going to karate. I'm out. If everything goes well I'm getting my guitar tomorrow. Niiiiiicccceee."

"event","Good day. Tennis camp was fun and I got my staff shirt today. I went to Bethesda with Greg and Cois, ate at Cosi's where we met up with Leila, Sara Sidransky, Karen, Sara Kay, Jessie, Anna, Anastasia, Lida, Hilary, and Sara Price. We went to Barnes & Noble where I got a father's day card. Then we walked around Bethesda. Here I am now. I want to go to the pool tomorrow but I have to go to karate. Just two more days till the thing I've been waiting for for a long time. I'm out."

"event","Hey today was my first day working at the tennis summer camp in Bethesda. It's a fun job because you get to chill with little kids and share your love of the game with them. I work from 9-3:30. After work, Greg came to my house, we ate Gelato (Italian ice cream) and then went to run and lift at the YMCA. After we came back to my house and chill. I'm picking up my guitar on Thursday. I have to go to bed now because I need to wake up early. I'm out. (I hope Anna has a party on Friday but shhh...)"

"event","Hey. My party was last night. It was pretty much a success. It was tiring hosting the party--i didn't get to relax as much as I wanted. Tonight was Damon's party. I had a great time. It was nice getting to know people that I knew before (but not too well) better. Here I am typing this entry--here's what's on my mind: waking up early tomorrow to go work at a tennis camp, going to see the new Harry Potter movie (even though I heard it sucks) and Saved, and getting my guitar. Besides that there's nothing else. My summer so far has been great. I'm out."

"event","Hey,
I didn't have any exams today. At around ten I went to Anna's house. She has a pool so we had a lot of fun and there were a lot of people there. It was fun knocking emma and lida off of the floating things. After that, we ate pizza and then went to Anna's room to chill. It was a fun day and very relaxing. To Anna: your house is so relaxing and chill--it feels like your at the beach and I would trade houses with you anyday. I am going to study for chem now. Remember, party my house on Saturday June 12. It runs till 12-1ish and if ur reading this you're invited. If you have lights (strobe, disco ball, black light, rope lights, etc.) please bring them. I'm out."

"event","Hey. It's 11:17. I'm listening to music. I sit at my computer wasting time. I've got one more day of school left and then my sophomore year is over! My party is on Saturday night at my house and its running till really late, so if your reading this and you don't have any plans stop by. On Monday I'm starting to work at a tennis camp in Bethesda. After three weeks of that, I'm going to France and Italy. I'm getting back in July. I need to work on my eagle project and finish it, go see OAR in concert, go to the Legg Mason Tennis Classic, and do my summer hw. The summer is going to go by so fast; before I know it the grueling junior year will begin. I'm in for it junior year."

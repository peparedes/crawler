"event","so, i've got a tattoo. i didn't think i'd actually get one.. but i did. my best friend amanda went w/me to get it the other day. it didn't hurt as badly as i thought it would.. after a while it just felt like someone was drawing on your back w/a pen. but it's really itchy now. sucks that i cant scratch the scabby shit off. but whatever. life's good. i like it. it's really fast paced and shit like that. ive got a good job, good friends, good family. all's good.

this kid chris from my work, he's super cool and cute.. he's in a band and takes kick ass pictures.. he's going to teach me how to play a guitar. b/c i have one, and i've never learned.. but i want to. 

anyways, dad and i are going to go watch the incredibles. toodles."

"event","last night was VERY stressful. 

the only thing that calmed me down was chris talking all night.

let me start off by saying that the majority of people pay for their groceries by cash, credit or debit. well, last night, our system shut down and we weren't able to take foodstamps, credit or debit. people were outraged. to top it off, we had 2 regular lines and one express open due to lack of cashiers. and in the midst of all of that, our intercom stopped working. and then later last night, some belts stopped working.. and it was VERY frustrating to say the least.

and chris, he's so cute and he looks really young. hes either 20 or 22, i can't remember. but he looks only 18. but he was making me laugh all night. like, when rick called the regist phone, chris picked it up upside down and didn't even realize it, and i laughed so hard. he's adorable. like, a cool older brother. 

D.W. came in at like 6, he turned 18 wednesday. i didn't wish him a happy birthday. he was being an ass to me yesterday. and so i ignored him all night. then when i was counting my till he came in w/rick and i and was scratching off lotto tickets. and was getting all excited. it was amusing. 

i'm in need of $. i need to pay for the rest of my prom dress soon. it's been like 2 months. but whatever.

i'm going to go play mario now."

"event","am i a failure?

i mean, these thoughts run through my head.. like, will i amount to anything? why go to school for so many years if i'm just going to be a nothing.. i don't want to be a nothing.

i'm just really scared i guess.. i mean, moving over 6 hours away is a big thing.. a big deal. two of the girls i grew up w/today, one my best friend and another just a good friend told me it wasn't the same and that THEY were upset that i was leaving. so now i feel like i'm hurting people.. because i know my family.. at least my sister will be upset.. she starting crying and getting upset over me leaving last year, and that was when i planned to be only an hour and a half away.. now over six hours.

and i'm going to be by myself up there until i meet new people. i'll be living with a stranger until i get to know them. i'm scared, what if i don't like them? what if i am completely broke and have no money? what if all those people were right.. i'm not going to make it. what if something happens to my family in MD and i'm up in PA getting a damn education? i'd be devastated. 

people say i'm brave. i'm the first to venture out of the family. i'm the youngest. no one else has moved that far away. maybe to another city 10 minutes away.. but nothing that far. i'm moving to a place where no one else i know is at. no family. no friends. just me and a HUGE city of strangers. 

to say the least i'm scared."

"event","ok. well, tony and i went to see Hide and Seek. it was a VERY scary movie, contrary to what Tony thought. He was laughing the whole way through, while I was jumping out of my seat terrified. It was so cute.. when I jumped the first time, he grabbed my hand, and we held hands the rest of the night. and i know.. you're like, well.. what about med? well, screw him right now. i'm tired of him anyways. he's nice and sweet when he wants something. and he HARDLY ever calls. he always expects me to go down there.. it's rediculous. and i refuse to deal w/it anymore. Woo, back to tony..

well, we've been hanging out here and there for a little time now, and last night after the movie we just chilled in his car b/c my car is too small for his giant self to get in there[he's 6'3"" and i have a small car]. anyways, yeah so we sat there a while.. i just layed in the passenger seat staring at him. and he'd look over and just smile a huge smile. and it was so cute.. like, i asked what he was thinking and he was like ""i don't know it's just.."" and he rambled on a little about how he didn't know. and then finally he's like ""something inside me was missing and it's been filled.. i'm on some cloud or something"" very adorable. hes woo. <3 already. lmao but seriously.. he's a cool guy and got me starting to like him. we hung out in his car till like.. 11:30 and i didn't get home until 12.. and when i was laying in my bed, all i could think about is how i smelled like him.. and he's got this.. i dunno, warm soothing scent to him.. like, yanno how everyone has their own unique smell.. well, his was so good. lmao. ok, yall prolly like ""wtf this girl is going around sniffin people"". but syke, anyways. i was making fun of his belly b/c he's not fat at all, and he's really REALLY tall, so you wouldnt think he'd have a little pudge. and it's not all over, it's just around his belly button.. and it's tight, so i kept tapping it and sticking my finger in his button. 

and like, i know he likes me and all.. and i'm really diggin him too.. but it's hard because i'm going to school soon.. pittsburgh baby! AIP suckers. and.. he's going to be 6 or 7 hrs away. and he's like ""oh it's just a one hour flight"".. well, i don't ride airplanes. scared of heights, hello. anyways.. but since he works at an airport, he gets free flights.. so he can fly out to see me all the time. and yeah, he said that there's a new airport opening up in pittsburgh, and his bosses told him it'd be in his best interest to move out there and help get it started because he'd have higher ranks and stuff. and it's weird.. like, he wasn't even thinking about it before we met, but like now.. he said if we end up dating, and we're together still, when i leave he'll probably move out there as well.. he said he'd be too upset to have me that far away from him.. and he's so cute. aw!

one thing that bothers me, is that he's a ""man ho"".. has (protected) sex w/a lot of girls, and i told him even if we did start dating, nothing was going to happen right away.. i just don't get down like that. but yeah, so we talked about how if we did date that he'd have to stop going to his cousin's place and drinkin (that's when all the girls start rolling in).. and he couldn't have all these hoochies all up on him all the time.. and he's like ""michele... i'll give up all those girls for you"". and it may be just a line and whatnot, but he seems sincere. and i hope he is. 

i have to tell med that it's off.. whatever we have left is done w/. i don't want him anymore. i don't like him anymore. he swooned me, the bastard. i already took him outta my phone. i'm not playing games with him.

oh yeah, another thing.. tony had just bought a car monday.. and he didn't want it really so he's trying to sell it to get another one, and yeah he has a for sale sign in his car and some guys were driving around us while we were in it and they finally pulled up to his side and they asked him about the car and shit, and after they left (they spent like 10 minutes trying to talk to tony but he just tried getting them away), tony turns to me and he's like ""why are you so quiet? are you okay?"" and i was like ""...yeah, just letting you talk"" (i wasn't upset or anything) and he was telling me how he felt bad for ignoring me for a little to talk to them.. and i just laughed b/c that didn't even cross my mind. but yeah <3. <3. <3.

anywho, class is almost over. yeah.. goodbye!"

so yeah, med called me last night, first time in a while.. i think hes cheating which is why i was being a snot to him. he hung up on me twice. the second time, i refused to call him back. and he wanted me to go see him last night, but i said no! i was mad, and didn't want to see or really talk to him.

but woo. this guy tony, we're going out tonight to hang out.

LMFAO. i just heard ms wood say ""foreign objects will NOT be inserted into your PCs"".. 

anyways, yeah i was in the newspaper saturday. hold on and i'll get the link!. <A HREF=""http://carrollcountytimes.com/articles/2005/01/22/news/local_news/news5s.txt""> Click here if you're cool enough!</A> that's it my friends. woop. what i think is shitty is that there were 5 kids involved[scott, ashley, myself, ian, and linwood.] and only two were mentioned[linwood and myself]. oh well tho. i don't care! i was in there!!! maybe just once, but *I* Michele Becker was mentioned. holler. ;D

oh, anyways.. my sister is having heart surgery.. it's sad and scary and i hope she's alright. she's probably leaving her house right about now. i might drive an hour one way to see her tonight depending on how it goes. she's only 24 and i pray to God nothing happens to her. she's my guiding light. i'd be lost if something horrible happened to her. i think everyone would. she brings a lot of sunshine into regular every day people's lives.

i'm taking ecology first mod.. it's so retarded i swear. and the teacher's retarded as well. she's black tho, and i've never had a black teacher.. otherwise, i'd drop the class. manda wants me to take intro to foods w/her.. but i dunno, eco seems fairly simple.. the teacher's black, i get service hours.. 30.. i don't feel like going to guidance and dealing w/their asses anyways. butttt.. i dunno. i probably'll stick it out like a soldier. b/c well, i'm tough. anyways. the only pluses to foods is that i won't walk file miles from my car to class, then back to my car and the only other plus i can think of is that i'll get a class w/man. a cooking class. i HATE cooking though. so i'm not sure. i'll talk to her tomorrow. 

anyways. i'm tired of typing. it's bogus. lmao. anyways, bye bye."

"event","Okay, so 12[not counting today] more days till MY birthday. I'm excited.. i'm going to be 18. 

Um, today's my boyfriend's birthday. He's not here tho.. so we're celebrating it Tuesday. He's in NYC w/his family for New Years Eve & his birthday.. he won't be back until monday and i work monday so.. i won't be seeing him, but bet your ass i'll be going down to see him tuesday night.. wednesday night.. thursday night.. friday night.. ;D but yeah, i'm so crazy about him. 

Oh! About my phone, i got it back the other night.. but first.. let me tell you about our exchange of words.. ok, he was PISSED about how i acted the night he came up and i left my phone in his car, i slammed his door and everything, and that pissed him off the most, so we didn't talk for a while, a few days.. and we made arrangements for me to drive an hour round trip to his house to get my phone and he wouldn't come give it to me, i had to go get it.. but w/e, i went down to his house that night TWICE b/c i couldn't find his house.. i was so mad, so anyways.. i guess he started feeling bad or w/e but then monday, he started talking to me and said he'd bring my phone up.. so yeah, we met at target, and i got in his car, we drove around and talked a lot and we had our first kiss. it was so sweet. i was like ""wow, your lips are soft"" and he stopped kissing me and was like ""-laughs... yeah i know"" and little things like that are what attracts me to him, he's so funny and cute.. and omg, his hair. it's so soft and fluffy and long. he's got to use a huge rubber band to hold it all back. but yeah, we had our first kiss and it was sweet.. then we layed in the seats and just talked and it got silent. and out of the blue he put his arm up so his hand was in the air, and i put mine up close to his and we interlocked fingers and we just layed there holding hands.. and that got me.. he thinks he's all gangster, but he's not. he's a sweet cute loving man. and i'm absolutely crazy about him.

ok, now all i can think about is him. and how i miss him. 

yeah, so i got off from he 12th to the 16th for my birthday.. i'm happy. yep, me. VERY happy. in fact, i'm happy w/ALL of my life. it's wonderful. i wouldn't trade it w/anyone in the world.

i'm getting my prom dress soon, i'm going the 9th to try it on and such. it's beautiful.. i posted pictures in an earlier post. it's $350 tho. VERY worth it in my eyes. Med's taking me to prom. he's already told me that.. when we first started talking he said he wanted to go w/me, so i was like ok.. 

anyways, christmas.. i got an iPod, a U2 special edition iPod to say the least.. it's great, i love it, take it EVERYWHERE. yep. it's hot, black red, and silver. <3 i also got a digital camera. i take that everywhere as well. it's great as well. it's been a great year. 

OHHH!! i got partially accepted to my school of choice. The Art Institute of Pittsburgh. <333 I'm going to be attending the school starting October 5th, 2005. I'm super excited about it. I've actually got an idea of how i want my life to span out.. it's amazing and eye opening. 

this entry was far too long but w/e i'm going to go to bed possibly b/c i'm tired as everything."

"event","Okay, so we had a class ""extended holiday break"" aka, a party. and there's the west side of the room is over here eating food and yeah, it's ALL guys. well, the whole class is all guys.. except for 3 girls, but whatever, anyways the west side is talking about girls and sex and banging girls and all this.. well, Steve is interested in a girl and all the other guys are making fun of him b/c he's like ""stop pressuring me into something. it isn't my intention!"" he doesn't want to rush his girl and everything.. it's so cute. Cubbage is such an ass.. and so is Kyle. They're both majorly into fucking and such.. which is horrible.. i wonder if all men think like that.

anyways, i'm so annoyed. last night i talked to my sweetie, he came down to my work on my break b/c he didn't have to work.. well, we get in his car and drive around and yeah, he parks the car and thinks hes going to get some [in a half hr.. not likely]. Anyways, so i told him that i didn't like the fact that it seemed like the only reason why he came down was to get some ass. and i had mentioned that he hadn't hugged me or anything, which i thought was rude and ungentleman-like. anyways.. so he didn't give me a hug, he said he was black and too gangster to give a hug first.. and i told him i don't give hugs first, so no one got a hug. okay, well it comes to 8 oclock, i've got to go back so i tell him and like, he pulls up to Target and I'm like ""are you going to give me a hug?"" and he looks at me and tells me no, and he said that i could give him one tho.. so i'm like ""ok, well c'mere"" and i wrap my arm in his and try to give him a hug, well.. he pulls away and so i pull my arm back and i'm like ""fine w/e"" and i get out and slam his car [it's a <i>nice</i>2004 Saturn] door. i was so heated.. he ticked me off. anyways, well he flies off in his car, i get to the Target entrance doors, and i reach my hands into my coat pockets where my cell is kept.. i look around for my phone to look at the time.. i can't find it, i turn around and he's gone.. and so my attitude gets a LOT worse. i was so mad the rest of the night. and i don't know his #.. it's programmed in my phone, so i don't NEED to know it. and i left a message for him on yahoo last night when i got home, but he wasn't there.. but i NEED my phone asap. it's so aggravating not having it.

anyways, i'm mad again after typing about my phone.. UGH. i'm going to go play some more games."

"event","So yeah, Will is mad at me because yesterday i saw a picture of his girlfriend and she's well.. how can i put this, not very attractive, so i was like ""Ew, what's wrong w/your gf?"" and he just now was like ""what do you mean"" so i told her that she didn't look like his type and he's like ""if you're trying to say she's ugly, you're wrong... she's beautiful!"" i was like ""maybe to you"" and then he said i was ugly, and i told him that i wasn't ""anime"" or pastey therefore making me look better.. lmao he got mad, told me i was a bitch and all this other junk. cracks me up. 

Anyways, so my brother is finally getting married Friday. They're going to the courthouse to have it done, but still.. it's the thought that counts, yanno? The reception is Saturday at his house.. it's not going to be anything big but still, he wants us[the family] to make it memorable and special for them. For Friday, when they go to the courthouse, i'm letting Bay use the boquet[sp?] that rich and i's grandmother made before she passed away. Rich doesn't know it yet, but I'm going to let her use it.. it's something special for them. it's something old and borrowed.. and aren't the other two something new and blue?

this guy i know, medtip.. that's his nickname for some reason, lmao we've been talkin for a while, we like each other and everything.. he came to my work Sunday night, and we sat in his car and talked for my whole break, i wanted to stay and talk to him more, but i had to go back to work.. but he's so cute. great braids and everything. very hip hop.. and SO funny.. i can't explain what it is about him, but he's just great. we talk for hours on the phone, after i get off work, or he gets off work. he's already told me he's going to my prom w/me.. which is great, i think he'd look real hot dressed up.

anyways, i'm going to go call him before work and then go to work.. b/c i need money. OH! I get paid tomorrow, go me. ;D"

"event","Lmao, these people in my class are fools. Good grief charlie brown. Um, so yeah, the left wall of losers are arguing about the creation of the world, and Cubbage bursts out ""It's a sun dial, buddy!"".. for some random reason. lmao anyways. it's annoying. the stuff they're saying is completely wrong, ian and i are laughing at them.

lmao cubbage just said something about his ""pimp bottle"" and how it says he's got rights to every girl in a 150,000 mile radius. and somehow.. he related that to God. I'm not sure how though..

Now they're having the God debate.. if he created the WHOLE world, all the other planets and such, why wasn't it talked about in the Bible.. and cubbage was wondering who created God if he created all that.

Anyways, it's annoying, they are. I'm freezing.

I just had my mock interview, the guy who interviewed me kept saying ""damn"" and i was like ""Whoa"" and i just sat there and shivered b/c the place was SO cold. but right now, i'm just kind of cold, sitting in my comp chair w/no shoes on. 

People bother me. 

I have to work tonight. Tomorrow. Thursday..

Life is stressful. I've got to do my homework soon, but w/e. I don't want to do it.

Kyle just said ""blacks are taking over"". and that in 3,000 yrs, we're all going to be black. Wrong, but good try.

Um, so yeah. i'm stressed. Between work, school, guys[one in particular], family, etc. it's just almost too much for me. I'm at the end of my rope. 

When I come back from lunch, i'll TRY to do coding for my journal.. dunno if i'll be able to get to it, or if i'll get it all done today, but i am always willing to try. 

Someone in my comp class is TOO cute. Too bad he has a girlfriend. Ahaha, anyways. Yeah so that sucks, but i don't really want to date him anyways. He's just eye candy, yanno? He's always flirting w/me, it's so adorable.. but w/e.

Rick's getting on my last nerve w/""Actually!"". 

Anyways, I'm going to sit here and do nothing until lunch b/c i'm tired of doing stuff. 

Oh! Before my interview, i took about a half hr nap on my desk, and woke up b/c i had a dream that there was an announcement on the PA system telling us to go to the place for the interviews. well, when i woke up, i kinda jumped and ppl looked at me, especially <i>him</i>.

anyways, time to do nothing! Goodbye.

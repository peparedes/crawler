"event","my mother said one day you'll know
what it's like to worry
when she said it she was talking about me having children
i of course said ""no no""--i'm not going to be sick with worry
though as long as i know they're safe i think i still would let them stay out if they're old enough
maybe not
well i don't have children so this is not the point
but now i know what it feels like to worry soooo much about someone
when you love someone soooo much that they're safety is a constant concern
that they aren't hurting, aren't in danger, are in a protected environment, that they are happy
when it scares you to think how it could be without them
i don't want to think of that
please be careful
i heart my sweetie sooooo much
the thought of her ever hurt...
it pains me
now i'm a worrier
it's bc my heart is filled with love"

"event","so yesterday i was talking about smiles
n really the only people who have seen me do my true smile is my sweetie n the people who happen to be around my when i'm with my sweetie
not that the others r fake...but they're not real
the best facial expression is the smile
it lights up the room (especially my sweetie's)
it makes ppl feel better
it shows the hope of the heart
and makes the world a little bit better, sometimes a lot better
i miss my sweetie like crazy
she's gotta heal my aching heart when i see her
i know she will
she always does every time i see her
it lifts me up
makes me walk a little taller
n just makes me oooohhhhh sooooooo happy
i wish she could be here right now
so i can just hold her my arms
n everything will be wonderful"

but i really dont want to get old
yesterday the people who r getting older and dealing with a lot of health problems were being interviewed
and where it is true that Jehovah helps you
i still wouldn't want to go through it
today we visited one of our older sisters while we were in service
she has alzheimer's which has got to like the worst
i can deal with pain, but the loss of your brain
just the worst
so we read to her the next bible reading
n the poor lady fell asleep during the last chapter

i really thought i would have something to say about this
but i just dont want to get old"

"event","yay!!!!
i passed yesterday's take and today's, i think
moving up and on
all thanks to my sweetie and a little work
my right wrist hurts a little
i better ice it

today i went to lunch with my cousin
he's 38 now...poor guy
we talked about stuff
he was saying how he couldn't eat when he was dating his wife
like he couldn't eat in front of her
i thought that was funny
i think i eat in front of my sweetie
i guess i havent noticed
it was fun
we went to the good steer which has like the best burgers
they're made with ""cheese dream sauce"" 
mmmmmmmmm
awesome burgers
sweetie would definitely like it
because her favorite thing to order is the burger

him and his wife have 2 cats
one of them was there...the other was hiding
so i pet it and my cousin says ""oh she can sense that you don't like animals""
but i like animals
i pet her and she kept purring
then i had to wash my hands because i had fur all over me
the thing i dont like about animals...the mess
ooooo...so next week we're going to the tea room
and there's a godiva store right by it
hmmm....i wonder if anyone would like chocolates?"

her name's sweetie melmel
she's a teddy bear not a person
my sweetie gave her to me
she stays in my bed in my arms
in fact right now she's next to me
she has the cutest little message ""somebody from hofstra loves me""
awwwwwwwwwwwwww
i love her
(i didnt say the exact 3 words so it still doesnt count)
hehe
every time i miss my sweetie i give sweetie melmel a hug

it's really funny...the things you'll do when you love someone
i havent slept with a teddy bear since, oh, who knows
but now i do
20 years old, sleeping with a teddy...hehe
it's from my sweetie so it's my favorite teddy

i can't wait to see my sweetie again

but i always have my thoughts
tighter n tighter
i miss her so much

i can have that dream forever
if i just always have that dream, well then u can put me in a coma bc i love it
just wake me up for the times when it really gets to happen

so today we ate at the top of the mountain
it seems like ages ago
it overlooks everything
i cant even describe it
u see about a million trees
n the snow draped over everything
it's just amazing
i wish i can share this moment with my sweetie
miss u

so we did some harder trails
i got tired by lunch
my legs felt exhausted
we do like over mile long trails straight
when we should take breaks going down
some little moguls....grrrr....gets sooo tiring
my legs r finally sore
tmrw should be nice n pain free...o well

at least i get to talk w my sweetie tmrw

that i was in the lobby of my hotel n i was talking w u online
but u were using raisa's screen name
it was really odd
but it was u doing the talking
i mean...i wouldnt have told raisa that i <3 her

so neway...
i've been sleeping soooo much
i think it's part of sweetie withdrawal

we went to the top of the mountain today
it was soo beautiful
u really get to appreciate jehovah's creation when ur at the top
the trees...the way the snow covers everything
it just looks so beautiful
not as beautiful as my sweetie
but if she was there it would have been quite a sight
she's w me in my heart but if she was w me in person...that would just be indescribably great

skiing everyday gets tiring
dont get me wrong..i love skiing
but i really miss my sweetie
n i'm just sooo sleepy
i think i'm sleeping so much bc i get to dream about her
i dont remember specifics but i remember she was there in my arms
n we hugged tighter n tighter
so another day goes by n shes not here
i'd like to fly her up here
even for a minute
it'd be the best minute of the trip
well 1 more day until i get to talk w her again
it'll be a hard day
but then it's thursday
i cant wait"

"event","i was thinking about something
bc i know i've felt it for a little while
it just scares me bc i know what it is
but never knew what it felt like
n since i've never felt it...well it's not that i doubt the feeling...it's there
i'm just concerned that it's too soon
but it's something u just know
n i love it
it makes me happy
but at the same time it hurts when i'm apart from her
yet i'd never trade the feeling for nething

so i was thinking...how does someone just know
what is the clicking that one has inside
n can u really even describe such a feeling...
or describe it to the point to someone who's never had the feeling can understand it
songs have been written
poems
books
but it's not one of those conscious decisions
not one that you contemplate n think about
u either feel it or not
its inside u
n it beams out of u
in a gaze, in a smile, in ur whole appearance, in what's on the inside
if only one can draw a picture of it
no human can draw it
but God created it in the human form
look at the one u love n u'll know what love is"

i've never had it happen to me
my heart's as constant as they come

well all the better
to stare into ur eyes

i'm not kidding when i say i can stare into them for all eternity n it never could b long enough
i stare...n i just know
i know
i can look at them and its like a window into her heart
her emerald eyes...but they r far more valuable
n i cant c those eyes for almost a whole week
i just may collapse b4 that time
n as much as i like the phantom of the opera
i could have completely stopped watching the movie n just stared into her eyes
it was my favortie part of the night along w the big hug
her eyes r just intoxicating
i looked into them n saw the wonderful future
my dreams will b beyond happy tonight
they totally just melt me
her eyes
(sigh)
i must come up w a worthy description of them
i must study them some more
they're indescribably beautiful--but i'll try to describe them
i just dont think there r the words invented yet to describe them
they could b the muse of every poet
the inspiration for every song writer
my sweetie
as perfect as they come"

"event","tonight was important to me bc i was able to open up in a way that i usually dont do w ppl
but she's special--of course she replied well
i remember once i said something personnal in an e-mail to what i thought was a good friend
n it was totally brushed over
like not even commented on
but i guess that's the difference w special ppl
they always make u happy
n sweetie is the most specialest of all (i'm not dumb i did that purposely)
n she said personnal stuff too which gives me warm feelin inside
not bc i'm happy to hear sad things--i'm not
but bc she felt comfortable enough to say them

i kno it can b hard to open up
i'm a closed up person
but i've learned more n more that its not too bad to let feelings out
u usually get good responses when u do
n if the not special ppl respond harshly or not at all, not even relate
u always have the special ppl to respond as one should
w a word of kindness n a hug that everything will b alright"

relationships mainly
it's as if i'm the listening analyzer
it doesnt matter if i kno u or not
today was the most classic example
i talked w my cuz's friend about her best boy friend who she lost her chance with n she's hung up on
i listen 
give all the options
the line ""i dont kno y i'm tellin u all this""
n my response
its ok this is what ppl do
i dont mind that
an old friend who has parents that want her to get married to now a 30 year old
she's only 20
""ty for listening to my whining""
i dont mind thats what i do
n its cool
maybe it bc i dont jump down ur throat or get frustrated

weirdest one...well mayb not
i was drivin along on the LIE lookin for cops in the rear view mirror as i always do then all of a sudden there are two motorcycle cops behind me...then a police car comes in front of me..i pull over n stop..then it seems like the whole police force surrounds me..like 100 cops or somethin...n they all get out n point their guns n rifles at me...i was like all i was doin was speeding...so this butch women comes up to my car takes her hands n pulls up the hood of my car like she was superman...she pulls out 3 sticks of dynamite n throws them away...they blow up...she fixes my hood n says u better bring it to a detailing place....hmmm

then another one was cute n funny n scary
me n sweetie were walking in the middle of the street
sweetie was in a hooded sweatshirt and it was cold
shes like its cold
so i put my arms around her while we're still walking trying to warm her up
rubbing her shoulders and arms to get her warm
then i look behind me and there's like 11 ppl...i dont kno why i say 11 but for some reason in the dream i remember that
they were all looking at us
some sayin awww's n some saying what r u doin and others were acting like the paparazzi
it was real weird we were tryin to get away

"event","visiting my grandmother everyday in the hospital has caused me to dislike her more and more. some will say she has every right to whine, which there is some truth to, but honestly her arms still have some use. do this for me. move this blanket. pick up the pillow. wet my lips. if she becomes stagnant and a lump...that's not good for anyone. i love her...i really do, but she must get some will power. fight...because i'm sure as hell fighting for you...or how does the line go. and my grandfather continues to talk while i'm trying to read the new yorker...brings a box of little puzzles and brain teasers he made. why don't you not bother me. oh you're just teasing. that'll never happen. crisis inevitably makes you get annoyed at who you're in crisis with, but makes you have a stronger bond as well. when does the annoying stage end. or has it not truly begun yet? tear"

"event","stress builds and builds to a breaking point
my grandmother has been in the hospital
she had surgery tuesday night into wednesday morning
the doctors tell you 3-4 hours
then it gets to 5, 6, 7...you're wondering what's going on
pacing, walking miles
it's 2 o'clock
i hope nothing went wrong
staying positive for the other family members
they're just doing a good, thorough job
ok
doctor comes
she's fine
just had a million different organs taken out of her
more than we expected
you try to feel relief
but i guess the only relief is that the surgery is over
family breaking down and crying
continue to stay strong
but at what point is it ok to not be strong"

back and forth back and forth
they're coming
my vacation is ruined
i said it would never happen again
and its happening
can't handle the stress right now so she says
bs
she just wants to police us
the nights will be miserable
thank god its a big boat
it's easy to get lost i hope
so i'm paying to be miserable
they should at least pay
grin and bear it
not surprised
puts you through all the s***
and then she's coming anyway
so now it will suck on both accounts
i won't have fun
and she'll be pissed and unpleasant
my bro's about to rebel totally
he's tired of her meddling and i agree
maybe a few shocks to her system will fix it
but i can't do that"

things fall down and don't get put together
my relationship with my mother is in shambles now
i honestly think she's turning crazy
a lot of stress at the present
but i don't know
me and my bro are going on a cruise on sat
she's known about it for months
but it's only in the past week that she's put on the guilt trips to really want to go
and oh what guilt trips
the crying
i've done so much for you and you hate me
how could you not want me to go
i bow in at the crying
but she's not going because of my bro
he won't say he wants her to go
she calls him evil
but last time it was terrible
it was like we were policed
but i'm not a criminal

as the peacemaker as always i try and make amends
then say stupid things
the guilt gets to a point where you want her to go
because you know how miserable it'll be once we're back
i really won't mind if they went i think
but i won't find out because as of now they're not
one day could change that
i just don't care one way or the other anymore
no matter what it'll be miserable"

shave naked
talk naked
all running around
put a towel on or something
underwear...anything
fat people
all saggy
i really don't get it
would it be such an inconvenience to put on a towel
i think it takes more effort to walk around naked than with clothes
what age is it that you say i just don't care anymore
yuk

tear
tear
i am back in the living world
after a few days straight of sleep of course
over the past 2 weeks i've gotten maybe 24 hours of sleep
my bed is calling me and i can't resist
it was such a tempter
now i'll let go and give in
i haven't done anything but work in the last month
neglected friends
the past few weeks neglected meetings
i have talks coming up 3 weeks in a row
and then i'm writing a public talk
so it doesn't stop does it
they'll always be something to do


time to rejuvenate and get some feeling back
i haven't had fun in a few weeks
i miss it"

soooo out of practice
i just tried
a nervous mess
it worked
but i felt so awkward
i practically offered a bribe to the guy
he said fine and i just kept coming with excuses
it was already cool
but i was not
and now that i look back
i think i even said some insulting things
he's irish and i kept talking about drinking
implying that he's a big drinker
but i can't be like that when i don't really know the person
what the hell am i doing
i could take a B and turn it into an A
or be able to hand in something a month late
i had history, was loved
now its as if i fear them
it takes some pressure off
i wish someone else can take the other burdens"

"event","so i'm actually considering it
a whole year extra
i have a scholarship so money isn't holding me back
it's a master's degree
i'd be guaranteed at least 60 grand coming out
i would never have to go back to school
but then there's always the negatives
another year of school
i was really looking forward to being half done
if i make it five years its like going through high school all over again
i'll get out when i'm 23
only 2 years to live
every girl worth getting is already taken
and you're not suppose to date unless your ready for marriage
and w/out a job...you're not ready for marriage
another year in this school means 2 years of aging
i'm tired of papers and homework
i've had enough for a few lifetimes
for kicks i looked at the princeton review describing my school
comments: people lose sleep and have a hell of a lot of work to do
i should have read that before i came here
another year that i'm unhappy
i hadn't planned to go 5 years
i hope my cash doesn't run out if i do go
my whole life i saved a good amount of money
but its amazing all the years you save and then how fast you go through it
and will it really be that much of an advantage in getting a job
and will i make that much more money with a masters
or is a year of experience better
how much more will i really learn in one year
aren't i sick of school already
why would i even consider going another year
why am i even thinking about this now when i have so much work to do in the week and half left
and won't i be winning 10 million dollars this summer so i don't have to worry about this"

"event","i should have gone to the art school
the only thing that's holding me back is the fact that i'm not an artist which you would kind of need since the art school is the hardest school to get into in the country
but they're always doing much more interesting things 
every week they paint the lobby and do something new
now all the windows are blacked out and they put a new wall with a mural being painted
we make robots and models of robots and design structures
i've got to get out of here
i think i've repeated that phrase so many times
but i never follow through
maybe i'll just fail
that way i don't have to decide if i want to stay or not"

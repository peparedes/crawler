I got a cool filled cupcake pan, and it came with the recipe for cupcakes, the vanilla filling and chocolate icing.  While the cake is mediocre at best, the icing recipes are awesome.  I'm tired of saving the paper that came with the pan, so I'm entering the recipes here, so I can find them on my tablet.  Using the tablet has become my new favorite way of having a recipe handy in the kitchen.  

Cupcakes:
2 1/4 c (270g) flour
1 3/4 c (350g) sugar

1 1/4 tsp baking soda
1 tsp salt
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 tsp almond extract

"event","As you may or may not know, I now work in a pain management clinic.  We manage chronic pain, both with interventional injections and with medications.  I'm pretty much on the medication side.  Because it's a specialty clinic, we have more time to spend with our patients than I did as a family doctor.  I find this a bit disheartening for the state of primary care in the US.  There is no time to develop relationships, to actually get to know and understand the patient's outside influences on his health.  Granted, it might not be as important for a runny nose or allergy season, but it's profoundly important when treating a patient's pain.
Anyway, I have a patient I've been seeing for about a year with his atypical face pain.  He's had his ups and downs and he's a patient who doesn't really do well to cover up when he's feeling down or blue.  Last month, when he came for his medication appointment, he was down and I asked him why that was.  He said he'd been trying to get into touch with a buddy of his from his Marine Corps days and he was having problems finding his friend.  They served overseas together in Japan, and he know that his friend lived in the area.  This is not uncommon in North Carolina, plenty of Marines from 2MEF that were stationed in Jacksonville, NC, wind up retiring down here.  With Jacksonville's Marine Corps base and Ft. Bragg in Fayetteville, I've spent the last 10 years treating a number of military and their families.
Anyway, Mr Smith, as we'll call him, told me it was making him feel down that he couldn't find his friend who had an unusual name.  When he told me the name, I asked to confirm the friend's first name and asked if he had an Asian wife.  Indeed it was the same person I had seen as a patient for about 4 years in Angier, NC.  
I didn't know how to get in touch with his friend, my former patient, but I knew someone who still worked for my former employer and so I called her that night.  I hadn't spoken to her in over a year.  We caught up on our families, our lives, and then she told me she would try to find some information and call me back.  I had not heard from her in several weeks, so I assumed she had not found anything.
Today, at my office, I got a call from my former patient.  He told me how he was doing, that he was planning on moving up to Washington, DC, in August to a veterans retirement village and that he's doing well.  He and his wife are now divorced, unfortunately, but still friends and remain in the area.  He confirmed that he did, indeed, know my current patient, and I passed on the phone number.
About an hour or 2 ago, I got an email from my former patient.  He had his friend, my current patient, had been able to connect on the phone and spent some time catching up.   He thanked me for following up, and thanked me again for being his doctor at least for a while.
It just reminded me that a network is not about facebook or blog updates.  It's not about screaming on the internet about what you think and feel.  It isn't about sitting at a computer, looking at pictures.  While it has been a great bit of fun to reconnect with people from another time in my life, my real network is more grounded, less wired, less web enabled. 
My network is about real connections, being part of people's lives, even in small ways.  It's about paying attention sometimes. 
I love facebook and blogs.  I'll keep using the internet to kill monsters, read news stories, find charitable actions, and rage against injustices and bad grammar.  But I am so much more richly rewarded having been able to speak to that former patient, to put him in contact with his old friend.  The initial impact we have on one another maybe small at first, but the ripple of energy from that impact can become enormous.  And that gives me great joy."

But today is a monumental day.  It was Ella's first day of school.  
Real school.  Not pre-K, not daycare that calls itself school.  But bona fide, she could have ridden the school bus and she had to take lunch money with her school.  
We did the open house thing on Tuesday, but that just didn't prepare her, it seems for the bells that would ring and say ""parents, it's time to leave.""  She's been in a pre-K that allowed parents to stay for circle time and allowed us to pick her up whenever.  
But now?  Now she has to be there by 7:55 and she gets picked up at 2:15. 
She has a seat with her name on it, a cubby with the same, she has lines she has to stand in and schedules that have to be followed.
She's a child, not a baby."

"event","So about 5 years ago, I was hanging out at the James Joyce, which is a bar I once frequented in Durham.  The bouncer there and my best friend were madly flirting with one another.  One night, said bouncer's roommate showed up at the bar.  ""Keely, this is my roommate, Noah.""  

Nice to meet you's and such were exchanged.
Over the next few months, we saw each other more, hung out more, etc.  A mutual friend said ""I think you should hook up with Noah"" and I looked at him in a whole new way.  Suddenly, where he was the friend of a friend, he became a prospect.

Well, 3 months of flirting later, I was getting nowhere, so I gave up.  More or less.
The 30th of December, Lou and I were headed out and we called Noah to come meet up with us.  Laura drove, so my car was at her place.  After a while of hanging out, she claimed she was tired and she left me with him to give me a ride to my car.

He gave me a ride back, and we sat in his car talking for a while, and I realized that if he didn't kiss me right that second, it was hopeless.  And thankfully, he did.  And continued to kiss me for about 4 hours.  Sometime around 5am, I made him take me to the gas station up the street to use the bathroom and get a couple of bottles of water.  We went back to our parking spot and we made out some more.  Everyone kept their clothes on, it was just good, old fashioned making out in the car.  Around 7:30 we went to Honey's.  It's a greasy spoon sort of place for people to go to sober up after the bar closes.  The waitress brought us our eggs and toast and called us lovebirds.

We had a very rocky start, me and Noah.  We even broke up a couple of times.  I missed my period at the beginning of April and it took 5 pregnancy tests to make me truly believe that I was pregnant.  I had just broken up with Noah 3 days before.  But as anyone who was around at that time knew, it didn't take.

We still had our rocky moments, but Ella came along and suddenly, Noah was making more trips to Holly Springs to see us, and things were changing.  Dad kept asking us why we weren't getting married, but it was complicated.  I wanted him to want me, not just to marry because we had a baby.  

Ella got bigger, Noah and I changed.  We hit another bump in the road here and there and one of them almost seemed to do us in.  But we found a way to work things out between us.  And it was that bump in the road that made him say out loud to me, ""You and Ella are the most important things in my life.""  While I thought maybe that could be the case, he'd never said it out loud before.

One day, Noah sits up in the bed and asks me to marry him.  I thought he was joking at first.  He had told me long ago that he didn't really believe in marriage.  He meant it when he asked me though.  And about 8 months later, we managed to tie the knot.  I finally moved in with him once and for all about 3 weeks later (although we pretty much were staying here all the time).  

Our first Valentine's day was spent at a bar, being mildly annoyed at something I'm not sure I remember what.  Our second was the day Ella got her first set of shots, and we watched movies at my house and played with our 2 month old.  I am not sure I remember all of them after that.  Last year was spent celebrating our recent wedding and attending the wedding of some friends.  

This year, I'm sitting in our home, looking at the beautiful roses he bought me, and watching him and Ella clean up the kitchen together, and thinking to myself, I am the luckiest girl I know."

"event","So as most of you may or may not know, my dad suffered a fairly large stroke on the 9th.  My mom and brother called me and kept me up to date through the night, but since I am the only provider in my practice, I couldn't just not go to work the next day.  I went to the office, told the staff and planned on going to DC Friday afternoon.  Unfortunately, my mom called me the next day during the day to tell me that they had put him on a ventilator and sedated him, and we just didn't know what was going to happen.  

I was upset about that, but still had patients to see, including the one who's room I had left in order to take my mom's call.  When I went back into the room, I was upset but holding it together.  I sent the patient to the lab, and then just needed to break down a little bit, so I went into the bathroom and cried.  Our employee bathroom is near the lab, and the patient heard me crying so she knocked on the door.  I opened it, and there stood this wonderful woman, who simply said, ""can I pray with you?""

I said yes and she hugged me and stood there with me and prayed with me about my dad, my tears, my anxiety, my travel for a good 10 or 15 minutes.

For whatever reason, I didn't tell anyone that until about a day ago.  I didn't realize how much it meant to me that my patients heal me as much as I try and help them.  I didn't realize how much it meant to me that this woman cared enough for me as a person, as a daughter, as a doctor to stop and treat me with the compassion and love I hope that I can show to the patients who come to me.  It just reminded me that we all have our broken hearts and our hurts and sometimes they just break through to the surface whether we want them to or not.  And it reminded me that I get as much healing from the people I see every day as I hope they do. 

It's one of the reasons I so love my job."

"event","A few years ago, my best friend fell.  She tripped coming in to her house and hit her head on a concrete step.  Hard.  Luckily, it didn't kill her, but she did get a pretty good concussion.  It was a hard enough hit that when she went into the house to get some ice, she passed out.  She called 911 and was seen at the hospital.  Unfortunately, several people she would have called for help were out of town, and she wasn't sure whom to call.  She did find a ride home from the hospital and she was (and is) fine.

However, she learned something from the process: it's scary to get hurt when you're alone.  What's even scarier is the people to whom you will subsequently tell your story after an event like this will break down into two groups: the ones who make it about you and the ones who make it about them.  She had several people (myself included, sadly) who, instead of asking ""oh, are you ok?"" asked her ""why didn't you call ME?""  She beautifully put this down by saying ""this isn't about you.""  

Why am I bringing this up now?  I had a patient come in to me last week who has recently been diagnosed with breast cancer.  She has surgery scheduled on Friday to remove her breast.  After that, they're going to find her an oncologist and decide if she needs radiation and chemo or just chemo.  They can't decide that until they stage out her cancer after the surgery.

After her initial diagnosis, she didn't tell anyone aside from her husband and daughters for a couple of days and she just went back to work.  Then she had to schedule the time out for the surgery and she had to tell someone at work.  From there it spread to her friends.  She was in my office last week in tears with the stress.  She wasn't there because of the stress of her diagnosis.  No, she came to see me because her friends and family are slowly driving her insane.  She can't sleep because of concern about the surgery, of course, but now she's also concerned about whether she's doing the right thing.  One friend will call and tell her she needs this.  Another will call and tell her she needs that.  ""You need an oncologist right now,"" one says.  ""Don't go see that guy, under any circumstances,"" another one tells her.  Do this, do that, no don't go there, go here, call them today.  It's all she hears all day long.

The most frequent call she has received in the week since her diagnosis?  ""Why didn't you tell me?""  She can't eat, she can't sleep and she cries all the time.  She's home from work, on sick leave, but she gets no reprieve because her phone is constantly ringing.  

Let me give you a little background, without violating her confidentiality.  I work, and she and her family live, in a small town.  She works for the school system.  She has 2 young adult daughters who were active in school.  She's lived here for the better part of her life.  She and her husband have an active life in this community and there are few people in this area she doesn't know or in some way have contact.  She's not a hermit in a cave.  She has friends and family in the area, and they all care for her.  And they all mean well.  But they are killing her emotionally with their well wishing.

So here's my advice to you when your loved one, friend, colleague, whatever gets a diagnosis.  Shut up.  I'm not saying not to support her.  I'm not saying not to care for her.  I'm saying just lay low for a while and let that person get her feet under her.  Let her make decisions with her family.  Don't give the unsolicited advice or tell her what she should do about her diagnosis.  Yes, your mother or sister or someone's cousin might have had this or that sort of experience with her breast cancer, but let each person take the path themselves.  Be there, but do it in a reasonable and non-intrusive way.

Some of us are crisis managers: we hear about an emergency and we kick into high gear and take over.  Some of us are crisis supporters: that same emergency drives us to drop off food or clean up someone's kitchen when they can't.  Sometimes we need one, sometimes we need the other.  Most of the time, though, what we really need is just to know that there is a manager if we need one and there is a supporter if we need one, but ultimately that we are loved.  We need to know that the love and support are there for us to draw upon when we're ready, not when it's forced down our throats.  That's not love and support, that's control.

Mostly, I believe, what we need when we're hurt or struggling is not to have someone make us feel guilty for not thinking about them.  We need people to understand that it's not about playing favorites or picking teams.  It's not about saying your the best friend or the 3rd best friend, it's about getting through a difficult time the best way we know how.  

On hearing of an emergency or hearing of an illness or a need second hand rather than directly from our friend in crisis, if your first thought is ""why didn't she call me?"", I challenge you to sit down, realize that it is not about you and that you have no right to make it about you.  I challenge you to leave a voice message, send an email or better yet a card in the mail that simply says, ""I love you.  I'm here and you can always call me for anything.""  And I challenge you to leave at that for a while.  Let your loved one adjust to the idea of the crisis and then call on you.  Don't push them to do something because YOU want it done.  

Just a little unsolicited advice."

Maybe it's just because my main toon is in a raiding guild and I never get to raid (Noah and I swap weeks when it's our turn to raid) and my other toons are in our fairly small social guild and we never really do much.  

Anyway, we've known that Champions Online was coming, and Noah, being the gaming nerd he is from long ago, was looking forward to it.  Well, it's in open beta right now and it's fun.  It's customizable from a character point of view.  Customizable to the point where you can spend your first hour of play not even in the game on the server because you're trying to make your costume look better or your character taller with hair that's slightly redder with dragon wings.  Or, you know, whatever.

There's leveling, questing, etc etc.  We've pre-ordered our copies from Best Buy since it does release in about a week or so.  Wow, not even a week, since it's already Friday.  

So, when I lose my job, I hope you guys will buy me some cool playtime cards for my various games, since they'll be my undoing anyway.  

The only problem is that, once again, I'm creating characters who need names.  But now instead of WoW names, they're super hero or super villian names.  Egad.  I'm just not that creative."

The other reason I didn't get to watch it was that our guild (my new one for my priest, The Dropouts) was too busy flailing about in 25man Ulduar.  We 2-shotted Hodir (despite the fact that he should be a very easy one shot if people just pay attention and free the NPCs), we one shotted everything else up to Thorim.  We didn't attempt Freya yet.  We wiped for a good hour on Thorim.  How annoying.  On 10 man, it's a cake walk.  On 25?  The tunnel group was too slow so by the time they finally stopped wiping and made it to Thorim, the arena group started wiping because we had 3+ minutes of adds totally mopping the floor with  us.  Sigh.  

So tonight will be another attempt.  I have a feeling we'll head for Freya first, just to see if we can't wipe on something else for a while before banging our heads against the Thorim fight again.  Our 10-man group got to Mimiron and we kept wiping last week.  Best we did was to get 1 segment down and the other 2 at 2% or less, but by then there was so much DPS down, we couldn't kill them fast enough to stop the self repair.  Sigh.  

In other news, my kid is still awesome.  You expected something different?

I wish I had other interesting news, but I don't."

"event","I know I never post.  And when I do it's usually WoW.  And this is no different.  Well, it's sort of different.  I'll start with the different stuff.

Life as a married woman doesn't suck.  No, really, it doesn't.  We have this happy little home, although right now it's a little worrisome as it has been raining all day (and now it's snowing) and we have a funk in the house.  We're trying to locate it, and we're not sure of the location, but we'll find it.  Or light enough candles to burn the place down.  But the home is still happy.  I'm officially a Godwin now, although ironically, Ella isn't not, since in order to change her name with social security, despite the fact that I married her father, whose name is on the birth certificate, we have to do a legal name change.  Which means posting our intention to change her name on the courthouse bulletin board for 10 days and then getting it all legal and THEN changing it on her SS card.  Pain. in. my. ass.  

Other than that, it's all good.  I can't remember to sign godwin though.  I sign Burns all day long at work, and that occasional check or credit card receipt?  It just gets the Keely Bu--Godwin signature.  Sigh.  The trials and travails are many when you're happily married.

Speaking of travails, my work does, indeed, suck right now.  Between the late peaking flu season and the EMR from hell, it's just been a monster every day to try and be on time.  People are waiting up to an hour and a half to be seen in my office, which I find unacceptable.  It just isn't ok with me for people to wait that long to see me, whether they have an appointment or not.  Especially, however, if they do.  I'm not sure of the answer, although I have some solutions for the EMR issue, just not the late peaking flu issue.  That's for God, nature and some good old fashioned hand washing to take care of.  

As to the WoW, I'm now level 80 on 3 charactes, although really only one of them is well geared in any way.  She's my ret pally.  It hurts my feelings when people ask me to tank or heal.  I want to smush up faces.  I don't want to tank or heal.  My husband's (squee!) main character, who was once our guild main tank is now dps spec, and he tanks the lower instances, but he doesn't much care for it either.  There will be joy in mudville when the dual spec comes out.  In the meantime, since our guild is small and not doing much in the way of raid progression (we get through about half of 10 man naxx on a good night, since people have to clear out early), we spend most of our time with the world PvP.  As Noah puts it, we have a big PvPness.  (We can't take credit for that, there's a guild on our server called Has a Big PvPness.  I'm only sorry we didn't think of it first.)  But now there are a couple of infamous gankers on our server who pretty much universally respond to the call of ""there are jerks from Dead Zeppelin ganking in [insert zone name here]"" and that makes us happy.  And dead a lot.  With ridiculously long resurrection timers, but hey, it's why we didn't roll on a carebear server.

So if you're alliance on Eredar, we will probably kill you if we see you and the fight looks reasonably winnable or even just fair.  We don't pick the fights that are unwinnable, I mean, what fun is that?  Anyway, it's now nearly 1am, we've been ganking all evening, the snow is on the ground, the candles in the house to dispel the funk are lit, and I still haven't any idea if I'm working tomorrow or not.  Harnett county schools are stupid and dont' announce until the last minute so I'm sure I'll be up at 7, calling the staff asking how the roads are and letting them know that even if they schools aren't, we will be on a 2 hour delay.  Awesome, that'll keep everyone happy.

What I don't understand is why, when the road you're on is completely clear, has been scraped and sanded and salted, you feel like driving 15 MPH is ok.  If you are so very anxious about driving in cold weather, don't do it.  Cancel the appointment you're not rushing to make on time, gerrymander your schedule a little so you can stay home.  That way those of us who are ok with driving 45 MPH on the 55MPH road can actually get to work less than 2 hours late.  

Now, had the road been icy, had the thing not been obviously covered in salt, I can get that.  But it wasn't.  Sigh.

"event","So I swore I'd start writing down when Ella says or does awesome things, because, well, a) she does it all the time and 2) I know I'll forget that she was so damn awesome.  Well, not entirely, but I'll forget the details.

So tonight, we put her in her bed with the usual fight: I have to get some water, I need medicine for my cough (I say ""you're not coughing"" and she fakes a cough), I need to go potty, I need you to read me one more book (followed by reading the book up until the penultimate page where she says ""I don't like this book"" and gets another--she doesn't think I've caught on to that trick yet).

So after reading the last book (If You Give a Moose a Muffin), she gets in bed and I come out to the living room to play wow with my husband and with some friends of ours.  Soon, I see the child standing on the steps to the living room with her duck costume hat on (from when she was 10 months old for Halloween 06) and she says she has to go potty.  I take her potty, she does her thing and as I'm putting her back into her bed, her face lights up and she says, ""I totally sneaked out of bed and into your room.  And no one saw me.""

I laugh and say ""yes, you totally did.""  And then I realize what she's said.  She sneaked into my room.

She then says ""I put my money in your room.""  At that point she gets up, we go into my room and she has hidden a couple of play coins from her toy piggy bank in a slipper on my nightstand.  And she shows them to me.  Then she shows me a real quarter and says, ""I put this in my mouth.  I know it's trouble.""  

At that point, she walks back into her bedroom, climbs in her bed and lies down.

Seriously, come ON."

"event","So, Geithner is probably going to get confirmed as secretary of treasury.  The guy didn't pay his own taxes.  He didn't ""forget"" or ""make a mistake"".  He actively evaded paying his taxes.  For a couple of years.  And everyone is just patting him on the back.  They're saying ""oh, well pay it now and it'll be fine.""  So he pays the taxes and the interest, but shockingly got no penalty (which would have been and is hefty, but somehow doesn't apply to him. . . .why?).


We've been so dumbed down to believe that there's a crisis and because of that, we need to sweep him under the rug.  Give me a break.  The guy is IN CHARGE of collecting taxes.  He will be the leader of the IRS.  He doesn't even pay his own.  And it wasn't like it was one year that he made a mistake and underpaid.  He hadn't paid his taxes for several years and was told in 2006, that's right nearly THREE years ago, that he had to pay these taxes and but then he never did.  He willfully avoided and evaded paying his taxes.  It wasn't an honest mistake.  An honest mistake is saying, in 2006 when it was pointed out by the IRS when he was audited, ""oh, I better pay those now.""  It is not avoiding paying them for another couple of years and then literally days before the announcement of your nomination to Treasury Secretary paying them, which is what happened in this case.

Why is he still even being considered?!?  Why are we still talking about him.  Remember a few years ago, back in the day when Bush nominated someone for something (I hate that I don't remember the details--they are so vague that I can't even remember if it was 41 or 43 who did it) and it turned out that her nanny was an illegal and that totally canned her nomination?  Remember that?

So now here's Geithner, who is guilty of tax evasion (and by the way, how do I get hit with a penalty for just paying late a couple of months, and he gets no penalty for not paying at all for YEARS?), as well as the fact that he, too, had an illegal for a nanny and we're sitting here saying that he's going to be SecTreas?

I swear to you that if a republican administration had tried to nominate this guy, his nomination wouldn't have even made it to committee, let alone passed committee or have been an option for more than a week.  

Does it strike no one else as odd that the guy Obama wants to put in charge of the treasury and therefore the IRS and tax collection and enforcement is a guy who isn't even ethical enough to pay his own taxes?  The phone lines should be on fire with people calling their senators to shoot this guy down.  And yet we're all so damn euphoric about the historical events this week that we fail to see that this is important.  We're so busy trying to tell ourselves that it's all going to be okay now that we're overlooking what it will take to make it ok.  And that includes putting people into a position that at least have a modicum of appropriateness for their position.  A guy who willfully evades his taxes is not the right guy for the Treasury.

A woman who's husband has a foundation that receives millions of dollars in contributions from foreign leaders (including dictators) is not the right woman for State.  And don't give me the crap about the agreement that the Clintons had with the Obama transition team about their transparency.  There is no more transition team, so that agreement is now null.  That smacks of conflict of interest.  

And yet, once again, in this era of hope and change, whatever that means, we're going to let her skate on through and be Secretary of State.  

I submit that once again, if this were a republican administration, there would be screaming and shouting and gnashing of teeth and neither of these nominations would have a leg to stand on for more than a few minutes.  But we're so busy as a nation worshiping Obama and deifying him that we can't see past it to truly evaluate the team he's putting into place.

""Double standard,"" you say?  
Why yes.  
Yes, I do say."

"event","So snow has come to NC.  We got a couple of inches last night and we're expected to maybe get another inch during the day.  However, since it's supposed to be 55 on Friday.  I thought Montana had some turbulent weather changes.  Apparently NC is much more erratic.

Anyway, just my luck, on my one snow day, it's patch day and the servers are down until 1pm.  Curse you, Blizzard and your Tuesday morning patchiness.  I guess there's never a good time to take all the realms offline, but damn.  Why did it have to be my snow day?  Why couldn't it have been last week?

So, instead, I get to play with my family and drink coffee and eat biscuits and enjoy the fire in our woodstove.  Ella went outside to play in the snow and she thought it was pretty cool.  Well, cold actually.  And she's not sure she likes it as much as she thought she would.  She does like to stand at the door and admire it, though.  As do I. 

Speaking of Ella, she has decided that sprinkles go on everything.  She's had sprinkles on pancakes, on toast, on her grapes (that didn't work so well), on her cheese toast and on her pizza.  She prefers the easter bunny sprinkles, but she'll take just about any of them.  Today she's having a red and green sugar sparkles sandwich.  we opened up a biscuit and put red on one side and green on the other, and now she's amazed at how they mix together when you put them together.  Ah, to be 3 and have a love for sprinkles such as she does.  

In other news, I'm just about done moving all of my stuff into our Durham house and ready to sell the Holly Springs house.  That makes me so happy you have no idea.  I need to get rid of my big ole horizontal file cabinet.  I think I might put it up on craigslist or freecycle.  I just want it to go away.  

In other WoW news, my pally is about 2/3 of the way through 78 and Noah's lock is about 60% of the way through 77.  That means that we can fly around in Northrend, finally, and we can mine to our heart's content.  We used to split the nodes so we could both get points, but I guess that's changed with today's patch (thankfully).  However, now we have to shift-right click when we hit it so it doesn't get looted but you do get the point.  And then the next person can loot it.  That's how we both did our herbalism back when we were rushing to 70 on our priest/shammy combo.

I will say that having a ret pally and an affliction lock run around makes for some ridiculous fun world PvP.  I am gankarrific.  I see no reason not to.  I like to play, I like to play other players.  And I like it when we will kill someone and his level 80 friend comes to help and we kill that guy too.  It doesn't always work out that way, but damn, having 2 stuns on my character and 2 fears on Noah's makes it a lot easier for us to manage the inevitable 80 human ret pally that shows up to put us in our places.  And then kill him.

My new favorite?  Ganking people in the little quest posts where it looks like the people there might be guards and aggro you, but they don't.  And before I open up with my hammer of justice and judgment of command, I like to say ""hi, we're the assholes your friends are talking about in general chat.""

It's the little things that make me happy."

"event","So there's so much to talk about, wedding wise, and no one really wants to hear all about it, frankly.  I mean, people ask you how the wedding was, but they don't want the details, they just want to know it was beautiful.  So, well, it was beautiful.

We had a couple of dramas (minor, of course):
My brother and sister in law forgot their hanger bag with his suit and her dress.  God bless Nordstom's for being open on New Year's day and having same day tailoring.  They both looked wonderful.

Noah's brother was a little late, but he showed up, looking as handsome as could be and ushered like a champ.

The family pictures were lacking a little in the form of the brothers but we made up for it later, so we have lots of shots.

I have a review site for the pro pictures (my friend Leslie is awesome!) at www.godwin.weddingherald.com and we got all the pics from the table top cameras loaded to the flickr site (www.flickr.com/photos/keelamonster).

I will give one piece of advice to any and all of you attending weddings where these cameras are sitting on the tables: Don't take pictures of the bride and groom, unless they ask you to.  We didn't ask either way, but the truth is this: we had a pro to take pictures of us.  She did a great job and her pictures have more light and are suited to the light in the room at the reception.  What most brides and grooms want with those pictures are pictures of the guests.  The pro, unless they're making the rounds to every single table (and in our case, we did no assigned seating, so she didn't), isn't going to get pictures of all the guests.  And that's what you find lacking when you're going through all the pictures at the end.  We wanted pictures of the people attending, we got lots of pictures of us.  

Oh, well, the pictures we do have of our attendees are great, and we have a few extra pics of us.  Not exactly the end of the world.

Oh! Another piece of advice: if you write a check for a bride and groom, write it to Bride OR Groom, not Bride and Groom. We don't have a joint account yet, and if it hadn't been for the teller at the bank being a patient of mine, I think it would have been difficult to cash/deposit the checks.  Granted, we're going to put each other on the accounts, but it would have been a tremendous pain.  

So far the best check we got so far?  The one from Keir and Elena that was written for 101.09.  Since we got married on 1/01/09.  Cutest ever?  Probably."

I had already chosen one reading, ""I Love You"" by Roy Croft.  And then I was going to do the Invitation by Oriah Mountain Dreamer, but then both of those are fairly long.  And the second reading is after the vows and rings and things, and I just want to get to the kissing scene, so I'm not sure we need a long reading at that point.  

So I was poking around on the internet, and I found the words to ""It's You I Like"" by Mr. Rogers.  That's right, THAT Mr. Rogers.  And I think it's going to be our last reading.

<i>	 It's you I like,
It's not the things you wear,
It's not the way you do your hair--
But it's you I like
The way you are right now,
The way down deep inside you--
Not the things that hide you,
Not your toys--
They're just beside you.

But it's you I like--
Every part of you,
Your skin, your eyes, your feelings
Whether old or new.
I hope that you'll remember
Even when you're feeling blue
That it's you I like,
It's you yourself,
It's you, it's you I like. </I>

What doesn't make me sad, though, is that Noah's roommate has finally moved out of the house.  So the only people living in the house right now are us.  Our wee family.  Two dogs, a cat, a toddler and 2 adults.  I love it.  We're talking about paint and flooring and ovens and heat pumps and it's like a house we can live in for a long time.  That makes me happy.  i'm not sure I thought we'd live there for a long time, but I can see it working out that way.

I've been so focused on wedding things that I forget that Christmas and New Year's is coming.  Eeep.  Not to mention the child's birthday.  We're not planning a party for her, but she seems to think we should have one.  With cake.  And presents. And no pacifiers.  She knows that when she hits 3, she can't have her paci anymore. We're working on that.  

Speaking of wedding things, I think I'm pretty much at a point where it's all little things now.  My dress is at the tailor's being altered to be perfect.
The bridesmaids have their dresses and have chosen their various tailors for alterations.
The tuxes are chosen and the guys are going to get fitted on their schedules any time between now and the 18th.
THe flowers are ordered and 2 of my 4 bridesmaids are beside themselves with joy at the idea of assembling bouquets, corsages and boutonnieres. 
The cake is being made by a friend's mom and I've finally decided on a style.
The shoes just arrived yesterday and they fit and aren't awful to wear all day (although I'll wear them on my spare time to make sure they aren't awful for real).
I got new make up
I got a hair cut
Ella's dress is hanging in the closet.
The toasting flutes are in the charge of the bridesmaids for engraving.


I have short list of things I need to get, most of which will be at a craft store:
Guest book and pen
flower girl baskets
arch for the front of the ceremony
favors


The only things I'm finding problematic are the last reading and the programs.  I can't do the latter until I figure out the former.  I thought I had one I liked but the more I think about it, the less I like it.  So I'm working on that still.  Suggestions are welcome.  (the first reading is ""I love you"" by Roy Croft.)  Also, I'm waiting to hear how many people are planning on coming to the rehearsal dinner so I can order to food for that.  

Also, why don't people RSVP?  I have a bunch of people who assume that I know they are or aren't coming but haven't RSVPd.  It confuses me.  I mean, I put the card in there with a self addressed stamped envelope and everything.  How hard is it drop it in the mail?  Sheesh.  Ah, well.

Other than that, the wedding seems to be on cruise-control.
How weird is that?

Anyway, Ella had plans and she wasn't going to be deterred, so I drugged up, went home and found the love of my life making bacon.  It's apparently the magical cure for Strep.  

Ella wouldn't eat supper because she wanted candy.  So I told her to at least eat some bacon.  Her response?

""Princess don't eat bacon, Mommy.""
""What do they eat, Ella?""
""Cereal.""
""What kind of cereal do princesses eat?""
""Froot Loops.""

So she had cereal for supper.  It's hard to argue with an almost 3 year old in white tights and white shirt with sparklies on her face waiting to put on a princess dress to go trick or treating.  

Her wee friend Kayla came over in her vampire costume, and we headed over to Piggy's house.  When we got there, the princess and the vampire knocked on the door and Danny came out of the house just as scary as could be and gave them each candy.  Ella reached into her bag and said, ""Candy! Open it.""  I told her that we could eat it when we were done.  That we can't eat it now.

She looked at me and said, ""I'm done.""

She had come for candy, gotten her candy and she was finished. 
About 4 houses further up the road (once we convinced her to come with us), she announced that this was not enough candy.  She also made a point to tell people that she wanted ""that one"" while pointing in the candy bowl.

Yep, she's a halloween vet now.  Whenever we see a sparkly dress or go to Piggy's I think she'll want to go trick or treat."

"event","I could make the excuse that we have no internet here, but that's a lie.  We've been playing the WoW, of course.  But really, I haven't been reading because I'm at the beach and loving my life and having too much fun.

Thanks for the birthday wishes many people sent via facebook and myspace and whatnot.  I have been having an absolutely fabulous time this year at the beach.  THe house is perfectly cozy and has great decks for lolling on.  And for LOLing on.  We've drunk pretty much all of the cheap champagne and probably most of the orange juice that the local Food Lion had.  We've eaten awesome food, as one of the guests this year is the chef at <a href=""http://www.ruecler-durham.com/"">Rue Cler</a>.  We've watched movies, played tetris, played Wii, played WoW.  We've played Zendo and Rummy and scrabble and boggle. We've made towers on the beach, been griped at by our busybody neighbor about the dogs and we've just had a deliciously beacheriffic time.  

I'm getting married in 72 days to a man who shocked me by deciding to shave off his goatee/beard and came out of the house yesterday looking like a whole new person.  I've watched my kid grow into this week at the beach like she should live here, just like we should.  

I hate that we have to go home tomorrow and I'm sad that I have to take Dave L to the airport today.  But all in all?  What a damn awesome week and birthday I have had."

"event","So, I finally have caught up to Noah.  He's 3 level 70s and now so do I.  My <a href=""http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Eredar&n=Frogstalker"">troll hunter</a> finally hit 70 on Thursday night.  There was much rejoicing.

The problem is that now she still has pets in their high 60s and it's scary to think of taking a pet at lower level to a place like Kara.  But I took her to the first fight on Kara anyway.  And then nothing else, save for the chess fight.  Where the kick ass plate healing legs dropped for my pally.  Who was, ahem, not there for that fight.  Talk about disappointing.  

To make matters worse, we have never seen the bow drop off of Prince.  Guess what dropped last night?  My paladin just wept on behalf of my hunter.  

In any regard, in case you haven't noticed, Blizzard has finally allowed PvE to PvP server transfers.  Even after the 100s of posts on the forums saying it would never in a million years happen.  I suspect it's a ploy (like all of the other changes they're making) to get people to enjoy playing their characters and get them leveled up so they'll all run out and shell out the cash for the expansion.  Which comes out Nov 3, btw.  The beyonce has already told me that he has every intention of making us wait in line at a game store at midnight on the 2nd to get it.  I told him he should stop smoking crack.

Anyway, now he's transferred his 49 hunter that he leveled on a PvE server before he knew that PvE was just silly.  The problem is that he has no name for that hunter.  On the other server, his name was Riverdance, because that's what he thought the orc dance looked like (and now that he realizes it's the dwarf dance and not the orc dance, he wants a new name--not to mention it's already taken on our server).  He's having a miserable time of thinking of a name.  He has these naming conventions: it should fit the character and race and class and should be at least a little amusing.  He's got an undead mage named Nukular, an undead warlock named Morebrains and his druid is a little out of that convention since it's the name of a character in a book he likes (Erekose).  He's been pondering it for a couple of days.  It's driving him a little bit nuts, to be honest.  And that cracks me up.

At least I have my girlfriend naming convention I can use.  Although Frogstalker and Tinkerbull aren't exactly in that, they're just really good names.

So, any suggestions for an orc hunter's name?"

"event","Life is interesting.  My fiance's (beyonce, as I like to call him) sister is being prepped for a c-section as we speak.  He (the beyonce, that is) is in the shower so we can get down there and visit the two of them (now that the baby will be on the outside) and ooh and aah over a new baby in the family.

This is the new baby that will be Ella's cousin.  However, she believes this little boy will be her baby sister.  Explaining the family tree to the child is more trouble than it seems to be worth on some days.  However, it's fairly cute when Laura asks Ella if she wants a little brother and Ella's response is, ""I already have a little brother.""

Come on.

My cat is now residing at the house of said beyonce.  I brought him over (the cat that is) last night when we got the hurricane watch and warnings.  Mostly because if Hanna or however they're spelling her name decides to decimate one or both of our houses, I'd like to be with all my critters, including my beyonce, my kid, my dog, and my cat.  

Speaking of dogs, the beyonce's dog died a week ago yesterday.  He was old (11 is old for a bulldog) and had been sick for a couple of weeks.  I had to be in WV at the Greenbrier for a wedding, so I wasn't here with Noah when Buster died, but we talked on the phone.  It broke my heart to hear Noah cry.  I don't much care for that part.  I miss that little bulldog, more than I thought I would.  Anyway, so now we're a 2 dog, 1 cat, 1 child and 1 roommate family all squishing into this 3 bedroom house.  A challenge, to say the least.  Not all of my stuff is here, of course, but I seem to be moving in one box at a time.

Again, a challenge.

Anyway, that's my life.  I'm staying clear of a lot of the politics just because I'm frustrated with everyone.  I'm frustrated with Obama's complete lack of knowledge of economics when he says things like ""I'll lower capital gains taxes on small businesses"" as if it's a tax break.  Small businesses don't pay capital gains taxes, they pay income taxes.  And he plans on increasing those.  Which will drive jobs offshore and tank the economy even more.  I'm frustrated that people jsut do not seem to understand that large corporations DO NOT pay taxes.  They collect taxes from their customers to pass on to the government and raising corporate taxes simply raises prices on the things and services we buy.  I'm frustrated with all the idiots who actually think that McCain picked Palin in order to ""woo Clinton supporters.""   He picked Palin because she's got a record of being strongly conservative and pro-life and she's been a spear header in the areas of reduced spending and ethics reform as governor of Alaska (something anyone will need following the Bush administration).  No one is stupid enough to think that because she's a woman she'll woo all the Hillary supporters.  

I do like, though that finally the party can say ""fuck you, we are NOT only a party of old white men.""  Which is, incidentally, exactly what Obama picked: an old white man who's in the pocket of big businesses like the RIAA.  Funny how people don't seem to care if someone has big business ties as long as they're not the oil industry.

Mostly, though, I keep it to simple things like that because my life is good.  I'm planning a wedding to a man I love, I'm raising a child I adore and am proud of and I work in a job I love most days.  Hard to complain too much.

And now, I'm going to try and find the NC Women's hospital so I can meet my new nephew.  I'm about to be an aunt!  Joy and celebration to follow."

"event","So, this weekend.  I was actually looking forward to it, and have been for a while now.  My friend, Lily is getting married.  She's getting married at the <a href=""http://www.greenbrier.com/site/"">Greenbrier</a> in WV.  Now, WV isn't a great draw for me, per se, but the resort is freaking awesome.

It's so awesome that they have the entire resort property blurred on google satellite maps.  You can do that, apparently, if you want to be super private.  And at the rate of these rooms and spas and such, I want to be that private.


Anyway, it's our first wedding we're attending since our own engagement.  My parents and my  brother and sister in law will be there.  Brad and Danielle and their 2 kids will be there.  It's going to be a ball.

Other than the fact that Noah's 11 year old dog, Buster, is sick.  Buster has had a couple of weird scares and we thought he was going to die earlier but he didn't and then he got sick again 2 weeks ago (3 years after the first ""he'll die in 3 months"" proclamation) and he just hasn't managed to bounce back like last time.  He's miserable all the time, and and he can't see for crap and he's just not well.  Probably dying.  And we're okay with it, other than being sad, it's the way life is.  He's 11.  He's a bulldog.  These things are expected.

The problem is that Noah is feeling really weird about having Chris, his roommate, hospice sit his dog this weekend so now Noah's not coming with me.  So I get to go to another wedding on my own, I don't get to dance with my fiance in his gloriously handsome suit, and I wont get to show him off to my posh friends.  Which is fine.  

But I was just looking forward to having a date.  You know?  My date.  My fiance.  My Noah.
In a suit.  At a resort.

Anyway, I guess I'm on my way out of town now as my last patient today is not here yet and her appointment was at 2.  Why don't people keep their appoointment times?  I'm sure she'll roll up at 2:30 and wonder why the door is locked.

"event","So I'm the pee nazi mommy.  Here's the deal:
Ella is almost 3, right?  And she's basically potty trained.  And by basically, I mean we have a few accidents here and there, but she's a champ when it comes to the potty.  She has a couple of hang ups, and who doesn't?  

1--She will not pee in a public toilet that has the horseshoe shaped seat.  You know the ones, the aren't a complete seat.  I'm not sure why they make these seats, as they don't seem to serve some sort of purpose other than to try and get people who stand to pee or people who have issues with hitting the actual seat to not actually get any pee on the front part of the seat.  Whatever.  They terrify my 2 1/2 year old daughter.  I do not know why.  I have to basically cajole her into sitting on the seat, and even then it's sideways.  

2--She's also terrified of a potty with an automatic flush.  Hands-free flushing may be a revolution in sanitation and keeping people from peeing and leaving without flushing, not to mention avoiding getting people to use their feet to flush (don't laugh, I've seen it happen) and breaking the flush handle thingamabob.  But for our family, hands free flushing is a nightmare.  She is small, see?  And if she sits on the potty (which only happens if it's a complete circle of a seat), the little sensor thing sees her and then doesn't see her and flushes.  Usually just about the time she's relaxed enough to start peeing.  And the flushing while she's on it is basically terrifying for her as well.  Not, interestingly enough, scary enough to make her pee.  No, it makes her stop peeing and tell me she doesn't have to go potty and that she won't go there.

3--When I'm home with her alone or with her daddy, and I ask her if she has to pee, she says no.  If she's with just her daddy, she'll tell him that she has to go and that she'll do it ""by myself"" in her little sing songy toddler way.  And she does it by herself, like a civilized person, as Noah puts it.  When I'm there, no way is she going to go pee.  I have no idea why.  If I DO convince her to pee on the potty, she then tells me to ""go hide and I'll come find you.  I need privacy.""

I did not make that sentence up.  I hear it at least 4 times a day.

So lately, she's been doing this thing where she refuses to pee when I'm around and after a couple of hours and the typical 3 gallons of apple juice she insists she needs every night, she'll pee on the floor.  Or out on the patio.  Or on the lawn, making her announce ""I'm a doggy now, I pee outside!""  I'm getting tired of cleaning out panties.  And knowing that she only does this for me.

So finally a couple of weeks ago, Ella and I had our Come to Jesus Talk about peeing in her pants and panties when she can go to the potty like a big girl.  I basically told her that there would be no more trips to the donut store (sometimes we stop at dunkin donuts on the way to work if we're early) or the ice cream store (again, we stop on the way home sometimes if she's had a good week) or the loco-pops store.  These are her favorite little side trip treats.  I told her she wouldn't get anymore if she peed in her pants again when I've asked her if she has to go potty.  So told me to ""go away.  You're mad at me.""  Which, admittedly, I was.

For 2 weeks, it's been grand. She's had 1 or 2 ""didn't quite make it but it was only enough to get the pants a bit damp"" accidents.  But for the most part, there's been no accidents and we've had very little in the way of ""now you don't have any more panties because they're all in the washer right now"" days.

Last night, she went to bed late.  And part of her stalling technique involved finishing her Chick Fil A juice box before she could go to bed.  And going to the potty.  Three times.  So I was anxious about the pre-bed juice stop, but not much I could do about it after it was already consumed.  Around 12am, Noah and I are standing on the patio and we hear her shrieking. 

She's standing in her crib, crying and screaming about how she doesn't want to pee on her baby.  She has peed in the bed, soaking the sheet, her jammies, the blanket and yet somehow miraculously missing the doll she's worried about.  We grab her and I take her into the bathroom and she's telling me over and over she doesn't want her baby to have a bath, because she'll go down the hole in the bathtub (the drain) and get lost.  And then she looks at me and says ""i don't want to do it again.  I don't want to do it again.""  And sits on the potty and tries to pee for me so that ""please we can go to the loco pop store.""

Ouch, mama.

So try explaining to a 2 year old at midnight that peeing in her pants is bad but the bed is ok, when it's not really ok, but you want her to understand that you  know it was an accident and yes, we can go to the loco pop store.  

<i>sigh</i> this parenting thing is HARD."

"event","So I'm tired this week.  I'm not sure why.  We've been to bed fairly early for us every night this week.  Last night, not so much, since we didn't get in the bed until after 12, but we've gotten to see a bit of Colbert every night this week, which is sort of the way a guage the ""did we go to bed early enough"" question.  

Yesterday, Ella woke up at 6:15am.  We usually get up around 7.  I heard her on the monitor saying ""mommy, I'm awake."" The she started yelling ""daddy!  I need panties!  Daddy!"" She had apparently taken her clothes off in the crib.  I'm so glad she hasn't climbed out of her bed  yet.  I know she's old enough for a big girl bed, I'm not sure <b>I</b> am ready for her big girl bed.

Anyway, Noah--the man I love and am going to marry--got up with her, made her some grits, helped her find some panties (and clean ones that he washed when he did laundry, no less) and snuggled with her on the foofa while watching Blues Clues.  I got to sleep another 30 minutes, got up and took my shower, and went to the living room to find my awesome family having some awesome snuggle time.  I was jealous.

Every night this week, except for last night, the girl went to sleep without a pacifier.  Every morning she asks for it on the way to school but we don't have any in the car, so she just shrugs and accepts that she can't have it.  We haven't thrown ALL of them away, but we're working on it.  Right now when she asks for one, we have one that she doesn't much care for, and that's the one she gets.  Nine times out of 10, she gives it back and says ""no thank you.""

The wedding planning seems to be going swimmingly.  I've found my bridesmaid dresses: <img src=""http://s7d4.scene7.com/ir/render/AlfredAngeloRender/6280-600?wid=340&obj=main&sharpen=1"">  Imagine it in a darker blue.  It's gorgeous on my maid of dishonor, and I suspect will be on my other bridesmaids as well. Plus we found it for cheaper than most places in Burlington, NC.

And no, it wasn't the Burlington Coat Factory.

In other news, my hunger (Frogstalker) is level 63 and my rogue (Girlfiend) is level 24 and my druid (Tinkerbull) is level 29.  Yes, that's right, I am working on leveling 3 toons at a time.  I am nerd.  Hear me roar.  Or rather hear me sneeze.  It's allergy season.

Back to work, as I would like to be out of here in time to get home and lie on my fiance's foofa.  I want a club nap before tonight's Zul'Aman raid, since I'm so freaking tired, I suspect that falling asleep while healing the dragonhawk boss fight is a good way to wipe. 

And for those of you who don't play Wow, I know you just read that as ""blah blah blah I have no life blah blah blah"".  And I'm okay with that."

The point is this: my kid loves her some Blues Clues.  If you are familiar with it,you will find this story amusing; if you're not, I'll catch you up to speed.  Basically Blue is a dog who plays this game called Blue's Clues.  She puts a blue pawprint on clues, there are three of them, when you get the three clues, Steve puts them in his notebook and you have to guess what Blue is thinking about (what game she wants to play, what book she wants to read, what she wants for snack, etc).  Anyway, Steve goes traipsing around looking for clues, which are blue paw prints on various things.

So yesterday, I'm driving in the car and the car ahead of us is apparently owned by a Clemson fan.    The car has one of those orange paw print magnets on the back.   As we're sitting at the red light, Ella looks up and says ""Look, mommy!  I see a clue!"""

"event","So, planning a wedding can be fun.  Or not.  Depending on your proclivities.  And your fiance.  I have a list of people to whom I'm sending save the date cards/magnets.  Okay, they're magnets on cards.  They're very cute.  I like them.  I liked the first set I ordered that had the wrong date on them.  Not because the printers screwed up so much as I was so excited to be getting hitched that the minute we settled on a date and before we had actually FOUND a place, I ordered them.

I'll never make THAT mistake again.  Of course, I don't intend to be planning any more weddings any time soon.

Anyway, so I have the cards, and I've put most of them in envelopes and addressed them and put my return address stickers on them and our cute stamps that have our picture on them and whatnot.  And I have about 20 more than I thought I needed (this is a yay, since that means 20 fewer invitations to order) and I have about 8 that need addresses still.  Needless to say, they are Noah's people for whom I have no address.  And for 2 weeks now I've told him ""I need these addresses so we can send the save the dates to them.""  And he's said ""okay.""  

So far?  Zip.  The only ones I've procured since then are the ones for whom I managed to find a way to get into touch with said card receivers and asked myself.  So frustrating.  I wanted to send them all at once so no one can say ""why didn't I get a save the date card?"" but I've figured out that, well, I'm just going to say ""the hell with it"" and send them at the end of the week so that we can actually send most of them.  And the ones who don't get a card and call because they didn't?  Noah can get their addresses then.

Or not invite them, I guess.

Deciding on whom to invite and not invite is hard.  I mean, I feel like we can invite a lot of people because my dad is paying for the reception and all, but then again, I feel like I don't want to take advantage.  Also, it means people will be, essentially giving up a holiday for us, since the wedding will be on New Year's day.  So that means coming here on NYE.  Since we're cheap and we're having a noon wedding.  The reason for that is actually two-fold: 1--most people have the 1st off so it's not as big a deal to ask people to come in the middle of the day to Chapel Hill and watch us get hitched and 2--Ella's nap/bedtime.  It's a LOT easier for her to miss a nap and then go to bed early than it is for us to get her to bed after she's been up waaaaaay too late.  Plus then we don't have to worry about someone getting her to bed and all that while we're trying to celebrate at the reception.  I want her to be as big a part of as much of it as she can.  

Although honestly?  I'm sure she'll get tired of the whole thing by about 3:30 and be ready for a nap anyway.  

So, I'm going down my checklist and I think I'm doing okay given that I'm 6 months out:
Bridal party decided upon?  Check
Officiants roped into doing the ceremony?  Check
Location for ceremony and reception?  Check
Music for both?  Check
Save the dates ordered?  Check
Wedding dress?  Check
Food choices made for reception?  Check

Pretty much at this point it's all down to bridesmaid dresses, tuxes, buying wedding bands, flowers, invitations, programs, and the other minor stuff like gifts for the VIPs and all.

Dang, this is exciting.  I'm getting hitched."

But happy birthday, Dave!  I hope it was awesome, I'm sorry I missed it.  And I can't wait to see you at the beach."

"event","So after much searching and calling and math--I was told there would be no math--I have found a wedding venue!  And, handily, it also includes the reception venue.  I shall, in the words of one of my bridesmaids, be the envy of every UNC sorority girl, as I will be having my wedding and reception at the <a href=""http://www.carolinainn.com"">Carolina Inn</a>.  If you go to that website, then you should look at the virtual tour and the photo gallery for pictures of the Old Well Room.  That's the room for the reception.

The chancellor's ballroom is the site for the ceremony and they're offering me a deal on the room, given that they'd normally require the food and drink minimum for that room as well in order to procure it for the afternoon.  But given the season and date (January 1), they'll likely make more money just giving it to me for a flat fee than they would waiting to get the place rented from someone else.

I was anxious about the cost, but ironically, this nice old south feeling place is comparable to most of the other places I've checked.  However the other places hide all the costs.  They charge less per person, but then there's the cost of the room plus the cost of the bar plus the cost of the labor plus the service fee plus the tax--Oh!  and the service fee is taxable.  So this place?  We pay per person and that includes the room, the fees, the tax, etc.  The only thing it doesn't cover is the coat check person and the AV equipment and the required ceremony coordinator.  I can manage that stuff no problem.

So I have a venue!  I have a date!  Come Friday or Saturday I should have my ring (woo!)!

I'm getting married!"

"event","Okay, so this wedding planning thing is for the freaking birds.
So Noah and I settled on a date/place.  New year's Eve at the beach.  What could be more fun?  So we found a beach house that's gorgeous, my dad was willing to pay for it.  And we went and looked at it this weekend.  If you want to see a picture of it, you can go to the rental site <a href=""http://www.treasurerealty.com/rentals/100ovl/100ovl.htm""> here</a>.  It's awesome.

The problem is that it's relatively huge when you're talking party at the beach and small when you're talking wedding and reception.  And we've got a respectable guest list.  Let me rephrase that, <b>I</b> have a respectable guest list.  He's not even given me his guest list.

So we decided that costs being what they are and space being what it is and the sadness that we would have if we had to not invite people we love because of the space issue, we should have the wedding in the Raleigh-Durham area.  

So we looked around.  I found <a href=""http://www.americantobaccohistoricdistrict.com/rent-bay-7.html"">a space I adore</a>.  Not available 12/24 through 1/5.

I like the Durham Arts Council building, but it's unavailable on the 1st, I'm waiting to hear about the 31st.

I feel more and more like it's going to wind up being that we have the ceremony and reception at a hotel, which is fine, but a little disappointing.  Especially since it's Durham, there are a million awesome places here.  And yet, in the winter?  All of them sort of are outdoors.  Or are closed.  So i'm calling around other places, and it's looking more and more like hotels all the time.  My friend, Matt, has said we could use his restaurant, and I'm thinking that we could use it and it'd be cool.  But I'm just disappointed because the space I really want?  not available.  

I know it'll be fine no matter where we do it, but I just want it to be someplace cool.  Is that so much to ask?

Sigh."

"event","So we went to the jeweler last night to look at engagement rings.  When Noah proposed, he was relieved that I said yes, since he'd been looking at rings and couldn't find one he thought I would like.  That was on a Wednesday.  We talked about a friend of ours, who's a jeweler and about how we weren't sure where his store was, other than in Chapel Hill.

Thursday, I went to Noah's house and he handed me our friend, Travis's, card and said ""Guess who's car I worked on today.""  Turns out, the stars aligned once again.    

So the following weekend, we shopped around some jewelry stores, including a couple at a mall and got some ideas.  We even went to Jared.  It was sort of crazy, because we had Ella with us, and she did not care about rings or standing around while we looked at them, so it was rushed.  Last week, my Pigeon came over and watched Ella while we went to a local jewelry store and looked at rings and found the settings I liked and whatnot.  The stone for the setting that I liked was going to set us back at least $4000.  Ouch.

So then I called to see if we couldn't get to Travis's shop sometime during the week, and unfortunately, the schedule was not going to work out.  So, Noah made an appointment to meet with him Saturday, while I had plans to be in Asheville with my friend, Leslie, who is also our photographer.  We've known each other since 2nd grade and this was the first time in her 12 years of marriage that she's taken a vacation without her family, so I made Noah watch Ella and we went to Asheville.  And to the Biltmore.  GORGEOUS.  I want to go back at Christmas.

Anyway, so Saturday, Noah calls me from the shop and says ""There's some stuff here that Travis and I want you to look at, can you come to Chapel Hill Tuesday after work and meet me here and look at stuff?""  So I say ""Okay.""  When really what I wanted to hear was ""I got your ring and you'll love it.""  Because I'm shallow and I need to be waving a ring around, dammit.

So last night, I get to Chapel Hill and Noah has warned me that there are other stones he wants me to look at.  Turns out, there's this guy, Richard Homer.  And he's a gem cutter.  One of the best in the world.  And for non-diamond stones, he invented this type of cut called a concave cut.  Most all gems are cut with a flat facet cut.  Meaning that you have this straight line and when you hit it with light, the light bounces off it and that's when you see the sparkle.  With the concave cut, it's not flat, it's scooped out like an ice cream scoop.  So when light hits it, instead of bouncing out, it sort of reflects back and forth like in an aluminum tube.  Anyway, this type of cut is apparently the shit right now and Homer is basically the only guy that seems to do it and do it well.  So Homer cuts the stones and then sells them at various shows including the big jewelcrafting to-do they have in Vegas every year. 

At the big Vegas show, it's a freaking mad house to get to Homer's gems.  People elbow and push and shove to get to them and will just snatch them up by the box for hundreds of thousands of dollars.  He mostly does sapphires, but also does some other gems (not diamonds).  Travis is an award winning jewelcrafter.  He's won multiple awards with Homer's gems, so he has a great relationship with this guy, who will actually send Travis the stones to view and choose from before the Vegas show.  So on Saturday when Noah got to the store, 2 boxes of sapphires (varying in color in yellow, pink and blue) had arrived and the stones were being sent back Wednesday (today).  So Travis showed the stones to Noah, who loved them.

So they wanted me to come look, and I did.  The stones were breathtaking.  The blues (i didn't really spend much time with the yellows and pinks) were so varied in color and so gorgeous, not to mention that the type of cut make the stone not sparkle so much as it glows.  I loved them.  Travis actually handed me the box of about 25 or so stones and told Noah and me to take them outside and look at them under natural light, rather than trust the lights with all the yellows and oranges in the shop.  It was even better.

He assured me that if I wanted a diamond, he'd get me a diamond, but that ultimately, as a jewelcrafter, he thinks of diamonds as an accent stone.  So we looked at settings and we compared them to how they'd look with the sapphires in them and we made a decision and I will have my ring in about 4 weeks.  We got twice the stone for half the price of a diamond, which means we get to spend more on the setting.  No paladium for me, I'm getting platinum.  And, handily, Travis has a classic truck on which he wants to put tires and is going to have Noah sell him the tires and mount and balance them for him for a portion of the cost of the ring.  

I'm downright giddy at the very idea of having my ring in a month.  I'm sad that it's going to be a month, but I'm getting a ring.  An engagement ring!  I'm getting married for real now.  I wish I could have it for this weekend when my parents are here, so I could show off, but the truth is, I'll have the rest of my life to do that, and I'm tickled at how pretty it's going to be.

Here are some pictures to give you an idea of what it should look like:

the setting is very similar to this:

And the stone looks a lot like this one, although probably a little lighter:

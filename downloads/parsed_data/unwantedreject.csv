I don't have many friends. I love the ones I have an I love making new ones. I'm pretty
much online all the time. I like watching movies and hanging out with my friends.

I listen to a lot of different types of music. punk,metal,emo,ska,indie,rock,and death metal. Most of the info about me is in my userinfo. <3

"event","Jesse and James had stolen all of his Pokemon in his sleep except the one he hated most: Charizard.

Even though Ash Ketchum already had the Boulder, Cascade, Thunder, Rainbow, Soul, Marsh, Volcano, Earth, Candy, Chinese, Umbrella, Cantaloupe, Benign, Upside-down, and Banana Badges, Charizard simply would not listen.

It was one of those days when Ash Ketchum woke up on the wrong side of the bed after a hangover involving seventeen barrels of whiskey when he found himself fighting the ever-arrogant Gary Oak.  As usual, Gary had a stick up his ass and a straw up his nose and a chip on his shoulder and was itching for a fight.

Ash was going to have no bullshit today.

""Go!  Charizard!""

He might as well have used a rock to defeat Gary.  At least he could pick it up and bash it into his skull, at which point Gary might have ""fainted"".

""Charizard!"" Ash screamed at the top of lung.  ""You are going to beat Gary's ass, or I will be ripping you a new one!!""

Charizard got up, put on his monocle, sipped some English Breakfast tea and said simply, ""No, Ash.  It is I who will be ripping you the new one.""

And then he ripped Ash a new one."

"event","<lj-cut>This is yet another one of my articles not based on research, but rather on what I believe to be simple logic.

Our dorm has ping pong balls to rent.  Of course, the balls are made of cheap plastic, and are prone (and expected) to break at any moment.  So when the ping pong ball I was playing with cracked, I took it upstairs to get a new one for rent.  I suspected maybe a fifty sent fee or something.

Five dollars.

That's ten times more than it costs to buy a ping pong ball from the local slot machine.

I was irritated, but the person at the desk told me that I could replace it.  I grudgingly understood that it wasn't her fault and asked to check out yet another one.

I walked downstairs with the ball and noticed there was a crack in it as well.  Apparently, someone had returned it without telling the DA that it was... well... damaged.  I didn't play with the ball and returned it.  Without saying a word.

Then it hit me.

I was returning a damaged ping pong ball.  Why?  Because someone else returned a damaged ping pong ball.  Why?  Because that person didn't want to be charged!  We all had the same motive for returning the damaged ping pong ball; it was so we wouldn't be charged five dollars!!

How stupid, I thought to myself.  How stupid that we would all do this.  Soon enough, no one would rent ping pong balls for fear that they would either break or already be broken.  So what would everyone do?  Purchase their own balls!  Individually, this makes economic sense, because no one would have to pay for a broken one.  However, as a community, we each suffer a 50 cent penalty when we want to play ping pong, as opposed to having the convenience of being able to check out the balls.  If we coordinated our efforts as a community, we would have free balls for rent, but instead we're losing 50 cents to play ping pong.

My point is that charging five dollars is not encouraging honesty.  Being penalized for proper use of equipment is unfair to people, especially to those who borrowed malfunctioning equipment, returned said equipment, and had to bear the blame of breaking said equipment.  It is true that there should be some kind of penalty, but five dollars?  Who's gonna be honest then?

"event","<lj-cut>Here's another less formal of my posts, but I figure that I haven't written much in a long time, and I need to do so.

Ever get the sense of being stared at?  I think all of you can pretty much relate.  I don't even have to describe it to you.  But what really makes it happen?

Because I'm weird, I decided that I'd try this out myself.  On my way to classes, I'd focus on people directly in front of me for at least a minute.  As they walked in line, I didn't notice them do anything strange, such as slowing down, looking around, or scratching their head.  Nothing.

The same thing applied for when I was standing in line for lunch.  I stared at the back of people's heads.  Nothing.

I have a friend who says she can literally feel people staring at her.  I stared at the back of her head for about a minute.  Nothing.

Why does it fail when people everywhere (including myself) can seriously feel someone staring at them?

I thought about the answer and realized what was wrong with every one of my experiments.  I was looking <i>at the back of the head</i>.  What would happen if I were in someone's peripherals and staring at them?  I haven't tried this out yet, but I believe I would get more interesting results.

In his book <i>Blink</i>, Malcolm Gladwell discusses the power of the subconscious, and how it can very good guesses with fewer information than our conscious needs to make the same decisions.  Gladwell discusses how students who watched a mere <i>two seconds</i> of a tape of a professor's lecture made similar decisions about the quality of the professor's lectures as those who spent time with the professor for an entire semester.  (I took the liberty of trying this out for myself and found my predictions surprisingly accurate.  I think the most notable signs happen to be gestures, pauses, and facial expressions, as well as how often the professor must refer to notes.)

What's my point?  Well, the subconscious would theoretically be far more powerful and observant than the conscious, right?  Thus if someone were <i>in your peripherals</i> and staring at you, your subconscious would give off signals of discomfort that indicate that someone is staring at you.  Why would your subconscious do that?  Probably because when humans were less evolved and lived in the wild, they needed to know when creatures were stalking them so they could identify the creature and get away.

There is nothing magical about feeling that someone is staring at you.  But there is something magical about how peripherals can identify out of a pair of hundreds of eyes those two that could be potentially dangerous.

"event","<lj-cut>There was a Dateline special about iPod thefts.  Dateline discusses how it might theoretically be possible to track down iPods, because iPods are supposed to be registered online.  I think you can see where this is going; this information could be used to track down possible thieves.  The special mainly discusses how it used a special program to make the installation CD appear to be a normal CD, but the program in the CD gives the private information not only to Apple, but also to Dateline.  The people eventually track down the thieves and confront them, usually regaining the iPods.

Then the story brings about an interesting question: What if Apple used the private information to track down possible thieves?

Aside from the obvious liability issue, in which no private information received from registration is to be released without the registrar's consent, I think this is an interesting topic to ponder.  What incentive does Apple have to track down these individuals?

According to Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner (2006), ""Morality, it could be argued, represents the way that people would like the world to work -- whereas economics represents how it actually <i>does</i> work"" (p. 11).  The two continue to state that ""[i]ncentives are the cornerstone of modern life"" (p. 11).  This truth seems (to me) to apply more to large corporations rather than individuals (though I will spare the government from this discussion, as it is sometimes, believe it or not, an institution that defends society).

So what incentive does Apple have?  Surely a large corporation won't begin hunting down iPod thieves because it's the ""right thing to do"".  Customer service in your favorite supermarket or electronic stores does not exist for the sake of altruism.  It exists because these stores want repeat customers, and in a country where competitive prices make most similar products equally low in price, one of the few ways to bring back customers is via customer service.  It's the same reason why some ""Mom 'n' Pop"" stores can still survive today.

However, Apple is already well-known (apparently) for great customer support.  And if the company already has great customer support, it doesn't need to build more status for ""great customer support"".  Additionally, Apple isn't exactly obligated to locate lost merchandise (unless it's their own fault that the merchandise was lost, as in shipping orders).  By refusing to locate lost merchandise, Apple probably won't lose too much status.

So if Apple won't relocate lost merchandise, what will the customers end up doing?  They'll buy another one.  Why not?  Why buy something from someone else if you were already satisfied with the product you had before?  By refusing to relocate lost merchandise, Apple can actually <i>increase</i> sales.

Dateline continues its program by asking thieves whether or not they would have stolen the iPods had they known that stolen iPods could be traced.  Of course, every thief said ""no"".  What would happen if iPod's method for detecting thieves was flawless and could catch, say, 90% of thieves?  Those thieves would simply purchase the product themselves!  What would happen?  Sales would go up!

Ah, but what if the iPod catching was about as effective as, say, the IRS catching tax evaders (sorry, I know I said that I was going to leave the government out...)?  Well, you'd get people stealing iPods, while the occasional thief gets caught.  Essentially, the situation would look similar to what would happen if Apple did nothing at all, right?  You'd get many people just repurchasing the product back anyway, while thieves would have little incentive to stop stealing.  Same situation, but we add a few more winners into the mix, right?

Not quite.  It takes time to track down said thieves.  That, and it would probably take time to actually be able to confront the thief.  Time is definitely valuable.  Therefore (if I may sound like a faux logician for a moment), companies would be losing money.  Companies lose out.  Few customers are satisfied with even better service than usual.  Other customers are disappointed that they aren't getting their stolen iPods back.  Still more customers will wait to see if their iPod will be found instead of buying a new one.  As a result, fewer iPods are bought, Apple loses face, and Apple loses money.  I suppose the only thing that could come out of this is more jobs to track down said thieves, but that would lose even more money, so Apple probably wouldn't do it anyway.

My point is that Apple can't do half of the job.  It's all or nothing.  They can't do a pathetic job like the IRS that simply lands them in a lose-lose situation.  Of course, it's a lot easier to do nothing, so guess what Apple probably will do?

It's an interesting solution you propose, Dateline, but unfortunately, large corporations revolve around incentives rather than morals.

"event","<lj-cut>I was discussing my major with my dermatologist a while back.  I told her that I originally planned to do optical engineering, but recently decided against it, in favor of (what I believe to be) the more exciting fields of either economics or marketing.  She told me that she understood m attitude.  She said she understood that I wanted to ""change the world"".  ""Change the world?"" I thought, ""I'd be a surgeon if I wanted to do that.  I'm just looking for something interesting that puts food on the table.""

Effective marketing does, in a sense, change the world.  McDonald's is an example of stellar marketing.  According to Eric Schlosser (2005), ""A survey of American schoolchildren found that 96 percent could identify Ronald McDonald.  The only fictional character with a higher degree of recognition was Santa Claus.  The impact of McDonald's on the way we live today is hard to overstate.  The Golden Arches are now more widely recognized than the Christian cross"" (pp. 4-5).  Besides the disturbing point that McDonald's is more recognized than a prominent religious symbol in the United States, it shows how good marketing molds people's ideas.  In the July 7-13 2007 issue of The Economist, one article (p. 74) discusses how to more easily understand exchange rates by converting currency not to other currency, rather, to Big Macs.  The article itself is interesting in teaching about exchange rates and such, but what I find more striking is the vast amount of countries that sell Big Macs (32 countries are listed in the article), which is a clear indicator of McDonald's shaping of the world.

Notably, the Big Mac has ""changed the world"", but not necessarily for the better.  So how does one use marketing to change the world for the better?  Perhaps its easiest if I discuss one of the simplest forms of advertisement -- signs.

BAD SIGNS

I was riding from San Francisco to Pleasanton (where my grandmother lives) when I noticed some billboards on the highway.  None of them were particlarly interesting and some were downright annoying.

I saw a billboard for (what I assumed was) real estate advertisement.  It was essentially a billboard split into four signs, each advertising its own company, and each advertising just what was so amazing about their ""unique"" company.  I tried to memorize the sign so I might write out its features here, but it had so much information (yet so little <i>useful</i> information) that I gave up.

I saw another advertisement on my way to the airport (which is where I am writing the original article right now).  The picture had a girl standing while holding a phone.  There was an arrow at her feet.  In the background were various rees lit up by the night sky.  It was a beautiful looking poster, only I had no idea what it was trying to advertise.  I needed to squint to see a small Sprint logo in the upper-right corner.  Terrible marketing, if one doesn't even understand what the product itself is supposed to be.

---
A GOOD SIGN

I was on the same drive from San Francisco that I mentioned before when I noticed what I believed to be a nearly perfect sign.

The sign was ironic in that it was far less budgeted than the other signs; it was about four times smaller, and was attached to a light pole via tape.  It was cardboard decorated with red paint, and had exactly two words.

Fresh cherries.

There was an arrow under the two words, and a painting of a cherry.  It was an amazing sign because it told what was sold (cherries), what was so good about them (fresh), and where they were (with the arrow).  I saw the sign at about the same time and speed as I saw the real estate sign and Spring sign, yet I instantly had a craving for fresh cherries.

---
BETTER USES OF MARKETING

There are good signs that easily get three main points across, and there are terrible signs that, well, don't.  What do I think makes a good sign?  I'm no professional, but I think I'm entitled to an opinion here.  After all, I am the target of marketing, and marketers should have to follow my opinions.  Here are three questions that every good sign must answer:

1. What is being sold?
2. What's so good about this product?
3. How do I get this product?

So you ponder these three questions and think that perhaps I'm making sense (or not), but you look back to the subtitle of this section and ask your self if I'm ever going to get to the point.

Becase I do, in fact, have a point.

I was passing down a highway (what can I say?  highways are good places to find billboards!!) from Arizona to California, and noticed a sign.  It had a yellow background and bold black text.  It was easy to spot and very easy to understand its message.  I glanced at it for maybe three seconds.  I suppose I will remember this billboard for a long time, because not only was it a great billboard, but...

Well, it was set up in the style of a checklist.  There were two boxes:

__ do nothing
__ fightglobalwarming.com

Needless to say, I'm currently signed up for their newsletter.  And THAT, my friends, is my point.

"event","<lj-cut>""Even a broken clock is right twice a day.""

It's an interesting statement.  In fact, it's rather interesting to compare a broken clock to a clock that works.  For a clock that works is hardly <i>ever</i> right.  A clock that works is simply an estimation of the time.  For if the clock is even a millisecond wrong, it is wrong.  It will never be spot-on like the broken clock is twice a day.

Clocks are kind of like science.  Note Nassim Taleb's (2005) take on astrology:

""A theory that does not present a set of conditions under which it would be considered wrong would be termed charlatanism -- it would be impossible to reject otherwise.  Why?  Because the astrologist can always find a reason to fit the past event, by saying that <i>Mars was probably in line but not too much so</i>..."" (p. 126)

In that sense, astrology will always be correct, similar to how a broken clock will always be right twice a day.  Now consider Karl Popper's take on science (as cited by Taleb, 2004):

""Popper's idea is that science is not to be taken as seriously as it sounds... There are only two types of theories:

""1. Theories that are known to be wrong, as they were tested and adequately rejected (he calls them falsified).

""2. Theories that have not yet been known to be wrong, not falsified yet, but are exposed to be proved wrong.""

Taleb explains that a theory can never be right because you can never know all of the information about the world in order to verify your claim.  Taleb uses the example of the black swan, in which all swans were believed to be white.  Therefore the theory ""All swans are white."" came about.  Note that the presence of a <i>single</i> black swan would destroy said theory (and did destroy said theory).

Ironically, science is science because it can be falsified.  We know that science is imperfect and prone to various fallacies.  Notice that astrology, on the other hand, is always right.  It can never be disproved.

I propose, therefore, that astrology is like a broken clock, bound to be right no matter what.  I also propose, therefore, that science is like a working clock.  It is constantly adjusted to get closer to the truth, but is never quite there.

I leave my reader with the following question:  Why is it that we prefer to have our clocks working while seconds or minutes off, rather than a broken clock that must tell the right time twice a day?

"event","<lj-cut>So I was preparing dinner today at 12:30 pm (it was a slow-cook dinner, and my dad asked me to prepare a few things at about noonish), when my brother started complaining about... well.. something.  I walked over to his computer, and found him staring at <a href=""http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/snes/review/R25473.html"">this review</a> for <i>Super Metroid</i>, a game for the SNES that is very highly rated by many gamers, and a game that my brother just happens to love playing right now.

This review was unusual in that it gave the game a 4/10, as opposed to most every other review.  (As a side note, only 3 of the 54 reviews gave it less than a 9/10.  44 of the 54 reviews gave it a perfect score.)  I skimmed through the review and, though I had little interest in the game personally, much less its reviews, I could understand why the author would rate it the way he did.

The review breaks down thusly:

Graphics: 10/10
Sound: 10/10
Controls: 10/10
Gameplay: 4/10
Replay Value: 2/10
Overall: 4/10

I read through the review briefly, and absolutely agreed with him in certain areas.  (For example, the soundtrack for that game is amazing, especially for a SNES game.)  I didn't agree with him in certain parts (such as gameplay), but I understood why he would make such allegations against the game.  After all, it is pretty repetitive.  Of course, the review does come off as very slightly narcissistic, especially when the author says such things as, ""With all the tens this game is getting, it's hard to think I'm giving this game an overall rating of a four!""  However, I could fully understand his argument against the game, and found no problems with the review.

I asked my brother what his problem with the review was.  After he told me his reason, I chuckled a little inside.

He complained that the values didn't average to an overall value of 4/10.

It is a true observation.  The mean score of all values prior to the overall score is 7.2/10.  A respectable score for any video game, to be sure.

There are two possible reasons why my brother would make such an argument.  One reason is because he didn't understand English teachers.  The other reason is because he was emotional.  In both cases, his failure to understand the reviewer's overall score of 4/10 was not his fault at all.

---
ABOUT ENGLISH TEACHERS

My English teacher from my senior year in high school, we'll call her Ms. H., had very strong ideals about teaching.  I won't get into particulars, but one policy she felt strongly about was how papers were graded.

Teachers (or, at least the teachers I have had) usually acquire a rubric (or set of rubrics) to grade essays.  The rubrics will address such things as voice, conventions, grammar, syntax, etc.  The natural idea behind rubrics is to assign a score for each section, and ultimately add those scores together to give a final score.  It's a fast and simple way of getting the work done, and it is understandable why teachers would want to have a fast and simple way of getting papers finished.  Some teachers have hundreds of papers to grade, for crying out loud!

Ms. H. views the rubrics as a set of guidelines, however.  For example, a graded paper might have the following scores:

A: 9/10
B: 5/10
C: 8/10
D: 7/10
E: 9/10
Score: 85%

The score, if simply adding up the numbers, should be a 38/50, or a 76%.  So why would Ms. H. grade so much higher than what the rubric says the score should be?  Is it because she is playing favorites?

Ms. H. explains her grading system, and explains how the rubrics are more like guidelines.  She'll tell the class, for example, that in certain papers, voice might be far more important than conventions and spelling errors, or that the structure of the essay is the most important part.

Reviewing the review of <i>Super Metroid</i>, gameplay and replay value are probably the most important aspects of video games.  It's the reason why the PS3 is still available at every Target, while you'd still be hard-pressed to find the Nintendo Wii at just any store.

Of course, my brother may not have had such an idea introduced to him yet, as some of his teachers just check off the answer sheets for right or wrong answers, or just mark up the rubric to eventually give a C for a paper that actually deserved a B.  He cannot be expected to apply something he hasn't yet learned about.

---
ABOUT EMOTIONS

There is still another reason why he might have failed to understand how a 4/10 could be pulled from a set of scores whose average is 7.2/10.

Paul Ekman (2003) writes about facial expressions and emotions, and has been studying both for many years.  In his book <i>Emotions Revealed</i>, one expects to read a book about how you can tell whether someone is happy or sad or angry simply by looking for eyelids drooping about a millimeter lower than usual, or eyebrows moving together just slightly more than usual.  Of course, the book does discuss all of this, but not before discussing how we become emotional, and what happens when we become emotional.

Paul Ekman describes how emotions change our facial expressions, physical self, and how we view  the world.  He also describes an interesting feature about emotions.  Ekman writes about a <i>""refractory state""</i>.  Ekman describes this state as a certain time while we are experiencing our emotions in which ""our thinking cannot incorporate information that does not fit, maintain, or justify the emotion we are feeling"" (p. 39).

It's usually true.  Whenever we are angry, be it at a spouse or a sibling or a friend, we don't try to reason other possible explanations.  When a child is standing in the same room as a broken vase, we don't question whether or not the child has broken the vase.  We <i>know</i>.  We immediately send the child to his room, and don't search for alternate explanations, such as the vase having been broken before and the child walking to the bathroom at the same time, or the child running to the vase after hearing it break out of curiosity.  We are in the refractory period.  We are angry, and we need only look at the evidence that justifies our anger.

Now, we can apply the idea of the refractory period to my brother's situation.  He really liked the game <i>Super Metroid</i>, and didn't want to see evidence to the contrary.  When he saw a review that gave it a low score, he must have felt slightly annoyed or frustrated.  When he began reading the review, he saw that the average should have been around 7/10, and was annoyed that the person (apparently) didn't understand basic algebra.  This made him more annoyed.  He probably looked at the reasoning behind the overall score and became more annoyed.  This annoyance caused him to go into a refractory state, and during the refractory state, my brother reasoned that bad math is what gave the bad score.  He reasoned that the reviewer was a dunce and didn't understand basic algebra.  He didn't try to understand the reviewer.  He didn't try to understand that maybe replay value and gameplay were far more important than graphics or sound.  In fact, he probably didn't even see those words.  All he saw was:

10/10 + 10/10 + 10/10 + 4/10 + 2/10 = 20/50.

All he saw was the evidence that supported his emotions.

---
THE CONCLUSION

Ekman constantly writes throughout his book that emotions are important.  They make life interesting.  They (sometimes) guide our search in the right directions.  They motivate us.  However, sometimes we need to tell our emotions to slow down so we can have a better understanding about the situation.

It's an idea that needs to be applied more often.  Consider religious views.  Some people have religious views that are different than others.  Is it worth killing for?  Some people say yes.

Perhaps these people are killing over religion because seeing others with different views makes them angry.  They are stuck in a refractory period in which the only information they can receive about the other person is: ""They are stupid.  How could you not believe in something that I believe in?  Because you would be stupid.  Stupid stupid stupid.""  These people don't try to understand why a person might have different views than them.

In fact, these people don't even try to understand why they are so angry.  If they would simply reflect upon themselves for a minute, if they would ask themselves, ""Why am I angry about this?""  Perhaps they would be able to stop their anger and learn to accept others' religious views.

So maybe when someone is saying, ""I don't understand"", what they really mean is ""I won't understand.""

"event","<lj-cut>So I was lying on my couch reading a book (<i>Emotions Revealed</i> by Paul Ekman, and yes, it is slightly relevant to this discussion).  My brother was sitting on another couch playing his Nintendo DS.  I put my book down for a few seconds to take a quick breather, when I noticed that Jerry Springer was on television.  It was some episode called ""Audience Attack"", and I was waiting for a riot to happen.

The episode has a man with extremely long hair (that is, longer than how long my hair was, or how long Chelsea L.'s hair is).  He looked dirty and was probably in his forties.  He didn't exactly show much facial expression, though he did show quite a bit of poorly-shaven facial hair.  Anyway, he was talking about how he wanted to live on the streets for some reason, and his wife disapproved of his idea.  The scene then cut to a (rather staged) dramatization of what he and his wife were going through.  He would try to explain to her that he just wanted to live on the streets, and she would constantly show annoyance and physically assault him.  She eventually ended up leaving, and he eventually ended up (pretending to be) sleeping.

Aside from the obvious question, ""How would someone get a video clip of something like that without the lady stabbing the cameraman in the heart?"" I also asked myself, ""Why would anyone watch this kind of show?""

The lady was trying to physically assault her husband on stage, and people were cheering, and security guards that must have weighed at least 200 pounds were having trouble restraining this 5'6"" lady from assaulting her husband.  It was mind-numbingly stupid.

There was a scenario after that regarding a woman who had only one leg and no arms.  The lady complained about her husband never helping her around the house.  The scene then cut to her trying to eat spaghetti, eat chips, and drink a soda.  She was even talking with the cameraman while making a fool out of herself.

I'm not one to lightly call disabled people fools, nor would I call anyone a fool ordinarily.  However, this lady was obviously just trying to dramatize how difficult it was for her to eat.  Someone with no arms won't try to eat a meatball.  They'll just go for the pasta instead.  Someone with no arms won't try to open a bag of chips.  They'll eat something more accessible.  Someone with no arms won't try to drink a soda out of a can.  They'll use a straw.  Each situation showed the lady making a fool out of herself as she (apparently) failed at life (and, incidentally, said ""shucks"" after every failure).

The volume was turned down low so you would have to really concentrate on what was going on to hear, and what I heard were not gasps of horror.  Rather, I heard a chorus of laughter.  Laughter after each failure of what this woman tried to do.  No pity.  I disgustedly turned the TV off.

Within the three minute time span that I watched ""Jerry"", I think my IQ might have temporarily dropped 15 points.

I returned to my book, and read the following passage:

""Sometimes a person... may be regarded as not being really human...  Their suffering may seem deserved, or at least not discomforting to the witness.  There are also people who enjoy the suffering of others.  They torment, physically or psychologically, because it feels good to exert their power and to witness the pain and suffering it produces.""

Paul Ekman continues, implying that people who cannot empathize may be similar to sociopaths.  Indeed, upon looking at the next chapter which discusses anger, violence is termed as a mental disorder, and discusses people who absolutely love hurting others, be it mentally or physically.

So I thought about Jerry Springer, and thought to myself, ""Perhaps it is that Jerry Springer and his audiences are all... to some degree... psychopaths.""

It's hard to see how this is not the case.  Staging fights for midday television that nobody watches.  People cheering for violence.  Thinking in terms of Levitt and Dubner as they describe in their book <i>Freakonomics</i>, there is no economical or social incentive to watch the show.  Additionally, there is a <i>negative</i> moral incentive to watch the show.  So why would anyone watch it?

The only reason someone would watch such a show is for pleasure, and the only pleasure that can come from that show would be that pleasure in watching others suffer.  Someone who gains pleasure from watching others suffer is, essentially, a psychopath.

It's hard not to see a link between Jerry Springer and being a psychopath.  I believe the more interesting question in this case is, ""Do psychopaths watch Jerry Springer <i>because they're psychopaths</i>, or does Jerry Springer <i>make people psychopaths</i>?""  Of course, as of now, I have no evidence to begin answering that question.

"event","<lj-cut>Constantly, we are taught of the importance of analyzing and gathering more information before making an important decision.  Always weigh the pros and cons before making a decision, especially if it's an important one that will consume plenty of time and/or money.  It's a generally good rule.  After all, who would want to purchase a car before comparing the pros and cons among various cars?  It's a big decision, and being careless would have extremely detrimental consequences.  A crappy car won't do, and a good, but less than perfect car is difficult to sell, even new.  After all, a perfectly fine, new car must lose about a quarter of its value as soon as it leaves the lot with its owner.  After all, the only reason a person would want to resell the car is because the owner found it to be a ""lemon"" (Levitt & Dubner, 2006).  No, only a perfect car would do, and the only way to find <i>the perfect car</i> must be through days of deliberation, gathering all possible data available.  It's a job best left to analysis, not intuition.

Consider heart attacks.  Doctors in the emergency room must make decisions about whether or not a patient is at high or low risk of having one.  How would one go about making the decision?  Obviously, by gathering data.  But how much data should one find out?  Do we need to know age?  Past medical history?  Income?  Where the person lives?  How much the person weighs?  How tall the person is?  Body temperature?  Electrocardiograms?  Heart rate?  Blood pressure?  Gender?  The time it would take to gather absolutely as much information as possible to make a well-educated guess would be simply too time-consuming.  Let's say you want to find out ten pieces of information.  How would you evaluate this information?  Does age matter more than weight?  How about dietary information?  I think by the time a doctor would calculate all of this data, the patient would be in another room, and the doctor would be out of a job.

Gerd Gigerenzer, Peter M. Todd, and the ABC Research Group released a book in 1999 entitled <i>Simple Heuristics That Make Us Smart</i>.  The book basically discusses heuristics, and making quick and smart decisions.  The premise of the book obviously gives away the solution to the heart attack problem, though one might be surprised to find that it takes only three cues to rather accurately predict whether or not a person should be admitted as ""high risk"" or ""low risk"".  Gigerenzer, Todd, and the ABC Research Group cite Breiman and fellow colleagues as having developed a kind of flow chart to determine risk.  The chart is as follows:

1. Is the minimum systolic blood pressure over the initial 24 hour period >91?
Yes = Go to next step.
No = High risk.

2. Is age >62.5?
Yes = Go to next step.
No = Low risk.

3. Is sinus tachycardia present?
Yes = High risk.
No = Low risk.

It's simple.  At most, one would have to answer three questions to find out high or low risk.  Additionally, there is no quantifying how important each item is.  It's a yes-or-no answer, and you move on.  Additionally, it is more accurate than other ideas of taking and evaluating dozens of medical cues, as if the amount of time saved isn't appealing enough (Gigerenzer et. al., 1999).

Overanalysis has its drawbacks, and therefore, Malcolm Gladwell, author of <i>Blink: The Power of Thinking without Thinking</i> cites Freud as stating that more minor decisions should be left to the conscious, while more major decisions should be made by the unconscious (Gladwell, 2007, p. 268).

That's fine.  Let's consider a situation, then, in which one is to make a decision of what to wear to work today.  Consider that one shirt is blue and has seven buttons, while the other shirt is blue and has eight buttons.  I hope that one would not spend too much time deliberating over which shirt is better.

This concept is what Gary Klein, author of <i>The Power of Intuition</i> calls the ""Zone of Indifference"" (2003, p. 77).  Even if it's a minor decision, that decision could be easily settled and easily have time saved simply by allowing intuition to do its work.

Consider another anecdote of minor decision making.  EVR is an intelligent man whose IQ consistently is tested into the 97th-99th percentile.  EVR had cerebral brain tumor at the age of 35, and eventually had it removed, though not before it slightly damaged both frontal lobes of his brain.  The surgery was a success, and EVR would return to his daily life routine, though he would not quite be the same.  For example, ""deciding where to dine might take hours, as he discussed each restaurant's seating plan, particulars of menu, atmosphere and management.  He would drive to each restaurant to see how busy it was, but even then he could not finally decide which to choose"" (Klein, 2003, p. 79).

Oh, and concerning the car, Malcolm Gladwell discusses psychologist Ap Dijksterhuis's experiment about how accurately people would choose cars.  Essentially, the cars had already been evaluated by experts, and a ""better"" one was already pre-chosen by said experts.  There were two groups of people in the experiment, one group were shown characteristics of the car and later asked to evaluate which was better.  The other group was shown the same characteristics, but distracted with anagrams.  At the end of the experiment, both groups were to evaluate which car was better.  Those who deliberated about the car without interruption had about 20% accuracy in evaluating the better vehicle, while those who were distracted and paid less attention had about 60% accuracy.

Perhaps the question about intuition is not about intuition at all.  Perhaps the question should be asking why we need to overanalyze issues.

"event","<lj-cut>The title of this article isn't exactly catchy by any means, but I suppose it is fitting as a literal description of what this is about to be.

I used to be in a high school choir that was split up into separate sub-units, if you will.  There were the beginning, show, advanced, and jazz choirs.  I happened to be a member of the show and jazz choirs, while maintaining a few ties to the beginning and show choirs, which mostly came about through being friends/acquaintances of others who happened to be in, say, show and jazz choirs, or beginning and advanced choirs.  (Yes, beginning and advanced choirs.  Some students decide to join both choirs because the director thinks it beneficial to have some better students encourage the beginners to sing better, though this seems ineffective even in ""advanced"" choir.)

I joined the choir sophomore year, and at that time, everyone was fine with the choir director and her style.  She was nice and always encouraged everyone to make new friends.  She would hold ""choir socials"", and for the choir trips, she would assign ""buddies"" to keep the choir together as a ""family"".  It worked.  Everyone was happy and nice and everyone liked the director.  People would, in fact, volunteer to help out with rummage sales and other fundraising activities.  It was probably the best year that choir had.

Junior year rolled around, and suddenly, she seemed to be less involved in the choir.  The socials were less frequent, and those who didn't happen to go on the choir tour trip didn't have ""buddies"".  Some of the seniors started complaining about her.  However, the rest of us (underclassmen) were still fine with her.  The choir was still a very good choir, and we still tried very hard, and we had a lot of fun.

Senior year came, and suddenly, everyone hated our director.  Within the first two months, she was easily everyone's most hated teacher.  During the time, I couldn't quite figure out why she was such a dreadful person to be around; she was the same person.  She had the same habits.  She looked the same.  Yet in the time span of five months or so, everyone grew to absolutely detest her.

In hindsight, and after reading Malcolm Gladwell's <i>The Tipping Point</i>, the solution is very simple.

THE LAW OF THE FEW

I remember a student, Mikaela S.  She happened to have ties with every choir.  Rather close ties at that.  She was in the beginning, advanced, jazz, and show choirs (if I recall correctly).  She absolutely loved our director and thought that everything she did was great.  And she knew everyone.  She was a Connector, and when she told people about things, people listened because people knew her.  Everyone knew her.

She quit Junior year, and took all her approvals of our director with her.  Senior year came, and many seniors at that time happened to become Connectors.  All seniors had ties either directly or indirectly with each choir.  All seniors could, collectively, say something, and the idea would cross everyone's minds in the choir.  Whether it went in one ear and out the other, or sticked was a different question entirely, but everyone was hearing the message.  Naturally, when we would say that the teacher was terrible, they would listen and agree that she was terrible.

I remember having a conversation with Derek O., one of the few students that I happened to have ties with in the beginning choir.  We were talking about choir, and he mentioned to me how he hated the choir director.  I found this shocking, because I didn't remember any other ""Connectors"" from choir having talked to him about the choir director.  I agreed with him and asked him why he thought that way, and he told me that he had heard rumors about how she was constantly stealing money from the other accounts that were originally supposed to pay for improvements for choir in order to fund her family's going on the tour as well.  I hadn't heard that before, but I agreed and thought that that must have been the case.

After all, it did make sense.  How else would she fund the tours?  Out of her own pocket?  Not likely.

---

THE STICKINESS FACTOR

However, she had always done such a thing, so why was it that she wasn't hated sophomore and junior year, but so despised senior year?

There was one very big event senior year that seemed to spark the whole epidemic of hate.

Ryan F. was (arguably) the best bass in choir, and perhaps the best male in choir.  He and the choir director didn't exactly see eye-to-eye on many things, including how after school dress rehearsals should be mandatory.  He had his father e-mail the choir teacher about possibly making up the assignment another way, as he was never able to get a proper response when asking her directly.  The choir director responded by saying that Ryan F. was a ""liar"" and had apparently not been very dedicated to choir at all.

After the first semester, Ryan F. dropped choir, and at that time, people had a definite reason to hate her.  You can't call a student names, and you can't kick your best choir member out of choir.

The message was a sticky one.  It applied directly to every student in choir.  The teacher kicked out one of the Connectors in choir, so naturally everyone knew about it, even without the other Connectors telling them.  The teacher kicked out the best bass in choir.  If the best bass was out, how good could the rest of the choir possibly be then?

---

THE LAW OF CONTEXT

However, this doesn't explain very much about why the students originally hated her.

It's simple, though many students probably won't notice it.  This year, we had a grand total of zero fund raisers.  This year, we had a grand total of zero choir socials.  This year, we had no ""buddies"" for the choir tour.  This year, there were no renovations to the choir room or to the choir itself.

It was the little things that ultimately counted.  Without the Ryan F. incident, everyone would still hate the director, except they wouldn't know why.

The little things was what made the choir a family unit.  It was what made the choir happy.  People always looked forward to choir socials.  People always looked forward to the ""buddy"" system.  People always enjoyed renovations.  As a result of these little things, people would enjoy participating in fund raisers.  Without those little things in place that made choir a happy family unit, the choir fell apart.

CONCLUSION

The book is excellent in that it puts epidemics in a new light and gives ways to (accurately) define ""epidemics"".  Epidemics don't always have to be fashion trends.  They don't always have to be viruses.  Epidemics could be ideas, and the spread of certain ideas can make an excellent choir, or destroy one.</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut>Vanished.  As if someone could hide a 15 x 20 foot painting, much less run off with the thing, and yet the impossible seemed true!

Everyone surveyed the room quickly and noted the only items of interest were the open windows, the piano, and the previously received package, still wrapped as it was when it just arrived.

Arthur ran to the window and looked out for any signs of prints or whatnot, but it was no use.  Vincent Jefferson would never leave something so rediculously simple at the scene of the crime, or so everyone at the ""party"" thought to themselves.

And it was true.  The ground was muddy, yet no footprints were to be found.  The window... it might have been a ploy... and yet...

""He has it hidden somewhere.... I know it!"" shouted Arthur Chester, as he frantically searched the entire room.  Dr. Hadean cast a suspicious glance toward the butler guarding the door.

""It's quite simple, really,"" Dr. Hadean muttered to himself.

Arthur Chester, however, decided that he would do better to tear down everything in the room in case Vincent Jefferson had somehow hidden it without anyone noticing.

Suddenly, Arthur smiled as he cast a short glance to the obnoxiously large package he had previously received.

""Ha!""

He tore open the package and... there was Arsene Lupin!

""You didn't get away this time, Vincent Jefferson,"" Arthur shouted in triumph.  Louisa rushed to Arthur, shoved him out of the way, and planted a small kiss onto the painting.

Suddenly, a short laugh came out of Skip Carter.  The room hushed up and stared at him, for it was a queer thing to do with such a serious matter.

""You're all blind!"" he shouted.  ""Look!  Look behind the painting!""

Arthur bent behind the painting, and gasped.  Louisa rushed behind it and did the same.  Everyone began to notice something appalling behind the painting of Arsene Lupin.

Behind that painting, was another canvas.  The first canvas was removed to reveal Arsene Lupin!  That canvas was removed to reveal Arsene Lupin once again!  In fact, there were about two dozen Arsene Lupins in the room, all smiling and taunting its owner.

""What is the meaning of this?!"" Arthur shouted in his characteristic voice.

""Perhaps,"" suggested Dr. Hadean, ""Vincent Jefferson had intended to make a copy and replace it with your genuine painting, while running off with it.""  He cast a quick look around the room to study reactions.

""If that's so,"" said Bethany, ""why would there be multiple copies rather than just one?  In fact, there are at least two dozens, are there not?""

Everyone agreed that it was a strange state of affairs.

""Wait!"" shouted Martin suddenly, as an idea struck him.  ""Perhaps the painting has had some kind of water mark?  Surely, Vincent Jefferson could not have known of the water mark, and could not have prepared a painting with a water mark on it if he had just removed the painting today.""

Louisa was excited at the idea, and Arthur sent out the butler guarding the door to fetch a flashlight, as if he were a king and ordering some peon to leave his castle, lest he should bring his wrath upon the poor fellow.  The butler rushed off, almost tripping on his own shoes.

The butler returned with a flashlight momentarily, and Arthur Chester grabbed the flashlight and rushed to shine it behind every painting of Arsene Lupin to find its authenticity.

Each painting was held, and the flashlight was shone upon the back of each one, so as to find some kind of water mark.  Of course, the canvas was so tall, that eventually a ladder was needed to reach the higher parts of the painting.

""Ah!""

Arthur uttered a squeal of delight, and the others awed as well, for in that very painting they were all holding, Arsene Lupin's face had become distorted into a likeness of a beautiful ring.  It was a queer water mark, thought Dr. Hadean, but the thought passed him without much concern.

The real painting of Arsene Lupin was restored to its rightful place.

""Take that!"" shouted Arthur Chester, casting glances at Skip Carter, Kerry Manfred, and the butler.  ""You see, Arsene Lupin might be able to pull a fast one on many people, but he is still just a man!""  He smiled as he took credit for Dr. Hadean's previous remark.  Dr. Hadean looked uncomfortable.

---

Hours longer had passed, as the rest of the mansion was surveyed.  Guests were beginning to leave, as the party was dying.

""Before you leave, however,"" said Arthur Chester, standing next to the enormous front door, ""I would like to give you all a parting gift.""

He snapped his fingers, and a butler and housemaid brought out the copies of Arsene Lupin.  Some were terribly excited by this, and some cast short smiles, but all were pleased to receive their parting gift, even if it was a fake.

""I believe,"" continued Arthur Chester, ""that we should all give our thanks to Vincent Jefferson.  For without him, we wouldn't have had this delicious comedy that we have now!""

Everyone laughed except Dr. Hadean, who quietly accepted his painting, and stole out the door.  Each person carefully surveyed the paintings before choosing the one that they believed looked most authentic.

""Bethany...""

Bethany Shadows was the second-to-last to leave, and Martin Pershing stood without a painting, casting his eyes upon Bethany.  Her figure was faintly visible in the dark outside...

""Thank you for a great time,"" Martin said awkwardly, as he held out his hand for her to shake.  Bethany grabbed his hand and seemed as if she wanted to kiss him, but Martin refused.  He simply smiled and let her walk out the door with her painting being carried out to the car by two maids.

""Well,"" said Louisa Chester.  ""I bid you good night.""  It wasn't subtle by any means of the word.

Martin examined the backs of the remaining paintings quickly, and chose one.  He waved good night and carried the painting out to a delivery truck.  Arthur Chester had evidently ordered one for every guest, so the truck could follow the guest to their abode, and deliver it properly.  Martin handed a small slip of paper to one of the maids as she opened the door to the delivery truck.  He also handed a small slip of paper to the man driving the delivery truck.

""That's strange,"" said Arthur Chester, after Martin Pershing had left.

""What's strange?"" asked Louisa Chester.

""It's strange that that queer fellow would go one way to his house, while the truck driver should take another way...""

The maid rushed back into the mansion and said, ""This is addressed to you from that Mr. Martin Pershing.""  She continued inside to finish the rest of her menial tasks.

""What is it?"" asked Louisa Chester with little interest.

She got no response, however.  Arthur Chester stood in the doorway, with the door still open.  His eyes were wide and his mouth was slightly agape.  The paper dropped to the floor.  Writing was all over the front and back of the sheet.

""Arthur?""

Louisa Chester rushed to the doorway and picked up the scrap of paper.  It read:

---

Dearest Sir Arthur Jeiger Candide Frankstein Chester III, esq. and Louisa Chester:
I truly must thank the two of you for allowing me to take your prized Arsene Lupin painting.  In fact, I must thank Arthur Chester for outright giving it to me.  It really is a pleasure to be able to relieve you of such a valuable, and especially because it should belong in a museum.

You will notice that I have sent you other copies of Arsene Lupin, including the one that, no doubt, hangs in your art room right now.  It truly is a good imitation, isn't it?  Especially with that water mark.  I have taken great pains to have it created in so special a manner, but it is definitely beautiful.

But perhaps you are wondering what is my trick?  And I shall tell you!  It was very simple, actually!  All I did was send you the paintings!  I had wrapped yours in the same paper when you weren't looking, and you just assumed that the one with the water mark (which was a fake, and which I had sent you in the first place) was the real one.  Perhaps, if you did your own work and weren't so caught up in buying expensive things, you would have realized this sooner, rather than right now, for the real painting of Arsene Lupin has a dab of red paint directly behind the left eye at the back of the canvas.

I knew no one would take that one, because it appeared as if the painting was damaged.  That is why I had such an easy time receiving it from you, and for that, I truly must thank you.

You will note, Mr. and Mrs. Chester, that the water mark is the shape of a ring.  That ring signifies what else has been taken from you, and should be remembered as a token of your foolishness.

Faithfully and Sincerely Yours,
Vincent Jefferson

Louisa Chester rushed up the stairs and pushed on the lids of every jewelry box.  She approached the rather large case with the rather small ring and noticed that the ring was gone!  It was her most prized possession!  Gone!  Louisa screamed a cry of terror...

---

Martin Pershing drove home confidently, and the next day had exchanged the ring for money at a pawn shop.  He enclosed the money in an envelope along with a short message saying, ""For Child Support"", and added two addressed to the envelope.  He smiled.  He had gone into his profession for the right reasons.

Martin Pershing bought a ticket to the local museum that same day and admired the painting of Arsene Lupin.

""Arsene Lupin..."" he said to himself.  ""A man of many faces... As am I...""

Vincent Jefferson stared at himself in the glass case that housed Arsene Lupin.  He noticed the few defining features he had left.  He stared at a middle-aged man... He was still in shape... If he were ten or twenty years younger...

And his grey eyes.  They stared into the glass case with an air of mysteriousness.  Vincent Jefferson smiled.  It was his profession that was causing him such problems...  It was his profession that caused his wife to divorce him and his child to be left in someone else's hands.  It was his profession that caused such trouble, yet it was his profession that kept his child support paid.  Vincent Jefferson noticed the irony of his situation, and let out a short laugh.</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut>It was dinner time, and James had eventually joined the others after clearing his sinuses repeatedly.  Bullet stayed in the dining room as well, and a dish was prepared for him as well.

Angela sat next to her husband Bill Lightfoot.  Bill was a well-built man and apparently had loved sailing.  He seemed like a generally happy man, and was apparently belonging to some important company as well.

""We should be fine 'ere in the middle o' the ocean!"" he bellowed when being asked who was keeping the ship on its course.  ""I got me a jee-pee-ess system here that'll tell us where ta go!""

He talked like he was always drunk, but perhaps it was just his happy demeanor showing through.  He smiled in between bites of chicken and offered some to Bullet, much to West's objection.

Lance Lipson was a friend of Bill.  He worked almost at as high of a status in the company as Bill, and was an interesting contrast to Bill because he was generally quiet, but outgoing, which was in itself an interesting contrast.  Lance had slightly long dark hair for a man, but looked far more professional than Bill could ever hope to look.  He was using contacts during the cruise in place of his glasses because they were more convenient at times, or so he said.

""You sure?"" asked Lance.  ""Wouldn't want us getting lost again after that last trip...""

Sitting at the end of the table in slight isolation was Vic Caverns.  He smiled and nodded when someone asked him to pass the bread or salt, but was almost eerily quiet.  Of course, that may have been because no one had talked with him in the first place.  Vic was a little overweight and bald.  He gave the appearance of a clown with no make-up, actually.  He was invited by Angela, but...

""Do you see that?"" asked Shin'ichi.

James was sitting next to him as Shin'ichi motioned his head quickly and clandestinely toward Angela Lightfoot.  She had shot Vic a kind of strange glance... a most indescribable glance...  But it was momentary, and it was possible that it was all in their imagination.

Madison Carolina was a friend of Angela from work and looked rather tired, actually.  Her blonde hair was combed, but most untidily, and strands stuck out everywhere.  Her eyelids carried bags under them, and her eyes hinted at the tiniest suspicion of being bloodshot.  She was bigger than Angela, to say the least, and she acted as if she were permanently tired.

""I suppose,"" she said after Angela offered her some bread.

""Cheer up!"" said Angela.  ""We're on a cruise now!  No more worrying about work and such!""

Madison managed a faint smile and took some bread.

The conversation continued between the adults about investments and such.  It was quite boring, actually, and especially to Vic, whom everyone seemed to be trying to keep out of the conversation.

Dinner consisted of chicken, bread, and mashed potatoes along various vegetables and the like.  An odd meal for being out on the sea.

""How come we're not having fish?"" asked Shin'ichi as he looked out the window into the sea.  His question caused a hearty laugh from some, though not as hearty of a laugh as Bill Lightfoot's.

""You see,"" he roared, ""we're gonna be on this ship fer a while, so I figgered we'd start with land food first!""

Everyone let out a general laugh, and even the social oddities of Vic's presence seemed to die down, for it was no secret that Vic was constantly alone on the ship.

""So Vic,"" said James as the others continued conversation, ""why are you on this boat?""

""Me?"" he asked innocently.  ""That's an odd question.""

""Well, it's just... it seems like no one wants to talk to you or something..."" James trailed off.

Vic just smiled.  ""That's okay.  I'm used to it from work.  I've no doubt that I'll have fun on this cruise, anyway.""

But suddenly his face turned cold.  Vic said, ""Listen here, though, kid.  I dunno what's really going on with this ship, but I gotta tell you something... if you can keep a secret...""

But just as he was about to speak, Angela rushed out of the room and came back in with chocolate cake for dessert.  Everyone roared in delight as the cake was sliced and given to everyone.  As Angela passed the pieces of cake out, she had to crack a strange smile to Vic.  Shin'ichi observed closely as she set the plate down on the table.

""Something's strange about her,"" Shin'ichi whispered to James.  James nodded.

""What were you going to tell me about?"" asked James to Vic.

""I'll...  I'll tell you tomorrow,"" he said, starting to eat his cake.

""Well, let's all be merry!"" shouted Bill as he held up his glass of wine that was poured to everyone, save James and Shin'ichi.  Glasses tinked and everyone drank up.

""Wow!"" shouted West Courier.  ""That's some good wine!""

""Sure is,"" admitted Madison quietly but with a genuine smile.  Everyone had genuine smiles now, and perhaps this cruise wasn't as foreboding as the atmosphere suggested.

""Uh oh..."" said Bill Lightfoot.

It was a quite sudden interjection and everyone looked under the table to where Bill had to find Bullet eating a bit of chocolate cake.

""Now how'd that get there?!"" asked Bill with a sense of alarm.

James let out a silent shriek and leapt under the table, dirtying himself as he pushed Bullet away from what remained of the chocolate cake and made sure he wouldn't get any more.

""Oh, dear..."" said Madison.

""That's no good,"" said Angela.  ""Looks like he's gonna be sick...""

It was true.  Bullet had less vitality than usual.  His usually hyper-active tail was drooping now, and he looked as if he was about to fall.  James scooped up the beagle and walked off with it.

""I hope he'll be all right,"" said Lance.

---

After dinner had adjourned, everyone returned to their rooms except West Courier and Shin'ichi, who had both gone to James's room to see how Bullet was holding up.  They walked into the dark room to find Bullet sleeping and James stroking him.  The beagle's breathing was slow and its heartbeat was fast.  West Courier and Shin'ichi approached James.

""He'll be all right,"" said West without life in his voice.  ""He's young.  It'll pass through his system quickly.""

James didn't raise his eyes to look at his companions.  He just looked out the window.  Evidently, he had been scared that Bullet might have died by the incident.

After a few minutes of not saying anything, West gave James a hug and left the room, motioning for Shin'ichi to follow.  He nodded, but before leaving, turned back and said, ""I measured how much cake's in his system and how much cake was on the ground in total.  The cake would not have been enough to kill Bullet anyway, but...""  Shin'ichi hesitated.  James continued staring out the door, and reached for a tissue to blow his nose.  Shin'ichi didn't finish his thought.  He closed the door.  James blew his nose.</lj-cut>"

""And this,"" said one of the Chesters, ""is the master bedroom.""

The door was ajar, and everyone entered.  The room was about as big as the music room, but was far brighter, for the gold carpet and gold sheets and recently shined and polished bedposts reflected all light, blinding everyone who walked into the room until their pupils constricted to block out the reflections of the light and reveal that it was not only the golden sheets that reflected light, but also, when Arthur and Louisa opened several boxes, the sparkling diamonds and sapphires that shone throughout the room.  It was like being inside of the sun without the deathly heat.

""Ooh!"" sad the ladies as they followed Arthur and Louisa about the room, opening various boxes with the help of keys and, after minutes of showing off the jewelry and letting a select few ladies try it on, locking the boxes back up.  Arthur and Louisa looked inquisitively at Dr. Hadean at times as if to ask, ""Is this entirely necessary?""  Dr. Hadean gave a stern look and watched everyone's hands closely.

Martin had rejoined with Bethany.

""You found your ring,"" she noted.  Martin nodded.  ""I notice you don't have one yourself,"" he said rather suggestively.  She didn't blush at that remark, however.  Rather, she joined the other girls in remarking how beautiful the various necklaces and bracelets were, because, after all, they were quite handsome.

Martin followed Bethany around the bedroom as the Chesters continued opening the cases.  At one point, Arthur opened a rather large case for a rather small ring.  Martin looked at it longingly as the others handled it.  He remembered his own ring, and how it used to glisten like that...

""May I see the ring?"" Martin asked lamely as Arthur was about to replace the ring in its case.  Martin and Arthur were the only two gathered around the ring at this point, as everyone else passed on to the next case.

""Certainly,"" said Arthur obnoxiously as the ring passed from his feminine hands to Martin's calloused ones.

""Rings..."" said Martin under his breath.

""Pardon?"" asked Arthur.

""I... It's nothing.  It's just that I-""

Martin had no time to finish his story as Arthur whisked the ring fron Martin's hand and shoved it back in the box, locking it as he rejoined the rest of the group.  Martin stayed a few seconds more muttering something about how Arthur was phony before continuing.

The journey continued when Skip Carter rushed out of the room.  Dr. Hadean stopped him.

""Where do you think you're going?!"" he asked.

""I'm going down to the music room to get my drink,"" he explained in nasal English.  His voice was obnoxious, though not quite as obnoxious as Arthur Chester's.

Dr. Hadean let him pass when Kerry Manfred, showing no signs of turning sober soon, made his way clumsily to the door.  Dr. Hadean stopped him as well, asking him what he thought he was doing.

""Outter ma' way!  I gotter go!""

""Go where?"" Dr. Hadean asked, without showing signs of moving.

Kerry whispered something into the detective's ear, and the detective let him pass, blushing slightly as he did.

""Down the hall to your right!"" Dr. Hadean shouted behind him.

---

Another half hour or so had passed.  Skip and Kerry had already returned, and the tour of the bedroom was about to conclude.

""So we should be moving... yes?""

Arthur was about to make a transition to another room when a housemaid approached him and whispered something into his ear.

""What are you talking about?"" he demanded.

""Well, I don't know, but the painting's-""

The maid had no time to complete her thought as Arthur rushed downstairs and everyone followed him.  Arthur shoved the butler aside and thrust the doors open to the music room.

""What's the meaning of this?!"" demanded Arthur as he turned to the butler, who was just recovering from his fall when Arthur grabbed him from the collar.  ""What the hell happened here?!""

""I don't know sir,"" said the butler with as much dignity as he could muster, which wasn't much at all.  Arthur dropped him to the ground as he straightened his collar.

By this time, everyone had entered the room and stood with an expression of shock.  Everyone was staring at a fifteen by twenty foot blank wall where the Arsene Lupin painting once stood.  Disbelief spread throughout the whole room, but the impossible was true!  Arsene Lupin had vanished!</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut>""If it isn't Detective West Courier!""

""Angela!""

The three had arrived to the yacht.  It was still raining, though not as badly as before.  Unfortunately for James, his cold wasn't showing signs of letting up any time soon.

""James, I remember you, too!""

Angela Lightfoot was an old friend of West Courier.  The two had met in college and had run into each other in the occasional coffee shop at least once a week.  Angela was a very beautiful woman, in fact.  Her beautiful blonde hair flowed down her sides and back.  She normally wore slightly more clothes in the form of shorts and a short T-shirt, but today she was in a raincoat, and even at her age, she was a damn beautiful sight to behold, or so West Courier thought.  He didn't however, have quite the right mind to marry her, partially because she was already married herself, though other guys at the coffee shot always tended to forget between her beautiful blue eyes and blonde hair.

West Courier, on the other hand, was an interesting contrast.  He was in his middle-ages like her, only he had a permanent five o'clock shadow and a dark face that suggested being out in the sun for a long time, yet not quite sunburned.  Everywhere he went, West had a hat on, and so when he took it off, it was natural that it should be permanently messy underneath.  Today, he was sporting a sweater and baseball cap.  The perfect clothing for rainy weather.  His dark hair and dark eyes shone underneath that cap and had a strange light to them, creating a strange contrast to the rest of his face.

""So we're the first one here?"" West assumed.  James let out a sneeze and Angela let out a laugh.

""Actually, you happen to be the last ones here,"" she giggled.  Angela led the way as West and James boarded the yacht.

""Small party, huh?"" West asked as he noticed four others being the only ones on the ship.  It wasn't large enough to accomodate as much as an ocean liner at all, so naturally James looked inquisitively to his uncle.

""Were can we throw our stuff at?"" asked West as he waved to the other four.

""Over here,"" Angela said, directing West and James downstairs into the boat.  The layout of the boat was as follows:

---
Kitchen || West's Room | James's Room || Vic's Room | Madison's Room
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Stairs | HALLWAY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dining || Angela's Room | Bill's Room || Lance's Room | Shin'ichi's Room
---

So upon entering the yacht, West, James, and Angela passed by the kitchen and dining rooms and took a left into West Courier's room, where half of the luggage was dropped off.  The three then went into James's room to drop off the other half of the luggage, as well as the dog cage.  Bullet was let loose then, and darted like a madman up the stairs to enjoy the rain.

""It's a little late to ask if that was okay,"" muttered West under his breath.  Angela only let out a slightly seductive smile.

""Maybe I should introduce you to everyone else on the yacht?"" she asked.  West agreed to it, but James used his nose as an excuse to stay in his room.  The two went up to the deck, as James stood in his room.

It was a fair room.  There was a bed and a restroom that he shared with his uncle.  There was a separate door that opened to his uncle's wood.  It seemed as if the entire room was made of wood.  The floor, wood, and ceiling all shone a dull brown, though James could tell that it was well taken care of, due to the visible water droplets on the ground from tracking footprints.

""Wax has been newly applied, else the water would have gotten into the wood,"" James observed to himself.  He smiled.  He was sick, but he still had his mental capacities intact.

James walked around to the other rooms, taking a peek inside.  He walked across the hallway to Angela's room, then to Bill's room, then Lance's room, and noticed that they were all basically set up the same way as his own room, even with the fresh water droplets on the ground and the packed luggage.  Evidently, the guests hadn't bothered to open up their luggage, and preferred to look on deck for the final passengers who had arrived about five minutes ago now.  James also noted the adjacent rooms between Angela and Bill, and Lance and Shin'ichi.  Of course, James hadn't known these names without any clues; signs on the doors made it all too obvious.

James had also checked on Vic's and Madison's rooms to find they were the same.  He finally made his way to Shin'ichi's room.  Turning the handle, he found its occupant still inside!

""Ah!"" said James, taken aback.  He thought it strange that the room's occupant happened to be no older than seven years old.  The kid pushed his glasses up and let out a short chuckle.  He was dressed rather oddly in blue shorts and a blue tuxedo coat, under which a boetie was present.  The kid was, evidently, the only one caring to unpack his clothes before looking around the yacht.

""Sorry!"" James exclaimed.  He noticed the kid's eyes darting very quickly around the room before giving a proper response.

""That's okay!"" he said with a big smile.  James couldn't see his eyes, but there was something... unnatural about them... even if they were just the normal shade of brown.

""My name's James Hamish,"" James said sheepishly, holding out his hand.

""I'm Shin'ichi!  Shin'ichi Cohen!"" the boy said.  ""You know, it's a good thing you took a shower after running this morning, or you might be all smelly!  Of course, you shouldn't have been running in the rain in the first place, which is why you have that cold!""

""Ahahaha!"" James laughed.  ""I suppose I shouldn't...!?""

James stopped and his face grew suddenly serious.  How did he......?

Shin'ichi smiled and handed James a tissue.

""It's simple!"" Shin'ichi explained, after studying James's face.  ""The back of your shoes have mud on them, so you obviously must have been running, and running this morning, because that was the only time you could get mud on your shoes and have the mud still on right now.  Also, there's no mud tracking on the bottom of your shoes, so you must have gone back indoors with a lot of time to spare before leaving to come here.  I noticed that you backed away from the door quickly when you saw someone was in my room, so you had to have some kind of courtesy, especially with how fast you apologized!  It would only make sense that you would have had enough courtesy to take a shower before you came here!  And I knew you had a cold because... well... you were sneezing!""

Shin'ichi stood with that cryptic smile on his face that James started to grow amazed and scared of.  He'd hardly seen the kid for ten seconds and already he was able to deduce all that!

""How.... how did you know all that... so quickly?"" said James in slight amazement.

""Well, it just makes sense!"" said Shin'ichi.

""Hah!  Well, you ARE a strange kid, I suppose,"" said James noting his odd dress and lack of books and video games.  ""I suppose you've come here with family because you were forced to.""

""Well, I did come here with family,"" admitted Shin'ichi, ""but not because I was forced to...""

""In that case,"" said James, ""you came to... study people?""

Shin'ichi nodded and pushed his glasses up.

""It's too bad,"" said Shin'ichi, ""that no one else unpacked their stuff.  Otherwise we might be able to learn more about them, too!""

James smiled back at the kid as he rushed out the door to the deck.

""What a strange kid,"" James repeated to himself.</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut>Martin followed Dr. Hadean and Arthur out the library.  Arthur returned to the dining room where guests were drinking wine and whatnot and announced that it was time for the ""grand tour"".

We were a few dozen people in all, though many people weren't exactly interesting to Martin.  He noted the jewelry flashing around their arms and necks, the husbands flirting and the wives chirping, and almost all of whom were talking about how much their new yachts cost or how much their diamond ring was.  Martin looked at his right hand where his wedding ring rested.  It used to be a dazzling ornament of gold.  Simple yet amazing.  But now, it was growing dull, and the luster had left long ago.

Martin spied one female in particular who caught his attention.  She dressed more conservatively than the others and had nothing shining on her save her two diamond earrings.  Her necklace was a dull gold that would have matched perfectly with Martin's ring.

The lady caught Martin staring at her and blushed slightly.  Her face was just as beautiful red as it was in its normal shade of white.  She wore makeup, sure, but not so much as to look like a clown.  She kept her hair tied in a bun, and it gave her the appearance of the typical secretary.

""I'm sorry..."" Martin said sheepishly.

""Oh, I...""  She held out her hand and offered her name.  ""My name is Bethany Shadows.""

Martin grasped it firmly and offered his own to her.  ""Martin Pershing.""

""So what do you do?"" asked Bethany.

The conversation continued as the two passed various rooms which, though impressive from the inside, added absolutely nothing to the house except as a storage for fancy vases and pictures and the like.

Eventually, they reached the music room.  The room was located in a corner of the house and, as if the shining black grand piano in the center of the room didn't say enough, there were imported red drapes hanging over the windows, more vases that held no flowers, and...

""The painting of Arsene Lupin!""

Arthur announced it in his usual voice and over-pronounced the nasal parts of the French name.  The painting was, of course, beautiful, and everyone stood in awe.

Martin and Bethany were standing together by a window.  Bethany wasn't exactly excited by the picture, but gave it her attention.

""Is this the picture,"" Martin asked aloud, ""that that man Vincent Jefferson proposed to steal?""

The room was quickly silenced by this question as everyone quickly recalled the message that Dr. Hadean had apparently shown everyone.  A few people let out laughs including a man who appeared borderline drunk.

""Well, if that idiot Vinshent Jeffershon thinksh he c'n shteal thish painching,"" said the bloated man through his moustaches, ""then let him try!  There ain' no way shomeone can carry thish thing outta here wishout bein' notished!""  The man's wife then apologized for her husband, Kerry Manfred, acting as he did, and told him that she wished that he wouldn't act so.

""I c'n act any way I wanner, Josie!"" Kerry shouted.  Josephine was her true name, and she looked very ashamed at this remark.  Her wavy hair seemed to grow untidy the angrier she got with him.  Josephine pulled on Kerry's ear and, holding the ear in one hand and her dress in the other, made her way to another room to yell at him.

Indeed, it was true, for the painting stood at least 15 feet by 20 feet, and it would be no easy task fitting it through the window Martin happened to be looking out of, much less carrying it right out of the party through the front doors without someone noticing.

Martin had reverted his gaze to the window, for he thought he noticed something move...

""Did you see that?"" he asked, shaking Bethany's shoulder.  She turned her head outside and told him she didn't see anything.

""I could have sworn someone was outside..."" Martin explained.  He searched the window for a little longer, then shrugged his shoulders, blaming it on the wind.

""In any case!"" said Arthur Chester, regaining control of his crowd, ""It will be impossible for him to enter and leave the place undetected!  For you see, the painting will not fit through any window, and will only fit through the door you just entered.  However!  The door, as you have noticed, is guarded by one of my butlers, a Mr. Stiles and a most respected man who has worked for me for many years!  Mr. Stiles is perfectly capable of seeing someone carrying a 15 by 20 foot canvas outside of the room, and so it is impossible for the painting to be stolen!""

There was some applause from the group.  Bethany and Martin clapped their hands as well, as Josephine and Kerry returned.  Arthur Chester was about to continue his tour of the place when a butler walked into the room with something rather large and rectangular shaped wrapped in brown paper.

""Where shall I put this, sir?"" the butler asked, sweating.

""You should leave it here!"" announced Arthur Chester, ""and I should open it when the guests are gone, so as not to disturb them.""

The room was about as big as a small house anyway, so there was no trouble fitting such a big package into the room with the grand piano and the dozens of guests occupying it as well.

""But don't you believe,"" Bethany asked Martin at length, ""that the painting might sooner or later be stolen?  After all, he is the great Vincent Jefferson.""

""Vincent Jefferson,"" said Dr. Hadean, entering the conversation without warning, ""is just a man.  He won't be able to remove the painting from this house without passing through that door.  He can't make paintings vanish into thin air!  He will have to abide by the laws of physics, and if he tries to steal from this house tonight, he will also have to abide by the laws of the state.""  Dr. Hadean had been studying the crowd closely while he said this to Bethany and Martin and remarked, ""Though I would keep an eye on that Skip Carter.  His name and person suggest something.... strange...""  And he left the two to study more about Skip Carter.

Skip Carter stood admiring not the picture, rather, the piano in the room.  His hair was sleek and stayed in place.  His hands looked rough, as well as his shoes, and he had eyes that were almost as shifty as the detective's, though the color of them suggested a kind of evil behind them.  Besides that, he had the wonderful facade of being pleasant toward every other guest.

""We should continue our tour, though,"" said Arthur Chester, as he led everyone out the door.

As the guests were leaving, Martin began kneeling onto the ground and pressing the red carpet for something.

""What are you looking for?"" asked Bethany.

""It's just my ring,"" said Martin.  ""I'll be fine looking for it alone.  It can't have gone far.""

""I'll see you later on the tour then?"" asked Bethany.  Martin smiled and nodded, and he was left alone to look for his ring, for he had been fidgeting with it while staring at Bethany, wondering what it was like to be married... to be in love...  Wondering why that one thing would have separated himself from his former wife...</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut>It was the last day before the cruise.  The last day of freedom.  The last day a teenager could really run free before being locked up and stored away in a ship for a week.

It was raining outside.  Not exactly ideal conditions to be practicing parkour, but James Hamish figured it would help his balance.  He'd become fairly skilled in the rain; the last time he twisted his ankle was months ago, and it had fully healed.

James ran in sweats and a T-shirt.  His ideal training clothes.  From first glance, one might be led to believe that James was actually running just like everyone else in the morning, the only difference being that he was running unusually earlier than anyone else.  Four o'clock to be exact.  James was sure that he wouldn't therefore attract the attention of little kids and cops.  It was just the right time so there would be no drunk drivers for cops to watch out for, and too early for parents to be worried about their kids copying that ""irresponsible teenager.""

It was true, he had badly damaged his right leg while practicing once, which explained his natural limp.  His uncle, Detective West Courier (a man blessed with two last names), was surely surprised to find his nephew limping back to his door with a broken leg, and even moreso when he found out that he had broken his leg out ""jogging"".

In any case, that was years ago, and he was much more skilled now, as he easily cleared a five-foot wall and landed in someone's back yard.  That was another advantage at being up at four o'clock.  People were rarely up at that time, and even if they were up, they'd be too dazed to get a good look at anyone in their yard and might dismiss it as having been a memory from a dream.

James kicked off a wall to scale an eight footer.  He himself was nearing six feet in height, and by standing on tip-toes alone could not have easily climbed over the wall.

""It should be useful,"" James thought to himself when he first started the ""sport"".  ""It should be useful, though I have no idea what for.""

James was back on a sidewalk after venturing through a few more back yards.  He checked his watch.  It was digital and he never wore it except for training, because he didn't like how it looked.  His dark brown hair bobbed against his head as he continued jogging and checking his watch.  Four-thirty.  He had to shower and such before it was time to leave for the cruise.  James took a right and scaled another wall, walking along the top of it until he came back into his own back yard.  He jumped the gate to get into the front yard and entered his home like a proper gentleman, soaked with a disgusting mixture of sweat and rainwater.  His outdoor sneakers were lined with mud and dog feces.  He smelled as nice as his uncle's breath, as his uncle had not yet brushed his teeth.

""Break anything?"" his uncle asked, staring at the morning newspaper.  The wet casing lay on the table.  It was the weather page today, as if his uncle couldn't tell what the weather was like outside.

""You shouldn't run in the rain.  You might catch a cold,"" his uncle told him.

""That hasn't been scientifically proven,"" said James as he removed his once-white shoes.  He wiped the water off of his face to find that the gesture had only succeeded in making his face wetter.

""I'm taking a shower,"" James reported.  His uncle, West Courier, nodded and sipped some black coffee, that had effectively stained his teeth over the years, though he managed to hide it with teeth-whitening kits.  He and James had gotten into an argument about whether coffee or tea was better.  West sided with coffee.

""I packed your stuff already,"" West barked to James.

""Thanks, dad.""

The door shut.  The sound of the shower was audible throughout the quiet and dark household.  Bullet, James's dog, had just awaken and rushed downstairs to give West Courier the usual greetings, characterized by jumping on the table, slipping on the wet cloth, and giving West's face various licks until West placed Bullet back on the ground.  West took a cup of water and walked outside.  About a minute later, he filled Bullet's bowl with fresh rainwater.  Bullet showed his eternal gratefulness by running outside and gathering the water on his coat before West chased him back into the house.  The cage was set next to the luggage, all of which was to the side of the front door and ready to depart.  Bullet was evidently coming to the cruise as well.

West seemed satisfied with his paper and folded it back up.  James rushed downstairs, having finished his shower, and hugged Bullet.  The little beagle was happy to see anyone and everyone, and would therefore find himself at home on the cruise.

""Ready?"" West asked.

James grabbed a banana and devoured it quickly.  He nodded after a short fifteen second interval consisting of digestion.

""Let's go.""

West grabbed the rest of the luggage and piled it into the car.  James let Bullet into the cage.  As West went to lock the door, James let out a sneeze.  Bullet barked, and West said with an air of triumph, ""I told you so.""</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut>It was that time of the month again.  Time to pay the child support, and, as usual, Martin Pershing was having a hard time finding the money to pay for it.  Of course, he would have to resort to his last resort once again.

It was years since Martin Pershing had divorced his wife, but not soon enough to avoid having a child.  The divorce was made for one of the strangest of reasons, though it made perfect sense.  After all, Martin Pershing and his wife were absolutely compatible in every way imaginable.  They loved the same movies, the same food... they always did nice things for each other, held doors open, pulled out chairs, had a little fun...  Yet it was one simple reason that the wife decided to break away from Martin's wife.

Martin looked at himself in the mirror.  He had hardly recognized his figure.  He stared at a middle-aged man.  A balding middle-aged man at that, though a stylish hat would easily cover that up.  He was still in shape, and was grateful for his health, though.  He still had all his teeth, and they were as pearly as ever.  If he were ten or twenty years younger, he wouldn't be able to walk out in public without girls from all directions mauling him.  

But perhaps his most mysterious feature was his grey eyes.  No one had eyes quite like them.  The eyes caught everything, but were very secretive about it.  They were quite mysterious in that they told nothing about the man to those who knew nothing about him, yet everything about the man who truly knew him.  Martin placed some eye contacts in and blinked furiously until the contacts found their place in his eyes, darkening the grey and producing a natural brown.

Martin knew he could get his money soon, and therefore he was not distressed at all in attending a friend's party.  After checking to see if he looked his finest in his dark suit, Martin left his apartment.

---

It was a gaudy mansion of three stories, and it almost hurt one's eyes as they strained to see the entire mass of the building at once.  It was a typical dream mansion with windows staring outside every room and light emitting from all rooms as well.  If the outside was gaudy, however, the inside was just disgusting.  Chandeliers hung from every ceiling and lit up the room as if the sun never went down.  It was all so beautiful with the perfectly polished wooden doors and the rugs from all over the world spread on top of the perfectly polished wooden floor.  There was not a speck of dust out of place, and Martin noted all of this as he took his first few steps into the abode of Sir Arthur Jeiger Candide Frankstein Chester III, esq., or Arthur as he demanded everyone call him, except his various housemaids and servants who had to refer to him by Mr. Chester.

""Gaudy,"" Martin muttered under his breath.

""You like it?"" Arthur asked, as he walked into the foyer and approached the front door.  ""The foyer,"" thought Martin to himself, ""must be the most useless room mankind has created.""

""It's......"" Martin was apparently at a loss for words.

""It's marvellous, isn't it?"" asked Arthur in a borderline feminine voice.  He looked borderline feminine himself, with his over-polished shoes, lint-free coat, and glossily moussed brown hair.  Martin almost winced looking at the shiny, almost fake figure standing in front of him.  He smiled and outstretched his hand.

""Come, come, the guests are waiting,"" said Arthur as he shoved Martin in front of him.

There were guests all right.  Martin hadn't really noticed who any of them were except Arthur's wife, Louisa Chester; and a detective, Dr. Hadean.  Arthur's wife was almost as gaudily dressed as the house.  A glittering dress of jewels draped her body and reflected every light that shone upon them.  Louisa was probably twenty, and was obviously far too young for Arthur.  Her dark brown hair flowed down her Russian body.  Diamond necklaces lined her neck and golden bracelets covered her arms so the perfect skin underneath might be preserved.  She was almost fake, thought Martin to himself.

Dr. Hadean, on the other hand, was dressed in a dirty suit and wore a ruffled moustache.  His hair was hastily brushed for the occasion, and it showed.  Dr. Hadean's eyes darted left and right quickly to evidently collect suspicious activity, though Martin saw none to detect.

""Ladies and gentlement,"" Arthur anounced in a projected, feminine voice.  ""May I present to you my friend Martin Pershing.""

It was as if applause should be heard at that point.  Martin felt awkward, as he didn't know whether or not to bow or walk away shamefully for a lack of applause, though evidently none was to be expected, as the others resumed their talk.  Louisa approached them, and after a long and unnecessary embracement with her supposedly legally married husband, who, with no doubt, had already married many women of tewnty before and would marry many women of twenty after having finished with Louisa, shook hands with Martin.

""Pleasure,"" blurted out Martin.

""Oh, the pleasure's all mine,"" said Louisa with as much sex as she could put into her words

""Might I ask,"" said Martin as he turned to Arthur, ""why the good Detective Hadean is here?""

""Everyone's been asking us all night,"" remarked Louisa.  ""It is rather annoying that he should get more questioning than me,"" she said out of jealousy.

""It's an interesting story, really,"" said Arthur, ignoring his wife.  ""I suppose you might have him come over and he should tell you himself.  Oh, Dr. Hadean!""

Dr. Hadean looked up from his observations and walked over to Arthur.  Dr. Hadean happened to be wearing boots to the occasion, which clunked everywhere he happened to walk.

""Dr. Hadean, I believe you should have the honors of telling Martin why you are here.""

""Right,"" said Dr. Hadean after studying Martin carefully.  Dr. Hadean led Martin into a library room that was unusually quieter than the rest of the house.  Dr. Hadean closed the door and looked about the bookshelves to be sure that no one was there before he began his explanation.

""You see, actually, the Chesters have received a.. well... a message.  A kind of threat...""

Dr. Hadean studied his reactions carefully, but Martin had little.  Death was the first thing that crossed his mind, though the second thing was easily theft.

""It is a threat of... well, perhaps you should read it yourself.""

Dr. Hadean produced an envelope from his inside sleeve and handed it to Martin.  He unfolded the envelope and the message inside.  The message was a letter addressed to Arthur and Louisa and read as follows:

Dearest Sir Arthur Jeiger Candide Frankstein Chester III, esq. and Louisa Chester:
I have come to acquire your most valued treasure, that is, that prized painting of Arsene Lupin.  I shall arrive at the Thirtieth of July to retrieve it, unless you feel at liberty to deliver it to me.

Faithfully Yours,
Vincent Jefferson

It was the well-known thief Vincent Jefferson!  Martin recalled the date as being July 30!  What an excitement the party now appeared to be after the revelation of a possible thief among the party guests!

""And have you caught him yet?"" Martin asked.

Dr. Hadean gave him a cold glance that told him that Vincent Jefferson was, evidently, still at large.

""That is all you need to know,"" said Dr. Hadean as he took the envelope and message back.

""Excuse me, sirs!"" said Arthur as he came bounding into the room as if skipping through a field of flowers and daffodils.  ""We are about to display the fabulous painting of Arsene Lupin!  Won't you join us?""

And the three left the library room to see the painting that this Vincent Jefferson proposed to steal.</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut>It was as if time was frozen.  The gun clicked.  Vincent stared into the deep chambers of the gun and let out a small smile.

""I knew it.""

It was as if time was frozen.  Brett stood waiting for the bullet to leave the gun.  Another click.

""It's no use trying,"" explained Vincent.  ""I already emptied the bullets, actually.""

And as Brett checked the cartridge, Vincent jumped on him and pinned him to the floor.  A security guard passed by and rushed to the scene.  Another student had run off to tell security in the apparent confusion.

""Actually,"" Vincent said, ""the gun never left your back pocket.""

And there it was.  The policeman pulled it out of Brett's pants and stuck it in his own.

---

""So how'd you know?"" asked Alia anxiously, during History class.

""Simple.  He was the only one with the strange reaction.""  Vincent tried to pay attention, but diplomatic resolves weren't exactly an interesting point in history, even if they were important.

""But I thought you bought those smoke bombs from him.""

""Yeah.  So?""

""So... wouldn't his behavior be... well... not strange?""

Vincent looked at Alia as if she were stupid.  ""Of course it was strange!  It's not like he knew what I was going to do with those.""

""Well fine,"" Alia said with resignation.  ""Even if that's so, how would that have told you who the... er... culprit would be?""

Vincent shrugged.  ""Simple psychology.  He had a gun.  He wouldn't care about his own life if he was going to go to a high school loaded with security guards to kill someone.  He clearly didn't value his own life.  Hence the set-up.""

It was all so simple when he explained it, Alia thought.

""Well, how did you know it would be a gun?"" Alia asked.

""What else could you possibly bring in time?  If that person was going to glow up the school, he'd be making announcements weeks before.  The fact that the announcement came only yesterday led me to believe that it wasn't a bomb, because bombs take quite a bit of preparation.  So what else could possibly be smoke?  Smoke bombs?  A simple prank.  I figured I'd be more prepared for something more drastic.""

""And how'd you know that Brett had a gun in the first place?""

""What else would he possibly have brought?""  Vincent said it matter-of-factly, but it was a weak argument.

""But some bombs can be prepared quickly..."" Alia rebutted.

""I took my chances.""

Vincent was staring straight at the board, and Alia felt a pang of shock run through her body.  Had he really not known what kind of weapon it would be?

""Look, if it was a bomb anyway, I would have stopped him before he could plant it.  The fake gun was a dual-purpose.  If he had a gun, it would serve as a decoy.  If he had a bomb, I could threaten him with it.""

Vincent continued scribbling notes.

""It was ingenious, pretending to take his gun while dropping a decoy,"" Alia noted.  Vincent let out a short smirk.

""Wait a second.""  Alia turned to Vincent as he continued writing.  ""Don't tell me that wasn't part of your plan...!!""

Vincent didn't lift his head to turn to her.  He said simply, ""You'll never know, because a magician never reveals his tricks.""</lj-cut>"

During all the confusion, Vince had finally come out of wherever he was, and Alia found him.  They were outside and away from the now smoky auditorium.

""Where the hell were you?"" Alia cursed.

""I'm fine, thanks.  Tell me, did you happen to see anyone else acting strange?"" asked Vince.  Alia shook her head in a mixture of disbelief and anger.

""You know what happened in there?"" asked Alia.  Vince made no response, rather he was looking very carefully at everyone running from the building.

""You didn't see anyone acting strange?"" Vince asked again.

""No!"" Alia yelled in annoyance.  Vince shrugged his shoulders.

""Only three people had strange reactions... well, four if you count myself.  Anyway, there's you, John Roberts, and Brett Lester.  Now, I'm going to discount myself, because I know I'm not the one to start the thing tomorrow.""

""You gonna discount me, too?"" asked Alia.  Vince cast a strange glance at her and said, ""Possibly.""

He continued, ""You acted strange because you didn't immediately panic, rather you looked around for something.  But that's not really a strange reaction, I suppose...

""There were two other strange reactions.  John Roberts hit the floor pretty fast and looked like  he was anticipating something... bigger... than a fire.

""Then there was Brett Lester.  He was acting a bit too calmly...""

Vince looked as if he might continue, but took a pause and stopped.

""And...?"" Alia asked in slight excitement.

""And... I think I'm going to have to get a toy gun.  Or one with empty cartridges.  Know where I can find one, Alia?""

Alia's father happened to be a detective, actually, and it was entirely possible that he did, indeed, have a gun, but unfortunately, Alia admitted that he wasn't the kind of detective to carry a gun.

""Toy gun it is then,"" remarked Vince.

---

4/20.  Vince's eyes darted down the hallway.  He saw no one except his target, but even that he did not see.  Vince patted his pocket to check for the gun.

""Where is he...""  Vince walked briskly down every hallway in search of that person...

And there he was.  Brett Lester.

""Simple,"" Vince thought.  ""Just like yesterday.  Just like every time before that.""

Vince held the gun concealed in one hand and followed Brett.

""He won't notice...""

Vince caught a glimpse of the gun tucked in the back of Brett's pants.  No belt.  It would be easy.

Vince checked before he was going to do it...  No one else was with Brett.  Hardly anyone in sight.  Vince walked right behind Brett.

""Sh--!!""

Something went wrong after Vince brushed against Brett.  He... tripped.  The gun fell from Vince's hand and clattered onto the floor.  Brett looked down in slight disbelief as his gun lay on the floor.  Vince reached out a hand to recover the weapon.  Brett dove for it...  The few people who were in the hallway either stood still in shock or else ran off.

A hand grabbed the gun.  It was sweaty and trembling and would have dropped the gun, but the second hand secured it.  Both hands held the gun to Vince's head.  No one was close enough to stop Brett.

A finger rested on the trigger of the gun.  Vince shook his head as if to tell him not to ""do it"".  It was hopeless, though, and Vince knew it.

Brett gave no warning.  A flick of a finger.  The trigger was pulled.</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut>It was the next class period.  History.  Usually rather interesting for Vince, but not today.  He needed to think about who could possibly have a weapon... or perhaps, what kind of weapon could they possibly have?  Would they have a weapon in the first place?

""What's up?""

Vince turned his head to the right, his slightly long and slightly greasy hair flying as he did so.  He caught eyes with Alia Elwood.  She had short blonde hair, which was an interesting contrast to his own hair.  Alia cared about her hair and her nails and whatnot, but wasn't obsessive about it; her nails were, in fact, real.  She was wearing dark clothes as she usually did, and one might mistake her for a goth or something of the like, if it weren't for her bright yellow hair.

Alia and Vince were friends.  They seemed like they might be rather close, but neither of them would admit it.

""It's nothing.""  Vince made a poor attempt to brush her attention away, but she pursued.

""Nothing, huh?"" she asked.

""That's right, nothing.""

""That must be a really important nothing if you're not even paying attention to class...""

The history teacher shot a quick glare at the two of them beforeresuming his lecture.

""I'll tell you later,"" Vince whispered.

""Let's at least get the weapon,"" Vince thought to himself.

""Okay, well, 'up in smoke seems' like the best clue.  Up in smoke...  A fire?  No, too easy.  Fires can just be stopped by fire extinguishers.  They'll want something a lot more dangerous, I think...

""A bomb?  Maybe.  But why wait until today to post the message for tomorrow?

""The message was posted today because...?  Because the person had just thought of it yesterday...?  If that's the case, then they wouldn't have had time to properly prepare a bomb...  They also probably wouldn't have had enough time to get a group of people in the act...

""So there's a high possibility that the person's working solo...  Okay, if the person's working solo...  What could the person possibly do...?

""Smoke... Let's see... a rudimentary bomb would be made of gunpowder mostly...  A gun?

""Right, I'll look out for people who have guns,"" Vince concluded.

""Then the question becomes one of who would have a gun...  Most high schoolers aren't old enough to own guns...  In fact, the only people I could think of as having guns would be faculty...  But I don't think a faculty member would have a gun...  Nor would they bring it to school...

""Though it is a possibility.  But what other possibilities...?

""The kid could steal a gun from their parent!

""That means the kid must be a child of either a hunter or a policeman...  But policemen always carry their guns around.  They'll know if it's missing...  And the kid probably is going to carry around a handgun, so it probably won't be a gun that a hunter uses...""

Vince sat in thought, but wasn't quite able to think of how a student would get his hands on a gun without anyone noticing...

""Did you hear...?!""

Vince turned to his right again.  Alia was whispering to him.

""Did you hear,"" she restarted, ""that John's house was broken into a month ago?""

Vince's eyes lit up.  There was that other possibility which he didn't even think of...!

John Roberts was a fellow student who happened to be sitting two rows to the left of Vince.  For the past week, John Roberts had been quieter than usual.  His appearance now was quite different than the John Roberts before the burglary.  His eyes were always sagging and he was constantly irritated and paranoid.  No one could blame him, though, after that burglary.

""The timing's right, actually,"" Vince said to himself...

An idea hit Vince.  There was an assembly next period.  Maybe he could...

---

""Sure, I got some!  I always got some!""

Brett Lester was always ready for school pranks.  He happened to be a sophomore like Vince, though he could pass for a junior.  Brett was more than happy to lend a friend a helping hand.

""Whatcha using it for?!"" he asked.

""Surprise,"" Vince responded coolly.

---

Assembly time.  Alia looked around for Vince, but had no luck...

The assembly was fairly large and its lighting was very old, but at least sufficient.  The thousands of kids piled into the assembly.  Even though no one knew what it was about, no one was going to miss it.  It was perfect for Vince to figure out what he wanted to know...  Though Alia wished she could find him...

Everyone was already seated when the ""guest speaker"" had arrived.  The guest speaker was to talk about school violence.  The assembly had been scheduled for some time, and it was a convenient coincidence that the threat had come on the day of the assembly.

""I'm here to talk to you today...""

The guest speaker had already introduced herself as some AIP (apparently important person), but Alia wasn't paying attention.  She wondered where Vince could be...

There was a sudden commotion and the guest speaker froze on stage.  Some kids started panicking and a few rushed outside of the assembly hall.  Alia looked behind her, and through the commotion, she could make out smoke growing near the entrance of the assembly hall...</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut>It was another boring day at Avalanche High School for Vincent Jefferson.  Lunchtime, and he had forgotten his lunch money once again.

Vincent was unusually short and thin, which worked to his advantage many times, what with having small hands and long fingers.  He was unusual in that his backpack didn't have what what conventional students had in their bags.  Instead of having the normal books everyone had, Vincent thought it more useful to carry jackets and hats in his bag.

Vincent surveyed his crowd quickly.  Everyone was waiting in the rancid atmosphere of week-old cheese and almost-moldy bread that would eventually form a sandwich for an unlucky customer.  Alas!  It was the only thing that school could afford when it came to food.

""I could find someone to loan me money,"" Vince thought as he stood in the long line that would eventually and supposedly lead to that moldy bread and curdling cheese.  Vince looked apathetically toward the line's destination.  His interest didn't lie in the food.

Vince noted the two people standing in front and behind him in line.  Obviously odd behavior, he thought to himself.  The one person kept looking back behind Vince to make sure of something.  He looked antsy and excited at the same time.  Vince stared ahead, but his concentration lay with the two in front and behind him.  They thought they would be sly.  He thought it was all too obvious...

The line in front moved, but the boy in front did not.  He knelt down to tie his shoe and shot a quick glance behind him.  Vince played along and pretended to trip, actually making a slightly fantastic scene as he found himself almost lying on the ground.  He felt a clumsy hand slip into his back pocket as the girl behind him seemed to trip as well.  It was almost comical.

Eventually, the three straightened themselves back up, with the two who were in front and behind Vince both standing to the front of him.  They looked almost giddy, and were clearly trying to suppress their emotions.  James gave a short smirk and while straightening his clothes out, accidentally brushed the person in front of himself as well.  It was all a rather confusing exchange and would be rather difficult to describe.

The line eventually got to the booth where the ""food"" was served.  The two kids in front looked dismayed as they unfolded a useless piece of paper.  Vince recognized it immediately and smirked.  The two kids were about to pull out their own wallets to pay for the lunch, but the boy who was previously in front of Vince apparently couldn't find his wallet.

""Hey!""

Vince stared impatiently at the two in front of him.  The girl fumbled through her back pockets for her own wallet, and found that she had two!  She handed one of them to the boy and the boy was astonished to find that he hadn't enough money for lunch himself!

After an annoyingly long amount of time, the two eventually left with a single lunch to split amongst themselves.  Vince pulled out a ten and paid for his own.

""After all, they were trying to steal from me first,"" he thought to himself.

---

The food wasn't exactly passing through Vince's digestive system too well, however.  Vince sat in a restroom stall that smelled almost as good as the cafeteria.

As he exited the stall, Vince noticed a note on the wall that wasn't there before.

""4/20: All will be in smoke.""

Vince smirked.  A death threat.  On 4/20.  Probably another rediculous prank.  Vince scanned the room quickly for the possible perpetrator, but had no luck.  He shrugged to himself.  A rediculous prank, he convinced himself.

""But I better keep my eyes peeled,"" he thought to himself...</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut>The police ended up finding arsenic in the salt.  Everything was just as James said...

They were just words, weren't they?!  We were always making fun of each other at the forensics club!  Whatever happened to the saying ""sticks and stones""?!

I looked to Shandra with her head buried in her hands.  The police came by and were reading her her rights while placing her hands in handcuffs.  She needed someone to comfort her.  But I had no idea what to do.  How could I comfort a murderer?!

""You're so cold.""

James was standing next to me as we watched Shandra stand up.  It was to be the last time I saw her.

""You're so cold, Chris.""

""You're too emotional, James.""

""You don't understand it, do you...  How much words really hurt...""

""I understand damn well...!""

""No... How would you feel being called a loser every day?  Every day for a half hour being called a loser.  Loser!  Loser!""  James turned his face to me and started pushing me.  ""Loser!  You goddamn loser!  You suck at life!  Why don't you just go crawl into a hole and die!?  You're just a bi-""

""Stop it!""  I felt water fall on my cheek.  My eyes were red.  I was watching Shandra walk past me for the last time.  She wouldn't make eye contact.

""You idiot!""  James shouted.  ""You idiot!  You're such a goddamn jerk!  They're just words, right?!  Just words, dammit!  Don't cry, you idiot!""

""Just shut up!"" I screamed back.  My face was streaming with tears.  It was too much stress at school.  It was too much stress at the forensics club.  It was too much...

James smiled and helped me up.  He motioned toward my friend Shandra.  I nodded and walked over to her.  And though she was in cuffs, I could feel her arms around me, as I hugged her for the last time.</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut>""I think it's time we all knew the truth.  I think it's time we knew the entire truth.""

James Hamish looked a great deal taller now than he was.  He had the utmost confidence in his apparent deductions.  Especially after traces of arsenic were found in the pillbox...

""It's an interesting crime, really.  It must have taken a long time to prepare for, expecially when you consider that the murder weapon was arsenic.""

James looked at the people gathered at the forensics booth.  Coach Darrell was fidgeting with his bandage.  Elias Nash was staring blankly at James.  Shandra Blunt looked half-asleep, but attentive.  Kelly Stockton set down her forensics stuff and let out a yawn.  Louis Escher looked coldly at the table.  Joan Keller, the server, stared at the table we had all previously eaten at.  Fabian Guillan, the cook, was obviously irritated with James and his arrogance.  The CSI policemen stood off to the side of the table, analyzing the other evidence.  I sat at the forensics booth and listened intently.  This was it, though what exactly, I didn't know.

""What kind of person was Danielle Glover?  She obviously wasn't exactly a nice person, even if she gave off the appearance of being so nice sometimes.  She would steal people's friends, steal people's money... she was a natural thief,"" James said with a touch of disgust.  ""But there is still the big mystery I would like to know about.  Care to explain...""

James took a dramatic pause.

""Coach Darrell?""

Everyone immediately turned to Coach Darrell, who had on the same phony smile as earlier.

""I don't know what you're talking about.""

""Well, I think you do,"" argued James.  ""How did you get that wound on your hand?  And I want the truth, Coach.""

Coach Darrell looked down at the table and looked slightly ashamed.

""I'll tell you the truth, then.""  Coach drew in a deep breath, then started, ""Well, Danielle and I were having a bit of an argument about... well...  About scalpels.

""You see, she was arguing that a pocket knife would be able to cut just as well as a scalpel.  She had hers out and was showing it to me.  I was thinking about confiscating it, as it was a weapon on school campus, but I decided to demonstrate just how much better scapels could cut than pocket knives.

""So I was demonstrating what you could do with a scalpel, and I was trying to take the pocket knife from her, but I accidentally cut myself with it.  I...""

""You got angry,"" James interrupted.  ""You started yelling at her about why knives aren't allowed at school.  You went to a back room to get some bandages, and when you were back, she already left, right?""

Coach Darrell gave a short nod.  I gave a short snicker.

""And that's the truth?"" James asked.

Coach Darrell looked down at the table and nodded.  James smiled.

""Well, that clears the mystery up.  Though I must say, it is a slightly disappointing story.""

James was about to leave again when he stopped and turned around.

""I almost forgot,"" he said stupidly and half-genuinely.  ""The murderer, right?""

""You mean Coach Darrell's not the murderer?!"" I protested.

""Of course not!"" James said matter-of-factly.  ""That's rediculous!  Why, how could he possibly poison just Danielle even though poison was found in Shandra's plate?!""

""Well,"" I began, ""he could have had the antidote in that needle, so when the cup spilled, he could have easily injected the antidote...""

""Wouldn't that hurt a little?"" James asked.  ""Wouldn't you at least feel something and move away?  Why, the needle would be broken before any medicine would pass through it!""

""Maybe Shandra simply didn't feel it!"" I argued.

""That might be so, but how did he manage to spill the drink then?"" James asked.  ""Did he know that Elias and Kelly were going to fight over a bottle of luminol?""

I thought about it for a moment.  Then the thought struck me.  Luminol.....!

""You're right,"" I started, ""but then couldn't Kelly or Elias have sprayed the luminol into the food?  After all, it is poisonous!""

James nodded his head.  ""You're grasping now.  The poison is arsenic, and arsenic is the only poison it will be.  You don't get arsenic poisoning from luminol.""

I thought harder.  There had to be something I missed.

""What about the food?  What if it was prepared with poison!?"" I asked.

""Far too dangerous.  The poison could have spread to the other foods in such a vicinity as a kitchen, though you did hit on a point that I thought of.  That's why I had the food checked...  Checked for an antidote of some sort!""

It was all making sense, but I was without any more theories.  I had eliminated all possibilities, as James had.  Or all possibilities that came to mind...

""If someone was going to poison both Danielle and Shandra,"" Kelly started.  She trailed off, but James encouraged her.

""All right,"" she continued.  ""If someone was going to poison both Danielle and Shandra,"" she said seriously, ""why was it that only Danielle died?""

""Good point!"" shouted James.  ""Though you're missing a key part of the story.  If someone was going to poison both Danielle and Shandra, why was there poison in both Shandra's food <i>and in Shandra's plate?</i>""

No one had the answer.  Except, perhaps, the killer.

""Well, it's quite simple,"" James continued.  ""The poison was in both plates because only Danielle and Shandra had the specific ingredient in their pizza.""

I ran through the list of ingredients again and protested.

""What are you talking about?"" I demanded.  ""The only thing Shandra had that was different from the others was sausage!  And even Danielle didn't have sausage!""

James smiled.  A thought hit me.

""Or are you suggesting that the cook and the waiter had poison in more than one ingredient?"" I asked.

James looked disappointed.

""I thought we already established that the murderer could not have been the cook or the server!

""Anyway, there was one ingredient that the two had.  That was... salt.""

We all looked to the salt shaker on the table.

""It was a rather well set up murder.  Don't you agree, Shandra Blunt?""

My ears perked up.  Shandra?  I looked to her, and her pupils looked smaller than usual.  There was a sense of fear in her eyes.  The sense of fear of being discovered.

""What... What are you talking about?"" she asked James.

""It's actually a simple crime,"" James said.  ""You switched out the salt that was originally on the table for a poisoned version of salt.  You knew you could poison Danielle with the salt because you ate lunch with her every day.  You knew that she would want salt with her pizza.""

""What!?"" Shandra protested.

""That's rediculous!"" I remarked.  ""What if someone else took the salt?!""

""Actually,"" James said, ""my early appearance accidentally helped out her plan.  You see, the real salt shaker was under the table.  The poisoned salt shaker was in plain sight all along!  But you could have easily knocked over the poisoned salt shaker and dropped it on the ground to switch it with the unpoisoned one!""  James drew a deep breath.  ""It really is a beautiful murder, and must have taken you a long time to work out...""

""Well, why didn't Shandra die?!"" I protested.

""Yes!  Why didn't I die?!"" she shouted.  ""What reason would I possibly have to poison myself?!""

""You didn't die... because you couldn't die.  You poisoned yourself twice over so you wouldn't die.""

James smiled.  I was utterly confused at this point.  Shandra, however, looked down to the table.  Apparently, she was found out.

""Does anyone know the story of Mithridates VI of Pontus?"" James asked.

No one volunteered an answer.  At this point, everyone in the restaurant was silent and watching James.

""Pity.  Mithridates VI took small doses of poison every day.  He took these doses of poison in small amounts at first, but eventually took more and more poison.  He didn't need a taste tester.  In fact, having a taste tester would kill more people than him eating the food himself.  Don't you see?  He grew immune to the poison by ingesting it!""

It was true.  We had read about it in forensics, though no one had associated the name ""Mithridates VI"" with the immunity to poison.

""That's why there was poison in your pillbox, right Shandra?""

James backed off.  It was Shandra's turn.

""She was always making fun of me at lunch.  Always.  She wasn't even just playing around.  She was so mean!  One day, she rolled up my sleeves and showed that I had cuts on my arms!  And she was always making fun of my clothes and my hair...

""Every day!  I would tell her to stop, but she wouldn't!  I wanted her to leave me alone.  I stopped eating with her.  I thought I had finally gotten away from her.

""But then she followed me!  Every day it was something wrong with me!  Something wrong with my body!  With my behavior!  With my head!!  I couldn't take it anymore!!

""One day, I noticed her eating her pizza with salt.  I asked her if she had always eaten her pizza with salt.  She nodded.  That's how I formulated the plan...

""I was going to make it look like the two of us were targetted.  That way, I would definitely be off the suspect list.  I built an immunity to arsenic, and I...!""

Shandra's voice trailed off...</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut>4/20.  A day that tended to be met with little enthusiasm, except that it was the day that American students would smoke weed, though this year's was different.

There was uneasy tension at the school, but hardly anybody knew what for.  At least, any of the students.  The teachers and faculty at Avalanche High School all knew what was supposed to happen that day.  They opted out of telling the parents, but there were rumors floating around.  False rumors.  And true rumors.  And it was one of the scarier rumors that was true.

But that day hadn't come yet.  It was 4/19.  Tomorrow would be the day that a catastrophe happened.  There was extra security that day, already.  There would be still more security the following day.  Some teachers had already told the teachers that they were unable to come to school the next day.  The smarter studnts decided to skip the next day.

The message was a succinct one.  It was in the boys' restroom for about an hour until security came by and erased the message.  But it was enough time for Vincent Jefferson to read the message.

""4/20: All will be in smoke.""

Vince admired the work of art with a mocking smirk.  A little magic smoke should put an end to the trick.</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut>""Strange that the poison would be found there,"" James remarked as we walked away from the table.  ""Especially because Shandra ended up unharmed...""

James and I walked past the interrogation table.  He was looking at something, but I couldn't tell what.

---

We were back at the table where the banquet was being held and James was humming to himself once again.

""No antidote in the drink... No antidote in the food...  That doesn't seem possible...  If the poison's in Danielle's and Shandra's food...""

Of course the poison could only have been one thing, so the mystery wasn't so much as how Danielle was poisoned, rather who poisoned her.  And why Shandra didn't die from said poisoning.

""Someone targetted Shandra too?  Did she know...?  Did Shandra know someone targetted her...?!""

James sat and thought, and I sat and thought.  And we sat and thought.  And then I went to look at the forensics table and what they were doing.

---

Another ten minutes passed until James came to the forensics table.  He looked enlightened.

""Do you happen to know what kind of poisoning it is?"" James asked.

Just then, policemen came through the front entrance.  It was a long while after we called, and I was losing faith in our police force.  I lost even more faith when I noticed that it wasn't even anyone useful except their forensics team.  Useless, because we'd already run the tests.

I looked around and hardly noticed how fast the time was flying.  James's eyes were becoming droopy.  Probably because he was lazy and hardly ever stayed up past 10.  It was well past 10 o'clock now.  I looked to the forensics table.  Some people were already half-asleep.  I looked to the waitress and cook.  Joan Keller, the waitress; and Fabian Gullian, the cook were prohibited from even cleaning up.  They were very annoyed that they wouldn't get to close until very late tonight.  As for me, I sighed a big yawn that was slightly infectious to others.

""Hey!""

James snapped me back to the pressing issue.  This was a murder.  I needed to stay focused.  James was staying focused.

""Do you know what the poison is?"" James asked again.

I shook my head.

""We can determine that with a few tests, thanks to the good works you guys did here!""

It was a forensic scientist.  I checked his name tag.  Nye.  It was his last name, and I didn't catch his first.

---

Another ten minutes, and Mr. Nye had his analysis ready.

""Of course,"" he told James, ""it's an incomplete analysis, but we're fairly sure the poisoning was arsenic poisoning.""

""Arsenic poisoning...""

James thanked Mr. Nye and I followed him back to the interrogation table.  James looked over the belongings once again, and picked up the syringe.  He was eyeing something else on the table, but again, I couldn't tell what.

Suddenly, James let out a short gasp and reached under the table (near my seat, actually) for what he eventually showed me was a salt shaker.

""James, what does a salt shaker have to do with this case?!""

James smiled for a few more seconds until his gaze dropped and he admitted, ""I have no idea...""

He slumped back down at the interrogation table and told me, ""I know I'm close though...""

I closed my eyes and felt as if I was about to sleep...

---

""Hey, Nye?""

""Yeah?""

""Where's Bill today?""

I opened my eyes and saw Mr. Nye and some other scientist looking at the evidence on the table.  James was humming quietly to himself.  Something like Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, but I think it was the third movement.  Something fast and exciting.

""Bill's out with Chickenpox,"" Mr. Nye said.

""That's a shame,"" the other guy said.  ""You know, at this age, I would have gotten a vaccine for that instead of getting them myself...""

I was about to sink back into sleep when James jumped from the other side of the table and shook me awake.

""Damn!  What is it, James?!  I'm trying to-""

""I've solved it!""  His eyes were droopier than a bulldog's face, but there was the faint glimmer of excitement twinkling from them.  ""I've solved it!!""</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut>""Well, you might not have thought it, but maybe someone did slip it in sometime during the dinner...""

James and I were talking at the interrogation booth.  He'd had his eyes shut and had been humming for some time now, but apparently he didn't come up with anything.  It was disappointing that even he would be stumped by this case.

James and I walked back over to the table where the crime took place.  He jotted notes as to where everyone sitting.  His notepad looked something like this:

Darrell (head)
Louis Elias
Shandra Kelly
Chris James
Danielle (empty)
(empty head)

Very rudimentary and not pretty at all, but it got the point across.

""So Danielle was sitting here, right?""

James pointed to the seat to the right of where I sat.  I nodded.

""Run down what happened.  I wasn't exactly paying attention,"" he declared.  ""The only thing that I noticed was the order the people came in.  I was second, after Shandra.  Coach arrived next.  Danielle showed up after Coach.  Elias and Kelly arrived at the same time, and Louis followed shortly after.  Then...""

""Well, I got there late... But the pizza hadn't come out yet.""

""Yes, but the drinks had,"" James said.  ""But it wasn't positive for the drinks, so that wasn't it...  You sure you didn't find anything in the drinks?""

""Nothing except syrup and carbonated water,"" I remarked.  ""Anyway, I sat down and Danielle sat down after me.  Then the pizza arrived.  The waitress handed them out herself, and no one switched plates or anything.  That, and Danielle had green peppers, and no one else ordered green peppers...""

I waited for a response.  I thought that might have been the answer, but James didn't look satisfied.  I watched to see if anything would click...

""Well, are you going to continue, or am I just going to have to sit here and stare at the table all night?!""

James was getting considerably annoyed.  He tended to do that when he couldn't solve something properly, which didn't happen to often.

""Anyway, Danielle put some salt on her plate, and then Shandra put some salt in her plate, too.  I noticed that Danielle and Shandra ate slowly.  I asked Shandra about it, and she told me that she actually stopped at a McDonald's before coming here...

""Kelly and Elias were fighting over a bottle of luminol.  It was Kelly's, I believe.  Coach told them to behave, but they ended up knocking over a drink and that caused quite a commotion.  Kelly got her luminol back and started to help wiping the drinks.  Elias just laughed.""

James's eyes widened for a second.  He asked, ""Coach rushed over between you and Danielle at that time, right?!""

""Well, I... Yes, he did.  Kelly also went across the table from Danielle.  It was such a commotion...-""

""And where was Louis?""

""Louis was standing by his seat, but he reached across the table to get the cups out of the way from getting wet.""

""And Shandra was still in her seat?""

""Yes.""

""And Elias?""

""He was in his seat, too.""

""After the mess was cleaned up, the lady came by,"" James recalled.  ""She wiped down the mess with a rag...""

""She did.  It was quite a commotion...""

I glanced at James and he was definitely thinking...

""What about after that?  Am I forgetting something?"" James asked.

I shook my head.

""After that, we finished eating.  Then coach stood up and announced the trophies, and when Danielle's name was called... well...""

I waited for James to say something...  Eventually he did...

""Well, let's get everyone's possessions.  I'm sure if we did that, we might find some more evidence implicating the murderer...  That, and I want everyone to test the food.  Maybe we missed something..."" James trailed off.

---

After another fifteen or so minutes, we got everyone's evidence on the interrogation booth's table.  James duly noted everything everyone had:

---

Coach Darrell: Backpack, notebooks, pen, pencil, syringe, trophies, box, cell phone, keys, wallet.

Elias Nash: Pocket lint, batteries, cell phone, loose change (44 cents).

Shandra Blunt: Purse, pen, pencil, notebook, Pillbox (SMTWHFS markings, separate boxes for each day of week), tissues, keys, wallet.

Kelly Stockton: Luminol, pocket knife, pen light, cell phone, wallet.

Louis Escher: Cell phone, scrapped paper, wallet.

Danielle Glover: Purse, wallet, cell phone, knife, tissues, notepad, pencil, pen.

---

James handed me Danielle's knife and I took Kelly's luminol and sprayed it.  And waited...

It took about three seconds for the knife to start turning blue.

""Guess Elias wasn't lying,"" I said.

James nodded.

""You sure you didn't find anything strange?"" asked James.

I opened my mouth to speak when a loud shriek came from the forensics table.  James and I rushed over and saw everyone else surrounding Shandra who was covering her mouth in shock.

""What is it?!"" James asked.

I thought that someone who had been in the CSI team would have known what a positive test for poison looked like.  What was stranger was that it wasn't in Danielle's plate...  It was in Shandra's.

""Well... I was hoping you might find something along the lines of an antidote, but that makes things more interesting,"" James muttered.</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut>Kelly Stockton had evidently forgotten that she was at the interrogation booth instead of the forensics booth.  Her glasses to detect luminol were still on her face, and she had the bottle of luminol on the table.  Her hair was tied back as usual in case she had the chance to investigate a murder case.  Clearly, this was her lucky day.

""Besides from being on the CSI team, how do you know Danielle?"" James asked.

Kelly was a junior, and therefore didn't really know Danielle very well.

""But I did know her through orchestra?""

""Orchestra?""

""Yeah, Dani and I played in the city youth orchestra!  We were both strings.  It's not like school orchestras where the strings get all of the melodies, though.  The strings are usually the background.

""Actually, Dani and I sat right next to each other!  I was 32nd chair and she was 31st.  I didn't really talk to her much after that incident...""

""That incident?"" James pressed.

""Well, I happen to have the best violin in orchestra,"" Kelly bragged.  ""It cost a lot of money.  That, and the bow was perfectly made and everything.  I don't know if you know a lot about violins, but it's not all about the strings themselves.  A lot of it has to do with the bow, how light it is, and how the hairs touch the strings.  And mine was definitely the best.

""One day, I left my violin on my chair to go to the... ladies' room.  After class, my friend Toby told me that Dani switched bows with me.  Of course, he didn't have to tell me.  That bow didn't feel perfect at all.  It's no wonder she switched bows with that trash she was using...

""I talked to Dani about it the next day, but she didn't say anything.  So we stopped talking.""

""How much did the bow cost?"" asked James.

Kelly seemed reluctant to admit that it was probably worth as much as a used car, and a good-conditioned used car at that.

---

Kelly had left the booth already and James asked me to check the progress on the poison analysis.

""Especially that one ingredient,"" he hinted.

I knew which one he was talking about, but when I checked over the analysis, I found it strange that it didn't have substantially more poison than the other ingredients...

""Pepperoni was about the same as the mushroom and olives.  Cheese was about the same, too,"" I reported.

""And the green peppers?"" James asked excitedly.

I frowned.  ""Just the same as the other ingredients...""

""Damn.""

James shut his eyes and started humming to himself.  It was an odd habit he had when he was thinking about something complicated, like his English essays.

""It looks like it could only have been done by two people,"" James said.

I nodded in agreement.

""But that would be dangerous..."" James muttered.

---

Five minutes of humming continued until James stopped and opened his eyes.

""It would be dangerous..."" he repeated to himself.

""Hey, I want you to check everyone else's drinks for any kind of... peculiarity..."" James trailed off.

I was about to leave when he yelled, ""By the way, bring Louis over here...""

---

I had the CSI team analyze the drinks just as James asked, though we found nothing.  Maybe because we had no idea what we were looking for.  James tended to do that.  He would ask people to do something without telling them why he wanted the people to do what he asked them to do.  It was annoying, especially when you were the one taking orders from him.

I arrived back at the table to tell him what we found (or didn't find, in this case).  James was still questioning Louis, who looked fairly angry by that time.

""She was always screwing with my science experiments and with everything else!"" Louis said loudly.  ""She would always do stupid things like throw my backpack in the trash or stick a cockroach in it or something!  It was so disgusting!!""

James looked as if he was about to laugh.

""And that's why you hated her?""

""Well, yes!  Wouldn't you hate a girl so annoying as that?!""

Of course, Louis was the ""prim and proper"" kind of person.  Everything was always neat and organized with him, and if it wasn't, he'd nearly die.  But I hardly believed someone would kill over that.

Louis stood up before James could finish his questioning.  James didn't pursue him any further.  I approached the table and sat opposite of James.

""Well, I think he has a form of OCD, though I'm no psychologist myself,"" remarked James.  ""He seems mentally ill, though I doubt that would drive him to kill Danielle...  By the way, do you happen to have the results from the tests I asked you to run?""

""Well,"" I started, ""I didn't find anything... unusual... though I had no idea what you wanted me to find...""

James looked disappointed.

""You would have known if it was there,"" he responded.  ""So the drinks were all normal?""

I nodded.

""Well, that eliminates our other two suspects, and now we're at... how many?"" James asked sarcastically.

""Going off of what you said earlier - that it could only have been two people - we have... no possible suspects.""

""Perfect,"" said James.  ""I wanted to eliminate just one, and now I eliminated the two of them...

""You sat next to Danielle, right?"" James asked.  I nodded.  He had sat across from Danielle.  Between the two of us, there was no way anyone could slip poison at the table without our knowing...""

He was waiting for me to suggest that someone had hovered their hand over Danielle's food.  I shook my head.

""You sure you didn't poison her?"" James asked, jokingly.  I shook my fist at him.

Of course, looking at the evidence, that was the only possibility.  Unless it was just a random act...</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut>""Wait a sec.  You're seriously questioning me?""

Coach Darrell had the usual smile on his face, though right now it seemed to be saying, ""You guys must be out of your minds.""  James and I sat on the receiving end of that smile.  I didn't know what to say, but fortunately James was the one in charge of all of this questioning.

""Coach, I'm just looking for the whole truth.""

James looked very formal, almost like a businessman ready to engage in a hostile takeover.  Coach Darrell talked down to him like he was a little boy trying to sell lemonade or something.

""Go ahead and ask me, then,"" Coach said.

""Did you happen to have any problems with Danielle?  Any fights or arguments or something?""

Coach Darrell laughed again.  It sounded phonier by the second, and James stared straight at him.  He was seeing something I wasn't, I think.

""Well, you know kids and teachers... there's going to be some arguments sometimes.""

Coach ran a dark-skinned hand over his bald head and James nodded.  I noted that Coach kept his other hand down by his side...

""Well, did she ever get you in trouble for something at school?""

Coach looked to the table and James's eyes definitely caught it.

""No, she did not,"" he replied.

""So you never had any real problems with Danielle, correct?""

""I did not.""  Coach straightened himself in his seat and looked ready to get back to the forensics.  Quite frankly, I wanted to get back over there as well, but James really wanted me around.

Coach stood up.  James shoved me out of the way and held out his hand to shake.

Coach gave him an odd smile and held out his right hand to catch James's... left.

""You're doing it backwards,"" James remarked.  ""I'm holding out my left hand.  Won't you meet it with yours?""

Coach hesitated for a moment, then held out his other hand.  A large bandage was wrapped around it, rendering his left hand almost immobile.  They shook hands and before Coach Darrell could leave, James asked, ""Where'd you get it from?""

""Cooking,"" Coach grunted.  ""I gotta get back to work.""

---

""Hello, Shandra,"" James said warmly.

Shandra nodded and inspected the booth opposite us before sitting down.

""How well did you know Danielle?"" James asked.

""Well, we ate lunch together every day.  I didn't know her very well, though, because we had a large group of people eating together with us at lunch...""

""Did you ever get into a fight with Danielle?""

Obviously not, and I could have answered that.  Shandra was just far too quiet and avoided confrontation.

""No...  I mean, the closest thing we got to fighting was...""

James waited.  Shandra was reshaping her mouth into different vowels, apparently hoping to find the right word.

""Well, she did make fun of me a few times, but it wasn't really...  It wasn't really mean or anything.""

James had a reassuring smile on his face.

""Do you know why anyone else would want to kill her?"" asked James.

Shandra shook her head.  James nodded and told her that she could return.  James's eyes followed her closely as she turned her back and walked away...

""Chris?""

""Yeah?""

James was staring at the forensics booth and apparently wanted more information from there.

""I'm gonna take a bathroom break.""

Apparently not.

""But what I want you to do is find out more about that poison that killed Danielle.""

James left and I walked over to the forensics table...

---

Five minutes passed before I returned.  James (thank God) was already out of the bathroom before then.

""What's up?"" he asked.

""It seems like there was a heck of a lot of poison there.  We tested a lot of things so far - the crust, the mushrooms, olives, sauce...  We haven't tested the green peppers, pepperoni, or cheese yet, but from what we've found so far, there's poison on every one of these.  Also, it seems less apparent in the crust and sauce, but it's definitely there...""

""Seems like someone wanted to make sure she was really going to die...  What'd you say the ingredients of the pizza were?""

""Crust, mushrooms, olives, sauce, green peppers, pepperoni, cheese.""

James wrote down what everyone else had ordered and came up with the following (unorganized) list:

---

Me: Crust, Pepperoni, Cheese, Sauce
Chris: Crust, Cheese, Sauce
Elias: Crust, Cheese, Sauce, Pepperoni, Anchovies
Shandra: Crust, Cheese, Sauce, Pepperoni, Sausage
Kelly: Crust, Cheese, Sauce, Mushroom, Olives
Lewis (that was misspelled on the paper, by the way): Crust, Cheese, Sauce, Pepperoni, Olives
Darrell: Crust, Cheese, Sauce
Danielle (Victim): Crust*1, Mushrooms*2, Olives*2, Sauce*1, Green Peppers, Pepperoni, Cheese

---

""What are the asterisks for?"" I asked, stumbling on the word ""asterisk"".

""That's what you've already tested.  On a scale of most poisonous to least, two being the most poisonous, I've marked the ingredients...""

I looked over the list and was about to sit back down again when James asked me, ""By the way, you mind bringing Kelly here?""</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut>""Don't touch that...""

Everyone was surrounding the body and was about to alter the crime scene until James spoke up.

""I thought that would be obvious.  The first thing you do is not touch the crime scene.""

He looked at me, and I understood to call the police.

---

It was a few minutes of talking on my cell phone until I got back to James.  He was busy making sure no one would touch the crime scene.

""I just called the police, James.  They told me that they wouldn't be able to have anyone come down until about an hour or two.  The police are really busy tonight with other crimes...""

It was a very lame excuse, but it was the one they gave me in the first place.  James was, of course, irritated by this... or so I expected.

He cracked his knuckles and a smile grew on his face.

""Guess this one's up to us, huh, Chris?""

---

We set up an interrogation booth and a lab processing booth in the restaurant.  We happened to have been sitting in a corner of the restaurant for our banquet when Danielle died, so it was fairly easy to keep track of the crime scene.  The lab processing booth was in another corner of the restaurant.  James and I sat in the interrogation booth, which was located in the third corner of the restaurant.  We were able to keep an eye on the other corners from where we were sitting.

""The main suspects are the server, Joan Keller; and the cook Fabian Gullian.  Of course, Elias, Shandra, Kelly, Louis, and Coach Darrell are suspects..."" James trailed off.

""If that were so, you and I would be suspects too, right?""

James gave me a strange look.

---

""You are Joan Keller, correct?""

Joan was about the same age as the rest of us.  She had her hair tied up in a bun and no necklaces or other loose chains.  It was the typical waitress look.

""Yes.""

""Tell me everything you know about Danielle Glover.""

""The dead girl, right?""

It wasn't exactly eloquent, the way she put it, but James didn't seem to notice.

""Well, I don't know her very well,"" Joan started.  ""I mean, I only know her because she used to work here.  She worked here last year, that is...""

""How long did she work here?"" asked James.

""Well... about a half a year.  I was working here before she got a job.""

""I think a half a year is a long enough time to know someone, Joan.""

""Well, yes.""

James watched her eyes closely.  Her eyes watched the table closely.  I looked toward the forensics table and felt that I belonged over there instead.  I didn't exactly care too much for interrogation...

""Are you hiding something, Joan?""

James's face was still rather warm.  Not like that of a cross-examiner or an interrogator, rather like a friend waiting for juicy gossip.  Joan bought in.

""Actually..."" her face still looked down at the table.  James wasn't pressing even after the rather long silence.

""Actually, I know that she used to flirt with some of the guys here...  I mean, she'd come on to them, and when they finally started coming on to her too...""

She looked up and smiled as if she had been relieved of a much bigger secret than that.

""And that's all I basically know about her!""

""Do you know why anyone would want to kill Danielle?"" James asked.

Joan shook her head.  I thought James would have asked her more questions, but instead he gave her a warm smile and told her that she could ask the cook to come.

---

I looked over to the forensics booth as James started questioning Fabian Gullian.  He was the eldest one here, and it seemed odd that a teenager should question someone as old as he.

""Kid, are you seriously going to question me?""  He looked irritated.

James took the same demeanor as before, though.

""Do you know why anyone would want to kill Danielle?""

""Dude, I don't see much of Danielle, ok?  I just hang out in the kitchen and make the food.""

The man was fat and his stains on his apron looked more like blood and sweat instead of the pizza sauce that it really was.

""But that wasn't my question.""

James's face changed.  He leaned forward in the seat.  It was as if he was manipulating the shadows so only his eyes could clearly be seen in the poor lighting that was the pizza parlor.

""Do you know why anyone would want to kill Danielle?""

Fabian leaned closer to James as well and spoke in a very low voice.

""I know that she sometimes took food and money that wasn't hers, but I really don't know what you're talking about.""

James managed a smirk.

""Your pizza sucks, by the way.""

Fabian the cook's face grew uglier and he spit on the table right in front of James.

""Don't be insulting my pizza.""

He stood up and walked off.  James looked satisfied.  I was bored.

""Hey, Chris.""

I looked over and he motioned toward the forensics booth.

""Why don't you send Elias over here?  Also, I want you to tell me what's going on at that forensics booth.""

I was happy to be relieved of listening to interrogations and actually doing something.

---

I returned to the interrogation booth in the middle of James's questioning of Elias.

""She was having a fight with Shandra?""

James's eyes were lit up as Elias spoke.

""Yeah, yeah!  It was really scary, now that I think of it, but it was still exciting at the time!  I don't remember what they were arguing about, but I remember that they were in a hallway, and they were yelling about something... I think they were arguing over something stupid like arguing over a boy.  That's what girls tend to do anyways, argue over boys.  I mean...""

Elias was about a million miles per hour when he spoke.

""Did anyone else have problems with Danielle?""

""Well, I remember Coach Darrell talking really serious to her and stuff.  I mean, it was after we had a meeting one day, and I decided to stick around and test more stuff with luminol.  I heard Coach and Danielle yelling at each other, and I got kinda scared there, too, so I left the room, and I went back in when Danielle left.  I didn't see Coach around, so I asked where he was, but he told me he would be all right and that he was closing up his classroom soon.  I decided to spray a bit more luminol, and when I sprayed luminol on his table, I noticed... guess what... guess what I noticed!""

""Blood?"" James asked, apparently excited.

""Yeah!  I found blood on his desk!  I don't know whose blood it was, but I know that it was right where Danielle and Coach were talking.  I also noticed that the next day, Coach had his arm in a big bandage.  It was really weird because Coach wasn't walking around with a bandage the day before, but he was walking around with it then!  You know what that means?!  It means that Danielle cut his arm!""

It made the most sense, actually.  I made a mental note to check Danielle's belongings for a knife or something of the like.

James dismissed Elias and turned to me.

""What'd you find?"" he asked.

""So far, they've analyzed the drink and the food.  The poison was definitely in the food.""

James looked a little disturbed by this.

""That's odd...  It would usually be easier to put the poison in the drink...""

James didn't think too hard on this and asked me to bring the next person - Coach Darrell.</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut>The CSI team at our school wasn't exactly a hot topic.  More people were interested in committing crimes rather than solving them.  Luckily, we had a team of seven which allowed us to compete in state.

Unfortunately, we didn't fare well at state.  We were definitely a good team, but we just weren't good enough to analyze the evidence properly, even if James knew what happened all along.

But it was still a fun group.

---

The banquet was to be held at a pizza parlor that was probably named after an Italian.  Revolia's Pizza or something like that.  Two pizzas for seven teenagers and a grown man.  It was going to be gone before I could get a second slice, and judging by how late I was running, it might be gone before I could get my first.

""Hey, Chris!""

Coach Darrell waved to me.  He was a large dark-skinned man who could very well pass for law enforcement.

I waved back and looked around the table.

James Hamish was a rather boring looking guy, actually.  Plain brown hair and brown eyes.  No glasses.  No magnifying glass.  No luminol.  If you passed by him on the street, you wouldn't look back at him and suspect him of being anything special at all.  In fact, his school records reflected just as much; he flunked English sophomore year and had to make it up over the summer.

Elias Nash looked far more exciting.  He was a freshman, and was therefore very immature about anything and everything he did.  His blonde hair matched his annoyingly loud personality, though I suppose he was intelligent at times.

Shandra Blunt was a senior.  She was unusually quiet, but a nice girl once you got to know her.  Her hair was dyed purple.  Probably because she didn't want people to know she was a natural red-head, though I don't understand why she went with purple...

Kelly Stockton had glasses and a pair of shades to go over them.  The shades weren't sunglass shades, however.  They were for the luminol she always carried around with her.  Remember when I talked about those strange forensic fanatics?  She was one of them.

Louis Escher was another fanatic concerning forensics, though not as much so.  He did carry around a magnifying glass and forceps, but he didn't run around with weird forensics books that Kelly did.  Louis was uncannily clean and orderly about everything.  In fact, I might go so far as to say he had OCD, though it did come in handy when analyzing crime scenes.

....There was one person missing, though...

""Glad you could make it, Chris!!""

Elias Nash was very annoying in his high-pitched tenor voice, especially when he was being sarcastic.

""I'm glad you came at all,"" I fired back.

I took my seat next to Shandra, across from James.

""So what?  Did everyone eat the pizza already and forget to save me a slice?"" I asked aloud to no one in particular.

""The pizza hasn't arrived yet.""  Shandra looked tired, as usual.

I looked across the table and noticed James looking at another table.  Apparently, someone hadn't cleaned up the table yet, and James looked absolutely fascinated in it.

""What're you looking at, James?"" I asked.

James didn't look back at me, but said to the other table, ""Tell me how much you know about the couple who sat at that table.""

I saw two cups, one with a lid, and one without.  I saw a salt-shaker, two plates, and quite a few unused napkins on top of each.  There were a knife and fork on one plate, and there was ranch by both plates, the one next to the cup with the lid was finished, and the one next to the cup without the lid was untouched.  Also, there was a receipt on the table.

I shrugged.  ""There were two people.  They were really neat.  ...I don't see much else...""

""I'll tell you,"" said James.  ""Two people, of course.  No lipstick, so that implies either the people who ate here were both men, or they were both poor.  I don't think they were poor, because I noticed that there was one receipt on the table, and that receipt was for four dollars.  There was no other receipt.  Thus, one person paid for himself, while the other paid for himself as well.  I know the one person paid with credit card because that's the only way to get your receipt here, so the people must not have been poor, and they weren't a couple, or one person would pay for the two of them.  The credit card implies that the two were okay with money, so lipstick would be on the straws if they were women, but there was no lipstick.  Thus, two men, one paying with a credit card.

""I also don't think they're related not only because of the receipt, but also because of the lids.  Notice how only one cup has a lid.  Most people, when living together or related to each other, tend to develop habits similar to one another so they don't realize it.  Thus, no relation.  Probably two men talking over some kind of business.

""The two must have been right-handed because of the position of the cups.  From where each person was sitting, they would have to reach with their right hand to get their cups.  I do know that at least one person was right-handed, however, because the knife and fork are positioned so they are sticking out of the right side of the plate, a place where a right-handed person would usually leave their utensils.

""I finally know that the person who ate the ranch was not only the person who brought the salt, but was also the person who brought both ranch packets.  The two know each other well enough to know that the other likes ranch, but the one person decided not to eat ranch today.  Additionally, the person who ate ranch was the one who got all the supplies, because that person was the only one who ate salt.  I can tell because the salt is closer to that person, and there were no traces of salt detectable on the other plate.

""What do you think about that?""

Shandra looked hardly interested, but I was impressed.

""By the way, where's Danielle?""

""Right here.""

While I was listening to James's deduction, Danielle must have slipped into the seat next to me.

Danielle Glover was a senior as well, and wasn't exactly nice, even though she was very smart when it came to processing evidence.  She did have the tendency to rub people the wrong way, if you know what I mean...

The smell of pizza seemed to awaken Shandra.  I was looking for a pie to come to the table, but found it strange that we all ended up with individual slices.  Two each.  I wasn't complaining, but Elias was apparently very hungry as usual and tried to steal Kelly's pizza.  The two were usually roudy, and I had learned to ignore them a long while ago.

""Could you pass me the salt?""

It was an odd habit that Danielle had.  She commonly ate her pizza with salt while other people would put more... normal things like crushed red peppers and the like.  I didn't care, personally.

""Could you pass me the salt when Danielle's done,"" Shandra asked.

Definitely odd.

---

We had all finished the pizza and Pepsi, and Coach was giving out trophies to the most improved scientist and the most observant scientist and whatnot.  You would think we were some kind of basketball team talking about the best ""team player"" awards...

""And last, but not least...  The most valuable scientist award goes to...  Danielle Glover!""

We all clapped and looked over to her.  The clapping slowed and eventually ceased to a halt except for Elias and Kelly who were trying to out-clap each other.

There was Danielle, face down on the table.  I checked her pulse...

""So this is what a real crime scene is like...""

Louis had been a little quiet tonight, and I think those were the first words I heard him say.  Elias and Kelly stopped and we were all silent as the other six looked at me to see if there was a pulse.  I dropped my hand and shook my head.</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut>Drama.  I hate it.  I didn't assume there would be drama in a forensics club, and it seemed like a fun extra-curricular.  I joined it.  And up until I found out what was really going on in that club, I didn't regret the choice for a single minute.

Not that I was a fanatic about it.  Oh sure, you saw kids running around with luminol and scotch tape to ""lift fingerprints"" and whatnot.  I wasn't one of them.  James Hamish wasn't either, thankfully.

I wasn't exactly a slack-off, however.  I just happened to be fairly good at working the scenes, but wasn't a fanatic.  I suppose I was a bit of a natural, yet I didn't exactly care too much for the work.  I was more excited watching James tell us all what really happened after we all did the rest of the work.

Speaking of James, he wasn't exactly a hard worker when it came to working the cases.  In fact, I have no idea why he joined at all.  When we were discussing basic techniques, he was hardly around, and when he was, he wasn't paying attention.  He practically hated that club.  But when it came to the actual cases...

But I'm getting off topic.  This story isn't about me or James, it's about the rest of the CSI.  In fact, it's not really about them.  It's about... it's about drama.  It's about how powerful drama can be.  It's about how drama can drive people to do unthinkable things...

""What's the difference?""

Hector was riding shotgun and was staring at the dashboard.  Rick and I glanced over in confusion, which I thought was a bad idea for Rick, as he was driving.

""What's the difference between you and a criminal?"" Hector asked.

I sat and thought about it for a while and really didn't know...  I mean, we both thought the same way, and we both try to think ahead of each other...

""Idiot!""

Rick hit the steering wheel with his palm.

""The difference between Jim and criminals is that Jimmy here doesn't run around killing people!!""

We laughed, but lying in bed later that night... I thought that might really be the truth.  There was only one difference between criminals and me is that I don't kill people or steal from people or do illegal things.  We both fought for what was right.  The difference was how we fought for it...

"event","<lj-cut>""Hey, Detective Linger...""

We were at the entrance to the arena.  Five minutes before the evidence was processed.  It was now or never...

""Yeah?""

She was already angry from the phone call, so it was no surprise that she sounded like she would kill the first person to give her problems.  Luckily, that person would be me.

""Do you think you could... gather up the suspects and whatnot... and bring them to the crime scene...?""

She looked at me like I was an idiot.

""Why don't you round them up yourself?!""

Unfortunately, she wasn't as cooperative as that other case...

""Look, I helped you solve that case with the magician, didn't I?  At least you could give me the benefit of the doubt or something.""

She looked at her watch.  Four minutes.  She sighed and her entire demeanor changed.

""I guess I could get 'em there.  We gotta talk about the evidence that the forensics are processing anyway.""

Thirty seconds later, I heard the announcement over the intercom.  3:30 until she knew that my fingerprints were on the knife.  3:30 to prove whodunit.  Unfortunately, it would take another minute-and-half for the suspects to get there...

---

Two minutes.  It was an estimate, but I hoped they would get the evidence processed later rather than sooner, in any case.

There they all stood.  Jack Schilling.  Ben Locust.  Cliff Packer.  Rick Mouri.  Hector Carlyle.  Detective Linger.

""Dude, what the heck is this all about?!""

Jack Schilling used more colorful words, but I'd rather not write exactly what he said here.

""The guy in charge of this place testified that no one entered the arena through the main entrance.  Additionally, there is an emergency exit in this arena, but if someone were to use this door, the alarm would sound.  Therefore, the murderer is obviously one of us.""

No reactions.

""No duh, Sherlock.""  (Again, Jack's language is too colorful for this account.)

""Additionally, the murderer had to be someone who knew Keith Haley well enough.""

""Why is that?"" asked Detective Linger.

""Remember that there was no blood found on the victim's vest.  The victim's vest was obviously removed before he was stabbed.  There would only be two ways that this was done - by incapacitating the victim first, or by the victim removing it himself.

""Also, remember how stuffy it was in here.  It's hard enough already for normal people to breathe, but...""

I pulled out Keith's inhaler from his pocket.

""...for someone with asthma, it would be even more difficult.

""It makes sense, then, that the killer accompanied the victim until the victim had trouble breathing.  The victim decided to take a rest, and the killer, being the great friend he was, decided to help the victim rest.  The victim removed his vest and backed into the wall.  The killer then took out a knife and... killed him.

""Of course, the trick can only be done if the killer knows the victim has asthma, and...-""

I was cut off by an ominous ringtone.  I froze.  Detective Linger pulled out the phone and answered it.  She listened, nodded a few times, and stared coldly at me.  She hung up.

""You're just trying to cover up for yourself, aren't you?!"" she exclaimed.

""I'm not...  If you'll let me explain the rest of the case, you'll understand how my knife ended up in the victim...""

The three college guys smirked and my two friends looked straight at me.

""You.""  I pointed to Jack Schilling in the white.  ""You remember stealing my money, right?""

He looked at me and still smirked.

""Little did you notice, not only did you steal my money, but you also snatched my pocketknife!""

Suddenly, Jack Schilling's face looked very serious.

""I never killed Keith!""

""I never said you killed Keith,"" I replied.

""But I didn't!!"" Jack shouted.

""No...  You're right...  You didn't kill Keith.  Someone else did.  Someone you gave the money to.""

Jack gave a short chuckle.  ""You don't know who I gave the money to.  That, and I'm not talking.""

""That's fine,"" I said, ""because I already know that the murderer is...""

I pointed my accusing finger.

""You, Cliff Packer.""

The tattoo and red shirt looked impervious to my accusation, and he looked like he would kill me were there not so many officers around.

""You're an idiot,"" he told me.

""It makes sense, though.  You had to hide the vest somewhere, or someone would see Keith's body lying on the ground.  You couldn't hide it behind Keith, because his body would trip someone.  You couldn't just hide it anywhere in the arena, because people would see it and wonder where the vest's owner went.""

""I couldn't hide the vest because I didn't kill him!""  That aforementioned mucus began flying as he screamed.  ""Besides,"" he cooled down a bit, ""where could I have hidden it?""

""I noticed when you were chasing me, near the end of the game, there was a strange noise.  It was like plastic hitting plastic.  Almost as if you were running with... two vests on...?""

Detective Linger looked excited.  ""So that's why two of them were stacked... when the forensics team...!""

""That's right.  Cliff Packer was hiding the vest by wearing it with his own vest.  He had the two vests on because he killed Keith Haley!!""

""Idiot!"" he screamed.  ""I could have had something in my pocket making that noise!  Plus, I could have accidentally put my vest on top of someone else's!!  You have no proof showing that I was running with two vests on!!""

I smiled.

""Jack Schilling, how many times were you shot by Cliff?"" I asked.

""I don't remember!"" he said.

""Why don't you check your scorecard.  It's recorded there.""

He looked and saw that very thing that I saw... rather, he didn't see what should have been there.

""Ben Locust, how many times were you shot by Cliff?""

He pulled out his card and didn't see it either.

""Rick?""

Not there.

""Hector?""

Not there, either.  I pulled out my own card.  It wasn't there either.

""I'm sure I was shot by everyone here at least twice, except Hector.  Yet, when I look under your name, Cliff... it shows me...""

I turned my card around and showed him.

""It shows me that you didn't hit me at all.  In fact, it shows me that Keith hit me quite a lot, even though I could have sworn you hit me at least ten times...  Isn't that strange...?""

---

""I wasn't originally going to kill him...""

There was a few minutes of silence before Cliff confessed.

""That is, until I found that knife in my pocket.

""I was originally going to just bash his head in.  That bastard...""

""Why..."" I began.

""Because that sonuvabitch blackmailed me!  Why the hell do you think I needed to steal money today!?""

His eyes were swelling, and I thought it ironic that a man with a tattoo was about to cry.

""My younger sister lives at home, and every weekend he'd... check up on her!

""I caught him spying on my sister when I went home once, and he... he told me that if I told anyone about what he was doing, he'd... he'd kill my sister!

""I didn't believe him...  I hired a P.I. and asked her to watch Keith and make sure he wasn't going anywhere near my sister...  That P.I... what a goddamn joke.  He got found the first day on the job!

""I told Keith I had nothing to do with it, but the next day... I got a call from my sister...  She told me...  She told me that her right hand was broken!...

""She loved the violin, and to have her hand broken...  Even after that, he told me that I would have to pay him now!  He told me... each week I didn't pay him... he'd break off another finger...!

""I had nothing else to do.  I'd already hired a detective and talked to the police...  No one would take me seriously!  I did the only thing I could do...!""

And there it was.  A few tears.  I felt like snickering... it was strange sight... yet...!</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut>And there it was.  My pocket knife.  In Keith Haley's heart.  I froze and gazed at it.

""James... You didn't... kill him, did you?""

Hector was staring at the body as well.

""Idiot!  Of course not!""

""Well, your fingerprints will be found on the murder weapon, though, won't they?""

I reached in my pocket and pulled out a tissue.  It was almost automatic.  It was as if my body were moving on its own.  Inside, I was telling myself to... to wipe down the weapon... and I was telling myself not to tamper with evidence...  The tissue was draped over the weapon now.  A few swipes, and...

""What are you doing, James?""

Hector was there, witnessing the whole thing.  I wanted to tell him to go away... to turn the other cheek... and he would...  I know he would...

""Hector...""

He stared at my hand.

""James, if you didn't do it, then the evidence will show that.  It doesn't matter how many fingerprints of yours there are on that knife.""

I looked at my hand.  I looked at Keith's face.  His blue eyes seemed to turn to me... watching me...  Telling me not to do it...  My hand slowly lifted the tissue up, and I put it back in my pocket.

---

I walked out without saying a word to anyone.  I had to find out what really happened before the forensics team was able to analyze the weapon.

""What?!""

I was sitting on a bench outside the arena and overheard Detective Linger on the phone.

""Whaddya mean the fingerprint analysis won't be here for another ten minutes?!  Look, I got kids runnin' around the crime scene, and you want me to hold them off until you can finish processing all the evidence?!...""

Ten minutes.  Ten minutes to go over what I knew.  I needed to think fast:

""The knife was stabbed through the heart.  That obviously meant that the vest was removed before Keith was stabbed, but how was it removed?  And why was it removed beforehand?  Could it be he went in there without his vest?  Impossible.  The guy would have seen him.  And there was no blood on any of the vests, so no one carried him there, nor did they stab him with his vest still on...  It's strange, because it would make sense to kill him before removing his vest.  So why would he have consented...?

""Furthermore, how did my knife end up in that person?  Could it be that someone pickpocketed me again?  No, I was careful with my stuff... I doubt it...  But it's definitely possible.  Then again, why would someone steal my knife?  Also, how did they know I would have something like that?

""The only people who know that I carry a knife around with me are Chris, Rick, and Hector.  Chris wasn't hear, so that implied either Rick or Hector... but they are my friends!  Why would they do something like that?  Would they do something like that?!

""Wait a second...!  Rick was the last one out!  In fact, I had to go searching for him then!  Could it be...!?

""That's not right.  Rick doesn't even know the guy... at least I don't think he does...

""Hold it!  During the game...!  I thought there was something strange there...!  Maybe... if that's what it says on the scorecard...  After all, I was shot by everyone at least twice, and I'm sure of it...""

I pulled out my scorecard and looked under every name...

""It's not there...  That explains it!  That's how he removed the vest before killing him!  That's why the body was there!  That's where the vest was hidden...!""

I smiled.  The means, the motive, and the decisive evidence.  No doubt the murderer was him...!</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut>The police had arrived and the lights all were lit in that laser tag place.  It was odd to actually be able to see where I was going in there, though breathing was still another question.

The place was crawling with detectives and investigators and whatnot, so it was impossible for me to examine the scene right now.  Instead, I was in questioning along with the six other survivors.

I learned the names of the other four.  The dead guy was Keith Haley.  His white shirt and wide eyes reflected what little light there was when I first saw him.  His gold hair and blue eyes shone even brighter each time I was able to catch a glance of the body.

The one with the black beer shirt was Jack Schilling.  His jeans were torn, though I could tell the tears were fake - the tears were above the knee cap which made absolutely no sense.  The guy's hair was messier than my own, and he looked like one of those guys who didn't give a damn about anyone else.  I found him annoying.

There was the guy in blue.  His hair was all black.  In fact, it was so unnaturally black, it almost looked blue in good light.  He was wearing black eyeliner that was obviously uneven in thickness.  He looked like a person who was about to go running around holding a knife, only to dig it into his own arm.  The police called him Ben Locust.

Then there was the guy in red - Cliff Packer.  He, too, had dark hair, though I presumed it was naturally dark.  He looked more muscular than his companions, though not much more, and I noticed at tattoo on his left arm.  I didn't think highly of him either, especially when I saw mucus leave his mouth and hit the ground.  I looked under my own shoe and found similar mucus.  I felt a little sick after that...

""Kid!""

I wasn't used to being questioned, I was used to investigating the crime scene, not being questioned, though it looked like the entire case was going to revolve around interrogation.  There was no way the evidence would implicate anyone, nor would there be any eye-witnesses owing to how pitch-black it was, but I was still itching to go to the case... itching...!!

""James Hamish!!""

I jumped.  The cop was looking very irritated.

""Sorry, officer.""

""Well?  Describe the chain of events to me, if you please!""

---

Fifteen minutes of questioning for each of us, and we were free from questioning, though not so from being at the scene.  I asked the officer who was questioning me who was in charge of the scene.

""That would be Detective Linger.""

Detective Jean Linger had worked with me a month or so before on an apparent suicide.  She was very well built, probably even moreso than most cops on the job.  She was about 6 feet tall, and would easily be able to snap people's backs in half with her bare hands.  She was black, and her hair was short, probably because it was more convenient to have it short than have it flowing all over the place and getting in her way.  Unlike the other detectives, however, who liked to run around in trenchcoats and ties and hats and the typical attire, she wore a uniform herself.

She was reasonable, so at least revealing what happened wouldn't be too tough when I found out whodunit before she did.

I thanked the officer and left.

Since the body was still surrounded by officers and whatnot, I decided to go to the vest where I found some officers using luminol spray to look for blood on the vests.  An officer was questioning the guy working there, and asked him if anyone else could possibly have come in at the time.

""Nope.  I stand guard here so no one gets free games, and the emergency door's alarm would have gone off if someone used it.""

The murderer was one of those three, and judging from their intelligence, it wasn't going to be a tough case.

I watched as the officer working with the vests unstacked a pair of vests and continued checking for luminol.  Hector was watching with wide eyes and taking mental notes.  If he had pencil and paper, the paper would have been filled front-and-back faster than you could give it to him.

""They find anything, Hector?""

""Shh!!""

He watched intently as the officer picked up the last vest and found no luminol.  Nothing.  Hector and I looked at each other.

I walked outside to the arcade and on my way out was handed my scorecard.  I wasn't interested, so I stuffed it in my pocket.  I sat on a bench waiting for some officers to come out, indicating that the body was probably clear...

---

A half-hour passed until I saw a few police officers walk out and presumed it would be ok to investigate the body now.  I walked to the body and noticed Rick was already there, staring intently at something.  I waved to Rick and called out his name.  He looked confused when he saw me and ran off...

I studied the body myself.  Stabbed through the heart.  Scrunched against the wall.  Unnatural position.  Probably so people wouldn't trip over him.  I felt in his pocket.  Inhaler still there.  The bright blue eyes were directed toward the sky and the mouth was agape as if it would start screaming.

I heard footsteps and turned around to see Hector staring at the body himself.  He took off his glasses and wiped them as if he was having trouble seeing.  He knelt down, too.

""What do you deduce, James?"" he asked.

I looked at the body and made gestures as I spoke.  ""Obviously stabbed through the heart.  He was smashed against the wall so he wouldn't be discovered.  I think I know what happened to him, but something's still bothering me...""

""Is it the same thing that's bothering me, James?""

I turned to look at Hector.  He was staring straight at me.  It was a strangely cold stare.  It was as if he was telling me there was something very wrong with the body.  Very wrong.  It was as if he was accusing me...

I looked back at the body and saw exactly what it was that bothered me.  I shuddered and felt weak.  I felt my pockets and overturned them, revealing a few bucks in cash and my penlight.  But it wasn't there.  It wasn't in my pocket.  It wasn't in my pocket because I was staring right at it.

There it was.  In the victim's chest.  My pocket-knife.</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut>""Sucker!""<br /><br />My assailant fled like the coward he was.  I would give chase, but I was already incapacitated.  My gun shut off.  I was left alone in the dark.<br /><br />""Damn you, Rick!""<br /><br />""Don't worry about it, James!  It's just a game of laser tag!""<br /><br />Hector Carlyle was standing behind me.  His figure wasn't very imposing and neither were his glasses.  His clothes draped over him and gave him the appearance of well-fed kid, but he was anything but.  He was sweating slight beads that coated his acne and his head darted around, looking for enemies.<br /><br />""Hah!  Me take it easy?  Look at you moving your head all over the place!  And there's no one around!""<br /><br />""What do you mean there's no one around?""<br /><br />""Well, you can't hear anyone around but us two, can you?""<br /><br />""I can't hear anything around here with that music blaring!""<br /><br />It really was like I imagined a rave might be.  The sweat, the poor lighting, the loud music, the sweat, the lack of drinks...  The only thing different was we were high school kids running around shooting other high school kids with toy guns.<br /><br />My gun and vest lit back up, and I was ready to kill.  And my first target...<br /><br />""What the...?!  James, I thought you said there wasn't anyone around!  James?  James?!""<br /><br />At least I got one kill this game...<br /><br />---<br /><br />Each game lasted fifteen minutes - plenty of time to lose all body fluids.  Everyone came out drenched, and you were so wet all over, you could very well have wet your pants without knowing it.<br /><br />""Thanks for abandoning me, James.""<br /><br />Hector walked out sweaty and breathing hard.  In the light you could see his Mexican heritage and short dark hair and eyes.  He took off his glasses and wiped them on his shirt only to find that his shirt probably made it worse for his glasses.<br /><br />""I'm going to wipe these off in the bathroom.""<br /><br />""Hey, Hector!  Where you goin'?!""<br /><br />Hector tried to give his most intimidating face and walked off.<br /><br />""Traitor.""<br /><br />I smirked and punched him in the arm.<br /><br />""Damn.  And you would think someone like you would actually pack a punch.""<br /><br />Rick Mouri was a football player, so of course he'd break your arm as soon as he'd touch it.  He looked like he should have been in college, partially owing to his mustache and beard which were steady works-in-progress.  If Hector looked like the brains of the three of us, Rick was the brawns, and I was the misfit.<br /><br />""You up for a few more games?"" Rick asked, effectively paralyzing my other arm with his fist.<br /><br />""A couple more.  I gotta get back home, soon,"" I responded.<br /><br />""Right, you gotta get to your girlfriend, Chris.""<br /><br />Chris Perry was hospitalized for her cigarette burn which she got during one of my investigations.  From what I heard latest, she wasn't yet released, so I figured I'd give her my regards.  Interestingly, Chris figured out that case about the same time I did, the only difference being she confronted the criminal, who burned her with a lit cigarette.  They said the scar would heal...<br /><br />I looked at the line of people already in line for the next game and looked to the restrooms.<br /><br />""Hector better get back soon or the next game will start..."" I thought to myself.<br /><br />I looked back at the line when some guy bumped into me from behind, nearly knocking me over.<br /><br />""Watch it!!""<br /><br />The words came out of Rick's mouth as he shook his fist at the guy.  He must have been about twenty, and he looked like he was going to play his first game of the day.  He wore a black shirt advertising some kind of beer.  He met up with some other guys in line and they bought keys for the next game.  See, each of the lasers were activated by a kind of activation key which somehow held magnetic information or whatnot about something.  Point was - each person playing needed a key so they could play and get their stats afterward.<br /><br />The next game was about to start, and those other guys made their way to the door which led to that stuffy place I was just in.<br /><br />Hector came out of the restroom just as they were starting the next game.  The three of us rushed to get the activation keys in time, but it was already too late, and the next game had already started.  Not only that, but...<br /><br />""Damn, I thought I brought more money than this...""<br /><br />I was ten bucks short now.  Of course, I knew who it must have been, but I wasn't about to waste my breath pursuing ten bucks I wouldn't get back.<br /><br />""Looks like I only got enough for one more game, guys.""<br /><br />Rick looked disappointed, but Hector didn't seem to mind.  We got our keys...<br /><br />---<br /><br />We were inside the ""de-briefing room"", which looked a lot like the laser tag ""arena"", except it wasn't quite as sweaty, and it definitely wasn't as big.  The rules were being explained, and only Hector listened, and listened avidly at that.  I looked around and noticed the four guys who had taken my money earlier.  The one who was wearing a white shirt pulled out an inhaler and puffed.  Apparently, one of them had asthma...<br /><br />I looked at my opponents.  It looked as if it was just going to be the seven of us - me, Hector, Rick, Black Beer Shirt, Puffer, and two other guys.  I made quick mental notes of shirt colors... red, blue...<br /><br />""James!""<br /><br />It was Hector.<br /><br />""Aren't you listening?  They said that we're not supposed to run in there...!""<br /><br />I rolled my eyes.  Seriously, Hector?  Seriously?<br /><br />---<br /><br />After another five minutes of ""explaining rules"" and we were in that dark and sweaty cage once again...  I teamed up with Hector.  Rick, of course, went on his own way.  Together, Hector and I made the absolutely worst alliance.  We must have ben shot by everyone there at least twice.<br /><br />We were split up, but I knew from the ominous clanking noise behind me that I was the one being chased.  I rounded the corner and held my gun ready.  Red rounded the corner and I pulled my trigger.<br /><br />Nothing.  I pulled again.  Red started walking away.<br /><br />""What the...?""<br /><br />""The game ended already, James!""<br /><br />Hector was running up to me and showing his watch.  I looked at my gun.  ""GAME OVER.""<br /><br />We rushed back to the entrance, and I took off my vest.  I was exhausted and glad it was my last game.<br /><br />""Where's Rick?"" Hector asked.<br /><br />I looked back at the ""arena"".<br /><br />""I'll get him...""<br /><br />---<br /><br />After calling out for a bit, I found Rick.  Evidently, he thought we were still playing, so I explained that he needed to come back.  He ran ahead of me, and as I was on my way back...<br /><br />I hit the floor.  There was something on the ground...  I turned around and pulled out my penlight...<br /><br />And there was, knelt on the floor, back against the wall, scrunched up in a corner, and with a knife through his heart.  There was Puffer, white shirt stained red.  I checked his vitals.  Nothing.</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut>It was the cold feeling of being followed that I hadn't felt since that kidnapping case on the train where I was greeted with a loaded weapon.  This time, I had one myself, but how can you defend yourself from someone you can't see?

Pitch black except the few lights so I could navigate my way.  I could feel him...  I could feel him... chasing me...

I rushed around a corner and up a ramp, running as silently as I could.  No time to look down and around.  My thoughts ran faster than my legs, but my heart was racing even faster.  If only my lungs were working as fast.  It was getting hard to breathe.  Too hard...

I rushed down another ramp, rounded another corner, and looked behind me, catching my breath.

""Damn.  Where is he...?!""

Eyes strained, but saw nothing.  I rested a few more seconds and turned around to find a gun pressed against my chest.  I looked up.  A smirk with slightly crooked teeth.  A short laugh.  I felt like the gun pressed even deeper.  My insides churned...

I watched as the finger rested on the trigger, ready to fire.  My gun was at my side, and it would have been too slow... if only...!

""Goodbye, Detective James Hamish.""

The trigger.  Darkness.  I staggered back.</lj-cut>"

We were driving back home.  It was a long drive, and we hadn't spoken a word in hours.

""Yeah?""

""Do you really think family always comes before anything else?""

He looked at me warmly.

""Of course!  Why do you think you're living with me, James?""

I didn't exactly know, honestly.

""I'll tell you why.  Because your father was in a lot of trouble and didn't think he could give you a good life.  When your father asked me to take care of you, even though I was swamped as a full-time PI, I decided to cut my job and work part-time.  I didn't care about being rich or famous.  I cared that I should give my brother's son a good place to live.""

""Do you think that any human being's life is more important than property, too?"" I asked.

""No.""  He looked at the road ahead with a warm smile, still.  ""I think that any life is more important than property.  That's why Bullet's living with us.""

""Heh.  I get that,"" I replied, ""but why didn't you lock him in the kitchen before you left?""

My dad's smile faded as my words slowly set in.

""Wh... WHAT?!""

"event","<lj-cut>""So how long did Mr. Galactica practice magic?""

I was talking with Ms. Clay by the staircase.

""Years.  Maybe fifteen years.  I've worked with him for fourteen years as his faithful assistant.""

""How long has Mr. Galactica done the guillotine act?""

""Well, about a few weeks now.  I don't know how it works, but I do know that the blade is real, as I cut myself on it once.  I also know that it was specially designed by Bill Chinkerhoff, which is obvious because of the rope that drops the blade down and the unique design, but besides that, I don't know.""

There was no mistaking it now...  The murderer, the method, the decisive evidence...  It was all in my hands.  The only problem was getting the others to listen...

---

""Dad?""

""Yeah?""

I was talking to my uncle inside Mr. Galactica's room.

""Could you call Mr. Merryl, Ms. Clay, Mr. Chinkerhoff, and Detective Linger to this room?"" I asked.

""Why?""

""Well, I have a few questions to ask them and a few things I want clarified...""

""I guess I could.""

My uncle walked off to get the others, apparently clueless.

---

Me, my uncle, Mr. Merryl, Ms. Clay, Mr. Chinkerhoff, and Detective Linger were standing around the doorway of Mr. Galactica's room.  I stood off to one side and they to another so I was able to keep an eye on all of them at once.

""It's strange that Mr. Galactica would commit suicide, isn't it?  Especially with such a great career and life,"" I commented.

""Well, not everyone who's popular necessarily has a happy life.  I've seen other celebrities and such commit suicide as well..."" responded Detective Linger.

""It's not just that that was bothering me, though...  Don't you remember that the hands were found cut off as well as the head?  If I were committing suicide, I wouldn't care where my hands were,"" I explained.

""That is true... but if it's not a suicide, what are you suggesting?"" asked Detective Linger.

""There can be only two possibilities, then.  Either this was an accident, or this was a murder...""

I watched the reactions of the three suspects.  Each looked at one another, suspecting anyone but themselves.

""It could have been Jean Clay,"" said Mr. Merryl.  ""She's been working with Leon Galactica for a long time, but she's always been seen in his eyes as an underling.  They were always having arguments and he always said she couldn't make it on her own or start her own show.""

""In that case,"" said Mr. Chinkerhoff, ""you have enough motive yourself, Merryl.  You haven't had a pay raise in five years, and every time you ask for a bonus or raise, he never gives it to you.  Hell, he throws you out the door himself.""  Considering Mr. Merryl's size, I might take that literally.

""Will, you're not exactly without a motive yourself,"" said Ms. Clay.  ""You get all of what, one week's vacation.  And by vacation, that also means sick days.  You got tricked into that contract where if you took more time for vacation, you would be without a month's pay.  You couldn't take him to court if you tried.""

""Enough.""

I needed to get back on track.

""You all have some kind of motive, but there is only one way this could have happened.

""Mr. Chinkerhoff, your story is quite simple.  You were downstairs preparing the meal the entire time, so you couldn't have murdered Mr. Galactica then.  Also, if you did, Ms. Clay would have noticed when she went up and delivered the food.""  I motioned toward the food on the end table.

""Mr. Chinkerhoff, you also didn't go anywhere during dinner, so you couldn't have possibly killed Mr. Galactica.

""Ms. Clay.  When you first went upstairs to deliver Mr. Galactica his food, I assume he was still alive, or you would have gotten our attention.  Also, the food was inside, so I think you did deliver him the food.

""But isn't it strange that the water was the only thing Mr. Galactica had?  Maybe he didn't eat the rest of his food because he couldn't.  Maybe he couldn't because the poison had already worked its effects, at which point you could have staged the whole thing as an accident.""

""That's it!"" my uncle remarked.  ""No wonder you were gone for fifteen minutes!  You were busy waiting for the poison to work, so you could kill Mr. Galactica!!""

""That's not true!""  Ms. Clay looked angrily at my uncle and me.  ""That's not-""

""Of course,"" I interrupted, ""the room was locked, and you couldn't have gone out by using the ladder, because you were wearing heels, and the only footprints outside were footprints of someone wearing small shoes.

""Speaking of which, Mr. Merryl, you could have set this up as a locked room case yourself.  You could have had the ladder ready, entered through the door to Mr. Galactica's room, strangled him with the rope on the ground, killed him with the guillotine, and left using the ladder, all while locking the door behind you.  The second story window doesn't lock, does it?""

""So the murderer must be Mr. Merryl!"" my uncle shouted.  ""You saw a dead body because you created it yourself, didn't you!?""

""You're accusing your old friend of murderering another friend?!"" Mr. Merryl screeched.

""Look, Mr. Merryl couldn't have killed Mr. Galactica either.  There were only two sets of footprints found.  One was going to put the ladder there, and one was coming back from the ladder.  If Mr. Merryl killed Mr. Galactica, locked the room, and left through the window, there would be three footprints - one from planting the ladder, one from coming back into the house, and one from coming back after committing the murder.""

""So... it was an accident?"" my uncle asked.

""Not quite.  It couldn't really be that,"" I continued, ""because Mr. Galactica had only been practicing the trick for a few weeks.  He would never try something so dangerous if the trick behind it wasn't so easy.  He wouldn't try it with a sharp blade, at least, and Mr. Galactica always tried the trick with a sharp blade, right Ms. Clay?""

She nodded.

""So what happened?!"" my uncle asked impatiently.

""It was both - an accident and a murder.""

Everyone looked confused.

""Look, the real guillotine trick must have been easy to perform, but something went wrong which caused Mr. Galactica to die.  But that something going wrong was planned.""

I called everyone over to where the guillotine was and pointed to the two square-like indentations in the carpet.

""These indentations mean that the guillotine wasn't in the same place as it was before.  Why was the guillotine moved?  To replace it with this guillotine...!!""

And there was the reaction I suspected from that person...  That person knew I had seen right through them.

""There are actually two guillotines - one guillotine was the real one Mr. Galactica used for his magic trick.  The other is this fake one that actually killed Mr. Galactica!""

""So the murderer must be..."" Detective Linger looked at him.  ""You!  William Chinkerhoff!""

He looked shocked at first, but tried to explain it away.

""You're kidding!  You're saying I made two look-alike guillotines so I could kill Mr. Galactica?"" asked Mr. Chinkerhoff.

""That's exactly what I'm saying,"" I replied.

""Tell me,"" I continued, ""how does the guillotine work?""

""When the cord is pulled, the bottom part of the guillotine falls so Mr. Galactica falls through before the blade can slice him, but..."" said Mr. Chinkerhoff.

""But it just happened not to work?"" I asked.

""If you're going to accuse me, you're going to have to tell me why it couldn't possibly have been any of these other people!""  He grabbed me by my collar.  ""Do you have any proof?!  Do you?!""

I pointed and smiled.

""The guillotine?!""

""That's it,"" I told him.  ""Ms. Clay told me that you made the guillotine special for Mr. Galactica.  It was special because of how the guillotine was activated.  By that cord within reach of Mr. Galactica.  The fact that the guillotine is so unique and that Mr. Galactica was fooled to believe it was the same guillotine could only mean that you crafted the guillotine yourself.

""You were planning on killing Mr. Galactica for a while because he wouldn't give you any time away from work.  You just had to wait until your great project was complete.  There is but one problem in your method, and that is just how unique your guillotine is, Mr. Chinkerhoff.""

I felt the grip loosen from my collar.  Mr. Chinkerhoff backed away from me and gave a weak smile.

""There's something flawed in your deduction too, kid,"" he told me.  ""I didn't kill Leon Galactica... because... because I wanted more vacation time or sick days.  I killed him because he wouldn't let me go to my daughter's funeral.

""My daughter died a few weeks ago, and I asked Leon if I could go to her funeral even though I had used up my vacation time to see her alive already.  She died in a car crash, you see, and I just had to... we had a fight before I left, and I never... I never got to apologize...

""We've always had our differences, but until she was gone... I never knew... how much I loved her...

""So I asked Leon for another week, but he just flashed that contract in my face and waved it around.  Then he asked me for a new magic trick to design.  That was when I got the plan.  I would build two identical guillotines, one that worked like the magic trick should have, and one that would take that bastard's life away.

""I regret what I've done... about my daughter... but Leon can't be forgiven...!!  That's why I ahd to bring justice to him!!""

I saw Mr. Chinkerhoff cry and screw up his face with anger, and I started feeling sorry for him...

""Idiot!"" my uncle shouted.  ""You're no saviour or justice-bringer!  If you truly cared about your daughter, you would have seen here even if he was going to fire you!!""

""How dare you...!?""

""No!  Anyone who puts their work in front of their family deserves to be called an idiot!""

My uncle stormed out of the room, leaving Mr. Chinkerhoff, the handcuffs, and the other three of us watching as Detective Linger escorted Mr. Chinkerhoff out.</lj-cut>"

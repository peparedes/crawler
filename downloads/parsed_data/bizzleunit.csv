I must say, they are pretty stupid, but how intelligent can a person be at 14 right?&nbsp;<br />My life hasnt gotten much more exciting since then. Although, NEVER AGAIN will I finish one of these entries with ""i love svs"". </font></p><p><font size=""2"">That is completely juvenille and ridiculous and everyone knows I love Jordan :) so no need for me to be talking about my secret little crushes anymore.</font></p><p><font size=""2"">I'll probably be using this more often now since I haven't got anything better to do with my time.</font></p><p><font size=""2"">I'm working at a Subway, for now. I'm pretty sure I'll be fired soon:(</font></p><p><font size=""2"">Im graduating in a few months so I'm just trying really hard to get work done and all that stuff that requires motivation, something I lack horribly.</font></p><p><font size=""2"">I also failed my drivers test so I'm still a loser without my license :) Ill go to take my test again on May 24th. Wish me luck!</font></p><p><font size=""2"">Well, since myspace has taken over the world, and my pathetic life, I'm going to log in to that now :)</font></p>"

This week (which has been hell for me) has proven that no matter how much homework or reading you hafto do, and no matter how early you hafto get up, there are still ONLY 24 hours in a day to get done what needs to be done. So if you dont get your stuff together, well thats just too damn bad because life isnt exactly notorious for giving people breaks.

anyways...yeah im reading this book about stephen king, and its like reading jibberish or something. its SO BORING. All I want to read right now is the Godfather Returns..(i am number 13 on the waiting list for that :o)
anyways...all I did yesterday was BIOLOGY. I never want to pick up that book again. I never want to read about that again. I just want my Godfather book. GOSH!

its 11:38 and i just woke up alittle while ago. now there is something wrong with that. If only I had gotten up at say...8? Then maybe I could have this book (along with the rest of my schoolwork) done at a decent hour. Maybe THEN i would be able to go to sleep sometime before 2:30 a.m.
its so hard being me :)

i need a hobby or something :)

i just went searching my house for food like an animal or something. 
boredom is driving me insane. I shouldnt be bored, I should be paying close attention to my biology studies...but like WHO DOES THAT?
yeah and i have like 3/4s of this book left and it hasto be done tomorrow, im totally not gonna be able to finish it but whatever.

I don't know why 
It doesn't even matter how hard you try keep that in mind 
I designed this rhyme 
To explain in due time 
All I know 
Time is a valuable thing 
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings 
Watch it count down to the end of the day 
The clock ticks life away 
It's so unreal 
Didn't look out below 
Watch the time go right out the window 
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know 
Wasted it all just to watch you go 
I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart 
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when 

I tried so hard 
And got so far 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
I had to fall 
To lose it all 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 

One thing, I don't know why 
It doesn?t even matter how hard you try, keep that in mind 
I designed this rhyme, to explain in due time 
I tried so hard 
In spite of the way you were mocking me 
Acting like I was part of your property 
Remembering all the times you fought with me 
I'm surprised it got so (far) 
Things aren't the way they were before 
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore 
Not that you knew me back then 
But it all comes back to me (in the end) 
You kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart 
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard and got so far but in the end it doesnt even matter i had to fall to lose it all but in the end it doesnt even matter....."

"event","Whoa whoa! This weekend was pretty extreme to say the least. I went to California City for some dirt bike riding and it was grand to say the least. The whole weekend was pretty fun except for the fact that i didn't get to talk to my love as much as i wanted to. Damn desert has no service apparently. Well I bought a new bike so I had to go break it in and boy did I break it in. I ate it once and I've been super sore ever since. It's hard to play guitar because it hurts to hold a pick or move my arm at all. I'm struggling to type this right now. Ummm that was my weekend.

Regarding my life recently, I have a job and i'm working working working. I'm really excited about moving out, but not looking forward to my first month alone. School has been going smoothly and it's not killing me. I miss my love. My pool is gettin' fixed. Ummmmmm thats all. WHAT WHAT?!?!"

My brother got a new dirt bike and i'm really happy for him and now my dad is going to find one for me! Damn, I'm so excited that I started riding again, it's beeen wayyyyy too long. Ummmmm, my pool is getting fixed so now when the summer come we won't be dying of the freaking heat. Who ever invented hot sucks. Yesterday we cleaned some of the garage and we arranged our little play area so that was good. Ummm Peter's bitchass is here now. I leave you to ponder.</P>

I want to start going out some more so can somebody please be my friend and keep me company?? It would be very much appreciated. On another note, this weekend I attend the Henry Fonda for some much needed head-banging. HAH! Ummmmmm, that's all for now I suppose. OHHH! I want to move out of my house, but I need some roomates. So who wants to do it with me??? HMMMM???"

Other than that, I saw Armor for Sleep and Tsunami Bomb this past week. Both were very great shows. I can't wait until I start to play shows and be on stage. That's one of the best feelings in the world. So you guys better come to one of my shows when I start playing and crap. You better. HMMMMMMMMMMMMM.

Thank you Tiff and Hil for hilarious memories."

"event","Yesterday was the tsunami bomb show at the troubamadour. It was good. I had fun EXCEPT, I didn't get to see the person who i was looking forward to seeing. (tiff tiff) That totally bummed me out. After the show davey and I were laughing about the prelude to the show. Snoop a Loop did a guest appearance on a flatbed for everybody waiting in line. That was hilarious. And the Troubadour has a security guard that looks like Kobe Bryant. 

ANYWAYS...Today was a total work day. I cleaned the house like mad. And after this i went to go see some family at a shindig type place. And i came home to crap so i hope everybody had a fun time at doing their thing. And now i feel better. Hurraah."

"event","Yesterday was NO DOUBT one of the most amazing days in my life. I have never had so much fun in my life. It started with me waking up at like 9 and watching spiderman until 3:30. It was a spiderman show marathon on Mtv2. Great Stuff. After that my cousin took me to the Blink 182/No Doubt concert. That was great. Words cannot describe that show. The Living End was great. Blink was great. No Doubt was great. When I say great I mean like off the charts. I think i might have orgasmed during the show. There were so many moments that I should write down here but that would be a novel so I will spare you the task of reading a billion pages.

After 2 hours in the parking lot trying to leave, we get to McDonalds. We stop at a gas station to eat and two vans pull up next to us. They are obviously 2 punker bands. So I'm like hey what band are you guys. "" Lower Class Brats and Angel City Outcasts. "" Right away I thought of my dear friend Rachel. Rachel would have liked this moment. Well I talked to them for a while and found out that they came from a show they played in Victorville. Good guys.

When i get home, I find a person sleeping on my floor and it's 4:00. I go to sleep wake up at 9 and here i am at 10 45 or so typing this. woohoo."

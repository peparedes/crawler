"event","So I recently read this book called ""Tell it to Naomi"" which is about a boy who pretends to be his older sister while writing an advice column for the school paper, and apparently someone acctually made an email address (ask_naomi@hotmail.com) to do that very thing, only instead of being for a school paper, people email in and she replies, so people don't know your problems. Anyway, I'm going to give her a shot with some certain boy problems... I know that's ""girly"", but hey, I'm a girl."

"event","I'm going to the Greenday concert! yeah, that's right, best boyfriend ever. Of course, they will probably play their entire new album, which is all anti-bush, and fuck the U.S. government, just like all the other punk bands out there. Not that I'm complaining, I'd much rather hear that than ""oh my life is terrible because my girlfriend left me waah waaahhh""  If I ever have a creative burst and decide to write a song, I'd write something totally weird.. like all the old bands... take the number one song of all time (according to Rock 101) Stairway to Heaven - ""If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now, 
It's just a spring clean for the May queen.""  What's a bustle? What's a hedgerow?  haha here's what dictionary.com said 

Bustle- A frame or pad to support and expand the fullness of the back of a woman's skirt.

Hedgerow- A row of bushes, shrubs, or trees forming a hedge.

A woman's skirt pad in a row of bushes?  Awesome."

"event","Whooooo boy, bass guitar isn't always an easy instrument. Today, I've spent a fair amount of time trying to play two tunes at the same time with both hands. Yeah, it's tough... it's the charlie brown theme. You have to play the bass part tapping with your left hand and the melody tapping with your right. Try this, for all the basser's who might happen to come across this journal... highly unlikely... but I like to think I'm optimistic.

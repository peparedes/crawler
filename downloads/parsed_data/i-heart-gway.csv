"event","<br />ok so today was such a good day. it was probably one of the best in my lifee!!<br />i met <span style=""font-size: medium""><span>kristen stewart</span></span> and <span style=""font-size: medium"">nikki reed</span>! (bella and Rosalie from the movie twilight)<br /><br />i woke up at 1:30am to start getting ready, we left the school at 3 and got to the garden state mall by like 3:30<br />there were already like 130 people there! they were all spread out on the ground sleeping.<br />so me and my two friends (beans and melissa) waited till seven for hot topic to open and bought our shirts and wrist-bands<br />we were so tired and we were guaranteed our spot in line so we left the mall drove back to school and slept till about 1<br />then we left the school again at 2 and got to the mall around 2:30<br />we still had a bunch of time, the signing wasnt till 5 and we didnt really have to start lining up till 4 so we went to Jamba juice.lol<br />then we hit up barns and noble for some twilight stuff<br /><br />we went to get online&nbsp; and it was crazy they had us lined up against a wall in a loading dock.<br />if you were in the front you were fine but as more and more people showed we got pushed farther and farther back<br />IT WAS SO HOT!! my hair got messed up<br /><br />so we waited there for an hour and a half and we finally started moving. i was totally out of my mind by this point<br />everyone probably thought i was crazy! but i didnt care. <br />every time we moved i said &quot;WE ARE MOVING!!!!!&quot; I said it about 10 times! ahaha<br /><br />so when it was our turn to go in i was freaking out, like shaking and smiling haha<br />i tried to be sneaky and take a picture with my phone i managed to get one, but then this guy comes over and is like &quot;girl in the purple shirt, no pictures.&quot; so i put my phone away<br /><br />i walked up to the table and nikki was first so i was like &quot;HIIIIIII!!!&quot;&nbsp; and she was like &quot;HIIII!!&quot;<br />then i did the same thing to kristen. i also could not shut up<br />i was like thank you for coming, it means so much! and i told kristen that i thought she was the perfect bella.<br />she put that face on the one were she looks at a loss of words but said thank you.<br />she also told me she liked my shirt!!!<br /><br />then nikki said something like i hope you dont hate me as rosalie... and i was like &quot;OH MY GOD NOOOO, YOUR&nbsp; GORGEOUS, YOU BOTH ARE! and beans said that she was perfect. they said thank you again and then i said thank you like a million more times until i was pushed out the door.<br /><br />after i was just yelling and skipping but we had to get to the Q&amp;A fast to get a good spot so we ran upstairs. <br />then waited another hour and a half the girls finally showed up but they only answered like 2 questions!<br />when they were saying their goodbyes i told beans and melissa to follow me they grabbed my bag and i acted like a human plow and pushed through everyone to get outside to see them.<br /><br />this was the craziest part as soon as they came outside the whole crowed rushed toward them it was scary!<br />after that i could see how kristen could be like she is with the fans,&nbsp; i thought i was crazy, THEY ARE CRAZY! i would never do that to someone. i wish you could see it. INTENSE thats all i can say"

"event","so it was a pretty crazy weekend for me....

friday night i hung out with my cuz marielle and we wrote a song together..... and my i just say its pretty good.
saturday i had a birthday party for another one of my cousins, noah, then i babysat till 2:30.
sunday i got up to find my mom and dad in a rush they said they were taking reagan to the doctors..... no big deal right? wrong
they get back at two and i finally see reagan.....she looks really sick, apparently she was really dehydrated and if they didnt get 40 ounces of liquid into her by 2:30 they were instructed to bring her to the hospital!
it was so scary seeing her like that...she didnt do anything just layed around and she wouldnt eat or drink, she looked like a zombie
so my parents ended up bringing her to Arden Hill and my mom has been updating me like every 2 hours

dont worry, rea woke up this morning feeling a lot better"

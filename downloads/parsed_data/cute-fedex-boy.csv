"event","Well, I've been bad about updating this thing since the first few days I started it.  What can I say, I've been busy.  Between work and my new boyfriend (yes you heard it right, i've got a boyfriend) yay.  Well anyways, nothing to exciting happening today.  I just got done paying hella bills.  Ryans still at work, he's working overtime, I feel bad for him cause he's used to getting off at 4 in the afternoon, but the last few days he's been getting off at 8 in the evening.  Its all good though.  Oh yeah, the new boyfriends name is Ryan, incase whoevers reading this didnt figure that out ;-).  Later people, I'll try to be better about the updates.

"event","Oh my god, talk about frog infestation.  Theres this pond/wildlife area across the street from my house and it has a lot of little tree frogs.  Well anyways, it starts raining yesterday and the frogs decide that the inside of my garage is a nice place to hang out.  So theres like probably 150 plus frogs all over in my garage no kidding.  Well not only are they all over in the garage but there plastered all over the front window, door and outside walls of the house.  Talk about freaky.  I had to go out and have some drinks to calm down.  That pretty much calmed me down, but when I woke up thismorning, they had somehow managed to get into the house so they were jumping around in the family room which totally freaked me out.  I think I got them all out, I just hope they dont come back tonite.  I have to work early tomorrow and I dont know how the hell I'm going to get to sleep tonite.  

Besides frogs, my date that copped out on me on Thursday still hasnt called.  What the hell is wrong with guys?  You'd think that it wouldnt be that difficult to call and say I'm not interested.  A little common courtesy is all I ask.  So I called him today and left a message saying that I had a question and I'd appreciate it if he called back.  We'll see if he does.  Basically I'm gonna ask him whethere he has any interest or not.  If so great, stop being an asshole.  If not, have a nice fucking life.  Well I think I've said quite enough for tonite."

"event","Well, I just got home from work, it was ok, as far as work goes.  The highlight of my day was getting my DOT physical.  At least now I can say someone besides myself has touched me down there recently...lol.  At least I thought it was kind of amusing.  

Its finally the weekend, but since I got a part time job on Saturdays, the weekend doesnt really start until After work on Saturdays.  Except this weekend, not only do I get to work on Saturday, but Sunday as well.  I'm filling in for my friend Shannon that also works there since she's in Minnesota visiting her boyfriend.  But at least I'll be making money with no time to spend it."

"event","Oh my god, I so hate guys!  So I was supposed to go to lunch today with this guy that I met a couple weeks ago.  Well he calls about a half hour ago and cancels on me ""apparently something came up"" the really shitty thing about it is that I actually like this guy, which is rare for me.  So I'm not really sure if ""something came up"" or if he's just not as interested as I thought he was.  Anyways, on a brighter note, I have the day off YAY!  Maybe I can actually get something accomplished today."

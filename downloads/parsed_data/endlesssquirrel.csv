"event","So the other day I was in my spanish class and the teacher is teaching us how to conjugate verbs that end in AR. Fumar-to smoke is one of them. So he goes around the class asking everyone if they smoke. And then he asks how many smoke, and why, and blah blah blah. Then He goes around asking which of us smoke cigars...and I guess you can see where this leads...he asks ?Quien fuma mota? Who smokes weed? Since I sit in the very front, I was nearly singled out. Me and one other guy got labeled as the class potheads! Then he continued to ask if we smoked antes de clase o despues de clase. I replied both. Ah hahaha. Whatever, me and that guy are going to go spark one up. Lol."

"event","I'm not one to believe in horoscopes. But I've often thought that there might be a scientific explanation to them that makes sense and is true. (You know time/place of birth in relation to the planets, or something) Now I have not made my final decision on the matter, but if horoscopes are true we must not make our decision based on every horoscope out there, I do believe that probably over 90% of horoscopes are bullshit. 

Here's my horoscope for today:

Things couldn't be better for you right now (though the future does hold even bigger and better things). You've got something big on your plate that you're going to devour.

This directly correlates with an epiphany I had this morning. Coincidence? One must wonder."

"event","Well here's what been happening:

School started, and it's good, I have fun teachers and interesting classes.

Moving has haulted. We had things going good, most of our stuff was in storage, and we were just weeks away from a new home. My parents decided they rather eat steak whenever they like instead of sweating out house payments and eating top ramen, and no other luxuries.

Been bored, Jo and Jason are really the only people I've got left that are worth a damn. I'm absolutely fine with that. Just a little bored. Christina and Nora were people I could call up anytime of the week and could go out, now I have lots of time to kill on an average weekday.

Faire season is nearing, we're starting meetings for sewing and construction. 

My uncle is going to give me a singer, a real expensive one, but it is old, but apparently in really good condition.

What's happening now that we've decided to stay? We're building a room in the back for my brother, and I get his room. We're going to fix the place up real nice. Our backyard is completely cleaned out, pretty much. We got a new, lovely dinner table. The front yard is no longer a parking lot, we have grass, wonders of all wonders, and the palm trim was trimmed up and it's looking pretty sexy. 

We also painted the house. This place looks so much better now.

Well that's all for now folks."

You are on a quest for knowledge and life challenges.
You love to be curious and ask a ton of questions.
Since you know so much, you make for an interesting conversationalist.
Mentally alert, you can outwit almost anyone (and have fun doing it!).

Very introspective, you can be silently critical of others.
And your quiet nature makes it difficult for people to get to know you.
You see yourself as a philosopher, and you take everything philosophically.
Your main talent is expressing and communicating ideas.

So Normally I wouldn't repeat these types of things, I know I'm lowering myself to her level. But hell, I think after all the things she's said I'm allowed a little indulgence.

Oh yeah, Melissa thinks all her old friends from Oceanside (this area) are bums and they're going nowhere with life. We're also drug addicts, hoes, and liars.

My response to Melissa's ""Bum"" comment was this: (And yes, I did tell her to her face)

It's something I have become extremely passionate about. I am going to have to really dedicate myself into not being lazy next semester. The rewards are so worth it.

Sorry for being so fucking chatty tonight dear friends. But it was really amazing to me and I had one of the greatest times of my life. I am going to remember this day forever.

"event","Being an Atheist does not mean you're lacking morals.  

Just recently I've been calling myself an atheist. I never felt comfortable saying it before, because of the stigma that comes along with it, that atheists are morally weak. I've never believed in God. I don't believe in heaven or hell. I'm not satanic. I'm not corrupt. I value life and humanity. I'm constantly feeling the need to do more good for the world. 

I don't do things that are wrong, like killing or any of your other ""sins"". I'm not worried about the consequence of going to hell for commiting a violent act. I don't do these things because I know that if I did I would be hurting another human being. I'd be hurting another person that has the same rights I do, like having the chance for a future.

The reason I don't commit sin is not because I fear the consequences, it is because I have values.

I'm happy. I try to cheer others up. I do community service. I help to try to better others' lives. I feel a greatness to be alive. I feel fortunate to be living the life I do.

The reason I do good is not because I think I will be rewarded in the afterlife, it's because I know it will be appreciated in this life.

If atheists don't believe in an afterlife, then what do they think is the meaning of life?

I believe there was no specific meaning. But this life is ours to mold. You give it meaning. You give your own life meaning. It's all about what you do with the time you have.

I don't care what religion you are, but there are people from all forms of religion and spirituality that represent that institution negatively and positively. There are people from all walks of life that cuss, hurt, offend, and worse. And on the other hand there are people from all forms that do good for humanity.

I do good. And sometimes I do bad. But there is forgiveness among our peers. I live each day with a priority of doing good. I have strong morals.

I'm an atheist. And I'm proud to say it."

"event","Just starting to get over being sick. Didn't bring my tissues to class so I had to sniffle the whole time.

I'm really enjoying my sociology class. Today we watched a movie about hate. And last night I was inspired...by an EBAY commercial...lol...to start a sociology experiment. Now this isn't a school project, it's just a little personal thing.

We've been talking about the reasons for Hate and ways to fight it. And last class the teacher gave us handouts about gay marriage, she wants to have a class discussion about it. But I'm just about the only one in there that supports gays, so it's a little frustrating. I swear the teacher must think I am gay, and the rest of the class probably does to. Hey, I support black rights too, and I would fight for it just the same, does that make me black now?

Well I'm about to register for next semesters classes in a couple weeks...and I'm having a hard time deciding which courses to take, and when to take them. I have changed my mind so many times. Right now I think I am going to take English, Spanish, and Women's Studies. But who knows what I am going to want to take tomorrow.

I need to call Charlene about getting that job...I need to start making money.

Oh yeah and on the weight loss scene...I've lost 3 inches from my pouch. And a total of approx. 25 lbs. Still a long way to go though."

"event","Yep, I don't know what I want to say in this post. But I felt I should post, so here it is. Well here I am at the school library, on computer #25, looking up at the clock, and feeling sorry for the poor shmuck who uses this computer next. Deja Vu, right? Yep that's right, I'm sick again. Thanks Christina. Well I'll know better than to share a pipe with sick people again. YOU SUCK!

I bet all the people who shared that hookah with me are going to get sick, well at least two of them, probably Mako and Jason...no real reason for thinking those two, it's just my prediction.

My brain is definately on slow down. I like it, but it also makes me afraid of what I let slip by. Whatever. I'm just going to finish this post up and then head home and reclaim that empty spot in my bed.

<Spun off into a different tangent, SUBJECT: TACT vs HONESTY>

I've had this strange feeling recently. Now that I'm in the right place, emotionally and internally, I am finally seeing all the faults in the external factors of my life again. Which only time and progress will mend. However, I am prepared for it.
If only my concentration were better. I am far too easily distracted.  


There are many events coming up in the near future that are definately things I am looking forward to. 

Would you rather say the harsh honest truth and deal with the negative consequences, or put on a false smile to secure harmony?

This comes down to personality. Everyone knows I'm the type of person that pretty much says what's on my mind, and how I feel on a subject. I do have a great respect for tact, and value it equally. 

Tact is for those who want a controlled response, more so than an honest one. 

Honesty comes number one in my book, and I try to live by it daily in every decision that I make. I do accomplish my goal most of the time. 
Tact, though not being first, does come into play in my attitude, and this may suprise some of you.

And now here I am with my dilema...I am a person driven by honesty, but I'm trapped in a world of tact. So rather than speak my mind, since I cannot articulate my feelings using tact, I must resort to not articulating at all.

So basically, the thing is, I have a problem and everytime I try to clear the air I just cause the problem to inflame, so I've gone into a silent state where I overlook my true feelings on the topic.

TACT VS HONESTY

Here's the results of both possible scenarios: 1. I hold true to my beliefs and speak my mind, and deal with the impending explosion and messy consequences, or 2. I continue to remain silent (my only form of tact) and things remain less complicated, there is no explosion to deal with, but there is still pent up resentment, and a lack of honesty.

I dunno...I'm just throwing that one out there for you all to ponder.

What's more important to you, Honesty or Tact?"

And today some girl in my Soc. class totally pissed me off. We were talking about gay marriage, and she was like totally against it. And the class was talking about how Bush wants to make an ammendment against it. And I mentioned how I think there should be an ammendment in favor of it and protecting their civil rights and allowing gays to wed. WTF? You might as well not allow mixed races to marry, it's fucking bullshit.

"event","Poor baby got (dragged?) out back. Chloe had her in the back cornered up and chasing her around the back yard...in the middle of the night. And finally I went out to look for her and she was running away from me and freaked out her hair was all on end, and she was scared ta shit. After chasing her around for five minutes I finally went in the house and got a can of fancy feast and went out and cracked it for her and she came runnin. it was actually quite funny.

oh and just before that happened I gave her some peanut butter....hahahahahahahahahaha....that was so funny watching her lick and lick and lick hahahahhahahahaha"

"event","The time has come to write another essay...haha. It's due tomorrow...and I'm just now about to start it.

So I went to Universals the other day with my dad....well not actually universal studios...but just outside it. haha. We were going to go in if we had gone earlier in the day. But my mom said we didn't have money for that. I did go shopping around City Walk, and I went and saw Mr 3000. I bought a purse, a watch, and a rubber rat haha. 

My dad saw a concert there that night too, it was Dream Theater. While we were standing in the will call line we had a ""star"" standing right behind us. Of couse I didn't know who he was but my dad sure did. So he got his autograph and shaked his hand, and then later that night when he ran into him again he got a picture taken with him.

Who was it you ask? Steve Vai. Don't know who that is? Well he's a guitar god. Apparently he played with Zappa and Van Halen, and stuff like that. Him and Joe Satriani, or something like that, play together along with someone else and do a G3 concert tour or something.

Well Ojai is this weekend, and I still have lots to do. I have to finish my bodice, and I don't even know wtf to do about Jo's cinch. I don't have the required materials or the time. I also have school tomorrow, and then Thursday I think I am going somewhere with my mom, and then the gym. 

Oh yeah speaking of the gym. I was weighed and measured today. I've lost roughly 15 lbs. Pretty cool, and that was before I joined the gym...so hopefully I'll lose more faster since I'll be working out too.

Not doing so great in school, I've finally got work back with a solid grade, before I was unsure. Well in Math I got a D on the test...and in English...I got a D on the test. I need to fucking prepare for these things better. I have another math test this upcoming monday...should probably bring hw with me this weekend. Nah! ahaha I'll study during my 1 1/2 break between 1st and 2nd M class.

I did get a C on my last essay. I'm not worried, I'm still adjusting....I'll pass.

I guess that's all for now."

"event","Okay...enough with the fucking mosquito bites already. I've had them for a week, and they just keep getting bigger and they itch like a mother fucker.

So my hair is brown again...it's so dark that it's almost black. It came out splotchy so Minoo is going to touch it up tomorrow. She did a pretty good job considering the fact my hair was like 10 different colors before. And she gave my mom a discount.

God damn my legs itch...I'm trying to use restraint but it's extremely hard.

My cat has fleas and needs her shots...I need to take care of that soon.

Jo wants me to go over to her psuedo-bday party tomorrow. I'll have to do it after my hair appt.

I joined a gym today...finally. Tomorrow I am going in to get weighed and trained on the equipment. So I'm officially signed up...no more lazy fat ass. It's at this place kinda near Rancho called, Healthy Fitness, I think."

"event","I've been feeling very unhealthy and unfocused. Even though I'm totally high again in life...I'm realizing I don't have my shit together. I'm so fucking unhealthy. I'm going to be horrible when I'm older if I don't start to change my shit.

I don't eat right, I don't take care of my body. I need to eat healthy, take vitamins, exercise, use lotion more so my skin doesn't dry out. I need to wear sunscreen. I need to lose my weight, I was doing good for a while, I lost about 15 lbs....I don't really feel like it though, but then I got lazy and stopped. I need to get back on track health wise.

On the mental side of that, I need to freaking focus. I need to stop screwing around and I need to take school more seriously. I need to get over this ADD thing. I swear I have ADD, I can't concentrate ever, I don't feel secure in myself, I have the feeling I'm going to fuck up school. I've never felt like this before. 

Jesus, I already know I am going to be regretting my actions ten years from now. Well at least I'm aware that I'm making the wrong moves and hopefully I will learn from it and correct it soon before I really screw things up. I'm trying to turn these mistakes around...but it's hard because I want to totally be fine, but it takes longer than I like.

Though I know I am going to get what I want in the end...I'm just afraid that it's going to take twice as long as I want it to. But maybe I should just slow down and enjoy my youth while pacing myself through school. I dunno, what I have been doing lately doesn't seem worth my time as much as school would be.

On a more pleasant note, I heard from Nora today. She's sad, she misses everyone. But she did get accepted....so that means we won't be seeing her for a while. I'm going to get a job so I can earn money to buy a plane ticket to see her. Plus, I've never left the country before...besides TJ. Also, I've never been on a plane before. So I'm really excited about that."

Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

Remember the good times that we had?
I let them slip away from us when things got bad
How clearly I first saw you smilin' in the sun
Wanna feel your warmth upon me, I wanna be the one

I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

I'm so tired but I can't sleep
Standin' on the edge of something much too deep
It's funny how we feel so much but we cannot say a word
We are screaming inside, but we can't be heard

But I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

I'm so afraid to love you, but more afraid to loose
Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose
Once there was a darkness, deep and endless night
You gave me everything you had, oh you gave me light

And I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

And I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by

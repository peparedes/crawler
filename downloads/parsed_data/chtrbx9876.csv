If not for a long time, then just for a few months.  Regardless of what i've said in the past, i really hope that it's possible for my to stay with them.  I was talking with Big Carol today and she was saying how i could just job share both the office and Zellers.  and im going to try that for a while, Little Carrol really likes that idea :P  She would be lost without me haha.  yeah she would.

So I got my job offer today and they gave me this folder with a million pieces of paper and two little booklets i have to read through and a bunch of pages to sign and what not.  and i also got my shirt.  that's right.  i officially have a red zellers golf shirt.  how sexy is that.

Alright well...hmm what else?  i havent been home alot lately...for a good reason. i'd rather not talk about it, a few people know..that's all that need to know...

Anyways, i havent talked to him in almost a month! :( i'm not liking this too much.  the poor guy got kicked out of his house a few weeks ago and hasnt been able to talk to me..it sucks so much.  but hopefully...i can keep hoping...hopefully he goes home soon or something..

Okay well im going to stop blabbing for now, love you all very dearly

"event","True Story: A religion teacher assigned her class an essay on what makes a good Christian. One student wrote about praying nightly, say no to abortion, banning gay marriage, and donating money. The other student wrote about talking to God and allowing people to enjoy their lives, and supporting gay marriage. The day the teacher was to hand the papers back, she called up the second student and told him she would pray for him when he went to hell. The student asked why would he be going to hell, and why he got an F on his paper. The teacher told him that Catholicism is against gay marriage. The student looked at her for a minute, then said aloud, ""I'm gay."" The teacher kicked him out of class as if he had said fuck or worshiped Satan. A girl in the back of class who had a boyfriend and was obviously straight got up and left too.

If you would leave the classroom, repost this. It doesn't matter if you're straight, bi, or gay. It doesn't matter if you're Catholic or not. Everyone is a human being and deserves happiness.

Soooooooo stupid. It's not like being gay isn't natural. It happens with animals and stuff, and you can't get much more natural than animals who live their lives off of instinct."

okay well YAY grad is tomorrow!!  ..yeah..rehearsal was awesome :D

I dont know what to say..hmm...im not feeling very excited for some reason.  it'll hit me tomorrow while we're all getting ready in the library..all of us standing there in our caps and gowns..and walking into the gym is going to be so amazing and rewarding.

boys are stupid.  but then again, everyone knows that so that's not news.

"event","I havent updated in quite a while, i thought it was time.

so let's see...school is..messed up to say the least.  it's completely my fault, i know this.  but i have to finish...approximately 35 guides in one week (for those of you who do not go to thss..that's almost two full courses)  so it isnt looking good.  but i have hope...i guess..i figured out all the guides that are possible to do..and that would leave me with 22 guides left in total.  

do you think they would let me go on the final grad list with 7 extra guides left??  

Other than that, life is..alright.  confusing as hell right now.  there are people who know the whole story (well that's a lie..nobody knows the WHOLE story..) and there are people who have no idea what I'm talking about...but here goes..

there's was this boy who really liked me and i was confused and felt bad because i led the poor kid on..broke his fragile little heart..but i didnt want to lie to him!  that would have been worse right?  right.  okay on with the story.  then there was this other guy who liked me..alot..but i dotn like him like that at all!  i told him that i just wanted to be friends (haha nobody knew about this guy :P ) but he didnt take that very well..i think he's alright now though..im not sure, he talks to me still so that's a good sign eh!  anyways.  then there is this boy taht im really smitten with at the moment :) he makes me smile and he's so cute and nice and awesome.  he really likes me and that makes me SO incredibly happy to think about.  i cant stop thinking about him actually haha...it's starting to get annoying actually.  all i ever think about is him and school... *BUT* there is one MAJOR problem with him that I wont go into at the moment because it's a little embarrassing..it shouldnt be, i shouldnt care what other people think right?  i just cant help it.  I dont like it when people judge me.  friggen judges.  

Anyways..to recap - there was a boy, broke his heart.  there was a second boy, broke his heart as well.  the third boy is amazing and i really feel a connection with him. i want to know where this is going..but im scared..

Alright.  well know that i've successfully managed to confuse a great deal of people (look at me..thinking people actually read this haha), i will be off.  oh!  and for those people that see me at school.  yell at me if you see me outside of a work area or slacking PLEASE!  thank you muchly :)

bye for now!

My day has been *almost* COMPLETELY crappy.  bah I hate crappy days.  Okay, well even if you don't want to hear about it (or rather, read about it) then avert your eyes and kindly scroll down to a different comment.

Okay, it started out by waking up at 7:26...that's not good considering my bus comes at 7:45 and that means that I have to leave at 7:35ish.  not good at all.  I managed to get dressed and ready by 7:35 (don't ask me how, I have NO idea) but then!  of course!  I put my jacket on and pull my hair out of the jacket and i hear something fall to the ground.  immediately i think that it was one of my beads from my earrings..so i check the lobe earrings first..nope, all beads are there.  oh crap..that means it was one of my more expensive beads from the cartiledge piercing..gah.  I reach up and, low and behold, there is only one bead there.  i don't have the time to go down on my hands and knees and search around the floor outside my room for a tiny silver bead!  are you kidding?!  my bus is coming in 10 minutes!  I do a half assed job of moving a box and looking but alas, nothing.  damn.

anyways...i leave and i'm out the door by 7:40...but the damn bus was early and therefore it sped past me while i was *almost* at the stop.  bloody bus drivers.  no effing respect i tell ya.  anyways...everything worked out there...i ended up catching the next bus at around 7:55 and made it to the mall by 7:59ish and had just enough time to get to the comfy short bus before the driver left.  woot go me.

anyways.  the day was alright from then until the end of 3rd block.  i remembered that i was supposed to go see mrs. oliver to get some work that i can do tonight (hmm look how well that turned out..getting lots done!) but i *completely* forgot.  i remembered at 11:50..good, just enough time.  i get down there and she's sitting in her office and then she gives me the work.  that's it for that story.

ok.  i'll paint a picture for you for this one.  It's 2pm and you're in the bus ed lab (if you dont go to my school..then just picture a big room with a million computers in it..that's pretty much it) and you're sitting there minding your own business working on an entrepreneurship guide and chewing some really tasty gum, when you bite down to the delicious tasting gum, a bite into something extremely hard.  it really really hurts and so you take the gum out of your mouth and take a look at the gum. there's something little, hard, and silver sitting in the middle of your gum. you automatically think ""oh shit, that isnt supposed to happen.."" so you slowly and cautiously move your tounge over to where the throbbing pain is..there is a hole where there shouldn't be one.. oh yes, that's right...you, my friend, have just taken out a filling.  that's a bitch eh.

this is where the day gets a smidgen better...i sign out of bus ed and go downstairs to the rotunda to waste yet another block.  i hung out there for a bit and had a couple laughs..those girls are always good for a laugh.  then i go down to the tech lab to see who's there.  i hung out with nic and dan for a while.  it was funny, dan was reading stupid american laws.  that was interesting.  did you know that in Arizona, it's illegal to have more than one dildo in one house?  or that in San Fransisco, you can't walk down the street if you're considered an ""ugly"" person?  Why are americans so stupid? (sorry Utah) Oooh speaking of Utah, let's see how stupid they are shall we...did you know that when a person reaches the age of 50, he/she can then marry their cousin? or how about ..It is illegal not to drink milk.  good times good times...

but then it was time to go home and i went to sign out of ta.  good times didnt last long.  I walk into mrs. martin's office and she says something about how she wasnt sure i was there today (she wasnt at morning ta) because i hadnt come to see her at 2:30 when i was supposed to...""oh shit""...oh shit is right!  then i apologized for completely forgetting about her.  she forgave me and said that i can just go and see her next wednesday instead.  sounds fair.  so then i head out on my walk to work..

I get halfway across the field and I look up and Rita's waiting for me...*sweet I don't have to walk alone anymore.  woot*...so we walk the rest of the field and then we cross the street we get to the other side and I stop..""fuck, I forgot..""..then rita ""what did you forget?"" ""i friggen forgot my purse!"" pain in the ass.  I told her she didnt have to come back with me because she had to start work soon so she went on to work and i returned to the lovely place that is Thomas Haney.  But of course i didnt just forget my purse in my locker, oh no, that would be too convenient.  I forgot it in the rotunda when i was hanging out with those people in there.  i walk in the rotunda but OF COURSE it isnt there...luckily dustin was and he informed me of the fact that i was called to the office.  so i politely thanked dustin and went upstairs and ran into kevin and nelie and gab upstairs by the office.  i say hi then go through the doors and reclaim my precious purse (if i lost it..oh man..not good).

Then I go back into the hall and ask kevin what he's up to.  he explains that he's waiting for mr. frechette to discuss some fitness marks that were unfair or something like that.  then he mentions that he's going down to champions afterwards.  so, since at this point of each wednesday (it was around 3:15) I'm already almost at work, I figured that it wouldnt be very good if i started walking now, i kindly ask kevin if i could get a ride downtown with him, he says of course but he has to talk to mr. frechette first.  that's no problem.  so i walk downstairs with him and nelie and i figured that i had a few minutes to spare so i went and talked to mrs. martin for a few minutes.  then after about 10 minutes i go meet up with kevin and we walk over to his car and nelie's already waiting inside.  we get downtown and i graciously thank kevin for his kindness and begin my trek over to work.

Nothing too extremely exciting happened at work, denise took an xray of my broken tooth :( but she didnt have time to develop it so she pushed the button and left me sitting there with the xray in my mouth and the led vest laying across me, high up on a chair.  i had to put everything away and develop MY OWN xray..geez..what kind of service is that?!

I'm almost done, I swear

If you're still reading..then wow, you're amazing!

back to the story of my day, then Denise gave me a ride home and now here I am writing this post and listening to music and chatting to some people.  what else is new eh? woot exciting life.  I think i'm going to do some english hw after this..i get to write uhm..either a critical, analytical (haha anal), or interpretive paper on a poem..not sure which paper yet though :S hmm i shall check on my lg.

ta ta for now!  

*I was going to say something but i forgot so I'll sing instead...

{ I am not a child now, 
I can take care of myself, 
I mustn't let them down now,
Mustn't let them see me cry,
i'm fine,
i'm fine. 

I'm too tired to listen,
I'm too old to believe
All these childish stories.
There is no such thing as faith,
And trust, 
And pixie dust.

I try,
But it's so hard to believe.
I try, 
But i can't see what you see.
I try,
I try, 
I try.

My whole world is changing,
I don't know where to turn.
I can't leave you baby,
But i can't stay and watch the city burn;
Watch it burn.

'Cause i try,
But its so hard to believe.
I try,
But i cant see what you see.
I try, 
I try.

I try and try,
To understand,
The distance in between,
The love i feel,
The things i fear,
I dearly say good dream.

I can finally see it,
Now i have to believe,
All those precious stories,
All the world is made of faith,
And trust,
And pixie dust.

So i'll try,
Cause i finally believe!
I'll try,
Cause i see what you see.
I'll try,
I'll try!
I'll try!
I'll try -
To fly. }

hmm well wasnt that fun.  okay i'm done now.  this was a really long post and it took a long time but it's all good cuz, in my opinion, it was really fun.  woot okay, well comment!"

                         Oh, gee...thanks :)  That made my day.

                                                                 Onto something better...Well not really...

Im a little dissapointed today.  Not mad, not sad...dissapointed.  

       Shall I elaborate?

<lj-cut text=Why is Jessica dissapointed?>Some of you may know this already (Nadia does, I know that) but Jessica is dissapointed because she was supposed to go over to her very cute boyfriend's house this coming Saturday and Sunday...but plans change.  Now she doesnt know WHEN she will see the little guy next.  They only ever get to see each other once a week (two if they're lucky..) and this week there is a definite chance that they won't get to see each other even once!  This upsets Jessica.  She might not even get to see him for two whole weeks...</lj-cut>

      okay, don't ask me why this was in third-person.  I do not know.  I'm just crazy like that.

...........................................................................................................

Let's see, what else is going on in my life that would interest you guys?

            Nothing that would interest you...                                         

But I will go into it anyways!

                                                                                           Just humour me.

..........................................................................................................

                    Let's see now, what have I done lately that is interesting...hmm...

Oh, I did my volunteer hours at the bank throughout Spring Break..but I think I talked about that in my last post...hmm...

I finished Marketing 11 during the first week of Spring Break!  and I started Marketing 12 yesterday...
 
But the school is extremely CHEAP and therefore I do not get a textbook...

                 Because, y'know, that's not really important in order to do the course...

                                                                                       Everyone knows that.

Oooh, I'm listening to Robin Black at the moment but that can change any second 

(or in 30 seconds to be exact...)

Ok...No More Robin Black...

..........................................................................................................

My aunt is going through like menopause or some shit like that and she's being a complete bitch to EVERYONE in the house, I <lj-cut text=read this word at your own risk>fucking</lj-cut> dislike her at the moment.  I can't even talk to her.  Blah..

          That last cut was just so that I didnt offend anyone with that rather spicy word.

...........................................................................................................

Oh!  My work called me today!

Why? you ask

Well I'll tell you

<lj-cut text=if you dont want to know, then don't click here</lj-cut>Well!  it started like this...

I was about to lay down for a nap and I told my uncle that if someone calls for me, then just wake me up.  well...low and behold, the phone rings JUST as I closed the door and sat on my bed.  My uncle laughed and handed me the phone...it was the receptionist, Carol, who wanted to ask me a question.  She asked me if I'd seen a crown on March 23rd...

That is a RIDICULOUS question, considering that I see a number of crowns on any given day and it would be silly to assume that I would remember one single crown from 3 weeks ago.  Would you agree?

Anyways..I tell her that I dont recall and I'm not sure if I saw that particular crown on that particular day..so (get this) she proceeds to..describe...the crown.  In hopes that perhaps a description of the crown will perhaps joggle my memory and allow me to remember

Keep in mind that all crowns look the same, more or less

To summarize, I dont have a clue what crown she's talking about</lj-cut>

...........................................................................................................

Anyways, I think that's it..oh wait..one more cut because I'm being an lj-cut whore

<lj-cut text=if you read all of this post..then I salute you</lj-cut>
Small, Simple, Safe Price.
Rise The Wake And Carry Me With All Of My Regrets.
This Is Not A Small Cut That Scabs,
And Dries
And Flakes
And Heals.
And I Am Not Afraid To Die.
I'm Not Afraid To Bleed
And Fuck
And Fight.
I Want The Pain Of Payment.
What's Left,
But A Section Of Pigme Sized Cuts?
Much Like A Slew Of A Thousand Unwanted Fucks.
Would You Be My Little Cut?
Would You Be My Thousand Fucks?
And Make Mark Leaving Space For The Guilt To Be Liquid.
To Fill
And Spill Over
And Under My Thoughts.
My Sad
Sorry
Selfish Cry Out To The Cutter.
I'm Cutting Trying To Picture Your Black Broken Heart.
Love Is Not Like Anything.
Especially A Fucking Knife.</lj-cut>

Okay, bye bye for now

"event","hey!  it's been a while since I've posted a real entry on this here website.  let's see...I'm happy!  lol I haven't been happy in a while...a loooong while...but things are going good and that makes me happy!

Let us look deeper into the life of Jess at the moment...

My work experience hours at the bank are going really really well...the people there are friggen awesome!  I miss Scott though lol I was following him around on my first day there and he taught me alot...he's a very...flamboyant...young man.  But I havent seen him yet since last Monday :(  Hopefully I get to see him again before I leave.  I'm learning lots from there...it's really confusing and there's lots to remember but it's all good.  And I finished Marketing 11!  I've done 8 guides so far this break..I'm very proud of myself.  Now I cant start on Marketing 12 when school starts again...it's gonna be great.  Work is alright lol same old same old..nothing new in that part.

Im kindof dissapointed in the fact that I don't get much of a Spring Break this year, but that's alright..I'll have a kick ass summer. 

<lj-cut text=""Let's go over my spring break shall we?""> 

I got my first weekend mostly to myself (other than saturday for work) then on Monday the 21st, I started my work experience at VanCity (good good credit union..you should join :P) and that went from 930am til 530pm, i had a good time hanging out with Scotty.  Then i had WE again on tuesday with the same times, this time i was with a woman named Wendy but she wasnt really into it so Liz told me just to go and follow Paula around all day, so I did that.  

Then on Wednesday I slept in (ooh so nice) then I had work at 4pm until probably around 7ish, same as Thursday.  Then Friday..was concert day!  That was awesome..I met stacie at my bus stop (by surprise) then we waited like an hour and a half for Genna lol that was fun..then it was off to Vancouver.  I bought two t-shirts (saosin and the used) and some stickers and buttons (the used and bleed the dream) then we watched an AWESOME concert and I moshed it up..yeah I did..hehe I have bruises lol but it was SO worth it.  Then we came home and I uhh..oh called travis and fell asleep.  

Then Saturday I didnt have work so I uhh..hmm...what did I do?  geez I hate it when I cant remember what I did..If someone knows, please inform me..hmm...Sunday I uhh slept in then umm...did homework and then made some Easter Chicken Cacciatore lol, for foods class ok..I got a friggen good mark too.  yay go me.  And I was supposed to hang out with Mikey but the weather did not co-operate :(  we'll do our picnic one day!

well then Monday came and Travis came over all day which was really fun.  We just hung out, we went to visit Stacie at work for a bit, he had to help her fix the cash register lol.  Then we ran into Genna and Danny on the bus on the way back to my house.  then we had a nap when we got home which was SO nice :).  but then he had to leave at like 9 so i was sad (lol he stayed longer than he was supposed to..he was supposed to leave at like 7 or 8..hehe ooops) anyways, so I took him back to coquitlam station and his bus was supposed to get there at 10 but i just missed mine to come home so i would have to wait until 1030 so he checked the other possible bus that he could take and that one came at 1030 so he decided to take that one so we went to A&W just to get out of the cold for a bit.  then he didnt want me to leave so i ended up taking the bus back to Braid station with him, then i had to take it all the way back by myself lol..through riverview hospital *shudder* but yes, I got home at around 12ish (more like 1145 but still).  then i went to bed (oh, travis left me his sweater..it smells so good :P)

And then today I had more Work Experience at the bank, I was with Sonja today which was cool.  It was so busy today though, first day back after a long weekend..it was lined up all the way to the door practically the entire day, it was insane..needless to say, i didnt get to do much..but it's okay, i dont mind just watching them work.  

Tomorrow I'm sleeping in then going to work at 4 til 7ish, then coming home and doing homework..woot...then thursday is the same thing as wednesday...then friday I have volunteer hours (it's casual friday I'm excited..ooh and April Fool's Day) hey, it's my cousin Walter's birthday on friday..he's gonna be 31..happy birthday walter! okay, then saturday I have work work from 11am til 430ish then homework all night.  

Sunday! I am hopefully hanging out with Shirley Temple for a couple hours!  Then I'm going to hang out with Travis for a while at like 4 til i dunno when..not too late...Then comes Monday the 4th, and I am supposed to be going to school but that's the day that I'm finishing up my work experience..maybe i'll get excited like Mattias and tell everyone that they're awesome and give everyone a hug and do the heel-click-while-jumping thing all the way out the door :P  nah, t'will be a sad day...I'll miss them...

And then on Tuesday it's back to school for me to hand in my marketing guides hehe..I feel sorry for Mrs. Oliver..but not really. </lj-cut>

lol that had to be a record-breaking lj-cut haha..if you actually read all of that, I salute you!  you amaze me.  But yes, that's my hectic but happy spring break.  did i mention that im happy?  oh..well im happy! :)  haha woot.  okay but it's back to my accounting homework (lol I took a break...shhh) okay, ta ta for now everyone.  love you tons

FRIDAY...

Genn, Michelle and I went to surrey to meet up with some ppl and go to the band wars.  lol we made rum oranges, it was fun.  I'm surprised that they actually worked though..it was so yummy.. we put rum in each piece of an orange and press and sealed them all.  then we ate them on the bus, it was SO good, except I got one of the pieces that was really full..that one tasted a bit gross, but it's all good!  ok, then we got to braid station and met up with travis and his friend coco.  we all took the skytrain to surrey central..lol michelle spilled orange juice all over her crotch when she was trying to mix the drink lol..she was pretty mad.  But then coco went home, and travis and genn went over to the bank so michelle and I went over to go to the washroom in stardust but they werent opening the doors yet..michelle was getting antsy so we went over to the mall to see if we could find a bathroom that had one of those dryer things.  It's so impossible to find one of those when you're actually looking..it's really annoying.  anyways, we finally found one that had one in it but of course murphy's law kicked in..it didnt work, so we went over to the guys washroom BUT!  can you guess...that one didnt work either...so michelle had to just live with her wet crotch.  so we went back to stardust and genn and travis were already there waiting, so we all go in and we're just hanging out, watching the bands.  michelle left with a couple friends a while later, then travis had to go at 11 so i walked him to the bus stop..that was interesting..needless to say, he missed his bus and had to call his mommy to pick him up..hehe he's a mama's boy.  but i went back to stardust just in time to catch the last like 30 seconds of tripsis' set...it was so good, they'd better win!  ok, but then genn and I were being groupies and went to dinner with everyone at boston pizza (everyone being everyone from tripsis plus a couple other ppl that i dont know)  anyways, i got home at 3am and went to bed.

Saturday...

got up, went to work, came home from work, called genn cuz she was supposed to go out to coquitlam to meet travis.  I really badly wanted to have a shower cuz i stunk like a dentist office but the bus was coming and genn told me to run to get it, but it was already at 210th so there was no way i would get there in time.  So i got my uncle to drive me to haney place and i just met up with them there.  then we took a cab to tim hortons and hina was working!  i love hina, i didnt know she worked there.  but yeah, we just hung out there for a bit (oh, we being genn, travis, lauren, and I) then we went out to the bus stop so we could go to genn's and steph, kristin, and jan were across the street, so we yelled at each other.  then we got on the bus and just hung out at genn's for a bit.  cherry acts was having a practise so OF COURSE Natasha and I had to go over there...DJ was there!! woot i love dj, havent seen him since like the end of october/beginning of november.  He let me play his bass and there's a new guitarist, i forget his name but he was cool.  Then we went back over to genns and Danny and Lauren blocked me in genn's room and was harrassing me, that was interesting...then Will callde and invited me over later so that was cool.  Then at like 9:30, I had to walk travis to the bus stop and then i met up with will at the husky after travis left.  Hung out with will for a bit..then came home and talked to travis all night..blah...

Sunday...

What did I do on sunday?...oh right!  Went out to coquitlam at like 4 and hung out with travis at coquitlam center for a while then got bored so we decided to go out to his house to hang out.  I met his family, they are so awesome, i love them.  His sister is so cool  lol we didnt stop making fun of the mama's boy the entire time, it was awesome.  But yeah, he made me a green balloon cat because green is my favorite color and I dont like dogs (he remembers these things...bah) but we didnt really do anything when i was there, we watched america's funniest home videos and extreme makeover - home edition and then just hung out and he dad offered to drive me home, which was incredibly nice of him.  So he drove me home at like 11 and then i talked to travis on the phone when i got home until like i dont even know..2 or something? bah, boys are stinky...

But yes, that was my weekend..that was a long ass update..somebody had better leave a message, or I'll be uber pissed..YES, UBER-pissed...oooh you dont want that...

P.S. It's my one month anniversary today, will's taking me out on a date later today..woot..we'll see how that goes..."

I dont know why I thought that!  Maybe because he's flirty?  and I thought that he might like me...but of course that wouldn't happen.  I dont think I'm upset about it, well that's a lie, i am upset about it.  But I understand that nothing could happen, a couple people told me to not ""waste my time"" on him.  And somewhere deep down I KNEW that it wasnt a good idea to get feelings for him, but it's not really something you can control y'know?  Well now that I know for sure that nothing can or will happen, I'm going to try to just forget it.  I hope we can still be friends, cuz he's fun to hang out with.  And now that he knows (he ASKED me!) I just hope that things dont get weird.  We're talking about it right now, I'm being all mature and stuff, and I really hope that we can still be friends and hang out.  I dont know why I'm writing all this, I guess it's just that I need to tell someone (or in this case, something..)  I hope i dont screw this up"

It was pretty fun, except it was Dogpile on Jessica day or something, it was insane <a href='http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb008' target='_blank'><img src='http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/10/10_1_11.gif' border=0></a>.  Then after that I went to Chelsea's house with <a href='http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb008' target='_blank'><img src='http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/25/25_3_47.gif' border=0></a> <a href='http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb008' target='_blank'><img src='http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/25/25_1_32.gif' border=0></a> and <a href='http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb008' target='_blank'><img src='http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/25/25_3_3.gif' border=0></a> (they didnt have Caillie so I guess her new name is Callie...) I hit my head THREE times! <a href='http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb008' target='_blank'><img src='http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/10/10_1_108.gif' border=0></a> We got bored at around 10:30 so we umm..yeah..you can guess <a href='http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb008' target='_blank'><img src='http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/12/12_13_7.gif' border=0></a> <a href='http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb008' target='_blank'><img src='http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/12/12_4_19.gif' border=0></a>.

Anyways, then it turned into Sunday! <a href='http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb008' target='_blank'><img src='http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/13/13_3_1.gif' border=0></a> and I went home around like 11:30 I think and then <a href='http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb008' target='_blank'><img src='http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/25/25_3_3.gif' border=0> called me around 12:30ish to let me know to go to Tim Hortons! And we went to see Kwynn and Tad (yeah, not very common names so there were NO smilies..the two closest were <a href='http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb008' target='_blank'><img src='http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/24/24_11_8.gif' border=0></a> and <a href='http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb008' target='_blank'><img src='http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/24/24_7_55.gif' border=0></a> ) play with <a href='http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb008' target='_blank'><img src='http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/24_7_94.gif' border=0></a>. who kicked some serious butt by the way...<a href='http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb008' target='_blank'><img src='http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/23/23_12_10.gif' border=0></a>.  And <a href='http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb008' target='_blank'><img src='http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/24_2_77.gif' border=0></a> came to hang out for a while, which was cool.  And there was a really cool band <a href='http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb008' target='_blank'><img src='http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/7_1_52.gif' border=0></a> named Corporately Insane who you should all check out at www.corporatelyinsane.com.  <a href='http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb008' target='_blank'><img src='http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/25/25_1_32.gif' border=0></a> and I think that they should change their name though..something like <a href='http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb008' target='_blank'><img src='http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/25/25_1_32.gif' border=0></a> and <a href='http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb008' target='_blank'><img src='http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/25/25_6_45.gif' border=0></a> (and <a href='http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb008' target='_blank'><img src='http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/25/25_3_47.gif' border=0></a> too I guess).  It has a certain 'je ne sais quois' dontcha think? hmm..well I like it!  K, anyways.  So we did that and we got cds <a href='http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb008' target='_blank'><img src='http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/95.gif' border=0></a> and <a href='http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb008' target='_blank'><img src='http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/24/24_8_8.gif' border=0></a> and <a href='http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb008' target='_blank'><img src='http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/24/24_1_45.gif' border=0></a> are hot!  haha, whoo..lip rings!  I think I'm having too much fun with these pictures..this is taking a while...but then I went home and my cousin <a href='http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb008' target='_blank'><img src='http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/25/25_9_59.gif' border=0></a> called me and I went driving...ON THE ROADS! <a href='http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb008' target='_blank'><img src='http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/23/23_6_7.gif' border=0></a>.  Then I came home and probably did some hw...<a href='http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb008' target='_blank'><img src='http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/3/3_3_102.gif' border=0></a>

But then it turned to Monday <a href='http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb008' target='_blank'><img src='http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/13/13_3_2.gif' border=0></a> and the weekend was over <a href='http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb008' target='_blank'><img src='http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/23/23_28_101.gif' border=0></a> 

So until something exciting <a href='http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb008' target='_blank'><img src='http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/4/4_1_105.gif' border=0></a> happens, I will check ya later

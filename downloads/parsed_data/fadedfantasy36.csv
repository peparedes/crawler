i went down to unload a pacient at the hospital to the car in the morning and this ""consturuction worker"" guy asked me where something was like direction wise and i told him idk im not from here and he asked where im from n i said lakeland and then he asked me how old i was, and not thinking about it i was like 15. and then i go to walk off cause im takin this lady in who was havin these seziures and her husband couldnt take her in cause he only had one leg. and then hes like no wait do u want to go to my cousins party with me. im like i need to get this pacient in so i walked off. then he followed me in tehre and kept askin me all these questions like what high school i went to so i was lyin n told him all this wrong info. and when i went to go back to the second floor where i normally work and he followed me to the elevator. so i didnt go in it i walked around in the er for like 10 mins. finally i lost him and i ran up there and told bry and her mom and judy. they told me to go tell security so me and bryanna went down to tell security and he came around the corner and we were outside by ourselves. then he started askin me all the same questions again and started grabing my arm and rubing it n stuff and brys like im gunna go and get some wheelchairs moved or something like that and she ran in there panicing telling this lady to call security. so she was like whats wrong and bryanna was like freaking out n almost crying and was like child abducter scary guy. and when she walked off hes like shes not gunna do something stupid and report me is she. and im like no i doubt it and hes liek she best not im jsut talkin. and the whole time he had his hand rapped around my arm! and then all of a sudden security and the nurse and everyone started runin out there and he tried walkin off and i took off to go inside and they had to go get him n stuff. and then they filed a report and i had tot ell them all that happened. and it turned out the police went n told his boss and they fired him right then and there. and then theyre like if u feel safer file a report at lakeland police and stuff. n he knows my full name cause my badge. and he read it outloud n stuff. so they told me out a paper over my last name so now im like scared outa my mind hes gunna try n hunt me down. its just freaky. me n bry broke down in the elevator cryin...it was a crazy day....

its kinda weird when a long friendship ends. its like, you have a big urge all of a sudden to call her n tell her what happened and stuff but u relize you cant. but this time theres no goin back. everything happens for a reason they say. maybe one day ill figure out the reason for this. i just know things are never gunna get better with us. so y drag it on?...
o yeah i cant bring ur stuff tommorrow its at my moms n i aint gunna b htere till thursday. so ill give it to chris friday. thats the soonest i can. im givin him a note to give u with it. 

other then that lifes really the same. im lookin forward to this summer. my concert with ashley h n brandi. and new york...

i wish i lived a whole different life. like the kind on tv. maybe like in laguna beach. they have it perfect. unlike mine will ever be.

we have so many projects. i just got done with that brochure for espositos thats due tommorrow. it was easy though.



ive made some really stupid choices in the past week...not goin into detail about that though.

today was alot better at school. i still cant wait to leave there though. i hate it there. its like a jail. 
tommorrow im goin to sea world w/ cherish...ive never been there in my life though. lol. it should b fun.
next week for career shadowing me n ashley r goin to melaines.

i cant wait till summer. its gunna b so much better than school. i dont ever wanna b home though. i cant wait till i can drive. i can go n e where i want then.

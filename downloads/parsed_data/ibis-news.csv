"event","Briefly, business is going well and I just got some really nice high end items on consignment from an advanced collector friend of mine. I'm typically hesitant about consignment deals, but we've worked out a good deal, and I get to work with some juicy pieces, including a mark and period Jiaqing bowl, possibly imperial. 

In all the tumult, however, I try to take time to stop and smell the....lichens?

"event","Some of the things I'm working with or have sold recently:

From an acquaintance in Singapore, I found this Chinese plate from the first quarter of the 19th century. It was made for export to SE Asia. 
<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ibis_news/pic/0002kh7e/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ibis_news/pic/0002kh7e/s320x240"" width=""241"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

This big monochrome rouleau vase was made circa 1890, in what we would call the tail end of the Kangxi Revival, when lots of 17th century styles were en vogue. With incised sea dragon design. Peacock turquoise blue with fish roe crackle glaze. I love this color. 
<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ibis_news/pic/0002p85a/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ibis_news/pic/0002p85a/s320x240"" width=""199"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

This bowl bears a Qianlong mark in overglaze iron red...but it is spurious. In reality, this piece is typical of Tongzhi (about 1860) heavily potted minyao (common, peoples) wares, but of better quality than most. 
<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ibis_news/pic/0002qtph/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ibis_news/pic/0002qtph/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""182"" border='0'/></a>

This ware has become something of a specialty of mine. Not many people are aware of it. Late 19th century, prunus design on a yellow ground, glazed on the biscuit. Lidded jars are not really my thing, but in this case the melon shape is completed only with the stem on the top of the lid.

Quick recap, perhaps details to follow:

My move to Trocadero is still looking like a good decision: selling things! 
Trip to L.A. for a seminar on ancient metallurgy at UCLA/Getty, hosted by Prof. David Scott; got me thinking of grad school in conservation.....

"event","<p>Ah, its been a while. I'm still here, and have been selling swords and porcelain.&nbsp;<br />I suppose the biggest development recently is that I've recently joined Trocadero.com and am trying to build my listed inventory there. Its a much higher quality place than ebay...much better for my purposes for now. But a thing I've learned and observed is that to work in this business, one must have many ways of selling items. For instance, Ebay, Trocadero, a store, a live auction, space in antique malls, a website. Many of the successful dealers I know are represented in all of these. In any event, I'll endeavor to write a bit more. I'll leave with posting this image of a 2nd century Gandharan grey schist sculpture of the head of Buddha.

"event","Two hours ago my batch of items up for auction closed. 
I'm damn encouraged by the results.&nbsp;  

It's funny, out of 10 items I have to ship to the UK, Italy, Cyprus, and just south of me in Tampa. The stars of the show were the guangxu spoons I posted pics of, that reached 4x what I paid, and the Persian dagger, that finished at twice what I gave for it. I'm proud of the spoons because Chinese porcelain is a difficult field.&nbsp; And the experience I had buying the dagger was not without apprehension; I knew I had found a deal but I'm still a little uncomfortable dropping so much cash on one purchase.&nbsp; 
Not everything did well, but thats just part of the game. I had no serious losses, and some big hits made up for any mediocrity. 
Overall, I'm very excited to move forward with this."

"event","Well, I'm rushing again to meet some deadlines for my business. Sometimes I really wish the internet would close at 5 oclock. <br /><br />Some more inventory came in recently, some really good stuff. I'll post pictures as I take them. <br />However, here is a Japanese piece I picked up at a big show near Orlando a month ago: <br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ibis_news/pic/00009ask/""><img height=""240"" alt="""" width=""245"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ibis_news/pic/00009ask/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ibis_news/pic/0000arhb/""><img height=""191"" alt="""" width=""320"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ibis_news/pic/0000arhb/s320x240"" /></a><br />Sort of a nice piece I think. Signed on the foot in underglaze blue, but I'll need to consult the members of the Gotheborg forum if I hope to get a translation. <br /><br />Also, I've been thinking more about timberframing and the like. <br />Somewhat frustratingly, my business cards and stamp still aren't ready. I'll have to call again tomorrow."

"event","So I'm not making so many knives right now. Jesse has reached a point where he needs a more professional dedicated shop building on his property. Thats a major goal of his for now, and I'm very excited to be helping to realize it.&nbsp; It's pretty great, because I'm being introduced to traditional building methods and tools and other fun stuff.&nbsp; I'm helping to: fell trees, bark them, split them, turn them into timbers and lumber , and eventually carve joints into them and put them all together.&nbsp;  <br /><br />I came across a neat method of setting foundations. A company called Pin Foundations makes these concrete things that sit on the ground, to which you can anchor timbers to. Pipes are drived through it into the ground, at an angle, and they serve to hold everything down. <br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ibis_news/pic/00005ztk/""><img width=""200"" height=""227"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ibis_news/pic/00005ztk"" alt="""" /></a><br />They look like this. Imagine that darker grey band represents ground level. <br /><br />With the mold-making skills I gathered from working at FSU's Master Craftsman Program, I'm sure it would be pretty easy to build some molds to make some similar things. <br />But we are still working on site preparation! Its amazing how persistent grape vines can be.&nbsp; I would never have guessed how difficult it could be to clear a 40' x 60' or so area. <br /><br />Today, one of the interesting things we did was cut a cat-face. Around the turn of the last century, throughout the region turpentiners catfaced pine trees to collect the sap. As you might guess, this resin was processed into turpentine and sold nationwide. We are doing exactly what they did, but instead of making turpentine, we'll be making varnishes, sealants, glues, and other things. These are cat-faces:<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ibis_news/pic/00006x1f/""><img width=""320"" height=""204"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ibis_news/pic/00006x1f/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ibis_news/pic/00007xk5/""><img width=""181"" height=""240"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ibis_news/pic/00007xk5/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br />Oh, and here is a little Chinese piece I found:<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ibis_news/pic/00008g5z/""><img width=""320"" height=""236"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ibis_news/pic/00008g5z/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br />Its a cute little sancai (three colors) biscuit glazed brush washer or something similar. About 3 inches across. Nice colors. Circa 1890 I should think. <br />I think I need to make a little polishing station in my place. Many of the blades that come in would sell for more if I could polish and etch them to some extent. Something to think about"

"event","I wanted to post a photograph of an ornamental iron project I did some months ago. I've very little experience forging this type of thing, and the project turned out pretty well for such a rookie attempt. Below is one of four pairs, each is about 10"" inches tall and the handle is twisted 3/4"" inch square stock. It took me forever to snap a few pics of these.<br />&nbsp;<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ibis_news/pic/00002r6w/""><img width=""222"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ibis_news/pic/00002r6w/s320x240"" /></a><br />Since I am posting old work, here is a photograph of a Japanese style tanto blade I made. The shape was made famous by one of Japan's early and very famous smiths, Masamune. It came out alright, but after I polished it up I discovered two tiny cracks that had formed during the water-quenching process. It's been laying around since I discovered those, but I think I'll cut it up and make a smaller knife out of it.&nbsp; Oh, in its current state, I suppose its about 11"" inches long. <br /><br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ibis_news/pic/0000492k/""><img width=""320"" height=""57"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ibis_news/pic/0000492k/s320x240"" /></a>"

"event","Well, I've just reopened my antiques business after a hiatus of two years, during which I've more or less been focused on learning bladesmithing skills and techniques from a really talented full time maker living here in north fla. <br />Its been a little stressful getting back into the swing of things, and I'm not completely there yet. For now my plan is to sell on ebay, with the possibility of moving to an online catalogue. A model I admire is that of Artzi, a dealer in Israel, at www.oriental-arms.com <br />Initially when getting back into this, my biggest fear was ""How am I going to keep up a steady flow of inventory?""&nbsp; For the past month I've been testing different methods, and while I enjoy traveling to different shows searching for items, my best luck has been with purchasing goods online. Things that people know less about than I do, and so they don't market them properly to reach the correct demographic. When I can intuit how someone might poorly advertise a good item, either because they don't know or because their knowledge is flawed or incomplete, I'll buy that item and in turn correctly advertise it to the people who want it the most. <br />My business cards read that I specialize in ""antiques, oriental art, and edged weapons.""&nbsp; Since this is in large part a game of knowledge, I can only confidently work with the things I know the most about. So far, that translates to Asian porcelains and historical swords and related weapons. It is in the latter of these two areas that I'm getting interested in doing limited specialized conservation and restoration work.&nbsp;  <br />I hope to here post pictures of some of the antiques I'm working with. <br /><br />I've been learning to make knives from Jesse Frank, an immensely talented and generous artist, bladesmith, teacher, and friend whose focus since before I met him has been early Scandinavian styled blades based on historical examples. When I first met him I hadn't even used an angle grinder and the idea of making swords for a living seemed like a lovely fantasy.&nbsp; It's been two years since then, and in that time my knowledge of tools and techniques has grown immensely. Making swords for a living is no longer a fantasy, but a very real path. A difficult path that few will take, but more rewarding and truth revealing than any other I've been exposed to.&nbsp; <br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ibis_news/pic/00001042/""><img width=""320"" height=""233"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ibis_news/pic/00001042/s320x240"" /></a><br />Here is a piece I just picked up. Chinese porcelain hat ornament with five-clawed dragon. Well modeled and levigated porcelainous body glazed to resemble jade. Only three inches long. Compare with a 19th century ruyi scepter similar in decoration and glaze sold at Sotheby's NY, March 19th 1997, lot #292 in the sale ""Fine Chinese Ceramics, Furniture, and Works of Art"" <br />As a side note I paid less than $20 for this piece. It was apparently collected by a traveling missionary nun in the early part of the previous century."

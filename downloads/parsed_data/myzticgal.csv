<H1 align=center><FONT size=3>To A Friend</FONT></H1><PRE><CENTER>
<FONT color=#cc66cc>To a friend. 
One who was always at my side. 
A friend who never left me alone, 
Someone, in which I trust to confide. 

You held my hurt, 
I always came first. 
You stood at my side, 
Even at my worst. 

You opened your arms 
Although I usually refused 
But u left them open 
For me to run to. 

5 years of happiness, 
A friendship so strong 
We'd still be friends, 
Even if something did go wrong. 

You offered me a shoulder 
For me to lean and cry 
You never turned your back 
Never said good-bye. 

If I needed you, 
I know you would run. 
If you were a million miles away, 
I no you'd find a way to come. 

You never asked me for help, 
But realize I am always there. 
Never forget, 
That I will never seize to care. 

If you feel one ounce of hurt, 
Or a shutter or pain 
I'll open my arms 
And do my best to shelter the rain, 

I am there if u need me, 
I'll never leave u alone, 
You may never ask, 
But I want to make it known. 

Know that I may not understand, 
That I may never get it just right 
But I am always there 
Helping you, with a shinning light. 

Today is your day, 
A time to reminisce. 
If we ever separate 
Your qualities I will miss. 

Never forget to laugh, 
To grace me with your smile 
Always remember to cry 
Sometimes, just for a lil' while. 

I have no other things to say, 
No words can describe wat u mean to me. 
But make it so it known. 
And always be happy.

There are apt to be flashes of genius coming your way today, gabriela, so stay alert. Take advantage of opportunities when they come to you. Don't get held back by old thought patterns that are still lingering in your brain. The problem is that you may be operating according to plans you made with people a long time ago. For fear of hurting their feelings, you may have continued down this path even though it may not be the best for you. Consider taking a different route."

I saw ""Factory Girl"" last night.  Parts of it were filmed in Shreveport, but I really wanted to see it after learning about the Pop Art movement and Andy Warhol in my Foundations of Modern Art class last semester.  I thought Guy Pearce as Andy Warhol was simply a hoot.  He had the quirky artist down to a tee.  Sienna Miller was pretty good as the title character, Edie Sedgwick.  The film was kinda graphic; lots and lots and LOTS of drug use, AND Sienna Miller is either nude or partially nude for at least a third of the entire film.  Overall, it wasn't half as bad as people/critics made it out to be.  I rather liked it.  But then again, I'm really into Warhol and Pop Art and I've seen the infamous ""Superstar"" documentary about Warhol.

Enough about movies and art.  I'm going to Greece in May.  I need a tan.  Oh yeah, and I'm going to Hawaii in July.  Woohoo.

The year and a half I've worked here at the store, I've come really really close to getting caught being delinquint at work, but I've never actually gotten caught before.  At least my boss is out of town and it was one of the other old ladies.

She scared the mess out of me.  And at least she didn't catch me reading.  That's right, I brought a book to work with me, one which I finished reading like ten minutes ago, and then I was going to get online for a sec before filing the last few claims and leaving at 5 pm.  So I'm scanning over LJ, peering close to the screen to read, when I hear a voice.  I don't know how she made it all the way down the stairs without me ever hearing her.  She must have been in stealth mode.  So I nonchalantly sit back in my chair and minimize the window, but not too fast, because that looks even more suspicious.  Then I looked at her and she was staring at the screen, looking confused and she was mumbling something.  So I asked her when the boss would be back in town and blah blah blah and was remarking about the problems I had with a few previous claims.  She proceeded to the bathroom (the whole reason she had come downstairs) then made some comment about how I was almost finished with those and should she do something that I have no clue what she was talking about, hehe...

Oh well, it could have been worse.  I'm sure she won't think much of it.  It was just LJ.  Not like I was watching David Firth flash videos (not that I could since the sound on this computer doesn't work).

I'm going to have to keep a better ear out from now on...geez...I can't believe I didn't even hear her...I'm sure she's just going to think I'm down here goofing off all the time...oh well, at least I cover my tracks well...

I bought a bunch of new clothes/shoes/accessories at the various malls we visited while in the West.  I also got to see the Anasazi cliff dwellings at Manitou Springs (they are pretty cool, but don't compare to the HUGE ones at Mesa Verde), Indian dances, visit this awesome music shop downtown, eat Thai food, and go rock climbing in Cheyenne Canyon.  Oh, that's why both of my knees are terribly bruised.  Apparently, you aren't supposed to use your knees to climb up the side of a mountain, but rather your hands and feet.  Oh well, I did manage to scale the 120-ft. route all the way to the top, though, and my older sister (the rock climber) was very impressed.

And so I've spent the past two days in the van with my insane grandmother, my martyr-syndrome mother, and hacking-coughing younger sister, driving through middle-of-nowhere Colorado, then middle-of-nowhere New Mexico, then middle-of-nowhere Texas.  Fun times, let me tell you.

My professor I work for in lab told me Thursday that I have to right a report about what I've accomplished this summer in lab.

I find it quite amusing that my older rather tom-boyish sister loves the movie ""Tristan & Isolde.""  I am not <i> surprised </i> by that fact though, seeing as some of her favorite movies include the Harrison Ford-remake of ""Sabrina,"" as well as ""Notting Hill"" and ""City of Angels.""

I really like working out, just not the middle-aged people I see at the Fitness Center at Centenary all the time who stare at me.  I don't know why they are there, it is a college's gym, and I know they aren't professors...at least not full-time professors...

I think I'm about to pass out,
Emily"

Yeah, it's scabby and it looks painful, but it surprisingly didn't hurt that bad.  I got it done at Moderne Primitives and it was mostly painless.  Megan and Jennifer came with me to give me moral support.  And so there goes another year of college...I'm a junior now, and that's odd...slightly...

I'm exhausted...I need to just sleep for 24 hours straight, methinketh...

I went and saw ""Mission: Impossible III"" last night with Megan and Jennifer.  Besides the fact that Tom Cruise is insane and annoying in real life, the movie was freakin' sweet.  Phillip Seymour Hofman was an excellent bad guy...and lotsa stuff got blown up...

Anyway, that's it for now..."

"event","So I got four hours of sleep last night...and then took a three-hour-long Analytical Chemistry final exam...but you know what, folks?  It's over, it's done, it's through!  At least for now...

So what should I do with my summer...?

Too bad, it's already been decided: working five days a week, two days in the lab and three at the store; volunteering on Saturday mornings; and two brief vacations.  One is a survey of the mid-west (Nashville, Indianapolis, ending up in Bloomington, Illinois...we're JUST missing Ohio, hehe...), and the other is Anaheim, California, YAY!  It'll be my first time there that wasn't in an airport!

In other news, I'm going rollerskating tonight, YAY!  I hope I don't bust it...

Artic Freezes are far inferior to ICEEs...but they are still cold and sweet...and my lips are bright red now...

Perhaps there will be digicam pics later, perhaps...

Until then,

I could barely make it to school this morning, I kept nodding off at the wheel.  It was seriously frightening and very un-safe.  It was definitely the drowsiest I've been in a LONG time.  I sat outside the biology classroom and tried to read over my notes, but I kept finding my head against my chest and my eyes closed.  I don't know what's wrong with me...

Two days of class left, two! (We don't have class Friday.)  That's both exciting and terrifying.  

I want to do something major to commemorate the end of my second year of college...Last year I got my ears pierced (my 11th and 12th holes).  What should I do this year, my 13th and 14th?  Anyway...

My Bloody Valentine has been good to me lately...I dunno, I've started listening to more ""shoegazer"" type bands, including an awesome Japanese one called Plastic Tree (I can't wait for the album I ordered to come in!).  I've been in more mellow-out moods as of late, maybe that's why I'm so sleepy...or it could be that I don't get enough protein...hmmm...

I still smell like waffle cones.  We went to Coldstone at the Boardwalk tonight, but I didn't get anything.  The smell lingers, however...mmm...

Goodnight, my little cat, goodnight..."

"event","I started my day yesterday by waking up feeling like I'd been run-over by a semi...Maybe that's because I haven't gotten enough sleep for the last couple of nights, or the fact that I worked-out like a maniac Friday afternoon, or maybe it was the running across the open fields...I don't know.  Anyway, I was late to the clinic, but it was still good.  I actually got trained to draw blood, and I didn't have any problem with the needle or anything.  

If you didn't know, I'm extremely scared of needles, but only when they are sticking me...I'm usually okay when it's other people getting stuck.

I came home after that and ate a quick lunch (it took FOREVER for my rice to cook, even in a rice cooker!), then I went to the AED crawfish boil at one of my professor's houses.  I met Megan C. there, but she was in a poo-poo mood at first, being extrememly anti-social (did you know that crossing your arms closes you off from other people?).  So I just smiled and talked to whomever, even if I didn't really know them, and was generally pleasant and had a good time.  After a while Megan got better.  At first it was awkward sitting around not eating anything while everyone else was chowing-down on tray after tray of crawfish, but it was still good.  

I had to try some beer that the microbiology class made in their lab this semester (Megan is in that class).  They made two kinds, some dark Scottish ale and soome other sweet kind.  The Scottish ale was really really bitter.  I'm not a big beer fan anyway, and I didn't drink too much, since I was driving later.  AFter that I stayed and helped clean up, then left at about 5:45 pm.

I went to Books-A-Million to kill time and ended up buying three more volumes of manga.  I then met my dad at the CenturyTel center for the Mudbugs hockey game.  It's been about six years since I've been to a hockey game, but it was fun.  My little sister and some her friends were there with us too.  We ate tons of cotton candy and I had a HUGE coke.  I was bouncing off the walls by the time we all left.  

When I came home I attempted to read all three volumes of manga that I bought, but halfway through the last volume (about 11:18 pm), I just couldn't read anymore.  So I went to sleep.  I was rudely awoken at 9 am by the phone ringing, so here I am typing this post, and even though I finally got plenty of sleep last night, I feel SO tired...see you cool cats later...

"event","I received my federal tax refund in the mail yesterday (I hope I get my state one soon).  And so today, since A-chem lab was cancelled (or at least <i>I</i> didn't have to go), I went and deposited the check and went to the mall and bought manga.  I haven't had the funds to buy manga since December, which is a sad, sad fact.  Sure, a lot of the series I read I don't even purchase, or aren't out in America yet, but still, there's something about owning a continually-growing collection of manga...I like having all the volumes of my favorite series.

And so I bought <i>Hana-Kimi</i> volumes 10 & 11, as well as <i>Fruits Basket</i> vol. 13 (which I have already read online, but still, it's such a good series, I had to buy it).  I don't know, I'm just in a shoujo-romantic-comedy mood today.  So I am sitting here at work, having smuggled the comics in in my over-sized purse, trying to read them without getting caught.  So far, I have succeeded.  But I really <i>should</i> be working.

Tomorrow is the Honors Convocation.  I won the Analytical Chemistry award, so I get to go, along with my parents.  YAY.  Not really...I mean, yeah, it's great an' all that I won the award, but still, sitting in Brown Chapel for two hours is going to be BOR-ing!  But luckily I'll still be able to attend Metro afterwards.  I think I'm going to convince my parents to take me to the new Asian resturaunt on the Boardwalk Friday night to celebrate.  They probably have stuff there I can eat.

And so ends another highly fascinating post by yours truly.  I have my last Organic chem test tomorrow.  Wish me luck!

I went to Hot Topic earlier and bought an air freshener for my new car (which I will be picking up tomorrow after Organic lab, YAY!) and a bunch of new pins.  They are fun.  One says ""You looked better on Myspace.""  That makes me smile.  I'm wearing my yellow ""I heart robots"" pin on my sweater right now, hehe, and that makes me smile even more...

Another pin says ""If you can't find anything nice to say about anyone...come sit next to me.""  Hehe...

Anyway, I went to the Nine Inch Nails concert on Saturday.  Other than the blatant (and somewhat gross) anti-war display, and all the crazies, it was good.  Too bad they let those delinquints smoke in the Century Tel Center, though.  By the time I got home at 2 am, I could barely swallow because my throat was so swollen.  It hurt.  It still hurts a little today, but it's much better...

I think I'm going to pick it up Tuesday, and my white Mitsubishi Galant will be handed down to Millicent.

In other news, I have decided that I'm going to try my best to become Vegan.  It's not for some hoity-toity policital or social or moral reason...it's because I want to eat healthier...now I have an excuse not to eat ""junk"" food.  Today, so far, I've had a banana, an orange, some rice, and green beans.  I think I'm going to head up to Target later (they have a pretty sweet Organic Foods aisle, I hear) and buy some  soy milk, tofu, and some other stuff, maybe...anyone wanna come with...?

What did they used to say about the dent on your upper lip..?  Wasn't it where God or an angel or your mother put her thumb print or something or other?

I always thought scars were supposed to be white and livid, not the demure pink that laces my forearm (both forearms, perhaps; only time will tell on the one).  I guess it depends on the wound.  I have white scars other places, and some that have no color but that of skin, their only distinguishing factor an indention; and other scars are not to be seen at all.  They are not a sign of healing of my physical self at all, but perhaps those other wounds haven't quite scarred yet, as they have not fully healed...

I like days like today, when all the world seems right and seven hours of sound sleep is just enough that I have not been tired once today.

"event","Direct quote from my Analytical Chemistry textbook:
""We make certain that we have as many equations as unknowns and then set about to solve for the concentration of each species, using algebra, approximations, magic, or anything else...""

I just thought the mention of magic was pretty funny coming from a scientific text. But basically it's like that; you just write chemical equations and equilibria and mass balance and charge balance and throw them altogether and hope the right answer pops out.  I think I did well on my Analytical test today, but that's always a bad sign.  It's usually when I think I did poorly that I do super awesome...we'll see how it goes.

Megan and I went and saw ""The New World"" tonight (I'm really sorry Alex, I am...).  It was amazing.  It was simple and beautiful and moving and all those other cliches that are used to describe those kind of movies.  I know I loved it.  The guy sitting in the row in front of us didn't.  He stretched like he'd just woken up from a nap and said something like, ""Wow...that was a really bad movie...""  I thought his comment was kind of funny, but I enjoyed the movie very much.  This crappy LJ post can't even do it justice...

I was weirded out when I came in just a minute ago since there was ""A Nightmare Before Christmas"" rented from Blockbuster.  My dad usually rents movies around here, but he WOULD NOT rent that movie...I don't think my little sister would either (nothing against that movie, it's just not something I would think they would rent).  Plus my toilet seat was raised, as if a guy had used my bathroom while I was gone.  It could have been my dad, but I don't think (once again) that he would be watching ""A Nightmare Before Christmas"" on the big screen downstairs...it's just odd...

My toes are FROZEN!  And I wanted to come in and chill and watch some FMA, but no, Megan had to sit and talk to me for TWO HOURS after the movie was over...goodnight."

"event","Well, folks, the ever-dreaded V-day is almost upon us....man, I sound like some woefully single person who throws all their self-worth into whether or not they are in a relationship.  My bad...

Anyway, it is that time of year when people will spend about $14 billion dollars on roses and chocolates and jewelry to signify what they think of as love.  I have a newsflash for you people: God is love.  All of these fleeting thoughts and emotions that you are so willing to fling around like some kind of greeting, those are probably NOT love...I don't think people know what love is anymore.  Can't you tell I'm skeptical when it comes to this subject?

The truth is, there are many forms of love, each one special and unique (now I sound like some cliche self-esteem counselor) in it's own way.  Romantic love is not the greatest of these, and I'm glad it's not.  I'd much rather have unconditional, do-all-the-bad-things-you-want-but-I-still-love-you-because-I'm-just-that-awesome-and-powerful kind of love high on my list.  You'd better hope for it too, because even if you don't believe in it, it's there, I assure you.  That's just how awesome it all is.

Some famous poet once rambled on about how you don't really need to know what love is to write poetry about it.  That is very ironic, but I see how it can be true.  So I leave you with a crappy poem I wrote a few years ago (it must at least be three years ago now):

Song I: ""My Love Never Ceases to Flow""

Nothing could ever hinder my love for you,
Not the thousand leagues that separate us,
Not even Death's icy grip.
Were you to forsake my love
I would pine away for you.
If you were to return my love,
I would rejoice in you all my days.
My love for you unites us,
Though distance still remains.

You, my love, have said,
""Yet, while the world remains will I love you.""
And I am glad in that.
For I have said, ""Even when the world is no longer,
I will love you.""
Let us find ourselves together once more.
Let our paths meet in the midst of our love.
Those who look upon us should say,
""What an everlasting love they have.""

Many loves have never been as great as this one.
My love is poured out for you as water from a jar.
My love never ceases to flow.
It is as a swift stream,
And a lazily moving river.
A never-quenching rain it is,
And an eternal wellspring.
Forget the words from my lips and remember only this:
My love for you could never be enough; but somehow, it is.

"event","The fact that he's gay doesn't annoy me.  The fact that his face reminds me of a rat that got stomped on doesn't annoy me.  What DOES annoy me is the fact that he's TERRIBLY, EXTREMELY rude.

Okay, so I know that we are all rude at some point, and that my perceiving something as rude is my opinion, and someone else may take that same thing and see no rudeness at all.  I know for a fact that I can be quite rude, or at least come across to others as rude.  But that is generally saved for people I know who know me well enough to not be offended, or only offended a little.  My classmates that I don't know too well, or people that I come into contact each day that I am only slightly acquainted with--I would never be rude in front of those people or to those people if I could help it.  I try to be nice to those people without seeming ""fake.""

But this guy, he's in most of my classes since I think he's a chem major too, and a sophomore at that.  He's rude to the professors and rude to his classmates, yet he has tons of friends.  Maybe rudeness DOES get you somewhere in life.  

Anyway, today after Analytical, I went to my professor's office to get some help on a couple of homework problems that I was struggling with.  He was more than happy to help me and encouraged everyone in the class to come and talk to him before our test on Wednesday.  The annoying guy supposedly had somewhere to be, but about 5 minutes after I sat down to talk with the professor, the annoying guy is standing outside his door, blocking the little hallway that leads to all the chem professors' offices.  I ignore him until about 15 minutes later someone else comes and asks him if he's waiting to see the professor.  He then proceeds to say, ""yeah, get in line,"" in an exasperated tone.  By this time he's now sitting, his legs blocking the whole hallway.

Finally I ask my professor about the last problem, and in the middle of him trying to describe how to work it, the annoying guy asks, ""When's your next class?"" in this haughty tone.  The professor looks up from his notes and says, ""who, me?"" And the annoying guy says, ""No, HER..."" in the rudest tone I've ever heard.  He doesn't even know my name and yet he'll be rude to me.  How sweet.  So I didn't even look at him when I replied, ""well, I was supposed to be at work at noon, and it's now 12:30...so yeah...""  I tried to NOT match his tone of voice, I tried to sound as nice as I could with my face beet-red from anger and embarrasment.  So I packed my things up quickly and thanked my professor and left.

By the time that I waved a quick ""hello"" to Ben (BCM leader at Centenary) from across the parking lot in front of the cafeteria on my trek across campus to where I parked this morning for Latin, my cheeks were only red from the cold and from walking briskly.  

I just had to rant and get over it because I forgot my cellphone this morning and couldn't call Megan to sympathize.  She had a heated arguement with the annoying guy last semester at a Gen. Chem. tutoring session.  He was trying to help her with a problem (since he's the tutor), and was arguing that her answer was wrong, when in fact it was correct.

I hope this post does not reflect poorly on my character..."

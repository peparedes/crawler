This is going to be an angry post. Actually fuck it. I need to do something else. I need to get this out, this evil energy. The way it comes up like vomit every time I see him say something about her. FUCK HER. FUCK HIM. FUCK OHIO. FUCK EVERYTHING. It was my one chance at something, anything. And now its like G-d is rubbing it in my face. ""Look, guys will have sex with you, but no one actually cares about you. See, they never even call back. You're that horrid.""

It isn't G-ds fault. It's his fault. So why am I the only one suffering?

Fuck you life. I need something to do, I feel that familiar feeling again, and it's not going away. No matter how many letters, how many sentences, I can't appease it.

I'm going to take a book to the highest place in this building, and I'm going to make it all better, or at least less painful.

I don't even know what less painful is right now, because I don't know what happy is. Is it the mask I put on, or is it knowing about the mask? Hasn't anyone written a book on this kind of stuff? These are the answers we need. Not how to do calculus, or how to brew beer. How to LIVE. Hell, I'd read it. Maybe, some day, I'll write it."

"event","It's like I fuck everything up, either by waiting when I shouldn't, or acting when I shouldn't. Fuck. I'm a little iffy right now, and I've been drunk the past three nights. I'm high as fuck, smoked with Tarek and Emma. Reid, Dustin and Savannah went to a party. Dustin likes Kelly, Dustin likes Savannah. I'm too forward? Guys don't like anything that comes to them naturally. If it's too easy, its no good. But I don't want to fight. I just want to be. I want to love, I want to kiss. I want to have fun.

I'm going to write without seeing the kesy. See what happens., the words are most likely mixed, but I want to  see. I need a way to get down to the bottom of this. To the bottom of everything. Is it that girl? teh bicke girl? Does it originate there? I don't know. ITs just a strong memory. Some of them are and some aren't. I don't eve nkow. I just want to be happy...

I feel like I'm going insane.  More and more I look aroun d and see the world. And I wonder, what is this? None of this is real. 

And it shakes, and it flounders. And eventually, my mind believes that nothing is real. If nothing is real, what am I? Nothing? If I am the only thing that is real, and nothing is real, then I am nothing. But I am more of a nothing than everything else.

""Absence cannot occupy, so there can be no such thing as nothing.""

There are so many possibilities. It doesn't take a lot to make me happy, I just want someone. Maybe it's not fair, but it's the truth.

Tarek is sitting behing me, watching a movie. The Talented Mr. Ripley. I've wanted to see it, but I'm high, and I'm terrified. What's going to happen...the fucked up thing is that I know. The same thing that always happens is going to happen again. I don't know how to go about getting guys, because as soon as I get them, they lose interest. Why was Eric different? He was the only person who really KNEW me, and still liked me. Maybe he only thought he liked me. Maybe he only thought he knew me.

I don't even know me. There are things that I've never told anyone. I want to jump. I want to tell everyone that. I want you to know that I'm afraid of it. I want to tell how it feels so intense. Like I need to. Like something is telling me too. Like there's some voice in my head saying, jump. Jump. Jump. Don't think about what's at the bottom. Those rocks are three seconds away. Three seconds of freedom. And I know, I just know, I'm not looking for the long term peace. I mean, its a thought, but no. I just want that three seconds. That three seconds of total and complete freedom. I can almost feel it. Everytime I come near a cliff. Every time I look out a window. Every time I stand on a roof. Free falling. Like the song. It makes me sick to write about. I say these things, and my stomach churns, trying to fight the knowing. It would rather that I didn't know. It makes me sick to know. But I do, so I'm sick. I know it know. I know what the view looks like from the window. I remember the cliff on Ocean Beach. I remember the waterfall in New York. I remember the warning sicks, and I remember the stomach churns. I feel sick, I feel sick, I feel sick.

I forgot that people read this. Fuck. But you know what, I'm not going tto change anything. I'm not going to delete it, and I'm not going to edit. It is what it is.

I need to talk to someone. I need to talk to someone who can tell me why I'm like this. I need to know WHY. It's driving me insane. Literally. I can feel myself slip into lapses. And I know, some day it will not feel odd. Some day it will feel normal, and then I will be insane. But my then it will be too late. I will be beyond help. So in the meantime, what do I do? Everything I do to learn backfires. Gettting stupid. Smoking, drinking, it makes me feel better. I was the only one who drank tonight. I made my own mixed drink. It's not because I have a drinkking problem, it's because I have an emotional problem. Is it working, the Prozac? I have so much doubt. Is it a placebo that I have committed to, or is it working and I'm doubting the effects.

What the fuck is wrong with me. That's what it comes down to. That's what it came down to yesterday, and that's what it will come down to tomorrow. what the fuck is wrong with me? It's a question. Who can answer. I put myself out there as the easy girl, the funny girl, the pushy girl. But that's what I am. Is it better to pretend to be someone I'm not, or to be who I am, and fuck whoever doesn't like it? Obviously, I should say b, but a is just so much more appetizing. I don't care that Dusty doesn't know I take Prozac. It has such a connotation...I don't want people to know I was depressed. Was? Am? I don't know anymore. Is it better now? Yes. Is it at the same level as everyone else? I just dont' know. I wish I could have one day sitting, observing someone else's thoughts. No intervention, just observation. 24 hours. One person. Just to get an inkling of where I am on the map. I honestly have no idea.

If he's drunk, he kissed her. I know that right now. And I know that he went to a party, so I know he's drunk. So, I know what happened. Why am I still freaking out? Why do I LIKE him anyway. I've only even known him about three days...? Something like that. He's just so cute, and funny, and nice...fuck boys and their deception.

He said he liked me.

I guess he likes her better, that's all.

I don't even want to think about it anymore, but it's really the only thing I care about. It sounds so cliche but it's true. I can work anywhere, I can live anywhere. I can make friends, or not. The only thing I want in life is someone to like me more than anyone else. Again, I ask, again, I plead for an answer.

IS THAT SO MUCH TO ASK?"

"event","One could say that I haven't updated in a while. One would be relatively correct, unless one considers lists to be an update, in which case one would be completely incorrect.

However, if one is now excited about the prospect of a real update, one should give up those hopes immediately. And I should stop talking as if I were insane.

This week has been rather relaxing. Read carefully, that said relaxing, not depressing. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is my step of the week towards happiness. I'm actually okay with the fact that life is a little slow right now. I'm spending some time with the family, doing some packing, seeing friends occassionally, and making progress in The Fountainhead. I really hope to be done with it by Saturday.

It is, without a doubt, my favorite book to date. Though not a book for everyone, it would be amazing to anyone who can REALLY relate. Not the bullshit ""Oh, I totally get this book, it's, like, the story of my life"" relation, but a real heartfelt understanding.

Its so easy to get caught up in all this superficial, live in the moment, technology. AIM takes us away from what we are - words, thoughts, soul. It takes us away from living, turns us into finger motivated zombies. I'm just suprised we haven't yet heard of someone dying because they forgot to eat. I understand programmers. Dorks, nerds, whatever. They scheme, and they plot, trying to solve a riddle that I am modest enough to say I probably will never understand. And that's the beauty of it. Those programmers understand something which is sacred simply because there is one person who cannot comprehend it. I think we would live in a different world if more people realized that they had this unique understanding. It really is an amazing revelation, to realize the power of thought. To be able to reach a conclusion faster or more concisely than one single other person, and to be able to do so without bringing him down. That, my friends, is the revelation.

Egotistical, yes. Pompous, completely. But untrue? Unfair? If those were your descriptive adjectives, I daresay you're a hypocrite, or at the very least, very ignorant of yourself.

That is the curse of intelligence. To be painfully aware of oneself. And yet, only some of the brilliant find themselves plagued by this curse, others do not seem so dehabilitated. Are there simply good actors and bad actors? Or is there more than that in the chaos of the world. Is there a rhyme, a reason too intricate for us to understand? Why is it that, if given the chance, I would take a pick axe to my brain, and others would simply admire?

What am I so afraid of?

Of failure? Obviously, but it seems so cliche. Seems to simple to be the answer. I don't excell because I am afraid of what will happen if it turns out I CAN'T excell. I would rather blame myself for knowing that I didn't try than blame myself for not being good enough.

It's true, it's all true, it's just not the whole truth. I'm realizing that the whole truth is a lifetime away. There are clues, jigsaw pieces in every person I meet, in every painting I admire. Every hill I climb brings me closer to my goal, and every time I stumble I am better able to explain why I let myself fall.

I can only hope that I find the last piece while I still have time to enjoy the view.

I realized something amusing about Nick. Everything he says, everything he does, is scripted. He reads ""non-fiction"" books, and spews the ""facts"" that he learned. All the bullshit he gave me about natural cures? It's an infomercial. He saw an infomercial, and latched onto what he saw as the conspiracy story of the year.

And that was how I realized that Nick is the conservative version of the liberals that I hate. I guess I just didn't know enough politics to see it at first. But he is that same unquestioning, mind-numbingly loyal Republican.

Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs. However, I don't feel that I need to give people permission to try to force other beliefs upon me. I am more than willing to hear what YOU have to say.

You know you're a stoner when...

You open the cabinet and wonder why the refridgerator light didn't go on.
You lose something, and then the next time you smoke, you remember where you put it.
You go to Chipotle, after dinner.
You've dealt, and known everyone else who has too.
You stare at a tree for hours.
You smoke BEFORE you drink. Gotta have priorities.
You have stoner-dar.
You look at vegetables, and see various clumps of weed.
You buy a scale that cannot logically be used for anything other than drugs.
You know of ways to hide things in ordinary items.
You automatically assume when your friend says he's growing ""tomato plants.""
In fact, you've thought about growing weed yourself.
You get, or think about getting, a club card.
Candy no longer is simply a child's treat.
You drive high, even though your arms feel detached from your body.
You fall asleep in, literally, two seconds. Standing up.
You can't turn down a smoke-out. No matter how high you already are.
You have smoked out of a gravity bong, a bubbler, a regular bong, a vaporizer, a chamber pipe, a zig zag, a blunt rap, and more, and you can order the effects from least to most.
You try to make your own bong.

Haha. Not a finished project, so if you are going to steal it, DON'T DO IT YET. Muchas gracias. I will let you know, adoring fans, when you can rip me off for all that I'm worth.

On another note, I'm going to be famous. I never thought I would, and I never wanted to be. But I think I will. Rich, I don't know. But people will know me. It is a premonition. Now, back to the artichoke dip.

""So, what year are you?"" he asked me.

I'm going to be a freshman. I launched into my explanation - boring summer, extra credits, etc. He saved me by interrupting as I was drifting off.

""Good book,"" he said, glancing at my copy of The Fountainhead. I agreed, but didn't want to give him the satisfaction of winning. Eh, I shrugged my shoulders.

We ate in silence, with the question reverberating in my head, why did he sit here? Forever later, I asked him.

""Why not?"" he said simply, and the glint in his eyes showed an innocent playfulness, which I allowed him. Suddenly it struck me, he was drunk. Well, maybe not drunk, but certainly intoxicated.

Something inside me cringed; I wanted to kiss him. I wanted to suck the poison from his lips, to share that beautiful non-existence. But I, the sober one, was too shy. And he, even drunk, was too polite. Or too cold. Either way, he was too much. Looking into those glassy eyes quickly became too much - I needed out.

""See ya around,"" I said to the nameless boy, leaving behind my half eaten sandwich, and barely cracked copy of the The Fountainhead."

Because, let me tell you, I do.

I just started reading the Fountainhead, and I love it. The imagery, the syntax...it's so beautiful. Ayn Rand, thank you for pouring your soul into this work, it has made it all the richer. I read, reveling in the attention to detail, feeling Rand's freedom from reality as she describes Katie's skirt.

They really are amazing things, these letters we've made, taught to computers, adapted to our life. We have created meaning out of senselessness, order out of chaos. How often do we stop to think about that? There are people who will never understand what I have just done. To them, this means nothing. The words I have chosen have no magic, the commas denote no pause, the periods are nothing more than smudges on the paper. I wonder, do you just adopt different hobbies? What if there is someone like me, out there, desperate to release everything, but he doesn't know how. If you have never learned language, can you feel the pain of its absence?

I was helping Ean read today, and it was such an amazing experience. I know not everyone wants or needs to read and write, but it just kills me to think, what if there's someone like me. What if they just don't know?

Anyway, I think being sleep stoned brings out the philosopher in me, which, I fear, will only be encouraged by my Philosophy class, which I am psyched about.

Well, cruel world, you've done your work. The night tugs on my eyelids, and my psyche is easily defeated. I shall delve a little deeper into The Fountainhead, and then, I will go quietly where the night shall lead.

"event","It was just another night in paradise, he thought scathingly. Sitting on the dock, he imagined that she was next to him. If he opened his eyes, he would see her, and yet he was afraid to reach out his hand to find that she really wasn't there. His girlfriend had begun wondering where he was hours ago, he was sure, but there was no cell service anyway. Besides, she wouldn't understand. He hadn't told her about Melissa.

The way her strawberry blond hair fell on her pale skin, the way she laughed at nothing at all, the way her tears formed perfect droplets, the way he watched her take her last breath, helpless to stop the inevitable.

When he had pulled her limp body from the waves, he didn't think it would end like it did. The rock was sharp, and she was bleeding a little from her forehead, but it didn't look too serious. He loved her more with every step he took on that beach, with every dune he climbed over, with every street he crossed to get to the small hut that passed for the village's emergency medical center. After all, the town was known for its waves, not its doctors.

""Love prevails,"" he thought, ""always."" He hummed Bluebird in her ear, and desperately watched her eyelashes for any sign of life. When he reached the medical center, however, his heart was beating faster than ever. Panicked, he started shouting toward the hut.

""Please, G-d, help me, she's going to die,"" he yelled to no one. After what seemed like years, he fell through the door, exhausted despite the adrenaline flowing through his system. Frantically looking around, he realized he was alone with her. He lay her down on the only bed in the room, looking for a phone, a note, anything that could direct him to someone who could help.

A gurgling noise redirected his attention as Melissa coughed up water onto herself, with eyes closed. He ran to her, hoping she had awoken, and finding instead only faint breathing. The hour long ordeal had taken its toll on the young boy, and he was sobbing as he picked her up, hoping he was strong enough to carry her to help. As he grasped her, he was startled by a sharp intake of breath, followed by...silence.

""No!"" he screamed, hitting her in the chest. Cursing himself for not taking CPR, he tried to breathe air into her, while pushing down on her chest. He knew he was failing, and he could no longer feel her pulse when he laid his head to her chest. Still fighting through tears, he picked her up and ran into the cold afternoon air.

Sprinting down the beach, he headed to the only place he could think of - home. His mother was a lawyer, she would know what to do, she would fix it. When they found the couple, he had been passed out on the beach from overexertion, and her autopsy cited an impaled lung.

As the memory flooded back, Scott sighed, dropping slowly into the water. At this time of night, the water was freezing, but he seemed not to notice. As if drawn to some invisible target, he followed the moonlit path toward the horizon."

Maybe I'm never going to find anyone who wants to be around me longer than it takes to fuck me. Maybe I had my one shot. And even him, it seemed, had the same ultimate goal. I don't even know anymore.

Maybe there is no such thing as a male and a female loving each other. Maybe there is only lust. I'm so goddamn sick of lust. It feels so good, swept up in the moment. Afterwords...it's just so unfulfilling. I want someone to call me the next day, and tell me they dreamt about me. I want someone to care about me enough to keep their word.

I still wish I could live in that moment forever.

If I can't, I wish I could live in the moment when I'm almost asleep, but not. I can hear everything, and it makes sense, I don't even need to see. I can feel emotions, they are almost palatable in the dark air. I don't have to burden myself with reactions, don't have to fake amusement. I don't have to respond. I don't have to be witty, or intriguing, or harsh, or anything. In fact, I don't even have to be. And yet, I am anyway. That is the miracle.

Not that big of a deal, but I really do like him, which is the only reason I feel bad about shit like that, and about sleeping with Ben last night.

School Monday - Thursday, saw Chris on Tuesday, did some pool/dinner/ice cream stuff. That was really fun, he's a great guy. Went shopping with Emma, my cousin. She's grown up a lot since the last time I saw her, she's really fun. I miss the innocence of middle school. Bought some low cut shirts that I won't be able to wear as long as I'm seeing Nick. Oh well, what can ya do? What else...my aunt is crazy when she's in a bad mood. Thursday I came home. I don't remember what else I did on Thursday.

Okay, I just got really distracted. Sometimes I do this thing where I just see where the links take me. I meet people, I see their faces, I have conversations with who I think they are, and they have no idea. I'm just searching for that someone out there, because I believed it when Joe said that we are never alone. There is always someone thinking the same thought, it's just a matter of finding them. So I look, when I have time, but I don't let my mind obsess, because it is a task I might never complete.

Where was I? Right, Thursday. Came home, hung around, took my extra credit exams for Psychology, then went to hang out with Nick. I didn't even leave to go to his house until around 11:30, and I almost turned around and came home when I was halfway there. I was conflicted, I didn't know what I wanted, or whom I wanted it from. But I went, and we talked and stuff. Of course, he wanted to hook up. I told him that I wouldn't, not that night, and he respected that, as much as any guy would. I guess I was looking for a sign, something to tell me that he wasn't just using me like everyone else. I don't care that he talked to me because he wanted to have sex with me, but I do care if he doesn't make the effort to at least pretend he cares about me. I lay with him for a long time, and it felt so good. I felt safe again, like I haven't since Eric.

I realized that I haven't really had a crush on anyone in about a year. I was in love with Eric, but even when nothing was happening with him, and even when I found out he had a girlfriend anyway, I didn't ever like anyone. I had friends, and guys that I hooked up with, but no one that I really LIKED. Maybe I liked Mikey, but I was completely aware that that was a losing battle, so I never really put too much emotional stock into that one.

fdsafdsafdsafdsafdsafdsafdsafdsafdsafdsafdsafdsafdsafdsafdsafdsafdsafdsafdsa. Sometimes I don't even want to form the words, just an endless stream of letters. I think it better expresses me anyway.

Continuing chronologically from the time when I became digressed, I talked to Nick the next morning, and he said that it was a good thing that we didn't hook up. At that point, I realized. Even if he doesn't really like me, I don't care, because he does such a good job of pretending. Then he got mad because I wouldn't work out with him...sigh, oh well. He doesn't understand how embarrassing it would be; I'm in terrible shape. Working on it though...

Anyway, so Friday. Stayed home most of the day, planned to eat dinner with Nick, showered, etc, waited. I should have studied, but I did not. Lindy started getting pissed off at me because...

If that is what G-d is like, I don't think I want Him. Someone that powerful who lets such terrible things happen, whether or not we brought them upon ourselves. I just can't believe that G-d would watch an 8-year-old girl be raped by her uncle. I can't believe that G-d would let Hitler gas millions of innocent people?

Anyway, it seems like life is turning upside down. I thought I'd figured out who was friends with whom...and now there's no telling. People choose one over the other, don't talk to each other, it's just dumb. I really wanted to see Sid tonight, but he's packing. I always thought he was one of my true friends, but he really doesn't make the effort unless it benefits him. I only found out about his party thing from Lindy, and then I only found out it was Saturday, not Friday, because I directly asked him. And then he tells me to leave SF to come back for it? Too late, I had plans a week ago.

I wouldn't find it so frustrating if I didn't see myself as such the opposite. Besides the times when I'm depressed, I would drop everything to see my friends, whenever humanly possible. So to me, I don't understand being online, or cleaning, or whatever, instead of seeing friends. I just don't get it...

I can already feel I'm starting to lose that grasp on my newfound reality. A new three month perscription, and it'll be gone. Every day, just like the last. A precious few scars to remind me of what I was. A glorious new drug to make me believe that was someone else. Is that what it's doing? Fooling me into beleiving that I'm happy? No, that doesn't make any sense.  But that's what it feels like. Like when I used to hang out with friends, and fake it, pretending to be happy, and for a while I would think I was. Then, later, I would crash. There's no way to know if I will crash now, but I'm scared.

In another way, I'm scared of losing my friendship(?) with Nick. For some reason, talking to him makes all this shit seem alright. The been there, done that, idea. Maybe it's just in my mind, but then again, isn't everything?

I talked to Eric again today. I'm trying so hard, but still, everything reminds me of him. Every guy I think about dating, I compare to him. Every time I do drugs, I wonder if he even cares anymore. I have one scar from him, and I hope it never goes away. It still seems like everything reminds me of him. Everything. From the places I've seen him, to the ideas he's talked about, to the music, to the movies, to the moments. And I think I'm going to date someone else...

My only consolation is that if I get into another relationship, maybe I will finally get that peace that he (selfishly, in my mind) has found.

It just doesn't go away though...every time I think of him, I think of him with her. I don't want to call him, because when he doesn't answer, I know, he must be with her. He must be sleeping with her, he must be kissing her...Fuck it.

Unfortunately, I can't wear any tank tops right now, due to the prominent hickey I am so gloriously sporting. I hate boys. You never see a guy with a hickey. It's like a mark, so that you can't hook up with any other guys. You call it conspiracy theory, I call it insight. Anyway, for now it's 90-100 degrees outside, and I'm wearing t-shirts every day.

Reminds me of when I used to wear sweatshirts in the summer...except not at all.

In other news...okay, fine. So there is no other news. Nick texted me. It's always a surprise to hear from him, always unexpected. Who freakin' knows. The only thing that I DO know is that I want to date a mature guy. I'm so sick of guys who are incapable of carrying on a normal conversation, who think their anecdotes are so funny, who can't tell an anecdote from an antelope, and who don't know whether it's healthier to eat antelope or cantelope. And I dare say, they must be just about sick of my scornful looks. Or maybe they haven't figured it out yet. Next time you're sober, think about this - I don't even know your phone number. And we're supposed to be friends?

Because I don't retaliate when you slap my ass, because I drive you around, because I go to your party? If only there were some way to give up the stoners and the alcoholics, without the weed and the alcohol. I think I'm going to quit smoking - for good. I've seen the mature and I've seen the stoners. I don't want people to think of me one way because of some stupid choice I used to make. Long term, I won't get anything out of it. I know that, I just have to believe it.

"event","A lot of the stuff Nick says keeps reverberating in my head. He says that I'm just like everyone else, that everyone goes through these times. But my psychologist said its not normal, that not everyone feels like that. I don't know who to believe. Maybe it's just that Nick and I have that similarity, or maybe it's just that Tim didn't understand me.

I just don't get him. He talked to because he wanted to hook up with me...but he told me to come see him, and he talked to me the next day. He called me on Sunday, when I was apparently supposed to go over to his house. I think he hung up, and didn't call me back. Then he said he would call me right back, and he didn't until I texted him. Later, he said that he wasn't planning on it. That was right after saying how much MORE attracted to me he was after talking on the phone forever. I just don't know. Everything about him screams that this is the same as always. This is the guy who wants the hookup, at any cost. But a three hour phone conversation? Most guys don't go that far. Which is what has me confused. He's pretty honest about his motives, but says that it isn't just about a hookup. Still, I'm a lot younger than him...even though he didn't know that.

The clutch is, he's mature. Immature too, but mature. We talked about politics, and society, and nutrition, and god knows what else. Its those kind of thing that make me think he's a good guy, but then he goes off and makes some offhand comment, and I realize that his sole motivation is still sex.

I hate society. I am seriously considering forcing myself to become a lesbian. How many girls are there that have absolutely NO attachment to a hookup? Few. Very few. Guys? Just about all of them. Of three guys who I would potentially like to be in a relationship with (excluding Eric, I've fucking given up on that) only one of them has potentially true motives. Potentially. I mean, he seems like a real stand-up guy, but I would say that about Mikey, too. Look where that got me, sigh. I'm just so tired of hookups.

Is it really so bad that I want to feel like someone cares? I just want someone to call me, for no reason, just to say hi. I want a BOYFRIEND. Someone who I know, who I can point to and say, look, he cares about only ME. It would be nice if that guy was a good guy, but at this point, I don't think I'm all that picky. I said it to Nick yesterday, and it's true. I'm tired of being independent. I don't want to be strong. I want to be held, and I want to be loved. I want someone to tell me where to go, and when, and I don't want to think about it anymore.

I want someone to kiss me goodnight, and tell me it's going to be okay. AND I WANT TO BELIEVE HIM. I don't care if it's true or not...I just want to believe it, because I don't believe myself anymore.

Honestly, is that so much to want?"

"event","Late night therapy session begins now. This is all that therapy really is, in the long run, a release. I don't believe that it ever would have found me the answer I'm searching. How can someone draw from me what I can't draw for myself? Maybe the whole thing is made up. Maybe there never was anything wrong with me in the first place. Maybe I saw a movie, and created all this for myself. A desperate attempt to be different in this anogizing world of similarity. Maybe I play the part well; I always could make them believe what I wanted. Not my parents. They were guided by the heart, not the brain. But the reasoning people, the logical people, I could always fool them. I knew the answer they wanted, and I knew what answer would produce the answer that I wanted.

In fact, I was even able to convince my parents, it just took more. It took more finesse, and more focus, because I had to put up a screen 24/7, not just for the hour I sat in someone's office. So it took longer, but in the end, it was just as effective. I highly doubt that I have ever served a complete punishment in my life. It wasn't for lack of trying on their part though. To give them credit, I don't think they knew how well I understood the system.

In every instance, there were two paths. There was the honest answer, which no one could comprehend, nor explain, least of all myself. Then there was the answer that was correct. This applies most of all to the questions that ""don't have any correct answer."" They certainly do. If the question is, what is your sexual preference, and the person asking is homophobic, there are two correct answers, and both depend on the effect you wish to prove. So when they say that questions ""don't have any correct answer,"" they should be saying that every answer is correct, it just depends on what kind of correct you are striving to be.

Anyway, adhering to this system of providing their correct answers certainly has its pitfalls. One of the problems of lying, in any instance, is that it requires one to remember the truth. It is my hypothesis that maintaining, for long periods of time, both a concept of the hidden truth and the rhetoric of the lies, will prove extremely detrimental to one's health, especially if the dualism is maintained throughout adolescence.

Which leads right into my spiel about why teenagers shouldn't date. According to Erickson's theory of child development {I think}, during adolescence, teenagers go through a phase where the establish their identity. This being said, it's fair to assume that most teens establish their identity sometime throughout high school. A long-term relationship rarely works with two people who are incompatible, and people who are compatible most commonly have the same interests, or adapt to having the same interests. Thus, if you are in a long-term relationship in high school, it is likely that some, if not all, of your identity has been formed around the ideals that you and your boyfriend/girlfriend shared. Unfortunately, most high school relationships do not last. This means that teenagers who were in long-term relationships, which have since ended, have formed much of their identity around their ex.

Okay, so I'm having a hard time getting over him.

Fortunately, there are many attractive boys at Davis to cure me of what I am now referring to as The Disease. After all, a disease is something which is parasitic, and a parasite is something which feeds off its host while giving nothing in return. That sounds like unrequited love to me.

To get away from that tired subject, I met my new roommate today! She sounds much better than unrequited love, but how much can you honestly tell from AIM? I jest, she seems really cool, not at all the stuck-up prick I was worried about. Michael Buble apparently scores her some big points with the cool kids; I wouldn't know about anything like that.

It's almost one thirty, and I wonder how long I've been writing this. Fruedian slip, I just wrote love instead of long {and then wrong instead of wrote}. The problem is, my mind works faster than my fingers.

I stop for a moment and can almost feel the thoughts leaking out. Instead of trapping them on paper, they slip away, and why? Because I'm afraid it will seem stupid to write them down? No one reads what I write, and I don't write so that people think I'm intelligent. God knows, I hope no one who can actually write ever reads this. On the other hand, this is me. Tell me, oh one who would look down upon me, what should I do to improve? I write, here, every word I can, until my brain and fingers are tired, and all I want to do is sleep. I know basic grammer and spelling, enough to get my points across. I'm not accidently writing in sentence fragments, or writing ""u r 2 kewl.""

I think I could write for hours and never get any points across. But it makes me feel better, it lifts some invisible strain off my back, reminding myself that I can write. Whenever I want, I can sit down and say what I have to say. I can't make people listen, but they can't shut me up either. Some day, the world will hear me. I only hope that when they do, I have something useful to say. Besides ""take the ACT.""

But for now...

take the ACT."

This Saturday, my aunt, uncle, and two cousins flew in from New Jersey, and we all went to a party for my parents' friends. Boring as all hell, I was stuck for five hours. Got a little bit of lax in, but nothing useful. Later that night I hung out with Gary and Adam, and had some adventures with gravity. Sunday I went to Santa Cruz with the fam, and saw Eric and Lindy later that night. We later caught up with Mike, did some of the ususal, and then Eric and I went to Livorna Park, and just chilled for a little while. When I was supposed to be home, we went back to my house, and just talked in his car in the driveway for a bit. I tried to understand a circut board (like a bunch of lightbulbs?), but random images kept flashing into my mind. I gave him the letter that I had written over a few days, and I felt relieved. I gave it to him, and it said everything that I had wanted to say, or close enough.

I'm coming to the realization that there really isn't anything I can do. Him saying that it was because I didn't call him, or act like I loved him, is bullshit, because I SAID it. There is no mystery to ""I love you."" The fact that he didn't believe me is not my fault. Frankly, I don't think that even had anything to do with it. He found someone who lives practically with him, who he liked. Fine. Don't blame that on me, as if it was my fault. That's the thing that really gets me, he needs to own up to the fact that he made that decision.

Anyway, Monday. Drama, with a capital D. I decided to go home for the afternoon, because Laiah was having a get-together. I knew that it would be the last time I saw most of those people, so I deemed it worth the journey. Also, and this was NOT my deciding factor, Conor was getting some people together at Byron's house. I had planned to come down before I even knew my parents would be gone, and I would just stay at Byron's, or something like that. When they left, I planned on just going home to sleep when I got tired. Regardless, when I told my mother that I was home, she flipped out. It ended up that I convinced her I wasn't doing anything wrong, and to prove it, I had to call her from Lindy's house by 12 (when my mom said we had to be home) so that the caller ID showed up. Which I did, and which was ridiculous. I wasn't planning on having a party; I was planning on sleeping. Bah.

Tuesday = another boring day in class. Was supposed to hang out with Chris after school, but it was decided that I should come see the family instead, so I headed back to Sacto. Altogether an uneventful day.

Wednesday, hump day, reminds me of the Keri story, which I will retell in a minute. On Wednesday, I went to Psych, which was more interesting than usual, and promted me to actually *gasp* ask a question in class. Sociology is getting better by the day, and today we actually worked in groups instead of just having a lecture. Test tomorrow though, on a lot of material. Needless to say, I'm freaked. Not freaked enough to study though. After school I saw Chris, which is always so refreshing. Cynical/sarcastic as he is, his humor and demenor has an honesty to it that I consistently find lacking in my friends. He doesn't smoke, and I don't think he really drinks...but he's not stuck-up and boring either. Sigh. Chris, I wish I could master your art. Anyway, so we went for a walk in the Arbor something or other. That was fun, and pretty. I saw a wild rabbit for the first time - thrilling, I know. Eventually, I went home, half-starved from not eating after 9 AM. Luckily for me, there was no dinner left. I ate mashed potatoes, which held me over until we went grocery shopping. Can you imagine, no food? My stomach was muy enojado. Blah, blah, that takes me through to now, and writing. And the Keri story, which I think is just hilarious.

At Conor's shindig, I left, to go take care of some business. As I'm leaving, Lindy says to me, ""Hey, don't have sex with anyone."" I gave her some sarcastic response, and went to leave. Then Keri (only slightly inebriated) says to me, ""No wait, DO have sex. Take my car, no one has had sex in that backseat in a long time."" At first I think she is joking, and I'm skeptical. But she actually handed me the keys. Thinking to myself, this is too good an opportunity to pass up, I take the keys. Go figure, the one day Mikey is nowhere to be found...sigh. Later Sid said I should have called him.

The thing about Sid is that he strikes me as the kind of guy who his first time would matter. So, even if I was going to have sex with Sid, I wouldn't, because I think it would matter to him, and I don't. I mean, we're friends, but it doesn't mean anything long term. Most guys I think it doesn't really matter, largely because that's what I've heard, and I've never heard otherwise. It's not like with girls, where if something happens, it fucks you up (read: still in love with the ex). I don't know, I guess I should do some field research. Consider it in progress. Girls: Yes (4) No (1). Boys: Yes (3) No (4). Okay, so as of yet, the data is not very conclusive.

That's enough for now. Perhaps an entry later about my feeeeeelings. Or perhaps not. You, non-existent reader, will just have to wait and see."

Like yoga. Fuck all those people who push yoga, as if it's the only way to find peace of mind. Maybe I've already got my own way. Maybe I don't mind the withdrawls, as long as I'm gone for a little while. When you look at the world carefully enough, all it is is addictions. Take me for example. I'm addicted to food, water and air. And, as much as I've tried to get away from it, I'm addicted to sleep. I'm addicted to punishing myself, and I'm fucking addicted to pain. Now please, tell me, do you think it's worse to be addicted to alcohol, or to pain? I'll give you a hint - when you hurt, all that happens is you hurt more. When you drink, it gets better for a little while.

But back a step. Even alcoholics. Addicted to alcohol. Stop drinking, but they need an addiction. Any addiction really. That's the problem to begin with. They needed an addiction, and maybe alcohol seemed to suit them best. If they stop drinking, what happens? Maybe they're the next work-a-holic father. Maybe they can get by for one day without an AA meeting. Maybe they're so obsessed with keeping their house clean that they don't have friends over. Whatever it is, they have it. That secret, lurking addiciton that is in all adicts.

There is no getting rid of it. There are only fakers, and liars. The fakers don't ever lose their original addiction. The liars switch it out for something a little more conventional, and tell themselves they are cured.

I think it would be easier to find these things out about myself if I didn't despise them so much.

It's that sick feeling. The feeling that, deeper than anything else, you know something is wrong. You don't know what, and that's why it slowly fills your stomach. As if the not knowing makes it more imminent. It could be any moment.

Enough. I'm supposed to be going out to breakfast with Eric tomorrow, but I couldn't reach him, so I doubt he'll be up by 9:30, so I doubt I'll be seeing him. Oh well. I guess maybe it really is done for now.

At least I'm not completely alone. Because even if he doesn't like me, he'll hold me. Even if it's not for love, he'll kiss me. Even if he doesn't want me, he'll fuck me. Even if it's not tomorrow, it will be someday. That's the way it works, isn't it? I am that girl. Someday, I'll just give it all up, join a nunnery.

Does a nun feel rejection?
Does a terrorist understand peace?
Do rapists want to be loved?

I used to think that maybe there really was someone else like me, and I would find them, and everything would make sense. But the more I pour myself into these words, the more I feel myself dividing, from everything, from everyone.

Not because I'm in that chasm, but because I've been. Because I jumped there, and I crawled out. And yet I never picked up the black eyeliner, never wrote suicide poetry to be critiqued, never changed my background to red. I'm astonished every time I think...but I don't think anyone else really knew. If your adolescence was a rainbow, mine was a vacuum. If yours was a roller coaster, mine was a black hole.

And even saying that, I know it's wrong. There are people out there, like I was. Am?

I don't want to go to sleep, because I don't want to have any more nightmares. I didn't have them until the meds...not ever. Now every night I have one. To a little kid, it's no wonder that nightmares are terrifying. Like your body could tense up, and your heart could explode, right there. That's how terrified you are. Beyond even the simplest thought. And its even worse, because that quiet little voice in the back of your head knows that its all a dream. Part of you is screaming, make it stop, but you won't. Maybe you like it, just a little bit.

It would be a lot easier to know."

And then, it starts to fade. And as it does, you start to realize that you were perfectly fine staring at a tree for an hour. What a sad, pathetic life. A life devoid of thought, of intelligence, of interaction. The very thing I crave more than anything, and yet would despise more than anything.

My family is coming tomorrow. Aunt, uncle, two younger cousins. Mixed feelings about that. I'm really excited to see them, especially my cousins, but I can't get over how dramatic they all are. They won't be seeing my grandma for more than one day, because they don't get along with my aunt. Brother and sister, and they refuse to be in the same house for more than one day. Even to see their mother, who is 80-something, and won't last forever. I guess it just goes to show you, high school drama really never does die; it just changes shape.

Sometimes the state of the world makes me so sad. Isn't anyone happy without drugs, without drama, without hate, without lying? For a minute, while I was watching TV with Mikey, I felt like it was okay. Like, I was safe. For that minute, I didn't have to fight at all. Enter revelation, and the world comes crashing down again.

If I just knew that someone cared, I wouldn't feel so alone.

Don't get me wrong, for the first time in my life, I'm coming to terms with it. It's okay that I'm lonely, and it's okay that I'm alone. Maybe that's the way my life is supposed to be.

The meds don't get rid of that deep, empty feeling. They just sometimes make me forget to ache.

Do you ever write so much that you forget to shield? That you forget that you are supposed to be a wall, that writing is just that. Do you ever write so much that you slip, and let out a part of yourself you thought you would never share? I hope so. I don't want any of this, I want to write it all away. Write and write and write, and then write it off, and then get on with my life.

I can just feel it, so deep within me, there's something I have to figure out. I'm always thinking, always straining. Trying to remember something I've long forgotten. It's hidden away, behind locker combinations, and old insecurities. The little silver key marked JS, that will tell me what I need to know. I've been dealing with the grief of some unnamed death. I just want to know what died, is that so much to ask?

It's frustrating that I completely lack the ability to judge people. And furthermore, when I do, I lack the ability to make the necessary desicions. There are people that are just asinine to me, and yet I still respond positively to them. I call them, I have sex with them, I do them favors, I talk to them, whatever. Why?

Maybe I'd like to think that people are inherently good. That even if someone is harsh towards me, he is still a good person. If someone lies to me, she didn't mean it personally. Regardless, it definitely hurts to know that some people that I call friends simply don't want to see me/talk to me/know me?

And that's the fuck of it. If they would just lay it out there, yeah, it would suck, but at least I would know. I wouldn't feel so deceived. I wouldn't feel like it was MY FAULT. That's the worst of it. Through everything I just keep thinking that if only I was skinnier, if I laughed more, if I wasn't so uptight at parties, if I wasn't so intense, etc, maybe then people would want to see me, would want to put in the effort to be a real friend.

Which brings me to my final point, the question that I'm sure most of us (who have a functioning brain, not yet drowned with alcohol) have asked or will ask at some point in our lives: do I actually have true friends?

Obviously I have friends on the level of, hey, how's it going. I have friends who will invite me to parties, occasionally. I have friends who IM me, and I have friends who call me. I have friends who buy me birthday presents, and I have friends who listen to me rant. I have friends who understand some aspect of my life. I have friends who have read the same books as me, who watch the same TV, listen to the same music.

Does it amount to anything?

Friend: A person whom one knows, likes, and trusts.

So, I know lots of people. A few of them, I like.

I don't think that I have every really trusted anyone.

For more than a minute anyway. That's just the problem. I trust everyone initially, and no one ultimately. I gave more of myself to Eric than I ever have, to anyone. Maybe that's the reason I was so forceful in pushing him away. Maybe I really am just a bitch, who doesn't care about anyone but herself.

I think I've played that card enough though lately. I take everything upon myself. I left my things in my car, and I trusted untrustworthy people, but they did the wrong, not me. IT WASN'T MY FAULT. When he died, and I hadn't gotten to talk enough, it wasn't my fault for not asking. These things just happen. When he tried to make it my fault for leaving, it wasn't. When they left me alone, so much, so long, it wasn't my fault. I said no, and even if I was drunk, I know what I said. I said no, and he didn't listen. That is not my fault. It hurt, and I didn't want it, and it WASN'T MY FAULT. My depression, though mine, ISN'T MY FAULT. I didn't do anything wrong, I didn't do anything to deserve these things.

I have been taken advantage of. I have been stolen from. I have been abandoned. I have been disadvantaged. These things ARE NOT MY FAULT.

I might forever be searching to reverse these ills, but at least I know,

they are not my fault."

"event","I don't think I've ever actually sat down to write a journal entry with absolutely nothing to say. That is to say, it's not like I have nothing to say, I always have something to say, even when I say that I have nothing to say.

It seems like life in general is taking a turn for the better. A new chance to make new, strong friendships. Sometimes I wonder what I could have had with some of my current friends, if only I'd put in a little more effort. On the other hand, I can think of many friends with whom I put in too much effort. In this life, there is no happy medium. Sigh. Regardless, this is not a sad reflection, just a reflection.

My friendship with Chris is almost a sign, one might say. After all this reflection on how I really don't know that many people who are honestly good people, one seems to have fallen into my clutches. Or perhaps I don't know him that well yet, we'll see. I always have been a terrible judge of character.

On the other hand, I don't really know where I get off, thinking that I should be able to find friends who are good people, when I don't even meet my own standards. People say I have low standards, but thats just not the case. I settle. It's different.

On a completely unrelated, but not so unrelated, tangent, I still can't stop thinking about him. If he had said go, I would have dropped everything...I probably still would now, broken heart in hand.

Some might say I'm rambling, and I would agree. This is a journal, isn't it? Thus, I am embarking on the journey into myself. Believe it or not, that was intended to be read as philosophical, not porn title-esque.

I sway back and forth between the two concepts: either I really am too intense for the rest of the world, or the rest of the world is quite a bit more shielded about it.

I have trouble with the latter for a number of reasons. First off, there are some people who simply cannot have ever had a deep thought in their life. I know this because I have met them, calculated the size of their brain, and realized that their entire head would have exploded upon the realization of such a thought, spewing blood and bits of brain onto unsuspecting onlookers. Seeing as how I have never witnessed, nor heard of such an event, I can only come to one conclusion. There are people who simply do not have deep thoughts. Or, there's a massive government coverup of brain explosion accidents. I guess that's two conclusions.

Another problem with the latter is the question of why. I understand the complications that my perspective brings to the table, and yet understanding does not answer the question. Besides being blond and imaging (or knowing), that boys are often drawn to the more accessible ""ditzy"" crowd, I can't imagine a reason to pretend to be shallow.

Obviously, there is a larger problem with the first proposition, that I am simply too intense for this world. The problem? I dunno, that would suck.

I like singing songs, Pink Floyd in the rain,
Cuz it doesn't remind me of anything."

"event","I don't know why, but for some reason, I feel like I can write again. I'm writing poetry, and I'm writing letters, and I'm writing journals. Everything I see or think, I read it as an essay, or a poem, or a short, quick burst of wisdom.

It seems there's poetry in everything; symbolism in the most minute details. The way the ivy climbs the fence, the particular hue of the roses outside my window. Even the persistent chirp of the bird sitting on the rooftop seems important, in its own way.

I feel the world is so much different now. My eyes are finally open. Sun slants in through the open window, and it is a blessing, not the blinding burden my head still expects. My peripheral vision has expanded, and I am no longer constrained by seeing only what is in front of me. The cloud that has long plauged my brain seems to have dissipated.

I look around, and I see hope. In the white washed walls of the closets, in the impatient stand of the phone, waiting to hear from someone, in the shine off the golden doorknob, in the cord powering my new age typewriter. There is hope of innocence, of love, of fun, and of wisdom.

I am happy. For no reason. A different kind of happy though. Not like usual mania, feeling like I can, and will, do anything. Just okay. Right now, I'm not going to go looking for trouble, but I feel like I can handle whatever the world throws at me.

I AM HAPPY. And I am happy about being happy.

Is it me? I don't think so. Could I have gotten here on my own? I doubt it. I cheated, used a crutch. I just wanted to stop thinking. But now, it's okay to think. 

Before I was feeling around a dark gym, identifying objects, and forgetting them by the time I reached the other side. All this did was turn the lights on.

Just in case you thought I forgot, I still love you. You told me not to tell you anymore, that's all."

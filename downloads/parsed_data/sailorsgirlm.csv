"event","Well, I need to catch up my blog with all the great stories of my life in Ghana...but first I will just update everyone with the most current situation: my internship. 
I am working with the Media Foundation for West Africa, in the heart of the main city Accra, and it is great. 
To get here I walk from Okpungolo (my neighborhood) in East Legon to a trotro stop about a half a mile away. Then I stand there and flag down a dangerously overcrowed van (trotro). I know which van is mine because there is a boy hanging out the window yelling very quickly ""circle, circle, circle, circle"", which is a major round-about in Accra, and drawing circles in the air with his finders. I chase it down climb over the 15 people crammed into a minivan and hold on. The driving is interesting...very aggressive, yet friendly. A trotro will literally push someone off the road if they won't let us in the lane. During the ride I hand my 3500 cedis (about 35 cents) to the boy hanging out the window. 
When I get to my stop I climb over everyone and dodge the hustlers and market people who think they get rip off an 'obroni' (white person/foreigner-not an insult), step over the three-foot deep gutters filled with the city's waste and feeding chickens, step around holes and large rocks on the dust road, and keep an eye out for the old mad man who is stalking and molesting my canadian co-worker. 
By the time I get to work its about an hour, I usually have new blisters, and face is covered with dust and sweat. I don't mind at all because then I get to enter my air conditioned building set in the middle of the shanti shacks in an alley. I remember which alley to walk down because the first wall on the right has a spray painted message on the wall reading, ""No urinating or dumping"" and ""Immediate 250,000 cedis fine"". I smile at the old men calling ""eye te sen"" and respond ""aye aye"" sometimes ""pa pa pa"" on a good day, and give the children in uniforms going to school candy or stickers when they say ""obruni, obruni! toffeee toffee"". 
The atmosphere is very relaxed, everything is explained in a vary conversational manner, and people work slowly. Nice, easy and relaxed. Sometimes we listen to Bob Marley. 
At MFWA we have correspondents in 16 countries who call us when there is a violation of freedom of the press or any media rights, such journalists being killed or assaulted, bombed radio stations, permanent shut down orders from the gov. to newspapers...etc. Then we call various people to clarify facts and write a Media Alert which is sent like a press release to the press and our listserv (these can be found at www.mfwaonline.org. We also have various publications. 
My project is to conceptualize and present a proposal for the new academic journal , which will tie these events to theoretical concepts. I'm sure it doesn't sound interesting to most of you...but I am stoked! 
O.K. I'll juice it up a bit. Currently we some journalists staying in our office whose lives are being threatened by their gov. One was attacked here recently, so is in hiding...he has some crazy scars on his arms from the attempted murder. 
Well that about it for now. I'm going to research journals about media and democracy. More later....
any questions?"

My brilliant prof Bish Sen commented the other day that in this new subhuman  phase of late capitalism receiving e-mail makes him feel human. I completely identitfy. I wake up in the morning with my laptop next to my bed on the floor. The first thing I do is open it to check my e-mail. If there is nothing personal...I search. I go to my myspace account then my hotmail account. Searching for that recognition that, yes other people still exist and are thinking of me. So, here I am creating a livejournal account. Basically to increase my chances of survival."

"event","u know sometimes being a vampire is not that half bad.  my brother foun d something that i didnt even know existed.  a big surprise to me was that i knew i could count on him.  when humans get diseases they have to live with it until their time is up.  with pure bloods they never get any diseases, they have natural immunities to any disease.  but for being a half breed like myself i guess that doesnt apply.  i had a disease for a very long time.  it was called lung cancer.  u cant escape it, and u cant run from it u just have to accept it.  there is a prophecy about me and my brother.  

""two brothers brothers born ito a world of hate, one is the stongest of the two, the other is the smartest of all, if one dies by the others hand, then both brothers die.  u r free from the chains of fate that bind u together"" .

i didnt know that it was talking about us.  this prophecy was written by the first vampire ever to walk the earth.  if some of u r religous and go to church then u know who judas ascariate is.  he was the first vampire to walk the earth.  it was written in ancient vampiric writing so no one would be able to understand it.  to most ppl. it would like like graffiti or a bunch of crazy lines.  to me and my kind its apart of our history.

there is only one thing on this earth that can kill me or my brother alex.  but that wont be revealed to u just yet.  cancer wont kill me and i wont let it.  most of my friends would have been lost without me, since im the one that always gives them good advise.  but at least i will live to see my brother and my father speak again after 7 years.  they had a bit of a falling out some time ago and this year im going to reunite them after 7 years.  

its said that the twin sons of a pure blood would take over the world but i changed that long time ago.  my family used to call us ""groshka tu vagj""  it looses something in the translation but in english it means ""the terible children"".  i hated when they siad that because i didnt want to believe it at first, but when i saw a scroll about it a long time ago i then started to believe in it.

well all tings considered im in good health and i dont see myself killing my brother any time soon and he and i have been on good terms for a while now.  hes got a new life for himself and i couldnt be happier.

"event","i am very happy now.  i have a girlfriend now and i couldnt be more happier.  i took so much advise into consideration and used it to finally work up the nerve to ask her out.  

i talked to her today and she sounded so happy.  she had lost my number that she got and then she found it again and sounded so happy because she found it.  she has that hole ""school girl crush"" type of thing, and to me thats really cute.  

she turns red everytime i compliment her about anything..... like, telling her that she looks beautiful or telling her about the way she has her hair and how it comes over the side of her face, or anything that makes her turn red.  i had a chance to see her again yesterday and i was so happy.  

she was happy because she found the paper with my name on it, shes happy that she has it and now shes happy that she has me.  she thinks im gorgeous and i think shes beautiful and we both couldnt be more happier.  in the words of stimpy... ""oh joy"".  

hopefully i will see her again sometime soon.  i dont know if i will see her 2morrow but im praying she will come to the mall and see me.  i dont have school on the weekends and i dont have to work on the weekends so i end up spending all day at the mall on saturdays and sundays.

so this goes out to all the ppl. that helped me with as much advise as i could use and i say "" THANK U ALL "".  all of ur advise helped me muster up the courage to ask her out.  even my friends at the mall helped me and i thank them too.

if any one who helped me would like to comment on this then please do so.  and once again "" THANKS ALL OF U ""."

"event","is it wrong to fall in love too fast, or is it wrong to fall in love at all.  i like a certain girl and i know she likes me, in fact she thinks im gorgeous, i think she is absolutly beautiful.  i talk to her all the time, but i just cant shake the fact that i think im falling for her.  how do i tell her. yah, and heres the thing, we have only been out on one date and it was a blind date at that.  but she has seen me all the time at the mall.  when i saw her i was speachless for at least ten seconds, so that right there is a message in it self.  should i continue things and tell her how i feel or should i just let things progress and see what happens next?  help me decide any info and advise will help.  i give a lot of advise to all my friends but when it comes to a situation about me i cant take my own advise.  comment on this and let me know PLEASE.

"event","this is another song about me.  sometimes i wonder about who i really am.  so here is a song about who i am,  i hope allof u like it.

"" WHO AM I ""

don't say it will stay this way forever

i'm a float in the ocean
trying not to sink
i'm a crack in the asphalt
you walk by on the street
i'm a falling star, you'll never see
so who am i

don't say it will stay this way forever
don't say it will stay this way forever

i'm the lesson, you'll never learn
the sickness that was never
your concern
i'm the bridge in the gap,
the corner of your mind
so who am i

don't say it will stay this way forever
don't say it will stay this way forever
don't say it will stay this way forever
don't say it will stay this way forever

o'm holding on, yes i am
i am the knot in your stomach
the flem in your throught
the message saying, your not home

don't say it will stay this way forever
don't say it will stay this way forever

i'm afloat in the ocean
trying not to sink.....

if u have friends, realy good friends that u can consider counting on, and they have a home to go to by the end of the day, and they ask to crash at ur place, how do u deal with that?  how do u tell ur friends that they cant stay at ur house knowing for the fact that they have a home to go to by the end of the night.  some of them just recently became homeless becasue they got kicked out, so as of this week i have no problem letting them stay at my place, but when u r not homeless and u have a home to go to..... then i think u should go home right?  how do u tell that person over and over again to go home... do u tell them boldly "" GO THE FUCK HOME, U HAVE A PLACE TO STAY! "" or do u let them down easy? "" SORRY I CANT HELP U, I CANT HAVE ANYONE STAY THE NIGHT "".

put me down as ur mutual friend o.k.

but this is all about my party.  it was awsome, my friends from the mall came to my house and we all had a good time, listening to music and getting drunk.  i wanted them to get away from the mall at least once and i did that on saturday.  crimeinpassion and my friend Ish and Becca were wasted off their ass.  i had to ground Ish and crimeinpassion beacause they were all over the place.  they were all loud and i didnt even get to drink myself because i was the so-called croud pleaser, i had to make sure nothing got out of hand and it did for a while but nothing to serious. luckilly the police didnt show up ruin the fun.  i had about 6 ppl. stay the night and i only planed to have 3 over.  Antonia, Ish, crimeinpassion, Stevo, Kitty, and Paul the dork, those were the ppl. that stayed the night.  Antonia left around 7 in the morning and the rest woke up around 10 or 11 in the morning, i made breakfast and tyhen later we all left to the mall.  i left with crime., Ish and Stevo,.  well all things considered we all had a good night of fun i had a lot of ppl. over, some i cant even remember their names because i just met them the same day.  well i will see them in a little bit when i go back to the mall.  so for now just comment on what u think and let me know..... i left some stuff out and if u want to know then just comment.

"event","here for all to see is another song about me.  lately ive been failing at almost everything i try to do, go to sleep, find the right girl, and find another good job, so here is a song about failure.  hope u all like it.

"" BEST KNOWN FOR FAILURE ""

i'm in and out of conversation
i'ts hard to keep my attention
locked down
so don't take offense
to anything i say
i tried so hard to keep you
coming back my way

but you don't know the half
and i'm the one to blame for it

cause i'm best known for failure
best known for giving up
there's nothing that i could say
that could matter
that could matter enough

i figured out my situation
i am a nameless source
of useless information
give me bad news cause
it's already been expected
i let my front down and
i know i will regret it

but you don't know the half
and i'm the one to blame for it

cause i'm best known for failure
best known for giving up
there's nothing that i could say
that could matter
that could matter enough

let's get down
to business now
i'm saving myself
the trouble in the end

but you don't know the half
and i'm the one to blame for it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

well thats pretty much how i feel right now, a failure, but dont worry ppl., i will get back on my feet soon.  heres some advise for all to hear,

"" FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION, IF U FAIL, START OVER AND DO IT RIGHT THIS TIME.""

hope u like the song.

"" I'D KILL TO FALL ASLEEP ""

eyes open i'm wide-awake
i feel i'm in a comma state
i lay here on my back and
     watch the fan turn
conversations cross my mind
but not that of the speaking kind
t.v. images repeat their one lines

back and forth
i toss and turn
it feels like strings
     are holding up my eyes

i'd kill to fall asleep

i'm putting up a losing fight
i'll never see this end tonight
the thought of just one dream
     it consumes me
numbers on the clock turn back
my pills are having no effect
the beating of my heart
    keeps the time going

back and forth
i toss and turn
it feels like strings 
     are holding up my eyes

i'd kill to fall asleep

they say that when you sleep
     your body's at rest
i wouldn't know what sleep felt like
     if i tried my best
if polariods and memories
     can fade away
so can i..............

i'd kill to fall asleep.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

well thats pretty much how my nights have been going so far so now the only thing i have to do is find a way to fall asleep, if any of u have any suggestions other than sleeping pills, comment on this and let me know.  here is some words of advice that o know i will not be able to take,

"" SLEEPING IS THE ONLY TIME U CAN BE AT PEACE, SO SLEEP LONG, SLEEP WELL "".

"" I DON'T WANNA KNOW ""

your eyes were covered
in sunglasses
when they first met mine
i sat there and stared at you
you didn't seem to mind
the awkward ways we meet

first comes heavy breathing
staring at the ceiling
what will happen next 
i don't wanna know

i never cared how i dressed before
but i cared that night
anticipation ran through my bones
and my clothes never fit right
i can't wait till we meet again

first comes heavy breathing
staring at the ceiling
what will happen next
i don't wanna know

frammed pictures start to be
     put on the walls
constant visits while 
     i'm out on the road
it's hard to leave sometimes
but you know where
     i lay my head at night

first comes heavy breathing
staring at the ceiling
what will happen next
     i don't wanna know.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

well that's it ppl., i finished it and know she would have liked it, so i hope all of u like it too.  well time for me to go, if u would like to comment on this the please do so, for now i will leave u with some good advise,

""ENDING IN TRAGEDY ""

i tried to save us
but little did i know
you are a speeding train off track
with little time to go

i tried everything
tried so hard to let you know
but now i'm on my last thread
pulling away to no avail

yeah
now it's our time
yeah
now it's our time
and i'll see you on the other side

beneath all you're skin
there's another side to you
u built up city walls so i never get through,
u built up city walls so i can never get through

yeah
now it's our time
yeah
now it's our time
and i'll see you on the other side

why would i take it too far
with not thinking about the end at all
if a fortune could say what the future will bring
then i'm not convinced
it's ending in tragedy
and most of all 
it's in my control
to end it all

now it's our time
yeah
now it's our time
and i'll see u on the other side

"event","my confidence has taken a sudden turn for the best. i am so pleased with myself right now, its out of control. i am doing whatever id like, whenever id like, and i really like it, yet something is always bothering me in the back of my mind..
<lj-cut text=""read on to read me""> 


im starting to break all of these long held grudges, and starting to really accept people. like, the boys !(polaroid ?,baby j, mellow, ect.) people that, yeah i wont even lie, i used to poke fun at, are actually some of the sweetest people i know ! with several exceptions, yes, but for the most part, they are a ton of fun ! we are having a great time, just doing anything, and loving my life. well dressed, well posed, creative and so cute. i cant help but fall for a few, though i have a specific one in mind. i dont feel like i sold out on myself, because these are the people i should have been with all along. beautiful minds and equally beautiful people. young, careless, wild, and pretty much amazing. compared to the boys of my past ? angry straight edge punkrockers, hardcore bros, and burnt out, hopeless clueless scum bags, you new boys outshine them all. and mad props to my babies rhett, sean and rusty ! i will love you 3 until the day i die, youve all had my back for as long as i can remember and youre the most classy mother fuckers i know, youre all going somewhere, DEFFINATELY and getting (or youve already gotten) the fuck out of this shit hole.

but then, theres the girls, oh these fucking girls. lets get specific, amanda, you may have fucked me over, but in all honestly it was for the best, you saved me from a horrible relationship that i had no way out of. you opened up my prison cell, and i couldnt possibly hold it against you. you are a great friend, you are so fun, so funny, and we just do whatever and its so tight haha. tara, eleni, marrissa, patty, you are all my party girls and im going to love you forever no matter what, youre dont give a fuck, and youre the shit ! but then theres sasha. ive kept my mouth shut but there is something so unsetteling about you being back in my life. i mean, i knew it was going to happen eventually, i dreaded it, but at the same time, i just cant hate you again. you stole my boyfriend, humiliated me, you kept me pissed off at the world for months on end. you disgust me, yet you amaze me. no matter what we go through, you always come back to me exactly the same, like nothing ever happened, but so fucking much has happened. we should have killed each other by now, but little things, like the sami scene ordeal ? remind me that i clearly care a great deal about you. seeing her push you back made me furious, so i did what any good friend would do and threw her to the ground, ripped out her weave, and made a fool of her, so you would seem great. together we are clearly unstoppable, but i dont want to risk you fucking me over again. i know you, i know you VERY well, and i know that you are sheisty, and youll always be that way. youre an evil bitch, but im an evil bitch, and this whole thing is driving me crazy. youre living with my ex boyfriend, the boy that wanted to marry me a few months ago. i feel nothing for him, but i feel something for you, basically that we were friends forever, and sometimes its hard to let go."

We all listened to mia and had a good time. I felt important, but sick. I'm very sick lately. I might lose my job ? For stealing ? Fuck that. But anyways I'm falling deeper and deeper into the drug world and I'm falling faster and faster for someone. I'm pretty sure I'm going to be alright in the end, but no one knows, so we'll see."

"event","&nbsp;since the last post in my previous livejournal, me and kai broke up, and ive been going out with dustin for about&nbsp; 2 weeks, and while i do like him alot, things are so hard. most of the people&nbsp;i hung around with at school have completely abandoned me, which isnt too big of a problem because none of them mattered much anyways, except for one, and as mad as it makes me, i miss my friend more than anything, and i dont miss our relationship at all. ive tried so hard to apologize, but its no good, considering what i did was wrong, even though im pretty much happier now, its always in the back of my head, i see it everywhere that i go. this is my problem, its my mistake, its mine to live with, and mine alone, i didnt think before i spoke and im so sorry, forever. and well.. moving on, dustin and i have been fighting because im an overly emotional piece of shit, but&nbsp;i love him and i really need him, were going to make it work, because if it doesnt ill probably fall apart completely and without my 2 best friends, paige and sean, i probably would have killed myself by now. too bad im at school, or i would complain a little more."

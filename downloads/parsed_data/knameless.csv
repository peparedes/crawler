other than those things that are DUE, i have the things to DO. . . reviews, classes, group meetings for projects, etc. weeee. 


1. Can you cook? to an extent. i don't really burn anything, and i can follow recipes perfectly fine. . . i'm just not so creative if i have to throw together something. 
2. What was your dream growing up? i wanted to do something in the ""industry"". i went through the phase of wanting/doing dancing, singing, and guitar/other instruments. . . but i also didn't really want to be in the spotlight, so i wanted to do something behind the scenes. i don't really know what i wanted. haha.
3. What talent do you wish you had? singing. dancing. the latter i know i could be good at if i practiced. cause i was good. . . . until i stopped in middle school and haven't really done any of it since. :p 
4. Favorite place? the place doesn't matter as much as the person i'm with. or, depends on my mood or what i want to do. 
5. Favorite vegetable? hmmmm. . . .zucchini is yummy if it's cooked right. 
6. What was the last book you read? . . . . my vibrations book earlier this evening? that's what made me start thins thing. haha. if you mean novel, i was reading Dan Brown's Angels and Demons, but didn't get to finish cause school started and i had to start reading my text books. :p i hate having to put a book down for a long time, which is why i don't read novels often unless i have a really good chunk of time *like our breaks from school* where i can read the whole thing. i like having the option of continuing if i get to a really good part. 
7. What zodiac sign are you? scorpio.
8. Any Tattoos and/or Piercings? pierced ears. probably will get a navel piercing soon. i think spring is a good time to get it done, so i can wear loose clothing while it's healing.
9. Worst Habit? as of late, i've picked up picking/biting my hangnails. it's really gross, and i never used to do it. but sometimes i really get that bored in class. . . . .or i look for split ends in my hair. LOL. oi.
10. Do we know each other outside of Livejournal? yesum. but only since 6th grade. :) 
11. What is your favorite sport? to watch. . . . probably football if i had to pick. but i don't really watch anything when i'm in irvine cause i dont have any teams to root for and then it's not as fun. but at home i like watching and i just root for whatever teams my brothers want to win. :) playing. . . or i should say ""playing"" would be just running or swimming. 
12. Do you have a Negative or Optimistic attitude? more negative as of late. 
13. What would you do if you were stuck in an elevator with me? oh, we'd find a LOT to do. . . haha. and just talk. cause we seem to be good at that. talk/complain. :D
14. Worst thing to ever happen to you? uhhhhhhhhhhh
15. Tell me one weird fact about you. i can spread all of my toes out in a way that, apparently, no one else i know of can. and my pinky toe can wiggle independently. hahaha. 
17. Do you know how to do the Macarena? i think i can recall it if i tried. but i really don't want to. 
18. What time is it where you are now? 11:29.
19. Do you think clowns are cute or scary? i'm impartial.
20. If you could change one thing about how you look, what would it be? i'd wish to be able to keep my body when i'm ""fit"" and not have to do the whole upkeep thing. hahahaha. if i had to pick a specific feature to change, i think i'd say i'd want longer legs. 
21. Would you be my partner in crime or my conscience? depends. i can be both. :) hahaha
22. What color eyes do you have? brown. randy says they're ""poo brown"".
23. Ever been arrested? nope
24. Bottle or Draft? wouldn't know
25. If you won $10,000 dollars today, what would you do with it? spend some, save some. 
26. What kind of bubble gum do you prefer to chew? orbit?
27. What's your favorite bar to hang at? don't have one.
28. Do you believe in ghosts? sometimes yes, sometimes no. 
29. Favorite thing to do in your spare time? uhhhhhhhhh. . . . depends?

"event","so, i'm actually updating this. i don't know why, i just felt like doing something with my lj. i changed up my info a tiny bit just to make it a little more current. i realized that it might be a good idea when i saw that it still said my sn was ""bugiemu"" and my e-mail addy was ""lelopples@aol.com"". i'm surprised it didn't go as far back as meowinz@aol. lol. ah, my random screennames and such. :p well, things are coming up quickly, and i'm starting to get scared about the testing and stuff. this determines everything coming up for me. and i haven't studied as well as i should have been. and i keep telling myself that i'll buckle down, and when i get to irvine, i'll have a full 11 days to just study because there's not much else for me to do anyways. but still. i have to study more now too. it's not too hard to relearn, but i'm not going to know it if i don't take a look at it. i have to start taking control of things. get off my lazy butt. there's so many things i should do before i go, so many things that seem to need to be done, but none of it really seems important for some reason. example, getting my watch battery changed and the band adjusted. if i can find the watch, now that i think about it. i don't even know where i put it. sometimes i think i'm not going to be able to make that transition that i want to into a hard worker."

<img src=""http://images.quizilla.com/T/Tatiyana/1065842131_twater-sm2.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""You are WATER""><br><b> YOU ARE WATER! </b><p>
Your inner element is one of great compassion and<br>love. You are an extremely kind-hearted person<br>who tends to care more about helping others<br>than themselves at times. You gravitate to<br>people who need help or just a shoulder to cry<br>on and you provide them with the support they<br>need. You harbor an intense compassion for<br>others that is truly admirable. You are an<br>incredibly easy-going person who just goes with<br>the flow and tries to be comfortable no matter<br>what. You tend to collect things, little<br>reminders or memories of time gone past. Any<br>career that will allow you to help others in<br>any way is ideal for you. Love is a essential<br>element in your life, and your search for the<br>one and only for you is paramount to all<br>things. The one you choose with have to be<br>loyal, honest, and able to share their emotions<br>with you.<br>
Your greatest strengths are your ability to bond<br>with others and help them through the tough<br>times. Your weaknesses are your tendency to get<br>overly emotional on things and drive those you<br>care about away with your emotional outbursts.<br>Balancing your strengths and weaknesses is<br>crucial for you to achieve balance in your<br>life.<br>
Astrologically, Water is associated with the signs<br>of Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces. You are most<br>compatible for either love or friendship with<br>another Water Elemental or with an Earth. You<br>are least compatible with a Fire Elemental.<p>

"event","awww, Footloose is over. . . .it was fun, and it turned out pretty good *kind of*. we all had our doubts. . . but it worked *again. . .kind of.*! hehe. i mean, taking into account how little time we really did it in and everything. . . how long did we work on it? a whole. . . 2 months or something. how sad. fun stuff though, i'm gonna miss it. i'm all bruised because i'm so damn clumsy and was bumping into things while moving a bunch of stuff around backstage *being stage crew and all* and scratched up from the bales of hay. . . but it's all in good fun. :) hehe. you know, in the past 2 weeks, i had gotten a max of 5 hours of sleep, so you can guess what i was like today. . . i slept in until 2:00. wow. that was a first. before than, the latest i'd slept in was about. . .11 or 11:30ish. i didn't think it was possible to sleep that late. but i did it. hehe. but it was a good tired. i loved it. i'm gonna miss it. and it's sad, because i know next year i'm not going to be able to have the same opportunity. like, last year, when the play was over, i was like. . . next year i am DEFINITELY going to do it again. but i can't. :( not with these people at least. *sniff* i'm gonna miss them all!!!

everyone was sooo good, especially the friday night show! it was an almost flawless performance. loved it! even if we didn't have the spotlight! haha, who needs it! *we were thinking of just getting a huge flashlight. . . or a bunch of small ones. . . buuut, it's okay, it worked without it. :)* band, sounded great too, mikes. . .MUCH better than the day before. and then the gunderson cast was there last night. they LOVED natasha *props to her!* very cool. 

i could talk for a loooong time about the show. but so i don't make you fall asleep, i'll just put it as simply as possible. it was GREAT! hehe. i was happy. 

after the show, however, i didn't end up going to the cast party. :p oh well. i was SUPPOSED to go with my friends out to eat. .. but of course, like always, everyone that was supposed to come flaked out except for vivien. it was cool though. 

i loved last night!!! okay, i'll stop talking. hehe. but it's just like, THATS the kind of stuff i love. this is why i don't care about school as much, cuase i want THIS. i don't want to be sitting at a desk punching out numbers. . .*stupid integrals and derivative crap*. . .i want to be up, actually DOING stuff.

anyways, just a little synopsis of what went on last night. fun fun."

"event","dah! of course, i decide to write instead of doing my homework. . .kristen's fault! she inspired me to write! 

today has been good and bad. i just feel so. . .mixed up right now. school was just school. after school was cool though. right after, mike and cindy came over cause we needed to do our stock project for tomorrow *of course, we have to wait until the last minute, right?* so, they were supposed to leave by 6, cause i needed to eat, shower, print the program, burn 3 CD's, pick 3 people up, and get to school, by 7. they didn't leave until 6:20. . .sooo, rushing!! i ended up not eating, printing the program, or burning the CD's. . . and i have to say i had a half-assed shower. me thinks i need to shower again. i feel dirty again. :p lol. ah well. i like the hectic-ness. i don't know, it makes me feel. . . accomplished. . .*not quite sure if that was the best word choice* i guess. it feels good to be busy. especially when it's doing things you like. i liked rehearsals because we actually did stuff too. yay. and i know what i'm doing now. hehe, annnnd, i found out how to use the lights. yay! cool cool. like i said already, i love being busy with things i love doing. 

it annoys me that some people don't take pride in the muscial. it's like, you signed up, do it right. and then they still fish for the credit. it annoys me so much! *kristen, you know what i'm talking about. . .you were there tonight!. . .and then the whole OTHER thing too* i swear, i just wanted to scream! i have never felt so peeved off at a stupid thing. it's like, why not? what are you doing here if you don't want to be here? i hate that people keep saying that they want to drop the class, that it's boring. . then, when something fun comes up, all of a sudden, they love it. see, there's the people like that, and then there's the other type of person. the type of person who knows that there are parts where it isn't that fun, it's pretty boring, but once you get into it, that's the best thing. i've LOVED this week because of rehearsals. it feels good to be doing this kind of thing again. 

i mean, i know i don't have that big of a part. i'm only stage crew after all. but still, i think i do my share. i figured out when the curtains need to close, which curtains, what needs to be set up and when. . . helped hala with the lights *a LITTLE bit. . .only a tad!!!*, and i'm doing the program with ewusi. *props to her for making the cover!* so yah. i duno, i think it's going okay overall. a lot better than what i expected. of course, there are still a few people who don't really want to be there be there. it's like they aren't in it for the fun, and they don't have the same passion for it. and it's just like, why are they here, why are they trying to take over my job when they don't even want it? there's no point in trying to take it away. just for the sake of having it, or what? 

sorry, i'm just blabbing on about nothing. it's really nothing important. i don't think it's something i should even be getting worked up over. but it still bugs me. especially with what we talked about kristen. see, now you can empathize instead of sympathize. you understand. :p i hate it!

but other then that stupid stuff, everything's been cool. i guess i just feel kind of possessive over it all. :p

Drr. . . stupid program isn't working for me!!! i can't space them right and stuff. . .this might take a lot longer than i thought!!! damn!

well, i guess i better go. . .actually DO my homework. . .oops. haha. that. ugh. i'll write more later.

*of course instead of doing homework after rehearsals, i decide to go somewhere. smart me. :p*"

"event","i really shouldn't be writing right now. i have so much work to do still. . . oh well. i'll make it short. 

a warning. this is a pretty personal entry. so if you don't want to get inside my head, or be confused, or what-not i suggest not reading it. in fact, i just suggest to everyone to not read it. but you know, it's really up to you. it's out there. you make the choice.

the past few weeks have kind of sucked. all school aspects at least. all this crap is going on, which i will not get into detail about, and i just feel like i'm losing it. i don't think i can stand it much longer unless i have a break. weekends are such a relief now, it's the only time i get away from the stress, but it isn't long enough. it goes SO fast, and even as early as the end of monday, i'm already longing for another weekend. it isn't really school work and stress type stuff. i don't really know what it is. it's just me. i don't feel motivated for school. it's like i'm in a rut, and am so overwhelmed that i don't even know where to start in order to get out. it doesn't feel like i ever will.

of course, there are times when i feel relief from it all. certain people can help make the feeling go away. but it's all just temporary, a quick fix. as soon as they're gone, the feeling comes flooding back. Unfortunately, there are only a couple people who can do this, and they are the people i don't get to see as often. 

one of them knows who they are, i talked to them earlier tonight. i just want to say thanks for everything. i don't mean to get all sappy, but you're my support right now. there aren't many people i can trust in every possible way, but you are one of them. it's like. . .for lack of a better metaphor, if i fall down into a group of ""friends"", you would be the only one to care. everyone else would look up casually and see me fall, but you would be the one running to catch me and make sure i'm okay. i love that you help me without holding my hand every step of the way. you know the difference between sympathy and empathy, and you don't try to empathize when you know you can't. if you don't understand what i'm going though *which isn't often!* then you don't act like you know. you aren't fake. you don't lie to me. you don't try to gain trust without giving trust in return. you know how to be a true friend. i feel like i can open my entire soul up to you, and you wouldn't tell a single living being about the secrets that i hold. you wouldn't even think about doing such a thing. thanks again for everything.

However, some other people have been disappointing me. it isn't a certain incident or anything, it's just an overall feeling. i don't know how much friendship really means to them. i don't know how much i can trust them. i hesitate to let them in, and there are certain things that i want to keep from them. with these people, i feel that there are things that are too personal to share with them. i feel this way because i always have a doubt about them in the back of my mind. i don't know why, i just do. i just don't feel the sincerity in their friendship and their words. they'll say one thing, and act on another. but by feeling this way, i just feel so untrustworthy. If I can't trust them, why should they trust me? shouldn't i being giving them the benefit of the doubt? i mean, they're my friends. i don't know. . . 

i love this song right now. it just seems so appropriate. Not physically, but mentally.

Evanescence - Tourniquet

I tried to kill the pain,
But only brought more.
I'm dying, And I'm pouring, crimson regret, and betrayal.

I'm dying, 
Praying, 
Bleeding, 
and Screaming.

Am I too lost to be saved ?
Am I too lost ?

My God! My Tourniquet,
Return to me salvation.
My God! My Tourniquet,
Return to me salvation.

Do you remember me ?
Lost for so long.
Will you be on the other side ?
Will you forgive me ?

I'm dying, 
Praying, 
Bleeding, 
and Screaming.

Am I too lost to be saved ?
Am I too lost ?

My God! My Tourniquet,
Return to me salvation.
My God! My Tourniquet,
Return to me salvation.

(Return to me salvation)
(I want to die!)

My God! My Tourniquet,
Return to me salvation.
My God! My Tourniquet,
Return to me salvation.

My wounds cry for the grave.
My soul cries, for deliverance.
Will I be denied ?
Christ! Tourniquet! My suicide.

I just feel so much confusion and pain, and i can't figure out why. it makes me depressed to think about it, and the more i think about it the more i become more unhappy with myself. i need help to get out of my own mind. i need a savior. but it seems that nothing is working because i'm buried too deep in my own thoughts, and i can't leave. i just wish that these thoughts would go away, that they would die, so i can go back to being me again. but, even if these thoughts end up disappearing, there will always be the memory of it. there is no way for me to go back to the way i was. time changes life, and there is no reversal. 

enough of that. i thought this was supposed to be a short entry. ah well. it's okay. . . i guess. it just means that i have to stay up even longer *that was really smart of me*

i need more lighthearted things in my life right now. everything is just so serious, deep, emotional. . .you name it. i just need some pure stupidness and/or fun. pointless. .. slapstick. . . just something. something where i don't have to think. that'd be nice."

"event","just got back from seeing chris in footloose. their school is doing the same musical as us!!! dah!. . . i have to say though, i think they did better than we will. we have what. . .two weeks. . .and we aren't even close to finishing. we haven't even started on sets! ;last year we started those in oct. and didn't get done until like. . .less than a week before the play opened. and we're still on the first act . . .in terms of learning blocking/choreography and stuff. . . and i don't think everyone has even started memorizing lines. . . pleh. oh well, we'll get there eventually. . .hopefully in time! 

i kind of remember why i wanted to be in it at the beginning now. i always get this feeling when i watch live performances. . .of pretty much any kind. . . it's like. . .i want to do that. i want to be up there and be having fun like that. that's why with some things, i can't watch them. sometimes i just can't enjoy the show because i want to be doing it so badly. it's not so much a feeling that i want to be up there. . .on stage. it's more of. . .i want to be the one that helped put it all together. . . the one that made it happen. . .the one that made it what it is.

the musical was pretty well put together. . .actually, the idea of the white sheet backdrop worked really well, no need for anything elaborate or anything. that kind of stuff can take away from the characters and stuff anyways. and during scene changes. . .the blue lighting was cool. . .i mean, everyone already knows that people are moving things around and stuff, so there's no use in trying to cover it up with closing the curtains and bla bla bla. it was cool cause it was just the silhouettes. . .cool effect. different. the set up of everything was good. very well done. :)

dude!!! chris can SING! he was sooo good! *props to chris!!!* and he made such a good dad. . . hehe. my favorite was when he messed up one of his lines. . .something along the lines of ""if they aren't trustworthy, then they cannot be. . .trustworthy."" haha. then he kind of rolled his eyes. . .good job! it worked though. most people don't catch those kinds of mistakes anyways. oh and, i liked the little dance at the end. very entertaining. . .and then the wig. . . *shakes head*. . . don't know what you were thinking. . . .haha. but for some reason. . .it works on chris. chris can make anything work. haha. anyways. . .good job on the musical Shaw!"

"event","all this college stuff is really getting to me. . . i just want to know i at least have A college to go to. so far. . . nothing good. but only from two. *like i even had a chance to get into UCLA anyways!* the one that's really pissing me off is irvine. they said they'd be done with everything by the 15th. it's the 19th now!!!! and where's my app? it's still being reviewed. hmm. . .*scratch scratch*. something doesn't seem right there. i'm not the only one who hasn't gotten anything yet though. . . soooo. the more they're making me wait, the more i think i'm rejected. :p why didn't i apply to riverside or santa cruz? then i'd at least have SOMEWHERE to go for sure. stupid!! *smacks self* i'm just like, let me in! anywhere!! i'm waay too impatient for all of this. . .i'm sitting here, checking like. . .20 times a day *okay, so a LITTLE bit exaggerated. . .hehe*. . .aggrh!! the stress!!!

i like how today in musical theater roderigez asks me to block the scenes. *cause i do nothing. . . hehe.* it was kind of weird, cause i was with yily and ashlie, but he said he wanted me and i don't know who *i didn't hear it because ashlie was talking too. . . i think it was. . .kevin?? i don't know a kevin from drama. . . oh well, whatever.* to block. very random. but it ended up being me, with a piece of paper and a pen, having noo idea what i was doing. i wrote like. . .3 things on it. ""1 chair stage left"". that kind of crap. suure. i was so confused! it would have helped if i knew what they were doing. . . i still have no idea what the musical is about *i mean, i know the general idea. . .which btw is pretty stupid. . .but that's about it.* so that didn't help. i didn't know what scene they were in. . .what they were supposed to do. . .bla bla bla. . . oh well. he probably just wanted to make us do something. i mean, i don't know what he expected; he didn't want me to block the characters or anything, but just the props. the entire time, they only had one chair. . . it moved from stage left to center stage, then back to stage left again. wow. that was hard work. haha.

randy comes home tomorrow :) yay!! i miss him so much!! last time i saw him was. . . .winter break?? woooww. . .wait. . .he came back sometime after i think. . . oh well, doesn't matter. he's coming tomorrow :) hehe. and then roger is coming over the weekend sometime i think. double yay! i'm such a dork. . . i get it from randy :) hehehe. it's all his fault!

this whole war thing sucks. yup. war now. . . what else can i say about that? i think it's kind of stupid because here we are, war and all, and i know nothing. i'm so clueless about everything, and it doesn't seem to phase me very much. it still feels so distant. but it's not. sometimes i think we shouldn't be involved at all. 9/11 was a poor excuse for all of this. america, the peacemakers. . . the police of the world. yah. right. and this whole extravaganza is going to prove it, won't it. *please note the sarcasm. . * in class we discussed the topic. . econ and english actually. i liked the discussion in english a LOT better. in econ, it was more of people trying to show how much they knew about reports in the news and stuff more than their real thoughts on the subject. like someone brought up the whole thing about changing the name of french toast and french fries. what's the point of that? how does that have to do with your feelings about the war? in english it was cool, because no one was trying to impress everyone else with their knowledge or anything. they just said what they felt. 

i like hearing other people's thoughts on things. . . cause it's one way to think what you think. . .but someone else might see it in a completely different light. something that you might not have even imagined. i love hearing what other people think. but i think it's stupid when they get so defensive over their thoughts. . being all close-minded and everything. it's like, you know, i understand that you have your own opinions, but at least listen to other people. is it really that hard just to hear what other people think? it's not like you have to agree with them. . .

dude, calc is going to suck until the AP test is over. . .lesse. . .we just had a test yesterday. . .going to have another on tues, and after that we start reviewing with DAILY quizzes. . . uuugh. and then we have our 4 day long final *again. . .uuugh* and THEN we have the AP test. wow. that sucks. why did i stay in calc again? and the stupid AP test. . .$80 this year. damn.

so much stuff to pay for. . .being a senior is expensive!!!! AP test, SB tickets and everything else that comes with going to SB *dress. . . well, i wanted to go in pj's, but of course there has to be a damn dress code :p FORMAL dance. fiiiine. shoes, accesories. . .i'll try to use stuff i already have of course. hair/makeup/nails. . .but of course, i'm not going to get THAT girly. . .i think i'll skip all that. . .cept maybe the hair. . . cause i'm not gonna be able to do it myself. and whatever other stuff there is* . . . then there's grad night *my mom practically forced me to go. . .i was like, but barely anyone else is going!!! and she's like. . .well, they'll change their minds, i'll buy the ticket anyways. . .cause she knows that if she spends the money, i'm not going to let it go to waste. . . but it turned out okay, turns out that more people are going then i thought. and i got some other people to go too :)* and THEN there's BFD *yay!!!!*. not that i HAD to go to that or anything. . . but i mean, come on!! well, actually i want to knowthe lineup first. . .but i'm sure it's good. :) i'm surprised my mom was okay with me going. usually she's like i don't know. . . she thinks i'm gonna die in a mosh pit or something, i swear. *of course, that is why i kind of left out that little detail. . . doo doo doo*. hehe. but yah. expensive year!!! i feel bad spending all this money. . i don't do anything to earn it all. like i've said before, i'm so freaking spoiled.

agh! i hate calc!! i don't understand any of the hw. . . attempting to do it right now. you know, maybe it would help if i stopped talking online and stuff. i've been on soo much lately. but see, i go on because i have to use it for school *econ requires a lot of online time actually. . .researching companies, articles. . .* and then i always stay on and talk to people. haha. that's my lame excuse. *slaps hand* bad! get away from the keyboard! focus on studies!! *haha, that's funny. like that's gonna happen. . .* hehe. no, but seriously, i need to do my hw now. :p as much as i don't want to. . .i can't procrastinate anymore. not tonight at least."

"event","*although i'm listening to konstantine, i think a MORE appropriate song would have been ""the most depressing song"". oh well. 

*WARNING: contains utterly pointless dribble on stupid, depressing topics which don't really mean anything but is there just because i had all these random things in my head that needed to come out.*

i have never, in my entire life, been as depressed as i am right now. life just sucks completely. today sucked. the entire week sucked. i can't think of anything that i was happy about past mon afternoon *kristen!!!* everything just seems to be falling apart. i don't feel motivated at all to do work for some classes, and this year has been a huge dissapointment. senior year is supposed to be the fun year, right? well, that's definitely not true. it isn't even as good as the years before. it's worse. that's not right! and we have to spend soo much money for everything! this past week i've realized that by the end of the month i need to have paid $80 for an AP test *they raised the prices on those!* $130 for senior ball *last year wasn't it in the 80's? what the hell happened??? we have no money.* and then there's $75 for grad night *if i end up going because practically no one else wants to because of the price. . . or other reasons which i will not get into right now.* it's crazy. i'm not made of cash over here. i'm sorry if i'm not one of those people who can guiltlessly spend all of daddy's money. i mean, if you're going to spend a lot, at LEAST get a job. or, better yet, don't spend so much! man, just looking at how much i have to pay for this crap makes me think i really need a job. it's not fair that i'm not doing anything to help pay for anything. i feel. . . no no, i AM completely spoiled. 

the fact that i'm so spoiled makes me even more pissed. . .at myself. i mean, how can i be so depressed and unhappy with everything when i have so much? i have EVERYTHING. my family, *from what people say, my family is the closest to the ""perfect family"" that they've seen. how can you not be happy with that?. . .and i admit. . . they are. my parents are still SUCH a couple. they still go on dates and everything. every so often, my mom will be all smiling and she'll tell me at dinner, ""your dad and i are going on a lunch date tomorrow"".* that's another thing. we always eat dinner together still too. most families don't do that anymore. and then, both of my parents are always home *dad has his home office*, so i always have them close by. . . we always take these little family outings, and we see our relatives a LOT. we're always taking trips together. very tight knit family. i love it. and my brothers are so cool. they're the best. :) i mean, everyone is just. . .perfect. my friends, great. the best. my parents spoil me to the point where there is nothing left for me to want. *okay, a car. . . but that's beside the point! i don't need that though, so it's okay. see, they don't buy me a car, but i can use the highlander whenever i want. sooo it's pretty much like my own car.* i couldn't ask for anything else. and yet, i'm still depressed. why? i don't even know why. it's just. . .everything i guess. nothing feels right. nothing feels normal. everything feels wrong. i feel awful about myself, and i can't even understand why people still want to be around me as much as they are. i guess i'm just annoyed at myself. who i am right now. 

i don't feel like i've accomplished much, and i'm not trying hard enough. and yet, even knowing this, i do nothing about it. i just wish there was some way i could get out of my head, where i could stop listening to myself and my thoughts, and just. . .not have to hear me. i'm sick of being around me. i'm not the person i want to be, and i'm not doing anything to become that person. i mean, yah, i see myself as a decent person. . . just not lately. especially to my friends. i never feel as if i focus my attention to them enough. a lot of times i just miss what they say, or it's like, there's two conversations going at once which i'm trying to listen to. it's like, these are your friends, give them some respect. show some courtesy. don't start taking them for granted. 

it sucks though. . . we have the rest of this year, and that's it. after that, i don't get to see all of them everyday anymore. it's sad. we're all going to different places. . .some VERY far away too! *why do you want to go to the east coast?!?!?!* it's like, you just have to get as much in NOW as you can, before you lose it. i know i'm going to be SO happy when we graduate. . .i can't wait to get out of this school. . . but at the same time, i don't want to leave. and there's some people who you don't see outside of school. . .all of those people, you might not ever see again. 

i need to stop thinking of those things. . .joy making myself think of MORE depressing things. you know, i never really thought THAT much about the whole leaving thing. . .of course, now i am. great, so life sucks because i don't like myself, everything is changing, we're all leaving each other. . . STRESS FROM COLLEGE LETTERS!!!!!!!!!!!! ahhh!!!!!!! stupidness. . .this really does suck.

enough of that stuff. . ."

*sniff* it's raining outside. . . really hard. i want to go play in the rain. but i can't. man, i'm such a little kid. . . haha. rain is fun though. especially when it's pouring. if it's just sprinkling, that's not very fun. . . there needs to be like. . .total downpour. or hail! hail is cool. . . *like that one time when we walked to bret harte. . . * haha. it was hailing, and so we caught it on our jackets and stuff. of course mine wasn't waterproof though, so when the hail melted, it would just soak into my jacket. oops. haha. all in good fun. i am soooo tempted to just go and run outside right now. *must restrain self. . . .* maybe if i don't pay attention to it. . . and if i stop looking outside! *moving away from window. . . can still hear rain. . . want to go outside still. . . .*"

"event","oooh. . .the song i'm listening to is pretty. . . got it from vivien :) *she drew a really cool piece that was inspired by this song. . .very cool. . . .vivien is so talented! props to you!*

well, this week has been pretty. . .sucky. first stock project presentation tomorrow. oh joy. :p mike and cindy came over today for that. most of the time we were just talking about stuff instead of working on the project *oops!*, but we got it done. that's all that really matters. hehe.

well, i don't really have anything specific to write about, so here's just a bunch of random things that have been floating around my head. . .

monday was funny!. . .of course, i have to prove how much of a loser i can really be by telling everyone about my loser-ness. well, anyways, so i'm with kristen *my other dork-ness half. . .hehe* in the car. we just got the crappy goodness of mcdonalds. so we're on the way home, eating fries *mmmm* and for some reason. . .a superhero is born! Fry McFry and his sidekick, FRENCHIE! *note that these are both french fries* . . . however, our superhero's episodes were cut short due to certain mishaps. . . .kristen!!! stop eating the actor!!! replacement!!!. . .we need another replacement!!! *everyone reading this slowly starts to back away from the computer and vows never to talk to me ever again.* i swear, i don't belong in a mental institute. honestly. lol. but i must say. . .the highlight of the day would have to be *talking about st. patrick's day . . . while i'm wearing a green shirt by the way* ""well, i don't have ANY green shirts!"" and i don't even notice my mistake until kristen tells me that my shirt is green. yes, i do pay attention to my wardrobe. really. . . can i just smack myself right now? i will admit. . .my stupidness can bring many laughs. . . it has. . . all at my dignity's expense. but that's okay. no one needs dignity anyways!. . .and grace. . .none of that is needed either. 

sometimes i really think i should learn indonesian. it kind of frustrates me that i can't understand my family *the adults at least* when they speak indonesian. . .i just think it'd be so much easier if i could speak indonesian too. i mean, they can also speak english. . .but of course it's easier for them to speak indonesian, it being their first language and all, but it's like. . . i should probably learn SOME, so i can at least get the basics of what they're saying. cause as of now, i'm completely lost. and sometimes i think some of my mom's family forgets that i can't speak it. they look at me. . .and they start talking. . . and i'm standing there like an idiot staring blankly because i can't understand a single thing they're talking about. but i don't know if they're really talking to me, or about me. sooo yah. it's like they're talking to my mom ""so she's graduating this year?"" and i respond ""sorry. . .i don't speak indonesian."" yes. . .that'd be good. i need to wear some sign saying ""i do not understand indonesian. i can't speak it. i'm sorry, i cannot have a conversation with you unless it is in english because i have not taken the time out of my life to try and learn the language that my parents grew up with. why? because for some stupid reason i never really cared about really connecting with any indonesian culture *aside from its yummy food, haha*. yes, that was stupid of me, so sorry, but speak english to this americanized non-asian."" lol. that's pretty much it. i know a FEW words, but barely any of them are actually used in everyday conversation. the words i mainly know are the one my mom used when we were little because she didn't know the english words for them. some are kind of. . . inappropriate. :) not swear words or anything. . . but yah. haha. nevermind. i guess i just find it kind of sad that none of the younger generation can speak indonesian. ah well, i guess it's not THAT big of a deal. . . i mean, when am i going to be able to use it aside from talking with my parents/aunts/uncles? and i'd probably still speak with them in english even if i did know indonesian. *god, this was so random. i think i'll end this thought. i'm starting to over think it and i'm not making much sense anymore. actually, i haven't been making sense for awhile now.*

you know, i don't like me right now. i'm always up and down. . . there are times where i'm happy with who i am. . . and then there are times like these. . . where i hate being me. i feel like such a rude/obnoxious/annoying person, and i don't like being around me. there are certain times where i think differently than usual. . .and not in a good way. i don't really know how to explain it though. it's just not me. i guess i just don't like it because it's kind of like. . .you're supposed to know yourself, and you think you do, but sometimes you're not quite. . .you. you don't think the things you expect or something. i don't know. ah. forget trying to explain it. :p it just is what it is.

on a much lighter note. . .something i thought was very interesting. a couple days ago. physics. kenny. for some reason, we got into this whole. . .hand thing. my pointer finger is the size of his pinky. sad. my tiny hands. . .:p. and he has an x on his palm *he found one on mine too. . .but i lost it, whatever. i bet he was lying.* the x stands for. . .what was it? oh yes. xtra cool. lame, huh. keeny made that up, not me! it wasn't me, i swear! haha. dude. but it's hella weird. you know if you cut the circulation off of your hand it turns all pale? kenny's hand turned pale SOOOO fast. . .and it was all yellow and white and nasty and. . . dead like. soo cool. gross. but cool. i tried, but i can't do it. i duno. . .it's like i can't cut off my circulation well enough or something. i'm too weak! ah well. kenny. person with many many useless talents. useless. . . except for entertainment of easily amused people like me. haha.

it's kind of sad how clueless some people are. on the news, there was this thing on how this school let out their students to protest against war. they interviewed some of the students *high school* and they knew NOTHING. they didn't know things like who the leader of iraq was. and this was the worst. they asked a girl why she was so against the war on iraq. her response? ""well, we bombed iraq. . . "" uhhhh, so the reporter told her that we hadn't bombed iraq so she says ""oh. i mean, afghanistan. we bombed afghanistan, right?"" dear god!!!!! what is wrong with this world!?!?!?!? that's really sad. i mean, i know i'm pretty clueless about what's going on in terms of current events and stuff. . .but how in the world do you think that we've bombed iraq or afghanistan? *sigh* it's depressing how little some people can know about what's going on.

you know what i hate? i hate that i can't go anywhere. i mean, i can drive places and i can go out a lot with people, but sometimes i just want to go walk around outside. but i can't. my parents are waaaay too scared to let me go out like that. they're afraid i'll get kidnapped or murdered or something. hence the pepper spray and whistle that follow me around every time i go out. :p man. . .i just got that whistle cause it was small and cool. not for actual USE. but now my mom makes me take it everywhere with me. anyways, back to my point. sometimes i just want to go out and enjoy. . . being outdoors. i wish i could just walk to the park. . you know, just kind of wander around and think and stuff. i love being outside. and i love going to the trail at the park. at some places. . . it just looks sooo cool. like, at a certain spot, when the sun is setting. . . sooo cool. its like, you look out, and theres the lake right in front of you. and because of the sun, the water actually looks pretty. dark blue. clean. *even thought it's actually hella nasty* it sparkles. . . and it's a soft, almost dull sparkle *if that makes sense* because the sun isn't that bright when it's setting *all the pretty orange and stuff* then behind it, there's all the trees and hills and stuff, but because of the sun directly behind, they're just shadows, so it's basically an outline. and then right behind that there's the sky. and if the day is really good, there are those long, thin, wispy clouds all across the sky, and the light bounces off one half of the clouds while the other half is kind of a light grey/white. so the sky and the clouds are all colored with deep oranges, reds, purples. . pinks. it's like the perfect sunset. i love that i can see all of it from this one spot so close to home. it's just so peaceful. but of course, i can't go there because of all the dangers of a teenage girl being out all alone. . . :p stupidness. i hate this feeling of being stuck. i can't go running outside either. if i want to run. . . i have to go to the gym and use the treadmill. running outside is sooo much nicer. it sucks though, cause lately there's something inside me that is just begging to go. i love being outside and being able to enjoy my surroundings, but doing something at the same time. i can't just sit there and stare for hours. i'm too antsy for that. if i'm walking or running. . .then i'm good. but again, i can't. or biking. . i don't bike anymore. just something, you know? this whole side of me comes from my dad. :) hehe. he hikes all the time, i guess that's how he feeds his hunger for it. i mean, i admit, the treadmill was a great invention, but it just doesn't give you the same feeling as when you're running outside. 

well, enough of that. i really really need to go. sleep. study. something."

"event","weee, back again. well. some highlights of the week. note how instead of sleeping in all of these days, i decide to get up early. i mean, what's more important, seeing friends, or being able to function correctly? hehe. 

well, tues a bunch of us went to breakfast. yum yum. hehe. then we went back to my place and. . . for lack of anything better to do, we helped vivien fix her waxing job on her car. IT WAS REALLY BAD< OKAY! hehe. *no offense to vivien or anything. . . but she knows it too!. . .  that is why she asked us to help after all. hehe. it looked like. . .well, like there was wax all over the car. lots of streaks and stuff. so yah. *one of my favorite pastimes is helping people wax their cars. . . jk jk! hehe.* then after school yily and myself took a little trip to the beauty supply store to get danny hair dye. i have to admit, that's the first time i've actually been in one and really looked around and stuff. of course, i didn't know what most of the stuff was or did. hehe. we spent sooo long in there. yily was debating whether or not she should dye her hair. so we were trying to pick out a cool color. what's a good color to put on brown hair like hers? her hair is pretty light. . . like, to tint it or something. personally, i like red, but my hair is dark. hmmm. she almost got blue, but then she changed her mind. :p

wed. danny's b-day! i woke up early to inflate balloons for danny before i picked her up, but my helium tank started dying on me! hehe. i think we've been playing with that too much. but helium is fun! who cares if it kills brain cells! haha. well, i guess that tank is dead now. . .anyways, people came over in the morning and we were all just a bunch of lazy bums. donuts *mmmmm, more food* and tv! haha. oh, and you can't forget the hot chocolate. that's some good stuff right there. with those marshmallows. . . doo doo doo. . . lol. i like how danny let's evan go home, then, once he gets home, we call him and tell him to come back. we're not trying to make him waste gas, really!

thurs. we went out to lunch for danny's b-day because we had more time than we did on wed. apparently not enough time though. hehe. i missed calc completely. oops. actually, i could have gone for a whole. . .minute or so, but there really wasn't a point. *if classes had been longer, instead of the pointless 15 min that they were, then maybe i would have made it to class!* oh well. i didn't get a call or anything, and we had a sub that day, so no biggy. if i DO need to clear it, i'll just say we had car problems or something on the way back from lunch. well, we did kind of have problems. . .getting out of downtown. hehe. there were a lot of closed roads! detours! detours! :p
then that night. . .kristen! hehe. stupid starlite sign. . . .make it bigger! so maybe we can actually SEE it? that'd be nice. but yah. and we were sooo worried about being late *we were what, 1/2 hour late or something* but we were stll the first ones there. *sigh* tsk tsk. apparently there are a lot of people who aren't very punctual. we waited at least like. . .another 1/2 hour before anyone else showed up too. sorry that didn't turn out very well kristen. . . all the confusion, bla bla bla. . . but at least we got to spend some time together, right?

fri we went to the tech museum. hehe. i still think it's fun! *sniff* all the childhood memories there. . . designing the bikes *they still have that!!! that was the best!* i think the best was our video though. the superman one. man, that was cool. really, i mean it. you should get that published! haha. yes, downtown again. of course, get lost again. two days in a row, i get lost downtown. with different people too! i like how we're looking for 85, and somehow the signs lead us to 880. that was great. and then we somehow just. . . magically ended up on 85 later on. . . that was good. i know you really meant to do that though. haha. 

aww, my stupid kitty. . . he's being all whiny-like, interrupting my thoughts and stuff. he wants attention. it is so sad, we get him one of those pet beds. . .a small doggie sized one too. . .and he just barely fits in it. shows how freaking fat he is. he could kill the neighbor's cat just by rolling over on it. but wait, that would take too much energy for him. haha. he sits on his ass all day; the only time he gets up is to stuff his face. :) my stupid, fat kitty. . . i wouldn't have him any other way. running into walls. . .tripping himself. . . eat, sleep, eat, sleep. yup. that's my kitty. isn't he cute? *yes*

it's kind of bad though. i've been going out so much lately, but that's cause i've had nothing for school. the thing is, 6 week grades come out soon i think, and my grades aren't that good. i've really been slacking off. . .and there hasn't been that much work in school for this semester yet. sooo, when that comes, of course my parents are going to say i go out too much. the whole speech on how i still need to work hard, and i need to keep my grades up because colleges still look at 2nd semester. . .that stuff. ah well. it's okay, i'll get my grades up before semester ends. :p

i don't know why i just wrote about everything i've done. . .what's the point? ah well. next time i'll write something worthwhile. . .hahaha, riiiight. like i EVER do that! hehe."

just to update. . . on a happier note. kristen, here we go, i dedicate this sentence to you because you told me to update. :) 

you know, i actually don't really feel like writing. . . because obviously i'm pissed at myself, and so i'm not in a very write-y mood. especially writing about myself. :p soo yah. well, at least it isn't too long for you to read. . .like usual."

aw crap. acceptances/rejections start coming the beginning of next month. i'm scared. . .i think davis or irvine is first to come? something like that. i just hope that UCSB comes in the latter half or so, because i know if i'm rejected from there, i'm rejected from all the others *saying as i didn't apply to UCSC or UCR. . .the only others lower than UCSB*. dang. i don't want to go to deanza! *crosses fingers* hope hope hope! . . . i guess if i don't get in i can always appeal to like. . .davis or something. i can probably get in by doing that. if i want to go there. i'm still so confused. i pretty much have my top choice, and that's it. dude, most people rank the UC's from highest to lowest. me? nope nope. too lazy. lol. jk. it'd be fun to go to UCSD. . .LOVE the location. . .but i don't think that's a good school for be. damn. give me the UCLA system/classes/etc. in san diego area, and i'm all set. hmm. roger says irvine is good. . and he said not to go to UCSB, cause it sucks. and it's a party school. but i hear it's progressing a lot more quickly than all the other UC's. and *even though it doesn't really alter my decisions much. . .but it's still a plus if i decide to go there* it has its own beach. hehe. but UCSB is the only campus i haven't seen. so i'll have to go check that out. haha, i have to contemplate EVERYTHING about each campus and put all of it into consideration. . .i'll see where i get in first. . . *nervousness* people HAD to go and remind me when letters start coming, didn't they. :p

oh, and i'm sure procrastinating *like always* is helping me prepare for college. have i done ANY hw for break? nope. oh wait, i have! *gasp!* that's something new. me? start hw early? something MUST be wrong!*feels forehead* hmmm. . .head feels a little bit warm. . . :p no, actually i don't have much to do. . .i wonder if we're presenting our projects in english tomorrow or if we're finishing the movie first. i have to fix that up. ah well, i might as well do that tonight. it's just bs work anyways. . .but then again, isn't it all?  

aww, roger went home this afternoon. *sniff* it always feels empty for a little while after he leaves. no one is hogging my computer all the time anymore. lol, jk! roger, the internet junkie. what do you do all that time anyways? all i see you do is check the nba stuff. . .that, or play monopoly. hahaha. well, i guess it's better than what i do. lesse. . .write in my pointless online journal. . . talk with people. . . yup, that's it. haha. oh yes, and NOT do my hw. do i really have anything to write about? nope. but i still do. i've been feeling like such a lazy ass lately. oh wait, that's right, that's because i am! 

yah, i'm not doing the musical anymore. i'm just going to do tech stuff or set stuff. i don't know if i'm going to be able to do tech or not, but i can try. at least i'll get some idea of how all of it works, even if all of our stuff is outdated. gotta start from somewhere. i just don't want to wait anymore. i feel like i haven't really been doing much to move in the direction i want to go, and so i might as well. especially because there isn't really a reason for me to be onstage anyways. i don't really want to be. 

also, i can't sing with roderigez teaching. i don't know, either he can't teach, or i'm just not used to it, or what. but honestly, does it really take an hour to learn 4 measures or something? i'd rather walk around aimlessly *like i've been doing :)*. choir is even worse. the damn clapping and crap. it's like vierra's snapping *twitch twitch*. how about instead of spending most of the time sight reading, we actually sing? *gasp* new concept! it is choir after all. and i used to be a lot better at finding notes. . .now i suck. he wants us to sing off of his voice instead of the piano. wtf is that? everyone thinks that's messed up. dude, you don't learn that way. it's hella messing me up. i haven't been able to sing well at ALL for the past. . . month or so. i swear, i sound like one of those horrible singers auditioning for american idol that everyone laughs at! pleh. not good. the thing is, it isn't just me. . . just ask danny!dude, and i feel bad, cause we asked people to join choir at the semester *because it was actually FUN then*. . .but now the class is shit, and they're already in it, so they're stuck. *hmm. . .must stop talking shit about stuff. . .no venting. . venting not good.*

there's already so many things i've been putting off, saying i'll start once i'm in college *drums for example. . . i regret that. i should have asked my parents if i could take that instead of guitar or something. . . cause i already know the basics for guitar and i could figure out songs by myself now. . . soooo, can i switch to drums? damn. but it's too late now.* and actually, i think i should have done bass instead of guitar. i mean, i want to eventually play them both *greedy me. . .*, but i think i should have started with bass. just because randy AND roger are both playing guitar already *longer than i have!* and it sucks always being behind them. it's like, i'm all happy because i figured out a new song, and roger comes home, picks up the guitar, and it's like. . . freaking overkill. ah well. personal gain. must think personal gain. haha. i duno, i guess it's kind of like i want something as my own instead of always having/doing the same things as them. but actually, i do have ""my own"" things. . . here i go, contradicting myself again. time to drop the subject before i drone on about nothing again. 

well, i REALLY need to start doing work. lol, it's already almost tomorrow. . .


The Starting Line - A Goodnight's Sleep

A better slumber
was in your arms 
was tangled up in you 
A sudden morning 
crashed in the room 
with an uninvited sudden change in you 

What can I say? 
Where's that girl from last night 
that slept on that side and looked just like you? 

You can sleep in your own bed tonight 
simple way 
a silent pain 
screaming out my name 

you can sleep in your own bed tonight 
i hope for your sake you dont wake up as broken as I am 

for a lack of better 
words to say 
all i said was goodnight 
once again it's self defense 
i wont sleep a wink 
to prevent dreaming of you 

You can sleep in your own bed tonight 
simple way 
a silent pain 
screaming out my name 

you can sleep in your own bed tonight 
i hope for your sake you dont wake up as broken as I am 

sleep in your own bed tonight 
i know some day that you will wake up as lonely as I am 

You can sleep in your own bed tonight

i know some day that you will wake up as lonely as I am 
Cause sleep works both ways

you know, i never really paid much attention to lyrics until recently. . .cause you know how a lot of people post lyrics? so i started looking at the lyrics of songs  i liked. it was funny though, because i had a conversation with roger about it. . .he's like me, we don't look at lyrics at ALL to make a good song. unless the lyrics are extremely bad, it doesn't really matter. but actually, a lot of people look at lyrics a lot when looking for good songs. do lyrics really matter that much in a song? i guess i never really thought about it before. like i don't even know  the lyrics to most of my favorite songs. . .mainly i look at lyrics when i'm listening to music while writing my online journal. like, if i can relate to the lyrics, or i have a good understanding of what they're talking about, then i'll post them. just cause. and basically, all of them are meaningful. i mean. . .unless it's the manufactured crap. because most bands just write what they're feeling. . . or things they've gone through. . . or stuff. . .so yah. i say, as long as it's something that means something to them, then it's cool. the only time i don't like lyrics is when the artist is just looking for something to sell instead of writing from the heart. 

ah, i'm not making sense again. i really need to start writing again. i can't put my thoughts down in writing very well anymore. i used to be able to do it so other people could understand what i was talking about. but now it just sounds like gibberish. it's really sad, i haven't been doing a lot of my hobby-type things lately. i need to start doing those things again. i miss them all!! must make time for those :) lol, maybe i should do those things instead of writing crap over here that makes no sense!!"

Tell one memory from each grade.

==PRESCHOOL== Making the hats out of paper plates *the guys' were made out of paper bowls* and then we had to dance. . . my parents have on tape two guys coming up and asking me at the same time. . haha, the only time EVER that i will ever see two guys fighting over me. . . didn't i feel special. hahahaha. actually, it was probably cause if not, they'd have to dance by themselves. . . and i remember matt *one of the two guys*. according to randy, my ""boyfriend"". i have a question. . .how do you have a boyfriend in preschool?!?! what ever happened to him anyways? from what i remember, he was hella smart. . .was in one of roger's math classes sometime in middle school. . .and went to some really good college. ah well. 

==KINDERGARTEN== Cathy. She wanted to feel the kitty on my fuzzy shirt, and it tickled, so we were sent to corners for disrupting the class. . . then at recess she said sorry, and we went and played. . . ah yes, kindergarten friendships. so simple.

==THIRD== totems!!! i was the bottle nosed dolphin. . . 

==FOURTH== getting into trouble cause a girl said i accused her of stealing my pencil. she brought it up in one of our class thingys where we ""worked out problems between classmates"". all i did was ask if she saw my pencil, i swear. but yah, so there was this whole thing in front of the entire class how she said i blamed her for my lost pencil and bla bla bla. . .oh yah, and my ocelot report. daniel and nathan weren't a very good audience! they kept interrupting me. . . ah yes, i do remember a quote. . .""can they swim? good, cause they're surrounded by water."" *referring to the entire continent being surrounded by water. . . yes, smart 4th graders. . actually, i think it was just nathan and daniel. jk!*

==FIFTH== not having to take math. :) we were learning stuff i learned in 3rd grade! so luckily, i got out of it, and instead i got to TA for my old 1st grade teacher!!!. . . the 1st graders were as tall as me. . .*sniff*i was so short!! i remember it cause every time they saw me they would run over *cause they were like. . wow, we get to hang out with a FIFTH grader!!* and then Mrs. Rail couldn't find me cause i was just as small as them. and i got to make the food again! ah yes, 1st grade all over again. jk!

==SIXTH== Got to see Cathy again! weee. . . and meeting karen. she was in 5 of my 6 classes. hehe. then there was kristen. . .erin. . .lauren. . . the spoons!! and the forks and caprisuns *shakes head* oh yah, and i think this was the year where tommy was in my science class and he stole a beanie baby from mrs. witt.

""well, i know you're from the lie family, but i mean THE lie family?"" ""yup."" ""i mean like, randy. . .roger. . ."" ""yah."" ""oh really."" *funny looks from the rest of the class* ""she's my neighbor."" hehe. ah yes, and the hair. . .blowing in the wind as he runs. . . with a fan in hand. . .and westside story. fun stuff. *notice how all the high school memories have to deal with actual school work? the others were about friends. . .no no. now its just about school work.*

==TWELFTH== ummm. . . saying as though i'm still in it. . .

==SCHOOL AFTER HIGH SCHOOL== N/A

==DESCRIBE TWO MEMORABLE BIRTHDAY PARTIES OF YOURS== hmm. . .i liked the last one. that was fuuuun. *thanks to vivien for taking us to lunch!. . .and thanks to ashlie for getting us free movies!* and then the other one would be. . .i forgot waht year. but i just remember it cause we have it on tape. its the one where randy is taping us, and me, being the conceited little girl i was, kept yelling out ""it's my birthday! randy, look at me! it's my birthday!"" haha. and instead he would video tape his feet while he was walking. . .i don't know. and then there was ashley. that was my favorite. she looks at the camera and says, ""you're not REALLY taping this are you?. . .cause if you are. . . i'm really stupid."" lol!

==DESCRIBE GETTING YOUR DRIVERS? LICENSE== it was okay. everyone told me if i get the asian guy, i'd pass. i got him. so, i passed. haha.

==DESCRIBE A FUN VACATION YOU?VE TAKEN== hawaii!! we did practically everything. . .except snorkeling. and that's what everyone always asks if you did. no. . but i did get to parasail, jet ski *randy. . .almost kill me!* , body board, surf *fuuun. and it's a lot easier than i thought it would be*. . .bla bla bla. . . weee. fun stuff.

==WHAT CITIES HAVE YOU LIVED IN?== San Jose. can you tell i've moved a lot? 

==HOW DID YOU MEET ALL YOUR FRIENDS?== umm. . .school. or through other people. except for ashley. i think she's the only one i've met in another way. the whole being born thing. . .you know.

YOUR PAST

==ACTIVITIES== dance, swim team, cross country, guitar, singing. i can't remember any others. .. unless they were really short lived. or, they just weren't very important. hopefully drums will be added soon :)

==PETS== midnite. and i know we used to have a kitty when i was really little. . . kimmy. that was it. oh! and roger had two turtles. . mom killed them. then we froze them for years and years. gross. actually we froze one. *sigh* i guess i have to explain now, huh. okay, they had a nice little home, sand . . .water. . .but then my mom read this turtle book and thought they were the swimming turtles. . .like the ones with flippers instead of claws. so she puts them in a container with just one rock. one turtle stayed on the rock forever and never ate, so it died. the other one had to swim forever, and got lonely when the other had died, so it died too. roger buried the first one, and wanted to save the other to bury later. that's how it went into the freezer. never did bury that turtle. . . 

==FIRST KISS== never.

==CRUSHES== hmmm. . i've pretty much only had that one. . .and that whole thing in middle school. . .no no. not true. just for clarification.

==BOY/GIRLFRIENDS== none.


anyways. . .tomorrow should be fun. get together with cousins again *means i get to hear lots and lots of lines from movies/books from them verbatim.*  i don't see how they can memorize all these lines (down to every voice inflection). . .my brain capacity isn't that big. sheer talent right there. haha* dang. roger is gonna miss it. :( well, i'll see him tomorrow night though. yay. i can just see him. . .i walk in the door. . .go into the family room. . .and he's there with monopoly all set up. *sigh* too much monopoly. hehe. or maybe he's hooked on a different game by now. . .we'll see. . . hehe. oh, that reminds me. roger. . .or anyone else who knows the game really well, for 13, can 2's beat bombs? cindy says they can. . but now i'm all confused. but then again, there are like. . .50 million different ways to play the game. . .well, i'll probably ask you sometime soon, but just in case. . . i put a reminder in my live journal. why? because i'm a loser. why am i writing right now? what am i writing? i don't even know. i never make any sense. :p weeee. okay, i noticed that it's the 21st now. . .but i started the entry on the 20th. so :p."

Senses Fail - One Eight Seven

It's so nice sitting very still,
in a room where no one else can feel the pain that breaks my heart each day, I'm not ok.
Sunlight shining through my window, let's me know that I'm still alive
Why did I ever let you inside my heart? I'm such a fool.
Paint my face in shades of blood and grey and take a seat right next to me
Well I should've known that you were a killer.
But now I'm dead.

A gaping hole, shot through my heart
A lost connection from your poison dart
Shot from your tounge to end my life.
You're blowing at the fire to light your strife.

You'll never know.
The hardest thing about dying is, knowing you'll never see the light of day.

A gaping hole shot...(shot through my heart)
A lost connection from your poison dart.
My head now spins and my ears bleed gold.
I try so fucking hard, but I can't fit your mold.

You ripped my heart out, you tore my eyes out, now you're gonna pay
I'll stab you one time.
I'll eat your heart out so you feel my pain.
Don't you know that I always see you in all of my dreams?
I wanna kill you."

"event","pleh. i hate being treated like such a little girl. i know my mom is just trying to protect me and make sure i'm okay and everything, but sometimes it can just get to be too much. my parents had a wedding to go to today, so i'm left at home alone for about 1/2 a day. when they leave, they make sure i'm in the house with all doors locked etc. like they always do, and before they leave the driveway, they make sure the garage door closes. always like that. fine. then, right after they leave. . not even a minute has passed, they call me. make sure i'm in the house *when and why would i leave?!?!*. then my mom says i have to run out and pick up the neighbor's newspaper because they forgot. she kept saying, hurry! because evan *another neighbor* is outside, so it's okay. hurry up before he goes in! *i was really surprised she was actually ASKING me to leave the house without one of them there.* so i go out, get the paper. . .come back. . . about to settle down again. . .and another call. mom again. making sure i made it back into the house after getting the paper. oh. my. god. it isn't that hard to get a paper! anyways, so far she's called me like what. . .3 more times just to check up. called to say to turn on the outside lights because it was getting dark. . .called to tell me that they finished dinner, did i eat dinner yet?. . .tell me to feed the cat. . .that kind of stuff. . .but yah. oh, and they leave me the car, but they won't let me use it unless it's a ""REAL EMERGENCY"". i can't even use it to get food or something. if i wanted to get fast food or something, i would have to take the car before they left. . .like at 2 in the afternoon or something. i guess they're afraid that if i get kidnapped or something while they're gone, it'll take longer for them to realize it instead of if they're home. 

like one time, i was kept for another 15 min in voice to work with another girl on a song we were doing together. i didn't think much of it because i have been kept after a few times before. . .just never 15 minutes. *i've been kept after at most 10 minutes before that time.* anyways, i was supposed to get food for dinner on the way home. so i did that, figuring 15 minutes wouldn't mean anything. especially because they wouldn't know how long it took to get the food *line length, traffic. . . all those stupid factors*. so i didn't think to call them. oops. i get home, and it turns out my dad went out looking for me. my mom said that they calculated that i should have been back about 15 minutes ago, so my dad went out to find me. she said mcdonalds *what we got* shouldn't take that long. and of course, they didn't bother to call my cell phone, they just went off and figured i had died or something. that's great. ugh. 

it just sucks because first off, i rarely get time alone in the house so i like it, but i can't enjoy it as much because practically every two seconds my parents are calling to check up on me. sometimes i think they do that to make sure that i don't take the car out or go anywhere, because they said not to. it's annoying because i feel like such a little child when they do that, especially calling to tell me something like turn on the light, or feed the cat. . .how irresponsible do they think i am? and of course, every time they call, i've  already done what they want me to do. . .so i tell them, hoping they'll get the idea that i CAN be in the house by myself for awhile *it's not like it's even over 1 day or anything!*. i feel like they think i need a babysitter or something still. i'm already 17! dang! i'm not incompetent. :p 

they always tell me to ask a friend to come over or something. sometimes i do. but other times, like today, i just wanted some time to myself. . .they seemed kind of mad that i didn't ask anyone to come.
my friend is supposed to babysit me. at least, that's the way i think they see it.

i know they mean the best and everything. . .but i think it's ironic how i feel the most smothered by my parents when they aren't home. they weren't like this with my brothers. . .it's because i'm a girl. i can't take care of myself if i'm a girl apparently. why can't they see that i'm just as capable as randy and roger? i can't even walk outside of the court by myself. . .when they are home. when they aren't home, i can't even unlock a door or something, let alone open it! my brothers. . .since 6th grade, they could walk to the park by themselves. hmmm. . .why does that not seem right to me? oh yes, and i like how i have to carry around pepper spray, a whistle, and a flashlight at all times. . .just it case. i mean, they're good safety measures and all. . .but they force me to do it. randy and roger. . .go, have fun. bye. me? whooole list of questions before i leave. who's going? how many people? how many guys? where? is that all? anywhere else? what time will you be home? be sure to lock the car door once you're in *this is just in case someone tries to jump into the car while i'm at a stop light. . .oookay.* call us when you get there. call us before you leave. be sure someone walks to your car and watches you leave. bla bla bla. the list goes on. 

*to tell the truth, i kind of DO feel like a little whiny kid. . . complaining about this and all. . .yet again.* i mean, i've been through this soo many times. . and i keep trying to convince myself it's okay because they're just looking out for me. i know they are. . .but that still doesn't make me happy about it. it still annoys the hell out of me. of course, it's better then having parents that don't care at all. at least they're concerned, right?"

today wasn't half as bad as i thought it would be. lol, first thing that happens when i get to school, is my friends telling me i'm not wearing red *it being valentines day and all*. it's not my fault i don't give myself enough time to get ready in the morning, so i was rushing out and didn't remember until i was in the car and it was too late!. . .well okay, maybe it is. but that's beside the point. so i forgot to wear red. . .does it matter? i was wearing blue. . . close enough for me! blue. . .red. . .who can tell the difference? haha.

ah yes, vaelntines day. . .the dreaded day for all single people. supposedly. i don't really care either way, its a day to wear red. which i forgot to do, so it's pretty much just a day. *wow, am i good with my explanations or what?* haha. it was cool though, not a bad day at all. got a cool surprize *so sweet, i was flattered. . .but i don't really know if it was a good thing or not* and got to hang out with vivien and cindy after school. *dude! bret harte has a nicer stage than us! heck, their entire cafeteria. .. cafetorium. . whatever it is. . . is better than leland's!. . . but the campus seems so small now. . .we got across it in about. . .1 min or something. lol.* and the cute kitties in the books. you know you have no life when you go to barnes and nobles with your friends to look at pictures of kitties. hahaha. wow, that sounds even stupider than it did when we were actually doing it. well, that wasn't the real reason we went to barnes and nobles, we just ended up doing that. . .oookay, doesn't matter. don't know why i'm saying all of this. why am i laying out my day for you? i don't know. i just feel like writing something and nothing is coming to me. i need inspiration! lol, its like the song i'm listening to:

The Rentals - waiting

I'm waiting
For something to come through
I'm hoping
I can write a real sweet tune
No passion
(ooo ooo ooo)
No warmth in these words
(ooo ooo ooo)
I'm trying
(ooo ooo ooo)
But have nothing to offer
I'm waiting
With nothing to do

. . .i'm waiting for a lot of things to come through to my head. . .unfortunately, my brain doesn't work very well, so nothing ever comes to it. therefore, i'm constantly waiting. okay. that made NO sense whatsoever.

i feel like talking to kristen. i don't see her enough. or talk to her enough. kristen, where are you? you're supposed to be online whenever i am! hahaha. jk jk. well, i'll see her soon. 

weeee, it's break time! an entire week off to myself!. . .except that it really isn't to myself because of course i planned stuff for almost every single day. smart. supposed to just relax and stuff. . .nope nope nope. ah well. i can relax around my friends. . . hahaha. riiight. we all know how it gets when we're all together. not going to happen. especially when we're talking about things like tepee-ing people's houses *who's would that be??. . .doo doo doo. . .* and going to denny's at the odd hours of the night. walking. in our pajamas. we are the smart ones. ah yes. . .when our stupidness combines, we get. . . even stupider! we're all stupid together then! hahaha. 

can you tell i'm just a tad hyper?? too much sugar. i swear, it was the licorice! yily's licorice!. . .it has liquor in it. her fault! the peer pressure! she made me do it!. . .actually it was more like. . .""do you want some?"" . . .""nah. . .*2 seconds later*. . . well, okay!"" yes. that's some bad peer pressure right there. must remember not to give into that kind of stuff. 

omg, now i'm just sounding like i need to be in a mental institute with a straight jacket. . . .*aHem* excuse me. . .a ""hug yourself"" jacket, and a padded room. i should stop before i really do some serious damage to myself. oops! too late for that!"

just got one thing to say. . . i feel lonely. :(
well actually, i'm not completely lonely though :) cause i get to do stuff with people still tomorrow. i'm not going to be a loser by myself! i get to be a loser with my other loser friends! *that is ""loser"" in the best possible way* haha.

yup yup. that's all. i should really stop complaining about such trivial things. but it's so easy to bitch about everything! ah well.

me likes these lyrics:

Mest feat. Goldfinger and Good Charlotte - The Innocent

The start of Armageddon, it was just another day
We all saw the news nothing to say
So many friends are missing, our family members gone
So we all pray that God help them be strong
And now we stand together, remembering that day
The lives we live will never be the same

We don't know why, the innocent die
Will this world ever find a way to change
And we don't know why, but we know it's not right
Don't know why so many had to die
I don't know why so many had to die

Hate is turned to others, for their religion or their skin
But hate can't solve the problem it began
Everyone is angry, people are afraid
And no one knows what decisions will be made

We don't know why, the innocent die
Will this world ever find a way to change
And we don't know why, but we know it's not right
Don't know why so many had to die
I don't know why so many had to die. . .

the end."

"event","here i am again. this is what i do, i write constantly, and then i'm going to start forgetting, and then i'm not going to update for months and months. . . you just wait. haha. 

i feel soo sorry for vivien and danny. everyday they have to go through this horror for a teacher in their art class. i don't it shouldn't really bother me, i mean, i don't even know the teacher, but it does. i know vivien is really passionate about art, and apparently this guy is so bad that she's starting to lose her love for it. something has GOT to be wrong with the teacher if he's doing that to someone who is so adamant about the subject. she's so good, and i don't think it's fair for her and everyone else who loves art just as much as she does to have to be stuck with a teacher like him. he made danny have a ""talk"" with him yesterday and today, and he made vivien cry! it takes quite a bit to make her cry too. messed up. from what i hear, they're treated like elementary school kids. always telling them *especially danny* that they're being disrespectful. they're freaking teenagers! you're at leland! what do you expect? practically every person there is disrespectful! 

thankfully, i get to leave after this year! *IF i get into college. . .hope hope hope!. . .well, a college i WANT to go to. . UCLA, or UCSB? pleh. stupid colleges. i hate how a bunch of people just want to go to places like UCLA or UCSD just because it's a well known school. go because it has something to offer you, not to impress other people. you know? it sucks. who cares if it's a top college overall, go to the one that's best for your personal goals and career choices. especially in college. by that time, shouldn't everyone be done trying to suck up and stand out? people do that in high school so they can get into college. how about instead of continuing to kiss up to get a good job, you work hard and become good at what you do? sounds good to me. man, i hated college apps, cause it was pretty much just trying to play everything up that you've done, and try to make yourself sound special and better than everyone else. a bunch of bs crap. hated it. thank god that part is over. i'll be glad to leave leland.

i'm just kind of annoyed at everything right now. today was a pretty crappy day actually. oh well. it's just one day, right? haha, the cast for footloose is going to be posted tomorrow. you know, i don't think i'll get a chorus role anymore. cause i've cut class so much, while everyone else was practicing acting and dancing. oops. well, we were told we didn't HAVE to. . .although it would have helped my chances. . .eh. i don't really care either way. i'll figure something out. haha, and if i don't get in, it just makes it easier, because then i don't have to decide! yay! haha. bad excuse. but it works!

i just want this crappy feeling to go away. life has been pretty sucky lately. . .it's kind of weird though, because it isn't just me. some of my other friends also feel the same way. the past week or two have just. . . sucked. i don't know what it was, it just did. like kristen said. . .""it does, but it doesn't."" nicely put. haha. oh well. . .food time. food is always good :) food makes life good. haha."

you know what i have to do? i have to start running again. i miss it. i can probably only run a mile in what now. . . a half hour? jk jk! ah! if i let myself get THAT slow, i think i'd cry. . .*sniff* i miss running. does anyone want to run with me again? pleh. 

haha, yily is drawing a cute cow on the computer. . .okay, slightly demented. . .but still cute. it's a yily cow. hehe. it's blue. . and its justa floating cow head. . .wow, that's kind of scary actually. what happened to it's body?!?!? *the farmer ran it over with his tractor i guess. . .*

"event","I procrastinate waaay too much! it isn't healthy! on sunday night I started my homework past 11:00. . .so I don't finish until 3ish or something. then, instead of going to bed, I watch tv. smart me. oh well, I'll catch up on sleep sometime. that's what weekends are for :) I just hate that I know that I shouldn't procrastinate, and it's something that I can easily fix, and yet I don't. why is that? oh that's right, because I'm too stupid to fix it. like the english project we had to do, due tomorrow, and I don't start until today. we got it done, but it's a piece of crap. *ashlie, pablo didn't get murdered!. . .unless someone came to kill him after I dropped him off. . .in that case, i blame you! I mean, if someone came to kill pablo, how am I supposed to stop it?!?! oh yah, with the muscles i have. . .serious damage with those. hahaha* oh, and we have to present the project tomorrow. that's going to suck. but I don't really care. this is bad. I need to start caring again! pleh. I'll start doing that later. haha. Oh, and what am I doing now? Procrastinating. 

I don't know if I still want to do the musical. damn, I went through this last year too. this year I figured I'd just to tech stuff, because last year I decided I might as well be in the play since I made auditions. but I don't know anymore. like, last year the students didn't really get to do any of the sound, and the lighting wasn't much. I guess it depends if I really want to do tech. I do, but I don't know if I want to do it yet. I keep putting it off. last year it was because I got in, and I didn't think I would, so I thought I should take the opportunity. this year, I'm not sure just because it's leland. . .and we all know how crappy and old the equipment is. I don't know if it's worth it, or if I should just have fun being a dork on stage again. because I can always start next year, when I'm in college. . .right? i mean, if the equipment is so outdated, how much is that really going to help me? meh. I'll see. either way, it isn't that big of a deal though, so I don't think it really matters. and if I'm in chorus, I can still do set design and stuff again. i don't know. it's just that I don't think performing is really my thing; I don't need any spotlight. I like the technical aspects more. *last year was funn though. . .lol, remember kristen, you and meggie kept lip-syncing backstage, ""shimmy soloist #1"", and opening night . . john almost killed himself. . . fun stuff.* 

Hmm. . . there was something else I wanted to write about, but I forgot. Oh well. You know what else though? I should be doing my homework!! Must . . .start . . .early. probably not going to happen right away, but hopefully it will. . .eventually. Sometime tonight hopefully? At least do something productive? Please? See, half of me is saying to actually do work, and the other half. . . is laughing at the first half. but see, the faster i do my homework, the earlier i can sleep. . . mmmmm. . .sleep. *haha, do you like how i argue back and forth to myself on my journal? i'm such a loser.*"

"event","well, i haven't updated this in so long i decided i might as well start from scratch. 
guess what i'm doing right now? procrastinating! isn't that just the maddie thing to do? i just don't care as much about school anymore. don't know why. . . senioritis. i blame that. oh, and i blame roger for having me play monopoly online with him all the time. . .and beating my minesweeper time, making me determined to beat his. why does he have to be so good at it? it's not my fault my brain doesn't function as well as his. it's all roger's fault. of course it is. if i keep telling myself that, maybe it'll come true. haha. ah yes, blame everyone but myself. it's not like i HAD to play with roger or anything. . .it's still his fault. i swear. let's see, i could study for physics, but i never have before, so why start now? and i could be doing my current event for econ, but i don't really feel like writing right now. so i write here. yah, that makes a lot of sense. okay, i don't want to write a formal essay. here i can just write crap that makes no sense. this is pretty much how my brain works. random things just pop into my head every now and then. yup. 

so what's been going on. . .oh yah, i'm watching this movie on tv with my mom, and so she figures it's a good time to have one of those ""mother-daughter"" chats. uh oh. you know that's not going to turn out good. so she starts talking to me about relationships and friends and stuff. first she starts with talking about roger and kim, and how she wants him to make new friends and find new girls instead of sticking so close to all his old high school friends. i don't really see anything wrong with staying with old friends, but she wants him to be like randy, meeting new people and getting new friends. she kind of has the idea that it's healthy to grow apart from older friends because you're growing up and changing. she thinks that when you get into college you start to mature differently than your high school friends. i don't know. i don't like the part where she made a point that he should meet new people becuase randy did. roger isn't randy. they're different people. sometimes i don't think she realizes that her 3 kids aren't the same, and what is good for one of them might not be for another. i know randy met a lot of new people in college, but he makes friends so easily. he's so easy to talk to and get along with. with roger, you need to spend a little more time to get to know him. like mom said, he's the least sociable out of us. *not saying that's bad though!* he just tends to stick with a close group of friends. she said she didn't really like the idea of roger and kim going out because they've known each other for so long and have been good friends for a long time. mom was afraid that he went out with her just because they felt comfortable with each other. 

and then she goes into talking about how she thinks that i should get more guy friends. *i forgot how exactly she made the transition, but she did*. she said i don't have enough and that maybe i intimidate them or scare them or something. she doesn't think that i'm a very approachable person. gee, thanks mom. *i swear, she thinks i have no social life or something*. i don't know why i don't have as many guy friends, it just happened that way. should i go out of my way to make the number of my guy and girl friends even? that would be pretty. . .interesting. and i like how in this case she leaves out the part about how randy didn't have many girl friends. she only makes the comparison if it helps her case. well, whatever. so she just keeps telling me that i need to get more guy friends and that maybe i should try talking to them, and that i should be the one to start conversation. then she goes off about realtionships again. it's like she's hinting that she wants me to get a boyfirend, but at the same time she doesn't want me to becuase that means i'm getting older, her little girl is growing up, bla bla bla. like i said, i don't know if i'd want a relationship right now because i don't really know who i am yet. i want to figure out that first. and like she pointed out earlier, you grow up more when you reach college. so if i start going out with someone now, and we change during college, what was the point? right? it's the same a having new friends in college. well. . .i'm not saying don't have friends until you get to college because they're going to change. . .but i just mean that i don't want to go out of my way to find a guy just for the sake of having a boyfriend. does that make sense? probably not. i never do. :p she said that it's good to have someone there that you can count on and bla bla bla; the things you can get from a relationship. well, first off, isn't that what friends are there for? and secondly, what if i'm content with just being single. i'm just me. i don't need anything else. i know she means well and everything. and i don't mean to make it seem like i'm complaining or anything. it's just something that i don't really agree with. it's just mom advice stuff.

damn. i really need to start working. and i'm not making any sense. . . this is just a bunch of rambling about nothing. oh well. not like it has to make sense to anyone else. i understand it! that's all that really matters."

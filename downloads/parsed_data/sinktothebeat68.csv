"event","Stevie Ray Vaughn is the shit. I've been listening to the same cd since i got home from work at 10. I would sell my soul to be able to play guitar like that. Lately i've been playing too much guitar hero and not enough school. I had midterms this week and i probably spent a good solid hour studying and about 12 hours playing guitar hero. Grades are so pointless. Just let me learn without having the stress of getting some meaningless letter than my future employer won't give two shits about. My job rocks, it's a shitty job with good pay. The people i work with make it worth my time to go in and give 100orate office and gets me a job somewhere. My best friend is graduating this semester and I don't want that day to come. We've had too much fun over the last year. It funny how i look foward to going back to san jose less and less. I wish all my friends and family would just move down here. I don't know how they can stand it up there. Honestly. I never want to go back. I wish i had a camera. I have so many good ideas for short films running through my head all day I just want to drop everything and shoot them. I'm tired of people (a certain someone) telling me that everything about me is ok and nothing is wrong. Fuck, if nothing was wrong i would have a girlfriend right now instead of those hundreds of douchebags at school who take thier women for granted and treat them like shit. Dating is a popularity contest. Or maybe it's like a reality show. Whatever guy can humiliate himself more in front of a girl 'wins' the adoration of that girl. and then cheats on her 6 times and she takes him back. Where as I genuinely be myself and not put up a facade. Be myself, that's all i hear. It doesnt work. Stop looking and it will happen. Sorry, been there too many times. Be more aggressive. Care to elaborate? I am not an aggressive person by nature, so that won't work. ""Oh Marcos, you're so funny and sweet, but i wont date you."" ouch. ha ha ha. I hate seeing people with lesser talent pass me by in anything. Its getting warm again. So i can start skimboarding again. Yes. Easter is almost here, time to grub hardcore with the cortez family. Speaking of holiday's i was in target during st patty's day and they actually had st patty's day cards. Ha. Damn fucking consumerism. Holidays are so meaningless these days. At least halloween is always halloween. Dress up and get drunk. Never changes. If anyone is still reading this...wow. Rx bandits new cd is almost out. I need to see them again soon. I've almost stopped living check to check. Just have a little bit of catching up left. I need/want a new car. Probably a truck. they're always handy."

"event","Being in the edit bay for 6 straight hours with a pretty girl makes you think. It's amazing to notice how much i have come out of my shell since moving down here a year ago. I make friends alot more eaisly. Talking to girls is a piece of cake. I am so much less reserved. I've tried things i never would have tried in SJ.

I think the whole Danielle situation has opened up so many doors for me. Here is an absolutely gorgeous and totally cool girl that befriended me. And soon after we were best friends. PRETTY GIRLS CAN ACTUALLY LIKE ME. OMG. Main lesson being for me to stop being the stuck up one. No one if out of my league.

anyways. yeah it feels good to reinvent yourself. you should try it sometime. I'm going to get an ice cream now. See ya."

I don't really enjoy this time of year. I dont like the over polished commercialism of it. I think people take it for granted and just kind of throw it away. Not being able to be with my family or friends today made me really think about today. I'm really thankful that i got to see the majority of my family last weekend in Reno. It really helped seeing them, the year away from home has been starting to a take a toll on me. My friends down here are alot busier than any of my friends back home. So I havent seen much of them lately. There have been a couple of time where i just wanted to go back and have things be like they were. When i was just starting college. But overall my expeirence out here hs been so wonderful. I've really discovered who I am and what I want in life.  So I'm thankful for all those who supported my move and let me step out of my shell for the first time in my life. I'm thankful for my friends, especially Chris and Tigo. you guys are more than friends and I hope you know that. I'm thankful for Matt for getting me interested in film in the first place and starting the ball rolling on this adventure I am on. I'm thankful for Dan for being a friend when i didnt know anyone. I'm thankful for Danielle for being in my life and for being the first girl to 'get' me. I'm thankful for my genuineness or whatever the correct word is. It's really filtered out alot of people along the way leaving me with a handful of friends that i truly care about. 

I just want to say that i am thankful for friends that dont ditch you when your a puking drunk, DVD's, hours upon hours in the edit bay watching my movies come alive, high fiving with danielle and missing and then laughing about it forever, newport beach, skimboarding, hero's, ice hockey, driving zambonis, dan's beatboxing in my car on the way to the beach, video games, netflix, taco bell, working at costco, lynard skynard, water, hockey, my car for not falling apart on me yet, indie pop at 2am, American Idiot, The Resignation, Anthem, You Forgot in People, confidence, best friends in other states and, new family guy episodes."

I went out to Riverside to play some hockey with my friend from elementry school. I didn't play as well as I usually do, but i ended up with 3 goals.
After hockey we went back to his house and chilled and watched some wakeboard videos which got me stoked to go wakeboarding (hopefully next week) with him and his friends. After that we headed back to fullerton so I could so him my place and where I live. Then it was off to Hunnington Beach for a bonfire with his friends. Hunnington beach is probably my new favorite beach now, yes even better than santa cruz. I had surfed there last month, but that wasnt near the main strip of the beach. Sure it was a little on the rich side, but it was absolutely beautiful there. Much warmer than santa cruz at night. They have literally hundreds of bonfire pits all along the beach so it was no problem getting a pit. Jakes friend are a blast to hang out with, mostly his buddy matt and his lady amanda. The bonfires were supposed to be out at 10pm, but we stayed till around 11ish and still noone came to kick us off the beach.

good times indeed."

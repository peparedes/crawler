"event","This tale starts when me, yeager, and john decided to go to the wegmans or a gerocery store. After we went to irodequoot hots to eat some food. It was great in irodequoit hots we have two littel groups our friends are in john yeager and rocky are in the trix's group while me and yeager are in the pineapples. They wrote on the side of the table we were eating on ""The Trix's Table"". The pineapples reacted my going into the bathroom and writing ""The Pineapple's Bathroom"". Then we got a cup and called it the pineapple cup then playing glaxia yeager beat up in it just cause he didn't get the little bees that lock onto you -.-'. Back to the story, after leaving from I. Hots i noticed i had some money left and my brother john reminded me i could get a bubble sword! But then when we got to it, it didn't come with bubbles so instead we bought 4 squirt guns and then went into wegmans. We filled them up with water and ran around the halls squirting each other with water. Then this one guy just stared at us with these eyes that seem to say ""Get out or i will shoot you all in the thoart"". So needless to say we ran the hell outta there and that ended that story. Then i got home and called angel like i always do ~.^. Yea that's bout it"

Moving on my grades are getting better i don't have first peroid now which is awesome so i get to stay up later. Then don't gotta wake up till around 7:30 which is awesome but then i have to miss yu-gi-oh and do i really want to do that? Great now everyone on the internet knows im a loser. Oh well like that is new to anyone or something. If it was then you are a slow, slow person. Ah yes spring time when everything seems less depressing gotta love it. Spring break in two weeks everyone online always has had it but when i get it the first thing im going to do when i wake up is just laugh at everyone who doesn't have it. (but bot whew that was close >.>) Yes waking up around 11am nothing is better in life that i have yet to experience o.o;."

"event","Okay it's been awhile so i might as well tell you people how i have changed. I haven't really changed much im still the quite,nice kid in school. But now im more into anime and magna don't a otaku but still like it. I have a girlfriend now we have been going out for about 4 months. It is a long distance relationship but i care about this girl too much to end it because of that. I like to DDR which is a dance game found in many arcades. I have longer hair but accidently cut it short now so im letting it grow back. I like more different kinds of music anything that sounds good to me i listen too. No really big changes in the friendship area the same idiots still tag around with me. That's about it really im just bored and typing this for no reason. I don't really care that much about the super bowl i don't really see what the big deal is. I only like it if my two favorite teams are on my Favorite the Raiders and the team my girlfriend makes me like which are the packers lol. Oh yea i also have a sprite webcomic that im started. We tried making it a regular drawing webcomic but that didn't work out so well. Anyways the site is http://endsville.blogdrive.com if that link is not clickable just copy and paste. Also if you got any ideas for the webcomic just leave a comment."

What's wrong baby? 
Don't they treat u like they should?
Do u take them for it?
For every penny that u could?
We once walked out on the beach and  once I almost touched your hand.
Oh how i dream of finally say such things if only to pretend.
Don't you know what im thinking ( know what im thinking)
Driving 405 past midnight.
U know i miss u (don't u know that i miss you).
9th and ash on a tuesday night 
i would write to you on a amusing note
a toast to u your whisper, your smile
Up those staris i weather perfer
a ghost each place i hide
If u don't don't know what why would u say so 
Would u be mispleased if it happen?
If u don't know why would u say so?
Would u get your story staright.
If u don't know  hunny then just say so!
I need this now more then i ever did 
If u don't know honey then u don't 
I left u waiting (i know i left u waiting)
At the least could we be friends
Should have never started (should have never started)
Ain't that the way it always ends
All my life i tried to late 
There is so much I  felt i should say but
Even if your heart would listen i doubt I  could explain
If u don't don't know what why would u say so 
Would u be mispleased if it happen?
If u don't know why would u say so?
Would u get your story staright.
If u don't know  hunny then just say so!
I need this now more then i ever did 
If u don't know honey then u don't 
If u don't know honey then u don't
So here we are now
A sip of wine a sip of water
Some day maybe, maybe we will be smarter
And I'm sorry im such a mess
I drank all my mind could take
And i took all u let me have and i never loved u back
If u don't don't know what why would u say so 
Would u be mispleased if it happen?
If u don't know why would u say so?
Would u get your story staright.
If u don't know  hunny then just say so!
I need this now more then i ever did 
If u don't know honey then u don't 

There you are time well spent i think o_O"

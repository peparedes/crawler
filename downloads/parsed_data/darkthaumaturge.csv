"event","Well, I drove to my father's house today. I felt confident when I began...but as I soon traveled and neared his house, I was like ""holy shit. where the hell am I?"" I eventually found my way. The directions I received were good, it just seemed a lot longer of a drive than I thought it would be. Plus there was a TON of traffic. I hate traffic. It annoys me. GAH! But, I did reach here safely, and my car is just fine. That's the best part....my car is fine. I wouldn't be able to afford a new car if my car got hit by someone else. :D"

Keeping it real, son
That's right
The shining star
My shining star, girl

Yo!
New York in the house
Is Brooklyn in the house
Uptown in the house
Shaolin, are you in the house
Boogie down
Are you in the house
Sacremento in the house
Atlanta, Georgia, are you in the house
West Coast, are you in the house
Japan, are you in the house
Everybody, are you in the house

Baby, baby, com'on
Baby com'on
Baby com'on

Oh, when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kinda hectic inside
Mmm, baby I'm so into you
Darling, if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind

(I'm in Heaven)
(With my boyfriend)
(My laughing boyfriend)
(There's no beginning)
(And there is no end)
(Feels like I'm dreaming)
(But I'm not sleeping)

Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
(My fantasy)
So deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby

Images of rapture
Creeping to me slowly
As you're going to my head
(I like that)
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again

(I'm in Heaven)
(With my boyfriend)
(My laughing boyfriend)
(There's no beginning)
(And there is no end)
(Feels like I'm dreaming)
(But I'm not sleeping)

Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby

(Feels like I'm dreaming)
(But I'm not sleeping)

Ladies and gentlemen
Introducing the Old Dirty Doggy
Here we go, now...

Me and Mariah
Go back like babies with pacifiers
Old dirt' dog no liar
Keep the fantasy hot like fire

Jump, jump
Let me see you do the stomp
Girls| let me see you shake your rump
Fellas| get it from the back and pump it
Let's do it, do it, do the hump

I'm a little bit raunchy
I'm a little bit rock and roll
And I'm soul to soul
Big letters
All big and bold
Ol' Dirty Bastard, across the globe

I'm in Heaven
With my boyfriend
My laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning 
And there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming
But I'm not sleeping

What ya gonna do when you get outta gaol
(I'm gonna do a remix)
What ya gonna do when you get outta gaol
(I'm gonna do a remix)
What ya gonna do when you get outta gaol
(I'm gonna have some fun)
What ya gonna do when you get outta gaol
(I'm gonna have some fun)

I'm in Heaven
With my boyfriend
My laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning 
And there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming
But I'm not sleeping

I'm in Heaven

My laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning 
And there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming

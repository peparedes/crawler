"event","I didn't forget this. Oh no... but things have been really complicated. Remember when I said that by Christmas the worst part would be over?&nbsp;Well, we were wrong. Terribly wrong. 

Things have gone even worst after that. The ones &quot;managing&quot; (not even sure if this word exists) our year aren't ready for it. Things have been pretty chaotic these last months. Starting by&nbsp;Imagiology, which was completely renewed from last year, it gave us some pretty bad headaches back on the days - oh, and by the way, I&nbsp;failed the exam, even though I don't know why... the only good thing was the work, I&nbsp;managed to get an average of 10 at the subject. After that, Pathology, which was the most deorganized subject I ever had, with teachers (yes, teachers) skipping classes just because they could and forgetting that we're *students* on the process of learning, not *doctors* with many years of experience. The results have been pathetic. 

Also, because of our crazy schedules, we started having exams every *week*, instead of the normal two, so I just have like three days (five, when we had those 14 chapters to read) to study for an exam. Like you see, it's been complicated - I'm starting to hate this word. I'm already taking some supplements to fight stress, or I think I would have been crazy by now.&nbsp;

On the other hand, our teachers finally realized that things were really bad (they had almost 20 people in the risk of losing the year), so they decided to help us a bit. Our last two exams were very easy. But they already said that those results were a shame (HELLO, you were the ones who repeated the questions, remember? O.o) , so I don't even want to imagine the final Pathology exam this Friday. *shivers* 

To finish this rambling in peace, my colleagues (who can be so adorable to some things and so stupid to others) asked to delay the Geriatrics exam - it should have been today -, so after Easter we'll only have two final exams to do, plus two other &quot;normal&quot; exams, four paper works and two presentations, in the middle of our traineeship in the hospital.

WHEN WILL THIS YEAR ENDS??????????????

So, I'm so sorry I didn't manage to appear in here sooner than this and sorry for not posting comments on your ljs neither. Maybe in summer things will get a little easier. Because right now... oh boy, I'm happy for each day I manage to survive. =/

Hope everything is feeling great!&nbsp;Kisses to all and thanks for listening. 

I'm off to Pathology. Heart failure, here I go!&nbsp;=P

As the family struggles to make ends meet to cover Willow&rsquo;s medical expenses, Charlotte thinks she has found an answer. If she files a wrongful birth lawsuit against her ob/gyn for not telling her in advance that her child would be born severely disabled, the monetary payouts might ensure a lifetime of care for Willow. But it means that Charlotte has to get up in a court of law and say in public that she would have terminated the pregnancy if she&rsquo;d known about the disability in advance &ndash; words that her husband can&rsquo;t abide, that Willow will hear, and that Charlotte cannot reconcile. And the ob/gyn she&rsquo;s suing isn&rsquo;t just her physician &ndash; it&rsquo;s her best friend. (summary and image taken from <a href=""http://www.jodipicoult.com/handle-with-care.html#excerpt"">here</a>)<br /><br />This book was my mom and sister's birthday present. It's a loving and tender story about a family like so many others around us.

I guess they weren't lying. I started 2010 with exams on Friday, I had final exams on Anatomical Pathology and Microbiology on the second week, and an oral exam last Wednesday. Microbiology was a huge surprise to me. Forgetting the third exam I had really good grades, I think. Let's see if the final exam was as easy as I think it was. AP, on the other hand, was a disgrace, like I thought it would be. At least I didn't fail at any exam - I think.</p><p>And you have no idea how terrible it was to have that oral exam. First, it was really bad to have an exam about Histology, because we have no basis on it. But it was much worse once the teachers told us that we would lose all our points if we failed it. Which means, we would have a zero (!!) on Anatomical Pathology. I spend four days terrible nervous about it, everyone was crazy on Tuesday, and I barely slept that night. Fortunately, the exam went fine - though I had only one diagnosis correct. Oh, who cares, I just needed one. XD<br /><br />Wednesday was such a perfect day. After the exam I&nbsp;felt so good with myself, I cleaned up the house, I read a book and I went to the movies with my friends. Unfortunately, Thursday&nbsp;was terrible. We had some problems with one of the subjects, but&nbsp;it's a little complicated to&nbsp;tell you&nbsp;about them right now.&nbsp;We're still trying to&nbsp;work on this, hope things will get better. I just know that I got&nbsp;really stressed (again), cried (again) all night and wished (again)&nbsp;I had never applied&nbsp;to&nbsp;med school.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />My schedules changed. I spend the entire weekend without touching at a book (well, school book, I mean XD) because I won't have exams next week. I'll have to present a work about MRI and TC, but I'll try not to think much about it. This was a really good weekend. <br /><br />Oh, and I found out I'm going to have another cousin. Yeay!&nbsp;=D<br /><br />Well, I think I'm going now. Wish you all a great week and have fun, people!<br /><br />See ya!&nbsp;**<br />&nbsp;</p><br />"

OMG, IT'S SNOWING, IT'S SNOWING, IT'S SNOWING!!!!

I know it's not much to you, but it is to me!&nbsp;I had never seen snow in here since 1997!!&nbsp;Well, it snowed last year but I wasn't here to see it... and it wasn't as much as now, according to my mom and my sister. It's been snowing since morning and everything is white! What a wonderful day. I should be studying, but I can't - my neighbours made a &quot;snow penguin&quot; and now they're taking pictures with it. XD

Now, the worst part is that my mom is scared that they might cut the roads to my college and wants to send me&nbsp;to there as soon as possible. JESUS, I'm supposed to go only tuesday! I hate when this happens!&nbsp;=/ 

Oh, yes, I'm back to college. I had two nasty exams last friday, I had disgusting grades on the ones I had before Christmas and I'm not very confident about the ones next week. God, help me now...

Well, I just want you to know that I'm okay and I'm sorry I can't post more. Hope you're having a great new year so far!

See you all ASAP!&nbsp;;)

"event","So here I am, back after being ""abducted"" from here for a month. Gosh, people, I'm so sorry, but college has been driving me crazy. Again.

My final exames were terrible. Psychology had almost every question from our previous exams (that's why we can't see the correction) and Preventive Medicine was too long, it left me with a terrible headache. Pharmacology was a stupidity from the first question to the last. Can you believe they asked us for medication that we NEVER studied?!I had a 10, but I don't even know how! 

I need to say, though, that we had really great results, I think. Only (cof cof) 28 people failed, and most of them with 8 and 9. I must said, we're the best year in that stupid college! They try to bring us down everytime, but they can't. Yeay... --'

Anatomical Pathology is a disgrace. We don't have the basic concepts in Histology to understand that thing and what annoys me the most is the fact that it seems pretty interesting. I don't even want to know my result in the latest exam. And please, we're learning everything in 4 weeks. Who can know everything in 4 weeks?!

Microbiology, on the other hand, was a surprise. I had a 15 on the first exam and I barely knew a thing. And I had a 17 on the second. Weeeee. Unfortunately, the third one was a tragedy. But it's okay, the other results will blind me on this one. XD

So, now I'm on vacations and I need to study Microbiology and Anatomical Pathology because we'll have exams on the first week of classes and the final exams on these two subjects in the next one. Great, isn't it? The last week was terrible in one way, everyone is feeling frustrated about college and my class had a huge fight for something really stupid, but it ended okay, I think. I'm feeling very lazy, I didn't do a thing last week, I don't even have the copies to study yet, and I hate to study during Christmas. There's so many things to do, once you realize it it's January and you're back to school!

Oh, and yesterday was my birthday! =D I had a really great day, all my friends sent messages, even some from college, and I got things I really needed. I have Jodi Picoult's latest book, woo woo! Can't wait to read it! *-*

So, I guess that's it for now. Once again, sorry for disappearing for so long, you know how I am. And I hope to post a little more during Christmas break, even though I need to study. See you all soon, I hope. 

Huggles and kisses! ***"

I still believe that I will be strong enough to survive college. Everything will be okay and I will thank myself the fact that I didn't give up.

But at the same time...

WHAT THE HELL was I thinking when I chose medicine?! That choice was a suicide and people don't even get it! 

I'm so sick and tired of that place. You have NO idea! I'm sick and tired of those classes that are nothing more than a waste of time, I'm sick and tired of those teachers, who have this special pleasure in ruining two weeks of hard study for their own joy, I'm sick and tired of those exams because I know things but I can't answer those questions, I'm sick and tired of people around me, who don't get that I'm tired, that I'm NOT complaining because I'm lazy, that I'm NOT complaining for nothing!

Now I get what that other guy said on tv: when people commit something stupid, they always give others signs... the others are the ones who aren't interested enough to notice them. 

I can't wait for this week to be over. Maybe I'll feel a little better by then.

Glad to talk to you again. Kisses!

"event","<br />This was the worst week ever. And I'm not kidding! Thank God I skipped classes on monday (Tuesday was the city's holiday) or I think I would have gone mad!<br /><br />On monday, Oct 12th, we had this seminar about Psychology in Health. My colleagues acted very childish and spend the entire class talking with each other and not paying attention to what the teacher was saying. I&nbsp;mean, c'mon, I&nbsp;was on the second row and I couldn't hear half of what he said. So, after break, the teacher spend 15 minutes asking them &quot;Can I start my class?&quot;&nbsp;but no one listened to him. Well, long story short:&nbsp;the man gave up and he abandoned the class, saying that we were terrible and we would complain about us. <br /><br />So, do you want to know my opinion?&nbsp;I&nbsp;agreed with his decision. I know it's a pain in the ass to be on that room, sitting on those chairs for 4 entire hours, but, please, it started right in the beginning of the class. They really overreacted that time.<br /><br />The problem was last monday, when the second seminar started with the teacher <em>and</em> the responsible for our course <em>and</em> the president of our college, who started&nbsp;complaining about us, saying that everybody already knew about our behaviour, and that we were desgracing the&nbsp;college's name (my&nbsp;opinion:&nbsp;pfffff... I tell <em>you</em> who's desgracing the&nbsp;college's name...)&nbsp;and that we would be punished for our actions.<br /><br />First, they wanted to take five points from our result in the next&nbsp;Psychology exam. To everyone. Five points. I&nbsp;mean, I&nbsp;had a 14 in the last exam. Without those five points, I&nbsp;would have a 9. A F****** NINE!!!! Who the hell do they think they are?!&nbsp;But people started complaining it wasn't legal, and it wasn't fair to those who had been paying attention. So they gave up. Instead, the president (who's our Preventive Medicine teacher) decided that multiple choice exams were over in his class. Well, to me it didn't preoccupied me a lot, I&nbsp;prefer to write than to check little boxes (though I have no idea about my grades on those exams), but WHAT THE HELL?? It didn't happen on HIS&nbsp;class, why did he had to punish us on HIS&nbsp;exams?&nbsp;Then, it seems like he confirmed that the alteration&nbsp;on the last exam was because of this. I knew it...<br /><br />Like you imagined, I&nbsp;almost&nbsp;fainted when I learned about all this when I returned back there on Tuesday&nbsp;night... --'<br /><br />Then, on&nbsp;Wednesday, some colleagues managed to irritate&nbsp;the Preventive teacher again. Luckily, it seems like&nbsp;he's not planning to get revenge on all of us for what happened. When&nbsp;will people learn:&nbsp;they can kid&nbsp;around with some teacher, they need to behave decently&nbsp;with others?! Someday those teachers will lose their mind. And they will punish&nbsp;ALL the class!<br /><br />On Thursday, I&nbsp;had my&nbsp;Pharmacology exam. Do you imagine the frustration:&nbsp;Wednesday's night I&nbsp;knew&nbsp;all the medication we needed to know, I&nbsp;knew for&nbsp;what they were&nbsp;used,&nbsp;I knew how they acted in the organism,&nbsp;I knew the effect they could have (good <em>and</em> bad), I&nbsp;knew how they were administrated, I knew practically <em>everything</em>. Still they managed to ruin my&nbsp;entire exam. It was like &quot;Medication X can be administrated orally. True or false?&quot; and I&nbsp;thought &quot;Well, it's mainly inallated. How&nbsp;the hell am I&nbsp;supposed to remember if it can be taken orally or not?!&quot;.&nbsp;Or maybe everytime they used information not present in the book. Or possibly that time when they asked questions about stuff which only information we had was &quot;There's not much known about these medications...&quot;<br /><br />So, I mean, I&nbsp;know we need to know these things. But, c'mon, how do you&nbsp;think doctors&nbsp;know&nbsp;all of these things? EXPERIENCE,&nbsp;people!&nbsp;They work for years around this and that's why everything becomes so normal for them!&nbsp;You know, I&nbsp;think it's very good that we can remember the&nbsp;general rules every exam. We have two weeks for study, TWO. And it's a lot of information. And we have two other classes at&nbsp;the same time. It's not easy, you know. We're not&nbsp;machines. But people&nbsp;don't understand. They don't know what it's like to have&nbsp;only two weeks to know all these details. So they keep calling us&nbsp;&quot;fool&quot;, &quot;lazy&quot;, &quot;overreacted&quot; and stuff. Maybe someday, when I'll end up at a mental institution, they'll say:&nbsp;&quot;Oh, maybe she <em>was</em> right&nbsp;when she mentioned all those problems...&quot;<br /><br />At least&nbsp;he other two exams weren't as bad.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Preventive teacher, in the&nbsp;end, made a very decent&nbsp;exam. The Psychology one&nbsp;had&nbsp; a few nasty questions, but&nbsp;maybe they're not enough to fail me. The worst part is&nbsp;that I&nbsp;always thought I&nbsp;could have a great grade at this class, and it probably ain't gonna&nbsp;happen. Oh, life goes on...<br /><br />I'm now taking&nbsp;my weekend off and it's&nbsp;tasting sooooo good. Tod bad&nbsp;it's almost gone by now.&nbsp;I'm now trying to prepare myself for next week, which won't&nbsp;be better than the last. Actually, I think it will be even worse. I&nbsp;just hope I&nbsp;won't feel too desperate when I&nbsp;realize I&nbsp;won't have&nbsp;enough time to study all the things needed for next exams. At least, I&nbsp;try to hear my older colleagues:&nbsp;&quot;Don't worry,&nbsp;by Christmas&nbsp;you'll all be able to relax... a little.&quot; XD&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm sorry for the huge post, but I really need to put all&nbsp;those things&nbsp;in the paper (?) once I can't talk to anybody (except my college colleagues), because&nbsp;no one understands what's going on in there. <br /><br />I think I'm going now. Have a wonderful week and try&nbsp;to be happy.&nbsp;:)<br /><br />Kisses and huggles to all of you,<br /><br />Belinha ***<br />"

I&nbsp;mean, why do they always choose MY&nbsp;year to make experiences?&nbsp;Everybody knows that third year is the worst, why are&nbsp;WE the ones who need to twist to fix other year's schedules? O.o I&nbsp;don't get it, really. Besides that, they keep complaining that people get high grades on exams because they're the same from past years, but they refuse to make new questions (their excuse:&nbsp;we don't have time). So now we don't have access to the correction of our exams - it's like, you're expecting an 18, you have a 12 but you don't know why because they don't let you see what you've done wrong. <br /><br />Tuesday, the 13th, was such a terrible day. The Preventive Medicine teacher said that the exam would be just multiple choices, but he changed his mind (without warning) and made a free answer test. Six questions for us to elaborate an answer. And they weren't difficult, but when your brain is prepared to a multiple choice exam, it doesn't work properly when they change the rules. He was really rude. And so was the other teacher, who kept complaining about our writing skills the entire time. Who does she think she is?&nbsp;The next class was just terrible - when will people learn that Power Point is a great tool WHEN USED PROPERLY?!&nbsp;It's just boring to death to be two hours listening to people who just read the Power Point presentation. And due to the long time wasted, I&nbsp;lost the bus and I only returned home yesterday.<br /><br />I'm studying Pharmacology... again. I'm already late because I felt terrible yesterday, I&nbsp;had a nasty headache and I felt very sleepy. I should be studying by now, but I got dizzy and I&nbsp;decided to take a pause. I'm probably not making much sense now, but it's the plain truth, I&nbsp;swear!&nbsp;XD<br /><br />I'm sorry I&nbsp;couldn't write more and more often. I'm going mad&nbsp;over that place. Hope&nbsp;it to be just a (bad)&nbsp;phase.&nbsp;<br /><br />See ya as soon as I&nbsp;can. Thanks for listening.<br /><br />***<br /><br />PS - OMG, I&nbsp;was invited to join a portuguese XF&nbsp;blog. How cool&nbsp;is that?&nbsp;=D&nbsp;Too bad I&nbsp;don't have much time to&nbsp;post in there...<br /><br />PS2 -&nbsp;I&nbsp;couldn't post it anywhere else, so I'm posting it&nbsp;here:&nbsp;happy birthday to Felix, Gillian's baby number 3, who turns one&nbsp;today. So sweet... ^^<br />&nbsp;</p>"

I&nbsp;planned to write something after my first exams, but I spend the weekend out and I&nbsp;hadn't much time to post in here.

XD<br /><br />I&nbsp;should get a life. --'<br /><br />Oh and by the way, remember when I&nbsp;said that&nbsp;school gives me inspiration to write fanfiction?&nbsp;Well, it's happening again. AND I DON'T HAVE ANY TIME TO WRITE THEM!!!&nbsp;So I'll try to relax and write some&nbsp;drabbles during those boring classes!&nbsp;:D<br /><br />And you won't believe it:&nbsp;channel FX suddenly appeared at my home and guess what?&nbsp;THEY'RE SHOWING SEASON 1 OF THE X-FILES EVERYDAY!!!&nbsp;Season one, I&nbsp;mean... I don't watch season one since 2004! I've stopped studying for one hour at ten o'clock every morning just to watch that thing. Today I saw <em>Ice</em>. I&nbsp;can't believe I&nbsp;watched&nbsp;that episode so many times before and I&nbsp;never noticed&nbsp;that the&nbsp;female doctor working&nbsp;with them was Felicity Huffman!&nbsp;XD<br /><br />Well, I'm going&nbsp;now.&nbsp;See you on Saturday, I&nbsp;hope.<br /><br />Wish me luck!&nbsp;^-^'&nbsp;<br /><br />Kisses ***<br /><br />"

"event","<p><br />I'm back!&nbsp;=D&nbsp;</p><p>I had a really good time at the beach. Being away for only one week is so much better than two. You know, other years always end up in the same way, the routine gets so annoying and everyone can't barely wait to return home. This year it didn't happen. <br /><br />The beach was great. We went to Foz do Arelho (a Wikipedia picture in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Foz_do_Arelho.png"">here</a>), which was a really good and calm place. We could actually swim in there because we were in the confluence of a lagoon and the ocean. The wheather was great, not very hot during day and a little cold at night (which I really like), and the house we rented was amazing. I&nbsp;even told my mom we should buy one of those houses to spend some weekends at the beach! XD<br /><br />I would say I'm going to post some pictures in here, but I say that every year and I never post them. My sister has the photos and I never know where she has them until months later!&nbsp;*lol*&nbsp;<br /><br />So, now it's September and I'm about to return to college for my third year. My classes start on the 14th and I already made my inscrition. Let's see how this year will be!&nbsp;=P Right now I&nbsp;think I'll enjoy the end of my Summer vacations.<br /><br />I'm working in a new HP&nbsp;fanfiction project, called <em>Closure. </em>It's a collection of short stories about the First and Second Wizard Wars in the books. I already wrote eight and I'm really happy with some of them. :)<br /><br />I'm going now, expecting to return soon. Stay well!&nbsp;^-^<br /><br />Huggles and kisses to all of you!<br />&nbsp;</p>"

"event","<br />So, I&nbsp;spent these last days at my dad's and I returned last Sunday (on Gillian's birthday ^-^&nbsp;I&nbsp;remembered the date, and I had an artwork planned for this day, but I wasn't at home and with my dad I don't have time to do&nbsp;anything so I couldn't make it. Maybe next year, I&nbsp;hope!) <br /><br />I enjoyed a birthday dinner last monday for my cousin Francisco (who turned 9 - Jesus, I still remember the night he was born!&nbsp;O.O&nbsp;I'm feeling old!) and&nbsp;I had a great time near my family. My cousins are back&nbsp;from the beach, which is great because I already missed them. My cousin Teresa&nbsp;complained the entire night about how much she had cried while reading <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</em> and&nbsp;they say baby Marta loved the sea! ^-^&nbsp;We'll spend a week at the same house they rented, so my mom wanted to know everything about it.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm looking forward to go to the beach this year. I&nbsp;need some fresh air to revive my ideas!&nbsp;=P We're leaving on August 24th.<br /><br />It's too hot today! I really can't function at all and&nbsp;hearing my mom complaining about it everyday only makes it worse! I&nbsp;think it's impressive how much I did for this summer (I'm being sarcastic, obviously!). Let's see:<br /><br />a)&nbsp;I brought some of my books to study Anatomy and Histology because they're so important next year and I can't recall much of it - <em>the books are still in the same place where I&nbsp;left them in June and I didn't read a page until now</em>;<br /><br />b) I have a bag full of books I&nbsp;borrowed from my cousin, because I already read everything I&nbsp;have at home and she always has great pieces with her - <em>I&nbsp;never read a single one and I have this book a friend of hers borrowed me almost a year ago and I only read two pages of it until now</em>;<br /><br />c) Like I&nbsp;said before, I had this wonderful dream in here I&nbsp;finished my <em>Out From Under</em> fanfiction during summer and I&nbsp;would have enough time to prepare my next big project - <em>I know it wouldn't be the first time, but I highly doubt I'll be able to write six chapters in a month, especially when I'm drowning in a thousand different ideas to another fanfiction projects</em>;<br /><br />d)&nbsp;I&nbsp;really wanted to find something to do this summer, maybe&nbsp;taking classes on drawing or theater&nbsp;- <em>but, if they exist, they're only accepting people under 16 years old, 19 at most</em>.<br /><br />See?&nbsp;This is why I&nbsp;hate summer!&nbsp;=P That and the fact that my insomnias are back&nbsp;- it's always in summer, especially because it's too hot, I can't sleep at night, I&nbsp;can't sleep during the day and I'm a <em>monster</em> when I don't get to sleep properly! O.o<br /><br />I'm going now. Maybe it will refresh a little at night. Let's hope so.<br /><br />Kisses!&nbsp;***"

I've done <em>nothing</em> in the past weeks, which is terrible in a way, and I presume I won't do much until September, when I'll start my third year in college. I&nbsp;really wish I could write some more things until then (I&nbsp;had this beautiful dream in where I&nbsp;would finish that <em>Out From Under</em> fanfiction during summer vacations), but I'm not sure about it.<br /><br />Interesting points from 2009 summer:<br /><br />- I left my old house in the place where I&nbsp;study and I'll live with my roomate in a new appartment, just the two of us, starting from September. I thought everything would be cool about this - I mean, people do this all the time - but noooo: the woman&nbsp;who rented us the&nbsp;old appartment went nuts and was really nasty when I&nbsp;talked to her over the phone. I&nbsp;just hope she won't be our teacher again this year. Because if she's decided to turn our third&nbsp;year a living Hell because of this, I'm ready to&nbsp;present a complain at the Police!<br /><br />- I watched <em>Harry&nbsp;Potter and the Half-Blood&nbsp;Prince</em>.&nbsp;Good,&nbsp;but I&nbsp;still prefer <em>The Goblet of Fire</em>. XD It felt like they cared a little too much about the romance and forgot the action, which was so important in this movie. Still, I&nbsp;laughed a lot. And I actually liked the ending, though it was a little different from the book and had its flaws. And the soundtrack was amazing!&nbsp;It definitely revived a little my passion for this fandom. I've even started writing HP&nbsp;fanfiction again. *-*<br /><br />Only two things... <em>very</em> interesting!&nbsp;XD<br /><br />I spend the last three days with my dad, we were with my relatives who came from France for the summer. It's still nice to see them, though it can be a bit boring to never being able to understand their conversations!&nbsp;=P I met my newest cousin, Melina, who's turning 3-months old in some days, and I&nbsp;laughed really hard while listening to other cousin trying to read a newspaper in portuguese - I can tell you, he's really good!&nbsp;XD&nbsp;<br /><br />I&nbsp;think I'm going now. I don't have much to say. Hope to see you soon. But I won't promise anything, because I'm terrible with promises!&nbsp;XD<br /><br />See ya!<br /><br />***<br /><br />PS - Happy birthday, Pate! =D</p>"

Too many times, actually. And most of the times, the movie sucks. <br /><br /><em>Most</em> of the times. Not always. Thank God!&nbsp;XD<br /><br />But, like I've said before, I'm a freak of nature. So, who knows, right?<br /><br />Now, let me introduce you my favorite movie trailers ever:<br />&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Top 5 Favourite Movie Trailers""><strong>My own Top 5 Favourite Movie Trailers</strong><br /><br />#5)<br />&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v475/BelinhaZpears/ps5-mr.png?t=1246820822"" /><br /><em><br />No laws. No limits. Only one rule. Never fall in love.</em> <br /><br /><lj-embed id=""8""/><br />I saw many people complaining about how this trailer made the movie look awful and silly. I can't see their point. I think it has everything that made this movie brilliant:&nbsp;the colours, the music, the passion and its strength. Powerful trailer. Powerful movie.<br /><br />#4)<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v475/BelinhaZpears/ps4-sh.png"" /><br /><br /><em>Do you know what they did after they finished with me?&nbsp;They laughed...<br /></em><br /><lj-embed id=""9""/><br />The movie has its flaws&nbsp;(actually, lots of flaws =P), but the trailer... oh baby!&nbsp;It's intense. It's hot. And, to be honest, I saw in here that we would see Gillian in all her best. Better trailer than movie.<br /><br />#3)<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v475/BelinhaZpears/ps3-hpatgof.png"" /><br /><br /><em>Only one will go down in History. Only one will reach eternal glory.</em><br /><br /><lj-embed id=""10""/><br />Still my favourite HP trailer (and movie, now that we're talking about this). This is pure gold. I admit&nbsp;I&nbsp;was feeling a&nbsp;little tired&nbsp;of HP&nbsp;back in 2005. I wasn't even excited about this movie! But when I saw this trailer, Jesus... I remember&nbsp;feeling an urgent need to&nbsp;watch&nbsp;GoF in the moment. I&nbsp;also remember feeling an urgent need to&nbsp;find this brilliant&nbsp;music. I cried a lot once I discovered it wasn't part of the oficial soundtrack. XD&nbsp;<br /><br />#2)<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v475/BelinhaZpears/ps2-sm.png"" /><br /><br /><em>I went on the show because I&nbsp;thought she'd be watching. (...)&nbsp;She's my destiny.<br /></em><br /><lj-embed id=""11""/><br />Beautiful. Just beautiful. A great and tender&nbsp;trailer for a great and tender&nbsp;movie. And I&nbsp;think that's all I have to say about this.<br /><br />P.S. - I should have discovered this trailer <em>before</em> the Oscars season!&nbsp;=P<br /><br />#1)<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v475/BelinhaZpears/ps1-tvs.png"" /><br /><br /><em>'Bout time. We've been waiting for you, guys.<br /></em><br /><lj-embed id=""12""/><br />I never wanted to watch a movie so bad after a trailer. Too bad it wasn't exactly what I expected. The movie is good, but it's kind of slow (Sofia Copolla's style, if you know it);&nbsp;I was hoping for something a little more... well, &quot;alive&quot;. But my love for this trailer remains until today. As you can see, right?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Especial thanks to <strong>sfilipin01</strong>, <strong>patigwblack</strong>, <strong>IntoxicateMe</strong>, <strong>FoxSearchlight </strong>and <strong>glows</strong>&nbsp;for the videos.<br /><br />Screencaps from <a href=""http://leavemethewhite.com/caps/thumbnails.php?album=181"">here</a>, <a href=""http://www.xfilesarchive.com/GillianAnderson/Closure/closurega.htm"">here</a>, <a href=""http://gallery.the-leaky-cauldron.org/album/317"">here</a>, <a href=""http://www.foursweatervests.org/slumdog/captures/index.php?page=1"">here</a> and <a href=""http://screenmusings.org/TheVirginSuicides/index.htm"">here</a>.

My brain went totally blank, I can't even get a decent sentence. =/ On the other hand, I've had lots of ideas for new fanfiction. Wish I wrote as fast as I think, it would save me a lot of despair and regret!<br /><br /><strong>Out From Under </strong>- I've wanted to&nbsp;write chapter nine since the very beginning of this fic. Now I've finally reached it, I&nbsp;finished it after, what, two months, but now I'm stuck again. Gah, I hate aftermaths... =P Note to everyone:&nbsp;I hate chapter 10!&nbsp;Wish I&nbsp;could just write &quot;Too complicated, couldn't write it, just imagine it&quot;... I can't wait to see it finished, though. I'm really proud of this work (until now, at least...) and I wouldn't want to give up on it.<br /><br /><strong>Dance With Me </strong>- I just don't know what to do about this one! I know I&nbsp;shouldn't have written it without knowing how things work in the USA, but I wanted to write it so bad, I&nbsp;barely could wait! =/&nbsp;Now that high school sistem doesn't work and I don't want to revise it all over again. On the other hand, I really like the final chapters, even though it's a teenage fic with a not-so-happy ending. Oh, and I don't have a beta-reader - I refuse to post a multi-chaptered fic online without a beta-reader! =P<br /><br /><strong>Adelatus</strong> - it's just a shortfic but I started it on April and look, it has only one sentence! ONE!! I'm stuck on the very first beginning of it. And I want to write it so bad. It's a piece around Mulder and Mrs. Scully during Scully's abduction. I'm part of that I Wish Mulder and Mrs. Scully Were BFF Group too. =P<br /><br /><strong>See the Sun </strong>- okay, this one is so strange I'm even scared to talk about it. But I&nbsp;would like to try it, even if I think people wouldn't like the idea very much. In this AU, Emily is in fact Melissa's daughter and Mr. Sim is the one behind his wife's murder, so Scully decides to adopt her niece. But then she discovers who Emily's father is and... well, it's scary, I say. =/&nbsp;But I'm so excited about it...<br /><br /><strong>Close to Home </strong>- huge, HUGE work around seasons 8 and 9 mythology. Actually, I&nbsp;need to revise the entire mythology!&nbsp;And I need lots of ideas for this one. I need to think of a way to explain how Mulder and Scully could prevent William to become the key to human salvation in 2012. I need to explain how on Earth William can be 27 years old and have no idea of who he is, who his parents are and why he was put up for adoption. If I work out this huge problem, I&nbsp;may have found out which fic will come next after OFU... ;)<br /><br /><strong>Closure</strong> - collection of drabbles around <em>Deathly Hallows</em>, how the characters dealed with the loss of their beloved ones and how they found the strenght to carry on. I don't want to mention the fact that I&nbsp;can't write a single decent drabble to include in here. Ooops, too late... =P<br /><br /><strong>You've Got a Way </strong>- I'm stuck at the end of this fanfiction since 2004!&nbsp;It's an Oliver/Katie fic (HP) and once I&nbsp;don't have anything else prepared, I&nbsp;would like to finish it and post it anytime soon. I only need four more chapters... but nothing comes out! ='(<br /><br /><strong>Until the End of the World </strong>- a Teddy/Victoire one, second generation (HP). Too lazy even to organize the chapters of this one! =P<br /><br />Sometimes I&nbsp;feel so embarrassed of myself... **blush in shame**<br /><br />So, once I'm like this, I've been watching tv. I've been watching lots of tv... Maybe this is the answer to the question:&nbsp;&quot;Unlike everybody else, why do I&nbsp;get so fat over the Summer?&quot;&nbsp;=P So far I've discovered:<br /><br />-&nbsp;you can always&nbsp;find new&nbsp;details around <strong>The X-Files</strong> episodes, even in those&nbsp;you've watched 149 times before;<br /><br />- <strong>E.R.</strong> was such a good show!&nbsp;Why did they cut off the best characters, killed everyone who was decent in there and put new faces every year? I tried to watch some episodes but I couldn't stand them! I want early E.R. back!&nbsp;='(<br /><br />- <strong>Malcolm in the Middle </strong>needs to be one of the best comic shows ever! XD&nbsp;Everyone is amazing in there, especially the old creepy grandma! I can't stop laughing while watching it. And boy, if I laugh hard when my mom complains everyone is nuts in there!&nbsp;X'D<br /><br />-<strong> Criminal Minds </strong>makes me feel sorry for not studying Criminal Psychology! =/ That damn thing is so interesting - I feel tempted to read a lot about every single case they deal with in there. And the characters, they're amazing. It's kind of shocking to see Huff's wife running after criminals (Paget Brewster, I watched some episodes of &quot;Huff&quot; before) but still... XD&nbsp;Oh, and I love Reid. Don't ask me why!&nbsp;XD<br /><br />- I rediscovered my love for <strong>House M.D.</strong> Unfortunately, I&nbsp;kind of lost my love for Chase/Cameron - but I&nbsp;love Foreman/Thirteen now. I really like the new team;&nbsp;I guess I&nbsp;like them even more than the other. Not sure why, I think now Chase&nbsp;and&nbsp;Cameron are fine working on different areas. =P&nbsp;Too bad what happened in <em>Simple Explanation</em>. DAMN, he was my favourite character!! I'm still in denial. And I cry everytime I&nbsp;think about it!&nbsp;='(<br /><br />- <strong>CSI:NY&nbsp;</strong>can be a very good friend while dealing with late night insomnias!&nbsp;=P I love Gary Sinise!&nbsp;*-* Oh, and Danny/Lindsay is cute!<br /><br />- I miss <strong>Cold Case</strong>. And&nbsp;Mick&nbsp;St. John... I&nbsp;mean, <strong>Moonlight</strong>!&nbsp;=(&nbsp;<br /><br />And that's it. Crappy talk?&nbsp;Yeah, I know that... I just wanted to say I'm still alive. And post something... even if stupid! XD<br /><br />Have fun!&nbsp;*-*<br /><br />;)<br /><br /><br />"

Maybe we're not all like &quot;best friends on the planet&quot;, but at least I&nbsp;can be myself near them and if I joke around them they know me too well to not take me seriously - well, most of the time!&nbsp;XD 

God, I'll be a third year student by September!&nbsp;:O 

I have lots of icons to post here, but at the same time I&nbsp;feel pretty lazy to do so!&nbsp;=P And my recent ones are at my other computer, so I&nbsp;guess I need to wait some more. Hope to do it soon enough. 

Oh and one question - I know I've asked you this like a zillion times before, but I&nbsp;keep forgettin it and for that I'm sorry!&nbsp;Anyway: 

How can I&nbsp;have a beautiful layout made my me, like some of you have?&nbsp;I'm sick and tired of the things I&nbsp;find on the LJ, I&nbsp;would like to try something of my own, but I&nbsp;can't remeber how to do it! =( 

Thanks in advance to someone who can answer me! 

I think I'll go now. Jesus, if I am lazy... XD 

Bye!&nbsp;***"

"event","<br />My skills are over again and this time they're over for good. Well, &quot;second grade&quot; good!&nbsp;=P<br /><br />These last weeks have been so crazy, you have no idea! I had this miserable low grade at an Endocrinology exam, it really felt like a slap on my face. <br />After that, I decided to skip college for a week, I stayed at home, I studied for my exams and I can tell you: it felt so DAMN GOOD, they should let us do this all the time! The Endocrinology one was a little difficult, we had too much schemes and enzymes and all that stuff, I had a nasty blank at some point, but it went out fine. The other one was&nbsp;very easy, but once again, I&nbsp;need to say I&nbsp;just love pregnancy and&nbsp;birth and&nbsp;related processes, it was a pleasure to study it&nbsp;-&nbsp;this must be the Obstretrics bug biting me!&nbsp;^-^<br /><br />Next , we return to classes, which&nbsp;have been boring and a waste of time. I&nbsp;still&nbsp;haven't read much about this new information and I have the exam on monday. Well, I'll try&nbsp;not to stress much about&nbsp;it. Who would say, I&nbsp;already&nbsp;read *two* chapters (they're 7).&nbsp;XD<br /><br />This delay on the exam and my study was due to the fact that they changed&nbsp;our schedule and we had our final skills evaluations this week, instead of the next one. It caught us a little off-guard, but now we can't complain, right?&nbsp;At&nbsp;least they're over and we don't need to worry about them anymore!&nbsp;XD&nbsp;They went pretty&nbsp;good, I&nbsp;think. Well,&nbsp;maybe they could have&nbsp;been a little better if I hadn't been so&nbsp;damn nervous (and damn stupid, like always =P), but I can't&nbsp;calm down in there - gah,&nbsp;I hate to be doing something and have&nbsp;someone next to me observing everything I do, staring&nbsp;and, worse, deciding if you're about to&nbsp;*pass* or *fail*! At&nbsp;least the examinator was nice&nbsp;or&nbsp;I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;wouldn't be here right now. <br />Now that I&nbsp;think about it, I'm really embarassed everytime I&nbsp;remember how stressed I was on monday because of this, I swear my heart stopped for about ten seconds while I was entering the evaluation room!&nbsp;=P<br /><br />Hey, I'm sorry, I&nbsp;just needed to let all this&nbsp;stress flow.&nbsp;I can't believe it's over.&nbsp;I can't believe next year will be&nbsp;SO&nbsp;much worse!&nbsp;=X<br /><br />I&nbsp;can't believe me and my&nbsp;roommate finally had our movies night!&nbsp;=D&nbsp;We watched <em>Billy Elliot - </em>God,&nbsp;how I&nbsp;love this&nbsp;movie!&nbsp;*__* And guess what:&nbsp;we were talking about&nbsp;tv&nbsp;shows and&nbsp;after I&nbsp;told her the story, she told me she was interested in watching The X-Files <em>Aubrey.&nbsp;</em>My nerd side says:&nbsp;yuppi!&nbsp;XD<br /><br />Okay, guys, I think I'll&nbsp;go now. Gee, I'm so tired I don't even know&nbsp;how was I&nbsp;able to get into here at these&nbsp;hours!&nbsp;Wish you all things good, peeps. Have fun! :)<br /><br />***<br />&nbsp;"

I don't know the entire pelvic Anatomy, but I think&nbsp;I&nbsp;knew enough to pass&nbsp;yesterday's exam. I was expecting a Greek tragedy and&nbsp;it didn't happen. Oh God, I really hope to get at least an 11!&nbsp;=P<br />&nbsp;<br />Watching <strong>Mamma Mia</strong> made me (re)discover ABBA's songs.

"event","<br />Well, I&nbsp;am. I&nbsp;had one of the most terrible weeks due to my crazy head. <br /><br />Classes were terrible, one of my teachers is a moron and I'm feeling so stupid. I had good grades on the past exams, though. Woo-woo!!&nbsp;=) The other day we went looking for some copies we needed to study and I left the wrong pages for the man to copy... and the damn store was full of colleagues when we realized that. I&nbsp;almost broke the my friend's car window with my umbrella and later I almost broke our kitchen table. And today I think my stupidity made me lock the door of my friend's room and then I forgot that moment and she was so terrified because she had no idea why her door was locked.<br /><br />...<br /><br />It's cold and though I like the winter, HELLO, it's April!!! =/ And I want summer vacations, I'm so sick and tired of studying!&nbsp;Blargh...<br /><br />Me and some friends watched <strong>Mamma Mia </strong>the other day. Cute, but I didn't find it &quot;ZOMG.BEST.MOVIE.EVER!!!&quot; like some people did - including my friends. The moment with Donna and Sophie before the wedding (the &quot;Slipping Through&nbsp;My Fingers&quot; one)&nbsp;is very beautiful, though. I love ABBA's songs for too much time to be amazed now, I think. =) By the way, &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; needs to be one of the most amazing songs I've ever heard! *_* <br /><br />I need to study this weekend, but I&nbsp;don't want to! =(&nbsp;Well, at least, I just need nine more points now to pass the year. God, can't wait for that moment! <br /><br />Kisses to all. Sorry if I messed up things at this Lj or yours last week, but my other computer sucks! =P And my mind too!<br /><br />***"

"event","<p><br />OMG, everybody's sick!&nbsp;O.O&nbsp;And it's not just the flu, oh no... everybody's crazy!!!<br /><br />Yesterday, my teachers came like an hour late for classes! And they were terrible... do you know what it feels like to be 4 hours sitting on your butt looking at nothing, listening to nothing, having no idea of what you're doing in there, thinking that you're wasting your life in there? Yep... my classes yesterday!<br /><br />My Gastro teacher was sick, so he kind of had an excuse (not a great one, though&nbsp;=P). But the Primary Care one&nbsp;wasn't - actually she was the substitute for the sick teacher (flu, what else?). And she is soooooo mean! O.O Can you imagine that she blames us for everyhting bad that happens?!&nbsp;<br /><br />- We were blamed because the documents necessary for the classes weren't available at the time;<br />- We were blamed because she's not our teacher and she doesn't have a clue of what she's doing in there;<br />- We were blamed because we have no idea of what should we be learning at this time (oh, C'MON, we didn't even know of what was supposed to be Primary Care...);<br />- We were blamed because there were no books available;<br />- We were blamed because everybody has the flu and it's so cold and we're in crisis and the world is a cruel word and children are starving...</p><p>Okay, I was joking on the last one! =P But the other ones are so true... she sounds like those Marine guys, you know? She's always screaming and stuff... oh please!!</p><p>At least we had some good things today. The Gastro teacher really liked&nbsp;my group's&nbsp;presentation on the colon, liver and gall bladder - too bad he thought my part was so important&nbsp;he made me&nbsp;say it twice!&nbsp;XD&nbsp;One of my colleagues must have been bitten by an hyena, or something,&nbsp;because she laughed the entire&nbsp;presentation (and they were those annoying gigglings, you know... hi hi hi,&nbsp;ah ah ah). By the end I was the one who wanted to laugh when the teacher said that her group hadn't been paying attention to our work, so now they'll have to make a new presentation on our part next week!&nbsp;XD<br /><br />Besides this, everyone is going mad because of copies. Why do people always want to have copies of *everything*?&nbsp;I mean, we already have like 100 pages of anatomy to learn, shouldn't they just don't care about 100 more of books that teachers only recomend as &quot;complementary reading&quot;? And it's not just that... we have, like, 4 copy machines to the entire colllege. Can you imagine the madness? People take HOURS in there! And now imagine the poor machines, it's the second day of the period and they already broke like ten times... each day! **roll eyes**<br /><br />Everybody's crazy, I'm saying!&nbsp;Hope this is just the &quot;new year's joy&quot;, or this is going to be a looooooong year...<br /><br />By the way, I already watched <strong>The House of Mirth </strong>and <strong>Straightheads</strong>, and I liked them, but I'll leave a detailed message next time, once it's so late now and I have a practical class tomorrow morning. ;)&nbsp;<br /><br /><a href=""http://lovely-treasure.livejournal.com/profile""><img height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" style=""border-right: 0px; padding-right: 1px; border-top: 0px; vertical-align: bottom; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px"" src=""http://p-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://lovely-treasure.livejournal.com/""><b>lovely_treasure</b></a>&nbsp;your present is still late!&nbsp;=(&nbsp;And I hate myself for that!&nbsp;<br /><br />I fell asleep while I was writing <em>Out From Under</em>!

Thank God tomorrow is my last class for the week or I don't think I would survive!&nbsp;=P<br /><br />Have a nice week you all!&nbsp;Hope it's a little more calm than mine!<br /><br />Bel ***<br /><br />PS - Our Primary Care book is in Spanish. What do those people have against English, anyway?&nbsp;I&nbsp;know I'm supposed to understand Spanish, yeah, but one thing is to listen&nbsp;to a teacher&nbsp;or to&nbsp;read a little text, another is to study six chapters for an exam. That thing gives me headaches! :O <br />And what the hell&nbsp;does &quot;<em>zanja</em>&quot; means?</p>"

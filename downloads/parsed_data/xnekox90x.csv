"event","I know I&#39;m late on this. Really late probably, but I just watched The Secret Life of Walter Mitty for the first time. As most movies go, I was expecting a dull two hours at most with some minor explosions thrown into the mix to ensure the audience stays awake long enough to get through the same supervenious plot line that most movies put you through now a days. To my mild shock, and extreamly sated movie taste buds, what I received was an unexplained fullness I have not had the pleasure of aquianting with many movies. Walter Mitty has a simple message (one that I throughly try to endorse each day of my life): you rule your life; go out there and make it your own adventure. The songs matched the moods, and eventually I even forgot my current existance of babysitting the neighbors&#39; new born; enough so to remember I can plan trips and financially make them work. The movie was engaging, the acting genuine, and the plot point simplistically impactful. Not once was I borde out of my mind, nor dozing off. In fact, I enjoyed it so much, that the end of the movie left that delightful you just finished reading a book feeling. In today&#39;s world this rarely happens. This positive masterpeice reminds us a little of hope, and that we can still on our lives.

It is incredible how it has resonated with me, so I may be a little biased and skewed in my thinking. The last time I wrote I was in a basement of Nik&#39;s parents house in Colorado Springs. Curently I am writing from a quaint little condo nearby a shore on Lake Michigan. Although I cannot say my streets are quite, because I live in one of the biggest cities in the United States, it has been something getting here. As I mentioned, I did not know where I would be. So here I am, living in Chicago, with Nik; planning a wedding, dealing with loss, sadness, happiness, stress, reliefe, and wanting more from life. Much like Walter, I am waiting for something (like my life) to begin. Yet looking back, I must say what a life I have lived already. Traveling to Europe for my graduation present, working with kiddos that needed someone to stand up for them, meeting the love of my life, losing an everlasting friend and sister, and moving to Chicago.

Curently I am contemplaiting my work possibilities, and I find myself ccoming back to writing and editing. Much like Walter I feel financial responsibility for my family, both back home and here. And mush like Walter I find myself longing for adventure. To travel, see the wrold, sit quietly and observe; that sounds like something. But also to be a part of peoples lives, make friends, combine cultures, and make connections between worlds is also something. I feel like maybe I am living the adventure, although it&#39;s not as glamorous as traveling to Iceland or Greenland, who knows. At this point I could be there next month. I&#39;ve already done a cross country move (again), and at this rate we could be living in Canada, France, or Hong Kong in the next two years or so.

Nik works for a high end company that deals with merchendising minus the tv commercial part. The companies clients include Mickey D&#39;s, L&#39;Oreal, and a few other major producers. And Nik? He&#39;s good at what he does. I guess I&#39;m lucky that way. I found a man who regardless of what has been in his way, has found a path to his dreams. I look up to him for it. He&#39;s kind of like my Sheryl from the movie. Just like Walter I got laid off from work at Kepner, due to budget cuts. So I&#39;m trying to find my way, just as he does in the movie. I suppose that&#39;s why it resinates with me so much. It simply is a universal reminder of going out, getting it for your own; taking power of your destiny and life. I can do anything out there, I just haven&#39;t found my everything yet, but I will. I&#39;m certain. I&#39;ve gotten this far haven&#39;t I? &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"

"event","It has been a long time coming, but I find it more difficult to accept my parents views of how things should be as right. I know that any woman out there, in particular women who are anything American first generation immigrant, or first born in America find it difficult to identify with their cultural background completely not influenced by where they live now, in America. The pressures of women having to abide by their cultural and familial standards in a country where freedom and equality are preached to them everyday is not only frustraiting, but also very difficult and emotionally tiring. Families expect their young women to follow all the rules they instil, while going through schools young women learn that they can be treated equally to all of their peers, including the males, and the social stigma of male to female roles is not as much in place as it is in other cultures and countries.&nbsp;

That being said it is difficult to expect female anything Americans, as all women are encompassed in this from other cultural backgrounds, to follow exactly what their families want them to. Which brings me back to my original point, I cannot stand how no matter how hard I try, and I&#39;m not sure how many of you out there feel the same, I cannot please anyone, finding that my cultural background as a first generation immigrant women raised in both my home country and here is not satisfied with my attempts to balance both. My family expects me to be the perfect young woman, who follows their rules and how they want me brought up (a Catholic abiding familial regulations angel). Americans are surprised that I&#39;m not their ideal of the busy working modern business woman who finds comfort in a busy downtown life style with not enough time for sleep. I just want to point out one thing, why can anyone not accept that I would rather be a me I formed as a 22 year old, college graduate, that loves to balance both worlds. Who I still very much a modern woman, Pagan, Liberal, unaffiliated with any political movements, school teacher, who loves to go out on certain weekends, stay in on others, and simply enjoys being who she is without anyone trying to change her. I am very comfortable in my own skin, so why can no one else in both worlds appreciate that? Strictly speaking of society and families here.&nbsp;

Anything Ameican women have a certain standard they must adhere to on both sides and cannot begin to know which one is better. Do you honor familial wishes though you do not agree? Or do you honor the wishes of society to better fit in? Do you stay true to yourself and fight constantly with both sides and grow tired of pointless arguments? Do you give in and lose yourself to simply be left alone and please both sides in different situations? Sadly there is no answer. Each woman must find her own way, but simply until culutral backgrounds and the current place of inhabitance see the stress and difficulties anything American women have to survive each day, there will never be the calm peace each side wishes for their daughters, mothers, &nbsp;sisters, and friends.&nbsp;"

Firstly I&nbsp;always excersice before I&nbsp;go to sleep, somehow it just relaxes me and gets rid of pent up frustrations and such things that always get in my way of sleeping, also I&nbsp;tend to not really eat right before bed, and if I&nbsp;do eat it usually is something light. Since the body is preparing to rest, theres really nothing you should be ingesting right before bed, because then itll just get in the way of relaxing and letting everything go, since your body is trying to consume the energy its like giving yourself a shot of esspresso when you find it hard to stay awake. Also less coffee is a good idea, especially in the late late afternoon. If there is a sleep trouble coffee is not a good idea. Than I&nbsp;usually take the time to relax, just some me time, even if thats just in the shower or in the bathtub alone for half an hour. That time is valuable. Its the time I&nbsp;can think over everything, relax, and wind down from the days events. And once I&nbsp;have thought everything over, I&nbsp;can much easeir fall asleep knowing I&nbsp;somehow have found an answer to my porblems from the day, or some&nbsp;sort of solution to whatever has been bugging me. And so... with these tips I&nbsp;usually&nbsp;get to sleep with no worries. Sometimes when I&nbsp;can't fall asleep,&nbsp;I just get up from my bed physically and then do something like read a book, just&nbsp;to make my eyes tiered enough, so that they will want to close&nbsp;by&nbsp;themselves helping me&nbsp;get to sleep faster. These are all the things I use that help me sleep like a baby. I hope they can help&nbsp;someone else too. &nbsp;"

And I think its a lot more fun to send postcards from places you visit and letters that you got to the place you were going. Besids Now that mobile phones have turned into mini computers and all people do anymore is write to each other instead of talk on them, its pointless really to have them unless you have some way of sending written word. In the end written word seems more powerful and more usefull in every aspect of comunication, and as for sending it fast? Why should I?

It keeps you tied down and entertained from page to page. And it's so realistic that you know it could happen, and that it did happen.

It would have to be lets seee here..... The Knowing Conversations Because everythingthat I do everything my life revolves around is simple conversations, an so much more, mind convos, people convos, writing convos everything around my life revolves about communication and understanding. And its seeing things in a differnet way. I'm very open minded so as it comes I think about many different things at once. I know it might not sound like much but it truelly is, considering the meanings of both words and the depth behind both. Thats how I am and thats how my life is."

Ok so for those who know me this is totally my subject. I am a read aholic. A bibliophil (lover of books). Since I was a little little girl my mom would read to me or my grandpa or my aunt. Basically whever I was I would always try to read myself or have someone read to me if I could get my hands on a book. And once I moved to America, because I was born in Poland, that is how I learned how to speak English. I would read tons upon tons of books from classics to the newest novels. And soon I learned how to read above my grade level. I think in 6th grade I began reading books at the collage reading level. And I loved them. I love all types of books. At anyrate right now I am reading a book called The Lightbearer's Daughter, a thrid book to a seireis. Then I am also reading a book called The Age of Innocence, and then there is The Stranger, and The Life of Pi. So yes many books but many of them are for school the first one listed however is just for enjoyment. And I would recommend all of them. Just books in general. I've read so many that I dont even remember which ones I havent read. xD So books are part of my life, andthanks to them I have been a writer and a poet. They are important in everything we do. Thats my oppinion anywayz. =D"

Ok so I dont know about any other people, but for the ones that know me this is a no brainer. PIRATES ALL THE WAY! The ocean is an amazing thing. And the adventures all the Pirates had. I mean imagen a world free of oppression where women and men were equal! In that time it was something amazing! Total compleate freedom under your own structured ruling system, life on the sea, in the water, in any place you want to be in, always going with the waters. Its something amazing. And its something that I would love to be a part of. Since I was a little I was amazed by the waters and by Pirates. Never stopped making me wonder and imagen. I guess I'm just someone that loves adventure, and that her only love is the ocean. The ocean was made to love and be loved by me."

My little brother is the apple of my eye. I love him dearly. More then the world itself and more then my life. He is the next thing after God that is dearest to me. If anything were to happen to him I really dont know what I would do. Thanks to him I'm not lonely, I have greater morals, and try to do a little better then others every day. I wake up every morning thanks to him. I really live for him, knowing that he watches everything I do and tries to copy it. He is the one thing in my life I am sure is perfect. Thanks to him I tryto be the best person that I can possibly be so that he has an example and role modle which he can look up to. He really is the one who has taught me how to be a person, kind and caring, and open to knew hthings. Hes taught me paitent and responsobility. I may complain about him sometimes, but I love him more then air. I can trust him with anything and its something I always look frward to. I love everything about him. Hes my little brother and always will be. Hes changed me so much, more then I can possibly explain anymore. And I'm glad that hes my little brother and no one elses."

I would merge two photos into one using a whole bunch of stuff. I would take my grandpas picture, and then I would take my families picture and put it together to make one picture then I would have that one. I love my friends but still, My family is so important. If I could possibly put all the faces of those I love onto my one photograph I would so that I would have all ofthe people I loved close by me all of the time. And that would include all of my friends, all of myfamily, and my grandpa, parents, borther, and grandma. So thats the photograph I would have. I'd make a cologe and put everyone on it then take a photograph of the colloge makeit a big photograph and have that with me. And itd be a lot of different moments too. So yhea.

I remember he day like it was yesterday. I was nine and I was helping my dad clean out the basement for the hollidays. So he left for work and for me to finish up my cleaning. I started to finish dusting, and I found a stack o papers laying out so I took them to put them away. When i looked at them though(like any kid would cause theyre curious), I saw that the papers were mine, and I wrote them in Polish working hard on them, to Santa. I had found my letters to Santa. It was a stack from way back when I was five to that year! I was so upset. I took the letters to my mom threw them in front of her and literly demanded what the papers were. And she looked at me awstruck. I was very upset and I told her that I found my letters to Santa. And she went quiet. Then I picked them up and started to swing them around before her nose, lecturing her how she shouldn't lie to me like that ever again, andhow it hurt and I remember I started crying, and then got very angry, especially at myself because I let them fool me into believing there was such a thing as Santa Claus. So that holiday sucked because I was still angry at myself for being so stupid, then the next year I found out where my parents kept the presents and would look at them for revenge. XD"

Anything and everything. One word could be said and because of that one word i have five billion things forming in my head. But I always liked writing. It was one of the many things I could escape to and excell in. I became very strong and my mom supported me in all my writing through tears and laughs. And so basically anything I feel really strongly about. I've been published twice with my poems (with no pay but its all good) and am working on a third time. Writing is my life. And I really enjoy any form of it. Yes even those brian teasing essays you wanna throw through the window off the 90th floor after doing anything and everything violent to it imaginable. I am rather proud of those when I'm done with the,m. So there that does it. Writing Nerd but thats ok. I love it too much to care! =D"

And yhea this is just one of those things no one can explain. But I told someone off! Big anger manegment just got lifted made me feel a lot better. But I would hate being the person that got told off by me right now. He's probobly crying in some little dark corner in his imagination. I wonder if he even has one. Huh??????? *ponders on that for a sec* Oh well. Don't care bout him. He can go and fall off a cliff and I wouldn't care. I know being mean. But hey don't get on my bad side. Oh and I'm out of Study Hall! Yes *waves flags around* Power to the people!!!!!!!!!!!!

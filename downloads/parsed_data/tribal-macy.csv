"event","Macy didn't waste any time leaving the cafe.  When he was bored he had to move and get about in a short amount of time or he got really moody.  He had waved his farewell to those in the cafe and just lead the way as he knew Kerry was following.  He hoped Kerry was appreciating his help.  He found his way outside the Mall to some kind of bridge like thing that looked over part of the city and you could watch some people as they walked down the street below.

Macy turned around leaning against the short cement wall.  ""So Casinova...""  He lightly punched Kerry in the arm.  It was so obvious that a decent amount of the girls had checked Kerry out the minute he entered the cafe and it was also obvious that Kerry had checked them out...although stressing all the same.  ""Chicks are hot, aren't they?"""

"event","<lj-cut text=""Ryan's Tribe Votes"">
Macy had walked the long journey back to the Eco camp almost in half the time, he was cranky about the outcome, but he wanted to tell his siblings who he'd just seen, and what had been said. As soon as he entered the Eco Camp, he was attacked by a flying Flower hug. ""Did you see him? What did he say?"" she asked, tugging at his shirt, her freckled face beaming up excitedly at him. She knew he wasn't supposed to go to the City, but she also knew when he'd left to go, and why. 

""Yeah, I saw him,"" Macy grumped, ruffling her hair in a semiplayful way, nodding a quick nod to Kerry who had just exited from a tent behind her. Flower was the nosiest one of them all, and not like Willow, she just wanted to know everything so she could talk, not because she had a thirst for knowledge. She annoyed him, however, and he tried walking around her, ignoring her. 

Flower huffed in frustration, she wasn't so easily fobbed off, and she chased after him, tugging at his shirt, ""What did he say? Did he say he was coming home?"" She was persistent, but she saw Kerry and stopped, racing over to him and pulling on his shirt, ""He saw Daddy! He's going to tell us what he said, isn't he Kerry?? Make him tell,"" she demanded, crossing her arms and looking back to Macy. 

Kerry frowned, standing there with his arms crossed over his chest, ""Macy, you shouldn't have gone to the city, you know that, what if the Technos followed you back again, what if you got hurt?"" He tilted his head down and looked at Macy with his eyebrow raised, disappointed. Anna and Willow followed him out of the tent and looked to each other nervously, if he had really seen Ryan, if he had really talked to him, what would he say? What was it Ryan had said, that was the real question, not why Macy went in the first place. 

""So? I didn't did I? Look around Kerry, do you see any big bad boogie men? Pshht,"" he gave him a look of contempt, twisting his mouth into a frown. ""Look, you wanna hear what Pops said, or you wanna fight about me leaving to see him in the first place?"" 

Willow moved around Kerry, ""Did you Macy? Did you really see him,"" she craned her neck to see if Ryan was behind him, hiding, waiting to surprise them. ""Isn't he with you?"" she asked, her forehead creasing with worry, her eyes seeming to frown with her mouth in worry. 

Anna too was worried, Ryan had said he was going to go help friends, and she understood that, but why wasn't he back yet? ""Is he with his friends now? Are they safe? Can he come home now?"" She stood there, her forefinger picking at the skin on the side of her thumb nervously, ruining her cuticle. She wanted Ryan home just as much as the others, though she didn't want him coming home when he wasn't ready, when his friends still needed him just because of the six of them, they were safe, and well looked after here with the Eco's. 

Kerry gave Anna a small smile, always thinking of others wellbeing before her needs, and he gave Willow a reassuring pat on the shoulder before turning his gaze back to Macy. He looked nervous, which was kind of strange for Macy, and the grumpiness, though sometimes rather normal, seemed heightened today. ""Well? Are you going to tell us or stand there trying to burn holes into the ground beneath you with your eyes?"" 

Macy looked up sharply, snapping, almost spitting out the words, ""Yeah, he's with his stupid friends ok? The Mall Rats, and that's where he's stayin,"" Macy had a sour look on his face, and he pulled his hat from his head, turning it around backwards, moving past them all to head into the tent, nodding in the direction of Tatty, though he knew he didn't look up. He unrolled his bed and lay down, taking his hat off and resting against the floor, hands under his head. 

""No!"" Willow gasped, ""He can't, he has to come home, he wouldn't abandon us, would he?"" She clasped her hands and held them before her chest, looking up at Kerry nervously, Ryan just simply wouldn't do that, it wasn't like him. 

Flower's mouth hung open, following Macy into the tent, her hands on her hips as she stopped and gave him a sassy look, ""Don't tease Macy, that's not funny,"" she scolded, disbelief on her face. 

""I'm not teasing Flower, I saw that Tribal marking on his hand, alright? He's wearing their stupid pentagram or whatever, he's been accepted back in, and he ain't leavin,"" he wasn't happy, and he didn't want to go live in the stupid Mall with those people, the ones who'd always left Ryan looking so hurt in the past. 

Anna followed Kerry into the tent, looking over at him, she knew what Tribal markings meant, they all wore the mark of their Tribe on their cheeks, it meant they belonged. Macy, of course, had a history of elaborating stories, but this time he seemed sincere, and she felt at a loss for words. What were they to do? ""What does Ryan want us to do then? Just live here forever without him?"" She could feel the tears welling in her eyes, she didn't want that to be true, she couldn't stand to lose another person in her life. 

Kerry frowned, he knew better than everyone else just exactly why, and who, Ryan had gone to help, and he was supportive of however long it took. If Ryan could rescue her from whoever was holding her, if he could work out the pain and history they both had together, well Ryan would be happier, and that mattered a lot to Kerry. He knew it could also take a lot longer than any of the younger kids could know, ""What exactly did he say, Macy,"" he asked slowly but kindly. 

Macy tossed onto his side, then his stomach, resting his chin on his hands folded in front of him, he didn't want to tell them, what if they didn't want to go? Then again, what if they did? Macy didn't see a positive outcome of either, ""He wants us to come to the Mall,"" he said quietly, his voice still gruff, but pitching in hope at the end. 

Flower bounced on the spot, clapping her hands excitedly and dashing over to where Macy was, flinging herself down ontop of him and ignoring his protests and grunts, hugging him tightly, ""Yah Daddy wants us to be with him, let's go, I miss Daddy,"" she crawled off of Macy and bounced over to Kerry, ""let's go Kerry, come on, please?"" 

Willow pressed her hand to her mouth, go live with Ryan? In the Mall? This meant that things were serious, but why? Who was this friend he'd gone to save? Why would he stay in the City and bring the kids there after all he'd told them of it's badness? 

Kerry watched the faces of his siblings as this news sunk in, even Tatty had looked up from his work, pausing, staring at Anna and blinking. ""We need to vote,"" Kerry said softly, taking a seat on his bedroll and motioning for his siblings to do the same on theirs. When they'd each taken a seat, Kerry addressed each one with a glance, then began. ""Ryan left us here so we'd stay safe, I don't know who was holding his friend prisoner, but he felt very seriously about rescuing her from them. You should all know,"" Kerry glanced down, a troubled look on his face. He hated to break the confidence he had with Ryan, but if they were going to all decide to move into the City, a place where bad things had happened to all of them, then they needed to know exactly why. Kerry looked up, making eye contact with each kid as he spoke, ""Salene is not just his friend. She was his wife once before. The Chosen also split them up, and Ryan has always been very remorseful of the fact that things happened they way they did and that he didn't do more to, to stop them,"" Kerry frowned. ""He went to save not just Salene, but to save other friends also being held. If he's back at the Mall, that means they are safe, and I assume it also means that he and Salene have made amends,"" Kerry set his jaw, watching reactions. 

Flower bounced on her butt, ""That means we have a Mommy too!! I want a Mommy, I want to go where Daddy is Kerry, let's go now!""

Anna nodded slowly, ""It won't be like the Chosen schools, right?"" She knew that couldn't be right, and Willow too shook her head, as if reading her mind, ""No, he wouldn't do that to us Anna, it has to be a safe place. Who knew Ryan was married? I didn't. That's really, wow,"" Willow looked dazed, and her mind was filling rapidly with a million questions, none she could ask right now, it wasn't appropriate. 

Kerry too shook his head, ""No, he wouldn't take us to a place like that, I trust that this Mall is a safe place to live,"" he interjected softly. Ryan would never put any of them in a situation anything near resembling the Chosen experience, Kerry knew that for sure in his heart. ""We must vote. All those in favor of going to stay with Ryan in the Mall, raise your hand,"" he instructed, watching as Willow, Anna, Flower (bouncing up and down in the air), then Tatty raised their hands. ""Macy?"" 

Macy rolled his eyes, shaking his head and watching the naive children that were his brothers and sisters. Sure it was the city, and he'd give anything to live in the City again, but not with those people, and that woman. ""I don't like that woman,"" he decided, scowling.

""Her name is Salene, Macy, and we have to respect that Ryan loves her, that is not our choice,"" Kerry said, raising his eyebrow and then his hand. Macy was now outvoted 5 to 1. 

""Come on Macy, if Ryan thinks it's alright, then it has to be,"" Willow reasoned, lowering her hand, watching as Flower almost seemed about ready to burst out of her skin with excitement and frustration. 

""Shut up Chosen Girl, you don't know nothin, ok? This is the City, not just another house somewhere. Whenever I would bring news back from the city, Ryan would get this look on his face,"" Macy shuddered at the thought, ""I don't want to live somewhere that makes him look like that twenty four seven, ya know?"" 

""Don't call her Chosen Girl Macy,"" Anna responded evenly, ""Look, I understand what you mean, and how you feel, but we're family, and we stick together. If Ryan chooses to live somewhere that will make him miserable, that is his choice. We should go and be supportive, at least be there for him. He's not coming back here, ok, fine, then let's go there,"" she said firmly, looking at Tatty who nodded at her. 

Tatty was a quiet one, he didn't much like the idea of going to live with a group of anyone, no matter what Ryan thought of them, but he wanted to be with his family and the way Flower seemed beside herself with excitement, and he knew Anna missed Ryan, she wanted to see him more than anything in the world, and for that Tatty would suffer through what he thought of as horrific dreams coming to fruition. Besides, Tatty was tired of sleeping on the floor on a rolled out bedpad, he liked the Eco's ok, but he wanted more thread, he wanted to see Ryan, and he wanted a bed to sleep in. ""Yes Macy, we're family,"" he finally said, quietly. 

Macy frowned, if even Tatty was going to talk and be supportive of the decision, he really had no choice other than to go live on his own, and he didn't want to do that ever again. ""Whatever, it doesn't matter, at least I'll be in the City again,"" he grumbled, throwing his hand up in a gesture of a vote before flinging himself back into his bed again. 

Flower flew up onto her feet and attack hugged Kerry, ""Yaaaaaaaaaaah when do we go see Daddy? When can we leave,"" she asked, not pausing too long before she was happily attacking Anna and Willow with hugs and giggles, talking about the first things she wanted to do when she got there, talking about makeup for Anna and new clothes and maybe even toys, and books for Willow. It was as if 6 kids were planning a trip to the candy store, only 3 of the kids hated candy but wanted to go anyway. 

Kerry nodded his head slowly, ""Then it is decided, I shall inform the Eco's,"" he said solemnly, closing his eyes. Soon enough they'd be a complete family again, but also they'd be a part of a Tribe, bigger than they'd ever known, and Flower would have her Mommy, and hopefully everyone would be happy."

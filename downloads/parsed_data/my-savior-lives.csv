"event","<P>This weekend has been pretty crazzzy. Friday I was <STRONG>supposed</STRONG> to go to Robert's game at Leto. That didn't work out. He ended up coming over and staying til about 4:30am.</P>
<P>Saturday I worked. Then Robert came over and he and I followed Dad, Janet and Dex in the Explorer to Outback in Pasco. We met up with Theresea, her son Steven, and 3 other troopers to celebrate Theresea's birthday. It was pretty fun. Haha, they didn't have a table big enough for all of us, so Dex, Steven, Robert and I had to sit at the table next to them. It was Thanksgiving as a kid all over again!! :p Robert and I left a little bit before everyone else did. We picked JR up and then we all went to some party one of the TC fball players was having. After a while we headed over to Robert's new house cuz JR hadn't seen it yet. We had a blast there. Haha, JR is <STRONG>definetly</STRONG> in denial! :p *sighs* Poor JR. Then we hung out at my house for a while. The rule is they have to be out by midnight. When the clock struck 12 guess what that meant.... <STRONG>Happy Six Month</STRONG> <STRONG>Anniversary!!!!!</STRONG> :D</P>
<P>Today I worked again. Then I came home, got ready and Robert came over. He brought me&nbsp;red roses&nbsp;and a pretty bracelet. I got him 2 shirts from *cough Aeropostale cough*. Yuck. lol. Haha, he modeled them for me and Janet... Yeah, they didn't have any XL and one only had medium.. so of course he haaaaaad to try the medium on first... Let's just say it was a 'little' fitting. Heh. The large was a little better but anyway.... we went out to Cracker Barrell then stopped at WalMart. He had to be home by 8 so we didn't really have time to do much. Atleast I got to see him though. We've been together 6 months now. I love him with all my heart. I don't know what I'd do without him. Happy Anniversary sweetie! I love you!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Oh yeah, I talked to Catrina today. She might come down for Spring Break!!! *giddy* :D</P>"

"event","I have no idea why, but I feel really cruddy right now. I hate crying. I hate remembering the past. I hate missing people. I hate regreting decisions. I hate wanting to be one of them. I hate being decieving. I hate holding things in. I hate being scared. Just looking at myself in the mirror I cry sometimes. Ugh, whatever. I guess I sound kinda emo. Don't mind me. :x"

<P>Okay so here's what happened basically. First, flat tire on our way to school, need I remind you I had 3 passengers. So dad picked us up and took us to school. We were late, but no tardy, hooray! Mrs. Palma was absent so no hard work or spanish speakin teacher. :p Mrs. Crump measured all the B2R girls which was 'interesting' to say the least. LoL. I got my lunch fast which is <STRONG>ALWAYS</STRONG> a plus! :D Pretty much, all classes were shorter b/c pep rally. Which was AMAZING! Juniors won the spirit stick AGAIN! And I <STRONG>LITERALLY</STRONG> cried when the band played The Phantom Of The Opera. I was laughing, crying, and smiling all at the same time. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!!! So yeah, I'm buying a band shirt due to the fact that it has POTO logo on it! 0:) Okay, so I got home and... guess what!!! No, you're wrong. <FONT size=4><STRONG>I GOT A NEW CAR!!!!!! :D </STRONG></FONT><FONT size=3>I mean, 'technically', it's not <EM>my</EM> car, but <EM>I'm</EM> the one driving it so, whatever! It works for me! LoL. I'll have to post pics sometime. :D It's a BRAND NEW white explorer '05. OOH! Here's the best part= <STRONG>CLOTH SEATS!!! THAT MEANS NO LEATHER!! HOORAY! :) </STRONG>So yeah, I'm VERY happy. Then Rachel decided to come over and she ended up driving me to FUSION. OMGsh, I almost forgot how amazing it was! I missed it SOOOOO much! There are SOOO many more people that go there now. It's crazy! I saw a bunch of people I know.&nbsp; Like Sam, N8, Shawna, Renee, Molly, Brian, Alayna, Alex... and like EVERYONE! :p</FONT></P>
<P>Well, it's hard to type and talk on the phone at the same time so... chat later!!!</P>
<P>P.S. I really do love <STRONG>ALL</STRONG> my friends!!!!! I'm sorry if I don't say it or show it enough. :\</P>"

"event","<P>So this weekend.....</P>
<P>Friday- Dad and I went to Robert's preseason game @ Robinson. The score was 7-0 in Robinson's favor up til 2nd quarter. Then TC had the ball at the 15 yd line.... then the ST00PID refs call the game because of lightning... I don't even think it was worth calling off for. But whatever. TC SO would've won if they'd kept playing.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Saturday- I worked and got to help <STRONG>HOST</STRONG> for a while! Woo!!! Then I got home and There were like 4 or 5 troopers there. Dad was having a little party for him and some old buddies on his squad. Robert came over too. He helped me with my AH homework online. Yeah, I think I'm pretty much screwed in that class right now. :x Then we went to Q-Zar which was pretty fun. Then we stopped by Payless for my chorus service project. (Yeah, I think I'm running for VP- VOTE FOR ME! :) ...Please.) After that we went to CVS to pick up some stuff then right next door to Pizza Hut. I swear, the lady took forever to get our order right. :p Then we came back to my house and hung out til Robert had to go home.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sunday- Work was SO exhausting. Not that I was running back and forth bussing tables but I was on my feet for 6 straight hours and bored rolling silverware/filling pitchers/cleaning and organizing the alter/assisting the servers. I'm not complaining though. And the coolest coincidence happened. Dad, Janet and Uncle Joe came in basically the same time Aunt Karen, Thumper, and Molly did. They sat across from each other and I visited with both of them. Aunt Karen n them left right before I went on break though. So I sat with Dad n them. The last customers <STRONG>left</STRONG> at 3:15pm and we <STRONG>close</STRONG> at 2:30pm. The only reason they left was b/c Margaret had to ask them to. :\ So we didn't finish up til 4:30pm. Ugh. What a long day. Then I came home, rested a bit and did all my homework.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Tomorrow's the parent conference night for junior ring assembly. And I have singing lessons. I really need to buckle down with school and homework.. and classwork for that matter&nbsp;this year. Especially with this online class now. BTW: Does anyone know anything about the track team?? Did they already do that or has track not started yet??</P>"

I'm screwed. I went to open house last night. It was alright. I saw a bunch of people that I haven't seen since... well, LAST YEAR! :p Hehe. Afterwards, Sara and I went to Maggie Moo's. We met up with Rachel, Corbin, and Andrew. Nate was there, too. Which reminds me: FUSION starts back up 08-19-05! Unfortunately I won't be able to make it cuz I promised Robert I'd go to his first game. They just <STRONG>happen</STRONG> to be on the same day! :( *sighs* oh well. My schedule is still screwed up. I have to call Mr. Court tomorrow about it. Anyway, here's my schedule for now!:</P>
<P>Pd.1 - Debate I w/ Ms. Holden</P>
<P>Pd.2 - Amer Hist Hnrs w/ Ms. Ewell *soon to be Spanish II w/ ???</P>
<P>Pd.3 - Vocal Tech I w/ Mrs. Crump (B2R)</P>

I found that out later. I was crying on the phone when I called him. So I have a spare on right now. He's gunna get me a new one tomorrow though.
Then Daddy took me shopping at Dillards for the tax-free thing. I got one pair of jeans, A PAIR OF CAPRIS!!!(I know, it's a first :p) 4 tops and a peasant skirt.
I started AHH online today... I'm so scared that I won't be able to keep up with it. :\

"event","Monday I did absolutely nothing. Then around 9pm I decided I wanted popcorn. So I go into the pantry and there was none left! Turns out daddy had the last bag night before. Grrr. So I was VERY sad and confronted dad about. Then I went back into my room and did ABSOLUTELY nothing (again). Not too much later daddy came in, gave me $20 and told me to go get my popcorn and razors just so longs as I brought back the change. I was so giddy because man, I was CRAVING some popcorn! :p
<lj-cut text=""C'mon, ya know you wunna know the rest. o_o"">
While I was walking back to my car, this disgruntled looking man starts a small conversation with me in an English accent. I said hello and asked him how he was. He said something along the lines of being hungry and if I could spare him some loose change. So I did. I reached into the grocery bag and handed him a dollar. He said thank you (of course) and went along his way. I told him to have a wonderful night and take care of himself. I felt SO good about myself. I just love helping people out like that. My dad would have been furious though. I know that for a fact, if he knew I helped the man that is. But don't worry, I took a dollar out of my wallet and added it to dad's change. I just didn't feel like getting to my wallet at the moment is all. Anyway, I thought that was very sweet of dad to let me go late at night just for a craving and I was more than glad to help the man out. :)
<lj-cut/>
Today dad and Janet took me ""Back To School Shopping"". According to daddy, this is defined as undergarments, holeless socks, and 2 skirts. Janet said that it was plenty because I most certainly don't need to wear a shirt to school. *Daddy didn't find it as funny as I did though! :p* Oh well. I guess it was the thought that counts, right? Oh yeah, I also got 3 pairs of shoes. Together they only cost $15.. tax-free! :D Then Rachel and I went to the chorus booster club meeting. It was alright. Nothing to exciting. What I thought was so great was seeing Crump, Mrs. Morris, Big T, Mrs, Hayman.. n all of em. We 'kinda' introduced ourselves to a couple of the new students. I just thought it was cool to see them all again. Haha, what was hilarious though was that as I was driving there down Commerce I realized ""Wow, I have not been down here since the last day of school"". And we ALL know what happened then, right?!?! :x . . . 0:)
Tomorrow, er today, I'm supposed to help Sara move. But first we're gunna go see Mr. Court about schedule changes. I MIGHT be going to my step-dad's Thursday and Friday I have work and MIGHT be babysitting Bridget's baby. (Robert's step-aunt's boy) I know... me and a baby?! Ha! :x Heh, just kidding.
Oh yeah, n Dexter's in Sanibel(sp?) for an ENTIRE week with his friend n his mom! He left Monday morning. :( Now who am I gunna bug?!?! Argh. Ooh, and I read my first short story today.. wow! that was absolutely HORRIBLE!!!!!!!! I'm so NOT looking forward to writing about them all. :\"

Chris (my cousin's husband) took me on a go kart last night in the dark! It was awesome! Minus the bugs that kept flying into my face! Haha. Today I went back to work after 2 weeks. Ugh. That wasn't very fun. But my Aunt, Uncle, 2 cousins, Chris, their son Michael, and Dexter alllllll came to see me at First Watch. That was sweet of 'em. :) I made $22 in tip=outs today though. Hooray! :D</P>

"event","<P>Well, I've been home from Chicagofor about half a week now. I just haven't really had time to update.. <STRONG>that </STRONG>and I just didn't feel like it. :p Anyway, my trip was pretty fun. I visited ALOT of family which was... eh. I came to realize that my Grandma talks an <STRONG>aweful lot</STRONG>! -_- I got to spend over $100 in The Water Tower. <STRONG>PLUS</STRONG> I found out something SOOOO awesome from my Uncle Don about dinosaurs and how they fit into the Bible!!! It's kinda a long story so if you care enough, call me! ;) I got to drive the entire time I was up there because my grandma doesn't like driving plus she's not even allowed to drive in the dark. :\ Grandma had to pick something up at the mall so we also went into FYE and they had movies for as low as $1.99! I got The Queen Of The Damned for $4.99 and grandma got me another movie for the same price. Guess what it was!!!! A different version of The Phantom of the Opera!!!! :D It's in 1943 but not a music and it's only 93 minutes long. It was pretty interesting though. NOTHING compared to my Phantom though! 0:) Anyway, yeah... I had a great time up there. I really miss my grandma now. She's so easy going about things. She doesn't get upset about <STRONG>anything!</STRONG> Man, I wish I could do that! Hehe.</P>
<P>Oh, then our flight into Tampa got delayed TWICE! We also had to switch gates 3 times! It was horrible. We were schedule to arrive in Tampa 10 to 10pm. We didn't end up getting there til about 15 after midnight! Ugh.</P>
<P>So Sunday I spent the day unpacking, doing laundry, cleaning/organizing my room some, and doing my stupid summer reading. I'm starting with SlaughterHouse5. That books is <STRONG>so</STRONG> bizare(sp?). Monday I saw Fantastic 4 with Robert. I missed him SOOOO much!!! :D We've been going out for over 4 months now. Since the 11th. But I was in Chicago that day so that really sucked. :( But the movie was pretty good. Man, oh man. That Von Doom guy is <STRONG>SoOoOoOo</STRONG> flippin' hot!! Not NEARLY as hot as Gerry OR Robert though! ;p He played in Nip/Tuck... the cute doctor. Tehehe. Well, yesterday I did absolutely <STRONG>nothing</STRONG>! And I don't even know why! :\ Oh well. Today I went out with Sara. She's got her license now! Woohoo. I'm pretty sure all our friends do now. But still, it's cool. :p We went to DSW, Ross, Staples, some other store, Salvation Army, then I got some fries and a FREE small coke at Burger King! Haha. That was so funny. Sara is my partner in crime! :p Then we went back to my place and hung out for a bit. ***Ooh! we tried going to Chuck E Cheese to get some pizza but they wouldn't let us in because we were under 18 without a parent!!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?! Ugh.</P>
<P>Well, I'm going to church tonight. Their finally starting Wed nights back up again. Hooray! I kinda missed it. Well, turns out tomorrow I'm going to BG with my family. Dad and I wunna go on Shrieka(sp????) <STRONG>SO</STRONG> badly! Haha, I bet I spelled that COMPLETELY wrong! :p I'm gunna ask Robert tonight if he wants to come. And I guess I never told my dad about Mary and I possibly hanging out tomorrow so I figured I'll invite her along too! I haven't seen her in forever!!!! I miss ya Mary! :) Let's see, Friday I'm helping Sara move. It'll be like a cool work out for me! :D Then I start work again on Saturday... ugh. SOOO not looking forward to that OR school again. This sucks! Heh.</P>"

"event","Well, I had my recital today. It went very well. I LOVE the song that I sang. I can honestly say that this was the very first time that I've EVER gotten up on stage without a trace of me being nervous!! It was awesome! I guess it helps that I am absolutely in love with the song. It's called ""Why"" by Nichole Nordeman, a contemporary Christian singer. I'm telling ya, the words are SOOO powerful and they always get to me. Apparently there were some people in the audience even about to cry. :p Dad, Dexter, Janet, Robert, Nora (Janet's friend), and Aunt Darlene came. Dad suprised me with Aunt Dar-Dar. I had no idea she was coming but I'm SOOO glad she did! I haven't seen her since... well, let's just say it's been quite a while. Now, for the record, she's not ACTUALLY my aunt. She and my Mom were best friends and I've known her since I was just a baby. She practically was an aunt to me. I love her so much. She's so sweet.
OOH! BTW: There were these 2 girls who sang 2 different songs from The Phantom of the Opera right after each other!!! It was awesome!!! I swear, I had the HUGEST smile on my face!
Afterwards, Robert and I decided to go see Fantastic Four. But they were sold out so instead we headed over to Steak N Shake for some fries and shakes. Then we went to the mall. Haha, Spencer's has some pretty 'interesting' items to say the least! :p I bought some more stuff at Old Navy. But I didn't even realize until I got home that they had over-charged me for one of the purses. That made me so upset but what makes it worse is that I can't even do anything about it until I get back next week. Ugh. Haha, another thing was, in the car, Robert was trying to explain to me this one song. Something like ""In the middle of our street"". Haha, I feel SOOOO sorry for him. He actually looked frustrated trying to explain to me what the song meant. (But if ya ask me, he's just bad at explaining stuff.) ;) I told him that he's dating the next Jessica Simpson minus the big boobs and blonde hair. :p
Over all, today went great. And actually I have to get up in a few hours to leave for the airport for Chicago to see my grandma. My flight is at 7am and I get back around 10pm Saturday. But I'll have my cell with so if ya wunna talk, call after 9 because I get 100 free roaming minutes and I have text messaging. PLEASE call/text!!!! I'll be SOOO bored late at night because my Grandma goes to sleep early and I don't wunna do my summer reading!!! :p
Wow, this was a REALLY long post. Was NOT expecting it to be. Heh. Well, I'll miss ya'll! You better miss me too!!! :p Oh, and I love you, Robert!!!!! ""You have my undying love."" :) *sorry, just had to throw that in there. :p Talk to ya'll later!!"

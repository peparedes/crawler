I work at a company that sells sweaters and knits. We've been doing a booming Christmas sweater business for the last few years. This year we have ones that make music/sing when you press them. To avoid copyright issues we use songs that are in the public domain which are most popular/common Christmas songs. Then a bunch of us get together in a closed office and record a stanza or 2 on someone's iphone. This is then mixed/whatever and the soundbyte sent to the factory. Those who participate, wether you sang or just shook some jingle bells has to sign a release form for the use of your recorded voice etc."

"event","So I was reading a fic the other day. One of the little background threads running through it was that since the main couple were expecting a baby, one of the parents was constantly suggesting DC/Marvel etc names for the baby which were shot down by the other main character because that character did not want a fandom name for the baby. However the character who kept suggesting names was actually gunning for a whedonverse name for the baby which he totally got because the other character did not realize that Alexander and the cute Xander nickname was from anything.

SO, if you had the chance and the desire to name your precious offspring after someone in fandom what/who would you pick?"

Anyway when they got to the store there were a small group of people and a store clerk outside.Apparently there were so many people inside that they would be let in when people left the store. Angelica said there was no bread/rolls left. Stacy said it was like the zombie apocalypse was coming. A friend of hers had texted her earlier that there were tons of people at the same store when they went. 

We were up at the crack of dawn this morning because Stacy had an audition for Angelica's high school at 8 and we were advised to get there early. We met up with 2 of her friends from dance class and saw another 2 from the studio, one who was trying out for vocal. 

The audition went well. She and her friends got called to interviews after the dance class which is a good sign. One audition down, about 3-4 more to go.

Mass transit is being shut down here starting at 7 tonight. No class for both kids tomorrow and obviously no work because I wouldn't be able to get there.

Stacy has nationals tomorrow. Basically just one number and the dance teacher had sent out numerous emails in June as to who could go etc.  My response had always been we'll be there as long as we have a ride there. Now the Friday before July 4th she let me know about one mom who had said she had room. The person I usually go with can't make it but another mother will take her kid. So I'm told to text the mother who had offered but she doesn't have a phone so we text her daughter's phone. Apparently that's how to contact her, fine, whatever. I text that Friday night. On Saturday I ask Stacy to text the daughter again. By Sunday I text another mother who is friends with her and am informed that she takes her time to answer but she'll get back to me. Monday I text the teacher and get the same response, she takes a while but she'll get back to me. Note I only texted her that Friday then Stacy followed up a few times the next day, so it's not like I was constantly texting her. By  Saturday I email the teacher that I haven't heard back from this lady. Monday, as in yesterday, I find out this lady has car trouble and will be riding with someone else as well. I find this out from Stacy who found out when she went to practice. This lady NEVER got back to me. I still am not sure who we're riding with tomorrow AND I'll be seeing this lady in about half an hour when I pick up Stacy and find out who we're riding with. I am about ready to throttle her but what with the politics of the dance studio I don't want any fallout, which is why I don't really stay at the studio much. I mean she's nice enough but i am never going to rely on her for anything EVER because really you can't even text me that you have car trouble? I would have had a week to look for another ride!

This amendment would grant fertilized eggs and fetuses personhood status.<br /><br />Putting aside the contentious issue of abortion, this would effectively outlaw birth control and criminalize women who have miscarriages. This is not a good thing.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.jacksonwomenshealth.com/"">Jackson Women&#39;s Health Organization</a> is the only place women can get abortions in the <i>entire</i> state, and they are trying to launch a grassroots movement against this amendment. This doesn&#39;t just apply to Mississippi, though, as Personhood USA, the group that introduced this amendment, is trying to introduce identical amendments in <i>all 50 states</i>.<br /><br />What&#39;s more, in Mississippi, this amendment is expected to pass. It even has Mississippi Democrats, including the Attorney General, Jim Hood, backing it.<br /><br />The reason I&#39;m posting this here is because I made a meager donation to the Jackson Women&#39;s Health Organization this morning, and I received a personal email back hours later - on a Sunday - thanking me and noting that I&#39;m one of the first &quot;outside&quot; people to contribute.<br /><br />So if you sometimes pass on political action because you figure that enough other people will do something to make a difference, make an exception on this one. My RSS reader is near silent on this amendment. I only found out about it through a feminist blog. The mainstream media is not reporting on it.<br /><br />If there is ever a time to donate or send a letter in protest, this would be it.<br /><br />What to do?<br /><br />- Read up on it. <a href=""http://www.wakeupmississippi.org/"">Wake Up, Mississippi</a> is the home of the grassroots effort to fight this amendment. <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/10/07/1023558/-Occupy-My-Uterus-My-Ass!-Fertilized-Eggs-Are-NOT-People!"">Daily Kos</a> also has a thorough story on it.<br /><br />- If you can afford it, you can donate at the site&#39;s link.<br /><br />- You can <a href=""http://www.democrats.org/contact"">contact the Democratic National Committee</a> to see why more of our representatives aren&#39;t speaking out against this.<br /><br />- Like <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/WakeUpMississippiorg/237684486281516"">this Facebook page</a> to help spread awareness.<br /><br /><br /><lj-repost button=""And you can always push this button to repost on your LJ and spread the word"" /></div>"

I haven&#39;t gone out so not sure what trees in the neighborhood went down. I&#39;m just glad the big tree in my neighbor&#39;s yard (it&#39;s right next to the fence at the back of our yard is ok and no branches came down (which would have taken down all the telephone/etc wires). Also glad that the tree in front of my next door nghbor&#39;s house just shed a lot of leaves but otherwise is fine. We didn&#39;t lose power thankfully.

Make sure it&rsquo;s easy  to store/hide as well&hellip; It&rsquo;s awesome that you made a 2ft tall lion head  for you to wear as Luna, but you NEED to remember that when you go into  the cinema, you&rsquo;ll need to take it off and store it somewhere so people  can see past your head.</small></li><li><small><strong>A WAND</strong><br />Oh come on, it&rsquo;s self-explanatory.</small></li><li><small><strong>TISSUE BOX<br /></strong>Don&rsquo;t even lie. You will need  it. Don&rsquo;t skimp on it and get a cheapo tissue box either. Get one with  the highest number of plys. And if you&rsquo;re planning to share it with  other people (though I&rsquo;m pretty sure most of us will need a box per  person), get one that isn&rsquo;t scented - you never know if they&rsquo;re allergic  or not!</small></li><li><small><strong>WATER<br /></strong>You&rsquo;ll be crying a lot - therefore, you&rsquo;ll need to be well hydrated.</small></li><li><small><strong>FOOD<br /></strong>If you get food at the cinema,  that&rsquo;s fine. But if it&rsquo;s anything like Australian cinema, be prepared to  pay something like $15 just for a bucket of popcorn. Make sandwiches,  bring fruits and nuts - less sugar means the less you&rsquo;ll crash half way  through the movie.</small></li><li><small><strong>YOUR CAFFEINE OF CHOICE<br /></strong>Whether it&rsquo;s  coffee, coke or red bull. Don&rsquo;t drink too much of it - as caffeine is a  diuretic. Which means, it makes you urinate more than usual. You don&rsquo;t  want to get up while Neville is killing Nagini on screen and annoy  everyone else as you go pass them so you can go pee.</small></li><li><small><strong>MONEY</strong><br />Some cinemas sell merchandise. Also, why did you leave your house without at least a few dollars in your pocket?&nbsp;</small></li><li><small><strong>YOUR TICKET</strong><br />Laugh all you want, I&rsquo;ve seen people that has left their tickets at home before!</small></li></ol><p><small><strong>THINGS YOU MAY BRING</strong></small></p> <ol><li><small><strong>DEATHLY HALLOWS BOOK<br /></strong>If you&rsquo;re waiting in line for hours at a time, you may want to bring the Deathly Hallows book to refresh your memory.</small></li><li><small><strong>PILLOW<br /></strong>Sitting on hard ground while waiting sucks. Also you can take nanna naps.&nbsp;</small></li></ol><p><small><strong>THINGS YOU CAN LEAVE AT HOME</strong></small></p> <ol><li><small><strong>EYE MAKE UP<br /></strong>Unless you want to leave the theatre looking like a panda, I suggest you don&rsquo;t put any on.&nbsp;</small></li></ol><p><small><strong>AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, MAKE NEW FRIENDS AND JUST HAVE FUN!</strong></small></p> </blockquote><br /><br />I'm not going to the midnight screening because what with all the crying I expect to be doing I will be in no way able to go to work the next day, even if i come in at 10AM.

"event","I am soooo upset. Remember my fridge is supposed to be delivered today? Guess what? No fridge for me. I got a call last night confirming delivery this morning, so far, so good. Delivery time passes so I call. Turns out that due to sloppy paperwork on the salesperson side the fridge did not get on the truck this morning. If I hadn't called, I would be what, waiting all day for nothing? I was furious. I had to reschedule for something that was not my fault. IDGAF argggh I am usually very easy going but when I do go off my family knows to take cover. The reschedule for tomorrow would not have bothered me but I have a lot to do tomorrow. I'd promised Stacy dimsum for a while now and we're doing it tomorrow. My niece is having a birthday party which we'll be at for 2 hours max coz we have to get to the museum Stacy took classes at to catch at least an hour of their reception. The kids artwork will be displayed in the education center.

I guess I was so upset on the phone that the manager is giving me back almost half of the fridge price since the whole thing is due to incompetance on their part. So I am scheduled for first delivery (9am) tomorrow.

Part of me feels horrible at getting upset on the phone like that, and that salesperson had been so helpful and nice and now he's probably going to be reprimanded for this.     ._.

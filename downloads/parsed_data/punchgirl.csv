"event","every night gets better and better. i'm hella grounded on my friday night off and it was the funnest friday ever.

we smoked a blunt before school. came home did crosswords and ate a feast. talked to everyone on the phone except patty (your away message didn't sound like it was a good time my darling) even torii's mom. and nathan. and i told nathan every gay thing me and torii ever did. bryan and sean came over because i was here alone bored. we acted gay then smoked 2 bowls and did once again a cracker challenge and witnessed my sister scream for her own personal enjoyment while playing rap videos repeatedly on tv. reid came over and we talked and watched old school and hung out. he left and i hung out with tatro and rudy and danny and like 3 others. it was the best night. if i didn't call someone back tonight or something, im sorry. it was eventful.

torii i want chicken back."

"event","so yes.........despite how bad everything has been sounding, i think things are starting to turn around. finally....and for some reason i'm not really that grounded, and it hasn't even been a week.

i'm over everything that happened, i have been, and i dont intend to look back either. I'm actually having feelings for people I never did before. it's really nice.

I want someone to have of my own. but i also wouldn't mind being single for awhile longer either. so it's good either way.

everything happens for a reason........that is probably the most true thing i've heard in my life. its sick. because its so true. wow. 


greg is probably going to jail. that's so weird. i just fucking hung out with him last weekend and we were bonding and yesterday me and him and andrew were talking and being stupid together, and it's weird just sitting here realizing i won't see him for a long time or talk to him. i'll miss him.

don't become a drug dealer.

"event","he met her in may. it was the time we fought about the text messages. and he cried hard. like usual. and lied. but yes they weren't from aaron, they were indeed from this girl in may. they planned to fuck but she had to move to hawaii and she did, so he was nice to me all summer. then when he called me when i was on vacation, he called just to tell me he met a girl and took her on a date. well that translates to Mary is moving back to vegas, yay. the day after we decided to take our little break, he invites aaron over. eh says ""we can date whoever we want. i can fuck all the girls i want."" and he invited her over, where ryan and mary were locked in his room messing around for hours and aaron was in theo ther room. every friend ryan had, even aaron talked shit aobut him. aaron didn't feel comfortable with her there because me and him were friends. 

the feature presentation: ryan has been tweaking this summer also. and hes done coke the entire summer. and he smokes cigarettes. because he always does coke. ""he's way into it. he is so up for it he hella loves it""

wow, i sure picked a fucking winner. i'm so happy. he sped out of the parking lot today and i dind't get to confront him. when i see him i'm breaking his glasses and punching him in the face, spitting in his face, but thats after i scream at him and make him feel like i did. which is impossible.


hes a psycho who lies and  cries a lot (YES FUCK I SWEAR HE CRIES ALL THE TIEM) and hes a big fucking pussy. i hate him so fucking much. and i don't have to pretend. i'm smash into his car if it was in front of me. fuck him, maybe karmas real. i hope so.

i wasted my first love. he made me love him and he fooled fucking everybody. and i fell so hard and i fell in love. fuck that. now its all a blur. i have yet to experience a real love between me and another person. but fuck i don't care as long as i never go through this again.

edit: all his friends sold him out.

when he was ""busy"", she was sucking his dick. the night after, he was telling his friends to leave him alone, he was about to get laid. he smoked behind my back all the fucking time and i never knew. he told one of my close friends (we werne't close back then) ""hurry up and buy this sack, i'm about to go fuck chelsey"". dude. i'm so glad i'm finding out everything. i hope he gets the shit beat out of him. all his best friends think hes a fucking cocksucker, and they told me everything. which he is a cocksucker, and apparently so is this new whore. i don't care, they are whores. i am not a whore and i'm certainly not gonna get played by this sick ass fucking asshole. i didn't know it was called ""fucking"" chelsey. i let him take everything i had, and it hurt like hell. and for what? the day he got his dick sucked he had been telling me how much he loved me. haha. wow. well we're still friends. and one day when i get him alone i'm goign to tell him everything i know. what a pussy. hahaa. oh man. guys are a trip."

"event","as if anything could fuck it up anymore. last night i decided to go into his emails. immature but i hate him anyway so wahtever. he lied about everything hes ever told me. he does want to fall in love with her. he asked her to be with him. he lied about loving me and wanting to be with me in 2 years. he can go to hell for all i care. he cussed at me because i thought he wasn't telling the truth. their emails back and forth, it makes me sick. the whole time we went out, everything was lies. he said he never cheated on me, i'm sure he has. when we first broke up, i was the one who ""had a boyfriend"" and that drove him to not want to be with me. HE HAD A FUCKING GIRLFRIEND AT THE SAME TIME. hes the sickest person and hes fucking psycho. hes lying his face off to her and to me. he said it wasn't serious when he told her he WANTED HER TO BE WITH HIM and he wanted a serious relationship. dude i didn't even cry when i read it. i hate him so much. i told him i was not in love with him because i didn't know him. i still dont' know him. i'm glad i went into his emails. he wrote how much me loved me and wanted to marry me. he wrote it to me while he was telling her all this good phenomenol ""i care about you so much mary"".......hahah......oh my god i can't believe iw asted any time on him. i don't love him, i never will, and now i realize i never have. i loved the person i met and i loved the things he told me. but they weren't true. i loved the things i thought were the truth, but nothing was ever true. the whole year and half was lie after lie. and i never knew. but i do now and i'm ready to never see his face again. this is worse than my manager, worse than what he could ever do. worse than anything. my trust is gone. but at least it made me a hell of a lot smarter. he wrote me this email 2 days ago, while writing her emails saying how much he cares for her and wants to have something great with her. he told me when he thought of getting married he thought of me and having kids with me.


wow i couldn't have been more stupid and blind. i have never experienced love. i've experienced hate and cold untruths. i hope something comes back to haunt him in the end. i hope karma is fucking real. i hope i find someone that does love me, because he never did. he lied about everything he ever said to me. and when i found out, i said i never wanted to talk to him again. and he screamed at me and told me to never call him or talk to him again. hahaha. what did i do wrong. nothing. something else is very wrong. he is sick. truely purely fucking sick. 

its okay. at least i know and have a taste of the worst it will ever get. no other boy could treat me worse, so theres always a bright side. i will never have to deal with him or his lies again. god. that feels so good to say. ryan schomig needs to disappear for the good of the world. he's no better than a murderer.

i told him no more talking. i can't take it. every picture of him is down, everything he's left here, the shirts he's given me to wear because i loved them so much, anything that reminds me of him........out of my sight. he's getting all his stuff back. i can't stand to look at it. i must have broke down 5 times today. and i'm still breaking. the one time i realize i do need ryan, he tells me he's over me and i'm just going to have to get over it, becasue he felt like this too but he got over it and moved on. that means i have to move on. and hurt more. then he thinks we can get back together when he's ready? fuck that. he's hurting me so much and all i want to do is forget i ever met him. i just want to wake up and not remember anything. i dont' want to wake up at 2:45 am, look around, and then recall what happened last night. then cry for 2 more hours. then go to school and wonder what the fuck i'm here for. he tries to talk to me because he feels sorry for me. and i avoid him and go in the girls bathroom and fix my make up because my eyes are watering. everyday is turning into hell because i can't stand to see him. it is fucking killing me. but its okay right, because i will just ""get over it"". i'm not waiting for him. he loves me so much, so much to hurt me worse than i hurt him. he screamed at me because i hurt him, then he put me through it and then says he loves me? well i'm done, done with him and hey, maybe i'll get lucky and not remember anything tomorrow morning. i hope. just make him disappear please.

julian is the best thing that i've come across in a long time. if you're a friend of julians, you should hella know what i'm talking about. it's so fucking hard to find someone that is willing to help out a friend.


and like i said tonight....i don't want attention. i don't want inspiring comments. i don't want to have to call my friends in order for us to talk. i've separated from what used to be my closest friends. but they don't understand. i tried so hard to stay close with them. i hung out with these people because i love being around them. before you think about talking to me again, just remember i have called you. i've said hello to you. i left a message wondering if you were okay. god. i can't believe this. i'm not even talking about one person. it's more than just a few people. i'm not going to feel like i am not good enough to be someones friend. everything thats happened i'm taking to heart. i have so much to say and no one to say it to because i can't think of one person who even wants to hear it. i dont' even want to hear my petty little sad shit bullshit. i did it to myself and i fucked myself, and no one is responsible to help me, but myself.

all these sound the same. but i know my friends read this, and i know i'm never going to talk to them again anyway. i feel like the biggest douche. but i have no options left. i don't care anymore. one day i'll fix myself up. its just another case of teenage drama. except i know what i need and what i don't. and i know when i'm not wanted. i just am learning to figure out life. and i'm okay, to anyone who actually read any of this. i would be really surprised if anyone did.

i've learned a few things:

-me and ryan are NOT planning on getting back together. i told him and its final. he needed to know how i felt.

-it IS possible to get so high you pass out. and it IS possible to get woken up after you pass out, and smoke 2 more bowls. however i can't promise a full recovery.

-i am going to have fun this year. i'm not looking at the bad things anymore. its my year and im gonna make the best of vegas

-my brother is one of the greatest people i've ever hung out with. this time instead of hanging around the house together, we partied. and he said he liked hanging out with me. he is fucking the greatest.

"event","Ah. Something happened at work which I don't want to write in here because it is something so big it just shouldn't be posted all over the internet. But it is something that will change the rest of my time working at office max. whatever.

I know what it feels like to be scared to death. I was shaking from how scared I was. I hid from him. I avoided him. Everytime I heard a key jingle I panicked because he always has keys in his pockets. I could hear him laughing on the other side of the fucking store. I didn't walk anywhere but out in the open when I was by myself. I followed people if I had to go to the back. Then Mike came in to get his check and talk to me and I felt some sense of security. My hands were still shaking so much and I lost all my composure when I told him what happened. Tears welled up in my eyes not because I was sad, but because of how fucking scared I was. I was only there for an hour when he was. But fuck, I swear to god I've never felt like that in my life. And then all of the sudden, I wasn't that scared anymore. As I was leaving he tried to say hi to me and i ignored him. He tried again and again, I kept walking. Finally I just turned around and said hi and turned back around and kept walking with Mike. We walked to the back, then to my car and told me he would help me with whatever I needed. All I can say is I love Mike with all of my heart and he is truely one of the best friends I have. And as for one of my managers (one in particular) die you mother fucking sick asshole mother fucker.

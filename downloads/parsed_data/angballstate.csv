"event","okay so last night was matt's 22nd birthday... so we drank some at his house & then went out.... we had a pretty good time like always... i got home around 2:00 AM and passed out.... this morning i woke up to go to class... and when i got closer to my car i realized that someone had hit my car! i am so pissed i had to call the cops and get a police report made... this sucks... my car is brand new and some punk ass bitch fucked it up.... grrr.... so anyways i missed class and now i am in a cleaning mode... 

tonight a bunch of us are going to barley island to see michael & zach's band play... it should be fun....

tomorrow night i am hanging out with tom.... we are going to get his halloween costume...

friday i already had plans to go over to jake's for their big halloween party and i was just informed that bubbaweener is playing in lafayette that night... so hopefully i will be able to catch them play too! i am excited for everyone to see my costume... it's grrrrreat! i don't know if it will outdo last years though... 

saturday night i have to work & hopefully will make it over to tom's halloween party here at bsu.... just depends when i get off of work.......

"event","okay so it's been a little while since i've last updated... and i haven't really been busy.. just haven't felt like updating.... well it's friday & i just took a test... it's now officially fall break! so a weird thing happened to me yesterday while i was walking to class.... i saw something on the ground and as i got closer to it... i realized that it was a flyer with my ex boyfriend on it saying he is playing at bsu soon.... just then i look up and there's another one on the wall! they are everywhere! when i got home i got a phone call from valerie saying she just saw some flyers for him on campus.... it was really weird... but anyways so last friday night a bunch of my friends came to ball state to see bubbaweener play... so i hurried home from work so i could hang out with them.... it was a lot of fun... then saturday night i worked & went to purdue to hang out with my boys.... it was a pretty fun weekend... monday night i went out with tom for his 21st... it was a lot of fun... we sang karaoke... tonight i have to work & then i'm going to hurry back here to go out with everyone for tom's birthday.... tomorrow night i have to work & then i am going out with katrina, michaela, and katy for a girls night... i really hope i don't run into gary... katrina informed me yesterday that he is still in love with me & talks about me all the time to her... i think it would be much easier to deal with if he hated my guts.... i don't need any guys right now.... i just need to be single for a while... i really haven't been single for a long ass time.... i usually jump from guy to guy.... i'm going to stop looking for someone because usually you will find something when u least expect to. the south pole closes wednesday... so all you kids better go get some good food before they are closed & new owners take over! my last day there is saturday.... it's kinda sad.... i will try to update sometime soon... peace out kids!

"event","so yesterday linds & i went searching for a new place to live... it is just too scary living in this neighborhood... but i think we finally found a place! hopefully we can move in soon! 

last night i went home for jill's 21st birthday... it was so much fun! we went to quite a few different bars & ended up at bdubs.... that's where she works... all the people there are really nice... we ended up getting a lot of free drinks & got really trashed... jill puked outside of some strip club... puke & rally!

oh my gosh we have to get out of this neighborhood.... some kids from across the street were just on our porch and were yelling at each other & stuff... we are in the ghetto! greg had to go outside & shut them up! 

well i just got a phone call from an old fling... i guess he is coming to muncie friday night.... hopefully i will get out of work early enough to come hang out... 

so i found out that gary stayed the night with his ex last night.... that is so funny considering he was trying to tell me they were just ""friends"".... what an asshole... i'm so glad i have now realized how much better i can do..."

she drives away 
she's feeling worthless 
used again but nothing's different 
she'd stay the night 
but knows he doesn't care 

home by three 
deafening quiet 
the porch light's off 
yes they forgot it 
she'd cry herself to sleep 
but she don't dare 
and she wants to be a model 
she wants to hear she's beautiful 
she's beautiful"""

"event","well it's monday & i'm back at school.... let me just update you on my weekend... friday night i worked.... then went out to some bars with jeremiah, danny, braun, and kevin... it was pretty fun... i got pretty drunk & ended up passing out at some dude's house waitin on kevin to come get us... i woke up saturday morning with one hell of a hangover... then i caught an ex bf driving by my house in tipton... it was pretty funny.... so i talked to him for a little while & we exchanged new phone numbers.... it was really weird because i hadn't seen him a few years.... but it was nice to talk to him... so that night i went with jill to chado's.... we hung out and i saw ONE of the girls who jer cheated on me with.... not very impressed by her... it was really hard for me not to beat the shit out of her... but she's like 16 so i would have went to jail for that one... haha... i am amazed by all the slutty girls that end up over at chad & cody's.... it really grosses me out.... it makes me not want to go over there anymore... hopefully since their break is over they won't be around as much.... all we can do is hope.....

so sunday i worked & it was such a beautiful day out.... so we were busy as hell... right now i'm playin with Elli... she's gettin big! i have a ton of homework to do tonight & study for a test.... fun fun fun

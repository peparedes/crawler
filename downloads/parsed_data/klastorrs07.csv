"event","These past three weeks have been nothing short of amazing.&nbsp;
I've never smiled so much in 3 weeks ever.&nbsp; I kinda like it.
Hes wonderful.

Friends are pretty great too.&nbsp; They might be mostly guys but,&nbsp;
I dont think I would really want it any other way.
Some people don't really understand why I hang out with all of them,
and I don't expect them to.&nbsp; I love things the way they are right now.

I still miss Muskegon and friends&nbsp;I'd like to go back there soon,&nbsp;
really soon.

The 25th is coming faster then I had expected.&nbsp;
I can't wait till its all just over with and I can go back to&nbsp;
WORKING OUT! something i havent done in months

Life,&nbsp;
I love it.."

"event","this week has pretty much been nothing but mistakes for me
i can't go back and change anything&nbsp;
but if i could i would
i dont know how to tell someone how sorry i am
when i feel bad for what ive done or..
even embarressed for it&nbsp;
i want to hide and walk away even tho its prolly not good lol
when im mad or just hurt i cry..
it makes me feel like a little girl&nbsp;
but i dont know how else i can deal with it
when someone asks whats wrong or what happend etc.&nbsp;
i always choke up..i almost alway start crying and i try to hold back!&nbsp;
i try so effing hard not to just bawl my eyes out
when i know i made a mistake i get angry at that person sometimes
i dont know why i do...it always messes it up more..
i hate it when people dont accept my appoligy&nbsp;
it take so much out of me to even say it..
i have to think of how to say it so its meaningful&nbsp;
i know sometimes sorry doesnt cut it..but what do i do then?

i fee like everyone thinks im mean at lunch lol&nbsp;
i feel like ive become more...
forceful or maybe just not thinking twice before i do something
maybe what he said today i deserved
all i know is i was mostaly the fool&nbsp;
i made the mistake...
but i cant fix it but i would like to so bad
i would like to take back things i said
and maybe they dont care anymore
or forgot about it and that sucks
because i will sit here for weeks still remembering
and thinking how stupid i was..




sooo&nbsp;i guess&nbsp;i just think to much??&nbsp;"

<P>well here it is..lol laterr</P><lj-cut text=""my vent""> Well in the beging of this month alot has happend..I broke up with a b/f.&nbsp; Kicked myslef for about 3 days thinking I made the wrong decision..then I had a friend who helped me get over it and move on..luv ya missi! I met new people and I found out something really upsetting.&nbsp; I always knew my grandpa drank alcohol, but I never had my dad and mom tell me he was an alcoholic or that he takes pain pills when he really doesnt need them, it just hurts.&nbsp; I spent most of my life trying to be better then guys at almost anything possible and Ive tried to be the best at everything.&nbsp; Thats why Im always like ""I can do that to"" or pretty much just have the attitude anything a guy can do(like sports, lifting or just anything that has to do with being active) I can do too.&nbsp; My grandpa has always made me feel like my brother will always be better then me b/c hes a boy.&nbsp; Thats why I surf, its the one thing I can do better then my bro and its the one thing I actually heard him say yea thats my granddaughter or say hes proud of me.&nbsp; I love to surf..&nbsp; Now its like all that, all that trying to do my best wasnt worth it.&nbsp; I went from loving my grandpa when I was little to loving him less and less.&nbsp; Then my mom says something like well addictions can be genetic or something like that.&nbsp; I dont want to be like him.&nbsp; I used to think my grandpa was soo cool now hes just not.&nbsp; I went to Cocoa Beach in the begining of this month.&nbsp; My grandpa got me a new surf board and it was really pretty.&nbsp; I loved it! So my dad my bro my mom and my grandparents all went out to the beach.&nbsp; My grandparents when back and my mom did too then I saw my grandpa come out with his wave ski and some kind of drink and my mom was behind him.&nbsp; I needed a break anyway cus the current was real stong and I was tired of paddling.&nbsp; So my grandpas sitting in his chair watching my dad surf and my bro skim board and hes drinking this huge mug of beer or some kind of alcohol. then he decides to go wave skiing, yeah didnt work out he barely got out and he almost didnt make it back in.&nbsp; It just makes me soo mad! Idk..So lately I've just been hearing my mom and dad talk about how they dont want my brother or&nbsp;I to go there again untill he can not do it infront of us..yeah right.&nbsp; So thats why I get mad at drunk people..lol and thats why Im afraide to drink too much, I know they're not alcoholics but I just dont want them turning into one.&nbsp; It doesnt just hurt them but people around them.&nbsp; My grandpa drinks and he already has a heart problem..im not alcohol does to ur heart but Im sure its not healthy..&nbsp; Idk lots of things have been messed up, sometimes i find it hard to trust what people are telling me is the truth.&nbsp; and sometimes its hard for me to believe anyone.&nbsp; Ive just been confused..and all I have to say is that Im sorry for opening my mouth about anything..or saying anything that I shouldnt have said.&nbsp; Things are finally starting to get better but lately its just been once things start to get better and I think my life is finally okay things get worse..i just hope july is a better month..lol well I'm done..I just needed to vent!"

idk...just felt like sharing...this whole week has been so messed up...i don't know what to do anymore and i want someone to just tell me what i should do.  i hate how they just say i can't tell u what to do..i just don't know.  i wish i could just fast foward to see what the outcome of all this will be.  i just want to see if anythings worth it.

"event","not a whole lot has been going on latly.  just the usual, school - which, as it is getting closer and closer to the end of the year, im getting more and more anxious for summer to begin. i've been in a weird mood lately, i just don't feel like doing a whole lot, like my homework, schoolwork, my chores, etc. pretty much if i don't feel the need to do anything i won't. its like i have to force myself everyday to get out of bed and go to school or do my homework. idk what it is, maybe just lack of much needed sleep.

friday i hung out with ian.  then saturday i got some sun, maybe too much lol then ian and i went to see guess who.  saturday was also my parents 17th wedding anniversery, but they usually go by how long they've known eachother which is 27 years.  i look at them and it gives me hope that relationships can really last a long time.  my mom and dad have been going out since 8th grade.  its just amazing.  now normally i would sit here and type all the things that have been bothering me or things that im upset about.  but none of that really matters, so many other people in this world have way bigger problems to deal with everyday of their life.  and mine, well they don't seem that big of a problem anymore.  well i have to go eat dinner! Love ya!

"event","these past couple of weeks have made me relize that its safe to say i love ian.   i havent felt this way about someone in a long time.  it almost seems too good to be true, that one day i will wake up and it could all be gone.  i havent been this happy in God knows how long.  this summer i will most likley be able to go to michigan, i'm really looking forward to that.  

last thursday i went to miami and then south beach.  south beach has to be the most beautiful beach in florida.  the water looks fake, like it came out of a book or something.  its just pretty.  friday my mom and i went to the mall.  we haven't ""hung out"" in a while and going shopping was great for us to just catch up with each other.  saturday i want to islands of adventure for my first time with ian and his family plus michael(riley's friend, ian's little brother) for Riley's bithday.  it was alot of fun. even the drive there and back was fun, i slept most of the time b/c i was soo tired and then i had to make another 3 hour trip to miami on sunday, but it was fun.   so that was my weekend..i'll update later..

"event","Well I had a smigreat week and I had a wonderful weekend to finish it out.  Friday I had an indoor soccer game and we won! So we had another game right after that and tied. Talk about being extremly tired! THEN we had to stay like 15-20  minutes later cus we had to go into over time but we lost =[  I got home at like 7 and ate dinner and then went over to Ians.  We played man hunt with everyone and of course missi and I won! HAHA  
Saturday at 9 I had another indoor game but we LOST soooo bad..lol!  It was horrible. Later I went to JC Penny with my mom, just got a pair of pants. We went to Blockbuster, Publix, and Subway then later with the whole family we watched spanglish. Its a really good movie, but the ending wasnt the best.  Today Ian's mom came and got me at 2:30 ish and then picked up Ian from work and went out on his boat.  I got to watch him water ski! It was alot of fun!  Well, I hoped everyone had an awesome weekend!!

I never would have guessed that I would be with someone so great.  I hope this great feeling never leaves.  

Well I might as well tell you what I've been up to.  Okay every Monday night I have been going to acting classes from 7-9pm.  Its alot of fun, even though most of the people are like 30+ lol.  I have some really great news, but I'm kinda, ooo whats the word.  I can't think of it, ANYWAY I can't really say anything yet cus I don't want to jinx anything.  It good tho, I hope!  

Well today I was going to stay for indoor, but decided I didnt quite feel in the mood to be knocked around and I remembered i had A CRAP load of homework and if I wanted to see Ian I should get it done.  So after that exicting hour and a half I went to Ians.   Friday is my indoor soccer game and Ian is going for once!lol Its at 330 incase anyone wants to go.. Well after that I we might go see a movie if he can.  Well I need some sleep. Night!

I hate it when people expect so much from me,  I hate it when Ian says hes going to call me and promises me that he will, then never does.  I'm mad that summer seems so far away and that its even further away till i go to michigan.  I hate school and teachers and all the drama.  I hate it that i hate so much and I feel like Im dragging a weight that seems to be getting heavier.  

alright, well today i had 2 indoor soccer games.  The first one we lost and the second, the one I wanted Ian to go to but he wasnt home. It didnt matter tho because we lost that one too.  Im bored outta my mind and its a friday!! I wish I was out doing something then spending time typing in this thing.  lol  I'll update later..

When he came to pick me up I thought his mom would be driving, but nope, it was Ian*lol. I got to sit up front with him. Hes like the best driver! Holy crap. It was alot of fun, we went in the pool then went on the beach and then by the time we got back we were both starving, so we went to get his mom so she could eat lunch with us.  After that Ian wanted to go in the weight room thing they have there so I decided I could use a good work out too.  Yeah, I never knew I could lift 90 pounds with my legs, I scared myself..lol! Then we ran on the tredmills. Then we went on kayacks and my arms hurt soo bad! lol  At least I kept up with him, lol We went to a cove, it was nice. =] When were done we walked back to the pool and then his mom came out to get us so he drove me back home!  Then later I went to his friend Justins house.  

Today I think Im going out on his boat. Fun stuff, but I have to like bathe in sunscreen so I won't get even more burnt then I already am. Well I'm hungrey so I'm going to get something to eat.

How sad is that! lol!  But were better now.  School sucked, some people can be sooo annoying! I'm getting sick of people treating me and other people like shit. And not even realize that they're doing it.  Whatever happend to the golden rule? Or just living each day in the moment, drama has become everyones life it seems like.  No one can just talk w/o saying that someone whants to fight someone else.  I just hate that! 

Well, after school I went home took a shower, cleaned and went to Ians house. I haven't seen him in soo long! lol!  Then my mom picked me up on her way home from work (OH yeah! my mom got another job, just thought I would let u know..lol) So I went home ate and then went back to Ians. Hes going to get sick of me!

"event","Well today was good then bad then REALLY GOOD.*lol  The begining of the day was fine. I was really tired, as usual. I almost feel asleep in 2nd period AGAIN! For the past 2 weeks I haven't been falling asleep. I have no clue as to why I can't. hum.  Anyway, 7th period is usually really great, but not today.  I head a headach and to top it off, Eddie was being sooo annoying! So I guess James felt the need to be annoying too? And yeah, maybe I was being quite the drama queen, but I mean come on. I said stop..lol Then after school I went to keelys and Ian was there! Keely walked into the computer room thing and there were a whole bunch of roses in there with a fuzzy duck and a card. I kinda wanted to cry cus it was really sweet and no guy, besides my dad, has gotten me roses. I wish I was kidding, but I'm not.  The card was really sweet also!  I think hes the only guy that I don't care what I look like around, not that he will tell me when my hair is messed up or that I look bad anyway.lol* I don't feel all nervous when I seem him either, execpt sometimes when I don't know that hes going to be at Keely's or where ever, I get butterflys but then they go away. WELL after that Keely showed me the pics she got taken at Ft. Myers beach and I must say they were very cute. Well I will write later.  I think I might get to bed early for once. I could use a good nights sleep. <33
Love you!"

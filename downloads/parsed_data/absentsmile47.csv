"event","I fucking hate when gas stations are like ""door closed, use window"" I'm like really? 
1. I dont eve know what i want, i need to make AT least three laps around the drinks, 3 laps around the candy, and then around the muffins\donuts\treats section. 
2. if i make the gas station guy go get whatever I want I feel like a rude jackass and like maybe I should tip him, but do you tip gas station guys? 
3. How bad am i going to feel if im like yeah can i have this and he goes to get it and they dont have it, and i ask for something else and they dont have that either, and it just keeps happening until finally i settle on something i can see through the window, like a jumbo sized card.

"event","Its amazing. you should all go buy it from target or itunes. its so so good. my favorite song is this one

""Turn On Me""

You can fake it for a while,
Bite your tongue and smile,
Like every mother does an ugly child.
But the stars are leaking out,
Like spittle from a cloud,
Amassed resentment counting ounce and pound.

You're entertaining any doubt,
Because you had to know that I was fond of you,
Fond of Y-O-U,
Though I knew you masked your disdain.
I can see that change was just too hard for us,
Hard for us.
You always had to hold the reigns,
But where I'm headed, you just don't know the way.

So affections fade away,
And do adults just learn to play
The most ridiculous, repulsive games?
On the faith of ruddy sons,
And the double-barreled guns,
You better hurry,
Rabbit, run, run, run.
'Cause meeting you was fun,
And there's a lot of hungry howlers in this one cell.
We're taking it over,
Their brittle, thorny stems,
They break before they bend,
And neither one of us is one of them.

And the tails will never mend,
'Cause you had it in for me so long ago.
Boy, I still don't know,
I don't know why and I don't care,
You don't hide me anymore,
If you'd only seen yourself hating me.
Hating me,
When I've been so much more than fair.
But then you had to lay those feelings bare,
One thing I know still got you scared,
You're all that cold iron,
And never once aired of our dead.

You had to know that I was fond of you,
Fond of Y-O-U.
So I took your lips at the time,
And to change like that is just so hard to do,
Hard to do.
Don't let it whip-crack your life,
And bow out from the fight,
'Cause oh, how your sisters will write.
The worst part is over,
Now, get back on that horse and ride.

GO BUY IT NOW"

i told lyns yesterday that i was going to get in a car accident and that i had felt like i was going to for like months now. and right before the accident some other girl almost hit us when she took a turn super close and over the line and my mom was like gees! thanks for not letting her kill us. and then wham.

i slept in! sat around watched tv, did loads of laundry, dishes, and cleaned my room. now im cooking dinner.

im finally uploading all of my cds that i lost when i transfered my music from the pc to the mac

it was rather warm today, someone is cutting their lawn and someone else is bbqing. Seasonally speaking, scent wise it is very confusing.

"event","that's right im currently watching anchorman and i have to say it is breathtaking. this is the first time i have watched it since i was high from spray paint and it was like 1230 am in cucks room, which was filled with a grayish haze. 

so my garage room in closer to being done but still not finished, hopefully next week. 
the closet shelving is partially done and im very excited because it feeds into my OCD quite nicely. 

i didnt do so hot my psych quiz but i dont really care at least now i know what my tests will be like now. i already started my reading for the next unit..GO ME! and i even went to geography today too.

Its official, my last day of work is october 7th. and i applied for two new jobs 

bleeee blarrr blarr. im excited for the snl premiere..riding the dane train. 

It seems like i have so much planned out up until like thanksgiving, but it seems like the days are passing so so slow. 

okay i think im going to go to bed even though i havent finished anchorman. work in the morning wooohooo. i basically love everything that comes out of steve carrells mouth. i leave you with some fantabulous quotes

i'm Ron Burgundy? 

i'm very important, i have many leather bound books and my apartment smells of rich mahogany. 

i could be wrong, but i believe diversity is an old, old wooden ship used in the civil war era.


loving you all."

"event","so i got hired at BJS and today was my orientation. I shall be working the take-out counter 3 days a week, which means cutting my RL schedule back to 3 days and baby-sitting tuesdays. wooohooo.

my mom and sisters absence, my two jobs, and this whole apartment hunting crap i have been doing is making me feel freakishly adult-like, how gross.


so since last night i have felt like i had something stuck between my teeth i flossed last night, twice and came up with nothing. but it still felt like something was all up in there, until now. I just flossed and what should jump out but a chunk of either tooth of filling from a recent cavity i had filled. how great is that? it is horrible. now i have to go back to the MFING dentist. but i dont know if i can since our insurance changed thanks to the school district and my mom is gone and didnt finish the paperwork to complete the change or something. 

if i were an emo kid this is the point where i would make a remark about how the gaping hole in my tooth is like the hole in my heart. 

good thing im not an emo kid! 

well anyhoo in happier news i finally got my mood theme to upload but its notcomplete. 

and im going to go eat at murillos for kaycs birthday. even tho im not hungry in the slightest. yum"

""my friends are GREAT! mmm rivalry (12:08:41 AM): but if we hate eachother, i wish i were dead""

lol good stuff.

so yeah a brief life update...

graduation. i cired. knew that i would it was a really long shitty week the week before, not to mention stressful, so i knew things were just like welling up. i wasn't sad at all about leaving my friends, i mean i will miss them sure but i know i will see them all summer long and when i come home and its not like im going super far. i was mostly sad about leaving cuck, brown and mitsi. i felt kinda weird at first, ya know who misses teachers more than their friends but its different with them yaddida?


graduation party: yeah so my dad and his wife and my 2 lil sisters came over from AZ for the party. it was the first time my dad had seen anyone from his ""previous life"" in like 10 years. it was weird. can you imagine being friends with people and <U>completely</u> dropping them and then seeing them ten years later. it was weird and intense. went better than i expected. my mom freaked for  a few days prior and talked to the wife who was stuck surrounded by people im sure completely intimidated her while my dad talked to a few people. my mom and dad of course did not speak, but shared a <S>friendly</S> handshake when they left. other than that it was rather uneventful. except for you know dropping that they are probably moving to texas, because well arizona is apparently not far enough.

more ramble about the father: my sis and i decided we dont like the way they parent. after we had dinner with them and they were heading back to their hotel the first night hailey started to cry because she didn't want to leave us and they were like ""omg hailey dont be so dramatic, get it together blah blah"" im sorry she is seven years old and she hasnt seen us since december dont call her dramatic for being sad about leaving us once again. and the texas thing?seriously? seriously? 

 boys: HA. well boys will be boys i guess. they have the worst timing in the world and sometimes it just kills me.  kills me. but oh well i guess something cliche about things happening for a reason or something but ugh could boys occasionally grow up a little sooner or make decisions a little sooner or something?

sleep: well its summer so i dont sleep. and right now im watching ga wishing i had a mcdreamy hahaha."

"event","well, i am not even really sure why I went to school today. LT and I didnt have to do the math portion so we spent the period laughing, drawing stick man cartoons, and getting sick on candy. NOT that it wasnt super fun..i just went to bed at 1am and would have liked to stay home and sleepin instead. Anywhooo there wasnt really much point to 3per History, I spent it talking to Erin and Jill and harassing Newman. Then english..rather boring and a wasted of time...tho i do love me some Will Smith. and finally chem ....i sat on bacligs counter and text various parties while some people played a game...again i ate too much candy. Me and MathewJohn went and bought the STAR WARS tickets (yay!) and then i went home and changed for the gym. LT and I had a wonderful time, we saw Cailey and Stovall. After we went and got a smoothie from the Nutrition Shoppe . 
I think it's about time for a nap."

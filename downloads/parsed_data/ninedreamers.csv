How would you feel if those that supposed to be your closest freinds in the entire world criticize what you believe in, make fun of someone that you support, cast hatred upon ANYONE THAT FUCKIN FEELS THIS WAY, amongst many other things. Everyone has a right to there own opinion. But don't give me that same fucking excuse every time you generalize it. You can't fuckin prove me wrong on this. You don't criticize just what I believe in, you criticized everyone like me; So don't forget, I AM included in that large amount of people, so I guess you have hatred for me, too. If that's the case, let me know, and I'll talk to you about it...oh wait, no I won't. Some of you may feel that I am going overboard, but I can assure you that I am not at all exaggerating. None of you direct it to me, but the only thin missing is my name. You think it's ok to state your opinions all the time proudly, yet I say one thing, and you speak to me like you're God (yeah right). You show your support with pins, posters, etc., yet I wear a pin, not even stating what my side is, and one of you almost shits your pants at the slight thought that it's one of ""those"". Fuck that. None of you will probably read this or even give a shit. Suit yourself. I've dealt with this long enough. I've never been mean to any of you, but I just don't know how much of this I can take. I mean, how long is this gonna go on? BUSH won, I voted for him. I most certainly hope that you don't think those horrible things that you thinkg about all Bush supporters are accurate characteristics of me, because if this is true, bye. I hope not."

* School Sucks, too much work to do

* My brother had a skull fracture, that was really scary, I'm so glad he's ok

* More school work amongst other stuff

* Lot's of fun stuff, drinking, going out, etc
. 
* Got to see Neisha a couple of times, fun stuff, saw J.M., that was fun, also Josh, fun stuff amongst other people

* Stupid drama

* Lot's of guys...yumm...haha

* Done with finals finally, yes! Can't wait to party!

There's been a bunch of other stuff, too, but anyway...yeah. I'm kind of upset right now. I guess that happens when people say mean stuff about you. Anyway, I'm all stressed about some of my grades. We went to get Neisha today from Madison, oh yeah! I'm hurt by something though. It's like, people look at what one person does, then claims that the whole group does it because of that one person. I'm sick of this shit. I don't get how people can get so upset about something that ""people"" did, while DAMN WELL KNOWING that only one of the people actually matters to them. Maybe two tops. There's noone that I hate. It really upsets me when people are hurting, especially people that I love. It hurts when someone talks about you and your friends when there barely ever there. It hurts when people don't come to you and ask you what's going on with it, and it hurts when someone that you have considered a friend for a long time gets upset, and everyone gets a finger pointed at them, while it seems that the only people the person cares about most are probably the ones that care the least. I'm sorry, but this is something that really bothers me, along with others. I'm about ready to take a break from a lot of people for a long time if this shit doesn't clear up. Well, not from certain people, cuz why the hell should this take me away from them? I'll just be spending more time with other friends, and less time with them. It's bullshit. That's all that it is. If anyone reads this, and cares, you might not know what I'm talking about, but hey, what's new. You might not care, but whatever, I guess that shows something.

On a better note, it's Christmas break! That's so great. Well, that's it for now.

It took forever for me to find the people I was meeting up with. I was getting upset. Then I saw them and got excited. So, anyway. Neisha loves Jason Mraz, especially. So that was awesome. So when I talked to him, he was like, "" Heeeyy"". Whatever that was supposed to mean, but anyway. Then he asked me what kind of gum I was chewing. I told him. Then he asked if I had something for him to sign. He signed the poster that they gave us. He signed it,  and was like, "" What's your name?"" I told him. So he wrote, "" Emily rocks me"". Yeah, that was nice. He was like, "" Is if ok if I write this on here?"" I was like, "" Oh, yeah. Definitely"". Haha. That was great. Then he was like, "" Let's take a picture together, of us embraceing each other."" I was like, "" Ok"". Haha. So he put his arms around me. I did the same. It's a damn cute picture. We got to sit in balcony seats. The show was amazing. We all got cute shirts. Neisha and mine are the best! Yeah Neisha! Haha. Anyway, thanks much, Neisha, for making the Jason Mraz concert even better. You did post in your live journal, howevver, before I could show Leah my stuff. Way to go. Haha. Oh well.

This past weekend, Halloween weekend, was a lot of fun. I got to see Neisha, which was awesome. We stayed at a hotel on Friday. It was interesting, though, how we're paying, yet Ashley and I slept on the floor in the freezing cold. Interesting. Anyway, whatever. So yeah, we went to Pete's brother's house. Then we went to another place. We were a bike rack. Then there was this guy that looked similar to fireman. We were yelling, "" Fireman"" and "" Ben"". He came over by us. We were like, "" Is your name Ben?""  He said no. We were like, "" Are you a fireman?"" He said no. It wasn't fireman. So why the hell did he come over by us like he was. Haha. That was great. We got some really cute pictures that night  on Ashley's camera.  We eventually went to State Street, which was crazy. It was a lot of fun. I got lost from the group, and got upset. I was trying to call Leah's cell phone, and she wasn't answering. My phone didn't show that she called, so I ogt mad, and thought that they didn't notice that I was gone. But eventually, they answered the phone, and I found them by seeing Ashley's green hair. I guess Neisha and Ashley were getting worried about me. So thank you for caring guys. I apprechiate it. Everyone that was worried, actually. That night was so fun.

On Saturday, I got really excited. April and Katie came. I hadn't seen April in ages. I love that girl. So glad they could come. So before they got there, we did a whole bunch of fun stuff. Then we went to Cousins, and the party boys came in. They pointed at us through the windows, and came in and danced for us. That was so funny. There were so many skank hoe outfits worn by people for the Halloween weekend. That was interesting. So yeah. We got ready. April and Katie got there. We went out. It's kind of difficult when you've got that many people, and everyone wants to do something different. I found it interesting that it got complicated all because people didn't want to do what we'd been planning since before we even graduated from high school. Oh well, I guess that's their problem. It's not good when you end up hurting people by it though. Anyway, I had a lot of fun seeing everyone that night. Certain people left that night. Dont' ask me why, cuz I couldn't even tell ya. They haven't even told anyoen, so how am I supposed to? Anyway. Whatever. It was fun. So then we went to Qdoba. There was rioting outside ( We were on State Street). That was fun. Haha. Anyway, os we were trying to somehow get through, and get back to the dorms. It was extremely cold and rainy outside. That part sucked. Oh well.

We left on Sunday. It was sad to say bye to Neisha, but it won't be long to we say hello again. I can't wait. Anyway, at least April and Katie were there, otherwise I would've had to leave on Saturday. Actually, I might have been left there, because they were gonna leave without telling me. Thanks guys. Anyway. This was a great weekend.

It's Monday. I have so much work to do. I didn't do any of it last night. I was so tired. I kept falling in and out of sleep. I have paper to do. Oh yeah! Thanks for having us, Neisha! That's it for now. Love ya. See ya."

I just wanted to put that in here. I love Bob Marley, and that's a good phrase. Anyway, I'm sick. That sucks. Oh well. So I came on here, and I'm so excited! Neisha is coming to visit us this weekend! That girl is great. I'm in a much better mood now. She might bring her roommate and her roommates twin sister. That'll be cool. They're awesome. Well, that's it for now. Oh wait, I wanna give a shoutout to Peter Field Feix. Haha. Also, Leah likes pussy. J/K. Leah, you know that was funny. Haha.

"event","I love the song Love and Happiness. Anyway, so yeah, today was alright. It was fun, actually. I saw hotness again today. I'm druling right now. J/K. Anyway, so we got to actually drive somewhere today. I mean, we get to do that, but it's like, usually we're down at UWM, or walking or something. Also, I got to see Ava, Alana and Steve. I love them. I haven't seen Steve in a long time, so that was cool. Well, It's still so early in school. I just realized that. You know what? People can be so inconsiderate sometimes. It just pisses me off. Seriously, when people don't get why I get pissed about them saying mean stuff, that really fuckin pisses me off. Cuz they just say, "" It's the truth"". It's like, yeah, it's true, you're an asshole. It's like, who the fuck are you? Ya know? It just makes me so mad when people are just mean for no fuckin reason. If I say something mean about someone, it's usually about someon that has done something mean to me or something. But when people just say stuff about random people, that's just fuckin rude, ignorant and obnoxious. Grow up. Anyway. I really hope everyone is having fun in college. I am, and it's only just begun. Neisha better come visit us soon! Anyway, I didn't mean to kind of snap before, sorry. I don't wanna sound like I never say anything mean. But I don't just see some guy walking down the street and say, he's so ugly, or anything like that. Also, when my own friends insult some of my other friends, that really hurts. I just don't get it. So anyway. I love Josh. I just wanna say that he's great. He listens and actually gives a shit when I tell him about stuff, unlike 95% of the other people. Like if I said that I was crying, most other people would just be like, "" Yeah, so guess what happened to me today?"" I mean I don't want any sympahty, but it's like, yeah, thanks. If I had balls, which I don't, I'd say you may as well kick me in my balls. See, I usually don't like to bitch or say stuff like that , because I don't want people to think that I'm all sobby and upset. Cuz I do get upset. It sometimes happens often ( depending on what's going on). But then like 5 minutes later, I just think about everything that I do have, and feel bad for ever complaining. So then I'm happy again. I honestly am blessed. Anyway, a couple more days til' the weekend. Thank God. More partying to do. More boys to talk to, then begin the week with class shit to do. Well, that's it for today. See ya."

"event","Let's see, umm....I donno. Ok, I haven't written in here in a while, so I gotta think of what to write. So, yeah. Last time I wrote was when Leah and I visited Neisha. Since then, I donno. I guess I've been busy with school and stuff. I like it at UWM. I started on the 2nd. I mean, it's school, but it's better than some other places, ya know? Great, grand, wonderful. Anyway, so I keep discovering more hot guys each day, which is definitley a good thing. I'm sure Leah will agree with me on that. Anyway, oh yeah, awe, Shannon called me today, and I haven't talked to her in a while. I love her, she's so awesome! Also, some boys that I haven't talked to in a while called me the other day, which was cool, cuz I love them, too. So anyway, Leah and I met Becky's boyfriend the other day (Friday). It was fun that night. He's nice, and shy. Anyway, on Saturday Leah, Ashley, Peter, Ashley's friend, and some guys were all hanging out, and we went partying. So we went to this one party, and Pete and Ashley left. So Leah, Josh, Jacob and I all stayed or whatever. Then the cops came. So we had to jump off of this thing. Well we didn't have to, we just did for some reason, cuz that's what the guys we were with did, so I donno. So we went to the dorms, and went to this one guys room. Nice boys, and one asshole. It's like, who the fuck do you think you are? He all assumed I was gonna go ""hang out"" with him, and ditch my friends, ""right"". Neisha called us while we were in that room. She was drunk, and vary funny. She kept repeating stuff, which was really funny. She told me that she fell again, which is so, so funny. We were like, awe, Neisha. Then just as we were talking about Joe M., he called Leah, which was really wierd timing, but whatever. Anyway, so then we went to Josh's room after that. Josh got into a ""fight"" with this guy. He was creapy, and kind of freaking me out. But anyway, then we went and smoked. That was nice. Yeah. So then we walked Josh to his room, then went to the vending machine (munchies), and then to Leah's room. It was a fun night. I can't wait to get trashed this weekend. I hope Neisha comes, cuz that will make it  even better. I love that girl. Anyway, that's it for today, so see ya."

"event","This whole weekend was so much fun. Well, today's Monday, so I guess, well, whatever, last weekend, whatever the hell. So, Friday was so much fun. There was drama as usual, but who gives a fuck, cuz what's new right? Haha, j/k. Anyway, yeah. A certain person did things that maybe he/ she shouldn't have done. I don't really know exactly what she did, but whatever. Anyway, we went to this party on Oakland, and it was fun. Leah and I had fun at least. I don't know who else did. So yeah, once we started to talk to some guys and stuff, ya know , talking or whatever, it became a lot more fun. There was drama, well not really drama, well, yeah, there was. Not with me, but with one of our friends. Anyway, so Saturday, we went to visit Neisha! Leah and I went. It was so much fun! First of all, we got to see Neisha, which is awesome, and B (sorry, I do that), we went partying in Madison, and that was a lot of fun, too. So much stuff happened that night. A lot of it is in Leah's live journal. She remembered everything, cuz she kept writing things on a sticky note all night to remember it. It was hilarious. There was a fireman, and no he didn't like me, in my opinion. But anyway, yeah, I saw some hot guys. But anyway, Neish, don't even deny it, you know you were drunk as hell, and you fell, twice.  I'm glad you finally got to pop a squat, and then you were yelling about there being no toilet paper, after you finished it. Let' see, what else. You freaked out about stuff written on the marker message board things, and then you ran down the hall when Leah wrote on one of them. You also couldn't get the damn door opened, and some guy had to help you open it. He laughed and was like, ""Wow"". Leah, you were being so mean about that guy that had his shirt off. Also, you kept asking about the reefer, which was funny, too. You also called me stingy, which really pissed me off. Just cuz I'm not a whore like D.T., that doesn't mean I'm stingy. Haha. Anyway, you told me to give the fireman (Ben), umm.... yeah., because I'm stingy, and that it was a special occasion. Also because he's hot. You and Neisha seemed to think that he liked me. I don't think so, but anyway....yeah. So, what else. Umm....We kept geeking out for some reason. Jill was nice, too. Oh yeah, Jill was at the party, and she offered to help Neisha with the whole, ""pop a squat"" thing. I was talking to her at the other party, too. Cuz we went to some other party, too., where Neisha fell. Later, she fell in her room, by her computer. It was hilarious. Anyway, on Sunday, we were supposed to get on the bus in fromt of the Memorial Union at 12:10. The fuckin bus apparently not picking up there that day, but at the Bus Depot place, it was. I was supposed to work at 4:00. The next bus wasn't til like 2 something. I was so fuckin pissed. So have like 3 hours this week because of that stupid bull shit. Damn it. I was so pissed! But anyway, I guess it was a sign that we were supposed to spend more time with Neisha. So we stayed later, and took the 5:30 bus. Then my dad and I dropped off Leah at her house. Anyway, there was probably a lot more stuff that happened, but this thing is so long already. Anyway, one more thing. Neisha was upset about some stuff. Neisha, we love you. All I have to say if, be patient! Time is what it takes. Well, that's all I have to say today, I guess. See ya."

I can't wait until I get to party. It's gonna be so much fun. It's different, cuz I can do even more of whatever I want, yea know? Even re than I already can and do. So anyway, it'll be fun.

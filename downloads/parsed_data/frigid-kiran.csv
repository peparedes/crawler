"event","Working at Camp Max taught me something I never learned as premier babysitter to the Punjabi population. Kids can be downright evil. Seriously this twelve year old was giving me total attitude.

Anyway, I havent been able to post due to the computer never being available, because I currently have family over.

My birthday was good, I just hung out and went to Boston Pizza, and to see Spiderman 2, which was surprisingly awesome (I completley agree with you Anna), much, MUCH better than the original, which I liked the first time, but quickly faded imo.

Anyway belated friend party/get together tommorow. That'll be fun.

In the meantime I'm hanging out with my one and a half year old nephew, who thankfully hasnt cried in the past couple of hours.

Yay!"

"event","Tuesday: I finished the Math exam, I thought I did okay but not great. Helped an old man vote (i was the emergency translator), my Aunt, Cousins, and nephew came from Thompson, my Cousin and Nephew live in India now so it was really great to see them, my Cousin Preet and I went for a walk.

Wednesday: I was supposed to go shopping but I ended up babysitting, and volunteering an extra shift.

Thursday: Stay far far away from White Chicks... I assumed it was going to be crappy (my cousin wanted to see it) but DAMN! One funny part Marlon Wayans ""suitor"" breaks out into ""A thousand miles"" by Vanessa Carlton. Other than that ew....

Friday: Went to Polo, shopped, was able to talk my Cousins into to seeing ""Dodgeball"" instead of ""Garfield"". Very funny, not to everyones taste but I really liked it. (""We need 50 000 dollars!"" ""Maybe we can pay them in Canadian!"").

Saturday: Went to a couple of Indian stores, went to Zellers, Garden City, and then had Pizza.

Sunday; My cousins left, I babysat my brother while my family went out and we went to Walt-mart.

Today: I couldnt go with Nicola and Ginnie to the see ""The Notebook"" (damnit!), I had to babysit, then we went to Chapters where my Dad picked out something for my B-day. Dont know what. Then got a haircut and eyebrow waxing, their not too noticable though, my waxing was just a cleanup, and my hair was just trimmed to be the same in the back, and layered in the front. Then we went to vote. I saw Tereyn volunteering. Then I went home and did ""cardiopilates"".

That was my week or so :)."

"event","Mimi and I killed the purple barney knock off!!

We were at the career symposium and had a surprising large amount of fun chasing after a purple dinosour named Lew (from some business colled), she finally cornered him and I snuck up and tied him with my lasso.

She got a t-shirt, I got juggling balls.

Afterwards I went and got my haircut and finally got my eyebrows waxed, one turned out really well, the other was bald and I had to fill it in. Next time, I'm getting someone else to do it."

No thats not true. I hate bigoted Assholes who think everyone who isnt a straight, white, protestant man is beneath them."

"event","So my aunt came yesterday on her way back to Thompson. It was pretty fun. We have this ""Tradition"" of always going to see a movie so we saw ""Starsky and Hutch."" Because she was in the mood for comedy and had heard it was good, and because I have a slight crush on Owen Wilson, and cause my little brother will watch anything with a car explosion.

It was really funny, particularly Snoop Dog, and the Will Ferrals scene. There was however a threeway scene that was really uncomfortable to watch with my 52 year old aunt. Or to watch at all...Unless your a guy...

Happy early B-day Nicola!!!!!! Just in case I dont get to my live journal tommorow!!!"

"event","I have homework. History, Bio, and Pre-Calc. Although the bio is my fault. I need to learn to finish and hand in reviews.

And tonight we're throwing this dinner party thing and I'm to babysit the kids. I dont really mind though. Their very well behaved, in a Stepford kind of way.

I just feel like doing something. I dont know what. I'm bored. And recent news that I have to watch my brother and his friends at his birthday party while they go see a movie doesnt help. My brother likes talking dog movies and pokemon/Yugi-OH anime. I am preparing for a major headache."

"event","Well I just got back from the hospital. It was barely an hour and a half today. The place was basically deserted except for bitchy nurse Angie.

School was pretty good today. I love history. Its fun, even if I'm probably not learning anything. Aside from what kind of shampoo Elias uses and how much Lilia hates Ms.K.

Speaking of, she didnt tell Ms.Dyck why I missed choir. I really think she doesnt feel its a class and that its fine to miss.

i have homework though. Math. Which is surprisingly easy. Almost too easy."

"event","I am seriously pissed with Ms. K! First she tells me to come at lunch, so I do. Then she says to go get lunch and come back in 20 minutes, so I do. What does she do? Make me wait  for 25 minutes while she talks to Ms.Loganberg about how horrible the Grade 11's are. While I'm sitting there. Looking at music. never mind that I'm friends with some of the people that she goes on about.

Then we finally get to start. She tells me that Cajun Folk song is fine and dandy, I just need to work on Mazama. Agreed. So I'm supposed to actually listen to the recording because ""My musicality is good, my rhythm needs work."" I get that. And I'm not at all pissed about it. its my own fault for not practicing.

But what the fuck was with whining about ONLY the Grade 11s? She mentioned the Grade 12s exactly twice.

Bitch.

Anyway, other than that school was good. In Bio I saw blood cells, and history was so much fun. Much canadian idol talk. And so far I understand Pre-Calc.

I then went to Chapters because my brother wanted some Zelda play book, and I said ""Eh, what the hell"", and they dropped me off there, and I got ""Snow falling on cedars"".

Now I should go study for Bio."

Well I got one. Though I'll probably never update. I'm really bad at keeping things like these.

Anyway, exams are over. FINALLY. I think I did pretty good except for band. 65. I never have really gotten that low in band. Thats what I get for not practicing."

I am seriously so obsessed with those girls..I would prob. pay $10 for a baseball card that they held in their hands. It would be so rad to be able to travel to Japan and party with them!

<a href=""http://tinypic.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i32.tinypic.com/2yn3qlt.gif"" border=""0"" alt=""Image and video hosting by TinyPic""></a>These past few days I've been really bad about sewing and getting things done to sell. I've just been so out of it and haven't felt like doing anything. I'm usually good for a week or two and then I just feel really down and out for a while. I started a Rainbow Brite wallet as well as a RB t-shirt that I'll be listing on LJ soon. I also want to get a tote or two done. I'm def. making one out of the smiley food dabric I have but somone already has first dibs on that one! 
 
Yesterday Joey and I went to the mall since he wanted to buy some new clothes. I really didn't feel like going but it was nice to get out of the house for once and go somewhere besides Joanne fabrics or the post office! There was a sale on t-shirts at Hot Topic..I wanted the one that said ""I'm a Doll"" on it but then I found the Friday the 13th shirt I've been wanting for forever on sale in a size small hidden! I saw an xl and was like dammmn and then I dug a bit and found one! There were 2 really hot Elvira tops too but they were a bit too short for my taste. There was a Fresh Prince one too that fit real good lol. Joey said I could get 2 of them but I didn't want to be greedy and just got the Friday the 13th top. Yayyy! I used to never allow him to spend money on me..but hey..I was at the mall and broke so I was like oooh you should buy me this! lol.
 
While he was shopping I wandered into Claire's. I had 8 bucks left on my credit card so I bought this cute kitten purse meant for little girls to throw over their shoulder. I'm guna use it as a purse necklace, yay! Lately my bulky shoulder purses have been a major annoyance so I bought a cute cuipcake clutch the other week and that kitten thing. I saw the cutest little sparkly unicorn earrings there.. as well as 2 reallllly cute kitten pouches but I was out of monies =<. I found Joey and asked him if he'd like to get me the $4 earrings HEHE..so he did..and then he saw me gazing at a kitten pouch so he said get that too..and I was trying to decide between two of them and he grabbed them both and got me them WEE presents!  He  bought me some food at Panda Express tooz..mmm so good! I felt so spoiled..yay!


My friend Geneve came over to do me and my parents' hair. I haven't gotten a dye/cut job in almost 3 months >_<..I reallly needed it! Turns out the Gwar show is already coming up this Friday so we're going to go. Hurray! 

..Yesterday a boutique owner contacted me about a wholesale order for my cupcake hair bows and clip packs..so we'll see how that goes! It would be my first wholesale order...I hope she wants 800 of them lol.

I'm pretty sleepy.I should really be sewing to save up for my etsy bill..but I'm on the internetz instead >_0.<a href=""http://tinypic.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i32.tinypic.com/2yn3qlt.gif"" border=""0"" alt=""Image and video hosting by TinyPic""></a>

"event","Hey guys. Yesterday was horrible and today is even worse. I went over 1 CENT on my card a few days ago and owe a $35 late fee. It also says that I took a transfer from my account for paypal on the 28th..which I didn't and there's no history of it..So I owe ANOTHER $35 on top of the $10 late fee for the past 2 days not knowing about it. The bank lady wouldn't let me come in and give them a lowsy penny to take off one of my fees..Fantastic!

I see how to open up a buyer disupute..but anyone ever have a instant transfer they never did disputed and solved?

I marked down everything in my shop again. These prices will last up until tomm. night. Thanks in advance to any LJers that may make a purchase!

I created a custom bag for the loveliest lady located in the UK. It was a re-make of another bag, only I made it messenger style since she's a busy momma! She was so incredibly sweet during the entire transaction. I received this message and feedback just now, and I don't think I've ever been so touched! Sometimes I really don't think my stuff is that good and have doubts about what others think, but this really put a huge smile on my face! It makes me feel so good when I hear good feedback from customers. It makes me feel even better when people are so happy with their purchases that they return! Nothing could ever top that ^.^

<font COLOR=""purple"">""Nikki,

Received the amazing bag today. I hope the feedback says it all but I just wanted to say I think you are HUGELY TALENTED - I cannot believe you are only 19...your work is equisite. 

I wish you all the very best with your future sales and again - THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for creating my very favorite birthday present this year!

Big hugs

To potential buyers.....this lady is seriously tallented. The stitching on this bag is immaculate and is so extremely well made.

My Barbie brush is trying to steal the show. I bought that on ebay a few months ago. It also came with a cute pink comb with the Barbie logo on it too. They're both too cute to use >_<.

I bought this the other day...It is seriously the cutest thing I've ever seen! It was kind of expensive, but totally worth it! I have the perfect heart leggings to wear with it! I had to snatch it up right away or else I would have regretted it until my dying day! I just hope it will fit since I totally blew off the xs part lol!

Speaking of dollhouse bookcase I am going to try to assemble that sucker in a few. I'll prob. mess it up and my dad will yell at me but oh well!

Holy shit I bought a lot of stuff this week. No more I need to save up for others!! I feel so guilty now =(. I'll have to sew and craft a lot this week to make up for it =<.

On top of all that I bought a ton of chain,fabric and other supplies >_<! I need a shopping collar. Every time I attempt to click the ""add to cart"" button it needs to send shockwaves through my body. Yeah, that prob. wouldn't stop me >_<.</CENTER>
</lj-cut>

Man I'm so out of it. I need to go take a nap or something..but instead I'm off to hammer my fingers while attempting to get this dollhouse mini bookcase together =0D! I hope the mail man brings me some packagessss today! Speaking of packages I have more stuff to prepare for the post office Thurs. D=

Does this ever happen to anyone else? It happens to me nearly every time I go to upload. I have AOL dial-up so it takes even lonnnnnger. Mentioning this on the forums won't help either, mods seem to fly right past it if there's currently a bug. Guess I'll have to tr later D=.

I worked a while on them, especially on the bigger one. I got the worst headache from the glue..I had the ceiling fan on full blast as well as the door open but it never seems to work =/. When it starts getting nicer out I'll prob. just make things that involve craft glue outside! I just finished 2 more necklaces. They're nothing extreme, just charms I've bought on some awesome chain. I made a pegasus necklace as well as a cigerette necklace..I'll be listing those either before i go to bed this morning or later tonight when I wake up lol. Etsy was being the biggest bitch today..It took like 20 tries to upload a picture! I kept getting the cannot find server page..That usually happens a lot early in the morning..it sucks! I really have to pay off my Etsy bill, I owe over $70 now >_<. I have to save up for my sister's birthday present too next week. Gahhhh. I bought a few cd's cheap off an LJ user..I got the Donna's cd because it was only $1.50..Man do they suck! lol. I like the feel of their garage band music and how they sound..but the songs are just sooo lame! I hate songs that have the stupidest ryhmes that you can guess before it even comes up. I also got a cheap Bad Religion, Dropkick Murphy and No Doubt (Tragic Kingdom) cd..I'm listening to it right now =0D.

I found the CUTEST sweater tunic from 86' on Etsy last night! It has 2 bears on it holding ice cream conez!! and the cuffed sleeves have mini cones on them! I can't really spend any money right now since I'm saving up for birthdays (which I'm TERRIBLE at!) so my mom was nice enough to get it for meeeee! It was like $41 >-<. I'll post a pic once it gets here! It's stated as a xs/small..The xs part scares me ..but I dont care I'll squeeze my ass into it somehow!

Tonight I also recieved a super cute pair of baby doll hand earrings with bows on them..I'll have to show you guys those as well! 

I haven't really sewn much lately except to finish off a few custom orders. I'd reallyl ike to finish a few things for the shop next week.

I'm super tired. I only got a few hours sleep yesterday since Bambi woke me up scratching on my door because she's scared of heavy rain lol. I watched my new Barbie and the Rockers video..haha I love 80's cartoonz! My favorite part is when they show them dancing with their mouths moving for like 2 minutes straight but they're not singing at the time..and then there's lips singing along to the music and toootttallllly off..It's amazing I need more videoz!

I'm going to try and get both custom purses I have left fniished tomm..Hmm..I hope I can do it! Time for beddddd.

I'm so tired..I woke up at 6 to get ready since I had to take my mom to work and go to the post office. It's such a nice and sunny day out though and it makes me want to make something colorful and pretty..Hopefully my gold d-rings come in the mail today since I have 2 custom purses to complete! Actually..I have 3, I forgot >_<. Joey's birthday is tomm., I can't believe it's here already! He'll be 24. I think we're going to go bowl and get trashed..I suck at bowling so I always feel better when everyone is drunk. I think he's getting his stomach tattooed right now, haha that sucks. His boss is giving it to'm for free for his birthday though so I don't think it will hurt THAT much lol.

I'll be listing it along with a few other goodies (Barbie pin pack, cute hair clippies, mini Monster wallet) tomm. =). I have been neglecting my Etsy fees for the past month or two and owe 50 something dollars x_x. I need to get that taken care of asap. 

Monday night Joey took me out on a date =0D. We went to Stake and Shake (MM!) for dinner and then to a movie. We saw Juno. Frankly, I wasn't too pleased with it. I mean, it was good for an indie movie..but I thought (especially in the beginning) that they tried to make Juno and her girlfriend sound extremely too witty. It seemed like someone sat for hours just writing the phone conversation..It just didn't sound natural and too forced then and throughout the movie. I saw it hoping that it would have a bit more comedy even though it was about a serious thing..Joey and I prob. went to see it mostly because the kid from Superbad was in it honestly haha. Oh well, at least it was his treat because I never go to the theater at $10 a pop! I just wait until I can get them free with MVP at hollywood video =0D. I made an exception for Blades of Glory though and saw that when it came out..Right now I'm excited for when Sweeney and Todd is free with MVP. Speaking of Sweeney, Johnny Depp was in Crown Point the other week (and prob. still is) shooting some movie. Four years ago I would have jogged hours to hide in the bushes and stalk him. I don't have that little girl crush on him anymore, I just respect him as an amazing actor.

I started a cute purse using the sweet treats fabric..I want to use gold d-rings on it but ran out so I'll have to wait until I get the ones I ordered off Etsy to finish =/.

Hmmm..I think that's it. I think I'll go lurk the MAC community..I haven't checked up on anything for over a month. I really want to get some heatherette stuff though so hopefully there's swatches galore by now!

Oh well, I should have it up tomm. instead! I am really inlove with the jewelry I made today! I just wish I had more charms and supplies to work with..I need to get some asap! Nothing really went on today..I really wasn't at all in a sewing mood =/. I'm weird and for some reason I LOVE plucking thick hairs out with either my nails or tweezers..(I'm an obsessive eyebrow tweezer!). When I wake up the first thing I do is check to see if any eyebrow hairs have grown in slightly so I can get them! Well last night Joey took his shirt off (meow) and let me go at it! I sat on his belly and got about 15 of his chest hairs..Hurray!I haven't been getting much sleep lately..for some reason I haven't been able to sleep over 6 hours for the last 3 days =// I'm hoping to get atleast 8 so I'm in a better mood and will want to sew..because I reallllly need to!

The faster they ran, the faster the doggy ran away from them. I ran inside and got some dog treatz and went towards the kiddies. We chased that damn beagle for the longest time..I told the kids to stop running since the dog would only continue to run..but hey they're kids..so they kept running! The little sneak tricked me out of all my treatz..I finally got a good hold of the little bastard and then he scooted out of his collar and went for it D=. A few blocks later cute n' chubby beagle runs in-between some yards and finds another doggy leashed to a little fenced in-patio..beagle walks right in the opening like he owns the place and tried to start a fight with the un-suspecting doggy. One of the kids ended up cornering Mr. Beagle and I came in to pick his ass up. A man yelled at us for stepping on his grass...His dead,gray, ugly ass grass.They didn't have a leash on doggy (wtf?) so I carried the him allllll the way back to their home. He had poopz or mud on him and left it on my hands to remember him by >__<. 

I remember when my doggy used to scoot off her leash and run all around the town..and I'd be chasing her screaming with 800 slices of bologne in my hands. Thank goodness her rebellious puppy years are over!

She was barking a little bit ago at me to take her out poopz so I snapped a quick picture. Aww my little fluff puff.

I can't believe Joey's b-day is so close..It's on the 5th of April and I didn't even realize how quickly it was approaching! I really need to save up for his camera..I just don't think I will in time so hopefully he won't mind if he gets his prsent a few days late =<. I listed a few things these past few days. Tomm. I'll be listing a Malibu Barbie tote bag as well as a gigantor Barbie hairbow. I also want to get a few smaller sized monster wallets finished to put up since I know those sell fast. 

Check out my newest listings!

Since I've sold quite a few purses so far on Etsy I'm starting to raise my prices a bit. Supplies are sooo expensive and I make basically nothing for hours of work. I just hope people will still buy them =/.

Yay I had plenty of sleep so time to get tah craftin'! I will hopefully have 2 things listed today..I'll give you a hint..Barbies and poodles..but not all together. The Barbie thing I'm making is so cute..I know i have like 800 Barbie stuff lsited right now but I can't control myself!

I really hate talking about politics and if I get into it with someone (whom is usually a Bush lover..ew) I could go on forever..BUT ever since the campaigning has begun I've had the feeling that even though he hasn't been getting a lot of media attention McCain is going to end up President. I wouldn't doubt if him and Bush have pajama parties together..Just when we finally get rid of that idiot he'll only be replaced with a clone. I'm not even going to talk about Clinton or Obama really because I don't feel like writing a novel...and to be completely honest I'm un-decided on the two even though I don't really like Hilary very much at all. I'm afriad she's portraying herself as some unstopable woman who's best for the job (which is great) but the second she gets into office she'll crack from all the pressure. I'm not certain the one I'm leaning more towards is ready..Gah it's all so confusing! I don't know or think I know every nook and cranny about these people but whatever said is just my personal opinion, obviously.

I really hate when people say ""I hate politics..so I just try to stay out of it""..I wish it were that easy. If we all stay out of it that's when people like Bush get into office and then we sit back and complain and ask how it ever happend.

Presidential campaigns just remind me of middle school..Everyone would create fancy posters and videos to promote themselves and give a bunch of promises that they'll never keep. Half the time they they appear to us as people that they really never could be.

Anyway, I can't wait to use my new camera tooodaaay, hurrayyy.

Woosh today, well yesterday was my b-day. Ew..I'm 20! =(! I've never had a birthday besides for my 17th that really made me care about how old I am getting.. (mostly because whenever I heard 16 candles it made me feel all fluffy inside like it was just for me. 17 had a song too..17..17 pretty little baby at 17..or something. Well, there's no song about sweet little 20 so I'm old!). Yeah, ok that makes sense haha. If I could be 18 at the oldest for the next 7 years that'd be just great. The fact that there isn't a ""teen"" at the end of my age makes me sad =( Yah! 

So my day wasn't HEAPS of fun but hey it was better then nothing (it ended fabulous though..I got an awesome present >_<!)! 
<lj-cut text=""How the day went"">
I slept/tried to sleep until about 1:30 because I couldn't fall asleep due to birthday anticipation! Around 5 my mom and I went to UNIQUE, a ghettoe ass thrift store about 20 minutes away. I love that place, it's ginormous! I spent at least an hour digging through bagged toys..then I scoured the the top shelves in every aisle since that's where they keep more toys and treasures. While I was digging through the toys some boy came up to me and was very shy..He's like ""Excuse me..but I have something to ask you""..I thought hm..where will this conversation go as he says ""Oh..just forget it"" and turns away..Then I'm like ""What?"" ""Just tell me!"" haha..so he then says ""I was just wondering if maybe..you'd like to get to know one another a little bit better?"" AHAHAH..I looked at down at my toys, and wanting to return to the treasure hunt I just said ""Oh..I have a boyfrieennnd!"" so he goes ""Oh..yeah. I'm kind of ""with ::funny side to side hand gesture"" someone too"". So then I shook his hand (?) (Poor guy!) and said ""Well, it was nice meeting you"" and went back to my toys..He then got the point and let me be. Aahah. It was just so sad/hilarious because of how nervous he was.. What was he expecting me to say, sErIoUsLy! It takes balls (which I'm sure he has!) to come up to someone though, so kudos to stranger man. The same thing happend to me at Borders before when I was sitting down flipping through magazines..ahah funny. 

Anyway, I scored a few treasures but nothing to write home about =( I'll share them with you tomm. since I got A NEW CAMERA FROM MY MOM AND DAD AS MY PRE$ENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Getting that camera totally made my entire day completely awesome..It was like the best birthday (well better then 17-20) EVAH! I am so happy..the Kodak I've been using is like 4 years old and horrible..I tested it out and gave Bambi a fashion shot..she looked fabulous!

So after our thrifting adventures we stopped at this place so I could get hair clips I've been wanting..then I ran into Joannes again..got an ice cream cake at baskin robbinz and then came home.

..I found three sets of Baby Sitter's Club books at the thrift store..I'm kind of regretting not buying them =(. I also found some old Mary Kate and Ashley, Ferngully, a Muppet's Christmas and framing Roger Rabbit VHS's..but I put those back too =(

Man, thrifting lately has been such an addiction! We don't have very good ones around us but I must travel to find more! I want to go to a flea market in 2 weeks too and check that out too!$ So many trinkets and treasures are just waiting for me to find them!~

This coming month= birthday explosionz! I need to seriously get to sewing and crafting so I can save up for everyone's pre$ents in time!! Joey's is April 5th and I want to get him a new camera >_<. I have so many ideas of things I'd like to make (definately some cute necklaces!)..I just need to save up for all the $upplie$!!

Also, I need to pay for a Popplez tank a seller reserved for me on Etsy. I'm awaiting payment for a custom purse so hopefully that'll show super soon..I hate having people hold stuff for me I feel like such a jerk!

Yeah I keep talking!</lj-cut>

There are a few blogs that I truly enjoy looking at for their cuteness..I may end up putting all personal entries private and all others public. I really want a a cute, fun place to share all of my hand-made purchases from other sellers as well as my own updates. I also love being able to spread other diy designers' names, talented people most on LJ have prob. never even heard of! I realllly want better quality pictures for my sales..I also want to start buying some cute trinkets so I can set adorable backrounds for pics.

Joey's been a balla and making some mad CA$$H at work. Seeing him succeed makes me want to do the same..Well really we're both aries and I just want to beat him and make more =0D.

"event","<font COLOR=""&#035;F52887"">So yesterday I tagged along with Joeys to work and he started doing my piece around 7 or so after doing some roses on a chick. He finished the outline but I hate coming back to finish things so I asked him to do the shading too if he was up to it. The shading hurt a lot more then the outline since my skin was already irritated and raised from the outline being done, but it wasn't toooooo awful. I was running on an hour of sleep though so that sucked. It took 3 hours to finish. I'm really happy with it and was suprised that sleeping on it and walking was so easy since it's on my thigh. Hurray I want a piece on my other thigh now =0D. I hate wearing skirts because I'm practically transparent, so I wanna fill my legs up so I can prance around in dresses and skirts without feeling I look gross. Here's a piccy of it. My thigh looks a little gross from the ink and blood being rubbed all over but oh wells what do ya expect!

My mom may take off but I don't know what we'd doooo? I may go get my Elvis tattoo, my mom's getting me that as my present =). I bought a leather jacket from another LJ user and I can't wait to get ittttt. I also bought the cutest necklace necklace from PinkHelloKitty on Etsy and can't wait to get that as well!

"event","<font COLOR=""&#035;F52887""> Whoa I haven't LJ'd it up in forever!! I've pretty much just been sewing/sleeping/watching the same JEM episodes everyday. Friday night I FINALLY went out to see friends for the first time since NEW YEARS EVE (yeah, I'm a loser!!). It truly amazes me how people still want to be my pal after me never returning calls or messages for months since I'm a weirdo and never leave the house. It was my friend's Sarah's birthday so I had to go down there or else i would have felt bad =<. It was really nice to get out for a bit. I had a lot of fun. Things always turn sour at downtown Chicago parties though..too many punks think they're the shit and always have to start fighting over nothing...totally lame. The only bad thing about having a life for a minute is that I get too behind on my sewing and orders. Saturday was Carrie's birthday (well Sunday was her actual birthday),nother friend I haven't seen in AGES so I went over there for a bit which was nice. I hope you had a good birthday Carrie! Speaking of birthdays mine is in less then a week >_<. I hate birthdays..It's fun a month or so before your birthday because you're excited..but when it actually rolls around it's just another boring day! Today Joey's going to give me a huge tattoo for my b-day present =0D I've had this shirt of his that I hid in my room almost 2 years ago with a battle ship on it..I hid it because i knew that one day I wanted to get the exact piec on my upper thigh...so now is thee time! I can't sleep because i'm excited..i have to leave in a few hours too so that's guna suck. It'll take a few hours to get it done..but I don't care I want at least the outline and shading done in one sitting I can take it! I can tell he's happy since this will be the first tattoo he'll put on me =). Man I'm tired. Ok, so starting tomm. I have to get my cheeks back in my chair and sew the night away! I need more interfacing though..hmph..hopefully I can get some tomm.

I just ate hot peppers and eggs..what a disgusting combination lol. I found it in the fridge..it actually was pretty good and my tummy isn't exploding =0D.

Yesterday I made the cutest pouch in the entire world...I'm serious! I'll be listing it tomm. =0D. Gah, I keep looking at it..it's fantabulous! I went to the craft store last night and of course forgot half of the things I initially went for =/. I then went to Target in search for aome Barbie thing I wanted and they didn't have it >_< so I'll have to order it online =<. I did find the cutest Lisa Frank pouches for $1.00 though! I also got a cute piggy bank that I'm going to give a makeover. I picked up 2 of the Lisa Frank pouches and have to go back for moooore! LF reminds me of being 9 again..I used to buy a bunch of that crap all the time..folders, binders, stickers..

A lady wants me to make a tote for her 10 year old daughter's American Girl doll to be toted around in lol. I'll have to get started on that today, hopefully I'll finish it. She said she'll tell all the other mom's where she got it =0D. I really wish I had some business cards to hand out! I used to love American Girl Dolls..it was so expensive to get their real furniture and accessories though so I never did. I had Molly. One day I was playing with her and ""tucking her into bed"" and I thought she winked at me so I tore off all her limbs..She may still to this day be in the depths of my closet in her little white party dress. Maybe I watched Dolly Dearest one too many times..because that really freaked me out haha.

I keep having dreams about my doggy passing and start crying half the time in my sleep =<..It's so hard to think about, I love her so much. then I'll wake up and cuddle with her for 30 minutes telling her I love her 800 times and she looks at me like I'm crazy. I think I'm going to get a good picture of her and get her potrait done if I could find a good tattoo artist around here at that. I wish my family had a photo of all of us together..I want to get a ginormous picture of all of us (including bambi) as a back piece. I'll have to get us all outside on a nice day and take a good picture.

Welll time to go sew..i need to finish another cute pouch to list tomm. I already know what fabric I'll use..it has poodles on it and is supa cute!"

Damn you Etsy. Whenever I get my period I search for yummy treats I wish I had to scarf down like a piglet. Next time I have to order cupcakes and chocolates ahead of time so I'll get them just in time for PMS action. Cookie-brownie cupcake..mmm I want that. I also found this stuff called ""bitch-away"" that supposedly helps relieve menstrual cramps..I read some good reviews so I'll have to get that along with my cupcakes =0D. It's 3:00 P.M. and I haven't gone to bed yet..I should probably just stay up until 9 or so..I need to get some sleep so I can finish a tote I'm making for a loverly girl!

Most of my new fabric cammmmmmme. I didn't pay any attention to one print, it's vinyl..can't wait to work with that one...NOT. It's adorable though! I can't wait to make some new things after I'm finished with my current project! Wooooo."

I got 8 hours, I woke up a few times but would eventually fall asleep. I think I slept so well because Joey went out and didn't come home lol. He usually opens the door and turns the light on 800 times so it was nice to not have any disturbances since if I wake up once that's usually it and I'm up for good. Speaking of Joey I wonder where that little poop head is on our anniversary (monthly, not yearly so it isn't a big deal but we always acknoweledge it). 

Gahhh I hate waiting for packages and just when you think they'll arrive, nothin in the box! =<. I'm very impatient, so if I wait more then a week for a package I get all antsy. 

I got around to listing that Rilakkuma tote today! I love it so much. I also listed a pair of cute hair clips. I am waiting on a bit of supplies so I should have more things coming up shortly. Listing every day is too hard, but I'm not going to go more then 3 days without listing..I'm hoping for every other day.

I decided that I definately want to do a craft fair this Spring/Summer. I want to start getting little cute things for display! I'm excited =0D. I can be shy though so I don't know how I'll do with so many random peoples coming up to me 0_O. It's snowing =0D.

I'll wake up earlier to catch decent daylight and upload it tomorrow =-). I have the most horrible cramps from my chest to my uterus. Lets just say during hanky panky I think hanky hit something he wasn't supposed to and bothered something because out of nowhere I started getting these striking pains that kept moving from my stomach, to my side, and all over the place. It was really weird and hard to explain..it was like a very painful firework display of cramps all last night and early this morning. I'm feeling a little better today, though I ache whenever I walk or move much. Last night I literally cound not move AT ALL..I tried to just scoot an inch over in bed and wanted to scream bloody murder..I don't get my period for another week and a half, and this was definately 5 times worse then menstrual cramps atleast! Hopefully it will be gone tomm. for good. I can't even begin to describe how much constant pain I was in..jeebus. I'm extremely tired. I haven't gotten any sleep in the past 2 days so maybe I hurt extra bad since my body is so weak. I got 3 hours the other day and almost 4 last night =/. 

I sold 2 more things today =-D I am beginning to love Etsy more and more as time goes on. I wish I felt better and were more awake, I want to make some things =( Oh well, it will have to wait until tomorrow. 

Joey's boss at the tattoo shop asked if we'd like to share one of his tables at a craft fair this Spring. I think I may do it..that means I'll have to get my buns in gear and sew,sew,sew! I want to get some more tattoo print fabric to make a bunch of clutches and wallets since Joey and him both will be selling their tattoo flash and paintings =)."

I suppose to some people (or pervs) this may seem exciting as they have something, anything to look foward to each morning but come on..lol. The listing is for a ""365-day self-portrait subscription"". Basically every morning ($1 a day) you'll get a picture of this woman, or of other things in your online mailbox. http://www.etsy.com/view_listing.php?listing_id=9353630.

I guess it would be more fun if she was more attractive =0D..but hey everyone has different taste..and fetishes. What if she gets sick or has a hangover and doesn't send you your picture EVERY morning as promised? Even if she takes a months worth of pictures at a time I find it hard to believe that she'll have a picture sent in time every single day.

Good for her if people are actually buying it, money in the bank son! This may seem funny but it's just the same as pervs buying used panties and stockings on ebay. As stupid as this is I would do the same thing if I wasn't so lazy..this broad has already made over $1,000 for this stupid shit!

I would give them a week's worth of worthwhile pictures and then the rest would be of my bare ass in different locations and scenery.

It would be fun to hear some feedback stories about people's girlfriends/boyfriends finding all these messages in their significant others mailbox. Even if they suscribed before they entered into the relationship, they would still be recieving pictures every day unless it was cancled.

No offense to the seller or anyone else, these are my personal opinions. This is my journal after all don'tchaknoooow.

Speaking of Etsy listings..I updated today as well haha. I listed my first wallet too! Check back tomm. I'll have more =-).

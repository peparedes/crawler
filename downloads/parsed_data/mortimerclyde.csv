"event","Last night was my first show i have ever played at. It was great fun. I had Music Man until around 6. Then i went on over to starland (where the show was) getting a little lost on the way. We (the band) just hung out and got stuff ready and brought all of the equipment in. Then eric and i went to Loco's to see caitlyn and caroline and x-tine (it was caitlyn's birfday). Then we went back to starland around 8 and it still hadn't started (it was supposed to start at 7 30). it started around 8 10. Ashes of an empire went first. they were pretty crazy. it was like a band made of guys almost as big as lane. almost. then we played. we did pretty good. i screwed up all but one song but no one noticed because they couldn't hear me that well, so it was all good. i ended up tapping eric and albert with my bass when i was swinging it. they were fine though. but then on the last song, right at the end. i totally ooowned a guy in the head. i was chopping down with about as much force as i have and it slammed the kid right in the head. sorry kid. then was moving on. i didn't really pay that much attention to them. i spent all my time trying to block the damn asshole dancers. i don't mind some but a couple were just complete asses. also durring them three 40-ish year old people came in (one lady two men)(the lady and one of the guys looking very um well poor) but they hadn't payed? and were being asses about not paying so this big guy came and kicked them out. also the non poor looking guy was hitting on some like 18 year old girls? right. then... dun dun dun Arcasia Red played. those guys rock so hard. it was their last show which was sad but they were sooo crazy good it was hard to be sad. after the show i went outside but my car was blocked in. i knew i would be late plus i had to take erica home so i called my parents and they didn't really care.  so yea i got home like 15 minutes after curfiew but oh well. so yes, the show was great fun and thanks to all of you who came. and if anyone took pictures, let me know."

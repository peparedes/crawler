"event","Paul Newman passed away today at the age of 83. What he leaves behind is a legacy of great films, a loving family and a lifetime of philanthropy. The Vice-Chairman of the thespian's charity, Newman's Own Foundation issued the following statement in honor of the great man: <blockquote><p><span style=""color: rgb(128, 128, 128);"">&quot;Paul Newman's craft was acting. His passion was racing. His love was his family and friends. And his heart and soul were dedicated to helping make the world a better place for all. Paul had an abiding belief in the role that luck plays in one's life, and its randomness. He was quick to acknowledge the good fortune he had in his own life, beginning with being born in America, and was acutely aware of how unlucky so many others were. True to his character, he quietly devoted himself to helping offset this imbalance. An exceptional example is the legacy of Newman's Own. What started as something of a joke in the basement of his home, turned into a highly-respected, multi-million dollar a year food company. And true to form, he shared this good fortune by donating all the profits and royalties he earned to thousands of charities around the world, a total which now exceeds $250 million. While his philanthropic interests and donations were wide-ranging, he was especially committed to the thousands of children with life-threatening conditions served by the Hole in the Wall Camps, which he helped start over 20 years ago. He saw the Camps as places where kids could escape the fear, pain and isolation of their conditions, kick back, and raise a little hell. Today, there are 11 Camps around the world, with additional programs in Africa and Vietnam. Through the Camps, well over 135,000 children have had the chance to experience what childhood was meant to be.</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(128, 128, 128);"">In Paul's words: &quot;I wanted to acknowledge luck; the chance and benevolence of it in my life, and the brutality of it in the lives of others, who might not be allowed the good fortune of a lifetime to correct it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(128, 128, 128);"">Paul took advantage of what life offered him, and while personally reluctant to acknowledge that he was doing anything special, he forever changed the lives of many with his generosity, humor, and humanness. His legacy lives on in the charities he supported and the Hole in the Wall Camps, for which he cared so much.</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(128, 128, 128);"">We will miss our friend Paul Newman, but are lucky ourselves to have known such a remarkable person.&quot; <br /><br /></span></p></blockquote>One suspects that chance played a small part in his acting career, apart from the initial catalyst that threw him onto stage, then TV playhouses in the 50s and finally onto the big screen with his charismatic breakthrough performance in <em>Somebody Up There Likes Me.</em> A role that ironically came his way after James Dean (who was initially cast in the role of Rocky) died in a car accident. <br /><br />Newman and his equally talented wife Joanne Woodward we politically active in their public support of Democratic candidates Eugene McCarthy in 1968 and George McGovern in 1972. A civil rights activist, environmentalist and ant-nuclear campaigner, he considered entering politics but thought he would be elected &quot;for all the wrong reasons.&quot;<br /><br />For all the right reasons Paul Newman will be remembered as a screen icon, devoted husband, loving father and humanitarian. The world is a sadder place for having lost him but forever a better place for in influence in it. Rest in Peace. <br /><br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/stratford_maid/pic/00004ywg/""><img width=""307"" height=""200"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/stratford_maid/pic/00004ywg"" alt="""" /></a></div><br />"

Levitan recorded it on a reel-to-reel tape deck, and 38 years later has produced an animated film about the interview. <br />The result is both inspiring and more relevant today than ever.

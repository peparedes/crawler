"event","So I had surgery yesterday.  We get to the hospital at 7:30am check in they quickly take me back and have me change into a gown, start my IV, and ask me about 1000 questions.  Then it's waiting time.  Brad had an interview which I really wanted him to go to but he was hesitant I convinced him to go.  Then I had a breakdown when I heard the babies heartbeat, emotional hormones, worry for surgery who knows.  I just couldn't stop crying.  Once done brad had to go and his dad sat with me which was sweet until they rolled me to surgery.  They took me into the actual surgery room where I was awake for about 10 mins while they prepped the freezing room tied me to a table arms out, wrapped me in four blankets, all the nurses were great and told me stories.  The dr came in and turned on music and the anestheisast (spelling wrong) came in told me joke while he gave me the anesthesia.

Then I took two deep breathes and walaaa I'm waking up as they rip the tube from my throat and are rolling me to recovery a room with a bunch of people recovering and a bunch of nurses.  I open then I close then I feel the pain, oh my god I must have died it hurts so bad but I have oxygen on my face and am having trouble breathing and can't speak throat soooo dry.

Finally I can scream ice...obvioiusly feel like I'm screaming but more of a whisper moan.  The nurse who turned out to be super nice gets me some ice chips after about five mins I am able to moisten my mouth in order to make out the word...""BABY""  the nurse says to just wait labor and delievery would be down to double check.  Dr comes in and says I did great and went to talk to Brad and his parents.  Finally what was about 1 hour labor and delivery gets there meanwhile they have given me 8 doses of pain medication cause my pain is outrageous.  The labor nurse can't seem to find the heart beat.  I'm listening don't hear anything either.  She looks for about 10 mins meanwhile I start to panic and 2 nurses have to calm me and then all of the sudden she hears it and it disappears.  Turns out they think the baby was irritated at the surgery and turned its back on us.  Very relieving.  They go and tell Brad everything is okay.  Continue to give me pain reliever until eventually I have 12 doses, and 2 of anti nausea medicine.

Finally I can talk a bit and I say I am ready to go so they wheel me to another room to lay and Brad comes in and I'm in and out, I look like a horrible drunk, the nurse who is sooooooooooo nicce...so She helps brad and her dress me and I make it to the bathroom where I realize it is the hardest thing to do after ab surgery every and can't bend down on my own.  So brad helps we go back and they wheel me out to the car and home we go.  Then the rest of yesterday continued to be in and out of dying feeling.  By last night the pain reliever from hospital wore off and now I'm stuck with hydrocodene and not much of it...sooooo much pain.

Hard to sleep cause of pain and it effect all muscles in my body are sore too.  Now I'm tired but relieved that everything actually turned out okay.  Now to watch hours of tv until I can pass out :)  Boo to hospitals and surgery, but I really lucked out with the nurses and staff!"

"event","I seem to randomly update, but I needed to type.

I am sure anyone who reads this already knows but I'm 13 weeks preggie and expecting in Feb. This was planned with my boyfriend/will be husband in a year or so. 

We are very happy and excited to have this baby however, here are my issues:
I've been having morning (all day) sickness since week five.  I have gall stones and am having to have my gall bladder out next week.  

I'm starting to fear I'm too selfish to have children after reading all these books and blogs, how can I possibly feel crappy and take care of a child at the same time.  My boyfriend says we are working together and he really does do alot an I have no doubt he will continue too but I still worry.
I also have no bond or feeling whatsoever for this child growing inside of me and am worried that that won't happen, instead I'm angry that it is making me sick.  I know I'm suppsoe to say all the right things like it will happen and I will feel better blah blah blah but I'm being honest and I'm nervous and scared.  I don't want to term it or anything I'm just starting to panic a bit.  Plus I don't like being broke and babies do suck money.  

Boy and how many people when I say I'm pregnant only have negative things to say or they try and tell me negative things is ridiculous.  I just hate it.

Plus I feel like I was let into this secret mommies club that I still don't feel like I fit into, and Everytime I watch Nanny 911 I think about how spanking really helps and how obviously time out is not working really well.  Is that bad?

Okay this is my vent for now. I'm sure I will have more soon.

Oh and finding non gender specific clothes or items is actually very hard, so I think we have decided to find out the gender, plus it gives me something to look forward too!!!

Blah"

"event","Ok so to catch you up to speed, my boyfriend apologized a bizillion times since our last problem and we have gotten extremely close in the last six weeks and everything was going hunkey dorey and he asked me to move in 2 weeks ago and I semi I did...brought clothes some stuff etc and then I check on my house alot.  It's a lot easier to live at his house, because of the commute to work and not having three roommates like I have at my house.

Anyhow he apparently has started feeling claustrophobic and by that I mean like I'm smothering when I don't think I am I honestly think it is because now we live together so he has no where to depart to.  So last night when he didn't come home till really late I had called cause I didn't know where he was and was worried and when he got home I greeted him cheerfully asked him how he was doing and then asked why he didn't call back and he flipped out.  Apparently that was the last straw of me smothering him, and he was like ""You can't know where I'm at all the time I need independence and that if I want to be like that I can pack my shit and leave.""!!!!!!!!!!!!

What happened I don't think it is a lot to ask to just have common curteousy when you are not coming home so at least the person that loves you knows where you are at...am I being unresonable?

So one thing led to another and I was crying and he shut down because that is what he does and he got all pissy and slept on the couch...niether of us got hardly any sleep so now what. 

I sent him an e-mail saying I don't know what happened and we were so happy and then this...I really really really do love him alot but I don't know what I'm suppose to do.  And I am a bit pissed that I moved a bunch of stuff to his house and now I would have to move it again, make up your freaking mind!"

"event","Okay so I haven't spoken to my ""boyfriend"" I say in quotes because how can you be dating someone you don't see.  But I haven't spoken since our crash talk on thursday last week that left me sobbing.

Then yesterday I recieve this e-mail from him:

Erin,
 
I was going to call but when I got home last nigt and saw you had taken all your things, I thought all I would do is make it worse and I guess I still think that but wanted to write to find out. 
 
I just wanted to think, over the week that I was in Chicago and should have said something before but was not sure how and from your response Wednesday, I was also afraid of that. 
 
I never said I didnt love you Erin, I do, but I could feel myself becoming distant and not treating you the way I would expect myself to treat someone and you deserve more than that. You said on the phone that you wont bother me anymore, you were not a bother, I just needed some time and I didnt tell you and for that I am sorry!!!!!
 
I enjoy your company Erin, I was and still am afraid that I cant give you what you want or deserve and that is a real concern for me. I have fun with you, you make me laugh and I was sad not to see your things or you when I got home last night!!!! I truly was! 
 
So with that said Im not sure what to do, Im not sure I expected the result that has happened because of our talk on Wednesday. I do know I hurt you but I was more afraid of continuing to hurt you or staying with you and not being true to what my heart was telling me, thats not fair to either one of us. 
 
I have to do some running around tonight, but will gladly sit down and talk with you if you want somtime this week. I can still take you to the airport on Friday if you need or if you want me to leave this alone, just let me know! 
 
My computer crashed over the weekend so the only place I can check my email is at work...FYI.
 
Brad


Let me know what you think of that...to me he just sounds confused and a bit hypocritical.  So I called and we talked and he said things were getting serious, which I said how because I haven't done anything except for just hanging out.

He seems to be looking for someone who is willing to play this game.  I don't play games.  If I want to see you I want to see you...I don't pretend I don't get phone calls or ignore you to make you like me more....It is not who I am.

At the end of our phone conversation I said ""Our we still dating""  he said he didin't know...well I said I can't wait forever and then followed up with the question, ""Well should I see other people then?""  He said ""NO""  like it was the dumbest question I had ever asked.  You can't have both things, you can't have me and not have me.  It's not possible.

I still feel confused...solely because I wish I could shake him.  He's 41 and at 41 you would think he would be over this crap."

"event","Here is my problem...

I have been dating an older guy now for 4 months technically but kinda seeing each other for 6-7 months as before that worked as co workers for a year.  He has treated me extremely well however he has been single for a lonnnnnnnnnng time before me.  

He has been the one to bring up all committment things ie...getting married, kids, me moving in, that he loves me etc.

The recently he became kind of distant and said he needed time to himself during the week so okay but he wasn't communicating very well.  I talked with him and said it is fine to need time to yourself you just have to tell me.  (I think that might have pushed him farther away)

He now went out of town for work and I didn't talk to him for four days and then when I did he was kind of cryptic and said we needed to talk on monday.  I asked if we were breaking up and he said ""it depends how the conversation goes.""  I don't know what happened.

I used to be a black or white person who never had boyfriends.  When feelings get involved it is soooo messy.  Now I feel like I'm in a big mess.  The person I used to be would just walk away and move on, but the person I am now really loves him and is extremely confused and worried that monday will come and I wll get really hurt.

He even wanted to put up my christmas tree in his house, and now I'm not seeing it, so I went yesterday (he is out of town) and took down my tree and took all my things out of his house.  That way if the worst does happen I don't have to go around and collect my things.  Plus it is right before the holidays and I made it so I would specifically come back to spend new years eve with him.  It is really upsetting.  

I'm a bit overwhelmed and I was laid off three months ago and so I have no job which is not good for me because I feel overwhelmingly unproductive.  :(

Alright I'm done with my pity party.  Any advice I would greatly appreciate.  

I have on the bright side have lost 114 lbs."

"event","Halloween was awesome.  Brad took me to see the new Chris Angel Cirque show which was horrible, and either they need to change it or it should just be shut down.  Nothing really good about the show except three dance numbers that were very good.

I met a lot of nice people and probobly had a few to many drinks so that by the end of the show when I was out at the VIP after party by the pool (thanks to Brad's brother) I offered my feelings up to the general manager of the luxor about how bad the show is.  Oops...oh well...guess I wont be employed by the luxor :)  Then I danced the night away which was great.

I have an interview tomorrow for a Harrah's position that I really really want!!!  So wish me luck :)  

I do need a job...it's very depressing/demotivating to not have one.  I get bored easy and I walk through the craft aisle and never find anything to catch my interest...or at least that Im willing to spend money on.  

I have now lost 106lbs and feel great...although I have been craving food lately...which scares me.  

Alright I'm off to bed as I'm apparently an old woman and 9pm is when I fall asleep :)"

My house is wonderful although very big.  So I got two roommates.  A girl who is awesome, talks a lot and very personable.  A guy who is a psycho and I think an alcoholic.  I'm looking for a new one so I can kick him out but we shall see.  He might just be harmless.

Jared and I are completly done and it's been awhile since that but I have a new guy I'm seeing.  Age difference is pretty big, but he is awesome and sweet and kind.  He is also stable which is something that I'm sure is good for me right now.

I have also lost 104 lbs and feel amazing.  My blood preassure is not high anymore my cholesterol is great.  I am feeling amazing.  I have gone from a size 22 to a 10/12.  Because of the new me I have also had the ability to do more photo shoots and have an interview to work with children teaching theatre tommorow for an agency.

My birthday is coming up and I'm excited mainly because I get to see New Kids on the Block which I'm stoked about.  My friend who was suppose to go with me bailed on me and I was all upset.  I have since found another great person to go with me but the new guy in my life was sooooo sweet and offered to go knowing that it would be a super femanine thing for him to do. :) I was just happy at his thought.  

Other sadder which in turn is good news is I was laid off two weeks ago because of the poor economic situation.  My team was really supportive, but I think it is for the best because I will find a way better job.

Alright I think that is an update for now.
I do miss Illinois, I was recently in Denver and realized how much I like green grass and green trees and then I started thinking about the leaves changing in Illinois and I miss that. :)"

End of July I have a trip planned to go to LA to visit friends and Mid September I just planned a trip to NYC to visit friends.  I seem to have non existent money burning a whole in my pocket. 

I also will be closing on my lovely new home I bought on June 27th.  This summer is going to be busy.

"event","So I usually don't do stupid things.  But however today I was holding a vase that flowers came in because I was trying to clean it and apparently I was holding the vase too tight and it shatters in my hands.  I sliced my hand open.  It hurt so bad My arm was covered in blood.  I started screaming (because I'm not the most suttle person when it comes to injury) 
Jared bounced out of bed so fast and came running.  We got the bleeding undercontrol and it clotted all around the cut.  

Then after I held the bloody rag on it for awhile it was time to decide if I needed stitches.  So I stared at it for awhile and finally just couldn't decide so I was going to go have it checked, but by that time the phone rang.

Dun dun dunnnnn....I answer it is my realtor telling me I got the house I made an offer on.  YAY the house is awesome, pain subsided for excitement.  The house is in North Las Vegas and is in a great neighborhood.  It is 2000 sq. ft and has four bedrooms and a loft which they made a fifth bedroom but we will knock out the door and make it a loft again.  It has three full bathrooms, and a covered patio (great in vegas cause it gets so hot) and a large balcony of the master bedroom which overlooks the mountains.  The house comes with every singles appliance so we need to buy nothing.  It's spectacular.  I can't wait to move in!!!!!   

After the excitement died down and I called my parents My hand started to hurt again.  So I called the doctor and asked how do you know if you need stitches...they didn't really have a good answer so I made an executive decision that I didn't.  We put alcohol on it and neosporin and bandaids up and down it. 

The rest of the day was spent relaxing and watching tv till now when I wanted to tell all. :)

We should move in around the end of June beginning of July!!! YAY!!!"

So it means all the more reason I need to loose weight and exercise.

Yesterday was so beatufil here.  A bit over 80 degrees, Jared and I went to the park and walked around and watched the kids play. (it was so pretty, everyone flying their kites)

I also took him to Hash House A Go Go which I love.  Jared didn't believe me when I told him that the servings are stupid large...he now believes me he said he could have fed three third world country villages with his meal...His plate was 16""...HUGE.  I suggest this restaurant to everyone because the service is wonderful, the food is good, and the atmosphere is the best.

I'm attempting to buy a house right now (knock on wood) I put in a bid on one last week and am just waiting to hear.  My fingers are crossed.  It's a beautiful 1800 sq foot house two story with three bedroom and 3 bathrooms.  

My nose is all stuffed up, which I think I would rather feel ill then have a stuffed up nose, because I feel like I can't breath...I think it is allergies but it drives me crazy.  

I feel like I need to take a trip to Illinois.  I miss everyone and wish I could see everyone in one trip.  I think I want to wait till it gets warmer.  Plus I feel like everyone is either pregnant or getting married. :)  I wish I could be there for everyone's big days :)  Those of you who are you know who you are and you are always in my thoughts.  

I can't wait to see the movie 21 other then I love Jim Sturgess...Jared was an extra in the movie as a dealer and I hope we will be able to see him in the movie :)  They filmed that sooooo long ago...can't wait."

"event","So we had been dating 7 months.  And this morning was the end of it.  I am single again.  I know it is only 7 months, but when those 7 months I have spent almost every single day with someone and really feel like I knew him more then anyone else.  It hurts.  I actually don't know if I have ever felt this sad, and hurt before.  That whole saying It's better to have loved and lost then to have never loved at all is bullshit.  First of all I think that was said just to make someone like me feel better and second of all at least if I have never loved at all I can just be bitter, this way is pain, hurt, and bitterness.

So overall this blows.  I wish he would just realize that I'm pretty amazing, and I wish that I would stop myself every time I try and pick up the phone to call.  Maybe I expect to much, or am too needy I don't know, but I think it will be a long time until I ever date again.  I made it 23 years without getting hurt by someone like that and now lets see if I can make it another 23 years. 

I know I haven't updated in a long time, actually since like Sept, but I'm doing okay.  Vegas is fine.  My brother turned out to be a horrible person who wishes my death, so I don't live with him anymore.  I live with a girl named Arin in her house in a way safer part of town.  It's nice and affordable.  There are so many jobs available in vegas, so if anyone needs one, come here.

I worked a UFC Fight yesterday.  I don't understand why people like this.  I stood next to the right, and it was just all bloody and mean.  Everyone was british so that was a plus.  

I need to take up hobbies to get my mind off of him I think.  Maybe I'll go skydiving I have always wanted too.

P.S. I miss hearing from everyone.  I know I fell of the face of the earth recently but I'm back and hopefully will get grounded soon.

I graduate in one week.  Thank goodness.  It's starting to hit me that I might not see some of these people again, but I don't think I will be very sad about that until graduation is over ya know. 
My show is over it went really well.  People seemed to like it a lot.  I have been working alot I worked everyday for the past week.  And sat through what felt like 100 interviews on thursday and friday.  Now I just have to make it through finals. 
Went to Mock Prom last night, which was fun.  The theme was come as your favorite song lyric, so I took a bag of sugar and went as ""Pour some sugar on me, I'm hot, sticky, sweet, from my head to my feet.""  So by the end of the night I had sugar all over me, and was hot sticky and sweet (true story).  I won an award for spends the most time in the airport lounge, which probobly isn't true...I know a couple people who spend more time then me, but I make my prescense known (and by that I mean I'm loud).  :) 
That's really all I have to say...oh I keep feeling like I'm reliving things that have happened. 
Oh yeah the other night I ended up retyping the dance concert program(which the first copy from royal publishing was horrible but none of this even involved me I just happened to be the house manager that night.  So I retyped the program and have it taken to kinko's this is all friday night.  Kinko's isn't open 24 hours on friday night which pisses me off.  So since it is Cinco de Mayo well actually so late that it is past midnight I get my bastardized mexican food from Taco Bell to celebrate and head home.  To where I find my parking spot is taken.
Soooo I call Joe's Towing and my landlord and I am pissed cause there is nowhere for me to put my car(and my Taco Bell is getting cold) So I call Joe's and say ""Do not tow my car it will be parked in the middle of my lawn.""  Pretty sure it was the girls next door that had friends over cars that were in my spot.  So then I try and go to bed but can't fall asleep cause I'm still afriad something will happen to my car.  So I call Joe's Again and they since it is the last week of college the police are everywhere and they call dibs so I understood hung up.  Then at 4am my phone rings so I assume it is Joe's telling me they are towing the cars and I can move my car and answer but no it is some call from another country.  So I flip out hang out now I have just answered a phone call from another country, how flippin' expensive can that be.  Then call comes in another10 times so I have to turn off my phone cause I'm not answering.  Then I go downstairs just to make sure my car is still there and the girls next door with their b/f's are outside screaming and carrying on(I don't know if it was about their cars) but anyhow I knew that if I went outside to the drunks I might get my ass kicked, so quickly shut the door and back to bed I went.  Slept a littlle longer and I had to be up at 7am on saturday morning.  My car didn't get towed thank god, and when I went out the next morning all the other cars were gone so that's good. 
This was my evening from hell.  I'm glad it is over, looking back it could have been worse...but it still sucked.
Alright going to do my laundry now because I have been procrastinating. 
Peace"

"event","So it's been awhile...but I have made it through mid-terms hopefully without F's, and I went to Las Vegas from Saturday to Wednesday to meet my brother.  It was amazing.  Not only is the city beautiful (I don't know if I could live there probobly someday)  but my brother is pretty flippin' amazing.  I'm not going to lie I enjoyed the feeling of being a little sister ya know.  I liked having a big brother, instead of being the oldest all the time.  It was so great.  

It was funny because after I had left him and all his amazing friends I got on the plane I got really sad cause I thought wouldn't it be nice if he could be in my life all the time.  I know I might very well be the most emotional person in the whole world so of course I started crying on the plane.  I'm sure the guy sitting next to me thought I was ridiculous.  Plus I was hungover and I'm sure I kind of smelled bad.  :)  

I also learned that no matter where I go on my own I'll be able to make friends.  I broke through a huge barrier for me I went on a bus alone, a plane alone, and I made it.  I don't even like going to the grocery store or the doctor alone.  :) I made friends every where I went and that's really nice.  

When I was coming home after being in vegas I was about one sec away from hitting four deer.  I swerved but I pretty much could have died.  Very scary. 

Today had a dentist appt, and luckily we didn't get the foot of snow until I got home so we are all good.

All in all this might be one of the most memorable weeks of my life.  I also took a bunch of pics that I just got back (kind of wish I had done my hair for them cause I look like crap but I'll post them soon) sadly the pictures of the lights of vegas didn't really turn out.  My camera sucked.  But the important ones of my brother and I turned out :)

Lastly I NEED A JOB.  I need a summer job and then I need a real life job.  I'm starting to freak out.  I need money so bad.  I'm not going to make it without money and I can't live in byron il forever.  AHHHHH

Alright I think I'll go read the classifieds now :)"

"event","Alright weekend was a success sort of:
Friday I had all my mtgs. and went and got a manicure and pedicure.  Then went home and worked on projects and homework.  When I went to get in the shower I slipped and fell hurting myself kinda badly (I know I'm lame and I also sound like I'm 80) then went shopping with Lauren and spent the rest of friday night taking another shower and pampering myself. 
Thus brings us to saturday where I sat thru all the freestage auditions...some better then others but that is how it always is.  Overall a great expierance and then went to meet my aunt and her best friend Molly and Molly's extended family at a hotel cause it was Molly's daughters 21st birthday and she goes to ISU. 
Then We drank A LOT and went to Alexander's Steakhouse for dinner which was really good I can't believe I have never been there.  Then back to the bars to continue drinking.  I have to say I am the worst pool player to ever walk the earth.  Then went home went to bed.  Oh my body hurt all day saturday and sunday from falling.
Today I have woken up sat around got some work done, and went to the student choreographed dance concert.  Now I sit procrastinating doing my homework.  All in all a good weekend.

Question if you dare to answer:
What makes someone a good friend?"

I should have been stronger.  I should have been smarter.  I miss the feelings I used to have before all of this.  I wish I could still feel the innocence, I wish I could still believe that people loved me.  I have discovered entire new ways to mask the pain.  No pain might not be the right word.  I am just hurt.  This one thing has changed me forever wether I want to let it or not.  I used to think I just wanted someone to hold me and make it all go away, but that won't happen.  I have to do it for myself.  No one can do it for me.  I need to figure it out or I lose.

Up Front by: Erin Dixson

It makes me think, do we live for others or for ourselves?
We wish for it to end, but then what will begin?
We want to be loved, but not hurt. The good but not the bad.
When do you grow up? When are you suppose to be appropriate? When are you being honest, and not just mean?
Who's in charge?  What's the criteria?
Where is the line and when do we draw it? 
Who decides? What's the criteria?
If money doesn't make us happy, what does?
Why are we turned on by love, but still like to see fights?
Why are we type casted in life?
Who decides? What's the criteria?
Where is the balance of life?
Do we take words seriously or let them just fall? And if we just let them fall, what's the point of listening?
How come the bad is so much easier to understand then the good?
How can I hate if I don't know what that means?
I want to be held, but I want my freedom!
If you are going to judge me, then why should I bother?"

The expierance of being home  
I went to Erin Steele's and fell asleep on her couch...I was tired But saw a lot of people I haven't seen in a bit.
Then Saturday we all went to Milwaukee and that was interesting...The car ride was hysterical.  
I got homish around 4am and my ma woke me up so that we could go shopping at a really early time.  Thus we did, and ate at the Machine Shed (gross)
Oh I rented Hair and Kronk's New Groove...both good in their own way.
Today I'm doing all my laundry and tonight we are going to the Byron Bars...that should be quite interesting.  
Not that anyone reading this cares of my step by step schedule but if you might then there it is.  Also since school is over I can't even speak english anymore I'm going into an educational coma."

What has been happening...I have been working alot...People have died...friends have been made and lost...and the semester is almost over.

Lisa Adams and I are looking at living together in Chicago next year so that's exciting news.

I think I'm going to do okay in all my classes if my finals go well

My brother has a new girlfriend of whom I actually approve

I am doing a directing scene that I really enjoy doing.

I was cast in Tony n' Tina's Wedding that will be performed in January (that's really exciting)

Jenny and I are writing a two woman show (I think it will go well :))

William is writing a musical staring me (this should be interesting)

I really need to do laundry but I'm not going to until I get home so people will have to suffer with the smell of dirty Erin

I never got to Chicago to see Danni's show like I wanted too.

I hate when guys say ""Just do what you got to do""  it is something I Can't stand I really hate it.  I also really don't like when people try to tell me that femenism is a joke.  grrrr it gets me all riled up. 

I have been getting shit from certain faculty members saying that they can hear the staff during Arcadia...well it was finally figured out tonight that it wasn't coming from my staff it was coming from upstairs near the music rooms.  So it wasn't my fault, thank god.  I hate judgemental people too....

Welp I think that raps up this journal entry
oh one more thing I hate...people who think there world is coming to an end because of finals week. :)"

I went out tonight and I came home hurt.  Not physically, but I just wasn't feeling it.  Those nights when you are just not feeling it.  I feel like I'm surrounded by these amazingly beautiful girls and then theres me, and around all of us are these guys (good and bad) who only want these amazingly beautiful girls.  Then I hear one of my friends say something about how Erin should hook up with oh yep the ugliest guy there.  That's when I lost it.  I can't take this anymore.  Mind you I am drunk now and will probobly delete this tommorow, but right now I'm hurting more then you can imagine.  ""You"" being the society who puts these perspectives in place.  Also if I hear another girl tell me how they don't enjoy being called pretty I might kill someone.  They keep telling me that they want people to like them for there personality shut the f up.  You want to be called pretty just as much as anyone else.
Also if I have anymore guys come to me and tell me about how they want to sleep with my friends or how they think my best friends are so hot.  I also might kill someone.

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...I hate using this as a venting place...but all my friends are gorgeous so they don't seem to understand.

I'm going to bed...I need a hug and I need someone to mean it."

I am totally broke, and the money I do have will have to pay off my credit card bill for this month which will be ridiculous I'm sure.  I'm really ready to graduate but then I don't know what I'm going to do.  I'm going to have this college degree and then what?  I would like to have a job before I leave college that would be spectacular.  We had our cable shut off cause cable is expensive so I've been watching a lot of dvds.  It's nice but I think I'm going to have watched them all soon and will need to go rent some.  I also figured out how to sell books on half.com.  Everyone else may be doing it but I just figured it out and I have sold a bunch of them so that is exciting.  
Only one more month and a week till my birthday."

I for some reason only find the need to write when I'm hurting or philosophical and right now I'm both.  I think it is because we very much alike is why we bumped heads and I can't tell you how much that hurts.  
How well do we know people, even if I've gone to school with you for three years how well do I know you.  I just need someone to hug me and hold me.  Take away the pain and heal my heart!"

I still have a lot to do.  I always start the summer with a crap load of stuff I want to get done by the end but I never actually do any of it.  
My parents are coming on friday so that is exciting.  They are going to see Twelfth Night hopefully they will like it.  
Last night I went and saw Charlie and the Choc. Factory, I still really like the first one, but this one was a lot of fun to watch and I loved the one oompa loompa man.  Plus the spuirrels were great too.  I saw the preview for ICE AGE 2 MELTDOWN and I don't know if I can wait until 2006.
Alright I'm off things I need to do today
clean room (might get done but probobly not)
get eyebrows waxed.
pay water bill
pay electric bill
go into work.

I think I can get it all done hopefully"

I am blessed right now to have this friend that walked into my life right at the right moment, and I know I've only known her for a couple weeks but she has helped me deal with a lot of things.  
I'll be sad to see her leave

Hanging out with folks I don't usually hang out with.  Doing things that I usually don't do.  But that's not all bad.  

Went glow in the dark mini putting and it was super cool.

I haven't laughed so much in one month as I did recently since I don't know when.  It makes me happy to laugh to the point where I can't catch my breath.

For those of you who I don't see...call me.

"event","Alright I haven't updated in awhile...
Lets see ISF is going well.  All the merchandise has been ordered and is looking wonderful.  Went to Cancun and it wasn't that great at all, but I got a little bit of a tan.  Was told I was selfish for not wanting kids.  gained a couple pounds back.  Danced with some fellow ISFers at a corvetted convention at the radission (that was a blast).  Saw Mr and Mrs Smith (which was not great) found out one day I will be the maid of honor in my friends wedding.  I went parasailing (maybe possibly not spelled correctly) and cried (I don't like boat rides)(you had to ride the boat first in order to para sail)  
On another note I found out that everyone in the whole entire world (and by that I mean a group of my friends) are way more expieranced then me in EVERYTHING.  I'm like a little kid, I didn't even know what some of the stuff they were talking about was.  I will never have sex to just have sex, but I'm starting to get really curious.  
When I grow up I want very little decoration in my house.  I want it to be very clean with little wall decor.  
Anyways that is about it...also I DID NOT GET TO SWIM WITH DOLPHINS (which was the only one thing I wanted to do in cancun and I couldn't even do it) ""selfish girl pout""
And that concludes my meaningless rant and complaint.

"event","Okay I know it has been awhile since I've updated. I'm officially a senior in college whaahoo.  One more year and then I'm done. Done. Done.  I Moved into my new apartment.  I like it a lot.  It gets a little lonely because it's ginourmous.  But I like it.  Had a Thai dinner for the management staff and it was a lot of fun.  Best Thai food ever.  
Shakesfest is going well I almost have everything ordered.  Hopefully I'm doing a good job and everything I order sells really well.  My mom came down last night and today her and I cleaned my room.  well she instigated it and thus I had to comly.  
I kept thinking my room smelled weird every time i come in it, but I just found this plug in air freshner by my bed. . . Not really a good smelling air freshner.  But oh well I will let it run it's course.  Either my land lady put it in their or the last tennant.  
Abby (a ball stater working shakesfest as well) and I work out five days a week and this week was our first week.  It totally kicked my butt.  I'm so not in shape.  She's a bean pole and I'm well...not.  
We also made a pact that I can't say the f world (not the bad f word but the f -  a-  t f word.) and she can't say the word ex boyfriend, oh and Kenny wanted in so he can't say the word firetruck.  We are trying to cut some negativity out of our lives.  I know dumb but it kind of helps.  I sort of have stopped make jokes at my own expense when I can't use the f word.  I used to think I was being funny but now I think people laugh cause they don't know what else to do.  

Anyways if ya'll are coming to see the shakespeare festival I will be in the gift shop. Come say HI.
Peace (which a little girl in walmart gave me the peace sign when she walked out in front of my car.)"

I have two huge finals this week and lots of little things.
Yesterday I climbed in a dumpster to get moving boxes, it was actually a lot of fun.
My to do list is getting shorter so that's exciting.
Went to Mock Prom was a lot more fun then I thought it would be.  Won the award for needs a muzzle...(even though I totally talk less then some of those people on the award).  
I go to Cancun in less then a month so that's exciting.  
That's about it I'm procrastinating stuyding and I really need to do that.
So long"

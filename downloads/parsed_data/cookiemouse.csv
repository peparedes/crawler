"event","this time it was about how i was taking too many credits of useless classes.  my mother thinks that if i take 15 credits of science courses i will magically do really well and raise my gpa.  she does not believe that taking two science courses is enough to make me want to shoot myself, and that two anthro courses and one chinese course will in fact raise my gpa tremendously.  i don't understand.  first she says my gpa is too low, then she says that raising my gpa doesn't matter cuz all i'm doing is taking useless classes?  i've already ""un"" declared my anthro major, i'm majoring in biochem and satisfying pre-pharm requirements, i mean what else does she want?

i don't understand how she can upset me just by saying something as simple as, ""why are you taking chinese now?""

but i mean, why AM i taking chinese?  i don't really need it.  without it i'd have 12 credits, still ok for a full-time student.  and with research i'd have 15.  so am i just making a stupid mistake by signing up for another class?  granted the class won't take much work, but...it's funny how parents still retain the power to make you feel crappy even after you've sworn your independence from their way of thinking.  so either i'm just doing it to myself by allowing myself to feel crappy, or...yeah that's basically it.  i should do what i like right?  but i'm afraid of letting them down, letting myself down, getting bogged down with work and giving up so that halfway through the semester i've already resigned myself to a B.

College is starting to be no fun, and I don't want that.  im starting to hate having to make my own decisions."

On the first day of biochem, with a professor that actually seems really cool, despite the scary moustache, he tells us that studying three hours for every hour we spend in class is gonna net us a...C.  So how much should we be studying?  At least 15 hours a week for a B or A.  Notice, he doens't say for an A.  He says for an A or B.  I'm scared.  And you know what?  We didn't even get tablets.  What a horrible class.

And sadly I'm actually really excited about working towards this A.  haha.  despite the lack of life -_-"

Weeeeeeee.  And this time, since my grandpa's here, I had to sit in the middle of the back seat, which meant being smooshed between my mom and my brother.  They said it was cuz I'm now the shortest in the family, which depresses me to no end, but whatever.  At least the AC was directed right at me.  mua.  ha.  ha.  ha.  haaaaa.

I think the highlight of the trip was rolling down a hill at a random rest stop and getting joked by my brother for being a ""bad roller.""  puhleez.  i INVENTED hill rolling, thank you.  but after 5 minutes of fun i had to endure three hours of itchiness.  not as bad as my brother, who somehow ended up with grass in his shorts.  

The greatest quote of the trip: ""If you think you're too small to be effective, you've never been in bed with a mosquito.""  hahahahahahahahahaha.  i mean yeah it's supposed to mean that mosquitoes are effective at stinging people despite being really small, so then...small people can be effective too?  hahahahahaha.  ok i'm sorry.  that was retarded.  btw that came off a fortune cookie.  how come i never get cool ones like that?  mine was lame.  so lame that I can't even remember what it was.

Maybe not that drastic, but I do need to find a partner haha.  Maybe there'll be someone who is taking 204 and already took 203?  At least Kris and Emily are still in the lab.  We can be a cozy party of three :P  *note to self: smack weitao for taking physics lab...

So apparently I've been learning the Omei straightsword basic without even knowing it.  Yayyyy I can pretend that I go to Omei too.  So I now have a video of some chinese girl doing it, except that the sword kinda flies out of her hands at one part.  But that's ok, cuz Weitao's still learning the form out of a book so it's a good reference anyway.  So according to Tommy we'll know all three weapon basics for this coming semester, and Drew and Grace might finally learn something new haha.  I wonder if we're gonna learn new compulsory though.  I don't want to, even though there are some cool running sequences in there (HA as if I could do them anyway :( ).  I'm deathly scared of cartwheels now since I randomly fell on the ground last time we did them.  1 month of gymnastics back in middle school does not help you in wushu.  Neither does a completely unflexible body.  Damn my genes.  I'm pretty sure flexibility has something to do with genes, either that or accidentally falling into splits as a kid.

In other news, I went on a music downloading spree last night and downloaded a crapload of chinese music.  It took forever though, and is the prime reason why I was still up at 2 am to talk to Sajal about the MCAT.  I really should start studying for the PCAT.  And really random, but there's a volunteer thing at the hospital that does knitting!!!!!  I really wanna do it, it'd be fun plus I'd have an excuse to knit :P  I think I'm turning into an old grandma.

"event","and by productive, i mean in terms of hanging out haha.  i spent way too much money these past three days, but oh well...it was worth it?  hung out with the nova-ers + weitao + will yesterday, we went to that AMAZING restaurant that we first discovered at the wushu social.  OMFG red bean ice cream is SO GOOD.  and then i found out (from a random scoop of ice cream that stuck to the scoop) that peanut butter fudge ice cream is EVEN BETTER.  So we were all bloated and feeling guilty from dinner and ice cream (or at least i was), so what better thing to do than wushu?  and then there came moments where serena accused richard of being stupid and then got laughed at for actually being stupid (ok, so i didn't remember mem gym had parking?? haha), but four hours of wushu ensued.  not really hardcore.  didn't really get much done, but fun anyway.  i ended up stabbing myself in the leg with my straightsword because my arm was in an awkward position, and it was made apparent to me that my arms have no muscle because i couldn't even hold the sword for longer than five minutes without getting a sore shoulder.  but i learned the next part of the straightsword basic...however i'm not entirely sure if i remember it.  is it my memory that's bad?  or is it hard for everyone to learn new moves?  i don't get it.  it's supposed to be the basic form right?  so how come when weitao shows me stuff all i can show him is a blank look and halfhearted swipes?  haha...mehh whatever.  i can only get better :P

and then today we woke up mad early and pissed off will, then went and ate at golden corral.  the guys did some wushu.  serena napped.  amy watched the notebook again and STILL thought it was a dumb movie.  all in all, unproductive weekend, but at least i got to see the nova-ers :D  and now i just ate an entire bag of baby carrots without even realizing it.  at least it's not ice cream.  ehh.

highlights:
- the serena vs. richard intelligence battle.  i think i won.  
- the amy vs. tommy blanket battle.  amy forfeited.
- the combined phoning powers of amy, richard, serena, and tommy vs. weitao's phonephobia battle.  we totally won.  finally.  after perhaps 15 missed calls.
- the will vs. tommy bball battle.  will got kneed, tommy got scratched.  tie?
- the tommy vs. wet grass wushu battle.  tommy got owned hahahaha
- the richard vs. tommy weirdness battle.  by popular consensus, tommy won.  or should it be...lost?

Went to class, worked out, came home, ate ramen (yeah serena seriously needs to go vegetable shopping soon...), watched dramas, then in the middle of a crucial heartbreaking moment, my little bro ims me.  Not my actual little bro, in which case the following conversation would have completely freaked and grossed me out, but my high school little bro, otherwise known as Xu.  Not Frank Xu, who no longer has the capacity to shock me haha, but another Xu.  At any rate, the topic of the conversation was: sex.  Apparently he's the only one out of his friends to still be a virgin.  And the issue that he was having problems dealing with was that he felt out of place because he hadn't had sex yet.  

Um.  Well.  First of all, he is in high school.  Granted, in today's society it's a ""well, everyone does it, why can't I?"" sort of mentality, but still.  I can see it happening in college, but in high school?  It's weird.  A couple years ago I would have been shocked, half an hour ago I was still shocked, but the feeling faded after a couple minutes.  Sex after all has become commonplace, and it's no longer a big deal to sleep with someone before marriage.  But to think that my friend felt out of place because he HADN'T had sex?  That just isn't right.  I don't think our conversation was really him seeking advice, I think he just wanted someone to tell him what to do so he wouldn't have to think about it anymore.  But honestly, what the hell is wrong with this world that he should feel OBLIGATED to have sex because his friends have all done it?  I know my thoughts aren't original, countless articles have probably been written about the ""degradation"" of today's youth, but honestly.  What.  The.  Hell.

But I mean, come on, a lot of people work out daily, and I'm sure they don't feel exhausted after taking naps.  Maybe there's something wrong with me.  I know there's definitely something wrong with my ankle because I can't walk without twinges of pain going through first my left and then my right ankle.  That should be fine after a couple of days though...probably just overexertion?  Haha it seems like I don't even do that much though, I feel like I have to constantly prove that I'm working hard and as a result I probably do more than is healthy for someone just starting out working out every day.  Or maybe I'm just a wimp that can't handle pain.  Right.

I think someone told me it was an issue with my alt key because it happened once before, but with a different key that time, so I tried pressing alt apostrophe but it didn't help.  But then opening a new window seemed to solve the problem, so I can only conclude that my computer is possessed.  Geeeeez.

Amy got me addicted on Fushigi Yuugi, so I've been taking a couple of much needed breaks (read: serena got bored of reading about ELISA and so took a break every five minutes) to watch it.  I totally remember reading the manga (is there a difference between manga and graphic novels?) and then not being able to finish it cuz I only had the first few volumes.  Ahhhh so this brings back memories, and I'm SO EXCITED that this one girl on youtube has the ENTIRE series.  hahahah.  Gahhh I'm such a dork.

Haha he was like, ""I think this bio lab will be a LOT OF FUN!!!!! *excited happy face*""  haha it's cute.  And very Richard-like in terms of the sciency dorkiness.  Tomorrow we're doing our first lab, using the aforementioned ELISA technique to mix our ""bodily fluids"" (i.e. random liquid samples given to us) and test for diseases.  Simple.  So why can't I just concentrate long enough to finish writing out these pre-lab questions??  Sigh.  It's because Fushigi Yuugi is calling to me.  Honestly, it would be so cool if I were Miaka.  Despite the five near-death experiences so far (I'm on episode 10 out of 52), it would still be cool.  Especially since Tamahome rivals Tuxedo Mask in anime hotness.  hahahahaha I promise I'm sane.  But come on, you can't tell me you've never had a middle school girl crush on an anime character before.  Sadly, I am no longer in middle school, so this is really embarrassing.  

My ankles are killing me right now.  Hopefully I won't be in too much pain tomorrow.  Damn, weitao really gave us a toned down version on facebook -_-  oooo I just remembered I have half a subway sub in the fridge.  Scooooore.  Time to go pig out."

"event","i'm back at uva.  it's sad that one of my desks is covered in food, ramen, drinks, cereal, etc., and the other desk, which is SUPPOSED to be covered in books, is...not.  mainly because i haven't gone book shopping yet...unpacking took surprisingly little time, so now i'm just relaxing and thinking of either showering or napping.

no one's here...i'm sad.  it's just me and martine.  weitao and jason went to the gym.  i should work out.  aaaaagh.

haha and this mouse is likewise ridiculous."

"event","I fell down the stairs today.  I've gotta say, it wasn't one of my more intelligent moments.  I blame it on my brother.  If I didn't have to get up so early to take him to school it wouldn't have happened.  So now I'm nursing a bruised foot while he's off frolicking at Busch Gardens.  Life is sooo not fair.

Two days of packing and cleaning coming right up.  I guess I should be excited that I'm going back to Charlottesville but really I'm just blah.  Sajal convinced me to take biochem this coming year instead of pchem, and I guess it fits in my schedule a lot better, although I'm still rather worried about somehow fitting in public speaking???  It's such a weird requirement for pharmacy.  I guess I could talk to Martine about what she's doing, since I think she's also doing pharmacy.  AGHHHH.  I have to motivate myself.  If I'm not even close to motivated at the beginning of summer session, what am I gonna be like at the END?  My summer's gonna be so boring.  But I guess if I manage to make money then it will all be better :D"

"event","So...I was settling in to do my nightly wushu routine, and then out of the blue Angela calls and says that she's outside my house.  Taking a walk, of all things haha.  so since i haven't seen her in, what, half a year at least, i go outside, and we walk around my neighborhood for about half an hour.  angela hasn't changed.  still smart, still pretty, still the ditzy blonde   :P  she said that she'll visit uva this summer, definitely looking forward to the party scene haha.  that's angela for you.  it'll be fun to see her though, especially since she's the last one of the little chinese foursome to graduate.  i think we're all gonna have a lot more fun now that we won't have to go to the chinese cult parties; that's for our younger siblings to suffer through.  i mean, we did it, they can too, right?  haha.

i'm getting ready to move into the apartment this coming monday.  i found out the next pcat that i could possibly take is in october, right during family weekend, so there's really no rush for me to study hardcore over the summer.  i mean i'll do it anyway, especially since i won't have time during the school year, but this summer i definitely need to get a job.  so first order of business, settle in to do the bio lab thing, then find out how to become a pharmacy tech or something else.  i just don't want to spend my time doing nothing.  wushu training will also be a priority, since the afc is air conditioned (THANK YOUUUU), and mimi has kindly informed me that i can't do wushu in the apartment.  haha i'm not sure if that's because she doesn't want to hear me crashing around or if she thinks i'm gonna injure myself.  both of which would be the case.  but AT ANY RATE, i'm gonna take both bio labs, get a job, find out about pharmacy tech stuff/fall chem research, study for the pcat, and TRAIN WUSHU.  not bad for a two month plan :P

if anyone's gonna be in cville, come visit me!"

"event","so i had the opportunity to reread some of my past entries, and i was damn obnoxious.  and as tommy has so kindly informed me, i cursed a lot in high school.  but only in livejournal, you've gotta understand.  now, i just do it out loud.  haha.

so, not exactly new, but at least it's clean now.  only two (soon to be three) entries!  yay.  i doubt you guys want to read my high school ranting anyway.  i talked wayyyy too much about school -_-"

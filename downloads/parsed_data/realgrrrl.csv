"event","&quot;Difficult ordinary happiness,&quot;
no one nowadays believes in you.
I shift, full-length on the blanket,
to fix the sun precisely

behind the pine tree's crest
so light spreads through the needles
alive as water just
where a snake has surfaced

unreal as water in green crystal.
Bad news is always arriving,
&quot;We're hiders, hiding from something bad,&quot;
sings the little boy.

Writing these words in the woods,
I feel like a traitor to my friends,
even to my enemies.
The common lot's to die

a stranger's death and lie
rouged in the coffin, in a dress
chosen by the funeral director.
Perhaps that's why we never

see clocks on public buildings anymore.
A fact no architect will mention.
We're hiders, hiding from something bad
most of the time.

Yet, and outrageously, something good
finds us, found me this morning
lying on a dusty blanket
among the burnt-out Indian pipes

and bursting-open lady's slippers.
My soul, my helicopter, whirred
distantly, by habit, over
the old pond with the half-drowned boat

toward which it always veers
for consolation: ego's Arcady;
leaving the body stuck
like a leaf against a screen.--

Happiness! how many times
I've stranded on that word,
at the edge of that pond; seen
as if through tears, the dragon-fly--

only to find it all 
going differently for once
this time: my soul wheeled back
and burst into my body.

Found! Ready or not.
If I move now, the sun
naked between the trees
will melt me as I lie.

"event","&quot;Soon after Hearn's death in 1904, his Japanese widow made a list of some of the things he had 'liked extremely.' It is a curious list, yet a revealing one:&nbsp;sunsets, the west, summer, the sea and swimming, banana trees, the Japanese cedar, Martinique, folk songs, <em>Kwaidan</em> (ghostly tales), beefsteak, insects, and lonely cemeteries. He also liked plum pudding, hot rooms, tobacco, primitive and naive people, and Herbert Spencer. A catalogue of the things he heartily disliked would be even longer. Mrs. Hearn named only a few: liars, abuse of the weak, Prince Albert coats, stiff shirts, and New York City. The list should be extended, for he very definitely disliked whole sections of Western civilization and, in particular, Western industrialism:&nbsp;noise, machinery, crowds, smoke and dust, hustlers, braggarts, and practically everyone with whom he was forced to have business relations. Hearn was shy, restless, opinionated, quick-tempered, loyal, and morbidly sensitive. He had no talent for adapting himself to uncongenial surroundings, and much of his life was spent in passionate rebellion against the obstacles and irritations that men of milder temperament learn to endure and eventually ignore. He died at fifty-four and left behind him a few loyal friends, a somewhat longer list of bitter enemies, and a dozen books of such quality as to assure him a permanent place in English literature.&quot;"

"event","So, lately I have been trying to fill the guilty pleasure reality television void in my life that has been left by the absence of Project Runway and America's Next Top Model. I have been giving the new season of Top Chef a test run because everybody seems to be really into it, but I have to say, I haven't been super into it so far. For one thing, unlike reality competitions based on clearly visual products such as photos and fashion designs, Top Chef is based on food. The contestants on Top Chef will describe something that sounds totally delicious and amazing and looks great, but then the judges will totally bitch them out. I guess in theory this should be kind of fun because it's harder to predict who will be in the bottom at the end, but it is mostly frustrating to me because I have no way of knowing who was best and worst in my own opinion without actually tasting the food. I like to root for a team based on both personality and actual skill, which I can't really do with Top Chef. I like Hell's Kitchen a lot, but that's because instead of being focused on the food primarily, I feel like that show is mainly about who can work the best in a commercial restaurant kitchen, which is more obvious by just watching the people and hearing the interviews. Plus, Hell's Kitchen has inherent entertainment value in it's trashiness and purposeful ridiculousness of many of the contestants. I also like Iron Chef, which has a similar problem to Top Chef with not being able to taste the food, but I guess I feel like that show has more inherent entertainment value too in the format of it. I also tried a couple episodes of Stylista to see if that was any good, but then I decided I have enough bitchy, immature, special snowflake twenty-somethings in my actual life to enrage me without having to watch it on TV. So yeah, I have the following questions:

1) Do any of you Top Chef fans want to defend why I should stick it out and keep watching?
 2) Do you guys have any other favorite reality shows I should check out?"

"event","For the record, I just want to say, I am very upset about Proposition 8 passing and I would never defend the actions of the LDS Church in contributing to this travesty of justice. However, pointing the finger and making some pretty outrageous statements about minority ethnic and religious groups because of it's failure seems massively problematic to me. We have every right to be howling mad at the individuals who voted affirmatively on Prop 8; we do not have a right to turn around and maliciously target other minority groups, as a whole, for reprisals. Instead of dealing with the painful work of figuring out how the supporters of gay rights may have failed at reaching a majority of California voters and motivating more pro-gay rights voters out to the polls, or even better, doing the hard work of figuring out how to regroup and try to make positive progress on other fronts of the gay rights movement in California, I am watching people angrily demand the boycott of an entire state and smear people of color as homophobic. Screaming epithets at people as they attend church with their families is not going to win anyone over to your cause, particularly not the individuals within those churches who are often much, much more open-minded than their religious leaders. Why are we so quick to target other minority groups for attack instead of attacking that larger coalition of many Christian groups that is the majority in this country and that is apparently so full of bigoted homophobes? Why don't we focus our efforts on the leaders of anti-gay Christian churches, instead of making blanket statements about their membership? And why are we so hesitant to stop pointing fingers and start trying to reach toward the values we share?"

"event","So, I started a blog dedicated to reviewing all the movies I see and my friends are writing reviews for it too. I figure since I already watch one or two movies every week, this will be a great way to get me to write more consistently and be more thoughtful about the movies I see. It's nice because I don't have to work so hard to think of something to write about and writing reviews is a uniquely difficult, creative non-fiction type genre. It is amazing how clumsy I feel trying to describe the things I like or don't like in various movies. I'd like to develop more of a distinctive style and voice in the reviews than I have right now and make them a little more meditative. So far, they have been pretty academic and dry, but I think they will get better as I keep doing it. Anyway, here's the link: <a href=""http://cinerarium.wordpress.com"">http://cinerarium.wordpress.com</a>&nbsp; I will probably also go through some of my back posts about movies from this journal and add them onto the new blog in the next few days, so be forewarned you may see some older stuff I've written too."

"event","Can I just lay some stuff down right now? If you are in your twenties, odds are you: 

a) have not figured out your life path, no matter how much you feel like you've matured in the last few years or whatever 
b) are working at a shitty job or do not even have a job
c) want to be some kind of artist/writer/film maker/world savior, but in actuality you are very far from having accomplished those goals 
d) are not an expert at anything, in fact you are probably not very knowledgeable about most things in life 
e) are not really an adult who always makes the right choices, on the contrary you probably make mistakes all the time. 

Given that all of these things are generally true, at least of the people I know in my age bracket, can people stop falling all over themselves to brag about how smart, interesting, wise, mature, special, successful, savvy they are ALL&nbsp;THE&nbsp;GODDAMN&nbsp;TIME? I feel like there is a constant arms race being waged where all the twenty year olds I know constantly feel the need to talk about how they have figured it all out! How their lives are the coolest lives on the entire planet! How they REALLY&nbsp;do know what they want and what is best and they are constantly taking the world by storm! BY&nbsp;STORM!!!! 

Here is the deal, we are all really young and inexperienced with life. We have grown and changed through the last few years, but we still don't really know what the fuck we're doing. The amount of stuff I do not know and have completely no clue about astounds me on a regular basis and honestly, that is not a bad thing to be aware of! It means that all of us have a ton of growth left to do and personally, I feel like the less I delude myself into thinking I have it all figured out, the more chances I give myself to make the mistakes I need to in order to figure out what the right choices are. I really don't understand why this is not the common tone of conversation amongst people of our generation, as opposed what it actually is, which is so much more constantly frustrating.

We have not reached the tipping point of adulthood and are suddenly fully-formed people with all of our shit magically together, you know? Not one single person in our age bracket really has it all figured out. Really! I swear to God! You really haven't figured it out no matter how much you hype yourself up over and over! Also, you really are not the most unique and fascinating individual who has ever breathed! I'm not saying people of our generation aren't creative or don't have interesting things to contribute, but like, that truth does not negate the fact that most of us still have so much to understand before we will actually be to a point where our self-expression starts to become MORE than self-expression, i.e. as meaningful and important to OTHER people as it obviously is to YOU. 

Why why why can't people stop competing with each other all the time in this insane, passive aggressive way? Why don't they realize that the more they brag about themselves the more they come off as extremely naive, totally not self-aware, extremely self-centered and egotistical, and also, perhaps most importantly, very insecure? Why do people have to be so goddamn PUSHY about their stupid half-baked identities and half-formed lives ALL&nbsp;THE&nbsp;TIME?! I am fucking tired of it people! Like, wasn't doing this all the time for a solid block of four years during college enough time to get this ridiculousness out of your system? Can't we all just calm down, admit we are still at the beginning of a very long journey, and just fucking support each other while we figure it out? Why do so many people my age feel the need to assert their identities in such a relentless, maddening way? Personally, in my mind, and I am totally not lying about this I am NOT competing with anyone. I am trying to figure out what the best choices are for me, as an individual person. I do my best to respect other people's choices. I&nbsp;do not assume that I know what the best choices are for them, in their own lives, and I do not feel a need to judge them by any standard other than that they seem to be doing what they need to for themselves. Why is it so hard for other people our age to just let each other make those choices without this weird tone of one-upmanship in the interaction? 

Newsflash: bragging about how &quot;insert hipster adjective here&quot; your life is, is not different from the &quot;keeping up with the Joneses&quot; mentality from our parents' generation. NOT. DIFFERENT. Just different standards of measurement leading into a singularly fucked up attitude to live your life by and to judge other people by. I realize I am not a paragon of non-judgmentalness, but I really feel like people are taking this shit to a level that is really disturbing to me. So many people I know seem to do this bragging thing all the time, especially on the internet and especially in a context where it's supposedly just them talking about their lives in a neutral way, but in reality it is completely transparent that their blog is just one more way for them to show off how bad ass they are. I&nbsp;GIVE&nbsp;UP OK? You win at coolness points, ok? Can we drop the bullshit now?&nbsp;"

"event","So, lately I've been trying to write an lj entry and failing, mostly because I have been pretty depressed and I can never write when I'm depressed. Today was a better day though and this week I started a book called <u>Approaching Eye Level</u> by Vivian Gornick, which has been strikingly on point with how I've been thinking and feeling lately. The first chapter is all about NYC and what it's like to live here. I really like it and agree with it to a certain extent, but also feel like the comfort she gets from the vibrancy of strangers hasn't really been able to lift my spirits much lately. The weird irony for me living in New York City is that I am almost always doing something interesting or having a good time and I almost always feel a vague dissatisfaction with who I am and a hopelessness about my future that can become absolutely overwhelming. It is always these two things side by side, loving the city, constantly enjoying being here hand in hand with vague anger, usually directed at myself, and this numbing pessimism that seems to be practically seeping into my bones. My internal life is an overheated, filthy, rodent-infested subway tunnel where the train never comes, my actual life on a daily basis is the brilliance of animated city streets, delicious food, wonderful experiences happening all the time above ground. I feel very much at a loss. Regardless, I wanted to post some excerpts of Gornick's essay, it gives a good flavor for how things are here:<br /><br /><lj-cut>&quot;At Thirty-eighth Street two men were leaning against a building one afternoon in July. They were both bald, both had cigars in their mouths, and each one had a small dog attached to a leash. In the glare of noise, heat, dust, and confusion, the dogs barked nonstop. Both men looked balefully at their animals. &quot;Yap, yap, stop yapping already,&quot; one man said angrily. &quot;Yap, yap, keep on yapping,&quot; the other said softly. I burst out laughing. The men looked up at me, and grinned. Satisfaction spread itself across each face. They had performed and I had received. My laughter had given shape to an exchange that would otherwise have evaporated in the chaos. The glare felt less threatening. I realized how often the street achieves composition for me: the flash of experience I extract again and again from the endless stream of event. The street does for me what I cannot do for myself. On the street nobody watches, everyone performs . . . <br /><br />At other times--when no one is around and no one is available--I stare out the window, thinking, What a fool you are to glamorize life in the city. Loneliness engulfs me like dry heat. It is New York loneliness, hot with shame, a loneliness that tells you you're a fool and a loser. Everyone else is feasting, you alone cannot gain a seat at the banquet. I look down at the street. I see that mine is a workhorse life. As long as I remain in harness I am able to put one foot in front of the other without losing step, but if anything unbalances me I feel again the weight of circumstance hanging from my neck, a millstone beneath which I have taught myself to walk upright. <br /><br />The day is brilliant: asphalt glimmers, people knife through the crowd, buildings look cut against a rare blue sky. The sidewalk is mobbed, the sound of traffic deafening. I walk slowly, and people hit against me. Within a mile my pace quickens, my eyes relax, my ears clear out. Here and there, a face, a body, a gesture separates itself from the endlessly advancing crowd, attracts my reviving attention. I begin to hear the city, and feel its presence. Two men in their twenties, thing and well dressed, brush past me, one saying rapidly to the other, &quot;You gotta give her credit. She made herself out of nothing. And I mean nothing.&quot;&nbsp;I laugh and lose my rhythm. Excuse me, my fault, beg your pardon. . . . A couple appears in the crowd, dark, attractive, middle-aged. As they come abreast of me the man is saying to the woman, &quot;It's always my problem. It's never your problem.&quot; Cars honk, trucks screech, lights change. Sidewalk vendors hawk food, clothing, jewelry. A man standing beside a folding table covered with gold and silver watches speaks quietly into the air. &quot;It's a steal, ladies and gentlemen,&quot; he says. &quot;A real steal.&quot; Another couple is coming toward me, this time an odd on. The woman is black, a dwarf, around forty years old. The man is Hispanic, a boy, twelve or fourteen. She looks straight ahead as she walks, he dances along beside her. As they pass she says in the voice of a Montessori mother, &quot;It doesn't matter what he thinks. It only matters what you think.&quot;<br /><br />My shoulders straighten, my stride lengthens. The misery in my chest begins to dissolve out. The city is opening itself to me. I feel myself enfolded in the embrace of the crowded street, its heedless expressiveness the only invitation I need to not feel shut out . . . <br /><br />New York friendship is an education in the struggle between devotion to the melancholy and attraction to the expressive. I had thought it would be different in friendship than it general is in marriage: attaining to a higher level of equilibrium somehow. But how foolish to have thought that. We are all formerly married, are we not. Most of us spend our lives fighting an inner battle that is never won, in a war concluded only by death. In each life, however, one element or the other has the edge. The city reels beneath the impact of this dynamic. Why exactly it's hard to say.<br /><br />I put the telephone receiver back in its cradle. I close the apartment door. In thirty seconds I'm on the street. Thank God for the street! Those of us who crave the expressive but can't shake off the melancholy walk the street. The pavements of New York are filled with people escaping the prison sentence of personal history into the promise of an open destiny.&quot;</lj-cut><br /><br /><br />"

Toklas by Janet Malcolm and liked this description of Gertrude by one of her friends:<br /><br />""Gertrude Stein was prodigious. Pounds and pounds and pounds piled up on her skeleton--not the billowing kind, but massive heavy fat. She wore some covering of corduroy or velvet and her crinkly hair was brushed back and twisted up high behind her jolly, intelligent face . . . When she got up she frankly used to pull her clothes off from where they stuck to her great legs. Yet with all this she was not at all repulsive. On the contrary she was positively, richly attractive in her grand <i>ampleur</i>. She always seemed to like her own fat anyway and that usually helps other people to accept it. She had none of the funny embarrassments Anglo-Saxons have about flesh. She gloried in hers . . .&nbsp; Gertrude loved beef and I used to like to see her sit down in front of five pounds of rare meat three inches thick and with strong wrists wielding knife and fork, finish it with gusto, while Alice ate a little slice daintily, like a cat."" <br /><br />What a hottie."

"event","&nbsp;So, since I'm single now, maybe I will post on my lj more often? I would kind of like to post a daily NYC observation of some kind. Here's the first one, which is delightful (also x-posted to plans):

Today as I stepped out of my apartment and walked to the subway, I was overwhelmed by the extremely distinctive scent of menstrual blood for a solid block. NYC smells like urine and rotting trash a lot, but menstrual blood is a new one.&nbsp;

Melodee points out that maybe I was just smelling regular blood. Which raises the question, does menstrual blood smell differently than real blood? Is the reason you can smell menstrual blood just that there happens to be a lot of it and you normally wouldn't have that much hanging around? I also wonder, like, does other people's blood smell differently?"

"event","<p>I just finished reading <u>The Invisible Man</u> for the first time and it made me wish I could talk to people about it. I feel like I read it way too fast. I feel like it's the kind of book where you should read a chapter, then just think about it for a couple weeks before reading the next one. I may have talked about this before, but one of the best things about living in New York is having long chunks of time to read on the subway and during my one hour long paid lunch breaks. When I get home from work, I'm usually inclined to watch tv or a movie instead of reading so it's nice to be in a situation where all I can do is read at least a couple times a day. <br /><br />Last night I watched a really good documentary called <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0342180/"">A Certain&nbsp; Kind of Death</a>&nbsp;about what happens to people who die with no next of kin. It goes through all the various steps of the process that the Coroner's Office goes through, picking up the body, examining the personal effects for clues to any&nbsp;family or friends, cleaning out their living space, auctioning off their belongings,&nbsp;cremating the bodies, and&nbsp;burying them in a common grave&nbsp;for 1600 people per year who die this way. No names are listed on the grave, just a date for&nbsp;the year they all died.&nbsp;The ashes are all put into the grave together, they don't even have&nbsp;separate boxes. The movie was very well-directed with no soundtrack and no speculation from the various&nbsp;county employees who do this&nbsp;surreal job.&nbsp;There are just a lot of carefully framed shots of people going about their work which has become routinized,&nbsp;despite how emotionally-charged&nbsp;these kinds of deaths&nbsp;are. I like that the directors used this silent approach without&nbsp;a narrator or interviews with the employees, but I imagine it would be fascinating to hear their perspectives on the work they do. I've often wondered how any job like this, where you deal with death on a regular basis, must&nbsp;change your outlook on&nbsp;death and life. How do people cope with that experience? It seems like the sort of thing you either have to accept&nbsp;on a deep, internal level or de-personalize and distance yourself from.&nbsp;It seems like it would bring the schism between life and death into such sharp, shocking relief.<br /><br />I also watched a similarly quiet, minimalistic documentary last week called <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436457/"">The Joy of Life</a>. I really recommend that one as well. The premise of the documentary is that&nbsp;the entire movie is just&nbsp;long shots of different places around San Francisco with a&nbsp;continuous&nbsp;monologue narration by a single character who&nbsp;starts out talking about her lesbian love affairs and ends with an extended&nbsp;exploration of the&nbsp;history of suicides on the Golden Gate Bridge. It is a beautifully understated and human&nbsp;movie that I think is going to linger with me for some&nbsp;time. So few movies are successful at&nbsp;pushing through to your interior as you&nbsp;watch them, but this movie really accomplishes it. It made me think&nbsp;about my relationships and think about the melancholy,&nbsp;roaming, unsettled quality you have sometimes when you're&nbsp;alone and unattached. How it is sad and scary, but also kind of pleasant&nbsp;to not know who you will ever find to love you.&nbsp;The not-knowing means hope, means&nbsp;your possibilities are open. Then again there's that edge to it, to tie into the other movie I watched recently,&nbsp;the sense that maybe you will die alone.&nbsp;I think this relates to one of the big differences between being in a relationship and being&nbsp;single.&nbsp;When you are single&nbsp;you aren't tied to a singular person, a singular unit. Instead, you&nbsp;notice&nbsp;your relationship&nbsp;to the place you live in, your un-relationships with the strangers you see on the street every day. You become really conscious of&nbsp;your inner landscapes and how different they often are from the ones outside yourself, how hard it can be to create a bridge between yourself and the world. Everybody is separate, but connected and your sense of intimacy expands to the unknown. Your outlook on other people feels a little more objective.&nbsp;That kind of silence and yes, invisibility, can be really interesting to experience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"

"event","&nbsp;Friday! I am surprisingly awake for once! All week I have been coming home and falling asleep on the couch while reading or watching television. And I haven't even really been staying up late! What is happening? Even though I've been waking up approximately only an hour earlier than I did for my last job and even though I've been going to sleep approximately an hour earlier too, getting through the day is SO MUCH HARDER. Atleast in the morning all I have to do is herd my way onto the subway in a stupor, instead of driving very fast and scary on the highway like I used to. No more belting out Patsy Cline at top volume to and from work, but three solid hours of reading per day if I take my one hour commute each way and lunch. Living in New York City involves a lot of these sorts of trade-offs which extend to pretty much everything. Maybe I should make an official list:

More interesting, awesome bands play, BUT concerts are more crowded, more expensive, often sell&nbsp;out, and venues are larger so it's harder to see

Movies come out first here, there are semi-regular vintage showings, video stores fucking ROCK, BUT&nbsp;movies are much more expensive and it's more difficult&nbsp;to figure out what is playing/decide what to see

Incredibly diverse selection of&nbsp;excellent food, BUT restaurants are often tiny tiny, crowded, and&nbsp;can sometimes have a weird vibe

Awesome selection of&nbsp;cultural events and museums, BUT I'm much less motivated to create my own art and writing

Incredibly diverse general population, BUT front row seats to the effects of&nbsp;racism/classism&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Stores are&nbsp;open much later and they are everywhere, BUT many stores have weird/limited selection so it can be&nbsp;hard&nbsp;to&nbsp;find specific things sometimes and can involve&nbsp;going to a million different places. Plus, service is often much worse


These are all&nbsp;basically the trade-offs you&nbsp;would expect, aside from the other expected&nbsp;bad weather and lack of nature neither of which bothers me as much as I thought it would. They all seem totally worth it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

"event","So, the Grinnell blogging community I'm a part of has been having conversations about two pop sociology articles in the news lately, both a little aggravating in different ways:<br /><br />1) <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200803/single-marry"">http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200803/single-marry</a><br />&nbsp;<br />2) <a href=""http://www.city-journal.org/2008/18_1_single_young_men.html"">http://www.city-journal.org/2008/18_1_single_young_men.html</a><br /><br />Which then led to a long discussion about&nbsp;relationships between older men and younger women. Here is what I&nbsp;posted there. I thought it might be of interest:<br /><br />Disclaimer: I'm not attacking or passing judgement on anyone's specific relationship and I can readily imagine people of different ages creating respectful, mutual, and healthy relationships that meet both partners' needs. <br /><br />However, no one has yet mentioned how the lonely single mother in her 30s and 40s from the Gottlieb article is intimately linked to the childish, perpetually adolescent 20-something man. A large reason 20-something men can revel in immature, commitment and responsibility-free lives is the implicit knowledge that even if they spend an extra 10 years dicking around, when they're in their 30s and 40s there will be plenty of women in their 20s interested in them. And how many middle-aged women get divorced when their middle-aged husbands have affairs with much younger women? I think older women end up settling because most of their male peers don't have to, or are at least they judge the worth of their partner by different, often implicitly sexist criteria. <br /><br />It seems like it all lends itself quite handily to getting locked into the old tropes of patriarchy that say women should be valued based on their sexual attractiveness (code: youth and beauty) and men should be valued based on their provider potential (code: wealth and status). Dating an older man makes me uncomfortable partly because I feel uncomfortable indirectly punishing a woman older than me for making the kinds of career decisions that older men never seem to pay the price for, and the same kind of decisions I will probably make as well. And further, I don't want to encourage men my own age in continuing to make immature decisions and building a massive hook-up culture that seems both degrading and disheartening to many women my age. I don't think younger men will feel pressure to be more mature unless they're held accountable by women and I don't think women will stop being punished for being 1) ambitious in their careers and 2) not as conventionally pretty as they were in their 20s unless we hold together on this. This might be overthinking it somewhat, but I think it's a point worth making. <br /><br />And secondly, just in my own experience, the person I am more skeptical of in older male-younger female relationships is the man and I haven't heard that much discussed so far. I can easily imagine and understand all the various reasons a younger woman would be interested in an older man because I am right on board with all the comments criticizing 20-something men. But what has bothered me personally in the past about being approached by an older man is a question of what would lead someone who should presumably be more mature, at least in the sense of having a more established life path, to hit on a woman who is significantly younger? My mind immediately jumps to a few possibilities 1) physical attraction for me over their female peers 2) they are insecure and interested in having power in the relationship by virtue of their age and wealth 3) they are more immature than women who are their own age. Those aren't the only possibilities, but that's what occurs to me. <br /><br />I know that the maturity curve starts to taper off as we get older so that the difference between 35 and 45 is not nearly as pronounced as between 20 and 25, but I will say that I hope in 10 years I look back on where I am in my life now and feel like I have made some significant advancements in maturity and life status. I would be pretty disappointed in myself if that weren't true. I know that there is not a one-to-one correlation between age and maturity level and I know we all take different paths to where we end up in life, but it's hard to imagine a person I would consider my equal when I'm 35 being the exact same person who I would consider my equal right now at 23."

I've included the full data after the lj cut, if you're interested, but I'll summarize the differences here. In my new neighborhood, a full 33% did not graduate from high school and only 12.7% have a Bachelors Degree or higher, 29% live below the poverty line (25% earning less than $10,000 a year) with a median income of $25,000, and 86.6% of the population is Black, with Whites making up .9%. In my parents' neighborhood, only 5% of the population didn't graduate from high school with 47.5% holding Bachelors Degrees or higher, 6.2% live below the poverty line with a median income of $56,000, and 93.5% of the population is White, with Blacks making up .4%.

"event","I can't believe how long it's taken me to get on such good terms with my parents, especially now that I'm leaving, but I feel pretty lucky to have been born to people who care so much about me and who I like so much. 

I feel really grateful for all my friends and for all the people I've known who have taught me so many things. I'm still pretty far away from figuring everything out, but the people I know have made all the difference in getting me this far and I don't think I tell you guys nearly enough. 

And also, I'm really sorry for any hurtful things that I've done in the course of my stumbling along. 

A few years ago I was the type of person who hardly cried over anything, no crying over movies or sad songs or even sad times in my life. But the last couple years I've noticed that even relatively minor things will bring me to tears. For a while I kind of thought of this as a bad sign. I thought that it was supposed to work the other way around, that as you get older, you get tougher and thicker-skinned. But lately, I think that maybe it's easier for me to cry now because I have experienced a lot of good, good things in the last few years and I feel strong enough as a person to be able to admit and accept my feelings. 

Sometimes it's tempting for me to wonder if I purposefully choose unhappiness, if I choose to put myself in difficult situations and ask too many questions and want too many things. Sometimes I get really frustrated with my patterns. It's always been an awkward balance for me, being pretty strong willed and opinionated, but also constantly self-doubting. Lately I think I'm starting to realize how much all my doubts have been an important guiding force in my life even when they were unnecessary or threw me into dark times. And I guess my New Year's resolution this year, which is pretty similar to last year's actually, is that I want to forgive myself for these doubts that help me to take the risks and make the mistakes I need to."

Phew.<br /><br />* I hopefully found an apartment in New York- It's a two-floor duplex on the border of Prospect and Crown Heights in Brooklyn, with four bedrooms, one of which will be mine. The other three belong to a Grinnellian and two Bard grads. It is affordable and looks good in the pictures and I have my fingers crossed that it will be totally awesome. <br /><br />* I researched every feminist non-profit in New York- There are a lot. We'll see how this job hunt thing turns out. This is still the aspect I am the most nervous about.<br /><br />*I booked a plane ticket- <b>I officially move on January 4th.</b> If you want to hang out with me, we should do it before then (or after then if your name is Emily). Also, my cellphone is broken so if you call me, I probably won't know it. You can reach me at my parent's house or you can email me, if you want me to call you back. <br /><br />Sweet, sweet Jesus I have been busy and yet, I still feel a little overwhelmed by all of the stuff I need to get done in the next few weeks. It's a good overwhelmed though, more or less. It made me reflective to move out of my very first real apartment. I only lived there for seven months, the period between May and November, but for such a small little place and such a short span of time, I feel like I experienced a lot of things there. When I've had a spare moment to really think about it, it's amazing what a good life I've built for myself in Salt Lake City since college. I really enjoyed working for Big Brothers Big Sisters, I loved my little apartment with a view, I got along famously with all my friends here, and my parents have been an awesome support system for me.&nbsp; And it was good to have some time for solitude over the summer and to remember a lot of things about myself that I'd forgotten. There's part of me that wonders if it is a mistake to give up the comfort and happiness I have felt here. Especially when so much of what is motivating me is an eye toward challenging myself more deeply and a crazy idea of pursuing an old childhood dream. But then again, I wonder if I would have the courage to take a risk like this if I was coming from struggle instead of this nice, hard-won stability. <br /><br />I like the idea that I am making a choice in favor of the person I wanted to be and the kind of life I wanted when I was younger and those questions seemed more simple. I can imagine a lot of people move to New York City for the excitement of such a big place with all it's possibilities, and that's a part of why I like it, but in truth, one of my biggest hopes for this move to New York City is that I will be able to re-install contemplation as a daily feature in my life. I remember that when I was a kid I used to think that the defining characteristic of my personality was my need to observe and analyze everything. It was so important to me to be a person who notices things. And I mean, what better place to bring out those impulses than a place where there is an endless supply of people and places to observe? What better place to see all the big and small moving parts, the stuff of life? I know that life is always here in all it's complexity wherever I happen to be and I will probably be embarrassed to read this a few months from now, but it's a nice thought right now."

"event","<p>The last thing I should be doing right now is updating my livejournal, but here we are.&nbsp;<br /><br />A lot of unsettling dreams lately. A couple nights ago I dreamt of a&nbsp;solid&nbsp;wall of thorny hedges&nbsp;between me and where I was going. I tried to dig underneath&nbsp;the wall and at first made good progress, but then&nbsp;got tangled up&nbsp;in the roots that were all too close together for me to slide through. I don't know what this means, but it doesn't seem like a good thing.<br /><br />I am impatient for my job to end, and yet at the same time, it seems like&nbsp;the days are passing way too quickly lately.&nbsp;Things&nbsp;that need doing:<br /><br />* Clean&nbsp;apartment<br />* Wash dishes<br />* Visit Melodee in San Francisco for Thanksgiving<br />* Finish at least&nbsp;8 more grant applications<br />* Move out of apartment<br />* Figure out how I'm getting my stuff to New York<br />* Figure out when I'm actually, officially moving<br />* Get car inspected<br />* Sell car<br />* Get haircut<br />* Go Christmas shopping<br />* Find job<br />* Find New York City apartment<br />* MOVE TO NEW YORK<br />* Figure out my fucking&nbsp;life<br /><br />Man. I am<em> stressed. </em>Somehow though, all I usually&nbsp;end up doing when I get home from work is watching television and talking to my distracting dude person and&nbsp;wallowing in self-doubt. I am hoping that it will be easier than I think to finish stuff up once my job ends, but I'm also kind of worried. I feel overwhelmed and exhausted, just as I need to get my energy up and accomplish things and it makes me wonder if I'm sabotaging myself on purpose.&nbsp;Unfortunately, this move to&nbsp;New York City has started to symbolize&nbsp;becoming a real grown up adult person. On a rational level, I know that I already have the trappings of adulthood in Salt Lake; I have an apartment and a job and an independent life here. But it's easy to feel like all of this is just practice as long as my parents are 15 minutes away and I'm in such a familiar,&nbsp;small, and inexpensive city. I worry that without these safety nets my&nbsp;illusions of&nbsp;basic adulthood capacities&nbsp;are going to crumble&nbsp;into a million itty, bitty bits.&nbsp;<br /><br />I&nbsp;remember&nbsp;how unsteady and ill-equipped for life I felt just&nbsp;last January; something as simple as getting lost on the way to a doctor's appointment&nbsp;could make me feel like a hopeless failure. Lately, every little chore I put off feels like proof of my incompetence and&nbsp;the more incompetent I feel, the more I put things off. AUGH. When I'm being reasonable, I know that&nbsp;I've made a lot of mature decisions for my life in the last year. I know that I'm much more mentally healthy and capable these days. I know that&nbsp;Salt Lake&nbsp;and my amazing, supportive parents will always be here for me if I'm not happy in New York. And my happiness matters more than whether I'm some big city rock star.&nbsp;All&nbsp;I'm hoping for in&nbsp;New York City&nbsp;is a job I feel&nbsp;excited about, a healthy relationship for the first time in my life, a couple good friendships,&nbsp;meeting interesting people once in a while, and going to museums, concerts, and movies in my spare time. I would be happy with these things. That doesn't seem totally impossible, does it? Not completely unreasonable, right? But&nbsp;nagging in the back of my mind I remember how difficult it was at Grinnell sometimes and&nbsp;how broken I felt near the end. It's been&nbsp;a lot of&nbsp;work building the happiness I have here, gaining confidence in myself again,&nbsp;and it's pretty scary to think of risking all of that on such a dramatic life change now.&nbsp;Am I really ready for all this?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"

"event","&nbsp;I had a good, thought-provoking weekend, even though I wasn't as productive as I would have liked. I saw a lot of the&nbsp;new political movies that are out right now, including <u>Lake of Fire</u>, <u>Into the Wild</u>, and <u>Lions&nbsp;for Lambs</u>. Although <u>Lake of Fire</u> is a documentary about abortion and <u>Into the Wild</u> is a fictionalized account of a renegade from society, pretty separated topics, it was interesting to me how the movies dealt with ambivalence in extremely different ways. Although I haven't read the non-fiction book <u>Into the Wild,</u> in talking to my friends who have read the book it seems like the best thing about the book is how Krakauer manages to walk a fine line in telling Chris McCandless' story. There are moments of insanity and immaturity in McCandless' journals, but there's also moments of wisdom and insight.&nbsp;These qualities are&nbsp; in truth, hopelessly interlocked with one another during McCandless' journey, just like they're mixed up in most real human beings. It was odd how little courage the movie had in its convictions concerning this ambivalence and just in general, how difficult it is for narratives to acknowledge the constant paradoxes that seem to be a defining characteristic of life. While&nbsp;the movie&nbsp;is not a totally sympathetic account of McCandless,&nbsp;it does&nbsp;remove the analytical frame of the book and crafts a narrative&nbsp;that&nbsp;comes up with easy answers&nbsp;about the ultimate&nbsp;importance of humanity and forgiveness instead of letting the audience sit with the&nbsp;geuinely unsolvable&nbsp;questions I think McCandless' life raises about the relationship&nbsp;we&nbsp;each have with&nbsp;society, especially one as unhealthy as ours. Instead, the movie is a kind of&nbsp;allegorical&nbsp;shaping that gives the audience&nbsp;a ready-made&nbsp;interpretation, which makes me particularly uncomfortable when it is based on a real person who really died in the wilderness.&nbsp;<br /><br />On the other hand, even though <u>Lake of Fire</u> deals with one of the most controversial political issues of our time and the one&nbsp;I find the very&nbsp;most difficult to be even-handed about, the movie&nbsp;demonstrates a remarkable courage in presenting the full ambiguity.&nbsp;Certainly there is a&nbsp;degree of&nbsp;narrative shaping that's done in a documentary as with any film:&nbsp;there are choices&nbsp;made about who they interview, what images they show, what information they include, and what they leave out. But it really struck me how admirable and rare it is, to have a director who trusts their audience to be able to make their own judgements based on the material presented. At the end of the film, Kaye follows a woman through the process of getting an abortion, we get her background, why she's made this choice, see her going through the procedure, and also hear her talk about it afterwards. And I think there are few choices that provoke such intensely mixed feelings&nbsp;as the choice to have an abortion. The woman speaks for herself and&nbsp;her monologue after the abortion is&nbsp;fascinatingly, authentically&nbsp;human. She is&nbsp;clearly both tremendously relieved and tremendously sorrowful, a heartbreaking&nbsp;demonstration of how&nbsp;even when you make the right choice, there will always be doubt, there will always be regret, and there's no such thing as easy meaning.&nbsp;And I have to admit, there are few fictional books or movies that come anywhere close&nbsp;to that punched-in-the-gut feeling you get when you see and hear someone tell their own real story because so few fictionalized accounts get that complexity right. It makes me wonder how much of the writing process is motivated by the need to control that complexity,&nbsp;to streamline the chaos we live in, and how much of that is a disservice to the full beauty and ugliness of our humanity.&nbsp;"

"event","&nbsp;<img height=""300"" alt="""" width=""200"" src=""http://www.offrampbums.com/kucinich.jpg"" /><br /><br />Can I just say,&nbsp;even though&nbsp;Dennis Kucinich is probably the most liberal of the current serious candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination in many ways, I really don't like him and never have. First of all, he has the most extreme anti-choice voting history of practically anyDemocrat in Congress.&nbsp;Most serious of all in my mind, he voted&nbsp;against UNFPA family planning funding. Although he has now supposedly changed his stance to pro-choice, I can't help but be extremely suspicious of a candidate who voted against this incredibly necessary funding. The denial of this funding has left millions of the poorest people in the world without adequate contraceptive protection against AIDS, not to mention worsening the desperate situation so many women around the world&nbsp;were already&nbsp;in because they do not have access to the family planning health care they so badly need. I am really tired of this aspect of Kucinich's voting&nbsp;record being glossed over as though it shouldn't raise serious concerns about the choices he would make as president. At the very least, it demonstrates to me that protecting Roe&nbsp;v. Wade is not a high priority for him and probably something he feels somewhat conflicted about.&nbsp;Secondly, although he is in his 60's he's married to a woman who is 29. To me, this is a warning sign that his sexist beliefs may run deeper than his anti-choice record. I am deeply suspicious of a 60 year old man who wouldn't want to marry someone who is his equal in maturity and life experience, but instead chose to marry a 29 year old ""babe"" with a tongue piercing."

"event","<p>&nbsp;Last night, I watched the Jim Jarmusch movie ""Night on Earth."" It stars early 90's, still-a-weirdo-tomboy Winona Ryder as a dirty, chain-smoking taxi driver. This role is preposterous, but she is charming anyway. Like many 10-year-old girls, I intensely identified with early era, spunky and sarcastic Winona Ryder. If I was given the chance to write and direct a movie at that age, I undoubtedly would have created ""Heathers"" (Yes, I would even have cast Christian Slater). She always played a rat-haired misfit, which was somehow believable despite the fact that she looks more like a French supermodel.&nbsp;<br /><br />But then I started to wonder about the 10-year-old girls these days and who they have to idolize. I realized that the kinds of roles Winona Ryder played in the early 90's are now analogous to the roles that Natalie Portman plays. Natalie Portman is similarly approachable, young-looking, and often plays unusual, yet relatable characters. I can't even tell you how much I fucking HATE Natalie Portman though. All I can think about when I watch her movies is how fake and annoying she is, while everyone else is charmed by her ""quirky charisma.""&nbsp;<br /><br />Thinking about this, I started to wonder what the real difference is. Is Winona Ryder actually just a better and smarter actress/human being? Is it because the current, hip version of off-beat attractiveness means being eccentric in a sweet, whimsical, indie way rather than in a flannel-wearing, mopey, Beetlejuice way? Were the late 80's, early 90's just better in every single way imaginable? Or is it because instead of being 10 and naive, I'm in my twenties and I actually know the Natalie Portmans of the world and they make my skin crawl? ""Reality Bites"" is pretty annoying to watch these days and don't get me started on ""Girl Interrupted."" I guess the answer is all of the above. Sometimes I feel like an old person.&nbsp; </p>"

"event","Firstly,&nbsp;oh my God, my life is going so well! YEAH!&nbsp;<br /><br />Secondly, so far autumn has meant the following things:<br /><br />1)&nbsp;One snow storm and several rain storms and being cold a lot. Curse you bad weather! &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />2) Wearing my grandpa's sweaters to work again, which I love. However, they are itchy and I can't tell which is the black one and which is the navy blue one&nbsp;in the morning, meaning that I am currently wearing black pants, shoes, and socks&nbsp;with a blue sweater, which I guess you are not supposed to do if you are a fashionable person according to my mother.<br />3) Writing a lot of run-on sentences.<br />4) Keeping cooped up in my messy little apartment instead of taking long walks and enjoying the trees changing colors&nbsp;like I'm supposed to.&nbsp;<br />5) Watching House, Kitchen Nightmares, and America's Next Top Model instead of reading books and being a cultured person like I'm supposed to.<br />6) Getting invited to two weddings! I guess I better take out my fancy dresses and shave for the first time in I don't even know how long. <br />7) Missing a bunch of concerts because I'm too lazy/cheap to go by myself. However I will remedy this soon: Deerhoof. Saturday. YES YES YES.<br />8) Totally slacking off in Kung Fu and feeling irritated/enraged when I&nbsp;do go.<br />9) Being so unbearably bored and unfocused&nbsp;at work it is ridiculous.<br />10) Going to the library several times a week returning books I didn't read and checking out more books that I probably won't read. At least I've been watching the movies I rent.&nbsp;<br />11) Saw this Vincent Price movie called <u>The Baron of Arizona</u>, which is wicked funny and culty and which I recommend to Andrew Cole. If only the state of Arizona was still a ""Barony.""&nbsp;Other movies seen: <u>She</u>, <u>The King of Kong</u>, and&nbsp;<u>Eastern Promises</u>. In reference to <u>Eastern Promises:<br /></u><br />Dear David Cronenberg,<br /><br />You are a very, very skilled director. You do an excellent job of creating tension in your films, in addition to&nbsp;some of the most intriguing, complex movies coming out these days. However, what is your deal with valorizing&nbsp;extremely violent, alpha masculinity?&nbsp;Are you just&nbsp;a bizarre and disturbing&nbsp;throwback to <u>Straw Dogs</u>&nbsp;Sam Peckinpah, literally the most offensive movie I have ever seen? I mean, <u>Eastern Promises</u> did not make me want to immediately vomit as much as <u>A History of Violence</u>.&nbsp;Still, the naked knife fighting scene? Like . . . it reminded me a lot of&nbsp;<u>Kill Bill</u> and how you could literally feel Quentin Tarantino reaching orgasm during Uma Thurman's girl-on-girl fight scenes, except not&nbsp;at all campy. More like WORSHIP THE MIGHTY PHALLUS. I mean, seriously? I admit that it&nbsp;was pretty&nbsp;bad ass and I guess I am a&nbsp;supporter of full frontal male nudity, but what is the fucking deal? Please watch Roman Polanski's <u>Knife in the Water</u> and try to&nbsp;be more like that, ok?<br /><br />With Concern,<br />VickyV&nbsp;<br /><br />"

"event","<p>""During my first years in Paris, beginning in 1924, I lived at night, going to bed at sunrise, getting up at sunset, wandering about the city from Montparnasse to Montmartre. And even though I had always ignored and even disliked photography before, I was inspired to become a photographer by my desire to translate all the things that enchanted me in the nocturnal Paris I was experiencing. So Paris de Nuit, published in 1933, was born . . . I spent several nights in the neighborhoods around the Bassin de la Villette with Jacques Prevert, where we reveled in the 'beauty of sinister things,' as he used to call the pleasure those deserted quays, those desolate streets, that district of outcasts, crawling with tarts, full of warehouses and docks, gave us.</p><br />More often, however, I wandered alone in unsavory, ominous areas where I wouldn't dare go today. Sometimes, impelled by an inexplicable desire, I would even enter some dilapidated house, climb to the top of its dark staircase, knock on a door and startle strangers awake, just to find out what unsuspected face Paris might show me from their window. This is how, once, around midnight, I got to photograph the street fair which had set up its merry-go-rounds, booths, its tiny circus in the Place d'Italie. My intrusion frightened the inhabitants as much as my purpose: in those days, no one had heard of night photography. But oddly enough, doors were almost always opened to me, and I never got shot at, as might have happened, for disturbing a nocturnal household. I was hauled off to the police station by the patrol squad on only three occasions. The police refused to believe that anyone might want to take pictures by the canal at three A.M., and were more inclined to think I have been dumping a body into the greenish water. To show any possible interrogators it could be done, I usually carried with me some photographs I had taken at night.<br /><br />Sometimes the inhabitants surprised me more than the view from their window could have. One winter's night, having spotted a seventh-story attic window in a decaying house across from the church of Saint Severin, I climbed the dark stairs, lit only by two small lamps. At the very top, I knocked on the last door. It swung open. A man and woman in nightgowns were standing in the middle of the small room, like the figures in Millet's Angelus. It was dark. Their somber, expressionless faces were lit by the faint reflection from the pink sky of Paris outside. 'What do you want?' the man asked, without turning toward me. 'I'd like to see Paris from your window. You'd be doing me a great favor.' 'I'm glad I can still do a favor for someone,' he replied. 'Go on, look . . . we don't know what it's like. We're both blind.' I left, ashamed, heartsick. Two blind people living there, in that poor attic room! One could enter a dwelling at random and discover the strange, the tragic.<br /><br />Just as night birds and nocturnal animals bring a forest to life when its daytime fauna fall silent and go to ground, so night in a large city brings out of its den an entire population that lives its life completely under cover of darkness. Some once-familiar figures in the army of night workers have disappeared: the repairers of the streetcar tracks, whose acetylene torches made fireworks, showers of violet sparks; the cesspool cleaners, who zealously pumped the septic tanks in the older neighborhoods; the porters and market gardeners, the agents, the butchers of La Villette, before Les Halles moved to Rungis.<br /><br />The real night people, however, live at night not out of necessity, but because they want to. They belong to the world of pleasure, of love, vice, crime, drugs. A secret, suspicious world, closed to the uninitiated. Go at random into one of those seemingly ordinary bars in the Montmartre, or into a dive in the Goutte-d'Or neighborhood. Nothing to show they are owned by clans of pimps, that they are often the scenes of bloody reckonings. Conversation ceases. The owner looks you over with an unfriendly glance. The clientele sizes you up: this intruder, this newcomer- is he an informer, a stool pigeon? Has he come in to bog the gig, to squeal? You may not be served, you may even be asked to leave, especially if you try to take pictures . . . And yet, drawn by the beauty of evil, the magic of the lower depths, having taken pictures for my 'voyage to the end of night' from the outside, I wanted to know what went on inside, behind the walls, behind the facades, in the wings: bars, dives, night clubs, one-night hotels, bordellos, opium dens. I was eager to penetrate this other world, this fringe world, the secret, sinister world of mobsters, outcasts, toughs, pimps, whores, addicts, inverts. Rightly or wrongly, I felt at the time that this underground world represented Paris at its least cosmopolitan, at its most alive, its most authentic, that in these colorful faces of its underworld there had been preserved, from age to age, almost without alteration, the folklore of its most recent past.<br /><br />The half-dressed girl strutting along the Rue des Lombards, picking up passers-by, murmurs the same 'Want to come with me?' as the streetwalkers murmured to the rakes in the fourteenth century. She walks the same sidewalks as they did, the same pavement, stands on the same corners. The pimps, hatching shady deals and keeping a businesslike eye on their stables of girls, play endless games of cards or dice in the same cafes, the same cheap restaurants, as did the rogues of long ago, the Coquillards with whom Francois Villon hung out, or the companions of that other shady ex-convict, Francois-Eugene Vidocq, who became the chief of police. <br /><br />Maybe my fascination with the underworld in those days was inspired by the infatuation with outcasts I had derived from some of my favorite writers: Stendhal, Merimee, and above all Dostoevsky, Nietzsche. Enthralled by outlaws living outside the conventions, the rules, they admired their pride, their strength, their courage, their disdain for death. 'Extraordinary men,' wrote Dostoevsky in The House of the Dead, 'perhaps the most richly endowed, the strongest of all our people . . . ' And let there be no mistake. The admiration expressed by the author of Crime and Punishment was not for revolutionary intellectuals or for political prisoners, but for real criminals: thieves, murderers, convicts-his own prison companions. These criminals cast out by society became his mentors, their doctrine of life- never written, but clear nonetheless- became his ideal. There was no pity in this. Dostoevsky consciously adopted the convicts' code: to live life according to one's own passions, to create one's own laws! Thus, more than a quarter of a century before Nietzsche, Raskolnikov had already removed himself 'beyond good and evil.'&nbsp; The author of the Brother's Karamazov admired these criminals so much that during his prison term he put up with the contempt with which they treated him. Was he not an outsider, a stool pigeon? 'How is it,' he wondered, 'that they seemed then, they still seem, right to have despised me and why is it that against my will I feel so weak, so insignificant, so- how terrible to say it- ordinary, compared to them?' For me too, or rather, for that other me of forty years ago, this infatuation for low places and shady young men was doubtless necessary. Could I otherwise have torn these few images from the strange Parisian nights of the thirties before they sank into nothingness? For me, fascination with a subject was always an indispensable stimulus.""<br /><br />--Brassai, The Secret Paris of the 30's"

"event","Another list of things: 

*&nbsp;Cheers to Becker winning the Primary! Awesome! 

* I successfully completed my Orange Belt test in Kung Fu yesterday. Sensei says I need to focus on my effort and bring out the inner chi of the snake. You know what I say? I need to kick more ass. 

*&nbsp;This weekend I attended two Global Film Initiative movies, in addition to seeing a Brazilian movie called House of Sand. House of Sand just came out on video and I really recommend it. Very surreal and an interesting parable on time, age, and being trapped.&nbsp; 

* I rented the DVD set of punk rockers being interviewed by Tom Snyder on the Tomorrow Show from the Library. He interviews Patti Smith and she's really cute and embarassed, but then talks real seriously about death being transcendental with that great Jersey accent of hers. He also interviews Joan Jett a little, although she's terrified and shy and painfully polite. But really, it's not her&nbsp;fault because Tom Snyder&nbsp;has to be the most awkward and bizarre talk show host of all time. I really don't get it at all. He's like the definition of a square. It's&nbsp;actually kind of reassuring to&nbsp;see rock stars being all quiet and tongue-tied&nbsp;because it shows that they really did need to express their full selves through music because they were too introverted to do it any other way. And Joan Jett&nbsp;also gets points because when she's asked if she's gonna sell out when she's&nbsp;successful and mainstream, she&nbsp;says,&nbsp;""Well a band of all girls will never be mainstream."" I also&nbsp;watched the Elvis Costello episode and I don't know what it is about him, but he just always seems like a total prick to me. &nbsp; 

* I'm going to New York City tonight. Plans thus far: see Patti Smith, go to the Brooklyn Museum to see Judy Chicago's Dinner Party, eat a Lobster Roll, hang out with Emily and see her hood. Did I mention seeing Patti Smith? Other possibilities include: Hang out with Vy Ho, other museums, jazz music, Greenwich Village, shopping, sit in on a law class, convert to Judaism.&nbsp;Figure out my future life plans? Decide to leave Salt Lake City? Hmph.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

"event","Ok so here is a quick and silly update for all my awesome friends who I find myself name-dropping all the time lately as though you are all famous rock stars (but aren't you?):<br /><br />* I've decided that the best way to motivate myself to clean my apartment is to play the B-52s at full blast and dance-clean instead of clean-cleaning. Do you guys have a favorite album to listen to whilst cleaning?&nbsp;I'm really glad that even though I am starting to be a grown-up now, music continues&nbsp;to make my whole life better.<br /><br />* White male scientist libertarians must go.<br /><br />* This weekend I went to Kinko's and made copies of almost all the drawings I have done in the last four years for the zine Jen and I are making. I actually really like how they look, even when the faces turn out a little distorted with the eyes too far apart or tilting at wrong angles because I think their ugliness makes them more interesting.&nbsp;Sometimes I think I should have been an artist person all along instead of a writer person because I'm always so much happier with how my drawings turn out than my poems.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />* I've been reading a lot of Joan Didion for the last few weeks because I got this massive collection of all her non-fiction stuff. There is a sort of detached, fundamental unhappiness about all of it that I recognize as extremely present in a lot of my own private writing.&nbsp;What is it about writer type people, always too engaged and estranged simultaneously? I saw this documentary about Bukowski a couple months ago and remembered that at the time I was reading <u>Women</u> I was really dismissive of his relentless bravado and detachment. But then there's this part in&nbsp;the documentary&nbsp;where he's reading a poem about a woman washing him in the shower and he starts weeping like a little kid.&nbsp;The interesting thing about all the writers I like best is that they often cut this tough, cold figure of themselves, but they're actually deeply affected, too affected,&nbsp;by everything around them.<br /><br />* I saw the new documentary about Iraq called <em>No End In Sight. </em>It suggests that the war with Iraq was masterminded and run by 3 or 4 top officials with no military or historical knowledge about anything. Watching footage of Rumsfeld shooting his mouth off is pretty chilling.&nbsp;After all this time studying oppression and power and systems of control, I still don't understand how&nbsp;people actually commit atrocities, how little we understand the scope of our actions, how&nbsp;the actions of a startlingly small amount of people can destroy the lives of&nbsp;hundreds of thousands. Is it a symptom of my privilege that I&nbsp;am still so bewildered by it?&nbsp;The old cliche about detectives is that they have to take on the mind of the&nbsp;culprit to&nbsp;catch them. If I could&nbsp;better reach that&nbsp;cruel, animal part of myself, would I be a better fighter?&nbsp;<br /><br />*&nbsp;One of my best friends here is moving to Washington on&nbsp;Friday and I'm really happy for her. I am going to miss&nbsp;her a lot though. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />* On the lighter side, two puns I made up recently (especially for Everly):<br /><br />Q: What do you call a fanatic Mitt Romney supporter?<br />A: A Mittiot.&nbsp;<br /><br />Q: What do you call a rapper from Denmark?<br />A: A DenMarky Mark<br /><br />* Last but not least, I am dating a new boy. I&nbsp;am&nbsp;too superstitious to talk about it, but&nbsp;it's&nbsp;going&nbsp;really well so far. Ai yi yi. &nbsp;<br />"

"event","<p>Quoth some douchebag, in the midst of an argument in which said douchebag argues that women are immature for preferring gynecological care from a female. Bolding&nbsp;mine:<br /><br />""What really gets me is the idea of 'male privilege.' Prior to industrialization, most men were farmers, fishermen, and at best shop-workers. I do not see how privilege fits into that in any way. THOSE MEN HAD NO POWER . . . I am not saying that large numbers of women were not oppressed in the private sphere, but that t<strong>hose forms of oppression were, in some way,</strong> <strong>equivalent to those of men</strong>. No one had power. And frankly, <strong>thank God (?) that MEN created the bicycle, vacuum cleaner, washing machine, and so on that reduced the economic value of ""women's work"", allowing women to pursue other activities </strong>. . .&nbsp;What I am saying contradicts a standard feminist narrative -- that men were also oppressed, if less oppressed than women; that men worked very hard and risked their lives to provide for their wives and families; and that <strong>it was men's hard work and science that provided the economic conditions for women's liberation</strong>. . . What gets me is that <strong>I <i>AM</i> a feminist</strong>!&nbsp;First-wave feminism -- no question (<em>!!!!</em>).<em> </em>Second-wave (right to work, culturally equal treatment) -- sure. Third-wave (respecting distinctively feminine characteristics) -- <strong>I couldn't imagine a world without women</strong>, <strong>without their charms</strong>, <strong>without their caring and emotional approach to things</strong> (forgive the stereotype).""&nbsp;<br /><br />WOW. </p>"

I mean, for me especially, I felt like this is the only thing I have, and if I can stick my neck out and go for the issues and go through my life as it is, the least I can have is my creativity. And I think that's probably the stupidest thing about it.""<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/44529-mia-confronts-the-haters"">http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/44529-mia-confronts-the-haters</a><br /><br />P.S. Many of you may not realize it, but Pitchfork is consistently really fucking sexist, both in the way they consistently rate female artists lower than males, the way they word their stupid ass reviews, and the way they write their news items about them. Don't believe me (and MIA)? For example, let's check out the review of the latest Laura Veirs cd: <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/42270-saltbreakers"">http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/42270-saltbreakers</a>&nbsp;This asshole gives it a fucking <strong>4.7</strong>! I think Laura Veirs is AT LEAST as talented as male indie darlings Sufjan Stevens and Devendra Banhart and certainly is an amazing artist in her own right. Her music is incredibly well-written, consistently interesting and unique and well-done.&nbsp;The way Pitchfork has reacted to her, as they react to all female artists,&nbsp;is blatantly sexist. There is NO WAY that a male arist of her caliber would be judged in such harsh terms. Male singer-songwriters are groundbreaking and complex while female singer-songwriters are labeled&nbsp;as little more than&nbsp;""weak imitations"" and never given the chance to be evaluated and listened to on their own terms. Meanwhile, check out her metacritic rating: <a href=""http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/veirslaura/saltbreakers"">http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/veirslaura/saltbreakers</a>&nbsp;The Onion gave Saltbreakers a <strong>9.1. </strong>Hmmmm. Who do you trust?&nbsp;<br /></p>"

"event","So, I've been single for a few months and I've given a good amount of thought to what I want the next person I date to be like. Today I&nbsp;finally realized&nbsp;the person who best encapsulates all of the things I am looking for:&nbsp;<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://weeklywire.com/ww/11-24-97/austin_screens_scanlines-1.gif "" /><br /><br />Ok. So we all already know that Vincent Price is a GOD of cult cinema. We already know that&nbsp;he was&nbsp;handsome, yet sinister in a completely&nbsp;hilarious way.&nbsp;But he was all that and SO MUCH MORE.<br /><br />He&nbsp;graduated from Yale with a degree in&nbsp;art history, wrote a syndicated art column in the 60s, and founded the&nbsp;Vincent Price Gallery.<br />He was a gourmet chef and wrote several cookbooks, including something called, ""A Treasury of Great Recipes."" <br />He would often attend showings of his films in costumes and would&nbsp;often play pranks on movie-goers.<br />He was one of the most active liberal Democrats in Hollywood.&nbsp;<br />He won $32,000 in an appearance on the game show ""$64,000 Question."" <br />He was considered an eccentric and often engaged in over-the-top theatrics while discussing his favorite subjects, cooking and poetry.&nbsp;<br />His ashes were scattered with his favorite gardening hat.<br />He was notoriously superstitious.<br /><br />Ok, let's review: interested in art, a fabulous cook, an awesome sense of humor, political, smart, eccentric, into poetry and gardening, notoriously superstitious, and a horror movie icon.&nbsp;Was&nbsp;this not the ideal man? Are there any Vincent Prices out there now? Anybody?"

"event","<tt>This is quintessentially Grinnellian. We're all such bitches.<br /><br />""Hi all. I just received a mailing from student affairs requesting, among <br />other things, that I avoid contributing to the waste problem at <br />Grinnell. I couldn't help thinking of the fact that many of the included <br />sheets of paper in said mailing were printed in enormous text and only <br />on one side. This mailing had seven sheets of paper, only two of which <br />were printed on both sides (one of those being an advert). Compared to <br />the alternative of sending an email, and assuming every student received <br />this mailing, we seem to have wasted seven sheets of paper for each of <br />around 1500 students and an envelope that compares to around two sheets <br />of paper. And this paper is not thin! That's around 13,500 unnecessary <br />sheets of fairly thick paper. Add to that the ink to print them, the <br />power to run the printers, the dyes for the colored paper, the bleach <br />and at least 65 cents of postage each...which pays for the <br />transportation of massive trucks using fossil fuels. <br />It just seems to me that a more appropriate approach to the problem of <br />waste and recycling is to not produce the material in the first place. <br />As great as recycling is, it is not very efficient at reclaiming these <br />kinds of resources."" </tt>"

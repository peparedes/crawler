"event","<p>Ok.... I don't care about THE VOICE. I don't like voting shows period because I think of them all like THE HUNGER GAMES now. And I'm too lazy to sit through the whole season and everybody hits a sour note in those ""Call this number for Sally and vote b54."" or whatever clips. I guess as the story goes Christina's Aguilera is one of the coaches/judges on this show (who's is thirsty) and has a fellow X Mickey Mouse Club member (who I believe is also very thirsty) Justin Timberland <<yes I called him that....supports this guy and is like puttin his head inside of his booty hole to win because they go way back like that. Christina I guess thinks he has an unfair advantage so she feels it necessary to hate on him constantly. Here was what I think.....                                  I think she sat on that thing and rode it and he didn't want it no moe'. I just saw where the dude covered 99 problems (and no it wasn't cool) his daughter and wife were in the audience and Xtina decided she wanted to preach about the derogatory content of the cover even though she's been rubbing her coochie and poopin her thang all over my tv screen since I was 8yrs old. The last time I saw this trick she was wrapped in spandex and pinching her nipples.....*sigh* America you have failed me... Yet again. But ya know...###YOLO!!!</p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/iphone/link"">LiveJournal app for iPhone</a>.</i></span></p>"

"event","<p>Education is important. Let me tell you guys about my college experiences. The first one was PCC. I got signed up with a friend took some addie and we went off to class. I think we walked onto campus with our coffee all jacked up and eventually she decided to go home. After about five minutes. Of course she never wanted to go back so I had no way of going to class. So I dropped out like the G that I am. The second experience I went to FullSail for a tour, met my advisor looked at living expenses and never came back to the campus. During my pregnancy with Andrew to quickly get a certificate in something I decided to go to Everest online for medical billing and coding. I made honors the first two semesters. Then I was told I needed to move out so I panicked and just stuck to my two jobs. Also I didn't really want to do it and the credits there were useless at a community college.....I have known this for a long time that I am a writer. I am supposed to be blogging making scripts or creating story lines for video games, something nerdy and interesting like that. Journalism or Creative writing is not like the health industry or Food. You do not need any type of certification to do it. Right now what I'm doing is what I want to have a degree in. Writing this blog. Giving you all who are reading this some type of news or entertainment with my awesome vocabulary. I've been doing a lot of reading this week, so much so that my eyes are on fire and this is what I have learned: I hate school. I hate talking about it, paying for it, enrollment, etc. It has been about five years since I took my tour at FullSail but out of sheer interest (and desperation because I have to start doing something) I went back to the website and gosh golly like every media entertainment school they have a journalism program and it's ONLINE. So of course I pooped my pants and went straight to student review and read as much as I could. The curriculum is awesome BUT it's a 24/7 sector (for those of you that have kids like myself cannot do dat campus thang) it's expensive as fuck, the job placement program apparently isn't good and did I mention it was expensive as fuck...and *drumroll please* it's nationally accredited. Like Everest. Now when a college says they are nationally accredited that sounds good right? NOOOO lol <<< I really did that. National means (in a way peoples like yallz and me can understand) is what your school teaches is pretty much the polar opposite of what you will find at any local CC or University. But if you have credits at a regional school they damn sure will take them so you will go to their school and make it rain Benjamins in the student loan office. My man is moving to FL towards the end of this year and I need to have what I want to do figured out before he gets here. He is a strong believer in going to a BAMF school (which has made me feel a little pressured and unsure about CC). The most badass one you can find so for a while I looked down on CC education or anything instate. The possibilities are endless and conversation is usually endless because well a degree in journalism is nothing. It would be more matter of fact if I wanted to be a nurse or a doctor or lawyer or something. Majority of the people that do what I want to do for a living have no education at all. And if they do (this is coming from their mouth) its useless. My friend Dorian had a BBM buddy that started by blogging about phones now he writes articles for this big tech site and moved to NY after the fact of his career takin off and his degree is useless, he is probably still paying on it now.  I asked a retired journalist of 50yrs what school I should attend and you know what he told me to do? ""Save your money and read some books."" so after being all up in FS I woke up this morning and I looked at CCs because I want somebody to tell me more about these books this white man told me I need to be reading. Their ratings are not high but every single one contains the core classes I would need to work towards my AA and so I can major in journalism. Also that AA can get me a better job for the time being. And if I hate one because I chose regional I can go to another school even a national *bingo!*....honestly I only wanted that MacBook Pro from FS out of the LaunchBox.  I'm gonna be smart and protect my bank account.

"event","<p>My aunt told me that serious relationships with people was like buying houses. They look really good on the outside and even during the walk through things still look badass but.....  you never really know the damage until you move in. You already got all excited and put a down payment on that bitch and now you stuck with that mortgage. It's cold as fuck up here y'all. In more ways than one. It was like 47degrees out and I was at Walmart and people were walking around with tank tops and shorts and those same people are probably catching pneumonia as I type. If I wash and go I'll catch a cold. There's so many more things I would like to blog about right now but I'll start with that. Right now I'm watching this lady drink nail polish and it's making me feel better about my life. </p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/iphone/link"">LiveJournal app for iPhone</a>.</i></span></p>"

That poor poor baby.

Reality television reminds me of meth induced psychosis.

Less than an hour ago I was at the Laundromat watching the Kardashians on vacation somewhere beautiful being miserable for no reason, and I guess Kim&#39;s pretend husband was there and he lacks any type of anything interesting that I would even consider half writing about so we&#39;ll move along to her brother.

Rob decided he was going to snap on his beloved sister and call her a whore because she probably is and is making money and he&#39;s not.
I personally think he&#39;s just jealous because Ray J didn&#39;t put his massive dinglehopper(not talking about a fork)&nbsp; in his koota - kitta and video tape it.

Currently I&#39;m waiting for the Chef to call/text/come over/anything.

I&#39;m going to turn back to the screen and loose more brain cells.

Most of the niggas I don' fuqed wit are wack so there wasn't any money paid ever because we didn't go on a date.

or they just bought alcohol when they came to my house.

OR.... they would pay for us to go somewhere one time so they could get into my pants and never took me out ever again.

Winter is the sexiest time of the year for me ladies.
It&#39;s when the bummy niggas come back because I keep them warm.
I&#39;m attempting to sift them out.

I met a Chef.

The Chef left earlier.... but before he did he brought me Wendy&#39;s and kissed me goodnight. (simply because I asked him not to cook)
I&#39;ll be seeing him tomorrow.

I don&#39;t know why I felt that since Negro Clash died on LJ that my blogging had to die with it.
Or since no one else was using theirs I had to stop using mine or make another one....kind of gay of me.
I guess I have to settle with this since my camera is a no go and I haven&#39;t maxed out the memory on my INSPIRON ....whatever computer so I can save and edit video....

Dear Drake,
Thank you for making music that inspired me to write about my life and publish it for everyone to read for the millionth time....you know....since it&#39;s obviously entertaining and has given me the strength to rightfully be s1q n pWn3 th3s n33wbz @ r00lingz0rz.
Take Care was wonderful....and so is that little jerry curl you were sporting in that NBA 2K12 commercial. It kind of reminds me of my Mom.

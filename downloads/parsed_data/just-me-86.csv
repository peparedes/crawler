I will no longer be writing entries under this username, but rather I am switching to my other one, sweetchild32711. I like that username better so I decidd to switch so as to convert my entries in this journal to that one while I still had less than 60. Please be sure to update your friends lists. I'm not quite sure what I'll use this one for, but I'll figure something out.</b>

If the other person was smart enough they would have READ or watched an educational program about how to behave around sharks in such a situation. If they struggle and therefore exert prey-like movements and get bitten, that's their problem. Maybe I'd yell and tell them what to do, but my enemies are mostly slutty and ditzy asswads and therefore would begin struggling upon my mentioning the shark's presence.

19) You have to hit someone but you can only choose from one of these weapons which one would you choose

- shopping cart
- tree branch

21) What is your best story that you tell everyone: I don't know

22) You are cooking an egg and you open the egg up after have cooked it and there is a baby chicken inside the egg what do you do: That can't possibly happen, and even if it did, I wouldn't be the one responsible for killing it because it would have been refrigerated prior to my purchasing the carton.

24) What makes you vomit: absolutely nothing, because that's my worst fear

26) song title which starts with the letter y and end with the letter e: i don't know

27) If you had to write a book what would the book be about: <b>(HAHAHA Roxx I liked your book idea!!) Well, someday I plan on writing realistic fiction, so, I guess, realistic fiction. 

28) There is a fire in your house and your in the shower do you go and get dressed before getting out or do you run out in a towel: A towel. I'd rather save my animals than retain my dignity.

29) Three things you would take with yourself if there was a fire: nonliving?... uh, all my photo negatives (yes, I keep them all, labeled, in a box in case of such a scenario), my swordfish pillow and, well, i can't think of the third thing but I know it's important... 

30) What type of mood are you in: tired

31) What made you in this type of mood: I was going to go for my regular 3 mile run today, but at the end of the first street on my route (two miles into my walk) I get to the second street, which is a main road, and realized that the sidewalks have not been plowed. Thus, I had to turn around and jog two miles back down the street whence I cam from, giving me a total of a 4 mile run. This was not fun, considering I'm not used to so much exercise, having been cooped up in the house for three months of below zero windchill.

32) Would you eat a gold fish for $100 000: No, that's cruel. Imagine being digested alive...

34) What's inside the box: a ballerina

35) If you could be famous what would you be famous of e.g. singer, actor: author or rockstar

36) What's something you have always wanted to do but always have chickened out at the last minute: we'll not get into that...

37) Have you ever got lost before and if so where: No

38) What did you end up doing today: most of the day has been spent on homework. what the fuk is the point of having a weekend of you are given homework?????!!!!! <i>*stabs school*</i>

39) If you could travel some where where would you go: Finland, Sweden, Norway, Greenland, Colorado, Los Angelas, and I'd definately go back to Alaska in a heartbeat.

53) Last video/dvd you bought: Tomcats

We have these weird overflow problems with our plumbing, and my dad has set up this complicated system to rid us of excess water that the plumbing system can't take care of (not going to get into it). Anyhow, the main transport of water from the bucket of overflow in the basement to the underground pipes outside is a hose. This hose freezes when it's been left outside in the cold. My dad asked me to bring it in this evening, so I did, but I forgot to put the end of the hose into the bucket so that the frozen stuff didn't leak all over the floor.

So, my dad discoverd that the basement's flooded and he blew up at me about it. WTF! I'm really pissed at him right now. My brother was supposed to bring the fucking hose in earlier TO BEGIN WITH, and because he couldn't dutifully accomplish his task, I was forced to trudge into the snow and go down into our creepy-ass basement and do it. And what do I get for my efforts? STRIFE! It's not like there was even THAT MUCH water on the floor. A couple of already dirty bath towels later and, like magic, the water is soaked up and the towels can be chucked in the washing machine! WOW! Since it's dinnertime, to add to the dramatic scene, my dad declares that ""he's lost his appetite."" This pisses me off. He was able to scarf down a piece of leftover garlic bread easily enough before the incident occured.   

I hate having fights with my dad, because he's one of my best friends. 

On top of everything else, I have a pounding earache and it's making me nauseaus. I'm just going to finish my VHS homework and go to bed. Why can't it be fucking April already? April's going to be a month full of goodies: Seeing Jesus Christ Superstar and meeting Baz, and then April vacation in Maine with Amanda. But no.. the weekdays just DRAG and DRAG and DRAG and DRAG and DRAG by.... and the weekends go <i>ZIP!</i>. Isn't it funny how school strategically makes itself available on the days that go <i>DRAG</i> as opposed to the ones that go <i>ZIP</i>? I find that worthy of investigation.

One more thing before I go to do homework... I've been thinking about this all week: I want someone to prove to me that the concept of math is real. It's kind of hard to explain how I want it proven, but I'll try my best. You see, how do you know if it's not a concept made up by people to torture those who don't have math-oriented intellect? In fact, how can you prove that it's not made-up? Perhaps some caveman with nothing better to do with his pointless existance first started making up words and symbols to associate with groups of objects. 
In my opinion, English is a MUCH better skill to have than math. You can get by in life on having English skills and no math skills, but you can't do the opposite. No individual can possibly survive in society without the use of English. My brother is a prime example of such issues. He's brilliant in math, but his English skills are worse those that I had in first grade (especially when confronted with the fact that I read and wrote a book report on the unabridged version of <u>Call of the Wild</u> when I was in second grade, whence my classmates were still struggling through their ""Hooked on Phonics""; I think my teacher had a stroke). Hearing my brother try to explain or speak about something makes our current president sound like Edgar Allen Poe. Yes, my friends, it's that bad.
Anyhow, sorry I've been rambling on about mathematics. I'm a little more than pissed that we're now reviewing algebra in Chemistry. I thought I was done in fucking math, algebra especially. Mr. Poskus gave me the minimum passing ""C"" out of kindness last semester, and if I have to relive this in Chem, I may very well end up with a similar grade. WHAY DOESN'T HOLLISTON OFFER MORE ENVIRONMENTAL CLASSES??!!! FUCK THEM!!

Sorry....

"event","I think I figured out who the stumpy girl is!! It's seriously not what I expected, but I'm 99.9999% sure that she is not a threat. PHEW! I don't really want to post who I think she is here. Ask me if you care to know my assumptions. Maybe someone can confirm them.

I was listening to David Bowie today. I have all of his CDs, but I haven't listened to them in a while. I miss Davie :-) I think I'm going to begin listening to him once again. 

Not much else to say about today. My mom dismissed me from school at noon because of the snow. It was great :-)



<lj-cut text=""So, new topic. I'm going to need your vote for this one."">I REALLY desire a snake as my college dorm pet. Why?
1. I <3 snakes to begin with and have always wanted one.
2. If I can't get a single room and my roommate ends up being an undesireable person to be within an 8 mile radius of, perhaps the presence of the snake will ward her off. 
3. No large pets are allowed (I even had to cross the idea of a ferret off my list because the cage is too large) and if I were to have a small pet, my first choice would be a snake.

I don't yet know what species I want to purchase, however. I know that students at UMaine Machias are allowed to keep, at largest, a 20 gallon tank, so it couldn't be a huge snake like a boa constrictor, which is what I REALLY want because of their docileness... :-( 
Although I can only keep a snake up to 5 feet in length (otherwise a 20 gallon tank would be too cramped), I want it to be a species that's gentle, docile, and that I can hold.

So, with this criteria, I have a few choices:

1. Ball Python (avg. 5 ft)<img src=""http://captivebredpythons.com/balls/TigerArt1.jpg"" alt=""title or description"" />I think this species is my first choice. They are gentle, easy to handle and can be carried around, and have a VERY low bite tendancy (this is a good thing!). They also come in lots of pretty colors and markings! I'd probably end up getting an <a href=""http://captivebredpythons.com/balls/Albino4.jpg"">albino</a>  because they are so preeeeetty :-)



2. Rosy Boa (avg. 2.5-5 ft)<img src=""http://www.herpscope.com/desertboas/rosyboa-3.gif"" alt=""title or description"" /> This is a GORGEOUS snake. It would probably be my first choice if I were going for appearance, but I'm definately going for temperament in this case. These snakes are gentle, easily handled and are easy to care for. I am told that they are a good beginner snake. Probably my second choice, although I have some more researching to do.

Hmm... so, I think after spending 2 hours researching these two species, I'm really leaning towards the ball python. I think I'm going to go pick up a book on them. What does everyone else think? Even if you hate snakes, leave a comment and tell me which one you think I should buy (I'll probably purchase it spring 2004, so as to bond with it before college).

I'm having major issues... wanna know why? Haha.. I think David Duchovny is cute! Yeah, I'm wierd. I've just become increasingly attached to the character of Fox Mulder. At first I looked at him and thought, ""eh.. OK but kinda old,"" but after becoming recently obsessed with the show, I think he's cute. I think it's his smile. It's wierd, considering I usually like guys with either long or light hair (or both). Then again... I also like Johnny Depp, Mark Wahlberg and Heath Ledger, all natural brunettes. I guess I just limit my attraction towards brunettes to actors (and Sebastian Bach of course, even though he dyes his hair blonde). Go figure. Yea, so, I'm babbling. Eh...

I am getting dismissed at 8:25 tomorrow to go view a dog being spayed at Acorn Animal Hospital in Franklin. It's an extra-credit ""field trip"" for VHS (all I have to do is write a paper about my experience and send verification that I was there... it's worth 25 points!), so I figured I'd take it. I'll really only just be missing Drama (even though that's the only class I fucking LIKE). I'm going to stop and get Amanda and I lunch before I go back to school. We will have veggie subs for lunch ^_^

I just found this t-shirt on the floor that had some stupid saying on it (it's one of those corny yet hilarious ones from Hot Topic). I was going to give it to Richard last summer but then I found out he had a girlfriend and thought ""screw it"" because it would have ended up being sketchy and things would have been even more uncomfortable than they already were. I ended up just giving it to my brother, becuase I had no use for it. Looking at it makes me want to cry...


Guess what? <i>*smiles*</i> Guess who was wearing those adorable PJ pants again today? ^_^ I just wish I could hug him... he's so cute...

<i>*sigh*</i>Hmm... I hope my birthday cake wish comes through one of these days.. <3

Anyhow, I should probably be going. I have to write a fun paper that'd due by midnight for VHS. I'm so stoked that entusiasm is coming out of my ears.

Oh, BTW.. Lauren, I'm having one of those ""anti-menopausal"" cold flashes again. HAHAHAHAAHA we are so cool!"

My uncle is coming up from Tennessee on Thursday to look at some houses in the area. He's staying with us for a few days. My mom is throwing a flipping fit because of the highly embarassing mildew problem in our upstairs bathroom. It's somewhat amusing. ^_^ I'm sad that my cousin isn't coming with him, considering I hardly ever see her, but she has school and basketball, so they won't pull her out to come.

I had this really wierd dream in my fleeting moments of sleep last night. I had an identical twin, and we were planning on running away, because we needed to hide from something (?). So, we gathered up all the belongings in my closet and put them in tupperware laundrey baskets, and we were going to float them down the road (because, you see, the road was not pavement, but a rushing overflowed river) to the open ocean, where we were planning on hiding out. This was to be done by holding onto the laundry baskets full of junk and paddling with our feet, meanwhile covering our floating bodies with a tarp so that only our noses and eyes were showing. There was also a life-sized cardboard cutout of Paul Stanley from KISS involved. I think that was one of the things my twin desperately wanted to take with us, and it ended up getting blown into the ocean by the wind or something and eventually sucked into a whirlpool.

In conclusion, I'm UNDOUBTEDLY reinforcing this ""no coffee before bed"" rule."

Now I don't know if anything will ever happen.



Why are the decent ones (those, at least, who I am attracted to) always taken? WHY...? 

And Why don't they ever like me? Of course, reading this journal is not going to heighten anyone's views of me in a positive way, but that's because I have nowhere else to express my negative feelings. I <i>do</i> consider myself a decent, generally genteel, pleasant, well-rounded person in the physical presence of others.... 

Maybe Erin's right... perhaps I AM jumping to conclusions, but this coupled with the incidences that have occured in the past two weeks does not create a positive outcome in my mind.

I feel really.... empty... right now...

So, I guess tomorrow's plans for sitting with him at lunch are completely annulled. Or they are so until I find out more about the possible personal ""dilemma"" that has been presented to me. There's no way in hell I'm going to try to initiate something if he's taken. I have learned from bitter experience that doing so can only create a tense, uncomfortable feeling between the people who are involved. I won't put someone else through that. EVER. It's inconsiderate.

I feel so selfish. It must be the jealousy once again....

The only drawback is that it's all starchy, and therefore extremely stiff, from being in storage.. my mom says that it should soften up in a few days.. I really hope so. It might be uncomfortable and a little bit cold to sleep under something with the consistancy of a two-by-four....
I haven't tried the elk jerky yet, but I can already tell it's mouth-watering. I have been droling over it and have wanted desperately to open the package, but I'd like to wait until my mought gains back its feeling so I'm waiting until tomorrow.

So... the highlight of my day, and the thing that made me feel 89% better than I did yesterday was the fact that he wore PJ pants to school... WTF...?? And they were too short, kinda like they'd been shrunken. I saw him and thought, <i>Wow, you are the cutest guy on the entire face of the planet, and I wished that you liked me more than anything in the world....

*sigh*</i>

And I didn't see him with that girl, so that was good. He also had someone to sit with at lunch today. He looked a hell of a lot happier. That made me happy. It's just so sad to see him sitting alone all the time. Of course, this doesn't leave me with any chance to try and sit with him now without either: 1. embarassing him, or, 2. creeping him out, but at least now he doesn't appear so pathetic.

"event","My day was OK until the bell rang for the end of school... 

Yea, so.. all I <i>really</i> wanted for my birthday was the possibility of a future with him... the only reason I had any drive to come to school at all was the prospect of seeing him...

And what do I get for my birthday? A fucking broken heart....

Woohoo... happy 17th, Anneliese.... you suck...

Yea, so, the rest of this entry is in the cut below...


<lj-cut text=""Read on if you so desire.."">So, the end of school pissed me off bigtime. I walked past the office, and he was sitting inside  with that girl I've seen him with before. They weren't doing anything... not even talking, but they were just sitting there together. This leads me to believe that they are at least friends.... but I don't recognize her at all.... she might be a freshman, but I think she's a sophomore.. maybe Sam can ID her for me.. so it's just wierd. I think he drives her to and from school or something, but I'm not certain. I've seen them leave the school together - yet again, walking together but not talking - so I really have no clue what exactly their relationship is... whether it's friends or something else.

So, seeing that just sent this wave of jealousy through me and I have been angrier than I have been in a long time. For once, it wasn't my own cowardice that was making me irate, but it was the jealousy... wow.. actually, I'm not sure I have felt that jealous since this summer when I saw Richard with his girlfriend, but whatever. I came home and almost burst into tears, but I felt a little better after talking to Erin, who assured me that she doesn't think that he has a girlfriend. She said she's find out for me... I love her... Erin you are the best :-) Haha... I don't know how you put up with me!

Eh... so I really don't know what to do. I don't know, now, whether to try and sit with him again or not... I mean, I was considering making an attempt tomorrow, but now I really don't know. I really don't want to make myself a pest, or seem desperate (even though I am). I also don't want to look like I'm hitting on him if he has a girlfriend.. that would be lame. I guess I'm just not going to feel better at all until I know for sure that he's not involved. I just want to be certain.. it will make me feel a hell of a lot better. If I find out that he <i>is</i> involved, yes, I'm going to be very jealous and yes, it's going to take a while for me to get over him.

Ew.. why am I disgusting in the sense that I get so attached to these guys and they don't even know it. I'm so fucking pathetic... I really do like him though... I like him a lot. He's VERY cute, and he's nice, and he's quiet (which I like in guys), and he's incredibly funny in a discreet sort of way...  all traits that I honor in guys. It's so hard to find a guy who fits my criteria of an ""ideal"" guy... and he fits SO much of that that I look for...

I guess I can hope that my mind is taking this situation and running with it.... mind-fucking myself...

I feel so gross liking someone this much and them not knowing about it... I fucking hate feeling like a fucking stalker. At the same time, I can't fucking help it. What the hell is wrong with me...

I vowed to never again fall for an HHS guy... I vowed to like only out-of-state guys, because then it doesn't hurt so much since you can't see them for long periods of time... liking a guy at school only makes me feel horrible about myself for the entire year, because they're never interested in return and I'm so fucking pathetic that I am enamored with them anyway. Oh look, I did! I've failed myself once again! 

I percieve myself as a horrible person, because, here I am, feeling bad for myself, and I have friends who have problems much worse than mine... I mean, my issues can't even <i>compare</i> to theirs... I'm so sick of pitying myself. It makes me feel weak and selfish... both of those are feelings that I can't stand. I feel like I always let myself down. I think the only reason I <i>do</i> feel selfish when it comes to my problems is because everyone else seems to have at least one admirer. I mean, I hate to sound artificial, because I'm really not. All I want is a meaningful relationship. Every other one of my friends are continually being asked out, or are told that they have someone who likes them, or they have guys who walk up to them all the time and say ""Hey! Want to hang out sometime?"" I think that's what makes me selfish, because I'm deeply jealous. I always feel like I'm missing out, especially when I'm having a conversation similar to the following ""demo"" one:

<u>Me:</u> How was your weekend?
<u>Friend:</u> It was amazing. I hung out with Gavin.
<u>Me:</u> Oh, what did you do?
<u>Friend:</u> Well, he came over my house and we sat on the couch in front of the fireplace and cuddled and read together <b>(OK, I know none of my friends would do this... it's just something I'd enjoy doing with a boyfriend...)</b>, and then we went out to dinner and came back to my house, sat on my porch together and gazed at the stars...
<u>Me *seething with jealousy at this point but trying to hide it*:</u> Oh that sounds like a lot of fun! Hey, guess what? I saw ""T"" at lunch today......!
<u>Friend:</u> cool....

Yes, I am <i>always</i> happy for my friends, so please don't get the wrong message... I still want to hear about your guys.. I really AM happy for you, I just sometimes feel like I'm missing out on a whole lot of happiness because I am not involved with anyone. I want my friends to be happy.... I don't like anyone to be miserable such as I am.

Please... if someone could be honest and tell me what I'm doing wrong. I don't want people to lie to me. I don't understand why I don't have anyone who likes me... I can't be THAT ugly.... I admit to being a bit withdrawn and antisocial, but I try to be friendly to those I don't know who start a conversation with me.... I don't like to snub people. I try to stay out of the way of most people who think themselves better than me bacause I hate unnecessary confrontations and I keep quiet about things... so what is it about me that pisses people off or drives them to dislike me? 
Please, I REALLY want you to be honest.. I want to correct my flaws now.... I would like another chance to try and get him to like me.. 
This journal is a poor reflection of the real me... it is the side of me that very few people have ever seen. If someone random read this, they'd think ""Wow.. what an angry person..."" but I'm really not. I can't express these feelings in school only because I can't possibly be unhappy when I'm with my friends...

I'm sorry for those of you who have gone and read this entire entry (I doubt that there are many of you...), but I just really needed to rant. I haven't had a good rant in a while, so I have all this pent up negativity that had I had to release. I'm just so sick of having a broken heart. It's becoming such a common feeling for me that I keep wondering if i'll ever feel anything different. It hurts, even when the guy who breaks it doesn't even realize it... I guess that technically means I've broken my own heart. I keep wondering if I'll ever understand the feeling of being liked back by someone who I have feelings for. I think that I'd really have a lot to offer to someone I really ""like"" who'd want to be my boyfriend... 

Alright.. I'm sorry. There's more I could say, but I think I've said enough. You're probably irritated with me already.

"event","Today was fun. My mom and I took a trip to Kittery, ME to go shopping. I bought a pair of pants. When we were on our way home, I tried to make my mom turn the car around and head north, but she said that we had to head back to Massachusetts (AKA the land of rich snobby yuppies). I gave the ""Welcome to Massachusetts"" sign the finger, because I really hate it right now. I would give up a lot to move to Maine. I want, more than ever, to spend my senior year there. I already know that, despite the fact we will be seniors and therefore some things will be enjoyable, next year as a whole is going to be a bad one for me. 

Much to my dissapointment, there were no hot guys in Kittery. There was only this gross guy in the leather store that looked like a petophile. He was greying and fat and had hair that was poofy and frizzy, almost like a straigh afro... <i>*shiver*</i> for those of you who watch ""the osbournes,"" he looked like a fat Dill... scary... 

I got home and tried to call Nia, but she wasn't home, and when I called Sam, he said that she'd gone to Conn. :-( I am sad. I have been wanting to do something with them all week. <i>*sniffle*</i> Erg... well, maybe next Friday. I'm kinda hoping that they can come over after school on Friday and we can make it to a matinee movie or something. That would be fun. Then we could come back to my house and hang out for a little while. Wheeeee...! I <3 Sam. He is one hott mama! ^_^ *dances* I would like to learn parapara so you'll have to teach me!

"event","I love how livejournal is an asswad. I kind of hate how I had to almost permanently revert to it out of intimidation from HHS on Deadjournal, but oh well. It's taken me 65943 hours to try and access LJ.  Eh... 

My dad was just telling me about something interesting he saw in Boston on his way home from work today... He was driving along and he suddenly saw this hawk swoop down to snatch something and it came back up with a writhing feral cat in its talons. This is both disturbing and amusing, seeing that I'm not a cat person, that is. However, the cat probably experienced a much kinder death compared to a slow and painful starvation or hypothermia. My father's argument was ""It must have been one hell of a hungry raptor.""

So, I spent my morning jumping off the roof of my shed into the 92068943765278 inches or so of snow in my backyard. It was fun. The rest of the day was spent cleaning my room and.... EXERCISING. It was so warm that I threw on a t-shirt and took the dogs for a jog on the tandem leash that I just bought at Petsmart. I don't think I have ever felt better than I did after today's jog. This is the first time in WEEKS that I have been able to do such a thing. It was so fucking warm today that nothing could keep me in the house. I just wish I couldhave gone for my 3 mile run... I didn't dare because the 2 mile road is so narrow and there aren't sidewalks.. I didn't want to risk my or my dogs being runover by some blundering idiot redneck in a large, speeding vehical. 

I think my dad is suffering horrible side-effects of dealing with punishing and yelling at my brother (he takes over for my mom in the disciplinary department once he gets home). My brother tried to come in and eat dinner while laying on the couch. This is an unacceptable behavior from my brother, as he is the world's worst slob. My usually well-read, highly literate and educated father's comment was ""Arthur, use some smartness, why don't you?!"" Oh, this is not good.... My brother is the reason why I am afriad of having children, someday. I am afraid that I'll have a child like him and then not be able to deal with it.... That's a scary thought. Let's just hope that my and my husband's genes blend the right way, shall we? And I am raising my kids on animals that I hunt myself... no steriod-pumped chicken for them, thank you...


You will all be interested to learn that male Bull Sharks have 80 times the testosterone of a mating male elephant. That's why they are the #1 most reported attack shark, even though sharks don't purposely attack human beings...

I <3 sharks. They are my second favorite animal.

Alright... sleep time for me. 

Oh, and I keep forgetting to write this... I really, REALLY hate the new Godsmack song. It really sucks... like... in a really bad way. I was expecting much better, but oh well."

"event","I think nature needs to use some <i>Head & Shoulders</i>. Or, if that doesn't work, <i>Selson Blue</i> will do the trick.

I love snow, but I must admit that this is getting a bit out of control. It's bad enough that I feel I've been caged in my house for the past 5 weeks, but now I can't spend my vacation outside because the weather is more miserable than normal? E

I want to take the dogsled out of the shed and hitch Kodi up to it, but he's such a wuss and a lazy ass when it comes to pulling it (despite the fact that he is quite capable of pulling things 478329 times the sled's weight at any <i>other</i> point in time). And since Selkie is still growing and I can't technically hitch her up to it without the fear of deforming her still-hardening puppy skeletal structure, she's useless in the working department. And plus, the fucking playground AND baseball field now have signs up on the fences that say ""no dogs allowed."" I kind of have to follow this rule considering cops make their rounds down their daily due to the drug deals that ^occasionally^ happen, although I suppose I could plead ignorance due to the signs being hidden by tumultous piles of brown snow. 

Another problem is the stupid assholes that the town of Bellingham deploy to clear the roads. Last year, Kodi and I were pulling the sled down the street and the plower guy almost plowed my $600 sled AND Kodi. I gave him the finger (one of the few times I have ever felt compelled to give the finger to someone) and tried to make Kodi pull faster to get even further out of the asswad's way (even though we had been on the sidewalk in the first place).

So... I officially have nothing to do. 

I must admit, it IS amusing to see the 12 foot pile of snow that idiotface (for those who don't know, ""idiotface"" is the potbellied, truck-driver hick that lives across the street from me) now has in front of his garage. And the funny thing is, he'll be stupid enough to pay $100 for it to be taken away...

My dad and I had a good laugh over that one. 


Other than that, I still have cabin fever. I cannot WAIT to get out of this house and DO SOMETHING. I feel like my metabolism has hit rock bottom, and it's gross. I can't exercise... I can bearly move a few mere feet in my backyard because I become exhausted from plowing through thigh-deep snow and within moments, I can't feel my fingertips, even with the use of down-feather filled gloves. 

AHHHHHHHH!!!!

Oh, and by the way, for those of you who claim that they want to stay home and watch TV for the day rather than come to school.... I beg to differ. I spent the day doing just that, and let me tell you, there is nothing, I repeat, NOTHING worse than daytime television. It was a breath of fresh air to be able to go to my room and finish <u>Beowulf</u>, but since I've run completely out of novels to read (I am anticipating a MUCH-NEEDED trip to Barnes & Nobel tomorrow), I spent the rest of my afternoon drooling and watching <i>Golden Girls</i> reruns (self-strangulation is a kinder activity...) 

Wait... actually, there was <b>one</b> good thing on... ESPN was doing the <b><i>""Great Outdoors 2002 Lumberjack Competition.""</i></b> Those guys were cool... I could never even imagine trying to do some of the stuff they were put up to. and one was incredibly beautiful... and <i>single</i>... <b>Brian Bartow</b> kicks ass... and is sexy.... a sexy lumberjack... mmm.... he was quite delicious.... 

Alright, <i>Monster Garage</i> is coming on in 3 minutes. I'm out."

I went to Tiffany's last night with Amina. We went to Blockbuster and rented the last available copy of My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Tiffany and Brian met us there and then we went back to her house, made tollhouse cookies and watched the movie. It was fun :-) Tiffany's pig is SO cute!

I like snow, but this is getting ridiculous... 20 inches???! On top of our current 50 or so??! I hope not... I hope the weatherman is fibbing. 

I mean, really now.... my cabin fever is worsening. It is too cold to walk my dogs even down to the playground and back, and I feel like I'm getting wicked fat from lack of physical activity. Blech....

I can't believe two days of vacation have swept by so fast. Ehh.... The next two days will probably be spent snowed in, consisting of me sitting in a corner and staring blankly at some sort of inanimate object in an effort to keep myself from running around in circles chasing a non-existant ""phantom"" extra appendage (all of this out of complete and utter boredom). I also can't believe that I'll be 17 a week from today. Someone better buy me a walker for my birthday... old age is not far off...

Well, I'm off to figure out some sort of nourishment to give my sick puppy. She has been throwing up all day and it's been wicked gross. She's looking a little better now, though, which is GOOD because I hate cleaning it up... yuck...

1. Boston is a scary place right now and I hate the fact that he's there 6 days a week for 12 hours a day...

2. The exact same type of position he has now at Boston Lobster Company is open at a pound in Boothbay Harbor.... we could basically move there.... I can't tell you how MUCH I want to spend my senior year in a place I actually like... (even though I'd miss my friends terribly... but hey, you could've visited... it's only 4 hours away!)

3. I want to move to Boothbay Harbor.... there are SO many benefits in it for me... one of the most important being the reduced college tuition my parents are bestowed with if we live in Maine a year prior to my going off to UMM, which I have been promised that I will undoubtedly be accepted to. 

Unfortunately, none of this is going to happen.

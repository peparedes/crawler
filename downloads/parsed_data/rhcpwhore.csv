"event","yeah... so i'm at work on the computer, and my away message is up. but greg keeps tryin to talk to me. then my dad wants the computer and gets on, and all these messages are coming up, all i love you and i miss you, say hi to your dad for me, etc. my dad just looked at me and says,"" aw, he loves you"", all sing-song like. i was pissed and embarrased, and i want greg to not like me anymore. i want to be dumped by someone i'm not even going out with. Why is he like this? every time i think it's no big thing and i can deal...he makes it worse. like when he talks about marrying me.

Oh yeah! then he emails his friend and has him call me to tell me he misses me...i can't fuckin stand it. i used to like him so much, and it worked so well.

i just talked to james. he told me that he used to like me...and was going to tell me but chickened out. now he is happy with chels eberly, and i feel sad."

"event","so...i'm home from work today. i had a doctor's appointment. at the moment i can't stand either of my siblings who are home. my sister's only 11, but she still manages to be a royal bitch sometimes. she yells at me about everything, and then tells me i'm mean.
it's weird. i feel so un-artistic right now...like, i have no creative motivation whatsoever. i'm trying to learn stairway to heaven on the guitar...but i suck delotto's balls. and that's bad.
i miss dance. i don't get any ballet for a few weeks, and it's killing me. i feel fat (as in unexercised), and i can feel all of my hard-earned flexibility leaving me. it's sad."

"event","yesterday i got to drive 3 1/2 hours to washington county to take pictures of weeds on the roadside. yep. fun. for 10 hours not including the drive. the cool thing is...i get paid 7.50 an hour for riding in the car. now i can go to college. i need to go to the drive-in.oh! yesterday i was tripping through weeds and i almost stepped on a baby deer. it just looked at me and then bounded cutely away. i was all ""aaaw"" and everything. so adorable. ANYWAY...yeah. not much else going on...i can't wait to see evryone again. i feel so isolated. (as always). that seems to be a theme with me.
I bought a cute bathingsuit...re with polka dots.(one-piece of course:) and there's not much else to tell."

"event","So Shane is graduating...she doesn't seem all that much older than us. Then again, I'm a junior now. That's so weird. It doesn't seem that long ago that I first came to pv as a freshman. Even though I don't know her that well, or Dana or Casie, I will miss them. Sucks that I couldn't go to the picnic shindig thing...but I'm being with my family.Mmm...all that togetherness. Got my report card yesterday, mostly A's, some B's, and a C. 3.5 GPA. I'm not too disappointed, but as my parents so often tell me, a 3.5 won't get me a scholarship. Pen State, here I come."

"event","I just slept for two hours. I love it. I was going to go see batman today, but no, i guess i'll just sit at home and do nothing. It's all about the family togetherness...
My brother's a pompous ass...and self-centered, too. He says he looks just like Anthony. Could've killed him, but instead i just laughed. No, but seriousely, he's a jerk. He might have to go to school with me next year, and the way he talks about penns valley-dwellers (my friends) pisses me off. I'll admit some of em are rednecks, but this from the kid used to try and trap birds in cardboard boxes and then shoot them with arrows at point blank. Not cool. It'll be interesting to see ow he fits in if he does come to the high school with me.
Nellie, it's time to corrupt me. You've got your work cut out. 

~Oh yeah Nel, can you email me your buddy list? haha"

"event","must go to the library...i need books! ok, well, it turns out that I probably won't start work for another week or so because of papers and physicals and all that sweet shit...so i've been doing yard work and getting properly sunburned. it feels so good when you're soaking up the sun, but it seems like two seconds after i walk inside all the itchy rednees appears. just like magic. i'm exuding heat right now, and i feel damaged. psycho much? haha...greg's mom doesn't like me. she says i'm condescending and sarcastic.??? i was only around the woman for 15 minutes. if she can see that, it must be painfully obvious. as hard as i try not to let it bother me, it really does bother me that she thinks that of me, and i'm starting to doubt myself, think she's right, etc. it's hard to please the militant catholic ladies...greg said i probably just said something political to piss her off, or didn't take my faith seriousely enough, or something...grrr.judgemental people upset me. oh yeah! and greg...he does this thing when he feels ignored by me...he just get's all quiet until i notice and ask him what's wrong...he usually ends up saying not to worry about it, sort of forgiving me (thanks?), like i'm at fault. and the thing that makes me really mad is that i always give in and ask him what's wrong and apologize, even though i know i shouldn't. i just care about him, and hate it when he's moody. it's manipulative of him because he knows what i'll do. (by the way, i won't be surprised if nobody reads this because it's ust full of stupid useless details of my life...???) i miss art class. it's hard to sit at home where it's hot and loud and i'm tired... and be creative. i can't do it. plus, i don't have nell or em or mr. miles to ask what the hell is wrong with my paintings, why won't it come to me? i think i have painter's block:)"

"event","It's been a while...I can't believe school's finally out. I don't like the idea of not being able to see everyone on a daily basis. Miss them all already. So, this week was the homeschooling conference, which I went to to keep my friends company. Nothing much to tell about it. I love staying in hotels, though:) Mom and Dad are talking about taking a vacation. Just somewhere like Jersey, but it's good enough for me. Oh! There's a chance that i might get to see Coldplay in pittsburgh! Oh my god, what a great first concert. I really hope that works out. I bought there new cd today, along with Joshua Tree, and the new wallflowers album. All really good. I love british rock. I start work sometime this week, as soon as the paperwork's filled out. I've never had a fulltime job before, and other than making me rich, it's gonna suck. Oh well, I get bored during summer vacation anyway. Maybe working outside will get me a tan...haha. Tony called me asking if i could come to band practice tonight. He didn't say more than one word answers. I thought it was a wrong number thing at first, and almost hung up on him...
So, we're getting an addition. I get the new bedroom, the first time i've ever had my own. right now the house is so cramped. I made great progress on bob marley today...it's been getting progressively closer to looking like shit literally because i have to mix new colors every time. brown sucks. I almost took it and dumped it in the trash, but it's all good now. i want report cards to come...see how i deid on that french final."

"event","Are you happy now nellie? haha. You've been telling me to get a journal forever...there is absolutely nothing going on right now. I'm too bored to sleep (or do chem), even though i'm exhausted. My day so far consists of: breakfast, major cleaning/rearranging/organizing of my room, ballet rehearsal for six hours, pizza, watching star wars, more cleaning...you get the picture. I feel really cut off from the world right now, everybody in my house is sleeping, and there is nobody to talk to. I need to get a screen name. Greg is in Virginia at the ""Homeschool Prom"".No, I'm not making that up. God, I can't wait for him to come back so I can make fun of him. I might even make him a shirt, you know, ""i survived the homeschool prom"", or something. I need someone to go see Episode III with. I think I'll wait another week, though, let everybody who waited in line for tickets see it first. I have sorely neglected my paintings. There are about five of them sitting downstairs in the basement unfinished. They don't dry very fast. I tried setting up a fan, but ended up having hair and dead ladybugs stuck all over them cause the basement is dirty. I probably should have started studying for my finals...grrr."

"event","<html><center>i spent the weekend in chris's hometown of Ealing and we did a lot of exploring. it was an excellent weekend.

<lj-cut text=""some photos"">

on saturday we went to Syon park, unfortunately you couldn't go round much of the grounds and the house was closed for a private function :( but i took some pictures of the great conservatory, it was massive.

on the way back from the park we stopped off at this old graveyard that was in quite a depressing state, lots of the graves were collapsed and the big church in the center was all boarded up.

on sunday we visited Kew Gardens. there was so much to see and we didn't manage to see it all :(

the pagoda

the palm house from across the lake. it was so hot in there that we didn't stay inside for long.

"event","so after much stress over money for like over 5 months things have finally been sorted despite virtually no effort from the student loans company (a parcel full of dog turd is on the way to their central office :P).

and no that i'm not desperately poor i can finally enjoy myself and the first thing on my list was buying an overlocker. after much research i've bought the <a href=""http://www.sewingmachines.co.uk/Janome744_info.htm"">Janome 744D</a>. it actually came yesterday but the annoying porter had gone AWOL and all i could do was look thought the window into his office where the box was sitting on the floor :(. i went to collect it before my lectures and now i can't wipe the huge grin off my face. have only just started having a play around with it and it's so much more complicated than my humble sewing machine. i'm so thankful that it came already threaded as the instructions for threading take up 11 out of the 50 pages in the manual!!"

"event","so my visit to toysrus was a complete waste of time, they had nothing new whatsoever or anything on sale. RUBBISH

got some nice cotton material in magenta and a teal green on saturday. it's quite thin but it'll make some nice summer dresses (i hope). i spent last summer with not much choice of what to wear as it was too hot for most of my clothes :(.

i went and collected my new shoes this morning and i love them so much, they're easily the cutest shoes that i've bought for ages, i'm so tempted to get the same pair in white."

"event","<html><center>grrr i'm so annoyed right now. my new shoes have arrived but i went to the porter's office with the slip to collect them and the office was shut for lunch (1-2pm) and wouldn't be open until my next lecture started, so being good i went to my lectures with the intension of rushing back after to pick up th shoes before the office closed at 5pm. so i rush back and get there at 4.55 (my watch is fast) and all the shutters were down and lights turned off, the fucking slacker had clearly left at 4.50 at the latest. i'll have to wait till monday now. why are the opening hours of the facilities always so poorly thought out? it really pisses me off.

anyway i'm hoping to go to toysrus tomorrow, the shops in brighton are shit as far as getting hold of bratz goes: woolworths has had nothing new in for months and they don't even have any on sale, gameleys never has bratz (can you believe that? they have loads of barbies though) and argos has got loads of new ones but it can be a pain to get a specific doll as you have to ask them to bring out all of the dolls from that line from the back and sometimes they won't do that (i don't see why they can't have seperate catelog numbers for each bratz doll, i'd prolly buy loads from them then)</center></html>"

"event","i had quite a nice trip to falmouth earlier and got some nice things, including costume party lela, which i'm very happy about :)

but then i had to deal with the retarded student loans company. they won't give me a payment until i've signed and returned a declaration letter, but they haven't sent me one of those instead they've sent me 3 notification letters (the 2 are supposed to come together or at least in quick succession). they are all a bunch wankers. i like to think that i've evolved beyond primative activities but i think if i got the chance i wouldn't be ashamed to act like a monkey and lob my own shit at them.   

this whole mess only reaffirms my already strong belief that this country is run (on all levels) by a bunch of cretins who probably couldn't find their own ass even with the aid of a torch, a mirror and a copy of gray's anatomy."

"event","<html><center>well cause i'm back in cornwall i get to be re-united with the other half (well probably 2/3) of my bratz collection so i thought i'd take some pictures. i've been collecting bratz for just over 5 years now and i love new year cause all the new bratz start to show up in the shops :).

<lj-cut text=""see more"">

here's a picture of them all on the bed except for my mini bratz cause i'm lazy!

i decided to take pictures of each of the characters

jade has always been my favourite, the one in the white dress is first edition jade (i bought back here from brighton with me but i have 4 other jades that i left up there)

i don't think i'd still be collecting bratz dolls if they didn't keep making them better and better. when i compare my first ones with more recent dolls you can see how the eyes are more detailed and how the clothes have gotten more interesting

i'm so looking forward to getting my hands on the new charli doll, finally a doll named after me!

hopefully one day i'll be able to have all my bratz in the same location preferably in a big glass cabinate away from sunlight, of course ;) *le sigh*

i got given lots of chocolate, we're talking 2 big tins of celebrations, chocolate biscuits, a chocolate orange... etc. i don't think i'll be able to take it all back to brighton.

had a nice lunch, ate too much of course :)

am still looking forward to going back to brighton

on a totally different note the twiins krysta and lela are half-price in argos so i'm hoping to get those in the next couple of days.</center></html>"

"event","<html>today my sweet dreamz felicia arrived, yay! she's so pretty, i totally love her. she came with this cool lip gloss and each girl comes with a different one. it kinda sucks though because the version of the sweet dreamz dolls that's been released here in the UK doesn't come with the lip gloss (or the plastic takeaway food, i think).

"event","<html>i bought a hamster today. i've been wanting one of my own ever since i moved to uni in september. anyways i went to the pet shop yesterday and they only had a couple there and then i went back today and they'd had a huge delivery!!! they had so many different ones i had a hard time choosing but in the end i settled for this little guy.

<lj-cut text=""more cute pics of boris"">

i was so scared that he'd die on the way home. i had to catch a bus home and the journey took 20 mins and it was quite a bumpy ride. i felt so cruel cause he was just in this little box he must have been really scared because when i took him out he'd peed in the box. he's very young (only 6 weeks) and i think he's quite confused about all the things in his cage. he loves the wheel, i caught him sleeping in it earlier!!!

"event","<html>rant: i really hate it when people think they can tell me how to do my job. i've been piercing ears at claire's for nearly a year and a half and i really don't like it when people interfere with the process and don't trust my judgement. i had this smelly old posh cow come into the shop today and she wanted a re-pierce on one lobe and a pair of second lobe piercings done too, no problem, that's like 20 mins work. at first she seemed polite but after about 5mins i realised her and her friends were a bunch of childish and rude snobs. she basically wanted a re-pierce on one ear cause it had ripped out (http://risks.bmezine.com/?Cheese-cutter_Effect). i asked her what had happened and she said that it had just happened over time until it eventually fell out! what kind of idiot would let that happen to their ear? anyway i was explaining the aftercare instructions because most people haven't got an idea how to look after a piercing properly and she just wasn't listening, which is the height of rudeness (she didn't listen to me when i told her the prices either, i had to tell her 3 times). then i asked her to put her name, address and signature on the form and she commented that you don't need this much paperwork to buy a house! wtf not where i'm from. then came the dots she just wouldn't take my advice on placement and in the end she insisted that she could do it, how rude, i felt like giving her the gun too and saying, 'you think you can do better than me? then go ahead, bitch.' anyway she did the dots for the second holes completely far apart on one side, it was so bad i could have spotted it from across the store. anyway i pointed this out to her so that she couldn't blame me for not piercing on the dot, she wasn't too happy about that. anyway i did all 3 peircings without a hitch and just as i predicted the piercings were completely uneven. she spent ages looking at them in the mirror i think (hope) she realised that they looked shite. she's probably the first person i've ever seen who could make earrings look crap.

i love my job, i've had my ups and downs with it but i'd say i'm damm good at it. i hate it when people judge you by how you look or what you do. i particularly hate it when people talk to me like i'm stupid, i sometimes feel like i should wear a sign with all my grades on !

"event","<html><body>i bought a really cool book called 'tokyo: a certain style' and it's full of pictures of tokyo apartments. it's amazing to see how every bit of space is filled with stuff. i have a very small room so i'm used to having very little space but some of the pictures make my room look huge.  i'm going to be moving out on friday so i guess i'm feeling a little sad about that because i've had the same room for 10 years.

"event","<html><body>i'm in a really strange mood today cause i'm bored with myself, there's loads of thing i could have done but just couldn't be bothered and ended up reading quotes on the internet. here's some of my favs:

""The first step to getting the things you want out of life is this: Decide what you want."" Ben Stein

""The purpose of life is to fight maturity."" Dick Werthimer

""Idealism is what precedes experience; cynicism is what follows."" David T. Wolf

""Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; but remember that what you now have was once among the things only hoped for."" Epicurus

""It is better to be hated for what you are than to be loved for what you are not."" Andre Gide

""Always remember others may hate you but those who hate you don't win unless you hate them. And then you destroy yourself."" Richard M. Nixon

""To be stupid, selfish, and have good health are three requirements for happiness, though if stupidity is lacking, all is lost."" Gustave Flaubert

""Inside myself is a place where I live all alone and that's where you renew your springs that never dry up."" Pearl Buck

""The worst loneliness is not to be comfortable with yourself."" Mark Twain</body></html>"

"event","<html><body>i really love piercings and people always want to know why my piercings are so important to me.  it's very hard to explain but i feel like my piercings are part of me, to the point that their absence is more noticeable to me than their presence.  so when i look in the mirror i don't see a girl with loads of piercings, i see me.

i know that my belly piercings are crooked but i love them anyway.

friday marked the 3 year anniversary of my eyebrow piercing and although i've got a lot of scar tissue around the bottom hole and it gets sore quite often i have no intention of taking it out.

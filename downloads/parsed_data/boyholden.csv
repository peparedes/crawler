I remember when I was about 4 years old, I sat on my parents beat up old love seat with a yellow plastic bowl in my lap. I wore my favorite white footsie pajamas with the football players on them, and my hair combed to the right of my head. I sat there still, with an yellow bowl full of fish in my lap. My father would clean out the fish tank once a week, and it was my job to make sure that the fish didn't try to escape the bowl. If a fish went over board, it was my job to make sure it didn't harm itself and die. 

I was never sure what I was supposed to do in case of such an emergency. Was I supposed to put the bowl down and catch the escaping fish? (But what if the others jumped ship while I was attending to the lone jumper?) Was I supposed to yell out for help, ""Daddy! Daddy! Look the fish is running away!""? (Wouldn't I be failing my father by asking <i>him</i> to catch the fish instead of catching it myself?) Because I was never sure of the answer, I made sure that those fish would never dare to escape. It was up to me to show them who was boss. I would roll up my sleeves and prepare to teach each one a lesson they would never forget.

'See how this feels? This is what dead feels like! Don't like it do you?' I would quickly throw the fish back into the bowl before they really did die, or my father realized what I was doing. One by one I would scoop each fish out of the bowl and hold it inches away from its liquid life and threaten to never let it breath again if it ever thought of making me look like a fool in front of my father. No fish was going to make my daddy angry with me. No slimy water breather was going to make a fool of me.

And then it happened this one day. I held the white fish out too long and it just stopped breathing. Maybe I lost track of time, or maybe it wanted to die, but there it was at the bottom of the bowl wrong-side up. I picked it up and wiggled it a little, but it only lay there still in my palm. 

I think it was today that I felt like that white fish my love. I keep expecting to see your face as I lay here wrong-side up."

"event","Hi baby. I know its been a while since i've written anything, and I could give you one million reasons as to why i've neglected to...but they would only be reasons, and not really any valid excuses. I tried to write last night, but after one sentence, I felt finished and retreated to sleep.

I dont know what I want anymore my love. I feel like a fraud. My desire to ever find you is all but diminished, and the thought that I have no back up plan frightens me. What shall I do, If not love you? Where shall I find solice, if not in the dream that you are searching for me too? I'm just so goddamned lonely! 

If you want to know the truth, these days i just want to be left alone. Things were so much easier before you. I was my own person, with my own life, no one to haunt my thoughts. 

Im sorry that I sometimes doubt our love, but I just get so goddamed lonely. Nevermind what I just wrote. Before you, I was my own person, with no life, and not very many thoughts at all."

"event","love, i cant say this gets any easier. 

i've picked up a lover along the way. but i assure you, there is no love there. 
only kisses in public that dont fit. not like you. you and i. 
we exchange embraces, but never share them. and i've already grown tired of pretending.

when do i get to brush away the soft hairs that creep above your brow? whisper the words to our favorite song and watch you smile silently? i realize that sex without you is nothing more than the moment. nothing more then orgasm and silence. 
heavy and loud silence. 

no love, this is not easy."

"event","ive been real busy my love. ive been listening to songs i could play for you. ive been watching movies i know you'd like. the other night, i even pretended what it might be like to be you. to have such beautiful skin the color of almonds. to know that i had someone who loved me more than he loved breathing. i do baby. i love you more than breathing. i'd hold my breath for two whole days to prove it. 
sounds silly huh? 
my mother used to always say i was a silly boy. maybe she was right. i don't think its silly that love is everything to me. if you ask me, its silly to pretend that it is'nt. who does'nt want a set of arms to embrace them, or fingers to toy with their  hair? what's better than waking up and seeing the light bounce off of your face? i cannot imagine beginning each day without hope in my heart. much the same way, i cannot fathom a night where i don't fear never finding you. maybe its this fear, and not the hope, that keeps me going each day. 
when i find myself deep in thought, i sometimes hear soft piano playing off in the distance. im not sure what to think of this. maybe its the sound of my broken heart. perhaps melody heals, and not time? when i hear it, its your hands i see against the ivory keys. how i wish your hands could give me the same focused attention. surely, you'd  hit no sour note. 
maybe its all the songs i've been listening to baby. i don't want you thinking i'm crazy or something. you know how i hate it when people call me crazy. <i>Fuck them!</i> the only thing i'm crazy about is you. so what they think does'nt really matter does it? i wish i could write you a song baby. something you could hum in secrecy all day long. a melody you could rock yourself to sleep with until we meet. hell, i'm no song writer. i write stories. maybe i'll write a story about a piano. 

i love you. you get me. maybe you love me back."

"event","baby i think i dreamt about you last night. i'm almost certain i did. i know when i closed my eyes, you were the last thing on my mind. I squeezed my eyes real hard while i thought of you, because i wanted to make sure you were in my dreams.
then i realized, that you're only in my dreams. 
but i know you're out there my love. and i know you get me. now i just have to hatch a plan. i'll close my eyes real tight. you'll see. real tight, like i do when i want to dream about you. 
i've been writing stories. i would'nt call them autobiographies. people might. people might say, 'Is this story about you young man?' But not you. You get me.
i thought i'd share part of one with you. Would you mind?

<i>I mostly remember her sitting at the end of the kitchen table. Her soft black curls were pulled back into a bobbed pony tale, and her shirt was missing a button on the right pocket. She concentrated solely on the beans she sorted on the cutting board. Her hands, rough and almond colored, delicately combed over the pile as though it were braille. 
""The most important part is finding the bad beans. You have to make sure not to let any of the bad ones get past you. Not one. It's VERY important!""
My mother was so passionate about everything. She had rules for all the things that were important, and another set for all the things that were'nt. Things were always 'very important' to my mother. 
Now, I struggle to care about anything. My hair is always dirty, and my fingernails are overgrown and an embarrassment. I rarely care what people think, and i never worry about the bad beans. </i>

I hope you did'nt mind. I love you."

"event","i close my eyes and remember the shape of your hands. your nails round and smooth as pebbles. how i wish you were here now to press a single finger against my skin. to trace and smooth away the sting in my palm. 
i want to create something with you. something we can both admire and allow no one to destroy. a love that defies category and a longing which burns us where we stand.
i believe it is possible. i'm hatching a plan, i really am. 
you're the only one who gets me."

"event","no one understands that it's a need. the more i try and believe that they are right, the less it all makes sense.
i know that i should have enough to occupy my life. i've been through drastic changes. new environment. new everything.
but i constantly only care about finding you. i dont care where you are, or where i am. i need to hold you. because laying in your arms will make the buzz dissapear.
the buzz scares me. so see, it's a need. 
i love you and all that you can heal."

<br />
If you want me to create a custom style for your livejournal (or blogger or anything) please leave a comment or contact me somehow.<br />
<br />
Which brings me to my next point: I am going to try and start up a legitamate web-design/consultant business. It will be small and probably very, very slow to start, but I have access to a lot of important things via my current job. (like credit card machines, printing facilities, design software and hardware) (maybe even a wacom tablet for christmas!)<br />

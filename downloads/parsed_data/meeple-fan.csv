"event","So, it&#39;s been a few years since I last posted.
My life has changed dramatically, and I&#39;m too tired to really get into all of the changes right now.
Mostly, I just wanted to check in and say hi, I&#39;m not dead. I&#39;m on Facebook and post regularly there. That&#39;s the best place to keep &quot;up-to-date&quot; on me and my life, although I&#39;m trying to also check in to Google+ and Twitter now, too. Of course, checking all of these places means you&#39;ll be reading the same basic thing over and over. And Facebook is probably the most thorough place to keep up with me.

Then again, there may be bits of info out there that I only share in one place or another, depending on who I want to know about it. For example, my family doesn&#39;t get access to LJ.

Anyway, heading to bed now. Hopefully, I&#39;ll post again soon."

"event","I&nbsp;just finished reading <em>1776</em> by David McCullough, and am amazed (though I&nbsp;shouldn't be)&nbsp;at how little I&nbsp;knew about the Revolutionary War.&nbsp; I'm not sure if it's because History has always been a weak subject for me, or because we moved around so much when I&nbsp;was a kid, or I&nbsp;just had a lot of really bad teachers... I&nbsp;suspect it's a combination of the three.<br /><br />For example, I honestly always believed that the signing of the Declaration of Independence following the Battle of Bunker Hill marked the end of the war.&nbsp; In reality, that was closer to the beginning of the war.&nbsp; I&nbsp;don't think I'd ever heard of the Treaty of Paris of 1783 before.&nbsp; I&nbsp;knew Washington crossing the Delaware was a big deal, but really had no clue why.<br /><br />I&nbsp;remember studying a lot about the parts of the Revolutionary War that took place in New England, but nothing else.&nbsp; Perhaps that's because I lived in New England for all of elementary school?&nbsp; (My high school US&nbsp;History teacher was a JOKE- he'd come in, give us an assignment, then go to the teacher's lounge to smoke and drink coffee.&nbsp; On my final exam, as two members of the cabinet, I&nbsp;listed peas and carrots, and got the question right.&nbsp; So, being in Las Vegas for high school didn't help counter my poor elementary school education).<br /><br />I&nbsp;feel really dumb now, and know that there's a LOT of stuff I&nbsp;either mislearned or never learned at all, and feel like I&nbsp;should get to studying.&nbsp; Maybe I&nbsp;need to pick up a math book and read that for a while, so I&nbsp;feel less dumb?&nbsp; Work some calculus problems... *sigh*<br /><br />"

I&nbsp;finally broke down a short time ago, after realizing that my current crocheting project wasn't working out the way I&nbsp;wanted it to, and then taking it all apart.

Part of it is because I wish I&nbsp;was at the Gathering, but most of it is because I'm scared that the pain will never get better, and I'll never be able to enjoy a game convention again.&nbsp; Both of my arms have started tremoring, although it's very slight most of the time.&nbsp; It only seems to get bad when I'm having a panic attack.&nbsp; Fortunately, now that my Effexor is regulated a bit more, those seem to be mostly under control."

"event","Some of you may know some of this stuff from Facebook, some may not.

I have a new doc, who is *NOT*&nbsp;Lyme Literate, but she freely admits she has no clue, and is willing to refer me to whoever I need to be referred to.&nbsp; WOOHOO for small steps!&nbsp; She did re-run the Lyme tests, using the lab company most recommended for Lyme tests, and the tests came back positive.&nbsp; Actually, positive is a Lyme titer of &gt;1.09; my titer was 1.98, and considered &quot;HIGH&quot; by the lab company.

I&nbsp;look a bit like Rainbow Brite these days- my legs (mainly the thighs, but the calves are becoming involved too) and upper arms (again, my lower arms are becoming involved) are all blue, red, yellow, green, and purple from the Lyme lesions, and I&nbsp;have a really fabulous looking one just above my left breast.&nbsp; (This shows that not only is the Lyme active in my system, but it has become disseminated, which is actually bad news in terms of the progress of the disease, but good news in terms of doctors' willingness to believe I&nbsp;actually *HAVE*&nbsp;Lyme).&nbsp; The lesions are painful and itchy; I've been told the name of some stuff to get for them, but I need to 1) remember the name (it's in an email somewhere) and 2) figure out where to buy the stuff and 3) get one of the boys to take me to said store, unless I&nbsp;can order it from online.

I&nbsp;tried calling the first person I&nbsp;was referred to, but they don't have any appointments available in February, and won't open their schedule for March until the 25th.&nbsp; I&nbsp;haven't yet decided if I'm going to wait or try to find someone else.&nbsp; If anyone knows of any GOOD&nbsp;Infectious Diseases specialists, particularly in the Cobb County area, PLEASE&nbsp;let me know, so I can look into them.

Hmm... maybe I should call CDC while I'm at it, just to see if there's anyone there who wants me to be their guinea pig.&nbsp; Since I'm allergic to all of the traditional treatments, I'm going to have to go with experimental stuff anyway.&nbsp; Might as well help the CDC out while I'm at it.

Tim, Patrick, and I&nbsp;spent Valentine's evening together, which was very nice.&nbsp; Tim made lasagna (using my recipe- I&nbsp;love that the guys liked my lasagna enough to ask for the recipe), and Patrick made molten chocolate cake for dessert.&nbsp; Then we played Dominion, which my friend Paul sent me for Christmas, after finding out that I hadn't really gotten anything for Christmas.&nbsp; We've played this game several times, but my brain is so foggy lately that I&nbsp;couldn't really remember how the game worked, even though I'd taught Tim and Patrick how to play.&nbsp; *sigh*&nbsp; Still, I&nbsp;had fun, and the game never really felt totally familiar- I&nbsp;had to keep asking if I&nbsp;was doing things correctly- but it was okay.

I'm VERY&nbsp;lucky that Tim and Patrick have seen me on really good days, as well as on very bad days, so they are getting used to when I need help and when I&nbsp;need to work through stuff on my own.&nbsp; They are also excellent at helping me remember words.&nbsp; Even more important than that, is that they ACCEPT&nbsp;me, regardless of what kind of day I'm having, and they seem to enjoy my company.&nbsp; I&nbsp;can't express how grateful I&nbsp;am for that.

I think that most, if not all, of the people who read this blog are also very accepting of me, regardless of how well I'm able to communicate on any given day.&nbsp; :-)

I've been working on several crocheting projects, but had to start one completely over when I&nbsp;ran out of yarn and couldn't find anymore of that brand and color.&nbsp; I'm not sure if I&nbsp;like the new yarn I&nbsp;chose or not, but I'm going to continue working on the project for awhile before I&nbsp;decide for sure.&nbsp; I&nbsp;actually have 5 or 6 projects in the works right now.&nbsp; I'm a bit surprised by how well I've taken to crocheting, but it's fairly relaxing, and gives me something to do while I'm watching TV.

I've been doing lots of reading lately, trying to catch up on a BUNCH&nbsp;of series that I've started over the years.&nbsp; So far, I've caught up completely on one, and on two others, I&nbsp;haven't been able to find a copy of the most recently published books, but I'm caught up other than that.&nbsp; I've been reading a lot of &quot;cozy mysteries&quot;- mysteries where the main character is an amateur sleuth.&nbsp; Light, fun, easy reading.&nbsp; I've also been reading some erotica and some paranormal.&nbsp; I think my book count is around 22 read so far this year.&nbsp; My average is usually 52 a year, so I'm WAY&nbsp;ahead of that right now.

I&nbsp;watched Dollhouse last week, and thought it had potential.&nbsp; I&nbsp;really like Eliza Dushku and Amy Acker, which helps.&nbsp; I&nbsp;saw during a commercial that Summer Glau is on a show, but I'm not sure what show that is, I assume whatever is on right before Dollhouse, so I'll have to look into that.

And there's a new Nathan Fillion show starting in March, I think called Castle, but it's on at the same time as Heroes.&nbsp; Since I usually wait until Tuesdays to watch Heroes with some friends, this shouldn't be a problem, but I'm hoping I&nbsp;don't forget to watch the NF&nbsp;show.

Can anyone explain to me why the federal government gives a rip whether televisions stations broadcast in digital or not?"

I&nbsp;apparently have &quot;1 or more&quot; herniated discs in my neck.&nbsp; The doc didn't tell me which discs or even how many, just that I&nbsp;need to see a neurologist asap.<br /><br />Then he gave me a prescription for a stronger version of percocet... which I&nbsp;promptly developed an allergy to.&nbsp; The sad thing was, despite the itching, I&nbsp;actually felt almost human (if somewhat stoned) for a day.<br /><br />So, I'm back to being miserable while waiting to go see a neurologist.&nbsp; I&nbsp;haven't called to make the appointment yet... I didn't feel up to it on Weds or Thurs while dealing with the itching, pain, dizziness, and nausea.&nbsp; And I slept almost all day Friday.&nbsp; So I will hopefully remember to call tomorrow.<br /><br />I'm hoping they can actually *DO*&nbsp;something about it... there seems to be a lot on the internet about lumbar herniations, but not as much about um... cervical? herniations.&nbsp; When I&nbsp;think of cervical stuff, I think of girly parts, so it seems weird to have my neck be cervical, but I think it is.<br /><br />Some days, I&nbsp;have pain that radiates down my arms and I&nbsp;can barely feel my fingers.&nbsp; Other days, like today, I&nbsp;can feel my fingers, but they hurt a lot, especially when I&nbsp;type and such.&nbsp; And lifting anything is problematic... I&nbsp;have a gallon jug of milk that is probably about half full in my fridge- I&nbsp;needed both hands to lift it, and it still hurt like hell, all the way into my skull.<br /><br />My Klonopin is helping to keep me calm, which seems to make the pain ... not really go away or less noticeable, but I'm less worried about it, I&nbsp;guess?&nbsp; I&nbsp;don't know how to explain it... I&nbsp;cry less and feel less scared if I&nbsp;take my max dosage of Klonopin daily.&nbsp; That's something I've never done before, and I don't like doing it, but it also helps me sleep, and I think sleep is important right now.</lj-cut><br /><br />In other news, I&nbsp;finally got a DVD player, and my friend lent (loaned?) me his TV, so now I&nbsp;can watch movies, which is a nice change of pace.&nbsp; I can sit and crochet for hours, and my chair is so comfortable... I&nbsp;got it at Goodwill for $5.05, and I&nbsp;have to say it was worth every penny!&nbsp; It doesn't provide neck support, but because of the support it does provide, my back actually relaxes a bit, so no spasm while I'm sitting in that chair!&nbsp; I&nbsp;just wish I&nbsp;could sleep in it... lol<br /><br />Last night, I watched National Treasure 2 and Stardust.&nbsp; A friend of mine moved to Texas, and gave me a HUGE&nbsp;stack of DVDs... she'd bought multiple copies by accident, or bought them to watch them just once or whatever (she comes from money), and she just didn't feel like packing them up and taking them back to Texas with her.&nbsp; So, I'm slowly going through them, and sending some on to my sister for her kids.<br /><br />The rest will eventually be posted on www.swapadvd.com, so I&nbsp;can turn them into other movies!<br /><br />I've finally watched all of Heroes Seasons 1 &amp;&nbsp;2, and the first 5 episodes of Season 3.&nbsp; Such a good show... I'm surprised it didn't go the way of Firefly, it's so good.&nbsp; But, I'm glad it's still on, and I hope it stays on for a good long time!<br /><br />"

I&nbsp;did move some things to Monday, simply because they could wait and I&nbsp;just don't feel very well right now... I've had an upset stomach for the last 2 days, and my sore throat seems to come and go.&nbsp; I&nbsp;think I'm coming down with a cold or something.&nbsp; blech.

Still, I've alphabetized and shelved my books that have authors whose last name begins with A-F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I&nbsp;can start the task of figuring out which parts of series I'm missing, so I&nbsp;can adjust my wishlists on paperbackswap.com and other places as needed.

The last few things I&nbsp;have to do today are wash dishes, empty the cupboards in the kitchen and bathrooms (they are doing a &quot;heavy duty&quot; pest management treatment on Monday), find a good resource for example cover letters (I&nbsp;hate writing them!), and write a generic cover letter so that I&nbsp;can just use that, with minor tweaking, as I'm applying for jobs.

For tomorrow (Monday), I&nbsp;need to do laundry, try to find a primary care physician, and whatever else comes up that needs to be added to the list.

Tuesday is my interview with the temp agency, so hopefully I'll be back to work within a week or two!!!

Other things I&nbsp;need to get to as I&nbsp;have time:&nbsp;sort through my games and adjust my list at boardgamegeek.com, sort through my CDs and adjust my list at swapacd.com, and sort through my DVDs and adjust my list at swapadvd.com.&nbsp; These will all have to wait until I&nbsp;get more furniture- shelves, TV, etc.

It's all about taking baby steps!!"

Are you as sick in your stomach as I am at the thought of Sarah Palin as Vice President of the United States?<br /><br />Since Palin gave her speech accepting the Republican nomination for the Vice Presidency, Barack Obama's campaign has raised over $10 million dollars. Some of you may already be supporting the Obama campaign financially; others of you may still be recovering from the primaries. None of you, however, can be happy with Palin's selection, especially on her positions on women's issues. So, if you feel you can't support the Obama campaign financially, may I suggest the<br />following fiendishly brilliant alternative?<br /><br />Make a $5 minimum donation to Planned Parenthood. In Sarah Palin's name. A Planned Parenthood donation is tax deductible, while a political donation isn't.<br /><br />And here's the good part: when you make a donation to PP in her name, they'll send her a card telling her that the donation has been made in her honor.<br /><br />Here's the link to the Planned Parenthood website:<br /><a href=""https://secure.ga0.org/02/pp10000_inhonor"">https://secure.ga0.org/02/pp10000_inhon<wbr></wbr>or</a><br /><br />You'll need to fill in the address to let PP know where to send the 'in Sarah Palin's honor' card. Use the address for the McCain campaign headquarters:<br /><br />McCain for President/Sarah Palin<br />1235 S. Clark Street<br />1st Floor<br />Arlington, VA 22202<br /><br />Feel free to send this along to all your women friends as well as your men friends and urge them to do the same.</lj-cut>"

I'm always happy when I&nbsp;see them do well... they sucked REALLY&nbsp;BADLY&nbsp;when I&nbsp;was in school... like 1 win a year bad.&nbsp; Of course, that 1 win was often against our arch rival, the Ducks, so it was the only one that counted.&nbsp; I&nbsp;remember attending many a game and while leaving, hearing a lot of comments like, &quot;well, at least we hurt more of their players than they did of ours...&quot;&nbsp; Sad, but true.

I've been having LOTS of weird dreams lately, and it doesn't seem to matter whether I've taken my night time meds or not.&nbsp; I was going to share the latest, since I&nbsp;remembered it in detail upon waking, but now I&nbsp;can't remember it.

The news about WaMu has me annoyed and nervous, since that's my bank.&nbsp; Not sure if I&nbsp;want to deal with Chase or not... might be switching banks sooner rather than later.&nbsp; Oy.

Not sure why I've started saying oy a lot, either.&nbsp; I&nbsp;know it's my abbreviation of oy vey, but not sure where I&nbsp;picked it up or why.

I feel like I've been battered with a 2x4 or something today... and I&nbsp;have a sore throat, which is a sure sign that I'm coming down with a cold or that my Lyme is acting up again.&nbsp; Since the Lyme has been acting up recently anyway, I'm thinking it's a cold... the sore throat is too late to announce the Lyme thing.

I&nbsp;have an interview with the local Office Team office on Tuesday... I&nbsp;hope I'm awake enough for it... lol.

If I&nbsp;remember the other stuff I&nbsp;wanted to ramble about, there'll be another post later today.&nbsp; Otherwise, I guess this is it."

"event","Thanks to <lj user=""drlaurac"">&nbsp;, I was able to attend Anime Weekend Atlanta this weekend, and I had an incredible time.<br />Strictly speaking, I'm not *into* anime, but I'm not really *not* into it, either.&nbsp; That is to say, the little bit I'd been exposed to prior to this weekend I've really enjoyed, but it isn't something I've sought out on my own.&nbsp; It's more something that people have said, &quot;hey, let's watch Ranma 1/2&quot; and I've said okay, and watched.&nbsp; And, more importantly, enjoyed.&nbsp; (Ranma 1/2 is probably the only anime I could name prior to this weekend).<br /><br />After this weekend, however, I&nbsp;can say that there is a lot of stuff out there that really catches my interest.<br /><br />Luckily, my friends Tim and Patrick were willing to go to AWA with me, and Tim convinced me to use a wheelchair to get around.&nbsp; We went on Thursday evening to pick up our badges, and I&nbsp;used my crutches.&nbsp; Just one time around the main floor of the event had me so exhausted that I&nbsp;agreed to the wheelchair, even though I&nbsp;*really*&nbsp;did not want to use it.&nbsp; In the end, I'm glad I&nbsp;did, because I was so exhausted and hurting so much that by Sunday, I&nbsp;was done.&nbsp; I&nbsp;slept most of Sunday.<br /><br />Anyway, after Tim and Patrick got their badges on Thursday, we went to find <lj user=""drlaurac"">&nbsp;, so I&nbsp;could get mine.&nbsp; She invited us to stay at her party, and the guys were fine with it, so we hung out for awhile, listening to random stories that various people had to tell.&nbsp; It was also cool to meet some new people, and to visit with people I've known for awhile.<br /><br />On Friday, we headed over around noonish, and wandered around.&nbsp; I've been to game conventions before, but I've never been to a convention quite like this... there were a lot of people wearing costumes, and some of the costumes were *really*&nbsp;intricate.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have no clue who the vast majority of the people were supposed to be, and some of the ones I&nbsp;recognized I just didn't understand why they were there.&nbsp; For example, I&nbsp;was a bit surprised to see people dressed as Disney princesses, as well as the guy dressed as someone from the original Star Trek.&nbsp; But, the costumes clearly made the people wearing them happy, and it was rather cool to see people getting that into the weekend.<br /><br />On Friday, I also experienced the true aroma of &quot;con-funk&quot; for the first time.&nbsp; At gaming events, I've smelled what I'll now think of as just plain poor hygiene, because the con-funk is a completely different beast.<br /><br />I&nbsp;spent quite a bit of time in the dealer's room, looking at various things, and even bought a couple of Manga books, as well as a picture for my wall.&nbsp; I went back on Saturday and bought some posters as well.&nbsp; And some rubber duckies!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />We also spent some time at different panels, which were sometimes entertaining, and sometimes not so good.&nbsp; One panel in particular, we left early, because the presenter was clearly just not prepared, and as a result, allowed someone in the audience to derail the presentation.&nbsp; This was too bad, because it was one of the few that I&nbsp;thought could have been really educational for me.<br /><br />On Saturday, Tim and I played an RPG called Anima.&nbsp; I&nbsp;had a good time because I&nbsp;enjoy your basic hack 'n' slash type games, which is what this was.&nbsp; However, as Tim pointed out afterwards, the game itself was very grindy... there were a lot of die rolls and referring to tables and whatnot.&nbsp; And character creation was a bit rough, simply because there wasn't enough time for the GM to really explain the game itself.&nbsp; In the future, I would recommend that the RPGs use only pre-generated characters and spend the &quot;character creation&quot; time explaining how the game works.&nbsp; Especially since Anima hasn't even been released in the US yet.&nbsp; Still, I did enjoy the time spent there.&nbsp; We also each got 3 small prints, to thank us for playing, and the GM gave us snacks and these really bizarre drinks that you had to have some level of skill to open.<br /><br />After Anima, Tim and I joined Patrick in the Yaoi After Dark room, where there were some people playing Who's Line Is It Anyway.&nbsp; I bought a few more prints, and the artist of the prints said hello.&nbsp; Sadly, I didn't catch her name, and I&nbsp;can't read it on the prints.&nbsp; But, she's very talented, and I love the pictures I&nbsp;bought.&nbsp; I'll have to buy some frames for all the artwork I&nbsp;got this weekend!<br /><br />Something else I&nbsp;learned this weekend is that wheelchairs are a major pain in the ass.&nbsp; Nevermind the fact that they are very difficult to roll on carpet, but most of the bathrooms in the hotel were impossible to get into.&nbsp; Many of them had these little lip things that were in the doorway, and they aren't tapered to allow for wheelchair access.&nbsp; In several bathrooms, the &quot;handicap accessible&quot;&nbsp;stalls had arm holds, but there wasn't enough room to put the wheelchair in the stall and close the door.&nbsp; Throughout the event, people would simply walk into the chair, or cut in front of me, bumping into my bad ankle.&nbsp; But, there were just as many people who were extremely helpful... one guy working with <lj user=""drlaurac"">&nbsp;'s team showed us a back way into the ballroom, so we could avoid the majority of the crowd.&nbsp; Of course, I immediately forgot how to get to that back door, which made it less than useful, but at least the guy tried- it was *my* fault that it wasn't useful information.&nbsp; Another random staff member saw me struggling to roll my chair on the carpet, and actually took me to the dealers room, for which I&nbsp;was very grateful.&nbsp; Countless staffers had con attendees stop so that I&nbsp;could go in and out doorways, which was also nice.&nbsp; And many of the dealers went out of their way to make sure I&nbsp;could see things and felt comfortable viewing their wares.&nbsp; To the few who didn't have enough room in their stalls for me to check out their wares, I can only say that it's their loss.<br /><br /><lj user=""belecrivain"">&nbsp;wheeled me to and from dinner on Friday night, with a few of her friends taking turns pushing me, which was very much appreciated.<br /><br />I'm definitely looking forward to next year's event, and I hope to be able to help out for it!&nbsp; And, by next year, I&nbsp;hope to be able to recognize more than just Disney princesses, pirates, ninjas, Star Trek guys, and Pikachus.<br /><br />"

"event","Last night, I&nbsp;did not sleep well at all.&nbsp; In fact, including the ~2 hour nap I&nbsp;got this afternoon, I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;might've gotten about 3 hours sleep in the last 2 days.

It started by me getting what I&nbsp;consider to be proof that a good friend's online relationship is based on nothing but lies.&nbsp; I&nbsp;gave this chick more than enough rope to hang herself, and she hung herself multiple times over, IMO.&nbsp; So, I'm worried about my friend, because even though he's an adult and needs to make his own decisions, I'm not sure he has all the necessary tools to protect himself properly.&nbsp; Then again, maybe I'm just overly jaded.

Regardless, a lie is a lie, and I&nbsp;fretted all night about what to say, how to say it, whether to say it, etc.

I finally started drifting off to sleep when I&nbsp;heard what sounded like some heavy object being thrown against the stairs in the apartment next door.&nbsp; This was immediately followed by a lot of yelling, and what was clearly a woman crying.&nbsp; Then I&nbsp;heard what sounded like blows being thrown, and connecting, each time with the woman crying out a bit louder.&nbsp; And, I heard their puppies crying, as though someone was hurting them as well.&nbsp; When my apartment shook from some object (I&nbsp;think the woman, to be honest) hitting the wall, I&nbsp;called 911.&nbsp; I&nbsp;waited up, to see if the cops came, but I&nbsp;never did hear them arrive.

It's possible the couple left or I&nbsp;just did not hear the police.

Today it has been more or less quiet over there, although the puppies have been crying off and on (I&nbsp;think they're being kept in a cage), and an occasional door slamming.&nbsp; Plus lots of running up and down the stairs, but I suspect that that might be someone packing their things.

I&nbsp;have eaten 2 sandwiches today, and feel like I'm going to throw up at any time.&nbsp; I&nbsp;hate that feeling, and wish I&nbsp;could stick my fingers down my throat to get it over with.&nbsp; Alas, that has never worked- I&nbsp;can stick my entire fist into my mouth, with the fingers down my throat, and I don't even start to gag.&nbsp;

Besides the nausea, I&nbsp;just feel pretty much numb.&nbsp; Except my neck and left shoulder, which have had that kind of burning &quot;I exercised too much&quot; feeling since my workout on Tuesday.

And, even though I'm feeling exhausted, I'm not sure I'll actually be able to sleep.&nbsp; But I&nbsp;need to try."

"event","I finally have my internet hooked up, I'm in my apartment, and things are starting to fall into place.

A quick synopsis of the last 3 weeks:
I rented the van to move on I think July 28th or 29th.&nbsp; I loaded 1 thing in it, jumped out of the back, and went down hard.&nbsp; I've badly sprained my right ankle and badly bruised my left foot.&nbsp; Probably not terribly surprising, all things considered.

The injuries delayed me being able to pack things into the van, and made the drive down very painful.&nbsp; I ended up leaving a lot of stuff behind that I wish I could've brought with me, but almost everything that was left behind is replaceable.

I arrived in Marietta on August 2nd, and had to apply for a new apartment, as the one that had been held for me was rented out on Aug 1, when new management took over that complex.&nbsp; The application process took longer than normal, because the apartment complex I ended up in had a lot of applications, due to a special they are running.&nbsp; I finally was able to move in on August 7th; I stayed in a hotel until then.

My apartment is awesome... it has really high cathedral ceilings, the bedroom and full bath are on a loft (I think I said that right... they are upstairs, and I can look from the bedroom into the downstairs).&nbsp; There's a walk-in closet upstairs as well.&nbsp; The kitchen is relatively small, but it's big enough for just me, and there's a breakfast bar.&nbsp; The living room is big and spacious, and there are 3 huge windows, plus a sliding glass door.&nbsp; I even have somewhat of a patio, although it's mostly covered in leaves right now.

The cats are doing well, and seem to like having two floors to hang out on.

I still need to get a lot of things to replace stuff left in Hell... a couch, a table and chairs, a TV, VCR/DVD Player, and shelves.&nbsp; Lots and lots of shelves.&nbsp; Plus a microwave, pots and pans, cooking utensils, pot holders, etc.

But, things are coming along nicely.&nbsp; And now that I have internet access, I can more easily do my job search stuff, which will hopefully put the last few bits into place."

"event","I sold a lot of my games to the NC contingent; enough to warrant a trip down there to hand-deliver them, so I could get rid of more games, make sure they arrived timely and intact, and have a bit of a road trip, which is something I've been needing.

Even though I live by myself, every now and again, I need to just get lost in my thoughts and GO somewhere, without distractions.

So, last weekend, I packed up my car with 5 plastic bins full of games, and headed south.&nbsp; It was a beautiful drive, with lots of lush greenery and wildflowers.&nbsp; I was able to go pretty fast a lot of the time, which was nice.

I managed to pick up some color, through the windshield.&nbsp; I've been told that you can't tan or burn through the windshield, but I've burned before through the windshield, so I think it can be done.&nbsp; Regardless, now that I'm home again, my freckles are far more prominent than they've been in quite a while.&nbsp; I like my freckles well enough, but I really wish they didn't make my arms and face look dirty.&nbsp; I want to scrub the skin off both my arms and face because they look so dirty.&nbsp; When they are more muted, they kind of look cute, I think, but not so much when they are dark, like they are right now.

Shortly after crossing the border between Indiana and Ohio, I ran over a bird.&nbsp; I felt really horrible, as it was the first time I've run over a critter, but the damned thing flew right under my tire, and I didn't have time to stop or slow down or anything.&nbsp; And the noise it made as I drove over it was a bit disturbing.&nbsp; Later on, I saw a dog that had been hit and killed by the side of the rode, and that was more heart-wrenching than the stupid bird.

Other than the roadkill, the trip down was basically uneventful, but it was a long drive.&nbsp; Still, I enjoyed it, and was even able to find some good tunes to sing along with.&nbsp; At one point, I did think I was lost, so I stopped at a gas station and asked where I was, and how to get to where I wanted to be.&nbsp; It turned out that I wasn't lost at all, but I was in Whitsett, NC.&nbsp; That's someplace my paternal grandfather always wanted to visit, but never had the opportunity to do so.&nbsp; It made me feel all warm and fuzzy to know that I was there for him.

I got to the game store, where I'd arranged to meet most people, handed off games, then went off in search of a place to stay for the night.&nbsp; The hotel I stayed in was okay, but nothing special.

The next morning, the other two people I had games for came to the hotel to pick them up, and that was it.&nbsp; Actually, only 1 came to the hotel; the other met me at the Waffle House right next door.&nbsp; To get to the hotel, you had to go through the parking lot of the Waffle House, though, so close enough.&nbsp; 

David was the one who met me at WH.&nbsp; I adore this guy, because he's smart and funny and has a cute accent.&nbsp; And it's always nice to just visit with friends, so I enjoyed the time we spent eating.&nbsp; While sitting in the restaurant, I realized that I hadn't even let our friend Gee know that I was heading down there, though, so I felt a little bad about that.&nbsp; But, I guess Gee is busy getting ready for his wedding, which just seems wrong somehow.&nbsp; Gee just doesn't seem like the getting married type, but obviously he is... lol.

Anyway, after eating, I headed back north.&nbsp; At some point in WV, I missed a turn, and went an hour out of my way.&nbsp; Once I realized I was no longer where I was supposed to be, I stopped at a gas station.&nbsp; The guys there were really nice, and assured me that it wasn't my error, it's because the state hadn't marked the roads very well, and a lot of people missed that turn.&nbsp; I don't know if that's true or not, but it did make me feel a little less stupid.&nbsp; Especially once I got back to where I needed to be, and saw that it indeed was not marked well.

I drove on for another hour after that, going through a few tunnels (which is NOT okay... I have issues with being strapped in and stuck into any kind of tube) and then deciding that I had had enough for the day.&nbsp; I was on the verge of panic because of the stupid tunnels (I would've taken off my seat belt, but didn't want to risk getting ticketed for that), and was still pretty wiped out from the trip down, so I found a hotel and spent the night.

The internet service was out, and my cell phone had died, so I felt pretty bad about not being able to let people know that I was staying in a hotel overnight, but I'm sure they understand.

I woke up really early in the morning, then hit the road again.&nbsp; I continued to enjoy the scenery on the way back to IN, then managed to get lost in Columbus, OH, of all places.

And my ego is just big enough that I thought sure I'd be able to find my way out again if I just kept looking for some familiar places, since I've been there so many times.&nbsp; Well, I did find some familiar places, but due to construction, it wasn't helpful.&nbsp; After driving around for nearly 2 hours, getting more and more frustrated (though admiring the beautiful houses), I finally stopped and asked for directions.

I was 3 blocks from the highway I was looking for.&nbsp; So, I guess I *almost* got myself unlost... lol.

Anyway, the rest of the trip was uneventful, but it was nice to have so much down time to just let my mind wander.

Next up: moving to Georgia!&nbsp; I'll be heading down there sometime next week... it's coming up fast, and I still have a LOT to do!"

"event","Okay, Legal Aid wasn't much help today... if I wanted to stay in this trailer, they could help me.&nbsp; But, since I want to move anyway, they think it's best that I do that.

The problem is, I don't have the money to move.

I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY want to move to Atlanta.&nbsp; I'm quite certain I'll be able to find a job there, especially once I actually *GET* there.&nbsp; Not many companies will pay for Admin Assistants and such to relocate.

So, here's what I'm thinking- I'd love feedback, regardless of whether it's positive or negative...

If I can sell my entire game collection, or at least the bulk of it, that should cover first month's rent plus deposit.&nbsp; I should have enough money to cover the cost of a U-Haul and gas to get down there.

Even better, if I can sell my games to people in the Atlanta area, I will still have access to playing them, and I won't have to worry about storing them!&nbsp; This seems like a decent idea.&nbsp; Obviously, there are games I'd want to keep (Zoff, for example), and my game collection would probably grow again over time.

Also, I'm thinking that I might ask a few of my trusted friends down there to look for an apartment for me... give them the things I *need*, price range, etc., and find my apartment that way.

So, what do you all think?"

Tomorrow, I go see Legal Aid, to determine what, if anything, I can do about my trailer.&nbsp; I'm guessing there won't be much, but maybe they'll know an attorney that wants to take these slum lords down.&nbsp; My sister thinks I should bring in samples of both the hot and the cold water, so they can smell the difference between the two (I think there's something growing inside my water heater, which is why I get physically sick every time I use the hot water).&nbsp; That seems like a lot of effort for a first appointment, plus I would think they'd want to get the sample themselves.

I've started reading Pillars of the Earth, finally.&nbsp; It's a good read so far, but I'm only about 80 pages into it.&nbsp; I have a hard time just sitting and reading anymore... I suspect because every time I try to do that, it seems to start raining, then I get pissed off because every room in my house leaks via the windows, and I can't figure out how to make it stop leaking.

My camera is charging, so I can take some pictures for my Legal Aid meeting tomorrow.&nbsp; I'm going to leave them on the camera, so they know I haven't altered them in any way.

I've joined Freecycle here in hell.&nbsp; Actually, I joined it some time ago, but lately some of the requests coming through have been just plain silly.&nbsp; Yesterday, one e-mail that came through had a subject line of ""Wanted: G String"".&nbsp; Um, who would want a G String through Freecycle?&nbsp; GROSS.&nbsp; But then I thought that maybe guitars have G strings or something, but I was still too disturbed to open the e-mail.&nbsp; Today there was one: ""Wanted: Golf Clubs"".&nbsp; From what I understand, golf clubs are pretty spendy, so I just can't see someone just giving their golf clubs away, but good luck on that wish.&nbsp; There was also a request for a Trampoline.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing I haven't seen that would make me laugh harder than any of the above would be: ""Wanted: Dildo"".

"event","For awhile now, I've wondered whether mail had gone missing from my mailbox.&nbsp; I know my landlord freely opens my mailbox to put things in there (which is a felony, according to the USPS), and there have been things that I've expected that just never showed up.

Things like my gas bill and my electric bill.&nbsp; Now, I've called the gas company in the past, and they have supposedly sent out copies of my bills, but I've never received those, either.&nbsp; My electricity was originally in the landlord's name, and I had to pay a huge deposit ($200) to get it switched over to my name, and the electric company had lost paperwork, so I knew that was delayed, and was therefore not concerned about it.

Today, I got to the mailbox before the landlord had arrived at the office (the mailboxes are across the street from the office), and I found not one, but TWO gas bills.&nbsp; One is the current bill, and the other is a disconnect notice.&nbsp; So, clearly, the gas company has the information for my mailing address correct in their system.&nbsp; I called the gas company, and they've noted my account, and we've made payment arrangements... really not a big deal, I just wanted to make sure they had it on record that I've only just received my ""first"" bill.

I also discussed with the lady the fact that my furnace is hot to the touch (as in, I could burn myself on parts of it), and she indicated that there was definitely something wrong with it.&nbsp; Of course, prior to moving in, the landlord told me that there was a problem, and it needed to be fixed, but then she later said the problem had been fixed.&nbsp; I'm guessing it was going to be too costly, and she thought I was just too dumb to figure it out.

When I got home from running errands this morning, I noticed that sometime since Friday, a note was slipped under the light on the outside of my trailer.&nbsp; I've been home all weekend, and nobody ever knocked, which is a bit annoying.&nbsp; Anyway, the note is from the landlord, addressing the issue of water quality out here, and whether it is drinkable or not.&nbsp; It's in the form of an FAQ, and the second answer says that people with compromised immune systems may have problems with the water.&nbsp; Hello?&nbsp; Lyme Disease here!&nbsp; This is information I should have had *BEFORE* moving in!

Luckily, I'm smart enough that I could tell something was wrong with the water, and I haven't been drinking it.&nbsp; I shower only when I can't stand my own stench anymore (so as not to trigger another dry heave bout that landed me in the ER a month ago), and I use mouthwash to rinse my mouth and toothbrush.&nbsp; Hell, I even give the cats bottled water, because I don't want them drinking it, either.

Attached to the water thing is a notice that our rent is going up $10/month.&nbsp; That's okay, though, because it will increase their income, so an attorney will have more to go after them for, because I'm fairly certain this is headed to a legal battle."

I'm REALLY upset about this, even though I know it's the right decision.

On top of the other stuff going on making it difficult for me to breathe, I now have a horrible chest cold and my asthma has come back.&nbsp; The whistling in my lungs keeps me awake at night, and when I'm laying down flat, it hurts A LOT from the costochondroitis.&nbsp; So, I've been taking lots of Nyquil to help the cough and to actually sleep (thankfully, that stuff knocks me out still).

But, I've been in a sleep for 5-6 hours, awake for 4-5 hours pattern for a few weeks now.

Everyone I know is urging me to apply for permanent disability, and I suspect a doctor would, too.&nbsp; In fact, the doctor in RI suggested I might get to that point within a few years from when I started seeing him, because that's just how advanced Lyme and Fibromyalgia work.

I WANT to go back to work, but just don't know how I'll be able to do it right now.

If anyone has any suggestions for how to find a decent-paying stay-at-home job that I could do as I'm feeling up to it, PLEASE let me know!"

The people who renovated it did a piss-poor job of it, so I'm slowly fixing the stuff they didn't do well.&nbsp; For example, I had to sand all of the cupboards in the kitchen because it just wasn't done.&nbsp; It's not that it wasn't done *well*- it just wasn't done at all.&nbsp; So my kitchen is done, except one cupboard that I can't get to anyway (they installed the oven to close to the counter to be able to access those cupboards).&nbsp; I put in some cute sunflower contact paper, which makes me smile when I see it.

Now I just need a kitchen table and some chairs, and I can put out my place mats and salt and pepper shakers.&nbsp; I'm very excited about these things!&nbsp; For once in my life, I actually have a color scheme to my kitchen!&nbsp; It's tropical fruit colors... lime green, lemony yellow, and orange.&nbsp; Or tangerine, depending on your point of view!&nbsp; With just a dash of watermelon thrown in for my sister, who REALLY wanted me to do the whole thing in pink.&nbsp; Blech.&nbsp; Watermelon was my compromise.&nbsp; Why do I care what my sister thinks?&nbsp; Well, I'm planning to leave this home to her and her kids in my will.&nbsp; And I'm trying to convince her to move up here.

My living room is mostly done, although it's a mess right now.&nbsp; There are a few places on the wall that need some fixing, but I have to figure out how to fix them.&nbsp; And of course hang pictures still.&nbsp; Eventually, I'd like to get a decent computer desk as well as a new couch and TV.&nbsp; For now, I have hand-me-down stuff with a comforter and sheet thrown over it.&nbsp; And a crappy TV that I never watch anyway.

That's as far as I have gotten.&nbsp; I still need to build in my bookshelves and gameshelves in the library/game room, and get a table and storage supplies for the hobby room.

The bathroom, which I'm doing in a rubber ducky theme, still needs to have its cupboards sanded, and I need to install some shelves.

My bedroom is more or less done as well, although the closet needs to be fixed and I want to paint the dresser I have.&nbsp; And hang some posters or something up.

Nothing is really unpacked yet, because I'm STILL working on fixing all the shit the renovators didn't bother to do.&nbsp; Stuff like sanding the edges of the cupboards so I don't get a bazillion splinters in my hands.&nbsp; And repairing/refinishing all of the shelves.

Don't ask about the toilet, because it just pisses me off right now.

I got a new bed yesterday, though, which is awesome because my old bed was a piece of shit and not at ALL comfortable.

Went to the Gathering for about 3 days, saw lots of friends (and, unfortunately, the fucktard from hell and his bitch- pisses me off that she was there, but whatever), had some good food, and played some fun (and some less-than-fun) games.

Doing lots of reading, playing on ToonTown, playing in the Games Forum on www.paperbackswap.com, and working on my house.

Somewhere in there, I'm also looking for a job, although I keep hearing the same thing over and over (""you have to go through a temp agency""... I don't want to work through a temp agency anymore, but will likely have to bite the bullet sooner or later... *sigh*)

In other news, the combining of celebrity names when they start dating is normally annoying to me...

Bennifer
Brangelina
TomKat
... and others that I just can't think of right now.

But, one occurred to me today that I would like to see made more common.&nbsp; I made it up myself, and find it amusing...

Tom Brady + Giselle Bunchen = Gisom.&nbsp; Say it out loud, it's fun.

Sorry if I've offended anyone by combining an RIP with an attempt at humor."

      You are Spice.

You're not from around here, are you?  You're extremely valuable.  While you resemble mundane cinnamon, you are much more interesting.  People fight wars over you, but your giant worms protect you.  

You enlighten people; make them aware, prescient, even clairvoyant.  Your pure essence can reveal people's true selves, if they survive their encounter with the real you.  You're addictive, dangerous, seductive, and above all else, necessary for space travel.

Apparently, there are some Star Wars ones (I've seen these- they are supercool) and some Transformers ones.&nbsp; 

I think they'd make great cat toys, not to mention adult toys.&nbsp; The looked like a lot of fun when I saw the Star Wars sets."

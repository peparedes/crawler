"event","So I am still alive... and sometimes I feel only barely so. 

Falling into the doldrums during summer is a bad feeling but I shock myself awake in true resurrective style after ending a bad week on a high note.

Getting my 37.5 hours in at Big Grocery Chain Corporate Office, I left work at around 11:30AM on a Friday and drove straight home. Got the mail and received my bill for my testicular ultrasound. Cringing, I opened it up and winced at the amount of zeros. 1-2-3-4 zeros. How am I going to pay this off? I looked again and realized that the four zeros had a period in the middle of them. 100.00 bucks for an ultrasound without real insurance? I'll take that. Thank YHWH in the most literal of senses that it is only that amount and not much much more. Also, I am pretty glad to not have testicular cancer.

For those of you who missed out on the fun, I spent March through the end of April holding on to my testicles. I woke up one morning with pain and pressure downstairs eventually went to see my general MD about the whole ordeal. He gave me a testicular examination (without laughing at my weiner!) and found no cancerous lumps by touch. Then he proceeded to inform me that what I had was epididmytis. Infection of the tubes downstairs. Now, every time I have to go to the doctor I freak. I panic. I literally cry. Why? I have no idea. Prior to this experience, I haven't had much history with the medical community to obtain a negative view of them. Sure, people go into surgery for appendicitis and come out with one less testicle. But happen in every profession, right? So, back to the doctor's visit. I freak out. I ask him what it is and he says some people are prone to get it from heavy lifting. I tell him the heavy lifting I do at work consists of holding my burrito close enough to my face so I can bite down on it. He asks me if I am sexually active or ever have been. I tell him no, because, well, I've never had sex. He says he can safely and awkwardly rule out sexually transmitted diseases. He gives me a weeks supply of Anthrax-inhibiting Cipro and sends me on my way with a handshake and a talk. He relates to me as a person and not as a revolving door cash cow. 

I leave. I take my pills. I feel better. Then I feel worse. Then I feel sick. So I go back to the doctor. He checks me out again because I am in panic mode. I haven't held my testicles so much in my life. The left side aches with a dull pain and I swear they are getting hard. He says he still thinks its epididmytis. I go a third time when my 14 day Cipro pack runs out. He schedules me for an ultrasound and prepares me for the worst by giving me a conversation from the heart. He says he still does not think it is cancer, but we better be sure. I go to the urologist and he walks in the door, tells me to drop them and refers to my testicles as ""nuts."" He makes me laugh and checks them out. He thinks its the same thing but schedules for me to get an ultrasound. Christina goes with me (my beloved) but not into the room (awkward) and a kind technician lube me up and scan me. She leaves so I can change and I look at the monitor. On my left testicle are two dark spots. I resign my fate to cancer, put on my pants, and leave. I wait a few days and get a phone call telling me that I have spermatocele (sp?) cysts, they aren't cancerous and not much else is conveyed. I get on Mayoclinic.com and WebMD.com and read up on it. The consensus? I am producing too much sperm (or not releasing it often enough...!) and the dead soldiers in my pants have formed cysts. 

And that is the short of the story! Add in lots of late nite sleeplessness, stress headaches, bargaining with God, and panic attacks and that was me for about a month and a half.


However! Back to Friday. I come home from work completely jaded. I applied for another position that will make me another 200 dollars a week but will still never make me happy unless I am dealing in the hookah/shisha culture, Firearms, or non-profit Gospel work. However, we do get glimpses of joy given to us in our lives. I set up my brass cored hookah, sat on the back porch of the house I am currently living in and smoking cinnamon flavored shisha for two hours. I felt at peace and content. Amongst the doldrums, I experienced the resurrection of life. My problems, irrational concerns, rational concerns, and general malaise of existential living was temporarily lifted. It was nice. I enjoyed the (rare) beauty of a summer valley view into the Ohio River. I had cinnamon on my breath, a good buck in hand and thanked YHWH for my ability to experience the limited divine through sensory. 

Whether or not the world was created or by accident, I can never be 100% certain. In times like these, to experience the divine among the doldrums, is worth the price of being unhappy for the majority of my existence. Whatever spark of the moment, whatever serotonin chemicals were coursing through my brains, or a combination of both, I felt good. I'd like to feel that way all the time. C.S. Lewis wrote about his encounter with a realization of the divine. He called it being Surprised by Joy.

"event","So, the saga of me continuing the journey of Corporate America continues...

The harder I try to get fired from a job, the more promotions and things I seem to get. Now, if only I could get culpable insurance from someone. My bro, Kenny, has encouraged me to apply for the Royal Bank of Scotland, since they have an office in Cincinnat. He works for them and gets amazing pay and benefits. But, I can't stand working in corporate America. Being physically lame, however, makes it hard to have an over-physical job. 

Which is yet another reason to open up a gunstore... or a hookah bar. Either would make me incredibly happy. Or give me the illusion of happiness.

So, I got made moderator of the www.hookahforum.com . This is exciting. 

What else is new? I got an AR-15. 

BLAM BLAM! 

I haven't shot it yet because I've been sick for around three weeks of a lung disease. 

Back to studying the Historical Jesus. 

I will quote you two perspectives of the historical Jesus out of the same book (Jesus as a Figure in History by Mark Allen Powell that EVERYONE Deist, Theist, Christian, or none of the above should read).

1. ""I do indeed think that we can now know almost nothing concerning the life and personality of Jesus."" - Rudolph Bultmann

2. ""We can know quite a lot about Jesus; not enough to write a modern-style biography, including the colour of the subject's hair, and what he liked for breakfast, but quite a lot."" - N.T. Wright."

"event","Hello! From the nudging of others, I have decided to try and write an entry without flipping out and succumbing to the pressures of life and freaking out. After all, if I can't tell my secrets on a blog, what good is it? 

I'm closer to being finished with the make-up work I've had to do to graduate. I'm almost completely finished. 

I've been sick for about three weeks with respitory problems. I haven't been to the doctor because I dont have insurance. However, my stance against free health care still stands. I'd rather pay more than what I make in a week to go to the doctor than be taxed out the ass for shoddy health care. 

Tomorrow I sign a contract extending my tenure with Big Corporation (TM) until late spring / early summer. I'm getting screwed over because I'm taking a Supervisors position without supervisors pay but the experience will be good for me. Or at least Adam Smith tells me it will be.

I've become uberapathetic in my approach to everything lately because all I do is sleep and go to work, come home, and spend another four hours on homework or sitting and bitching about not wanting to do homework. I hate it but not enough to change ( this is a reoccuring theme ). 

I'll probably move back to Columbus before the end of the year because I am mostly tired of Cincinnati. I have one (major) reason to stay here and that is Christina. The rest of my time here has been a complete waste with the exception of friends and relationships I have developed.  Other things I have developed are sensitivity to pollen from pollution, a lot of debt from student loans that I'll never be able to pay off. Also, that Hebrews has no author but that it does not matter who wrote it if I enjoy it.

I listened to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's 1963 ""Freedom"" Speech today. I think I will try to listen to it at least once a year ever year, for the rest of my life. Its that good. Its so foreign from the political speeches given today where people are bitching about restricting rights and freedoms of others instead of fighting FOR freedoms and rights for others. All hail the nanny state.

I'm really tired. I'm going to go to bed because my posts look more and more like someone who has a disassociative personality disorder than cojent orderly statements. 

I love you all and maybe one day I will learn to love you more than I love myself."

"event","So, today, I write about the college career of formal and structured Biblical Education that I will soon to complete. 

I went into theology thinking that I could do something to change the world, and I have not.

I did not expect to have all mysteries explained or solved, but I did at least expect to understand some things. I have a better understanding of the divine and the way that theology works, and for that I am thankful and hopeful, but I still know next to knowhing.

I wanted to actually succeed in something and maybe have someone recognize the potential that I thought I had, but two things never happened in the course of my ""acedemia"" at school. The first is that no one recognized the talent I have. But I would be a liar among men if I did not acknowledge the fact that I have little or no talent in expressing the divine and that my explanations of God do not do any form of justice to the existence of God. I feel sick to my stomach knowing that I, for once, completely tried my hardest to succeed at something and did not succeed. This is the second half of the dicussion as to why no one recognized me as being something special... because I am not. I gave it my best (generally speaking) and I suppose that should count for something, but if nothing happens because of it then I suppose it does not matter. Whatever fairy tale or parable has the main character pretending to be something of great importance while really only making an ass of himself, seems to fit me better than any other story I could pretend to tell as my own. So, with that, in a few weeks I bid my academic career in theology goodbye. If I pass my classes, I will graduate with a Bacholor of Science (ironic) in Biblical Studies. That happens to be a polite way of saying that I was not competent or smart enough to finish a degree in Biblical Studies that had the requirements of mastering a dead language of either Koine Greek or Biblical Hebrew. 

I want to pretend to realize that what I am saying has no specific bearing on the way that I try to follow in the way of Jesus, but it seems that on some level it does. My inability to learn how to publically speak means that what little knowledge I have obtained is hard to communicate to other people and if the message I have demands that I share it with those who are willing to hear it then it becomes a worthless thing if I cannot express it to other people.

So, I might graduate and I might not. Either way, I know that my position in being a part of the kingdom of God does not change. I know that it should be more important to me the way that it is, but it isn't. I hop eone day it is. For now, I'm going to pretend to do homework, listen to sad bastard music, eat more than what I should, and dream about things I'll never have."

Also, Robert Duvall is amazing for the following reasons:

1. In a recent biography Spielberg revealed how Robert Duvall helped to encourage him into making the movie (Jaws). In return Spielberg offered the role of Brody to Duvall but he turned it down, fearing that it may make him too famous as a result.

2. Is a direct descendent of Confederate General Robert E. Lee.

3. Owns a large estate in rural Virginia, where some skirmishes of the Civil War were fought (he has found shells and other artifacts on the property). Some scenes in Gods and Generals (2003) were filmed on his land. Because Duvall is a veteran, upon death, he can be buried in Arlington National Cemetary, of which was taken from ancestor Robert E. Lee thus taking back the family farm. 

4. Fractured several ribs in April 2002 after falling off a horse while rehearsing for role in Open Range (2003).

5. Can speak Spanish fluently.

6. Was in ""To Kill a Mockingbird""

7. On critiquing Hollywood: ""They should keep their mouths shut."" - on Hollywood political activists

8. ""One guy asked me, 'How can you be an actor and be a Republican?'. I can vote either way. But how can you boil it down to political affiliation? All the atrocities against blacks in the South were committed by Democratic sheriffs.""

"event","Passion. When I think of this word and its multiple meanings, it makes me in awe of how far language has progressed. When I say passion, several definition in my mind. I think of someone's favorite thing to do. I think of intensity and of urgency. I think of great defining moments in one's life. I think of a newly married couple. Sadly, I also think of BMW commercials. Somehow, in culture, passion has lost most of its meaning and has somehow become a thing of compulsory ways to spend money people do not have onto vastly and exponentially depreciating investments rather than describing something intense. Be it the object of intensity being a person seeking a degree in something that moves them in a way that nothing else in the world can move them. 

On an existential level, passion has lost a meaning to me in that most motivating factors revolve around bitterness, irritation levels, personal discomfort or situational apathy or the overwhelming selfishness that shatters the vast importance of other people around me.

The complaints of an American are an odd sort. Most of them are forms of escapism, and it manifests itself on several levels. 

Subcultures emerge by defining what you are and what you are not. Take for example the subculture of comic books. Slice the proverbial pie any way you would like, but most of us can observe those very much in to comic books and see a clear corollary between the real world, the imagined world and the gap between. Stories are written revolving around characters that supersede even the most outstanding of humans. Why? Because you are limited by reality where as the character you can identify is not limited by the same rules. Reading about Superman is veiled about wanting to be Superman. If not specifically Superman, then <i>A</i> super-man (or replace with woman where applicable). Why? Because we have all been in situations, regardless of how cool we think we are, where we were helpless or acted as if we were helpless in saving the day, being picked on or wanted to save a girl from a jerk who obviously does not deserve her. Even in our selfishness, we observe that the point of superheroes is not only to save the day but to elevate the morale of those surrounding him or her into being more like a superhero. This psychological escapism has roots in the selfish but births a more noble cause. However, it still deals with an escapism that romances with ideas that are not reality because reality is not at all always satisfying. 

Those into sports do this by projecting themselves as a near-imaginary team member of their favorite team. Listening to conversations of sports fans will use the vocabulary of ""we"" rather than ""the sports team"" or ""they."" Partially for ease to the ebb and flow of conversation but mostly escapism because they want so badly to be a part of the team. After all, great things are associated with being on the team. Escapism.

Heavily prevalent in our society is the dissatisfaction of physical appearances. From 25 dollar tooth whitening sessions to several thousand dollar breast augmentations, if you are unhappy with your genetic makeup, you can change things into an ""improvement"" where your lips are fuller and your nose more button-like. In a country where the average person is fat, and the shattered self image female forces herself in to vomiting after every meal, each person desires the same result. By this, I do not mean altered states of appearance but yet another form of escapism, in a physical sense.

You didn't think I would leave religion out of the picture, would I? Since the beginning of time and maybe longer, in the realm of the mundane and predictable there has been an inate desire to experience the supernatural. Humanity has concocted some pretty intriguing explanations of how the world began, who began it and what purpose it serves. Religion, in its purest form and of the authors intended explanation, is man's attempt to reach out towards the idea of what they believe god, God, or gods to be. This braces us for the existential question that leads to (usually) the existential let down. That is, what we often think we feel has been challenged by what reality has conflicted with what we predicted it to be in the realm of the supernatural. For example of I believe that God loves me, and if I do not existentially feel this love, it must mean that the passion is dead and that God, in His lack of emitting vibes to my spiritual antennae must also be Dead. If passion, for the individual is dead or if its definition has been perverted into being something else other than passion (or the opposite, if buying an expensive car is your definition of passion) one could come to the conclusion that God is dead, especially if that person was passionate about God. If I may be so bold as to interject that logic by saying that our feelings have made us into great liars. How so? If we feel one way, but reality exists in a separate way, which is correct? Reality, time and time again is correct. However, when our brains were hardwired we had the ability to fool it into disregarding evidence (situational and otherwise) this is yet another form of escapism. This time, escapism from truth. Challenge yourself, in specific, your brain to not accept what you feel as being equated with what exists. Escapism is inevitable. For many, including myself, it is crippling. I could name every part of my body, soul and mind and give reasons for loathing all three. But I'll save you the time of day and skip to the point: Passion may feel dead, but it still exists. Sometimes we just need to learn how to sneak back into finding it."

"event","So this was probably the shortest feeling weekend I have ever had in my life. I really did not get anything accompished. I almost quit my job on Friday because I lost my temper on the phone and let some guy have it after he tried to use me for his emotional punching bag. My awesome bosses pulled me off the phone and talked to me about and asked if there was anything going on at home or if there was anything they could do to help, rather than just threatening to fire me.

So I am supposed to think it over the weekend as to whether or not I want to quit and I have yet to come up with an answer and I have just a few more moments before I am supposed to go to work. I buy four seasons of Smallville, so I kind of feel obligated to go. Plus, my year review is due and I get two weeks of paid vacation and maybe a raise. It could have been a huge raise had I not lost my temper. Man, I need to learn control. Or get a new job. Or both!

I can't remember what I did Friday evening. Oh, I went to Kenny Frost's birthday party! I hung out with some friends of friends, which was cool because Kenny has quality friends. One of them even made me bleed! As we all parted ways, Matt stepped on my toenail and broke it from the skin and I am trying to nurse it back to health as some of it has fallen off and has blood underneath the nail and it looks awesome.

Saturday, I helped my roommate Robert move out some of his junk and drove to Columbus to hang out with my father and go to Julia's pool party. They tried to get me as imbibed as one of my other friends was at the last pool party, but I don't succomb to peer pressure. SUCKERS! I hung out with the Sarge and we should have shot his gun but didn't. He has a new (well, from '41) Mauser that needs rebroken in.

Sunday, I drove home, hung out with the symbiant creature TerryandJoy and watched Waiting again. Dane Cook is the best.

I should go take a shower before I go to work, because, well I went to the gym. But then I got chinese, so its like I never actually went. Plus, I'll be hungry in like 15 minutes after I poop. Peace!"

"event","I don't know what it is about heavy computer use and me but I have lost most of my editing skills. I have almost an acquired form of dyslexia that allows me to only type partials of letters to mean words. For example, when I think of the word suggestion I will type sugstin. Also, switching letters while writing by HAND is another thing I've taken up. I hate it and it makes my notes slow-going.

However, that is neither here nor there. I watched Silent Hill as per a professor's recommendation and it was awesome. It was one of the goriest movies I've ever seen and it surely lived up to the expectations. I was pleased at watching this movie. Thus this has sprung the beginning to Man-cation. What is Man-cation you ask? Well, my friend Terry has a wife who is job interviewing in Florida for the next week or so. In her absense, we are immersing Terry in the culture of maleness since he does not get to fly solo often. He loves his wife very much, but there comes a time when you just got to be a man and do manly things. Scratch yourself, smoke cigars, drink cheap (but good) whiskey, throwing sticks, shooting guns and talking like Rocco from The Undergrads are all exceptable ways of being ""manly."" So is listening to Hatebreed (loudly), playing D&D, talking about who would kill who in a fight between superhero x and y. 

Also furthering the great Pirate Vs. Ninjas debate. What side to I take? Well, despite my icon, I am pretty torn as both are worthy adversaries. Maybe pirates win by the edge of a cutlass. They both rock though. I'm not going to be a wuss and promote Pirate vs. Ninja unity though. Someone needs to keep fighting the good fight.

Also, I decided on a Master of Divity thesis, should I ever get into grad school.

A Position on the Homeostasis of the <i>Pneumatas</i> of the Infected Zombie. 

It will discuss the finer points of theology, such as... 

1. Do Zombies have Souls?

2. At what point does the soul reach its final destination?

3. Does the zombie's actions hold the soul responsible for its actions? e.e. If the zombie murders, is th person responsible.

4. Can zombies repent?

5. ... take communion?

6. Is being a zombie a form of Calvin's predestination theory?

Discuss!

A man who died before I was born spoke some of the most intriguing words and dealt with his culture in such a positive force, that his message is still relevant even in ultra-modern philosophy and apology today. On combating bad philosophy:

""As I seek to do this, I need to remind myself constantly that this is not a game I am playing. If I begin to enjoy it as a kind of intellectual exercise, then I am cruel and can expect no real spiritual results. As I push the man off his false balance, he must be able to feel that I care for him. Otherwise I will only end up destroying him, and the cruelty and ugliness of it all will destroy me as well. Merely to be abstract and cold is to show that I do not really believe this person to be created in God's image and therefore one of my kind. Pushing him towards the logic of his presuppositions is going to cause him pain; therefore, I must not push any further than I need to."" - Francis A. Schaeffer."

"event","Ugh. I cannot shake the funk for whatever reason, this season. The job is becoming less and less tolerable. They asked for volunteers to leave early. I left six hours early so I could do homework. I'm trying to be thankful because a.) I was provided a way to finish my Puritan book report and 2.) It was a nice break from work. 

However, I can probably safely say that as much as I wish I did not exist that I have things pretty good. I have a job that I picked in a country where I can move to any of its 50 divisions and I would have very little trouble finding a job in any of them. 

So why am I always suffering from waves of discontent? I could do more for others. I need to. I have a picture of me in high school and I've seen pictures of me taken only a month ago. Much of me wishes I was more like I used to be and much of me is glad that I have changed. Some changes are for the better, I guess. Some are for the worse. That's a part of growing up isn't it? In high school, I worked with the homeless all the time with our youth group. Now, I can barely stand it. When someone comes up and asks me for money, I automatically become defense. I've learned to combat this by actually listening to what they have to say and then if they have a need I can met, I try to. If they don't, I refer them three blocks down to the City Gospel Mission ran by a friend. What discourages me the most and tempts me into becoming even more jaded is the fact that most people want nothing to do with the Mission which makes me think they want no help at all, other than a quick buck. 

Ethics drive me crazy. 

I received some forms today congradulating me for graduating. Oops! That doesn't happen until next semester. I am partially stalling because I have no clue on what to do after school. The pattern of my life seems to do something extremely drastic, become apathetic or antagonistic to it, and then hate it and move on to something else. Example:  Computers. Moved there, did it, hated it and have the carpal tunnel to prove it. Moving to another state with minimal contact from the original state. Repeat. On a whim, go to Seminary... become disenfranchised and want nothing to do with churches or ministry aside from relationship building with others and encouraging others so they don't become disenfranchised and embittered. Is that a word? I don't know. I have to have someone else do my grammar. 

I saw a documentary that made me cry. It's called Beyond the Gates of Splendor and you should watch it.

I watched The Terminal last nite, for the first time, with Christina and our good friend Joy. 

I loved it! I can't believe I haven't seen that movie until now. Christina had purchased it and I have no idea how long she has had it but I've never seen it in her DVD rack before.

In addition to being one of the better movies I had seen in a long time, it was also probably one of the most depressing movies I have ever encountered. I know I often go on overemotional rants about how I am and this one will be no different. If you haven't seen the movie, Tom Hanks plays Viktor Navorski, a citizen of the country Krakozhia. Midflight, his country goes to war and when the plane lands he is a man from a country unrecognizable by the United States which refuses to let him legally leave the airport. 

Half of the movie is comedy and half of it is tragedy in the most classical of forms. Here is a benevolent middle aged man stuck in a microcosm of the United States trying to communicate with his homeland, asking strangers questions in broken english and Russian and crying at monitors of footage of Krakozhia being destroyed by rebels. 

Viktor is trying to fulfill the wishes of a dead man in the most noblest of forms by adhering to legal means and tries to communicate with a message of utmost importance to him that no one 1. understands or 2. cares about. 

I can relate to that.

Dave W.'s wedding went by pretty dang well. People were placing bets on whether or not I would vomit during the ceremony. It was quite santicmonious, or some such word.

It was definiately the wedding type that would be shown on television. It was at the Hilton Hotel in downtown Cincinnati. I was shocked, as I am a slob and not thought to be included in such a wedding.

I saw our school nurse today because I do not have insurance and figured I might as well seek some medical advide. She gave me a paper with foods that should be OK for me to eat with a weak stomach and we talked for a good 20 minutes or so. She was very kind and helpful and being a nurse is probably such a thankless position. Thank you, Nurse Grubbs!

I am soon to be given another fire arm but I am completely torn as to what to get. A nice Ruger GP101 in a bobbed hammer set up in .357 mag would be wonderful, as would another glock to compliment the collection. I really like Kahrs and a local yokel has a CW9 for only a 395 NIB and that is tempting. Dang, I dunno... what can I say, I am a sucker for all three. 

There is more to life, however, than guns. I miss my friends dearly in Columbus. I need to visit them soon. I need to probably plan my life a bit more since I am now officially 25 and have nothing to show for it. I do not mean that in a materialistic way but by virue of the fact that I have not done much to better the community or the world at large. I try to inspire and encourage others to treat everyone better than they deserve. I do a terrible job at it myself because I can be quite mean-spirited, short-tempered and extremely negative. However, if I believe that each person has the finger print of God on them, then I should treat that person with the respect and attention that God himself might deserve. Christina and I had a conversation about this at P.F. Chang's, which she was sweet enough to endure, because she hates Chinese food. Of course, I ate he leftovers. MWAHAH! 

However, back to the topic of spirituality... and the finger print of God and what not. At what point to I attempt to reach those with the Gospel message that I claim to so strongly believe in? I find it such a hard balance between sharing what I hold to be most dear to my life and not being a pushy preachy jerkoff amongst a sea of pushy preachy jerkoffs. I don't preach at people, but I think too often I am terried of saying too much. As a Christian, I believe that there is an internal mechanism that metaphysically convicts each person with the truth of God. This is displayed in morals of the world even in cultures not exposed to Christianity. Murder is always wrong, rape can be viewed in the same light amongst a few other ills of human acts that we are prone to hating as a whole, but still commit (Thankfully not as a whole). 

My conclusion, although rough and not too well explained in livejournal, on practised Christianity is that not many people are interested in what it has to say. I am part of the problem and part of the solution and I am attempting to reconstruct myself into being part of the solutino MORE Than being part of the problem. I think I would actually like to try working in a church again so that I could prove this, but it would not be on any strength on my own that I could obtain such a thing. I have learned to become hopeless dependant on something stronger than me... and though I have learned it both logically, emotionally and spiritually it is still not something that comes natural. Why? Because I like doing things on my own and saying that I build this or that or that I was able to pull myself up by my own boot straps. Now, how do I convince others that no matter how good we think we are, we still need a saviour and do so in a manner that is not condesending, irritatingly exclusivist, or pushy? If ownly I was born a Jew and proselyized later in to Christianity so I could have that fine Jewish wit and logic that causes people to rationalize through their faith and logically come to conclusions. If we could only be more like Jews in our discussions of God. Which is ironic, because Jews do not proseltyze.

I am left eye dominate and right handed so I can either learn to shoot left handed or get eye surgery.

"event","It is Sunday night, school as returned as of a week ago and my work schedule has evolved into matching my new routine. I, in so many words, hate work and I am getting very tempted to jump ship. My eye has been wandering  from where I am currently working at into the occasional ad or ""Help Wanted"" sign where ever I go. Job whoring as some at the office call it. 

I would really like to get a new job and swear off customer service for the rest of my life, but I am not able to (yet) find a means to ditch it. I go to work after a (sometimes) long day at school where I basically get paid to get yelled at by people who complain selfishly and suffer from the self-inflicted debilitating mindset of ""me, me; now, now."" Generally, it is water off of the proverbial duck's back but I am getting sick of it. It pays very well, I work down town (which is cool, but I also hate that), and the people I work with are wonderful. Everyone is nice, friendly and fun to talk to when we aren't talking to people on the phone.

Nor am I saying everyone I talk to on the phone is a moron or an idiot. I've had several people encourage me over the phone when they take the time to treat me like a human and not like a robot on the other end of the phone. One guy even mentioned that since I was in seminary, not sure what I would be doing post-graduation, that he would pray for me. Some of you may shrug that off and say big deal, but the man was sincere and honest. Praying, which is a pretty intimate thing to do, for someone you don't know just seems so nice. 

So, I am looking for a new job knowing that I can't afford to quit. I suppose I could easily find a job if I adjusted my cost of living to be next to nothing, and if I can't find one eventually, I might do it. 

In addition to my back being severely messed up, it has now caused my knee to be messed up. It is bowed inward and makes an odd popping sound when readjusting it. I need to see about buying school's insurance and getting both my back and knee looked at. 

Also, I've started going (consistently) to a church in Westwood called White Water Crossing. It's one of a few churches where people seem as friendly as their slogan provides or act as people in a church should act towards new faces. A homeless man decided to get baptized the second or third sunday I was there, so that was nice to see as well. He greeted me outside this morning, while smoking a cigarette and opened the door for me. 

So, hopefully I'll get insurance with a new job (That would be sweet) and graduate soon. Here's to hoping and praying."

"event","To properly celebrate things like an American, allow myself to give you a detailed list of the things I would like for Christmas for myself.

1. Time to go to the bank and cash my five uncashed paychecks. Should I hold out until I receive one more paycheck before cashing them? I'm not made of money and I am down to a few bucks left in my bank account. I hope I don't lose any of my checks. 

1.5 Someone to walk me through cleaning and decosmolining my Yugo SKS. It is sitting in my closest unloaded in a card board box just begging to be cleaned. It whispers in my ear like Robin William's lame character in Dead Poets Society whispers to children. Only the rifle says clean me instead of carpe diem. A book on my bookshelf says Carpe Manana and if you get that, you get 1000 bonus points to spend any way you like.

2. A used Ruger 10/22. I don't think I want to spend my hard earned money on a new 10/22 because I really don't want to give Ruger my money. Although, as I understand economics, by purchasing a new one I am influencing the market to uplift the resale value of a rifle by a company of cowards. 

3. A plethora of DVDs. I wont list them because I'll probably get impatient and purchase them before Christmas.

4. A used working PS2. I don't have any ethical obligations about purchasing a new PS2 but it is akin to setting fire to one's money as the Ps3 will be out shortly. However, I have several Suikoden games just begging to be played on my entertainment stand.. still shrink wrapped. I should sell them and buy more guns, but they are truly magical games.

5. Tickets to see Enya. Yeah, I said it, you wanna fight about it!?

6. Ammo in 22lr, 9mm, .40S&W or 12 gauge ball or buck shot only, no slugs thx.

7. Maybe a scope for the SKS.

8. A digital camera would be nice. Nothing too fancy, just with at least a 4X optical zoom and preferably Sony. And a GIG of memory. BAHAHHA. I am a jerk.

9. An Israeli IMI Jericho 9/41. To hell with Magnum Research and EAA clones. 

10. A dispensationally excellent IDF hooded sweatshirt with my name in Israeli on the back.

11. A new pocket knife. I lost my bojangled trusty black Gerber. No serrated edges, please. Preferences: American-made Benchmark and Kershaw with assisted opening. 

12. Michael Buble` tickets.

13. A million dollars to restart the animated series The Undergrads. 

14. a Nintendo DS or PSP.

15. Subscriptions to gun rags.

16. A new, small leather wallet. Cows were meant to be worn!

17. Renessiance Armor and monk/ninja robe of death.

18. All the Suikoden soundtracks.

19. A maid."

If it was my mother, I'd not punch her in the mouth but I might poop in one of her Longaberger baskets. You can tell I'm doing homework, because I am posting like crazy, attempting to find excuses to delay the process so I don't go INSANE.

"event","So my updates are pretty sporadic. Nothing new has occured suffice to say that I have finally received my Florida Out of State Concealed to Carry Weapons Permit. After waiting what seemed like forever, I finally received it in the mail. My roommate had spilled tea on the letter and I almost flipped out, thank God the Florida CCW permits are more like driver's license than my Indiana CCW which is literally a pink piece of paper form which I had to cut out the license-sized portion containing my information. It is comforting and assuring knowing that I can now legally carry CCW style in the lame state of Ohio. Now I shall work on obtaining my C&L and eventually dealers license. 

I am getting ever-so-close to graduating and then I will conquer the world. My only problem is that I'll be graduating with a degree in Biblical Studies... which to more than 2/3rds of the population is like getting a degree in Bumpkin Magic Faerie Dust and Toad Stoology. However, the degree program is shifting and I hear it may be called Theology from now on... which makes it sound more stringent than what it is. So, with graduating in mind, what will I do career wise?

Probably what I do now. Work in a marginally unsuccessful job where I complain non-stop but cease looking for jobs to replace my job because I do not expect to find anything better all the while wishing I had a means to open up a fine gun establishment. Work is fine, but increasingly irritating dealing with being yelled at all day. Let this be a lesson to those of you who yell at Customer Service reps. In my entire tenture at Kroger, I've only been apologized to once. 

Speaking of customer service, Game Stop has none. I purchased a game stop card from them for five bucks and it was never given to me. I've been battling customer service trying to get them to send me a new one and i have been promised a contact three times. no one has contacted me and no one has sent me a card. normally, i'd write an e-mail telling them about my negative experience and inquire them that EB games will get my business a little more frequently now... but they are the same company now.

I bought a Gameboy SP and Breath of Fire II. Homework can wait. Finals can wait. Eating can wait, as well as breathing and sleeping. 

I took all my guns with me to a gun show to trade them all. Unfortunately, the crowd was all 65 year old men only looking for old Colts and older S&W revolvers. I took my CZ and literally no one who inquired about my firearms had ever heard of it. This is disgraceful. Some guy wanted to buy DAS GLOCK UBERALLAS but I told him I didn't want to sell it. TRADES ONLY. Apparently, when you say this it does not compute to other gun show members because they all want a cash price. I now know what it feels like to be circled by sharks.

That's about all of what is going on in my world. I'm so tired... but Breath of Fire II is calling my name..."

If you have the time regardless of both your political and religious affiliation, please answer the following questions:

1. Do you think government should legislate morality?

If yes, how do harmonize free speech as guaranteed to us?

If no, how then do we legitimize ""hard"" morals like murder?

2. Explain your feelings on the Christian Coalition of America.

3. What is a healthy balance between government and the rights/will of the people?

I won't respond to those who reply and I am not baiting an argument. I'm curious. Thanks."

"event","ARGH! I called in sick today for the first time. I hate calling in sick because it always makes me feel guilty. The boss-woman I spoke with did commend me for never calling in sick prior to today, so I hope I did not ruin her vision of who I am by calling in sick. I have a death-monkey head cold that will not die. Let's hope it dies in my sleep tonight. 

So rather than listening to people complain like I do at work, you get to listen to me complain. I am attempting to finish a Peter assignment that should have been turned in weeks ago. I do not know if the professor will accept it, but it must be turned in regardless. 

At church this past Sunday <lj user=""foreverkenny"">'s mama told me about a gun shop in loveland that is expanding and potentially hiring. Since firearms is about one of five things I care about consistently, I might see if I can get a job there. I don't know what pay will be like, but the experience will be completely worthwile if I ever want to open up a place of my own. Man. I forgot how nice it is to have a Monday off. Maybe I'll change my schedule again.

Anyway, while preaching the second Gospel of Guns, I was made to look like a completely societial-fringe jackass. However, in my defense, two others spoke up regarding firearms and that made me proud. The general attitude towards firearms seems to be apathy (imagine that, apathy of my generation?!). I'm trying to change that. I gave an open invite to the entire class to go shooting with me and handed out a few private invites for those interested in guns to stop by my house and I would show them my mini-collection (4 handguns, a shotgun and a rifle). I am supposed to go to a gunshow this weekend with one of the kids I spoke with. I hope that goes down. Everyone seems to be interested in shooting guns, until I actually invite them and then they either change their mind or flake out. It's frustrating to know that a school of church leaders can be so fickle. This goes twice for me, because I change my mind on a moment's notice. (Ask Coop, I almost didn't go to VA).

So, it continues. Life, and school (barely). I failed two tests this semester. One right after another. The first was a History of Christianity Test. The second one is a Minor Prophets class. To those of you who have not attended Seminary, I promise there is actual work involved. Think of them as classes about history and oral tradition (if you think of them as fairy tales, humor me for a moment) and there is a lot of information to process. Apparently, I didn't make the cut mentally for the past two. I'll try harder next time, I guess.

I am still trying to figure out if it is worth my time and money to go to Israel. I want to go, I can afford it but I am having a hard time trying to justify it. I should probably get married instead, but that is about 3 and a half times more expensive than a trip to Israel for class credit. Decisions, Decisions. 

I am trying to live more within my means of spending. I have gone to a bout 4 stores in a row without spending any money. However, I still spend money wildy out of control when it comes to eating out. I probably eat out more than I eat inside. Not that I eat expensive meals, but it adds up when 4 dollars is spent at Taco Bell for lunch and another 5 bucks is spent on chinese food for dinner. My gracious girlfriend is always helping me become aware of how much money I waste on food in a tactful manner, but then I become a jerk and criticise her for allowing me to take her out to eat. Joking of course. But I am still a jerk. 

I am still waiting for my out of state Florida license to arrive so I can carry downtown and throughout all of Ohio.

I am also considering purchasing one of the following: A Gameboy(should I spent 10 dollars on an older version Advance, or 110 on a DS?), a Digital Camera(It seems cameras come in two catagories. Bastard expensive and pisspoor quality expensive), an iPod (as soon as I do this, it will spell regret because a new generation will come out and it will be cooler than the last with ten times more features) or an AK varient since the BATF has stopped considering the market to import any ""parts"" for the firearm. Why? Who knows. The ""law"" has no precedent and has never has a blanket recommendation been issued like this before. The worst part: No one cares. I probably wont buy an AK variant (though I deeply lust for one), but I am considering it. Maybe Mom will pick me up another firearm this Christmas. ;)

Anyway, I need to go back to doing late homework. Peace out, ninjas."

Let me explain: I came to college to be a minister. Reality: I was one for a summmer and it was embarrassing. Fact: I've attended four years of college. Fact: I barely have the mental capacity of an 11th grade public school attendee. Fact: Christianity, something very important to me, is also something very embarrassing. Fact: Everyone misappopriates Christianity as an archaic moral code that is forced, rather than reflective of the heart and one's treatment of others. Instead this is often presented as ""how can I force other people to life."" Fact: I am perpetually tired. Fact: My heart is heavy. Fact: I might not go to Israel. Fact: Guns are the only thing that make me consistently happy. Fact: I will never get my firearms license. Fact: one person showed up to my house for trick-or-treating yesterday. Fact: Halloween is my favorite holiday. Fact: People at work think I am anti or non social. Fact: I think I am both. Fact: I am dramatic. Fact: I am now on facebook.

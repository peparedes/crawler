"event","I just have to document that i currently hate my life as a non-smoker. I think it's stupid and lame.

It's not that smoking added so much to my life that i'm really hurting without it. It's just that it was one of my simple joys. 

Being able to sit down, chill out, have a smoke and relax. What was so bad about that? 

And if i had one right now, what would be bad about that? i don't feel any different or better since i quit. The nurse at the clinic (who tells me EVERY time i come in to quit smoking) told me i had gained a few pounds since the last time i'd been there. So it's actually bothering my acid reflux to not smoke due to the weight gain. It's also making me hate my body juuuuust a little more. Thanks ever so! that's real motivation to stay quit.

So i'm saving some money. But i could become a Mal-like occasional smoker and not have it add up to that much. 

So, as much as i am so grateful that everyone is being so encouraging, why is it such a great celebration to quit? 

booooo. i am cynical today. and working in Member Services makes me regret the quit entirely. =P

i just want to go home from work, have a smoke, have a margarita, and go to bed. what is BAD about that!? 

and...AND...even if i quit i can't avoid SECOND HAND SMOKE!! that's just as bad for my asthma. so i can either put it in my body myself or breathe in the shit that's coming off someone else's cigarette or out of their blackened lungs! i mean, COME. ON.

Nicole, I am so sorry that you're having issues with school payments. i had to leave PPU for the same reasons and i would love to cosign for you but i am in debt (school and medical) and my financial situation is much less than ideal, to say the least.

i truly hope that something comes through because you are such an amazing girl with such potential for greatness. fight with everything you've got, my love. there's a way around everything, just remember that. talk to every single financial advisor that you can, there has to be SOME way for you to stay in school. and definitely look into having your status as ""dependent on parents"" overridden. if you can, that may be your ticket out of this shit.

i love you, keep me posted.

Kuten,...god, i don't even know what to say. to suffer a loss of that magnitude, especially suddenly, has to be devastating to say the least. please know that there are so many people who love and care about you and that if you need anything, there are so many people just waiting to help. all my love and best wishes.

and then for the other side of this. to the people who are constantly whining and crying for attention:

GET OVER IT. i'm so sick of the shit and you needing to the the center of attention. there are people with real problems. you have a choice to make. SO WHAT!? everyone has choices to make!

i went to NY the last few months and made the decision to, if i did get a job out of those auditions, leave my mother (the closest person in the world to me) and my mally, who is, quite possibly, the absolute love of my life. guess what? it was a choice. luckily, i ended up with employment here and a performing contract that kept me close to my loved ones until may.

but had i gotten an offer from a touring job first, i'd be gone by now. why? because people have to do what they have to do. i'm still hoping to be gone after may due to my career. because it's fun? no. because i have to do what's best for my career and become more financially stable.

kara will be leaving here in january to move to DC for a change of job/scene and to be with the man she loves. i will miss her more than words can say, but i absolutely support that decision because, in our adult lives, we have to make decisions that are good for us, even if they are not ideal all around.

my point is that we all have tough patches in our lives, but we deal with them and get over it. we don't air our shit to the world so that people shower us with attention, we make tough decisions and deal with the results, good or bad.

i have the honor of knowing a little girl who just had her 39th surgery due to spina bifida. she had her spinal cord operated on last week. the surgery took 12 hours and she had to lay on her stomach for at least 3 days afterward. this baby is a little ray of sunshine. always happy, always upbeat despite the fact that she is paralyzed from the waist down.

still think your problems are hardcore? still think you have it worse than everyone else?

now, i'm not saying that any of us have it all figured out. i know i don't. but i also don't beg for attention from everyone every time i'm disappointed or annoyed.

as marty said a while ago:
""Look, if you feel like no one wants you around, it's because they probably don't. If there are perpetual issues within your circle(friends, lovers, spouses...whatever) YOU ARE AT LEAST PART OF THE PROBLEM.""

i completely agree. and, until this shit stops, i am going to continue to lay low. i am trying so hard to get even my minor shit together and have been so happy and content lately that i can't bring myself to muddy what clarity i have with needless drama.

i also can't understand why anyone would want to perpetuate the parts of their lives that cause them stress! if it makes you upset and frustrated, why would you not want to put an end to that?

i don't know, but i'm done ranting. just know that i love my friends, i do. but when all someone is is a negative force, constantly attempting to bring everyone down with them, i refuse to be a part of that.

my best to all. take care.

xoxo"

become obsessed with it. 

it is seriously the most brilliant series i have ever seen. i just watched the series finale and have now officially seen every episode.

"event","p.s. i have an audition for the CLO Cabaret on Thursday and i have to audition for a STEPHEN SCHWARTZ workshop. 

::vomit::

and...AND...I have to sing one of his songs. such a sickening feeling. for those of you who aren't theater nerds, he wrote Pippin, Godspell, Wicked, The Magic Show, The Baker's Wife, Children of Eden, did the music for Pocahontas, and i'm sure i'm forgetting some.

I am terrified. The thing is, i've never worked for CLO before so it may be hard to get them to notice me and i'm starting to feel even more average than usual in the theater scene in this city.

TONS of auditions are coming up and i really feel that if i don't get anything this year (it's my first year to really audition since i'm not in school, btw) i may just start looking for a new career choice.

i don't know. maybe the one thing i love to do more than anything in the world, i'm just not GOOD enough to be doing more seriously than i have been. like, it can be a hobby, but that's all i can make of it.

we shall see, i suppose. 

but maybe i'll look back on this and smile later when things go better than expected. oh well, no matter how it goes at least i'm finally being honest with myself. i guess. =P

UPDATE: it's 3/15/08 and i looked back on this entry and laaaaaughed. SO i did get work this year. i'm doing ""the incredibly innovative innovators of pittsburgh"" 5 days/week. full time theater work. 

i went to NY to a ""hairspray"" open call and had 2 callbacks for Tracy. booyah. 

and i most certainly did NOT get that Schwartz workshop. also, that was so not the CLO Cabaret. that was the pittsburgh cabaret at the renaissance next to the byham. 

i sang my face off and only doug levine seemed to care even a little. whatever, not every audition matters. 

so yeah, i'm over being intimidated. especially in the PGH theater scene. if there's anything i've learned since this entry it's that there are more people in PGH theater that can talk a good game than can actually deliver.

i would rather deliver than run my mouth about it. but that's just me. =P 

so yeah. that made me giggle."

"event","hm. so what did i write last time? oh that's right. ""GET. OVER. YOUR. SELVES.""

well, i take it back because the person that was intended for did nothing to deserve it. someone else decided to outcast and isolate that person. i love the person who made this decision and understand their anger and bitterness, but please don't choose sides for me, sweetie. 

it's not necessary and now it puts me in the awkward position of ""making amends"" with that person (even though i think we're okay and i did nothing i should need to make amends FOR) and it makes you look petty. so i also get to rectify it while avoiding adressing the fact that it was actually you who took that action. 

whatever you want to do, fine. but keep me out of it. i don't need drama and wish everyone well. i am totally behind you in all your endeavors and want nothing more that to see you be happy and successful, but i won't be a part of your anger against the ""other side"". 

by the way, please stop assuming that everything is about you. i don't speak to you, see you, or worry about what you're doing. you, obviously, don't like me and, i assume, never have. and that is fine. but you don't make a difference in my life. you don't effect me in any way and, frankly, i don't care enough about you to worry about what you do. i don't mean that to be rude, but it's the honest truth. i'm glad your life is going in the direction that you want it to go. that's a beautiful thing. but when i post in MY journal, i say what i feel and it has to do with the people in my life. the people i love (who are sometimes the people i'm upset with and it's not like i don't tell them that in person) and the people i associate with. 

you are not one of them and that's fine. but please feel free to ignore the things i pose because, i guarantee, they have nothing to do with you. you are not a part of my life and it would be a waste of my energy to worry about what you choose to do.

take care, live happy, and stop worrying about what you think other people are saying or thinking about you. it likely takes more energy than you have to waste on it. 

best wishes."

mally picked me up from work and we were supposed to visit steve at his show tonight. but i feel like drowsy, cranky poo so we're just watching myth busters and six feet under instead. this is all good with me.

i'm doing QED all month which is good but it kind of kills what's left of the summer. oh well. me and mal are thinking of taking a camping/biking trip in september so that's definitely something to look forward to. 

sasha is laying on the floor yelling at me. damned loud cat. she's a little snuggle bunny but MAN is she loud. 

and that's about it. just figured i'd throw something on here so i could look back on it and smile at a much later date. 

oh yeah, and GET. OVER. YOUR. SELVES. 

if this does not apply to you, please ignore. i'm just incredibly sick of people thinking that people care about their ""personal"" business. if it was truly personal and you didn't want the attention you would keep your mouths shut. i'm also sick of those who think they're so important that they are getting shit on (like NO ONE ELSE IS) and that people are against them. not everyone chooses sides or wastes energy holding a grudge. just FYI.

again, if this does not apply to you, please ignore.

i just can't wait till this drama calms down. sadly, i see a friend being lost permanently.

Anyway, things have been great.

1. I've been working at Black Magic Tattoo for a while now and it's amazing. I get to hang out with some of my best friends every single day and watch them be brilliant. How much better does it get? =) and I have to admit, I love our customers. Most of them are so great. It's an awesome job and I'm really happy here.

2. I've been dating Mal for about...a little over 2 months and things are great. He's a fantastic man and i'm very very lucky. He makes me smile. =)

3. Mason! Damien and Sue's son Mason James was born on the 27th and he is so beautiful there aren't enough words in the world to desscribe that little guy. He's such a good baby, he looks just like his daddy and they are both absolutely in love with him. Along with everyone else. Man, he's going to be spoiled rotten with all the aunts and uncles he has. 

4. Steve's sister came in for part of the week and just left. It was so nice to meet her and I love her to pieces. I'm so glad i won't have to wait long to see her again as we're all going camping in a little less than 2 weeks. 

5. Just a little note, I just found out that Tim Burton just made a movie version of the musical Sweeney Todd and i had an aneurysm. DUDE, favorite show of ALL TIME. i'm so excited for december!!

6. I miss Kara and Nicole. My girlies. My partners in crime. They make me smile constantly and I wish my work hours were more similar to theirs so that i could see them more often, but whatever. I guess it just makes any time I do get to spend with them that much more...precious, i guess. Man, i'm cheesy. haha

Well i think that's it. Tomorrow I'm working at QED and then guest bartending at Malones Too on West Liberty Avenue so at least i'll make some money there.

hope all is well with everyone."

Bareaoke was fun last night. Ok, i lied, it was the last place i wanted to be, but i was surrounded by sillies so at least it was bearable. I can't wait till Tuesday when i'll actually get more than a few hours of sleep in a night. Cuz work don't start till noon. =) 

Also I've started to become nervous and excited about things to come. This job allows me time to pick up other work if i so choose and i'm now realizing that I have so many options. It's a little overwhelming and really incredible all at the same time. I have a degree (a fake, silly degree, but a degree nonetheless) and now i have the time to just look around for employment that i will enjoy and that's not dead end. 

So yeah, that's pretty big. AND i get to spend almost every day with some of my best friends. and get paid for it.

"event","so yesterday i was having an anxiety attack. i used to have them for weeks at a time, not severe, just enough to make me constantly sick. 

i've really been fighting them off well but last night i was just done. i was super overwhelmed and i couldn't deal with anything. too much school work, too much show, blah blah blah.

so my mom comes over after rehearsal to alter this dress for me since she's a doll. like any other time, i take off my t-shirt and go to turn away from her to take off my bra and she GASPS. 

OH, MOTHER FUKK.

so, for those of you, i got my first tatt last week. it's, like, right below my bra. well, after 5 years of trying to hide nipple piercings from her, i just didn't think about my torso being a problem area. it doesn't hurt at all at this point so i totally forgot it was there. 

so i am absolutely stressed already and mom is appalled at me. hahaha! of course. stupid thursday. so she bitched about it and then it was all good. well, she's still pissed, but she'll get over it. 1 facial piercing and 3 in the torso and she got over those. eh.

THEN I go to write my paper for today and read a document for a debate on monday which i have to do with a group and i figure that i'll be in bed by 3:30 ish and at least get a few hours of sleep.

so i am probably 3/4 through the paper and i'm totally pleased and sleep deprived. well, lappie got a little pissy and started to run slow so i went to close some stuffs. i close my ""research file"" in word very quickly and it asked me if i wanted to save the changes. i tell it no.

...wait...that wasn't...it so couldn't have been...FUKK.

I TOTALLY TOLD IT NOT TO SAVE THE CHANGES I'D MADE TO MY PAPER.

at this point i curled up on my bed, covered my head and sobbed. i was fukking done. and, clearly, there ain't no way to recover that shit. BLAH. Lappie, you've ass fukked me again.

well no, it was totally me, but i was pretty upset with lappie. he suffered my wrath. sad for him. and i wonder why he's never working right. 

so anyway, i pulled an all nighter doing my paper ALL OVER AGAIN. it was a beast. i can't wait for the tenny tonight. i need hugs. 

so yeah. i am tired, but the anxiety is gone so that's a huge bonus. and tomorrow will be silly and sunday is sitz and costume run of the show. guess i'll finally figure out what i'm dealing with costume-wise. arg.

well, that is all. i'm so done bitching.

OH WAIT. kara and i totally compared tattoo rashes this morning. yeah, our tatts are fantastic, but our poor torsos HATE A&D. boo to that. 

ok, now i'm done. COME TO THE TENNYSON TONIGHT!! =) i should be there around 11 due to rehearsal. blah. =P

As i posted a billion times, Friday was my birthday (yeah, i'm a little narcissistic, what??) and it was amazing. it was all i could have asked for and more thanks to my dear and amazing friends. of course, not all were present (maria fell asleep, tasha...well...i dunno...and i couldn't get to maria's party saturday which sucked) but i but it's all good. life happens. 

But i do want to say that saturday was such a ridiculous amount of fun and i have to thank my favorite humans, the loves of my life for that. even kara came out for a bit after FIVE HOURS at Black Magic getting her side/back done. 

now THAT is love. she was also out friday despite the fact that she was beat as hell. i love that girl to pieces. and marty, becca, and mal (and, of course steve, since he works there) even made it to the wee hours of sunday morning and went to the caravan club to continue the madness. 

xoxo <3 for them 

yeah, best birthday ever. of all time, ever. oh, and i never mentioned that dame came out and that's no fair. but he did. and, of course, that's always good. =) 

so right now i am feeling great about the show. i am so excited and i think it will be an incredible amount of fun and hope that whoever can make it will be there. trust me, i hate disney too, but it's pretty darned impressive.

well, i think i'm out. i might actually have to rehearse something...at some point. and i am completely sleep deprived at the moment but too happy to care. =) 

i finally feel right. like i have my life in order, like i am surrounded by love and positive...stuff.

ok...so I start Beauty and the Beast rehearsal on Monday. This should be really painful except that I got a call yesterday from the director saying that the girl i was understudying dropped out and that i am taking her role...

O_o

for serious? well, alright. =) it's a damned good day. yeah, just goes to show that being everybody's bitch pays off once in a while. =) 

aaaaaaaaand...one of the little girls in the show (kellz bellz. =) and i are getting our first tattoos in the next few weeks. that will be lovely. 

ummmmm...panty party tonight. fantastical. 

Saw Abe and Ian's band on Wednesday. well, i heard 2 songs. Damned sound dude at the Moose. oh well, it was like a carlynton reunion and it was more than slightly sickening. ah well, just goes to show that people who aren't worth the oxygen they're stealing from those who deserve it, inevitably, find ways to go on existing.

ha! that was pretentious. and true. =X

aaaaaaaand...i love my friends. with everything in me, i love my friends. it's funny because i've been noticing more and more lately what roles some of them play in my life and it's made me appreciate them even more (if possible).

Kara likes to think she's a badass but she's really quite vulnerable and amazing. but she'll still call you on you shit which i appreciate more than i will ever be able to express.

Nicole gets drunk and loud. that's all. ;) no, actually, nicole is unapologetic and i adore that. she is who she is, it's rare that she refers to something as a mistake. she should teach me.

Ryan has become one of my favorite people to talk to and i admire and appreciate him so much. he is insightful, intellegent and most of all: responsible and has a massive amount of integrity. i have never seen someone so determined to succeed and so dedicated to his family...it's a joy to behold.

Marty is like a ridiculous big kid...but one who cares so deeply about the people around him and who has such a positive outlook on life that you can't help but to be affected by him. 

Becca is such a dear and caring human who, ostensibly, plays the mama a decent amount of the time, but who can still let her guard down long enough to say that her x chromosome is rearing its ugly head. she is so supportive and beautiful that you can't walk away from her without feeling better...about everything...

Kenny...don't go!!

My Crafton Boys...you're like home. no matter how long it's been since i've seen you, things are always the same. i dunno if this is good or bad, but i'll take it. 

Dame is incredible. I haven't met someone who makes me laugh about nothing like he does...well...ever. he is incredibly talented, motivated and will be an amazing daddy.

Sue...well...i don't know sue very well yet, but she's the hottest preggers chick on the planet. =) i do know that she's strong, she's supportive, and that she's kind. i hope to know more in the future. 

satan...welcome back. i'm starting to remember why we were friends in the first place. i'm hoping that this trend continues...ass.

Maria is my absolute and constant rock. she is so selfless (maybe too much so sometimes) and loving and genuinely always tries to find the good in people/situations. she is motivated, hard working, and generally incredible. 

Tash is my party girl. and i love her.

Spike is such a darling boy who i can talk to about anything. he is empathetic, he feels deeply...but maybe not quite as deelpy as Amanda...who is visceral, real, and amazing.  

Leah and Jeff bring me such joy. it's not every day that you meet people who are so genuinely kind right off the bat. they are such caring individuals and i'm happy to call them friends. 

Gary is an ass, but an ass that i love. and jameson, although i talk to her so rarely, is such a sweetie pie and i adore her to pieces.

woah, i just wrote a book. i think i shall title it ""a collection of crazies"". and if you didn't get a shout out, comment me. i'll do it later. you vane bastard. 

well, in closing, my life is amazing. the people in it are amazing. the challenge is amazing. and i am ready to face it. although i might throw up on my shoes which would be sad. 

i love my shoes. =(

yeah, this entry suddenly hit a brick wall.

peace. =P"

So yeah, i just read an old entry about a friend who i was worried i would end up losing on some level. yeah, that happened. for whatever reason it happened, it's truly heartbreaking, but it was almost necessary. but kiddo, i love you and hope you're well and happy. 

aaaaaand i started dieting a while ago and have dropped a pants size. yay. =) i also started running and doing pilates a few days ago. i'm currently sore and feel like an old lady but it's so worth it. my abs KILL. they will be rawkin eventually! and i am starting back to dance class next week. yeah, i'll be dropping weight like WOAH. thank you, little baby jesus! but my mom said my ass was getting smaller last night so that was all i needed. ha! my mom checks out my bum. you know you wish she checked out yours. ;)

to anyone else i've been ignoring, i also apologize. but i really need to buckle down for the rest of the semester and just accepted ""beauty and the beast"" at PMT so i need to be seriously brilliant in school before that starts...cuz after it does, everything is going to be a shit storm. but a productive one, i hope.

My Chemical Romance - Famous Last Words

Now I know 
That I can't make you stay
But where's your heart?
But where's your heart?
But where's your...

And I know
There's nothing I could say
To change that part
To change that part
To change...

So many
Bright lights, they cast a shadow
But can I speak?
Well is it hard understanding
I'm incomplete
A life that's so demanding
I get so weak
A love that's so demanding
I can't speak

I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone 
Honey if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home

Can you see
My eyes are shining bright
Cause I'm out here
On the other side
Of a jet black hotel mirror
And I'm so weak
Is it hard understanding
I'm incomplete
A love that's so demanding
I get weak

I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone 
Honey if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home

I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone 
Honey if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home

These bright lights have always blinded me
These bright lights have always blinded me
I say

I see you lying next to me
With words I thought I'd never speak
Awake and unafraid
Asleep or dead

'Cause I see you lying next to me
With words I thought I'd never speak
Awake and unafraid
Asleep or dead

'Cause I see you lying next to me
With words I thought I'd never speak
Awake and unafraid
Asleep or dead

'Cause I see you lying next to me
With words I thought I'd never speak
Awake and unafraid
Asleep or dead

I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone

Honey if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home

Two and a half months. 

when i said it out loud i realized that i only had that long to be irresponsible, to party when i shouldn't and to enjoy the time i have to sit in classes 3 days/week and just absorb knowledge. 

it made me kind of sad, but excited as well. i love my life, i have amazing friends (and i am weeding out the ones that cause me nothing but heartache. and no, i'm not whining, it's completely my fault for taking it for so long), and i feel that, slowly but surely, i am moving forward.

and i hope to make a big step today. i will update on that later. 

yeah, i have nothing more to say except that i hope everyone is well and satisfied. oh, and it's time for shout outs! cuz i'm awesome like that. if you didn't get one, try harder. =P

k, you never cease to amaze me. your selfless nature and the desire to treat everyone in your life well and fairly is incredible and you should be very proud of the woman that you are. all my love.

t, i don't know what i'd do without you. xo

NAR, how i miss you!! i can't even describe. perhaps i will see you soon. and we will order pizza and watch something ridiculous and i will feel ""shiny"" again. =)

oh, and congratulations, darling boy. i am prouder that i can express in words. =)

i say to you all, if it's getting them done the first time, by all means do it. it's awesome. Second time, i forbid it.

it was practically surgery. scar tissue had to be cut away, the left one was punctured twice and cut before it was decided that it wasn't going to happen. the right one hurts so badly it might come out today. 

oh well, these things happen. and i'm surely glad that i had a really skilled piercer as it was bad enough with him doing it, i can't imagine what it would have been like had he not been as good as he is. there was just a massive amount of scar tissue and no one ever saw it going that badly.

sadness. so i still only have one headlight, but it's all good. i'd settle for none at the moment. and steve stayed over that night since, after a long and painful day, all i wanted was to snuggle. i love that boy. =) i seriously couldn't ask for a better friend...except when he punches me in the head in his sleep. but hey, i'll take it. =P

In other news, i had a callback for West Virginia Public Theater this weekend. I want this show so badly and Bob told me my audition was ""really nice"" so i will be hoping against hope for the next few months. but i really need this show. I have been asking myself lately why i am doing this with my life and, unfortunately, i'm relying on an outside source as affirmation at the moment. I wish that my determination and confidence would suffice, however, that's not quite the case right now. 

ok, done whining. 

oh, irresponsible thursday is on for this week. margarita mama's, lots of drinking, and getting up for work on Friday. You know, like we all did when we were 21, but know better than to do now. It's worth it, believe me. And Kara gets drunk and insanely fun. especially since she doesn't have to drive home this week. ;)

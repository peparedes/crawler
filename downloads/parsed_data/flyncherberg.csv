"event","You know how sometimes you listen to music and you can tell that a band or artist sees their music as a job, rather than as a work of art? I just bought the new Stone Temple Pilots best-of CD (you know a band is breaking up when their compilation is called ""Thank You"") and I'm sitting here, listening to it, and I realized that these guys <I>never</I> thought of playing music as a job. It's almost hard to believe anyone could be this good.

Bye guys! We'll miss you..."

"event","From Ann Coulter's latest nutcase column:

""The only Democrats who go to church regularly are the ones who plan to run for president someday and are preparing in advance to fake a belief in God.""

Yeah, I personally remember attending the Redwood City methodist church when I was 7 years old and thinking ""Heh heh... this'll <I>really</I> fool those stupid God-believers when <I>I</I> run for president."" I know that my parents were also thinking the same, as were my grandparents (all Democrats who attended church regularly).

If I remember correctly, Beth's parents are registered Democrats. And I thought they were the most pure and Christian people I knew... but it was all a hoax for when they run for president! Damn, coulda fooled me... So Bethy, when are we going to see the Weber-Weber ticket? It's a little late to run in 2004... will they run in 2008? And how will they decide who runs for president and for vice-president? Normally, in our society, the man would take first place and the woman would be behind him, but your mom seems pretty assertive. <I>Judith Weber in 2008!!!!!!!!</I>

Seriously, though, why do Republicans let Ann Coulter speak for them? What an embarrassment."

"event","So I still love movies. Four months after quitting the video store, I still love movies, and I watch them all the time, and I go to them as often as I can (or as often as I can afford to). Did you know that on the Internet Movie Database you can create an accoutn for yourself and make a list of all the movies you've seen, want to see, or want to buy? I'm only up to 200-something on my list of ones I've seen. I'm sure I'll surpass 1,000 when it's all said and done.

Anyway, since I love movies so much, here's my top 10 list for 2003. If you don't want to read it, you're welcome not to.

(Also keep in mind that, like I said in my previous entry, there were a <I>lot</I> of movies I missed in 2003. Sucks for me, I know, but I'll catch them on video.)

1. <I>The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King</I>
2. <I>Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl</I>
3. <I>Miranda</I>
4. <I>The Man Without a Past</I>
5. <I>Confessions of a Dangerous Mind</I>
6. <I>Kill Bill, Vol. 1</I>
7. <I>May</I>
8. <I>Once Upon a Time in Mexico</I>
9. <I>The Italian Job</I>
10. <I>The Shape of Things</I>

Every year at the Cannes Film Festival, the runners-up are awarded a special ""jury prize."" My jury prizes for 2003 go to <I>Freaky Friday</I>, <I>The Hulk</I>, <I>A Mighty Wind</I>, <I>Phone Booth</I>, <I>Spider</I>, and <I>21 Grams</I>. These movies are not any better or worse than each other; you could say they're all tied for 11th place.

If you haven't seen any of the above movies, I highly suggest you do (though a few of them -- <I>Kill Bill</I>, <I>May</I>, <I>Once Upon a Time in Mexico</I> -- are quite bloody). But if you're looking for movies to avoid, there are plenty of those too. Ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce David's top 5 <I>worst</I> movies of 2003...

1. <I>The Real Cancun</I>
2. <I>Jeepers Creepers 2</I>
3. <I>Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life</I>
4. <I>The Matrix Reloaded</I>
5. <I>American Wedding</I>

Though jury prizes go to <I>The Core</I>, <I>Daredevil</I>, <I>Dreamcatcher</I>, <I>Malibu's Most Wanted</I>, and <I>The Matrix Revolutions</I>. Avoid these movies at all cost; they will hurt you."

"event","Okay, so as I'm sitting here, sipping a nice smooth glass of amaretto (mmm... amaretto) I notice my keys are sitting on the floor, over on the other side of the room. Mine. Mister I-just-got-home-and-I've-got-to-hang-up-my-fucking-keys-right-away-because-I'm-obsessive-about-that. So I'm thinking that last night during the middle of my crazy amaretto- and Martinelli's-drenched party (with myself) I did something crazy. What'd I do? Who'd I impregnate? I hope no one's hurt. AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Or I just left my keys on the floor. Whatever.

Anyway, Happy New Year everyone (and check out my <A HREF=""http://flyncherberg.blogspot.com"" target=""_new"">blog</A>!) Here's a survey to ring in 2004 for y'all:

<B>1. What did you do in 2003 that you'd never done before?</B>
I got piss drunk at a party and made out with people I don't normally make out with. I know, call me a wimp, but I'd never done it before. Needless to say it was the coolest thing ever.

<B>2. Did you keep your new years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year?</B>
Well, I made a resolution that the problems in my love life I was having last year would be worked out, and what do you know! They got worked out... aha. It's like those evil genies where you make a wish for world peace and all war stops but you have a beak instead of a nose. Or something like that. I dunno.

<B>3. Did anyone close to you give birth?</B>
No, but my coworker Melissa just told us all she's pregnant. Aaaaaawwwwwwww..... *wipes tear from eye*

<B>4. Did anyone close to you die?</B>
Not that I remember... if they did they couldn't have mattered that much to me anyway, right?

<B>5. What countries did you visit?</B>
Cuba, North Korea, China, Vietnam... oh, wait, no, I didn't go anywhere.

<B>6. What would you like to have in 2004 that you lacked in 2003?</B>
You want the list? Here goes:
- More self-confidence
- A better body (that is to say, a <I>mild</I> tan, bigger--and more defined--muscles, and six-pack abs)
- Cooler hair, preferably Gavin Newsom's
- More money
- A new car, preferably a hybrid

<B>7. What date from 2003 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?</B>
February 14, the day I got dumped by my girlfriend and... other worse things. Haha, what a lame shitty day. Fuck you 2003! I won't miss you at all.

<B>8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?</B>
Having my first (and hopefully only) one night stand! Woooooo!!!!!!

<B>9. What was your biggest failure?</B>
Haha... see #7 (or, you know, getting my admission rescinded to Davis. That was a pretty damn big failure. Fuck you again, 2003.)

<B>10. Did you suffer illness or injury?</B>
Dude, I got the fucking stomach flu. How lame is that?!?!?! I threw up like, 7 times in one night. Gross......

<B>11. What was the best thing you bought?</B>
Okay, Mary said she bought a matching bra and panties set from Victoria's Secret. Now, for this to be the best thing she bought all year, this must be one damn nice bra and panties set. As for me... probably the $700 or so I spent on our Disneyland trip. Or my new cell phone! Yay!! (stop. sounding. like a teenage girl.)

<B>12. Whose behavior merited celebration?</B>
Phil's or Mira's

<B>13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?</B>
Besides our new governor's? Um... probably mine, though mostly earlier in the year

<B>14. Where did most of your money go?</B>
Besides DVDs and CDs? Probably towards the Disneyland trip.

<B>15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?</B>
My various trips to Davis to see my friends

<B>16. What song will always remind you of 2003?</B>
""Still Waiting"" by Sum 41, or other depressed punk pop... Jenna, I'll say one thing, you got me listening to more good music than anyone I've ever known

<B>17. Compared to this time last year, are you:</B>
i. happier or sadder? Hmm... happier, as of this moment, but overall probably sadder
ii. thinner or fatter? Probably the same, but that's only because I got sick a few weeks ago... otherwise I'd probably be 8-10 pounds fatter
iii. richer or poorer? Definitely poorer

<B>18. What do you wish you'd done more of?</B>
Going to cool parties, going to concerts, paying attention to my goddam studies 

<B>19. What do you wish you'd done less of?</B>
Being a dick to people I love

<B>20. How did you spend New Years?</B>
At midnight I was sipping a nice, smooth amaretto (mmm... amaretto) and typing furiously on what I posted to my <A HREF=""http://flyncherberg.blogspot.com"" target=""_new"">blog</A> last night. No. Seriously. That's what I was doing. (Welcome to Loserville! Mayor, City Council, School Board, Treasurer, City Manager and sole resident: DAVID!!!)

<B>22. Did you fall in love in 2003?</B>
Actually, no. Good for me, huh? 

<B>23. How many one-night stands?</B>
One... but I suppose I should be grateful for that. 

<B>24. What was your favorite TV program?</B>
Simpsons, West Wing, or the Daily Show

<B>25. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year?</B>
Hate's an awfully strong word. I'm gonna say no, but there are people I like less. And I've continued hating people I hated in 2002, like George W. Bush and his entire administration.

<B>26. What was the best book you read?</B>
Well I'm not even halfway into <I>The Da Vinci Code</I> and it's already one of the best books I've EVER read! I also loved <I>Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right</I> by Al Franken, <I>Bushwhacked: Life in George W. Bush's America</I>, <I>Big Lies: The Right-Wing Propaganda Machine and How it Distorts the Truth</I>, and of course, <I>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</I>. (I didn't read too much fiction this year, but <I>I Am Legend</I> by Richard Matheson was great, and I revisited <I>The Chronicles of Narnia</I> by C.S. Lewis, which is one of the great series of all time.)

<B>27. What was your greatest musical discovery?</B>
Probably <I>Let It Bleed</I> by the Rolling Stones. Fucking GREAT album. But like I said, I've listened to a LOT more music this year than ever before. This is a hard question. I continue to love Jupiter Sunrise, Ben Kweller and Lucky 7.

<B>28. What did you want and get?</B>
My beautiful retro-style record player! HELL YEAH!!!

<B>29. What did you want and not get?</B>
I'll go with Mary's answer... more love.

<B>30. What was your favorite film of this year?</B>
Okay, Mary, as the biggest geek around, I gotta tell you, <I>Chicago</I> and <I>Igby Goes Down</I> came out LAST year (that is, 2002). And <I>Donnie Darko</I>'s TWO years old. *sigh* This is what you get for working in a video store for 3 years. My favorite movie of the year was <I>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</I>, although I also loved <I>Kill Bill: Vol. 1</I>, <I>Miranda</I>, <I>21 Grams</I>, <I>Once Upon a Time in Mexico</I>, <I>The Hulk</I>, <I>May</I>, <I>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl</I>, <I>Bend It Like Beckham</I>, <I>Confessions of a Dangerous Mind</I>, <I>A Mighty Wind</I>, <I>Narc</I>, <I>Phone Booth</I>, and <I>Spider</I>.

The movies I didn't catch this year but probably should have are many, but here are just a few: <I>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World</I>, <I>Elephant</I>, <I>Love Actually</I>, <I>Alien: The Director's Cut</I>, <I>The Human Stain</I>, <I>Runaway Jury</I>, <I>Lost in Translation</I>, <I>Mystic River</I>, <I>School of Rock</I>, <I>Seabiscuit</I>, <I>Thirteen</I>, <I>Whale Rider</I>.

And, because, I love writing about movies, here are the absolute worst movies I had to sit through in 2003, in no particular order: <I>The Matrix Reloaded</I> and <I>The Matrix Revolutions</I> (could this trilogy have gone out on a more disappointing note?), <I>American Wedding</I> (another trilogy with a crappy ending), <I>Jeepers Creepers 2</I> (and I <I>liked</I> the original!), <I>Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life</I> (enough with the lame sequels already!), <I>The Core</I> (a fun bad movie that quickly became a bad bad movie), <I>Daredevil</I> (worst superhero movie in years), <I>Dreamcatcher</I> (worst Stephen King adaptation in years), <I>The Real Cancun</I> (girls: just watch <I>The Real World</I>; guys: just rent a ""Girls Gone Wild"" tape), <I>A View From the Top</I> (did this movie have <I>any</I> idea what it wanted to be?).

Okay, sorry to take so long talking about movies. Here we go with the rest of the survey...

<B>31. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?</B>
Well, I turned 19, but damned if I remember what I did... oh yeah, I went bowling with my friends! Wooo!!!!!!!

<B>32. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?</B>
Again with Mary's answer... tons of sex.

<B>33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2003?</B>
I definitely changed... I started wearing BADASS pants! Hahaha, you know you love the ones with the stars on them. I think I looked cooler in 2003 than I ever had before.

<B>34. What kept you sane?</B>
Oddly enough, politics. (I don't understand either...)

<B>35. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most?</B>
Well, let's see, there's Keira Knightley. There are other hot women (like Jennifer Connelly and Eva Mendes) but Keira's just... wow.

<B>36. What political issue stirred you the most?</B>
How about our illegal, unnecessary, unconstitutional invasion of a country that had done nothing to harm us, possessed no weapons of mass destruction, and had nothing to do with September 11th? Or our election of a groping, lightweight bodybuilder-actor as governor of the world's fifth largest economy? Those were just two of many. (For more, see my <A HREF=""http://flyncherberg.blogspot.com"" target=""_new"">blog</A>!)

<B>37. Who did you miss?</B>
The person I wanted to talk to the most but who wouldn't talk to me.

<B>38. Who was the best new person you met?</B>
Unfortunately she's a Republican!! I know, it's a tragedy... she nonetheless took care of me when I was sick, so I can forgive her some minor flaws. :)

<B>39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2003.</B>
Women <I>own you</I>. No matter what you say, or what you do, or what you think, women <I>own you</I>. I learned this in so many different ways I won't bother to mention them.

<B>40. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year. </B>
""Time is in love with change...""

"event","Before we enter the New Year (Happy 2004 everybody!) I just want to clear something up. Do you all know I have a <A HREF=""http://flyncherberg.blogspot.com/"" target=""_new"">blog</A>? I have a <A HREF=""http://flyncherberg.blogspot.com/"" target=""_new"">blog</A>. What's a <A HREF=""http://flyncherberg.blogspot.com/"" target=""_new"">blog</A>, you're asking? Well, let me tell you. A <A HREF=""http://flyncherberg.blogspot.com/"" target=""_new"">blog</A> (short for ""weblog,"" which is a smushed-together way of saying ""web log"") is like a LiveJournal, in which a person posts their thoughts and rants, usually about things that really matter (as opposed to LiveJournal, Xanga or Diaryland, in which one posts useless information about one's life). I have a <A HREF=""http://flyncherberg.blogspot.com/"" target=""_new"">blog</A>. It's called <A HREF=""http://flyncherberg.blogspot.com/"" target=""_new"">""Tales from the Left Coast,""</A> and in it I talk about <A HREF=""http://flyncherberg.blogspot.com/"" target=""_new"">stuff</A> that's -- well -- sort of political. I say ""sort of"" because it's stuff that <A HREF=""http://flyncherberg.blogspot.com/"" target=""_new"">really matters to people</A>. You won't see <A HREF=""http://flyncherberg.blogspot.com/"" target=""_new"">me</A> rhapsodizing about America's trade deficit, or about Slobodan Milosevic's trial in the Hague, or about really stupid stuff like Clinton's sex life or Howard Dean's involvement with the draft board in the 1970s. (Also not covered will be George W. Bush's cocaine use, George W. Bush's illegal stock trading, George W. Bush's failure as a businessman, George W. Bush's ties to Saddam Hussein, etc.) No, in my <A HREF=""http://flyncherberg.blogspot.com/"" target=""_new"">blog</A> I talk about things that affect real people, like the California budget cuts which are slashing funding for the UCs and causing tuition fees to rise (last year they increased 10% at UCs, 20% at CSUs and 60% at community colleges). <A HREF=""http://flyncherberg.blogspot.com/"" target=""_new"">I'm</A> also quite witty and conversational, as <A HREF=""http://www.livejournal.com/~flyncherberg/friends"" target=""_new"">my friends</A> all know <A HREF=""http://flyncherberg.blogspot.com/"" target=""_new"">me</A> to be.

"event","So I rented:
- <I>American Wedding</I> (because... does this really need any explanation?)
- <I>Anything Else</I> (because I like Woody Allen, because Christina Ricci is a world-class babe, and because Jason Biggs needs a good non-<I>American Pie</I> role)
- <I>Bram Stoker's Dracula</I> (because Gary Oldman is a great actor, Winona Ryder is hot, and Anthony Hopkins is the bomb-ass-diggity as Van Helsing)
- <I>Freaky Friday</I> (because everybody needs a good heartwarming, touching family comedy every now and then, and because Jamie Lee Curtis is the badassingest lead actress of all time, next to Sigourney Weaver)
- <I>The Order</I> (because I'm reading <A HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385504209/qid=1072822021/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/002-2160527-8075208"" target=""_new""><U>The Da Vinci Code</U></A> [YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK] and I need a little more Vatican conspiracy theory in my life)
- and two versions of F.W. Murnau's silent classic <I>Nosferatu</I> (because it's one of the greatest movies ever--but one version appears to be 12 minutes longer than the other... having seen it several times, I shall have to investigate this)

Okay, okay, so I'm a total geek. But it's raining and I need to be my geeky self with my geeky movies. Methinks I'll be starting with Nosferatu, the shorter version, then moving on to something lighter, probably Anything Else, then having dinner with my parents at which time we'll probably watch Freaky Friday (at least my mom will... my dad will eat dinner for 20 minutes, never looking at the screen, then get up, bring his dishes to the kitchen, go into his bedroom and watch the History Channel). Later I'll perhaps be up to watching the longer Nosferatu, to find the discrepanc(y)(ies), and if I'm not too tired American Wedding.

Tomorrow, then, I could do The Order and Dracula, two horror movies, but I hear The Order is sucky, and I know Dracula isn't, so no matter what I've got at least one good movie.

Again with the geekiness... I know. But would you have me any other way?

(P.S. What should I think about a dream in which a monster attacks a friend of mine [with whom I haven't spoken in months] in a Paris hotel and in which I rescue her by killing the monster?)"

"event","Okay, what about The Who <I>isn't</I> great? Pretty much nothing. They outlasted the Beatles and, when you consider that they're still playing despite the deaths of two of their most talented members (drummer Keith Moon and bassist John Entwistle) one could argue that they've outlasted, and will continue to outlast, every great rock band in history. (The Rolling Stones don't count, because they stopped being good years ago.)

Speaking of The Who, Limp Bizkit has just released a new album (who knew?) on which they apparently cover ""Behind Blue Eyes."" The lyrics actually fit frontman Fred Durst's personality quite well; he acts like a total bully and intimidates anyone who even utters a peep of criticism about his band, then goes and whines about how nobody likes him. Dude, <I>Britney Spears dumped you because you told millions of Howard Stern listeners about how she shaves her pubic hair</I>. Girls tend not to like that stuff.

Has any band in history had a worse frontman than Limp Bizkit? Durst has no talent as a lyrical composer (""I did it all for the nookie, so you can take that cookie, and stick it up your [YEAH]"" is tied with ""Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'"" and ""I'd eat you aliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiive!"" for most braindead chorus lyrics of all time), even less ability as a vocalist, and almost everyone who's encountered him thinks he's a total jerk.

What a fall from greatness--or, should I say, sorta-goodness. Bizkit hit it big with their awful cover of George Michael's ""Faith"" about five years ago. It's too bad that song had to be their hit, since the <I>Three Dollar Bill Y'all</I> album was actually pretty good, if totally ignored by the fans and the media. Then things went south--<I>Significant Other</I> sported cute radio-friendly hits like ""Nookie,"" ""Re-arranged"" and that overdone rap duet with Method Man which was basically ""Shut the f*** up!"" repeated <I>ad nauseam</I>. But all those songs got old quickly. The only lasting musical moment from Bizkit's sophomore effort was ""Break Stuff,"" which may well go down as the definitive anger anthem of the late '90s.

<I>Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water</I> was even worse. If it's possible for someone's brain to get younger even as his body gets older, Fred Durst seemed to have done so. The best, and most popular, song from the album was ""Take a Look Around,"" the band's contribution to the <I>Mission: Impossible 2</I> soundtrack. Once again, Limp Bizkit proved that the less original they got, the more popular, and likable, they were.

Now, three years and one new guitarist later (Wes Borland, arguably the creative anchor of Limp Bizkit, left in 2001), we have <I>Results May Vary</I>, an album I'm in no hurry to purchase. Having heard the first single, ""Eat You Alive,"" and seen its video, I can safely join Live 105 in their Bizkit boycott. (For whatever reason, the popular local rock station has taken to making periodic announcements as to how long it's been since they played Limp Bizkit -- ""At the tone, it will have been 7 months, 3 days, and 2 hours since Live 105 played Limp Bizkit,"" etc.) In the video for the awful, awful lead single, Durst kidnaps actress Thora Birch (who was so wonderful in <I>American Beauty</I> and <I>Ghost World</I>), straps her to a chair, and screams ""I'd eat you aliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiive!!!!"" through a bullhorn, right into the terrified girl's face. Why Ms. Birch, or any woman, would allow herself to be degraded in this sick manner is beyond me. I hope, for her sake, that the young talented actress doesn't get involved romantically with the jackass of a ""singer,"" unless she's anxious for her grooming habits to be made public.

So that's my Limp Bizkit rant. Don't buy their CD; don't listen to their music. Ignore this stupid, un-talented excuse for a band. Go out and buy yourself the new best-of compilations from the Red Hot Chili Peppers or No Doubt instead (and while we're on the subject, why did No Doubt leave ""Don't Let Me Down,"" the best single from 2001's <I>Rock Steady</I>, off their greatest-hits album?). 

As for me (since this is a LiveJournal about <I>me</I>, not Limp Bizkit), I'm sick as hell. Last night, around 11:30, I felt my dinner creep up from my stomach into my throat, and I went and threw it all up. Then, probably an hour or so later, I did the same, except this time there was less food and more stomach acid in my vomit. The third time around I basically threw up air for five minutes. Sounds fun, huh? Luckily I have the best parents IN THE WORLD, and they cleared out of their bedroom so I could sleep in their comfy, cozy, warm bed for the night. I nonetheless threw up a few more times and obtained a fever of 100.5 degrees. So I think it's safe to say I'm ill, probably with the stomach flu both my parents just got over. 

As my smartest friend ever once said, ""Fuck you too, life."""

"event","As their career may be winding down (then again, it may not be), the Red Hot Chili Peppers have chosen to release their second compilation album in fifteen years, <I>Greatest Hits</I>. It's substantially better than 1992's <I>What Hits?!</I>, which was mostly intended to introduce fans of the 1991 hit album <I>BloodSugarSexMagik</I> to the band's 1980s funk-rock. With four notable exceptions, the new album is comprised entirely of songs from <I>BloodSugarSexMagik</I>, 1999's comeback hit <I>Californication</I>, and last year's <I>By the Way</I>. (The exceptions are their wonderfully funky cover of Stevie Wonder's ""Higher Ground,"" which appeared on 1989's <I>Mother's Milk</I>, the sweet acoustic ballad ""My Friends"" from 1995's <I>One Hot Minute</I>, and two new songs, ""Fortune Faded"" and ""Save the Population."")

Casual RHCP fans will want to pick up the new compilation, but die-harders (yours truly included) will be disappointed. It's missing some key singles, such as ""Around the World,"" which in 2000 proved to skeptics that the aging musicians could still rock harder than any band alive, and the two catchiest tunes from <I>One Hot Minute</I>, ""Warped"" and ""Aeroplane."" (The band's high-profile feud with <I>OHM</I> guitarist Dave Navarro may be why they've largely ignored the album since reuniting with John Frusciante.) And ""Road Trippin"", one of the best songs from <I>Californication</I>, seems out of place on a ""greatest hits"" compilation, since it got very little airplay compared to other, bigger singles. (A ""best of"" CD would be different; but as the title suggests, this album is for those who want the <I>hits</I>.)

All in all, <I>Greatest Hits</I> is a fine collection of some of the greatest music in modern rock history. The Chili Peppers have consistently been groundbreakers and this shows why. Sure, it's missing a few essential tunes, but if you truly like the band, you shouldn't be above purchasing their entire album collection anyway. :)"

"event","Okay, so I'm in Davis now and frankly I've never had a better time. I got here late Monday night and watched ""Old School"" with Kevin and Beth (I don't... I don't understand why you gotta do it in front of the kid. All you gotta do is say ""earmuffs,"" then you can say FUCK, SHIT, BITCH!) and went to bed late. Then I got up yesterday morning, went to breakfast at Bakers Square with Kevin (the waitress was cute, her name was Annasophia) then picked up Beth and hung out at her place for a while.

Yesterday afternoon Phil and I headed into Sacramento watch the special session of the legislature called by the Gropinator. (*sigh* California... you're so stupid) Basically they did what the California legislature does--argue. It was insane how partisan and contentious they were. It was nonetheless good entertainment. And there were a MILLION people -- fans, reporters, protesters -- gathered outside the governor's office.

Then I came back and hung out with Beth and Kevin some more. Kevin had to work at the service desk, being an RA and all, so the 3 of us played ""Risk"" and had fun. Then Kevin and I came back and watched ""House of 1000 Corpses"". I don't think he liked it much, but it'll grow on him. =)

Today is my last full day here--Kevin and I had lunch at the DC (two hot dogs and a banana... could my lunch GET any more phallic?) and I'm gonna go shopping for a while, maybe get a haircut, then meet up with the 2 of them at Beth's place at 3:00 while Kevin opens his presents. (Happy birthday my man! I don't know why I'm saying it here, since I'm staying with you and all...) I got him [BLOCKED OUT UNTIL AFTER KEVIN OPENS HIS PRESENTS] -- don't you think he'll love it?!

Tonight hopefully we'll see a movie or something, or go to dinner. Come to think of it, I ought to take Kevin and Beth out to dinner, since they've been such gracious hosts and all. I wonder what movie we should see... any suggestions, call my cell! It's in the car right now but hopefully I will be soon.

Until later, peace out!

"event","I can't not write about this... I have no friends I can call in the middle of the night anymore (Jenna, I really need you right now goddammit) so LiveJournal is gonna be my friend. If anyone reads this, please, I dunno, talk to me or something.

I just took Mira and Nina to dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. Nina called me when I got home from Davis and asked me to take them. I figured I'd be spending $30-40 or so, knowing that the CF isn't cheap. So I was reluctant but I said yes because I like Nina and because Mira and I are becoming friends again. I thought, well, I might as well do everything I can to get to know Nina better, and I oughta try and be as nice to Mira as I can so she knows I don't hate her or anything.

The fact that our smoothies were $5 each should have given me a clue. The total came to $86. When I saw the bill I started to hyperventilate and get dizzy. I snapped back into reality quickly but I've rarely been so shocked in my life. I couldn't believe I was paying $86 for dinner. I'd seen similar dinner bills - $80 for Kevin, Beth, me and Jeff (a friend of Kevin's) at Knott's Berry Farm this August, and $90 for me, Kev and Beth at the ESPN Sportscenter Restaurant a few nights later. But those were Kevin and Beth. No offense to Mira or Nina, but I'd fucking die for Kevin and Beth, okay? I love them like they were my own family. No, fuck that, I love them more than I love my own family. I probably love them more than anyone on earth.

That's not to say Mira and Nina weren't grateful - they were. They're not bad people, and I like being friends with them, but I'm not as rich as I used to be. I used to get $8.50 an hour at the Movie Groove for working 30 hours a week. Now I get $9 an hour for Joe Simitian working 14 hours a week. So my hourly wage has gone up but I'm working half as many hours. Also, I'm considering moving into a place with Nina, which will require every dime I have and more.

That, on top of all the other shit going on in my life right now, just made my day a really horrible one. I'd rather not get into it, but my three major lives - love life, school life, work life - are all fucked up and in turmoil right now, and just thinking about all that, on top of the $86 dinner bill, made me practically lose it. On the car ride home after dropping Nina off, I was so close to bursting out in tears. I had to fight it so hard.

I need to be in Davis for a while. Going there is so wonderful - it's like a breath of fresh air. I go there, I visit Kevin and Beth and Phil - the three most wonderful people in the world, as far as I'm concerned - and I'm happy all the time. It's like heaven. Being with my friends is just amazing.

By the way, none of this should be taken as offensive to Mira or Nina. I love you both and you're great friends, but the $86 might have been a bit much at this particular time. Maybe at some other time it wouldn't have really gotten to me, but you didn't pick the best night for it. Sorry..."

"event","Hello out there in TV land! That is, er--LiveJournal land. I have time to waste (actually, I don't, but I've told myself that I do) so I'm updating you all on my life.

It's about time to apply for college -- *sigh* -- again. Hopefully I can get it right this time. If <I>you</I> were working at <A HREF=""http://www.ucdavis.edu"" target=""_new"">UC Davis</A> and you saw my list of extracurricular activities plus letters of recommendation from a California state assemblyman, a <A HREF=""http://www.redwoodcity.org/government/council/members.html#ruskin"" target=""_new"">Redwood City council member</A>, and a professor of political science at <A HREF=""http://www.canadacollege.edu/"" target=""_new"">Ca&#241;ada College</A>, you'd let me in, right? Wouldn't you?? I certainly hope you would. I like you very much.

(Okay, sorry about the links; I was having too much fun there. Heh heh... I'll stop now. Really. What, <I>you don't believe me??!</I> *Slaps you in the face and walks away*)

I'm actually applying to several schools, just to be safe -- I had no trouble getting into San Francisco, Sacramento and San Jose State Universities before, so it should be okay this time. I don't know if I'll bother with UCLA or Riverside this time -- one admitted me last time and one didn't -- because the climate of conservatism down south would stifle me. I <I>need</I> to be among fellow knee-jerk tree-hugging feminist liberals! (Or at least people that think Arnold as governor is the worst idea since a drunk Texan oil mogul as president.) I know, sounds like I'm perfect for Berkeley, huh? Well, no dice... they wouldn't even admit me when I had good grades. (Remember? It was back before Caesar was assassinated, before Christianity, even before -- gasp! -- the war in Iraq.)

So I'll probably apply to the aforementioned state colleges, Davis, and something fun like Santa Clara University. It's a neat campus, it's a reasonably easy school to get into, they have a good political science department, it's close to home (and local politics), and my hot friend Mary goes there. (I have a hot friend who goes to Berkeley, too, but like I said, my chances of getting in rank somewhere below Dennis Kucinich's chances of winning the Democratic nomination.) Of course I'm not basing my college decisions based on good-looking females, but in the back of my mind somewhere, deep in my subconscious, it's probably a factor. =)

Tomorrow is Election Day -- if you're reading this and you can vote in the Redwood City election, pick Ira Ruskin, Barbara Pierce, Rosanne Foust and Ian Bain for city council! I have 2 election-night parties to go to, both of which <A HREF=""http://www.joesimitian.com"" target=""_new"">my boss</A> is scheduled to appear at, and a party this Friday for retiring Mayor Dick Claire, which will feature every serious politician within 5 cities. I love being around all these powerful people... it makes me feel so important!

(Okay, c'mon... it was <I>one</I> link, you insensitive jerk. And I put it there for informational purposes! I want people to know who my boss is, and that he's a very important man. I was doing a public good.)

Other than that, not much is going on right now. Obviously, there's work, which I'm loving. (For a recent mind-numbingly painful project I had to run mostly by myself, the staff gave me a small cheap trophy for ""Going above and beyond the call of duty."" They said they ordered a tiny metal plaque for the trophy, but it hasn't come yet, so ""Going above and beyond..."" is written on a post-it note attached to the trophy's base.) It's great to get paid for doing what you like, even if you have to wear uncomfortable clothes every day to do it.

Haven't seen many movies lately. My (condensed) reviews of the entire <I>Texas Chainsaw</I> series:

<I>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</I> (1974): A classic which lives up to its reputation. Brutal tale of a group of teenagers stranded in the Texas home of a cannibalistic family and a chainsaw-wielding maniac. The film's tight budget and unknown actors make it look cheap, which -- surprisingly -- only adds to the documentary-like feel. Still chilling even today, if a bit dated. Not particularly gory, either.

<I>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2</I> (1986): The only true sequel stars Dennis Hopper as a homicidal, off-his-rocker Texas Ranger seeking revenge on Leatherface and his demented family for killing his brother's children 13 years prior. Unbelievably campy humor, a few genuine scares and hilariously over-the-top gore make this enjoyable, though not nearly as good as the original. Fun for gore fanatics.

<I>Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3</I> (1989): Not really a sequel so much as a remake. Although it pretends to be expanding on the prior films' plots, the ending of <I>TCM 2</I> makes that impossible. Still interesting to watch. Less humor than the second film and more gore than the first make it little more than an exploitation feature, however. Not to mention an unsatisfying ending.

<I>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation</I> (1994): You are NOT going to believe this -- Matthew McConaughey and Renee Zellweger (yes, Renee Zellweger) in a <I>Texas Chainsaw</I> flick! Wow. They must have been desperate for work in 1994 when they signed onto this one. It's easily the worst film of the series, with but a handful of scary and/or suspenseful moments permeating its 94 minutes of unnecessary gore and cruelty.

<I>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</I> (2003): Okay, those of you who've read this far were probably waiting for this one. How does the only ""official"" remake fare? Not bad. It's definitely got suspense and scares, but some passages are way too slow and drawn out. It's certainly the most original film since the first one, though, with a whole new plot and cast of characters. Jessica Biel (in, believe it or not, one of her best roles) plays one of those kick-ass horror heroines (like Jamie Lee in <I>Halloween</I> or Sigourney in <I>Alien</I>) who refuses to sit back and take any crap. The opening and closing narration also works well. All in all, it's not as good as the original, but it's worth seeing.

I also saw <I>Kill Bill, Vol. 1</I>. It's not nearly as good as all the hype would suggest, but it's a fun two hours of splatter violence inspired by Japanese anime and classic martial arts movies. Tarantino is at his best with characters and dialogue, though, not visuals, and the film is lacking the thick storyline that made <I>Pulp Fiction</I> such a masterpiece, or the irreverent dialogue in <I>Reservoir Dogs</I> that put the young video-store-employee-turned-filmmaker on the map. Worth seeing? Definitely. A classic? Hardly. Still, I can't wait for Volume 2 next year...

Coming up are the conclusions to two now-classic trilogies, one new and one old. <I>The Matrix Revolutions</I> opens Nov. 5 and <I>The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King</I> in mid-December. Both look promising, and both are sure to set box-office records.

That's all for now, partygoers. I've lost that creative touch, and I'd better get out of here before I start ranting and raving like an idiot. (I know you think that's what I've been doing for the past several paragraphs, but if you look closely, you'll see that I've actually been ranting like a somewhat educated person.)

"event","A lot of people who are cynical about politics (i.e., all of you under 30 or so) have a right to be. Too often, politicians play the ""fat cat"" role, collecting huge campaign checks and then rewarding those contributors once they're in office, either with (a) government jobs, (b) government contracts, (c) special tax breaks, or (d) good-old fashioned government subsidies. If this turns you off from politics, it's understandable; it's turned off two-thirds of Californians.

But a couple Fridays ago, on Sept. 12, something happened that would have made Thomas Jefferson and the framers proud, something every cynical, jaded California nonvoter should know about.

The government gave a man $421,000. Sounds lousy, right? Probably some lazy welfare recipient sitting on the living room couch, eating up our tax dollars. Or maybe he's the CEO of a multinational corporation who just got a big tax cut. Either way, he's getting a $421,000 check from you and me, the taxpayers. So who is he?

He's Rick Walker, an auto mechanic from East Palo Alto. Twelve years ago, he was arrested for the murder of his girlfriend. Earlier this year, however, a district court ruled that without question he was <I>not</I> his girlfriend's murderer, and that he had spent twelve years in prison for a crime he did not commit.

Under California law, anyone wrongfully imprisoned is entitled to $100 per day of incarceration. So Mr. Walker, released from prison but with no place to live, no telephone, no car and no job, filed a claim for $421,000. (The actual claim was for $428,000 but it turns out he's not entitled to payment for the 70 days he spent in prison <I>before</I> trial.) That was fine with the state claims board but the payment had to be approved by the state legislature (that's the Senate and the Assembly) and signed by the governor before the money could be dispersed. The problem? The legislature was getting ready to wrap up one of its most turbulent, vitriolic, blindingly partisan sessions ever. And it wasn't due to reconvene until January 5, 2004.

Realizing he had only days for the legislature to act (otherwise he'd have to wait six months to a year, due to various legal technicalities, to receive his due compensation), Walker put in an urgent request to his representatives, <A HREF=""http://democrats.assembly.ca.gov/members/a21"" target=""_new"">Assemblyman Joe Simitian</A> and <A HREF=""http://democrats.sen.ca.gov/senator/sher"" target=""_new"">Senator Byron Sher</A>. The two were responsive and agreed to add Mr. Walker's claim as an amendment to another bill being sent through the legislature.

The problem came with Senator Dede Alpert, head of the Senate Appropriations Committee, who for procedural and personal reasons didn't want her bill being amended. With just two days left in the legislative session, Simitian and Sher introduced a new bill, <A HREF=""http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/postquery?bill_number=ab_1302&sess=CUR&house=B&author=simitian"" target=""_new"">AB 1302</A>, and went to work passing it through the legislature.

Walker's claim was approved by the Senate the night of Thursday, September 11, but stalled in the Assembly the next day. Assembly Republicans, angry at the Democrats for, well, being Democrats, had decided to boycott all bills requiring a two-thirds vote for passage, leaving Walker's claim six votes shy of being approved. Simitian nonetheless tried his best, and as the Assembly continued its end-of-session wrapup late into the morning hours of Saturday, September 13, he became increasingly agitated.

Sometime around 2:30 a.m., Simitian finally was able to force a vote on the bill authorizing Walker's claim. When it fell five votes short of passage, the distraught Simitian paced the floor of the California Assembly, pleading with individual Republican legislators. ""The state's already made him a victim once -- let's not make him a victim twice,"" he is reported to have said.

Finally, an hour later, as Simitian walked back to his desk preparing to concede defeat, Speaker Herb Wesson called for a re-vote on the measure, and it passed 62-0, with 18 legislators refraining from casting a vote but none saying ""no."" The Assembly chambers broke out into cheers and applause.

A week later, the state claims board approved Walker's $421,000 claim and on Sunday, September 21, Governor Davis signed AB 1302.

Incidents like this show us that there is justice, there is hope, there is decency, and there is heroism -- all embodied in the tireless efforts of Assemblyman Joe Simitian -- left in the world of politics. The San Mateo County Times was one of a dozen or more state publications glowing with pride for Simitian, calling him ""the Jimmy Stewart of our time."" The reference -- to Stewart's legendary citizen-senator in <I>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</I> -- was clear. But for me, the better comparison is to Harry S. Truman. Like the thirty-third President, Joe Simitian is a straight-talker with a great deal of charm, wit, and a clear-cut sense for knowing when to do the right thing."

A lot of weird shit going down in Davidland lately. The school issue is killing me. I think I should be elected President of the Fuck-up Club because that's pretty much what I've been for almost a year now. If I hadn't made the stupid-ass mistake of going back to work at the Movie Groove (God <I>damn</I>, why did I do that?) I might have passed my spring classes and I'd be in Davis now. No, I mean <I>right</I> now. This second. In an apartment, or a dorm, or whatever. Not sitting at home at age 19 getting ready to spend almost another year here.

As if things could be harder, it doesn't look like I'm going to take the most essential classes I need to make up until winter quarter. If Davis isn't okay with that, well, it could be a long time before I ever get to go to a real college. Which all my friends have been doing for a year now.

I'm into this really cool girl Lindsay, but naturally she has to be the busiest girl in the whole damn world. Of course. It couldn't be any other way, could it? No no no, a sweet girl you can relate to and talk to and have arguments with (she's a Republican; see previous entry) has to be <I>never available!!! Hahahaha!!!!!</I>

Sorry if I sound a little down, but I am. It'll be okay. I'll get into a good college, have a good education, meet a great girl I can spend time with, and someday be elected to high office. Until then, dear reader, you get to deal with me complaining every once in a while. Mmkay?"

Not mean or trivial arguments, mind you, but arguments about real things. Arguments about humanity, about society, about America. Not even necessarily political arguments, just intelligent arguments. I find that when I argue with someone they tend to think I'm either being mean, condescending, or just talking too much. Let's take those apart, shall we?

As far as being ""mean,"" I act the way I act because people sometimes disagree with how I feel about something, and occasionally it's something I feel very passionately about. (Ever notice people tend to act that way in those situations? It's called <I>real life</I>.) I'm sorry if someone thinks blacks and whites have ""equal rights"" in today's America. I completely disagree and I care very much about this issue. Those who think I'm being ""mean"" will notice that, unlike most nightly news commentators (they used to call them ""analysts,"" as if they analyzed anything other than their own blowhard opinions), I never call names or become rude. I try not to interrupt people, and I admit this sometimes fails, but I've never gotten downright nasty. And by the way, interrupting someone involves cutting them off <I>while they are speaking</I>, not while they are getting ready to speak.

The ""condescending"" issue is a little more complicated. There are certain areas I can safely say I'm more knowledgeable in than many of my friends, but not many. ""Politics"" is not one of them, because politics is simply knowing how the world works, which takes simple common sense, a trait I have no more or less of than most of my acquaintances. If I cite a statistic someone is unaware of, they're welcome to come at me with another statistic. I encourage it. If someone thinks I'm wrong about a fact, prove me wrong. Spend the four or five minutes it takes to verify a fact or a number and prove me wrong. You'll find that I accept defeat rather gracefully.

Those who think I ""talk too much"" in debate are always welcome to (a) cut me off, which I don't usually mind, or (b) wait until I'm finished and then explain that they'd like me to be more concise. I listen quite well, you know.

So I want someone, not necessarily for romantic relations, but just a friend, who will seriously argue with me. Those who don't want to argue with me are welcome to their feelings, but they shouldn't make false accusations. I argue with a flawed but usually effective combination of both emotions and facts. (By the way, I do mean <I>real</I> facts--hearing something from your friend, whose uncle is an expert in this field or that, is not a fact.) And I want someone who does the same, someone who will take me on with vigor and energy.

They don't have to disagree with me on every issue--in fact, I'd hate that. But my friend Maral, who I've sadly lost touch with, was a great example of a smart, witty, literate debate companion who never lost her cool and never said anything that she knew to be untrue. (The smartest thing someone in a debate can do when they don't know an answer is to say ""I don't know,"" because if you lie, it will <I>always</I> come back and bite you in the ass. Always.) Maral was a moderate Republican, so we could debate taxes, abortion, affirmative action and morality (boy, did she hate Clinton and his affairs), but we also saw eye-to-eye on the death penalty, school vouchers and the Iraq war.

Phil would be a fine candidate, except that we agree on every issue I can think of. (No, really--I have yet to find a single issue he and I don't agree on.) Any of my friends would fit this description well, if they only cared a little more about some of the things I care about. But, of course, you can't make people care about issues. They make their own decisions. I just hope there is a person out there who I can meet, make friends with, and sit down with on a regular basis to have an intelligent, mature, tasteful discussion on the issues of the day. Any takers?"

"event","So I've been pretty busy lately. I went to a rockin' party over the weekend, courtesy of the hottest Russian girl I've ever dated (if any of you besides Mary are Russian and I didn't know about it, I'm dreadfully sorry!), went to Sacramento to pick up some boxes for Joe Simitian on Monday (where it's 101 degrees), and have otherwise been watching cool movies and hanging out with cool people.

Just a little me update, for those of you that care.

On the political side, Mona Charen writes, ""...isn't the state entitled, in some cases, to prohibit certain sexual activity just because most of us find it deplorable?""

Um, no. Sorry, but the Constitution isn't designed to protect what ""most of us"" think; it's designed to protect minorities (such as gays and lesbians) from the tyranny of the majority. (By the way, do ""most of us"" really think that letting gays have consensual sex in their own homes should be outlawed? I'd like to see some poll numbers on that.) Incest isn't illegal because ""most of us"" deplore it; it's illegal because in most cases it's not consensual and can be very damaging to a family and any children borne of the unholy union. Polygamy isn't illegal because ""most of us"" deplore it; it's illegal because, again, it's rarely consensual and is usually exercised by men who wish to dominate women. Bestiality, which I think ""most of us"" would agree is far more deplorable than gay sex, is illegal because, as far as modern science can tell, it's <I>never</I> consensual.

So I don't think the state is entitled to outlaw sex acts between consenting, nonrelated adults. Thomas Jefferson and George Washington might agree with me, but who are they, mere mortals they were, to set government policy? A popular bumper sticker reads, ""Don't worry--God's in control!"" Sorry, but no God controls <I>my</I> government. The Constitution does.

One more thing--if ""most of us"" are so grossed out by gay sex, which consists primarily of oral but also sometimes anal stimulation, let's ban all sexual acts that don't consist of penis-to-vagina contact. And, while we're at it, require that all couples use the ""missionary"" position. In their bedrooms. After 10:00 p.m. With the lights off. With the woman wearing a nightgown and the man completely naked. We should require that afterwards, they lie in bed smoking cigarettes with the sheet covering the woman's chest but not the man's."

<I>If the tenets of the ""gay-rights"" movement are true, the Torah and New Testament are wrong, Christianity has been wrong since the time of St. Paul, Aquinas and Augustine were wrong, and the moral edifice by which men in the West have lived for 2,000 years was built on bigotry, prejudice and lies.

What I want to know is, when the FUCK did Jesus Christ say two men loving each other, or two women loving each other, were sinners?

That said, I'm glad for all the memories. Maybe. Not sure about that one, actually.

Politically, a lot of stuff's going on -- lots of important Supreme Court decisions tomorrow and whatnot. Today they said certain forms of affirmative action are okay, and of course all the upper-middle class white Christian bitches got their underpanties in a wad because God forbid that black man (who's probably a cocaine dealer and a wife beater anyway, at least if you believe the news) get their spot at Harvard and they're forced to go to their safety school, Yale. Oh no, the world is ending, blacks and Latinos are getting into college, now we're REALLY in trouble. Because in college they'll actually have good professors, unlike the wannabe excuses for teachers they had in high school, who will teach them how much white society is fucking them every day. And then they might actually start to vote. Which is good because then Democrats will win and we'll stop giving $400 billion tax cuts to rich people and invading and conquering countries full of brown people.

For all you Movie Groovers out there, check out ""Miranda"" and ""Life + Debt,"" both coming out tomorrow. One's a cute British romantic comedy-drama starring Christina Ricci, the other's a tragic, depressing documentary about globalization and its effects on Jamaica. A nice little double feature, I think.

For all you Blockbuster-ers out there, enjoy ""The Hours."" Just so you know, all 3 of the women kill themselves at the end. Hope I didn't give away any big surprise there, much like that idiot who told you that the ship sinks at the end of ""Titanic,"" that Romeo <I>and</I> Juliet both die, and that the U.S. operation in Somalia was a huge failure. (For those of you who were busy watching ""Pearl Harbor"" when ""Black Hawk Down,"" one of the most realistic and gritty war films ever made, came out, I hope you weren't too surprised by the Japanese attack on the U.S. base where Ben Affleck was having romantic troubles.)

"event","Last Saturday (May 3), the nine major candidates for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination met in South Carolina for their first debate. The ninety minute program, hosted by former Clinton adviser George Stephanopolous, was surprisingly comprehensive, revealing more about the candidates than any individual speeches or New Republic editorials ever could have.<p>I want everyone who reads my journal to read this, because it's important to know who's running for president. As we've seen under the Bush dictatorship, the President of the United States can defy democratic tradition, overturn established constitutional norms and easily transform himself into the most powerful politician in the United States. This is a far cry from the quiet, inoffensive White House the Founding Fathers envisioned two centuries ago, and any Democrat in 2004 is preferable to King George. The question is, who is the best (and most electable) of the bunch?<p>A quick overview of the candidates:<p>&#8226; Dennis Kucinich, Congressman from Ohio. Kucinich is a far-left liberal who was ardently opposed to the war, wants to repeal the USA PATRIOT Act which gives Attorney General John Ashcroft the power to catalog Americans' library book checkouts and detain legal immigrants without due process, and advocates the creation of a Department of Peace, to counter the belligerent and powerful Defense Department.<p>&#8226; Dick Gephardt, Congressman from Missouri, former Democratic leader who resigned his post when the Dems not only failed to retake the House of Representatives in 2002 but actually lost a dozen seats. Gephardt is campaigning on his health care plan which he says will insure 97 percent of Americans, by providing tax credits to employers and requiring them to provide coverage. He supported the war but opposes the President's tax cuts, even going so far as to suggest repealing the ones already enacted.<p>&#8226; Al Sharpton, civil rights activist and ordained minister. Sharpton, the campaign's most prominent African-American, sees himself as the heir to Jesse Jackson's legacy (Jackson ran for the Democratic nomination in 1984 and 1988, losing both times but registering hundreds of thousands of new voters and leaving a permanent mark on the party). He is another left-leaning liberal, opposed to the Iraq war and future tax cuts, but he seems the most unelectable of the evening's nine contenders. He has been charged with sexual harassment, racism and illegal campaign activities, and is never afraid to speak his mind.<p>&#8226; Joe Lieberman, Senator from Connecticut and candidate for vice president in 2000. Arguably the most conservative Democrat running for president, Lieberman was very much in favor of the invasion of Iraq, and does not support any forms of tax increases, even to pay for health care, education or national security. He stresses the need for a ""tough"" Democrat who has the ""courage"" to stand up for what's ""right"" (such as illegal preemptive invasions and the erosion of civil liberties).<p>&#8226; Carol Moseley Braun, former Senator from Illinois and US Ambassador to New Zealand. Braun is most famous for being the only African American female senator in history, and now for being the first black woman to seriously seek a major party's presidential nomination. A liberal along the lines of Sharpton or Kucinich, Braun seems unlikely to win the nomination but nonetheless seems determined to make an impact on the campaign.<p>&#8226; Howard Dean, former Governor of Vermont. The rising star of the Democratic Party, Dean's twelve years as governor of the Ben & Jerry state were marked by a decrease in crime (one year there were only five homicides in the entire state; yes, I said five), the implementation of a program providing guaranteed health coverage to every citizen under 18, and a civil unions bill that provided the same legal benefits to gay and lesbian couples that the law provides to married heterosexual couples. Dean is easily the most mainstream of the antiwar candidates, though his pro-gay, anti-tax cut stance is sure to hurt him in moderate and conservative states.<p>&#8226; John Edwards, Senator from North Carolina. As a senator from one of the nation's most conservative states, Edwards is a centrist on most social issues--favoring some forms of affirmative action, limited abortion rights and remaining as ambiguous as possible on gay rights--but is a fiery populist when it comes to big business and corporate corruption. He cites his twenty years as a trial lawyer, and his parents' lack of college education, as proof that he is a ""regular guy"" in touch with average American values.<p>&#8226; Bob Graham, Senator from Florida. The oldest of the candidates--he will be 68 in 2004--Graham loves to cite his experience as a senator and former Florida governor. He exemplifies Michael Dukakis's belief that a presidential election should focus on ""competence, not ideology."" He is a proud centrist who opposed Congress's war resolution because it didn't give the president <I>enough</I> power to attack other countries (!) and claims to be from ""the <I>electable</I> wing of the Democratic Party,"" a play on Howard Dean's now-famous exclamation that he is from ""the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party.""<p>&#8226; John Kerry, Senator from Massachusetts. Currently polling better than any other candidate, Kerry is a moderate liberal who has been criticized for his ambiguity on major issues. He voted for the congressional war resolution but later claimed to oppose the war in most major speeches; he supports universal health care but won't say how he expects the government to implement it; he is against raising taxes but doesn't talk much about lowering them. He clearly aims to be the least controversial, and therefore most electable, candidate for president in 2004. That strategy is a good one in a general election but will make it tough for him to win the Democratic primaries.<p>The debate largely focused on five issues--the Iraq war, national security, health care, international trade, and tax cuts. The general consensus was that removing Saddam Hussein was, in principle, a good idea, but that it would have been better accomplished through international channels such as the United Nations, and that it didn't have to happen as soon as it did. National security was a given for all candidates, though most of them questioned the Justice Department's startling assault on civil liberties and constitutional freedoms. (Only Kucinich, however, had a specific policy proposal, which involved repealing the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism, or USA PATRIOT, legislation.)<p>On health care, all candidates seemed to desire full coverage for every American, but the most outspoken on the issue were Kucinich, Gephardt, Lieberman and Dean. Kucinich mentioned his bill that would have imposed a 7.7% tax on every employer in America to provide full and complete health insurance for everyone. Gephardt's bill was more complicated; he proposed repealing most of the 2001 tax cut and using a 60% tax credit (whatever that means) to allow 97 percent of working Americans to be covered. Lieberman, like his former comrade Al Gore, said that national health insurance could be best achieved incrementally, by first covering all children, then by covering all seniors, and by giving tax incentives to small businesses to cover their employees. Dean didn't mention much about his presidential plan, but relied heavily on the fact that he helped get 96 percent of Vermonters covered under Medicaid.<p>Trade was largely the most divisive issue in the debate. Kucinich was very protectionist. He asserted that the treaties authorizing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) should be repealed, on the basis that they take jobs from Americans. Most other candidates disagreed. Lieberman asserted that free trade among all nations is the best road to economic prosperity, citing Bill Clinton's successes in trade matters. Edwards and Gephardt echoed most of their colleagues' voices on the issue, supporting free trade and NAFTA but arguing that regulations protecting labor, consumers and the environment should be a crucial part of any international agreements. (Interestingly, Gephardt failed to mention his famous proposal to establish an international minimum wage among the nations of the WTO; such a proposal would have clearly distinguished him from the other candidates, none of whom have mentioned anything similar, and undoubtedly would have gone over well with the audience of Democratic voters.)<p>Tax cuts were an easy issue for all of the candidates. They seemed to all oppose the current tax cut Bush has proposed--a $726 billion, ten-year measure that eliminates taxes on corporate dividends and, among other small measures, reduces the tax on the wealthiest one percent of Americans from 39 to 35 percent--but were divided only on what forms of economic stimulus <I>should</I> be enacted. Kucinich, Sharpton and Braun believed that more government spending, especially on infrastructure and direct job creation, was the best road to recovery. Only Lieberman seemed to feel that substantial tax cuts were necessary. The other Congressmembers in the race--Gephardt, Graham, Kerry and Edwards--were ambiguous but clearly opposed to the Bush plan. Dean stressed the need for fiscal discipline and a balanced budget.<p>All of the candidates tried to be as humorous and charismatic as possible. When asked his opinion of the Bush tax cut and its effect on the economy, Sharpton bellowed, ""I like to say it's like a cup of Kool-Aid from Jim Jones--it tastes good but it'll kill you!"" When confronted about his aloofness and tendency to shy away from controversial issues, Kerry quipped, ""Maybe I ought to just disappear and contemplate that by myself for a while."" A comment from the moderator that he's been characterized as ""too nice"" to defeat President Bush prompted Joe Lieberman to tease Stephanopolous, ""George, that makes me want to come over there and strangle you."" Perhaps the evening's funniest, and most controversial, remark, came from Carol Moseley Braun, who said that, while serving her ambassadorship in 2000, she heard New Zealanders remark that the presidential election that year was effectively decided by the African American vote--that of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.<p>To an undecided Democratic voter (like me), the overall impression from the debate was not a promising one. The Democratic party is divided when it should be united--as it was in the 1950s, leading to the election of Dwight D. Eisenhower; in the 1960s, leading to the election of Richard Nixon, and in the 1980s, leading to the election of Ronald Reagan. Some of the best, and worst, ideas floated during the debate:<p>&#8226; Providing health insurance for all Americans using a combination of tax credits, repealing certain parts of the Bush tax cut, and expanding the federal Medicaid program = GOOD idea. Howard Dean and Dick Gephardt should work out a compromise between their respective plans to find a workable middle ground.<p>&#8226; Trying to implement a universal ""single payer"" health care system by raising payroll taxes = BAD idea. Kucinich's plan would never make it through even a Democratic congress; Republicans have done a good job over the past generation painting <I>all</I> taxes, even the ones that pay for good programs such as health care, as evil tools of Satan that will kill the economy, cost jobs and increse the size of the federal government.<p>&#8226; Working through the United Nations and NATO to find diplomatic, not military, solutions to global conflicts and terrorism = GOOD idea. Howard Dean is on the right track here. So are Sens. Kerry and Edwards.<p>&#8226; Accepting the doctrine of preemptive invasion as a US military standard = BAD idea. Only Lieberman thinks that any country has the right to preemptively invade and conquer a nation by which it feels threatened. A fundamental rule of war is that <I>you do not attack a country unless it has attacked you</I>. Lieberman was not alive when FDR made the decision to declare war on the Axis powers in 1941. He could have done it before Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. He may have even wanted to. But he was smart, and he chose to wait until he <I>knew</I> that the United States was in danger. You must know this before you go to war.<p>&#8226; Refusing to enact any further tax cuts until the federal budget is balanced, the states have been granted federal aid, and needed investments in education, health care and national security have been made = GOOD idea. All the candidates seem to be in agreement here. The deficit needs to be paid down and the debt paid off so our children do not have to inherit interest payments exceeding half a trillion dollars and a debt equaling three-quarters (or more) of the national economic output.<p>&#8226;&#160;Repealing most, or all, of the 2001 Bush tax cut to pay for more programs = BAD idea. I personally think few things could be better for the country right now, but it just won't pass. The Republican attack dogs will paint repeal of any past tax cuts (even ones that haven't gone into effect yet, as Bush's won't until 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010) as a tax <I>increase</I>, a blatant lie but one they won't have a hard time getting the American public to believe. The Democrats should leave the past alone and concentrate on the future.<p>&#8226; Other good things I heard were Edwards's proposal to create an Office of Civil Liberties and Civil Rights (it could be abbreviated OCLCR, and pronounced ""Okelcocker""), Kerry's belief that fuel efficiency standards in automobiles and SUVs should be increased substantially to help the US become independent of foreign oil, and Sharpton's idea that the US Constitution should be amended to guarantee that all votes in every federal election are counted fairly and equally (California enacted such an amendment in 2000, after reports that boxes full of paper ballots from previous elections were discovered adrift in the San Francisco Bay).<p>In conclusion, the Democrats must now look back at this debate and make some hard decisions. Kucinich, Sharpton, and Braun are too controversial, too divisive and too liberal to ever be elected president. They are all good people and have good cases for their candidacies, but the American electorate will simply never go along with them. The rest of the candidates should then decide which of them is the most charismatic and likable--probably not Kerry or Lieberman, most likely Dean, Edwards, or Graham--and agree to throw all their support behind one Democrat to defeat Bush in 2004. Near the end of the debate, Kucinich said:<p>""Imagine a president who's willing to stand up to the Enrons of America. Imagine a president who's willing to stand up to the monopolies in energy, and in health care, and in transportation and communications. Imagine a president who comes from the cities and will fight for working men and women, and fight for the poor.""<p>If the Democrats don't get their act together and find a presidential candidate the American people will actually vote for, that president will continue to be a figment of our imaginations, through 2004 and beyond."

Why don't things like that ever happen to me? I'd like to meet a cute stranger and give her my phone number and spend some time getting to know her. Then again, time is a brutal thing...

Speaking of which, I have absolutely NO time these days. In the next few weeks, I have to go to Davis at least twice and meet with potential apartmentmates for the fall, I have to complete ALL of my statistics homework that has been due this spring and turn it in, I have to continue research on my 15-page research paper due in Comparative Politics in mid-June, and I have to work extra hours because my dumbass coworker Jesse is going on vacation DURING THE WEEK I HAVE FINALS. Sounds great...

But nothing could be as great as the emptiness in my soul from losing a good friend. The hardest part about losing someone (especially the way I did) is knowing that you probably deserve all the hurt and pain from it, and that you're just going to have to deal with it. That having been said, if you're reading this now I'd like you to know, well, a lot of things.

I'd like you to know that I miss you and I understand why you don't miss me. When I get too comfortable with people I sometimes become dependent on them and open the doors for them to become dependent on me. The best thing I can say about this is that I'm working on it, and that I'm sorry for having been such a drag.

I'd like you to know that I will never forget you and that you had a great impact on my life, and that I think I had a similar-sized impact on yours. I hope mine was mostly good, but I suspect it was not.

I'd like you to know that I regret things having to end the way they did, and that I regret having taken the actions I took that caused them to end that way. Apologies will never take back broken promises and I understand that now.

Finally, I'd like you to know that I have no agenda in writing this to you now, because chances are, you're not even reading it. If you are, though, all I'm doing is getting some thoughts out. Nothing else.

That's all for now. Sorry for taking so long to update, but in case you couldn't tell I'm busy. Drop me a line everyone - I'm never too busy to chat for a bit."

Few things can match this kind of decision for sheer stupidity.

<I>U.S. Draws Up Secret Plan to Impose New Regime on Iraq

Under the plan, the government will consist of 23 ministries, each headed by an American. Every ministry will also have four Iraqi advisers appointed by the Americans, the Guardian has learned.

The government will take over Iraq city by city. Areas declared ""liberated"" by General Tommy Franks will be transferred to the temporary government under the overall control of Jay Garner, the former US general appointed to head a military occupation of Iraq.</I>

What the fuck is WRONG WITH US???? This is not our country! This country has NEVER posed a serious, imminent or even moderately dangerous threat to the United States!! Yes, they've fought (and killed) American soldiers each of the times we've invaded them. THAT'S WHAT YOU DO WHEN AN AGGRESSIVE COUNTRY INVADES YOURS.

King George IV is not just setting a ""dangerous"" precedent with his doctrine of pre-emptive invasion; he's setting an imperial one. We are an empire now and he is our Darth Vader. I am ashamed of this place and ashamed to be an American. I have lost all love for what makes this country great because I cannot believe it is great any more. We are murderers. We are invaders. We are conquerors.

Another interesting thing in the article:

<I>The most controversial of [the] proposed appointees [to run the new pro-American dictatorship] is Ahmed Chalabi, the head of the opposition Iraqi National Congress, together with his close associates, including his nephew. During his years in exile, Mr Chalabi has cultivated links with Congress to raise funds, and has become the Pentagon's darling among the Iraqi opposition. The defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, is one of his strongest supporters. The state department and the CIA, on the other hand, regard him with deep suspicion.

He has not lived in Iraq since 1956, apart from a short period organising resistance in the Kurdish north in the 1990s, and is thought to have little support in the country.

Mr Chalabi had envisaged becoming prime minister in an interim government, and is disappointed that no such post is included in the US plan. Instead, the former banker will be offered an advisory job at the finance ministry.</I>

ExCUSE me?! Not only are we cocky enough to think we deserve a say in who run's Iraq's new government, but we won't appoint a man who has spent his entire life fighting oppression and totalitarianism (most of it in the form of Saddam Hussein)? So WHAT if he hasn't lived in Iraq since 1956! Tommy Franks has NEVER lived in Iraq! Donald Rumsfeld has NEVER lived in Iraq! He's ""...thought to have little support in the country""? I've got news for you, Georgie -- SO ARE WE! No Iraqi in his right mind would see us as ""liberators,"" because we're not! There is not ONE shred of evidence to convince me that a new Iraqi regime will EVER be democratic or free... we're merely transferring the dictatorship from someone who hates the US to someone that likes us.

I wish Rumsfeld and Cheney and Bush (and that godawful bitch Condoleeza Rice) DID live in Iraq these days. Right in the heart of Baghdad, in one of Saddam's presidential palaces. Right there. No, a little to the left, please... yes, right there."

"event","In a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll conducted Jan. 25-27, 2002, some 1,011 adults (820 whites and 146 blacks) were asked the question, ""Do you think corporations who made profits from slavery in the United States should or should not apologize to black Americans who are descendants of slaves?"" Of all respondents, 55% said they should not; 40% said they should. Blacks and whites were divided, with 68% of blacks saying corporations should apologize and 62% of whites saying they shouldn't.

In a ABC News poll from June 28-July 9, 2000, participants were asked, ""Do you think the federal government should or should not apologize to black Americans for the slavery that once existed in this country?"" Of all 2,018 adults who responded, 49% said the government should not apologize, and 42% said it should. Again, there was a racial divide--blacks favored apology, 66%-24%, while whites opposed it, 53%-38%.

Keep in mind that these questions say <I>nothing</I> about the government, or corporations, paying reparations for slavery, or supporting any kind of racial preferences to make up for four centuries of exploitation and humiliation. All they ask is whether the blacks who are impoverished and living in ghettos today deserve apologies for what was done to their ancestors. Germany has apologized, on countless occasions, for what the Nazis did to the Jews and to humanity during World War II; Russia has apologized for its brutal practices under communism. But whites in America don't think the federal government should at least say <I>sorry</I> for enslaving an entire race of people?

Why are modern-day whites so sensitive about slavery and its repercussions? What gives us license to think that because slavery was officially outlawed 140 years ago, the playing ground is somehow level today?"

"event","<I>Red Dragon</I> is the fourth adaptation of a Hannibal Lecter tale to make it to film, and the second adaptation of Thomas Harris's <I>Red Dragon</I>, the first having been <I>Manhunter</I> in 1986. Although inferior to that film (and its groundbreaking followup, 1991's <I>The Silence of the Lambs</I>), Red Dragon will no doubt exceed expectations after the largely negative reaction to 2001's bizarre (and strangely humorous) <I>Hannibal</I>.

Each has been helmed by a talented, unique director with his own style--<I>Manhunter</I> by Michael Mann, whose <I>The Insider</I> was robbed of several Academy Awards in 1999, <I>Silence</I> by Jonathan Demme, who earned a well-deserved Oscar for his directorial skills, and <I>Hannibal</I> by Ridley Scott, whose 30-year career has run the gamut from modern masterpieces (<I>Alien</I>, <I>Blade Runner</I>, <I>Black Hawk Down</I>) to mediocre pseudo-epics (<I>The Duellists</I>, <I>1492: Conquest of Paradise</I>, <I>Gladiator</I>) and overrated feminist diatribes (<I>Thelma & Louise</I>, <I>G.I. Jane</I>).

So how does Brett Ratner (<I>Rush Hour</I>, <I>The Family Man</I>) fare with his first suspense film? He certainly makes it more suspenseful than the Mann film or Harris's novel, by delving further into the psychology of the Tooth Fairy (Ralph Fiennes), the antagonist, and giving more screen time to beloved flesh-eater Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), who was not considered a major character by Harris until <I>Silence</I> won big at the box office and the Oscars, and ""Hannibal the Cannibal"" became a fan favorite.

The major problem with <I>Red Dragon</I> is that it does not portray Will Graham (Edward Norton), the FBI agent who caught Lecter and is now on the trail of the Tooth Fairy, as an interesting or sympathetic character. In <I>Manhunter</I>, William Peterson (now starring every week in <I>CSI</I>) played Graham as a man torn apart by his desire to catch a cold-blooded murderer and his loyalty to his family, a man so scared to once again enter the mind of a serial killer that he does it more to purge his inner demons than to find the Tooth Fairy. Norton's Graham, however, is little more than your average TV show cop working hard on a case. That's not to say his performance is bad; it just isn't exciting in any way.

The three other main characters in the film--Lecter, the Tooth Fairy (a.k.a. Frances Dolarhyde) and his victim, the blind Reba McClane, are all superbly played, by Hopkins, Fiennes and Emily Watson, respectively. Hopkins's portrayal of the character has already earned him an Oscar, so nothing new needs to be said about it. Fiennes develops Dolarhyde into a sympathetic monster (unlike Tom Noonan's abridged performance in <I>Manhunter</I>) trapped by his own demons into believing in a deity known as the ""Red Dragon,"" inspired by a William Blake painting, who commands him to kill innocent men, women, and children. And Emily Watson--thank God for Emily Watson--expands upon the commendable Joan Allen's performance of Reba, the blind girl who takes pity on Frances Dolarhyde, and who develops with him the first human relationship he has ever had. She is, as usual, nothing short of magnificent.

<I>Red Dragon</I>'s budget is also significantly larger than <I>Manhunter</I>'s, allowing the audience to see what may or may not have been Thomas Harris's complete vision. Certainly it is a larger version of it; the buildings, the trees, the cities all dwarf their 1986 counterparts. The music is also more complex; this time a full orchestra accompanies the action, as opposed to the lone synthesizer that very clearly identifies <I>Manhunter</I> as a product of the mid-1980s.

The underlying problem with Harris's story, though, is that it is not much of a story. Brilliant cop captures brilliant cannibalistic serial killer, then retires from the force due to emotional damage. (Ratner also adds a graphic stabbing, which I do not recall being present in the novel.) When new, unidentifiable serial killer starts slaughtering families in different cities every full moon, cop is called upon to assist. Cop is reluctant but turns to imprisoned cannibal for help. Cannibal offers it because his intellect needs a challenge, and cop is soon hot on the chase. The only way to make <I>Red Dragon</I> worth watching is to spruce up an otherwise bland plot with good performances, stirring cinematography and skilled editing, all of which the new film succeeds at.

For a near-perfect detective movie, watch <I>The Silence of the Lambs</I>. For some good thrills and suspenseful atmosphere, check out <I>Manhunter</I> or, if it's not available, <I>Red Dragon</I>. They're all worth watching and yes, <I>Red Dragon</I> does feature Frankie Faison as Barney, the guard at Lecter's institution, the only actor to appear in all four films."

"event","I realize my last post was a little random, but (in case you couldn't tell) I'd just seen <I>Below</I> and <I>Ghost Ship</I>, and I wanted to write about them. It turns out I'd misjudged critical response to each film; based on word-of-mouth from several coworkers and each film's respective box office grosses, I assumed that <I>Ghost Ship</I> was the more respected film. Some quick internet research, however, showed that <A HREF=""http://www.suntimes.com/index/ebert.html"" target=""_new"">Roger Ebert</A> awarded two and a half stars to <I>Below</I> and two to <I>Ghost Ship</I> (neither of which qualifies for the coveted ""thumbs up"" blurb); and that <I>Below</I> received a cumulative <A HREF=""http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/Below-1112363/"" target=""_new"">63% rating</A> from the RottenTomatoes.com TomatoMeter, a synthesis of national critical perspectives, while <I>Ghost Ship</I> received a mere <A HREF=""http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/GhostShip-1117263/"" target=""_new"">11% score</A>, making the former a ""fresh"" tomato and the latter a ""rotten"" one.

So critics liked <I>Below</I> more than <I>Ghost Ship</I>, even though fifty-one people saw <I>Ghost Ship</I> for every one person that saw <I>Below</I>. Critics also panned <I>Star Wars: Episode II</I> and <I>Pearl Harbor</I>. So maybe there's <I>some</I> good taste left in the world.

Anyway, I wrote about those two movies because I felt like writing about them. Sometimes I write about politics or current events, because I feel like writing about those. Other times I feel like writing about my dull life. It all depends on my mood, and having stayed up all night for the third time in seven days, I'm more in a mood to collapse than anything else. Today I get to go to class (my English 165 teacher might let me make up all the work I've missed - yay!) for three hours, come home and sleep for about two and a half hours, then go to work for what should be one of the most painful eight-hour shifts in Movie Groove history.

Then I get to sleep again--hopefully for a good eight hours or more, as I've got to be at work at 9:00 tomorrow morning, which involves waking up at 8:00. I had a problem with this last week, and I ended up waking up at 10:30. But Scot hasn't said anything to me about a schedule change (yet); so I'll assume I'm working the same shift as usual. I do <I>not</I> want to get stuck working Friday and Saturday night; that sounds like such hell.

Well, little fishes, that's what's on <I>my</I> agenda for today. What are <I>you</I> doing, hmm?"

"event","Or maybe it's the art of boys photographing violent, gory deaths, men rescuing helpless women, and those predictable ""jumps"" that occur every time a character slowly pulls aside a curtain to reveal the rotting corpse of a friend/lover/shipmate. Roger Ebert once called <I>Fight Club</I> ""macho porn,"" implying that the film was meant for drunken white-trash chauvinists who get some kind of pleasure, sexual or otherwise, out of watching guys beat the crap out of each other. If <I>Fight Club</I> was macho porn, <I>Below</I> and <I>Ghost Ship</I> are gore porn--feature length films that exist largely to display a series of extended special effects sequences in which the film's main characters die, one by one, in inverse order of importance. (The black guy is always first, though.)

And yet, they somehow both work. <I>Ghost Ship</I> you have probably heard of. It was last year's ""Halloween movie,"" debuting in late October and making a mild ($30 million) splash at the box office. What the gore geeks missed, though, was David Twohy's <I>Below</I>, a similar and in some ways superior film that debuted the same week as <I>Ghost Ship</I> but raked in a mere $600,000 during its brief run. Both films are maritime horror, set at sea, and they both involve a small group of people trapped on board a broken sea vessel that may or may not be haunted.

In <I>Below</I>, Bruce Greenwood plays the captain of the U.S.S. Tiger Shark, a WWII-era submarine that comes across a sinking British medical ship and its three survivors, one of whom (Olivia Williams) is the first female the all-male crew of the Tiger Shark has seen in months, perhaps years. But the Brits may have brought something else aboard the ship--a spirit that appears only for moments at a time (usually in a mirror) and pulls creepy movie-ghost pranks, such as flipping on a record of Benny Goodman's ""Sing, Sing, Sing"" at the precise moment when everyone on board the ship is trying to be as quiet as possible.

Is the Tiger Shark really haunted, or is the crew just suffering from submarine fever? Or is there a saboteur on board? As the audience, we don't find out until midway through the film, but the ending is predictable. Nonetheless, director Twohy (<I>Pitch Black</I>, <I>The Arrival</I>) manages to create a claustrophobic, suspenseful atmosphere for at least the film's first hour. All is lost, though, when the pace picks up and characters start dying randomly, only because of a tired military movie twist involving honor, loyalty, integrity, etc. As a straight war movie, <I>Below</I> could have been quite good, and as a straight horror movie it might have been great. But it combines too many clich&#233;s from both genres to ever come across as anything more than a commendable effort from a talented but misguided director.

Unlike <I>Below</I>, Steven Beck's <I>Ghost Ship</I> does not try in any way to be subtle or eerie. Sometimes it doesn't even seem like it's trying to be scary. The plot (as if one was needed): Ferriman (Desmond Harrington) enlists salvage captain Murphy (Gabriel Byrne) and his small crew to recover a ghost ship floating in the international waters of the Bering Sea. International maritime law says ""finders keepers"" regarding abandoned ships, so Murphy and crew agree to take Ferriman out to recover the ghost ship, in the hopes of finding something valuable.

What they find is the Antonia Graza, an Italian luxury ship that disappeared in the North Atlantic in 1962. (Never mind that the Bering Sea is in the North Pacific and that the ship disappeared in the North Atlantic; if you've ever seen a slasher movie you know that the rules of geography don't apply in the universe of horror.) Its passengers were brutally slaughtered, it seems, in a scene that is played out at the beginning of the film and which may be the bloodiest mass death in R-rated horror history. Murphy and crew stumble across boxes full of pure gold bars, but also end up slowly being killed by some kind of supernatural force.

Again we have a mystery, one which we know will end in a mildly surprising but poorly written ""twist."" Again we have the feeling of being trapped, as Murphy's scavenger ship is mysteriously blown up and the survivors cannot get off the Antonia Graza. Again we have the feeling that, although paranormal forces are clearly at work, one or more characters may not be all they purport to be. And again we have the predictable jump scenes, the overdone (and not always realistic-looking) gore, and laughably bad dialogue that resembles a bad '80s teen movie.

The differences between the two films are sometimes slight and sometimes great, though to be sure, they both have their merits. <I>Ghost Ship</I> has the more fleshed-out, sympathetic characters (though one of them is the typical horny, shallow Black Man Who Must Die), while <I>Below</I> has more realistic dialogue and situations. <I>Ghost Ship</I> has a faster-moving plot for those who are bored easily, while <I>Below</I> has a nice, creepy buildup for those who appreciate good suspense. Nonetheless, both films are far from perfect, as ages-old clich&#232;s abound and corny endings never fail to disappoint. If you're looking for a good fright flick to shell out the $4 rental fee for (which you shouldn't be spending anywhere except The Movie Groove), skip <I>Ghost Ship</I> and <I>Below</I>--watch the former at a party and the latter with a loved one--and rent <I>The Ring</I>."

"event","Dear Iraqis,

You have suffered many hardships, and done so with courage and strength. For decades, you have had to live under an evil dictator who has robbed you of your freedoms and been unafraid to systematically execute any of you who publicly disagree with his government. He will soon be dead.

When the president of my country tells you that your hour of liberation is near, he is both right and wrong. You will soon be freed from Saddam Hussein's tyrannical rule, but there is no guarantee that he will be replaced by a democratically elected government of your choosing. History shows that, in most of the regimes that have been ""changed"" by the United States, democracy has rarely been employed. See El Salvador, the Phillippines, Cuba, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Afghanistan, Iran, and so forth. A new dictator, funded and supported by the United States, may well rise to power in Iraq. Be ready for this.

I am sorry that you and your children must die because both of our countries are ruled by dictators, propped up by phony election results, who cannot stop bickering with one another. They are both evil men and I hope they spend eternity in hell with each other as punishment for their crimes.

Already most of the South of your country has been taken by what our news media calls ""coalition forces,"" but is really a group comprised of about two-thirds American soldiers and one-third British troops. There is no ""coalition"" to invade your country because the world, by and large, does not want war. Only Tony Blair and George W. Bush do. I am glad that so many of you have surrendered to these forces already, because it means that less of you will have to be slaughtered by them.

In a matter of days, soldiers will begin marching into Baghdad, your nation's capital. We estimate that 5.7 million people live in Baghdad. Somewhere in that city, we believe, is Saddam Hussein. It is the stated goal of our president to remove Hussein from power, which surely means killing him. Finding him will not be easy; he has at least four doubles who look exactly like him and know how to impersonate him. He knows how to hide very well, which is not difficult in a city almost the size of New York.

I am saying this to you right now with the utmost seriousness: in order to find and kill Saddam Hussein, U.S. and British forces will have to decimate Baghdad. The city will be completely destroyed. Already it is under heavy bombing. This bombing will increase rapidly over the next several days, and when our soldiers march into the metropolis, they will destroy what the airplanes did not. Please, for your own sake, <I>get out of Baghdad.</I>

Many of you do not have cars or any other means of transportation. (I am sure any type of train or transit system Baghdad once had has been destroyed by now.) If you must, leave the city on foot, and get as far away from it as you can. Civilian lives may or may not be spared in the hunt for your president; ours does not care about civilian casualties and may order the soldiers to tear apart the city with indiscriminate rage. It is in your best interests to leave immediately.

Again, I am sorry that this has had to happen to you. I wish our government were more trustworthy, our president more honorable, so I could honestly believe that democracy will be brought to the new Iraq. But his father did not bring democracy to Kuwait when it was liberated in 1991; he reinstalled that country's king. Be prepared, be on the run, and be safe.

May God, or Allah, or whoever you believe in, bless your souls and protect your children.

David O'Brien

"event","On March 18, a man named Louis Jones, Jr., was executed by the federal government (only the third federal execution since 1963, the last having been Timothy McVeigh in 2001). Although President Bush's office was flooded with letters urging him to commute Mr. Jones's sentence, he refused, evidently too busy preparing to execute some Iraqi children.

Jones, a Gulf War veteran who served as a U.S. Army Airborne Ranger for 22 years, was convicted of kidnapping, raping, and murdering Army Private Tracy McBride in February 1995. Is there any doubt that he committed those crimes? Hardly. But consider what happened to Mr. Jones.

In 2000, Jones was informed by the Pentagon that, along with 130,000 other soldiers, he had been exposed to low levels of nerve gas toxins during the Gulf War, when American troops destroyed an Iraqi nerve gas depot. All medical evidence shows that such toxins can cause serious brain damage leading to aggressive, violent behavior, and Dr. Robert W. Haley presented evidence to the jury that Jones had had displayed signs of ""irritability and hostility, and numerous neurological symptoms.""

Last year, in <A HREF=""http://www2.law.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/foliocgi.exe/historic/query=%5Bgroup+f_capital+punishment!3A%5D/doc/%7Bt124913%7D/hit_headings/words=4/pageitems=%7Bbody%7D?"" target=""_new"">Atkins vs. Virginia</A>, the Supreme Court held that execution of mentally retarded persons violated the Eighth Amendment's ban on ""cruel and unusual punishment,"" and outlawed the practice. They upheld a lower court's ruling that ""the imposition of the sentence of death upon a criminal defendant who has the mental age of a child between the ages of 9 and 12 is excessive."" But what about the execution of a defendant who has suffered severe brain damage at the hands of the government? Does that government have the right to take his life for a crime he might not have known was wrong?

To be fair, Jones was not retarded, nor stupid. He knew he had done a terrible thing, even if he did not know when he was doing it. In court, he apologized to the family of his victim and explained, ""If I live from now until the end of eternity with the pain that I have, it would never scratch the surface of the pain that you have.... I took a life that wasn't mine."" But it is likely that he would not have taken that life had he not been asked to fight in the Persian Gulf by the very same government that executed him 12 years later.

Another, perhaps more disturbing, fact has been revealed in the Jones case. The jury was misinformed by the judge, who told them that their sentencing options were death, life without possibility of parole, or a third option which might have allowed Jones to be released from prison after a certain amount of time. The third option had been fabricated by the judge, however, and his lie misled the jury, effectively tricking them into sentencing Jones to death. Most jurors, it turned out after the trial, would have preferred life without parole, but the false existence of a third option convinced them that life without parole would not actually be life without parole, so they chose execution.

This was a <I>federal judge</I> who intentionally lied to a jury about the life or death of a convicted criminal. (And we consider lying about oral sex cause for impeachment.) As to why he lied, I have no idea; but in <I>Ring vs. Arizona</I> (2002) the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that judges could not make life-or-death decisions for convicts; that only juries were endowed with such a right, in accordance with the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of trial by jury. If this federal judge lied to a grand jury in order to ensure that Mr. Jones would be executed, he effectively ""chose"" capital punishment for Jones, and is in violation of the U.S. Constitution and his oath to uphold it. The standard he sets (judges lying to juries about sentencing options) is a frightening one for future cases, and to ensure that it does not continue, he should be impeached and removed from office."

I told him he didn't have to even come in until 3:00 in the afternoon.

Femme Fatale and Killing Me Softly are labeled ""Erotic Thriller"" and Sex & Lucia is labeled ""Erotic Drama.""

Having not watched <I>any</I> of the televised lectures for my Health Science class, one would think I am screwed, as the test is less than 24 hours away at the time of this writing. However, I recall my ""B"" in the online Brigham Young University ""Basic Health"" course was earned largely because General Health Science is not a terrifically challenging course. Most people know that the bones need calcium, 60 minutes of exercise per day are recommended, and that STDs are bad.

The other tests should not be too difficult -- my grade on the last Microeconomics exam was 92 out of 100, and my Statistics professor allows us to bring one full page of notes (both sides) to class for the exam. Human Biology merely requires intense studying and mental anguish, both of which I'm prepared to endure for the privilege of going to UC Davis.

Composition and Literature, the <I>other</I> college-level English course I'm taking (classified as English 110), is a unique situation. Our beloved Professor Derrick Williams is horribly sick and has been hospitalized for a few weeks now; only this Monday were we assigned a substitute professor to take over the course for (perhaps) the remainder of the semester. She seems quite nice and very French. (How appropriate that we are studying <I>Madame Bovary</I>, Gustave Flaubert's French classic. Er, sorry, his ""Freedom"" classic.)

Starting on Monday, I should start working out at Ca&#241;ada's Fitness Center, where I am required to have 48 hours of exercise time logged by the end of the semester. Thus far I have zero. Exercising 6 hours a week until May 23, the last day of the school year, will save me, but barely.

And if you thought my school nightmare was over, you were wrong. DEAD wrong. (I really couldn't think of anything witty to say here. Sorry.)

In order to earn my Associate of Arts Degree in Political Science this year, I have to take an Ethnic Studies course, an unfortunate fact I discovered just weeks ago, far too late to join a new class at Ca&#241;ada. I was informed, however, that Foothill College offers a bevy of online courses which satisfy this requirement. Thus, on April 7th I begin my new online Ethnic Studies course, ""Music of Multicultural America."" Sounds like fun to me too. (Decide for yourself if that was sarcasm. No, really; decide for yourself. <A HREF=""mailto:flyncherberg@yahoo.com"" target=""_new"">E-mail me</A> and let me know what you think.)

But wait... theeeeeere's more! (If you're a girl and you can guess what movie that quote is from, you get a hug and a kiss from me. Hint: it's from 1996's <I>Scream</I>.) In order to be accepted into UC Davis's Political Science/Public Service program, I must complete a course in Comparative Politics. No such course is offered, or has ever been offered, at Ca&#241;ada, to the best of my knowledge. Nor the College of San Mateo. Foothill to the rescue, one more time! That's right -- Politics 2, Comparative Politics, begins April 8th in Room 3307 at Foothill College, and continues every Tuesday and Thursday from 12:00 to 1:20 p.m., until June 23d.

In case you haven't been keeping track, this means that from the beginning of the Foothill spring quarter (April 7) through the end of the Ca&#241;ada spring semester (May 23) I will be taking <I>eight</I> classes -- Advanced Composition, Principles of Microeconomics, Composition and Literature, Elementary Probability and Statistics, Human Biology, General Health Science, Ca&#241;ada Fitness Center, Music of Multicultural America, and Comparative Government and Politics.

As if such pain weren't enough (because it never is), I have a volunteer internship in <A HREF=""http://democrats.assembly.ca.gov/members/a21"" target=""_new"">Assemblyman Joe Simitian</A>'s District Office in Palo Alto, every Monday and Wednesday from 1:00 to 4:00 p.m. On top of <I>that</I>, I work part time at the Movie Groove, every Tuesday and Friday evening, and Saturday and Sunday morning. Don't forget Phi Theta Kappa, the International Honor Society of the Two Year College, which meets every Thursday afternoon at 2:30. Or College Council, the student/faculty advisory board to Ca&#241;ada College President Rosa Perez that meets every other Thursday at 1:30. That, and I have two cats.

This may just be irrelevant whining, or it may be a hidden plea for sympathy. Either way, some sympathy would be appreciated. Guys, any money (or DVDs) you can spare would be appreciated. Girls, some hugs, kisses, and maybe even a little naked lovin' (wait... did I just type that?) would be awfully nice.

What I'm really trying to do with this entry is update my friends on what's going on with me right now, and explain why I may not be too available to talk or hang out over the next eight to ten weeks. I love you all anyway, and I hope to see you when I recover from my inevitable nervous breakdown.

Until then... toodle-oo!"

The deal with ANWR is that Bush and his oil cronies want to drill for oil there, in the beautiful wilderness of Alaska, destroying an environmental landmark. If it sounds like a worthy sacrifice to you (after all, the United States <I>should</I> endeavor itself to becoming independent of foreign oil), consider:

The United States uses 20 million barrels of oil per day. ANWR has, according to Interior Department estimates, 5.7 to 16 billion barrels worth of oil that could be drilled -- enough to last between 285 and 800 days. But environmental groups estimate that only 3.2 billion barrels may be economically worth pumping.

So Bush, and 48 senators, think the U.S. government should destroy one of the last great environmental preserves in this country for as little as 160 days (five months) worth of oil?"

"event","How sad that the people who oppose this war will be the ones burning the American flag, and the people who support it will be the ones flying the flag. It should be the other way around.

The people who oppose this war do so because they believe it will increase the possibility of terrorist strikes against the United States; because it will demolish one out of every ten buildings in Iraq, killing thousands of innocent men, women and children; because it is in violation of both the United States Constitution and the United Nations Charter; and because it gives the U.S. license to invade and conquer any country it perceives to represent a potential future threat. These people should be flying the flag.

The people who support this war do so because they are imperialists, because they think the United States, as the most powerful nation on Earth, has a responsibility to exercise that power by taking over whichever nations it wants to. They are symbolically burning the flag already, and all the freedoms it represents. They should burn it, literally.

I am an American, something I used to be proud of. My flag was flown, and saluted, by men who loved freedom, by men who were willing to die for it, who were willing to kill their oppressors (but not their wives or their children) to be free. Bush, Cheney, Ashcroft, Rumsfeld--they represent everything those men hated. They are not Americans. They do not deserve to fly our flag, or salute it.

I will fly my flag during this war, but I will try to supplement it with another symbol, such as the Peace sign, or one of those ""Peace is Patriotic"" stickers. I love this country because I love peace, and freedom. Bush does not love this country. He loves only power."

"event","I'm beginning to think conservatives are just bad with numbers. From Ronald Reagan's hilarious ""We will balance this budget by 1984"" pledge (the 1984 federal budget ran an on-budget deficit of almost $200 billion) to George W.'s debate quips about Al Gore using ""fuzzy math"" and inventing the ""caculator,"" they just can't seem to get the facts in line. <A HREF=""http://www.billoreilly.com/index.jsp"" target=""_new"">Bill ""I'm not a right winger!"" O'Reilly</A> has claimed on his ""No Spin Zone"" TV show that current polling shows Americans evenly split between being ""pro-choice"" and ""pro-life,"" and Alan W. Dowd of the ultraconservative <A HREF=""http://www.hudson.org/"" target=""_new"">Hudson Institute</A> said, in a January 21 <A HREF=""http://www.hudson.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=publication_details&id=2159"" target=""_new"">article</A>, ""There may not yet be a pro-life majority, but there's definitely no longer a pro-choice majority."" His justification for these ridiculous statements? A whopping two Gallup polls, one from 1995. (He provided no weblink to the Gallup website or a news story confirming these polls' existence, nor did he mention the types of polling used, number of persons surveyed, or margins of error.)

Polls are tricky. They can often mislead a person (or an entire country), forcing one to believe that an entire nation's ideological swing can be ascertained from a question asked of a thousand people (or less). But several polls, conducted by several (reliable) organizations, with relatively low margins of error and almost identical questions asked, can be extraordinarily accurate in what they report.

Consider the following, from the excellent <A HREF=""http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm"" target=""_new"">Polling Report</A> website on abortion:

- A CBS News/New York Times poll conducted Jan. 19-21 of last month shows 77 percent of Americans agreeing that abortion should be ""generally available to those who want it"" or ""available, but under stricter limits than it is now."" Just 22 percent agreed that ""Abortion should not be permitted."" (814 adults surveyed; 4% margin of error)

- An ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted Jan. 16-20 shows 57 percent agreeing that abortion should be ""legal in all cases"" or ""legal in most cases,"" and 42 percent finding it should be ""illegal in most or all cases."" (17 percent think it should be ""illegal in all cases."") (1,133 adults surveyed; 3% margin of error)

- A Time/CNN poll conducted Jan. 15-16 has somewhat different results: 81 percent think ""a woman should be able to get an abortion if she wants one no matter what the reason"" OR ""abortion should only be legal in certain circumstances."" Just 15 percent think it should be ""illegal in all circumstances."" (1,010 adults surveyed; 3.1% margin of error)

Detailed analysis of these surveys is not required to tell us what we already know: that most Americans support a woman's right to choose, although not under every circumstance. (This concurs with the generally held belief that there are few things one SHOULD be able to do in every imaginable circumstance.) How many Americans believe this? It is impossible to tell, but perhaps between 57 and 81 percent. A bare minimum think it should never be legal; this number could be as high as 22 percent, or as low as 15 percent.

As for the issue of ""pro-choice"" versus ""pro-life,"" O'Reilly is not entirely wrong. Observe:

- That same Time/CNN poll finds 49 percent identifying with the ""pro-choice"" position (""supporting a woman's right to have an abortion"") and 45 percent going with ""pro-life"" (""protecting the rights of the unborn"").

- A Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll from Jan. 9-10 of last year shows 47 percent responding as ""pro-choice"" and 41 percent as ""pro-life."" (900 adults surveyed nationwide; 3% margin of error.)

- A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll from August 3-5 of 2001 finds 52 percent in the ""pro-choice"" column and 39 percent as ""pro-life."" (1,017 adults surveyed; 3% margin of error.)

So 39 to 45 percent of Americans may be ""pro-life,"" but they are still outnumbered (barely) by 47 to 52 percent, who are ""pro-choice."" I maintain that this is a tricky question to ask, since ""pro-life"" is not the proper term to use for opposing a woman's right to an abortion. A better term is ""anti-choice,"" since ""pro-life"" makes it seem like to be anything else is to be ""pro-death."" I suspect this has confused many a survey-taker. Consider:

- An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll from Jan. 19-21 has 59 percent of Americans agreeing that ""The choice on abortion should be left up to the woman and her doctor."" (500 adults surveyed; no margin of error given.)

- The Jan. 16-20 ABC News/Washington Post poll indicates that 54 percent of Americans support the Supreme Court's 1973 <A HREF=""http://www2.law.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/foliocgi.exe/historic/query=[Group+410+U!2ES!2E+113!3A]!28[level+Case+Citation!3A]!7C[group+citemenu!3A]!29/doc/{@1}/hit_headings/words=4/hits_only?firsthit"" target=""_new""><I>Roe vs. Wade</I></A> ruling, which established a woman's right to an abortion, and 44 percent oppose it.

- The Jan. 15-16 poll from Time/CNN shows 55 percent supporting <I>Roe</I>, with 40 percent opposed.

- In a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll, 53 percent of respondents said <I>Roe vs. Wade</I> was a ""good thing"" for the country, and 30 percent said it was a ""bad thing."" (1,002 adults surveyed; 3% margin of error.)

- A Los Angeles Times poll from Dec. 12-15 of last year indicates that 46 percent of Americans support <I>Roe</I> and 37 percent oppose it. (1,305 adults survyeed; 3% margin of error.)

If 46 to 55 percent of Americans support the controversial <I>Roe vs. Wade</I> decision, now 30 years old and still going strong, and 30 to 44 percent oppose it, asserting that the country is split between pro-choice and ""pro-life"" thinkers is an out-and-out lie. (Sorry, Mr. O'Reilly, but that is a classic example of ""spin,"" which the very title of your show claims to reject.) The same goes for you, Mr. Dowd--there IS a pro-choice majority in this country, even if it's not as large as it should be. My advice to the right would be to do the fuzzy math, get a CALCulator, and start doing some serious poll-watching. Your numbers aren't looking so good."

"event","""If this country accepts the idea that homosexual liaisons are the same as traditional marriage, which is a God-ordained building block of society, this country is on the road to hell in a handbasket."" (Pat Buchanan, Meet the Press, 1 Oct 2000)

The Right always has a problem getting its facts straight. In his new magazine, ""The American Conservative,"" 2000 presidential candidate Pat Buchanan (who spent $25 million and received a whopping <A HREF=""http://www.uselectionatlas.org/USPRESIDENT/GENERAL/pe2000.html"" target=""_new"">0.43% of the nationwide popular vote</A>) rejects the ""Establishment Right"" and labels himself a more traditional (read: racist) conservative. While ""New"" Republicans reject affirmative action and racial preferences, claiming to favor a ""colorblind"" society, Buchanan is a blatant xenophobe--his latest book is <A HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312302592/qid=1043531438/sr=2-3/ref=sr_2_3/103-2063125-1812616"" target=""_new"">""The Death of the West: How Dying Populations and Immigrant Invasions Imperil Our Country and Civilization,""</A> and he has become infamous for his ridiculous soundbytes, such as claiming that Hitler never presented a direct threat to the United States during World War II, and that celebrating Earth Day is like ""worship[ing] dirt.""

So you know right away that, as intelligent as he is, Buchanan cannot be taken seriously. (Texas columnist Molly Ivins said that his speech about ""culture wars"" at the 1992 Republican National Convention ""sounded better in the original German."") Yet people DO listen to the man--he was a speechwriter and senior adviser to Presidents Nixon and Reagan, and his quest for the 1996 Republican presidential nomination nearly succeeded. 

The first thing Buchanan needs to learn is that Americans--rather, the people HE calls Americans--are themselves an ""immigrant invasion."" Think about it. How many Anglo-Saxons lived on the North or South American continent before 1492? Not many that I can name. Since then, untold millions (billions?) of Europeans have migrated here, often conquering, killing and slaughtering in the name of ""Manifest Destiny."" Not many Latinos or Asians have come to the United States to murder great masses of whites, lead them down a Trail of Tears, or confine them to their own ""reservations"" to wither away and gamble.

In his latest column, <A HREF=""http://www.amconmag.com/01_27_03/buchanan.html"" target=""_new"">""The Apologists,""</A> Buchanan claims that President Lyndon Johnson's ""Great Society"" programs of the 1960s ""gave us deficits, crime waves, race riots in 100 cities, campus rampages by over-privileged brats, and another 'no-win war' into which a failing, incompetent liberal establishment had plunged the United States."" How does one address such an incompetent statement?

First, the deficits. Facts are facts, Pat, and the U.S. national debt soared from $1 trillion (accumulated from Presidents Washington through Carter) to $4 trillion in the twelve years of the Reagan and Bush administrations. <I>Bill Clinton was the first president to balance the federal budget since Lyndon Johnson.</I> If your Richard ""I am not a crook"" Nixon was so concerned about deficits, he could have ended Johnson's antipoverty programs initiated in the 1960s, but he didn't, because he realized their value in--gasp!--fighting poverty. Second, the ""crime waves"" claim. President Clinton put hundreds of thousands of new police officers on the streets in his eight years, and overall crime has dropped significantly.

I could also address the ""campus rampages by over-privileged brats"" (maybe he's referring to George W. Bush, the ""C"" student who somehow got into both Harvard and Yale, and who was arrested THREE TIMES during his college career, twice for drunk driving) statement, or his claim that the Great Society <I>domestic</I> programs helped further the Vietnam War (this is just ridiculous, akin to stating that last year's No Child Left Behind education bill caused the current conflict with Iraq; also, does Pat forget that it was his own President Nixon who began the secret bombings of Cambodia and Laos, two countries which <I>never</I> presented even a remote threat to the United States?). But what else does Pat say in this fascinating, entertaining and somewhat nauseating diatribe against liberals and moderates?

He claims that Michael Dukakis, governor of Massachusetts 1975-79 and 1983-91 and Democratic candidate for president in 1988, was responsible for a Massachusetts program allowing violent felons out on weekend furloughs, referring to the program as ""ACLU idiocy."" (Never mind that the American Civil Liberties Union had nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with the furlough program.) In 1988, Republican candidate George Bush (Sr.) aired TV ads claiming the very same thing--that the liberal, soft-on-crime Democrat Dukakis was letting murderers and convicted rapists (such as Willie Horton, who used his furlough to murder and rape once again) out on the weekends. The problem? The program was put in place by a <I>Republican</I> governor, Frank White! Mike Dukakis might have been our president if not for this idiotic act of right-wing hypocrisy.

Buchanan's last (but not least) distortion of the truth is his reference to a 1972 television ad run by Jesse Helms in his successful campaign for the Senate. The ad, according to Buchanan, ""show[ed] a pair of white hands crumbling a rejection letter for a job lost because of affirmative action."" Again, a very emotion ad, designed to appeal to conservative white voters who felt (rightly) that the government had no business forcing private companies to hire minorities. What they didn't realize is that the federal government has <I>never</I> required private businesses to hire anyone of a particular race or gender simply because of their race or gender. Racial preferences have only been applied to public universities and colleges, as well as government hiring practices. Any attempt to ""force"" private companies to use quotas or preferences would be unconstitutional and struck down immediately by the Supreme Court. Buchanan later says that ""Helms was right to spotlight a victim of the racist policy of reverse discrimination,"" but fails to mention that Helms's ""victim"" was entirely fictional.

Fictional is a good word to use when describing Buchanan's writing. He is like Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity, or any of the other far-right commentators who are unfraid to twist the truth, distort the facts, and use ridiculous hyperbole if they can win a few converts to their case. What the Left must now do is remove the wool from Americans' eyes, expose the truth at every corner, stand for facts and hard data instead of conjecture and exaggerated hypothesis. If not, we stand to lose everything that is great about free speech in America."

"event","""What can be more un-American than wearing the symbol of the rebel group [the Confederacy] that sought to destroy the United States, and build a new nation based on the subjugation of an entire race?"" (from DailyKOS.com)

Another great quote from <A HREF=""www.dailykos.com"" target=""_new"">DailyKOS</A> is one borrowed from the <A HREF=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A59577-2002Dec15.html"" target=""_new"">Washington Post</A>: ""As the Bush administration draws up plans to simplify the tax system, it is also refining arguments for why it may be necessary to shift more of the tax load onto lower-income workers.""

Ex-<I>cuse</I> me?! Let me see if I read that right--""...it may be necessary to shift more of the tax load onto lower-income workers.""

Let's go through this, shall we?

Bush is against a minimum wage increase; we know that. Until 2001, according to Paul Begala's excellent book ""Is Our Children Learning?: The Case Against George W. Bush"" and <A HREF=""http://www.media-services.com/states/minimum_wage.aspx"" target=""_new"">Media-Services.com</A>, Texas's minimum wage was $3.35 an hour (in September of last year, the Lone Star State officially ""accepted"" the federal minimum wage of $5.15 as its standard). That means that a full-time (40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year) Texan worker at the minimum wage level was earning just $6,700 per year during Dubya's reign as governor. (Fortunately, that full-time worker is now making a whopping $10,300 each year.)

What's the minimum wage have to do with lower-income workers and federal taxes? Good question. The ""payroll tax"" is the only universal federal tax, the one that everyone pays, regardless of his or her earnings. For Social Security, you and your employer each pay 6.2% of your wages to the federal government, and 1.45% for Medicare. That means that, in addition to the extra wages they might receive if their employer didn't have to pay the tax, every American worker pays a minimum of 7.65% of their paycheck to the government. 

But that is not true. The Social Security tax only applies to the first $60,600 of wages each year (the Medicare tax is paid in full by everyone); so that a maximum of $3,757 of wages may be taken out of a worker's pay annually. It is truly a regressive tax, for a person making $350,000 per year (the level at which one enters the ""richest one percent of Americans"" bracket) pays just 1.1% of their salary to Social Security. (If you make a million dollars a year, you're even luckier, because you pay just 0.4%.) 

So let's look at the minimum tax burden on those lucky Texan individuals making the minimum wage rate. Let's be generous and use the ""new"" $5.15 rate. An American lucky enough to make a paltry $10,300 per year pays $788 in payroll taxes, and their employer pays the same. A <I>real</I> tax cut, which would exempt workers living below the poverty line (approximately $18,000 per year in 2001), would save that worker $1,576 per year. That $1,576 sure might come in handy for buying their family food, paying for the heat during the winter, and the skyrocketing costs of medical care and prescription drugs.

But Bush doesn't want to do that. According to the <A HREF=""http://www.cbpp.org/"" target=""_new"">Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</A>, some 40 percent of last year's $1.35 trillion tax cut will benefit only that richest one percent of Americans. In plain English, this means about 1.3 million Americans (using the Census Bureau's figure of 130 million people in the active labor force) will get a collective total of $540 billion or so--roughly $415,000 per person. (The tax cut takes effect over ten years, but that's still a $41,500 raise each year that the richest million Americans will receive.) This also means that another 129 million workers (approximately) will have the other $810 billion to split over ten years, which averages out to $6,280 over ten years, or $628 per year.

So here is President Bush, urging tax cuts for richer Americans and tax hikes for the ones who actually get up off their asses and <I>work</I> for a living (no, sitting behind a desk all day doesn't count as working; no, I don't care if computer solitaire gets tiring). The fact is, working Americans are overtaxed, and wealthy Americans are not. <I>We</I> are the ones who run this country; <I>they</I> are the ones who collect. Call it class warfare if you want, but it's a war I'm willing to fight."

You might not know it, but that was said by Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1962, a hero to today's Republican party. Ike was, at heart, a moderate--he supported printing the words ""In God We Trust"" on U.S. currency and adding the phrase ""under God"" to the Pledge of Allegiance, but also dispatched the National Guard to Arkansas to enforce civil rights laws. The crowning achievement of Eisenhower's presidency, though, was the resolution of the Korean War. He traveled to Korea himself in December 1952 to revive the stalled peace talks, and an Armistice was signed in July 1953, ending a war that killed 150,000 Americans, 900,000 Chinese, and some two million Koreans. In his retirement, Eisenhower would later declare, ""The United States never lost a soldier or a foot of ground in my administration. We kept the peace."" But it is important to realize that, although the gunfire stopped half a century ago, the Korean War is not as ""over"" as it seems.

Today, two countries still exist (unlike the unified Vietnam that has held strong since the U.S.'s withdrawal from Saigon in the mid-1970s). <A HREF=""http://www.countrywatch.com/cw_country.asp?vCOUNTRY=91"" target=""_new"">North Korea</A> is a Communist nation of 25 million people, headed by the elusive dictator Kim Jong Il, and <A HREF=""http://www.countrywatch.com/cw_country.asp?vCOUNTRY=92"" target=""_new"">South Korea</A> is a capitalist stronghold, a shaky ally of the United States with twice the population and a democratic government. The two countries are far from friendly, and most of the world sides with South Korea, charging that Kim Jong Il's government in the North has a human rights record somewhere between that of China and Saudi Arabia, and that opening the door to free-market capitalism is the easiest solution to that country's woes. But the United States has other reason for concern.

Under a 1994 treaty signed by North Korea, nuclear weapons development in that country is strictly forbidden; but unlike Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong Il is more than happy to admit that his country is <A HREF=""http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&cid=574&ncid=721&e=2&u=/nm/20021226/wl_nm/korea_north_dc"" target=""_new"">in flagrant violation of the treaty</A>. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s nuclear weapons watchdog, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (as the North likes to call itself, despite the fact that it is neither democratic nor a republic) is developing at least one nuclear reactor for the possible creation of plutonium, which of course can be used in--get ready for it--Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). Kim Jong Il has yet to confirm or deny that this is his country's intent, but the U.S. government is on high alert, and the cowboy rhetoric that President Bush fed us this summer about Iraq is beginning to resurface. (You'll recall that North Korea was one of the three ""Axis of Evil"" nations Bush mentioned in his State of the Union address last January; now only Iran remains untouched by the strong words of Sheriff George Dubya Bush.)

According to the New York Times, the U.S. is <A HREF=""http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/22/weekinreview/22BROO.html"" target=""_new"">spending $3 billion a year</A> to keep South Korea safe from a possible invasion. Some 37,000 American troops are based in that country, and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld recently indicated that the United States has more than enough reserves to fight a war against Iraq and North Korea at the same time. Whoa, hold on there, partner! Who said anything about a war against North Korea? Certainly no one in the South. President-elect Roh Moo Hyun, who said he would not be ""kowtowing to the U.S."" during his November campaign, favors diplomatic talks with the North, as do China and Japan, two of the South's most strategic allies. The people of South Korea resent American war rhetoric; according to the same New York Times article, anti-American demonstrations and policies in and around Seoul are at an all-time high. Restauranteurs are refusing to serve Americans; papier-mache dolls of George W. Bush are being beaten and destroyed. So why are you and I sending $3 billion of our tax money overseas each year to protect this country? Good question.

If South Korea wants us out of the conflict, I say we should get out. I'm all for U.S. involvement in an international system, but let's send our money where it is actually wanted--say, Afghanistan, to fight poverty and disease, or to pro-democracy reformists in Iran. The South Koreans seem in no danger of an invasion from the North, but even if they are, they don't want us involved in it. Eisenhower's famed ""domino theory,"" which asserted that communism would spread its evil around the globe as more and more countries fell under the influence of the Soviet Union, has proved to be a massive failure. Cuban and North Korean-style communism will always be limited to small countries like Cuba and North Korea; both China and the U.S.S.R. were too big for Karl Marx's unorthodox economic theories. (Beijing likes to call itself communist, but Pat Robertson likes to call himself a Christian; it's all rhetoric.)

I'm no friend of big business, but the government ought to consider running itself more like a corporation, where there are wise investments and unwise ones; where there is money well spent and money not well spent. Three billion dollars a year to defend South Korea is a horrible investment. The Koreans don't want it, and I bet if most Americans read a newspaper every day they wouldn't be too happy about it either. The Bush administration could probably pass it off as a crucial aspect of the War on Terrorism, though. After all, every one of the September 11 hijackers came from the same continent as North Korea. <I>Every one!</I> How about that?"

"event","""A radical is a man with both feet firmly planted--in the air. A conservative is a man with two perfectly good legs who, however, has never learned to walk forward. A reactionary is a somnambulist walking backwards. A liberal is a man who uses his legs and his hands at the behest of his head."" (Franklin D. Roosevelt)

As the <A HREF=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A55724-2002Dec14.html"" target=""_new"">Republican Party looks to new leadership</A> following Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's racist comments last week, it is time to ask themselves whether they want to continue pursuing the reactionary course pushed by Lott and the ""new Republicans,"" or whether a new party message is in order.

A few possibilities have been floated as to who would replace Lott as majority leader. Don Nickles of Oklahoma is apparently interested in the post; the 54-year-old minority whip is what Gray Davis would call a ""true blue, think tank conservative,"" having supported energy deregulation and corporate tax cuts, and opposed a minimum wage increase. Bill Frist of Tennessee might also challenge Lott, or run for the seat if Lott resigns (as he should); despite having just eight years' experience in the Senate, Frist is a hero to the religious right, having been elected in 1994 on a platform supporting organized prayer in public schools.

Then there is Mitch McConnell. The senior senator from Kentucky deserves his own paragraph because he is one of the loudest, most cold-blooded and fearless men in the history of the Senate. McConnell has been the most outspoken opponent of campaign finance reform, staying up all night in 1994 filibustering one such bill. In 2000 he was given a 100 percent approval rating from the American Conservative Union, and 92 percent from the Christian Coalition.

The common link between these three men? They are all hard-right Christian conservatives, exactly what the Republican Party DOESN'T want right now. What the party should be looking for is a moderate, someone who will unite progressives and conservatives, and who might even bring some Democrats across the aisle to the GOP. My nomination for Senate Majority Leader? Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman.

You might remember Lieberman as Al Gore's running mate in the 2000 presidential election. A Democrat all his life, Lieberman was the first Jew on a major-party ticket. I suspect you are wondering why I am recommending a Democrat to lead the Republican Party in the Senate. I think it would reinvigorate the Grand Old Party, give it a badly-needed shot in the arm. There's no reason a moderate Jew shouldn't lead the party--Jews voted 77%-23% for Al Gore in 2000, and after last week's debacle over Trent Lott's comments, the Republicans should NOT look further to the right for their new leader.

The question is, could Lieberman do it? Or perhaps it is, would Lieberman want to do it? Despite his oft-repeated claims of party loyalty, Joe Lieberman is perhaps the most conservative Senate Democrat. He is very serious about his faith, and about moral issues; he believes that ""government should look to religion as a partner, as ... the Founders of our country did."" He supports the death penalty and a ""moment of silence"" (i.e., for prayer) in public schools. In 2000, before his selection as Gore's vice presidential nominee, Lieberman had supported vouchers for the District of Columbia's public school system, and had suggested that a partial privatization of Social Security might be the way to save the decades-old retirement system.

Of course Joe Lieberman will never defect from the Democrats. Of course the Republicans will never court him, or seek him as their top leader. They do not want a centrist in the top spot. They do not want to appeal to ""swing voters."" Because Americans just don't care anymore. The average American could not care less that the Republican leader in the United States Senate supports segregation and opposes civil rights bills. The average American ... oh, the hell with it, I'm going to Starbucks."

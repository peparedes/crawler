i really hope everything works out and falls into place in this next month.  today i became one step closer towards being on my own.  i tranfered my bank account so i had more control over it.  now my money from work goes straight to my bank.

also, i came up with an idea to make myself feel more accomplished.  i'm tired of writing stuff that doesn't matter, so hopefully soon, i will write out a peice that i will actually be proud of again and maybe people will actaully like and wanna read.  i won't ever be in a band.  i won't ever make designs for t-shirts.  i won't be able to name all these good musicians and their insrtuments.  i'm not good with people and i won't ever be able to jump into a converstation.  so i want to find something i can do besides being that kid that sits there and admires every one else's talents.  i want to continue to meet new people.  i want to find a reason to care about my health.  thanx to all the people who are already helping.

Everything will fall right into place
When we die, some sink and some lay
But at least I don't see you float away
And all the spilt milk, sex and weight
It all will fall, fall right into place

i just got home from wku.  i actually saw a few people i recognized when walking around campus.  i'm scared that's where i'll end up going, because i just learned uofl might not have the program i need.  i don't know.  something tells me i need to stay, but something else tells me i need a break from this city.  i would stay for my friends, but then i think of what i do this year.  i come home, sleep, wake up for dinner, and sleep till the next morning.  not always.  but a lot. i'm too shy to call up people cause i never have anything in particular to do.  i know it's my fault.  but i'm also broke.  my car has less than a quater of gas in it.  i don't know.  i'm actually in a good mood.  even if i went away, i would probably be home every weekend or so.  i just need this year to end.

oh yea...i'm gonna be an english teacher.  i don't know if anyone knew this...it seems the only thing right for me.  the funny thing is, i don't even know the parts of a sentance.  i'm horrible at grammar.  but i'm going to have my own lessons, to re-learn twelve years of english in one summer.

the best way to beat the system is to get in it.  then i can prove that there is a flaw in the education system, help try to fix it, and maybe actually effect atleast one kid like so many teachers have done for me.  the first lessons i will teach will be : we need to ""turn teaching completly around and say that primarily and fundamentally teaching is only the teaching of a need for the science and NOT the teaching of the science itself, whose need the student does not feel.""  ""it is not enough that I study.  It is also necessary that I should genuinely feel the need of this, that I be spontaneously and truly preoccupied with its questions; only then will I understand the answers it gives or tries to give.  No one can thouroughly understand an answer unless he has understood the question to which it replies."" - Jose(enter accect over the e) Ortega y Gasset.

That man is brilliant.

I don't expect to change the world.  but i know somewhere, kids need help, and they're crushed, because they don't like the hallways they're surrounded by.  they depress them, and most of the students around them, well, they don't understand what it's like to feel you're just going to collapse.  they go home, and sometimes cry because their parents don't understand why they don't smile all the time.  their friends are busy.  they shut themselves in their room and are beside themselves with grief and regret. i want to show these kids a light.  and tell them about a kid who once felt the same thing, who made it.  because he found hope.  and this kid will have a place to go, a room a little less like a prison to escape from if needed.  then they will write a story they are proud of. because they'll exchanged all their thoughts and beliefs with ink on paper. they will understand that while the world may be at war, they can be at peace."

"event","""What is vertigo?  Fear of falling?  Then why do we feel it even when the observation tower comes equipped with a sturdy handrail?  No, vertigo is something other than the fear of falling.  It is the voice of the emptiness below us which tempts and lures us, it is the desire to fall, against which, terrified, we defend ourselves.""

this makes me want to write a short story.  something tells me it would be an analogy of all our lives."

Under 12: You are a kid at heart. You still have an optimistic life view - and you look at the world with awe.

13-19: You are a teenager at heart. You question authority and are still trying to find your place in this world.

20-29: You are a twentysomething at heart. You feel excited about what's to come... love, work, and new experiences.

30-39: You are a thirtysomething at heart. You've had a taste of success and true love, but you want more!

40+: You are a mature adult. You've been through most of the ups and downs of life already. Now you get to sit back and relax.

"event","maybe an explanation is needed.  it's a poem.  short story.  writing.  whatever.  sometimes it rhymes or maybe not. i don't know.

i'm tired of this.  of that.
those comments i hear from the tv glowing
screeming in my face about how weak it is to be
a little more sensitive
a little more compassionate
than your average mr.
i don't want to live like this
if i could i would call it quits
but i'm grown enough to know there
is something more important than jokes
or people laughing
faces turning
when you pour out your mouth
leaving the words deserted
for everyone to pull apart
to take what they want and ruin you for what you are
if i could i would see through tears
comfort everyone in my reach
but i'm so far out of it
out of reach
i can only hope that i see hope in this life
and continue to live off of these sparks
that flash up like flares
or flames through the war into the house
where we all live and all dream of a world
where we all live and all dream of a world
where we all live and dream and scream emptyness
into the blackest night waiting for someone
to hear our calls
no time to wait
i'm done
because we all do this
but no one understands
that with everyone screaming the same words
no one has time to embrace love in their arms
or atleast a young kid
filled with hope
filled with love
filled with tears
blood
i'm out of reach
scream
into the lonely darkness i'll sleep tonight

"event","things have been good lately. i wrote something the other day at work and i thought i'd post it just because.
<lj-cut text=""un-named poetry"">
     part I
septembers one long day
a struggle a new reason
the people live in it
the leaves die
the trees mourn the loss
fall falling too quickly for any of us to grasp
the kids laugh because they understand
people scream chaos
complaints
confused
throughout the days growing shorter?
maybe i don't know
we don't know
a circle of thoughts leads back to the start
a simple act of writing
creates a silent work of art.
     part II
then there's those days when you're
""wow, i want to get up this morning
look at me i'm happy
oh look at him he's sad
why are you sad
don't be sad
it'll be okay
we'll tell lies today
we don't have to see there is a hole
we'll fill it up with dreams and laughter
and everything ever after""
the leaves will fall as thoughts of hope
but inhale the smile off my face
because you may not see it for a while
but i'm smiling so i'm happy?
     part III
then you wake up

cold breeze

truth

ink

memories of

love
loss
regret
hope

people we see as canvas for our thoughts
unaware of any pain the needle may cause
on the skin
hold it all in
so i can wash off my hands
the darkness burns like the comments to my brain
burning day after day
after day
I believe it will get better
i think i'll gain the knowledge
to forget the truth
i hide in the shadows of the trees
still mourning the loss

"event","hey. i'm gonna try to do something here. i know i don't know a whole lot of information but i want to post this up anyway cause i think it is extremely important. i'll try to research it more to find out more details on when. but the draft has been brought up again and its for real. we dont know if it will happen or anything. but it is written out in a bill now and there is a sponser and 14 other cosponsers already for it. it is very possible it could come into effect soon. as soon as May 2005.  we talked about it in mr. kalbs class and like he said, once its a law, we cant do anything about it. or its incredibly hard. now is the time to be mailing our congress. they will listen. our voices can count. mr. kalb also said canada will not be an option. please look into this. even if you believe its right. look into it...research it. the bill's are  H.R.163 and S.89. this is one site i found stuff on...

"event","this last week or so has been full of many things and empty also.  school is pretty cool because i dont have a lot of homework, but i also have felt sick almost every day because i guess my stomach is still not use to the lunch scheldule. everyday i have did something i think. i've gotten to know a few people a little better i think. yesterday evening i was in the zone. everything was just looking good and i felt good and it was crazy. i felt like something happened but i didn't know what it was. it was a good thing i think. i was just thinking a lot i guess. and the difference from when i usually think was the thoughts were making me happy. right now i'm just chill eating some sweet-tarts and twizzlers. hope everyone is doing good."

"event","yesterday afternoon i saw papparazi(sp?). it was okay.  after the first twenty minutes i thought it was actually going to be a movie that had an effect on me, but it ended up just being entertaining.  then it was just 6:30 or so, so my cousin and i snuck into open water. it was okay. actually it was horrible. i missed the first fifteen minutes but i dont think thats why it was so bad. it might be worth two dollars though. i dunno.
im about to go watch the UL UK game with my grandpa. but first...
senior qoutes...any ideas...serious/funny...whatever?"

"event","i'm so relieved right now.  last night through tonight i couldn't update or login. i could post comments...but something was wrong with the computer.  i was at my dads last night and now i'm at my cousins.  as it turns out both computers had this anti-virus thing and it wouldn't let me sign on. but i found a way to shut it off.  now i'm happy.  i even created a livejournal account to see if it was just my livejournal or the computer that was acting up. i normally wouldn't even worry about this. but when i cant post...i want to. and some important stuff was going on but i couldn't view it without being able to sign in.
in other news: we are off school monday.
i hope everyone is good."

"event","today is a nice day. i have an 8-10 page paper still do tomorrow.  I did some of it. its 8 pages spaced 1.5. but i'm just gonna make something up tomorrow in class.  I decided i think thats okay because i'm a senior and the class doesn't really matter a lot. i decided to stop worrying so much and i'm doing okay but i don't know. when i get home sometimes everthing catches up to me and i'm like AHHHHH...but more silently.
today at school was very sad...some people continued to throw a paper ball at me and it was whatever but i started getting really mad at this one kid and it made me feel sad.  its just that i dont want to worry about other people...but this kid is the epitome(sp?) of a jerk.  he gets his laughs and everybody elses from making fun of people and making them feel like their shit.  like they don't have life in them, or feelings.  and i don't know what to do because i want to not have to see this person but the problem is they are all over.  it seems they fill the halls and the ones who inhale life and get the most out of it just might be falling apart together.
sorry.

<lj-cut text=""adventure""> but after these thoughts.  leslie and i had awsome adventures consisting of:
coffee...dollar store....presents...bag of pretzels...79cent Kountry Mist (or something like that fake mountain dew)...talking...ex-girlfriend...driving...music...squirrels...squiggles the kid...poem for friend...climbing playground...stuck on top of swing...library...and thats where i'm at.   i might of left something out but evenings such as these make me smile. <lj-cut>"

"event","hello. i haven't updated for a while and i'm at the library so i figured i'd say hey.  school is mostly crap white days...mostly cool red days...but its okay. there is no difference between junior year and senior year except this time i won't be coming back.  i don't have a lot of homework but its enough to say i don't like it.

some woman just served these two teenagers sitting near me.  they were talking and cussing and she was like 'hey this is a library. you shouldn't say such things. there are little kids.' and then they left.

anyhow.   hopefully everyone is doing good."

"event","hi there. i'm at the library so i figured i'd update. been sick the last two days. still am.  it was okay though cause i got to leave work early. but nothing else was okay except sleeping and ginger ale. yummy. anyhow, next week is church camp but i dont know if i wanna go. its like everynight from six to nine. for some reason that doesn't appeal to me. being that it is the last week of summer. and i don't wanna have to ask off work cause i've been gone for about three weeks.  but i dont want to dissapoint my mom. i dont know.  if things end up working out maybe i'll get to go somewhere for a couple days and that would be something to tell my mom. but it is a beautiful feeling day outside.  leaves are falling already at my house. they're green which is different. <peace>"

"event","You and i cared for eachother
and never stopped
you and i made promises we
had our doubts.
It wasnt perfect,nothing ever is
All i ever wanted
was simple happiness.

So Tell me why we have to give up now
why should we have to take
the final last bow,
I know your not sorry,
but i still love you, i still love you
your all thats right for me.

Its ok dont explain
I've heard enough now,
I wish i could die before your eyes
would it be a suprise?
If im not what you want just say so,
If your not happy,
Then i'll let you go
i'll never forget you,your my life,
and we've been together forever since.

I want you back more than anything,
I care for you that much.
You have no idea how it feels to be alone.
I wish you would just come back to being with me,
So i would know you were mine,
I'd give anything, 
I just want US to happen again, 
so we can be together....
so lets make it again once more."

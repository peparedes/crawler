You say you've all but given up
You're done with it all. You can't take anymore
You swear your life is over, done
But now I'm here to tell you dear

CHORUS
The world won't stop turnin
Fire won't stop burnin
Everything's not gonna end
Birds will keep flying
The sun will keep rising
Leaves still get blown in the wind
Life goes on....

VERSE 2
Every moment life gets harder
You don't know what to do. What will you do?
It seems like everything comes crashing
Down and everyone is against you... Oh yeah..
But listen up...

CHORUS
The world won't stop turnin
Fire won't stop burnin
Everything's not gonna end
Birds will keep flying
The sun will keep rising
Leaves still get blown in the wind
Life goes on....

BRIDGE
People change. Time goes by
Events occur and you'll realize
There's nothing wrong with moving on
Sometimes that's all you can do...

CHORUS
The world won't stop turnin
Fire won't stop burnin
Everything's not gonna end
Birds will keep flying

Leaves still get blown in the wind
Life goes on....

"event","Wrote this today.. had a certain OCP member in mind..

I'm not sure what's going on
What's happening in my head
Situations and circumstances
Are not the same as what was said
You'd say one thing but do another
I'm sick of all your lies
You'd give me filth and force-feed anger
With your pitiful disguise
I gave you all I had to give
And still you took away
Any faith I ever had
That we wouldn't end up this way
Like a cancer you latched on and tore
Away my self-esteem
You warped my vision and stretched the truth
All you were was a bad dream
My crippled perception saw you as my true love
For some reason I thought it was true
Now I look back and I realize that
What's factual is I don't need you
Every day I'm alive I'll live with regret
For the time of my life I gave you
No matter how hard I try, I'll never forget
All of the pain I subdued
I can only hope you'll get on with your life
And seek help for your hurtful ways
Because although you hurt me, I can't help but care
And I will pray that your hatred won't stay
So please bear with me right now as I vent
And go over this whole ordeal
Because now that we're through I'm no longer afraid
To tell you just how I feel"

You are dependent on your friends, but you are not willing to conform into society's stereotypical mold. You may be called a loser, but at least you aren't a nobody.

Here I lay by you. Can you feel me breathing?
There's nothing left to do. Can you feel my heart beating for you?
Emotions overwhelming. Heart is steady pounding. Temptation is kickin in
So what happens now?

CHORUS
Soft, wet kisses. Fulfilling all my wishes.
As our legs intertwine.
Her head is on my shoulder. All I wanna do is hold her.
I wanna make her mine...
All mine...
So what happens now...  What happens now...

Man, is this all real? I can harldy believe it
All the love I give and the love I'm receiving from you..
I wanna set a standard. I wanna make it real.
I wanna make sure you know how deeply I feel
I'm falling even faster with every single breath I take...
So what happens now?

CHORUS
So I went window shoppin. I felt my heart stopping
As I hit my knee.
My heart was out there waiting. It's so intimidating.
Then she said yes to me..
She said yes...
So what happens now... What happens now...

In front of the preacher, we stand
I reach over and take her hand
She's mine for eternity. She saved it all.
She saved her love for me.
Now I can't wait to see....
What happens now.... What happens now..."

"event","Verse 1
We're at that point again. We fuss and then we fight.
We carry on and point the blame for what seems like all night.
You ask me why I love you. You ask me why I care.
If you want me to list reasons. I'll list a few right here.

Chorus 1
I love your hug. I love your kiss.
I love how every time you miss me
You call me up.
I fall in love with you again.
I love your eyes. I love your smile.
And how it never takes a while
For you to miss me. You're my best friend.

Verse 2
We're getting stronger everyday. We're breaking boundaries now.
I'm falling more in love with every second and don't need to know how.
You mean everything to me baby. You're everything I need.
But if you need to hear the reasons that I need you here with me...

Chorus 2
I love your laugh. I love your sigh.
I love it when your hand grabs mine.
I get excited with every single touch.
I love your hair. I love your stare.
And how I know you're always there
For me to hold. Baby, I love you so much.

Chorus 3
I love your calls. I love your voice.
And how you can never make a choice.
I love when you hold me and refuse to let me go.
I love hellos. I hate goodbyes.
You even look cute when you cry.
Here's why I love you. I wanted you to know.
Baby I love everything....

You are the most<br>controversial of all the colors.  You are often<br>easily angered, but as easily as you got<br>excited, you come down.  When angered, do you<br>have the tendency to be malicious?  Afterwards,<br>do you end up begging for forgiveness?  Maybe.<br>But you're incredibly generous, and, odd<br>enough, needy.  You love to hate, and<br>sometimes, you hate to love.  This color<br>describes you as generally edgy.  When in a bad<br>situation, you're pessimistic, and when you're<br>in a good situation, you're extremely<br>optimistic.  You're painfully tempermental, and<br>sometimes it hurts the ones you love.  But with<br>an exciting and stimulating attitude, you enjoy<br>talking to people and being social.  But aside<br>from your bold and outgoing attitude, you're<br>attention-needing and attention-getting.  This<br>color is associated with lust and desire--and<br>you are both lust and desirous.  You're a<br>protective person when it comes to the people<br>you love.  You're incredibly sharp-witted and<br>powerful (not to mention intelligent!).

Verse 1
2 Weeks...Go By
Till I Can See You... Make Me Feel Alive
I Can't Help But Get Excited.
My Heart Is Racing & I Just Can't Hide It.
I'm Only Alive... When You're Around.
And When Your Not, All I Can Do Is Count Down.

Bridge
So It's

Chorus
4 Days, 3Hours, & 20 Minutes
Don't Wanna Dream Unless Ur In It.
So I Press On, & I Continue.
For These Next 4 Days Until I Can See You Again.

Verse 2
2 Days Now... I've Been Waiting..
Continuously Feels Like I'm Fading.
Sinking Deeper, & Deeper Still
Every Day Is Like A Steeper Hill.
Days Go By & I Still Try
Feel Like I'll Be Counting Till The Day I Die.

Bridge
And It's

Chorus
2 Days, 6 Hours, & 14 Minutes
Don't Wanna Dream Unless Ur In It.
So I Press On, & I Continue.
For These Next 2 Days Until I Can See You Again.

Verse 3
I'm On My Way To Where You Are.
I Pull In. You See My Car.
You Run To Me. I Race To You.
There's Nuthin Else I'd Rather Do
I'm Finally Here. I'm With You Now.
So There's No Reason For Me To Count Down...."

"event","You Are (09-13-04)

VERSE 1
Today you'd all but given up. You're walking out the door.
You say you've had enough. You can't take it anymore.
Could you give me one last chance? Let me tell you so you see.
You say that I'm self-centered. Well, here's what you mean to me.

CHORUS
You are my wish.
You are my hope.
You're all I want.
You're all I know.
You're in my thoughts.
You're in my dreams.
You're everywhere.
You're here with me.
Oh, you're my everything.

VERSE 2
So, there I've gone and said it. I've told you how I feel.
So now do you believe me? Or does this not seem real?
If you take me back, I'll do my best. I'll do the best I can.
I wanna show you love, like you deserve. I wanna be your kind of man.

CHORUS
You are my wish.
You are my hope.
You're all I want.
You're all I know.
You're in my thoughts.
You're in my dreams.
You're everywhere.
You're here with me.
Oh, you're my everything.

BRIDGE
I wanna hold you in my arms and never let you go.
I'm gonna look you in your eyes & tell you so you know.
I wanna love you for a lifetime, for an eternity.
I wanna let you know just how much you mean to me...

CHORUS
You are my wish.
You are my hope.
You're all I want.
You're all I know.
You're in my thoughts.
You're in my dreams.
You're everywhere.
You're here with me.
Oh, you're my everything.

FADE
You are my everything... My everything...
You are my everything...
Today you'd all but given up... You're walking out the door...

"event","verse 1
staring deep into her eyes
stomach filled with butterflies
i cant help but feel alive
when shes here with me
holding her so close to me
squeeze so tight its hard to breathe
theres a deeper meaning underneath
than what is seen

chorus
but in her eyes
i can do no wrong
in her eyes
any doubt is gone
i know that i can be the man 
who's gonna take her by the hand
but i dont know if i can be the man
in her eyes...

verse 2
the past it seems so clear to me
its just so hard to believe
how this still feels new to me
having her here
never wanna let her go
so many things i wanna know
there cant be another soul
thats so sincere

chorus
but in her eyes
i can do no wrong
in her eyes
any doubt is gone
i know that i can be the man 
who's gonna take her by the hand
but i dont know if i can be the man
in her eyes...

bridge
in her eyes
everything is clear
no built-up frustration
no more wasted tears
its all happening faster now
falling in love while spinning round..

chorus
but in her eyes
i can do no wrong
in her eyes
any doubt is gone
i know that i can be the man 
who's gonna take her by the hand
but i dont know if i can be the man
in her eyes...
in her eyes...
in her eyes..."

"event","well guys, this saturday nite was.... unexpected..  me and josh were just gonna go see a movie, come back here, and chill out.. thas it.. that was the plan.. no bid deal.. nothing exciting, but hey, everyone knows things never work out as planned.  well, little did we know while partaking in our delectable entrees that we would be stumbled upon by kim, crysal, and lindsey.. how unfortunate for them.. ha..  well, we talked for a little while, the whole time being interrupted by this old lady who wanted a little lovin from the joshmeister.. ha.. ""but who on earth would help me with this massager and body scrub?"" she says while eye-balling and batting her eyes at j-man.. ha..  anyway, we invited them to see our movie over black book, and yes, we won.. movie rocked.... funny as hell.. this was followed by a short trip to the mall.. who woulda thought they closed at 9... (well, other than me..)  and then we had to hit up the wal-mart.. shoppin wont outta the ladies' blood yet..  after an exhillarating game of ""PeniS"", an older fat man out cold in a recliner, and a little kid who had to have add, we called it a nite and headed back to our homes.. must say tho guys, i had a blast..  gonna miss all of y'all when i go to school....  we gotta hang out more b4 i go..

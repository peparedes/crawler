"event","well i was just talking to my mom and i told her that i knew someone who was going to military school and i'd probably never see him again. and she just had to lay the little 2 year thing on me.  in 2 years my friends and i are all going our seperate ways and i really didn't want to be reminded of that because i have great friends and so i was being a freaking baby and started to cry because i didn't want to think about what might or might not happen in the 2 years to come. i'm just trying to live in the present because i've always had a problem of living in the past or dreaming of the future. and i'm sick of it because who's to know what's supposed to happen in the future. i finally have a group of friends who actually understand me.. and i wouldn't give them up for anything. but i really want to go to college. i want to major in art therapy. (oh yea go art) but i love my friends! and they're so important to me. i dunno anymore. i just dont want to have to say goodbye.. TO ANYONE!!!!! and so this is to the person who is going to military school: we may not know each other very well, but i know you well enough to be upset that you're leaving. and i know you'll probably never read this, but do you see that stopping me from writing? uh no. but ... i'll miss you. who am i supposed to have the little ""hello"" contests with. i'll win this one though cuz, i'm not going to say goodbye. i'm not going to put myself through all of that sobbing, i'll miss you crap, cuz i'm not going to say goodbye. THERE IS NO GOOD IN GOODBYE! jesus. later days."

(read between the lines.. i'm talking about a boyfriend) but in actuallity... my friends are so much better than a guy. ahem no offence... ahem. </P>
<P>but i don't know... i think that maybe i just feel stressed or something because of some other <STRONG><FONT color=#cc0000>UN</FONT></STRONG>exciting news i was encountered with during school. something that i don't want to talk about because i don't want to hurt anyone by reveiling something they might not want anyone to know.</P>

"event","<P>Not only am I listening a cd that makes me think too much... (Gravity by Our Lady Peace) but recently, I started to listen to a&nbsp;lot of <EM>Spoken Word</EM> Poetry from OPRFHS. and I listened to a poem that <STRONG>Dan Sullivan</STRONG> wrote and I used one of the lines from his poem to write a poem of my own. and this is the poem:</P>
<P><U><STRONG><FONT color=#000099>Put a Quarter In the Slot</FONT></STRONG></U></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>The words are ringing throughout my mind:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>""Put A Quarter in the Slot.""</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Take a chance.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>But what's left to take a chance on</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>after you feel as though you've lost everything.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>So I stand here</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Wit my quarter</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>hovering over the slot</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>getting ready to take the chance.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Then you remember...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>When you felt so <STRONG>insecure </STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>you looked to a person </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>of the opposite sex</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>hoping maybe they'd bring</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>out all your insecurities.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>But all they did in the end</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>was hurt you even more.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Add more insecurities,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>and lower your <STRONG>self-esteem</STRONG>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>So with your quarter</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>in your hand</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>which hovers beneath the slot,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>you think</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>should you risk getting hurt again</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>or walk away with your head to the floor</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>because you were too much</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>of a <STRONG>coward</STRONG>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Then you remember again,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>when you met someone who you thought mattered to you,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>and who said he loved you.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#000099>you weren't ready for.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>But are you ready </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>to put the quarter</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>in the slot this time...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>But of course,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>you start to think too much yet again.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>About when your <FONT size=4><STRONG>best friend</STRONG></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>told you she admired you </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>for having the guts to take a <FONT size=4><STRONG>risk</STRONG></FONT>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>So as you stand there</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>with your trembling hand </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>over the slot, you think</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>should I let those guys know </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>they got the best of me,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>or should I let my bestfriend know that what she thinks</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>matters to me.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Without another thought</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>you <STRONG>dropped</STRONG> the quarter in the slot</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>and walked away </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>with your head held high.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>And turned only once </FONT></P>

"event","as the title said... i have nothing better to do than sit here and pretend something is going to happen. i have had two bad days (the past two days) starting on monday with julie and josh and claire and nate.  julie was doing the usual and letting people walk all over and talk bad about her, and i finally snapped because that is the one and only thing i can't stand about julie... so i finally snapped at her about it which caused me to snap at everyone else in the room at the time. so i ended up snapping at claire, josh, and nate. but josh and nate deserved it because they were being jackasses... (the truth hurts, trust me) and then julie and i talked about it and imagine this... JULIE... one of the sweetest people i know, JULIE... someone who would give you the shirt of her back, JULIE... who would never hurt a soul... JULIE... told me she is so used to people walking all over her that she doesnt even fucking notice it anymore. how the hell would you feel if someone treated you like.. and not just someone.. but your own friends... wow. anyways, i talked to julie about it and we have a... i guess an understanding. but she will never understand how pissed i get when i see her let people treat her like shit. julie is my bestfriend and i will never let someone treat her like that ever again.. not if i have something to do with it.

then today.. since i was still pissed from last night... i snapped at people... the first person i snapped at was my mom and she threatened to not take me anywhere today because i was supposed to hang out with josh (he's an asshole, but then again he's a guy.. damn ""that was a treat""),claire, and julie...

today i had a sudden realization or lack there of, whatever... i felt like they were leaving me out of their plans, like they have done to other people they don't want to be friends with anymore. i have been up for a long time , just sittnig and reading a book until one of them called me.. when i finally decided to call julie... josh and claire were at her house... funnily enough.. like they always say ""hey corri i was just about to call you"" WHO THE FUCK DO YOU TAKE ME FOR... yea right... they are signalling me out just like they did with cristina.. i guess the three of them are supposed to go on and do better things and just hang out together.. JUST THE THREE OF THEM... 

or maybe i'm just trying to push them away because i'm afraid they know me to well. i'm afraid that they don't like what they see in me so i'm pushing them away so they don't have to put up with my shit... but in actuallity.. i'm hoping that they want to.. i'm hoping that they see a true friend in me.. but who the hell knows anymore?"

<P><FONT style=""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #d4d8f1"">then on saturday, i went to claire's house along with julie and josh and we watched the faculty follies which josh had on tape, and newscene.. (something claire was in) and it was funny.&nbsp; then we all went our separate ways. then at 6:30ish my mom drove me to the river forest community center where i was meeting up with <FONT color=#33ccff size=5>josh</FONT> and<FONT size=5> <FONT color=#cc66cc>julie</FONT></FONT> to attend a best buddies dance.&nbsp; when we first walked in, josh and i felt totally out of place because we didn't know anyone, but julie knew some people.&nbsp; but it turned out to be better than we thought it would be.&nbsp; josh had to do a&nbsp; project for newscene... so i was helping him out with that by taping a lot of things. </FONT></P>

"event","Speechless, heartbroken, confused, the few words in which explain a teenage girl such as myself.  Emotional, pissed, pained.  There's a few more.  I have so many questions to ask, but no one who seems to know the answer.  No one who seems to care what the questions are.  I smile to hide the pain, but maybe I'm just too emotional, but that's a given.  No one sees the tears of a girl who pretends to be happy.  I'm speechless because I don't know what to say, I'm surprised, hurt, pissed. So many adjectives to explain a girl like me, but none of them add up to how I'm feeling right about now.  I don't know what to think.  Maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me.  Maybe I didn't actually see what I thought I saw.  I don't know why someone I'm so close to would have done something like this to me.

Recently I began to think more than usual... about everything; where my choosen path will lead me, the future, the past, the present.  And the most painful of all... change.  Why am I letting something so important to me change who I am? I can't even tell if it's changing me for the better or for the worse.  I'm so afraid of changing to many things and then later regretting it.  I've already had enough regrets to last me a lifetime... but they just keep on coming, appearing as if out of nowhere.  I don't know, I wish I could explain everything I'm feeling in some sort of art.  I want to draw, or paint, or do something that means something to someone.  Do you know that feeling of when you meet a really great friend, and you feel like your whole life is complete; I want to paint that feeling... but I can't. I'm afraid to.  No one understands me right now... I don't even understand myself. But maybe if I were able to express myself on canvas, or paper, more than I have before... maybe someone would actually understand me; or maybe I would understand myself.  But at this point, that just seems impossible to do."

"event","last night was a lot of fun.  i went skating at ridgeland commons which i haven't done since last year when i went with will.  but i was with josh, julie, claire, katie, and this girl ashley who i'm not a big fan of.  anyways, julie, katie and i put in a joint effort to corner josh and push him over. it was like dominos cuz then julie fell herself, and then claire came over to see what was going on cuz all she saw was julie and josh laughing while sitting on the ice. and then josh pushed her down. so yea.

i didn't the stupidest thing thursday night. one of my favorite shows is on thursday and it's julie's too, so when it ended i went to call her and i dialed the first number i could think of, which was will's... not julie's.  and will and i don't talk anymore because after he broke up with me he said he just wanted to be friends and then a week later he said he didn't want to be friends with me anymore and i asked why and he said ""cuz i don't like you and you annoy me"" and that was the last thing i ever heard from him. anyways, about me calling him instead of julie.  he picked up, either that or it was his little brother, but anyways... i said ""hi is julie there"" without even realizing it and he said ""who?"" and then i got another call so i looked down at the caller id and it said macino, j... (julie's last name) and so i put my ear back up to the phone and he hung up so i did too and then i told julie the whole story and we still laugh about it.  it was embarrasing, but it was also funny."

It's been a bad day,
another bad day and all I want to do is look at you and know I'm okay.
From where I'm sitting these shoes ain't fitting and I'm walking backwards,
looking down, don't see the sky I see the ground. 

Above
below you look and so you wonder,
where the time has gone of looking up, tomorrows on its way.
Above
below you look and so you say,
when I wake up in the morning is it 'gonna be another ugly day? 

She sits in church its 2 pm and look whose back from work again.
I guess they thought your better off, without this life, without a job.
From where I'm sitting these shoes ain't fitting and I'm going nowhere,

It's been a bad day,
another bad day and I cross my heart and hope to die
these dreams of yours are 'gonna fly."

"event","today was an interesting day.  this guy nate told julie that he would give her a dollar if she ran head first into a wall and she wouldn't do it, so i did...he never game the dollar. it was fun though, even though it echoed for about 5 seconds after i did it.  nate and steven(nate's bestfriend... steven is in my history class) made fun of me the rest of the day.  hehe...

oh and 7/8, i have spanish and i joke around with this one girl, centeria... (or cereal:-D) and she walked into the class and i said ""shut up, you're not my real mom"" and she said ""damn it, who told you?"" i said ""chad""... she's obsessed with chad micheal murray. it was funny, but i guess you just had to be there when it happened.  everyone thinks i'm crazy now... it was fun though.  the best reaction i got all day from saying that was  from my friend lauren (yes, i have friends)... she gave me the weirdest look.  

well.. i'm off to watch a movie with my parents. you never hear that phrase from teenagers unless you're in my family... for instance, one day in english lit, mr. clean (damn, i mean quinn) asked everyone if they ever went anywhere with their parents, and i was the only one that said i do because i get a long with my parents. i don't distance myself from them like most teenagers... yep. i'll stop babbling now...

and by the way (so i don't get yelled at by kara) ""hey shut up, you're not my real mom"" is from friends... chandler bing (matthew perry) said it.  yeppppp... bye for now."

"event","i don't really have much to say.  huh... i just wanted a journal entry on the first of december. i dunno why.  so i heard chris fell down the stairs last night... for some odd reason, i'm not surprised. 

julie's birthday is on wednesday, but i already had her presents so i gave them to her today... she really like them... she talked about them every time i saw her. lol.

i have a song stuck in my head. it's a really girly song too.  it's mine and julie's song ""What I Like About You"" by lillix.  ""what i like about you, you really know how to dance, when you go up, down, jump around, talk about true romance, yea... keep on whispering in my ear, tell me all the things that i wanna hear, yea, cuz it's true, that's what i like about you!""  sorry... inside joke.  just smile and nod. ok, i'm done...
why'd you even bother taking the time to read this? :-D"

"event","I've come to the conclusion with my attitude. (with the help of Kara and mom): I want people to have the same opinon on things as I do.  For example, I hate anything that is drug related but if I just don't accept people for who thy are, even for the flaws... then I shouldn't deserve to have friends.  Everyone has flaws, and some people have more than others.  But I  need to accept peope for who they are and not what I want them to be.  No one is perfect.
I know I get mad way to easily... sometimes-most of the time.  So my mom and I came up with a word that would make me laugh or smile so I don't have time to be mad.  So, it's working so far, I haven't really gotten mad at anyone.
My mom knows why I get more mad and pissed at Cullum than I do anyone else.  Because he's moving... and I'm trying to get myself to hate him so I'm not so upset when he's gone.  But I shouldn't leave our friendship on a bad note.  My mom told me that the one person that pisses her off more than anyone is my dad and it's because she cares so much about him.  So who knows, maybe that's why I fight with Cullum.  I just need to learn to chill.  I'm just the kinda person that wears her felings on her sleeve and gets pissed when no one bothers to notice. And that's so stupid.  And I know it is, which is why I'm changing some things about myself that I don't like.
yea... that's all.

""I'm good at watching tv.""
""I know that I should just accept the way I look.  I know my appearance isn't as important to me as my thoughts and creatiity and energy and relationships with people: that's what I thrive on.  But none of this knowledge stops me from spending hours in front of the mirror looking for what I've been told are imaginary imperfections.""
""Whoever started all these boogeman stories is a horrible person.""
""Some people believe that it's a good idea to face your fears.  I usually feel that it's healthier to tie them up in a bag, drive out to the country, chuck them out your window, then drive home as fast as you can.""

I just... need to get my mind off of everything, I don't even know what I have to get my mind off of... I just need to.  It's probably all those fights with friends that I had this past month... they're still bothering me and I know they shouldn't be because it's all in the past.  It's just that something else is bothering me and I can feel it in the pit of my soul (i know it sounds cheezy, but shut up)but I don't know what it is.  I'm just so sick of feeling the way I do.  Like I have to be careful what I say around certain people so that no one will think I'm an idiot, or no one will think that I'm stupid or something. 
Maybe I'm just being stupid and pathetic right now, but I don't know but something is just not right.  I bet I'm really confusing everyone right now, but just imagine being in my shoes right now (size 9ish in womens)... I don't know what to feel, I don't know what to think, I don't know what to say, I don't know what to do, I just feel like I have to do something or everything will get fucked up.  Don't ask me what everything is, It's just how I'm feeling right now.  Maybe it's just this whole attitude thing biting me in the ass. (it hurt)  I'm trying to change my attitude because it really needs to be changed... I mean seriously, I fought with Cullum a lot this past month, and it was all those stupid things that Julie does too but it doesn't piss me off when she does it... yep, Cullum, you were right... you know what I'm talking about. (you might not though) but... I don't know, so I'm working on changing my attitude.  The reasons why are:
*The Cullum fights are stupid and pathetic
*Everytime Bobby comes here, he thinks I'm pissed at something
*I'm sick of losing friends
*I need to...
Yea... I think this is the reason why I paint and draw... I have no clue how I feel, but when I put it all out onto paper not using words, I feel how the piece of artwork shows.  I may not be much of an artist, but I like to think I am.  I think that I try to hard to make everyone like me as me... so I hide the real me occasionaly just so that the real me won't show.  I(OCCASIONALY) think that if I don't hide the real me, then more people will run from me or try to distance themself from me.  And I'm tired of trying to hide the real me."

It took me 2 days  to work on the painting I mentioned earlier... and everytime I have someone look at it.. they don't even glance at it and say good job... hello? WHAT THE HELL? 

It's people like you that make me wish I never even got into art."

"event","i started painting a picture yesterday and i finished it today.  i'm proud of myself for how it turned out.  it didn't exactly end up the way i wanted, but it still looks ok.  it's the difference between good and evil.  everyone says good job corri, but i know the only person that would really appreciate my art work is my uncle paul.  he's the reason why i started drawing and painting in the first place.  he's such a great artist.  he does mostly still life scenery scenes and he always has little guy in it.  i personally think that's his trademark.  when i paint, i always paint an eye.  i love eyes. when i draw.. i only draw portraits.  i don't know why.  i'm not all that great at anything else besides that.  i have a thing for eyes.

yea.. so i just fell like saying that i painted something because i'm proud of myself.  i'm not all that great at expressing myself in writing like kara so i express myself in art.  i don't know..."

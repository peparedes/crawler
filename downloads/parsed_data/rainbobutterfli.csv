"event","Today I was a first time visitor at Broadway UMC and I must say that I was very blessed by my experience there. I have visited a few churches over the past couple of months because I am looking for a new church home. While I enjoyed certain parts of the service at the other churches I visited, I didn't really feel as if they could be home to me. I have never been too particular about denominations or worship styles. I was blessed to be exposed to different religious experiences ranging from very traditional to very charismatic growing up. What I found is that first and foremost God lives in me not in church buildings; and when I go to church I am not looking for God there, but looking to connect with the God in me through the corporate discipline of prayer, reading of the scriptures, singing, socializing with others, giving and so forth. I am looking for a place that preaches the gospel or ""good news"" in a hopeful manner; and a place that is diverse in race, age, culture and yes, even sexual orientation because the people of God are diverse. After worshiping with Broadway UMC, I am hopeful that such a place may exist after all. We'll see."

"event","Happy Birthday to ME! Cha Cha Cha :) Actually, my birthday was 2 weeks ago,and I am still singing in spite of the bitter sweet taste this birthday has left in my mouth. I turned 28 years old this year.I've had many accomplishments to my name, four beautiful children (my mini me's), a college education and an interesting career despite early motherhood, an 11 year picture perfect marriage, nice home in a middle class neighborhood complete with a soccer mom mini van and more. Some would say I was living the American Dream, but I was not living MY dream. Who I am was drowning in who everyone else wanted me to be. I wore a multitude of masks to please my audience and after a while I forgot who I was underneath them. I lived most of my life on stage, pretending to feel, pretending to love, pretending to live. 

CUT!!!!!!

This birthday marks the year I began removing the masks and exiting the stage. An event that is being angrily protested by those who were so comfortable with my performance. My life as I knew it has been torn down, and I am left with very few fans who love me for me and not the roles I played. The next few years, I know, will be a journey to re-discover the ME I was intended to be. I am both scared and excited about this journey, after all, it is the unknown and unfamiliar. My affirmation is this...

I will not die an un-lived life. 
I will not live in fear of falling or catching fire. 
I choose to inhabit my days, to allow my living to open me, 
to make me less afraid, more accessible, 
to loosen my heart until it becomes a wing, a torch, a promise. 
I choose to risk my significance; 
to live so that which comes to me as seed goes to the next as blossom 
and that which comes to me as blossom, goes on as fruit. 

So be it!"

"event","I'm Feeling stuck like my feet are incased in blocks of cement so heavy that the tiniest movement requires an extraordinary amount of streghnth. I, more than anyone I know, am a dreamer and I wonder on a daily basis if this is a gift or a curse. The artist in me wants so much to believe that I can create the life that I want. This belief makes life worth living for me... I need to feel like I have some authority of my own life's story and that I am not merely a puppet in some cosmic play. But the realist in me is catching up with the artist. She knows that this life doesnt always give us good materials to create with. She is teaching the artist to work with what IS to create what she wants to be.If I even know what I want... to be????????"

"event","Lately I have been evaluating and re-evaluating the various relationships in my life and the universal purpose for me being in these relationships. At this point in my life, I am not interested in frivolous friendships. I desire relationships with people of substance and character, people that will challenge me to be the ultimate me, and love me while I am in the process of becoming me. This, I know takes a large amount of honesty and transparency my part, which has always been scary for me. I am not one for laying all my cards on the table face up for all to see. Something as simple as asking me what I am thinking can make me feel like someone walked in on me I am on the toilet. But I am slowly but surely broadening my emotional bounderies and the love I have found in the process has been medicine to my heart. It gives me energy for living, as love should. 

Now, nothing urks my blood more than people who play silly relationship games. This is probably reflective of my own personality since I once was a master at this, and I hate competition. I would say I wanted one thing when I really wanted another. I would withhold affection or intimacy until I get what I want. I would say things I don't mean to get an emotional response. I would play the guessing game...guess what I am thinking, guess what I am feeling, what do you think I want?... I would play the self loathing game... you don't love me anymore... I just can't do anything right...But I am too old for these kinds of games now and I do not wish to play them with others. They serve no good purpose in the end, and 9 times out of 10 nobody in going to get what they want or need anyway."

"event","I HATE CONFORMITY! I despise it! I don't wanna be like mike, I wanna be like TEE. It is my God given right to live life according to my own unique pattern. Not only do I find conformity boring, but it's downright unnatural. Life is meant to diverse. But it seems like everyone around me has this sick need to live MY life for me. Or should I say they have this sick need to live my life for THEMSELVES. I have had an overwhelming portion of not so friendly advice from people who are absolutely sure that they know what is ""RIGHT"". Not only do they know what is right, but they are absolutely sure that their definition of right, is right for everybody. Does anybody think for themselves anymore?"

"event","All my life I have had this feeling of disconnectedness and not quite belonging anywhere and for the longest time I could not figuire out why. My biggest struggle with life,is the struggle to keep myself whole in a world that insists that I differentiate. By differentiate, I mean cut myself up into seperate and distinct parts so that I can fit neatly into this society's way of catogorizing people and things. People always want to know, ""What are you EXACTLY?"". They try to define you by race or nationality, sexual orientation or preference, religion, political affiliation etc. Are you Black or White? Gay or Straight? Christian or Buddhist? Democrat or Republican? Identify yourself! 

But I have come to accept the fact that I am a Chimera. There are different definitions for ""chimera"", The writer in me see's the fire breathing she-creature in greek mythology that had a lion's head, a goat's body, and a serpent's tail. The scientist in me see's the individual or organism that is made up of 2 or more completely different sets of genetic constitution, (in other words, normal individuals and organisms have one set of DNA, but a chimera has more than one set). The artist in me also identifies with the defintions ""an illusion or fabrication of the mind, and unrealisable dream, the creation of the imagination."" 

I am a tri-racial (black, white and native american)and I love my blend of cultures, but there are times when I have been shut out of the black community for being ""whitewashed"" and not conforming to their rigid definition of being black. For lack of a better word, I self identify as bisexual. Loving and being loved by both men and women feeds different parts of my soul, and yet exclusively gay and straight people would rather see a part of my soul starve than to see me ""consorting with their enemy"". I am neither Democrat or Republican, I vote with what makes sense. I am not religious, but I am a Christian. However, I have a deep respect for the asian wisdom traditions, like Buddhism and Yoga, as well as the spiritual nature of Native Americans. However, there are many too indoctrinated to see the Spirit of God, somewhere, in all things. They are quick to call you a heritic for even acknowledging the good in anothers beliefs. Not to mention the fact that I am gay and going to hell.   

What do you do when you are amphibious by nature, but forced to choose between worlds? I can no more choose to be exclusively straight or gay than I can cut my veins open and seperate my great grandfathers native american and black blood from my great grandmothers white blood. And why should I?! By fully embracing my amphibious nature I am free in many ways to live many lives at once because I can adapt and survive in ways that can not. This is a gift, my gift and I refuse to forfeit it. 

But that's just me...."

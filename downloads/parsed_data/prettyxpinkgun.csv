<font size=1>I'll be seeing you
In all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces
All day through.

In that small cafe;
The park across the way;
The children's carousel;
The chestnut trees;
The wishin' well.

I'll be seeing you
In every lovely summer's day;
In every thing that's light and gay.
I'll always think of you that way.

I'll find you
In the morning sun
And when the night is new.
I'll be looking at the moon,
But I'll be seeing you.

 Drown yourself in soy milk.
 Slice your wrists with a 7-inch.
 Accidentally ingest black hair dye or parts of a Sharpie that was used to ""X"" your hands.
 Crash your car into a tree while trying to read the band stickers on the car in front of you.
 Die from dehydration from tear loss.
 Get your bangs caught in a record player.
 Get attacked by an emu.
 Actually wear your heart on your sleeves.
 Suffocate from too many layers of v-neck sweaters."

"event","Tulips Are Better 
Crystal clear I see the rose is frail,
the thorns hid easily in its beauty, as I go to grasp it in my hand 
My heart is torn beating from my chest 
Let me be captivated, by your beauty 
Then let me fall from your grace, unto my broken knees 
Close my eyes so tightly, the tears are welling up 
You aren't worth the waste, of the salt or the water 
Fuck all your false beauty, it was transparent just like your smile - liar 
Your thorns caress my flesh, crimson drops on a snowy field - liar 
I have watched you retrogress, I have seen what you've become - liar 
Please take your eyes off of me,
it's funny how fast blue eyes fade gray - liar 
And you are deceit 
Watching the sun play in your hair 
I couldn't really care, care any less about you 
Just wither away real beauty is forever in you 
Just wither away 


         xoxo

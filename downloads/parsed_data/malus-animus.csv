"event","What is someone supposed to do with a bunch of unconscious, augmented showgirls?

I'm unsure I grasp the concept of a showgirl, anyway.  She's not dressed enough to be considered decent, but it's not like she'll be taking off anymore and allowing the audience to give her a ride (even if only in their minds).  I should change this.

I should, because the concept of showgirls in this fashion annoys me greatly.  Must I remind you all that they smell?  Maybe not to you all, as your senses are feeble and weak in comparison to my own...  but they <i>do</i>.  All that... showing.  Sweat is not a pleasant bodily function, I don't care why it's happening.  Thankfully, yet another gift from Sparda: it takes quite a bit to provoke such a disgusting function from my brother or myself.

But yes, showgirls smell.  Perfume they may wear, but it only enhances the stink.  Sweat + perfume?  No, no, no, and no.

I should just put in a strip club and fire the showgirls.

And breast implants are absolutely hideous.  I have half the mind to pop them all, but I don't want someone walking in and thinking I'm sexually assaulting the completely unconscious showgirl troupe.  Besides, I have that blowdart gun for something.

Smelly showgirls...  And Joumingo.  That man is a walking sweatgland.  And yet, and I quote from the ""prima donaesque"" showgirl, he ""screams 'sexual entity'"".  He's <i>slimy</i>, but he's an amusing magician and good publicity.

Honestly, and I used to say Dante was filthy."

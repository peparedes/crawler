"event","<br>it's been quite a while since the last time i've felt emptied enough to be filled up this way. i feel so much gratitude for god's presence being very real to me today.&nbsp; for the first time in a long time, my prayer tonight was not a ""help me, help me, help me"" but a ""thank you, thank you, thank you"".&nbsp; it's just too unfortunate that i had to lose someone to get here.&nbsp; how i wish i got here first before i met him, because he's such a great person to lose. love does not end, it simply reshapes itself but it cannot be done if it is a square peg lodged - no, fastened - into a round hole.&nbsp; it has to free itself first...in the hope that when it is done being reshaped, that it would fit into the old round hole, if the round hole has not reshaped itself.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br><!-- multiply:no_crosspost --><p class='multiply:no_crosspost'></p>"

"event","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">I Am Sam.&nbsp;</span> During the last week of the term, I showed my Primary 6 class the movie, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0277027/"">""I Am Sam""</a>.&nbsp; I was a bit apprehensive at first because I was afraid that they might not enjoy the movie and get bored.&nbsp; For those who have not seen <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0277027/"">""I Am Sam""</a>, it is a story of a mentally retarded man who fought for the custody of his 7-year-old daughter, who, in the process, was able to teach his workaholic, hard-hearted lawyer about life and love.&nbsp; As I was observing them, they seemed interested enough, although I wasn't sure if it was authentic interest in the story or simply an authentic joy of not having to sit through one of my lectures.&nbsp; As there were several interruptions, with people knocking and giving announcements, I was afraid the time was not enough for us to finish the movie and allow them ample time to complete their reflection.&nbsp; With a quarter of the movie still left, I said, ""I'll forward it a bit ah because it's almost the end of the period.""&nbsp; To my surprise and delight, they had violent reactions.&nbsp; One student kept on laughing in one part but I knew she was just concealing the fact that she was crying.&nbsp; Another student asked me where I got the dvd because she wants to get her own copy.&nbsp; This is the same class I had struggled with for half a year.&nbsp; During the first term, if I squint hard enough, I'd see that they're kind-hearted, sure, but this is the kind of class that was happy-go-lucky, rowdy and unruly.&nbsp; They were quite uncomfortable with expressing empathy.&nbsp; Now, I'm proud to find very meaningful reflections of the movie, ""I Am Sam"". <br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Choki-choki.&nbsp;</span> Students in our school come from rich families.&nbsp; At least twice every month, there would be students celebrating their birthdays by treating all the classmates and all the teachers, whether you are teaching the child or not, to packed lunch or a scrumptious cake.&nbsp; One of my students whose parents are always out of town, came to my table during my lunch break and gave me six sticks of choki-choki.&nbsp; It's melted chocolate that you push out of an elongated plastic container and you sip it through the other side.&nbsp; It's like those Kraft cheese sticks, only it's not cheese but chocolate.&nbsp; :P&nbsp; Later, I found out that he saved the money for this occasion.&nbsp; He treated his classmates to drinks - coke and fruit tea.&nbsp; Wondering why I got choki-choki instead, his classmates later told me that he asked them what I liked and that was what they told him.&nbsp; That was one of the best birthday treats I received. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><br>marami pa pero malamok sa kuwarto na ito.&nbsp; babay muna.&nbsp; tidur dulu.&nbsp; <br>   <!-- multiply:no_crosspost --><p class='multiply:no_crosspost'></p>"

"event","(Enter Kate Monster &amp; Princeton.)<br>Both:<br>Everyone's a little bit racist<br> Sometimes.<br> Doesn't mean we go <br> Around committing hate crimes.<br> Look around and you will find<br> No one's really color blind.<br> Maybe it's a fact<br> We all should face<br> Everyone makes judgments<br> Based on race.<br> <br><br>Ever since I moved to Jakarta to work at an international school, I had declared myself as a citizen of the world, not so much in terms of residence but in terms of loyalty.&nbsp; Of course, I will always be Filipino - sa isip, sa salita, at sa gawa (in mind, word, and deed / thoughts, words, and actions) - but I also chose to tread the new path with a heart that goes out to people and not just to Filipinos.&nbsp; Everyone deserves the same compassion, the same love.&nbsp; That, I believe, was how I learned to love my students and colleagues and the work that I do, by being open to what opportunities the experiences will bring me.&nbsp; I had been careful to not be too ethnocentric.&nbsp; To not fall into the trap of thinking that Filipinos do it best.&nbsp; That the Filipino way is the only way.&nbsp; There were times when I felt I was missing the familiar work environment, but it was not the Filipino work environment, perse, I was missing.&nbsp; <br><br>A friend of mine once told me, ""You cannot expect people to work in the same way that you do, Jowi. As long as the goals are the same, people must be able to work in the way they know best""&nbsp; I agreed then and I agree now.&nbsp; In fact, a leader should be able to manage his or her people and allow them to do their best in the things they do best.&nbsp; S/he must not insist on his own way of doing things.&nbsp; In such case, therefore, the important thing is that the objectives are clearly disseminated and the people are inspired to reach the goals together.&nbsp; ""Hows"" are more palatable when the ""whys"" are explicit and comprehensible.&nbsp; Yes, the ways of doing things can and will be different.&nbsp; But I believe that it is reasonable to expect that something is being done. That people are doing different things towards the same goal, yes. But people must be doing something.&nbsp; Way back in grade school, I remember my groupmates ousting one of my classmates for being a freeloader.&nbsp; Freeloading is just not good practice.<br><br>Special events allow for a showcase of special talents - art, physical abilities, kinetic abilities, music, beauty, etc.&nbsp; A friend told me that the event allowed her to see the differences in culture - that some were more into it than others.&nbsp; That it was not possible for them to have the same intensity.&nbsp; In my mind, I asked if it is really a difference in racial culture or just a difference in personality.&nbsp; Because I believe the drive for excellence is universal.&nbsp; It is either you strive for excellence or you don't.&nbsp; It has nothing to do with whether you are Filipino or American or Indonesian or Australian.&nbsp; True, some cultures are more loud, more ""out there"" and therefore appear more driven and more passionate.&nbsp; But to me, you take your passion and make it happen.&nbsp; It doesn't have to be ostentatious.&nbsp; You can be passionate yet quiet at the same time but quietude due to apathy and unwillingness to do the job is a different thing altogether.&nbsp; <br><br>Of course, I don't think she was being racist against us whom she thought were very ""in to it"".&nbsp; I didn't think of it that way.&nbsp; It was even a compliment, I believe.&nbsp; But isn't that a little racist against her own race, thinking that they, as a race, are not capable of the same passion and drive for excellence? <br><br><br><br>But then again... I am reminded by Kate Monster and Princeton...that...<br><br>Ethinic jokes might be uncouth,<br> But you laugh because<br> They're based on truth.<br> Don't take them as <br> Personal attacks.<br> Everyone enjoys them - <br> So relax!&nbsp;   <!-- multiply:no_crosspost --><p class=""multiply:no_crosspost""></p>"

"event","<div><span class=""insertedphoto""></span>one of the things i did in the plane tonight was to make a bunch of lists of blessings i received in 2009 - people, opportunities for creative expression, specific gifts, including the lemons and curve balls life threw me, even things purchased (!), things i have decided to leave behind, goals for this year, and a few others.<br> <br> one thing i like about working (and probably studying too) away from home is you are able to get a whole new perspective of things. there's a sort of detachment that allows you to appreciate things in a new light and have deeper appreciation for those that are essential to you. and that goes both ways. a vacation spent at home (in my case, manila) allows the chance to look back at your ""life"" in the country where you work. you have a break, indeed! 'break' as in taking a breather and 'break' as in opportunity. and being away from home gives you the chance to prioritize and manage your energies because you realize what things are truly important to you. there are things that you just don't have to carry all the time. <br> <br> lemons and curve balls.  to quote a line from one of my favorite tv shows, ""you fought, you loved, you lost...stand tall...""  <br> <br> things purchased.  i think that's self explanatory! hahaha.  when all else fails, retail therapy! hahaha!  <br> <br> <br>  </div><div class=""photo photo_right""><div class=""photo_img""><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=30457542&amp;op=1&amp;view=all&amp;subj=237129602075&amp;aid=-1&amp;auser=0&amp;oid=237129602075&amp;id=1224318086""><br></a></div></div><span class=""insertedphoto""><a href=""http://littletimoune.multiply.com/photos/hi-res/1M/6682""><img class=""alignright"" src=""http://images.littletimoune.multiply.com/image/zNB+Y1kFSrJvswRbfLr6IQ/photos/1M/300x300/6682/TIMESSQUARE61c41.jpg?et=mM0fdvqejA9n0nxyWc98%2Bw&amp;nmid=0"" border=""0""></a></span>i realized that while 2008 was a year when i picked myself up after a fall, 2009 was a transition year, a year to redefine myself and find my niche in the world. i'm still not quite there yet (epic fail! hahaha) i do (and have for quite some time now) know what my truest deepest desires are and i'm still on my way there. but god has been faithful. he provided countless opportunities which i either grabbed - out of instinct, habit, love, or fear - or allowed to pass me by - out of instinct, habit, love, or fear. <br> <br> i pray that if we keep our eye on the goal, with god's grace and much love, we will all achieve what we want to achieve this year. <br> <br> i am blessed. it was a blessing even to be able to fill up those lists. bring it on, 2010! :)   <!-- multiply:no_crosspost --><p class='multiply:no_crosspost'></p>"

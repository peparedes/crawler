Even though mike ness is 42 years of age, he still can right a song with the anger, and ferocity of a teenager..yet tell an intelligent story with the lyrics like Bruce Springsteen or bob dylan, or johnny cash. ,,,counting the days......
p.s. pylons play the dicksucktacons tonite..."

"event","im sitting here ...surfing through all the sites of bands i listen to, and given the fact im old, alot of the bands i like are old, so im all depressed, theres of course samiam...who isnt officially broken up...but they haven't toured the U.S. in over three years,,in fact they've only played a handful of shows in europe over the last three years, then there is face to face, which happens to be one of my favorite bands of all time, and yes i am one of those 'JOHNNY MORE PUNK THAN YOU""guys about this band, seeing as i have seen this band over 15 times...i actually first saw them in 93 at a fucking pizzeria in santa ana , california and have seen them every time theyve been to detroit EXCEPT when they opened for no doubt a few years ago (for obvious reasons) anyway , they recently broke up...i basically feel like ive grown up with this band ...and now its like I lost a best friend. anyway, my point is all my favorite bands are breaking up, or never touring, and just plain getting old.  Which brings me to my next thought..sparta is soon playing the fucking shelter!!!! this makes my depression go away... i will no longer feel starved for good live music..all i need now is the dropkick murphy's, bad religion, the mars volta, samiam, and rancid to come through here, but NOT on the corprate ass raping warped tour..and I will just be very WET!"

Julie's at work and im bored, the sens and flames are playing a matinee but watching ANYONE play the flames is like having gas at the dentist.  The pylons are having a wonderous season, we are on a 3 game winning streak, complete with a shutout last game, we have a late game on monday which kinda sucks because itll probably be even later just because that rink is NEVER on time.  im really in the mood for some beers tonight but who knows , the new apartment is sweet, just gotta finish unpacking."

"event","so, im still waiting for this guy to call me from ""the other"" glass company i really hope to hear from him soon, im stoked because im finally getting my check from unemployment for the three weeks i was off in november (yes november). julie is probably pretty happy about that too, id really like for things to get quared away soon to relieve some of her stress, although it seems she has mellowed out at least a little bit. damn i love that girl more thn anything, and i want nothing more than for her to be happy, and healthy.

well we got our asses kicked on monday, mind you it was at the hands of probably  one of the top teams in the league, but a mini-mite team would have beat our ass the way we played. jim brought over a tape of the game and it was a fucking joke, EVERY time we gained possesion of the puck, we dumped it down the surface, or coughed it up in our own end, which resulted in a goal almost every time.  Im so sick of everyones passes looking like ally-oop passes, THE PUCK ISNT SUPPOSED TO MAKE AN ARC WHEN PASSED EVERY TIME, we need to learn to make crisp saucer passes, actually we just need to make passes. period.  we arent playing smart hockey, absolutely no one tries to get to open ice, they just play positional, which will not work in 4 on 4 roller hockey, im also sick of peopl who have less skills than others bitching about how much they're playing. i LITERALLY had to tell our LEAST skilled player to get the fuck off the ice (surface) hes playing more minutes than our higher skilled players because he refuses to change up.  and he says things like ""im not tired yet""
well , if he could fuckin skate better, he WOULD be tired. christ , im just getting myself worked up.

im sitting here watching my new favorite channel..vh1 classic..they play mostly 80's 
new wave, rock, and metal. what else could a child of the 80's ask for!?!? anyway, julie woke up feeling like shit today, i feel bad for her and i wish there was something i could do to help her. I love her more than life itself and it kills me to see her like this, and i've never been good with tact so i dont always say the right things to make her feel better, in fact sometimes i say the absolute wrong thing, but thats because im not good at expressing myself.  I have today off, and im finally working at a place i dont loathe, but i also have an offer for a job thats alot closer, and its for a more ""family"" like business, and if i take this job, i can see myself working there for a long time, which i Dont see that with my current job.  I also heard that bad religion (one of my favortie bands of all time) is re-releasing their first 4 albums  in april , which excites me, because due to a night of inebriation about two years ago, approx. 250 cd's were ""misplaced"" which included my entire bad religion collection , some cd's of which were rare live bootlegs, im pretty sure ill NEVER get those back.

All of the people that I once considered friends are in their mid-20's and NOT in school yet still live the life of a college freshman. some have this deranged notion that traveling all over the world while mommy pays the bill, while not informing her husband of the costs, is the route to adulthood, meanwhile the person in question couldn't even get approved for a cell phone because his credit is so fucked. thats really adult.  and on to another friend who other than sleeping in his own bed spends his life in a bar, whether working in one, or drinking in one, or eating in one, thats where you will find him, can you say mickey mantle?  he calls me only to report that hes acquired the latest edition of an EA sports game, or once in a GREAT while he'll call to invite me out to...you guessed it, the bar, mind you its only late at night during the week when this phenomenon occurs,precisely when I need to be in bed due to the fact that I have a real job. at least i  have my jules...she is the BEST friend one could have...best friend with benefit wink wink...anyway just neede to vent about lame ass people.

Well here it goes..had a great weekend, went to the jim rome tour stop at the palace and it fucking ruled..beer ...darren mccarty, hot dogs, sean baligian, jules, and other fantastic things..a good time was had by all...BUT with a small, minute, annoying, dickless exception..julie and i have discovered we have some stalkers whilst at the tour stop, my friend and I went for a small stroll while brandon and julie remained at the vehicle (this was during the tailgating) well, during my stroll some ugly girl was staring at julie, so just like my good little jules, she gave the ""ugly girl"" the universal sign for ""you're number one"".Come to find out this was her ex-boyfriend (i use the term boy loosely) and his ugly new girlfriend (quite a working pair, i might add, ugly girl..uglier boy) anyway the day went on , i drank more, and by the end of the day i almost killed this ugly boys brother. Fast forward to monday, julie gets a call..mind you at her mothers house where she hasn't lived since october..and its from ugly boys sister..who julie is/was friends with (whatever)..so the sister of ugly boy begins asking julie about how she is whats up..and all that other mindless cliche phone conversation chatter ..did I mention that julie hasn't talked to these people (meaning ugly boys family) in many months she has basically offered all signs to ugly boys brother and sister showing that she has moved on, yet these people continue to try to talk to her and act like evrythings cool and basically making julie relive a past with an abusive, self important , self righteous, cult member (yes ALL religions are cultish, but mormanism is a self serving, holier than thou, sexist group of zealots)...so through the conversation julie learns that ugly boy and ugly girl know where we live, keep in mind we live in an apartment where our parking is all but completely concealed from other streets and thoroughfares, its not like someone can just be ""rolling down the street and just so happen to notice our car parked there""  this is a case of stalking.. and i don't understand why they (ugly couple) or their family is so concerned with julie or myself or what she's doing. So...ive already wasted enough of my time talking about human waste..so let me put it into perspective for these people..go on with your meaningless lemming-like lives, DO NOT concern yourself with julie, myself or what we are doing. Don't expect to see julie at ugly boys sisters wedding, and its LAUGHABLE that you even tendered an invite to the shower or the wedding.  and..don't be expecting an invite julies shower or our wedding..so i leave you with this final thought..IF i find that you continue to stalk us...it will not be pretty for you ...you can consider that a threat AND a promise."

Sergei has had a great career here in detroit and has been one of the biggest contributors on this team during the cup years, but how many times has his heart and effort been in question...more than a few, also i think sergei wants to live a ""hollywood"" type lifestyle that he just can't get here, he needs to go play in california, or maybe florida.  I think tampa would be a great fit for his style of play.  Anyway i see the wings have made an offer to derian hatcher  which is ok...id rather see them go after paul kariya but my name is john , not ken holland.  I know that there are some wing-slappys out there who will be all bitter and bitch about fedorov leaving and blame it on the management or mike ilitch (which is bullshit because the organization has been nothing but top notch to sergei), it's the same people who were pissed to see sean friggen avery go (waving bye-bye)...anyway happy birthday to my lovely fiance....!!!!"

Ive fucking had it with these uneducated assholes with their stupid ""no war"" protests and their anti-bush propaganda.  First off, pick up a fucking newspaper, watch the news, or listen to the radio, and FIND OUT WHY WE AR IN IRAQ!!!!!! This is NOT a fight to bring oil to the US, if we needed oil that bad, Alaska would look like a renegade roto-tiller would have ran the daytona 500 throughout the entire state. The purpose of this war is to end the power of a  sick regime led by a maniacal tyrant and his two sons. A man who gasses his own people, uses children as pawns in order to get people to think his way, or follow his word, who has COMPLETE control over ALL media outlets in Iraq, and worst of all is a threat to the U.S., Iran, Turkey< Israel, and any other non-muslim country in the middle east. The very citizens of Iraq have been anonymously stating that they have been waiting a long time for us to enter iraq and get that asshole out of there, because they themselves hate the cloud of oppression that they live beneath.  This man is a diabolical, maniacal, calculating dictator, and if we did not take care of this now, we would definitely  regret it later. so, all of you hemp wearing, patchouli smelling, granola eating, birkenstock sporting uneducated hippies, UNDERSTAND what is happening before spitting your empty dogma , or lining the streets with your stupid protests,oh btw at the very least, this war no matter what is happening, so AT LEAST show some support for the brave men and women who are over there fighting for you to express you lame ass , empty opinion, those people have more courage in the dump they took after eating their field MRE's, then you will ever, or have ever had."

I figured that a stay at the rio (new orleans themed hotel, kinda fitting for a halloween wedding) or hard rock hotel for obvious reasons would be fantastic."

"event","well...i figured i'd  give a live journal a try..im not a fast typer or an efficient one for that matter so what would take jules 2 minutes to enter..will no doubt take me an hour, or more.  Anyway, im an extremely happy person today, even after a goddamned fiasco with that fucking monopoly michcon, but im extremely happy because im totally sure ive found my soulmate, it took a traumatic event to discover this, but im 100% sure that jules is THE one..(you know what im saying) im not quite sure however what to enter in this thing, occasionally i will spill my guts about persnal things, but mostly this will be a forum to vent my distaste for particular people who walk this planet, wasting the oxygen, acting as a carbon based anchor on society. and no.. i will not be gentle or withhold names, so anyone with a problem.. make like barry bonds and step up to the plate.

So here goes my first rant....although  I cant bring it like my man Dennis Miller,
there will be witty banter sprinkled throughout my journal.
Sinazucar, where oh where do I start...
listen here freaky bald guy...paint your face, and lay off trying to enter the realm in which you have no knowledge of, or business fooling with.
enter the army..go to iraq..and be collateral damage..you will be sorely missed ""im sure.""
anyway..im done for now..but my list is long and time is limited."

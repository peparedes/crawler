lol
we went and picked curt up to go to lip sync, i immediately knew it was going to be a good day.
it was basically our first 'PUBLIC APPERANCE' lol.
the lip sync was kindof really dumb though, zane & logan won.

then we went to friendly's [i just cut out like 84730293847029834 parts but thats okay]
and alex stepped in puke
and i had ice cream
and abby & i stole spoons
and it was pretty fun

then i dropped curt off ;D
but its upsetting to leave him
i'm going to get myself crying
BUT IM GOING TO SEE HIM TOMORROW

i hope my whole report card isnt like that, i wanted to make high honor roll all 4 marking periods this year.

lol lip sync tonight? its going to be crazy because i'm bringing curt for slapsick entertainment and all my douchebag friends are going to be up in his face. lol if i were him i wouldnt want to go. i'll protect him.

my mom and i have been fighting over crazy stupid garbage lately. i think its mostly because she's stressed and just generally angry, but at this point i'm not so sure.

OMG competitions in two weeks and we arent even done with when doves cry yet oh my goddd D;

i'll keep posting
i'll post after lip sync tonight."

i recently realised that its hard for me to keep a friendship with people if they are fat & a girl. witch is strange because i'm not superskinny myself.
& it also seems i can be quite an asshole if you are a guy that i think is very ugly.
so if your a guy & i'm vaugely nice to you, then i probabally would consider being good friends with you. if not more blehh.

tomorrows trick-or-treating. i still have to dig out my ballet costume from last year. then i get to wearit to school on tuesday for halloween. EWW the parades on tuesday.i honestly dont want to march in that parade. what if it rains? ill have to hang my uniform out again. and my gloves will get even dirtier. :(  is freshman too old to go trick or treating?

one of the dance competitions interferes with the band competition. i hope that we dont go to that one because i'm not missing the band trip.

i still need to finish that stupid short story. i hate mr. leibe for doing that.

here, have a comic. jenn=life.

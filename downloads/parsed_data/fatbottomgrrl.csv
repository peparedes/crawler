One of my C2L buddies posted this the other day. I was completely surprised to see that several of them pertain to me. The next time I'm in to see the doc I'm going to talk to her and I'm going to pick up the book at the library this week. Andrea you may want to take a look at it to"

"event","I was just talking to Mandie and I realized how much less I workout then I did when I first joined WW. I used to get up in the morning do 30 mins on my tredmill and 30 mins on my stationary bike get ready for the day do my 15 min 6 sec abs DVD during the morning nap and then a 3mile WATP DVD which was another 45 mins. 

Now I'm lucky to get 30 mins. This has to change if I plan to get to my goal of 130lbs. SO here goes

My promise to Mandie and all my friends and family: I promise you I will do no less then 1 hr of a workout each day giving myself a rest day on Saturday or sunday."

"event","We bought Jerimie a bike tonight so we could ride as a family we have a little stroller cart thingy for Vinnie and Emma. Emma can't get the peddles figured out yet. Margaret did pretty good for her first big ride we went about 5 blocks and back she biffed in once not to bad though nothing broken no blood so we're good. I think we'll start riding every night after dinner before swim lessons. I found my roller blades yesterday I'm just not sure if I want to try them right now. I have to work up the nerve or be drunk when I use them. 

I'm hoping my legs aren't to sore in the morning it's the first morning I'll get to workout. This 5:30 family is really screwing up my workout time. I'm just having to work it in when I can."

i went over to McDonalds to get one of their adult happy meals only for the workout DVD but they were all out. damn it. I'll just be jealous of poohbearhunney that she has them. Speaking of poohbearhunney she gave me a link for a cool hip hop workout http://www.nike.com/nikewomen/us/index.jhtml I can't wait to get it and try it out. 

I'm gonna try to get the kids off to the park after nap so I can get in another workout. I'm doing really well getting up at 5:30 to workout with Denise Austin at 6. I can see the changes in my body and I'm loving it. I can do this how ever long it takes me."

"event","For DH's bday I got Yankees ticket. (excuse me while I throw up LOL) The game is Sept 5th I wouls like to lose 20lbs by then that gives me all summer to get in alot of exercise outside. 

In order to reach this goal I will do walks both with the kids and by myself
I'm going to ride my bike as well.
I'll have the kids outside alot so I'm going to run around with them in the yard.
I already workout in the morning but my plan is to do M,W,F the 1 hour show and Tues and Thur the 30 mins show.
When I'm sitting or standing I'll be moving all the time. doing lunges, side to side steps, if I'm near my weights I'll grab one to help with toning I'm going to do everything I can to get this challenge done. 

Everyone is welcome to challenge me I'm up for it and I need all the encouragment I can get and all the pushing you want to give me.

"event","I finally finally got out of my slump a few weeks ago I said bye bye to 177 HELLOO 173 I'll be in the 160's in no time. I realized I had to go back to strict WW's. I have to count my points and journal it's the ONLY thing that works for me. I have now proven to myself that I can't just keep track in my head or wait til the end of the day I have to do it the minute I'm doing it. 

I'll be so glad this summer when we can get outside. I think I might try jogging in the mornings. I won't have to get the girls up so I'll be able to go out around 6:30 and be home by 7:30 or I can go back to my hour workout on my bike and treadmill in the morning. It'll also help that I'm signing the girls up for summer activites. Swim lessons, and mini camps will keep us busy. Margaret starts soccor in a few weeks I'm waiting to hear from the coach. I want to try to lose a bug amount of weight this summer and be outside as much as possible with the kids."

"event","OH MY GOD I just tried some plain low fat yogurt it was nasty I thought I was eating sour cream. NEVER ever again will I eat it. I got it for part of a calcuim diet I'm doing for 2 days. I'm really bad about getting in my milk products. I dug out my exercise ball and have been using it this week. I really want a video to go with it. 

Green Tea I just can't seem to drink it. I got it to try along time ago and come only drink it a little at a time. I bought some Chai tea adn like it. It's not the best but it's alright.Chai Tea is supposed to help flush out your system.

I finally was able to get to the grocery store I'm all stocked up on my fruits and veggies again and healthy treats for me. I just have to bug Andrea for a few of her recipes she's been making.

YUK I still have the taste from the sour cream tasting yogurt.."

This wa sa great workout but I'm gonna be hurtin in the morning.

I've been wanting to make chili for a few weeks now and last night I finally made a list of stuff I needed I also knew mom and Jerimie wouldn't go for a veggie chili so I got stuff for my chili and the regular chili I usually make. I picked the bean and lentail chili is was so good. I'm gonna have to make a note for next time to cut back on the chili powder. Yikes it was hot. 

I'm gonna keep looking up recipes and trying them out I'm not cutting out meat but I can cut back.

"event","I can tell I ate horribly this weekend. I was on the run early yeaterday for my conference I had coffie there and grabbed a breakfast bisquit thing after my class. Jerimie didn't want to fix lunch and I was to tired to do it. So he went to hardees and got me a sandwich. I didn't drink any water and when I got up from my nap I felt like crap. We ate late last night because we went to Rockwell City to trick or treat. Today has been a little better I had a really good breakfast but lunch sucked and I still haven't had much water so much for a good WI this week. I'll be happy when all the cnady is out of the house. Tomorrow I'm up ealry to workout if it kills me to get up. No more pop just water and no more fast food for a very long time. 

The fast food was a good thing though. Atleast I got sick from eating it then I now that my body is getting it out of my system and I won't be tempted to get it when I'm out and busy I'll just have to come home and fix something good for me."

"event","I have maded several mini goals and the first one I'm working on is for my trip to Minnesota. I want to be some where in the 170's range by the time I go. I'm doing really well and am well on my way. I know I can get there as long as I stick to my routine. It'll be so much better next week Ann will be back home so she'll be around to kick my butt when I'm being lazy. 

I just did 15 mins on my bike I wanted to do more but I'm just so tired. I'm gonna lay down after McKayla gets here. BJ is picking Margaret up from school so I won't have to worry about getting up to go do that. I just need a little nap. I did a workout yesterday that I had taped off tv. It was Denise Austin's. She has always been a foavorite she targets different body areas daily. yesterday was a fast burning stomach abs, OH MY GOD. I thought i was going to pass out at the end was a short weight workout which I didi also. 

I measured around my stomach and since March when I took my last measurements I've lost 2 inches. My arms are bigger because I've been using weights. I really need to have help doing it so I can stand still and get the tape measure in the right spot. Maybe I can talk Jerimie into helping I was going to wait for my trip to Minnesota to have Andrea but I just can't."

Prep Time: 15 minutes 
Cook Time: 2 hours 
Yield: 6 to 8 servings 

This is the most delicious and vibrant take on chicken soup, the get well classic, that I could come up with. Lots of hearty pieces of chicken meat, a sweet broth with lots of bright veggies. I add a touch of heat with hot sauce at the end to get a little sweat going to get all those evil sick bugs out. Make it ahead of time and just heat it up at my friend's house.


4 small onions, quartered 
6 cloves garlic, peeled 
1 pound carrots, peeled and cut into -2inch chunks 
2 pounds chicken thighs, skin removed 
Handful thyme sprigs 
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 
1 1/2 pounds red bliss potatoes, washed and quartered 
2 handfuls green beans, trimmed 
Hot pepper sauce, to taste

In a large pot, combine onions, garlic, carrots, chicken and thyme. Season with salt and pepper. Add cold water to cover. Bring to boil then reduce heat to a simmer. Skim and discard any scum that may come to the top. 
Simmer until the meat of the chicken falls off the bone with almost no pressure from a fork, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Remove the chicken pieces to a plate. Use 2 forks to separate the meat from the bone. Add the meat back to pot. 

Add the potatoes, cook until fork tender, about 20 minutes. Add green beans, cook until crisp-tender, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat, add hot sauce, salt and pepper to taste."

So as of yesterday I am down 26 lbs for good. I really need to take pictures so I can look back on the transformation I've gone through. I also need to do my measurements. I might have Andrea do them when I go up in Nov since it's best to have someone else do them so you can stand straight. I've been making good food choses. I've been making several huge pots of low point soups so I can freeze then and get them out when I want. I really have to work on planning for the week and sticking to it. I'm doing that this week. 

This is my workout plan for the next month in order to be fit for Team 4Mom. 
Get up with my 1st alarm at 5:30 hop on my tradmill or bike for an hour or half hour each. then after Emma leaves do some floor workouts and weight training. I want to work on my abs to daily. I have the option of doing a workout in the morning that on tv it's with Denise Austin she has 2 half hour shows daily. SO I might go back and forth. So I have that planned I just have to follow through with it and I'm going to the best I can."

But I'm down to 183.5 I haven't seen that number since I was pregant with Margaret. Now Today I jumped on the scale just for the hell of it. I was 182. OH MY GOD!!! I might acutally get to the weight I have on my drivers license soon.


I didn't get a workout done yesterday. My buddy Ann volunteered to help out at work thur and fri and next week to. But I did get the rest of the windows closed and plastic on and I did get the touch ups done in the kitchen. I just have to get the border put up and then I think I'm done in the kitchen. Then it's on to the entry way and basement. I should do some yard work that would count as a workout. I was gonna hop on my gazelle and do the shuffle workout but I'm just so tired. I'll figure something out to do..

I popped in Richard adn went to town. After that I ate my yummy oatmeal. I've decided I really don't like the vanilla soy milk. I'm gonna stick to the flavored kind I found out this weekend the kind I've been drinking is only 1 pt. Here I was using the one on my WW site and it was 3 pts. After Margaret left I decided to move out the fridge I have to clean back there sometime so we can paint. I was attacked by so many dust bunnies. GEEEEZZZZZZ I got that done and scrubbed the floor. I got some nails hammered in where I want stuff to go once we're done painting. it's been one busy day. This is the first tiem I've really been able to sit down. I hope I'm like this everyday I'll be skinny in no time and my house will be spottless.  Thanks to Ann I have a new item for my Harry Potter collection. Today was just a good day for that to. I got 2 of the books I got on ebay and Ann's little treat for me. Today is just great. I do my WI tomorrow. I have my fingers crossed I weighed myself yeterday and I was 184 but when I did it this morning not so good. I might have been standing wrong.  On the move."

She did her 30 mins and I did mine and then we checked in with each other. .I did 10 mins of weights and floor exercise also for a grand total of 3 pts.. I ate my points and didn't go over or stay under I did the right number and got just about all my fruits and veggies. I only got 1 glass of milk I think I'm gonna start making my oatmeal with milk instead of water. I really like the soy milk I got vanilla and cappocino flavor this time. I'm out of my oatmeal do I'm gonna pick some up in the morning. 

I sent Ann my recipes so she could get some new ideas. I'm completely in love with Andrea's stuffed squash recipe. I bought several squash at the farmer's market last weekend. I made 3 of them and froze 2 of them. I added a few things to it this time and it made it even more yummier then it already was. 

Well it's off to work for me. I have a busy mornign so I'm gonna try to get up early to do a workout since I might not be home to do one with Ann.."

So I set all my alarms last night and Vinnie just happened to get up at 5:45 which 15 minutes before my 1st alarm. so I set the VCR to tape Denise Austin which is who I used to workout with way back in high school. So after Vinnie went back to sleep around 6:10 I went down got my workout clothes on and hopped on my stationary bike. I always read my book while on my bike just to keep me occupied so I don't get bored and stop. After about the 2nd chapter I had read I looked adn it had been 30 mins already I was really shocked I rode for about 20 more minutes which is nothing compared to my wonder friend Andrea who goes for ever on her real bike. WHen I was done I had gone 7 miles. So after I got showered and dressed I made up my mind I needed to write down my food intake thats what helps me the best instead of just keeping notes in my head. I just have to do it everyday. I talked to 1hipmom for a while and did the whole breakfast lunch nap thing with the kids. After the cravens left I decided to do one of the 2 workouts I taped this morning. I feel pretty good now. 


Last night I thought about how I was going to have the energy to get up in teh morning so early and I need to be doing it all the time with Margaret going to school all day so I thought why not take my Vitamin b and B12 before bed it must have worked because I was ready to go when Vinnie was up at 5:45. I'm going to try this every night to see how it goes. I want so badly to go for a walk but I don't want to take the kids with they like to look at everything so it would take forever just to cross the street. I'm hoping Jerimie gets home from fishing before it gets to dark and maybe I can hit the track up at the school. i'm dying to try out my new shoes I got his past weekend. Jerimei bought me a pair of the new NIKE spring shoes that are out. The mall was having big sales with the no tax weekend. 

Well this is the end of a good day for me. I'm hoping that I can journal every night so I can see how I'm doing weeks from now."

So far I've gotten back down to my 10% and lost 2 more lbs. I figured it up since October when I started dieting I've lost 41lbs. Why would I give up now when I'm doing so well. I can tell I've lost weight I can fit back into my 16's and I'm working towards fitting into my 14's that are cin the bottom on my dresser by the end of summer. I want to succeed this time I'm not going to give up. I know I can do this. I just have to tell myself each day that I'm doing a great job and I'm seeing results. It may take a while but thats ok and I might have a few set backs along the way but I'm going to get back on my feet everytime.

I looked at a picture that Margaret took to school last year. The theme was family and I looked huge yes I was pregnant but I was sitting down and I just looked FAT! I have to get together with Andrea one of these weekends and have her take pictures of me. I'm going to do this every few months so that I can see how far I've come along and I'm not going back to what I looked like in that family picture Margaret took to school. EVER!!!!!!!!"

If my scale is any indication of my WI tomorrow I should be down 3 or 4 lbs. Very exciting. I just have to keep telling myself to keep going. I almost look forward to getting up an hour early to ride. I look forward to hearing the impossible trivia question to see if I know it and see how fast I can call the radio station, as of late not fast enough. I have been right the last two times but then phone just doesn't dial fast enough.

"event","Will this week I've been trying to eat better. I told Jerimie tonight that I want to get the back room cleaned up so I can use my treadmill to walk. That is my favorite thing to do is to walk and with it getting colder these days I'm not going to chance getting sick with Vinnie around. 

Jerimie tells me how he wants to get in shape and work out with me but I just know it won't happen. It was nice when we did go to the gym together but after a while he would go after work and not tell me then when I'd want to go he'd say no cause he had already gone and I'd end up not going. I like working out with some one even though he was off doing weights we would start out on the treadmill and I would do a few weights with him it was nice to do it together. I think if we buy some free weights he might do lifting with me but he's not home enough to really do anything else. I need to get busy with my workout tapes. I just need to fit in a time I can do it. I don't like people to watch so I have to do it when Jerimie and mom are gone which is tricky some days. I might have to get up earlier then I do now and do them but I'll have to be really quiet and that doesn't work with my WATP workouts. 

I really need to look into a plan that suits me. I thought about going back to WW but then I looked up a few of the Fad diets and there were a few that I thought about doing. I just need to get myself set and get my but in gear."

"event","After nine months of being pregnant I'm back to getting in shape. On Sept 22nd the day of delivery I weighed 217 when I left on Friday I weighed 212. Today is 2 weeks since I went into the hospital and I am do to 198. Thats without really doing anything. So I'm setting some mini goals.

1 drink more water
2 get my exercise, at least 3 times a week
3 start eating right I'm not eating for two anymore.
4 start journaling again.
That is my start. I want to get down to what I was before I got pregnant which was 190 189. I was going back and forth between the two."

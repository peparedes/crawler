Ugh, my back still aches from PE lesson! I was pushed to do sit-ups by my really strong PE teacher. Ahahahaha okay, I know I sound kind of stupid, but I'm just&nbsp;not flexible at all! So my back really aches because of that :(

Made almost 100 dumplings with Mom about an hour ago, for my&nbsp;relatives.&nbsp;Skipping early chinese new year gathering with relatives, so only my mom and my sister are there right now, while I'm at home! :D

I mean, who has chinese new year gatherings this early? :/ And I'm having 2 math tests tomorrow, I needa study. Ha ha. Hmm, but I'm still kind of worried I might have offended them by not going, but ... well ... :/"

"event","Feeling really hungry. My mom's still cooking and it's already 6.40pm. Urrgghhhh. We're going to have steamboat for dinner, though, which makes me really happy :) 

School today was fun, as usual. Ahhhh, I'm so glad I got into class 3-4. Still, I am NEVER glad that I was not able to take Literature, NO&nbsp;NO&nbsp;NO. I still want to take Lit so super badly :( 

Can't wait for Mister Edgerton to come back to school! He says he'll be back on February 3 and he'll stay for 2 weeks :) Awesome, huh? I'm going to ask him if there's any chance he could get me my EOY exam's english essay back for me... Hehehe, I'm kinda embarrassed to ask anyone, but Mister Edgerton's the only teacher who'd understand why :) 

Realised I haven't typed in my LJ and my tumblr for so long, so here I am, updating both of them. 

By the way - I&nbsp;AM&nbsp;SO&nbsp;EXCITED&nbsp;TO&nbsp;SEE&nbsp;THE&nbsp;FRAY! 

Ahhh, the boys are going to make my day AWESOME :) I wonder if they'll play any new songs .... :D HOPEFULLY&nbsp;THEY&nbsp;WILL! 

Just remembered I need to buy a birthday gift for my editorial senior, Janet, on Friday. Ahhhh, I can't wait for friday :) Have to think of a gift soon, though. HMMM.... 

Well, this is still really pathetic because, as you can clearly see, I still can't figure out the 'fake cut' thingy of LJ. That's sorta like the most important and basic thing, but LJ doesn't exactly teach you ... I think. Urrrgghh, my LJ posts look stooooopid, don't they?

All the stuff I bought - Yellow sweater, purple stockings and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind DVD. 
Wore my black boots today for the first time! Expensive but comfy :) 
I was disappointed to see that HMV still didn't have The Fray Deluxe Album! Furious at store and wanted to bang the cashier counter for an explanation, but held back because I was afraid they wouldn't let me buy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind if I do that. 
Right-o. San Francisco in 4 days! I'm counting down :) 
Finally read that boring chinese book finish last night, so I can start on my book review tomorrow, and I wouldn't need to worry about it when I'm there or when I'm back. I'm organized, I know :)

"event","So, this officially sucks. 
I always told people that I think I'd get the literature combination for next year, mainly because &quot;not many people might want it&quot;. What I meant then was that few people like and want literature, so there'll be vacancy for me next year. Little did I know that all BECAUSE of the really, really, really, REALLY, few people who chose literature in their combination, I did NOT get the combination. 
I don't get to take literature next year, and that's the same for the rest of the few EIGHT people who wanted literature. 
My school is not offering literature. 
My bloody hell stupid school is not offering literature to the whole grade of secondary threes next year!!! 

Gosh, I've never hated my school more than this. 
What would other schools say? &quot;Jurong doesn't have literature? That's shameful, they must not have any literature-ish people at all.&quot; 
What would my seniors and those graduated people from my school say? &quot;My gosh, this batch of people has no creative people.&quot; 
Okay, maybe not liking or wanting to take literature does not mean not creative, but literature is IMPORTANT and the fact that so few people in my batch want it, shows that my school doesn't have many people who believe that literature is important. It's like a symbol, showing that culture exists. My school doesn't have any bloody culture. 
Still, I think 8 people is alright, if there are people at all, 8 people is great. Why can't they just teach us 8 people?? 
Mister Chen says there aren't enough literature teachers to teach us. 
More like not enough literature teachers willing to teach us. 
Don't the teachers want us to study literature? It shows that we are interested in culture and the beauty of literary works! 
Urrgghh. 
I don't know what I'm going to do. 
My current combination for next year: 
English, Additional Maths, Elementary Maths, Chinese, Pure Chemistry, Pure Physics, Elective Geography, and Core History. 
What if I can't take Literature in Junior College? 
If that happens, I'll bang on the school gates demanding to see the Jurong principal and just shout at how my dreams and chances at pursuing literature are ruined, all because of them. 
I sound exaggerating, yeah, but that's because I'm so angry at them! 
My sister says some of her friends didn't take Literature in secondary school but are able to take it in JC, so that sounds promising... 
But. What if it's really hard to cope? If I don't learn it next year and the year after that, it might be hard for me in JC. JC is already much harder than secondary school, so I'm not sure I might be able to take it if I don't continue learning it where I am right now. 

I should have never came to Jurong. 
I've been playing The Fray's songs on repeat. They're serving as some sort of remedy for my... I don't think it counts as depression. Or a simple &quot;sadness&quot;. So probably it's my frustration. Yeah, frustration sounds right. 
I watched the How To Save A Life's DVD video once more, and it does work. I'm feeling so much better now. 
I'm not focusing on how angry I am at my school, principal and teachers, and also how angry I am at them for spoiling my chances... 
My mom wants to enroll me in those courses where I can learn literature outside, but really, I don't think there are much out there. I want to be learning what the rest of the secondary schools are learning and take the O-Levels. Do many outside-school courses offer that?? 
The answer to that is: doubtful. 

.............. 
Let's talk about something else other than that... Mister Edgerton sent me a facebook message, thanking me for that picture frame I made for him. Ha ha, made me really happy about that. Until I scanned the message and saw where he said that my writing has improved throughout the period when he taught me. He said he knows I'll continue to improve next year and told me good luck. 
Those words made me go :( 
No one has ever really encouraged me so much about my writing than Mister Edgerton. 
My classmates all just tease and make fun of me, about how I do great for an essay/composition. They just say, &quot;It's xueting, what do you expect??&quot;, or &quot;What? Her again??&quot;, or saying on Facebook that I'd publish an amazing essay when asked what I'd do with a million dollars (Wei yuan), and that isn't complimenting. It sounds as though they're saying it... sarcastically. What, is it so bad to have a love for writing and literature? 
Today when Mister Chen announced that literature is dropped, jiaxin, vyshnavi, shirley, vanessa, chingwen, calvin and jia wei all went throwing looks in my direction. Calvin said, &quot;Xueting, don't be sad already!&quot; and Jia Wei was laughing (LAUGHING, can you believe it?!) and said, &quot;Xueting, you crying, huh?&quot; 
It was so hard trying to contain all that anger, frustration and sadness altogether so that they won't see and make fun of it. 

Okay I know I'm sticking to this stupid subject for so long... sorry. 
Still repeating The Fray songs all the way. They're making this so much better for me, I LOVE&nbsp;THE&nbsp;BOYS.

Hoping that this won't be as bad as I think it will be :/"

Last day to see him until January when he promises to come back to visit.<br />Mister Edgerton's a great teacher and very cool person and he's taught me for almost two years now, so it's really sad to see him leave.<br />I was so hoping he'd become a permanent teacher in Jurong, so even though he might not be teaching me next year and all, I can still see him in school and talk to him! He may even teach me english next year! ....<br />But obviously it's not possible for him to be a permanent teacher in Jurong... He's travelling over to Cambodia and Vietnam... and then back to the States, as he said. Awww. It's just so sad because I know I'm going to miss him so, so, soooo much next year.<br />He told me San Francisco is his favourite state in US and now I'm getting even more excited!<br />He told me San Fran's art galleries are fantastic so now I'm even more anticipating to visit those two museums I've already planned out to visit there: the Legion of Honor; and de Young Museum.<br />Mister Edgerton's got me even more excited for the trip!!<br />Ha ha ha.

"event","I love today! 
I found out today from my results slip that I'm 10th in my class, which has 40 people. I'm also 44th in my level, which has 198 people. I love today!! 
I also found lots of very cool and hilarious The Fray videos which I spent about an hour obsessing over just now! Ha ha ha. I always love it when I find cool videos that I've never seen before. Who doesn't, huh? 
They were at Madrid in Spain for a concert, and during a break Isaac began speaking spanish! Unbelievable, but he sounds really good at it! His voice is always beautiful anyway! His spanish ain't good, though, ha ha ha! And that's what's so funny! 

Isaac was like: (ALL&nbsp;IN&nbsp;SPANISH&nbsp;UNLESS&nbsp;SAID) 
&quot;Okay, so how are you all doin' today?&quot; 
(in english) &quot;Sorry, my spanish isn't very good...&quot; 
(spots a group of girls with the letters of &quot;The Fray&quot; painted on their palms) 
&quot;There's... three girls with our names on their hands...&quot; 
&quot;Hold on, I gotta get a picture of this...&quot; 
(Rod runs up on stage and takes the picture (!!!), audience cheers) 
&quot;Okay now... this is really important so listen a moment...&quot; 
&quot;I've got a joke here... and it's kind of bad... but listen..&quot; 
&quot;My friends here don't know how to speak spanish so I want to impress them a little...&quot; 
&quot;So you guys better laugh!&quot; 
(audience roars with laughter!!!) 
&quot;Wait a minute, I haven't started the joke yet! Shut up!&quot; 
(here I didn't know what he said...) 
(They start to sing they're cover of shakira's &quot;hips don't lie&quot;, so I guess Isaac must have been saying that it was next.) 

This might sound confusing, but someone commented on the video, someone from Spain, no doubt, that there's this history of some guy insulting some Spanish king by asking him to shut up. Ha ha ha ha ha. Isaac cracks me up. I was laughing throughout the whole thing. 


So, now I'm deciding what movie to watch with Shirley on monday. Which would be better? My sister's keeper? Or love happens? &quot;Love happens&quot; is that Jennifer Aniston movie. It seems kind of nice. My sister's keeper might be too sad, and I might not really want too sad movies. I feel like watching &quot;Julie and Julia&quot; but it's released a few weeks ago so the showtimes are all really late, like 6pm+. So, I don't think we can watch it... Awwwww. I wanna see french food! And of course the movie sounds nice. I shall tell Shirley about them in school tomorrow and ask her which she prefers. &quot;Love happens&quot; is the only romance movie showing, so I'd probably want that, compared to a really saddening movie... 

Well, dinner is gonna be ready soon. I'm feelin' extremely bored. 
I seriously hope to be able to take Literature next year, and also to go to class 3-4! I must! Or I'll feel so angry. 
Alrighty, I'm off."

"event","That, by the way, is a word that David Ives used in his play, ""Ancient History.""  It describes the width and breadth of items I must address in this entry.

1) Online regulations have come from on high at work.  Expect chances of me online during work hours to be slim or zip.  I know, boo hoo, etc.  I'll try to do more replying/posting at home.

2) Had a huge revelation!  I should not be online at work, anyway.  Excepting breaks or emergencies.  I should just enjoy my job.  <i>What?</i>  I don't enjoy my job?  <i>Perhaps I should be applying for a different one.</i>  Your positive energy would be appreciated.  Some apps and resumes are floating in the abyss, and I have hope.

3) Went to the doctor yesterday.  For the first time since I moved to California over two years ago.  Don't yell at me, <lj user=""Ruby2andor"">, or anyone else for that matter.  I lacked insurance!  I was kind of nervous!  I was lazy!  I have a huge list of excuses!  And besides, I just went!  She and I had a good talk.  Treating Poly-Cystic Ovarian Syndrome with BC and following up with an ultrasound (BLECH!), and weight management with behavioral dietician.  This, I think, is a good thing.  Also was referred to a sleep clinic for apnea.

4) When I first got my hearing aid in junior high, I remember walking outside and saying ""so <i>this</i> is what the wind sounds like.  And today, I can't stop thinking: ""so <i>this</i> is what it feels like to be awake.""  Called the sleep clinic.  They had a slot open last night, and signed me up!  Those of you who've slept in the same room as I (I'm thinking <lj user=""nibsy"">, <lj user=""echo1976"">, <lj user=""thespice""> among others) have heard both my obnoxious snoring and my scary-ass choking and have lived to make fun of me for it.  Apnea kills brain cells and leaves sufferers exhausted.  And I'm finally officially diagnosed!  The sleep study itself was a little freaky.  I had to arrive at the clinic at 10:00 pm, which was weird and spooky in itself.  Then I had wires and microphones attached to every little curve of my face and neck and scalp to measure movement and air.  My whole face was literally covered in tape.  Then I had to fall asleep like that-- and flat on my back.  I can't sleep flat on my back without choking every few moments or so, and it was a miserable few hours before the tech finally came in and put the Constant Positive Air Pressure (CPAP) machine on my nose.  Which was a little freaky too, actually.  Since the air pressure is constant, breathing out feels a little like swimming upstream.  But eventually I dozed off, and <i>didn't wake up for the rest of the night!</i>  When I was woken at 5:30, I felt like I'd had the best sleep of my entire life.  Why didn't you all tell me I was the walking dead?  I will have a consult with the doc in a 10 days or so, and then I will be prescribed a machine of my very own.  Forget Darryl-- from now on, CPAP will be my snugglebunny.

5) My parents are officially retirees.  They have purchased an RV!  It's all tricked-out, too.  Like a bachelor pad, it apparently has couches and chairs that flip or pop out at the touch of a button.  Word is they'll be visiting CA for a whole month this winter!  And dad has mentioned something about Winnebagoing out to a certain <a href=""http://www.witchinghour.org"">lit conference</a> next year.  Please feel free to mock the recreational vehicle owners.

6) Le boy returns from UK this weekend.  I intend to pick Darryl up wearing my best romantic sundress (perhaps you know it... green checked, mid-fifties silhouette?) and take him to the Grove.  

7) Azkaban!  Azkaban Azkaban Azkaban Azkaban!  Is one week from today.  And I've done a brilliant job avoiding reviews and images and clips and spoilers.  Unlike last time, I'd like to be surprised a bit this time.  Nevertheless, from the sound of the articles and interviews I have seen, it looks to be the film I wanted it to be.

8) Witching Hour IP team-- have you read your transcript?  Have you emailed me with the necessary questions and answers?  Hmm?"

Listened to some of the testimony between various generals and government representatives regarding the Iraqi prisoner abuse.  It was annoying.  Take, as example, this exchange between an general and a senator (I didn't catch names.  Who are you kidding?  It was 6:15 am.)

<font size=""1"">Senator: To your knowledge, were the rules of engagement ever reviewed by the secretary of defense?
General: The secretary of defense is not required to review the rules of engagement.
Senator: But to your knowledge, were the rules of engagement ever reviewed by him?
General: To my knowledge, I never forwarded it to him.
Senator: But to your knowledge, did he ever review them?
General: What?
Senator: To your knowledge, did the secretary of defense ever review the rules of engagement?
General: The secretary of defense is not required to review the rules of engagement.
Senator: But did he?
General: I did not forward the rules of engagement to him.
Senator: I-say-I-say, you are not answering my question!
Other General who has Legal Experience: General, if I may, I was involved in the legal drafting of the document, and perhaps I can best answer for you.
Senator: All right, then?
General: The secretary of defense is not required to review the rules of engagement.
Senator: *screams*</font>

I could only deny my genealogy and genetics for so long.   From a line of farmers, it was inevitable that one day, I'd put my hands in the soil like those who came before me. 

At long last, another mostly-visual entry, this time depicting the sorts of flowers I planted in my new flowerboxes this weekend.

Creeping up five-foot wooden stakes, my <b>jasmine vines</b> smell incredible and will bloom three seasons out of four.  Eventually, if I buy a proper trellis, they will frame my apartment door.

And that, for Prisoner of Azkaban, he decided to do it all himself.

I don't know if it's true.  But damn... DAMN, it sounds true.  I'm online at the <a href=""http://mp.aol.com/dalaillama/audio.index.adp?mxid=1134931&_AOLFORM=w604.h305.p7.R37&speed=bb"">AOL Listening Party</a> for the soundtrack, and it's amazing.  It sounds so rich, and uses old themes and new ones to such chilling effect.  Go listen!  Now!

<b>Edited to say:</b>  Having given it a full listen-through, I have to say that the thing that stands out most to me is that Williams has upped the dramatic stakes with the music, which more than likely means that Cuaron and the production staff has upped the stakes as well.  This is good news."

Remind me to stop googling old classmates.  It only makes me feel bad.  Also you might want to remind me that eventually it's possible someone might google my successes.  If I ever have any.

On the brighter side, it's been a long time since the primary word anyone has used to describe me was ""graceful.""  Not that I'm not.  I am graceful.  Just that it's rare that someone points it out now that I don't generally sport the slippers or tutu of the past.  So you can imagine my pleasure when le boy referred to me as a graceful lady."

It doesn't yet make it a full-day park, but it definitely improves it.  While I miss the forward-motion 5th dimension room, there's a really awesome twilight-zone-mirror effect that makes this ride unique from its Florida cousin.

2.  Hollywood Hills are difficult to navigate and harder to climb.  The people with whom we mingled were lovely; other people in attendance were an eclectic bunch.  I never realized that, in the presence of a man trying <i>so</i> hard to look cool and wealthy, I would want to punch him in the face a la Not!Canon!Hermione.

3.  Dating can be lovely.  I'd forgotten.

"event","During my favorite friends episode, ""The One Where No One's Ready"" (which was aired in primetime last night as a part of the ""best of"" finale countdown-- you might remember its classic references to ""going commando"") Chandler poses an intriguing question about Donald Duck's habit of wrapping a towel around his waist after a shower.  Odd, of course, because Donald Duck does not generally wear pants.  I grant you, before I leave, a link to the official <a href="" http://psc.disney.go.com/guestservices/8707.html#8707 "">Disney FAQ</a>, which, believe it or not, <i>answers</i> this question. 

I will now make like a banana and split.  Back on the tricky 4/1."

"event","Today I saw ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."" It was quite better than its lovely screenplay in some ways, and outshined by it in others. <lj-cut text=""not particularly spoilery behind the cut."">If you've seen the film already and are interested in the path from page to screen, I suggest you read an early draft, now online <a href=""http://www.beingcharliekaufman.com/spotless.txt"">here</a>.  If you do, keep an eye out for the lovely literary/poetic/musical references that Kaufman originally made-- all are lovely and conspicuously missing. Also check out the bookender scenes. While in its celluloid form, ""Sunshine"" finally offers a solid Kaufman third act, I felt that the original draft featured perfect ending. 

Nevertheless, it's a film well worthwhile the admission, and knowing how many of you have had similar lovelife experiences to mine, I suspect you'll be as equally moved.  Solid performances, especially a moving one by Jim Carrey.  Vivid and sometimes (properly) spastic directing.  This one'll be long close to my heart.</lj-cut> 

Then I saw ""The Passion of the Christ."" I could probably boil my reaction down to two words: <i>""Jesus Christ.""</i> But as it's a very personal reaction, I'll get a little more specific <lj-cut text=""behind the cut."">behind the cut. 

I don't need to look at anyone's tacky two-bit depiction of an floaty maggot-nosed androgynous devil to recognize that there is evil in the world. 

I don't have to witness a special effects team's depiction of flesh being torn away from a dummy's ribs to understand what Christ's sacrifice means to me. 

I don't want to be told, in any circumstance other than God coming to tea, that anything is ""exactly what happened."" Tonight my father likened faith to buying a house without being able to go inside. You'd want to be able to look in as many windows as possible. I like that metaphor. There are some stories that need to be told by four different narrators to help us to barely begin to grasp the enormity of the message. To condense it down to one is to simplify what needn't be simplified. 

As a filmmaker, I think that Mel Gibson has an unhealthy obsession with slo-mo. And an unhealthy obsession with depicting characters he doesn't like as fey. And an unhealthy obsession with gore-- no more than Tarantino-- but to watch a film in which only the non-gory flashbacks are touching or appealing, one has to wonder why he didn't just make a whole movie of them."

"event","I feel weird quoting a review on the release day of ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" that isn't from that movie, considering I read the screenplay last fall and I've been jonesing for it ever since.  So.  First, I'll say:  GO SEE ""SPOTLESS MIND."" 

Then, I'll say:
God bless NY Times' A. O. Scott.  From his review of ""Taking Lives""--

""From a technical standpoint, Taking Lives is competent and sometimes even impressive. It is cleanly edited and nicely shot -- at times as cool and rich as a York Peppermint Pattie. Beyond that, there is not much to say. Those smashed-up corpses -- they sure are gruesome. That Angelina Jolie -- she sure has some pair of lips. That Kiefer Sutherland -- he sure can be creepy. That Ethan Hawke -- he sure is in this movie."""

"event","I lasted, like, a year and a half on this livejournal before I started revealing how embarrasingly much I like Disneyana.  I give up trying to be nonchallant and businessy about it.  [squee]I'm going to Disney World next week![/squee]  (Why this is any different than my monthly trip to Disneyland is a mystery-- other than the presence of beloved family, and a keen African restaurant called Boma.  And Mission: Space!  And Philharmagic!  And I have nieces and nephews with whom I can ride Dumbo so I don't have to look like a twenty-something who likes Dumbo!  And I'm a huge geek!)

Anyway, there was a column today on <a href=""http://www.mouseplanet.com"">Mouse Planet</a> that discussed why some people are gaga over Disney parks (and products) and some are so nonchallant.  The writer implied that the biggest Disneyana fans grew up in the 50s and 60s, because they witnessed the opening of Disneyland and the rise of Disney on TV.  <lj-cut text=""This is my response:"">This is my response:

""I enjoyed your ponderings on the ""zone"" and its possible origins, but I have one item of contention:  you suggest that a majority of people in the zone grew up in the 50s and 60s.  You failed to consider that the children of the Disney Boomers would also grow up to zone out in Disney parks, during Disney movies and here on Disneyana-loving websites.  

""Many of my friends that grew up 80s had parents who attended or longed to attend Walt's first park in Anaheim.  So when WDW opened, the boomers took my generation of zone-heads to the park.  And we went back again, and again, and again.  (Heck, my family is going back next week, but having blossomed from 5 to 15 members, we're creating a third generation in the zone!)  

""Those same boomers that witnessed the rise of Disney on television via the 'Disneyland' show in its many guises later pounced upon the premium Disney cable channel when it was first introduced.  I still remember the day the cable man came to install it-- the whole family gathered together to watch it. 

""The zoners of the 80s were at a prime age when the canon of films were released on VHS-- we were able to see, at our leisure, all the films that so affected our parents, and in turn affected us.  And that includes 'Darby O'Gill and the Little People.'

""And finally, when the studio started putting out its best work in years, the children of the 1980s were the target audience for the film that issued in the second golden age-- 'The Little Mermaid.'

""If you need evidence, look around the parks... twenty and thirtysomethings are everywhere.  Even those of us without children.  We collect, we visit, we pass on the love of the brand that defined our parents' age and our own.  Don't forget about us!""</lj-cut>

So, friends.  Disney parks.  Yay, or nay?  And if it's nay, why?  And if it's yay, tell me what you like best."

They cook up a scheme with the teacher and am tricked into revealing I can in fact read when the teacher gets to the climax of the short story she's reading and is ""interrupted,"" saying ""I have to go check on something.  Heidi, will you take over reading?""  Stupidly, I do.  Thus begins my career of being a bad liar.

(85-)1986 First grade.  Begin piano lessons.  Am good friends with Mary Wazny.  Walk a mile to her house without supervision.  Freak out parents.  Inspired by my siblings' interest in theatre, I begin to stage full-scale teddy bear productions starring me.  Lots of ""Annie.""  In love with brother's friend Brian Borg who played Charlie Brown.

"event","Some general augh-ing about the Disney turn of events, and JK Rowling's online chat transcripts.  But first, a question...

If you can name the fan or experts who will be most likely interviewed for public news stories about something, I think that makes you an semi-ultimate geek.  I can name likely interviewees (or, ultimate geeks) for five different fan-type communities (some in which I do not participate), and have seen them all interviewed nationally.  I know some of them.  What does this say about me?  And, how many can you name?

<lj-cut text=""Eisner booted from only Chairmanship..."">
Eisner was booted a fews after yesterday's meeting from his position as Chairman of the Board.  He remains on as CEO.  What gall, what balls of that board to spin that 43% vote-of-no-confidence as limited to only the chairman position.  And, what gall, what balls of the board to promote former senator George Mitchell to Chairman AFTER he, himself, had receied a 25% vote-of-no-confidence.  Isn't it standard that anything above 20% is expected to step down from the position?  Why, then, would they promote him?  Are they just going ignore that vote?  And aren't they going to toss Eisner out on his posterior after something that embarassing for the company?  AUGH!</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Potter author spills...very little."">Just because JK Rowling <a href=""http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/JKRWorldBookDay2004.html"">talks the big doublespeak</a> about who will end up with whom, it does not mean that it supports your ship (or doesn't.)  I'm far beyond pretending I don't like Harry with Hermione (I Mary Sue Me.) (Read that two ways; I Mary Sue ""me"".  Sue me.)  But I really don't believe that anything she said is definitive about Harry/Hermione, Ron/Hermione, Hermione/Krum, (yes, <lj uer=heidi8>, Hermione/Draco) or Giant Squid/Dennis.  

Am disappointed to see that Sirius was not in Slytherin.  When will we see a good Slytherin?  Will it, please, be Dumbledore?

Have back-stepped from my opinion that we'll never see Sirius again, because I think she back-stepped, too.

Some people were asking questions that made me think of Comic Book Guy.  ""In episode G38-19, Radioactive Man has his ionic sword, but he had lost it in episode G39-13; how can this be?""

Neville has had his turning point!  Why did nobody ask about the replacement of his wand--which, we know, was his father's, not his own perfect match.

""A certain Ms. Radcliffe is desperate"" to have the Hermione/Draco question answered?  Are we to assume she meant Emma Watson (in which case, does Watson believe H/D is a possibility, and is she Mary-Sue-ing, and thence is Felton the one she's ""in love with, professionally""?)  Or is it Daniel to whom she refers, in which case, is he as gay as we all guessed?  Or did Emma and Dan get married in a secret and illegal ceremony?

Nothing, nothing, nothing of Snape!  Except that she again yammers that if she reveals anything, it'll give stuff away.  Duh.  Well, Aud, I guess no patronus or boggart answer for you.  No limits to your imagination yet.  Yes, that patronus is obviously a unicorn.  Pure, virginal heart, that one.

Two questions for readers with good memories or people with books nearby:  1) From OotP, what is Hermione's patronus?  2) From Fantastic Beasts, What is Crookshanks, if not all cat?

I thought I wasn't ready to get excited about book 6, seeing as I am taking what is apparently going to be eight months to re-read 5 (to make up for reading it in two days initially.)  Turns out, though, I am.  And no ETA in sight.  AUGH!"

And we're all waiting with bated breath to see if Roy Disney's ""savedisney.com"" grassroots movement calling for shareholders to vote against Eisner worked.  They're not announcing it until the end.

The two things I liked most about last night's television festivities:

1) My love for (and crush on) Andrew Stanton grew tenfold.  Tenfold.  He's written every Pixar movie, he's funny and charming... AND he gushed with love for his adorable chubby high school sweetheart wife in front of the whole world.  I can't even hold a grudge against her.  They're too cute to be jealous.

2) The opening moments of the half-hour preshow, in which Keisha Castle-Hughes wished most to meet Johnny Depp because she deemed him a ""total stud,""  and the subsequent closing moments of said show, where she met Johnny Depp and <i>he</i> gushed all over <i>her.</i>"

A gang of us had an Oscar pool.  Of all awards, I only missed on four (two of which I suspected I'd miss on-- best actor and best live short.) I may not be the tops, but I'm personally proud.

Picks are <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkmastermo/92664.html?thread=435960#t435960"">here</a>.

Let me state that what I picked differed in many cases from what I wanted.  I love me some LotR, but the editing didn't deserve credit.  Sadly, no award for ""Kiss at the End of the Rainbow,"" but at least it wins for best Oscar performance in the hearts of viewers that are not undead.  I was blue along with Murray. Penn was good; this was Murray's career best.

Anyway.  Good show!  I'd like to thank the academy for being predictable, and also my father, without whom I'd only have been commentating to my television screen."

In the grand lesson of this post, let us learn to not yammer on about our dating possibilities--though in TV terms we might liken one to Carrie's gentleman and the other to Charlotte's--until we know, for sure, that they aren't gay and taking advantage of us.

I find it at least a little bit ironic that the title of that entry is ""I enjoy being a girl,"" while I can be directly quoted as saying the following last night: ""I hate being a girl!  Why do girls have to over-interpret everything?!""  Nevertheless, reading this entry helped me to shift focus from said interpretation, re-directing it towards the possible glories of the early moments of boy-meets-girl."

"event","Thanks to Mike for the questions...
1) If you were picked to, say, get all expenses paid to live anywhere in the world for six months (but only one place), where would you want to go?
Well, for much of my life I would have said Los Angeles.  That's moot now.  I will say, without much hesitation, London.  Though, actually, if I had an evening's allowance, I'd say Boston, to wave at Mike and have dinner with B before they both move to LA.  (And, really, to do some area-scoping for <lj user=""_witchinghour_"">)

2) You and Harry Potter: What's up with that?
How Simpson 134th Episode Spectacular: ""What's the deal with Potter?  You know what I mean.""  Harry Potter is a teenage wizard, he likes quiddich and chocolate frogs.  Seriously, though.  Between my love of children's lit, my nature as an anglophile, and my obsessive-compulsive tendencies, Potter and I are a match made in heaven.  Or, if not that, some sort of limbo stasis.

3) What is your all-time favorite movie, and why?
That is a difficult, difficult question to answer.  I could say ""Citizen Kane,"" because I think it's the best made.  Or I could say ""The Usual Suspects,"" because I still get the same feeling at the end as I did during the first viewing.  But I'll probably say ""When Harry Met Sally,"" because it's the one I watch every six months.  It never ceases to make me laugh.

4) Fruits come in many different sizes and flavors. What fruit could you deal without ever having to see again in your lifetime?
Guava, because it taunts me with its pretty.  It says, mockingly, ""your bowel doesn't appreciate me.""  And then it laughs like Nelson Muntz.

5) Okay, I was reaching a bit with that last question. Who are some of your heroes/role models in life?
Well, first and foremost, my parents.  I've never known anyone so kind and generous, so willing to sacrifice for their loved ones, so quick with a joke when the world seems crappy.  And their marriage should be a self-help book.  Professionally, Maya Derren for blazing the way for women in filmmaking and never selling out her art (though I plan to.)  Spiritually, my friend, Father Truc Nguyen, who made it through the Vietnam war, a rough immigration, a thousand heartbreaks, and a career in electrical engineering and still has the compassion to reach out to his community in every way he can.

OK, more than three words.  Who has a spare copy of the tape that you could send to Audra and I?  I beg of you.  We didn't think of taping it and it was a mistake.  Will work for puppet cancer."

"event","This week Comcast has announced that it intends to generate a hostile takeover of Disney.  Perhaps this came from left field for those of you who haven't obsessively followed the Mouse's business developments.  Since my Eisner &Co gossip obsession rivals the media's Bennifer blitz (mostly  because I would love to someday be on the staff of a Disney I <i>respect</i>-- which I do not, presently), I thought I ought to post a history of Disney kerfuffling and weigh in on the matter.  <lj-cut text=""It's fascinating stuff."">It's fascinating stuff.

1966- Walt Disney dies.  The company, in the hands of his brother Roy O., continues to develop his Florida project, which ends up being more of Disneyland copy than the community Walt had in mind.   <u>The Jungle Book</u> is released; it is the last movie Walt had a hand in developing.

1971- Roy Disney dies, leaving the company to fend without its originators.  Movies (not to offend the Disneyana fans, myself included) take a dive in quality.  <u>Robin Hood</u> even copies animation movement cell-for-cell from <u>Snow White</u>, <u>Jungle Book</u>, and <u>Aristocats</u>.  Technological animation innovation-- which Walt so championed-- is at a standstill.  

1984- For all of the time and money put into the development, <u>The Black Cauldron</u> is a financial and critical flop.  Later, the company pales next to the work of former-Dis-animator-turned-entrepreneur Don Bluth and his <u>American Tail.</u>  It is the last straw.  Things look bad for the Mouse.

1984- Roy E. Disney (Roy O's son) publicly leaves the Disney Board of Directors; makes a big fuss about how the company has turned away from its roots.

1984- Saul Steinberg plans to buy Disney by hostile takeover.  In an effort to prevent this, Disney acquires more property to increase DIS stock prices-- a ""poison pill.""

1984- White knight Bass brothers buy up the Disney stock to prevent the possible dissolution of the company.  They sell it back to Disney, but in the process return Roy Jr. back to the board and grant him chairmanship of animation.   They bring in fresh blood, Eisner as CEO and Frank Wells as CFO.  The ""Disney Decade"" is christened.

1985 to 1994-  And rightfully so.  Under Wells' and Eisner's guidance, the company blossoms.  Roy once again champions animation technology and it begins to manifest in <u>The Great Mouse Detective</u>.   A chain of movies follows and each tops the next in quality and box office returns.  <u>The Little Mermaid</u>, <u>Beauty and the Beast</u>, <u>Aladdin</u>, and <u>The Lion King</u> prove that Disney has hit its second golden age.  New theme parks pop up.  The Disney Channel is premium.  The Disney Store opens in a few select cities and a gigantic success.  Touchstone pictures explodes into being with Who Framed Roger Rabbit.  Disney acquires ABC and brings back Disney programming on Sunday nights.  Disney parents Miramax, which tops the Oscars year after year.  Starting with <u>Toy Story</u>, Disney distributes Pixar's films, and every one is a success.

1994- Frank Wells dies in a helicopter accident.  <u>The Return of Jafar</u>, the first direct-to-video sequel, is released, thus issuing in the Disney Oversaturation Decade.  Less with the focus on long-term branding and creative quality, more with the focus on the short-term Benjamins.  More theme parks open; EuroDisney is a ridiculous flop until it is re-envisioned by Stephan Burke, who soon thereafter departs for Comcast.  More Disney stores pop up with less interesting merchandise.  Disney allows licensing through Sears, Wal-Mart, and half a billion other stores.  More than one Disney movie is released per year and they're not as sharp as they used to be-- or as popular.  When ABC discovers the popularity of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire,"" they put it on every single night.   

Late 90s-  Paul Pressler of the Disney Store chain takes the reigns over theme parks and brings along Cynthia Harris and former military man T. Irby. None have theme park experience.  They de-prioritize rides and emphasize retail.  Attractions and maintenance budgets are chopped, leaving some things dirty and some things unsafe.  Eisner is overheard calling park cast members ""overpaid carnies.""  Online communities buzz with indignation.

2000- Disney's California Adventure opens.  As described by Roy recently, it is built ""on the cheap.""  The back of the park features rides straight off the midway catalogue, supposed themed as a boardwalk.  Superstar Limo closes within a year thanks to the ridiculously low quality and the amount of guest complaints.  A huge amount of daily gate comes from annual passholders.  Online communities buzz with indignation.

2001- Eisner's bonus is reportedly out of whack with what the company earned.  Business analysts begin to question his worth.

Summer 2002- <u>Lilo and Stitch</u> is released.  The second product of the Feature Animation Florida team, it is received well but not on a Lion King scale.  Buzz begins about the closing of the Florida team.  Online communities buzz with indignation.

Winter 2002- For all of the time and money put into the development, the Feature Animation Burbank's <u>Treasure Planet</u> is a financial and critical flop.  Later, the company pales next to the work of former-Dis-animator-turned-entrepreneur John Lasseter and his <u>Finding Nemo</u>.  It's the last straw.  Things look bad for the Mouse.  Online communities buzz with indignation.

Summer 2003- Ride malfunction ends in the death of a Big Thunder rider at Disneyland.  The press talks about how the chopped maintenance budget is related.  

Winter 2003- Feature animation Florida (the financially successful team, not the less-successful Burbank) is closed.  They claim that they want to centralize the process, even though much of the team is laid off.  All traditionally-animated features after <u>Home on the Range</u> are canceled.  Disney boasts that all further animated projects will be CGI, despite the fact that their only CGI film (and <u>Dinosaur</u> was partially CGI, at that) was a major flop, and their partnership with separate studio Pixar is on publicly shaky ground.  Online communities buzz with indignation.

December 2003- A new Board rule is put in place, setting an age limit for its members.  Before it takes effect for him, Roy E. publicly leaves the Disney Board of Directors; makes a big fuss about how the company has turned away from its roots.  Roy creates savedisney.com and begins to buzz with indignation.

January 2004-  Negotiations between Pixar and Disney halt.  It is, supposedly, abrupt.

February 2004- Comcast announces its plans to buy Disney by hostile takeover.  Other companies, including Time Warner, are reportedly also considering a purchase.

What now?  Is it possible that, as last time, Roy Disney is in league with other entities to oust and replace the management?  Will Disney swallow another poison pill?  Will others swoop in to salvage or   The rumor mill is working overtime.

If Comcast is to take over, there is a possibility that it wouldn't be terrible.  They are saying the same sorts of things that Roy says about the declining quality of the company.  If they slot in Stephan Burke, he might take the care with the company that it needs if it is to return to salad days.  On the flip side, they are strictly a distribution company, and their interest is probably chiefly in Disney's cable attributes-- the Disney channel, ABC Family, and undoubtedly ESPN.  There is a definite possibility that this acquisition will destroy whatever ""magic"" the company has left.  

If a company like Warner snatches Disney, the outcome is similarly uncertain.  Will they merge properties together and destroy the brand continuity?  Will they allow Disney to function on its own?  And who will chair?  Great potential and great potential for floundering exists in this scenario.

Personally, I'd prefer this all to happen like last time.  I'd rather another investor save damsel Disney-in-distress, oust the obviously past-his-prime Eisner and replace him with a stronger option.  Maybe Steve Jobs-- though I doubt he would depart from Apple (unless, say, there were an Apple-Disney merger.)  Maybe Stephan Burke, without the Comcast corp.  Maybe someone else.   Anyway,  I suspect it's a giant mud-wrestle in Burbank, and  I am anxious to see in which direction this will goes.  I am hoping for a change for the better.  After all, the five-year-old in my heart has been personally invested in Disney for twenty years."

I have strep throat.  I hurt.  I can't swallow very well.

Medicine, even generic, is expensive.  Perhaps I should have lived fast and died young a la James Dean so as to avoid both the price of covering my own medical expenses as well as the single-girl-must-nurse-herself-when-sick phenomenon.  

I can't take a sick day.  I lose a week of vacation next year if I take a single one without 48 hours of warning.  I can't lose a week of vacation next year.  It's already slated for The Witching Hour.

I have plans this weekend.  I can't <i>rest,</i> stupid doctor.

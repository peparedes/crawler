"event","For a couple of weeks now, Grandpa has been very ill, with the family going to visit him daily. Due to work, I only got to visit him yesterday. We were all worried about him because he was not getting any better, and Mom wanted to be there with him as much as he could in case he'd pass away. 

A little ago, I'd say 15 to 25 minutes, we got the call that Grandpa passed away. It hit us hard, but especially Mom. She's destroyed, she wanted to be there with him, and was in fact getting ready to go visit him. Grandma died when I was four years old, Grandpa died today, now both Mom's parents are gone. And I only have my Grandma from Dad's side left. I also decided not to open the bar during this weekend."

"event","I know most people I know left LJ, but I guess I'll still post here. Almost two weeks ago, Grandpa, my mom's dad, was not feeling well, so he was taken to the hospital. He started feeling bad pains, and the doctors couldn't figure them out. Turns out they have found out he has some broken bones, we don't know how it happened. Mom hasn't told me which bones they are, but I suspect they may be on his spine.

Just tonight, Mom told  me that while trying to find proper ways to treating the broken bones, Grandpa's  condition has gotten worse, mostly because not just the broken bones, but also he's 89 years old and a heavy smoker all his life, to the point that when he was diagnosed with lung cancer when I was still a kid, he never even attempted to quit smoking.  He's developed pneumonia now, I believe he has water in his lungs and stuff too, and he is in constant pain. 

Mom has not told me anything else in regards to what's going on with him, but she told me tonight that it seems all the doctors can do now is try to ease his pain as best as they can and wait for him to pass away. She's very affected by this, and I'm feeling the weight of it too."

"event","Today, I discovered that my cat's baby kittens have finally opened their eyes when one poked its head out of the hidey hole my cat's had them in since she gave birth. But, I have not seen my cat since this afternoon. Yeah, it's only been a couple hours, and she's wandered off before, but I don't like the idea of her wandering far mpw.

You may remember how, a little over a year ago, my other female cat had died shortly after giving birth and I had to become the dad for the kittens. It was a very stressful time, caring for those kittens, it's extremely difficult. Feeding them and helping them pee and poo several times a day, even very late at night, between midnight and 6:00 AM. And then three died of illness, making me go through depression. Though it is rewarding to get to see the kitten that did pull through. He lives with my aunt and has gotten all big and so playful.

I am now waiting some hours. If my cat is not back by midnight, I will find myself forced to go to Wal-Mart to buy the baby bottle and the very expensive kitten formula. That's gonna piss off my mother, but I don't care if she gets pissed off. If something bad has happened to their mom, I am not letting these kittens starve to death. 

Unfortunately, it's almost 11:00 PM and she's still not back. I must leave soon and just pray that Wal-Mart has the mother's milk formula, baby bottle, and the first aid gauze I need to help stimulate then into peeing and pooping. If so, I do hope my cat returns eventually, maybe she wandered too far and is just not back yet. If not, then I need to become kitten dad again. Not something I look forward to, but I cannot let those kittens die of starvation or cold.


ETA- Still no sign of my cat anywhere. I was also unable to find the baby bottle and mother's milk formula anywhere, Wal-Mart is carrying them no longer. The employee who helped me check felt bad about not having the product and wished he could have helped me. My only option right now is to get up as early as possible to stock up for my bar and go to the pet store and veterinarian (who closes at noon), they always do have what I need right now. The kittens are warm in their hidey hole, but their occasional loud mewls of hunger feel like I'm getting punched in the chest, hard. It just hurts me a lot to be unable to help them for the moment.

Though my mother and I are currently not speaking to each other. As I expected, she does not like the situation one bit, but our exchange right after I got back from Wal-Mart just crossed the line:

Mom- ""You're acting so crazy about those cats that it's just ridiculous. I know you feel bad, but some situations can be solved and some can't, so you have to deal with it.""
Me- ""Really now? Well, see, this situation does have a possible solution, and that's me. And if you don't like it, then don't help me, I'll deal with this situation and try to solve it my own damn self!""

That's how it went, just louder. I know Mom hates cats, and I know she hates me spending so much money on the mother's milk formula. But for her to even hint at me just letting these kittens starve to death is just about the lowest I've ever seen my mother go on anything. I'm pissed at heer, don't wanna talk to her or even see her. I will bust my ass to try to help these kittens survive, and I do not give a shit what my mother says or even thinks about it."

"event","For starters, yup, I'm still around. Sorry for not posting here more often.

Yeah, I just got home from the theater after seeing ""The Avengers"", first time I go since September of 2009, bumped into my friends there and even Dad decided to tag along he ain't been to the movies since Jet Li's Kiss of the Dragon. Plus getting to pay only $3.50 a ticket and smuggling in my own snacks was satisfying. And, well, I think I creamed my pants while watching the movie. Several times. And not just me, the whole audience had a fucking blast.

This movie rocked my fucking socks off and blew them right through the wall. Perfection. Yes, absolute perfection. I'm the guy who will find even the slightest bit of negative in everything you put in front of me, and I could find absolutely nothing negative to say about this. This movie was fucking amazing! The way the story is set up is superb, the acting is excellent by the whole entire cast, the characters all get their chance to shine, even minor ones like Maria Hill. The main actors were all in tiptop shape, and my gosh, everybody just oozed charisma and charm. You get the superhero feel, the action and reactions, and now I really, truly understand what non-spoiler early reviews said when mentioning that Hulk really stole the show, because every moment where the Hulk himself is onscreen is just golden.

The action! Oh, God, the action! There's not that much action at first, but the fight scenes are good, and once the final conflict starts, it's a nonstop rollercoaster ride of pure, unadultered amazingness! There is the ocassional bit of shaky cam, but you can actually tell what is going on! The adrenaline rush you get from this will blow your mind and will leave you on the edge of your seat, pumped like hell. And the humor! My God, the humor was actually, genuinely funny. The lines of dialogue were witty and smart and got some good laughs, the more physical things were also great, the standout being during the final fight when I'm not gonna spoil it for you but I know you'll now what I mean when you see it, the theater was laughing like mad for a good long while after it. The sequel hook during the credits was probably the one small bit I didn't much like. I geeked out, of course, but still seems too big and too soon.

Ultimately, this is it. As a person who buys and enjoys comic books (and as a fan of The Avengers as it is), this is the pinacle, the epitome of comic book movies and superhero movies. This is what superhero/comic book movies are all about, you cannot possibly get any better than this, it cannot be done. Even people who don't read comic books, like my father and friends, will have a blast with this movie. And because this is me talking, I can't go without snarkily belittling something, so to the Batman movies and their ""edginess, darkness and grittiness"", I give you a big fat FUCK YOU! The Avengers is where it's at! Oh, gosh, I already wanna go see it again!

Okay, I think I need a cold shower, I'm still too energetic and pumped from the experience. Funny thing is I feel filthy in a way, having enjoyed something so thoroughly and finding it 100% positive, when it was made by that fucking moron Joss Whedon, whom I dislike quite a bit. But I guess if there was ever one single thing that an asshole could do that was completely awesome, I'm glad it was this. Kudos to you, Joss Whedon, for achieving a true shining star of perfection amidst the shit you normally spew out. Cheers!"

"event","I have been sighing a lot these past couple days. You all know what a crazy-ass, irresponsible idiot my sister is. Lately my car has been a bit wonky, so you gotta drive it rather slowly. I have no problem with it, I am a very careful driver. My sister, though, loves speed. Thursday night, she decides to go out, and we warned her of two things. One, don't come home late, and two, drive SLOWLY! She says she's just going out for dinner. Two hours later, she calls to say she's at a party, but will come back soon. She was coming back home after 2:00 AM, and I needed the car early morning, with gas, to run errands.

She was speeding. Stupid retard was driving like she was auditioning for the next sequel of the Fast & Furious franchise. She skidded in a curve, hard, and ended up smack dab with a tree. She called us to let us know. Overall, she's banged up and bruised, but okay, got out of the hospital after a few hours, came home where she's been lazing about all day. But the car? The car is fucked up. Bad. It crashed against a thin but sturdy tree so bad that the sunroof imploded into the car, and the entire front half of the car is now shaped like a boomerang, or a fortune cookie. I got no idea if insurance will handle this or not, but all I know is that the hospital bill and the possibility of fixing the car is way up in the thousands of dollars, about in-between 2,000 and 3,000, maybe higher. We barely make enough money to scrape by.

Mind you, I first asked about my sister. When I learned she was pretty much okay, yeah, my worries shifted solely to my car, and I am supremely pissed at her. Not talking to her, not even looking at her. Told her a million times not to drive like a fucking maniac in that car, and yet she does it anyway, it's like she wanted to wreck it on purpose. Just watch, soon as she gets better and gets her filthy clutches on Mom's car, she's gonna drive like a speed demon once again. Now I'm stuck at home except for the occasional chance my parents haven't taken the car early to grandpa's, which is pretty much a daily happening.

I'm telling you, my sister's gonna pay for this, one way or another."

"event","Lately, I just don't see movies much. Nothing jumps out at me to catch my attention and make me want to watch. ""Insidious"" was okay, but did not live up to expectations Everything else has just bored me. So for a long time I hear about ""Attack the Block"", even during the filming process, and it catches my attention. Basically, a gang of teenage thugs in South London kill a small alien creature just because they can, then more of its kind, bigger and deadlier, also crash in the area, and now the gang and other assorted characters from their neighborhood must fight and survive. It sounds simple, right? It is, and ultimately, that's the strong point.

I finally got my grubby paws on the movie, by less than legal means and some good contacts. Yes, I can be shady too. How many alien movies have there been lately, honestly? ""Battle Los Angeles"", ""Cowboys & Aliens"", ""Skyline"", ""Transformers 3"", ""Super 8"", amongst others. And ""Attack the Block"", well, it's just on a league of it's own. All those other movies can go shove an overly bloated cactus up their collective Hollywood asses. This movie is where it's at. 

Seriously, once that movie is out on DVD and you got a chance to watch it, then fucking do it. Go, run, grab it, watch it. I loved this movie, easily the best movie I have seen in ages. It's not even an hour and a half long, so that means that you never get bored. It's low budget yet very well directed, it moves fast and never lets go, even in the slower parts with the talking. The acting is good all over, especially impressive in that most of these actors are unknowns, and for some, this is their first acting role (the exception being Nick Frost from ""Shaun of the Dead""). The movie is very British, though, so a lot of slang is used and is at times a bit difficult to understand, but I'd say an extra viewing or two and problem solved, you learn to make sense of it.

Acting-wise now. The main character, Moses, played by newcomer John Boyega, takes the show with his charisma and presence, and the other four boys all have their own distinct personalities. Sam, the nurse that the boys mug early in the film, does well too, the boys' female teen friends don't appear much but are good too. The stoner guy is funny in his own way, the little kids trying to prove they're tough too are also fun (and sometimes steal the show), even the human villain in the movie has his good moments. I'd say the only character who's kind of boring is Ron (played by Nick Frost), the local weed dealer, but his role is basically just a cameo and does not detract from the film.

And the aliens? Loved them! As the characters call them, ""big gorilla-wolf motherfuckers"". They are sorta built like gorillas, or like the character Wildutt from Ben 10. They run on all fours, have no eyes, are fuzzy and black as the space they come from, invisible in the dark, except for the many, many rows of sharp teeth that glow in the dark. Minimal CGI was clearly used, but it's not overblown blobs of turds like ""Cloverfield"" and ""Super *"". And yes, there is some good gore in this movie due to the beasties, but not exaggerated. The alines were super original, fun, dangerous without being invincible, and the great direction in the movie makes these low budget beasties really work.

The movie is well acted, well directed, original, fast paced, it is its own thing. And the most iportant thing, it's fun and entertaining. Seriously, fuck ""Super 8"" and its innocent little 'bad things happen but you can still live' intellectual makes-you-think bullshit. This movie is anti-Spielberg. It is simply a low budget movie that does what the good old school movies we used to watch as kids are supposed to do, which is be fun and entertain us. Thank goodness to see a movie finally come along that makes me do that and totally enjoy it. This is the kind of movie you'd sit down with a load of snacks and watch in a marathon along with others such as ""Gremlins"" and ""Critters"", and just have a great time. Like I said, it is the movie's simplicity that really makes it strong.

Hell, I even wanted to do a video review of this movie and put it on Youtube but no camera right now, so gotta deal. Bottom line, my favorite movie in ages, I have not seen a movie that satisfied me so much since ""REC"". I absolutely recommend it to you all and hope you enjoy it as much as I did."

Dad knew, but did not bother to tell me or to make sure we're prepared against the hurricane, because dad is a stupid redneck and could' give less of a fuck. Also, because with Mom in the hospital for a full week, Dad and my sister took my bar's money and went on a motherfucking spending spree with it before I could stop them. I have never, ever seen the bar's money reserve this low, I don't even have enough to wipe my ass with. 

So unless I really sell out today at the bar, we'll have no money for even last minute preparations. We are literally flly unprepared for this hurricane, made even worse by us living in a mountain area, where we can be incomunicated with the rest of the world for who knows how long, what with ruined roads, fallen trees and power lines. We have no flashlights, no water reserves, no canned food or crackers or anything edible, no gas for our emergency generator or our portable little stove, no coverings for our windows. Nothing. Because of my father, we're going into this hurricane unprepared and unprotected.

The more time passed and I learned more, the more interested I got, so I looked forward to it a lot. It's a low-budget action/adventure movie with sprinkles of horror and humor, made by the dudes who did ""Shaun of the Dead"", and it even has the fat guy from it in a supporting role.

What's it about? Savage aliens fall from the skies into a London neighborhood, and a gang of young hoodlums, as well as other assorted characters, must survive the night and defend themselves against these creatures. Reviews have been super positive, some people like it even more than the beloved ""Super 8"" (which I admit I'm not even interested in seeing). Shame it was only released in very few movie theaters in the U.S very recently, just eight theaters, with six more coming in August 19. I hate having to wait for it on DVD, but when it comes and if I like it, I will buy it! Here's the trailer for it:

I'm always hitting myself, stumbling, tripping, being hit by stuff, dropping things, etc. So imagine my surprise when I'm driving home late at night, rainy too, and right as I'm crossing an intersection, my instincts suddenly scream at me to stop. Not a second later, this asshole runs the red light, swerves and skids on the wet road, honking his horn and almost crashing, both into me and against a light post. Had I not hit the breaks when I did, I would've been slammed by it, right on the driver's side.

Maybe my having to raise Shadow and his siblings made their cat reflexes seep into me? XD

And speaking of, I dropped by my aunt's yesterday cause I had not seen Shadow since I left him there. My aunt stepped out, and I could not find Shadow, when suddenly out of nowhere, he's on my leg all gnawing at me like he always did here, all after my feet and sandals. My gosh, is he growing like a weed! I sit on the floor, he immediately jumps on my lap, meowing happily and purring and rubbing up against me and begging for a lot of petting, like he always used to. My aunt gets there and says he's being all extra energetic, and as he starts playing with my fingers all grabby, nommy, pouncy, kicky, mewly, like he always used to, I get giddy at realizing my baby remembers his daddy. Yeah, that so made my day. I got to find a camera soon to snap a few shots. ^_^"

Shadow has grown into a healthy, playful kitty who now eats, drinks and goes potty all by himself, loves scampering around, climbing atop me, using my fingers as toys and destroying sandals. So, it was about the right time to take him to his new home, my aunt's house. She adores animals and I know she can take good care of him.

Shadow was suprisingly calm during the car trip, bu got spooked around new surroundings at my aunt's house, who was just positively delighted over how cute Shadow is. About 20 minutes later, hadow's scampering around like he owns the place. Dishes full of kitty food and water, new litterbox, toys, everybody all in love with him. He was totally happy and felt right at home now.

So, it has been a long process, and a painful one, mainly when Shadow's siblings died. But seeing him now all happy at my aunt's house, I feel good that I raised him right, and I know he'll be fine. Just gotta make sure to visit him whenever possible. And much as he got on my nerves and annoyed me and destroyed my hands and feet with his claws, I already miss the little guy."

I knew he was dying, he could barely breathe, his mewls were weak, he couldn't barely move, his eyes were barely open. I couldn't do anything, only hold him, stroke him and pet him until he died.

It's just Shadow left now. He's still healthy, stays clean, pees and poops properly, eats well (I'll start feeding him a tad less because he's gotten quite chubby). He's still very loud and craves attention, but that lets me know he's energetic and staying healthy. Only thing is, I can tell he's scared about being alone now, no siblings, just me. I'll do my best to see he makes it through okay, and I think he's almost ready to eat solids too. I'll buy him kitten food asap, see if he's ready to try it out. My aunt said that as soon as he starts eating solids, I can take him to her, and I know he'll be a lot better off at her house than at mine.

I'll do my best to keep Shadow as healthy and happy as possible in the short time left till I can give him to my aunt. I'm already depressed enough that three out of the four babies have died, one of them while I held him. I don't want to think how I'd feel if something bad happens to Shadow too."

She was a little down last night, not as energetic as usual, and didn't drink as much milk as her siblings did. When I go check on them this morning and give them their breakfast, I find her dead. And what scares me even more is that now Moo seems to be feeling a little down too, only Shadow is still a sparkplug of untamed energy. I feel horrible about two of my babies dying, I can only hope Moo starts to perk back up."

Okay, so my camera has been on the fritz for a while now. I tried making a more adequate video and it all screwed up. So I decided to make a short video to introduce you all to my babies, the little tykes that are just totally eating up my time. There's a reason we all look so unkempt in the video. I had not showered and need to go to the barbershop. The kittens have a more valid excuse that they were playing around and got a bit dirty, so I had to clean them up a bit. Anyway, hope you like it, and I hope to have a better video in the future! Or at least one where I don't look like a bum. XD"

Last night I tended to them and left them to sleep nice and calm and warm. This morning, I find Shade, the firstborn and biggest of the lot, very weak, tipsy, he barely ate and his poop came out a strange, pale color. I've checked on them multiple times, and now just found Shade dead. He looked calm, like he was just sleeping.

What did I do wrong? What could I have done to prevent him dying? I don't think I'll ever get an appropriate answer. Now I'm distressed over the same thing happening to the remaining three. I don't want my babies to die, especially not when I'm trying my hardest to care for them so they can grow big and healthy."

"event","Okay, so it's been a few days since I began my newfound duty of substitute papa cat. And, well, I think my sanity may be slipping.

I now feel sympathy for every person who's ever been a parent, because this is so fucking hard and stressful. I'm getting little to no sleep, I'm stressed out and snappy, and I actually hear the kittens even when they're not there, that's how drilled into my brain they are. These four are so difficult to deal with that they are driving me insane. Feeding them, helping them to pee and poop, it all takes me a process of over one hour. Over one hour, people, several times a day, combined with all my other responsibilities in my bar and the house! Made even worse by the fact that nobody helps me, they just ignore the situation, or complain, or make useless comments!

There are three males and one female, the female being clearly the youngest, and also the single most difficult one of the lot. She will not sit still, she's hyperactive and climbs incredibly fast over anything, and for some reason, she hates the nipple of the bottle. Absolutely hates it, she will stop suckling milk to suckle on my finger. Her is the one who takes the longest time to feed, it can take me a good 20 to 30 minutes in feeding her enough. One of the males, black and white in color, is also difficult and takes a long time in that he almost always chokes on the milk, multiple times, and I have to stroke and soothe him till he stoops coughing enough to drink again.

I named them all, actually. Two males are entirely black, so I named the slimmer one Shadow, and the tubbier one Shade. The black and white one I called Moo, due to his colors and his enjoyment of milk to the point of choking on it almost every goddamn time he drinks. As for the mix-color female (black and white and blond-ish) I named Teeny, because her behavior she reminds of all those teeny bopper celebrities that are so fucked up.

The worst parts of this are, for starters, the cleaning part, as in helping them pee and poo. I must stimulate them with a damp, warm paper towel or cotton ball, meaning that all their waste land on my hands and drive my OCD into overdrive, making me very distressed. Add to that that they squirm, twist, turn and scratch me. And yeah, did I mention that I am allergic to cat scratches and they scratch and dig their claws into me over everything, even during feeding, and I have no gloves? But the all-out absolute worst part? The kitty milk formula is very expensive. The least expensive I've managed to find one can is $4.69, and they blow through it in just two or three days.

The one thing I give myself credit for is for not losing my patience with the kittens, I still treat them as tenderly and fatherly as can be, even though I'm stressed and depressed at the time, but what's happening is not their fault, nor is their behavior, since it's just nature. I don't know how I'll manage to find the money to last me to buy all those cans till they can eat solid food, because right now they don't even have teeth yet, so that's my biggest worry.

I truly look forward to the day they can finally eat solid food and pee and poop themselves. Already a friend of the family has expressed interest in taking one or two for him and his wife who just moved into a new house and want a new pet, and he says he wants at least a female. Considering I have only one female amongst the kittens now that Mama is gone, that would be the exact thing I need. No more female cats constantly getting pregnant and giving birth, just male cats whom I don't have to worry about producing more kittens for me to take care of. No more female cats for me, it's decided.

Really, why did it have to be four kittens? Had Mama given birth to just one or two, this would've been so much easier and far less stressful. But four? This is just not healthy for me..."

Just gone, like the earth swallowed her. dad hasn't seen her when he goes up the mountainside, no neighbor has seen her, she's not along the road so we know a car didn't hit her. She just disappeared. And believe me, I'm crushed.

But then there's her four kittens. Today marks two weeks since they were born. The poor things have barely begun opening their eyes, and they're yowling for their mommy to come feed them and help them pee. So, today while running many errands, I bought a can of formula, a feeding bottle and headed home. I fed the yowling little ones and then stimulated them to help them pee. One of them didn't drink much but peed a lot, so I knew it was backed up (I think she's a girl), whereas the others didn't pee much but ate plenty.

I know I can do better as Mr. Mom, so I'll consult with an aunt of mine who's had a lot of experienced in this and has raised kittens and puppies since birth. She can't take them out of my hands but she promised to help me. Also, I'll try to get some pictures taken if I can fix my computer's camera. 

I'll raise my babies to the best of my abilities. Just need a bit of a rest, then right back to mommy duties. Or, actually, I'm gonna call them daddy duties, and hope they grow big and healthy thanks to daddy."

"event","You all remember me mentioning some time ago a movie titled ""Cementerio del Terror"" (Cemetery of Terror)? It was made in 1985 in Mexico, with an extremely low budget, and it's a mix-match of slasher, haunted house, supernatural and zombie. This is the plot: The police gun down a serial killer, and the psychologist who tended to him wants the body cremated because he knows the killer practiced dark magic and was a devil worshipper. Three college students trick their girlfriends to a party in an abandone house next to a graveyard (guess who it belonged to?), find a black magic book (guess whose book it is?) and spook the girls by stealing a body to do a black mass. Guess whose body they steal? So, as the killer is revived and stalks the college students, the doctor searches for the missing killer, and a group of young kids who were supposed to be trick-or-treating (the movie takes place on halloween night) head into the graveyard for a dare, and hijinks ensue.

The movie is extremely low budget and it shows, but it takes itself seriously nevertheless, you can tell the director has a love for good, old-fashioned low budget horror. The acting ranks from average to downright pitiful (the youngest child can sometimes be seen just standing around as if waiting for his cue), which is to be expected. Most of the budget seems to have gone into the zombie make-up and the actually quite well done gore effects, but sadly, this version is not the unrated version, so the juiciest bits are cut (always to a shot of the full moon), though at least they let us see the corpses afterwards. It's quite an old movie, and considering the low budget and place of origin, it's very difficult to find (and the few that have subtitles, from what I saw, the translation is mediocre). The fact that it's old means the picture is not super perfect HD clear, so it looks as though you had gone to a corner video store and rented an 80's horror movie in VCR, which I personally quite like, nice nostalgic touch. It's not what I'd call a great movie, and yet for some reason all that mix-match of stuff got on my good side, always kept me entertained, and this turned into one of my favorite movies to watch on Halloween.

The movie is, of course, in Spanish, but I decided to make the English subtitles for it myself. Did it some time ago, took me a whole week, but got them done. And finally, my friend found a system to embed the subtitles into the movie, and it worked, already checked. They're not perfect, but they're pretty darn good for a first time try, if I do say so myself, and I'm damn proud of myself! Now, I know I'm a little late with this, Halloween was a couple days ago, but still, if any of you want to check it out, here you have it, and I hope you enjoy it. Let me know if you did, okay?

And thanks to my retarded, useless piece of redneck trash of a father and my now hysterical mother, wer are just about entirely unprepared for it. We have a generator, but no windows were boarded up, we barely got supplies, we live in this absolutely dangerous area. No wonder my mother is hysterical, but her being in that state does not help at all. 

Simply put, while I was working my ass off in the store all weekend and using the night to run errands, my parents could've been themselves busy by preparing for this, but noooooo, they spent all day talking to friends that came to the store and all night playing bingo, the entire weekend. Fucking useless! Mom's chattering worriedly nonstop, Dad's all ""nothing's gonna happen"", and they're sending me to tend to customers wanting alcohol during this weather!

So, yeah. A hurricane's coming, and because of my useless parents, I know something bad's gonna happen. I'm very worried, very scared, and now it's likely to late to leave this place. The power's going on and off already as it is, I'm just taking an opportunity that we have some right now to post this and let you guys know. If we get through this, believe me, everything bad that happens I will blame my parents for it, I don't give a fucking damn. 

Well, I'm about to go through a hurricane, all unprepared. I'm trying to remain as positive as possible, but I'm almost certain something bad will happen. Some destruction to our property, probably days without electricity and phone, fallen trees, floods, fallen power lines, land slides, rock slides, roads destroyed and leaving us stranded and cut off from the rest of the world. It might be days before you get to hear from me again (and I am so not adding an 'if' there). Wish me luck, everybody. I really, really will need it."

I have never passed a hurricane or storm up here in this house, but considering I've seen before how it can get when we took Grandma out of this house andd to our house last time a hurricane came, I do NOT want to be here when the storm hits. I want to make sure my comics won't get wet, for starters, and then be somewhere else, because a mud slide, rock slide or broken road, combined with any fallen trees and the flooded river, will cause us to be trapped up here for an indefinite amount of time, and I don't want that.

Recently I had been having trouble with my supervisor in the census because I was given an area with several houses that were impossible to find. As in, the houses have no point on the map, no adddress, no owner's name, and descriptions as thorough as ""wooden house"", and somehow I was expected to find these specific, non-existant houses amongst hundreds in the very big area that could take hours to fully explore, and which I did explore throoughly for over a week.

I also committed two small mistakes. One, I wrote with pen in a paper that was supposed to be written in pencil, a mistake nearly every single of my co-workers committed. I also accidentally forgot some papers at home one day. Somehow, my strict, demeaning,fatass bitch of a supervisor somehow embellished this whoile slew of comments about me not doing my job right, ""losing"" importtant papers (they were at home!), and how I'm ""visibly stressed and does not seem to want to do the job"" (how many times must I repeat, the houses cannot be found or simply don't exist?). All these contributed to her boss telling her to fire me.

I don't remember last time I was this furious. I almost blew up at my supervisor, but somehow contaiend myself to only slapping my job materials onto the table, telling her ""thanks for friggin' nothing"" andd walking away. 20 minutes later, I learn that her boss is, casually, the cousin of a very, very good friend of our family, who promised me that, even though I cannot be given my job back, she's really gonna prety much rip her cousin a new one for firing me without hearing my version of the events that transpired.

Right now I need a few days off for these stress levels to go down, which is not helped by the phone lines in my whole neighborhood accidentally being cut by some guys from the acueduct company drilling about, meaning who knows how long we'll all be without phone, and thus no internet either (I'm at a friend's house at the moment). Afterwards, I will fill out resumes and seek out a new job. I know I got my store to tend to, but right now money's tight and I was counting on this census job. How ironic, I went from being named the best employee they had from the first census draft two months ago, to the one screwed over by the bosses and fired over being unable to perform a task that was deemed impossible by everyone else."

Worst part? I just started my job, and it's as a census taker. Meaning? I can't afford to miss a single day, especially right now in the beginning, or I would be fired. Way things are now, I cannot afford to be fired, so it looks like I will have to go to work 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, out in the sun or rain, house to house, sick as I am. Not exactly the start I had in mind."

Thing is, I just got a call, and I've been hired as a census taker, so now that's two jobs I got, starting tomorrow. My sister might be hired as well, from what I heard, so at least that will keep that trouble-maker busy.

Believe me, I am so not looking forward to two jobs, but the extra money is very tempting, so I'll go for it."

The two black ones and the one mainly white with a little black are the boys, named Cinnamon, Nutmeg and Saffron respectively, whereas the other two, one mainly black with some white and the other black with rusty tones are Clove and Cayenne respectively. Oh, and that's their mom named Mama with them:

Now, I remember meeting him for the first time in a certain public chat place years ago, and the main reason I approached him in the first place and said hi was because I remembered his name from a certain picture I had seen before that that totally caught my attention, seeing as I really like sabretooth tigers and the picture was a great portrayal of one, in my opinion.

Then eventually, it seemed nobody had the picture anymore, and that everyone, myself included, kinda lost it in the long run amidst everything. So imagine my surprise when, digging through old stuff, I actually found that picture. Looking at it got me feeling so nostalgic in a good way that I though, what the hell, put it up so folks can see it again. Just don't forget to save it this time. lol

Thank you for this fab-tacular livejournal~ It's beoooo.ti.ful my darlings.<br /><br />I always feel a bit&nbsp;overwhelmed making 'firsts' - this will be the first smudge on this lovely, clean, engaging journal (I apologise in advance).&nbsp;<br /></font><br /><font color=""#00ccff"">First of all,</font> <font color=""#339966"" size=""5""><strong><u><font color=""#ff9900"">WELCOME BACK</font></u></strong><font size=""3""><font color=""#00ccff""> <font size=""2"">to all those who are back from overseas and</font></font> <font color=""#ff00ff"" size=""5""><strong><u>I MISS YOU</u></strong></font> </font><font color=""#00ccff"" size=""2"">to people who are not here yet. <strike>I never realised how much I depended on my friends until now. </strike>I mean, y'know, whatever~<br /></font></font><br /><font color=""#00ffff""><font color=""#00ccff"">Secondly, I feel as if the idea of 'journey' has never been more relevant than now. 'Two roads diverge in a yellow wood' (I'm just typing from memory here) (FINE, groan if you must ^__^) We are really at the first cross-road of many yet to come in our undoubtly long and illustrious lives. Sometimes the twists and turns in my own maze of a brain are sudden and completely unexpected but I hope it was the right choice.&nbsp;<br /><br />To all future economists, vets, doctors, lawyers, media monguls and very very successful friends, I hope your journeys will be anything BUT imaginary.&nbsp;<br /><br />Here's something for the pessimist in me:</font> </font><font color=""#00ff00""><em><font color=""#00ff00"" size=""2""><strong>Success is a journey, not a destination. So stop running.</strong><br /></font><br /></em></font><font color=""#00ccff"">This is the Melodramatic Rambling of Ron-Ron (Look Mummy! I can alliterate!!)<br />Roger, over and out.</font></p>"

killing syphilitic abercrombie mouse heads

eating none will get me nowhere!
how much for the crammed pot
if you smell then the cancer must be within you
tenderize your virginity and sometime the mouse will slide free
ugly pork rinds are devoured by the tiger i keep in my back yard
egrets slamming coasters into the ice of the past
how much for the dancing fairy doll?
if you wonder perhaps the cram school will be the answer
i see for once each piece of crud is inside me
don't you want my dance off you head

every camel toe means on more crushed dream
all i want is a heart to squeeze

its my opinion that everyone views energy differently.
sure they are seeing the same view, but from different perspectives.

so im curious..

how do you see energy?
what perception of it do you posess?

i suppose i put mine here..

at first to me energy was vague
i remember it clearly though, it was clear how vague it was
the only time i could see it was at night
it resembled tv fuzz. a static view
i remember the more drugs i did
the stronger the static became
it would become more intense, less deniable.

i use to be into indulging
taking to the extremes, against all odds
and still holding my conscious throughout it.
I never figured out how i did it.
i saw other people get straight lost , same dosage as i
i could see this static , that always kept me aware
i wasn't allowed to not see it.
it became so strong after such prolonged extended disillusionment of myelf
that often i looked at landscaped and did not see depth
it was like a flat screen made up of this static,
i could barely get the reception 

after a few years 
and millions of mind shifting experiences
things started becoming clearer
in the dark the static was holding still
but all the more vibrating intensely
the view started looking more like an infinite array of articulate diamonds
spread out in patterns 
each one shinning an electric spark light
that would flash in a synchronic multitude as chaotic outburst

then came the shrooms.
i had an abundance at my house for the time.
they were my babies
and i treated them like miniature universes into which i would pour
my energy based diamonds.
i cultivated them, extensively.
it came to me throughout this period that what i had been viewing all this time
was energy.
i could see it clearly.
it looked as if i, the viewer had an intense sunlit glare reflected from my eye
into a mirror, which in turn reflected into another mirror, an thus into another.
all positioned exactly to reflect from one another, like a web.
 i found control over this view, i could manipulate it causing complete hallucinations while sober.
 it was like connect the dots, the energy would cluster into form
causing complex patterns.
i would meditate on objects just to see how much i could alter it from its original sight.
one night, it was a panoramic view of trees, my vision was sucked inside out
the screen reversed.  (i heard shamans have used this technique, with shadows and light. reverse the depth so that the light takes shadow perspective, and shadow that of light protruding towards you)
 i died that night 
I was carried away in a spherical vision
i had never felt such clarity of mind, vision, energy.


i could concentrate at will at a singular node of energy, and magnify it. seeing something different in each.
at this time, i felt my body was very vital in this all.
the better i felt, the better this energy was about me.
it was my assumption that each spec of light was a universe within myself
and that the polarity of enlightenment went up
ie: each spec of light was to become enlightened and shine its fullest before
 i could become enlightened,  just as all the people in the world would have to have the same general insight of enlightenment for the world to become so. 
so i worked on cleansing my mind, body, and spirit of things.
i worked on unifying each into a whole body of light.
when meditating on this with eyes open 
(i seem to meditate much easier with my eyes open, i can relax my vision completely. sometimes to the extent where both my eyes would go strait instead of crossing into the middle of a point and i would see double of everything.
my brain sides pulse through my eye balls. i can feel them pulse. they communicate through each other, and when i meditate they pulse in a harmonic tone simultaneously.)
my vision melted away, like the film on a screen melts into a golden gleam and then a flickering white.
my thoughts had burnt out. there was nothing running through the projector
just completely white aura bright flashing white.
i had found silence in my conscious.

then for the first time, color was added 
everything before this had been black and white.
i accidentally rubbed my eyes while meditating. (eyes open)
which before i was so keen on not disrupting my meditation i wouldn't have bothered.
my vision exploded into an endless array of colors.
i learned how to stimulate these receptors 
and the energy became alive with vibrant color.
the gleaming white now shone off a hue of metallic plasma
morphing, mainly reds, blues, greens, purples. it was all the colors at once.
but when i would actually look, it would singularize them into a momentary color.
the white energy become a golden white. with all the colors possible enthroned within its magma core.

the next meditation was in miami.
the whole time i was in florida i felt a very very strong energy
its my opinion that the landscape holds pockets of energy within valleys and structures. wind plays a huge part in circulation.
 in florida , its completely flat. an the energies constantly being refreshed from vast oceans.
this meditation was in water. 
i put on snorkel gear went out into the water
thanked the water for being, by graciously playing in its desire.
i floated out where it was deep and you couldn't see the bottom.
the view was a sea green of immense value, the suns light was shinning through it.
illuminating the secrets this mass held.
i meditated, eyes open. energy quickly stood attention to me.
but was quickly grasped out of my reigns.
it was chaotic in nature, fluid in motion, and endless in view.
i was viewing the all,
the vast expanse from which we come, and to which we go.
energy was spewing out from all sides, and being sucked into the middle
it was a beautiful sight, the patterns that came out where equal to that which came in only in value. each was as great as the last,and next.
so it was like finding a black whole
a portal.

so now, its quite the opposite from before.
instead of viewing the energy,
its viewing me.
it constantly regenerated me, never leaving my attention span.
i have shifted through the dense mass that it started as 
to find the gleaming weightlessness of a singular spark
for in that spark, is the view off all time condensed into no time.
a singular point expanding, and collapsing into and without itself at one moment.

imagine this funny story
 if you have past lives,
 then you surely will have future ones
 for if your still holding onto them through your new self
 then this is not the life to give you the freedom.
   if there is no time,
 then there has to be time at moments 
 maybe when you perceive it as so at a singular moment expanded into a whole moment.
so,   theoretically. if you have past, and future self's.
 neither is the other. there all separate. held together by one soul
a nd there is no time condensed over the mass of perceptional time.
then all of these self's, and beings of this soul would happen at that same moment of condensed, no time.
it would be an intensely bright flash, a spark of a sort.
and then all these self's, all these beings, would be the one soul, at one moment. 
just being.

    heh. that one always makes me feel funny.
what's odd to me is that this has always been with me, and always will.
it was only my self that was ignoring it for what was thought to be more important.
until i realized the importance of this cosmic dance.
i mean after all.  we embody the cosmos while we dance.

*flash*

how do you see energy?"

"event","i thought this post was a good one to share.

its called ""analyze swami and win big bucks""

hahahaha 

things like this make me smile so big
everyones doing there parts

so ill do mine

*hugs swami*


since everyones seems so keen on opinions.
it was fathomed that the merge between science and mysticism isnt really that far apart.
the scientist, exhibit theory and fact into science based laws that are always exspanding. as a practice, a way of learning ,collecting, and being.
the mystics, share passionately their essence of being with one another.
they use intuition to guide them on the principles of awe and wonder, but still follow a path. be it from moment to moment , even a convinced or earned silent presence. its a way of practice, a way of learning, collecting, and being. 

with that being said,
the termonolgy between the two is like the wind trying to talk with a stone.
i see them talking about the same things.
just in diferent symbols, patterns of thought, and termonology.

the only thing each should learn is to follow a path of love.
a passion for what they do, and who they are.
one that has a good outcome for the bearer and the people who recieve the products of anothers mind.

we all learn, why would you have negative thoughts directed towards another?
even a religious person. a person who devoutly follows whats handed to him.
weve all followed before what weve been given, your not really given a choice.
if you were to hear an infant cry
would you hurt the poor creature?
youd likely chalk it up to the nature of being an infant.
and know that one day, he too will stand in your shoes. hearing an infant cry.
we were all infants before..

share only love with people. through a love devoted towards helping, either through science, mysticism, religion, or pholosophy.

	Why did the chicken cross the road? 
	To get to the other side!


How famous people might answer that:


QUESTION:
--------
  Why did the chicken cross the road?


Answers:
--------
 Pat Buchanan:
  To steal a job from a decent, hard-working American.

 Machiavelli:
  The point is that the chicken crossed the road.  Who cares why?
  The ends of crossing the road justify whatever motive there was.

 Thomas de Torquemada:
  Give me ten minutes with the chicken and I'll find out.

 Timothy Leary:
  Because that's the only kind of trip the Establishment would let it
  take.

 Carl Jung:
  The confluence of events in the cultural gestalt necessitated that
  individual chickens cross roads.  This brought such occurrences
  into being.

 John Locke:
  Because he was exercising his natural right to liberty.

 Albert Camus:
  It doesn't matter; the chicken's actions have no meaning except to
  him.

 The Bible:
  And God came down from the heavens, and He said unto the chicken,
  ""Thou shalt cross the road."" And the Chicken crossed the road, and
  there was much rejoicing.

 Fox Mulder:
  It was a government conspiracy.

 Freud:
  The fact that you thought that the chicken crossed the road reveals
  your underlying sexual insecurity.

 Darwin:
  Chickens, over great periods of time, have been naturally selected
  in such a way that they are now genetically predisposed to cross
  roads

 Darwin #2:
  It was the logical next step after coming down from the trees.

 Richard M. Nixon:
  The chicken did not cross the road.
  I repeat, the chicken did not cross the road.

 Oliver Stone:
  The question is not ""Why did the chicken cross the road?"" but is
  rather ""Who was crossing the road at the same time whom we
  overlooked in our haste to observe the chicken crossing?""

 Jerry Seinfeld:
  Why does anyone cross a road? I mean, why doesn't anyone ever think
  to ask, ""What the heck was this chicken doing walking around all
  over the place anyway?""

 Martin Luther King, Jr.:
  I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads
  without having their motives called into question.

 Immanuel Kant:
  The chicken, being an autonomous being, chose to cross the road of
  his own free will.

 Grandpa:
  In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road.  Someone
  told us that the chicken had crossed the road, and that was good
  enough for us.

 Dirk Gently (Holistic Detective):
  I'm not exactly sure why, but right now I've got a horse in my
  bathroom.

 Bill Gates:
  I have just released the new Chicken 2000, which will both cross
  roads AND balance your checkbook, though when it divides 3 by 2 it
  gets 1.4999999999.

 M.C.Escher:
  That depends on which plane of reality the chicken was on at the
  time.

 George Orwell:
  Because the government had fooled him into thinking that he was
  crossing the road of his own free will, when he was really only
  serving their interests.

 Colonel Sanders:
  I missed one?

 Plato:
  For the greater good.

 Aristotle:
  To actualize its potential.

 Karl Marx:
  It was a historical inevitability.

 Nietzsche:
  Because if you gaze too long across the Road, the Road gazes also
  across you.

 B.F. Skinner:
  Because the external influences, which had pervaded its sensorium
  from birth, had caused it to develop in such a fashion that it
  would tend to cross roads, even while believing these actions to be
  of its own freewill.

 Jean-Paul Sartre:
  In order to act in good faith and be true to itself, the chicken
  found it necessary to cross the road.

 Albert Einstein:
  Whether the chicken crossed the road or the road crossed the
  chicken depends upon your frame of reference.

 Pyrrho the Skeptic:
  What road?

 The Sphinx:
  You tell me.

 Buddha:
  If you ask this question, you deny your own chicken nature.

 Emily Dickenson:
  Because it could not stop for death.

 Ralph Waldo Emerson:
  It didn't cross the road; it transcended it.

 Ernest Hemingway:
  To die. In the rain.

 Saddam Hussein:
  This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified
  in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.

 Saddam Hussein #2:
  It is the Mother of all Chickens.

 Joseph Stalin:
  I don't care.  Catch it.  I need its eggs to make my omelet"

haha
so i got bored.
it happens.

i somehow ended up in the bathroom in front of the mirror
talking to myself about how mirrors reflect anything possible
i didnt even notice i was talking to myself untill 
i noticed i was in front of the mirror

odd. how did i get here i thought
oh well no harm done...

so i continued talking
untill i really did something odd

i was talking to the mirror me as if it was a different person.
there was no word hallucinations, nothing going on that i wasnt doing.
but at the same time, i coudlnt figure out which one i was

was i the person standing in front of the mirror
or was i the reflected entity
as real to the eye as any thing else 

can i project feelings to this entity
and be the recipient at the same time?

i tried anger at first. its very simple to stumble on.
i yelled at myself, cursed the figure in the mirror as if he did something horribly wrong.
he didnt do anything but stare back at me
although he looked sad.

i smiled at him
he smiled back

i told him how much i loved him 
he giggled.

and how one day id take him away from all this madness
and treat him to a kingdom of fruit baskets and fields of daisys
he smirked...
but somehow knew that i was lying!

how did he know? i pondered
maybe we were the same entity

but how can something the same be two
but.. wait..
I wasnt even there
i was semi floating
a spherical perspective viewing a mirror into another dimension
i wasnt the mass of skin, bones, and muscle tissue
i was viewing him, but was not him.

in that world.. was a guy
standing there. staring at a blank wall

so i wasnt the person in the mirror
i was an observer
i was his subconscious
he was my product of being.

i apologized for lying
and then mentioned to him that it was time for bed
he turned off the light switch

and i was the person again
in the dark
wich ways the door?
scrambling with no sense of direction it finally was felt
and i exited..

man, that was strange

i guess when a person of infinite possibilities gets bored
something bound to happen.

cHaosCurTaiNs: this is in reference to:
cHaosCurTaiNs: After ten years of apprenticeship, a student achieved the rank of Zen teacher. One rainy day, he went to visit a famous Zen master in another city. When he entered the house, the master greeted him with a question, ""Did you leave your wooden clogs and umbrella on the porch?"" ""Yes, master,"" he replied. ""Tell me,"" the master said, ""Did you place your umbrella to the left of your shoes, or to the right?"" The visitor didn't know the answer, which made him realize that his awareness was not fully developed. So he stayed with the master and studied Zen another ten years.

cHaosCurTaiNs: cause i know i wouldnt know
nott matt: being in totality of the action he was doing.  putting his umbrella and shoes beside each other.
nott matt: if he was completely aware at the time.
nott matt: completely absorbed in his actions. and the joy in doing them
nott matt: then it would easily be rememberd
nott matt: he was probly exited about seeing this other master. and thinking of other things that would be than what he was doing
cHaosCurTaiNs: so youre saying if one is completely absorbed by the joy of their actions then the can remember them better
nott matt: yes.
nott matt: you can do things without knowing
cHaosCurTaiNs: but in turn knowing everything that your doing
nott matt: say you place your keys on the desk.
nott matt: but you were singing a song in your head at the time you did it.
nott matt: later...  you cant remember.
nott matt: because you werent putting the keys there at that moment
nott matt: you were doing something else.
nott matt: but if you observed yourself placing the keys in a position and did it rythematicly and with a sense of peace.
nott matt: do you think you would remember later?
cHaosCurTaiNs: hahaah
cHaosCurTaiNs: this makes me happy
nott matt: you often ask me whats wrong.
nott matt: in those times im usualy observing.
nott matt: im being silent.
nott matt: and when i tell you nothing.
nott matt: im not lying
cHaosCurTaiNs: but then i force you into lying cause im uncomfortable
cHaosCurTaiNs: cause im not observing at all
cHaosCurTaiNs: and if i was 
cHaosCurTaiNs: id know thats what you were doing and wouldnt have to ask
nott matt: yes
cHaosCurTaiNs: yay1!
nott matt: but being an observer doesnt mean that you dont do.
nott matt: just that you observe your doings.
nott matt: in doing that..  you cant do bad. or wrong.
nott matt: bad and wrong actions are done out of none observation
nott matt: non awareness
nott matt: have you ever heard the saying. ""the map is not the territory"" ?
cHaosCurTaiNs: no
nott matt: its verry well known in western religion
cHaosCurTaiNs: here?
nott matt: it comes from a zen story
nott matt: about how if you point at the moon, the moon is not the hand pointing at it.
nott matt: the moon isnt even a word.
nott matt: the moon is its self. in totality. unless you add other things too it.
nott matt: like.. calling it a big glowing sphere.
nott matt: its not that..
nott matt: it can be, with words. but without words it just is.
cHaosCurTaiNs: oh
cHaosCurTaiNs: wow that makes it kinda weird to think that were talking over the computer
nott matt: whys that?
cHaosCurTaiNs: cause we both just know its each other
cHaosCurTaiNs: we just know
cHaosCurTaiNs: :]
nott matt: if you sit and watch a beautiful scenery it just is its self. and thats more beautiful than words could describe it, as your watching it.
nott matt: the less form there is in your mind. the more beauty  you can see
cHaosCurTaiNs: :D
cHaosCurTaiNs: ...........................................::::::::::
nott matt: till things become like this http://alexgrey.com/a-gallery/theolg.html
nott matt: those lines are conceptions of the incomprehensable
nott matt: they spread through everything. make up everything. and are every thing
nott matt: they are the fabric of life esssence. the verry nature of god.
they see all. and know all. like watchers.
nott matt: there so bright. there almost blinding at first.
nott matt: because the mind is still holding on. still asking. still wondering.
cHaosCurTaiNs: do you see them?
nott matt: trying to place this white light, trying to make it conceiveable
nott matt: but like i said. looking directly at them will the intentions of finding out what they are for, or why they are for. will only scare them away
cHaosCurTaiNs: i was just curious what youd say
nott matt: i dont see them.
nott matt: because if i did.
nott matt: it would not be them
cHaosCurTaiNs: yes, thats it
nott matt: i can only see what i make of them, dreams, visions, healing lights.. fabrics..  whatever you make of them they are.
nott matt: i have exsperienced them though
nott matt: wich is totaly not explainable in any fashion what so ever
cHaosCurTaiNs: i know
cHaosCurTaiNs: i like making love because
cHaosCurTaiNs: i feel i can communicate fully
cHaosCurTaiNs: without relying on words or ideas
cHaosCurTaiNs: just myself
cHaosCurTaiNs: in giving myself
cHaosCurTaiNs: and i feel (when it is right) that thats a wonderful form of expression between two people
cHaosCurTaiNs: i also like dreaming with someone next to me
cHaosCurTaiNs: cause i feel like i am sharing again without words or ideas
cHaosCurTaiNs: especially if i am touching them in my sleep
cHaosCurTaiNs: my uncertainty sneaks up sometimes
cHaosCurTaiNs: to be in that realm of unity is very important to me now
cHaosCurTaiNs: i also like just being around people now
cHaosCurTaiNs: since my experience with caitlin and donald last week
cHaosCurTaiNs: and when you were here
cHaosCurTaiNs: i have changed emmensly
nott matt: just remember.  we all come into this world alone. and will leave it alone. nothing you share between another entity can ever change that
cHaosCurTaiNs: i also know that
cHaosCurTaiNs: but i think it is important while we are here to have those bonds
cHaosCurTaiNs: we are a social animal
nott matt: we are what we choose
cHaosCurTaiNs: well i have chose unsocial
cHaosCurTaiNs: and social
cHaosCurTaiNs: and have concluded that, for me at this point, i need social outlets
nott matt: pulling out the libra in you and finding the better isnt bad
cHaosCurTaiNs: what?
nott matt: libra...  scales..
cHaosCurTaiNs: oh
cHaosCurTaiNs: okay
cHaosCurTaiNs: gotcha
cHaosCurTaiNs: no, but im just so unsure of myself at times
cHaosCurTaiNs: when i interact with other people
cHaosCurTaiNs: thats why i thought it was better for me to be alone
nott matt: an unaware person dictakes the self by what others say of them.
nott matt: they know nothing else of the self besides what was told to them.
cHaosCurTaiNs: yes, you are absolutely right
cHaosCurTaiNs: its amazing that i could not understand that befre
cHaosCurTaiNs: that i had never even thoguth of the self before
nott matt: an aware person knows the self. and knows that it is just an image that can be molded and shaped into anything. but going with your feelings and instincts of who that self should be at the time is what dictakes that person
cHaosCurTaiNs: i understand
cHaosCurTaiNs: oh that feels so good to know
cHaosCurTaiNs: that i understand
cHaosCurTaiNs: this has been boggling my mind for a long time
nott matt: remember love.
nott matt: always remember love.
nott matt: without it, you'll be overtaken by power.
nott matt: love for all things. even those that afflict you.
nott matt: the things that afflict you are the most important.
nott matt: they show you what you have left of the self
cHaosCurTaiNs: you know what
cHaosCurTaiNs: a lot of times i want you to be proud of me
cHaosCurTaiNs: its kinda silly i guess
cHaosCurTaiNs: but when i do something and you agknowledge it
cHaosCurTaiNs: it makes me want to succeeded
cHaosCurTaiNs: and learn more and accomplish more for myself
cHaosCurTaiNs: maybe that makes me weak
nott matt: then you would be doing those actions.. for me?
cHaosCurTaiNs: no
cHaosCurTaiNs: its not that
cHaosCurTaiNs: you dont understand?
cHaosCurTaiNs: its not just for you
cHaosCurTaiNs: but for me
nott matt: and if i dont agknowledge it?
cHaosCurTaiNs: i dont know
cHaosCurTaiNs: maybe im still a child
cHaosCurTaiNs: or a fool
cHaosCurTaiNs: selfrealization is a bit difficult
nott matt: i doubt a fool, or a child would have the un assurance you give yourself
cHaosCurTaiNs: but why cant i fucking stop
cHaosCurTaiNs: im so frustraed
nott matt: because your trying to stop.
nott matt: you cant just say.. ""stop"" and it all be over in a flash
nott matt: unless you know where your stoping.
cHaosCurTaiNs: and i dont
cHaosCurTaiNs: cause its everywhere
nott matt: that stop has to find you.
nott matt: through the actions you do.
cHaosCurTaiNs: yeah
nott matt: through the awareness of the actions you do.
cHaosCurTaiNs: i know what youre saying
cHaosCurTaiNs: for some things i can assure myself now
cHaosCurTaiNs: like socializing
cHaosCurTaiNs: for instance
cHaosCurTaiNs: and not putting up a front of unassured fakeness
cHaosCurTaiNs: which took a long time to do
cHaosCurTaiNs: but i did it yay!
cHaosCurTaiNs: i understand now
cHaosCurTaiNs: it wont happen by tom.
nott matt: dont let your understanding encapsulate it
cHaosCurTaiNs: i can stop being frustrated now
cHaosCurTaiNs: ow do i go about doing that?
cHaosCurTaiNs: un undersatnd it
nott matt: what im saying.. is the ebb an flow of life will change. the currents will flow on and on. if you encapsulate it into an understand. rather than a knowing.
nott matt: then it can be damaging
nott matt: you may hold onto it
nott matt: and not flow with life
cHaosCurTaiNs: im a holder
cHaosCurTaiNs: and you know tha
nott matt: just dont be down when you miss an opurtunity from holding on
nott matt: otherwise you miss another opurtunity to awaken from holding on
nott matt: its kinna funny. how some people are aware the second they step onto the mountain. and its a hard struggle all the way to the top.  other people are in the clouds the whole time. and finally reach the top going..  wha? so thats what all of this was for?
cHaosCurTaiNs: so there really isnt a better way to be
cHaosCurTaiNs: aware or unaware
nott matt: you my friend are in the clouds. and your closer to the top than you can see from your perspective.
nott matt: there is a better way.
nott matt: to just be.
nott matt: you cant exspect to be aware 24/7 at first.
nott matt: or even for more than 5 minutes a week
nott matt: you cant really exspect anything.
cHaosCurTaiNs: i wish i could expect a big hug and kiss on the cheek from you right now
cHaosCurTaiNs: but youre right i cannot expect anything at all
cHaosCurTaiNs: al this seems so simple
nott matt: i would say it is... but then it wouldnt be.
nott matt: i would say it isnt....    but then it would be.
cHaosCurTaiNs: yup
cHaosCurTaiNs: i need to get ready for bed
nott matt: let go of your search, without giving up. and what you were looking for will be found.
nott matt: i need to take a shower
cHaosCurTaiNs: thats how i feel with you a lot
cHaosCurTaiNs: then go take one
nott matt: alright =)
cHaosCurTaiNs: alright
cHaosCurTaiNs: thats it
nott matt: is it?
cHaosCurTaiNs: ive been kinda confused on whether to tell you i love you 
cHaosCurTaiNs: recently
cHaosCurTaiNs: i always want to 
nott matt: then why dont you
cHaosCurTaiNs: but am scared cause i think you dont want me to
cHaosCurTaiNs: sometimes
nott matt: its not of importance to me at all if you do or dont
nott matt: because i Know. that you do.
nott matt: you would only be telling me
nott matt: for yourself
cHaosCurTaiNs: then why do i have to tell myself tha i love you
cHaosCurTaiNs: thats silly
nott matt: holding on some more?
cHaosCurTaiNs: to what
nott matt: the word.
nott matt: the concept.
nott matt: the interactions?
cHaosCurTaiNs: maybe i need reassurance
cHaosCurTaiNs: this is it
nott matt: love is definatly a strong drug.
nott matt: but that drug is not real love.
cHaosCurTaiNs: no
cHaosCurTaiNs: i dont know
cHaosCurTaiNs: now
nott matt: good...
cHaosCurTaiNs: whether im addicted or in love
nott matt: when you dont know.
nott matt: you can find out.
cHaosCurTaiNs: but its something
cHaosCurTaiNs: so if i cant find out
cHaosCurTaiNs: it always there
cHaosCurTaiNs: how do you know i love you?
cHaosCurTaiNs: not cause i say it, i hope
nott matt: alot of ways. 
nott matt: none of wich have to do with words.
nott matt: but actions.
nott matt: specialy actions over ones self for another self
cHaosCurTaiNs: do you know you love me in the same way?
cHaosCurTaiNs: right
cHaosCurTaiNs: theres a difference
cHaosCurTaiNs: i think
nott matt: i do know that i love you in all the ways i can when possible
cHaosCurTaiNs: by choice or by 
cHaosCurTaiNs: i don know
cHaosCurTaiNs: force
nott matt: definatly not by asking questions
cHaosCurTaiNs: i hope that sentence wasnt for me
cHaosCurTaiNs: cause i ask too many questions
nott matt: haha. jenny told me the other day.. that i had an afliction with thinking.
nott matt: and i said.
nott matt: ""well if i think about it then it'll never get solved huh?""
cHaosCurTaiNs: hehe
cHaosCurTaiNs: i need to stop thinking about love
cHaosCurTaiNs: cause i do just know
cHaosCurTaiNs: and i do just do
nott matt: whats to think of love?
cHaosCurTaiNs: and it just is
nott matt: only ugly things.
nott matt: love cannot be contained by words.
nott matt: unless its an ugly love
nott matt: an then its not a pure love.
cHaosCurTaiNs: i do feel kinda uncomfortable telling you sometimes
cHaosCurTaiNs: i feel like its fake
cHaosCurTaiNs: cause i said it
cHaosCurTaiNs: and saying it ruins it
nott matt: then why say it in those moments?
cHaosCurTaiNs: because were so forced to declare emotions in this society
cHaosCurTaiNs: breaking free is a challenge
nott matt: no its not
nott matt: holding on is a challenge
nott matt: breaking free is as easy as silently looking at your hand, or a flower.
nott matt: but freedom is an illusion.
nott matt: there really is no free.. to be had.
nott matt: its already there.
nott matt: freedom is an illusion created by your self
nott matt: without the self. what need is there for freedom?
nott matt: theres nothing to be enslaved
nott matt: theres nothing to be taken advantage of
nott matt: niether is there anything to die
cHaosCurTaiNs: i have so many feelings for you right now
cHaosCurTaiNs: for me especially
cHaosCurTaiNs: grateful
cHaosCurTaiNs: there is 
cHaosCurTaiNs: there was
cHaosCurTaiNs: there is always
cHaosCurTaiNs: i want to go
nott matt: whats holding you back?
cHaosCurTaiNs: closure
cHaosCurTaiNs: i still need it at this point, but no where near as bad as before
nott matt: then let me make it easy for you, as you will not for yourself"

"event","Harmony without and within


    Man is living as an island, and that's where all misery arises. Down the centuries man has been trying to live independently from existence--that is not possible in the very nature of things. Man can neither be independent nor dependent. Existence is a state of interdependence: everything depends on everything else. There is no hierarchy, nobody is lower and nobody is higher. Existence is a communion, an eternal love affair.


    But the idea that man has to be higher, superior, special, creates trouble. Man has to be nothing--man has to dissolve into the totality of things. And when we drop all the barriers, communion happens and that communion is a benediction. To be one with the whole is all. That is the very core of religiousness. 

    Heraclitus says: It would not be better if things happened to men just as they wish. Unless you expect the unexpected you will never find the truth, for it is hard to discover and hard to attain. Nature loves to hide. The lord whose oracle is at Delphi neither speaks nor conceals--but gives signs.  

    Existence has no language... and if you depend on language there can be no communication with existence. Existence is a mystery, you cannot interpret it. If you interpret, you miss. Existence can be lived, but not thought about. It is more like poetry, less like philosophy. It is a sign, it is a door. It shows, but it says nothing.  

    Through mind, there is no approach to existence. If you think about it, you can go on thinking and thinking, about and about, but you will never reach it--because it is precisely thinking that is the barrier. Thinking is a private world, it belongs to you--then you are enclosed, encapsulated, imprisoned within yourself. Nonthinking, you are no more; you are enclosed no more. You open, you become porous, existence flows into you and you flow into existence. 

    Learn to listen--listening means you are open, vulnerable, receptive, but you are not in any way thinking. Thinking is a positive action. Listening is passivity: you become like a valley and receive; you become like a womb and you receive. If you can listen, then nature speaks--but it is not a language. Nature doesn't use words. Then what does nature use? Says Heraclitus, it uses signs. A flower is there: what is the sign in it? It is not saying anything--but can you really say it is not saying anything? It is saying much, but it is not using any words--a wordless message. 

    To hear the wordless you will have to become wordless, because only the same can hear the same, only the same can relate to the same. 

Sitting by a flower, don't be a person, be a flower. Sitting by the tree, don't be a person, be a tree. Taking a bath in a river, don't be a man, be a river. And then millions of signs are given to you. And it is not a communication--it is a communion. Then nature speaks, speaks in thousands of tongues, but not in language."

The samurai's pride

The Zen master Hakuin is one of the rare flowerings. A warrior came to him, a samurai, a great soldier, and he asked ""Is there any hell, is there any heaven? If there is hell and heaven, where are the gates? Where do I enter from? How can I avoid hell and choose heaven?"" 

He was a simple warrior. A warrior is always simple; otherwise he cannot be a warrior. A warrior knows only two things, life and death--his life is always at stake, he is always gambling; He is a simple man. He had not come to learn any doctrine. He wanted to know where the gate was so he could avoid hell and enter heaven. And Hakuin replied in a way only a warrior could understand. 

What did Hakuin do? He said, ""Who are you?"" 
And the warrior replied, ""I am a samurai."" 

It is a thing of much pride to be a samurai in Japan. It means being a perfect warrior, a man who will not hesitate a single moment to give his life. For him, life and death are just a game. He said, ""I am a samurai, I am a leader of samurais. Even the emperor pays respect to me."" 

Hakuin laughed and said, "" You, a samurai? You look like a beggar."" 

The samurai's pride was hurt, his ego hammered. He forgot what he had come for. He took out his sword and was just about to kill Hakuin. He forgot that he had come to this master to ask where is the gate of heaven, to ask where is the gate of hell. 

Hakuin laughed and said, ""This is the gate of hell. With this sword, this anger, this ego, here opens the gate."" This is what a warrior can understand. Immediately he understood: This is the gate. He put his sword back in its sheath. 

And Hakuin said, ""Here opens the gate of heaven."" 

Hell and heaven are within you, both gates are within you. When you are behaving unconsciously there is the gate of hell; when you become alert and conscious, there is the gate of heaven. 

What happened to this samurai? When he was just about to kill Hakuin, was he conscious? Was he conscious of what he was about to do? Was he conscious of what he had come for? All consciousness had disappeared. When the ego takes over, you cannot be alert. Ego is the drug, the intoxicant that makes you completely unconscious. You act but the act comes from the unconscious, not from your consciousness. And whenever any act comes from the unconscious, the door of hell is open. Whatsoever you do, if you are not aware of what you are doing the gate of hell opens. 

Immediately the samurai became alert. Suddenly, when Hakuin said, ""This is the gate, you have already opened it""-- the very situation must have created alertness. A single moment more and Hakuin's head would have been severed; a single moment more and it would have been separated from the body. And Hakuin said, ""This is the gate of hell."" 

This is not a philosophical answer; no master answers in a philosophical way. Philosophy exists only for mediocre, unenlightened minds. The master responds but the response is not verbal, it is total. That this man may have killed him is not the point. ""If you kill me and it makes you alert, it is worth it""--Hakuin played the game. 

This must have happened to the warrior--stopped, sword in hand with Hakuin just before him--the eyes of Hakuin were laughing, the face was smiling, and the gate of heaven opened. He understood: the sword went back into its sheath. While putting the sword back into the sheath he must have been totally silent, peaceful. The anger had disappeared, the energy moving in anger had become silence. 

If you suddenly awake in the middle of anger, you will feel a peace you have never felt before. Energy was moving and suddenly it stops--you will have silence, immediate silence. You will fall into your inner being and the fall will be so sudden, you will become aware. 

It is not a slow fall, it is so sudden that you cannot remain unaware. You can remain unaware only with routine things, with gradual things; you move so slowly you can't feel movement. This was sudden movement-- from activity to no-activity, from thought to no-thought, from mind to no-mind. As the sword was going back into its sheath, the warrior realized. And Hakuin said, ""Here open the doors of heaven."" 

Silence is the door. Inner peace is the door. Nonviolence is the door. Love and compassion are the doors.

The philosopher, the mystic and the thunderstorm


I have heard about two men who were lost in a forest on a very dark night. It was a very dangerous forest, full of wild animals, very dense, with darkness all around. One man was a philosopher and the other was a mystic. 

Suddenly, there was a storm, a crashing of the clouds, and great lightning. The philosopher looked at the sky, the mystic looked at the path. In that moment of lightning, the path was before him, illuminated. The philosopher looked at the lightning, and started wondering, ""What is happening?"" and missed the path. 

You are lost in a forest denser than that of the story. The night is darker. Sometimes a flash of lightning comes--look at the path. A Chuang Tzu is lightning, a Buddha is lightning, I am lightning. Don't look at me, look at the path. If you look at me, you have already missed, because lightning will not continue. It lasts only for a moment--and the moment is rare when eternity penetrates time; it is just like lightning. 

If you look at the lightning, if you look at a buddha--and a buddha is beautiful, the face fascinates, the eyes are magnetic--if you look at the buddha, you have missed the path. Look at the path, forget the buddha. 

Look at the path and do something--follow the path, act. Thinking will not lead you, only action, because thinking goes on in the head. It can never become total; only when you act, it is total. Become interested in life!--living is the real thing. Don't go on collecting information about what meditation is--meditate! Don't go on collecting information about what dancing is--there are encyclopedias on dance, but the whole thing is utterly meaningless if you don't dance yourself. Throw all those encyclopedias! Unburden yourself from knowledge and start living. 

And when you start living, then ordinary things are transformed into extraordinary beauty. Just small things--life consists of small things--but when you bring the quality of intense, passionate love they are transformed, they become luminous.

A flash of lightning does not light your path, it does not serve you like a lamp in your hand; it only gives you a flash, a glimpse of the road ahead. But this single glimpse is very precious; now your feet are firm, now your will is strong, now your resolve to reach your destination is strengthened. You have seen the road and you know it is there and that you are not wandering aimlessly. One flash of lightning and you get a glimpse of the road you have to travel, and of the temple that is your journey's destination.

The parable of the wish-fulfilling tree


The thinker is creative with his thoughts--this is one of the most fundamental truths to be understood. All that you experience is your creation. First you create it, then you experience it, and then you are caught in the experience--because you don't know that the source of all exists in you.


Once a man was traveling, accidentally he entered paradise. In the Indian concept of paradise there are wish-fulfilling trees, kalpatarus. You just sit underneath them, desire anything, and immediately it is fulfilled--there is no gap between the desire and its fulfillment. You think, and immediately it becomes a thing; the thought realizes automatically. 

These kalpatarus are nothing but symbolic for the mind. Mind is creative, creative with its thoughts. 

The man was tired, so he fell asleep under a wish-fulfilling tree. When he woke up he was feeling very hungry, so he said, ""I wish I could get some food from somewhere."" And immediately food appeared out of nowhere--just floating in the air, delicious food. He immediately started eating, and when he was feeling very satisfied, another thought arose in him: ""If only I could get something to drink..."" And there is no prohibition in paradise so immediately, precious wine appeared. 

Drinking the wine, relaxed in the cool breeze of paradise under the shade of the tree, he started wondering, ""What is happening? Have I fallen into a dream, or are some ghosts around and playing tricks with me?"" And ghosts appeared! They were ferocious, horrible, nauseating. He started trembling, and a thought arose in him: ""Now I am sure to be killed. These people are going to kill me."" And he was killed. 

This parable is an ancient parable, of immense significance. Your mind is the wish-fulfilling tree--whatsoever you think, sooner or later it is fulfilled. Sometimes the gap is such that you have completely forgotten that you had desired it in the first place--sometimes the gap is of years, or sometimes of lives, so you can't connect the source. But if you watch deeply you will find all your thoughts are creating you and your life. They create your hell, they create your heaven. They create your misery, they create your joy. They create the negative, they create the positive. Everybody is a magician, spinning and weaving a magic world around himself, and then he is caught--the spider itself is caught in its own web. 

Once this is understood, things start changing. Then you can play around; then you can change your hell into heaven--it is just a question of painting it from a different vision. Or if you are so much in love with misery you can create as much as you want, to your heart's content. But then you are never complaining, because you know that it is your creation, it is your painting, you cannot make anybody feel responsible for it. 

Then the whole responsibility is yours. Then a new possibility arises: you can drop creating the world, you can stop creating it. There is no need to create heaven and hell, there is no need to create at all. The creator can relax, retire. That retirement of the mind is meditation.

 A hermit was meditating by a river when a young man interrupted him. ""Master, I wish to become your disciple,"" said the man. ""Why?"" replied the hermit. The young man thought for a moment. ""Because I want to find God."" 

The master jumped up, grabbed him by the scruff of his neck, dragged him into the river, and plunged his head under water. After holding him there for a minute, with him kicking and struggling to free himself, the master finally pulled him up out of the river. The young man coughed up water and gasped to get his breath. When he eventually quieted down, the master spoke. ""Tell me, what did you want most of all when you were under water."" 

""Air!"" answered the man. 

""Very well,"" said the master. ""Go home and come back to me when you want God as much as you just wanted air.""

Yeah! And you don't stop
Now, once again Ace One is on the wax
and this one goes out to everybody
who experienced in their lifetime
or going to experience in their lifetime some type of hardship
Because everybody goes through hardships
See hardship belongs to me
I will never give it away or sell it for a fee
I regret to inform you I will never set it free
Everyday I'm reminded of how hard it could be
I takes my pain just like a G
Got my struggle of life down to a T
It's nobody's fault but mine if I can't see
So I open my eyes and start looking for the key
Hardship is mine to hold onto
all through to the Yellow Brick Road it goes
My shoulders got the heaviest load but I pack light
and I compensate I got act right when I conversate
See some people relate but they don't understand the words
Some people can climb mountains but can't jump curbs
and vice verse. I know it's such a nice verse
but hardship makes everything worse
and worse is a reminder to stay on the path
But hardship is mine to have
cause hardship keeps me in check
mainly so I can check myself I give a fool respect
because he's real like a hundred-dollar bill
Without hardship you wouldn't appreciate your meals
Without hardship I wouldn't appreciate my skills
And so I do and so I grew and so I knew
that hardship not only makes most of my days blue
but it teaches me how to struggle in the jungle
and never crumble and how to remain humble
Some people they live life inside a glass case
Some people they live life in the vastness of space
And others will live long at a snail's pace
I live with hardship slapping me in the face
Because hardship belongs to me,
I will never give it away or sell it for a fee
I regret to inform you I will never set it free
Everyday I'm reminded of how hard it could be
How hard it could be...
How hard it could be...
Everyday I'm reminded of how hard it could be.



those words inspire me profoundly."

it was weird

i just sort of floated around

one place to another

i felt so disconnected with the whole atmosphere around me
which let me maneuver through the madness

tears where in my eyes
but my eyes were dry
if eye contact was passing 
it was unrealistic , vague , and strangely dizzying
every now and again there were those ones
they'll stare just as deep as you
an only get just as far as you
 
 they must see me


the gambling men and women machines of free form speech concentrated through work
they even know

they look in my eyes
they let me pass like a ghost

but the few and brave
there always willing to die
id hear a thought falling apon me
and id wink at the projector
theyd always crumble and counteract
with embarrassment suddenly pillowing through speech
speech directed no longer through me
but at the crazed hundreds drooling control

even a man
with a walkie talkie
. . .a sparkled badge of some sort
who caught me
where i shouldnt be
where no soul should ever have to go.
he knew.

he looked in my sun baked eyes
to find the stench of laziness
and asked

""Hey ! whatre you doing back here!""

he already knew
and i could tell

im just trying to get by  i said
just trying to make my way through

""your not allowed to be here...""

im sorry.
i promise to stay clear

""alright.""

the whole time
he didnt take his eyes off of mine
maybe two blinks

i know those locking eyes of power
i did not blink
i could hear the pictures on the curtains of his mind

he was just trying to get by too
just trying to make his way.


ohh dont take it in any way
i had a blast with my niece
whom i saw when i met up with family
 me and her went off to go use up the rest of the tickets 
everyone else got tired too quick
shes 7 ?  maybe 10?

well the poor girl talks and talks and talks
she has no clue what shes saying
but she says it anyways
i can hear her though
i can hear through the fog
the emotions and feelings behind it all are ecstatic
she knows somethings going on
and that little chatter box is buzzin what that brain cant figure out

well i figured it out

it is in my eyes.


i can only tell you if you look into them
you can only know if you look through yours"

penetrating vibrations shatter into weightless flow

explore the happiness you feel
with this kind of input you can sit back and let
the motive move you on waves from the suns kiss

sounds like an equation

but with feelings like these

to not explore
would be thinking yourself out 
of new extensive sensitivity
you can hide yourself farther and farther
and you can become dark and gloomy
as you loose yourself
you'll have to forget regrets
you cant be caught without reason
so you'll catch yourself 
in your own snare own growing hair

how is your hair by the way?

is it facing the trails deriving from your thoughts
youve colored in numbers the only thing you can
lost the will for reaching out
youve trimed and youve crooned hopelessly 
every last hair

youd better step away from the only frame holding you up
that mirrors got along way to go before you wear it out
its got alot of projecting forms growing 
youve planted and youve harvested a mask
with it on no one will ever ask

they'll already know

so step back
sit back 
hold back
all thoughts
let it grow how it wants
only conform to its needs
a stray?
lead him back to the field
let him know he can wield
the infinite tools
of cosmic debutant rules


let all wield the power
of silent tip toeing slippers
wings of wind follow you in
and cary you out
without a single doubt
youll caress yourself
moment by moment

if necessary
thoughts to feelings
feelings to pleasure

pleasure to content desire
of where you shall be going
release will be for your finite liar
when you reach your room
your home
your bed
in which 
you and your soul wed
no need to wait for night
or for anything in sight

let the golden age begin
let the window down
feel the monlight on your skin
let the desert wind cool your aching head
let the wieght of the world drift away instead
these days i barely get by
i dont even try
its a treacherous road with a desolated view
theres distant lights but theyre far and few
and the sun dont shine even when its day
you gotta drive all night just to feel like your ok

torn apart by iddle hands
through the helter skelter morning
fix yourself while you still can
no more ashes to ashes
no more cinders from the sky
let all the laws of creation
tell a dead man how to die
oh deserts down below us
and storms up above
like a stray dog gone defective
like a paper tiger in the sun
looking through a broken diamond
to make the past what it should be
through the ruins and the weather
capsized boats in the sea
oh deserts down below us
and storms up above
like a stray dog gone defective
like a paper tiger in the sun
were just holding onto nothing
to see how long nothing last
oh deserts down below us
and storms up above
like a stray dog gone defective

theres one road back to the truth
theres one road back to civilization

Guess Im Doing Fine (4:49)

theres a blue bird at my window
i cant hear the songs he sings
all the jewels in heaven 
they dont look the same to me
i just wade the tides that turned
till i learn to leave the past behind
its only lies that im living
its only tears that im crying
its only you that im losing
guess im doing fine
all the battlements are empty
and the moon is laying low
yellow roses in the graveyard
got no time to watch them grow
now i bade a friend farewell
i can do whatever pleases me
its only lies that im living
its only tears that im crying
its only you that im losing
guess im doing fine
press my face up to the window
to see how warm it is inside
see the things that ive been missing
missing all this time

ever turning
never turn its eye on me
how could this love 
ever changing
never change the way i feel
lazy sun your eyes catch the light
with promises that might
come true for awhile
oh ill ride farther than i should

End of the Day (5:03)


seen the end of the day come too soon
not a lot to say
not a lot to do
you played the game
you owe nothing to yourself
rest today for tomorrow you cant tell
you cant tell
seen the end of the day come too late
seen the love you had turning into hate
had to act like i didnt even care
but i did so i got stranded standing there
standing there
its nothing that i havent seen before
but it still kills me like it did before
seen the end of the day come too soon
like the prison dogs they sent out after you
you owe nothing to the past but wasted time
to serve a sentence that was only in your mind
in your mind
its nothing that i havent seen before

griding down diamonds
round round round the bend

up against themselves
make their daggers sharper
than there faces tell

Already Dead (2:59)

time wears away
all the pleasures of the day
all the treasures you could hold
days turn to sand
losing strenght in every hand
they cant hold you anymore
already dead to me now
cuz it feels like im watching something die
love looks away
in the harsh light of the day
on the edge of nothing more
days fade to black
in the light of what they lack
nothings measured by what it needs
already dead to me now
cuz it feels like im watching something dyin

havent got a lot to learn
and my eyes they stray again
looking for a satelite
in the rays of heaven again
theres no other ending
sunday sun
yesterday is ending
sunday sun
jealous minds walk in a line
and their faces jade the strain
stranded in infinity rooms
and there safe from any harm
theres no other ending
sunday sun
yesterdays are mending

Little One  (4:27)

go to sleep
were so tierd now
altogether in a snake pit of souls
new days 
to throw your chains away
to try to hang your hopes on the wind
little one
just a little way
today all we need is waiting
night rise
like the evening prize
in a turnstile backwards we fly
cold bones
tied together by
black ropes we pulled from a swing
little one
just a little way
today all of the dreams
are waking
cant stand on crooked legs
im cross-eyed to the wall
in these harbor lights
satellites explode
drown drown
sailors run aground
in a sea change nothing is safe
strange waves
push us every way
in a stolen boat we'll float away
little one
hold on hold on
all of the dreams are wasting

Side of The Road  (3:24)

something better than this
someplace id like to go
to let all ive learned
tell me what i know
about the kind of life
i never thought id live
till the ugly truth
showed me what it did
let it pass
on the side of the road
what a friend could tell me now
on a borrowed dime
in diferent light
you might see what
the other side looks like
in a random room
behind an iron door
kick an empty can
across an empty floor
let it pass
on the side of the road
what a friend could tell me now

explosion to fade out

as we run with the seasons, you change
while i'm standing here

all too often we doubt 
something so true
it leaves us naked where we stand
i saw your breath make a cloud
raining an ocean of your preciousness in my hand

what's one more year
waiting for you
i'm breathing for you
what a price to pay

she lights the stars in the sky
you know, angels can see them clear
through foul weather

and when the race ends
will we all fall down
safe and sound

30 days

as she wakes up
and i'm caught staring again
she asks me
what did you dream

i haven't stopped and isn't this part of it
as we lay rivers where once were streams

and when the race ends
will we all fall down
safe and sound

if we lost our way
would we trade it now
for the way we found
the ground
and how

without the sun

"event","In addition to the nonhuman entities which are perceived by astral vision, or on the astral plane, there are found on the astral or on the earth plane, a great class of entities, or semi-entities, which Occultist know as ""artificial entities.""
 
 These artificial entities were not born in the natural manner, nor created by the ordinary creative forces of nature. They are the creations of the minds of men, and are really a highly concentrated class of thought forms. They are not entities, in the strict sense of the term, having no life or vitality except that with they borrow, or have been given by their creators. The student of Occultism who has grasped the principle of the creation of thought-forms will readily grasp the nature, power, and limitations of this class of dwellers.


The majority of these artificial entities, or thought-forms, are created unconsciously by persons who manifest a strong desire-force, which is accompanied by definite mental pictures of that which they desire. 
But many magicians have learned the art of creating them consciously , in an elementary form of magic, white or black. 
Much of the effect of thought force, or mind-power, is due to the creation of these though-forms. Strong wishes for good, as well as strong curses for evil, tend to manifest form and a semblance of vitality in these artificial entities. These entities, however, are under the law of thought-attraction and go only where they are attracted. Moreover, they may be neutralized and even destroyed by a positive thought properly directed.

Another and quite large class of these artificial astral entities, consist of thought-forms of supernatural beings, sent out by the strong mental pictures of the persons creating them, the creator usually being unconscious of his results. For instance, a strongly religious mother, who prays for the protective influence of the angels around and about her children, frequently actually creates thought-forms of such angel guardians around her children. These are given a degree of life and mind vibrations from the soul of the mother. In this way, such guardian angels, so created, serve to protect the children and warn them from evil and against temptation.

 Many a pious mother has accomplished more than she realized by her prayers and earnest good desires. The early fathers of the churches, Occidental or Oriental, were aware of this, and consequently bade their followers to use this form of prayer and thought. They did not explain the true unyielding reason behind such actions. Even after the mother has passed to the higher planes, her loving memory may serve to keep alive these thought-form entities, and thus serve to guard her loved ones.

In a similar way, many ""family ghost"" were created and kept in the same way. All by the constantly repeated tale and belief in their reality, on the part of generation after generation. In this class are the celebrated historical ghost who warn royal or noble families of approaching death or sorrow. The familiar family ghost, walking the walls of old castles on certain anniversaries, is usually found to belong to this class of thought-form entities.

Many haunted houses are explained int his manner. The ghost may be ""laid"" by anyone familiar with the laws of thought-forms. These artificial entities are of purely human creation, and obtain all their form and mind from the action of the thought-force of their creators. Repeated thought, and repeated belief, will serve to keep them alive and to strengthen these entities.


Many supernatural visitors, saints, and semi-divine being of all religions have been formed in this way. In many cases, they are kept in being by faith of the devotes of the church. In many temples in the oriental countries, there have been created and kept alive for many centuries the thought-form entities of the minor gods and saints. These are endowed by thought with great powers of response to prayer. Those accepting the belief in these powers are brought into harmony with the vibrations and are affected by them for good or evil.
 
 The power of the devils of savage races (devil-worshipers) arise in the same way. Even in the early history of the western religions, we find many references to the appearances of the Devil, and of his evil work. Witchcraft, and diabolical presences, are all created thought-form entities. Many of the effects of sorcery and black-magic are produced in this way. It is the element of belief , of course , which adds to the effect. The Voodoo practices of Africa, and later of Martinique, and the Kahuna practices of Hawaii, are based on these same principles. The effect of ""charms"" depends on these same laws.

Even certain forms of the ""Spirits"" in certain forms of Spiritualistic seances arise from this principle. An understanding of this principle will aid in the interpretation of many phases of Psychic phenomena."

"event","when i was about 16
i discovered alot of things about myself
i had all the time in the world
one thing that was peculiar to my mind
was twitching.
i would go through phases where my muscles would spasm without my consent
 when sitting uncomfortable i would twitch 
 but in a semi voluntary manner
 i would start to move but stop
i would want to move but my thought would side track
 and id be left blank 
 all in a matter of split second

this puzzled me
So i set out to watch over myself
stalk the process like i was unfathomably hungry
hungry for a cause

i twitched in mid thought
like an electric shock
my thoughts erased
 
 quick! grab the thief!

unfortunately for you
i set up a camera
a snapshot 
triggered by memory loss

 your caught.

youve been stealing my feelings!
youve been keeping me from knowing my every thought that commands

and thus i learned to be more relaxed 

it gave me power though
how?
cause i could see it in others too
it was like a math equation equivalent to all
eventually i burned to dust

well it ended up that was the very first time i ever remember stalking myself
and actually accomplishing the hunt
i was that much closer to finding myself

have you ever seen a light?
through the trees
very far away
just a shinny spec
maybe at someones house through the woods?
maybe when looking at stars
you thought to have seen one
but looking in its direction
it not longer is?
or maybe on the power box of a building on someone elses house
or in another neighborhood

just a small spec of light with a shinny gloss

well that is the only way i could explain what im stalking now

i see little specs light up in milla second flashs
burst and fade as if electric wires shorting out
they throw me off 
and i always look to where there ssource came from
only to see them no longer
only a faint hue where they protruded through my vision

maybe its a trigger
when it flashs
it does something peculiar
that im not quite glimpsing the whole of
 yet.

or maybe

im just really crazy to you people.

id say. you couldnt understand
but you do.

when i look at an object i seem to look more at whats in my mind
than whats really there.
disillusioned creatively
 
cause whats really there?
nothings there. everything is what you make of it

so said the liar.. 
to keep him from admitting to himself
hes a liar and needs change

i once was in a car
that turned onto a one way 3 lane highway
not paying attention the driver speed up going strait at 3 cars
all withing a very close distance of each other
i yelled.
we pulled to the side quickly
i cried.

because i knew that moment i had been in the wrong this whole time

 i was trying to drive against life
 trying to dress shit up as a golden ray
my mind was too full of trash
and i was mearly acting the innocent fool
letting myself slip through the cracks
into an undesirable hell

i had to cleanse
and feel the real golden rays
im only now glimpsing the morning break

those storys with morals werent just kids passifiers
those fairy tales werent just from our imagination

synchroneities
 a bitch"

belong only as sighs

hold onto this one
and youll give up the next
no striding 
only flying
and if not air born material
then sprout new wings
learn these endless melodies
. lyrics of joy
contemplating not
at last living as if alive
instead of playing dead
instead of having said
loving without a thought of why
because i know
.       i know
we must let go
because i know without a thought we die
i know this cloudy vision is a lie
.  but without our goggled mind
it would all just make us blind
it would make us too powerful and yearn
thus we must all slowly learn
how to coupe with such tremendous vibrate feeling
how to love , .let go. , and face our own self healing

lies will no longer bound you
these worded wounds in your head will soon have found you
listen to yourself
they attack scramble disorient
. until i sound you
. until i bring you back

your given your thoughts to protect you
like a mother cradles a baby
like your soul reflects the view
. evening dew drop melting clue

. vibrate sounding light rays
meld through and through
until you give up the ultimate sacrifice
until you give up
 
                          .
.                        you                        .

well this one will be a lot skinner.


had a lot of fun at the dara show
i was sloppy drunk when i got there
took some shots of jack daniels
didnt think i was gonna be able to walk into the club.

 i met alot of cool new faces
saw some old friends i havent seen in years.
this girl brandy i havent talked to in almost 3 years!
 we use to be great friends.

i was pretty outa it until i sobered up
then i really danced.  precision baby.

 anyways.
this girl offered me a pill
 randomly and thoughtlessly
i took it.

 why? i dunno.
i havent rolled in along long time
and dont really enjoy it all that much.
something about fake energy compromising guilty fantasy's

of course. i cant dance when im rolling.
im way to mindless.
 i couldnt really feel the music.
it kept slipping past me.
anyways. an hour later the lights came on
and i got ill
really quick
so much wasted energy in funs name
the people
and just the dirt left behind was all it took.
 i had to get home. take a shower
 cleanse my mind
and quick.

 so me an rachel went back to my place
we ended up staying up till 10 am playin around
talking an havin a great time.
she doesnt like rolling people. so i was amazed things went so smoothly

Dead Melodies / live 1998

lays in the road 
straight to your door 
snakes have gone crazy tonight 
winding their way out of sight 

laugh, joke 
the sentiment wasted 
seasons and strangers, 
they come and go 
the doldrums are pounding 
cheapskates are clouding this town 
who could disown themselves now 

engineer 
slow down that old 
train 
send us in chaff 
laugh at the moon 
nightbirds will cackle 
rotting like apples on trees 
send in their dead melodies

 over the weekend when i got drunk with rachel

 i went to go take a piss...  
 she wanted to hold it while i pissed.

 
  so i had to teach her the technique..  since she couldnt feel the pressure.


 she said it was one of the most amazing experiences...
 it gave her a sense of what itd be like to piss with a dick.


it was amazing for me as well.  
 im EXTREMeLY piss shy.
 sometimes its hard for me to pee... in a stall... when theres even anyone else in the restroom.
 
  so it was sorta an accomplishment for us both. yay.

  all fruit like that reminds me of sex
maybe thats why they call them exotic fruit.

 anything juicy and sticky
i feel like im sucking on the most profound tastin pussy

      makes it a better experience for us both!

 i had to go through a day of having a huge spike in it at work
that got some funny comments..

 ""you know you have a pencil in your ear?""
""yeah... its too bad it doesnt light up and flash!""

 some people even seemed scared.

i love the feeling of stretching out my ear rings holes though
 its so..  abrasive
and boy does it hurt.  but its not a bad pain. its a longing pain.
 i told a friend that the holes make for air conditioning pipes through my conscious
 and as any of my friends could tell you.
 my overworking conscious needs soothing.
 
hopefully ill get my amber plugs back in soon. i love the feeling of organic material vs. stainless steal.
 but the amber plugs are a size 0 on the outside. and a 2 gauge in the middle
 so... it hurts getting them in.  
 gotta use da lube.


well i got work today from 4pm-9pm.
yay yay. so i better go get ready.
 any one know were jersey mikes is on 64. in lake pine plaza
then stop by tell the guy with the funny ear rings..

Rachel came to visit me over the weekend so weve been hanging out together
ive really had alot of fun with her. were working on being great friends
and it works out great.  besides the fact that everytime we touch 
 were both shocked with sexual pulses.
 and sometimes sex can get in friends ways..

 its odd though, i havent been horny lately. or even sexual.
 ever since about a week ago.
but somehow she always does it to me.
 i have yet to meet another girl as good as her.
 she can work it like heavenly steel
  
girls out there..   
  i dont know whats wrong with you
maybe its really just me
 but you girls gotta learn to give a little more?
you think all guys get hard in 2 seconds from just looking at a naked chick.
 well not this guy. you gotta put something into it besides jerky movements
 and tornado hands.

slow down... relax... and above all. feel what your doing. and feel what the guys going through....


 but anyways. damn that girl does it to me every single time. even if i dont want it. she makes me , wich no other girl could even remotely come close too.

   but like i said

were working on being friends right now.
 and its going great.

other news?
 i um. uh. went to some parties over the weekend! woohoo got trashed.
me and rachel got drunk an high every night

some skyy vodka an some JD will get you smashed
 last night (sunday night) 
 I gave her some pills. didnt tell her what they were
just told her to take them. and have a fun ride.
well she said she couldnt feel anything.
 but since i knew what i was feeling. i felt it. strongly
and shes a light weight compared to me. so i know she had to of felt it.

  i still wont tell anyone what they were. cause she might read this!
 it wasnt anything you could guess offhand. and not something anyone ever has!
 but i had 3 left. and she took an unknown pill. that caused an un known feeling

  and we went on a mental laugh parade through lala laands greener side

 thus making us closer friends.

well anyways shes here tonight too.
i just figured id come on an checkup on myself. 

 yep.  im fine.

soooo
hmm got up for work today.
everyone there was tierd. got too fucked up last night. had a babie keep them up. broke up with girlfriend..
Something. its always a thing called some
luckily we werent bussy. or the staff wouldve broke down crying. everyone seems to be smiling in shit.
no one wants a meaty sub on a rainy day.

well i retook my test today. i passed this time!
yay. so now i can drive legaly with someone else.
i must perfect my driving skills so i can get a license now woohoo. got money for a car.
Im all set.

my life seems to be fitting together finally.
when i was young. i lived my life as if i was going to die the next day.
and as a young teen. as if i was already dead

so. i never set up a future for myself
im left scrambling with the peices i managed to come up with
trying to build a future life

its like i lived my life backwards..
spritualality first
then the whole job, money, car, house thing
things always felt so strong in me though
i had no choice. i couldnt ignore 
well i feel like ive reached a really good point with myself being spiritual.

although lately ive been going out and doing things to disrupt it all.
i need to. i never went through the whole social drinking stage. 
i skiped right past it
while everyone was getting drunk fucking and being social
i was indulging in millions of hits of paper elice D with a verry close circle of friends.

whats wierd.. when im around those friends.
i always get this vibe. makes me gigle like im tippin.


anyways. its friday night. party night.
im going out to nc state to get trashed.
see what happens.
im a big fuckin flirt. sometimes too much.
i get myself into positions then its like..
whoa.. i dont like you. i only like flirting with you. sorry ;x

oh well. flirtings a dangerous game unless used emotionless

i love being able to connect with people
to drop any games
defenselessly sit by your friendship.

were all ships.

either a relation ship
maybe a friend ship


do you relate?
do you befriend?

how do you comunicate with other vessels
to have a strong signal""
a pulse within

are you hiding yours
is it lost searching
can others feel it


my generator is hydrolic silence
points as sharp wine
you bend or disolve
but puncturing in
intoxicate your soul too no end
break through leather skin
find light through batterd tin
disregard thoughts for sin
you know you wanna fly
free from within
when your ready
ill exicute the timeless bin
slow but steady
sneak out the back
you'll see whats too lack

24 out of 25!!!!!

its so retarded. you HAVE to answer 25 questions right
but along the way. if you happen to miss 5... your ok
But 6! and you fail!! 
well before i got my 25th answer right.. i got my 6th question wrong. =(


the whole time. 
this little japanese guy beside me was asking me
if i knew the answer to the questions on his screen. i couldnt make out most questions so id say no or tell him i wasnt sure.. well i did help him with one question that i had just answered.
anyways. what do i get for helping him?

DISTRACTION 

an its not like im about to ask this guy.. whos like 40 somethin and verry japanese accientishly speaking.. about brakes and hills.


SOOOooooooooo
i wasnt on the schedual to work today.
i was tomorrow from 11-4pm.
wich meant i couldnt go retake the test.
my sister comes up to me. asks me if i can work for her tonight. an tells me the only way i can get off early tomorrow is if i work for her tonight.
how much earlier am i getting let off? 
3pm.
OoOo wow. an hour earlier! compared to 5 hours of work ill be putting in for her tonight.

at least i get to go retake my test.
im verry frustrated with it.
I was so close. yet one symbolistic digit keept me away.

i could just go take it next week.. 
but damnit im determined to get this thing.
ive put it off for too long.

its 11:22 am!


wow. i didnt go to sleep till laaaate the number 622 comes to mind. but no work today! woohoo!
lot of other shit going on though. almost worse than work! ahhh!. oh well. 
ill make it through

i just found me a bottle of blues
some strange comfort for a soul to soothe
ain't it hard
ain't it hard,
to want somebody who doesn't want you 

and i've been waiting for a year, a day
some strange weather must be blowin' my way
cause i got no mind to go or to stay,
or be left behind 

holdin' hands with an impotent dream
in a brothel of fake energy
put a nickel in the graveyard machine
i get higher and lower
i get higher and lower
like a tired soldier
with nothin' to shoot
and nowhere to lose
this bottle of blues 

egos drone
and pose alone
like black balloons
all banged and blown
on a backwoods river
the infidels shiver
in the stench of belief
i tell my momma i'm a hundred years late
i'm over the rails
and out of the race
and the crippled psalms
of an age that won't thaw
are ringing in my ears 

holdin' hands with an impotent dream
in a brothel of fake energy
put a nickel in the graveyard machine
i get higher and lower
i get higher and lower
like a tired soldier
with nothin' to shoot
and nowhere to lose these
bottle of blues

its days like this im reminded of who i am. what im really here for. although i wait and wait for a petty glance. nothing compares to campanionship ,friends imbraced through a single string.



im only wishing youd feel the same


marker daddy: light the road for me
nott matt: what road?
marker daddy: that's all the light i needed
nott matt: =)
marker daddy: when you realize there is no self anymore
marker daddy: then you are impeccable
nott matt: i was able to find my hands
marker daddy: you've become impeccable
nott matt: they radiated red
marker daddy: don't waste energy
nott matt: but..
nott matt: what is a waste?
marker daddy: there's more important things to do than look at your hands
nott matt: when endless is as is
nott matt: tell me about it
marker daddy: waste is a limitation of language
marker daddy: i say waste
marker daddy: but i mean misuse
marker daddy: or something different
nott matt: ;]
marker daddy: it was always about making our acts count
marker daddy: why is it, only now, we can do it with such fluidity between us
marker daddy: ?
nott matt: i stare into air and it glows. 
nott matt: and as silence takes over it changes
nott matt: its not longer glowing. its pure
marker daddy: you know you can make it different, don't you
marker daddy: ?
nott matt: of course
marker daddy: you can become anything
nott matt: thats only the introduction
nott matt: ;]
marker daddy: don't use up your personal power on glows and red hands
nott matt: it takes nothing to do so..?
marker daddy: nothing?
nott matt: no-thing
marker daddy: i can do it
marker daddy: but it draws on my energy that i've conserved
marker daddy: teach me to do it with nothing
nott matt: im not sure how?
marker daddy: the farther i move it
marker daddy: the more energy it takes
marker daddy: less now than in the beginning
nott matt: i dont see why you have a limit
marker daddy: its me
marker daddy: you're right
marker daddy: its only me
nott matt: surrender to energy and it will always be there
nott matt: limit less
nott matt: to run out of energy
nott matt: is only to fight against it
marker daddy: then you are truely correct
marker daddy: there is no waste
marker daddy: its not about cultivation
marker daddy: or conservation
marker daddy: its about tapping in
nott matt: thus becoming
marker daddy: it takes everything
marker daddy: but its not mine
marker daddy: and what's everything in compairison with infinity

nott matt: haha yesterday i sat outside eating a bowl of cereal
nott matt: staring at the clouds
nott matt: they morphed and melted as if i took a vile of acid
marker daddy: how's your eyesight?
marker daddy: in general
marker daddy: as opposed to what it was....a year ago
nott matt: then they disapeared. and my vision was that of a sphere
nott matt: as far as glass's?
marker daddy: did you die?
nott matt: or the extent of wich i can see into things?
nott matt: or the precision in molecules?
nott matt: ;]
marker daddy: it doesn't matter
marker daddy: you died
marker daddy: didn't you?
nott matt: i always do
nott matt: but im always reborn
marker daddy: i'm proud to know you
marker daddy: I died.


(after reading)

cHaosCurTaiNs: i myself am liquidly inspirated by that conversation, it is as if two streams of equal power are sharing the same trench and teaching themselves and eachother of the power they have inside themselves and eachother

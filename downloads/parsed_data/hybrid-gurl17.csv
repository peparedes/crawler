"event","My father is a dickhead when he is drunk. He decided to keep bitching and moanin about how horses make the weeds in the paddock, we got the point but still he went on and on and on to mum for hours. Then he decided that we should get rid of the horses coz we dont ride them. I went off my face, i have never gone so psycho i mean i have hated him for awhile so there was more than this issue but i screamed so much that my throat hurts two days later. 

He is not talking to me at the moment, i dont blame him and i dont want him to talk to me. He acts like im the favourite daughter when really he controls and manipulates me the most. Anyway i told him to fuck off we didnt need him, there our pets get over it etc etc. Then i walked out of the house, which i am told by my mother who fetched me before i was halfway up the highway it shut him up. And its done the trick he hasnt talked to the whole family for two days. YES the peace is wonderful.

I don't hate him, i hate him when he is drunk and whinges about insignificant things. Josh who is the guy i always turn too when im emotional and crying took me and his girlfriend for a drive yesterday which was good. He and i have the same music tastes and he plays good music in his car. Thanks... 

I'm feeling better now. Pat and I had our first official piano lesson tuesday. Which is funny because he knows alot about guitar chords when i know nothing. And he is suprisingly good. I have no more piano this year last lesson was last night. my teacher is looking forward to next year because ill be less stressed due to the lack of VCE. I'm doing a combination of grade 6 and 7 which i am excited about. 

I have been working heaps because i want a laptop, i probably need a laptop, but mostly i want one. So ill be working tonight, whoo hoo. 

There was something i wanted to say but i did forget. Oh yes i've been shopping for our work kris kringle, end of year costume party. heheh. I am the bride really really really not FUNNY, and my groom is my boss vanessa. Thats funny. But i don't feel too bad a lady from work is lending me her dress and someone gets to go as a baby. I'd loved to have gone as a vampire or a gothic or something, but a bride!!! Its all meant to be a secret but we all know each others costumes we just don't know who is giving our presents. Last year i found out before hand who was buying me a present and this year i have already been told. Its not fair! But i had already half guessed.

I have to be off, i am rambling on a bit kinda like dad. thats bad

"event","Today was alright, actually. Harry and I went shopping which is cool coz we need to hang out before she goes to queensland. 
So after that and missing half my new favourite tv show, i baked a chocolate cake, which my sister tells me tastes like shit. Not suprising i really can't cook i'll have to try it to actually know whether it is crap or not. 

Its my valedictory dinner tommorow night and im excited, coz i get to see everyone for basically the last time, but tara isnt going :( that makes me sad she is an awesome friend who lends me lots of books. I am a book worm if you ever want to get me a present get me a book hehe or a cd.... Valedictory gives me an excuse to try and look half decent, and then i can either keep in contact with the good friends and ditch the acquaintences. 

but before all that the group is going out for a bbq... how sweet! It will suprise me if the whole group got invited or not!!!! There are subsections to our group, that get really bitchy occasionaly

Ill be off now, gotta ring my buddy Jess after this song finishes.

"event","HAPPY BIRTHDAY to ben for yesterday, not that he reads this, but at least i care.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY to Cathy for today, im going to her house for a bbq after work. Gets me out of the house, thank god.

yesterday i saw my old piano teacher , my first piano teacher who taught me ten years ago while i was at work. She hasn't changed a bit, i couldn't believe it was her. Susie is the best, but then she won a talent show and i had to leave to my current teacher Joy, who also rocks. I remember i got a teddy from susie its in my room,  and me and gerard used to do duets at eisteddfods, he hogged the seat haha. 
When i grew up i realised i didn't like eisteddfods so i haven't done one for a year or two, i do them because i need to.... I don't like people watching me, but anyways. 

Well why am i speaking of that? I thought it was cool and plus i am practising the piano at the moment, it sucks coz i have 4 completly different songs to learn, and i only really like two. BLAH

Best be off now, nearly lunchtime

"event","Sunday's drive me spastic.

Well today i slept in as usual, and my room scared me its so digustingly dirty, there is school work everywhere. School reports, cd's, pens, magazines, books, you name it and its on the floor. 

I made a decision and a compromise with mum that i won't clean it until wednesday, so yeah thats wednesday. I went shopping and i knew i shoulda left money at home, or the card coz i knew i'd spend lots. I like what i brought but i didnt exactly need new cd's or books to be left on the floor with the rest. I got a birthday present for cathy and a card coz i ain't making another birthday card it took me forever. 

My brother discovered the new webcam and next thing im on the background, he took a pic of a pic of me. I hope that makes sense, little shit he acts like he is about 16 im so cool etc etc. 
Anyway math methods is awaiting me- thanks cliff for the post thingo it was cute...

"event","I have the feeling of one down 5 to go. Its a bit sad!!!! So after my mental breakdown last night, mum got my icecream, i've concluded i should do it more often. 

Well english was a bore, to be quite honest none of the topics actually excited me, i only done them coz i kinda have to. I also got the distinct feeling not many people actually finished, so i feel priveledged.

Anyways i have to be going to work now.

Well I'm a new user of the gadget, Thanks ben! 

Anyways im just a year 12 student at the moment, and the first exam for every year 12 except jess who had her dance earlier is FRIDAY. 

English- let me tell you is not as easy as it looks. Anyway its not stress out time yet, even though its freakout time for everyone else. My freakout time is tommorow. It is unlikely ill be online, ill be curled up in a corner somewhere, and would of killed the canary.
Its drivin me insane, all it does it sing, all day, all the time, doesn't stop, like a hammer in the back of your head pounding away. 

I have been to piano tonight, and we discussed my english exam for about 15 minutes. Then we done some musicianship grade four work, to my astoudment i could do majority of the exam without revision. Go me. Too many thoughts of exams, and then i have to think of how my playing will go on with hopefully uni and stuff. Hopefully Grade 7, he he he he

Anyway ill be off now,

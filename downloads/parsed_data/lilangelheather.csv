"event","<p><br />There is nothing more amusing than discovering a new series, googling it, and having Google churn up a link titled, &quot;[Spoilers] Baccano! - DotA Allstars Discussion&quot;.<br /><br />If you don't understand why, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXKd7uuehlw&amp;feature=related"">click this link now and turn on a subwoofer</a>.<br /><br />That being said, I am mildly depressed that, once again, I have fallen madly in love with a series that has a smaller fanbase, despite being ridiculously awesome. <br /><br />Granted, half the time you can't tell who's who, what's going on, or when exactly all this shit is going down, as there are massive time jumps that only really make sense about five episodes in, but it's worth it. Completely. <br /><br />My favorite characters would be&nbsp;Vino [read: the psycho] and Czes [read: the shota], and I'm not entirely sure why, as I'm rather taken with Firo's hat as well but can't seem to like the rest of him. =/</p><p>Erin, your favorite character will either be Luck or Maiza.&nbsp;Possibly Jaccuzi, though he has&nbsp;the&nbsp;potential to annoy the hell&nbsp;out of you as well. Grant will like Ladd, if only because they seem to have the same love for violence and perpetual speech. <br /><br />That is all. &lt;/bows&gt;</p>"

DX<br /><br />On an unrelated, yet even more tragic note-- I CANNOT FIND A&nbsp;COMPUTER I LIKE. <br /><br />As I said, weeks ago, my computer, my laptop, my BABY-- died. Completely. And since then, I've been trying to locate a new, shiny laptop to replace my dead-and-buried laptop. And since then, I have been to Best Buy, CostCo, Circut City... <br /><br />HP decided their computers needed more shiny, but in a bad way. They went chrome-tastic, and it is all kinds of hideous. <br /><br />Basically, I need a laptop&nbsp;with a damn good graphics card, at least&nbsp;three USB ports, and a comfy built-in mouse. No&nbsp;annoying&nbsp;number keypad nonsense.&nbsp;Preferably not hideous. Even more preferably functional.<br /><br />I'm already sobbing over the fact that it pretty much <em>has </em>to come with Vista.<br /><br />Help!"

"event","Summary of the last two days of Forensics:

Heather-is-the-narrator-and-pwns-you-all: I warn you, I have burnt people before during labs like this.
Gaurav-is-impossible-to-spell: I'm sure you'll do fine.
Heather-might-kill-herself-if-she-keeps-on-typing-like-this: Yeeeeeeah. Sure. I'll be fine. You, however, might be missing an arm or two by the end of this.

We go back to the lab, and along with two bottles of acid, a bottle of bleach, and a bottle of acetone, we've got only three watchglasses.

The last one, closest to acid no. 1, is mysteriously filled with something left over from the last lab group. So Gaurav decides to get rid of it-- by reaching for the watchglass and spilling the mysterious, possibly acidic liquid all over his hand.

We sit there for a moment, then turn the sink on, and wait for it to wash off. 

We laugh about it for a bit, because he's fine, so it wasn't acid, and pour the rest of the mystery liquid down the sink.

.....

The sink starts smoking."

And despite the brilliant fact that it's the thirteenth of the month and that makes it special in all sorts of cool ways, no one really thinks that's all that impressive.<br /><br />&lt;/emo&gt;<br /><br />On a happy, cake-related note, there will be cake.<br /><br />Not a lie. =D<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Cut for mildly massive emotional recollection of the best emotastic birthday ever.

Okay, I do <em>other people's </em>parties, but I don't bother with mine anymore.&nbsp;<br /><br />My last real attempt for a proper birthday was met with complete and utter failure, but somehow ended up being one of the happiest days of my life.&nbsp;<br /><br />I had exactly one attendee despite all the invites I had sent out, and that was Julie. My Mum hung out with us as we did the usual birthday classics like cake and jewelry-making. Dad skipped over the necklaces but stayed for the cake. At some point, while being squished on a couch that really could have fit a good five people on it comfortably if we'd bothered to place the one seat back, we ended up watching <em>Elizabethtown, </em>because Orlando Bloom was exceptionally drool-worthy.<br /><br />And at some point while watching the movie, I ended up crying because I was so goddamn happy to have these wonderful people trying to make this my best&nbsp;fucking birthday, attendance be damned.&nbsp;<br /><br />I mean, I don't really know how, but for all the times I feel like I have absolutely no reason to even be here and screw up in the worst possible wau,&nbsp;I've still got people who love me at the end of the day.<br /><br />I've got people to come 'home' to. And that's the best present anyone could ever give me.<br /><br />So for my birthday, I just kinda want to be with the people who are really important to me, the people who've supported me through my most idiotic moments and have always managed to be there even if I can't get a damn hug in person-- and make sure to give me plenty when we're together for when we're apart.<br /><br />All of my love to&nbsp;Julie (<div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://lifebeforetaxes.livejournal.com/profile""><img style=""BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 1px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://p-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://lifebeforetaxes.livejournal.com/""><b>lifebeforetaxes</b></a></div>&nbsp;) and Erin&nbsp;(<div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://hatazo.livejournal.com/profile""><img style=""BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 1px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://p-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://hatazo.livejournal.com/""><b>hatazo</b></a></div>&nbsp;).

""Why does <i>everything</i> end in <i>tears?!</i>""</p><p>Alphonse Elric sighed and turned a page. ""<i>We</i> live happily ever after, brother.""</p><p>The blonde pushed his chair around to face his younger sibling, wincing at the harsh scraping sound the chair made against the floor.

Alphonse could almost swear he could hear Ed's teeth grinding over on the other side of the room. </p><p>""That's not the <i>point</i>, Al. All of my relationships end in <i>complete and dismal failure</i>.""</p><p>""At least you have them. It's hard to have sex when you're a tin can.""</p><p>Ed frowned over at him. ""You got a body in the movie.""</p><p>""I was reborn as a pre-pubescent child, brother. If it was illegal for the Colonel to screw you as a minor when there was a fourteen year age gap, it's even more illegal to even consider it with me.""</p><p>""That didn't stop him from trying,"" Ed groused.</p><p>""It was sort of flattering in a creepy you-screwed-my-brother-and-now-you-want-me?-you-pedo! sort of way,"" Al mused. He turned another page.</p><p>""I mean,"" Ed continued loudly, ""even the Colonel and I get screwed over. Seriously! He looked like he and Riza were having a damn good time at the end of the series, and all the sudden, WHAM! He's out in pseudo-Russia angsting over <i>me</i>. He finally gets out of his funk and I have to leave to stop the world-- <i>worlds</i> --from collapsing in on themselves!""</p><p>""That sounds more like his problem, brother.""</p><p>Ed waved his arm in an exasperated sort of way.

""Rose seemed happy with her daycare.""</p><p>""...I've been wondering. She spends months as the figurehead for an armed religious rebellion, chased after by the military, and all the sudden people are like, 'Hey! Watch my kid for a day!' What's up with that, huh?""</p><p>""Where did that come from?""</p><p>""You mentioned the kids. But seriously, how does that make any sense?""</p><p>""Brother, does <i>anything</i> about our show make any sense?""</p><p>Ed twirled around and grudgingly went back to his computer. He stared at the screen and quite suddenly opened up Google and started typing. Al went on reading for a moment, before curiously glancing up at his brother. ""What are you doing?""</p><p>""Online dating, Al. I'm gonna look through some personal ads. Maybe set one up for myself.""</p><p>Al's eyebrows found their way into his hairline. ""<i>Excuse me?""</i></p><p>Ed waved a hand in the air idly. ""Come on. You never know. Want me to set up one for you, too?""</p><p>""<i>What?""</i></p><p>Ed glared back at his brother. ""I want my happily ever after, damnit.""</p><p>""And you're going to use the <i>internet</i> to find it? Come on, there's gotta be someone we haven't thought of!"" Al racked his brain for a moment, finally tossing his book aside. ""We haven't done all the Alternate Universe people yet. There's still Alter!Winry and Alter!Roy--""</p><p>""Not canon,"" Ed replied. </p><p>""Well, there's..."" Al trailed off before pointing triumphantly at his brother. ""Alter!Scar and Alter!Lust! They were together at the end, remember? In the wagon!""</p><p>Ed frowned, trying to remember the five second cameo the pair made. ""...We don't know that they were actually <i>together</i> together. I mean, it wasn't actually Alter!Lust, right? It was the alternate version of the woman who became Lust in our world. And she had a thing for Scar's brother."" He scrolled down some search results and squinted at the screen. ""And anyway-- I'm still left alone.""</p><p>""<i>Brother</i>,"" Al cried, exasperated. ""Would it <i>kill</i> you to read a proper AU fic?""</p><p>""Yes,"" Ed replied stubbornly. ""It would.""</p><p>""But why?! If you don't count the High School and Crossover ones, most of them are actually pretty decent!""</p><p>Edward turned back around, glaring. ""They always turn me into a whiny brat!""</p><p>""You ARE a whiny brat, brother!""</p><p>Ed twitched. ""Am not!""</p><p>""Brother,"" Al replied, crossing his arms as he stood from his seat on the bed. Ed swiveled around in his chair, sulking. ""Have you been present for any of this conversation? Because it completely contradicts that statement. And you're-- You're not listening to me, are you?"" Alphonse sighed. </p><p>""Noa!"" Ed shouted with a sudden grin, snapping out of his sulk.

So we're looking for a&nbsp;replacement.&nbsp;My favorite so far is the one with the amazingly cute cook-- I never caught the name of the place, but we went twice, and it's near Caputo's,&nbsp;--followed by the place on campus, and then the Mona Lisa.<br /><br />Mmmm, pizza.<br /><br />This morning I was woken up by... Emma. Surprise, surprise. Apparently this morning was her first bath. She was not happy about it.&nbsp;<br /><br />That being said, her voice <em>carries</em>.<br /><br />Hence, why I am posting at nine in the morning.

<br /><br /><strong>Day 3.<br /><br /></strong>Feeling more than slightly unconcious for most of the morning, I don't really remember much except that I woke up late with Grant poking his head into my room as Mum dropped off an offering of Starbucks and a bagel. I ended up dragging myself out of bed just enough to eat said bagel-- which had been cream-cheesed while I was attempting to down myself in my coffee --and getting paritally changed into movie!Al before realizing that both coffee and breakfast together makes me sick.&nbsp;<br /><br />Tossed out the last, bite-sized piece of bagel and unhappily dragged myself to the other hotel room, where I promptly stole Megan's spot on one of the beds.&nbsp;<br /><br />Apparently I make a pretty femme!movie!Al,&nbsp;considering I hadn't quite buttoned up the shirt yet and I hadn't stolen a hairtie from anyone for the wig, and I was conned into staying that way for another hour until we left for the con.&nbsp;<br /><br />We skipped off to the con with a Gurren Lagann group, a two-man Hellsing group, and myself as movie!Al.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'd lost Grant as my movie!Ed, so I dragged Josh the Second along as my non-cosplay buddy while I looked for another movie!Al that was supposed to be attending on Sunday. It's actually kind of amusing in a way, as we spent most of the time outside of the chess match looking for her, and found her two minutes before I actually had to leave.<br /><br />I ended up meeting up with Emily, the anime!+movie!Winry from the previous day, and we happily skipped off together to watch the chess match. We found ourselves more than slightly annoyed that not <em>only</em> were the Sins killed off, but all of the FMA cast was, once again, dead by the end of the show.<br /><br />Skipped out in a disappointed manner and was dragged off for a few more photos before running back into Sam, the automail!Ed from the day before, and the Envy who still remains unnamed. Enlisted their help in finding the other Al and in making me a sign that stated that I had lost my <strike>short</strike>&nbsp;older brother.<br /><br />Somewhere inbetween goodbye hugs and last minute photos, my sign went MIA, actually. =/<br /><br />Has anyone seen that, by the way?<br /><br />After Erin and I picked up our luggage stowed away&nbsp;with the hotel, we ran off to the car and drove back to Sarasota, where we remain happily ever after.<br /><br />&nbsp;"

Finished minor costume details and we rushed out to the con.&nbsp;<br /><br />The one problem with movie!Al is that he is also known as cosplay!Al, AKA: the almost-but-not-quite-accurate Edward Elric, at least to the uneducated masses. Having Grant as movie!Ed helped a bit, but I was still confused as Ed more times than I can count, which is rather funny considering that my wig was most definately not blonde nor braided, but was practically identical in colour to Al's hair in the movie.<br /><br />And you know how perfectionist I am, so you know I checked.<br /><br />More than once.<br /><br />I ran into several happy FMA people as well, and we marched around in a happy&nbsp;little group which usually consisted of myself, Grant, an Ed named Michael, another Ed of the female variety named&nbsp;Sam, a Winry named Emily,&nbsp;an&nbsp;unnamed Envy, and several military officers, most notably the cute Havoc and miniskirt!Sheska and miniskirt!Riza.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lots of Elricest occured, most of which I was at the center of, considering I was the only Al, and the Eds continued to multiply.&nbsp;<br /><br />Had several people spaz out about my eyes and how I wasn't wearing contacts, but actually have Al's eye colour. It was kind of funny, because I somehow get all shy and embarassed&nbsp;when people compliment me on stuff like that, and ended up acting <em>more</em> like Al. Squeeing insued. <br /><br />We spent quite a lot of time sitting in the dealer's room, usually in one of the corners, with different groups of assorted people, as my feet hurt from my boots and Grant's shoes actually ended up<em> breaking </em>along the seam of both sides.<br /><br />We had shoe issues.&nbsp;<br /><br />Yeah.<br /><br />Apparently Red Bull was having a Flugtag, which happened to take place right outside the convention center, so we had to deal with several drunken idiots that simply would not take a hint and fuck off.<br /><br />We planned to have a massive FMA meeting in room 13 during the FMA:CoS showing, but unfortunately the <em>Whose Anime?</em> panel was at the same time. It's kinda funny, remembering how it was originally, in a regular panel room where we actually had room for everyone to sit, and then the next year, where it was still in a normal panel room, but an overcrowded one where there was a line out the door and hardly any standing space. This year, they decided that a simple panel room would not be enough, and upgraded to a stage, complete with microphones and a catwalk.&nbsp;<br /><br />The signs also upgraded from ""Break out into Massive&nbsp;Orgy"" to ""Break out into Global Orgy"".&nbsp;<br /><br />Yaoi Man made his appearance again as well, and Stripper Man was introduced.<br /><br />I ended up running back to the FMA:CoS showing just in time to see where Al met up with Ed via a suit of armor, and promptly glomped Grant the exact moment Al cried, ""Brother!""<br /><br />There was much rejoicing, and we spent the rest of the show laughing about how Alfons is totally gay for Ed, and how Al's little speech after <strike>stalking Ed</strike>&nbsp;crossing the gate sounded very similar to a proposal.<br /><br />Something along the lines of 'staying by your side forever' and togetherness. Either way, we made quite a show of bowing at the end of the movie along with Emily,&nbsp;who&nbsp;changed from anime!Winry to&nbsp;movie!Winry just for the occasion, and Michael, our 12-year-old Ed that we happily corrupted with as much innuendo as we possibly could.<br /><br />In the end, I spent most of my time pre-rave with Grant, where we clung to each other in a not-so-brotherly manner and had our very serious get-to-know-you-and-all-your-dark-secrets discussion, which was rather fun.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />You know, the serious questions like, 'What do you want to do with your life?', 'What do you think about God,&nbsp;death, and other cheerful nonsense?' and 'What's your favorite colour, anyway?'.<br /><br />We both like red. Preferably dark, but saying 'blood red' is just too cliche, so we just say red.<br /><br />We went off to the hotel after the movie and met up with the rest of the group, putting as many glowsticks on Grant that we could manage. ...We managed a lot. He could light up the entire hotel bathroom just by himself.<br /><br />Managed&nbsp;free&nbsp;coffee&nbsp;down in the lobby.&nbsp;May or may not have had alcohol in it, either way it was passed around the room while we stuck glowsticks in Grant's hair while watching <em>Pysch.</em> <br /><br />Unfortunately, the rave opened an hour and a half late, so we were kind of annoyed at that. We spent the time waiting in line while singing Disney and Voltaire songs.<br /><br />Midway through I ended up ditching the boots, and was supremely happy when Josh the Second helped me limp back awkwardly to the hotel, as I killed some muscle in my foot that should not have been killed.&nbsp;<br /><br />The boys-- mostly Grant, our resident Pretty Pretty Princess and Radioactive Man, --pretty much stripped off their&nbsp;glowsticks&nbsp;the moment they got into their room, and the glow on the floor was epic enough for them to summon us to&nbsp;come see it. We pretty much ended up collapsed randomly around the room, pondering the ethics of not bothering to move back into our own rooms for the night. I happy snagged the pillow offered by Grant and ended up lying around on his bed&nbsp;with him, Josh the Awesome, and Krissy for another hour or so while listening to Josh the Second play the guitar.&nbsp;<br /><br />Megan ended up falling asleep next to Matt on the floor, and though they were quite possibly the cutest thing ever, we eventually had to drag her back to her own bed.<br /><br />Sat up with Erin discussing raves and other dance-related things while eating ramen&nbsp;at five in the morning, then&nbsp;finally went to bed for the night.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />End Day 2. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

After a few awkward ommisions from our usual greeting, we mixed up some seating arrangements with another passenger and settled somewhere around the proximity of seats 25 DEF, where we proceeded to do what we always do; make comments that are completely inappropriate in certain settings.<br /><br />Like singing our remake of ""I Believe in A Thing Called Love"", more commonly known as ""I Believe in&nbsp;A Thing Called Jihad"", and telling stories about getting pulled over by police officers and having them call your house, which is labelled as ""Jihad Headquarters"" in your phone directory.<br /><br />Stitched the corners of the flamel on my jacket back down with my mini, security-approved sewing kit-- the iron-on stuff just wasn't holding in places.<br /><br />We also played with my smartphone and discovered that it actually <em>cannot</em> be turned off.<br /><br />...Seriously.<br /><br />We parted ways in Altanta and I boarded the plane to Sarasota, where I proceeded to sit with a woman who was having an absolutely dreadful day, and had spilled a considerable amount of coffee on her white shirt.<br /><br />On a side note, the stewardess introduced us to the fine art of cleaning stains with only Seltzer water and a maxi pad.<br /><br />Arrived at the Sarasota airport and promptly started stripping. Long sleeved coats are fine for freezing cold planes, not freakin' miserable hot weather of doom. The massive amount of black I was wearing did not help.<br /><br />Ran into Erin and Ana, who drove me over to the store to buy Diet Coke and Chex Mix for our trip, and got changed in the car. Drove over to Josh's, picked him up, laughed at the eleven fuzzy hats he was wearing, and drove to Matt's.<br /><br />Shoved everyone-- and all of our food, clothes, etc. --into Matt's father's car, and drove to Tampa.<br /><br />Spent more time trying to stitch the corners of the flamel down, took several pictures of Josh sitting back in the trunk with the luggage, sleeping his ass off while the rest of us chatted away.<br /><br />Learned a plethora of names of FL kids from the Anime Club at Erin's school, including, but not limited to Grant, Rutherford, Krissy, Kirsten, Ana, Kenny, Becca, Megan, Matt, Josh and the other Josh, because apparently we needed more pretty and Joshes seem to be good at that.<br /><br />We had to wait until everyone arrived to pick up our Metrocon tickets, because&nbsp;this year&nbsp;registration&nbsp;was a bitch like that. So when we officially dressed-- With me as Hunni again, for the Ball, --and left the Hyatt, it was just past six in the afternoon.&nbsp;<br /><br />We pretty much took two steps into the dealer's room and they announced they were closing.<br /><br />Picked up a stalker in the form of a femme!Hunni, who would not, for the life of me, leave me alone. My eventual escape was entirely a group effort, with special props to Kirsten, who attempted to hide me in the bathroom, Grant, who assigned himself as my personal bodyguard, and Ana, who acted as my lovely lesbian date for the Ball.<br /><br />The Ball wasn't half as shiny as last year.&nbsp;<br /><br />That's all I'm gonna say about that.<br /><br />Skipped off back to the hotel. Said 'hi' to Mum, who shipped in around seven and had been playing Flyff in her hotel room ever since. </p>Showered and then passed out with&nbsp;Erin.<br /><br />End Day 1.<br /><br /><br />Day 2 in next post, for I am lazy and I am hungry, and Erin is willing to cook food for me."

That entire paragraph is one sentence.<br /><strong>Heather is the narrator and pwns you all:</strong> To be perfectly honest, I wasn't listening when we started this, so I didn't know it was a prompt. I thought it was supposed to be another one of those student things. ...I started adding periods. <br /><strong>Miranda shall be henceforth known as Yamicus the Great:</strong> You would.</em><br /><br /><br />Yeah. Faulkner, we were not amused.&nbsp;<br /><br />At this point, I'm pretty much pulling out any and all sketches that I have shoved inbetween my notes. Most of them are on Chemistry and WHAP notes-- Oddly enough, I did suprisingly well in WHAP, despite the massive amount of doodling over what I'm sure was supposed to be a chart about Africa.&nbsp;<br /><br />My Chemistry grades are inversely proportional to my amount of doodling on supposed Chemistry notes.&nbsp;<br /><br />...I think that sentence is right.

It's Graduation, so there are no seniors, and the sophmores are all skipping. Which means we've got freshmen and us, and that's pretty much it. The school is fantastically empty.&nbsp;

"event","So, our English class is getting a bit more talkative, believe it or not.&nbsp;

What with my sudden lack of WHAP homework-- and Miranda's, too --and a decrease in everyone else's, we suddenly have a lot of free time.

A lot.

Hence the group doodles with the intelligent half of the Corner, along with an influx of inside jokes.

And guess what?&nbsp;

The intelligent half-- They're being downright social with us.&nbsp;

Terrifying. But amusing altogether. Sam can't quite seem to stop listening in on Miranda's little tirades and our-- increasingly louder and far more blunt as we've had discussions rather than pure lectures&nbsp;--commentary on the lessons, and David occasionally adds his own thoughts.

Today, we went back to gayness and it's probability in Pruflock.&nbsp;A little bit less enthusiastic this time, considering it was more of a joke than actual seriousness, and David wasn't wearing the purple shirt-- Not even attempting to be colourful for it, he was wearing grey. Wasn't remotely relevant, damnit. --but it was entertaining none the less.

We also decided that Pruflock's problems could easily be solved with porn.

...Indeed.

I'm not sure what that says about our class.

Amanda's gone back to writing-- Though it's not in scribbly English this time, she's now fond of Swedish, actually. --and Claire continues to bring food for Miranda and I to attempt to steal.

But ew, we're social.

The seniors all had to take the final, Eli's absent, and Brooks was taking the Gov HSA,so I pretty much sat there for a bit before deciding to snag some popcorn from the back room.<br /><br />And by that, I mean the popcorn was delivered by the magical popcorn fairy, as a reward for my unwavering attention to the printer this year.<br /><br />Yeah.<br /><br />I &lt;3 magical popcorn fairies.&nbsp;<br /><br />Went to English, and spent a great deal of time doing nothing... Again. Ate&nbsp;Miranda's&nbsp;animal-cracker Spanish knockoff&nbsp;cookies. Passed notes with Liz concerning distance relationships. Paid minor attention to&nbsp;the lecture.&nbsp;Was blinded by Miranda's hideously bright-red Turkish shirt of doom. Started the Great Doodle Experiment-- which stayed surprisingly on-topic with our class discussion --and it was passed around our entire side of the room this time. But mostly stayed with us.<br /><br />Will post pictures later. <strike>Eventually.<br /><br /></strike>Chem was sacrificed for the sake of the HSA, and I went on to Math, where I proceeded to distract Sarah until the bell rang and we were released to lunch.<br /><br />Ta-da.&nbsp;<br /><br />That was today.<br /><br />On a side note, Miranda and I decided that we could create the best musical in existance if we combined Rocky Horror with The Producers and Spamalot.&nbsp;<br /><br />Specifically the numbers 'Springtime for Hitler' and 'You Won't Succeed On Broadway If You Haven't Any Jews'-- with fishnet.&nbsp;<br /><br />As it is, we're already planning parodies for 'Springtime for Hitler' depending on who gets elected President.<br /><br />Obama's version is by far the most humorous, though we admit that us moving to Canada might put a damper on the final product if he's elected.&nbsp;<br /><br />Hmm."

Which is a contradiction in of itself.<br /><br />...Yeah.&nbsp;<br /><br />That's my life.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have to figure out a couple of different things, so as of now, I'm using this as my to-do list.&nbsp;I need to figure out when I'm going to FL next-- And by next, I mean for the entire summer, so, Erin, start talking to the 'rents.&nbsp;<br /><br />In no particular order;<br /><br /><table style=""WIDTH: 260px; HEIGHT: 113px"" cellspacing=""1"" cellpadding=""1"" width=""260"" align=""center"" summary="""" border=""0""><tbody><tr><td><u><strong>Flordia</strong></u><br />Buy plane tickets for FL.<br />Figure out hotel, prices, etc. for Metro.<br /><br /><br /><u><strong>School Related</strong><br /></u>English AP Exam - Wednesday.<br />World History AP Exam - Thursday.<br /><br />Latin Video Project.<br />Three paragraphs for senior projects.<br />Letter to Advisor.<br />Quarterly Community Service.<br />Additional Final Project work.<br /><br />Find a foreign-born, kidnap them for WHAP.<br />WHAP Video Project.<br /><br />English Paper.<br />English Paper additional background work.<br />Read book for Quarter.<br /><br />NHS Hours - 1.5 extra.<br />NHS Service Project - sign up by Thursday.<br />Normal Community Service Hours - 10.<br />Keep up GPA.<br /><br />Make up Math Test Chp. 13.<br /><br />SA Flash - due by 5/30.<br /><br /><br /><u><strong>Life</strong><br /></u>Find a NON .mkv version of FMA:CoS.<br />Pick out next series.<br /><br />Call Josh.<br />Call Erin.<br /><br />Spend time with Julie.<br /><br />Plan out weekends for summer for Dad.<br /><br />Schro Cosplay - find clothes to mod.<br />Schro Cosplay - accessories.<br />Ed Cosplay - find clothes to mod.<br />Ed Cosplay - make automail.<br />The Great Wig Debate.<br /><br />Sleep.<br /><br />Eat.

"event","<p>All in all, pretty ordinary day. <br />&nbsp;<br />Spent IR working on Math, then skipped off to English, where Trexluh proceeded to go over our thesis statements that less than half the class actually wrote. This would have been rather boring, if not for a question David posed at the start of the class; Who would win a fight, a moose or a walrus?<br />&nbsp;<br />The answer is, quite obviously, the moose. I mean, tusks have nothing on those buggers. <br />&nbsp;<br />Also, the moose has Latin Class sponsorship. <br />&nbsp;<br />We love our mooses. Meeses. Miises? <br />&nbsp;<br />Moosies. There we go. <br />&nbsp;<br />Anyway, this was somehow translated into 'Who would win a fight, a moose, a walrus, or a narwhal?' by Claire and Miranda.<br />&nbsp;<br />Moose still wins, but it brought up some interesting ideas in the Corner.<br />&nbsp;<br />So naturally, they doodled a narwhal on the back of Miranda's test. Which I countered by doodling a moose, getting jumped by a narwhal. This paper was passed back and forth, until eventually, it found it's way out of the Corner and over to David and Sam, who doodled a dead walrus under the hooves of my moose. <br />&nbsp;<br />And thus, it began.<br />&nbsp;<br />The giant narwhal began to sell advertising space on it's tail, another moose appeared, riding on top of a smaller narwhal, and a sign was posted for 'Hitler-Stalin Funland', which was quickly followed by a showdown between Hitler and the moose mafia. </p><p>Yeah. All in all, very productive day. </p>"

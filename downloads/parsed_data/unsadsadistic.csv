"event","Slowly, I am tortured within the confines of my own room. Having to block out the voices from next door, having to avert my eyes as I walk down the hall...

I really am crushed. I really am hurt. I really am bothered. But what can I do.

I want to get out of here.

No matter what people say and no matter how much it doesn't matter, I really loved that boy. It hurts for me to see him now. But it also hurts that I can't bear to look him in the face anymore.

I really want to hate him. I want him out of my life. But...I know I still miss him. But I guess I won't miss being hurt. I won't miss wanting to cry. I won't miss having to smile even though I know I'm breaking inside."

I was so stupid."

"event","i think about him every day. god, what's wrong with me? there isn't a day where i haven't thought of him. probably not an hour where i haven't thought about him. there's no one i can go to complain because well...there's nothing much to be said about it. i have to let it die

of course i'll have to let my feelings fade. but i think i love him. and i know he doesn't think about me half as much as i do nor love me the same way. i'm jealous, too. he's never going to surprise me with anything. he's never going to come out of the blue to talk to me.

i was wrong to think that knowing would help me get over him quickly. that it would just disappear. but it didn't! what the hell. it's not like he's a spectacular boy. i don't know! this makes me sick. i'm crazy for feeling this way. 

i know i have to forget about boys. i really wish i could. even when i'm preoccupied, there'll be something in the back of my head wondering what he's doing."

"event","This early morning, when I went to bed earlier than usual (1:43 AM), I didn't sleep for more than an hour. I couldn't help but cry.

Why did I cry this time? It could have been a combination of feeling screwed over, screwing myself over, letting myself go to waste, and falling into despair. But...I still feel the most unsatisfied part of myself is my heart. I never had a fulfilling experience with love. I've never even had a real, serious crush. 

I know it's all right for a girl my age to never have been on a date and that's there's no rush, and that I don't need a boyfriend. Yet, it's not okay with me. I think deep down, I always wanted a boyfriend. I always imagined having a nice date to prom. Some people would tell me to concentrate on myself first, but I don't think I can do that happily without having some sort of a romantic experience. Anything. I confuse myself sometimes. There are times when I feel so desperate I would date anyone, but the reality is that I can't let myself do that.

Countless people have told me that one day, when I'm least expecting it, I'll find the right person. I'm too pessimistic to believe that and I never will. My main problem right now is my complete and utter lack of a love life - that and no ambition and motivation and direction. Ha! I can't wait for too long for a love. Before I know it, most people will be leagues ahead of me in the realm of relationships. I feel that a lot of people already are. Yeah yeah, I know I don't need to keep up with what other people are doing but I'd like to! I could go on about my sense of hopelessness, but that'll just make me feel more hopeless."

"event","My roommate first coined the term. (She has a crush on a white guy who lives on Dykstra 9, by the way. Ask if you must!)

So, this is my one entry devoted to amusing my fellow UCLA friends with its strangeness, lameness and odd sense of humor. What else can a girl do in the dining hall besides eat? Check out guys.

1. The Most Beautiful Asian Boy Ever

It all started sometime in spring quarter. I saw a beautiful Asian guy in the dining hall at dinner. I was intrigued by his beauty - don't know what came over me. Man! Nice hair, probably a good smile. I don't believe very many would agree with me. He's not ghetto or azn or particularly white. I can't describe it. Anyway, when I saw him on campus, I think I might have just started smiling...

I was sitting with Rebecca in loner row. When we went to put away our trays, the guy sat down in my seat. Oh fate!

 -->Friends' Reactions: 
Nataly: But he's geeky!
David: *eh*
Pooja: You have bad - weird taste.

2. Teddy Bear Boy

I was eating dinner with Chika and two other girls when I spotted a boy who wasn't particularly handsome, yet still seemed rather interesting. I asked Chika what she thought of him and she said that he was ugly. I don't know. I'm not sure how, but he became my idea of a teddy bear boy! It was a gradual process. He looked pretty short, but also very snug - like you could just squeeze him. He doesn't look like a cute little boy, but rather a mean-looking one. Yet I don't know. I feel like pinching his cheeks.

I don't think I pointed him out to anyone else. But...I did tell Sally and Eric about it. Sally says that whenever they see a short Asian dude walk by, they wonder if it's teddy bear boy. 

I hope I didn't stare too hard at these boys. Oh well!

Up next: Library Boy
Oh UCLA, how you make me sad."

Slowly, I can take my time as I look for eternal sleep. The water will me tuck me in and wish me goodnight. Forgotten will I be by the rest of the world. No matter."

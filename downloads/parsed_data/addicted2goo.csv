"event","So first of all let me start by saying.....I'm alive! I know it has been years since I posted, but I just wanted to let everyone know how wonderful my birthday was.
&nbsp; My day started out like normal. John and Madi always leave before I get up in the morning. They leave early because Madi's baby sitter lives quite some way from our home now. John usually walks in kisses me good bye, and he is on his merry way. Granted, most of the time, I don't even remember him coming in to say good bye. This morning I was&nbsp;vaguely awake when he came in and kissed me, and said, ""&nbsp;Happy Birthday baby."" So in my mind, I'm thinking I have XX amount of time to sleep before the alarm goes off. Next thing I know, I felt two little hands on my face, with a voice that went along with it. "" Happy Birthday, Kim"" with a kiss on the cheek. It was all I could do not to smile miles wide.&nbsp;
&nbsp; When I got to work, I was showered with kindness. I got flowers, candy, lotion, and the gift of Starbucks from 2 of my coworkers. These came with 2 of the sweetest cards I have ever received.&nbsp; (One made me cry). I got a plaque that said friends like you are special. Then 2 different coworkers bought me the 1st Harry Potter book, with a bookmark that stated friends are a special gift.&nbsp;THEY ALSO TOOK ME TO LUNCH!&nbsp;I have been in training at work, it seems that we are once again changing how things work at my job. Our company puts out a daily news letter with employees birthday listed. So I got numerous special emails today!&nbsp; My mom called me this morning and sang Happy Birthday to me, this is not the norm for me. I got home, and my mom called back to ask what I got at work, and I told her flowers, she thought I meant the ones SHE had sent!&nbsp; Since I was in training, I didn't get my voice message off my phone at work, which more than likely was the front desk calling to say, ""You have a delivey!"" Let's hope that's what my VM says! ;)
&nbsp;And at this moment I sit here stuff, because John and Madi took my to ShoGuns. It was my first time to go to&nbsp;a&nbsp;Japanese Steak House....WHAT FUN!...they have officially kicked me out of the kitchen, while they make me a birthday cake!. John, my sweet husband, bought me the sweetest card too!&nbsp; And I got well wishes via the phone from friends and family. This is what I would consider a perfect day, no DOUBT!"

"event","<p>Today is a very special day indeed. A few years back...let me see 20-21?&nbsp;<br />A beautiful woman named Crystal was brought into this world. And who could have known when she was born, the greatness she would achieve? Let me start by saying, if you know Crystal and/or myself, you might have heard that we met in high school. ""She had a blonde haired sister named Amanda...I had a blonde haired sister named Amanda.&nbsp; It was a conversation I never knew would bring us to such greatness.&nbsp; Being older, and definitely wiser&nbsp; ;) You know the kind of friends you make in high school, the ones that want to go hang out with you at the mall, or go cruising the streets to look for hunky guys.&nbsp;<br />Looking back, I see the ones who used me, pretended to be my friends, the superficial ones that wanted me to be there buddy to go places with them......then there was Crystal. There is not a time in the many years that I can remember a time that Crystal hasn't been there. The heartaches...too many to count.....the joys, the laughter, and the tears. And if you don't know Crystal, then you are unfortunate. Crystal is the girl everyone wants to have as their friend. She so much fun, he laugh can light up a room, she will give you hug just at the right time. She is a wonderful friend to have.&nbsp;<br />She inspires me. I love that Crystal is not afraid to be Crystal. She has a huge heart, and would help just about anyone. I know that she has always been there, and I know she always will be. If you know her, I'm sure you love her. And blessed are each of us who get to call her ""friend"".&nbsp;<br />I love you and wish you all the best! And we get to add another year on the long time line that we get to call friendship.<br /><font color=""#00ff00"" size=""4"">HAPPY BIRTHDAY CRYSTAL!</font></p>"

"event","OMG.....where to start.
Do you ever think, will I ever get things in my life right? I feel so disconnected from everything right now. And when I say everything, I mean EVERYTHING. Today, as I got up and started off to work, I literally felt like the walking dead. A Zombie? A Robot? Just going through the motions. Ya know? When I think about ""the girls""...it feels like YEARS since I have been in touch with them (which is an exaggeration-NO DOUBT). I don't really know where this is coming from. I just feel like I am never going to have time even to do the simple stuff. I know that buying a house is SO time consuming, but my wonderful husband is doing the majority of the ""HARD STUFF"" with all of it.&nbsp; And you know that ""good part"" that's in each of us. Mine came back and bit me in the ass! When I was married before, and was getting a divorce, my ex husband took my credit cards and ran up huge bills on them. Then the nice judge decided that since my ex husband decided to file bankruptcy, and both of our names were on these cards....I would get to pay his bills as well as my own. In the whole house buying process I am trying to locate some of these papers of the&nbsp;things that I payed off. Wanna talk about PAIN IN THE BUTT!!! Luckily I have a lawyer in the fam who is helping me! Some part of me wonders if it has something to do with my granny not being around.&nbsp; I wonder if I shouldn't be&nbsp;a bit further in the grieving process. Who knows? Who's to say where I should be? We all grieve differently.&nbsp; I guess I miss my girls, I miss my family (what we use to be), I miss my old job, and my friends there. I need a vacation....somewhere far away....well, somewhere different.
I know it's been forever since I've posted anything....then I come on here gripin' about life! I guess I just needed a bit of a rant."

I really am trying to give it a fighting fair shot. I'm not one to ""quit"" a job, whether I like it or not. SAD, BUT TRUE.&nbsp; There have been moments that I have LOVED this job....and I go to days where I HATE this job. We are&nbsp; a new company, trying to work out some of the bugs. I keep thinking the more I know, the better the job will be. I put in an application about 2-3 weeks ago, and I went in for an interview. Once, I did this I was like ""I really don't hate my new job"".&nbsp; I have been so back and forth with all this. It leaves a girls head in a fog. I REALLY want to like my job.....REALLY...it's a really good company to work for. So I got a call back from the guy I interviewed with, I had decided already I didn't want to take the job....it just wasn't what I thought it would be, and the money was not right. He called to tell me he hired someone else, which was cool with me.&nbsp; I guess really there is no point to my story....just putting it to paper.....I know I will ""hang in there"", unless something better is thrown in my face. If they wouldn't keep changing my job all the time....this would help too!&nbsp;<br /><br />Ok, changing the subject....<br />My husband is too funny. Being that he works in the brick biz, if a building is going up....he often comments,""wonder what that is going to be?""&nbsp; Well right down the road, a small building is going up....he asked his infamous question...to which&nbsp;I reply---""it's gonna be a Starbucks"". &nbsp;Anyone who knows me, knows I don't get enough Starbuck's and though Memphis has it's fair share....none are right on the way to work. So I have been kiddin' him that it's gonna be Starbucks. Well this morning when John leaves for work I get this call,<br />J- Hey, how much do you love me?<br />K-I love you<br />J-but how MUCH do you love me?<br />K- Bunches....why<br />J- I know what they are building on our street.<br />K- What is it???<br />J- STARBUCKS!!!!!!!!<br />&nbsp;OOOO Yeah....right on the way to work.......woo hoo....really I was just kidding. Let me start wishing for some more good things, and see if that&nbsp; happens too ;)</p>"

"event","so tonight we once again got a hard time when trying to return some things we got at TARGET.....
you can ask anyone who knows me, they know how much I LOVE TARGET......
Target has pissed me off to NO end....when it came to returning some of out wedding gifts....if it wasn't on our ""GIFTLIST"" they wouldn't give us credit.........not even store credit...needless to say CASH BACK!!!!
I know that there are people in this world who abuse returns...I KNOW THIS....but these are things Aunt Flow decided would look nice in out home regardless, of the color theme in our bathroom......we weren't asking for anything than store credit....that's all!!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; So tonight we went to return a paper towel rack we already had gotten off our giftlist....and a few things that had that lovely target symbol on them that we got for Christmas from some of my family, who don't really know John's likes or dislikes.....like the fact that he doesn't drink coffee, yet he got 3 coffee mugs( you know the nice travel kind).&nbsp; When I got home tonight, I decided to write Target I was so mad. The girl behind the counter informed us that at Target you can only return 2 items a year....(i'm guessing without a receipt).......thus begins the letter..........


I just really needed to let someone know exactly how much a few returns can make or break a store. I know retail, I have worked retail,and currently work in customer service. My husband and I registered with you all for our wedding registry. I had NOTHING but a hassle when trying to return ANYTHING on our list, or the GIFTS we received that were not on our list. Countless times it was a hassle. Tonight after trying to return some Christmas gifts, and a wedding gift at our local Target, we were told that we could only do two returns. My husband was so mad that he told the girl behind the counter, ""Just keep it...we don't want it...that's why we are bringing it back!"" After returning things to Bed Bath and Beyond, and getting no arguments, you can imagine that I WILL be recommending their wedding registry to my friends getting married. I know I am only one person, and seem one ""disgruntled customer"" (well two counting my husband). I have a big mouth and people around me will know that as for me and my husband, we WILL NOT be shopping with Target anymore. One use to be loyal customer, Kim XXXXXXXXX&nbsp;/&nbsp;John XXXXXXXX"

"event","Needless to say....My time is ALL screwed up. John and I started our trip home yesterday at 2:45pm.....we arrived in Nashville this morning at 9:00ish. Our first leg of the trip was Hawaii to Chicago...7 hours and some odd minutes, John and I sleep very little----even with my night time trip friend, aka Benadryl. When we got to Chicago, our flight home was about 51 minutes according to our pilot...I wouldn't know I slept the minute the plane took off til we landed. It was a good nap...INDEED!&nbsp; John and dredged home little by little to make it back to Memphis. It was a long drive home. Once we got here we had a breif nap, so we wouldn't&nbsp;sleep all day---as to not sleep tonight. Yet, we are home...we have lots of stories to tell, lots of highlights of the trip. SO MANY. Here are my highlights of the trip.
#1 Marrying John on the beach---with a beautiful day-sunset-minister-photographer-videographer.
#2 Our convertable Mustang----and our new friend, the attack geiko. John didn't know I could move from the front seat of the car to the back seat of the car so quickly.&nbsp;
#3 The wonderful food, but my favorite was Momma's Fish House.
#4 Playing in the ocean the one night with John...I felt like a kid again.
#5 The way I felt coming back to the hotel in my wedding dress with John. The congrats EVERYWHERE! And so many people said you look so beautiful. (despite the strugle to get into the dress....since my mom couldn't make it....I called the hotel and asked if someone could help me&nbsp;zip my dress....they sent up two women from housekeeping who were SO NICE). My hairstylist/make up artist told me that the mistake women make coming to the ocean who aren't use to it----they say women can gain up to 5 pounds, just from the salt water/salt in the air...they swell up....just what I needed to hear right before putting on my TIGHT dress.&nbsp; :) And it all the sudden became my girly time which didn't help either!!!!!!!!! Despite the wonderful food I&nbsp;HAD been partaking of!&nbsp;

All in all it was beautiful, and so fun......there will be more stories to come from the future MS Coffey :)

ps......I noticed when I got back that the LONG post I made before leaving about my trip to Disney, and my Batchlorette party DID NOT POST...I'll&nbsp; have to play catch up when I ge some rest.
GOOD NIGHT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :) Aloha/Mahalo!!!!!!!!!!!!"

First, it has been WAY too long since I posted....so here goes.
It's official...I'm in Memphis. Along with all the things I did over the weekend, cleaning the apartment, and handing over the keys was the LAST thing I did in Jackson today. I have to admit it was kinda bittersweet. Lots of memories from the old place, yet lots of new ones to take place here. I am now at my new job, which deals with Insurance Verification, along with filling prescriptions in the near future. This job is far different from ANYTHING I have ever done as a tech. (But in a good way, I think, should I say I hope). I have kept my IV mixing job in Jackson every third weekend, for the extra money...and some friends there.&nbsp; **letting go is hard , YO.**
And last but not least last night was way too much fun. I had a get together with my gal pals to celebrate my upcoming birthday....more details about that in next post!&nbsp;
YES, there will be a next post, and soon.
Mainly, just wanted you all to know that I haven't dropped off the face of the earth.
Also hope each of you are well....I promise to keep up with LJ a little better, since my life is calming down a bit now."

Sarah's mom actually use to work, where I work now. So, a lot of my co-workers know her (Sarah's mom).  It seems that Travis is finishing up exams, and moving to Colorado. From what I hear, Sarah is staying in Tennessee. On the show, he was very clear about the fact he wanted to move there. She pretty much made it clear that she wanted to stay in Tennessee.

"event","So it has been FOREVER since I posted, and thought it was time to give an update in my life.  Last week, I got a call from a nice lady from the local televison news.  She had heard though a little bird, <lj user=""writteninstars""> that I had met my fiancee through Eharmony. She then asked me if I would mind talking with her about the process. I said, ""Sure, why not!""  This was last Saturday, I met with her. I never imagined I would be nervous about this. With the camera in my face, I stumbled over my words, and repeated myself a lot! Let's hope with the power of editing they make me appear smarter than I felt. YIKES! It will air this Wednesday night on the 6:00 news. We'll see. The one thing she said that really surprised me was that she had talked to a few people who had met someone through Eharmony, and NO ONE wanted to admit to the fact they had met there mate that way.  Should I be embarrassed I met the best man I know through this site? HMMMM?
In other news, I really LOVED BSG last night.  One thought, I really loved Baltar's character when I watched the show in the beginning...well and still do. You know an actor is doing a great job, when you can love him and HATE him all in the same episode. Thanks to one <lj user=""asta77""> for her wonderful recap of last nights show.
Speaking of BSG, I know that I missed your bday <lj user=""danceswithwords"">, Hope your day was as wonderful as you are.  Happy BELATED Birthday wishes to you.  Thank you for turning me into one of those ""Sci-Fi girls!"" ;)
What a beautiful snowy day we have, luckily I have to go NOWHERE today!
I am trying to focus on the positive today, being that yesterday I had a bit of bad news. I am looking for a new job, in a different city, since I will be moving when I get married. My ""dream job"" testing was yesterday. It was a three part test. The hard test as the ""HR Lady"" told me was first. I passed it first try! The other girl testing with me passed on her second try, so we were HAPPY!  Second part of the test, typing! I missed it by two words! I was so mad at myself. I had a real bad case of the nerves, it really took a hold of me. It has been nine years since I have been job hunting. So I guess that makes sense. Third part of the test was Excel. I might be the only one in the world, but I know NOTHING about Excel. So, I'm giving myself a year (the next time I can apply there) and I will be a quicker typer, and I WILL know Excel. I will apply again! I plan on posting more, to improve my typing skills! I GOT SKILLS! Yeah, I said it! Until next time people, I will sit and enjoy the beautiful snow."

Highlights of my year included a lovely trip to San Fran, in which I got to explore a new part of the world, which I *LOVED*!
I met lots of new LJ friends, that I have gotten to keep up with thanks to LJ. I met a girl who couldn't be any sweeter, I would vacation with you anytime Mary. I met  man, and fell head over feet. No DOUBT. We will be married next year. I still have the greatest group of friends a girl could have. They would be there for me through thick and thin. I kept a friendship that I wasn't sure would keep. My grandmother is still alive. My brother and myself bonded more this year. I will have a beautiful step-daughter this time next year. I will be taking two trips that I know of already in 2006. One big HOO-RAA for the girls(Jackie this means you too). And honeymoonin' in Hawaii. 
I wonder if 2006 will compare to 2005.....so far it looks as though it might!
Happy New Year to you all.......
Enjoy lifes little moments......

"event","Well....It's official, I'm home. I have been home for a few days now, but my mind wouldn't know it. Tonight is the first night I have had to take some time for myself, in a *VERY* long time. First I wanted to say, ""Thank You"" for all the well wishes on my engagement. It's so odd to think about how this man has changed my life. I didn't even LIKE him when we first started dating. I am a lucky girl, and that's all on the mush factor.
I had a really nice time in KY, I felt as though I have gotten to know John's parents better. It seems to get better each time I'm there. The lack of communication seems to get better a bit more each time. (John's parents are deaf.) I learn a bit more sign each time we go. This week John's daughter came with us;she is four, and adorable. She seems to really like me, which is a plus. John and I spent quite a bit of time with his younger bro, Mark, this time. I'm enjoying getting to know him more. We went to see King Kong (with my baby daddy, Adrien Brody, in it). Personally, I liked the movie alot. It WAS long....but not unbearable. I had a small meltdown Christmas Eve when I was suppose to come home via airplane for Christmas with my family. John and I decided to ride together to KY, and that I would fly home a day early from KY to be with my family. WEEELLLLLLLLL.....I had talked to a Northwest agent and asked her if I missed my plane to KY, would they save my seat on the way back. SHE SAID YES!....they told me NO at the airport. They then proceeded to tell me that I needed to purchase another ticket(one way ticket) to get home. I called the person, told her what was going on...she then tells me I will have to buy another ticket which is $200 MORE to get home. I told her I didn't have the money, and basically I needed a ticket for that day. She then tells me how she can get me on another flight DECEMBER 31ST! ""Hello""...I need to be home DEC 24TH...besides the fact I had to work four hours Christmas Day. So I ended up hanging up on the woman, because she was terribly RUDE. I'm freakin' out a bit, John says we'll go home the 24th night. I tell him NO b/c he was playing Santa for his daughter, and having Xmas with the fam the 25th. I called my mom in a panic, and then think that I will try NW one more time. I am completely making an ass of myself, b/c I am crying like a two year old. This lady can tell I'm upset, and asks me what's going on. I tell her best I can without sobbing into the phone, she finally tells me to let it out. That did it....and I did. She told me to go talk to a manager. John and I waited for 45 minutes, and it was getting closer to time for the plane to take off. Finally, my folks told me that they bought me another ticket, and to ""JUST GET HOME"". I go to the NW counter, and am completley blubbering, and told them.....""My parents bought me a new ticket, get me on the plane. The whole reason I came to KY was b/c I had a free voucher, and it was free, and this is why I did this."" The guy looks at me and says ""Merry Christmas, get on the plane;tell your parents to refund there ticket."" I think I said Thank you. Maybe? But I made it....home for the holidays! And it has been a great Christmas, besides that. I got lots of cool stuff(INCLUDING AN IPOD!)....and I haven't even had Christmas with the girls yet! Hope you all had a wonderful holiday."

"event","Well, I spent the weekend in lovely KY. I completley understand why John brags on his state so much. It's a nice place, but I would never tell him that..hee hee ;)
So we went to Ky Friday night after I got off work. We got into Lawerenceburg pretty late. We got up the next morning and had lunch, via the time change, what could have been breakfast....now is known as lunch. We watched some football with John's best buds.....and the wives fixxed dinner for everyone. Then the reason we went to Ky in the first place, was for John and his brothers to get a picture made together for their parents for Christmas. The pics turned out well, from what we understand. There were serious pics...and a couple funny ones. I can't wait to see them! On the way home Sunday, John and I stopped in Elizabethtown to see the sights. When we got home to Jackson, we went to the 7:00 showing of Elizabethtown. The movie was good, I had heard it was getting so-so reviews. I went in expecting nothing, and I liked it. It wasn't a blow-me-away movie, but it was good. There were alot of KY refrences in the movie, including Orlando Bloom drinking an Ale 8. John was beside himself. It was really neat to see the town, then the movie.  Fun was had by all, I did completely miss my girls though. AND I SO WANNA SEE PROOF, is it worth seeing?"

"event","I am totally playing catch up on my weekend happenings, aka FRIDAY FROM HELL....
this will more than likely be a long post, you have been forwarned!
First,  work on Friday....as most of you know, I work in a hospital pharmacy. My day started farily normal. Then about 8:00a.m. A co-worker came to the back where we worked, and told me they are clearing the basement where we work, b/c somewhere in the hospital was flooding. We have drills for *everything* ALL the time. I am figuring this is something like that. I take my time getting out of the IV room, to realise that me and one other person are the ONLY two people in the pharmacy. We grabbed our purses (JIC)...and went on our merry way. As we exit the pharmacy we hear security guards telling people, ""Don't look back, just move, GO, GO, GO!"" I turn around and it's like a movie, around the corner comes a steady flow of water. It was crazy! So we take out running. In my head, I'm like, IS THIS REAL? It felt like something that I would see on TV or a movie. We watch the people scatter to escape this mysterious water. We end up outside in the parking garage. We then ""meet"" upstairs in the cafeteria. Long story short, we played RX techs in the lunch room. It was hard! We were literally running things upstairs, and down. It was CRAZY! I swear.  I had to take 8-9 flights of stairs at one point, nothing like the stairs and the heat to let you know exactly how OUT OF SHAPE you really are. When I finally made it back to the lunch room, I was exhausted. All day up and down stairs. I hadn't had time for lunch yet, and realised I felt faint. So I sat, wolfed down a sandwich, and some water, and thought all was ok. We finally got things cleaned and drained enough to be back in the RX by 2:00pm...things were hectic, but getting done. We got things caught up and around 5:00pm, I started to feel ill. In my mind, I was thinking..""Kim, you just got to hot today.""
Got home and was waiting for John to get to my house, I went to lay down, next thing I knew, I was throwing up.
My head hurt badly. I was thinking give me an hour, I know it will pass. I didn't! Not only did it not pass, it was the most pain I have endured in my lifetime. This was not a simple headache. I was at the point that I was scared. My Mom met me and John at the apartment. We went to the local convient care. The doc then tells me with the severe pain, and vomitting, I can't be sure that it's not a anurisum (SP?). So yes, my blood pressure shot up a bit more. He sent me to the ER for a catscan. I was poked like a pin cushion, and scanned , and probed, and prodded. The final conclusion was that all my test came back ok. I got a major shot of narcotics, that made me stop hurting for the first day, and made me feel like crap the next day. All in all, that was the biggest scare I have had yet in my 32 years of living. I'm good now, and have not had a headache since. Knock on wood. John was a real angel during all this.
And I am off to bed, hoping tomorrow fairs better than my last Friday."

She and her parents were generous enough to lone out there home for the night festivities. I was escorted to Angel's home by the lovely <lj user=""writteninstars"">. We stopped to pick up some fine wine, and make our way the the party. Party goers included <lj user=""reckleslinguist"">,<lj user=""blondeheroine"">,<lj user=""anglophileangel"">,<lj user=""writteninstars"">, and my new favorite guy, John, also attending was Justin (Crystal's Justin).  John had decided he wanted to cook for everyone. He was the first one there, to get the food started. How sweet huh? The food was good too. When <lj user=""writteninstars""> and myself arrived, most of our party guest were there in addition to <lj user=""blondeheroine"">'s mom. YAY! I love the mommer. I tried to pursued her to stay and play with us too, but she had places to be. Lastly, our host (whom had had a long day) arrived. Once the food was finished, we all ate, had a few drinks, and it was on to PRESENTS!!!!!! WEEEEEEEE! I honestly have to say, my girls COMPLETELY took care of me.....I won't go into great detail on the droves of presents I got...here's a few highlights though. I could never tell you in words how amazed I am year after year at the creativeness that is my friends. <lj user=""writteninstars""> and <lj user=""reckleslinguist""> got me awesome glasses this year. You can never have to many drinking glasses. <lj user=""writteninstars""> were lovely stripes, and  <lj user=""reckleslinguist"">  were like wine glasses on top with a small ball were the stem would be on a wine glass, the colors of these are beautiful! I got lots of great cds and dvds from the girls. <lj user=""blondeheroine""> made me this wonderful scrapbook of pics from years of knowing each other. I love it and will always cherish it! As I sat there in my princess tiara, I thought about how lucky one girl can be to be surrounded by so many people who love me. I really enjoyed Justin being there with us too. I will have to make a separate post on my gift from John, it will take alot of explaining. Let me just say he was VERY good to me. I love him very much. I finally got the Rob Thomas cd I wanted sent by one lovely <lj user=""asta77"">. Thank you dear, I really do wish you could have been here with us. I got lots of great presents but I have to tell you, <lj user=""writteninstars"">  and <lj user=""blondeheroine""> FINALLY found this Dana Carvey HBO special that we have been looking for since 1998. What a brilliant surprise!!!!! It was awesome! I got so many great cds this year, a couple thanks to <lj user=""anglophileangel"">. I really have the best of friends. Musically I am set for a while. Later came cake....this was the bestest of cakes made by one <lj user=""reckleslinguist"">. It had my ""hollywood boyfriends"" on it, and it was so yummy!

"event","OOOOO what a day,
today turned into my useless do nothing day. I had planned on doing tons of things which NOTHING got done. I just wanted to say to those of you who read my post last night that I'm sorry for ranting about my Mom. It's like she knows she's been completely crappy to me, and today she kissed my butt. It's always her way. Reguardless, I deleted that post....and Crys' .... you are wonderful.....I love you!
And Secondly, 1 and 1/2ish days left....till I am the luckiest girl in the world. My girls and my boyfriend, John, are having a get together in my honor. WHAT FUN!
I miss my girls so much! And more time with my sweet man, I am truely lucky! Saturday can not come soon enough!
Till next time, night all!"

"event","Well, this morning was totally weird.....
first, I woke up late, and got to work late....COMPLETLEY OVERSLEPT!....guess I just didn't hear my alarm. Then had the day straight from you know where....
DANG!......then about 3:00pm....a girl that works in the prescription area walks over and says to me, ""Special Delivery"". I received the most beautiful Irises. Purple and pretty. What a pick me up! When I think the man can't possibly top himself, he does. They were from John. What a sweet man! After work I had planned on going to see Scottie, which I did. We grabbed dinner, and went and picked up a few groceries, some for him, some for me. Then proceeded back to Memaw's home. He and I had a very detailed talk. Mostly about his role as caregiver to my granny, and where she might be 6 months from now. We talked about how hard it is to watch people you love get old, and that she will more than likely end up in a home. He told me things tonight about his home life, that explains alot about who he is as a person. I am really glad he confided in me. I like where he and I stand, FRIENDS. I am glad that I have a boyfriend who understands me, and can except this, even when I didn't know what to expect (BIG THANKS TO CRYSTAL THIS WEEK, you know why). I just feel lucky. I have great people who surround me, including all of you. Bad days turned good. Night all!"

"event","Did you know that West TN. had an earthquake today, YES....it is true. 
I was sitting at my parents home this morning, my step-dad and I were waiting for a few extra minutes to pass. My parents live near Florida Steel, heck, I'm not sure what they do there. From time to time though the house will kinda shake, and we know that it's Florida Steel. So, Bill and myself looked at each other, and I said ""What was that?"" In which he commented, ""It was Florida Steel"". We we both like ""Wow, ok"". Then I stopped back at my parent tonight, and I told Bill it was an earthquake, he said, ""I know, they were talking about it on the radio the minute I got into my car"". Then we both laughed, ""HAHAHA, Florida Steel!"" It wasn't a huge one it was a 4.0...but I can say I actually felt it. Now I can understand why all my San Fran friends talk about freakin' if a Earthquake were to hit.
Ok, next subject.....
Did anyone watch ""Hit Me Baby One More Time""? Kim=guilty...I did it!
I love the idea, but I thought there was gonna be more to it! All these ""has beens"" get together to perform the ""Hit"" song, then they do a cover tune by other famous bands. The winner got a donation to their fav charity. I guess it was nice and all, but I wanted more. So sue me!"

As the years pass us by, I tend to treasure friends more and more. Yours is a friendship many people can only hope comes around once in a lifetime. Luckily, our friendship has lasted half of our lives. Who knew when we chatted about our sisters so many years ago, that this would come to be. My memories of you and me are endless. I have to admit, I cherish everyone! (even the bad). I love you, you beautiful fangirl. Your fandom is vast, as prolly' as long as our friendship;) I'm glad I have been there close to every step of the way. I think about the things that you have provided me to make life richer, and fuller. It's amazing. Thank you for being the best friend a girl could ask for. I love you deeply, and hope that this year brings you as much happiness as you've brought me......vacations, birthdays,holidays,boyfriends,friends....our list is long....and thank God for that. I love you petal....O YEAH.....(lol) </P>

"event","So today was my first day back to the grindstone, after some well needed time off. Weirdly enough, I was ready to see my old ""work buddies"".Of course everyone wanted to know all about my trip.""What did you see?""  ""What did you do?"".....and as much as we did, and all that was there to do...my highlight was meeting everyone---HONEST! The first night out having Sangria and meeting most of you for the first time, AWESOME! Meeting  <lj user=""asta77""> for the first time after hearing so much about her, that was great. <lj user=""asta77"">, your everything I was told and more. Vacationing with you was a blast. <lj user=""ascian3""> and R...you two are the cutest! <lj user=""ascian3""> you give off such positive energy, you were a joy! <lj user=""pukajen""> the wonderful stories that you told. I could sit and listen for days, and thanks so much for carting us around the last day we were there. <lj user=""danceswithwords"">, you and <lj user=""thedeadlyhook""> I felt like I had known you girls for years. <lj user=""danceswithwords"">, thank you so much for all you did for us while we were in San Fran. <lj user=""thedeadlyhook"">, you are such a great tour guide.

"event","So as many of you know I hit Memphis in May Sunday for round 2 of concert goodness. Ever since I found out Billy Idol was coming on Sunday, I KNEW I had to be there. So first off,we saw some older gentleman singing, I never got his name. Obviously, I wasn't impressed. Sorry little guy. 1-10? 1....ouch I know.
Then was Lisa Marie Presley, the girl who went with me really likes LMP or LMFP(I'll let you guess about that one)that is what her hat/shirts say. Can't say I hated her. I thought she was actually really good. For who she is and what she does, she makes NO excuses about it. I think that is one of the things that makes her appealing. I can say she is a beautiful woman. She has a strong fanbase. I can say Memphis seemed to love her. Me? I'd give her a 7 of 10, not bad.
After LMP was War. I have seen these guys before. They are SO MUCH FUN! Unfortunately, they were having technical difficulties. They couldn't get the keyboard sounds to work. It seemed as though as so on as they got on-stage, they were getting offstage. War is always a good show. 9 of 10. (And I say 9 b/c they didn't get to play the entire set).
Next, the one the only Billy Idol! Ok, so for most people the thought of seeing Billy Idol might be""BIG DEAL"". I have to admit, I WAS one of those people. You know you see these people when your growing up on MTV(yes back when they did play videos) over, and over, and over. There was something about seeing this man I grew up listening to up close and personal. I had two immediate observations, first BI is in excellent shape to be his age, secondly Mr. Idol is one perverse/horny man. He was high energy the entire show, making crude hand gestures from time to time. Singing to one beautiful girl to the next. He really likes the ladies. He was so personable. The crowd went wild on many occasions when he sang old favorites ""Flesh for Fantasy"", ""Rebel Yell"", ""Hot in the City"", ""Eyes Without a Face"". Honest to God, one of the BEST concerts I have ever seen! 10 of 10! As he stated at the end of his show,""I'm Billy F***** Idol!"" Yes, Yes he is!
Last but not least, The Black Crows. I mean after BI, not much can compare. I like the BCs but when did they become a ""Jam Band"". *So* not my thing. But it was nice seeing Kate Hudson dancing along the side of the stage as her husband sang. Earlier in the day, we saw them walk out of the tent with their baby. Really sweet family. BC's 7 of 10. It was a great time, glad I got to see all the people I did get to see. It was alot of fun!"

"event","Well last night, a gal I work with and myself decide to go to Memphis in May....this was her first time for her to go. I asked her if she minded standing in the rain to watch the shows? She told me no.....so with rain in the forecast, we decided to go. I did have fun, but it was wet and miserable! We decided to stay at one stage, because my friend really wanted to see the Wallflowers.
The first guy was Michael Tolcher( never heard of him). He was really good. Cute little guy with spunk.
I would rate him 8 on a 1-10 scale. Next was Ingram Hill, memphis favs, I have seen them before, and loved them everytime. This time was no exception. About two songs into their set, the sound/power went out. The crowd was sad, but the lead singer tried to entertain the crowd on his own. Barely hearing what he was saying, he starts to sing their newest hit ""Almost Perfect"". The crowd is eating this up, singing all the words along with him, as he smiles as big as the sun. He was loving it too. So 15-20 minutes later, the sound is back! He says he wants the crowd to feel like they got there moneys worth, so he sang it again. He also mentioned that in his professional career, that had to be the highlight. He is really awesome. 1-10?....I'd say a 10. Later was Gavin Degraaw, whom I love. He put on a great show as well. 9 out of 10. Mavis Staples came out next, and belted the crowd away! She rocked! A solid 9 I must say. And last but not least, we saw the Wallflowers. I must say, Jacob Dillion is strikingly handsome. As good of a band as they are, they don't really ""entertain"" the crowd, Jacob is a bit laid back. They were still very good. I'd say an 8.
Rain and all, fun was had by myself, and Heather."

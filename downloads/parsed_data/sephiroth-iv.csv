"event","Received an email with this last week and found it worthy of action:

Stop Bill HR875 (Food Safety Modernization Act of 2009) which will criminalize organic farming in the U.S. There is significant effort to move this Bill through Congress quickly before people are aware of what is happening. Under this Bill, the small, independent farmer, including backyard ones (because the language is so broad), could not possibly adhere to the stringent regulations in the Bill.  This Bill imposes fines of $500,000 and confiscation of animals and property if procedures are not followed and chemicals and drugs are not used.  If this Bill is passed, farmers would be told what to feed and how to medically treat the animals.  Additionally, heirloom seeds?those best suited for each area passed down by families from generation to generation?would be replaced with ?federally-sanctioned seeds? requiring toxic fertilizers and pesticides.

Bill HR875 was introduced by Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro whose husband Stanley Greenburg is a political consultant for Monsanto, a leading producer of herbicide glyphosate (""Roundup""), genetically-engineered seeds as well as developers and marketers of bovine growth hormone.  Additionally, Bill HR875 is backed by Monsanto and doesn?t actually mention the word ?organic? in it; therefore, it is extremely important to bring this to the attention of your representative.

The latest major action was April 23 and is now referred to the House subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy and Poultry. Take action now and contact your state representative via e-mail (www.congress.org) or phone at 202-224-3121 and ask them to oppose HR875 and related bills (S 425).  Ask friends and family to do the same.  The future of the food supply for us and future generations is at stake.

Spend 1 minute and 40 seconds to view this video clip for a quick summary: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epXNJNjYBvw or continue to research online.

For access to Bill HR875, especially Section 3-Definitions, the link is:  http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-875

With Gratitude, Health and Happiness -

Don't believe everything the mainstream media puts on the table. In fact, I highly suggest not trusting them at all. Raw uncut footage is always a good time.

This is one more reason why people really need to think about what they are saying before opening their, idiotic, mouths. They only hurt the cause as the media will look only at the fools during gatherings like this."

Educate yourself and as many people as you can. Stop making excuses for your ignorance and start doing something about it. Don't become dependent on others choosing your actions (and thoughts) for you. Start asking why and don't take ""because we said so"" as an answer. We mustn't become a slave of traditions, after all no progress is made if everything stays the same.

"event","It's funny in away. America votes for change and all it gets is another puppet. Why don't they just stop lying to us and put down what we really are voting for: 4 more years of Corporate Enslavement.

Look around, does this feel like freedom to you?

Victimless crimes are a form of revenue.

We are forced to pay for services we don't need.

We fear the fear itself.

Who are these people we put upon the pedestal and worship? Why are they so special? Why would you give up your rights to people you don't even know.

America has been taken hostage and is now suffering from Stockholm syndrome. These people rob us blind, bind us, and rape us and we speak so highly of them and we ask for more. All the while, we say how great it is to be free.

When were we ever free?

One things for certain, we will never get anywhere with the level of ignorance in this nation, no, this is far beyond our nation... This is the entire human race at this point.

Here in America we rather make laws to ""protect"" the ignorant rather than inform them. This is the most frustrating, asinine, way of dealing with an issue. Why should I have to suffer for other's shortcomings? Better yet why is it OK to be stupid?

No more excuses. Admit your failures and learn from them. Just because we are an imperfect race doesn't mean we should celebrate our shortcomings. Stop laying down for the weak and instead teach the weak how to be strong. This is the only road to freedom from stupidity, freedom from those who wish to take advantage of our ignorance, those who have taken us hostage...."

All we want is to get out of our skin for a while
We have nothing to lose because we don't have anything
Anything we want anyway...
We used to hate people
Now we just make fun of them
It's more effective that way
We don't live
We just scratch on day to day
With nothing but matchbooks and
Sarcasm in our pockets
And all we are waiting for
Is for something worth waiting for
Let's admit America gets the celebrities we deserve
Let's stop saying Don't quote me
Because if no one quotes you
You probably haven't said a thing worth saying
Sex, drugs, god, cash, America
We need something to kill the pain
Of all that nothing inside
We all just want to die a little bit
We fear that pop-culture
Is the only culture we're ever going to have
We want to stop reading magazines
Stop watching TV
Stop caring about Hollywood
But we're addicted to the things we hate
We don't run Washington and no one really does
Ask not what you can do for your country
Ask what your country did to you
Sex, drugs, god, cash, America
The only reason you're still alive is because someone
Has decided to let you live
We owe so much money we're not broke we're broken
We're so poor we can't even pay attention
So what do you want
You want to be famous and rich and happy
But you're terrified you have nothing to offer this world
Nothing to say and no way to say it
But you can say it in three languages
You are more than the sum of what you consume
Desire is not an occupation
You are alternately thrilled and desperate
Sky high and fucked
Let's stop praying for someone
To save us and start saving ourselves
Let's stop this and start over
Let's go out - Let's keep going
Sex, drugs, god, cash, America
This is your life - This is your fucking life
We need something to kill
The pain of all that nothing inside
Quit whining you haven't done
Anything wrong because frankly
You haven't done much of anything
Someone's writing down your mistakes
Someone's documenting your downfall

This ""stimulus package"" is a joke. It's not going to boost the economy because in turn it's devaluing the dollar even more. The Federal Reserve needs to stop printing money, and the government needs to cut funding to non-beneficial organizations. Withdraw the troops from the middle east and instead have them protect our borders therefore saving money by not hopelessly policing countries we don't own. Force large corporate organizations to pay their taxes, since it's what income tax is really supposed to be about and maybe we'll actually be able to pay off the national debt instead of adding to it. This is just some lame attempt for Bush to attempt to look good.

I'm so sick of hearing these ignorant words. Through the years I've heard many people utter these very words when someone actually decides to vote for the person they truly believe should be the next President of the United States of America. It's like a plague.

Let me put this in perspective for you, The only wasted vote is a vote for someone you do not truly want as a leader. Failure to do so is what is bringing our country to ruin. It's a matter of statistics, if everyone votes for who they think is going to win, and not who they want to win, the results of the vote are going to be obviously (and terribly) skewed.

It's time for you to think for yourself. Don't worry about who everyone else is voting for, focus on who you, and only you, really trust leading us for the next 4 years and beyond. Do some research into the candidates, this entails a little more than just watching the news, but, it doesn't take much time. This is for your benefit after all. If you aren't willing to help yourself don't expect anyone else to.

This is our country! Let's keep it that way!
Spread the word. Let this be the medicine that cures the plague of a country lead by ignorance and controlled by greed. Freedom is our responsibility to defend and uphold. Don't let anyone change that.

This is what causes distorted sound and sluggish performance. deleting the driver and reseting the BIOS restore your IDE back to being controlled by DMA the way they are meant to.</div>"

"event","""If a nation expects to be ignorant and free ... it expects what never was and never will be ...""
-Thomas Jefferson

Where am I going with this? You fools would rather lock yourself in a cage and throw away the key for a lackluster life of laziness rather than live educated and free. The world is a mess because of ignorance and all you care about is what's on tv at 7pm.

With ignorance come more undesirable traits like Greed, Jealousy, Laziness, Close Mindedness, Hatred, and Fear just to name a few.

The only way to get out of this hole is to start educating ourselves and stop being lazy (and ignorant). I leave you with a better quote.

""If you give a man a fish, he will have a meal.
 If you teach him to fish, he will have a living.
 If you are thinking a year ahead, sow a seed.
 If you are thinking ten years ahead, plant a tree.
 If you are thinking one hundred years ahead, educate the people.
 By sowing a seed once, you will harvest once.
 By planting a tree, you will harvest tenfold.
 By educating the people, you will harvest one hundredfold.""  
-ANONYMOUS CHINESE POET, 420 B.C."

Would you rather live in a land where your fear of events governs your way of life or would you rather have the knowledge of your surroundings guide you through life?"

"event","It's been awhile sense I've posted anything of real value on here, but I want to bring forward a severe problem in this country: The lack of formal driver training. Imagine the disaster that would happen if we gave pilots a rulebook, a really short flight test and then handed them a card and said, ""You're ready to fly!""

""Why is driver training an important invest for America?"", you might ask. In a country where cars are depended upon heavily it'd be nice to know that all the other drivers out there are fit to drive, wouldn't it? Well it's obviously not the case. As an example, the first day it snowed this season I counted at least 6 vehicles on I-91 spun around in the center median at different places This was within 10 mins maybe less and there was less than 1 inch of snowfall. The first car i spotted was a Jeep Wrangler which is, obviously, a capable vehicle in the snow (if you know how to use it). I got off I-91 shortly after almost being struck by someone in Expedition. All these accidents could have been avioded if the person driving knew exactly how to operate the car they were driving.

Now here's the root of the problem, this people were never taught how to drive, they were taught the rules (if that!) and handed the keys. Most people don't know the basics of automobile handling. I'm going to cut to the chase it's plain as day that it's a problem and here's how to solve it: Mandatory driver training in schools that actually teaches you the logistics of driving a car, what to inspect on your car frequently, and what to do during emergency situations, not just how to obey the law. Start this early in a child's life too. Despite several reports of lawmakers wanting to raise the legal driving age to lower accidents. Believe me this is the last thing we really need. The reason why Teens crash so much is because they lack experience in driving. Raising the legal age is just going to push the age of people who crash up because they are still going to be just as inexperienced. Even more so because the older you get the harder it is for you to learn. If kids start learning how to drive at a younger age they'll be more capable at driving, not to mention their progress can be tracked easier making it easier to judge weather or not they are ready to hit the road or require more training or, perhaps, aren't capable of operating a motor vehicle at all. Most of all Responsibility will be learned, something that many of my fellow Americans have lost sight of, as of late."

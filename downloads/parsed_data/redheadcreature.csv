"event","I saw a commercial last weekend while at my sister's house.  It was a pesticide commercial.  It was used to kill the grubs in the earth that will ruin your lawn.  Amazing.  

We have these commmercials about pharmaceutical drugs.  They now have them regulated that you have to say what the side effects are.  Now I know everyone has seen these commercials, because we all talk about them...they're so comical.  

So my thoughts are thus:  If we had to regulate the commercials about what the side effects of the pesticides are on us and the environment on a longterm basis, what the hell would we do?  I think we would come up with something else to use!  that's what I think.   

But will it happen?  I don't know.  but damn it's disturbing to me...what they all get away with.  You know what's even more interesting, is that the pesticides are usually made by the same comany that is making the pharmaceutical drugs...now how's that for thought!!  Side effects, we get them every single damn minute!!!!"

"event","I went to a sweet party last night.  We had fun chillin and talking about life and what you want to do with it.  I'm so glad that I met LIppy and all my other friends.  

I'm trying to get a hold of my friend Amber...but she hasn't checked her blog yet...ahhh girl...if you knew I sent you a message, you would kick yourself for not checking it sooner.  It's kind of like my message from U Albany.  They sent me a message to go to the interview for grad school and I didn't check it until the day before the interview.  Luckily it was still in time to say yes, but damn, if I had seen it earlier...how happier I would have been for the week!!!

Must go back to practice piano.  I'm learning the waltz.  I know the rhytm in my head, but that doesn't mean it's easy when you practice it.  It takes so much time.  I will get it!!!!


Cheers,

But now i have decided that pink underneath all the black is a good idea.  Yes, pink.  No one will see the pink...did i mention that i look really good in all black...it goes nice with my hair...hehehee

"event","Yesterday I was in a bad place.  I was not having a good week for many reasons.  This morning I woke up and went for a walk to think about things.  

I came to a few decisions:  The only way to be happy in this country and not feel like you are working for the ""man"" is to have your own business.  I think that the companies that are outsourcing to other countries are making all the money.  Small and owning your own business is where it's at.  If we could take the power out of them, then we can have the power back as a country.  Face it folks, the politicians are paid via us, but only because we support those big businesses.  If we want a change, then we have to do it ourselves, because no one is going to do it for us.  

So many people work minimum wage jobs to make ends meet and they work to live.  THat's not fair, but it's happening all the same. 

Then again, our education system is not set up for us to learn very well.  What is there motivation for when all the jobs are going to other countries anyways?  

So we must educate ourselves and take our country back by having our own businesses.  

That's me venting, and being sick and tired of working for someone else and not going after my dreams.  I am going to go after them and I say go after yours as well.  If we don't have our dreams and don't go after them, what is the point in living?  there is none.  So live and live well.  Besides, in the end, would you rather to have been happy and gone after your dreams, or to have just wasted it all?

"event","I was dreaming last night.  I actually had 3 distinct dreams.  I can't quite recall the first one.  But the other 2 are still somewhat vivid.  I was walking in this wasteland with Tom. Tom being a co-worker of mine.  Very nice guy.  has 2 children.  My sister launa was there and Sammy.  so there were creatures following us and we had to run and hide.  it was darker and darker, but all was well.  This went on for some time...

then my other dream was about a woman.  I was going to kiss her.  But then we got separated.  I kept looking for her and this group called the SCA was there.  An event was taking place.  I kept asking about her and every place i went to she would be gone.  I ran into people from high school and it was just more strange.  Then i woke up.  

I will have to call this female friend of mine and see how she is doing.  Then i'll see how my co-worker is doing as well as his children...life has been happening to them...not it's not always good.

THere's a contest in January.  I'll see how it goes.  I just don't know that i trust him.  I think he's interested in more than music, but I'm not up for that.  I have other things to do and he would just be a nuisance.

hmmm, still building my website.  I am going to add some of my music to it.  I'm excited!!

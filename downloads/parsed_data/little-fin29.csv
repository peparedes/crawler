The only thing I wish to change would be seeing more of my friends. But I've been hanging out with Johnners a lot and that's pretty cool, no <strong>really</strong> cool ;) I just got back from Las Vegas and it was HOT. Almost 116 everyday. I saw John Monday night for the first time in 10 1/2 days, and he suprised me with flowers. Gosh I love him =) Yesterday we had dance; part if the ""two day"" and we had a lot of fun. Today I cleaned the basement for my madre and layed outside man is it hot! I really wish I had a car so I could drive ANYWHERE I wanted to, oh well in <strong>4 months</strong>!!! Yea. So yea well more later but for now&nbsp;see ya'll<br /><br /><br />&lt;3 Em<br />xoxoxo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/little_fin29/pic/00002c1s/""></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></font><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/little_fin29/pic/00002c1s/""></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></font>"

"event","I guess that i have to post somthing on the fights going on between friends right now. I'm not following any one, I dont think this is the cool thing to do (""this"" being writing livejournal entries about friends fighting). I just want to help friends...

<center> <b> As many of you can probably remember back to Tommy's party?? That was such a good night, everyone was having fun and being friends untill the drama broke out. And this highschool drama is wrecking all of your friend ships. It seems like no matter where I turn everyone is fighting, or posting livejournal entries about eachother. I dont understand it, why cant people just get along??? I remember at the beginging of last summer and this year everyone used to hang out in one big group, now people have broke off into sub groups (or thats what it seems like to me). If everyone could just understand that a friendship is an important thing, i think that we would all get along better. I know that im just posting this for no reason because no one reads my EL JAY...If you do read this, try to understand, be the better person and appologize to your so called ""enemy"" or ""back stabber"". do it you need to.

I dropped alex off and talked to emily, we were going to the mall with eric and anna. when the time came, i picked her up at Victory and we drove to my house, then to the shoe store, and i returned my shoes for cash cus they sucked. After we met up with eric and anna at the mall. it was a prettty good time. We saw shawnee, tiff, matt, ellie there. they looked like they were having a good time, but we tried to stay away cus we really didnt wanna talk to them. Emily and anna, ( i do have to say) are insane shoppers, theyy see somthing and they grab it like vicious dalmations on a bone or somthing!!!! ahha!!
Emily bougt  new converse, a back pack, and a GUINT hat that is pretty cool. I forgot what anna bought. Eric and i bout drinks and pretzles mmmmm good. after the mall emily and i went to nuberrys to buy new back packs and try on goofy sunglasses haha!!!  we got lost listening to john lennon, but we finnaly found the sad cafe, and we went to see TBM but we ended up leaving, coming to my house and eating alot, then we took some pictures ( see below) and went on the computer....it was wicked fun the whole time and i know that all the people i hung out with are really good friends im so glad to have them!!! next weekend is probably gonna be just as good cus im going sking with emily and anna on saterday!!!

"event","<B> the weekend is finaly here. yes! Today there was a snow day, and i swear, so many people posted or said stuff like "" Today was the BEST day ever!!!"" So i guess it was!?!? I woke up at 9:00 and decided to do the drive way  with the snow thrower, because im cool like that. Then i came inside, ate  a breakfast, took a shower, called a mom, and got a lecture on why i couldnt go snowboarding with mike, I ended up going to Alex The Preists house with connor, jess townsend, and gilly (he was there for about 2 minutes). We went sleding at pinkerton ( so i guess i did really go to school). Afterwords we went back, had a mini jam session, then it was time to go home. I got home and I talked to Emily DiLo. 
Emily is a really good friend, I get along with her really good, 
and shes easy to talk to which is another good thing to.
 I think we talked for about an hour about everything.
Which is good because i havent talked to her in like 4444 years. 
We will be driving to The Sad Cafe on saterday together to see HARPER play. I love harper.
Ive never been in a car with "" THE TWINS "" , so this should be neat, 
 
I got ready for Ski Club tommorrow and now im here. 

WEEKEND PLANS

Friday: School, Skiclub, Sleeping at moms

Saterday: Dads, Nothing, Picking up the twins and going to see harper

Sunday: NOTHING

I went to go pick him up at like 12 in the after noon and we ended up staying at his dads recording studio, helping his dad with recording some songs. After that i drove to mikes house and we picked up his clothes. Then we came to my house to drop his stuff off and we thought we were meeting eric st cyr to go to a party in manchesster but i guess that fell through so we went to <3Sams<3 house and chilled there for a bit and then we went to tiff's house but that was fucking gay cus i guess thats what you get for liking a 14 year old fresh man, what ever thats over so im glad. After tiffs we went to Wendys and did some cool shit there was this dog and its name was pookie and it was like 2 months old. We met up with matt and amanda there and we smoked up, it was great. There was this miget that had like a bottle of jack daniles and she was fucking trashed and she was puking all over the floor and she was making these noises that sounded like The Incredible Hulk.  And Every one was so chill there..  Mike and  Matt Klaw fought last night it was supposto be body shots but it ended up with mike punching matt in the face twice.
 Mikes fucking crazy.

"event","<center> ""Whatever happened to going to shows for the music? 
For the feeling you get when you are surrounded by kids that are all into the same thing? 
These shows are set up for kids like us who dont belong anywhere else. 
Obviously if you start some shit then you better be able to finish it, but by no means is something like this necessary. 
If you have a problem with someone then take care of it yourself. 
Its time we start embracing this so called ""scene"" and stop ripping it apart by severely beatin kids and shutting down venues. 
This goes out to everyone When you walk through the doors to a show, unless your heart and mind are open then you dont belong at all in fact you arent welcome. ""
- This Was A  Direct Quote From Danny Of A loss for words

And I agree, the music isnt about 2 sepping or moshing!!! You go to a show to support your local or favorite band. I Dont like to go into school and see my friends (espically girls), bruised and broken from ""the crazy mosh at the show last night""...Im sick of it, and im not directing this torwards any specific type of music, just ingeneral, so many of my friends are getting beat up and hit in the mosh or two step. No More Of This We really dont need it. we NEed to just be friendly....If you agree to what im trying to say then please comment, because there are kids in the hospital with brain diseases and fucked up skulls, from ass holes that like to kick kids asses.

 Why do people go to shows again? oh yeah, I forgot, to see the band they like and have fun and look up to who ever is on stage. I hope I am not the only kid that still looks forward to that when I purchase a ticket to a show. I don't expect this journal to create some huge movement, i dont expect it to change a thing, its simply my thoughts written down for everyone on here to see, please comment on this with brutal honesty on your thoughts, for or against mine. By the way this journal entry was not directed toward any specific ""scene"" it was directed towards everyone.

People pushing through their mittens as i was beginning to feel it soaking through my shoes,

"event","oh man last night (semi night) was the best night of my life,
I picked  up cady at 530 and then we drove to my house for pictures.
it was abou six fourty five when we left my house for semi, we waited for about 30 mintues and then i remembered that we  needed our id's for the dance!!!!
Cady didnt have hers so we called corey, eric, xtina, anna and asked them if they could pick hers up, they were already in derry and they had to get theirs too, so i went back to cadys and we werre there for like ten minutes and she came out and we sped back to derry 
(literally the whole time i was doing 60 in a 30 zone!!!) 

And we finnally got to pinkerton at like 7:58 (2 minutes to spare to get to the semi!!!) We sprinted into the Shepard building as quick as we could and got there right on time!

It was really prettty and stuff in the shepard auditorium.....and we danced for like 3 hours straight. it was so fun i danced with like everyone. 
So we get outta semi at like 10:15 and Corey R. , Xtina, Cady, Eric, DeRek, TOmmy, ME, and ANNA all went to  APPLE BEES for a reservation for Eight people under the name KEVIN ( me). and to find out that they dont do reservaitons so we waited for like 10 minutes untill the girl finnaly seated us. We got smoking section which was pretty cool cus ive never smoked in a resturant before. That was really fun and then we gott outta there at like 11:30 and the three cars drove back into hampstead (3 cars meaning my car, erics car, and dereks car)  So we drove to tommys house and waited there for like 10 mintues and i drove cady to her house to get some junk so she could sleep over  Xtinas house) I drove to Xtinas house and then drove to my house with eric) 

LAST NIGHT WAS DEFFENETLY THE GREATEST NIGHT OF MY LIFE SO FAR!!!!!!!

it was so fucking awsome i loved every minute of it, begining to end.

"event","Wow, could my day get any more busier?  I have had soo much to take care of today, hard to tell, but for me it was soo much.  Imagine aiding for a 1st grade class.  Can you see what I am getting at?  Today they had a movie day.  Something that takes place at the end of the year.  Well today it just happened to rain in buckets.  So I had to get dressed and out the door, alot of good that did me, I ended up getting soaked to the bone.  And then I got soaked again on my way back to the school.  We all went to see Because of Winn Dixie.  That is one of boringest movies I have ever seen.  Try showing that to a bunch of 1st graders.  Good moral, just not a good pick.  Personally Madagascar would have been a better movie to see.  Then I did some stupid stuff like dance to the YMCA and other 60's songs.  Talk about loosing it?!?!?!!?  Well, the kids ended up getting attached to me and I feel bad about not getting to see them again, especially after spending 1 week with them.  Not to mention that I miss my friends.  Its hard not getting up and going to see them at school everyday.  Calling would be the best thing to do but I am not much of a phone talker, so thats a drawback.  Plus the seniors are graduating today and I wish I could be there because my babe, Greg, is graduating and so is my best friend's brother.  I guess that is all I can think of right now, so I will go and that will be the end of my day."

"event","Not too much happening today, Just spending the day at home which is a first.  Really it is!  I spend my Sundays outside my four walls.  I haven't done anything today.  I just went to Wal Mart, and ate all day, and spent my butt in front of the computer.  I have had a pretty lethargic day.  I am just on the phone with Brendan.  Thats basically my day, so I pretty much did close to nothing."

"event","<font color=""#ff6600"">okok,i have to make this one quick as i'd be startin on cts(common test)tomorrow. <br /><br />today is just another for me and that is my birthday for me.hahaha.it was a normal sunday for me.everything seems the same.anyway,since i have been busy the for past few months(high life,bali trip,preparin for cts,etc)i almost forgot about my birthday.believe it or not,i only managed to remember it 3 days before today.and because of this,i started to wonder once again about this very day which everyone of us celebrates once a year.well,as you all can see,it's becoming a pretty insignificant day of my life.(no celebration)haha........hmmmm,dunno whether i am suppose to laugh.but yeah,that's the truth,folks. <br /><br />to justify myself about today,i believe i should show to y'all what happened today.started off the day on darren's sofa.hahaha.slept there after an overnight grueling muggin session with jason and brandon.after that,brandon sent me home.went to wash up and then,made my way down to church.went through the same service which i go through every week.a few people wished me,and after awhile i realised that i was alone all by myself.so i decided to go back home to finish up my revision.when i was at home,stuart came to collect some econs notes from me.chatted for awhile,then i realised that i haven't had any meal at all for the whole day.that was at around 3 in the afternoon.being mr nice guy,stuart offered to treat me lunch.haha.so of,we went to thomson plaza.received a call from mommy dearest-she said she almost forgot that i was my birthday.the only thing she was feeling was the need to cook some mee-sua.it's been a tradition in my family to cook and enjoy a bowl on every of our birthday.so told me,she only realised it when she saw the calender.lol.anyway,i had burger king at thomson plaza.then i went back home for a nap before meeting brandon at sgcc(serangoon garden cc) for a muggin session.so there i was in serangoon garden.on my way there,selwyn told me that shah and co were there.so i decided to go to meet them before the muggin session.met shuming on the way,walkin happily with her friend.just an exchange of hi-bye and she's off.when i met the guys(shah,beng,ken foo,thad teo),we chatted again for a while.they were oblivious to the day's occasion initially(maybe the jommin sessions are burnin their memory cells.hahahaha.just kiddin).after prompted by brandon,thad teo realised what it was-only then everybody realises.lol.after awhile,we ran out of topic to talk about and realised that it's pretty close to 7.i told them to join me for dinner givin the incentive that it's on me.so off we went to powsing restaurant.ate our dinner then went back to sgcc for a muggin session.stayed there til 11 then i went back to get my stuff before coming over to brandon's house for an overnight.now,i am in brandon's room,typing this thing out. <br /><br />throughout the course of today,quite a bit of smses obtained.some were quite surprising.those whom i dun expect to know about today,actually dropped an sms.but the more surprising thing is that-some of my tight-buddies were not on that list in my inbox.but then again,i dun reallie care as it's just another day in history.haha. <br /><br />well,maybe,if anyone of you come across this entry and are bothered to read it,you might wanna help me out with meaning of birthday.is it a day that is so overrated that you're compelled to do something special when it comes every year?</font>"

"event","<p><font color=""#ff0000"" size=""3"">hello,it's been quite a long time since i last blog.i think the&nbsp;reason why&nbsp;it took me&nbsp;such long time to update this blog is simply because i am not into bloggin or maybe just simply putting my thoughts into words is somewhat too demanding for me.or maybe i am just too bloody lazy these days.haha.anyway,yeah,i must say that i have been really unproductive and&nbsp;unmotivated lately.i really haven't achieve anything much in school,club,church,etc.have been such a <strong>BUMMER </strong>all these while.hahaha.<br /><br />but really,i don't think i can afford to be&nbsp;one hell of a <strong>BUMMER </strong>this year simply because i have a lot more to lose relative to other years.moreover,it's my last year of singapore school education.so,between making it and breaking this year-i would rather make it because having to go through so many years of hardship here, it's really not worth it to screw up on the last stretch.the finishing line is just in front and i would only have to tahan a few more months.come to think of it,the end is really damn near-3 months to mid-year,5 months to prelim and about 7-8 months more to a-level.besides that,i dun think i would wanna disappoint my parents and my teachers as well as my close friends who've been motivatin me like crazy.haha.so yeah,i betta pull up my damn freakin socks.<br /><br />however,i dun think my current-self could&nbsp;achieve this transformation overnight.therefore,i believe that i&nbsp;have to continuously rely on God for his wisdom and strength in order to reach the finishing line in one piece.i really have to get my life back on track and continue my walk back with him once again.He has never fail me as a Saviour or just as a&nbsp;day-to-day friend.He has also been guarding me and&nbsp;watching me throughout my life as a loneranger in&nbsp;singapore.likewise,i dun think i should fail him and most of all,i really think i&nbsp;should thank Him for&nbsp;improvin my back and allowin me to&nbsp;be back onto the field.<br /><br />i know for sure that it's not gonna be easy to get back in action or making the first step to ingite this engine&nbsp;of mine.i would also need to keep it&nbsp;running for as long as it takes so that i could finish the race and&nbsp;i would also have to constantly rely on&nbsp;Him for fuel and comfort in this last stretch of the journey.furthermore,i have to keep all those distractions away and concentrate in keeping my path straight towards the finishing mark.<br /><br />anyway,when i called back home yesterday-my dad reiterated all those reminders to me.so i guess i should work my ass off from now on.anyway,he has given a few incentives as well,so i guess i should try to work for those incentives as well.haha.<br /><br />okie dock,i think that's enough for today,i gotta start the process of ""turning over a new leaf"" now.wish me luck.and let's hope/pray that everything that i have mentioned above would materialise.and also to&nbsp;be able to&nbsp;keep this blog alive.i'll try my best to&nbsp;update this&nbsp;journal whenever i am inspired to.haha.<br /><br />that's all folks..cheers<br /><br /><br /></font></p>"

"event","it's been a long time since i last updated this journal.i realised that in most of my entries,i've been bitchin-so i believe it should be time to say some good things.but too bad i have to start by saying something which is pretty distressing

         took blue-slip from skool today to see the doctor.left skool at one plus then went straight down to NUH to see ass.prof.HeeHwanTak.on the way there,saw this skool bus which come from Bhavan Indian International School.hahaha.didn't noe that bhavan own a skool.somebody damn famous la,got a bus which carries your name.comin back to the meetin with the doctor.i went to see him for a second opinion.but then i still hear the same old-depressin news from him.wahlan,my heart sank just now la,when he told me that i could no longer play rugby.shucks,try putting yourself on my shoes.was the most painful news to hear la since rugby has become my second nature.it was painful,i must say.my whole heart just shattered within me.i went to the toilet as soon as i got out of the consultation room just now.went there,locked myself up in the handicap toilet and i just started to cry.i was ponderin to myself-why must this injury popped out at this kinda time.the upcomin season is an ultra challenging battle.but somehow,it looks like i am already down even before i could fight the battle.moreover,i have to take up quite a big responsibility within the team

         after that depressin news,i went to see the chiropractor recommended by Uncle SengCheong,my sunday school teacher.ass.prof actually discourage me from going to see a chiropractor.probably,he doesn't have any faith in the local chiropractors.but nonetheless,i still went down to his clinic at capitol building.well,to tell you the truth i was kinda feelin kinda skeptical when i was on my way to see him.my auntie who was with me even asked whether i'm aware of my decision and the consequences involved.but somehow,in that time of uncertainty,God came and knocked my heart.i started to pray.i ask God whether seeing Dr.Terence(chiropractor) was what He wants me to do.out of the blue,He provided me with his blessed assurance.

         Uncle SengCheong told me that this guy could be trusted and i should be confident of his treatment.he was also attending paya lebar methodist church.after only being inside his clinic for 5 mins,i was already feelin very confident of his knowledge and treatment.he's different from any other doctor and ass.prof.he sounded optimistic and adopted a very conservstive kind of treatment for me.unlike the rest who suggested surgery.i manage to regain my courage in that room and i am now more determine to solve this injury(slip-disc)so that i could be able to get back onto the playin field and fight for the glory of God.i'm sure that his guidance would always leads me.i came out of his clinic as a changed man.i'm now more optimistic and i now have the faith that one day i could make a return and continue to play ruby to the best of my ability.

         when i looked back on what happened today there is only one verse in the bible that could come in handy for those of you who are facing a certain kind of problem.be it BGR,sickness or just simply exhausted by the your daily activities. 
""Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and i will give you rest""Matt 11:28"

"event","woohoo,finally got my cup-cake from chuin.19 days after my b'day.hahaha.haven't actually taken a bite on it coz i'm still fasting,sia.bet it's gonna be extremely 'shiok'.oh ya,and i find it ultra amusing that people only start to give me my b'day present long after my actual b'day.for eg,yesterday,i received some presents from people like liyana/nana,denise/deedee,and shuming/mingming.and for some random reson,today was the beginning of french revolution a long long time ago.we could see people at skool freeloading the free chocolate fondue and cheese prepared by some jokers from some random organisation.then when skool ended today,my brother went to meet up with miss ngin.still couldn't figure out what the hell they were discussin about la since they could only touch on some topics.but what the heck,they took damn long la.hope that it wasn't something bad man.fingers-cross

must be wonderin why is today's subject entitled 'bloody thursday'.well,it's blood donation drive today.my first time donating blood-i must say that it's quite an experience.lost arnd 300ml of blood but i guess it's beneficial to others after all.basket,pek wa damn worried just now la.was scared that i would faint coz i'm still fasting.but,somehow,i'm still standing strong rite now.eh-i'm actually sitting down now......haiz....somethin like that la."

"event","<P><FONT color=#00cccc>It was my birthday yesterday and i believe i should give thanks for everything that went on yesterday(eventhough it wasn't the best day of my life)Well,i concluded yesterday by being ultra bitchy.I was complaining about all the nitty-gritty thingy that i wasn't happy about.Thank God,there were still people who were there to lend me their listening ear/s.Or else,i would be looking like a moron.Haha.I would also like to thank God for Pek.She's always been there for me whenever i need her and most importantly she's always willing to listen and understand my situation.Without her,i think i would&nbsp;be the most distress bugger&nbsp;in the whole of 368 Thomson&nbsp;Rd.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00cccc>Hmmm,spent my day going out for lunch with her yesterday.We went to&nbsp;Crystal Jade @ Holland V.She handed me my first present of the day&nbsp;during lunch.What can i say about it?I think it's damn thoughtful&nbsp;and meaningful.After lunch,we walked around for a lil' bit then i sent her off to Sean's house.After&nbsp;dropping her,i&nbsp;continued the journey down to YCK stadium where i played the squad from SAFSA.Being the underdog,we still lost.haha.42-5.But again,i should thank God for his protection.I didn't get any serious injury other than the usual bruises and cuts.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00cccc>I went back home with Just after the game to wash up.We,then went over&nbsp;to Tiff's 18th birthday party at Fort Canning Park-the worst expirience of my life.No doubt,i enjoyed the food but try to imagine celebrating other people's birthday instead of yours,when it's not even her real birthday that night.The crappy kind of feeling only tend to worsen by the minute,especially when she's about to cut her cake.I couldn't even summon enough energy to even open my mouth and sing her a birthday song.I felt that something was missing in my life last nite.Family?Close friends????i dunno wat?just something.Feel kinda empty,u know....But somehow i gotta thank God once again for allowing a friend to cheer me up yesterday.Firas and i left the party and then went down to Swensens in town.He bought me a birthday cake from Swensens,It was the most ridiculous thing that happened yeterday la.haha.It's friggin weird la.Eventhough it's weird or ridiculous,i'd still wanna thank God.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00cccc>Everytime i feel really crappy,God has always been so faithful to me.He will never let any of his sheeps astray......Thank You God for Everything.And i would like to apologise to all my friends for my perpetual whining and for a being a contant pain in their ass.Be it good pain or bad pain.</FONT></P>

"event","sigh......i'm really shag from today's hash run.it's particularly longer than usual.i think it's at least 15 kilo today.Moreover,it was raining cats and dogs so i was soaking wet by the time i got back into the circle.thank God all the runners came back safely because the lightning came perpetually.well,today i ran alone because my dad wasn't around-he went out of town to check out the project site.

my dad left at dawn(4.30 a.m.)and that's damn friggin early la so i didn't manage to bid him farewell.i was only up at 8 then went out for breakfast with my mom before picking my auntie up at the airport.by now,i think,i can conclude that today was another unproductive day.sigh.

human beings never run out of problems.it is as if our whole life revolves around them.as i took time to ponder just now,i came to realise how painful the truth actually is.it is only when it hit you hard,then u realise.why are human beings so stubborn?i've been thinking about alot of things during this last few days and they're taking up the spaces in my brain and i guess i'm gonna be mentally exhausted really soon.really need those extra power to continue and fight this battle.i know that my family and i gotta be strong in order to last the storm.the presence of the 3rd party has also given a heavier load to the problems and it is only making things worst.

i'm not asking God to do magic but i think my whole family really need those strength.i'm also prayin that whoever who is a fault can come to realisation and at least try to change so that the whole situation will improve."

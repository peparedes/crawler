If you can't see (m)any updates on this page, I can only say this:  ""Go figure.  You're not on my friends list.""  I am actually quite the prolific updater, believe it or not.

Sorry if this is an inconvenience for anyone.  And I don't think it will be.  If you're meant to read this journal, you're most likely already reading it.  If you feel slighted and believe that you too should be permitted to read all about my eccentricities, post your complaint and we'll see what happens.  In most cases, I will add you back if I know you or like you.  So it is written, and so it shall be done.


Ahh, life."

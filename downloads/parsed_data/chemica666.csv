"event","Seems like my belly button piercing is finally healed. 
And not a moment too soon- it's been five freakin' months!!!!
I think I'm turned off piercings for good now. As much as i'd love to get a chin stud or a lip ring, i just can't imagine that thing festering in the middle of my face for that long. YUCK!!!

Tattoo's, however, are a whole other story. I do plan to get another one for my b-day- I already have my ""quota"", as in I know what i want and where. I just have to decide in which order to get them."

And what about that colossal book megamall i've heard about??
I figure if I'm gonna do shopping, THIS of all places is where i want to do it. To hell with boots. I figure there are enough overpriced demonias to fulfill my heart's desire over here. 

As for a good selection of english books...well, let's just say my luggage risks to be very heavy on the way back.
And needless to say i will be very very broke. 

So just unleash me in a bookstore and watch the money melt."

"event","Spent a nice calm weekend with Richard... we ended up going to see House of Flying Daggers at last!! Great movie, despite some flashbacks from crouching tiger and co. but who says that's a bad thing? i love how the emphasis is on the chinese culture in these movies, rather than some americanized love story. Better good movies that are alike than bad ones. 
 However word of warning to all you movie gourmets out there: if you want to see any ""good"" movie don't go on a saturday night!! I do not mean to be prejudiced against yo's here... oh who am i kidding, i AM 100% prejudiced against yo's here!! but stereotypes exist for a reason. This particularly annoying group was sitting about two seats away from us and they kept talking THE WHOLE TIME. the one closest to me actually started yakking on his cell at one point... leaving me no choice than to gather my courage, poke him in the back and tell him to shut up. LULU POWER!!! although really, some people should be banned from seeing the good movies... let them watch the last vin diesel masterpiece instead. movie theaters should set an IQ limit as well as an age limit or something like that. All in favor raise your hands...."

"event","<P>DISCLAIMER: those are just random thoughts that are going through my mind. i am not implying any specific people. Any resemblance to actual couples living or dead....</P>
<P>___________________________</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Acutally, this should be about couples in general, not just GOTH couples.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To put it simply: there is too much emphasis on physical attraction. in a couple, physical attraction is not even the tip of the iceberg; it's a puny little snowflake sitting on top of the tip of the iceberg!!!!&nbsp; So the two people meet, find each other very attractive, and click sexually. They're so glad that they fnally found someone who lives up to their high standards that they're happy to proclaim themselves a ""couple"". But, like <lj user=""sistersacrilege"" /> said in replying to my previous post, there has to be ""something more""; SUBSTANCE, or an emotional connection. As soon as the two mutually attracted lovebirds realize that there isn't ""something more"", physical attraction only doesn't keep them together for long; they stay lovers at most. Like the song goes: ""I'm not in love, but i'm gonna fuck you till somebody better comes along"". (who HASN'T quoted it in a frustrated heartbroken post at some point??)&nbsp;Let's say a person is looking for someone with a certain personality AND a certain look. That person might find both, but the chances that it's the same person are slim. (Beauty corrupts... but that's a whole other topic). What the person CAN do is find someone with the look (as looks are, unfortunately, more ""in your face"") and, as the halo effect goes, attribute to that person the qualities they are looking for. But as i said above, this illusion shatters in a matter of weeks. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, i am not saying that appearance is meaningless. sociological studies show for a fact that it matters; there is the looking glass self, meaning that we act depending on the feedback we receive from others. And yes, i suppose you COULD form a deep conection with someone you picked up at the meat market, if you're willing (and you know HOW) to see past their looks.&nbsp;&nbsp;I envy (in a good way) all those out there who can do it. As for me, I'm working on it... 
<P>That's about it. Feel free to share your opinions. Et je suis desolee s'il y en a qui se sentent vises... ;)</P>

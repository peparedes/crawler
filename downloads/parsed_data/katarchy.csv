"event","to my beautiful snails, I'm sorry you died. I'm sorry if I was a bad pet owner, and for unintentionally putting you in harm's way. I'm pretty sure my fish killed and ate you, although the fish guy said it'd be okay. I'm not really sure of any other reason that you'd be dead. So, I apologize for that. You brought me a lot of joy in the short time you spent with me. I enjoyed watching you crawl around the tank, and delighted in finding you when you hid. The yellow shelled snail, you were a bit flashier and at times my favorite, but the ram's horn shelled snail had his endearing qualities as well. I'm going to miss you guys. I'm really really really sorry you died. 
Love,
jesi"

All the world comes crashing, world comes crashing down on me.

The news is a distorted view through someone else's glasses,
Reprinted for the masses and so I killed my TV.

And are you the type to let yourself get scared?
We all go swimming naked, or at least strip to our underwear,
Am I the type to miss you when I'm gone?
Well I guess it won't be that long...

Driving to strange places,
Seeing even stranger faces and am I the type to let myself complain?
Everything's so foreign and so I plug my guitar into a broken amplifier
I am happy, I am sane and I am growing every day in every single way...

And I'm feeling so free,
I will sing my victory song.

check it out! 


Did you ever want to be a trucker? Did you ever wonder how life would be on the open road? Now you can find out if you have what it takes to be an OTR trucker without having to get a special license or endorsements.

Trukz (pronounced ""Trucks"") is a text based trucking simulation game where you create your driver, buy yourself a truck, then earn money by hauling loads to and from various cities around the USA, Canada, Mexico, Central America, and numerous countries in and around Europe. Each city has its own distinct supplies and demands that update throughout the game.

With the cash that you earn for successful deliveries you can buy upgrades to improve your truck, purchase various items for your driver, and eventually even buy a brand new truck.
	
Game play is simple but addicting. Real-life driver issues, including fatigue, diesel fuel prices, weather, speeding tickets, and driving overloaded come into play so there is always something that demands your attention. Trukz incorporates realistic climates and weather patterns that make driving in severe weather a challenge. Trukz also offers unique driving opportunities by allowing players to haul cargo to unique locations such as nuclear and hazardous waste to Yucca Mountain Nevada. 

Don't want to be an independent operator? No problem! Cooperate with other drivers by creating or joining companies to receive customizable assistance with repair fees, fuel costs, and even ticket fees. Complete your route on time and cities will begin paying you more money for each cargo that you deliver as your driver rating increases for each successful route completed on time. Arrive late and not only will you pay a penalty but your driver rating will decrease as well.

Your route dashboard, as pictured below, allows you to review all of your route details and even keep a visual eye on your fuel levels and travel speeds. Cities pay you money based on your driver skill rating, cargo type, and mileage so the more you work the more money you make. As you gain more money in the game purchase newer and faster trucks to stay ahead of the competition. See the New Player Guide for more information to get started playing Trukz.

"event","i can't remember this movie's name, and I've tried searching the obvious words I can associate with it, but I've come up with nothing.

i've talked about this movie with other people but nobody seems to know the name of it, even though I found a few people that have seen it.

Ok, details I remember: I believe it was on the Sundance Movie channel a few years ago (3 years ago? it could have also been IFC perhaps). 

Anyways, it was a movie about young adults in their 20's-30's that worked in an office that was inside of a mall-type place that also had housing/apartments. They make a bet to see who can go the longest without going outside for anything. They start going a little crazy- one person thinks the air is tainted & they can't breathe it anymore, they have to go outside, so he/she tries to sneak out in a garbage bin so as to not lose the bet. 

Any of this ringing a bell?

I want to watch it again but I can't fucking figure out the title. As an independent film, there weren't any notable actors that I can remember to try to look it up on IMDB. I've also tried browsing titles of Sundance films, but can't find anything that way either.


Thanks for any help in advance!!!!!"

"event","ok if you are interested in the following please respond and i will get you hooked up with this dude. He is starting a website and basically is putting out a call for BANDS or SMALL LABELS that are willing to put up music on a website for EXPOSURE. He is a cool guy and I wanted to help him out so let me know if you're interested and I'll give him your contact info. Respond w/ your name & email if possible.

Here is some info he gave me about this project:
- we are initially an apparell company, that is where we are going to be receiving our main source of income until we can get the other programs started 

- right off the bat, we will have hopefully 10 + bands, artists, DJ's, ect posted on the website with their music, pics, and bios of the individuals or bands. 

- after initial launch, we will have a recording studio that we will also have linked to our site 

- our rough goal at this point is to be able to promote for local labels, recording studios and bands, and try to connect the bands with the studios, and get their music in front of labels to listen to. we will promote pretty much anywhere that people gather. 

-right now, we have 51 members and growing that will work on getting names out, and for a start, that's alot of bodies. 

-all we're pretty much asking for now is an agreement where no cash is involved, and all we do is promote bands and labels, and ask that they promote our clothing."

"event","I am waiting 'til there's nothing left 
I'm a prayer, all you see is breath 
I am empty, I am skin and bones, I'm a ribcage 
Well, I'm out the door with apathy 
But I'm coming home with sympathy
I am realized, I am shamed, I choose to stay here

You got a sign, so I paid the ransom
You felt sorry, so I felt the wrath come
Had a nice grip on my life 'til you twisted my arm
My arm 

There's a song I love so much I stole 
Every precious note I took, I sold 
Now I spit out words, do you see my lungs on the dance floor?
To a hopeless cause, I sold my soul 
A romantic plastic piece of shit you can mold 
Until I break into chokable pieces 

You got a sign, so I paid the ransom
You felt sorry, so I felt the wrath come
Had a nice grip on my life 'til you twisted my arm
My arm 

And I open up like the back of a book 
I ruin everything with just a quick look
And I settle down like a rocket explodes
Hit the ground, but how far out who knows

You got a sign, so I paid the ransom
You felt sorry, so I felt the wrath come
Had a nice grip on my life 'til you twisted my arm
My arm"

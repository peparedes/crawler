"event","I woke the other day
and saw my world has changed
the past is over but tomorrow's wishful thinking
i cant hold onto whats been done
i cant grab onto whats to come
and im just wishing i could stop but

life goes on
come of age
cant hold on
turn the page

time rolls on
wipe these eyes
yesterday laughs
tomorrow cries

Memories are bittersweet
the good times we cant repeat
those days are gone and we can never get them back
now we must move ahead
despite are fear and dread
were all just wishing we could stop but

life goes on
come of age
cant hold on
turn the page

time rolls on
wipe these eyes
yesterday laughs
tomorrow cries

with all our joys and fears
wrapped in forgotten years
the past is laughing as today just slips away
time tears down what weve made
and sets another stage
and im just wishing we could stop

life goes on
come of age
cant hold on
turn the page

time rolls on
wipe these eyes
yesterday laughs
tomorrow cries"

Maybe in a nother life
i could find you there
pulled away before your time
i cant deal its so unfair

And it feels
and it feels like
Heavens so far away
And it feels
yeah it feels like
the world has grown cold
now that you've gone away

leaving flowers on your grave
to show that i still care
but black roses and hail marys
cant bring back what's taken from me

I reach to thesky 
and call your name
and if i could trade
i would

And it feels
and it feels like
Heavens so far away
and it stings
yeah it stings now
the world is so cold
now that you've gone away

i reach to the sky
and call out your name
please let me trade
i would"

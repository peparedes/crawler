"event","ya this is clover . i went on a ride with mom in the car today. it was neat. then she took me on a walk on the REAL GROUND with REAL GRASS and REAL WIND!!! what a rush. if only mom would realize i dont like the mini humans. when small humans touch me i get scared. i cant seem to help it! but then moms the only human ive ever met that i like.
-clover

today ruby and i sat in the cage, had an argument over the wheel, slept, ate, slept some more, then had an argument over who got the last sunflower seed. when do we get to go outside again?
-dusty

i dont go outside. the sun hurts my eyes. the night scares me. and insectts are bullies. its really just safer to stay in our cage. there are all sorts of hidden dangers... all around... but mom i if you're reading this i do like the floor (even though your feet are large and worrisome)so let us run on it again soon. i cant believe how much fun ive been missing all this time? who knew the 'carpet' was so different from the large human sitting device???
-ruby

mom. i like the feet. keep em aroound ok? man those little guys are fun...

"event","we were out of water for a very long time because mom was gone and the male was watching us. dusty got very sick... i bet she would have died if mom hadnt checked on us rite away when she came back. she had to force dusty to drink. clover and i were reallly worried! and mom didnt even tell that stupid male she was mad. i think she was just too sad cuz shes leaving us behind in a few months... we are sad about it too...
- ruby

i'm better now but i appreciate the concern guys! we never really had to worry u know! i was just hungrier than thirsty. no water and only alphalpha pekllets to eat! what a way to live!!!
-dusty

i think moms scared to leave us behind    not sad. i only make noises like that when im scared    but why was water squirting out her eye balls? u don't think shes sick do u?

"event","well we have some new additions and some losses. our first little dumbo friend died under mysterious circumstances. our new dumbo friend seems quite healthy but is a tiny bully. very uncool...

dusty and i think she may be expecting so that will mean many more additions to our rodent family soon! isnt it exciting? and just in time for mommys gift giving thing. she says we will have a nice little feast  and some new toys for ""chris-miss""

if she misses chris so much maybe she should give him food and toys and he'll come back!
- ruby

silly humans make no sense
but thats why theyre so lovable! 
- dusty

i dunno what to say
i like milk

"event","ive been very lonely with out ruby to hang out with but the human female (who requests i call her mother)spends alot of time with me. any time the male human comes near me he torments me. but i try to forgive him because he's male and they are naturally unpleasant. i met two rather large loud creatures with lots of fur and upright wagging tails today. they seemed to be friends of the humans so i walked up trying to be friendly and got a smack in the head with a paw for it. and they also licked me with their gigantic tongues. i have cleaned and cleaned myself but i still smell like them. yick. i will never forgive the human for putting me through that. but i got to eat a dandelion and some dirt afterwards so i wont need any rat therapy."

"event","hi everybody! my mom took out the big giant cage with the tunnels and put us with The Boy rat for a while today! yick! hes okay i guess but hes kind of a bully and he's three times my size! he's also kind of smelly... and that attention hogging little dusty kept jumping on him instead of me. he was nicer to her and they made me left out. so on the plus side mom finally paid attention to me for a while. she even tried to file my nails. humans are so silly. i felt that grindy thing and jumped about six feet away. reallly. atleast six feet. the male human is mean too. he called ruby doom. so i ignored him. anyway HE like dusty better TOO. but mom loves me more. i know it. mom says before the new rats come to live with us, we will be rescuing some ferrets. that makes me very nervous... they're too much like cats for comfort (no offense to my cat friends). and they'll take even more of her attention! does anybody else get nervous when new animals come home???"

"event","today i got a clean cage a new box to play in
and dusty got lost under the fluffy-human-sitting-device.
ha ha!
then we got food and treats.
but i hardly see my human mom anymore!
i wish she'd hold me like she used to before dusty came...
dusty gets all the attention,
even when she hides from mom."

"event","oh wow i gorged myself on the yummy colorful fruit flavored human-pellets. 
i am so full right now!
i think they were my reward because today the worst thing ever happened!
and my human mom did it!
she held me under the water YES THATS RIGHT UNDER THE WATER! 
and then she rubbed smelly gooey stuff all over me!
AND THEN
AND THEN SHE HELD ME UNDER THE WATER AGAIN!
can you believe that?
i hope she never does that again!
but then i got the human-food.
and im dry.
and i got to watch her do it to Dusty too.
that was the best part."

"event","a few sleeps ago my friend orchid disappeared. now mom wants to relish and enjoy me and dusty more so she helped me start this memory-keeper. my first memory to put in is of orchid. she was soft and fluffy and grey with big round ears and i miss her. i can still smell her all around, but i wonder if shes  coming back. she was happy with us when she left! orchid always jumped on my head and groomed me but she also let me do it back to her. she also let me steal food, which is something most rats struggle against. orchid didnt want to play much, but didnt ever really hurt me. thats my memory for today. now i will scratch, eat, drink, and cuddle up with dusty under the denim scrap to sleep."

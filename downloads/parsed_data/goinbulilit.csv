"event","I texted 'D' today and she didn't reply. Oh well. There's still tomorrow. Oh well. I'll try again. Oh well. Maybe just maybe. Then, she replied after 5 minutes. I guess I am being too paranoid. I'm gonna ask her to go to Enchanted Kingdom because I got free tickets (four). Maybe her friend 'P' can come and join us with Brian. So it's gonna Ryan (me), Brian, 'D' and 'P'. Double date! We're gonna have lots of fun! We're gonna have a blast!"

"event","I just went to John Robert Powers today for my photo shoot. It was hot behind those flashy cameras and thick make-up. I was modelling FCUK clothes when all of a sudden, I got hungry. So I went to Teriyaki Boy and grabbed some food. There, I saw two hot girls who looked like supermodels. They looked like models like me, so I sat near them. Chisms eh noh? But I can't help myself. They were so gorgeous. They even smiled at me. I found out they were from ICA incoming 3rd years. One of them lived near there. I even passed by them in my car with my plate number MAYOR. Bigtime huh? Well, I hope to talk to those girls in another time. I got their numbers ;) Ciao!"

"event","Home from hospital, I feel like I've been kicked by a mule.  My legs hurt, my calves - can't figure out why.  I did do a lot of walking in the hospital, maybe that was it.  I feel better now that I'm home on my own pain meds, but the Demerol pump was pretty sweet while it lasted, lol.  I'm also back on my lyrica and tramadol, so that's good.  I'm still working out all my meds, I've stopped all supplements for now.  I've been drinking water out of little one-ounce shot glasses, can't even count how many I've spilled.  I tried an Isopure protein drink, and it sucks.  The Jell-O is pretty good, but I'm sending the guys back to get regular instead of sugar free, as my body is going into sugar withdrawal.  Hey, I have a very significant eating disorder, and my body will not tolerate going cold turkey.  I'm also getting popsicles, yum!  I'll taper off the sugar.  I already got rid of all my candy here at home, that is a HUGE deal for me.

BUT - I discovered something.  I was scared in that hospital.  I was worried about my future.  I certainly don't want to end up in a hospital because of my weight.  I don't want my final years to be full of hospital stays and sickness.  I'm hurting and I brought it all on myself by not even trying to be healthy.  This is going to be very hard.  Very."

Home from Boston, we really had a great time!  WE SAW WHALES!!!!!  We really did!  Took us two tries, but we finally saw a fin whale and several humpbacks!!  It was exhilarating!!  I want to do it again!!!  We saw a lot of historical stuff, but missed Harvard and MIT, it was hot and I was being a whiny baby about walking.  I ADORED Salem, I'm definitely going back!!!   I could definitely spend a lot of time there!!  It is all spooky and witchcraft and creepy stuff, I absolutely adored the whole town!!

Interestingly enough, most of Boston and area are not handicap accessible, being historic buildings grandfathered in.  I had to walk a lot of stairs.  And I was a complaining baby about it, I admit.  Hopefully I will lose a lot of weight and things will feel better next time.  But I need to make a conscious effort to be less complaining.  I was reading up on fibromyalgia, I didn't know temperature sensitivity is a symptom, but it is.  Maybe that is part of my problem.  I was a colossal pain in the ass, and I'm ashamed of myself.  But we were keeping a very fast pace, and I was in a great deal of pain with my knee.  I just shouldn't have been such an ass.

Vermont was gorgeous, New Hampshire as well.  We stayed at the most adorable Bed & Breakfast, run by Brits.  Best bed I've ever slept in!  We also met G's friend Elaine, who lives in a 200 year old house!  I really liked her, in other circumstances she and I would have been great friends and would have gotten in a boatload of trouble together, lol!   

Going into hospital on Tuesday to get lap-band changed to sleeve.  I'm nervous about it being irreversible.  But I've gained 40 pounds since the band prolapsed and I can't seem to get a handle on my eating disorder.  With the band, the top part of my stomach was full but since the bottom part was still empty, I still felt hungry.  I hope this will feel different.

Finished <u>To Play the Lady</u> by Naomi Lane and <u>One Crazy Summer</u> by Rita Williams-Garcia.  9 and 10, respectively.  To Play was self-published, something I'm beginning to see in a different light.  The story was new, if a little confusing, and the characters were interesting.  I can't wait for the next one in The Sevalian Chronicles!  One Crazy was really good, something I could see using in my classroom.  I want to pick up more of her stuff!  I never really knew anything about the Black Panthers, and the historical context made this book unforgettable.  Started <u>Robin Lady of Legend</u> by R.M. Arcejaeger.  Looks really good so far, I really like the Robin Hood myth and so I love all the takes on it!

I'm hungry, this diet blows!  :)"

"event","Septimus Heap series:  Magyk, Flyte, Physik, Queste, Syren, Darke, Fyre, plus The Magykal Papers and The Darke Toad.  10 stars, I loved this series!  It is similar to Harry Potter in a couple of ways, but Septimus and Marcia are very different, facing different obstacles and situations.  Angie Sage added more humor and whimsy to her books, and although the character development isn't quite as strong, the characters are lovable and believable, winning over readers instantly.  These books aren't as dark as HP, so they would appeal to a younger audience.  I absolutely loved each of these books immensely, although I wished that the story arc concerning Jenna and Beetle had ended more solidly!

Maya's Notebook by Isabel Allende - 7 stars, very very good book!  A definite page-turner, it is frightening how drugs can descend so solidly and ruin lives.  This was a book club book, and I would like to read more by Allende!

Howl's Moving Castle, simply because it is a classic.  I hated it, I couldn't follow the plot, things just happened out of the blue, I had no idea why things happened.  I finished it just so I would be done.

Prisoners of the Palace by Michaela MacColl.  9 stars!  This was another book club book, and I thought it would be a fluffy princess book but it is actually a meaty book full of intrigue and solid characters.  Very satisfying mystery, and I found out that Princess Victoria in this book is the real Queen Victoria, that this book is based on true events!  Definitely worth it!!

I tried Great Gatsby, didn't like it.

Doll Bones by Holly Black, I got an ARC of this book from my librarian and LOVED it!!  Black created a cast of kids who compliment each other and solve a mystery, very appealing to tweens and teens!  7 stars!

Brave New World by Aldous Huxley - read in senior English class.  WOW.  This is a freaking SCARY book.  My class in 1984 read 1984 so I missed BNW, but I liked it much more than Orwell's.  10 stars, and reading it in 2013 shows us that a lot of Huxley's predictions were off the mark, but I can't imagine reading this book in 1930!  I will say that some solutions Huxley presented are not that crazy...

The Wretched of Muirwood, The Scourge of Muirwood, and The Blight of Muirwood, by Jeff Wheeler.  I picked up these books off Kindle because they were suggested to me, and I loved them - 9 stars!  I then found out that Wheeler self-published the first on Kindle, and a publisher picked them up.  I even emailed the author and had a small conversation, and I know that is how I will break into the world of publication, as that seems to be the way to go these days!  These are great books if you like medieval settings and female heroes!!

The Borrowers, The Borrowers Afloat, The Borrowers Afield, The Borrowers Aloft, The Borrowers Avenged by Mary Norton.  10 stars!  I don't know how I missed these books growing up, but I did.  These are timeless, perfect for any age, with a timeless quality that today's books lack.  I even watched The Secret World of Arietty, but was a bit disappointed, as I generally am with movies.  These are wonderful read-alouds and fun rainy-day books to curl up with!

Celia and the Fairies and Secrets of the Magic Ring by Karen McQuestion.  These were also Kindle suggestions, very cute books!  6 stars, solid stories with enough action, good read-alouds for girls!

Flight Behavior by Barbara Kingsolver.  7 stars, a slowly moving book about butterflies and marriage, this was a book club book.  Kingsolver is difficult for me to read, she is thick and chewy and requires a lot of brains.  I learned a great deal about monarch butterflies!!

Maelyn and Coralina by Anita Valle, the first two in a series of twelve, each centering around one sister in a royal family.  I talked to this author as well, and she is delightful!  These are small novellas, perfect for tweens, delightful for bedtime stories, I adore her characterization, and her plot twists are easy on the nerves!  8 stars, I will be buying these in hardback so I can share them!

The Woodcutter by Kate Danley.  I read this one in Jamaica, 6 stars.  Wonderful take on fairy tales, but a bit confusing as the characters' roles were not solidly explained.  Good story!

Frost, Thorns, Weavers by Kate Avery Ellison, 9 stars, wonderful dystopian series, good characters, storyline that is new, surprising twists.  Loved them!

The False Prince and The Runaway King by Jennifer Nielson, the first two in The Ascendence Trilogy, 9 stars, I'm dying to read more!!  These books were amazing, incredibly strong characters, story is new, plot moved along nicely, and left me hanging!  I loved these, I want more by Nielson!

The Madman's Daughter by Megan Shepherd.  9 stars!  This book picked up where The Island of Doctor Moreau left off, with the daughter of Doctor Moreau, Juliet.  She ends up finding her father alive on his island, and she finds terrifying creatures!  Amazing book, worth the read!!!!

Peter and the Starcatchers, Peter and the Shadow Thieves, Peter and the Secret of Rundoon, Peter and the Sword of Mercy, and Bridge to Neverland, by Dave Berry and Ridley Pearson.  14 stars, these books are amazing!!!  These are a different view of Peter Pan and Wendy, the parallels are awesome!!  I adored these books, I highly recommend them!!

Seraphina by Rachel Hartman, 9 stars!  A shapeshifting sort of book, dragons and humans interacting in a dystopic/past when things are different.  I loved the dragons, but the characters were very complex and strong, you really buy into the story and root for the good guys!  I wish there were more but this is a very good story!

Where Things Come Back by John Corey Whaley.  10 stars!  I picked this up because it was on the banned list and it also won the Printz award.  What can I say - just READ THIS BOOK.  It will make you shiver with delight and spook you soundly!!


I think that catches me up from books on my Kindle, I read many real books up at school, those will have to trickle in.  One I remember - The Fault in our Stars - 15 stars, THE MOST AMAZING BOOK EVER.  This book will grab you and shake you, you will scream and rave!  This is an award winner, too many to list, John Green shows again that he is a talented author who knows kids better than they know themselves.  AMAZING!!"

"event","I haven't posted, I have been doing nothing and enjoying it!  I had my hairdresser put some purple in my hair and it looks amazing, and since it didn't fry my hair she will do more on Saturday!  

I saw my eye doc, my eyes are fine, just aging normally (although he didn't say it like that, lol).  far vision needs to be stronger, I knew that.  I'll update my current glasses after vacation.   

leaving on Tuesday for vacation, Boston area!  on deck:  whale watching, a baseball game, and Salem!  we are also going to rent a car for the weekend and drive up into new Hampshire and Vermont just to see them, probably also drive down to rhode island so we can say we were there.  c and g want to use public transportation in the boston/salem areas as it is very impractical to drive a car.  I'm not sure that will work, but we will see when we get there.  I'm bandaging my pain patches right onto my knees and I'll use my cane as that helps me get more distance out of my knees.  I bought some new amazing tennie-go-fasters, by Ryka and they are neon yellow and hot pink, lol!  my feet glow!  I'll start packing on sunday, I'm excited!

I think tonight I will organize jewelry, I have some tubs for stuff I want to keep but have no room for.  my earrings are busting out and they keep getting snarled up together, I have a tackle box that I can use for earrings.

I got a keyboard for my Kindle, it's red and charging, M said he would teach me to use it tonight.

I'll post a list of read books with stars."

"event","no, I didn't post every day. work just caught up with me.  but now it's summer so I have a little time.  I scheduled my surgery today, for july 15, whee.  they are taking out the lap-band and doing a gastric sleeve.  my doctor tried to talk me into this four years ago when he put in the band, and I refused.  he knew I would cheat the band.  oh well.

I have a dental appointment tomorrow, two cavities.  slowly working toward a mouth with no problems so I can get a guard against grinding my teeth, which is causing the problems.  (well that, and a stupid diet)

I don't know why I wrote all that, it's completely clear that nobody reads my journal anymore, lol.

so I'm on the seventh book in the Septimus Heap series, and I ADORE THESE BOOKS.  I will have to put them into that category of books that I loved so dearly I can't read them over and over.  I mean, they produce such strong emotions, it's hard to relive those feelings.  I'm absolutely dying for a certain chief hermetic scribe to get together with the princess.  I always fell hard for those geek guys.  I admit to a little crush on Beetle.  nope, not Septimus, who seems distant in the past few books, a part of growing up I think.  ok, the character development isn't anywhere near Harry Potter, but I'm getting angry at people who say Angie Sage ripped of JK Rowling, because if anyone bothered to read Septimus, they would see how different the stories are.  yes, both are about wizards, but the plot lines are very different.  at any rate, I HIGHLY recommend this series.  I sent my friend L home with the first one, hopefully she will read the series over the summer.  J doesn't like fantasy very much, and S doesn't either.  but I love them.  also, the book covers rock.  go ahead, slip over to Amazon and check.  I'm right, huh?

I really used to think I was alone when I developed crushes on boys in books, but through the internet I learned that most people do.  I mean, come on, Harry grew from an adorable moppet to a rather hot young adult.  and then Dan Radcliffe, good lord.  I just melt.  now Edward, I crushed hard on in the books, and then I never saw the movies so Rob Pattinson never did much for me.  book guys can take on characteristics that you prefer, filling in the empty spots with your own personal preferences, which is why most people prefer the book characters.  they have more control.  the movie guy, that's it, that's what you get.  sometimes the movies get it right (Radcliffe, Bloom [holy god in hell that guy is amazing]) and sometimes they flop.  I hope to do a lot more reading this summer.

I'll just put up a list of recent books, and then try to keep it updated.  I really should just move all this over to Good Reads or that other website.  I'll just go look up Orlando Bloom on Pinterest and drool for an hour now."

my Kindle Fire broke, the charger cord was messed up, so for $169 they upgraded me to the 8.9"" HD, 16G - wow.  I'll get it tomorrow, I'm excited!  although I had to embarass myself when the tech had to explain the cloud to me.  

Jen and I are kicking around children's book ideas - how does a warrior butterfly sound?  cheesy?

School is out next friday, graduation is saturday.  one more year under my belt.  I have always planned to get my 20 year pin here in this district, but that is 9 more years, and I might not last that long, lol.  I'm going to try, though.

the knee doc injected some syn-visc (sp?) into my knee, and believe it or not, my knee hurts considerably less!  I'm hoping this will hold me for another year, and maybe two, then I'll do a replacement.  the longer I can wait, the better.

getting my lap-band replaced with a gastric sleeve this summer, they are already wanting me to schedule the surgery.  I'm worried, but about stupid stuff - like the fasting I have to do before the surgery.  I'll make it.

more later, I'm sleepy."

"event","beginning a week off before my LAST CLASS, graduation is Dec 15th, then we party!!

I promise I will try to post more, and here are some book reviews for today!

finished <u>The Bluest Eye</u> by Toni Morrison, I loved how she gradually introduced all the players and the background stories - she is an amazing author, her characters are so real.  this isn't the first Morrison I have read, and she never has yet failed to satisfy.  I definitely recommend this book!  5 out of 5 stars!

<u>The Diviners</u> by Libba Bray.  Touted as monstrously creepy, it wasn't as scary as I had hoped.  however, as usual, Bray wrote an amazing story with lots of wonderful little surprises and strong characters.  I loved that it was set in the 20s, not many books choose that setting so it was fun and I learned something as well!  4 out of 5 stars!

<u>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</u> by Stephen Chbosky.  I picked up this book because it was on the BANNED list, and it definitely is graphic BUT it is an amazing story and I adored it!  I just found out the other day that Sam will be played by Emma Watson in the movie, so now I really want to see the movie!  this book lays open the complicated relationships teenagers have, incredible characterization, surprising plot twists, and a rather unsatisfactory ending for my taste.  I believe there might be a sequel!  5 out of 5 stars!

<u>32 Third Graders and One Class Bunny</u> by Phillip Done.  OMG!!  if you are a teacher, you will laugh so hard you cry!!  THIS is the best book by a teacher I have EVER read!!  Done is a master at storytelling!  I have <u>close encounters of the third-grade kind</u> is on deck, I can't wait!  I want to buy this book for all my teacher friends!  MOST DEFINITELY recommended, 8 out of 5 stars!!

<u>Nicholas St. North and the Battle of the Nightmare King</u> by William Joyce.  this series is amazing, what a wonderful, quirky, fantasy world!  I also read <u>E. Aster Bunnymund and the Warrior Eggs at the Earth's Core!</u>  I love Katherine, I love how these fables are actually saviors of the world!  Joyce is so creative!  I do wonder about the movie, though - it doesn't look like it follows the books other than the characters.  makes me wonder why an author would let his work be changed so much.  these are quick reads, perfect for bedtime stories!  most definitely recommended, 5 out of 5 stars!

<u>TH1RTEEN R3ASONS WHY</u> by Jay Asher.  this is one of those books you won't be able to put down.  it deals with the legacy left behind by Hannah, who killed herself.  she leaves behind meticulous cassettes for Clay detailing her hours before death.  he learns a lot about her, and himself.  I absolutely recommend this book, which was on the BANNED list.  6 out of 5 stars!

<u>No-Name Baby</u> by Nancy Bo Flood.  Sophie learns about herself and her position in life when her mom has a baby.  most of her siblings have come to early and have died.  this is a depressing book, but the story line keeps you hooked.  4 out of 5 stars

<u>Stoner & Spaz</u> by Ron Koertge.  this is an unlikely relationship book, between a stoner chick and a physically disabled guy.  very strange, very odd little romance between these two, but definitely a look into the life of teenagers.  will recommend.  4 out of 5 stars.

<u>The Year of Secret Assignments*</u> by Jaclyn Moriarty.  a little hard to follow at first, until you get into the flow of the changing narrators.  another teen novel that chronicles drama, drama, and drama.  BUT it is fun, silly, interesting, and eye-opening.  definitely recommend, although it is a girl book.  4 out of 5 stars.

<u>What My Mother Doesn't Know</u> by Sonya Sones.  picked it up because it is BANNED, another DRAMA teenager book, but nothing that deserves the banned label.  I couldn't put it down, and I know other teens (girls) will really enjoy it.  definitely recommend!  4 out of 5 stars.

currently reading:  <u>The Penderwicks: A Summer Tale of Four Sisters, Two Rabbits, and a Very Interesting Boy</u> by Jeanne Birdsall.

ON DECK:  <u>The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane</u>, <u>Out of the Dust</u>, the series <u>The Chronicles of Prydian</u>, <u>Frindle</u>,  <u>Fablehaven</u>,  <u>Artemis Fowl</u>,  <u>When You Reach Me</u>,  <u>Daughters of the North</u>,  <u>The Mysterious Benedict Society</u>,  <u>The Night Circus</u>,  <u>jemima j</u>,  <u>For Darkness Shows the Stars</u>,  <u>The Hunt</u>,  <u>Raven's Gate</u>,  <u>The Dovekeepers</u>,  <u>Toothiana</u>,  Queen of the Tooth Fairy Armies</u>,  <u>My Louisiana Sky</u>,  <u>Running Out of Time</u>,  <u>Turned</u>,  <u>Hold Still</u>,  <u>The Kite Runner</u>,  <u>Wildfire</u>,  <u>A Touch Mortal</u>,  <u>A Touch Morbid</u>,  <u>Possess</u>.  good thing I'm out of college soon!"

"event","started ny second-to-last class for my masters, ugh.  I can honestly say I have hated about 75% of this venture, but I will be exceptionally proud of myself when I finish!  and husband is taking me to Jamaica in february to celebrate!!  so, until I'm done with this degree, I won't be posting here as often.  five weeks, one week off, five weeks, and then I'm done.  whew!

so I'm now on Pinterest - it's not a journal, but a bulletin board.  it's actually just a pinboard, where I can put links and stuff I want to remember.  lots of good ideas for holiday stuff.  it's sort of addicting, just looking at other stuff people pin.  kinda like that toothpaste site off of LJ a few years ago that loaded the graphics others were uploading, and it felt good spying on strangers.  anyway, hit me up if you want to follow me, I'll give you my real name.  I don't even think anyone actually reads this anymore, maybe two people.

halloween looks amazing so far!!!"

"event","anyone remember Sylvia Plath?  I read The Bell Jar and it touched me, I could see myself in Sylvia - I too either love too much or not at all.  depressing book.

I GOT AN IDEA FOR BANNED BOOKS WEEK!!!  I am buying a bunch of that yellow CAUTION tape and taping off all my books, all the shelves, like a crime scene.  I will put a big poster in the hall and another across one side of my room.  still not sure what to put on the posters, but I'll think of something.  then every day I will share one Banned Book with my class and tell them why it is banned.  I am toying with standing in the hall every day with one book, like maybe make a big poster like a protest poster and tell people all about the banned book of the day.  still thinking about that part.  anyway, ideas are rolling!

halloween decorating this weekend, I'm excited!!!

played around on Pinterest tonight, basically re-pinning shit other people pinned.  I'm not sure I know the point of it, but it seems like a great way to waste time!!"

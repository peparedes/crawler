"event","So, being the procrastinator that I am, I was aim-stalking, and one of my friends from high school had an amusing away message.  So I thought that I would make this my post of the year:

TOP TEN REASONS TO DATE AN ENGINEER
10. We don't cheat. We barely have time for your relationship much less a second
9.  We do it with more torque
8.  We learn about the benefits of friction and viscioty
7. we're trained to do it right the first time
6.  We have significant figures
5.  We're used to pulling all nighters
4.  FREE body diagram
3.  We're always willing to experiment
2.  We know it's not the length of the vector that counts, it's how much force you apply to it
1. I'M ONE OF THEM!!!!"

"event","Yay!  It's finally Summer.
Finals are all done, and oh, yeah, I had class this morning.  This weekend was fun, except for the entire night of no sleep due to flying across the country.  It was my grandparents 50th wedding anniversery about a month ago or so, i'm not exactly sure when.  But, they procrastinted theparty untill my family could fly in from various parts of the country.  So I arrive bright and early thurdsay morning at 9:37 am.  My aunt Cathleen picks me up ate the airport, along w/a handfull of cousins and my grandmother.  It's wierd to have ur aunt re-introduce you to your cousins that you havent seen for two or three years.  They grow really quickly when your not there.  Then there was the hours of board-game fun.  That's one of my favorite things about visiting Lousiville, I know i'll always get to play card games.  There was Tripole, of couse, our family tradition, sequence, a new one that i read the directions for and then proceeded to teach everyone else how to play.  Then, after Eric, and then Mom, Dad, Scott and Drew arrived, Scott and Eric taught me how to play texas hold-em or something like that -- a fun version of poker.  Oh, and there was a bit of Eucher at the acutual anniversy party (okay, so we were a little bored).  Friday was when Mom and company got there, so we run to get a huge family picture taken -- my grandparents, all of my dad's sisters, and all of my cousins on that side of the family.  Each family had to wear the same colored shirt for some wierd reason, so mom picks out these ugly gray shirts that say caolifornia on them, and of course, my was about three sizes too big b/c they didnt have any smalls.  Plus, kentucky implies humidity implies Lindsay has frizzy hair.  I'm curiose to see how it turned  out though, it was outside at this park-place w/a huge fallen tree that we were all sitting/standing on/around.  Then mom and dad left (they were on a no-sleep night b/c of their flight) to pick up a rental car in ohio (dad got it for free from work) and drop of Drew at a friends (who met half-way in the middle of Ohio).  Then there was some cards at my aunts and then back to my grandmothers for some more sleeping.  Saturday was get up, shower, get dressed up, go to church, go to party (which was at the church), then go to some random bar w/my my aunt, uncle, dad, Eric, and Scott.  That part was slightly entertaining to watch the more my aunt and uncle drank, and no, i did not drink anything besides a coke.  Then sudnay there was get up, eat a bowl of ceral, socailze w/about a billion relatives for a few hours, then leave for the airport.  Oh, then, at the airport, there was the sit there on the broken plane that turend out not to be broken, only the warning light was broken.  Which then cause the running across the Atlanta airport to catch my connecting flight so that i can get back do davis by last night and to class bright and early this morning and work (at Shields!) right now.  And that was my weekend.
On the bright side, i learned that i have a free web-site thingy throug my email w/my parents internet provider, so my goal this summer is to learn how to make a website ane make my own.  Since i'm only working 25 hrs a week and taking summer classes, i should be able to do that, right?  Well i should pay attention to work now, as i do get paid well to sit here.
Oh!  And i get to move into Sam's this week!  I'm sooo excited!  Not living with people who hate me is a good thing!  There are still some details to work out, like bills, and ending the lease kinda stuff, but nothing major!  Yay!"

I should be doing chemistry hw, i have four chapters of it to do since i havent open up my book yet this quarter -- ooops, mabey those weekly quizzes last quarter were good for me.  Oh well.  I get to do lots of chem and some math when i get home.  It will be a traditional sunday night of hw.  But that doesnt help the fact that i'm still at wrok now and still very bored.  Its not my turn to clean the computers, i already made the white-boards all pretty for the week, and I'm not *allowed* to do hw at work (I also dont feel like looking at chemistry).  OOooh, i got to see cute kitties yesterday at Picnic Day, they were all tiny and adorable.  And i got lots of free posters, now i wont have nothing on my walls next year!  Half an hour left, oh the joy!"

"event","Well, its the second week of classes.  This means that next week there are  midterms, which i dont want to even think about yet.  Math this quarter seems likes its going to be a lot of work and memeorization, but not challenging concept-wise.  Physics, on the other hand, has some pretty crazy stuff this quarter.  Dont tell anyone, but i think i actually kind of like it.  The physics pretends to defy physics.  I love the idea of a 100m train fitting in a 50m tunnel.  Chem 2C is just kinda boring.  I supposedly have one of the best professors, but i dont particurally like his lectures, i feel like he's schitzophrenic or something, and just likes writing random things on the overheads he uses.  I liked my 2B prof soooo much  better.  But, all in all, its going to be another not-so-challenging chem class.  Especially since *someone* gave me all of her labs ::hugs::.  Labs are the only thing that i truly dislike about chem.  At least my last one only lasted and hour and a half!  They should run out of voltmeters more often and let us work in groups of 4 every week!  (They usually make us work by ourselves -- isnt that harsh!?).  My last class, engineering 17, an introduction to circutits is just weird.  So far is basically been stuff i've learned in physics 9c, with a few things thrown in for fun.   The teacher is wierd though.  We supposedly have quizzes, but we havent had one yet.  And we have one midterm, but he wont tell us when.  He did say that we get one cheat sheet for the midterm and two for the final though, so that means it wont be that bad -- i love my cheat-sheet making abilites.

So now i'm doing what i do best.  This wonderful thing called procrastination.  I have no classes tomorrow (thursday)(i do have 2hrs of work though), and two things due friday.  So i'll spend tomorrow doing my math and e17 hw.  I love my schedule this quarter!  I'm usually home before dark!  (well kinda, sorta, mabey, it keeps changing)

So now that i've procrastinated, its time to go get into bed, curl up with a fun book and relax.  How in the world did it get to be 10:52 already!?  I swear it was only 10:00 five minutes ago....mabey it was time dialation or something...oh wait, that makes time slower -- crazy physics."

WHAT'S UNDER YOUR BED?&nbsp; Well i used to have a trundle under my bed, but rach is using that as part of her bed now, so in the trundle's drawer, there is about 10 to 20 books that i'm wishing i had the time to read, some old school papers, a bag of stuff that i want to scrapbook when i go home for spring break (no scrapbooking stuff at school, isnt that sad?) and then there's some of my computer stuff, some tools, and other junk that doesnt belong anywhere but under a bed.<BR>24. PUT TOILET PAPER/PAPER TOWEL - OVER OR UNDER? Usually over, but i never really take the time to notice<BR>25.

FAMOUS PERSON YOU WOULD LIKE TO MEET? Hmmm, i have no clue.&nbsp; it would be more fun to pick a character from a movie, so i'll do that instead and pick Neo from the matrix, b/c that would just be cool<BR>27. MORNING PERSON, OR NIGHT OWL?&nbsp; Ummm, if you dont know the answer then u really need to im me and get to know my better, it is most definatly a Night Owl.&nbsp; Give me darkness and awakness, its the most peacful time of the day.<BR>28.

"event","Another fun and exciting day in the life of Lindsay.  I'm at work and i'm tired and thirsty and bored.  But then again, what else is new?
     I'd forgotten how quiet closing shifts are. Who know that 15 people or so would still be on the computers here at 11:06 at night yet never have an questions for me to answer.  The audacity of them all.
     Let's see, no life-alterning news that i can think of.  Oh, i get to sign my lease for my apartment for next year tomorrow.  I'm excited to make it offical.  It's good to know that i have a place to live next year (Sorry Rachel).  Oh, i got my physics midterm back.  For the score, well lets just say the class average was a 39.2%, and i did not do well enough to get that. ::sigh:: At least i'll have an A in chemistry this quarter.
     Okay, my procrastintion for the evening is over.  I must complete the math hw that is due tomorrow before i go home.  Blah.  and more Blah."

"event","Okay, so its around ten thrity and i have a billion other things that i should be doing at the moment, but i just dont feel like doing any of them.&nbsp; So i shall procrastinate again!&nbsp; Yes, i know i'm good at that.&nbsp; Today was another busy busy day in the life of Lindsay.&nbsp; It started off bright and early at around 7:00.&nbsp; Went to office hours at 8, class at 9 and 10, programmed for two hours till work.&nbsp; Worked for an hour.&nbsp; Went to a differnt computer lab and worked on my chem lab for a hour, then went to math class.&nbsp; After math went to office hours to pick up my math midterm -- i'm not going to question why he couldnt have just given them back in class, its makes no sense whatsoever.&nbsp; My grade was okay, definatly not up to what i want it to be, but not completely awful.&nbsp; I've actually done well on the other midterms i've gotten back, an A in both ECS and in Chemistry.&nbsp; It's the physics that i've soooo scared of at the moment.&nbsp; oh, yeah back to my day.&nbsp; And dont say i didnt warn you that my rambalings were not going to make sense to the rest of the world.&nbsp; So after math, i went to the computer lab.&nbsp; I got there around 4:30 or so and worked on my chem lab, which is still not done, stupid long-essay-like questions, untill 6, then i worked on my physics journal untill around 9:30 when my headache made it clear that i did not want to ber there any longer.&nbsp; I did get done with cathcing up with the stupid journal, so now tomorrow all i have to do is finish all of tomorrow's assignment and then i'm good for turning it in by friday.&nbsp; So that was my day.&nbsp; Was it chaotic enough for you?&nbsp; If it wasnt, just wait till tomorrow, or thursday, or friday, or something, it can always get more fun.&nbsp; Now i think i've procrastinated enough to go to sleep instead of finishing the aforementioned chem lab.&nbsp; I techinally have till thursday....0: )"

"event","Well i suppose i have to start somewhere, so here it is.  The world is now subjected to my short attention span, erratic thought processes, and whiny complaints.  I have yet to fully play with the soon to be beautiful appearance of my soon to be prefect journal, but that will have to wait for a later date.  I have to be up at a decent hour tomorrow so i can finish...i mean start and finish.. some homework before my five hours of work tomorrow.  I completely blame rachel for the not having accomplished anything today by the way.  So its off to bed for me, or off to bed after reading for a bit"

"event","omgosh.  i am freaking out right now.  not like screaming and yelling jumping up and down and what not, but i am on the verge of a nervous break down.  school starts tomarrow.  i know nobody, i don't know my teachers, i don't know where my classes are, i don't even know if i can carry a book bag.  holy crap!  it doesn't help that i don't have a first period class so the first thing i get to do is wonder around aimlessly for 44 minutes.  and on top of it all i don't even have a band period to find my happy place in!  damn it all to bologna and other various and assorted lunch meats!  it is really weird i have been telling myself for so long that it will all be better once i get in school, but now all i really want to do is go back to BHS.  twitch.  never thought i'd say that!  it also doesn't help that makenzi came home today with three new friends in her class and a teacher that from all accounts sounds like a puerto rican mr. rott!  i don't know if i am even going to be able to sleep tonight just thinking about it all.  i just remembered i have a chemistry test on thursday too.  man do i feel better now!  not even HOFBrINCl can make it better.  i think i am going to blare riverdance and read peter pan now."

"event","today was interesting.  i went to my first puerto rican sermon.....................
as i said it was interesting.  first of all, we walk in the door and spend ten minutes waiting for this guy to print us off nametags.  odd.  then we go in and there are seriously 20 other people tops.  then we sing hymns and read the bible, then a guy walks to the front of the room with a poster featuring the flying walendas(you know the tight rope walking people).  we sing jesus loves me and the guy tells a story then all the little children (four of them)  leave.  then we get the sermon about how the four most important words ever written are ""in the beginning God""  (it was funny though because he told us to look at the bible verse and the particular version had inserted the word ""when"" in it) anyway, then he teaches us how to siphon as an illustration of how we need to suck things out of God.  then, for a closing he turns to his wife and asks her for the thing he needs to make his next illustration.  she takes a piece of paper out of her ginormous purse and says, ""this?""  ""no""  and he walks over and pulls a starfish out of the purse.  no kidding.  it was one of the funniest things i have ever seen in my entire life!
i also finished ""the picture of dorian gray"" tonight.  it was a great book!  creepy but great!  i found the best quote in it: "" I never talk during music, at least during good music.  if one hears bad music, it is one's duty to drown it out in conversation.""  tell that to mr. runyon the next time he says you are talking too much!"

"event","so i hear band camp went well, with temperatures only in the 70s and 80s.  what the crap is up with that?!?  what happened to the fry your brains out weather of the past?!?  it has been hotter down here!  stupid weather gods!  oh well.  school starts in exactly...12 days.  boy am i looking forward to that!  you thouhg tyour senior colors were bad!  the seniors at my school have to wear the senior shirt every friday, and i think on field trips.  it is the ugliest color of booger green i have ever seen in all my blessed days!  the other uniforms aren't that bad though.  burgandy, navy blue, and white polos, button down blue shirts, khaki pants, shorts, and skorts.  altogether it could be worse.  the senior sweatshirts were this gothic looking black with a flaming s in the middle.  scary at best.  how's the marching show going for you guys?  besides stupid people who don't like to guide to make lines and death trap passthroughs with the wrong sections!  you guys have to send me some of the music.  do you guys have the first and second movements done?  enough puerto rican babbling.  must go watch the emperor's new groove.  movie about llamas you know!"

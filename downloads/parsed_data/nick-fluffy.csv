"event","I thought i'd surprise the whole world (or more realistically, a tiny proportion of it), and...... update my livejournal!
I've also added all the people i know of who have journals, and like, to my friends list, though if i havn't added you, and you think i should have done, it's most probably because i dosily forgot, or didn't realise you had a livejournal.
I'm thinking maybe i should have a more interesting username though. ""nick_fluffy"" seems rather dated, and too relevant to a band that split up rather a long time ago. Possible usernames i can think of could be ""The Lost Leader"", from the Idlewild song, ""Film For the future"". The image of a load of people following a lost leader is one i like alot. Alternatively, i could go for something losely based on my current wonderful band. I could be ""The Mighty Train"". I bet no-one has set up an account under that name yet. Or, i could have something that no-one is likely to come across randomly, maybe a balck-metal sounding name like ""Flgarghthhtsh Glathlothggyth. That really flows off the tongue doesn't it? Anyway, feel free to suggest others.
I can't promise i'll update my journal much, or read anyone else's ever, but you never know like.

"event","I had been waiting untill i thought of something really interesting to write about before posting on here again, but that could invlove this journal being very empty for a long time. Right now, i'm still in a really good mood because Pink Fluffy Cloud Machine, my online football team, won 3-1 against The Hotspurs yesterday afternoon. They had previously lost 5 consecutive league games, so i'm very pleased to have returned to winning ways.
Also, my new tennis racquet arrived today (actually, technically it arrived on friday, but the note saying i needed to collect it was put in with someone else's mail, so i couldn't use it for my match on friday night. I finally got to collect it today). It's the same type as the one which Andy Roddick uses. It's black, blue, and white, and it's very nice. It's powerful too. That's exactly the kind of uninteresting story i wanted to avoid filling my journal with dammit. Maybe i need a more exiting life.
Everyone should manage online football teams, because they are great fun, and provide interesting geeky things to discuss on livejournal. Get your own team on www.hattrick.org"

"event","In the last few weeks, the everyone i know who didn't already have a livejournal has set one up, so it seemed to be a good time to find out why everyone is so obsessed with this site.
As you may or may not know, i had a sort of online diary on the Pink Fluffy Cloud Machine website, and i guess my livejournal philosophy is quite similar to the way i went about posting on there. I have no desire to attempt to make this any kind of complete account of everything that happens in my life. Posts consisting of information like ""I went to the shop today and bought a bag of crisps which tasted realy nice"" are boring to read, and more importantly, boring to write too. I would also hope that there is enough to my charachter for it not to be possible to put everything of any interest about me into a journal, and i will not be making any attempt to write anything like enough about myself for this journal to be any kind of substitute for the rest of my life.
So basically, my plan is that this will end up being more of a collection of random ideas, stories, thoughts i want to share, and any other random things which seem like a good idea to write about at the time.
The first thing i feel i need to do in order for this to be more fun, is to get more people i like on my friends list, so if you would like to suggest people who i may like to add to my friends list, that would be very much appreciated."

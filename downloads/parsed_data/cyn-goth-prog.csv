Dear friends, happy new year.<br />
<br />
Ah, New Year's Eve &mdash; so much organisation and anticipation for one short
night of alcohol- and drug-fueled revelry, celebrating nothing more than the
fact that it's been 365 days (give or take) since the last one.  I hope you
enjoyed yours, however you chose to spend it.<br />
<br />
<lj user=""auroraslave"" /> and I spent the night at <b>Rock City Morgue</b> at
The Metro, followed by the <b>NYE Demons Ball</b> at Tailors:<br />
<br />
<center>
<table cellpadding=""15""><tr>

 width=""201"" height=""270"" alt=""NYE Demons Ball"" /></td>
</tr></table>
</center>
<br />
As New Year's Eves go, it was better than expected.  For me, the highlight of
the evening was <em>friends</em>: seeing old friends I hadn't seen in a while,
and meeting new friends (or in some cases, friends I'd already met, but didn't
remember meeting *cough*).  Of course, <b>Angelspit</b> was awesome (with extra
go-go dancing goodness!), and the DJs had the crowd eating out of their hands,
but you all knew that already, so I'm not going to stroke their egos any
further.  (I'm not really into this new ""heavy metal"" music, so I didn't go see
any of the other bands.)<br />
<br />
As I explained to my dad when he phoned at midday today to wish me a happy new
year, I drank a lot of those new ""energy drinks"" last night, so I was still
wide awake despite the fact that I hadn't slept yet.  After tidying my room a
bit (actually a lot, but it only made a small amount of difference), I decided
to pass some time by changing this:<br />
<br />
<center>
<img src=""http://www-personal.usyd.edu.au/~jboy1609/LJ/i_want_to_believe.jpg""
 width=""300"" height=""375"" alt=""I want to believe"" />
</center>
<br />
into this:<br />
<br />
<center>
<img src=""http://www-personal.usyd.edu.au/~jboy1609/LJ/i_want_so_much.jpg""
 width=""300"" height=""425"" alt=""I want so much to believe"" />
</center>
<br />
Remember, friends: you don't need to inject marijuana or snort heroin to have a
good time.  You don't need to carry around a stupid bottle of water and go
stand outside every half hour because ""man, it's really hot in there.""  You
don't need to degrade yourself, jerking off strangers in public toilets because
you're tweaking and you really need to do something with your hands but you
pawned your Playstation last week.  MDMA?  Don't need it!  GHB?  Not worth the
risks!  THC?  Get the fuck away from me and take a goddamn shower!  No, I'm
talking about a drug with a convenient acronym which you <em>don't</em> need to
hide up your arse during international travel: Nine Inch Nails, the
<em>perfect</em> drug.<br />
<br />
There's only one man that deals this drug: T. Rizzy, and you don't need to give
him a hand-job to get a hit (although the jury's still out on how to get him to
cough up a new album).  Lose yourself in those smouldering eyes!  Marvel at
that enigmatic Mona Lisa smile!  Acknowledge the less-noteworthy features of
his face!<br />
<br />
So much anger!  So much pain!!  This man doesn't just <strong>want</strong> to
believe, he wants it <strong>SO MUCH</strong>!!!!!<br />
<br />
(No, I haven't slept yet.  How could you tell?)<br />

About six or eight months ago, I put Linux on my family's computer.  I
installed the latest <a href=""http://www.suse.com/us/"">SUSE</a> release, and
set it all up so they could easily do everything they needed (which basically
boiled down to <a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/"">web-browsing</a>, <a
href=""http://www.openoffice.org/"">word-processing</a>, <a
 href=""http://www.gimp.org/"">image-editing</a> and <a
 href=""http://www.kde.org/areas/multimedia/software.php"">playing CDs</a>).
Thankfully, they haven't had any serious complaints (which for my family is
like World Peace).<br />
<br />
A few days ago, I dropped by for a visit, and they mentioned they were having
some problems with the computer.  So I took a look at it, and guess what!  It'd
been <a
 href=""http://computing-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/cracker"">cr4x0red</a>
and <a href=""http://www.chkrootkit.org/"">rootkitted</a>!  [And before the
Windows trolls come out, I'll take a Linux+Mozilla system (one compromise in
six months) over a WinXP+IE system (<a
 href=""http://isc.sans.org/survivalhistory.php"">one compromise every 15
minutes</a>) <em>any day</em>, thanks.]<br />

Anyway, after I had recovered from a sudden bout of uncontrollable <a
 href=""http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/coprolalia"">coprolalia</a>, I
was sitting there for quite a few hours trying to work out what had been
changed, and what the hell I was going to do about it.  I'll be the first to
admit I'm not much of a security expert, and I'm definitely no <a
 href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=h4x0r"">1337 h4x0r</a>.
At one point, my beloved siblings asked me &ldquo;<i>Don't you
<strong>know</strong> all this stuff?</i>&rdquo;  The implication being, of
course, that I take an <em>interest</em> in that sort of crap!  I was so
insulted I could only stare at them, speechless with indignation.<br />
<br />
For future reference, dear friends, comparing a <a

to a <a
 href=""http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#what_is"">hacker</a> is a
lot like comparing a mugger to a chef: they're both handy with a sharp knife,
but you wouldn't expect a mugger to be able to cook you up a banquet, nor would
you expect a chef to stab you in the throat and take your wallet.<br />

This week, I've been hard at work on <a
 href=""http://www-personal.usyd.edu.au/~jboy1609/LJ/analysis-ass2.pdf""
 >Assignment 2</a> <small>(<a
 href=""http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html"">PDF</a>)</small> 
of the <a
 href=""http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au:8000/u/UG/IM/MATH2907/r/"">Analysis</a>
subject I'm taking this semester.  Or at least, I <em>should</em> have been.
I keep getting summoned into the office for ""urgent"" meetings, plus I've been
finding it really hard to concentrate (I blame the heat, as well as the
complete lack of air conditioning in my new sardine-tin, sorry, office).<br />
<br />
[A small request: I realise that <ul>
<li> less than 0.01% of <a
 href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/cyn_goth_prog/friends"">you</a> have
<em>any</em> interest in <a
 href=""http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au:8000/u/UG/"">maths</a> whatso<em>ever</em>,
and </li>
<li> you all hate me anyway, and derive an almost sexual pleasure from causing
me pain, </li>
</ul>
but let's just pretend that I've <em>already</em> received 10,000 comments
along the lines of ""<small>OMGF MATHS!?!?!??! UR A NURD!!!!!!!1 LOL</small>""
and proceed from there... please?]<br />
<br />
In an effort to kick-start something resembling motivation, I've been hitting
the cold-n-flu pills and energy drinks over the past two days, and now I feel
predictably shit.  The twitchiness and edginess have subsided, but the veins in
my arms are telling me that my heart is pumping ball-bearings instead of blood.
 I'm guessing it's dehydration caused by the heat &mdash; I've been drinking
water by the bottlefull and resisting the temptation of coffee, so I wouldn't
otherwise have expected to feel so bad so soon.<br />
<br />
The real disappointment right now is that I didn't make the 4:30 deadline on
this assignment: I'll be handing it in on Monday and my marks will be taking a
substantial hit.  Realistically, though, the writing was on the wall on
Thursday: I was too far behind where I should have been, with not enough time
to catch up.  I can program in my sleep, but maths takes a lot more
brain-power.  I need to be well-rested and clear-headed, and this week I've
been neither.  By Thursday, there just weren't enough hours before the deadline
to allow myself the luxury of a decent night's sleep, so I sat at my desk and
stared at the questions and tried very hard not to think ""<em>what the
fuck?</em>"".<br />
<br />
Apparently there's a <a
 href=""http://www.vortex.zim.net.au/main.html"">Vortex</a> this weekend.  I
won't be going.  I probably wouldn't have gone anyway &mdash; I need to keep a
clear head this close to exams, and nothing messes me up for the next week like
a big night out &mdash; but now I <em>know</em> what I'll be doing on Saturday
night.  Ah, the student life!<br />
<br />
The other side of the coin: as soon as I hand in this assignment, work will be
right there to demand my time and energy again.  The boss has expressed a
desire to demo the ""latest"" version of our little program in three weeks' time,
where ""latest"" translates to something like ""incorporating features which are
intended, but do not yet exist"".  It wouldn't be quite so frustrating, except
he's had me working on other, unrelated stuff over the past three months or so
(all of which, of course, was <em>also</em> terribly urgent at the time) and
now he expects me to get this stuff working in the space of a few weeks.  Today
he actually emailed me to say he'd like a working version installed on his
laptop by Wednesday!<br />
<br />
(Spoiler: I said no.)<br />

a variety of different things, and I kind-of promised myself that the next
thing I posted would be a Covenant review.  However, the subject of this
post sort-of outweighs that in importance, so here I am.  I'll be checking

<br />
Were you or any of your friends in front of the Town Hall steps on George St
at 1am on Sunday the 15th of August?<br />
<br />
I was on my way home after visiting my family on the Saturday night.  I got
off the train at Town Hall station, and went up the stairs to the corner of
George St and (I think) Park St (out the front of that supermarket next to
the station) to catch a cab to Newtown.  Conveniently, there was a cab right
on the corner, waiting at the lights in Park St to turn left onto George
St.<br />
<br />
I jumped in, and in the second or two before the lights changed, my eyes
wandered across the road to the steps of the Town Hall.  Just as the lights
changed and the cab began to turn, I noticed a scuffle break out in front of
the steps in front of me.  My eyes focused on the scene, and I saw that it
involved a male dressed in black (perhaps with a black coat or trench-coat)
with long dark or black hair and a white design on the chest of his shirt
(something like a white skull) being harassed by a bunch of homeboy-type
males wearing white baseball caps and white tracksuit tops.  The cab was
accelerating down George St and this was all happening behind us in the
distance (my head was turned as far as it would go over my right shoulder)
so I couldn't make out much more.<br />
<br />
I saw the guy in black walking away or being shoved away, then just as the
scene was obscured by a bus parked a short way down, I saw the homeboys in
white jump the guy from behind.  The cab was speeding away from all this in
moving traffic, and even if I'd somehow been able to jump out and run back
to the scene, what would I have been able to do?<br />
<br />
Still, I wish I had jumped out.  Now that I think about it, perhaps I could
have given a statement or something if the boys in blue had turned up.  But
what could I have done against a gang of homeboy fuckheads in the meantime?
There were plenty of people standing round, but none of them seemed to be
doing anything to stop the fight.<br />
<br />
However, that's not what this is all about.  A minute or two after all this
happened, it occurred to me that when the homeboys jumped the guy, they
could have stuck a knife in his back or anything.  He could be in the
emergency room right now.  I have no way of knowing what happened to the
guy.  I'd really like to know that he's ok.<br />
<br />
Hence this post.<br />
<br />
Were you or anyone you know in front of the Town Hall steps on George St
at 1am on Sunday the 15th of August?  Does anyone know anyone who was
attacked in that place at that time?  If so, are they ok?  Did they end up
with a few bruises? a bleeding nose? a stab-wound in the back?<br />
<br />
I'd really like to find out.<br />

<br />
Unfortunately, a far greater crime still weighs upon my conscience...<br />
<br />
Seven weeks ago, we celebrated the ""Blauhaus Bordello Housewarming"".
Seven weeks ago, our house was filled with friends and merriment.
And then everyone went home, and seven weeks passed, and I still haven't
even said ""Thankyou"".<br />
<br />
So: <strong>Thankyou</strong>.<br />
<br />
Thankyou so much to everyone who made it.  Whether you rocked up early
to help us set up, or staggered in at midnight after a long day's work,
you all made it a fantastic night.  It was <em>without a doubt</em> one of
the most enjoyable parties I've ever had the pleasure of attending.<br />
<br />
Thankyou for being the perfect guests.  There was no damage to the house;
no aggro; no crashers or fuckwits; no extreme drunkenness.  Just great
people contributing to a great atmosphere.  Whether I was chatting with
friends I rarely get to see, or exploiting the amicable atmosphere to meet
new people, my night was a blur of good cheer.  Everyone always complains
that ""the scene"" is full of cold, aloof strangers -- well I didn't encounter
<em>one person</em> that night who was anything but warm and open.<br />
<br />
A special thankyou to those of you who brought gifts, whether something you
stumbled across in a shop which made you think of us, something you planned
in advance and actively hunted-down, or something you made yourself.<br />

<lj-cut text=""The Curse of the Digital Camera"">
Some of you may have noticed housemate Daniel wandering around with his new
digital camera.  Yes, he did indeed act as PhotoGuy throughout the night;
he was even kind enough to snap a few couple-shots of <lj user=""auroraslave""
 /> and I before the party started.  We have almost no couple-photos of
ourselves, and we were eagerly anticipating these.  <b>Little did we know
that our hopes would be dashed by...</b><br />
<h2>The Curse of the Digital Camera</h2>
<h3>Part I: The Doldrums</h3>
One of the principal benefits of a digital camera is the ability to simply
<em>upload</em> the pictures onto your computer.  No more waiting until the
roll of film is finished!  No more waiting while the photos are developed!
Just <em>ZAP!</em> -- straight onto your computer!<br />
<br />
Except... the day after the party, Daniel's computer crashed.  And it
wouldn't start up again!  Wah!!<br />
<br />
After a few days of frustration, he took it to work to get it fixed, or
asked one of his h4x0r friends to take a look at it, or something.  I don't
really know.  When it finally came back, I begged him and begged him to
upload the photos and burn me a CD.  He kept promising he would, but he
never did.  Eventually, I resorted to bribing him with chocolate, and he
burnt me a CD.<br />
<br />
This was two weeks after the party.<br />
<br />
<h3>Part II: Sloppy Focus</h3>
Those of you who know Daniel will be aware that he is quite a talented
photographer.  One minor gotcha: Daniel's weapon-of-choice is a manual-focus
SLR camera.  Daniel's digital camera has auto-focus.  When you snap a photo
with this camera, the flash fires, and the camera uses the reflected light
to focus.  If the flash doesn't fire, the camera can't focus.  Unfortunately,
Daniel didn't know this on the night of the housewarming.<br />
<br />

<b><em>Awwwwwww !!</em><br />
This couple is so sickly sweet,<br />
even the camera didn't want to look.</b><br />
</div></center><br />
<h3>Part III: The Evil Eye</h3>
Of course, not <em>all</em> the photos were blurry: occasionally, randomly,
the flash would fire.  And when it fired, it <em>fired</em>.<br />
<br />
<b>Fun fact:</b> if you held your hand up in front of your face when the
flash went off, you could see the bones in your hand.<br />
<br />
A few points of interest in this next photo: <ul> <li><lj user=""auroraslave""
 /> is dressed as ""bordello harlot"".  I am dressed as ""gothic slut-boi"".
Yes, the smeared lipstick is intentional:  it's supposed to be a ""sex in
the nightclub toilets"" sort of thing.  No, I do not normally wear lipstick,
smeared or otherwise.<br />&nbsp;</li> <li>How about that killer red-eye,
huh?  <lj user=""auroraslave"" /> thought her eyes looked so terrible, she
forbade me to upload this photo unless I did something to the image to
remedy the badness.  So I did!  Pretty subtle, huh?  I wonder if anyone
will notice...<br />&nbsp;</li> <li>No, I don't know why my nipples are
hard.  Now let us never speak of this again.</li>

<b>Terminator IV: Rise of the Goths</b><br />
</div></center><br />
<h3>Epilogue</h3>
Fortunately, not <em>all</em> the photos turned out blurry or bathed in
gamma radiation: <b>this one turned out ok!</b><br />
<br />
<b>Background:</b> Daniel, the consummate artist, wants a ""natural"" shot
of the party-goers.  So we have <lj user=""auroraslave"" /> <em>acting
natural</em> as she offers some vodka jellies to Wendy and SomeGuy,
who are also <em>acting natural</em>.  All-in-all, a very <em>natural</em>
shot. GO TEAM!!<br />

We have <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325980/""><i>Pirates of the
Caribbean</i></a> on DVD!  Again I say: this is the best movie released in
the last two years.  Orlando Bloom is suitably dashing and Geoffrey Rush is
suitably menacing, but Johnny Depp steals the show.  When I grow up, I
totally wanna be a pirate.  Or at least, <em>dress</em> like a pirate
(complete with eye-liner and a goatee).  I may have asked this already, but
does anyone have any idea where I'd be able to get some decent pirate-style
boots?  Also, I think I might need to learn how to fence.  And say ""ARRR!!""
a lot.<br />
<br />
<lj-cut text=""More about the Pirates DVD"">
It seems that <lj user=""auroraslave"" /> and I are not the only inhabitants
of Newtown who have been anticipating this release.  As we were buying our
copies on Thursday (one copy <em>each</em>, of course), the guy at the cash
register mentioned that when the DVD first went on sale (on Monday), the
store had a whole cardboard display devoted to <i>Pirates</i>.  When we left
the store, there was only one copy left.  ARRRR!!!!! (just
practicing)<br />
<br />
Other, less praiseworthy, features of the DVD include: <ul>
<li>a thoroughly un-entertaining ""Blooper Reel"".<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li>a collection of ""Deleted Scenes"", all of which suck.  The cutting-room
editors made the right choice.<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li>a front-cover which boasts <small>FROM THE PRODUCER OF
<i>ARMAGEDDON</i> AND <i>PEARL HARBOR</i></small>.  Now, ignoring for the
moment the issue of the (mis)spelling of ""harbour"", I'd just like to ask:
In what kind of DUMB PARALLEL UNIVERSE am I supposed to GIVE A FUCK
what other movies this SELF-AGGRANDIZING HAND-JOB has produced?
[Especially when those movies happen to be <i>Armageddon</i> and <i>Pearl
Harbor</i>.  I hate to break it to you, Jerry, but those movies
<em>SUCKED</em>.]  Exactly what is it that Mr Bruckheimer
contributes to the film-making process which earns him the right to scrawl the
names of two of his shittier flicks across the front-cover of this DVD?
And what makes him think that I, the buyer of this DVD, would have the
<em>slightest interest</em> in him or his career?  Enquiring minds want to
know.</li>

So, it's been... <em>just over six weeks</em> since my last update.
No, wait, strike that: it's been <em>just over six weeks</em> since I last
even <em>looked</em> at LiveJournal.<br />
<br />
Where have I been, you ask?  Well, uh, let's just say I've been somewhere
<strong>super-awesome</strong> and <strong>totally mega-interesting</strong>.
I most certainly did <em>not</em> spend the last six weeks working my arse
off towards a release which we still haven't made.  Hell no!  That would
be <strong>totally lame</strong>, which would make <em>me</em> totally
lame by implication!  <strong>Unlikely!!!!!!!!!!</strong>  <small>(Although,
to be fair, I did also spend a non-trivial amount of that time either asleep
or entertaining <lj user=""auroraslave"" />...  I mean, I <em>didn't</em> also
spend...  I <em>also</em> didn't spend...  ah fuckit.)</small><br />
<br />
So there I was, happily doing my thing, when <strong>suddenly</strong>,
with only <strong>two-to-three-months' warning</strong>, the <strong>next
semester</strong> started!  That's right, boys and girls: I'm back at uni
for the seventh year.<br />
<br />
My first class of 2004 was at 10am on Monday.  Being awake at 10am on a
Monday may not seem like a big deal to all you 9-to-5-working-day
punctuality-fascists, but my body clock runs on a 26-to-36-hour cycle.
Adjusting my sleeping patterns to coincide with this whole arbitrary
daytime/nighttime thing is like landing shit on Mars.  And we've all seen
how many times NASA has fucked <em>that</em> up, and they have way more
PhDs than I do.<br />
<br />
So anyway, Monday hit me like a rock between the eyes, and Tuesday was
pretty rough also.  I sort of stumbled through the rest of the week,
propelled mainly by inertia.  By Thursday afternoon I was exhausted.
Fortunately, being a part-time student, I have Fridays off.
Unfortunately, being a full-time dickhead, when I woke up, I decided that
the most productive way to spend my time was online.  And then I thought:
""LiveJournal.""<br />
<br />
So, here I am.<br />

A few weeks ago, our boss sprang another deadline on us... apparently he's hosting a conference on the campus next week, and he wants to demo the latest version of our software. ""I would like to demo"" he suggested in his usual round-about manner, ""some new functionality which you've added since [the last demo in] October."" ""Uh, sure"", we replied, as we all suddenly became very interested in the architecture of different corners of his office.

I shouldn't complain, though. Our boss has an amazing ability to make funding appear out of nowhere, and it is this funding which pays my wages. If he occasionally needs to announce insane deadlines to guarantee the continued influx of capital, so be it. We'd be pretty screwed (in terms of having something to demo) if we hadn't been keeping on top of things, but fortunately, we have.

<hr align=""center"" width=""40%"" />

The other beneficial upshot of this suddenly-announced conference is that my boss is paying to fly Hamish, my main partner in programming crime, back up to Sydney from Tasmania, where he was visiting his family for a few weeks. So hopefully, some of you should get to meet him this weekend.

We are the long-haired, black-clad, sarcastic core of our programming team. I'm the cynical goth programmer / mathematician with a taste for EBM and industrial music; he's the nihilist metalhead programmer / mathematician / philosopher who likes to head-bang to industrial and black metal: together, we fight crime!

In other news, after several weeks of sustained effort (and many months of learning and preparation), my princess seems to have gotten her foot into the proverbial door of the real, serious, programming-and-IT industry.

The first step is always the hardest, since it is determined largely by luck and other circumstances outside your control. All you can really do is make sure your skills are up to scratch, and keep looking and trying for positions.

She's been working extremely hard towards this, and it seems she may just have gotten her break.

Well done, you.

In other news (stolen from <a href=""http://slashdot.org/"">Slashdot</a>), <a href=""http://www.warprecords.com/"">Warp Records</a>, the independent music label which features Aphex Twin and Luke Vibert, has <a href=""http://www.warprecords.com/bleep/news.php?id=3"">released almost their entire catalogue</a> on <a href=""http://www.warprecords.com/bleep/"">Bleep</a>, a new digital download service.

Notable quotes from the <a href=""http://www.warprecords.com/bleep/faq.php"">FAQ</a> include:
<blockquote>We are at present the only store to offer very high quality MP3 files. The tracks are encoded with LAME [...] with the emphasis more on sound quality than file size. Bleep MP3s have an average bit rate of around 205kbps VBR, while the majority of MP3s found on the internet are 128kbps.</blockquote> It's long been a gripe of mine that most music on the net is encoded as 128kbps MP3s, which sound <strong>utterly shit</strong>.

They also <a href=""http://www.warprecords.com/bleep/faq.php?id=5"">claim</a> to be considering superior lossy formats such as AAC and OGG and ""even lossless compressed formats such as FLAC"".

<blockquote>Secondly, Bleep music has no DRM or copy protection built in. We believe that most people like to be treated as customers and not potential criminals - DRM is easily circumvented and just puts obstacles in the way of enjoying music.</blockquote> No DRM and no copy protection -- this is a <strong>very good thing</strong>: no-one else controlling your computer; no more albums which won't play properly. I don't think I need say any more.

<blockquote>After the bandwidth charges and Bleep running costs are subtracted, the artist gets half of the album or track price.</blockquote> Again, this is a good thing. I've <a href=""http://www.downhillbattle.org/itunes/index.html"">read</a> that an artist will get about 10 cents each time one of their tracks is downloaded from iTunes. That means that if 500 people pay to download the track, the artist will get about 50 dollars. Alright!! Now, how much did it cost to record and produce that track again?

Hopefully some other music labels will take note.

<lj-cut text=""WARNING: Extreme geekiness contained within"">
I first installed Linux on my own computer a little over five-and-a-half
years ago.  I was in my first year of uni, and the Department of Computer
Science (<a
href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/cyn_goth_prog/1393.html"">now the
School of I.T.</a>), which was in those days primarily a UNIX workshop,
gave every CS1 student a CD containing RedHat 5.1. [Remember the
""Blue CD"", <lj user=""darkstardeity"">?]<br />
<br />
Since then, my progression through the Linux distros has mirrored the rise
(and fall) of my own 1337ness:<ul>
<li>RedHat 5.2 (late 1998 - mid 1999)</li>
<li>SuSE 6.0 (mid 1999 - end of 2000)</li>
<li>Debian 2.2 (2001)</li>
<li>Slackware 8.0 (2002)</li>
<li>Debian 3.0 (2003)</li>
</ul>
You'll notice it forms kind of an arc.  Thus, when I got sick of Debian 3.0
(the result of a lot of little things, really -- like the fact that
the GCC version in Debian stable is <em>still</em> 2.95 <b>I MEAN COME
<em>ON</em> PEOPLE, 3.2 CAME OUT IN AUGUST OF 2002!!  GET WITH THE FUCKING
PROGRAMME!!!!</b>), <a
href=""http://www.suse.com/us/private/products/suse_linux/i386/index.html"">SuSE
9.0</a> was the obvious choice.  [Actually, I was also considering
<a href=""http://www.gentoo.org/"">Gentoo</a>, but since we <em>do not
yet have a working phone-line in the new house</em> (let alone a high-speed
net connection!), I was forced to postpone any experimentation.]<br />
<br />
And before the Debian apologists jump down my throat, I <em>understand</em>
why Debian places so much importance on stability, and I <em>understand</em>
why it is so difficult for them to upgrade to GCC 3.2 (ABI compatibility,
etc.).  But this really <em>highlights</em> the reasons why I'm moving away
from Debian on the desktop: ultimately, I'm running a programmer's
workstation, not a departmental server.  Up-to-date development tools [Each
successive G++ release after 3.1 makes 2.95 look more and more inadequate
for serious work] are more important to me right now than mission-critical
stability.  Plus, I'm moving more into audio development,
and SuSE has a history of being the ""multimedia distro"".  Way back in 1999,
SuSE 6.0 was the first Linux distro release to include out-of-the-box support
for my new Matrox Millennium video-card (half the XFree86 development team
seemed to work at SuSE.de).  These days, for example, SuSE.de employs the
two programmers who seem to do most of the work on the ALSA audio
drivers.  All in all, SuSE seemed like the right choice.<br />
<br />
Of course, Slackware is a broken heap of shit, and RedHat is ""moving away
from the desktop"" (news: <a
href=""http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1104_2-5101690.html"">New RedHat CEO Says
""Linux Not Ready For Consumer Market""</a>, <a
href=""http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/11/04/2312225&mode=thread"">Slashdot
Hyperventilates</a>), so I guess I'm stuck with SuSE, Debian and Gentoo.<br />
<br />
Anyway, enough distro-wank.<br />
<br />
About 38 hours ago, I finally finished the installation of SuSE 9.0 on my
machine.  It would have been 40 hours ago, but after 4 hours of partitioning
disks, configuring peripherals and selecting packages, the installation
process locked up while I was configuring XFree86, forcing me to re-boot and
start again.  Joy.  On my next attempt (which was mercifully successful --
due mainly, I expect, to the fact that I didn't try to configure XFree86),
I discovered that the XFree86 configuration stage was the very last step in
the installation process.  What a fucking clich&eacute;.<br />
<br />
To be fair, it took 4 hours the first time because I'm anally retentive
about system settings and everything has to be just <em>perfect</em>.
The first time I installed Debian, I was sitting there for about 24
hours.<br />
<br />
The lock-up aside, the installation process was very smooth.  I think this
is a Linux distro release which is finally simple enough for ""normal people""
to install.<br />
<br />
This distro really is aimed at ""regular users"".  Everything is bright and
shiny -- the icons even have specular highlights! (<a
href=""http://www.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jimmy/tmp/root.jpg"">screenshot of the
desktop</a>).  The whole system is very pointy-clicky.  The user interfaces
are, on the whole, intuitive and consistent, and I'm guessing you can run
most of the system without ever opening a shell.  It's all been integrated
into YaST and the KDE Control Center.<br />
<br />
It ships with complete ""home"" functionality -- web-browser, GUI-based mail
client, office suite, music and movie players (in contrast to RedHat 8.0
and RedHat 9, which were ""multimedia crippled"" to avoid the possibility
of legal trouble).  On the other hand, I was amazed to discover that it
did <em>not</em> ship with such basic programmer/sysadmin tools as CVS and
Stow!  I guess I've been spoiled by Debian and its ten-thousand packages.
So, I spent an hour or two today downloading a bunch of RPMs and tarballs,
and later tonight I guess I'll be typing ""make"" a lot.<br />
<br />
The best part about this new system?

Excerpts:
<blockquote><a href=""http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/living/columnists/dave_barry/7584591.htm"">Elsewhere in the War on Terror, the Department of Homeland Security urges Americans to stock up on food, water, flashlights, duct tape and plastic sheeting. Within hours, al Qaeda surrenders, stating: ``We cannot fight flashlights AND duct tape.''</a></blockquote>
and:
<blockquote><a href=""http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/living/columnists/dave_barry/7584592.htm"">They do not immediately uncover any weapons of mass destruction, but they do find a warehouse containing a large quantity of what is believed to be refined sugar, which CIA intelligence analysts note ``is a leading cause of tooth decay.''</a></blockquote>

25: Christmas was predictably stressful. Happy Birthday <lj user=""methedras"">!

26: Unfortunately, no LotR:RotK. On the up side, <lj user=""auroraslave""> came over for the afternoon (which was arguably more fun, *grin*).

27: Saw people at Vortex which was good, but I was antisocial -- I hadn't been out in months and I really needed to burn a lot of energy, so I spent most of the night on the hardfloor. Unfortunately, I only spent a small part of the night really truly engaged by the music. Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood. I did, however, particularly like your second set, <lj user=""decker""> (2:30, IIRC). Happy Birthday <lj user=""plastickitten"">!

28: Watched Zoolander. Didn't do much else.

29: Attempting to build up the momentum to either do some work or install new Linux. It's not really working. Watched Zoolander again.

30: I've watched Zoolander far too many times. Procrastination. My hours are all fucked-up because I should work, but I don't want to, but I'm unwilling to let myself sleep before I accomplish something. Tired and not thinking clearly, at all. Fuck. Stabby stab-stab death in the EYES with KNITTING NEEDLES. Your MOTHER. There was a huge slug in the kitchen early this morning, which angered me greatly, so I sprinkled some salt on it. This trick has never worked for me before, but this time it worked quite well: the slug gradually melted over the course of about two hours. I realise I am a bad person for doing this and that when I die, I will probably end up in the circle of hell reserved for those who pour salt on small animals. Or perhaps I will be reincarnated as a slug. I accept this. I accept the fact that I am a bad and sadistic person, but you have to understand: I hate slugs in my kitchen. It's dirty enough as is without trails of slime everywhere. When the slug was finished melting, there was a small puddle of slime left behind. I felt bad, so I cleaned it up with hospital-grade disinfectant. I don't think I'll pour salt on any more slugs.

There's probably a moral in that, somewhere.

I saw <a href=""http://www.supercrazymayhem.com/ornery/index.php?strip=84"">this [http://www.supercrazymayhem.com/ornery/index.php?strip=84]</a> on <lj user=""dios"">'s journal. I think it's great. When I grow up, I wanna be an ornery boy.

<blockquote>Dr Stuart Coleman, the leading researcher of a team studying Internet typos, has found that there is a conclusive link between kinds and frequency of typos, and intelligence.

The team studied over 1,000 subjects from every walk of life. The subjects were asked to perform several different tasks, from E-mail to instant messaging and even Internet message boards, and the researchers would document the typos made and how often they occurred.

""We decided to focus specifically on 'typos' that are typically used as Internet slang, instead of accident related typos,"" said Dr Coleman. ""These including things such as 'U-R' instead of 'you are.'""

[...]

When some of these people were asked to take IQ tests, few accepted. ""The ones who did enjoyed an average IQ of 57. That indicates severe mental retardation, or some form of brain trauma,"" said Dr Doucet.</blockquote>

My next two tasks to complete at work are: <ol> <li>implement some new
GUI functionality, and</li> <li>re-implement the floating-point core of
our application</li> </ol><br />
<br />
The first of these requires me to learn
<a href=""http://www.wxwindows.org/"">wxWindows</a>, which is fine by me
since I meant to learn it anyway.  The second of these requires me to
learn how IEEE floating-point arithmetic works.  After a few days' worth
of wandering around the net with the help of Google, I came to the
conclusion that there is quite a bit of decent introductory material on
the matter, but nothing at an intermediate level (it jumps straight to
<a href=""http://docs.sun.com/source/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html"">this
sort of thing</a> -- warning: long).<br />
<br />
So, I thought, I guess I'll just have to get my boss to <em>buy</em> me
a book on this stuff.  Another hour on Google and I found
<b>this</b>:<br />

<b>""Numerical Computing with IEEE Floating Point Arithmetic""</b><br />
</center><br />
The secretary ordered it.  It arrived on Friday.  When I got into the office,
I found it sitting on my desk.<br />
<br />
Now I'm not really the booknerd type, but I've been lusting after this book
for two weeks.  I've had fond daydreams about it.  I would think about it
before I went to sleep.  I've been imagining us growing old together, and
the memories we would share.<br />
<br />
It's still sitting there.  I haven't touched it.  I can't start reading it
till I've finished familiarising myself with the <a
href=""http://www.wxwindows.org/docs.htm"">wxWindows docs</a> and I feel like
I used to on Christmas morning when I woke up too early, then had to wait
till mum and dad got up before I could open my presents.  The book is
calling to me: ""Read me!  I need you to open me up and love me!"" but I
know that once I start, I won't be able to stop.  I start breathing
heavily when I look at it and the back of my neck feels hot and prickly.<br />
<br />
I'll post a review when I'm finished with it, but you know, a gentleman
doesn't kiss and tell.<br />
<br />

Fucking hell.  After all this anticipation, I bet this book is going to suck.<br />

No, not like that.

If you'd attempted to engage me in conversation at-or-around midday, last
Thursday (one week ago), you would probably have found me rather dazed and
uninteresting.  You see, having not slept in about two days, I had just
finished my last exam for the year: <i>Introduction To Modern Algebra</i>,
a second-year maths subject about inner-product spaces and group theory.
It was a pretty cool subject -- if the applications of group theory were at
times slightly surreal -- but the exam was the mental equivalent of being
gently slapped in the face for two hours.  I met up with Aurora afterwards
and we enjoyed a leisurely lunch in Newtown, before I wandered over to
Kennards at Camperdown to move a truckload of furniture and boxes out of
storage and into the new house.<br />
<br />
It was a hot and humid day, and shifting boxes and furniture was hot and
sweaty work.  Several hours and $240 later, all my junk had been shifted,
the removalists had gone, and I was arranging furniture in my room.
At about 8pm, I wandered over to Newtown's world-famous <b>Courthouse
Hotel</b> for dinner.  Some long-time friends, who several years ago chose
to abandon sophisticated Sydney in favour of sunny Brisbane, had just flown
down to visit for a week.  The revelry continued deep into the night.<br />
<br />
I woke up early Friday evening, just in time for a quick shower before
traveling in to Newtown again for breakfast/dinner with Aurora.  Food was
followed by a late session of the new Tarantino flick, <i>Kill Bill</i>.
It was sexy, stylish and ridiculously violent -- although apparently blood
really does spurt like that.  I'd rate <i>Kill Bill</i> as the second-best
thing I've seen in the last few years (beaten only by the magnificent
<i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>).  ""If you only see two films this year,
etc etc.""<br />
<br />
Saturday, Sunday and Monday were spent packing, cleaning, scrubbing and
vacuuming as I prepared to move out of the apartment at Kings Cross.
Tuesday and Wednesday slowly drained away as I made a half-hearted attempt
at unpacking the mountains of boxes of crap strewn about my bedroom and
the rest of the house.  For the first time in about five years, I have
curtains in my bedroom!  The price ($160) made me wince, but the curtains
(thick! burgundy! velvetine!) look <strong>good</strong>.<br />
<br />
This is my first day back at work since before exams.  So far, I've been
in the office for about 22 hours.  It feels good to be getting back into
the swing of things.  This summer, I plan to: <ul> <li>work hard, earn
$$$.</li> <li>spend a great deal of time with Aurora.</li> <li>install more
RAM into my machine, maybe a gig or so.</li> <li>buy a new HD, maybe one of
those 120 gig ones.</li> <li>wipe crappy old <a
href=""http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/"">Debian 3.0</a>; install shiny
new <a
href=""http://www.suse.com/us/private/products/suse_linux/i386/index.html"">SuSE
9.0</a>.</li> <li>learn <a href=""http://www.wxwindows.org/"">wxWindows</a> and
<a href=""http://www.midiworld.com/basics.htm"">MIDI</a> (<a
href=""http://www.borg.com/~jglatt/"">my new hero</a>).</li> </ul><br />
<br />
And, because this is the <strong>Internet</strong>, where we respond to
the depressing lack of human interaction with an insatiable craving for
<strong>content</strong>, I present to you:<br />
<br />
<b><center><a href=""http://www-personal.usyd.edu.au/~jboy1609/vad/"">Visualising

subject <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/cyn_goth_prog/5185.html"">I
mentioned (Friday)</a>.  A week of research; a week of hacking; two weeks to
write the goddamn report.  <small>[Note to self: in future, avoid tasks which
require communication skills.]</small>  Until I find a more permanent home
for this stuff (ie. a webserver which <i>(i)</i> doesn't charge me for disk
space, and <i>(ii)</i> doesn't care that I'm serving up fifty megs of MPEGs
and WAVEs), only the very last pair of thumbnails (the ""STFT combined
animations"") will work.  Enjoy!<br />

Truly, my life is now complete.  I have transcended mortal flesh to
<a href=""http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=02003-10-24&l=240#l"">become meme</a>.
Any highs or lows I may experience after today will be but a pale reflection
of this moment.<br />
<br />
I'd like to thank the world, for making me cynical;  Andrew Eldritch, for
showing me how a true goth is supposed to behave;  Usenet, for teaching me 
that I am but a single, indistinguishable instance of the ubiquitous cynical 
goth programmer/sysadmin stereotype;  and Jamie Zawinksi, for demonstrating 
that programmers can bitch and whine about work all the time and somehow 
retain a readership.  I'd like to thank Lloyd Wood (whom I've never actually
encountered in any form, electronic or otherwise) for sending this meme to 
NTK;  NTK for their repeated
<a href=""http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=02003-08-15&l=60#l"">generosity</a>; 
and everyone who ever bothers to read the crap I write.<br />
<br />
And now, there's really nothing left to do but use this brief moment in the
spotlight to push my own political agendas:  Free Software Forever!  U.S. 
Troops Out Of Iraq!!  NO SCRUBS!!!<br />

Thankyou all, and goodnight.<br />

The roads are empty, all of them. Even that main road which travels past the Domain, through a tunnel and over the Harbour Bridge is deserted.

Most of the sky-scrapers are dark; there are just a few brightly-lit offices here and there. Nevertheless, the whole horizon is light and the sky is an aqua-blue, as if the sun were just about to rise: but dawn is a few hours off at least.

The sky is completely clear of clouds or smoke, with diamond stars twinkling in the blue (""few and far between"", as the lyric goes). A full, bright moon is hanging heavy and low over the city, and the Centrepoint Tower is pointing straight up at Mars, an accusing finger aimed at the angry red dot.

A very gentle breeze is blowing, and the whole city is <em>silent</em>.

<br />
Well,
<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/cyn_goth_prog/4913.html"">that</a>

I spent some of Tuesday afternoon and most of Tuesday night working on an
assignment which was due on Wednesday morning.  This was the first assignment
of the first <strong>Computer Science</strong> subject I've done in
<strong>two full years</strong>.  Does everyone remember
<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/cyn_goth_prog/1393.html"">this
post</a>?  That's right, this assignment had to be done <strong>entirely
in Windows</strong>.<br />

Now, I'm a fairly fast typist, which means that by the time I notice a typo,
I've already typed some words after it.  When you're typing in Linux, it's
very easy to delete a whole word at a time, which is much faster than hitting
backspace for every character in the word, especially if your typo is a few
words back.  I've been using Linux for long enough that, as soon as I notice
a typo, I instinctively begin deleting words.<br />
<br />
For those of you who are not familiar with the subtle
differences between Linux and Windows:<ul>
<li>In Linux, Control-W means ""Delete the last word I typed"".</li><br />
<li>In Windows, Control-W means ""Close the window in which I am currently
working.  Do not double-check whether I really want to do this, and do
<strong>not</strong> offer to save my work"".</li><br />
</ul>
Yep, you guessed it: I'd get three-quarters of the way through a sentence,
notice a typo a few words back, and hit Control-W a few times to get back
there. Then <i>voil&aacute;</i>!  My work was gone.  This happened, oh, maybe
thirty or forty times.  Sigh.  It was a long night.<br />
<br />
At least my sysadmin installed <i>Win4Lin</i> for me, so I could listen to
my music and check mail while I was working.  <i>Win4Lin</i> rocks out.<br />
<br />
<h3>Wednesday</h3>
<br />
I finally got that damned assignment in, and then I spent the rest of the day
sitting like a zombie in my classes.  Needless to say, I slept well that
night.<br />
<br />
<h3>Thursday</h3>
<br />
I woke up at 1:30pm, which was the perfect time to check mail and find out
that there was a presentation on at uni (45 minutes away by train then bus)
from 1pm to 2pm, being given by a new games company which is opening in
Sydney and looking to recruit new talent.  Sigh.  It's ok, I didn't really
want to work as a games programmer anyway.<br />
<br />
And, oh yes, I spent Thursday night and the wee small hours of Friday morning
reading
<a href=""http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1199.asp"">this
article</a> (and the
<a href=""http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/topic.asp?topic_id=25314"">accompanying
forum thread</a>) about quaternions.  For those who have no idea what I'm
talking about,
<a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Quaternion.html"">quaternions</a> are
a mathematical construction used by physicists and programmers
to control how objects rotate in games and 3D spatial simulations.  And they
<strong>Kick Fucking Arse</strong>.<br />
<br />
<h3>Friday</h3>
<br />
I spent most of Friday afternoon wandering around in the sun doing various
chores, which I really didn't like.  After years of being either inside or
asleep during the daylight hours, my tolerance for heat and direct sunlight
is <strong>low</strong>.  I <strong>stupidly</strong> forgot to drink lots of
water, and when I arrived at uni at about 3:30pm I was fairly dehydrated and
not thinking too clearly <em>at all</em>.<br />
<br />
Which was just <strong>great</strong>, because I had to write up a proposal
describing the
<a href=""http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/~nigel/sv/project.html"">visualisation
project</a> I want to do for the Scientific Visualisation subject I'm taking.
This proposal was due by 5pm, and if the lecturers can even <em>understand</em>
the nonsensical gibberish I typed up, I'll be impressed.<br />
<br />
<h3>Saturday/Sunday</h3>
<br />
Spent the whole of Saturday house-hunting.  Sigh.  I'd forgotten how tiring
and frustrating the whole process is.<br />
<br />
For various reasons -- which will become apparent in my next post -- I did not
end up going out on Saturday night.  I <em>had</em> intended to spend some
time at <i>Die Maschine</i>.  This is, of course, not intended to insult the
organisers or DJs of <i>Kontrol</i> by implying that their club is
sub-standard:  I just wanted to check out this new club on its opening
night.<br />
<br />
So, <em>did</em> anyone actually end up making their way to <i>Die
Maschine</i>?  What was it like?  Was it more like 
<a href=""http://www.weebls-stuff.com/data/toons/badger.swf"">Vortex Dark
Floor</a> or <a href=""http://www.weebls-stuff.com/data/toons/cats.swf"">Vortex
Hard Floor</a>?  Justify your answer, citing relevant examples to support your
arguments.<br />
<br />
Sunday afternoon was a family get-together for the so-called ""Father's Day"".
It was nice, except there were too many dogs.<br />
<br />
<h3>Yesterday</h3>
<br />
What the fuck did I do yesterday?  I don't really know.<br />
<br />
<h3>Today</h3>
<br />
Working late tonight;  I got through an imperial fuck-pound of work, which is
good.  I've been way behind since I got sick.<br />
<br />
And oh, <strong>Sweet, Delicious Christ</strong>!  <i>The Crispy Inn</i>
bakery at Newtown makes the <strong>best</strong> rum-balls
<strong>ever</strong>!  It's like an orgasm in your mouth -- the good sort
of orgasm in your mouth, that is, not the unpleasant sort which your partner
expects you to swallow.<br />
<br />
And yes, it really has been a <strong>whole week</strong> since I last read
LiveJournal!  I need to catch up on a <strong>whole week's worth</strong> of
your collected anarchy, anger, apathy and angst.  Emoticon!<br />

Another <i>Vortex</i>: another great night out.<br />
<a name=""transportation""><br /></a>
<h3>Transportation; Complication</h3>
<br />
Due primarily to the fact that <lj user=""auroraslave""> and I didn't start
getting ready till 9:30pm, we didn't actually get out of the house until
after midnight.  I'm currently living about 200 metres down the road from
King's Cross station, but we weren't sure whether the trains would still
be running, so we hailed the first cab we saw, jumped in, and instructed
the driver: ""<strong>Corner of King and Kent Streets in the City, man,
and step on it!</strong>""<br />
<br />
In retrospect, perhaps this was not the correct thing to say, as our driver
proceeded to select a less-than-optimal route.  What should have been a
five-dollar trip from King's Cross station to the QVB was soon approaching
ten.  Our cab-driver didn't really seem to know his way around the city
streets, and at ten dollars fifty, we asked him to stop, paid up, and jumped
out to complete the journey on foot.  We were soon approaching the City Hotel,
and as we crossed the final set of lights, we were shocked and stunned by
what we saw...<br />
<br />
<lj-cut text=""--More--"">
A queue!  A QUEUE!!!  <strong>A <em>queue</em> to get into Vortex!</strong>
And this wasn't a queue of five-to-ten people, waiting in line because
they all arrived at once and the bouncers were checking IDs.  Oh no,
this was a queue of <strong>thirty-to-forty people</strong>, and what's
more, it was moving at a snail's pace!  We must have waited in that queue
for <em>twenty minutes</em>, while our enthusiasm dampened and our
barely-contained excitement turned to boredom.<br />
<br />
Now I understand <em>in theory</em> the principle of waiting in a queue to
get into a night-club, and I even understand that it's a phenomenon which
Normals take for granted, as they pack into their trendy clubs with names
like ""Home"" and ""Metropolis""; clubs which are filled to bursting-point with
men and women wearing white pants, or khaki pants, or some shade of pants
whose hue, saturation and brightness lie towards the lighter end of the
fabrico-chromatic spectrum; clubs echoing with the shrill vocals of the
latest hit by <i>Britney</i> or <i>Aqua</i> or <i>Kylie</i> or <i>Blink
182</i>.<br />
<br />
But waiting in a queue to gain entry to one of my beloved goth clubs is
something I've simply never done before!  I wasn't <em>affronted</em>, so
much as <em>worried</em> -- my imagination was running wild, conjuring all
manner of grim scenarios.  What if the City Hotel was full to capacity, and
people in the line would only be allowed <em>in</em> as others came
<em>out</em>?  It might be <em>hours</em> till I got in, especially if none
of the Hard Floor DJs emptied the dance-floor by playing that stupid ""All
Your Base"" song.  Or what if the reason the line was
moving so slowly was that the bouncers had attained a new level of paranoia
about the possibility of drugs being smuggled into the club, and were
performing full body-cavity-searches upon everyone who wished to enter??
Not only would that be uncomfortable, it would probably make my dancing look
even more stiff and awkward than usual.<br />
<a name=""dark""><br /></a>
<h3>Dark Floor; Guest DJs</h3>
<br />
Generally, when I arrive at Vortex, I'll start out on the Dark Floor.
Later, I might spend a few hours oscillating between the two floors as
the music attracts or repels.  Eventually, I'll end up on the Hard Floor,
aiming to burn off several weeks'-worth of pent-up energy and aggression
in a violent fit of thrusting, thrashing, slashing and stomping.  I'm not
exaggerating this -- as we were standing around on the footpath after the
club, trying to work out where we were all heading, a friend told me that
it was good to see me ""cutting loose"".  I suspect my dancing style on the
Hard Floor is the sort of ""cutting loose"" which could break teeth and
permanently damage eye-sight.<br />
<br />
When I finally got into the club and onto the Dark Floor (at about 1am, I
think), the music was great.  It was one of the regular Dark Floor DJs --
I should really know his name, but it's currently eluding me.  As always,
the social atmosphere was great.  I spoke to friends I hadn't seen in weeks
or months, and I even encountered a few I hadn't seen in years.<br />
<br />
Next to spin the discs were a pair of guest DJs from Melbourne's
<i>Psychonaut</i>.  I've heard some interesting comments about their method
of DJ-ing, namely, that they tend to assemble sets where the style of music
changes dramatically from song to song.  Apparently our more sophisticated
southern cousins don't bat an eyelash in the face of such musical chaos,
but several residents of Sydney who were exposed to this form of trauma,
known as ""<i>audio-psychonautical assault</i>"" (or <i>A.P.A.</i>), while
on vacation in Melbourne, report that they were gripped by intense feelings
of anxiousness, disorientation and acute inner turmoil.<br />
<br />
I didn't catch enough of the guest DJs' set to be able to confirm or deny
this rumour, but I will say this: their set was quite different to the
usual sort of Dark Floor set.  Some of the songs they played would have
been more at home (at Vortex) on the Hard Floor.  Personally, I thought that
the music was quite alright.  So did another fifteen or so inhabitants of
the Dark Floor.  The rest sat down.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, just as I was really getting into it, they changed the music
again, back to slower, more ""gothy"" songs.  Normally, of course, I would be
quite happy with this sort of music, but this was not a normal situation.
By now, my pulse was racing and the blood was flying through my veins.
The flood-gate had been opened, and I was in no mood to close it again.
I wanted to burn energy.  I needed to continue dancing fast and hard.
And so, down I went to the Hard Floor.<br />
<a name=""hard""><br /></a>
<h3>Hard Floor; Final Hour</h3>
<br />
Having been thus accelerated into the mood for loud, screechy/bleepy/thumpy
music, I stayed on or around the Hard Floor for the rest of the night.
Frustratingly, I found the selection of music to be fairly hit-and-miss,
which didn't provide me with much of an opportunity to dance.  Of course,
I am mindful of the truism that ""you can't please all the people all the time"",
but people <em>do</em> attend a club with certain expectations about the music.
I don't think the majority of Vortex patrons would react so well to a hip-hop
set, for instance.<br />
<br />
Whenever there was a sucky song playing, I'd wander off and do that whole
""being social"" thing.  I assumed the Hard Floor was just experiencing a rough
patch.  But as the songs came and went, and the overall quality remained
uninspiring, I began to worry.  I had not been burning nearly enough energy,
and at this rate, I would be going home disappointed.  In an attempt to
cut my losses, I resolved to remain on the floor and keep dancing,
regardless of whether I actually liked the current song or not.<br />
<br />
Around 3:30, I think it was (although I hadn't been paying enough attention
to the clock to be certain), the music began to improve.  It still wasn't
hard or fast enough to encourage me to really ""cut loose"" (to use that
strange phrase again), but it was a definite improvement.  The so-called
""Hard Floor"" had been decidedly <tt>*soft*</tt> the whole time I'd been down
there, and I wasn't holding out much hope that this situation was going to
improve.<br />
<br />
Then suddenly, around 4:30, the music went into overdrive.  Faster, harder,
more energetic.  <em>This</em> was music which would burn energy.  And it
didn't slow down again, either.  It maintained its momentum as the minutes
ticked by and 5am drew ever closer.  We were watching the clock, trying to
estimate how much longer we had until the dreaded Fuck-Off Song, while at
the same time desperately hoping that it would not be the next one.  And 5am
drew closer... and closer...  and <em>closer</em>... and then it <em>was</em>
5am.  But, inexplicably, the music was still playing, and it wasn't telling
us to fuck off.  And we realised, with a mixture of awe and relief, that the
music was going to continue <em>beyond</em> 5am.  And it <em>did</em> continue:
song after song after song.  All hard, all fast, all burning away the pent-up
aggression and frustration of everyday life.  And the music continued until
about 5:30, I think it was, when the Fuck-Off Song at last made its inevitable
appearance, and the crowd began to disperse.<br />
<br />
I have to congratulate the DJs' perceptiveness, in realising that the music
hadn't been satisfying the crowd, and acting to remedy the situation by
extending the club and playing the harder music.  Now, all they need to do
is replace the Fuck-Off Song with something like ""Come To Daddy"" or
""Firestarter"", to <em>exhaust</em> the dancers at the end of the night instead
of just telling them to fuck off, and all will be right in the world.<br />
<a name=""people""<br /></a>
<h3>People</h3>
<br />
So, all-in-all, the music didn't turn out too bad.  But what <em>really</em>
made last night a great night was the <strong>people</strong>.  [Cue audience:
<em>awwwwww!</em>]<br />
<br />
Naturally, I saw a multitude of LiveJournal friends -- and no, I'm not going
to name you all individually...  I may have become a LiveJournal
attention-whore, but I'm not yet enough of a karma-whore to list your names,
each and every one of you, each and every time I see you.  Suffice it to say
that it was great to see you, and I love you all, both collectively and as
individuals.<br />
<br />
I also made a number of <em>new</em> LiveJournal friends, whom I <em>will</em>
name; partially as a form of introduction, and partially because you might be
wondering who the hell I am and how the hell I know you, or why I just decided
to add you.  Firstly, we have <lj user=""zoog""> and <lj user=""destroyx"">:
of course, I met you at the Placebo concert, but we didn't really have much
of a chance to talk on that occasion.  Also, <lj user=""rustythoughts"">, with
whom I've been acquainted for a while in Real Life... I just never made the
connection between Real Life and your username, I guess.  Shrug.  Finally,
we have <lj user=""ozgenre"">, <lj user=""shudrel""> and <lj user=""crystaljaded"">:
I used to read your posts back before I had a journal of my very own, when I'd
put on <lj user=""auroraslave"">'s underwear and read her
<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/auroraslave/friends"">friends
page</a>.  So it's ok, I know you're not serial killers or anything.  Or if
you <em>are</em> serial killers, you don't post about it on LiveJournal.
Which is probably for the best.<br />
<br />

<strong>A quick note about ""friends"" lists:</strong>
I add people to my ""friends"" list because I've either met them in Real Life
and they seem like decent enough folk, or because by some form of coincidence
I stumbled across their journal and their posts are so brilliantly
scintillating that each word lights up my day.  In other words, I add people
to my ""friends"" list so that I can read their posts without a whole bunch of
extra clicking.  I never make ""friends only"" posts, so I don't need to worry
about whether I trust people with my deepest darkest secrets.  I understand
that this is all a lot more complicated for other people, so I promise not
to be the least bit offended if you choose not to add me to <em>your</em>
friends list.<br />
</div>
<br />
And! Also! In addition!  Before I finish, I just want to say that I met not
one, but <strong>two</strong> people at Vortex who don't have LiveJournals!
<strong>Two!!</strong>  <strong>No LiveJournals involved!!</strong>
Holy shit, this is how normal people interact!  Admittedly, one of them
doesn't really count, I guess, since she's the flat-mate of the LiveJournal
friend who made the introduction.  But it's still pretty
impressive.  There may just be hope for the human race yet.</lj-cut><br />

I was just looking back over emails from last Thursday (the one eight days
ago, not the one yesterday) and it turns out that I actually <em>did</em>
have an ear ache on Thursday morning.  In fact, according to those emails,
the ear ache was so bad that I popped some cold-n-flu pills and jumped back
into bed until the pain-killers kicked in.<br />
<br />
Once the pain had subsided, I stepped under a nice hot shower, which was
great until the hot water ran out (about five minutes later).  I ate my
breakfast while I checked out the morning's LiveJournal posts.  Due to a
<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/cyn_goth_prog/3351.html"">sudden
flurry of posting</a>, I spent too long in front of LJ, and I had to
rush to the train-station to make it to the office by 2pm.  Why the rush,
you ask?  At 2pm, I was supposed to <strong>interview a potential new
co-worker</strong>!<br />
<br />
<lj-cut text=""--More--"">
I just missed a train, then just missed a bus, and I eventually got into the
office at exactly two o'clock.  The potential had already arrived, and my
boss had begun describing our project.  He always seems to really enjoy this
part, and the potential was looking a little dazed as my boss talked and
talked and talked.  [I remember scrawling pages and pages of notes during
<em>my</em> interview all those months ago.  I didn't even bother trying
to process what my future boss was saying at the time, I just concentrated
on getting it all down.  I didn't really understand what the project was
about until I went over my notes afterwards.] I sat down at the desk with
a cup of black tea (didn't have time to go out and buy some milk) and the
interview began.<br />
<br />
After years of being interviewed for various positions, it felt really strange
to be on the metaphorical ""other side of the desk"".  My brain had formed
the neural connection ""interview = stress! pressure! examination conditions!!
Shit!! Shit!! Shit!! Don't fuck it up or you won't get the job!! Don't fuck it
up don't fuck it up don't fuck it up don't fuck it UP!!!!"".
The rush of adrenaline had caused my pulse to quicken, and the
fight-or-flight reaction was making it difficult to think clearly and
objectively about the qualifications of this potential new co-worker,
someone who would have direct commit access to our precious code.<br />
<br />
The night before the interview, I tried to forestall any stupid
behaviour on my part by trying to guess how I was likely to react.
The first thing I realised was that I was probably in danger of a
power trip.  Years of being the one being interviewed, the one on a
six-month trial period, the one at the bottom of the heap (but believing
that I was better than that), were threatening to exact their revenge.
I actually promised myself (out loud -- there was no-one else in the office)
that I would not be an arrogant arsehole.  I wouldn't be smug or superior.
I would not be condescending.<br />
<br />
It then struck me: how <em>should</em> I behave?  What questions should I
ask?  What the hell should I say?  How should I gain the insights which will
enable me to determine whether this person was suitable for the job?  Years
of experience with interviews had not prepared me for this.  It's never
mentioned in CS courses, nor is it discussed on the various tech-discussion
websites around the net.<br />
<br />
I thought back to my own interviews: if I were being interviewed by someone,
what would I most appreciate?  Being treated as an intelligent, competent
programmer, I supposed.  I would want my interviewers to begin with the
assumption that I was suitable for the job, and then make it their task to
find the proof which verified that assumption.<br />
<br />
So I wrote down a list of questions: most of them dealt with the obvious
requirements (<i>CVS</i>, etc.); some of them were designed to assess the
potential's communication skills; a final few were more abstract, based
upon the idea that this person had the appropriate skills, if I could come
up with the correct sequence of probing questions to unearth them.<br />
<br />
Well, I didn't unearth these secret skills, so I guess I didn't come up with
the appropriate sequence of questions.  I can only take this as evidence that
I have not yet completed my training.<br />
<br />
No green lightsaber for me, yet. Maybe next time.</lj-cut><br />

"event","When I was younger, I almost never dreamed. If I ever <em>did</em> dream, it was invariably a nightmare. This lack of clouds and rabbits in my sleep used to make me sad, especially come Show-N-Tell day each week, when my school-friends would all recount their dreams and get gold stars, but I, who had no dreams to recount, would be forced to stand in the corner for the rest of the day. I wished I could dream.

This absence of dreams continued through my teen years. My friends were all having wet dreams and spurting their teenage semen all over everything in sight. If <tt>*I*</tt> wanted to spurt semen all over everything in sight, I had to do it while awake. It was a very conscious process.

By the time I'd reached adult-hood, I'd abandoned my dream of dreaming. Zadok Rabinwitz once said ""A man's dreams are an index to his greatness"". I had resigned myself to the fact that my greatness would remain un-indexed.

And then, <strong>it began</strong>! In my adult years, the first years in my life when I actually began to work hard, the first years in my life when I actually needed a full night's sleep, <strong>I began to dream</strong>. And those dreams were <strong>stupid</strong>.

No longer nightmares, oh no, these dreams were full of nonsense which would cause me to toss and turn in my sleep, and finally wake the next morning feeling unrested and irritable.

Take, for example, the dream which poisoned my sleep last night: Deborah Harry (of the 80s pop group <i>Blondie</i>) was going door-to-door selling journaling filesystems. My mother, who has a habit of buying things she really doesn't need, decided that she needed a journaling filesystem. [For reference, my whole family still runs Windows on their computers, and my mother is willfully computer illiterate.] So she jumped in the car, and was going to follow Deborah back to the factory to buy one. [Deborah didn't carry journaling filesystems on her person. Instead, her limousine followed her around the streets at a discrete distance, and whenever she was about to make a sale, she jumped in her limo and led the way back to the factory.]

I remember becoming very agitated as I tried to convince my mother that she had absolutely no use for a journaling filesystem. My mother was enthusiastic, and quite adamant: ""Deborah says that a journaling filesystem is just what I need.""

I recall one line in particular (delivered without any sense of irony) from my futile attempts to reason with her: ""Just because she was the lead singer of an 80s pop group, that doesn't make her an expert on journaling filesystems.""

I think I eventually just grabbed the keys out of the ignition and ran back to the house.

As you may or may not have known, I've been a little bit sick for the last
week and a bit.  It was initially a sore throat, but developed into a
head-cold, then it seemed like I was almost better (on Thursday), but
then it turned into an ear ache on Friday.<br />
<br />
Depending on how much human anatomy you've studied, you may or may not
be aware that your ears are joined to the back of your throat by tubes.
This explains how a head-cold (which is typically based in your nose or
sinuses, which are connected to the back of your mouth), can turn into
an ear ache.  Another interesting effect is that, if these tubes fill
up with mucus, you can't hear anything.  The <em>most</em> interesting
effect is that, if this mucus gets infected, or hardens, or both, it
can become painful to chew and swallow, as chewing and swallowing causes
these tubes to be flexed.  [As an aside, this explains why swallowing
can help adjust the pressure in your ears when you're in an aeroplane.]<br />
<br />
On Friday, my ears were sort of hurting and my jaw and ears hurt when I
chewed or swallowed (which, as I've already
<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/cyn_goth_prog/3324.html"">mentioned</a>,
really puts a cramp on my social life, haw haw, another reference to blowjobs!).
I downed a bunch of cold-n-flu pills (which contain Codeine and Paracetamol)
and then downed some <i>Panadeine Forte</i>s for good measure.  I generally
try to avoid pain-killers (I really dislike relying on any drugs, with the
exception of coffee and the occasional cold-n-flu pill), but I couldn't
even think straight.  By the way, Codeine + Paracetamol + more Codeine +
more Paracetamol = feeling very happy about the world.  I later bought some

<i>Nurofen</i> from the chemist, who told me that taking that much Paracetamol
would destroy my liver very quickly.  The Codeine would just make me horribly
constipated.  [<i>Panadeine Forte</i> contains Codeine and Paracetamol;
<i>Nurofen</i> contains Ibuprofen.]<br />

By Saturday, I couldn't eat and I was biting the inside walls of my mouth
to try to distract myself from the pain.  I decided I really wasn't in the
mood to leave the house, and opted-out of a few party-like events
which were taking place that night.  The whole lower-left side of my face
felt like it was throbbing, especially at the back of my mouth, in my
jaw-bone and jaw muscles.  I hadn't been able to close my mouth for two
days.<br />
<br />
And guess what, kids!  It turns out the problem was 
<strong>actually</strong>...<br />

On Sunday, in a great deal of discomfort, I went to see my dentist.
I didn't yet know that it was my teeth, but I figured that if it was 
anything to do with my mouth or jaw, he would be able to help, or at least 
agree that what I was experiencing was probably quite painful.<br />
<br />
Some history: my wisdom teeth have been gradually emerging over the last
half-year or year, and they first started giving me grief a few months ago.
This ""grief"" was nothing more than low-level aching for about a week at a time,
generally around the time an assignment was due, so I never bothered to get the
teeth pulled or anything like that.  I vaguely intended to have them seen-to
during the last uni holidays (about a month ago, perhaps?) but the whole
moving-house thing consumed all my time and energy.<br />
<br />
So these teeth have been breaking through my gums slowly but surely (and by
slowly, I mean <strong>s-l-o-w-l-y</strong>...  there's not enough space in
my lower jaw for these extra teeth, so their progress has been impeded by
my other teeth and my jaw-bone).  Which means that the gum is still mostly
covering the teeth, with small ""tears"" at the front, where the teeth are
forcing their way out.<br />
<br />
What had happened is this: the infection which was causing my ear ache had
made its way back down into my mouth, and it found its way through these
""tears"" in my gum to get to my wisdom teeth.  So the gum around the wisdom
teeth became infected and swollen, which meant that there was greater pressure
on my wisdom teeth, and each time I closed my mouth or tried to chew, this
would squeeze the infected gum, which as we all know, is never pleasant.<br />
<br />
A happy ending: fortunately, my dentist was quick to write me a script for
some antibiotics.  He also gave me a few bottles of <i>Difflam-C</i>, which
I mentioned
<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/methedras/216253.html?thread=2799037#t2799037"">here</a>,
so now, I just need to wait for the swelling to go down and then I can eat
properly again.<br />
<br />
<strong>YAY!</strong>

You're Cady. (pronounce Katie) You are very smart and very trusting. You want nothing more than people to accept you and like you. And as a result you happen to get caught up in a lot of 'mind games' You're very creative and funny. And your job within the clique is comic releif. Be Nice, and Watch Your Back!"

"event","Usually I'm a big fan of the Post.  When my mom doesn't take the paper to work, I can usually get my hands on the Style section, and the part where they spot ""celebrities"" (a.k.a. elected officials, lobbyists, etc.) at places like baseball games or fancy restaurants.  The weekly magazine isn't bad either, especially Date Lab where they force two typical Washingtonians out on a date, pictures and all, and even though they're usually pretty painful, sometimes they end up going home together, thus making the Post seem youthful and risque.

But today the Post claims that polar bears are gonna die out pretty fast, thanks to some crazy theory made famous by a former veep.

They need to check their facts.  Thanks to Lost, we all know that polar bears can indeed survive in tropical climates, and we can look forward to the day when we can all live together in harmony when the world is covered in lush tropics and warm beaches and we don't have to waste time shovelling driveways, wearing ugly yet practical boots, and using up world resources to heat our homes."

"event","So I think this election really has restored my faith in the American people.  Think about it: Bush has been in office since before our generation was old enough to vote.  Although the Clinton administration was certainly a huge chunk of our lives, most of us weren't terribly concerned about politics during his reign (although if you read the paper in middle school, that's pretty hardcore!).  Anyways, at least for me, it seemed as though we were going to keep electing useless people for decades to come.  But, no!  Apparently, the American people have finally woken up to what some of us have been saying for a while.  Remember the primary campaign?  And a certain candidate speaking out against the war?  And wait.... what was on the voters' minds on Tuesday?  See, some people are just ahead of the times.  And it turns out that the rest of the country eventually catches up.

For example, the great people of Iowa.  Now, I was only there for a few days to do GOTV, but it was pretty clear from the numbers that a huge amount of people (independents) were all over the democrats.  I'm pretty sure they just voted straight down the ticket, without even looking at the candidates.  Just D, D, D, D, D.

This is even more apparent in my lovely hometown.  Let's do a little comparative analysis.  Iowa: coordinated campaign, active and engaged county party, full-time staffers, experienced volunteers, high-quality candidates.  Pretty much a golden ticket to win.  Now.... here: completely uncoordinated campaign, where candidates of the same party barely tolerate each other, an even more useless county party that doesn't know what GOTV stands for, zero staffers, a few motivated volunteers left over from the local DFA, but they aren't put to work, and pretty much the most useless, least idealistic, power-hungry, social-climbing candidates around (not all - there a few shining stars of hope).  Yet, they managed to win by HUGE margins, despite their flat-out lack of organization and borderline disdain for the voters.  Obviously, people were voting straight down the ticket.  Because the Republicans around here are a well-oiled machine - they just had no chance this round because the democrats actually showed up to the polls.  Of course, the local dems are going to spend the next two years patting themselves on the back for their great accomplishments - they have no incentive to build a credible organization.  (By the way, somebody - and this coulda been the state party - actually put out door hangers reminding dems to vote - except they didn't print the ""paid for by..."" authorization line on the lit, which is a MAJOR campaign violation.  uselss.)

But... we won!  And hopefully I can get outta this town ASAP.

On another note, check this out: http://video.msn.com/v/en-ap/v.htm?f=ILCHS&g=FC0F97B9-97EE-412E-A45D-5717439CD726&p=&t=s60&rf=http%3a%2f%2fsuntimes.com%2findex.html&

Okay, you don't actually have to look at it.  But it's a news report about the K-Fed concert the other night in Chicago, where tickets were being given away for free.  Clearly, people showed up just to see if he would comment on his impending divorce.  The point of this clip is that it was put out by the AP.  That's right.  The frickin Associated Press.  A reporter and camera crew on the ground doing interviews about the K-Fed concert.  Now, I understand that the AP is pretty much the king of comprehensive reporting in that they report everything that happens all around the world, but this really seems to go too far.  Now, if they just released a statement about how the tickets were being given away and he was cancelling some tour dates, that would be fine.  But to actually pay people to go out and film interviews on the topic really seems like a waste of money.  Isn't this more along the lines of Inside Edition?  Access Hollywood?  All those other shows we flip to when the real news is too depressing?  Come on, AP, get it together!"

"event","There was a dead bird on my front porch this morning.  It had clearly been malled by some creature.  Which is strange because I don't have a pet that could have done this.  Unless the hermit crabs got out of their cage and outside and were able to take down a creature 10 times their size, and then get back in their cage before morning, in which case I have severely underestimated Auf'd and Shorty."

I went to TETA me and sarah scored a two which sucks but you only live once and I thought we did a really good job. so what evea on the upside while we were there I learned to swing dance stage fight with my hands a fencing sword and a broad sword signed up for two colleges and had a great annaversory with sarah it even rained on us which made me really really happy and we got to see this amazing amazing guy J-BRO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! who was doing solo pantamime he was aweinspiring I feel sorry for all the other guys that didnt get to see him he was so good we went back to see him a second time. there were some down sides to the trip and if you really cared just ask me and I will tell you. yesterday I was with sarah and this college called me one of the ones I signed up for and wants me to audition so thats pretty cool it makes me feel good about myself. thats really all that has happened I have just been reherseing and that is well all that reherseing could be I guess. thats all. you guys have a teriffic day"

"event","so the cast list got put up. and just as I had been fearing all day I am going to be the one that has to shave his head. oh well you only live once right. she wants it bald and shinny lol. that sucks. I am going to look stupid. really really really really really really really stupid. 

Sarah got the part she wanted well sort of it is like half really because ""we have to expand the department"" so everything is dubble cast. they could have just made them all extras I mean half if not more are freshmen and when I was a freshmen I could only be a extra I am kinda pissed that the whole paying your dues ended after my year. that is bullshit. oh well I think it was a valuble lesson to learn. and if the others dont get it then what ever. I am really happy for sarah that is the part she wanted and I knew she could do it. I hope you feel better sarah!!!!!!!!!!! 

My mom asked me to not make plans today because ""we would be going driving"" but it is like two. at three we have to go and do this thing for tylers mom that will take about an hour. and then I am going to see a play and I should probably leave here at like 6. and I still have to get ready so I dont think that is going to happen. which pisses me off they keep getting my hopes up and saying I am going to be getting my license soon and then not letting me do it. what the fuck I am eighteen I should have already gotten it. they promised that I would get it on my birthday and instead they didnt let me drive for 3 weeks in a row. and then they let me drive home the other day and now it seems to have stopped once again. I should have just gone in and paid for the test and done it without them. 

well I have to go I will maybe update if things would slow down enough for me to think everyonce in a while. bye"

"event","Name 10 things (in no particular order) that make you happy and tag five others

1) being on stage... this one is a little weird seeing as some people are afraid of being infront of people but thats the only time I really feel normal. like I fit in. I can be walking down the hall and feel nervous or afraid that I am going to do something stupid or trip and make an idiot out of myself but when I am on stage all of that changes and I feel like I can really be myself. 

2) rain, Rain is the most romantic weather ever. being out in the rain to me it represents a totall disregard for ones self and an emotion taking over all your senses and coming together in a true unfeeling uncaring happiness that you have finially realized what you have to do. and also it reminds me that one day when me and sarah are out in the pouring rain I am going to dance with her and tell how much I truely love her. and this leads into my next one

3) Smiling. not like the smiling that comes from a funny joke but the smiling that comes from you being so happy that you cant help but smile where your whole body tingles and you just smile.

4) talking to people and them laughing at what I am saying. gives me a sort of warm fuzzy feeling 

5) movies... I have always loved movies and watching people act. and now that I have matured and started to act myself I see the things that I didnt before and I have just learned to love them even more

6) playing guitar. its just fun I dont plan on doing anything with it but I like learning how to play new things. and when no one is looking I break out the guitar and sing at the top of my lungs and jump around like I am playing on stage infront of people

7) helping people when they arnt feeling well. or when they are sad. I like to make people feel better. and be happy and giving advice.

8) when I solve the rubiks cube infront of people and they freak out. it makes me smile because it isnt that hard and they flip out and are totally amazed

9) laying down with the people you love and just talking. about stuff anything but just enjoying peoples company. 

10) Sarah Harvey, this probably isnt the place to tell everyone everything that makes me happy about her but I will tell you later sarah in private. lol (not that i am afraid to tell everyone I love you)

i tag: anyone who has a concinante in their name!!!

Sarah"

"event","So I finished harry potter I finished it this morning since I was to tired to do it last night at like three. which reminds me Brezzy woke me up at like 10 because after her calling every like twenty minutes for an hour I picked up the phone and was like hello and she was like is jonathan there and I was like he is asleep right now because I was to pissed/lazy to get up and get it for him. so she calls in like 10 minutes sounding like she was about to be in tears and was like is jonathan there I hate her so much so I had to get out of bed and all so jonathan could say that I should tell her that he would call back in a minute. ahhhhhhh and then when the phone rang like 5 minutes later I awnsered the phone with ""What!"" I didnt scream it but I did probably come off pretty pissed and it was daniels girlfreind so I was like I will get him. GOD DAMN THEM!!!! you shouldnt call someone that early in the morning you should wait at least till after ten or eleven. she calls every morning at like 9 so she can talk to jonathan on the phone for like two fucking seconds to say something like ""I am going to work now I love you"" and then she hangs up the phone....... anyway I will leave the rest of that for another time. harry potter was really good but I dont know how I feel about it I kinda saw the things coming and it didnt have as much I dont know umfph as the others. but it was still good. I will talk about it later once everyone has read it. thats all I really have to say."

"event","So!!!!! we got the electric bill which is usually like one hundred two hundred dollars tops right well this month somehow it went to like 720 which is ridiculusly high or thats what it said on the bill so we called and we were like that has to be wrong but it was apparently it is only like 860ish!!!! so my parents cant make that payment. so they woke me and jonathan up at ten oclock and said ""you two have to spend today looking for jobs!!!"" I dont know why he was pissed off but I walked down stairs and turned off the tv and he turned it off and yelled at me that i should be out getting a job. So I spent all day today applying to many different places sort of 26 but in all acuality I only filled out 21 applications. and I am going to go on monday to try to fill out like five more. I applied to a lot of hotels which would be awesome. and then a bunch of sort of nice to really nice restrants. I applied to jobs untill me and jonathan couldnt think of any more places to apply we have applied to ever hotel on I-35 and all the places that were in the target shopping center that were hiring and then all the places that were over by myrvins if you guys have any idea where else we should apply then you should tell me because I am all out of ideas. all my hard work all so I could give like 90% to my dad who is being a total asshole about the whole thing and yelled at me like everytime I got home today about why I dont have a job yet. but that would be awesome if I worked at a hotel because I could get in for really cheap. and then I could throw parties there lol. and maybe meet famous people when they come to stay in hotels over there. so that would be pretty sweet thats all the really happened today and now my feet, hands, legs, back, sholders, and head all hurt so I am going to stop typing."

"event","List 5 reasons why you are a dork. And make them good reasons. Justify them. Explain them. Be loud and proud about how big of a dork you are! Then pick the 5 biggest dorks you know and have them do the same.

1. I can solve the rubics cube in like a minute or two. I first learned this as a party trick and now I am such a dork that I cant not solve them lol. I know that that was a dubble negitive so sue me I felt that it was nessicery. I get this weird feeling when I see rubicks cubes that arnt solved and I have to solve them it is like a physical need at this point and not only that but I hate it when they are solved so i have to pick it back up and mix it up. it is an on going cycle and it is probably unhealthy

2. I havent told many people this but I cry at movies lol a lot. I am sam that movie makes me cry right off the bat as soon as he is handed his baby and he holds her for the first time. lol man gets me everytime pretty much any movie that has to do with kids gets me lol. I am pretty much a wuss lol.

3. I do have a little obsession with fight club and I dont have a problem admitting it I love that movie. and I am sure I am not alone because that movie is a masterpeice. and it will change your life if you let it lol.

4. I have read all the first harry potter books 16 times each. I know I know how could david be that dorky but now I am a dork. and not only that but I got up at 8 in the morning for the last book to wait in line to get a ticket to wait in line to get the book first at midnight. I didnt get first I was number 4 in line at midnight but I drew the line at dressing up for it lol. (only because I didnt have a costume) 

5. and now number five although I could go on to probably the high thirtys lol I am going to end it here with this the only thing I do all day really is play guitar. pretty much unless I have something spicific I have to be doing I am playing the guitar and I dont really get much better I play like the same songs over and over again. I keep saying i am going to find new bands but it is almost always like Relient k then something corperate, then relient k some more, then maybe some fall out boy then relient k some more. and as I am doing this I always imagine I am playing for an audience. and where as other teens let loose when there parents leave I turn the music up really loud and play the guitar and sing with it and jump around like I am on stage

So here's the people I would like to tag:
(and as a side note, I don't care if you do it or not)
1. Nick Edwards
2. India
3. hannah
4. meridith acree solutitorian what what
5. Rudy"

I am pretty sure all of those go against the mormon way but I guess what ever he wants. He is a really cool guy, he is in the national gaurd and he is a cook. his kid is really really cute and his name is nolen. the first night here we got on the subject of fireworks and we must have spent fifty dollars on fireworks alone almost going to the point where we would go give blood for money for it. and we have just been haning out and he has been telling us about all these cool storys that he has. I didnt expect him to be this cool seeing as he is mormon now so. Sarah came over yesterday and the day before that was three months and I love that girl she is everything I could have wanted, and I am so happy that I am with her right now. she is just really great and she makes me really happy. well thats it for now I will update later I guess lol"

Maybe my birthday.... that would be pretty sweet. and I got a call from state Representative Judy Heatly about working up at school for ten dollars and hour!!!! thats pretty sweet and they are going to pay us on the spot for our work which is really cool as well. so I am getting at least fifty dollars for that I am pretty sure I think it was like 6 hours the first day or something like that either way that pretty cool that I am getting some money.

I am always back by the same time I dont know why they dont realize that and the fact that I have given them the numbers of people I am with countless times I must have given them alexs number at least 8-9 times. and I have given them bradleys number if they really want to know where I am then they can call one of them and talk to me. besides they wont give me a cell phone unless I am paying for it I bet and they wont let me take drivers ed even though they have been saying for like 3 years now that ""they really need to do that"" and they keep saying ""I think we have the money lets get you in that"" but no they wont let me take it or something I dont know what there deal is this really pisses me off that they dont trust me I dont mind so much that I am grounded but that they dont trust me and that the first things out of there mouths when I got home were ""your lying"" gd."

"event","I havent been doing much lately, Umm Tuesday was mine and sarahs 2 months but I didnt get to see her that day so wednesday I tried really hard to see her but that didnt work out because my mom is a jerk so thursday I woke up at 9ish and rode the bus to her house to pick her up and then back to my house and we hung out all day that was awesome because I love her a lot. then yesterday I saw her again we went and saw madagascar it was cool lol but there was this guy sitting next to us and he was like talking to the screen lol it was really creepy they would ask a question like and he would awnser it for them and he would state the obvious ""oh look its the pinguans again cool"" people make me laugh he was all by himself and like 70 it was awesome now that brings us to today which has sucked. there are people fixing the showers at my house right now because it has gotten so bad that it is pushing on the door and making it really hard to close and also it is leaking water everywhere so 6 mexican guys show up at 8 with hammers to knock off all the tile and for those of you that dont know my room is right up next to the shower. so I woke up this morning to people beating on the wall with a hammer really hard. and yelling at each other in spanish about the stupidest shit ever. from what I have gathered they either really hated or really liked all the leathal weapon movies. and seeing as I didnt go to bed till like 2:30 ish that wasnt a pleasent way to wake up and also they covered the stairs in paper which pisses me off because it is really loud and awkward coming out of my room onto the paper and having all of them stare at me on my way down the stares because they have heard me moving. and they are supposed to be here for two days so that isnt very fun. oh well you only live once right well that is all that is going on in my life"

"event","man it has been a long time since I have been able to update this. the davys went well the goldstandard got all but one of the awards they were nominated for and I won 2. I ran lights for Mr. Cougar and that was ridiculus as usual I just finished running spot for spring show and I am so glad it is over eli really pisses me off. I broke the light board yesterday like 2 hours before the show and it took me like an hour to get it to work but I did and the show went fine no missed cues no mess ups that I know of. although eli is still a bitch and was cueing tapes for the show even after we told him not to because it was messing up prices mic. and I got to hang out with sarah today and that was awesome. thats all that has really happened. oh yeah and Rainmaker is opening on friday and I think we have a show saturday for the public so if you want to come then you should okay now that is all lol."

"event","man good times lol. I have been laughing a lot lately and I am in a really good mood all the time. I feel like nothing can get me down. it is wonderful I am on top of the world. yesterday we had math taks. so there was that it was really teidious because i had the calcuator so I just checked all of my awnsers like twice. then we had class and it was like the last periods of the day which are my favorite and on top of that I get to see sarah a lot more. then we had rehersals for nigels play then shcool was out and I was hanging with sarah and Alexander asked me to run one of the boards I dont know if I get payed for that but I might so that is cool. but today Krystal was freaking out because she couldnt do stage manager stuff because of the davys and the sponsor was freaking out. so I told her I would do it for her. lol so at the moment I am stage manager lights and sound and mrs. van vleet says I am completely in charge of everything so she wont be freaking out the whole time. I am pretty sure that were finding some one to stage manage for it. and I think blake is coming to run a board on friday of that week or at like 6 or so for the rehersal process. well thats all that I have to say about my life. and for all of you that are doing mr. cougar I am ashamed and I would have thought you would have known better. lol. sarah guess what!"

"event","well I asked out sarah and she said yes. I havent been this happy in a while well at least nothing that hasnt had her involved. before we decided to go out we had been talking for 4 or 5 months and I trust her more than anyone I have ever met. we have been through a lot in the short time that we have known each other but it has been the best 4 or 5 months I have ever had and I dont want it to end. and I am so happy that we can take the next step together. it is kinda hard to explain to someone that hasnt seen us talking. but I have never had someone like her in my life and I love it. that is all that has really changed in my life thus far but it is something great so I thought I would tell you ."

I get to express all my thoughts and think them through and that helps me work out whats going on but I always get people saying ""I know Ive heard this story"" and that really pisses me off because everytime I finially get a new story to tell you have all heard it already, that just sucks. I enjoy telling people stories more than I enjoy writing them so I dont think I am going to put anything funny in my lj anymore. it really isnt worth it. so this is what happened in my week without the funny parts.

"event","well today was okay I guess untill the end I had an audition for nigels play and from what I heard I like it I am pretty sure I will get a part since he has been saying ""I have a part for you"" and ""are you going to be in my play david"" for like a week but I dont know what it is I think he said something about a brother and he said he was leaning toward JZ for the older brother so I guess that leaves jim and thats cool with me he didnt really have me read for anything else so I guess thats what I am getting but you never know right. after that I went outside and waited for an hour for my parents to get there and then I got sick of waiting so I decided to walk home which mixed with my already hurt legs was really really painful and my legs still hurt and now they are trying to make it up to me so I think I might try to get some tickets to the a change of pace/ senses fail show which would be pretty sweet so I hope that works out wish me luck. I have been listening to more and more of sounds like life and there is this one song witch I can really relate to probably the song I can relate to most out of all there other songs and it is about not doubting yourself and they totally alluded to of mice and men in it, it made me really happy lol."

I guess I understand that we have to move but I hate packing sucks. oh well on monday we have to be completely out so I guess I wont have to deal with it for to much longer. I think I hurt my back moving this box down the stairs because it started to hurt it wasnt as bad as my legs have been hurting but I thought I would use it as an excuse to go home so I could talk to sarah but that didnt work and now they want me ""not to push myself to hard today"" so I guess that is a good thing thats really all that is going on in my life right now so leave me alone"

I have been listening to this new band sounds like life and they are blowing my mind. they are amazing and they have a song for everything I am feeling ever. lol. but that is only in the few times that I can make it over here so I can talk to sarah, which is one of the best parts of my day and I hate it when we dont get to talk. lol like today since she isnt on. oh well you only live once right. I am getting cable and internet in my new house tomorrow so I am pretty excited but I also have to do alot of moving. it really sucks being the biggest one in the family. oh well. Nigel is doing a play and he wants me to play a big butch flaming homosexual with aids. at least I am the pitcher and not the cather lol. that is all I have but I will leave you with some song lyrics. enjoy.

I grew so close to the people in that cast and I love you all and I dont care that we didnt advance at least we know that we did the best thing that we could possibly do and no one can take that from us. so to the cast of of mice and men I thank you from the bottom of my heart and I love everyone of you I wouldnt change a thing."

"event","well our film lost at the film thing which sucks. we lost to this film that was really really bad so that is kinda depressing. Oh well I guess there is always next year. the mother of a guy that we were talking to came up to us and was like you movie was the best I think and I think that you should have been the one that won yours was my favorite. and then her son was just looking at her and she was like you we definitely second. so that was good. but not good enough to win. me and bradley have already started working on another video but what is awesome is there is a band in this one and we were like we have to get someone famous so we decided on a change of pace right away and they emailed bradley back

Brad,

Im sure they can help you out.  It would be awesome if we could set a show up (possibly acoustic) on your campus the day of Senses Fail at like 3-4PM when everyone gets out...let me know if you can help me set that up and promote it on your campus.

Make sure you email Jorge their manager about the film project.

Best
Zach

so that is pretty awesome. I hope that works out"

We started with a tug of war between the cast I think and some of the techies. and before I go on I would like to say I have had 4 hours of sleep and it may not make sense. anyway I was winning pretty much all of them except for the time they had like 10 more people than we did but then someone decided that me and nick were the ""X Factor"" so of course we had to tug of war battle. I feel that I put up a pretty good fight. I almost had him for a little while there but then I lost it and lost. and then after I was suffenciently sore from that we had a whole day of set up and strike. that sucks I was so tired after that. then I came home and talked to Sarah online for like 5 hours and then went to bed

Saturday
we had that film contest thing where you get twenty four hours to make a video. I feel that we did pretty well. we got there at ten and then waited around while other teams tried to pull there scripts together and about one bradley showed up and we got to work. I think it is funny that we didnt have a script but we had a good idea for the film so we just started going there is no dialouge or sound except for a poem and a guitar going in the back ground. we had some pretty good shots bradley and I had the same vision going on this thing and we worked together really well I think. in on of our shots I come running down and I hit a gate and I am locked in and some people start laughing at me and keye came and set up right next to our camera  and just filmed along with us and our best shot in the movie was on the news for all to see. I am really happy that could be really good for my reseme when I go on later in life. so that is pretty sweet. we finished our movie at around 4 in the morning and we went and slept on bean bags in the library till like 7 where we found out joel was still going strong he ended up not finishing till like 9:30ish. I think the awards are going to come down to us and his group in the end because the other peoples kinda sucked from what I heard. I wish I could have done a few things differently but I can change those later and release it again but some of the shots came out so much better than I thought they would even be able to. As a whole I am emensley happy with the video that we put out. I dont think that contest could have gone better. it is like a dream coming true with that I created it... from me and Chris in the back of JZs car to 4 in the morning on sunday I was there through it all and I think this is the thing that I am most proud of out of all my things I have done in the past."

"event","so today pretty much sucked, the thing I was talking about in my last post was that I am moving I dont know where I am going to be moving because we havent found a house yet. we are being evicted the house has already been bought so we have to leave ""as soon as we can get packed"" and I missed a cue today in Of Mice and Men rehersals I was like 10 or 20 seconds late something like that. and as if I didnt feel bad enough nigel had to come up and this is how the conversation went.
""What the fuck were you doing""
""I dont know I am really sorry""
""you fucked up the whole time of the show today""
that was a little over board everyone has an off day I just hit mine today. then Knighton had to come up and say
""your now on my boys to stangle list""
""I am really sorry it wont happen again""
""we ran 13 minutes over today I hope you know that""
""okay that wasnt all me so dont look at me like that""
""no you lost us five six minutes you were really late and then you messed up and because of your mistake it brought down everyone elses preformance""
I didnt need to here that. I felt pretty bad as it is but I am not going to fell that bad for it everyone messes up and people flipping out on me is not going to make it any better what happens happens and I am getting sick and tired of peoples crap. me and Chris are or were going to be doing the music for of mice and men, nigel found out and he was like I want to do it let me and jason do it, and I was like I really want to do that, so he felt he had to say ""are you talented enough to do that david because I know I am"" it is finger picking for thirty fucking seconds I think I can handle it after three fucking years of playing the guitar. god damn I think I better stop talking about it because I am just getting more and more pissed off. and on top of all this I have a really bad headache right now. I think I am going to throw up it hurts really bad."

I have really just been hanging out a lot really. I did talk to kennedy about what we say behind his back that was an awkward conversation to have but because of it gold standard is back for at least three more shows. I am working on a suicide story that I am really excited about look for that some time. OH YEAH yesterday I found out that me and Chris get to play like all the transition music for Of Mice And Men so that is really really awesome. combining my two favorite things all in one show that is magical. I am really looking forward to that. oh and yesterday we decided to roll down the isle on this little wheeled piece of wood that we use to move the barrels and when it was Blake's turn to do it I was pushing him and we started going into the chairs a little so he jumped off and kicked the thing right back into my feet and I hit every chair for like 5 rows before I could stop myself. I am a little sore from that still but I am going to just roll with it. that is all that has really happened in my life so I am going to go bye"

I dont think it is possible that it could have gone worse she came up the stairs right as I was walking down the stairs and not only did she see my face Kendric told her that I was up there so she knows it was me. man what have I gotten myself into. this just sucks I am sitting here waiting for JZ to pick me up so we can go."

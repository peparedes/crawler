She's always falling down
And I think I just fell in love with her
But she won't ever remember, remember

And I can always find her
At the bottom of a plastic cup
Drowning in drunk sincerity
A sad and lonely girl

Quit crying your eyes out
Quit crying your eyes out, and baby come on
Isn't there something familiar about me?
The past is only the future with the lights on
Quit crying your eyes out, baby

And she said, ""I think we're running out of alcohol
Tonight I hate this fucking town
And all my best friends will be the death of me
But they won't ever remember, remember

So please take me far away
Before I melt into the ground
And all my words get used against me""
You sad and lonely girl

Quit crying your eyes out
Quit crying your eyes out, and baby come on
Isn't there something familiar about me?
The past is only the future with the lights on
Quit crying your eyes out, baby"

"event","hmmmm so it's summertime here in murder beach and life is going extremely well. lots of changes, but i view change as a good thing.
about a month ago jess and i broke up. nothing major, no bad blood just had to happen. very mutual. sucks working w/ her since she's already fucking someone else, but oh well.
i then flew out to CA to look at a film school, and decided i am going there in january, so i can save up some money.
my band is probably breaking up, since our singer quit and i am moving.
the place i am interning at offered me a job until i leave, after i get done w/ my internship. so i will probably be working there and miyabis until i leave. it will be good b/c it will help me to get some experience under my belt.
i've been having fun this summer, just going out w/ friends, getting drunk and having house parties etc. next week i get to see AFI again, and the next day i might be going to see stretch arm strong, secret lives, and burns out bright in charleston.
anyways gotta jump in the shower in a few. hope everyone is doing well.
Wes"

well anyways i am going to run. going to grab some sleep so i can go eat lunch w/ my great fucking girlfriend before we both go to work tomorrow.

also i'm in a new band w/ josh mcdowell we're both playing guitar, and possibly singing. eric from velvateen is playing bass and this guy named matthew is playing drums. we're still deciding on names, but i'm strongly pulling for the indoor kids. oh yeah josh mcdowell got married this past saturday, right now he's in cancun on his honeymoon. so yeah another one bites the dust. oh yeah anyone in s-burg who cares, jess and i will be there the 25th and 26th. and then jimmy eat world at the HOB the 28th and then i start school the 29th. taking design, computer graphics I, digital photography and then a internet math course. so yeah thats whats happening w/ me.

"event","so instead of whining on here like usual, i thought i would do something productive and write about different albums that changed my life.
todays choice:

AFI- The Art of Drowning

I still remember the first time i heard AFI, it was on an old nitro comp called ""go ahead punk make my day"" or something like that. i absolutely HATED their songs on it. fast forward a few years and i am randomly taping videos off of mtv2 and i see AFI on and decide to videotape it, b/c i wasn't sure i'd ever see another video of theirs again. to make a long story short i watched their video for ""days of the phoenix"" OVER AND OVER again. i finally went to best buy and bought the cd. at first i really didn't like it, it was when i was more into poppy-punk, and had very limited experience w. any kind of hardcore. finally it grew on me, and i can now say it is one of my all-time favorite albums, definately my fav AFI album. i think i just really related to the dark imagery and undertones combined w/ the aggression. it was the first time i had ever heard anything like that. it was like a serious version of the misfits, w/ more talent. i would definately reccommend ""Wester"" to anyone. prob my fav AFI song ever."

"event","so thursday i went back to s-burg. ended up going to monterreys w/ jennings and brandon, then hanging out and playing soccer. after that met up w/ angel and we went to delaneys, saw brandon kimbrell for the first time in years. saw a bunch of other people i hadn't seen in years such as brooke blackwell, scott, and charlotte. we all got a little drunk and had a good time. went home, went to sleep then woke up and went to eat kanpai w/ my mom...i don't like it nearly as much as i used to, i guess eating/working at miyabis has spoiled me....after that went to my grandparents etc went to see josh flowes dad at the hospital...it was sad. he might be dying...after that went to eat at the clock w/ my parents then went to see footloose at the junior high. it was pretty good, the lead got off key every now and then but he could dance like a mofo. so after that i went to josh flowes and then went to the marriott for the alumni thing...it sucked and just cost me $$$. after that i went to angels and slept. woke up at 7:30 the next morning, drove to columbia for jeremy's graduation. i saw rachel vykukal for the first time in like a year. it was good seeing her i guess...we all went to the village idiot for lunch, then hung out at jeremy's apt and draNK champagne then we went to the mall etc. after that i took an hour nap at the rest area on the way to charleston. got to charleston at 10, met some guy named dan who is 36 at the westerberg show. he had actually gotten to see the replacements in '89. so anyways westerberg came out rockin' great charisma. right in the 2nd song he jumpoed into the crowd. he played freakin' everything. lots of songs off of stereo/mono. almost every replacements song you would want to hear. in the middle of the encore he had to piss so he went into the ladies restroom, after he got back he told all ofthe guys how good it was, and how we shoulod always ""accidentally"" go into the ladies room. so after that i left (he played for like 2 1/2 hours) and got home around 3:15. worked all day yesterday got there at 11, and left at 11. i only made $140, but i'lltake it. so yeah time to jump in the shower before my speech exam."

"event","so yeah been an interesting weekend. friday i worked, didn't get out until like 12:30, but then i went to a party w/ ian. it was my friend jarrod's parents condo, and we were partying w/ his younger brother, jordan. also we drank w/ one of his friends who was a kid i used to go to church w/ when i was like 8 or so. he remembered me teaching him how to play chess. there was this one guy there named clint, who was fucking trashed out of his mind. we burnt the bottom of a beer can and kept wiping the char on his face, under the guise of a ""drinking game"". later on this guy said he was going home, and then proceeded to fall headfirst into the screen door. also he was throwing water from the sink into the freezer. so yeah were up until after 6, and we saw the sun come up. we put the patriotic gnome into the elevator, and then ian broke it, and threw it's bottom half down 4 stories or so.
last night i got called in, and got off around 12:30 again. we went back to jordans and drank a little bit. we met the most annoying gil ever. she talked like she was on AIM. she said things like ""J/K!"". so we took pics of ian picking his nose on her camera and a pic of him pretending to go down on a bottle in my pants. i ended up home around 5. so now i am going to start my research and go to work. i work monday and tuesday, school until 8:30pm wed, then i come home for the weekend."

"event","it was actually very good. minor holes in the plot etc, but still a very chilling movie. after that ian and i watched ""the hole"". i hadn't watched it since i bought it, it's a very creepy movie also. so last night was a good creepy movie night. earlier that day i had class all day etc.
tues i worked...i think i went back to sleep until 3 after class. after that i went by meghans and sara's. we watched eddie murphy ""Raw"" and the ren adn stimpy dvd's. monday i just hung out after class. meghan and i went to eat mexican and then went to wally world. later on that night matt came over to study and i made a ""metal"" cd for him and his GF. ok well i am gonna run.i tried to pull an all-nighter last night, which resulted in me sleeping from 5-9 and then going to the 9:30 class instead of my 8:00."

"event","ok so to please colie, i will post no more song lyrics this time and put a nice juicy update. today was pretty much school all day. clayton from o'charleys called me and said he was coming into town tonight, so i might take him to the surf shack. yesterday was just school and work. same thing monday. sunday i was an extra in a zombie movie, it was fun. kinda weird but fun. the guy and his girlfriend who were making it were like 30 and were like the goth kids you went to high school w/ but never quite grew up. at least i got to eat brains. after that ian came over and we went and ate sushi at miyabis. we then went to bi-lo got some popcorn and beer etc. we chilled and watched miranda(christina ricci) and scream. i can't believe scream was made like 9 years ago. oh yeah sara and i ate lunch monday at el cerro grande and hung out for a while. one night last week sara and meghan and i ended up drunk at the surf shack and took a few embarrassing pictures. ok well i think my teacher is about to start giving us our grades. gonna jet."

Just me and you, we're here alone 
And if you stay, all I'm asking for is 
A thousand bodies piled up 
I never thought would be enough 
To show you just what I've been thinking"

"event","so yeah my mom left to go home yesterday, and then i went to work. it sucked. and after that billy and i went to fridays. i then came home and watched an episode of the creek and went to bed. i had a dream last night that i threw a house party, except it was like a 3-story house, but it had my old bedroom in it(from my parents house). the music was way too loud and i tried to turn it down, but ed was being an asshole. then i ended up talking to brooke blackwell for a while. whom i haven't even see in years. then for some reason my mom caught me, and she was black and so was I!. fuck if i know."

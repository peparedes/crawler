17 February 2007 | 1602 Bounced 
18 February 2007 | 1698 Bounced 

99% of this was bounced notices, where botnets had imitated my email and used it to spam.&nbsp; Because my email was my domain's default address, I received all notices, even when the addresses were completely made up (ejwejrh@hisdivineshadow.net for instance).&nbsp; Examining my cPanel, it looks like the notices are still coming.&nbsp; I don't know why.&nbsp; I had to switch my default address to stem the tide."

A small basketfull to be precise.  Wandering imageboards led me to the site of a Japanese artist and the source of a number of images I didn't know the source of earlier, plus the aformentioned new Sakuya.  'Tis nearly all filthy in nature, but I don't care so much.  Any Saku is good Saku. XD

Little swag did HDS grab, aside from one delightful Kyo Kara Maoh poster, a few figurines, and some things I must remember to torture Nessles with until her birthday come.  Movies and such galore there.  Saw <i>Howl's Moving Castle</i> again, as excellent as it was before.  Saw <i>Ghost Stories</i> as well, and now I see what Newtype meant when they mentioned its funny dubbing. XD  Saw <i>Lupin III: The Colombus File</i> as well.  Classic goodness (Albeit classic but made in 1999).  Saw a live action Korean horror thing as well, <i>R-Point</i>.  Aside from <i>Howl's</i>, it was the best thing I saw there.  Crazy hotel, though.  The Dealer Room was in the underground parking garage. XD

But now I am home and all fleeting glee has past, replaced by aggravation at new and unpleasant developments.  A pox upon myself, so that I may die tomorrow."

Anybody besides me find it hilarious that good 'ole Osama was supposedly offering a truce in a recent tape?  This, to me, is along the lines of President Bush flying to Cuba and givine 'ole Castro a big, sloppy kiss.  Come to think of it, that might not be a bad idea.  Castro'd probably have several acute MI's and expire shortly thereafter.  He'd be dead, and you couldn't accuse Dubya of assassinating him with a mere kiss.  Anybody besides me amused?  I thought not.

And my glasses decided to do their semi-monthly breakup.  Once again the right ear-thingy broke.  Unlike several other times, it did not detach cleanly this time but rather snapped right off.  It has done this before, but only once.  Next time: HDS' glasses burst into flames and consume him, causing him to be reborn as Brigit, Celtic Goddess of Fire.  

Hee!  I spell-checked this and it said ""Osama"" was not a word. XD  It isn't, but you'd think he'd be in most spell-check databases by now, no?"

"event","Always mostly fun to visit the CT family during Holidays but now, as always, 'tis time to return home.  Much good came of this particular holiday, mostly in the form of DVDs and reading material, but with one special item from someone as well.  

So much remains to be done.  Registration for Anime Mid Atlantic needs to be done immediately lest I risk a five-dollar (USD) increase in the prereg cost.  Hotel roomage as well must be procured.  A new counter skin for Okcounter needs to be made, a shrine I've been condiering for some time needs to be started, my tens of thousands of unsorted images need to be sorted...essentially, the usual horid mess.  Maybe my flight today will encounter turbulence significant enough to rattle my brain into motion.  

But for now, only two obstacles remain...food and the Year's Best SF 7.  They must be run down with haste!

And here's a thing:

Explanatory text that wasn't in the result: Espresso!
You will always stand up for your views and you're not afraid to say what you mean. Great! But watch out it doesn't lose you friends. You like spending time on your own, and can be a bit of a loner. That's O.K too, but remember there are lots of great people out there - you don't always have to tackle life on your own! Espresso is bitter, strong and powerful - quite like you! You aren't easily intimidated (not that many try!) You are self-reliant, know your own mind and pack quite a punch when you need to, but mostly stay out of trouble. You'd make a loyal and trustworthy friend, one that is alawys there even in time of trouble. Good for you!"

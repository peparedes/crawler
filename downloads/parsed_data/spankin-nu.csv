i hate being  19 turning 20... its such a sucky age to be at. You are too old for the things you are used to but too young to experience anything else. you are stuck in school when u just want to have a career already...but its ok because i know everything has its own way of working itself out. Im just trying to think that in 10 years it will all be worth it! :) And the stuff that happens that i think is the end of the world wont mean anything when im 30. anyway im gonna go try to persuade michelle into letting me play donkey kong. shes on a roll....lol

They only want to BELIEVE that you will be honest with them but when it comes down to it, everyone is affraid of confrontation and ppl knowing the way things really are. I am an honest person. I say how i feel and what i think, WHEN i feel it and WHEN i think it. This is my warning to all the assholes who are immature and cant handle the truth. But whatever.

oh my gosh! At first i thought it was because of my tounge. everyone was like ""its all connectec and bla bla bla""...well now i am full blown SICK. and if its becasuse of my tounge ring than FUCK THIS SHIT!! I didnt realize how swollen my tounge was when i took the pic in my last entry....but thats nasty. lol. 

there is so much CRAP going on. alot. just alot of crap. its crappy. like...i have had the greatest wake up call EVER!! and i am for ONCE, NOT being sarcastic. i am being genuine........ I have the worlds greatest friends. I dont really know how to word myself correctly in saying that these ppl who are my true friends were completely unexpected. I didnt realize how much these ppl cared. But in the past few days they have shown how much they care. And the person who was there the entire day listening to me and trying to help is the person who i never thot would speak to me again. and what is really really ironic...is the fact that the only person who i THOUGHT cared....didnt...and all of the ppl who i thot DIDNT care...did. i spent the past 3 days being so depressed...the brightest part of my past few days has been jaci and chris bringing me a huge spongebob pillow and getting me a card. cuz they knew i was sad and wanted to see me happy. OH and of course diana sleeping at my house. she fuckin rocks. But the point IS.....the one person who i expected to be there for me was too wraped up in themselves to know what was going on. what is STILL going on. but i realized it doesnt matter.....they will come around eventually. i have awesome friends that love me and care about me and who want to see me happy. i love it. 

So.........went to see jaci's ""boyfriend""? yea...me and cheryl sat around for like 2 hours and did nothing while all of these ppl walked in and out of the house. we were in crime hills...i felt like i was gonna get shot. out of the 15 ppl that were in the house, me and cheryl were the only white girls....sitting on a couch in the corner....waiting for jaci to finish talkin to her bf upstairs. fun....not. o well hopefully jaci will have stuff figured out now. 

im gonna go. i thot this entry was going to be so depressing but it turned out to be the opposite of my mood.

oh i went to discovery cove yesterday with cheryl and i poked a fish. and i almost had a head on collision with a sting ray that was as big as a car. yea that was fuckin hilarious. but it was cool. we snorkled with fishies and it was fun. it was like..i had the worst week ever but the best end to it. except for that drama last nite. whatever. 

anyWAY...i am going.

""The Flying Song""

Its easier to love somebody
its easier than to be loved
you say you wanna be somebody
why dont you be yourself
If you wait for an answer
from somewhere up above
you may never hear the laughter
you've been dreamin of

Now we're flyin so high
with the world down below
spread your wings accross the sky

Its easier to love somebody
its easier than to be loved
You say you wanna trust somebody
why dont you trust yourself
if a weight
rolls down from heaven
the turning of the tide
your'e pulled in all directions
only for a while

then we're flying so high
with the world down below
spread your wings accross the sky

i felt like shit this morning. i was supposed to go to the beach with tommy and autumn and a few other ppl but i felt HORRIBLE...so i juss went to my pool with jaci (its pronnounced jackie u fools) and her gay friend mchael. then gerald came then mike from work came and it was fucking hilarious. mike was michelles son but i adopted him because she went off to college lol. its great. so anyway we had alot of fun...and mike is like a brother to me. seriously. like...timmy and him are so much alike but timmy is taller. but mike is 17. he is like my lil brother! But nicer. timmy is the brother who kicks my ass and punches hard and mike is the brother who juss likes to prank me and annoy me. lol. ANYWAY...so we wresteled in the pool and had a grand old time. we did cannon balls and michael has this genious move that we call ""the jesus"" because he does like a belly flop kind of thing with his arms out but the way he does it makes him look like jesus going into the water. lol....its great. there was making out and nudity and i had so much fun. i think that today i had the most fun SOBER that i have had in a long ass time. anyway...besides the fact that gerald was there it was fun. im getting my tounge pierced. 

tell me how my mom says she would rather i pierce my tounge than my nose....i thot it would be the other way around! lol.

MY HAIR TURNED BLONDE BECAUSE OF THE SUN!!! MY NATURAL COLOR IS COMING BACK! SON OF A BITCH! 

You kno what i love about the ppl at work? (meaning jaci and cheryl), is that they are so open minded. i get along with them so well. like...with my other friends there is a limit of what i can do in front of them or talk about in front of them...but with these 2 its like anything goes. they never judge me because they (mostly jaci) are the same way i am about so many things. and its great. the day i trained jaci i knew we were gonna get along. we just clicked. she flippin rocks. i heart you jaci!!! u too cheryl!!!

anyhow i think michelle is supposed 2 come to my house before she goes to the club....im so tired and burnt or else i would go cuz i never been to taboo. fuck.

hmmm... so i was thinking... i am tired as hell. 

I finaly am doing really good with the whole situation with the asshole... havent called or anything....havent written a journal entry in so long about how i miss him or am sad. he is a dick and i am fianly realizing it. thank christ. 

i think its funny that when you are a certain age, 16 for example, that you think things mean the world. and you think that this one guy is everyting...and 5 years later (2 if youre a pot head) you cant remember his name or what he looks like. So lately i have been trying to look at things from the ""in 10 years it wont matter"" point of view, and i must say that it is working quite well. cuz in 10 years, ill be rich and will have a husband...and this petty bullshit with the asshole wont matter. I probly will forget his name by then....or atleast his birthday... lol

why is it so hard for girls to let go, and guys have that ""oh well shit happens on to the next"" mentality? 

i am so happy that michelle is back...i am sooooooo extatic!!! :) I have my michelle back and things wont be like last summer....but it will rock. Last summer was the best summer of my life. and i think she would say the same.

Talked to javi the other day. i was crying because i miss him so bad. i have never missed anyone that much before in my entire life. like with michelle...i saw her like almost every weekend at first...and then once a month. but i havent seen javi since january. i havent hugged him for 6 months. :(...i am so glad i didnt go to the airport to drop him off...because i would hve lost it. i wouldnt have been able to let him go. Javi leaving was a shock too. he said that he wanted to move on a monday and moved that following saterday. its not fair...he is amaxing and i am so happy for him, cuz he is makin 6 figures a year now...but it hurts so bad. its like something is pullin on my insides when i think about him not being 6 feet away anymore. damn it sucks. 

read the harry potter book 6...flippin amazing! but it is so sad and there is no one left for that woman to kill off. seriously.

this ass at work swears i like him so he tries to flirt with me and its so gross...but anyway... i think its funny that most, if not all of the guys in my life wont hang out with me and just HANG OUT. they want to have sex. and that fucking pisses me off. go get it from somewhere else. maybe if it was one or two or even just three ppl....but its more than that...and it is freakin PSYCHOTIC that i do not have ONE guy FRIEND...they all want something that i dont want to give. fuckers. 

anyway michelle is coming home. THANK GOD!!!!!! now ill have a little bit of sanity...hopefully
michelle is bitching to me about chicken grill.....rock on!!!!!!!

ok anyway i was really mad but now i am ok. i need to talk to certain ppl about stuff because i am really getting aggravated....and i am getting so aggravated that i just dont want to talk to them anymore...but they are so self centered that they would be like ""well i am going thru shit right now so fuck you i dont need you"" ...but its like...IM GOIN THRU STUFF TOO!! lol...these ppl are thick headed and i kno if i spoke up they would not see my side....they would think of it as me not being there for them, and thats not true. because if nothing else, i am here for my friends. and everyone knows that. i just re-read what i wrote in this paragraph and i just cant get what i am trying to say out into words. these ppl are just so self centered, and i cantsit there and have everything be all about them anymore...because when it comes time to give advice i find myself forcing it...like....it has becom a chore and i am beginning to resent these ppl...and its only because they are so SELF CENTERED and shit.....i dont know...lol maybe this is pointless??

"event","im such an ass....lol...me and timmy decided to play with what little fireworks we had left in the back yard and throw them in front of cars(my back yard has a street behind it for those of you who have never been to my house)....well its almost 1 so theres not many cars out. so he was like lets wait til tomorrow and for more cars so im like timmy let me do one more...so he goes ""ok juss throw it in the street and not into the grass or it will go on fire, u saw what happened last night""...so me...being the fuckin idiot that i am, light the thing, and throw it cuz i got startled, and it lands in the grass over the hill thing (the berm)....and just like wise little timmy said, the grass caught on fire. So instead of ME, the older sibbling and the one who actually threw the fuckin thing, jumping over the bushes and stomping on the fire, i go ""timmy?"" in a really whiney voice and he jumps over the bushes and stomps out my mess. it was beautiful. B-E-A-UTIFUL!

i want more cars to be driving tomorrow night because we have these cool little laser crackly things that will fuck ppl up. lol

anyway....something really bad happened sunday night...my publix got robbed, and one of my good friends got held up at gunpoint. the lady who trained me, and 2 of my other friends that i ahve known since i started there, AND i knew them from school, they were there too. im so sad because my store is not like any other store i have been in. its like a family and we all hang out and call each other. its weird...but because because we are such a small store, we are all really close. and when i heard that happened...i started freakin out. its scary because my manager begged me to close last night too...im juss glad i wasnt there. i was so shaken up...my FRIENDS...MY publix...how did this happen?? I live in such a litle area, u all kno that. i ahve lived here all my life...and this just hits too close to home. Publix is basically in my back yard... its juss so sad because my poor friends... i dont know. everyone is ok but the fuckers got $10,000...assholes. 

anyway...im bored as fuck. maybe ill make my bro play CZ so i can be entertained. i was supposed to go to a party....that didnt happen. assholes. 

i dont need you! BITCHES!

With michelle and me buggin out and smokin like always...then friday i helped diane move but i felt so sick afterwards and had a sore throat so all i did was have cheryl over and we watched limeny snickets (the first 1/2) and mike came over later that nite too, to stop by and c my hair i guess. anyway then cheryl and mike left and michelle came and we did what  we do best again...then i went to sleep until 2 on saterday even tho i was supposed to help diane again.....then diana comes to my house and we were supposed to hang out with luana but there was so much traffic that we couldnt get ANYWHERE near her side of town. i juss went from my house to sandlake hospital and back and that took almost an hour and a half. it was bad. (it should only take 20 mins, round trip)..

ANYWAY...me and diana decide it will be fun to go with melanie, ceasar, tommy (ceasars friend) and chrisst to go off-roading and mudding and make a bonfire and shit. so we go and it was fun as hell...ceasar ended up on top of the roof of the truck/suv that we were in, and me and diana ended up in the back....it was great but we got so freakin dirrty. lol. I was named Chaves...yes...because we met these hotttttt country boys named JT and FOREST and we gave fake names and they quickly named me chaves/alex...or something. lol. we ended up not coming back to my house until like 5AM and took showers and went to sleep at like 6ish? lol it was great. i want to go mudding again. very badly. OH and as if it wasnt enuff that we all had whiplash from backin up into trees and shit, when we were leaving we passed this long fence around some sort of air field and diana and ceasar decide to say ""TOMMY WHO'S STRONGER YOUR CAR OR THAT FENCE??!? YOUR CAR OR THE FENCE TOMMY?!?!"" and he would be like ""ME!! FUCK THAT FENCE!!"" And proceed to RUN INTO THE FENCE a total of like 789 times. ok it was like 8 but oh my lord...lol...and tommy is kind of...dumb? genuinely not all there so it makes things 50 times more entertaining. but he is really nice and a good kid.

im excited about the fourth of july because me and my brother love to burn shit up...and blow shit up...so its going to be great. i think i might just buy me and timmy like $50 worth of firecracckers and shit to blow up and we will be happy....sound good timmy??

Alan Jackson
A Little Bluer Than That

Well tonight if you turn your radio on
You might hear a sad, sad song
About someone who lost everything they had
It may sound like me
But I'm a little bluer than that

When you look out in the morning you might see
Clouds rollin' by like memories
And a big old sky above you lookin' back
You may think of me
But I'm a little bluer than that

Where did we go wrong
I wish I knew
It haunts me all the time
Now wherever I go and
Whatever I do
You're always on my mind

I can picture you in his arms tonight
But as for me it don't feel right
To let us fade like some old photograph
It may work for you
But I'm a little bluer than that

Where did we go wrong
I wish I knew
It haunts me all the time
Now wherever I go and
Whatever I do
You're always on my mind

So tonight if you turn your radio on
You might hear a sad, sad song
About someone who lost everything they had
It may sound like me
But I'm a little bluer than that

"event","my head hurts so bad... i need to get rid of this b4 jeanette's tonight... argh...

guys are gay...

omg... lol this guy i work with, matt, told everyone i like him. he is short and ugly and gross and he is tellin all the stock crew ppl that i like him... he asked me if i liked chris f and i said no. i told chris and he was like ""u should have said yes lol that way he wouldnt have said u like HIM...and then u juss could have told me and would have all been good"" and i was like yea i probly should have. chris doesnt like him either which makes it easy for me to bitch about matt to him lol. 

whats his face stopped by last night...told his mom he was at dennys instead of my house...thats riddiculous... when im out im like ""yea ma im at so and so's house and i wont be home til late or ill sleep at michelles or cheryls tonight"" and my mom is like ""okay be careful""... but thats about it. but he cant even tell his mom he is at my house...either she really hates me or it wasnt his mom. lol. whatever. i dont care. i was in another world so it really didnt matter. 

you know what bothers me and is a real turn off? When guys hit girls even playing around. maybe its because i was in one of those relationships YEARS ago and i juss dont like it. i think it is immature and juss plain rude. i am not a guy, do not hit me like i am. The only guy who hits me and gets away with it is timmy. no one else. and i HATE being hit in the face...or tapped in the face... ANYTHING in the face is bad! I hate it. timmy doesnt even do that shit to me. you kno who else was like that? My friend Mark...he hated that. lol. i think he is in Kansas now...talked to him like a month ago. (he's with the army) and i was like have any tornados came for you yet? lol. 

chris that moved back to ny asked how i was...i guess my mom called him and the first thing he asked her was ""hows missY?""....i told him he would miss me. bitch. lol. 

ok i think im gonna go... my head is punding like a biotch.

"event","i just wrote a whole entry on how ppl piss me off because no one is ever here for me and then i realized....it just doesnt matter anymore. It really doesnt. :) 

In that entry, i said that i am always here for everyone and i listen to them for hours even if what they are upset about is stupid...and then this week when i needed someone the most... no one was around...and then i realized... it just doesnt matter anymore. :)

I also said that this weekend was supposed to be a really good weekend...that michelle and me were supposed to go to IOA or hang out on sunday...and i had  plans last night and tonight and got ditched... but it really doesnt matter anymore :)

also....i said that these bitches only want to be my friend when it is convenient for them...and thats unfair...but it really doesnt matter anymore. :)

no, im not stoned, im not drunk...im thinking clearly for the first time in forever...and nothing matters anymore. it really isnt worth being so upset... i refuse to care about ppl that dont care about me. :)

also...dammit my mom walked in and ruined my train of thought...fuck it.

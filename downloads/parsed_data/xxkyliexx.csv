"event","Today, I hung out with Kelly for the 1st time in a while. It was fun! We went to the Chinese Buffet in Frankenmuth. We got ripped off hard core. It was 22 dollars for us and we didn't even eat that much. Kelly and I agreed that buffets are for fat people with big appetites. After, we went to good ol' Rite Aid and bought some medicine. Then we played Room Raiders at E's house. Overall, it was a really good day. For souvenirs, we have some strawberry HiC to drink. After I got home, I played Mario Brothers and i did super good. I was so proud of myself I made it to level 8-1 without dying! I think I could turn pro! Wow.... I have to go pee so I will write in here later."

"event","Well today was just like anyother day. The only difference is today is Megan's b-day!!! Today, I cleaned my room. I finally realized what a pack rat I truely am. It's pretty pathetic. You guys wouldn't believe the junk I through out. I'm super excited for tomorrow. Kelly and I are planning to go to the chinese buffet in Frankenmuth! I love chinese food. I don't understand why chinese people are so skinny. Maybe it's beacause rice is good for you. I found out we are getting 2 golf memberships again this year. I was really sad because I don't really want to see Randy. It's not like he is going to get a different job or anything. It will be so awkward seeing his whole family all summer again. Well I'm gunna get to steppin. I'll try to keep ya'll updated."

"event","This weekend was pretty good. Thursday, I travelled all the way to Frankenmuth! I ended up hanging out with Eric. Friday, I went shopping but whats new? Saturday the weather was terrible. Can you believe I actually drove in that?!?!? I rented Barborshop and Welcome to Mooseport.. They weren't worth risking my life to go rent. I found out Iam going to Flordia for sure!!! I'm so excited I get to see a real palm tree. I'm looking forward to getting my picture taken with Minnie Mouse and Tinkerbell also. The only sad part is I have to fly all by myself to Chicago. My dad said it should only be like a 20 minute flight though. He is all worried its so funny. Well I just got done watching the Football games. Now im ready for bed. And Landon if your reading this, I am said that you didnt call me like you said you would today. try to keep ya'll updated."

"event","Last night was the worst night of my life. Lets just say it involved the snowcoming dance,Mrs. Murphy, and the police. At the dance it was okay for a little while, until we got in trouble. All i have to say is that i hope Anna is not going back to France. I would feel terrible. The only good part of the night was before i went home i stopped at Jess's grandmas garage. Tyler, Landon, Frank, and Rick were there. I said hello and chilled for a bit. Then, I headed home to my wonderful house. By myself, when Anna was supposed to be with me. I'm NEVER going to drink. My life is prolly wrecked now. Also, i would like to add that I fell last night really bad and i think i broke my foot. It is turning purple and my knee is all bruised. I'll have to keep you all updated. Hopefully im NOT going on a 10 day vacation."

"event","I had a pretty good day today. I found out i have an A- in Algebra2. Then to make my day even better, someone got into Mr. Howlett's grade book and erased the grades! I was very excited because I fail all of his tests. Now I have an A in his class. Becky was supposed to come over today and watch my buddy Napoleon with me. Sadly, her dad wouldn't let her go anywhere. Stacy took me home today it was quite fun. Too bad its so damn cold outside. Snowcoming is this week. We play Bridgeport Friday so we better win! lol :-) I'm really tired lately and i dont know why. I'm just talkin to Tyler, Landon, and Christina right now.. So I'll stop boring you for a little bit."

"event","Well, I've decided that it is about time for me to start my own little journal. I read everyone else's so I figure what the hell? What's with all these New Years resolutions? Everybody has them but nobody seems to keep them. For example: I've decided diet to lose a few pounds but will I? Hell no! Today, I sadly went back to school. After my nail appointment I will be sitting all alone :-( I bought Napoleon Dynamite today. Some people think it's stupid, but people like me and my dry sence of humor think it's funny. It's parts like "" It took me 3 hours to finish the shading on your upper lip"" and "" whatever I feel like God! "" that make this movie so hilarious. I'm starting to feel a little better today. I was sick on new years day and a lil bit on Sunday. I really don't know why? I'm going to get going now. Hopefully I can keep you updated."

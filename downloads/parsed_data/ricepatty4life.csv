when we got there i told her to wait outside, pick wild flowers.
i went upstairs and stripped all of my clothes off.
i knew if i did not i would get her blood on them.
when all was ready i went to the window and called her.
then i hid in the closet until she was in the room.
she saw me all naked and began to cry and tried to run downstairs.
i grabbed her and she said she would tell her mama.
first i stripped her naked.
how she did kick bite and scratch.
i choked her to death.
then i cut her into small peices so i could take my meat to my room, cook
and eat it.

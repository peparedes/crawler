"event","Well basically what ive been doin lately is getting into what HOPEFULLY ill end up doing sooner in later in life, which is digital media design. Ive already been looking up courses, and in school they taught me about stuff like that and ive been getting really into it. So basically ive been mixin it up with skateboarding and bringing them both together.  And Chris, a long time ago we had this idea. it never really happend though cuz we were to busy to put it up. So i put my thoughts to work..and with the help of some of my other friends this should be very interesting a fun.

*Note* This isnt a SERIOUS SERIOUS thing, just something localy around here, and give people a chance to see something new. But we'll see in the future what develops out of it."

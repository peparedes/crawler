I got off work two hours ago and I have to go back in six...I really hate working weekends. I got my new phone and it's really cool. A lot better than I imagined after reading some not so great opinions on it, but I guess that happens with any product. Julia went pretty psycho-bitch on me the other day, and I seriously think after two years or so that we are not going to talk again. The reason I think that we won't start talking again is because for the first time I actually don't care that we're not talking. I don't even know if that made sense...Anyway, it's a good thing she picked spring break to go nutty because now I can concentrate on some other girls and not even have to see her for a whole week. So any girls that are interested in the cack please feel free to let me know haha. Damn I wish it was summer already. I am so fucking sick of Chapelgate it's not even funny. Okay time to go to bed."

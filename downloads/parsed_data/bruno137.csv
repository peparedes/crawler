"event","Well its Tuesday and time for me to head back home to Kalamazoo.  Its a much needed escape from Mt. Pleasant and some of the weights on my mind.  I cant wait to see my parents and my puppies too :)  Hopefully there will be some friends in town, but if not I guess I will just do laundry, read a couple books (which is a goal of my spring break), grade papers, and enjoy not doing anything.  Its strange to think that in exactly a month I will be done with college.  
The reality is starting to hit me, and Im not sure how to take it.  For the past 18 years I have been a student and as a teacher will always be a student...but it will be different.  Real world here I come...are you ready for me??? or am I ready for you???  I guess we'll see.  
In other news...the past week has been great.  Ive spent alot of time with an old friend and found that every day becomes more and more enjoyable.  Yesterday the weather was amazing for Mt. P, so we had lunch, went for a walk, got some ColdStone ice cream, and then watched a movie.  It was a ton of fun, very relaxing, and the smile never left my face.  Im gonna miss alot of friends while Im gone on my mini spring break, but I know I'll miss Abby most of all.  Well its time I end this entry and pack up the car.  Hopefully I'll have good stories when I get back from break."

"event","So I decided to join the LiveJournal community.  I know quite a few people who have LiveJournals and it seems like an easy way to get stuff out there...both good and bad.  Who knows if I'll be able to keep up with this since I am student teaching and all, but I'm sure I will have some fun with this.  Anyway, just wanted to get started, back to grading papers--what a great way to spend my spring break!"

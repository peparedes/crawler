Mal: Darn. (Kicks Crow through running engines. Next bad guy is brought forward.) Now, this is all the money Niska gave us-
Bad Guy: I get it! I'm good. Best for everyone. I speak for everyone. I'm right there with ya.

Simon: I'm trying to put this as delicately as I can... How do I know you won't kill me in my sleep?
Mal: You don't know me, son. So let me explain this to you once: If I ever kill you, you'll be awake, you'll be facing me, and you'll be armed.
Simon: Are you always this sentimental?
Mal: Had a good day.
Simon: You had the Alliance on you, criminals and savages... half the people on the ship have been shot or wounded including yourself, and you're harboring known fugitives.
Mal: We're still flying.
Simon: That's not much.
Mal: It's enough.

I'm thinking about completely redoing my layout. I love my Spander, but I think it's time for a change. I think I'm going to do a Firefly/Serenity layout and mood theme. I can't decide if I want to do a layout that's of the entire cast or if I want to focus mainly on River and Simon. I love the entire cast, but I also really love the dynamic with the Tams. I was also thinking of changing the layout itself from Opal to something else. Perhaps Haven, Nebula, The Boxer, or Variable Flow. I'm not sure about those, though. I just want something that fits with whatever header I come up with and doesn't require an HTML expert (which I am not).

Any suggestions?

After careful consideration of your academic performance and your
letter, we determined that your circumstances were not sufficiently

was our decision to deny your appeal.

As you know from your previous letter of dismissal, you will not be
eligible to re-enroll at Ball State University for a minimum of two
semesters (until Fall 2006).  Re-enrollment at Ball State is not
automatic.  Should you wish to be reconsidered you must complete an
application for reinstatement, which will be reviewed by a committee of
faculty and staff.

I would encourage you to explore alternative educational opportunities.
Please let me know if I can be of assistance in this regard.

Still no reply to my appeal letter. Classes start tomorrow morning. Hmmmm...

You are a lot like ballet but you are more fluid. You move to the beat INSIDE of you. Whatever the music moves you to do, your body does. You are in touch with yourself and very moved by many things in your life.

"event","Found through <lj user=""amejisuto"">. The Fandom Creed, by <lj user=""grayout"">

<lj-cut Text=""The Fan/Fandom Creed"">
The Fan/Fandom Creed.

	I. <b>I acknowledge that fandom can, has, and will exist without me.</b> I am not important. What I can do, someone else could easily take over. Even if the fandom is tiny, there are probably many more fans of whom I simply have not heard that write/draw/dream things that could blow my mind. Fandom would not fall apart without me.

	II. <b>I acknowledge that no matter what I've contributed to it, the fandom owes me absolutely nothing.</b> I will not look for fame, nor will I expect a certain type of treatment from anyone else in the fandom. If people respect me, let them; if people dislike me, let them. I certainly will not threaten to leave and expect anyone to care.

	III. <b>I acknowledge that no matter what sort of ""credentials"" I have in the real world, in fandom, I am merely just another ""fan.""</b> I might be a published author, a famous artist, or hell, Brad Pitt, but in fandom, if I am not the creator of the canon material, I am merely a follower and I will remember that.

	IV. <b>I acknowledge that fandom is a thing created and kept alive by more than one person.</b> People will disagree with me; I will disagree with people. Although I reserve the right to leave the premises or disagree/rant/make snide comments in relative private, I will never flame someone publically or personally for their opinions. If there is discussion in public, it will be civil and I will keep the peace.

	V. <B>I acknowledge that there will always be parts of fandom that I dislike; I also acknowledge that there will always be parts of fandom that dislike me; these parts, I will ignore.</b> There will always be people who will never see things my way, no matter what anyone says or does, and there will always be people who keep producing works with which I completely disagree. Again, although I reserve the right to leave the premises or disagree/rant/make snide comments in relative private, I will make no move to actually stop them. They have the right to imagine their versions of characters, just as I have the right to imagine mine.

	VI.<b> I acknowledge that, just as fandom owes me nothing, neither do other fans.</b> It doesn't matter who I am; just because I created a community or many people agree with my portrayal of Character A does not give me rights to anything in the fandom. If I receive praise, I will always remember that it is given freely, not due; if I receive criticism, I will take it and remember that criticism, too, is freely given. Regardless of which it is, I will always feel thankful for the time.

	VII. <b>I acknowledge that fandom is fandom and how certain people act/how certain people's tastes run in fandom has no relation to them in real life.</b> Although I reserve the right to like or dislike someone based on their OOC/non-fandom-related comments, I will neither judge nor form opinions about someone as a person purely through fandom. Just as slash writers are not always gay and RPers are not always self-inserts, I acknowledge that the fandom-image I know and the real life-person that I do not may be completely different people.

	VIII. <b>I acknowledge that there will be other fans that I dislike personally; I also acknowledge that there will be other fans that dislike me personally; these fans, I will ignore.</b> Again, although I reserve the right to leave the premises or  disagree/rant/make snide comments in relative private, I will make no move to actually confront them if they have done no wrong. Being a jerk may have them kicked out of communities and forums, but I will always remember that they have as much right to be in the actual <i>fandom</i> as I do. And I will always remember that I do have that right.

	IX. <b>I acknowledge that just as I am in fandom to have fun, other people are in fandom for the exact same reason, and I will remember that.</b> I will never do anything to actively try to stop other people's fun, regardless of how much I may disagree with what they are doing. Clause reserving the right to leave the premises or disagree/rant/make snide comments in relative private still holds here, but I will never tell another fan to stop having fun in whatever way they want to have fun. And I will never pay any attention when someone tells me to stop having fun myself. 

	X. <b>I acknowledge that just as everyone else is a person, that I am a person, too.</b> No matter what other fans may think of me from what they have seen in fandom, I will never let that persona/image/reputation get in the way of being myself if/when I should communicate with them outside of fandom. If they respect me, I will thank them, and if they dislike me, I will accept it, but these things I will strictly keep in fandom only and will not allow them to interfere with my friendships or real life.

XI. <b>I acknowledge that there are people uninterested in my fandom and I will not press my fandom upon them.</b> I will not speak of certain fandoms to those that have no interest in them, nor will I pressure anyone to look at/read/otherwise be forced to come up with reactions to things that they couldn't care less about. I know that fandoms are very specific things, that being pressured into looking at them is highly uncomfortable, and I will not impose that way upon others.

	XII. <b>I acknowledge that, in the end, real life is real life and fandom is only fandom.</b> If fandom begins to affects my real life in negative ways, I will remember that I have the option to simply leave and if it gets bad enough, I will. If I am truly unhappy with a certain fandom or the way a certain fandom is going, I will remember that I have the option of simply creating another community for people who share the same interests as me, or the option of just staying and refusing to go with the flow. I will remember that fandom is a simple trade of time with fun, and that if the fun is not worth the cost, I will remember that I am merely wasting time. Above all else, I will remember that remaining in fandom is an entirely voluntary action.

"event","Guh. I had to scroll through 272 entries on my flist to catch up. From about two or three days worth. ::headspin:: 

Quick update just 'cause I haven't been on in a few days. Got my grades today. Just what I expected. I got disqualified (aka kicked out). I don't know yet if I'm going to send in an appeal letter yet. It depends on if I get this job. This woman my mom works with runs a company with her husband and they're letting their secretary go at the beginning of the new year. I might get that job if they'll hire me. 8 bucks an hour, 40 hours a week. Better than I'm doing at Arby's. I had 12 hours this past week. I have 13 this week coming up. That totally sucks to no end. 

Oh! And I finally got a flippin' car. It's a 1993 Buick LeSabre, navy blue. Not much to look at, really, but it runs really well and gets me to and from Muncie. Definitely an improvement over my Lumina. The driver's side door opens AND there's a radio. Definitely a step up.

But...yeah. Not much else going on. Courtney and I stayed up until 7 this morning just talking. We never talk anymore. I was surprised at just how much we have in common. We're both the outsiders now. 

My dad wants me to move back to New Castle and get an apartment with  him. I was thinking about it, but...I'm a 19 year old girl. How weird would it be for me to move back in with my dad? I'm an adult, but he'd try to be the parent. He always does. And he refuses to take Phoebe, which was my big thing. I'm taking my puppy. And...I just think it'd be weird. Am I making too much of this?

Iunno. Just...basic update. Yeah. That's what's goin' on. Love ya guys!

Merry Christmas!!"

"event","Blegh. Hiatus. I'm getting ready to go on Christmas Break for three weeks. Limited/no Net again, as usual. I'll get online when I can, but don't count on it. Hopefully I'll be back at BSU January 8. If not...I'll get online when I can.



For now, I'm just sitting here, desperately trying to get ahold of someone to cover my shift tonight. I don't know what to do. I've been trying to call Patience for the last hour and her phone's been busy. Her dad promised he'd have her call me as soon as she got home. My ride's not going to get here until 5 now and the halls close at 6. I'm supposed to be at work right now and work until 9:30. FUCK. Even if I get there, how'm I gonna get home? I can't ask Jessica to drive back up here and get me after she already has once. Still have to catch the fish and snails, put 'em in cups and clean out the tank before I leave. I won't get to work until at least 7 at this rate. Don't know what the purpose of even going in is. It's the last weekend before Christmas and Muncie's dead because 18,000 students just left for the holidays. We're NOT going to be all that busy. ::headdesk::"

"event","Okay, okay. Go ahead and say it. I waited too long. Blegh. All the cheap cars I want are sold. So now I have to run around like a chicken with my head cut off trying to find a ride home and a car. My sister is going to come get me tomorrow, so that works. Now I have to call Arby's and find someone to cover my evening shift. I can't ask my sister to help me get back home, then drive me back to Muncie, then come back and pick me up a few hours later. 

So...now it's the waiting game. Waiting for Jess to call me back about that friend of hers that was selling the Neon. Looks like I might have to get it, after all.

Yeah. Twelve fucking hours. ALL WEEK. The sad thing? Everyone has those kind of hours. Except for the SIX managers. So the six managers are basically running the store while the rest of us have to go broke. Who needs six fucking managers??? That's not even counting the shift managers and team trainers. These are just general/operating managers. We have more managers than employees!!



But now...pimpage!

Ground rules:
The first player of this ""game"" starts with the topic ""Five Weird Habits of Yourself"" and the people who get tagged need to then write a LJ entry about their five quirky little habits as well as state the rules of this game clearly. At the end, you need to list the next five people who you want to tag.

The weird habits:
01. I never stop moving. Ever. If I'm standing in line, I'll be shifting back and forth. If I'm sitting, my leg will be bouncing or my fingers will be moving. Always. 
02. I'm anal about spelling, usually. Even in an IM. I have to capitalize everything and double check my spelling. If I see it, I have to fix it.
03. I'm a pack rat. Seriously. I have so much junk on my desk/in my drawers it's not even funny.
04. I always have to have something uncovered when I sleep. Either a hand or a foot or something. If I'm all covered up I freak. And I can't sleep with socks on. Absolutely cannot.
05. When I talk to someone, I will almost never make eye contact unless I absolutely must. I'm not spacing, but I just don't like making eye contact for a long period of time. Freaks me out.

I tag...

"event","So i've got all of my final marks except my outdoor ed. one. I am happy to report only one C. the other three are B-, which is alright with me. I really am wonder what i got on my outdoor ed. final though. I kind of rush through that one so that i could come home. 
Meh, whatever. 
Christmas was good i suppose. I got a whole bunch of movies. and books. must not forget the books. My aunt got me the Angels and Demons book, by Dan Brown. Its the first adventure of robert Langdon, who is, as most people know, the main character of the movie/book the Davinci Code. Its pretty interesting so far. The switching POV's kind of are annoying, but you get used to it. 
Mish just trimmed my hair. I think i have hair trimming stuck to my shirt and they are really itchy. 
Went to grandmother's house, as is the tradition for new years day. My aunt gave me this nasty mint vodka margurita thing. I was kind of expecting more mint and less vodka, but as it was, it was basically green booze. Bleh. I do believe my aunt is a closet alcoholic. well, less closet, more alcoholic, but you get the point. 
Kim drove the truck to the grandmother;s house after she was done work so we had two vehicles. we managed to convince the parents to take the truck, while we rode in the van. my sisters introduced me to an interesting song called ""Pussy Lovers"". It contains a clip from ""From Dusk Till Dawn"". I really quite enjoyed it. It was amusing. 
Went babysitting yesturday. Mother is convinced that they didnt pay me enough. Well its not like i had anything better to do, and they did give me twenty dollars extra. Apparently mother either cant count or she believes im some sort of super sitter. Since i spend most of my time arguing with the kids when their awake and watching movies when their not, i dont really usually expect that much of a tip. If i had like 7 kids, like that one time when all the parents with the younger kids decided to have a party and stuck me with all of them, then i would expect alot more money. But as it is, i'm happy with my rates of 5$ an hour. It works for me. 
Anyway, im off to see if any of the fanfics i've been reasing have updated.

"event","Alrighty, so lately, I've been having a weird fixation on Zombies. No not that kind of fixation. Bah, pick your minds out of the gutters, you freaks. I mean, I keep wanting to watch Zombie movies. They still freak the hell out of me and everything (I have a rather freasome phobia of zombies. Lets just say i'm really glad i live on the third floor of an easily blockaded building...) But I've really want to write a zombie story suddenly. And by suddenly, I mean since like 2-3 nights ago after i watched Shaun of the Dead. Not to mention the story i promised my sisters i would write, along with my own private project that will never again be mentioned. 
Bleh. Now i'm rambling and i need to go to bed. 
37 hours until i'll be on my way home.

"event","Holy gods. I have never cried that bad at a movie ever. The only one that has even gotten that close was The Green Mile. 
The relationships and connections you build with the characters is overwhelming. It is one hit after another until it finally becomes too much, and you break down. I have not ever wept during a movie. I have not wept at all in a long time. Ben Kingsley delivers a stunning preformance. 
I believe that people need to see this movie at least once. 

Behrani: [Praying for his dying son] Please, God, don't take my joon-am. I make my nazr. My nazr, hear me, please to hear me. I will give everything to one who is less fortunate. Yes! I will make it for the broken bird. Please, God, I'm making nazr to this woman. To Kathy Nicolo. And I, to you I promise, if you heal my son, I will return her father's house. I will also give to her all the money I have. My God, Khoda. I make nazr only for my son. Please, I want only for my son. I beg you. I will do whatever is your will. I will purchase ten kilos of the finest seed and I will find an American mosque and I will feed them to all the birds outside. I will let the birds cover me and peck out my eyes! Please, God, my nazr is in your hands! 

God, you know things turns to shit when a father is forced to pray for these things. Absolutely stunning movie.
Watch it."

I will finally get to sleep in tomorrow. No getting up early to jam in all the study time i can. Nope. There are no exams on SUNDAYS!! PArty! Mm...no probably not. Will have to finsih Raisa's scarf before she leaves monday. I curse those who get to leave before i do.

Man, I've been craving a cross between grape juice and iced tea (nestle iced tea) for like 2 weeks now. Speaking of which, i'm thirsty. I also cant type right now. I keep making stupid mistakes like forgetting random letters. Whoopsy!
Am watching a movie called "" House of Sand and Fog"" tonight. Apparently its very very sad. Me, I;m in it for Ben Kingsley. I quite enjoy his acting.

I need to know whether i need to be prepared for a roomie or not. bah. anyway, rented a whole bunch of movies yesturday (bought one as well)including but not limited to V for Vendetta (which really drew me in, eventhough i really had to concentrate to hear anything...bah) and AVP (ye gods  i love that movie) and Ella Enchanted (am currently rereading that book.

Yeah thats about all the excitement right now. got my first pay check. man I love 10 $ an hour. It was a pay check for one week. i had a mad giggling attack when i saw it. nuff said.

not much here either. watching lethal weapon right now. urrgh, Mel Gibson had a bad hair cut back in the day. doodeedoo. heh, saw POirates, yesturday, as i said i would. i can decide whether i liked it or not. okay i liked it but was rather disappointed that, at the end of the movie, it just ended. but you know, not at the end of the story. Bastards. Heh, the Davey Jones guy was totally played by the guy who did Viktor in Underworld. teehee. i was giggling madly when i figured this out. from master vampire to octopus faced evil pirate guy. how funny is that.
I wish i was a pirate.
On the other hand, the coreographing for all the fights and whatnot were really...elaborate...yeah. But really cool.
Got a new book that i've read before, plus 2 others. The one that ive read before was ""Blood and Chocolate"" by Annette Curtis Klause. God i love that book. I want a dude like Gabriel. I can take or leave the werewolf thing but everything else...WOOHOO!
The other two were ""Dark Prince"" by Christine Feeman. From what i gather, its about vampires. and its a romance novel. yeah. not sure if i like it you.
ill update later about the other book.

Anyway, my buddy who goes by the name of Choccies (her live journal) writes many a Harry Potter fanfiction, and one original. Go see them if you like.I outlined the plot for one of them. Woot. Now if only i could write my own stories. So many ideas floating around in my head.
so schools over now. signing up for university is really stressful. bwa. Anyone going to Augustana Faculty of the U of A next year? (0.o)
So my little cousin is visiting for Quebec. I love little kids that speak french. so cute! =^.^= of course shes trying to have a conversation with my little sister, who doesnt understand any french (how did we come out of the same womb, i wonder?) I'm stuck translating. idiot. go sit with mother and the other relatives and i wont have this problem.
so I've finally found someone who likes Laurell K. Hamilton as much as i do, at the cabin this weekend. i can finally have an intelligent conversation without having to explain EVERYTHING...that gets really irritating. (""...the hell? were-LEPARD?! What kind of crack books are you reading?"" yeah, thats a commun one.)
Gah...i feel really close to the computer screen. but if i sit back i cant reach the keyboard. no wait i got it now....*cough* n.n

"event","Hola all, (heh, not that anyone reads this but me)
havent posted in a long time, alas, i felt the need to do so now. Have been applying for university. i hate the postal service. other than that nothing interesting has happened in a long time. Have been feeling rather ill as of late. My urges to write are getting stronger. I want to write an original piece of work, which, unfortunately, would have to be a fantasy fiction piece of work. Probably. I have so many ideas floating around in my head that its hard not to just combine them all. Sadly though, that would make a rather shody book, so i must restrain my imaginings. 

Any way, Yuu Watase (writer of Fushigi Yugi, Ceres and Alice 19th) is coming out with and new series called Absolute Boyfriend. Most amusing. I've only read the first one, but even that was mighty addicting. Will she go for the new boy? or will she turn to an old friend? Intriguing. 

I've also reread some of my favorite works by Katie McAllister. This is one author everyone should check out. She has books revolving around everything.Noblity, pirates, vampires, dragon (and other such mythical creatures), scotsmen, and jousting are some of the different subjects covered in her different books.

We are supposed to be doing an independant reading project for my English course. I chose to do the book The once and future king by T.H. White. A book I've been wanting to read for a while, which means now that i actually have to do work for it, i wont read it. My mind is rather contradictory in that fashion.

Finally got up the courage to read Micah by Laurell K. Hamilton. I dont know why i was dreading it, but i was. I found that once i started it, it went by very quickly, and i really enjoyed it. The reading finally gains some insight to what anita is. Not alot, but enough to intice th reader into continuing the series. Unfortunatly it gave a sneak peak of the next book (Danse Macabre coming out June 2006). Good god the suspense is killing me. Is she or isnt she? Bwa, i dont want to wait until june (probably later because i am a cheap bastard, and i dont like spending more money than is intelligent on a book. The hardcovers are always so expensive, although with the canadian dollar doing so well, perhaps the price will be lowered?...)

Anyway, off to find some fanfiction.

I hate people. working in retail sucks, but it pays good money so ill stick too it. but seriously do all women have to make such a mess when they shop. If theres a pile of neatly folded clothes that some one had just spent half an hour refolding, its *obvious* you should try and get the bottom one out of the pile with out lifting up the shirts on top of the one your going for. Its a contest. who can do it by messing up the top ones the most. andt then you go to the mens side. they dont touch anything! they look for their size with out hardly touching the item of clothing. gah. it pisses me off so much.
Anyway. Man i love the soundtrack to Tarzan(disney). Excellent scores. I just love soundtracks ingeneral. good stuff those. ANyway, the father figure is watching the time machine. the old one. gah. good movie but boring at the same time. I have to clean my fish tank. and my room. mothers going to get on my back about it again tomorrow. I'll definetly do the fishtank after i get home from work. Its kinda green in there. for some reason the fish love this. of course i could totally be misinterpreting their fishy body language, but no!
I dont know what im talking about anymore. Too tired to think. Also, while at work today, i discovered that im totally an attention seeker. which annoys me greatly.  Not an attention seeker like ""Oh, I'm going to dye my hair because im sucha reble"" kinda thing. My hair is still virgin. yep.
Not like one of the dumbasses at work. Dyed her hair piss yellow because she likes to of the boys that work there. Apperently she applied for the job, there just because shes liked them for like 3 years each. stupid girl. Getting a job is totally going to make them like you.

I've noticed that its not like that alot with Anita Blake (by Laurell K. Hamilton) where you dont have to read the first few books in the series. She refers to past events, which i find awesome, cause since in first person major, i figure we all have memories, and it helps to look back on stuff that might affect current events, anyway, the parents are getting annoyed with my clickity-clacking so i shall have to say goodbye and continue this story later. On my next day off....mur, it'll be more interesting next time i promise.

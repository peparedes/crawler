"event","I still maintain a four month period of well... nothing. Dont get me wrong its nice not dealing with the shit that goes along with hooking up but i cant say im not disappointed.

Just call me Rachel... yeah thats right i am the new 518 rachel i guess. after going to the wrong house for a house party the owners informed me i look like the girl who used to have my room. Hopefully she had more fun in my room yet at the same time...hopefully not my bed. 

Drama free... not me! Cant wait to go home tomorrow, much needed break from buffalonians and the CC residents. go figure ill probably come back a day early to chill though. What im excited about... trip to the liquer store once im back in motown. of course im excited to see people too, but alcohal helps all situations. 

i rearranged my room tonight, i think it helped with my recent mood of boredom. I felt in a slump, hell i am in a slump but furniture aint helpin with that. a random trip to the utility closet or hahaha 6am hook up will. 

So for ""melissa""... who feels my roommate woes we must find a way to vent. also on mission against your will is to out the ambiguously, possibly gay. other missions will be posted when applicable."

"event","Just got done with web registration for next semester's classes. anticipation and a heart attack all at 9am, i hate registration. Lately... i think im dating some one but who knows, havent been on a date in 2 weeks but we're together every night. He wont be around after christmas so i wont have to define the relationship, there wont be one. 

As to the party life. More and more house parties, now i've got an in with the owners of the beer pong house. I also met the bar tender at a dive that resembles lake como but with a arcade bowling game. The crew there is tame but fun. Drinkin buddy is erica for the most point but if i wanna get high theres 20 people begging to smoke me up, that i dont understand, why share weed with someone who doesnt care? i know im stingy with alcohal, i dont go trying to get people to drink all mine.

"event","new boys, so yeah irebound quick but thats good it keeps me chipper. City boy's girl is here again this weekend,the only thing that pisses me off is that he interrupts my cigarrette breaks with the awkwardness. how dare he? so then i brought new boy into the picture, we arent joined at the hip but we have chemistry. 
ive got the concert on tuesday, niagara falls for a bingefest without a dd, this will  be memorable. flogging molly is worth it though. so is he. hes high strung enough to make a yanni concert fun as hell. 
the rest of the week is a countdown to getting home, back to the field parties, specific trouble making boys wink wink, awesome friends and all that homecoming hoopla"

"event","i managed the weekend. i did it completely trashed but i managed. I even stayed in his room, with his roommate. so i may have drank more, smoked more and flirted more then i should but im going through the motions, i cant let people think that the insensitive asshole had an effect on me, so i was carefree and had fun. 
what i miss most is my boys, the crew back home that help me realise what its like to not have constant sexual tension and there's the ones where that tension is fun and playful, no hidden subtext, i feel like im on a teen drama out here and all of my roommates get to watch the plot unfold. well i hope the next episode gets better because the series finally when i go back to motown is gonna be one hell of a trip."

"event","so i pick the sketchy boy, sure hes into heavy drugs, sure he has fucked up hair but he was sweet, geniune and didnt treat me like the whore around here. it was unexpected but a connection. so we get together, not hook up but like together, we called, hung out, just relaxed and cuddled, then it stops. 
i figure ok so we did get 3 hours of sleep and he is tired,  he does have homework, his friend is over from college, sure he cant get a ride, my cell was off for an hour, he has to go to ""see his aunt"" it all seemed logical. theni decided i cant be that chick, i wont cross the line as the girl who doesnt get the point. so i backed off, only his friends would talk to me, and they talked alot. I stop by and hes on the phone, i left no point.
so its been 3 days and theres the girl. the girl in the picture i tried to ignore, the girl that has gone out with him twice in 2 hours, and they ask, hey is this your girlfriend. SLAP
Ive been through this before, how many times am i the other woman, for once i switch my ring and hope for a new start and he already has his start, his history, and his future. I wasnt even a fling, i wasnt a one night stand, i was 3 weeks of dating without dating. i look back and realize the signs, hes been here, he has boyfriend material written all over him, cause hes been whipped and not by me. 
so i got my hug, i got my thermos of booze, and ill sleep. i need sleep. ill dream of my solution, of the new one to move onto, maybe its commons boy, perhaps the distant sophmore, im rebounding without the 1st part to rebound from."

"event","i'd say forget classes and focus on the social aspects of college but lately they arent to special either. new boy means only one thing i suppose, new ways to dissapoint and confuse me. to think i even considered dropping the whole commitment phobia. at least it is reiforced now. it starts out at a fuckable situation to me getting fucked over. normal i guess. 
what i want is to revert to the back home boys but then i realize that they have their head up their ass and get jealous over something that makes no sense!! HYPOCRIT.
I'll continue on with my day but if i end up like i was last night im climbing that flight of stairs and bitching out city boy, ok that or just jumping him, like i said it depends on the mood/"

"event","so check it: this one time.....i was in bed falling asleep at 930 when a group of 10 guys comes in the room screaming put on all black and meet in the lounge, since i was intrigued the roommates were at mass i got dressed and went to the lounge. once there,our ra was taking pictures of half the floor in a large group dressed in black and ready to go. i then found out we were gonna sneak attack the 3rd floor and steal their couch because they had one more then we did. we sprinted down the hall, down 2 flights of stairs and onto the 3rd floor where they had baracaded themselves into he lounge, mass confusion and pushing, i took pictures of the whole thing and when we pretty much failed, we went to the 2nd floor who had no idea what was going on and took theirs. 
since  i was in the ""mischevous"" group, turns out the 3rd floor ra was in the elevator and excorted us back to the 5th floor to ""return"" our stolen couch. we werent back ont he 5th floor for more then 2 minutes before 4 public safety officers, 4 RAs and the hall director were screaming at us. so i was the only girl to fess up and say i was in on the 2nd floor raid but there were 10 other guys that stuck with me, i figured i cant get out of it so i wont be a wimp and try to deny it they didnt even take my name so im clear of any blame.
random night in frisch i guess"

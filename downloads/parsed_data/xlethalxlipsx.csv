"event","It's 7:30 in the morning I havent been to bed yet and i feel like i could die right now. I hate myself. billy called me, we made small talk, I was at abby's, she was horny, he came over, they attempted to fuck she didn't like it and we ended up having sex while billy sat on the other bed and watched. I haven't stopped thinking about what I've just done. Abby is my bestfriend, she's there for me when NO ONE else is and yet i felt so discusting having sex with her, because she's not the one I love. I've never felt this way before. I always joke around with some of my old fuck buddies about 'doin' it' but when it comes down to it I back off but tonight i was drunk and i was in one of those situations where i was like ""if i back out she's gonna get pissed and i dont want to hurt her feelings"" but i just wanted to cry, i kept closing my eyes and praying that when i opened them I would see someone else and not abby or billy, it never worked. I'm sitting here so lost, i dont even know what I'm thinking anymore. I regret tonight.

xoxo's

i'm so hungover from the past few days. I need another beer, maybe it'll fix my headache. 

I want *****'s dick in my mouth, RIGHT NOW. haha, not really, ok ok so i do but still, is it a crime to want to suck someone's dick? Hum, i didnt think so. :-P 

I found my old backstreetboys autograph and i'm going to give it to JTI, he got so excited when i told him, it was cute. 

Boys make me smile.

"event","What's new in my life for those who actually care. . .

     +I spent a lot of time at Ti's house. ( a lot of time telling Nick I didnt want to fuck him) 
     +I went to OYP met a nice girl  
     +I realized I had a problem (again) and I'm in the process of taking care of it. Most of you all know what's been going on with me lately. I've been getting pretty fucked up doing a lot of things I wouldnt normally do. Like sex with Nick. (puke) not that I'm talking shit about him. That's not it at all. I just dont like dick. I mean seriously. I've tried. . . I dont think that would have happened had i been sober. I know it wouldnt have. Besides I felt so nasty afterwards.  
     +I watched a good movie over at Ti's place. I think it was pretty old. It's got Reese Witherspoon in it. . . ""Freeway"" . . . It rocked. U should watch it.
     +I fell in love with apple juice all over again! :-D
     +I am offically addicted to Jerry Springer on fox at 4 am. I swear I force myself to stay awake (we all know thats another lie) just to watch Springer. I am pathetic, go on tell me. I already know it! 
     +I went up to Ti's at like 2 this afternoon and sat with him and nick and he ended up getting called into work at 4. I went to abby's got blazed, went to Ti's again, Jordan, Jeff, and Curtis all showed up then we all ended up going over to Lee's house. We sat there for a while, smoke a lil bit, I played online. Played with Lee's cat that is the size of a fucking gerbal. It was sooooo fucking cute. Abby woould fall in love with it. Hell I almost did. Then Lee, Jeff and I went to Jeff's brother's and then they brought me home and here I am now. 


I am so ready for bed but when i look across the room my bed looks so empty. It would be perfect if someone were in there with me. 

Wow if anyone actually reads through this they have even less of a life than i do.

"event","I'm so tired of putting on this whole fake happiness when I am around other people. I pretend to be ok when on the inside I feel like I am slowly rotting away. There's one person who knows how I really feel but she cant do anything about it. She would if she could but, we all know it's not abby that needs the help. I do! At least I know I have her by my side. I really do love her. She's done so much for me. . . I mean really there's no one out there who has helped me the way she has. I dont know I just feel like I'm missing something in my life and I'm not sure what it is. I need someone next to me when i go to bed at night. I want to feel their arms around me when i wake the next morning. Is that really to much to ask for? I just found out that Riki and Lara are moving to OKC. I'm not sure why/when/how they got back to gether but for the first time I really dont care. I need a blunt  . . . I'm outta here. . .

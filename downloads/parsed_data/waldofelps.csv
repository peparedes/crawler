"event","President Elect Obama chatted with the President of Poland. The Poles are not overly concerned about Russian threats to target Poland should the missile defense system be built, they are more worried the system won't be built.&nbsp; Afterwards the Polish put out a press release that said Obama had reeiterated the US's commitment to installing hte missile defense system. Shortly thereafter Obama issued a release saying&nbsp; no, he was sticking to his campaign commitments, without actually spelling those commitments out. So now if the system isn't built, Obama will appear as if he is weak in the face of Russian threats, which is really what the Russian announcement following his election was intended to accomplish.

The rumor that he might get Hillary as Secretary of State would be very helpful for him if true. That choice would suggest a more hawkish administration than it appears so far.

"event","So Russia is putting in new missiles aimed at the missile defense site in Poland. he told Poland that in any potential conflict they would be targeted first. The President of Russia announces this hours after the Obama victory.&nbsp; Think they would have done that if McCain won? Oh and he placed the blame for the World financial crisis on the US and accused the US of supporting barbarism and aggression by Georgia against Ossetia. On the other hand he did send a telegram congratulating Obama and expressing confidence that the new Administration will treat Russia with the proper respect. If Obama doesn't tax the snot of the wealthy, we might get out of this recession in 2 years, and maybe it won't be a full blown depression. had McCain won we certainly would have gotten out of it in 2 years. The very real threats and dangers to our sovereignty and security though are emboldened by this new administration. He needs to deal with this threat decisively and boldly. Anything else will encourage our enemies.

The idea that they are still being curtailed and subject to punishment without due process bothers&nbsp; me. So does the idea that children could be at risk. Convictions that are only held when they are convenient are really not convictions though. If child molesters are really incapable of controlling their urges then a conviction for child molestation should carry a life sentence. The problem with that of course is that it makes a perverse sense then for a molester to kill their victims and reduce the chance of being caught. This is why the hierarchy of punishments is the way it is (with the exception of draconian punishments for certain drug offenses which are both racists and unfair and lead to increased violence amongst drug-dealers). We don't want to encourage criminals to compound their crimes, and we want deterrents to escalation. We also want to minimize the likelihood that any child will be made to suffer this way. We also want to respect the rights of citizens as enumerated in the Constitution. These measures clearly ignore the rights of these former felons, at least the ones who have paid their debt to society. The ones who are on parole could be reasonably expected as a condition of their parole to be subject to these codicils. The biggest problem i have with this is the pre-emptive nature of it. The presumption of guilt is anathema to our form of government.&nbsp; We can't make &quot;exceptions&quot; because in &quot;just this one area&quot; it's ok to compromise our liberties. The real safeguard is how we raise and care for our children. Don't send them out alone to trick or treat at any age, and personally go with them until they are old enough to understand and flawlessly execute the proper etiquette for such an activity. No one's liberties should be abridged because parents are being lazy and want the state to deal with issues they should deal with themselves. <br /><br />-WF<br /><br />PS On the other hand if something like that happened to a nephew or niece of mine, god help the perpetrator because there is no one on earth who will be able to.<br /><br />"

"event","Today was a bizarre day, and it's not over yet.

My tire went flat on the highway.

I have a service that's supposed to help me when things like that happen. I called them. They discovered that the usual process does not apply to problems on I-684. So instead the State police send a privately contracted service. They showed up thinking that I had run out of gas and completely incapable of towing my car as I had requested. Instead, he filled up my busted ass tire with air and told me to quickly get off the highway so I could call someone else to fix my problem.&nbsp; I kid you not. 

I got off at the next exit (my tire deflating as I went) and found a gas station. Gas stations as most of you know, are largely convenience stores that also sell gasoline. They used to be places where you could actually get service for your car. Not so much now. What made it more interesting is that the people at the gas station could not in any way direct me to someplace that serviced cars. After several failed attempts to use the service that was supposed to help me with such things (it's from Verizon, I don't have AAA, but that's going to change in the very near future) I bought a can of Fix-A-Flat and used it. Then I drove up Route 22 back to Brewster and a service station that I remembered as having been there years ago. Luckily it still was. There I encountered the first truly helpful people of the entire experience.&nbsp; 

I recall a contrasting experience once with Ambersong's car and the nice folks at AAA. I'm convinced that AAA is the way to go and yes, my tire is now fine and the car is great and I'm at work (I was around three hours late). later this week I'm buying a spare tire and throwing out the stupid doughnut (it's got a hole in it anyway). I'm also going to put a tire iron in the trunk as well.

Sarah Palin is going to exceed expectations tonight. I'm wondering how Biden is going to dance around his own contention earlier in the year that Obama isn't qualified to be President. If I were Gov. Palin I'd hit that note pretty hard. He also inexplicably in September said that Hillary would have been as good a choice or a better choice than he was for VP. Since she was never vetted for the position (therefore never seriously considered) he's saying Obama ignored the best potential pick. The problem is the undermining of his running mate's judgement and qualification. Palin's abyssmal performance in the Katie Couric interview (so bad she made Katie seem like a serious journalist) not withstanding, she should do better tonight than she has in anything since the convention. For Biden the challenge is to come off as an informed Obama supporter without being made to look like a lying hypocritical career politician who has been in Washington for 35 years. That task is made more dificult because he actually is a lying hypocritical career politician who has been in Washington for 35 years. For Palin the challenge is not seeming like she's totally out of her league. If she bring s the same preparation and talent she bought to the Convention she could pummel Biden tonight. Of course they could BOTH flop, which oddly favors Biden. People are more forgiving of a man who is known for sticking his foot in his mouth stuffing his buster browns past his molars than a woman who is still largely unknown doing the same.

So, I'm continuing the diet and getting to the gym. If I'm going to be relegated to second string I'm going to make that choice seem as ridiculous as I possibly can.

I do apprreciate McCain's point of view that he and Senator Obama should be doing their current jobs to the best of their ability instead of trying to get a new job. Senator Obama does seem to be on board the non-partisan train for this one too, so that's good. What's amusing to me is that the candidate best suited to lead during this type of crisis was sidelined pretty early. This is exactly the kind of thing Chris Dodd should be good at, and yet we have these two instead. The truth is though that whatever is going to happen will be well on its way to happening before January 20. Disaster or no, the time to set a course is right now, not in the middle of the upcoming winter. Really the time was 7 or 8 years ago... but it's too late for that.

I could go back to school at NYU Film school (even had a Bartending job secured through a friend in NYC), I could take an offered job of being a paid Ski patroller in both Colorado and Argentina or I could take a job as an IT Recruiter. Not long after that I walked into a new comic/gaming store a friend had recommended and the girl behind the counter talked me into starting a weekly D&D game at the store. She also told me about a game her brother and his friends were starting that was a ""live"" version of D&D.  I eventually was the best man at that girl's wedding and I bought the company that ran the game her brother and his friends started, and I met all you wonderful people.

As my weight drops it's kind of like a time machine for me. My ultimate goal is my college weight of 195. That could take more than a year from now to achieve, but it's not unrealistic. For my height, build and age a weight of 190 is recommended. I won't be as muscular as I was then (when I was young my legs and abdomen were ripped, my upper body less so though)but I'll be in much better shape than I am now, that's for sure.

I don't regret the decision I made. It led me to being the best man at that wedding, it lead me to more that a couple of amazing women who I've loved in that time and it led me to a career that enabled me to live on an 80 Acre horse farm; take a friend who was in a bad time in his life to Switzerland; I met Tristan; and helped arrange for several children to personally meet Santa Claus. 

I'm looking forward to not being ""the fat man"" anymore. I've got more energy and except for certain nights when a specific stressor causes me insomnia, I'm sleeping better and my general health is greatly improved. My depression was probably weight related as well, or at least the depth of it must have been. It's more surmountable now. My real regret is that I didn't commit this strongly to the weight loss when it might have mattered more, and seemed less like a consolation.

Mom has the nurses convinced she's better, because they all ask the same questions and she's figured out by body languager and inflection what answers thet want.

Mom is on that bandwagon too, at least she certainly was tonight.

She was one of the brightest people I've ever met. I'm not saying that because she's my mom. She could intelligently discuss the works of Joyce, Shakespeare and Ayn Rand. She understood the theories of Jung, Freud, and Skinner. She could fix an oil burner and cook a gourmet meal. She regularly beat me at Scrabble, something only Ambersong can do with any regularity. To see her mind thus reduced is an indignity that makes me question the existence of God, except she taught me that God is beyond my comprehension, too much to fully understand we can only catch glimpses of his shadow as he works behind the scenes. If there is anything about me that you've ever liked or admired, it came from her."

Thank you Ambersong for being you last night. It definitely helped. Hopefully they'll be letting her come home today. We shall see.

I made an early meeting at work today, and things here are going well. The more I talk to and meet other people, the more sure I am of what direction I want various aspects of my life to go in. The weight loss and the other physical improvements are going to continue, as is working hard at my job and being there on time and enthusiastic every single day. 

Even when circumstantial events lend themselves to my defeat, I'll persevere. I'm too stubborn not to. The events of last night have steeled my resolve to have the good life I want to have and  to do whatever it takes to see that through.

Also I need more webkinz.

"event","So it turns out a colleague of mine from back in the day became a serial bank robber last year. he had a cute nickname and he robbed over a dozen banks for a grand total of around $60,000.00. He'll go to jail now for 20 years. When he gets out he'll be beyond retirement age. He was in debt and his home and his vacation condo were in foreclosure and he owed a lot of credit card debt. 

Utterly bizarre.

Good inspiration to work harder at my job however. Twenty years for $60,000.00 comes out to $3k a year.  Crime clearly doesn't pay... at least not enough. Speaking of jobs, still waiting on Ambersong's feedback after the interview.

The convention bounce is favoring the Republicans, they not only over came the bounce the Dems had but bested it. On average (according to RealClear Politics) McCain now leads nationally by 1% across all major polls. Obama has abandoned his ad buys in Georgia and the whole shooting match will now come down to 4 states; Ohio, Michigan, Florida and Pennsylvania. This will not be good news for Obama.  He needs to stop engaging with quips and cute sound bites. He's not going to win on Charisma. And he's had to apologize for too many of them lately because his handlers have underestimated how likable Sarah Palin is and how seriously most people take the issue of reproductive rights vs. the right to life. He needs some detailed policy that can be seen as effective that isn't obviously a rehashing of something Edwards or Clinton came up with.

"event","Obama claims he has more executive experience than Sarah Palin because he has been running for President for 18 months.  I think he's having a drug flashback.  First... he isn't running his campaign, David Plouffe is. Second the worst thing that happens if he screws up (like he did by saying this) is he doesn't get to be president. That really doesn't compare with being a Governor of what would be the 19th largest country in the world if it were a country instead of the largest state in the union. Also...  18 months is less than 24... he needs to re-work some basic math skills there. Although using his logic, clearly John McCain is much more qualified to be President since this is the third time he's running."

Job is busy,which is good. I've got so many things on the verge of closing that I'm sure I'll close something tomorrow or Monday.

Tried to register my new car today and failed. The seller signed his name in the box that read ""Seller's Name"" instead of the one directly below it that read ""Seller's Signature."" Also the DMV wants me to get a clearance letter from the town for the property tax on my truck from last year. There are two probems with that. First,I haven't owned that truck in 4 years, second the tax collector's office isn't open on Saturday morning's anymore. So I'd have to take time off a job that I'm still in the ""probationary"" period of in order to get a letter from a tax collector about something I don't actually owe them. That seems unlikely to be something I can get them to do on the phone, and even if I could, how could I get the letter in time to go to DMV on Saturday? I can't call in ""at the tax collector"" tomorrow morning. I have an interview to conduct at 9:15. And client interviews to follow up on all morning.

Read a good poem about Schrodingers cat this week, which had a great perspective on traditional gender roles. It was written by one of my favorite writers. Spent some quality family time with my nephew for his birthday. He's a good little guy, I'm glad I got to see him. 

Picture this, you're tied to a post and Billy Zane is hitting you in the face with a live turtle. After hours of this your face is bloody and abraded, your nose and teeth are broken. It's pretty obvious how this treatment is making you feel. Then Billy asks you, without pausing in his terrapinic assult, if it would help to talk about it and what he could do to make everything ok. 

Obviously that sort of thing doesn't actually happen. Billy Zane would never risk harming a turtle like that, and he's unlikely to hurt you like that either. After all, he's a pretty cool dude.

Great lyric by Elvis Costello ""You were the spice of life, the gin in my vermouth.""  What makes it great of course is that the natural relationship of gin to vermouth, in their natural co-habitative environment the martini, is a lot of gin to very little vermouth. How little vermouth you ask?  To make the classic dry martini, you fill a shaker with ice, you pour in one shot of vermouth, shake it till the ice is coated in vermouth, then strain the excess vermouth out. Next you fill he shaker with gin, and stir it in the ice gently, allowing just a hint of the vermouth to combine with the gin. You then strain the vermouth laced gin into a chilled martini glass and add a  little plastic sword with three olives to the glass. Voila, a classic martini. 

Been listening to Echo and the Bunnymen tonight, not sure if that has hidden meanng or not, but these lyrics popped out at me:

Seven seas
Swimming them so well
Glad to see
My face among them
Kissing the tortoise shell


Makes me wonder about Billy drinking a martini from a bloody turtle shell and armies of coneys attacking sleeping bears. Important safety tip, don't poke the bear.

Yeah, Insomnia... it's as much fun as it seems."

You don't treat people the way you want to be treated because it's profitable, or because you expect some karmic payback. You do it because it's the right thing to do. Cruelty and vengeance are not justice, you should strive to not confuse them for it.

A justice system that puts chauffuers in prison because the prosecution convinced 3 out of 5 guys the prisoner was probably guilty of something... is not really justice.

"event","In the last few days there have been several gaming incidents that have been reported about on major news sites. Why? It's a virtual experience. While some are humorous or interesting, why are major news sites picking up on it?

One such incident was the <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7667194685876573666&q=serenity+now""> ganking of a funeral service</a> in World of Warcraft. While a little cruel, it was rather humorous to me that A) They held it in a contested zone on a pvp server, and B) announced they would be coming unarmed.  It was just dumb.

Now, I hear about a <a href=""http://www.impactlab.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=7828"">Gamer Sentenced to Digital Crucifixion</a> in a game based on Roman Britain, where he repeatedly killed new players as they joined.

So, while controversial I agree, I think it's a little ridiculous that it's ""BIG NEWS!""."

"event","So um, yeah. I'm totally starting this off with the best post ever. It will be remembered for years to come as ""The Beginning"". It will be talked about amongst LJ members long after I am gone too.

I'll be sure and post it as soon as I can come up with it. ^.-"

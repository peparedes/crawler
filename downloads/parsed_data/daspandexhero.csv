"event","I feel awful. It's probably the writer's block. I've had 2 weeks to come up with a treatment and I have nothing!

What to do? I guess my only choice is to submit something mediocre and blow everyone away with my next draft.

My professor still gives me the creeps.

He wrote me an email asking me to talk to him about my career objectives. It's optional, he says, but I wonder if he has tips for me or something, or if he thinks I have talent and maybe a chance to break into the industry. Ha, I'm probably overthinking it, but wouldn't it be nice?

Back to writing, I guess."

"event","I spent the last 2 hours reminiscing, archiving, and deleting old entries.

Wow, I used to be such a prick 2 years ago. It's kind of interesting how my deepest concerns back then don't mean a thing to me now. Oh wait, I still hate my mother.

Reading my Paramount-inspired entries brought a smile to my face. I barely keep in touch with any of those people. I think Carine emailed me two weeks ago and I had promised that I would send her pictures, but I forgot. I spoke with Chris a while back about Ron's little movie that my friend randomly found. They were such a major part of my life for those 6 months last year, and now...nothing. Kind of sad, but that's life, I guess. However, reliving those memories was refreshing as I've been studying/practicing my Chinese all day."

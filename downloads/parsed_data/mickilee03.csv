"event","I registered for school this morning. So why do I feel like I made a mistake? Not really a mistake... just a waste of time. I thought maybe Id like a degree in business, so I am taking an Intro to Bus class, along with english, math, and speech. It should be a relatively easy semester... I guess. I dont know why I feel so weird inside. I cant just take a semester off, and I didnt want to do massage therapy, so there weren't a whole lot of other options. I consider these classes a minor way of taking up time in the mornings, when I am awake and every other person I know is sleeping. 

   So okay I guess the main reason Im feeling... out of place... is because Stephen dropped the bomb on me last night. He's been thinking a lot about going to Florida, and I was okay with that, because it was going to be at least another year or two. But last night he told me that he wants to go this fall. Thats like in 6 months. That just scares me so much. Honestly a few weeks ago I was talking to my mom about it, and she was like ""if yall are still together in two years then I would think the appropriate thing to do would be to go with him"". And it made sense, to be with someone for that long to just go with them. But now we're talking six months away. Thats so soon. Right? I know everyone Ive talked to about it has the same opinion as my mother, whether its 6 months or two years. But I have to let Stephen do what he wants to do. And he wants to go to Florida, and he wants to go now. I guess that just confuses me, because he's done all this talking about seeing us getting married and having a family down the road, and us just being together. But now he's in this big hurry to move across the country. Everyone knows that long distance relationships do not work. There is no point in even trying. Especially with me: I go one day without seeing him and it messes up my whole agenda, and when I see him again I feel like I havent seen him in years. I guess he just doesnt feel the same way, or with the same emotion i dont know. But I cant do long distance relationships. And if we know its going to end in six months, then why would we even bring up the idea of marriage and family and staying together? And if that is out of the picture, then why would we date at all? I dont like the idea of just dating someone for 6 months, getting attatched to them, and then just ending it. Ive been praying about it constantly, and I guess that is all I can do at the moment.  I guess that is all I really need to do, because God already knows what my life is going to by like in 6 months, and I have to trust Him that he knows what he is doing. Yet still I ramble away with my anxieties and frustrations... I have to get it out somewhere, because I cannot bring it up to Stephen. It would look like I did not support him or his music, and I do - completely. I know that he's gonna make it, and that Everdying is headed for great things. He just put the idea in my head that I would be headed with him.  ~sigh~ now I guess Im just being selfish. Ok, its time to stop before I get carried away and say something that I dont mean... but maybe I do? I dont know.. confusion and apprehension are clouding my thoughts.. 

  I have to talk on a lighter note, before I end my entry. He is by far the greatest guy Ive ever met in my entire life. Last night I kept him up till 2 talking to me on the phone, because we had watched a freaky movie and I was scared to drive home alone. He's supportive, and caring, and everything I need. He is the only person Ive ever met that can put a lid on my temper, and we all know Ive got the worst.  Im also a complete spoiled brat, and somehow he is ridding me of that, slowly but surely. He's amazing.   Okay now I feel better, because it seems all I ever do is point out the bad in our relationship in my entries, and I wanted it to be expressed how much I actually care, and how wonderful he really is."

"event","Well work wasnt the greatest, but I guess if it was we wouldn't call it work, right? For what its worth I really like my job, so I guess I cant complain too much. 
  I miss austin so much!!! I dont like how things are without him here. I talked to him online tonight for maybe 2 minutes, and then he had to go. sigh. Im not happy about it. But as soon as I can I am goin to Ft Worth to see him. I dont care if I have to drive there myself.
   So I almsot got in a wreck tonight, it was horrible. I dont really feel like writing about it, as it brings my good mood way down. But just take my word for it : it was horrible.
      Okay, Okay, I have like the best boyfriend ever.  Usually people say that after their significant other brings them roses, or writes them poetry, or does/says something completely beyond sweet and romantic. But I prefer not to wait for those moments, parshly because I dont know if they will ever happen, but mainly because I think he is worth the compliments just how he is. Being with him is like hanging out with one of my best friends. I can just chill and be myself. He's the best. There's not really any other way to describe him. You'll just have to take my word on that one too. 
   Hmm. Its 1 in the morning. Ive got to work at 11, then go to Stephen's show in Dangerfield. I love hearing them play, so yeah Im really excited about it. But its gonna be a long and tiring day/night/early next morning. Im out for now."

"event","Okay, I decided to go to TJC for the semester, and take some classes, and not worry about next semester till I get to it. I feel a lot more at peace about everything.  Well, at least school and that area. I think I am still somewhat confused about Stephen. Everyday we spend together, I like him more and more. And every day I get the feeling that he likes me less and less. Part of me thinks that he is just losing interest like last time, and that everything is going to turn out like before. Part of me thinks that he is starting to have a thing for Kelli again. Part of me thinks that he doesnt feel like I support him enough in his music, because sometimes I get hurt that he cares more about the band than me. But Im learning to just deal with it.  I care about him enough that I am willing to take a backseat to the band, because I guess thats just what I have to do. I just wish that he cared about the two the same, and could balance it out.  But Im going to try not to let that show so much. I care so much about him just being happy, and being in that band is the only thing that makes him happy. I know one day they're going to really make it. They have so much talent. So I will just continue to support him fully in everything, because I care about him that much. I mean I want to support him, I really do. Sometimes the girly side of me just misses the christmas lights and the endless talks about how crazy he is about me. Which goes back to my doubts. Maybe he's not just caught up in the band. Maybe he's just losing the feelings that he had in the beginning. All i know is that I have to cherish what I have right now. And what I have right now is the most amazing boyfriend a girl could ever hope for. If things change tomorrow, then I will deal with them tomorrow. Today I will be happy."

"event","Okay, so sometimes Stephen just really bugs me.  Like before he convinced me that I wanted us to be serious, things were perfect.  He was romantic, and sweet, and totally acted like he cared. I never felt like I was taking a backseat to his band, because he had a way of balancing it all that worked. He took me to look at Christmas lights, and we laid on the docks and watched the stars, and he completely swept me off my feet.  He would tell me how much he needed me, and how happy I made him. Now that we're ""together"" its like none of that matters.  Basically the completely romantic and sweet side of him has dissapeared. And it irritates me. A lot.  I am just the kind of girl that has to feel wanted, and lately when Im with him I dont get that from him. I feel like the only reason he wants me around is to support his band.  I totally support everything that he's doing, but what happened to balancing and romance?? I shouldve known that this would happen... I am so crazy about him, so how come lately Im irritated all of the time? I guess I just have to put up with it, and realize that this is just how things are going to be. I wish he could see that I care about him enough to do that..."

"event","I have no clue what I want to do with my life.  Besides that, I have no clue what I want to do this semester. I could go to TJC and take classes. I could do massage therapy.  My mom asked me why I dont just take a semester off, and relax. I know my friends would jump on that opportunity, but I cant just sit around for 4 1/2 months and do nothing. Of course I could work more, and save up, since it seems Im always broke lately. That would seem to be the smart thing to do... or would it?  It feels so socially unacceptable to not be in school. But tons of people take a semester off dont they? I dont know. I feel like if Im not in school, or in training of some sort, then Im not doing anything productive.  I know where part of that is coming from.  As retarded as it is, a tiny TINY part of me thinks that I need to be in school to look good for Stephen's mom. I want her to like me. I want her to think that he found a keeper.  Not a slacker who isnt in school. I know thats horrible. But the truth isnt always pretty. I could always just take 2 or 3 classes on the internet, that way Im not completely out of school. They dont call it part time for nothing.  At least Im still in it all, right? I thought by now I'd have it figured out, because registration is the 13th, and I am running out of time. I wish I didnt have to worry about money and school, and I could just do what I really want to do. But what happens if I have to support my husband? And our family? I know I have the brains for a law degree, or something else that would keep us comfortable. I just dont want to. But I guess if it came down to it sacrifices would just have to be made.

Speaking of sacrifices. Last night Stephen tried to talk to me about Florida. There is a trade school there where he could do audio engineering, and the whole band would probably go. I know the idea completely thrills him. But Im terrified. He'd be gone for a whole year. I dont like going one day without seeing him.  I know that Im being selfish. He has to do what he wants to do; what makes him happy.  But I cant fathom us spending an entire year so far away from each other.  But I told him Id support him no matter what, and that means if he wants to go to Florida, then I have to support him, and at least act happy. I want him to be happy, I really do. I guess if he's happy in Florida then that is where he has to go. It just hurts, because we've talked about things that couples dont usually like to talk about. He told me that when he looked at his future he saw me there with him. I guess its just not the same now. I know that he changes his mind all the time, I just didnt think that he'd change his mind about me. But all I can do is support him in all of his decisions, and pray. I refuse to be selfish and spoiled... even though... is it really that selfish not to want your boyfriend to move across the country for a year? Well I refuse to bring it up. He's got new dreams now, and I wont ruin them for him. 

Well, its off to work..."

"event","First of all, Everdying rocks. Tonight I went to their show, and it was so awesome. Those boys are so talented, I know that they will make it in one way or another.  Everdying would be the band formerly known as Mahanaim (mah-ha-nay-em).  It was a great night. The ride home was uncomfortable but humorous. It was definitely one of those ""had to be there and utterly tired moments"". 

I saw Austin today!!! I miss that boy already. I will have to visit him so much, he keeps my spirits up and my sides splitting. I hope he misses me just as much as I miss him...

 Im very excited that I finished my roll of film so that I can get it developed tomorrow. I know that most of those pictures are going to be of me and Stephen, but oh well, its not a waste. Speaking of that boy, things are so much better. He's hurt, and needs time to heal (i guess?not sure), but we are still together and things seemed to be back to normal all day.  He knows that I support him fully in his music and every other endevour that he chooses to partake in. Things were so shaky last night, and this morning, but I think the worst is over.  I am just glad to be back in his arms, because that is where I am most comfortable. I truly believe that we were meant for each other, and sometimes his eyes tell me that he feels the same way. I love being with someone who is not just the most amazing boyfriend I've ever had, but also one of my bestfriends. It is a blessing solely from God. 

Well its four in the morning, I might want to get some sleep."

"event","The ski trip was amazing. Even though I was sick the whole time, it really was great.  Well, until the ride home.  First of all, none of us got any sleep the whole trip, and sleeping was a difficult task on the way home.  For the most part, me and Stephen were ok. Tired, but ok.  Then somehow we ended up trying to sleep, and I guess I made a fool of myself. I dont remember it because I was basically asleep. But I was later informed that I told Stephen that I didnt think we should date anymore, and then went back to bed.  To say the least when we got back he was hurt and confused. I tried to apologize, but nothing worked.  He really just could not believe that I had made a mistake. I spent the night crying, attempting to sleep, but failing.  I could not breathe, because the idea of not being with him was beyond terrifying.  I dont know if we are broken up, or together, or about to break up, and it is a horrible feeling.  I want to spend the rest of my life with him, and I dont think he wants to spend another day with me.  I told him last night that I loved him. Ive never said that word before, but I meant it with all of my heart. I just hope that he can forgive me. I know that he has hurt me so many times in the past and Ive forgiven and moved on. Why cant he do the same? He spent so much time telling me about his feelings and how much he cared, yet now its just gone.  I dont know what else to say, the tears are over riding the ability to type. I think I will try to sleep, but I know that the only place I need to be is back in his arms... we were comfortable and broken in. Not being with him is a nightmare I cannot repeat again."

"event","Well, it is Christmas, and I love it. I was so worried that things would be horrible, but God is good. Bonnie, Daniel,and Michael came over to exchange gifts, and everything was above cordial: we laughed and talked and there was no fighting whatsoever. It was the best present for me, to see everyone getting along. That is all I wanted. Now the ""men"" are playing PS2, and the ""ladies"" are doing something horrible to a chicken in the kitchen. Sadly, I do not fall into either catagory at the moment. I tried to help with the terror in the kitchen, but I just could not do it... lol... I will when I have my own family and it will be lovely. So here I am on Christmas morning at the computer writing away in my journal, of course.  My presents were lovely, but I prefer to watch everyone else, that is much more fun for me. 

 Stephen received his gift yesterday, and he told me that he loved it. I hope that he really did.  My ring is beautiful, and every time I look at it I think of him, and I smile. He has a way of making me do that a lot. (smiling, that is)... I love when we find ourselves at 2am talking about things that concern our relationship. He doesnt mind talking about his feelings and his likes/dislikes; I love him for that. My friends want me to go to the club tonight. I asked him if he cared, and he said that he trusted me and to do what I wanted. But eventually he admitted that the idea did indeed bother him. He's so amazing to be so understanding. But im not gonna go. I dont like the idea of making him uncomfortable, and I dont really have the desire to go anymore. I guess that is stupid? But I dont care. I know what will happen if I go, and he would not like that, so why would I want to go? He makes me so happy. So okay, I am not going and that is that.

I cannot wait to go to Breckenridge. This is going to be so awesome. I need to get away from Tyler and the stress and the crap. New Year's Ever (hopefully) is going to be the best... hmmm... I guess we will see. I hope I am not dissappointed. Merry Christmas everyone!"

    Stephen got me a ring for Christmas, and I love it. I did not think I would, because Im picky about jewelry, majorly. But it is beautiful, and I know he put thought and effort into it.  It is a heart, held by two hands, with a crown on top. It stands for friendship, love, and loyalty.  Yes, I cried when I opened it.

I love Christmas time, but Im thinking this year may suck.  My mom and my sister are getting into it constantly right now.  My sister invited my uncle (rick) to her graduation... okay right? wrong. My mom and her brother have not gotten along since they were children, and it has caused quite a rift. Well something happened with the seats, and my mother ended up sitting behind my uncle.. I dont know, I did not think it was that big of a deal. Well my mom blames my sister's husband (daniel) for the whole thing, accusing him of trying to suck up to my uncle (why??). Now my mother and my sister are not really speaking, and they have decided to put me in the middle of it (why me??). Its so hard because they end up getting mad at me for who knows what reason.  We cant have Christmas over here, because my mom does not want to have Daniel in her house, and we cannot have it there for the same reasons... So now Im stuck trying to make everyone happy, and save Christmas, and I dont think its going to happen.  Why cant everyone just get along??  I mean, come on, its CHRISTMAS... ~sigh~"

Still havent heard from Daniel. I dont think he's going to be calling any time soon. I wish he would though.  Chad and steph and austin ate at mercardo's yesterday and saw him. Random thought with no real point. 

I dont really know if i'll make it through my expo shift tonight.. I feel like crap. The only humorous part to this is Stephen is prolly gonna get sick too then... hahaha. but really that would suck if we were both sick on the trip. He was sick last year too.  I know thats simply horrid, but Im laughing at the thought of it. I know, my dry, ironic, and cruel since of humor is not greatly appreciated... haha... 

I still have not found out what he put on his profile that I need to see.  I hope it is nothing bad.. I never meant for him to find out how neurotic i was about kelli being on there... The last thing I want to do is start anything.

I hope it stays just like this. hmm... I think I write way too much about that boy.

Chad told me some things last night that really got me thinking. I wish that he felt differently than he does, but I cant change that and neither can he.  I wish he would hook up with someone. I know that sounds kind of awful, but I do. He's been acting different lately, and I dont know why, but I would like to think that a girl in his life would change things up a bit, for the better.  He deserves only the best though, and I would hate for him to date just anybody. I know that he'll find that someone when the time is right. And im pretty sure Im not gonna like her. But that is just the overprotective side of me talking, since no one is good enough for my baby! I do love him though.

Austin cracks me up. I know he doesnt want me and crim to work out, and he straight up told me that. But then again, several people have told me that. Austin is the best, and Im going to miss him so much when he moves. I do think though that him and steph would definitely be an oddly delightful pair. I dont know what she would say to that, but it would be fun to watch. They are night and day, and that is fun.

I miss daniel. Our conversations are few and far between.  I know that he must hate me for what Ive done, but honesty is the only way to go. I think he is super special, and I wish he would call more often, so we could hang out. I dont think stephen would like that very much, but on the other hand, he's super understanding. Plus, we are not together. I can hang out with whomever I choose, right? If crim is so crazy about me, he better figure out what he wants and soon, b4 someone comes along and swoops me up... i think im only half serious when I say that... i think. I just dont like acting like we are together if we are not together. I cant say ""well im sorry i cant give u my number because the guy that Im kinda chillin with, not dating, but kinda back together with would not like that""... you dont say crap like that. I know he is taking his time, but his actions should follow his feelings.. if he just wants to chill, then we should just chill, and let me be free to frolic as i please. I guess that is simply horrible of me to say, but then again, i must be honest.  sigh... what am i suppposed to do? I am just going to let things figure themselves out, and trust that God knows what he is doing.

I think that I want a peanut butter sandwich ...hmmm... i dont know where that came from. I have to go christmas shopping and soon, bc christmas is 3 days away. I dont know what to get certain people, and its very aggrivating, bc I want to get the perfect gift...yet im broke as a joke bc of this dang ski trip (rock on)..."

I think I could stay up all night talking with Austin and being silly, just because we think a lot alike. Wait, I already have. But I guess that night does not count, because my attention was directed elsewhere. So therefore, I owe Austin a night of silly conversation.  He is one of my favorite people.  His honesty and mellow yellow attitude astound me in a delightful way.  I enjoy our constant *nips* at each other.  Plus, he has come to my rescue more than once when I was having a melodramatic moment and needed verbal assistance. (basically everyday)... he is yummy.
   Right now I am so happy I could burst. I am really starting to think that things between me and Stephen are going to work. He is not a sweet talker, and that is an understatement.  But last night he really opened up to me, and expressed a lot of feelings that I needed to hear to do away with my endless doubts. I know that if Chad could read this he would laugh, and shake his head at what he deems to be foolishness.  But I cannot let that affect my decisions or my feelings. I lied to myself for the longest time, and really believed that I wanted nothing to do with Crim. But I cannot lie to myself any longer. Add Josh to the list of people who think we're nuts.  He told me to my face what a bad idea it was. But I believe that he is really just looking out for my wellbeing and does not want to see me hurt (again). For that reason I love Josh.  I am rambling away, and I know it, but I dont care...  
    So then there is Steph P, and I know that she has her own dramatic irony to deal with, but she sits there patiently day after day and listens to my constant chatter.  She is totally cool. Since this is indeed a public place I will not go into the details of her situation, but I hope that one day I can help her out like she has helped me... 
   I am thinking of oatmeal, and Im not really sure... I love the fact that Austin thinks I am gorgeous.  Everynow and then it is good for a girl to here things like that... I dont really get it from crim, but he's just not like that.  Even though he still has his thoughts on Kelli up on his profile for all to see. I know thats horrid of me to think, but its only my honest feelings. I am so shaky about that situation, I dont know what to think. But I trust that if Stephen says there are no feelings than there are none... so why is she still up there?? I will never say anything to him about it, bc that would make me one of those nagging girls, and I dont want to do anything but make him happy.
  So Daniel called me last night, and that really surprised me in a good way. I am so glad that we can continue our friendship, even though things ended as they did.  I love Daniel- I think he is awesome. He is a great friend to have, and Im totally lucky. 
   I have to go to work today... actually I am working a double, which is no fun, but I have to make money for the ski trip which IS fun, so I guess I gotta. But for the most part I like my job, and the fact that I get to see a certain someone makes me very happy...yay... well I have run out of yummy things to say, and now I only have 30 minutes to get ready...hmmm.... oh well!"

I am so happy with him, and a part of me really wants to believe that he is happy with me as well.  I know that Chad thinks its a complete crock of crap.  I guess only time will prove him wrong...or right.  I fear the latter. Its amazing when you get a second chance at something. You know what to do right, and what not to do wrong.  But Im not going to try to be perfect, bc that is not possible. I am just going to put it in God's hands, and trust that He knows what he is doing.  I hope that Stephen does not mind that I am being so blunt in such a public place, where anyone could read this.  I could lie, or use code names, but this is my journal and I choose to be honest about everything. I guess I do not know what I want right now. Do I want to be with him? Im not quite sure at the moment. I am slightly confused, partially doubting, and greatly afraid of what has happend and what is to come in the soap opera of Micki and Crim. 
   So I really love Chad, I do. And its so hard to be angry with him.  But last night he didnt call, and didnt answer any of our calls.  We would have had no clue where he was if Austin had not called his house.  I mean, come on man, there is such a thing as common courtesy.  I was so worried that something might be wrong. Then when I found out that he had just blown us off, I was pissed beyond extremes.  That is just not right.  But Im okay now, bc Stephen has a way of totally making things better.  I love the fact that I can be hanging out with one of my closest friends, whom I am totally comfortable around, and at the same time be with someone who gives me gigantic butterflies simply when he holds my hand.  Its a rollercoaster of mega proportions and I must say I am definitely enjoying the ride.
   But then I feel just awful.  Daniel is one of the best guys ever.  Ive known him for years, and he's an awesome friend.  We tried the dating thing once or twice, and this last time I really thought it was going to work. I guess I was wrong... I do not know what I am going to do... Have I made a mistake?? I guess time will tell...    For now it is off to work to make some money, so I can afford to go on the snowboarding trip!!!!! SCORE!!!!!!!!"

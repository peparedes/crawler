"event","Right, so my dear friend Mikey won concert tickets to an Ok Go concert at the Tabernacle, a band I had completely forgotten that I had introduced him to God knows how many years back. But I still love their music, so I was thrilled to go. 

First off, this trip only highlighted how very much I hate driving it Atlanta. And bloody cash only parking lots charging me horrific amounts of money. I hate you all. 

Oh, part of the winning package thing he got was that he got to have an interview with a member of the band, who turned out to be the bass player, and video tape it for prosperity. I missed out on that, but it was only 15 minutes or so, and I'm not exactly so in love with the band as to really know them by full name on sight. He was apparently dressed in a bright orange jumpsuit, which I was a bit sad to miss. 

So, after a few hours of waiting and a cookie from Subway, in to the concert we go. And after a while more waiting, the opening band came on, who were nice enough, but nothing too thrilling. Then Ok Go came on, who were wonderful, and I was so happy they did their 'A Million Ways' dance. One of the band member's sister came up with a dance for them to do for a music video of theirs, and they were going to send it off to some hollywood whoever to improve it, but then said 'fuck it, it's good enough'. Good for them. It's by far one of the most amusing things I've ever seen. Oh, and we got to videotape all that as well, which was nice.

Then Panic came on. And when I say Panic, I mean ""Panic! At the Disco"". Dear gods, the screaming of 15 year old teeny boppers was near unbearable. 

Fact one: by being out of high school, this automatically put both Mikey and I in the group of some of the oldest people at this concert. Well, besides the parents who drove said teeny boppers. 
Fact two: by being a guy, Mikey was in a very small gender minority. Seriously, the ratio must have been about 10 to one. 

Besides that, and the fact that I only knew 3 of their songs (one of which I had originally mistaken for another band) we had a great time anyways, just because going to a concert with a friend is fun. I felt a little bad for not really knowing the headlining band, but eh, oh well. They put on a pretty decent show, I enjoyed it, and that was that.

It was one of the shortest main events I've ever seen, by the way, since they only have one CD out, so they played every song on it, plus a cover of a Pixies song. I'd be a little pissed if I was Ok Go, who's been around for 8 years or so, but I suppose everybody just makes more money that way."

"event","...Right, so in order to entertain myself while the house is empty (Julie roommate went back home for the summer and Allison is in New York interning and Chris is in the basement so I don't really see much of him anyways...) I went out and bought whatever DDR is the newest, or so I was led to believe. 

I am horrifically out of shape. Bout the same weight as I've ever been (I'm beginning to think it doesn't really matter a damn what I eat) but I remember a time when playing that game for a straight hour was possible. Not any more. As much fun as wheezing on the floor is after having attempted to have 'fun', I think this may be something I have to work on. 

Or maybe I'll just go out bowling with Cleveland. That's good too. It's a sport, blast it!"

"event","So right, nothing much had happened, so I didn't much bother posting. I went to work. I slept. I doodled. I did whatever the hell I do. 

That was up until about 3pm (technically) yesterday. 


..Sugar Plum is dead. My car, that I loved so dearly, is dead. And I killed her. 

Interestingly enough, I just about joined her. 

We had a big old storm today in Athens, and I was driving through it on my way to work. I reach the main road, sit there at the stop sign waiting for a space, then turn. And continue turning. And some more unintentional turning. And more of that, until I do about 2 360's or so.  Hydroplaned something terrible. And then the back of the car smashed in to a tree and left my vehicle hanging over the side of a water retaining area. Honestly, it looked kind of like a little movie scene. 

So I sat there and took a few breaths after the car stops moving and try to get the key out of the ignition. It's stuck. Screw the key then. I open the car door and there's nothing to step out on. I'm hanging over a ditch with about 12-15 feet to go down. So I slide out of the car, drop down, and walk back around to the front. I'm not crying just yet, just hyperventilating a bit. Turns out the tree I hit is about the only thing keeping the car from falling smack backwards in to the deep ditch. 

I don't even recall the other car hitting me. I didn't even know anyone else was involved until I got out of the car. Even the hit didn't feel that bad, kind of like an amusement park ride jolt. But given the look of the car, maybe I simply don't remember. I do remember I screamed. 

And the poor guy who hit me, or I hit him, or whichever, we're still not sure. He was so nice. He was just happy everyone was all right. He was a lovely christian boy who was nothing but pleasant. He even gave me a gift, a little cross necklace and some candy. Yes, he was probably a youth pastor or what have you, but he was about the best person on the road I could have hit. I'm really glad he was all right.

My sister came out and talked to the policeman with me, and the tow people, and my parents, since I was a bit shook up. My parents, who came up to Athens later, were just happy I was all right. Honest, there was no yelling, not even a 'be more careful next time'. They knew it was an accident, plain and simple. I stopped at the stop sign, I wasn't speeding (there was really no possible room to, anyways), and the only ticket I got was for 'failure to maintain lane'. Well, yes, it is a little hard to do while hydroplaning. Although the pictures my sister took of the car while it was still hanging over the cliff did elicit a 'Holy shit!' from my father. Insurance will be covering it all. I went to the hospital and got my back x-rayed, it was hurting a bit, but not too much. But just to be sure we got it checked out. So I'm fine. Everyone is fine.

But poor Sugar Plum is dead. Rest in peace, Sugar Plum."

I got myself a new job over at Lowe's. Despite the unending amount of training sessions, I already consider it way better than working at Cornerstone. Don't get me wrong, God bless and help the dear souls that take care and educate the youngins, but honestly, I don't like having to work around absolutely everybody else's schedule and come in just whenever somebody decides to sleep in. They just don't pay me enough. And I like sleep way too much.

"event","Well, it's been a little stressful as of late. 

I did have a wonderful time at my party (perhaps a little -too- wonderful, as all my friends know.) And to Stevie I really am sorry about your hoodie. I thought I only ruined my own things that night. To Wes, props to being the only one with both incredible tolerance and a strong stomach. To everyone else, let's do it again next weekend. ^-^

Still waiting for a response for school matters. Stressful.

The housing people at Kennesaw can bite me. Unhelpful, unorganized, and just general morons. Stressful.  

My mother had surgery last Monday. She came home on Thursday and is recovering now, but we had a scare at the hospital on tues. Some idiot tech there gave her more pain meds when she wasn't supposed to have any more and she flatlined for a few moments. My dad was out getting lunch at the time (kinda glad he wasn't around, he might have freaked.) She's fine, but after that they wouldn't let her have any more pain meds at all for 7 or 8 hours, and they were really, really bad 7 or 8 hours for her. The head nurse of the hospital came down to talk to my dad about it, they call every day to see how she is, and the hospital even sent her flowers. This would all be under trying to covering their asses, 101. Very stressful.

And one of my co-workers discovered her mother stole $100 from her wallet to go buy drugs. I feel for her, but it does show that things could always get worse, much much much worse.  

So now I am home for the weekend. Getting my car fixed up, seeing movies, helping to take care of mom, getting various things in order. So not so stressful now."

"event","Right. So yesterday. 

Woke up. 
Felt a little queasy.
It passed, so I went to work.
(I know, you already know where this is going.)
Had lunch.
20 minutes later I was praying to the porcelain god. 
Cleaned up the bathroom.
Went home. 
Called my parents. 
Laid in bed and groaned for a while. 
Had an encore performance after only half a can of sprite and a dose of pepto bismal consumed over a period of 4 hours.
Flitted between napping, sipping sprite and watching the entire first season of Big O. 
Slept. 

I finally felt better when I got up today. Got some real food in me. That was nice. I was hungry. You really forget how horrific smells, any smells, good or bad, become when you're about to toss your cookies. 

God may love all the little children, but they're killing me, however slowly."

"event","Due to popular demand, i.e., the threat of having to go back to Marietta if I didn't get one, I have gotten a job. 

I work at a day care. A church day care. 

...Not exactly the position many people would have pegged me for, hm? 
That's right, every day they trust me with the lives and well being of very small children. While even I did not exactly think this was the best idea, it's really not so bad as I might have thought. Everybody seems pretty decent, for the most part, and the boss lady is incredibly nice. But believe me, I now have a great new found appreciation for anyone who has ever raised children. They puke, they pee their pants, they forever have runny noses and drooling mouths, they cry, they throw fits and are capable of making incredible messes, not to mention a whole slew of other not so attractive features. Yes, it's a glamorous job. 

But at the end of the day when mom/dad comes in and they run over squeeing with joy to see them, maybe to the parents it's worth it. 


...I'm just glad I get paid for it. 


Other points of mild interest:
1.I brought the rest of my crap up from home.
2.I got some new DVDs.
3.Mark left me a bottle of yager in the freezer from his birthday party.
4.Both an oriental grocery store and a very excellent oriental restaurant with tasty tasty asian boys have been found.
5.God bless Papa John's $6 pizza tuesdays."

The comp 
Blade of the Immortal books
A goodly selection of my other books
Comforter
CDs
Playstation 2
Playstation games
DDR mats

Posters
Stuffed Hamtaro
1 bag of Blow pops
Toolkit
Small lamp
Nuns Having Fun calender
My hats
Chris' hat
Purse
Beetlejuice plastic figurine
2 one time use cameras, one used, one not
Swiss army knife
About 15 random wires and cords of all shapes and sizes
Blue orb
Amon/raver necklace
iRiver MP3 player 
Paper lanterns
A random assortment of earrings
Whatever paints I had
Mini hacksaw
Gameboy Advance (black)
Nerf dart gun
Glasses
Toiletries
Monty Python Trivia Day by Day calender

...I'm beginning to wonder if what I think of as my most important objects is just a bit skewed off the norm.

There are four pieces of furniture in my room. One is the bed, one is the trundle bed, which I'm using as a chair for my desk, one is the desk, and one is a set of drawers. After searching for half a bloody hour for what I suspect is a non existent thrift store, I went to Big Lots and purchased a desk there from a very nice man who gave me 56 cents off of the price because I only had exactly 54 dollars in my account, and God help me if I overdraw again. I built that desk, and I am damn proud of it. I am also somewhat frightened that one night I'm going to wake up to the sound of it crashing down upon me. 

I now live with 2 kitties, 2 dogs, 2 turtles, a fish, and 3 party children. Things are somewhat loud around here, as you might imagine. I don't much mind. Anything beats the fire alarm at the old dorm. Monday begins the job search. I have $500 dollars to live off of. If it runs out and I don't have a job, I have to go back to Marietta.

....I -will- find a job.

My parents are coming to visit us on Sunday. I need to tell them to bring my sketchbooks. I am withering without them."

"event","Took a nap. Had a dream I was robbed by a drunk mexican after I broke an axel on my car. I only have a vague idea of what an axel is, and a car probably can't function without it or something, but it was still going somehow, only with lumpy feeling driving. He took all the crap out of the back (including the three massive pink pieces of foam I currently have there) and my wallet. When I told him I couldn't go away unless the axel was fixed, he sighed and fixed it. Now I'm wondering why he didn't just take my keys and steal the car, too.

Spoke at a philosophy panel. Make a fool of myself, but it made my teacher happy and I faced the challenge. Good for me.

Went out with a bunch of guys to a sports grill's trivia night and ate mediocre food. Bought a lot of pointless things. A video game. 3 new sets of earrings. A clothes pattern. And I stole something. None of it made me feel much better.

I suppose I should pay more attention to these things. I'm glad I like my family for the most part.

And my digital rendering for theater class kicks much ass. 

This is mostly because my prof (good funny guy) is in charge of making the set and props for a Rocky Horror show down at Dad's Garage (theater place) in Atlanta and desperately needed some help getting things done. Being that one of my favorite hobbies is painting things at 2am in the morning, I fit in right nicely to the project. So for the last few nights I've been driving down to Atlanta (horror of horrors) and helping out making, painting, and dirtying things up. If I could do this for a living, I could be very happy. 

Not that having that sort of schedule doesn't take its toll...totally slept through philosophy yesterday. Well. You're only young once. And I got lost tonight coming home when I turned one street too early. I've sort of come to expect it out of me, and I really wasn't lost for that long. I was just glad nobody was around driving at that time of the night. And one way streets bloody suck. Other than that, I've been having a blast. And all the rip-off soda, pizza, and wood scraps I could ever want. Whee. And comp tickets. And a nice fat favor my prof owes me now. ^-^"

Putting off school work, once again. Well, there's always tomorrow. 

The bank screwed me over and charged a bunch of fees to my account that they weren't supposed to charge. Took forever for them to fix, and in the meantime, I got to be flat broke, even worse, in the red. Hungry hungry for something else besides ramen and canned peaches until today.

Nat got in to a car crash a few weeks back (the other guy's fault) and it mussed up her spine some, so she's been going to the chiropractor a lot lately to get it fixed. They do massages too, and relatively cheap ones, so as my reward for putting up with crappy food all week, I went with her today and got a massage. That was by far the most relaxed doctor's office I have ever been to. A redone old house, the doc was dressed in a short sleeved button up red shirt and jeans. Very nice guy.  I sat in on Nat's adjustment, which sounded really painful, but she said it didn't hurt at all. I found it so fascinating to watch, I decided to try it myself. Hey, 10 bucks student price, why not. She was right, it didn't hurt at all, and felt fantastic afterwards. The massage was one of those hurts so good things. Glad I got it, though, I feel much better now. The doc talked about how getting little things fixed now can make older life a hell of a lot easier, so why not. When he promised me a granola bar and couldn't find one, he invited us in to his office to partake of his lunch. ^-^ I got a pork dumpling, it was delicious. Everybody else was cutting out of work after we were done, so he just checked us out himself and asked how much he was supposed to be charging. I could have told him $20 flat and I'm fairly certain he would have just shrugged and taken it. Real good laid back guy.

Hist-American hist up to 1890. Have the same guy as last time, expect no great problems. 
Sci- switched out of Human anatomy after going to one class and deciding that continuing to go might just kill me. Am now in regular bio class with a woman prof who has a very fascinating accent. 
English- American literature survey. 4 tests constitute the entire grade. Personally, I kind of like that.
Philosophy-makes my brain hurt.

Roommate selection is much better this time around. Nat was always good, and now Kelly has joined us. Very tiny girl, being around the two of them makes me feel like a giant. Or a sea cow. But Kelly has a hamster named Tina. She's very cute and fuzzy. Kelly is perfectly all right as well.

"event","Back to work. Worked the middle school art camp, much more boring than I expected it to be. I spent the majority of the week sitting in a corner and listening to music while reading Don Quixote for class. Middle schoolers pretty much take care of themselves. I didn't much mind, in the end. Hell, you can pay me $350 a week anytime to sit around and do nothing. Only part that sucked was having to stay until 5 every day, then having to get myself to class on tuesday and thursday. No time to go grocery shopping...

Electricity went out on us at 5 in the morning to destroy all our alarms. Water cut off for a day. Air conditioner broke for four days. (That one was the worst. Good gods, it was boiling.) God bless university living conditions. 

Got my three wisdom teeth yanked out. I wake up at an ungodly hour, go to the office place, sit down, looking fantastic in my big black baggy drawstring pants and over sized Jump t-shirt (which I slept in), then the assistant guy sticks an IV in me, says 'don't worry, this doesn't have anything to knock you out in it.' Doc comes in about a minute later, look at the IV thing and says 'okay, this stuff comes on pretty quick, so just relax.' The assistant man LIED. I would have been upset with him, but I passed out right about then. My mother was upset I healed pretty quickly, she was expecting me to be home for at least 4 days. But I got happy fun pills out of the deal, so everything is a-okay. (They're even pink ^-^)

Worked my last art camp in general, too. No more work this summer. Never again will I have to hear that damn pirate play. ^-^

I destroyed our living room and my bathroom with my current art/craft sort of project. I didn't really hurt anything, I just got it really messy and really dusty. But I really do like making things with my hands, never mind the mess.  It's very fulfilling.

One more week of class.

I've gotten pretty use to the rhythm there by now, it marred by only one morning of me being late >.< Very my fault, not letting it happen again. I'm so happy I get to sleep in tomorrow.

Class isn't so bad either, though the bookstore has run out of the book I was supposed to buy...You'd think someone would be intelligent enough to order enough for the whole class, but no. When I went to class last thursday night, turns out I wasn't the only one who didn't/couldn't get the book, so between that, those who never speak anyways, and those who just forgot the book or got it and didn't actually read the thing, it ended up with only about a third of the class being able to participate while the rest of us scribbled in our notebooks and pretended. 

I went on a date last wednesday after two hours of prep work. (I looked fabulous, thank you very much.) We went out to a Japanese steak house called Hani House, and it was excellent. And they did the little onion volcano trick I find so damn amusing ^-^ A group of slightly red neckish people sat next to us, but they were good fun, and thought it was amazing that we could pick up rice successfully with chopsticks. Afterwords, we went and saw Batman Begins. A great movie, they did the story justice, though, good gods, long movie. 2 and a half hours, I believe. You try sitting there for that long in a short skirt. He brought me a book to borrow. And reminded me how girlie I can be when I try, for when he complimented my eyes, I giggled. Dear Lord, what is to become of me? And after I got home, he called to say good night. So sweet.

5)Children will do a lot just to get a small, plastic coin.

Spent $30 on ice cream and popsicles. And I'm glad I did. It made me feel good. And then later, it made me feel very, very sick. 

When to the dentist today. After years of berating me, according to them I've finally gotten with the program and am taking care of my teeth. Funny thing is, I really don't think I've changed anything, so I'm not entirely sure how that works. Oh well. My mother is insisting my teeth have moved because I never wore that damn retainer. She's right, I never did. It hurt like hell and I couldn't sleep with it, so screw it. My teeth had suffered enough. So now she's insisting I go get another one that fits. I really don't want to. The retainer would be for purely cosmetic purposes, not for bite or anything. I think they look fine, in all honesty. After telling the doc I wanted to look in to this whole thing he gave me a look and said 'Your mother suggested you get that, didn't she?' I said yes and he smirked. 'I figured.' He went to high school or college with my mother, so I'm not surprised he figured that one out. 

I really do with my mother would try to stop improving me. I'm out of the house, it's out of her hands. I also wish she would stop reading those self help books, but that's not going to happen. While we're at it, I also wish they would get a dog. I think it would be good for them. And I wish my mother would stop worrying about me giving platelets. She thinks my veins are going to collapse or something and when I really need an IV they aren't going to be able to do it or something. Gah. I love her, but Lord. I suppose improving and worrying are just what she does.  

Nat left for Italy, and called her mother when she got there and said it was beautiful. I believe her. 

Everybody has left the apartment but me. Mal went home for the summer, Laura disappeared months ago, and Nat is on another continent now. I've had some trouble filling the time alone. As in I've taken out all the garbage, washed evey dirty dish I had in my room, cleaned the kitchen floor, watered the plants every day and opened the window for them, completely scrubbed my sink and shower, and cleaned every piece of clothing I own. Everything is strangely clean around here. I usually don't mind solitude, but after having people around all the time all year...I am a little lonely.  I do not even have my cats to talk to. They are up in Athens with my sister, terrorizing a poor dog who does not know he is bigger than they are. 

Went to the Kessel's son's graduation party. We only stayed for an hour or so, and the graduation boy looked about as fun filled as I did at my party. When people asked what my major was, I gave up on trying to explain I didn't know what I wanted to do yet and just said English. That was obviously not the best choice, because everybody kept scoffing and saying I couldn't do anything with that and giving me stories about how their cousin/sister/nephew was an english major in college and is now working in an office/elementary school/bus depot. I'm just going to start saying I'm a genetics engineering major or something. That'll shut them up. Or at least make them say 'Oh, wow, that's nice' and move on to the next person.

I gave platelets last Saturday. Time 4 or 5 for me. Makes up for the rest of the bad karma stuff I do the rest of the month,  like commenting on Laura's boyfriend's ass. What can I say, he works out all the time. It's nice. Anyways, watched Boondock Saints while I sat there and the machine thing did its work. Movie finished right when I got done, which was nice. They got the damn needles out of my arms and I went and sat with David while Nat finished up. I was fine for about 5 minutes, then my vision started going away. I thought I just stood up too quick or something and sat back down, but it just...kept going away. You must understand that for someone who is already horribly blind to begin with, losing any more vision is really pretty scary. But brilliant me, I try to stand up and fall right back down to the floor. That was sufficient enough to freak Nat and David out pretty good. They get me over to a lounge type chair and make me eat about a dozen horrid tasting tums. They worked, though, and I was fine in a few minutes. The nurse made me give my car keys over to David and let him drive. I was a bit upset about that. But he did a good job. And I now have a large bruise on one arm where they fished around with the needle. May my mother never hear of any of this. 

Went to a Jump concert on Saturday as well with David, Mikey, and Nat, which was excellent. Purchased myself a t-shirt and my sister a CD. Nat still owes me money for her ticket. Only downer of the whole night was the old creepy lady wandering around on the street who asked us for change or a lighter about 15 times. Creepy. But the sexiness of the band members made it all worthwhile. Little pink guitar...*drool*.... 

Sin City is one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen. Seriously, it ranks pretty up there, with Battle Royal, even. 

Nat is sick. She went home right after finals, leaving only myself and Mallory in our apartment/dorm. It seems very quiet. I would go by and take her something nice to cheer her up, but I'm horribly afraid that I would get lost in her neighborhood. Every street is named the same thing. And I am horrific, I mean horrifically horrible with directions. So perhaps I will simply call her instead. 

My sister's birthday is the 10th. Everybody wish her a happy birthday. She's old. Happy old birthday.

Bought Anti-Grav for Playstation 2 at Target on a bit of a whim. Found it interesting that you could buy the game and the eye toy thing together for $50...But should you feel the need, right next to that package is just the eye toy, for the low low price of $45. Should go smack their packaging department. But it's a fun game, everybody looks rather stupid waving their arms and hands about, jumping up and down and cursing every 5 seconds or so. A tamer full body DDR is what I see it as. Had some fun with multiplayer mode with apartments mates, with play mostly consisting of one player attempting to shove the other out of the camera's view.  

Got up at the bloody crack of dawn to go sit outside the housing office to try and get a 2 bedroom apartment for next year. When they finally opened, they didn't have any anyways, but we still got a three bedroom and I was -incredibly-, -extraodinary- nice and let Natalie have the biggest bedroom. I swear, I got it on luck this year, we should have just let it go on luck again. She owes me a -horrifically- huge favor. Monstrous. But after we got done with that, we went to borrow something from a friend only to find him playing Halo 2 at 8:30 in the morning. Lord. Insane. Just sleep in and stay up later.

I bought a sewing machine. $100. A used Elna (who apparently was a famous quilter) with simple controls, though it's got everything I really need, plus a few things I'm fairly sure I'll never use, but hey, still nice they're there. I made Tai Tai with it and finished up Shira costumes. I think they both turned out rather well ^-^ ...Just about as good as they could, anyways, for me learning all this stuff on the fly. Although the lady who sold it to me at the store was very nice and gave me a lovely half hour lesson, which is good, because I didn't even know how to thread the thing right to begin with. Natalie plans to borrow and/or steal it sooner or later. Sleeves suck, by the way.

Bought a set of comics of Blade of the Immortal on ebay I'm looking very much forward to getting ^^ Yay 60 cents an issue!

Dropped by home to find my an IV pole thing in my parent's bedroom, along with a very interesting spread of medical stuff on the floor. Freaked me out for a few seconds until my mother explained that my father was trying some radical treatment for his sinuses. I'm a little baffled by it, so I just let it drop. I hate all hospitally things with a burning fiery passion. They greatly unnerve me.

Drove to Buckhead (that was interesting, given my complete lack of skills with directions...)  and got my hair done at Van Michael's by Jeremiah, a very fascinating man with lots of tattoos who took a year and a half at Kennesaw, dropped out, and became a hair cutter. He probably makes more money an hour than I ever will. 
An interesting note, I wore a pair of torn up paint covered jeans and a t-shirt to this place and failed to remember that there was a hole in the back of the jeans. Three guesses where it was exactly and the first two don't count.

History Since 1890- Good so far. Mostly assigns take home quizzes of which we all compare answers of right before class, though he doesn't much seem to care that we do. A few short papers, an open book final and I'm good. Funny teacher. Protested against the Vietnam war. Drives a Volvo. I'm betting he smoked a lot of pot in his day, but he's still a pretty smart guy. Likes it a lot when we try to argue him down on questions.
English Comp II- Same teacher as engl. comp I. All right guy, I guess. Class is half filled with high schoolers. They make me feel smarter than I really am several times a class. Originally meet two times a week, but the prof got tired of kids skipping, so now we just meet on Mondays. Brilliant. 
Sociology- My way late at night class, though I don't really mind that. A lot of the same concepts as Psychology, which I already took, so I'm doing pretty decently in there. 98 on the last test, rock. 
Badmittion/Archery- That's right. Bad mit was the first half of the semester, and while I'm not horrific at it, I'm most definitely not brilliant with the sport. 8 weeks o the stuff and I still look like a dork when I try to backhand the birdie thing. Oh well. Archery we start this Monday ^-^ I plan to get myself a cape and run around shooting people's tires. 
Bestsellers- (another English class, honors style) The bane of my existence. I hate this class. A teacher that makes me hella nervous, leaves too many damn comments on my papers, and is very plump and old. I swear I am the absolute youngest person in that class. Everybody else is old housewives with too much damn time on their hands. They keep talking about their kids, which I can't much connect to, for obvious reasons. I have to sit in there every Tuesday from 9:30 in the morning until 12:15 in the afternoon. I swear to heaven and Hell, just shoot me already. I might bleed and hurt for a while, sure, but at least then they'd eventually give me morphine and knock me out. 

Stole an Exit sign a few days ago with Ian with my wire cutters. Was amazed when it continued to glow despite having no to access to electricity anymore. But it's burnt out now. I plan to hang it over my door, when I get around to it. 

Had a big storm couple of night ago. Sheets of rain, hail the size of golf balls, thunder that shook the building, all sorts of old testament wrath good stuff. Knocked the power out for about an hour, used my back lit game boy advance to get around until we could find some candles. The GBA worked amazingly well for that purpose, I might add.    

God bless my mother and her gift with potatoes. Scalloped, twice baked, or sweet, the woman does amazing things. 

A trip for either tomorrow or Saturday is planned to Toys R Us. After being bombarded with various nerf arrows in the Page's basement, I decided I needed a nerf gun for the apartment/dorm. Natalie wholeheartedly agrees with me. 

My 19th birthday that occurred on the 18th of February, was nice and relaxed. My first 'nothing official happens' birthday in a while. (15th=permit, 16th=license <if one should choose to get this then> 17=legal R rated movies, 18th=voting, smoking,  lottery tickets, ect. 19=...jack squat.) Can't wait till next year. 20 should really be a hoot. 

Received-
a lovingly framed family picture from my sister (I requested that, since I don't really own one and thought I should...)
An IRiver mp3 player, color red. I love it long time.
A couple of checks and cash from various Uncles and grandfather
Coordinated bedsheets (the red roses! the red roses!)
A Japanese lunchbox
Donnie Darko, Directors cut (yay Nat) (with lovely hoodie wrapping of which I had to return to it's real owner)
Dogma, Special Edition (Yay k-channess ^-^) (with lovely card)
A black t-shirt proudly stating 'Fuck You' (From Seiji, in case you couldn't guess. ^-^)

...Think that's about it.

Oh, donated platelets (Time 4!) on the Sat after my birthday. Watched Pirates while that went on, breaking my streak of watching vampire movies and thus freaking the attending nurse people. My mother still thinks me insane for doing the donating thing, but I figure it helps balance out all the bad evily stuff I do the rest of the month.

Shira costume is officially done! Go me! Next up: Tai Tai. 

....Should I think of anything else, I will be sure to add it when it is not 4:30 in the morning."

"event","Well, I am in my dorm now. Yay. I like it very much, my bed is off the floor and everything now. I even got new bedding stuff, in a black and red theme, which I'm very fond of. (Found at Wal-Mart, amazingly. Go figure.) I can now watch television, be on my computer, and draw mindlessly in my sketchbook at the same time. Rotting my brain in 3 different ways at the same time: a personal best. All I have to do now is be drinking at the same time as all that to push it to the next level. :P 

Classes are all right. I'm figuring A's in most of my classes, (yes, even psyche) except for math. But it's math. So I'm perfectly all right with that. 

I might write more often here (maybe not, I'm sort of lazy) if I didn't have to write so many damn papers. My blasted honors intro class has me writing more than any other class I've ever had. I, for one, did not really see that one coming. And it's all reflections and non fiction, and blah. Things are so much easier when you can just make them up as you go along, aren't they? 

I've ignored most of my required reading in order to pursue slightly more interesting texts, such as the newest Blade of the Immortal manga (MOST EXCELLLENT) Dairy, by Chuck Palanick (I can't spell and or pronounce the man's last name for the life of me) and Running With Scissors, by Augusten Burroughs (made me appreciate my mother) All very amusing. 

Life goes on, and I'm about as happy as I've ever been. So there you go."

Fact #1: Parking sucks.
Fact #2: I can't read maps worth a flip. 
Fact #3: Textbooks are friggin' expensive. 

Not a bad day on Monday, really, it'll just take some getting used to. I'm dearly hoping when they GET MY DAMN DORM FINISHED things will improve a bit. At least I'll stop burning so much gas in my poor sugar plum car. 

Today, however, was most excellent. ^.^ Whee!

Shopping down at Buckhead was just fun, even if Stevie was the one spending all the money. ^-^() And I got a new t-shirt that I love much! I loves yous, k-chan! 

But heading home, going to drop him off, my favorite song on the CD we were listening to came on. Since it's Stevie's favorite on there too, he cranks it and we sing. We bellow and dance and abuse my poor speakers. Since we were almost to his neighborhood and the song wasn't done, I asked him during a pause where the road we were on went. Said he didn't know, so I just kept driving and we kept singing. A turn is made in to an empty, dead end residential street out of chance, and inspired by the music and the moment, I floored it just at the height of the song. And just as the song twitsed to a near close, we got to the end of the street, and I made a full turn around in the cul-de-sac, coming to a dead stop -just- as the last note sounded. 


Sometimes fate lets you have a moment. I'm glad I got this one."

So I did stuff, kept myself busy. I redid my closet, putting back up all the pictures I had taken down for references when I was drawing. Even put up some new stuff. Cleaned my room. Romped around with the cats. Did laundry. Even let the demon cat have a run around the whole house before I chased her back in to my room. Played DDR for a solid hour until my ankle went out and I ended up in a very ungraceful heap on the floor. 

Maybe it's there because I got all pissed at Ashlee because she's a complete slacker. That was the first time I've been truly mad at somebody in a while. But I didn't do anything, I just acted sort of testy for a while. Maybe I should have done something. I dunno. Prolly not that at all. 

I keep doing stuff, but I guess it's just not the right thing. I'll figure it out sooner or later.

Hmm..what is going on.. well tomorrow is mine and Justin's 6 month anniversary and that is pretty exciting.  It has been a wonderful 6 months and totally worth it..  Today I have to work on a project for Spanish about Costa Rica.  I am going to make a poster, and that will be fun and exciting.  Briana and I are going to Walmart later on to get the supplies!!  I also have to work on a story for political reporting which isn't TOO exciting, but I like to write.  I called KATV earlier and asked about their internships for the spring semester and they're sending me an application.  She said that they usually take however many apply so it shouldn't be that big of a deal since I am going to be a senior next semester.  I REALLY hope that pulls through.  Even if it doesnt I'm quitting my limited job and either becoming a bum or getting a job here.  I think I have a chance at the internship though.  Anyway..  I guess I should get started on school stuff.  BYE"

"event","Hello and Happy Election Day!!  I hope that everyone who feels that they should vote has voted, and I would also like to say that I respect those who didn't vote as well and hope that they remained safe today from the insane political crazies who tried to attack them.  Well tonight looks like its going to be a loooong night.  I have to go to the courthouse to watch the election returns as press and do a story about them.  The AR stuff should be done around 9:30 or 10, but I'm sure the presidential election will last well into the night.  I'm probably going to rest up for a few hours now, because I know it will be long, and it will definitely be boring.  Blah.. thats more than enough politics.  Ok well the rest of the day was good, went to Stobys.. weird things happened.  Two guys said that they just got in from Canada yesterday and were headed from Stobys to Baltimore.. We were thinking that they might have been intoxicated.  Well other than that nothing besides politics is going on.  Still loving Justin.. ;)  Almost halfway to the weekend! :)  lol I am pitiful.  Well good luck watching the election tonight!  BYEBYE!"

Then I beg of you
Just stop and consider
All she's gone through
Don't be quick to condemn her
For things she might say
Just remember
Life turned her that way

She's been walked on
And stepped on
So many times
And I hate to admit it
But the last footprint's mine
She was cryin when I met her
She cries harder today
So don't blame her
Life turned her that way

"event","it's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
without saying a word, you can light up the dark :)

actually you said just a couple words, but u made my day more than you have in a long time!  You amaze me.  No matter how down I get about anything, and no matter how much I think you won't be able to turn it around, you do.  And that amazes me.  Just a few little words gave me the most comfort ever and took every doubt and worry I had away.  Once again you amaze me.  You're a wonderful man, and I'm so glad that I took my chances, despite the odds.  You are my rock and always will be.  Even apart, I know you're there for me, and I know that you love me the same.  I love you and I will forever.

I did the health segment for the news.  It went pretty well, I think.

After that I went to the studio to help one of my tv production classmates on her show.  She's doing a dating game type show and we made the audition tape of some of the girls and guys that showed up to be on it.  I think that next Wed, we actually start the production of her show.  It should be pretty entertaining.  I worked a lot on my own show tonight.  I kinda did the script, and I did the story board and set design.. umm yeah that is boring stuff.  I also wrote a story for political reporting.  I was supposed to make some progress on my audio project.  The written version is due on Friday.  I have to make a commercial for a made-up project.  I didn't really get anything done on it today though.  Ummm tomorrow I have to work from 6-C, not too bad.  The next day I think that JUSTIN is coming over!!!  It's our 4 month anniversary and I think we'll get to hang out for a bit before he does his homework.  That'll be cool.  It's been since Saturday and I miss him and love him lots.

I had to go to class from 9 - 2:40 and that wasn't too bad I suppose, except my last 2 classes are so boring that I just want to explode.  However in spanish I got back my rough draft of my composition and I got an A-, and I was quite pleased with that.  I figured he would grade pretty hard, so I think that is good.  Ummm, I was involved in a racial debate in political reporting that just started from me voicing an opinion, but I do that all the time in there.  That is what she wants though and she said she gives bonus pts for it.  Anyways after class I had to go to a news meeting at 3, we were ""supposed"" to practice, but by 4:15, I hadn't read yet, so he just let us go.  SO pretty much I sat on a couch in the studio and did nothing for an hour, but I got credit.  After that I had to work 6 to close, and that wasn't too bad.  Pretty short hours.  Ummmmmm tomorrow will be long as well, I have to work from 4 to close.  But this was pretty boring and I had a long day.  But the weekend is just around the corner!!! :)"

Today I was SUPPOSED to have advanced reporting at 9:00, so I walked all the way over there in the freezing cold, and sat down at my regular computer.  At about 5 till, Mrs Debbie (the office lady in my department) came in and told me that I didn't have class today!!  So I was full of mixed emotions - glad that I didn't have class, but really upset b/c I had to make the cold walk right back home!!  Yesterday was a fun day.  We went to LR for a job interview for Briana, and whilst she was interviewing, I took it upon myself to go and shop till I dropped.  I only bought a little bit for me, the majority of my purchases were b-day gifts for kyle and jennifer.  She pulled me out of Victoria's Secret just in time, however.  :)  Well, speaking of the devil the situation w/ kyle is real weird.  I had a long talk w/ abby about it last night seeing as how she seems to be in the situation I will probably be in in about 5 months, and she told me that she STILL misses him after that long.  But, last night we hung out, and it was pretty fun actually.  I just wanted to spill my guts and beg him to take me back - but I didn't.  I wish I just hated him so that I didn't wanna be friends w/ him, but I don't hate him, by golly I love him.  But I'm sure I will forever no matter what happens, b/c it was a first love on both parts.  It just sucks when I think of the fact that he doesn't really love me.  But, anyways I think that we can be friends... I think.  But anyways I have to go and speak spanish to myself in the mirror now b/c I have an oral presentation today after class!!  BYEBYE! :)"

"event","Hey! Today is Thursday which means tomorrow is Friday!! Yippee.. no school and I get to go home.  It's gonna be great.  I get to go shopping on Saturday, maybe Friday with my mom.  And Saturday night I get to hang out with my brother.  That'll be cool.  This morning in TV1 we got to go out and just take some shots in groups.  It was real fun, and I felt quite intelligent, b/c I felt as though I knew what I was doing the whole time and I helped the other group members a lot! :) It was cool.  We get to watch them on Tuesday and see how we did.  Next I get to go to Broadcasting Management! :(  No fun.. that is such a boring class, if you can't already tell by the name.  I haven't even cracked the book.  Well, I think I'm going to watch a lil bit of Full House before class!!  Have a great day!! BYE! :)"

"event","Hello!!  It's in between class time so I thought I would update my journal.  This morning I had advanced reporting.  I really love that class, my adviser is my teacher so I already know that she likes me.  She's a real fun lady.  At 11 I have Spanish II, and today we are discussing the chapter that I have been waiting for since I started the program:  LA COMIDA.. FOOD!!  I just love learning that stuff! :)  I learned how to say shrimp:  los camarones!! hehe.. Anypoo today I have to go and film for a package at the volunteer fair.  I was going to be reporter but since my flat iron broker, I cannot achieve the perfect ""reporter do"" so Betsy is going to do it.  That means I get the harder job, though.  Hopefully I'll be able to white balance a lot better than I did at my last attempt this semester.  Anyways that is at 1:30, then a workshop at 3:00.. then.. nothing!  I don't even think I have any homework tonight!  Life's tough, huh?  I imagine the semester will get much harder, however.  Anyways, my mom is talking to me yahoo so I guess I should end this!!  LEAVE ME A COMMENT!!! :) Bye!

P.S.  IT IS COLD OUTSIDE... BUNDLE UP!!"

"event","Hi!! It's been a long time since I've posted, and I have nothing else to do, so I thought I would.  I had a pretty good weekend, I guess.  Just worked everyday.  I'm looking forward to this week b/c I really don't have too much to do and that will be a nice change.  I'm REALLY looking forward to this weekend, b/c after a month of being here I finally am getting a chance to go home.  I'm not really homesick, I just think it'll be real nice to be home for a change.  I'll feel MUCH cleaner! :)  Today is going to be a really fun day!  Briana is going to Park Plaza to apply for a job at some of the stores, which means I will follow behind purchasing many cute items! :)  Cute items that I cannot afford, at that.  It's a disease.  Anyway, I believe that will be great fun.  I get to go to Spanish II in just a little bit and re-write a composition about my daily routine if I lived on a tropical island - exciting, huh?  Well, I think I'm going to watch a bit of TV before I go and learn!!  Hasta pronto! :)  Adios."

It is quite fun being Briana's roommate.  She is being weird right now.. in a funny way   :) ""like oh my god you're hot"" that is what she said Zach said.. weirdo  hehe.

I think everyone had a lot of fun, and I was so glad that Briana actually came.  I think she had a good time ;)  Umm today I'm not doing anything.  Just eating some food and hanging out with my family.  I know Briana had mentioned something about spending some time w/ me today, so I was going to see if she had wanted to come over.  I called her a few minutes ago but she quickly and mysteriously had to go....  Anywho, maybe we can get together later.  Well, I have to go back to Conway on Saturday, that's two days.  I kind of want to go back, but I kind of don't.  It's kind of sad, but this will probably be the last time I'll ever spend 2 weeks in a row in Hope, because it will no longer be my residence after this summer.  But, anyways, y'all have a great day!  BYE!"

I get to go back to work on Saturday, oh joy, and start school next Thursday, double joy.  News Years Eve is umm tomorrow wow.. I have to make some kinda plans today.  I'm sure I'll just invite lots of peeps over to watch movies and shoot fireworks and eat and stuff and that should be plenty fun.  Briana is OLD!  Weird, I will be a teenager and she will be an old hag.. i mean nice lady :)  Well today I really don't know what I'm going to do.  I am up and ready this early, so I'll probably have a long day of nothing.  I need to go and exchange a present and the mall so I might be doing that today, who knows.  Anyways, everyone have a wonderful super day and I will write again soon."

I've had a GREAT time getting back together with all of my friends and family now that I am back home for a little bit.  I got all sorts of awesome clothes and stuff for Christmas and I had a great time giving presents to everyone else.  I've done quite a lot of stuff since I last updated, but I don't think anything too exciting to describe.  I can't find Briana Wagley!  Where you is?  I would like to eat some pizza with you this evening but you are no where to be found.  Anyways, I'm going to Mema's house tomorrow.  I'm pretty excited, I haven't been there in a while.  She got a computer and the internet for Christmas so I'll be reachable at that time.  I'll be back in Hope on Monday for fun and games with all of my friends.  Anyways, I'll try to remember to update this weekend.  Bye bye and HAPPY KWANZAA!!  - aww briana cannot play i am sad"

But, I've been so busy this week this is the first chance I have gotten to actually use it, and I can't really be on it very long b/c I have to go set up some Christmas things in a minute.  Well, anywho, my week was really good.  I worked all day Thursday, Friday, and today.  On Friday, Jennifer and I went to the movies and saw Mona Lisa Smile.  It was really, really good.  I suggest it.  This Wednesday, Kyle came and visited!! :)  We had a good time, except for we got lost in North Little Rock trying to find his mom, but we found our way back.  I'm going back to Hope tomorrow morning (yippee), and will be staying there until January 3, I think.  And, Cynthia Briana Wagley, when are you going to be registering for your classes?  I have been wanting to call you and ask you about it for the past two days but by the time I pick up the phone it's like 1:30 am or something and I don't want to wake you.  Perhaps I will call you this evening :)  Anyways, this is my life in the past week.  Well, a really really condensed version.  I'm sure you'll hear all about it when I get home.

I just really don't want to go back.  I don't want to leave my mommy or Brianie :(  I will leave Kyle because he is mean, but oh well.  Did you like my comment in which I left you, Briana?  (itchy itchy wee wee)  I thought it was very funny.  Anyways, I ate at Cherry's today.  It was quite delicioso, and I get to go back home and sit and stare at the tv for the rest of the day.  I need to save mi minutos, BUT i'll probably end up giving in and calling Briana out of boredom.

I was in a wonderful mood all weekend, even when I had to work ALL day EVERY day, just b/c of no more school, especially no more gaughan's world lit! :)  Well today I am going to go over to my cousin's house to play for a little while.  Then, tonight I'm hanging w/ Briana and we are going to eat at Little B's YUM!  I'm excited!  I like spending time w/ her, and she better be living with me in Conway next year or I will be :(.

However, I am going to Hope on Saturday night so I will be available for a little bit this weekend.  :)  Well, my two finals today went alright.  I'm glad that I am almost finished.. only ONE MORE TEST!!!  And today I got cut from work so I had more time to.. not.. study, but anyways that made me pretty happy.

I got up at 6:00 today so I would have enough time to study a little more and get ready for m 8:00 test.  You know, I haven't been up this early in quite some time.  I gave up on 8:00 classes last year.  Anyways, at 8:00 I have my Media Theory exam, which I really should be studying for right this second, and at 11:00 I have my Spanish exam, which I'm pretty sure I really don't need to study for, but I will later.  Then I get to go to work from 5-8 all day and when I'm home I will be memorizing information for my American Nations test that is at 8:00 tomorrow.  Whew.  Yesterday was a good day.  I got a LOT accomplished, which was the goal of the day.  It was fun having supper at Jennifer's house.  I get to move i there on Thursday morning, which is tomorrow..  I really should start packing.  It'll be a pretty fun time.  I'm just ready to have a roommate again.  Anyways, I have to go and dry my hair and then try to memorize fifty thousand theories about mass media!!  Bye."

I have a world lit test today at 11, which will not be hard but I already know I will make a B and have a B in the class.. oh well!  But we are studying for it at 9:30 in my room today.  So, I had to get up early and clean so Jennifer won't come in here and look around and say.. uhh what happened in here?  So that's what I am doing.  Yesterday my telecomm class went fine, and I worked from 5-8 which is an awesome shift.  It went by so quickly, but I barely got paid very much.  Anywho, I did even MORE Christmas shopping yesterday, and all I have left to buy is a present for my bro.  Yay me.  I guess working at the mall is a good thing this time of year.  Anywho, I gotta go clean myself and clean my room before the peeps get here for some hardcore studying of a book about hell.. YIPPEE! hehe.  BRIANA IS THE COOLEST GIRL EVER!  byebye."

"event","do you ever get the feeling that some people are just super into themselves and couldn't care less about you unless it involves them.. some people will sit and hear you, but never really listen, only waiting for the next chance for them to talk. 

and i really don't like it when people watch my movies without asking.. is that wrong? my movies are important to me... an ex boyfriend told me once ""you watch your movies because you're unhappy with your own life, therefore you live vicariously through the characters' lives."" maybe he's just an asshole, or maybe it's true.. i'm in such a bitter mood right now, i just want my throat to feel better and my nose to stop throbbing.. i just want someone who cares about me to come pet my head."

"event","I did make an ass of myself last night. vodka is my belligerent drink. well at least i apologized in advance to everyone who was with me. 

I hate to be surrounded by drama. and i hate that i found a used condom on my kitchen counter from my roommates escapade last night. not only did she leave it for me to see, but the fact that i am so lonely and it seems like everyone around me has someone, it just tops the cake when i have it thrown in my face. (but it was kind of funny to have the mom of another room mate come in to find it) I have decided that i am revirginizing myself, yeah i know its impossible, and its not like i've ever been slutty to the point where i've had a one night stand, nor have i really had sex with that many guys, but it's gotten to the point where sex isn't as special to me, therefore, i am a newly dubbed virgin. i refuse to have sex with anyone unless i love them. and they love me. there, i said it.

i wonder if i really will marry someone who's like my dad. 
i wonder if that boy will ever call me again. or if i really care all that much if he does or not. 

the ex came into my work yesterday. my heart stopped a little bit. i do miss him, but i miss the kid he used to be. i think about how close we were before, how we were each other's everything. now when i see him, i look into his eyes and i don't see that person anymore. then i want to sit down and cry. i'm not really sure if i can handle another relationship like that, with anyone. that scares me even more. the fact that i'm so worn down and i carry so much baggage whenever i'm seeing someone new that i eventually destroy whatever ""could have been"".  maybe i'm destined to be a cat lady. but i'm allergic. god would do that."

"event","i don't really remember last night, not that i did anything bad, but i really hate getting to that point. my roommate had a 31 year old man spend the night.. i wonder if thats creepy to anyone else? considering she's 19.. he was walking around my apartment in boxers this morning.. even creepier.. i mean, he was born in 1974! thats like, two years before the bicentenial.

     i woke up still a little intoxicated this morning, thats never happened to me before.. but i suppose thats what happens when you drink an x number of shots while watching the creepiest movie ever.. i.e. willow.

     i miss my friends from home, i hate that i'm basically the only one that stayed close to home when leaving for college. i wonder what it feels like to be far away from home and not being able to just hope on a train for 15 minutes and be back to just do laundry, or have dinner with family. 
 
   i hope i didn't make an ass of myself last night. i will have to ask.. when i go back to get my cell phone.. and any other belongings i may have left in 125."

"event","why does everyone feel like they have a say in my life and they think its necessary to tell me what to do and not to do. i know i'm shy, but that doesn't mean i'm a little kid. everyone looks at me and just thinks, ""aw.. shes so cute"" and not cute in a complimentary way, cute in the derogatory, mean way that puts me down and makes me feel like no one will ever take me seriously. maybe if i get a million tattoos all over and shave my head people will take me more seriously.. or they'll just commit me into an asylum... most likely the asylum.. 
 i hate to be one of those girls, but i really want a boyfriend. i'm sick of randomness, i want something real. thats been my theme of this year so far, reality i guess.. thats why i haven't been drinking that much. i just want as many of my experiences as possible to have real feeling behind it. I can't even count the amount of friends i've made while i've been drunk and no names will be remembered.. its a little sad.. also pretty funny. oh well. rambling can only go so far."

"event","college is very different than i thought it was going to be. i've always believed that i haven't had the same college mindset as other people, but thats because i've been judging people before genuinely knowing them. i promise to stop doing that. people still surprise me.. that makes me smile. 
   i still can't comprehend why intelligent people who are genuine, real, and unbelievable get stuck into relationships with those who are selfish, and full of themselves.. some day people will realize that its not always about the way someone looks.. i'm lying.. that will never happen.. i'm so sick of everyone around me being hurt by people who don't even deserve their company.. i'm too positive.. i need to become more of an asshole. goodnight."

"event","so this is my first entry... i'm not really sure what to say. i never really thought i would write in one of these, mostly because i don't think many people would actually want to read it. BUT anything is worth a try. I'm still a little intimidated by this, so maybe next time i will write a real entry and stop bullshitting so much."

"event","A couple a days ago my little brother got this toy, and it came with a flag. He was playing with it in my room and like he was being mean so i threw them out of my room and when he went looking for them he was saying ""Where's my flag?"" Only to Regina and me it sounded like he was saying 'fag'. So we both start laughing. ANYWAYS when I was at Wal-Mart today with my mom, Ray, and Regina; my mom goes ""Hey Reece, whats that thing right there?"" (pointing to a flag that was on the top of the Wal-Mart building) and Reece says, ""Its a big fag!"" 
<b>YEAH THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY.</b>

   Today Regina and I went to the Mexican Resturant to go get some food because we had none at home. When we get there i order TWO <b>BEAN</b>, CHEESE, and RICE BURRITOS. Then after having to walk there and now walking back to come home to some good food, we open the bag to find TWO <b>BEEF</b>, and RICE BURRITOS. I asked my dad nicely to take me back and he complains about it but finaly does. So when I walk back into the resturant I go to the counter (already really mad) and then this other girl walks in <i>after me</i> and the lady knew her so she started talking to her, then after 5 min she FINALY gets around to me and I tell her the mistake she made and she didn't even say sorry. RUDE! And while I was waiting I was looking to see how mich it would cost for what I really wanted and it was cheaper then the price she made me pay, and i didn't get any money back. Then I go home and we eat and the food is CRAP, seriously. I swear i'm never going there agian!
<b>YEAH THAT WAS SOME MAD COMPLAINING OF MINE.</b>"

"event","So lately i've been thinking about almost everything and i come to seem like i'm losing at life, which makes me think:
-where did i go wrong? 
-what direction should i be going in? 
and these questions make me want to do something with life, something huge so when i do die i can't say i wasted my life."

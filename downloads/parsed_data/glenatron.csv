"event","On Thursday I posted episode twelve of our podcast <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/crudely-drawn-swords"">Crudely Drawn Swords</a> and it is going pretty well so far. We've now got a handle on the game we're playing and I feel as though we've managed to create a fun balance between ridiculous antics and grand adventure. 

The great thing is that we've got a lot of really good feedback, people who aren't familiar with this style of podcast are surprised how enjoyable it is listening to other people playing a game. People who have listened to a few Actual Play shows think we're up to standard - obviously I am biased, but I would say we're as good as any I've heard, with the exception of <a href=""http://friendsatthetable.net/"">Friends At The Table</a> which transcends game podcasting altogether to just be the best thing one could possibly listen to. We're not there yet, but its nice to have a target. When I'm editing I often find myself crying with laughter at the quality of the ridiculousness on display. It turns out that the theory that if you have a collection of sufficiently funny and imaginative people that matters more than the structure they are working in, is pretty much right. So far a little over 500 people have listened to episode one and although that trails off somewhat, in the next couple of days we'll top 2000 total listens. That is approximately two thousand hours of our antics being listened to. 

I have had to teach myself to process and edit voice recordings, to arrange strings and use linux midi tools ( which I've got better at as we've gone on, so I'll probably have to revisit the original theme ) in addition to getting better at running the game. As you might expect, hearing every word you say repeatedly is a good way to refine your storytelling and to pick up on every irritating mannerism.

So if you haven't given it a listen yet, I can confidently say that the first season will reward you, but if you want a more competent jumping-on point Season 2 will start in a couple of weeks. You can listen <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/crudely-drawn-swords"">on Soundcloud</a> or just search for ""Crudely Drawn Swords"" on iTunes or your podcast client of choice and we should turn up. The only proviso is that it's perhaps a little bit sweary and disreputable for the kids. That aside, it is our attempt to bring joy to everyone."

"event","This weekend has been another clinic with <a href=""http://californiabridlehorse.com/"">Jeff Sanders</a>, which has been pretty amazing. The thing about Jeff is that he builds you up from the start towards work that is at least equivalent to high school, and talks about it like it is just bread and butter riding. And the thing is, that to him it really is. That is a pretty inspiring environment to be working in - admittedly most of what we were actually working on was shoulder in/out ( mostly on four-tracks, like Gueriniere intended ), travers, renvers and then working onto half-pass and rollbacks. Everything is working towards flexibility and collection and also towards subtle riding - Jeff characterised me at the last clinic as suffering from ""hand tourettes"" and I've been working on trying to do less with my hands, which is paying off gradually but I still need to do less. 

Jeff is very big on working in the bosal and Iris never seemed to like that, shaking her head and losing focus when wearing it, so I have barely used it. Jeff was suggesting that it might be easier to move forward with that than the snaffle - he doesn't use a snaffle bit at all with most horses - and I was keen to try so we spent our session this afternoon trying to get her more used to it. Jeff looked at how she responded, retied my mecate so there was a bit more length on the knot end and it wasn't tickling her chin. With this done Iris was quite happy with it, which is pretty great and I don't know if it would ever have occurred to me that this was the problem. So maybe Iris will make it as a hackamore horse after all.

Just like last time, I feel very inspired and immensely proud of my horse who was exemplary throughout. Iris is teaching me so much and with the expert guidance of brilliant human teachers it feels like we could achieve anything*.

"event","Obviously the next thing that happened was that I got hit by what was probably this winter's flu and spent two days in bed unable to move, which was tiresome and painful. This morning I woke up and the fever seems to have broken so I'm mostly just contending with the mother of all sore throats. It's not great, but it's better than I have been.

While my brain was cooking with fever it was trying to create a weird conflation of magic and data processing where it could file away aspects of things to create... something? So a person or their place in a story would be defined by a the way these aspects were slotted together. This was also to do with magic and also a literal filing system, one of which probably comes from watching <em>Once Upon A Time</em> with <lj user=herecirm> and the other from... I don't actually know. But every time I closed my eyes for the last two days my brain was back to obsessively filing aspects or deriving them or creating them and putting them in their drawers so I thought I'd note it down. Maybe I'll have a use for this information later, or maybe I'll just look back on it and think ""oh yeah, brains are <em>weird</em> when you cook them."""

This is the last day of my thirties and I have to say, I have come out of it richer than I went into it. Chatting with one of my colleagues about this I realised I have been a ninja, a cowboy, a rock guitarist and a wizard in the last ten years. So at the very least my twelve-year-old self could be well content with my achievements. 

I have also been divorced, found true love, travelled to the far side of the world, made new friends, played interesting music and enjoyed a lot of fine stories along the way. 

I am taking the next few days off work and plan to dedicate them to a) not putting any pressure on myself of any kind and b) deciding what I'm going to do with the next part of my life. Obviously in a way where I ensure that <i>b</i> doesn't conflict with <i>a</i> there. We'll see how that works out. Either way, I have a <lj user=herecirm> with me now, which makes everything better, and she's taking time out from work as well, so whatever we do will be together."

"event","Perhaps slightly less than six years ago, after some kind of conversation that might have taken place on LiveJournal I made an exchange agreement with <lj user=""skiesfirepaved""> ( who you might know better as <lj user=""herecirm""> these days ) where we each agreed to send one another a playlist of songs. Both being music obsessives of different - but related - streaks, this seemed like a great way to hear some interesting songs and if I am open in my feelings now in a way I wasn't then, I can certainly say that I wanted to get to know her better. I listened to the music she sent me a lot and it made me very happy. Happier than I had been in a long time. Today I was reminded of one of the songs that I sent to her, which comes from one of my favourite albums by one of my favourite songwriters. It is fair to say that the chorus of this with its ""you don't know how precious you are"" may have carried a hint of the future about it then, but still rings true now. No matter how absolutely I express how much I treasure her, it feels like no more than a drop in the ocean.

"event","I am terribly close to being forty, my friends. Not quite yogurt-in-the-fridge close yet, but within a week or two I will be.

I don't know if this is related to having an idea of turning my life upside-down, but it may not be unrelated. I think the other part was some of the inspiration I got from riding with Jeff Sanders in December, which really got me thinking about where I want to go with my horsemanship and with my life if I am not to spend my last days looking back on what I might have done if I had only applied myself a little more.

One thing I discovered, whilst having these thoughts, was that <a href=""http://courses.aber.ac.uk/postgraduate/equine-science-masters/"">this course exists</a> and that if I wanted to do a taught postgraduate equine course in this country it is about my only option. The idea got its hooks in me and after speaking with the member of staff who looks after it, we decided to go and visit Aberystwyth and see what we thought of the place. 

The first thing I noticed is that it is far away - even if not far in distance it is not quick travelling, once you get away from the south coast of Wales there aren't any dual carriageways and even if Google hadn't sent us down a dramatic single-track road through the mountains ( THANKS GOOGLE ) instead of on the relatively broad and easy A-road, it would have taken a long time to get from Newport to Aber. 

We visited the University and I got a guided tour showing some of the facilities and talking through what the course consists of and whether I would be suitable for it. There is a lot of biology there- if you look at the course modules through that link, you'll see that a lot of it relates to fairly low level function and I would have to really up my game in that respect. I planned to study biology when I left sixth-form college but I realised at the last moment that I wouldn't enjoy it so I changed my course to philosophy. At that time I didn't have enough passion to balance out the parts I found boring, but I think horses have stoked that fire sufficiently that I would be able to push through and at the end of it I would have a much more comprehensive understanding of equines and how they work. Of course my real and deep interest is behavioural, but that is also the part I have the strongest grasp of and I think it would really be a case of bringing the rest of my knowledge up to that standard.

I would also come out with a lot of contacts around the industry and a good qualification from a well regarded university as a basis for moving from a profitable career with computers to an almost-certainly less profitable but more rewarding career with horses.

Aberystwyth itself is a nice town and I could see us being happy there- Sari and I have talked of relocating to Wales often and I expect it will happen sooner or later - but I did feel the distance from home. That said I live less than four miles from my parents now and I might well see them more if we were on the far side of the country just because I am bad at dropping by and visiting with people and my time is always full.

It would have been easy if the course overview had either been completely offputting or fired me up entirely, but of course life is seldom that simple ( and I am very rarely fired up entirely for any reason these days ) so I still have a decision to make.

It is really a two-part decision, maybe three-part:
1. Do I want to change everything, move elsewhere and begin a different kind of life?
2. If so, do I want to do it by enrolling on an MSc, moving to mid Wales and spending two years studying there?
3. If so, what do I plan to do at the end of it? Or do I just keep my eyes out for opportunity and see what the things I learn and the people I meet can take me towards?

There is also a diverging path - if I want to change my life, is this course the right way to do it? Could I move into a different direction- spend the money and time on learning in another way, work towards another qualification or move in a more entrepreneurial direction? 

It is good to have so many opportunities, but it is also daunting and hard to know which direction to go. I'd be interested to hear from any of you who has done a course like this- or just gone back to university as a middle-aged mature student - how you feel it worked out."

"event","It has already been a bitter year for iconic heroes of the arts and it has left me thinking a lot about the music I grew up with.

I was never a great Bowie fan- I only own a couple of ""best-of"" albums - but I grew up listening to bands who grew up on Bowie. His influence was absolutely pervasive. It is also undeniable that he was responsible for some of the greatest pop songs ever recorded - I cannot think of any song that could get close to <i>Life On Mars</i> as a contender for greatest pop song ever. He had a brilliance for tunes, a great voice that showed us that one could sing rock with an English accent and a knack for finding amazing musicians to collaborate with throughout his career. That's without even thinking about his impact on fashion, art, cinema, video games - he was an explosion of ideas that touched every part of our culture, particularly in the early seventies when ( by all accounts ) we <i>really</i> needed it.

The other thing is that he was able to do this because of when he was alive. He was, as his friend sang, a twentieth century boy and his art defined the last third of the century. David Bowie lived at the only time that he could possibly have been David Bowie.

Now that he is gone, we have not only lost his bright light in the world, we are also seeing the passing of that age. The music I grew up with was powerful, but it was on the cusp, becoming a reflection of what had gone before - Zeppelin and Sabbath powered the Grunge scene, The Kinks, the Beatles and Bowie were fossil fuel that Britpop burned. As the nineties ended bands were looking back to New Wave and the early eighties followed by an interminable eighties revival which may be petering out at last- I didn't really listen to eighties music at the time and when I did get into music it felt like that was everything the music I enjoyed was a reaction against, so I never came to like it. 

The feeling I get now is that music is recycling. The best modern artists are creating music that is heavy with references to the past, that looks backwards rather than forwards. It is hard to be clear about this because music has been inextricably wound into my life and I have gradually gained context as time has gone by so I can see more than I ever did, but it feels to me as though pop ( in which I include all it's genres and subgenres ) has simply run out of places to go. I couldn't say when that boundary was crossed - probably the last truly new sound to appear was that of electronic dance music and the way that started to cross over into rock around the time of Madchester. Since then - which encompasses the entire part of my life when I have cared about music - there have only been iterative changes. Different tunes, different arrangments. Play a little slower and it's a new subgenre, play it a little faster and it's a new subgenre, but nothing that feels different and new.

Technology has changed us- we can now make any sound that can be imagined, but it turns out that only a few sounds actually appeal to our ears. We're still playing the same scales, the same twelve semitones, the same three or four beat rhythms.

David Bowie worked in the brief period when music was available to everybody, but in order to listen to it someone had to pay for it- whether it was you or the radio station you were listening to. Now music can be propagated endlessly at effectively no cost, something which has been strongly pushed for by the network providers who spend a lot on lobbying against copyright. The idea that it should be given away for free is deeply embedded in the generations who grew up with the internet and that means that it is now exceedingly hard to make a living as a musician and almost impossible to become rich as one. With a diminishing pool of people who can afford to be professional musicians there will be less room for invention and exploration. Bands don't have a shelf-life in the way that they once did - record labels can't afford to finance a career so you get an album, maybe two or three and you're done. The opportunities to grow and change within the music industry are far more limited.

A consequence of this is that the people who pay for music are my generation and older and we get more backward looking music because we are already past our prime and looking for things that comfort us and remind us of when we were young and responsibility-free. Consequently the greatly reduced finances in the music industry go to encourage backward-looking music. If you wanted to make forward-looking music you would need to be appealing to a generation who don't see a need to pay for it and making any kind of living from doing that would be challenging at best. You'd be better off doing lets-plays.

I suppose I don't have a strong point to make here, except that pop music is rapidly becoming ( or has become? ) a legacy genre and that it leaves me wondering whether the all-consuming passion for music that I experienced will be far less available for young people in the future and whether that even matters. I don't see where music has left to go. Of course as a middle-aged white man I'm not <i>supposed</i> to know what the future of music is, perhaps it is already happening in sweaty clubs across the cities of Britain, or Mali or Indonesia. Still it is sad to see that the great beast music, who carried us so far in my lifetime, is emaciated, stumbling and losing its pace. A time will come when there is nothing but the empty plain where those of us who recall it can look back across its bones and listen to the whispers of its legacy. Humans have always needed music and I think we always will, it speaks to us in a very fundamental way. But I think the great flowering of recorded popular music is over. When I was young, jazz was old people's music- it belonged to my granny's generation. As I get older, I realise that pop is going the same way, but I can't see anything on the horizon of the rock and roll that will overwhelm it and take its place. 

David Bowie is dead, popular music is slowly wasting away and it feels like that is the passing of the age that I belong to as well."

"event","A few years back I got a new phone which, unlike it's predecessor, did not pack with a built in radio. Consequently I needed to find something else to listen to and I ended up listening to a bunch of podcasts. Being a massive geek, some of the ones that appealed to me most were just people sitting in a room playing tabletop games - I really enjoy the combination of humour and storytelling, the way that a roll of the dice or a random comment can totally change the direction of the narrative. My favourites so far have been <a href=""http://majorspoilers.com/category/critical-hit/"">Critical Hit</a> and more recently the truly brilliant <a href=""http://friendsatthetable.net/"">Friends at the Table</a> which hits all the right spots for me. Over the last few years I have listened to a lot of dice rolls.

Of course, being one of nature's original copyists, I couldn't just leave it at that so, taking the path of least resistance, I got together with a bunch of my most ridiculous friends and we set about recording something along the same lines. As we have a few episodes ready to go, I figured that New Years Day 2016 was as good a place as any to start publishing them, so if you want to hear our adventures begin, they are here: <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/crudely-drawn-swords"">Crudely Drawn Swords</a> or if you have an RSS client ( as most podcast clients are ) there is an <a href=""http://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:196669918/sounds.rss"">RSS feed</a>. We should be popping up on ITunes soon too.

It's quite silly, a bit sweary ( because we have <lj user=""doveston""> on our team ) and I think it works pretty well. Given that it's something pointless that we're giving away for free, I'm surprisingly proud of it."

<ul><li>Due to some obscure federal regulation, every motel room must have at least one switch that has no discernable effect on the state of the world. It is considered good practice to have two or more.</li><li>For extra points this should be the switch beside the door that would - in a normal world - switch on some kind of room light when you get in. If this switch <i>is</i> associated with a light, it should be somewhere obscure like the bathroom, or inside the wardrobe, casting as little useful light as possible.</li><li>If there is one thing motel customers hate it is being able to see, consequently motels refuse to have any ceiling lights, instead choosing to offer a selection of oddly positioned lamps.</li><li>Although a motel must place multiple lamps in any given room, it is considered good practice to have as many different types and positions of switch on them as possible. A motel proprietor whose rooms have no two lights operating off the same switch is considered a true master of their trade.</li><li>Every room needs to have one component that is inordinately loud, ideally the fridge or the heater.</li><li>The showers everywhere have exactly the same control system and you can step right in and know how it works, this is something that the UK could really learn from.</li><li>If the shower is on a bath, regardless of the care with which the curtain is utilised, at least five gallons of water must somehow find their way onto the floor per shower.</li><li>A square pillow provides motel customers with an entertaining puzzle while at the same time preventing them from engaging in egregious activities such as sleep.

"event","There are relatively few horse trainers I am interested in learning from that I haven't ridden with by this point, but until this autumn Harry Whitney topped that list. I was first introduced to him by reading some of <a href=""http://www.tommoates.com/"">Tom Moates'</a> articles in Eclectic Horseman and later his books about learning with Harry, which are well worth reading. At the same time I was reading <a href=""http://goodhorsemanship.com.au"">Ross Jacobs'</a> work and that also referenced Harry on a fairly routine basis. Sari and I rode with Ross in Australia <a href=""http://glenatron.livejournal.com/tag/australia"">a few years back</a> and he strongly recommended that we visit with Harry if possible. Last winter was supposed to be the last time Harry was teaching at his place in Arizona, but ( luckily for us ) the sale they had lined up fell through and he is teaching there for one more season. As we have worked hard this year I thought we qualified for a bit of travel.

Consequently we found ourselves with a five day clinic at Harry's gorgeous Arizona set-up with some charming borrowed horses for us to ride and a couple of mules taking part as well. An excellent proposition.

If you want an introduction to Harry's approach, which looks more similar to what other trainers do than it is, you could read <a href=""http://www.harrywhitney.com/assets/tommoateseharticle.pdf"">this article on round pen work</a> (pdf) and <a href=""http://www.eclectic-horseman.com/mercantile/index.php?manufacturers_id=41"">this book</a>. In essence Harry's work starts from a single point- learning to direct the horse's thought. When you are directing the horse's mind rather than their body, there is no resistance and they will work as well as they possibly can. Most problems we run into come from trying to make the horse physically do something rather than asking them to act mentally. 

<lj-cut text=""Day-by-day write-up. Illustrated, of course"">
<img src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/565/23013924682_e9565b52b8_b.jpg"" />
<h4>Day 1</h4>
On day one, most people started by turning their horses loose in the round pen and doing a bit of work on catching and holding their attention in this environment. This is not a case of driving them around the pen ( something that is very common in certain schools of horsemanship ) but in using a bit of noise or energy to draw their attention to us so that they could find comfort in being with us rather than focussing on their concerns about the surroundings or the whereabouts of their buddies. 

This brought out some points around effectiveness- the importance of being briefly effective rather than begging ( I don't believe there has ever been a clinic where I didn't get picked up on this ) and Harry pointed out that it would be better that the horse get scared and run a while than spend time practicing ignoring us begging. The important thing is to insist on the horse being present, to make it their responsibility to stay with us, rather than constantly asking them to be with us. This is the same thing I do with a horse who wants to graze the whole time, but for some reason I have only made the connection that this can be generalised as I write this.

<img src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5664/23013923282_ca8fefab73_b.jpg"" />

Harry observed that when a horse doesn't feel good about the work they are doing everything else becomes super-interesting to them. This reflects clearly on my experience with Iris.

Most of the work was closely associated with developing focus, a term I have only this minute connected to it's conventional photographic meaning, which is important. I asked Harry about the use of frequent changes of direction to keep a horse's attention and he observed that you can use it that way, but if you don't get the focus you are looking for, it's actually more likely to stir up trouble. In some cases you are better asking for a single precise step than giving the horse a lot of work to do. I think I was getting to this point in my own thinking, so it was nice to have Harry put it so clearly.

Sari was working with a big reactive horse called Bubba who everybody agrees is the most adorable gentleman. He was very concerned about people after some bad experiences and it seemed that working with a big reactive draft horse might be helpful for Sari in preparation for more work with her small reactive mule.

One thing that was interesting to me was that Harry got her doing sudden and unexpected things in working with him, so he suggested suddenly skipping a few steps, or turning around suddenly and reaching up to pet him. On the whole the opposite of the kind of things that one would expect to do with an anxious and reactive horse. The important thing is not to be hesitant.

I was working with a horse called ""Shazam!"" and he is very mentally diffuse, ready to tune out at the slightest notice. I think it will be a challenge for me to be sufficiently aware and on the case to keep him with me the whole time, so developing that will be my project for tomorrow.

<h4>Day 2</h4>
We started day two talking a little about the problems we had seen the day before, the way that the horses were tending to be unfocussed and more interested in their friends and what was going on outside the arena. Harry explained how you can think of it as the horse's mind going out to where their attention was directed and that it works like elastic- the further apart the two ends were, the more tension there is in the system. If we can bring the horse to be present then they will be calmer and more comfortable.

Our horses need us to be adequate leaders, but their standards of adequacy are high, it's a lot of work for us to get there.

One of the elements that came up a few times was around following a feel on the bit- both Lana the mule and Brownie the little arabian were having trouble with following a feel. Lana had become heavy on the bit and they worked on it by having Robin ( her rider ) pick up the inside rein and lift it, asking Lana to disengage. Lana spent a lot of time trying to walk forward through that, moving forward with her shoulder rather than around with her hind feet, but Harry just had Robin wait for a change. Instead of trying to do anything more she just needed to let Lana search for a solution- once she finds it she will take ownership of it in a way that she couldn't if Robin just showed her what change to make. Harry talked about the way Lana kept moving forward as the mule hanging on to the thought of moving forward. The disengage of the hindquarters is asking them to disengage from that thought and when that happens properly it indicates that she has let go of the thought she had. This doesn't mean that she will accept another thought from her rider however- this is why in this situation Harry was asking for a disengage followed by a step across with the front end of the horse- the disengage is asking the horse to let go of one thought, the step across is asking for them to accept a new one.

With Trixie mule, she was working a lot better than on day one but she was still quick to put her attention elsewhere if possible. One thing Harry pointed out was that when you are making a fuss to bring their attention back, you are often better to do it further away from them- if you are too close you are more likely to scare them and send them away, a little further away and they will bring their attention around to you. 

They also did a lot of work on making sure that Trixie was looking where she was going before she set off- if they're not looking where they are going then their thought hasn't gone in that direction, so Harry places a lot of store in asking the horses to look where they are going before they set off.

When you need to intervene to bring back a horse or mule's attention it's important not to overdo it - so if they are going around the outside ignoring you, you might stamp your feet or slap your rope on the ground, but as soon as that has happened you allow them to turn and face you and pet on them a little, otherwise you are just drawing their attention to send them straight away again without ever giving a place where it feels good- you need to offer a good spot. If you ask them to move and their attention and relaxation aren't present, you can forget the movement - attentiveness and relaxation are way more important than completing the circle.

A thought can be immensely heavy if it is against you ( most wars were the result of thoughts people couldn't let go of, after all ) but if it is with you, a thought will weigh less than nothing. The goal is to keep them with us the whole time.

Sari, working with the very reactive Beau ( who was called Bubba yesterday, but appears to have been renamed because he is such a grand looking horse ) was preparing him for his saddle but he wasn't content to accept the saddle pad. Harry suggested that Sari swing it around him and against him quite vigorously, sufficiently to cause him to move then just to rub on him once he was moving. If his movement was anxious and tense then the work needed to continue, once he moved in a calm, steady way, he was in a better place. Rather than working with the very heavy saddle pad, Sari used the coils of a lariat to do the same work. I haven't seen the quality of departure used as the criterion for evaluating the horse's response before but it makes perfect sense. 

<a href=""https://flic.kr/p/B3y79J""><img src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5758/23001384146_68efba06ae_b.jpg"" /></a>
Sari continued the work with the lariat which provoked a very similar reaction but was a lot easier for her to handle and control than a big saddle blanket.

Interestingly Harry recommended that when Sari asked Beau to move forward and he looked at all rushed, she just stick beside him and rub on him a little bit. That really helped him to feel confident in moving off, because he knew he wasn't in trouble.

I found Shazam to be a lot more tractable today but for all that I was sharpening up my act I still wasn't doing as much as he needed - Harry stepped into the round pen to demonstrate some changes I needed to make and because Shazam has met him a few times before, the horse was absolutely perfect, focussed, careful and connected. It was humbling to realise how much better I needed him to get, but we can get there- the biggest thing I needed was just to see what should be available to me. 

<h4>Day 3</h4>
Over breakfast we talked a little more about what I had experienced with Shazam, that he needed me to be an adequate leader and I realised that I really needed to avoid making excuses for him - which is easy to do because he is a weird horse. Regardless of that, he can work with me and think through what I am asking, he doesn't need to be focussed on the distance and it would make him feel better if he was with me instead of out there.

A question came up about situations where you took a horse out of their familiar environment and lost all the positive things that you thought you had. Harry observed that if things fall apart away from home it shows that they weren't good enough at home, but most of us don't notice the things at home that will become a problem when we get away from there. Most horses are not close to sufficiently responsive.

<a href=""https://flic.kr/p/ArTz7V""><img src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5733/22609104637_fdb0f0bea9_b.jpg"" /></a>
When Gilda was getting started with Trixie the mule was tending to kick out at her when she moved out and Harry pointed out that although most people get bothered by that kind of behaviour, it is only another way for them to say that we're in the way of their thought. She had said the same thing several times more quietly but as Gilda had persisted, she was making her point more emphatically before she was ready to give up on her idea and accept Gilda's. 

When Gilda really needed to grab Trixie's attention Harry suggested that it was more effective for her to make a fuss a little further from her mule- his analogy was that if a horse was tied to a tree and the tree fell down, they would be doing whatever they could to escape, but if they were tied to a tree and another tree in the field fell down, they would want to turn and face it. If you're too close when you do something attention grabbing the horse may need to leave or even to try and defend themself, but if you're a little further away, they will probably turn and face you, giving their full attention.

Beau was a little less confident in this session, so Sari had to spend more time coming in to capture his attention and then direct him. Although he is very gentle and likes being around people, his anxiety would mean that it would be easy to set him back and what might seem like a small setback to most horses could take him a long way back.

<a href=""https://flic.kr/p/B3y6Gb""><img src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/603/23001382606_21484f178a_b.jpg"" /></a>
Working in the saddle, Sari was doing some of the basic work on steering that most of us used at some point on the clinic, which is to ask for a turn using the rein alone, offering for the inside front foot to step across. If that didn't happen, the next step is to shorten and lift the rein to disengage the horse. Once they had stepped across behind without the front feet moving forward ( which often takes some time ) you can offer the inside rein again to ask for a step across and repeat the process until you get one. 

That is a fairly standard process, but what caught my attention was Harry's explanation of why you work that way- you are beginning by offering them your thought of turning, if they don't take it then you need to disengage their thought, which is usually to move forward, and finally offer them that turn again. Having disengaged one thought doesn't mean they'll definitely accept your suggestion as a replacement, but until they have let go of the idea they had before they certainly won't be able to. I found this a very interesting explanation of why this exercise is important and explained a lot of why Harry places a so much emphasis on making sure it is good.

When Rob was working with Lista the whole of the plan was about bringing her mind into the pen and trying to keep it there for any length of time. The little mare was very determined to think about everything outside in the world and although she would take direction from Rob, she always seemed to treat it as less important than her own considerations. Harry pointed out a lot of the patterns that Lista was following, like the way she would stare off into the distance and when Rob asked her to bend and come back to him she would have to move her feet as well. When Rob began to reach down the rein she would speed up to try and get ahead of the rein.

I rode Shazam during our session, but the first time I got on it wasn't a whole lot of fun as he kind of lurched around a little and I hopped off again because I'm not a big fan of sitting on a horse for the first time and them being totally weird. We figured out that he probably just wasn't used to carrying a portly gentleman such as myself around the place as the largest person who had ridden him was likely to be Harry. We did some work on getting him to brace up against pressure on the saddle and get used to supporting me a little and then I got back on, whereupon he did a lot better and started to feel like a nice riding horse.

<h4>Day 4</h4>
Breakfast question time on day four got onto the subject of focus- Harry told us that if we allow our horses to be concerned about the little things, we won't be able to ask for them to stick with us on the big things. We need to be able to judge what is important to them and teach them the habit of giving up a thought they were carrying and picking up a thought we are offering. We may not need to be their primary thought the whole time, but we need them to be able to switch over and make us their primary thought any time we ask for it. As long as they are ready to come back to us, we're in a good place. We can certainly ask to be the most important thing in their world while we're working them- they get to practice tuning us out the other twenty three hours of the day.

Shaczam and I worked first and he was doing really well. One point that came up during groundwork was that when I backed him up I was drifting with him a little, which meant it didn't mean as much in his mind. If he was drifting back to avoid me then staying with him makes sense, but if I'm asking him to back up then the distance between us should increase.

Under saddle I was picking up the rein a little too much - Shaczam doesn't need much at all in the hand, when he's paying attention. Harry has a very definite way of using the reins with horses who are less experienced about following them and I'm going to relate it here because it's very useful:

Suppose I am turning right. I want to take the rein out to the right and lengthen my left rein to give plenty of space for the horse to move into it. If I was to start with both hands in the middle of the rein, I would hold the centre of the rein in my left hand, slide my right hand to the right creating the opening rein but not holding at all, and draw my left hand equally left. This shortens the right rein through my directing right hand, lengthens my left rein and means my hands are centred and equidistant in front of me. As a technique for guiding a young or confused horse while staying centred and balanced, it's pretty great.

I spent much of the rest of the day practicing moving my hands across a lead rope in the way that I would while manipulating my reins. 

Lista was still hard to keep inside the pen. Harry worked with her and even for him it took some time until he could hold her attention- she was very determined to be elsewhere. Rob got her to a better place than yesterday, but she still had a lot of unsettled feelings about her and so he asked Harry to ride her a little. There followed an extended session where Harry mostly just worked on asking her to steer and sometimes to back up and bring her attention back to him. Lista was determined not to do anything of the sort and Harry really had his work cut out to bring her back consistently for any length of time. She improved a lot over time, but it will be hard to evaluate the complete outcome of the work until day five. Very interesting to watch, though.

During Bill and Brown's session, the topic of getting big/creating energy came up and Harry talked about how a lot of people find it hard to be that assertive. The intensity required to get a change is a feeling often associated with anger in many people, in fact Harry suggested it wouldn't really matter if there was some anger in there as long as it was gone the moment the horse got things right. Apparently one of the regular students on his clinics is an actress and she sometimes gives acting lessons in the evenings to help people get the feeling of acting as though angry without actually being angry.

Apropos of nothing, a picture of Sari and Beau because I like the photo.
<h4>Day 5</h4>
On our final morning we started out with quite a few questions- one topic that came up was the difference between a cue and an aid which, from what I recall, concluded that a cue is a way of triggering a recalled response and that an aid is something that helps to guide the horse to a response. Of course there is a large area of crossover between the two, but thinking about those definitions and where they begin to apply was interesting. It also tied in a little to something I had noticed previously about the way that Harry will sometimes deliberately avoid helping guide the horse towards the thing he is asking for if they are actively seeking it, because the horse that searches for an answer and finds it for themselves has a different kind of ownership of that knowledge and the concept will tend to ""stick"" a little better.

<a href=""https://flic.kr/p/Aucewg""><img src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5750/22635183719_c8d9c2eab9_b.jpg"" /></a>
The first pair to work were Robin and Lana, who went down to the playground beyond the arena- mostly we had worked in a round pen until this point, but Harry has a large arena and then an area with various obstacles set up for students to work around. The challenge with Lana was that she had been here before and knew how to do things. Being a mule that meant she was going to do them, but she wasn't prepared to pay attention to Robin when she did, so she was performing them as something closer to a routine rather than paying attention and keeping focus- if Robin asked her to stop or change the pattern, Lana considered this quite objectionable.

In a circumstance where there is a job you want to get done, you need to be prepared to forget that if you lose the horse's mind. You will have to do whatever is necessary to bring them back before you can start working on the task you had in mind again.

<a href=""https://flic.kr/p/Aucekp""><img src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/611/22635183089_54d7187334_b.jpg"" /></a>
After her conversation with Harry on day four, Lista was a lot calmer; she wasn't rushing and she didn't need to charge about in pursuit of her own ideas, she could stick with Rob. This was a massive change and Rob did a very good job of maintaining it. 

Over lunch Harry answered a question that had come up regarding horses that fall behind the bit. He observed that it's the same problem as pushing against the bit- in both cases the horse wants to move forward. If they are willing to push against the bit they will do that, if not they will tuck back behind the contact and move off the same. Either way the solution is the same- you need to bring their mind back to where their body is and keep them with you. 

<a href=""https://flic.kr/p/A8PGXs""><img src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5776/22404653624_c0ebdba8e2_b.jpg"" /></a>
In the afternoon the next team of Bill and Brown were doing groundwork - Bill is relatively new to horses and doesn't yet have his own, so this was a great opportunity for him to learn some important basics in a very positive environment. Harry pointed out that it wasn't enough to keep interrupting Brownie's thought, you need to get a change of thought, which is often reflected in movement and in where the horse is looking. At a basic level, if a horse isn't looking where they are going then their thought and their body are going different directions. Until your horse looks where you direct them, and will come back to you whenever you go to change their direction, you need to work on that. Once that is in place, you have a lot of other good stuff you can gain.

When Sari worked Beau they were working on some of that twitchiness. Harry held Beau's rope through the arena fence and got Sari to use a flag to move him left and right, then to rub on him. Then he got me there as well with another flag moving him from the other side and then both of us moving in together to rub on him with the flags at the same time from opposite directions. This was a way to work on the concerns he had about different things happening on different sides of him. The exercise developed until there were four of us with flags moving around the pen with Sari and Beau travelling in between us. Finally we held flags in pairs a bit like a salute between us so they rubbed along Beau's face and down his back while Sari lead him through and the same in reverse when she backed him the other way. It was a very gentle and progressive exercise that really helped build up his confidence and left him feeling a lot braver.

Shazam and I were last up and he was feeling a lot like a good riding horse, albeit one who was quick to take his attention all over the place. I was mostly interested in practicing using my hands more correctly and just getting his thought with me more consistenly under saddle, something I think we mostly achieved. The change in him between day one and day five was extraordinary.
</lj-cut>

It was a really good clinic. Really good. Harry is as good as people say he is- he has a depth of knowledge and an aptitude for explanation that make him an excellent teacher and by the end of the clinic I felt as though I had so much more understanding of the reasoning behind a lot of techniques that I was already using or that I knew to work but had never seriously thought through why they worked. That underpinning is probably the biggest part of what I will be bringing home with me from this clinic and I can't wait to begin introducing it to my horses and seeing where it will take us. I can already see numerous ways that I think it will help Iris to feel more confident in me and in the world. It feels to me that this was a thing I was ready for in my horsemanship and also something I needed. If you ever get the chance to see or ride with Harry, you should take it. You will be pleased that you did.

"event","There were things about October 2005 that have shaped my life ever since. One of those things was that the Sequoia album came out, as I mentioned a couple of posts ago. But the biggest one, far and away the biggest, was that on the nineteenth of October 2005, Othello stepped off the horsebox onto the yard and I had a horse of my own for the first time.

A decade is a long time but I feel that I have spent that time well as regards my progress with horses. They were already central to the life I shared with my wife but having my own, in spite of my inexperience and general beginnerish awfulness ( paired with deep enthusiasm ) was a really big deal for me. Othello set me on the path of becoming a horseman, and the grief and pain of losing him fixed me on that course in a way that perhaps nothing else could have. The understanding of loss that I had gone through, gave me a connection to Sari when she lost one of the horses in her life a little later that year, which was how we first came to know one another.

Since then I have ridden colts in Texas, trained up a truly amazing trail horse, taught more than a handful of people about the basics ( and sometimes the less-basics ) of horsemanship and become a passable hand by British standards, albeit still the most average rider you will ever see. I'm working on that part. I have made some enduring friendships - including most of the people who will be reading this - and met a lot of brilliant, smart, interesting and sweet natured horses. 

I have reached a different place now - that bright incandescence of enthusiasm is more of a steady glow now, it has resolved into part of me and, as you might have noticed, I am slower to share my opinions these days. It's not that I have lost confidence in them - I know more than I ever did and I am clearer about what needs to be done in many situations than most people are, but I have gradually learned that I can't help most people or their horses. If someone asks for help I will do what I can to assist, but I don't really feel that I have much to prove now. My horses tell me that I'm doing things alright by them and although I know that they are my life's work, I also feel that I need to focus on things that might make me a more immediate profit for a little while. Something that will maybe enable me to afford to spend at least a few years doing what I love most of all. I have used a lot of years up already, but with luck and some smarts, I think I could make enough to cross that bridge perhaps. If I can focus this dissolute mind on a couple of significant projects, at least. 

Nobody goes through a decade of their life without being changed by it, but the horses, the change they have brought about in me has been so overwhelmingly positive. Every time I get to the field to be greeted with whickers and whiskery velvet muzzles, I am profoundly grateful for the grace that they bring and the person that they have helped me learn how to become."

Summer is a weird time of year for me- although I look forward to it, I end up so busy it often passes in a blur and lacks the clarity and definition of the memories I have for other seasons. Perhaps my mind still works on an academic year and Summer feels like the stretched out ending that for so many years it was. Also I probably haven't listened to enough new and interest music in the last few years, I've learned this also. That said, Mynd, from last year's list is a fantastic album and you should definitely listen to it."

After a couple of days away, we came home via the New Forest and as we had a few hours in hand we took a little circuit around the national park and met some of the ponies living there. New Forest ponies in the evening light turn out to be tremendously photogenic:

"event","I'm just back from riding two consecutive clinics with <a href=""http://silversand.com.au/newsite/steve-halfpenny/"">Steve Halfpenny</a> which has been an eye-opening experience. Riding with Steve always is, of course, but this time around I think I started to really <i>get</i> something I hadn't understood before. Something about balance and setting up the cues for direction and for life and something about expectation. Above all the message of ""never pull on your horse"" got taken to new and far greater depths. The important thing from all of this is that you <i>never</i> pull on your horse. Holding the lead ahead of them with the rope slack so they step forward? Pulling on your horse. Picking up the reins more when you don't get the response you were looking for immediately? Pulling on your horse. If you <i>never</i> pull on your horse, some things change which mean that everything is different. It's simple and revolutionary and unbelievably difficult and if you haven't felt it, you would be able to agree with everything I say without having the slightest idea of what I mean, which is the problem of talking about this stuff. I hope to get a clinic report written up at some point, though.

"event","A few weeks ago I finally got to ride a clinic with Buck. If you aren't familiar with the name, you should probably <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1753549/?ref_=fn_al_tt_3"">watch the film about him</a> ( a good enough film that non-horsey folk can enjoy it too ) to get an idea of his work. Buck is one of the people who spent a lot of time learning with Ray Hunt and Tom Dorrance long before anyone thought to try and sell their approach as ""natural horsemanship."" This is the starting point for the horsemanship I have been working on for a long time now and most of the people I have learned from have either spent time with Buck or know him personally, so he's certainly connected to the path I am on.

Now he was teaching one of only two clinics in this country and it was about ten miles from where I live so although rider places were pricey it seemed worth it to me to take part in this one. The clinic was a new double format, with Buck teaching in the morning and <a href=""http://taylormadehorsemanship.com/melanie/"">Melanie Smith-Taylor</a> who works with an understanding of the approach that Buck teaches but comes from more of a showjumping direction. It made for long days, but a very interesting combination.

<lj-cut text=""Three days and thirty riders in the big arena"">
I turned up bright and early on the first day of the clinic - we had dropped Iris off the previous evening - made sure my mare was spruce and had water and breakfast then got ready for the first day. I hit the first problem as I began to tack up- I had somehow forgotten my saddle blanket and I couldn't really get by without it. There was half an hour left until we were due to start, time I was planning to use to get warmed up. Instead I dived into my car and dashed off to the yard to pick it up, a 15 minute journey each way in the best possible traffic, and this was the morning rush hour. 

Incredibly I managed it in something close to optimal time and we walked into the arena last, but just as the music was stopping and Buck started to speak.

The first morning began with everyone on foot and Buck getting to know the horse he was riding for the weekend. He hadn't met her before and she was a mare with some history to her ( we later heard her story, which was of being a showjumper, ruined by the age of four, gradually brought back towards rideability over a few subsequent years ) and so he did a little work on the ground with her, talking about what he looks for when he works on the ground and then, pleading sciatica, said that although he wouldn't expect most of us to ride a horse at this point he could probably fix things up easier from the saddle and be more comfortable while he did. 

For the next few minutes, Buck had to work hard to keep the mare moving forward - he explained to us that she was ready to flip with him, but he wasn't keen for that to happen, so he was quick to use his spurs when he felt her get that backwards or upwards feeling in her. She sprang forward a few times, gave a few small bucks and then started moving forward instead. Although Buck was fast to use his spurs and firm when he did use them, he only needed them for a couple of minutes before the horse understood what he wanted and settled down completely. I know a few people found this hard to watch and no doubt Buck could have solved the same problem in a lot of ways, but this changed the horse's mind very quickly and gave her so much clarity that she could rapidly begin to feel safe in his company. Once she settled down, she was really calm and seemed very happy with him for the rest of the clinic, probably the calmest horse in the arena for most of that time.

<img src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/271/19540129508_1a645a2bcf_z.jpg"" />
Listening to Buck.

Buck talked us through that process and then moved on to discussing what we were going to be doing with our horses- given the format of the clinic, he suggested that we skip on groundwork unless there was something we specifically wanted to work on and go straight to riding exercises. The first of these was short serpentines.

The important thing with this exercise is that the horse is bent on the turn following their nose, that you only ask for them to step around as the inside foot is about to leave the ground and that before you change from the left to the right or vice-versa, you make sure you have a straight stride, so you don't pull them off balance by too much of a direct change from right to left. The other important element of this, which was probably the thing I focussed on most in a fairly familiar exercise, was that we needed to really make sure our horses didn't slow down or drag through the turns. They needed to be pushing forward strongly even as we moved through. Buck observed that this was a great way of building up engagement in the horse.

Buck observed that some of the horses were a little distracted ( there were thirty of us in a new and large arena with a large audience, so it was what you might call an unfamiliar environment for most of them ) he suggested that while the horse was less attentive, we should move to really tight serpentines, with the horse a little overflexed to the inside ( so they are almost at a ninety degree bend ) so that we formed much tighter turns almost to the point of turning back on ourselves at each end. Again the focus here needed to be on the horse keeping forward the whole time and by moving into these tighter figures, we gave them more to think about in the work, so they had less time to worry about the rest of the world.

These exercises were interspersed with disengaging the hindquarters as a way of making sure we could reliably get to the horse's back feet with the reins. Buck is very particular about how smoothly the hind end turns loose and how smoothly the horse moves. The disengage must be smooth and relaxed from start to finish if we are going to be able to use it to help the horse feel calm.

We did a little work at the end of the morning on picking up a soft feel in halt and asking the horse to rebalance back a little. Buck talks a lot about a soft feel in his work and what he is talking about is as much as anything a lack of resistance in the horse. It characterises as the horse being ready to respond to the rein ( ""every time I reach for my horse, I want the horse to reach back for me"" ) and to work with a relaxed poll and lifted back, without bracing against the rider's aids. 

You start working towards this by asking the horse to balance back a little in halt, and then taking it forward into the walk, asking for the horse to give with their poll a little and releasing when they do. Develop from there until they can carry a soft feel the whole time in all your work. That is a long time goal, however, trying to hold a horse in place is pointless because they need your release to guide them to the right answer. I had allowed my hands to become a little greedy, so this was a useful area to work on with a focus on offering a fair release and maintaining forward when picking up a soft feel.

<img src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/481/19541486639_1a5404bc57_z.jpg"">
A focus in this work was making sure that the horse's balance was moving with us, so they were ready to follow the changes in our position and either move faster or slow down with the movement that we offered them.

I was also working on all of this while trying to maintain a consistent movement past the gateways between the arena and the car park, which Iris had identified as a danger zone of the highest order ( alert status: Loggins ) and so I was working on being confident enough in directing her that she didn't need to take over too much and run away. In general it was quite successful, although if someone nearby made a transition as we went past, things got a little pesky.

In the afternoon Melanie had us continuing with the same work, but bringing in pairs of trotting poles to help us find more precision. I had never used trotting poles with Iris, so we got to do some fancy high steps, especially as we moved up into trot. Working with the poles the goal was to use the same balance that we had been developing in the morning to help set up the horses so they don't collide with the poles.

<img src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/430/19720962932_01b36d3e01_z.jpg"">
We also worked on stopping from trot directly between two poles so we could use the poles to judge our accuracy- are we in the mid-point between the poles? Are we too far forward or back in the box? 

As the weekend continued we developed and refined this work. We did a lot of on connecting the horse's movement to ours and their balance to ours. Buck also has a progressive series of approaches to half turns that he teaches, so we began by making a simple half turn with a soft feel in walk, then the same in trot ( still a short turn ) while maintaining a soft feel - it's actually pretty hard to get this sufficiently tight without one - and then moving on to turning to face the other way, then changing bend into leg yield to do that out to the rail. Once you have that leg yield working consistently and the soft feel is maintained, then by applying a canter cue as you reach the rail you have things set up to help the horse pick up the correct lead when you move out. 

Although it was a large group and everyone was in motion most of the time ( except we did split into half groups for canter work ) Buck was always on hand to answer questions, so if you were getting stuck he could help you out. It was very noticeable how calm and willing his horse was on the second day. She seemed really happy with the deal Buck had to offer her.

<img src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/434/19540085838_6816e646cd_z.jpg"">
At the end of the session I was asking Buck about something after the mics were off, while we were making our way out towards lunch. I don't even remember what the question was about now, but after I thanked him Buck observed that I had done some good work that morning. That was genuinely high praise and I was super pleased with it and with my brilliant mare. I might even have been a little proud of it, in some respects that could count as foreshadowing. 

<img src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/436/19720923312_e4a43b2c38_z.jpg"">
With Melanie we moved on to working on patterns that had us circling around a set of ground rails- we split into smaller groups for the afternoon session and I was in the one that preferred flatwork - I have never tried jumping Iris but I feel like before I do I might want to be in a saddle without a horn on the front. Melanie had us working on lining ourselves up on the poles and making sure we were judging the number of strides we had between each set of poles, then experimenting with closing the gait down to take an extra stride or extending it to take fewer. We also worked on cantering through them. It was interesting seeing the later group work on very low jumps - there were a few horses who were determined to jump everything like it was three feet at least which I think made life a little hard for their riders, but certainly looked the part. It was interesting to see how difficult some of the more showjumpy horses found it to actually trot- once poles and jumps appeared, not something they practice much in that environment, but of course the better they get at listening, the easier things become across the board.

<img src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/258/19107260253_d11568fea6_z.jpg"" />
Iris has one of her first encounters with ground poles. At one point Buck observed ""Ben, your horse would find it easier to maintain a soft feel if you kept your hands a little lower."" No idea what he was referring to.

Something I found helpful was the way that Melanie, who is very aware of Buck's approach but spent a lot of time with George Morris too, was able to connect the type of riding I have seen a lot more of here with the feel that I have been learning to apply in my horsemanship.

On Friday morning, we managed to start with a slight mishap- as we began our circuit of serpentines, Iris suddenly realised that although the car park gates <i>were</i> very dangerous, there was a hitherto-unannounced peril space at the end of the arena. She did the sensible thing and departed at speed for safety. This is a thing Iris does occasionally - and for a gentle-looking and superficially easygoing mare one does spend a certain proportion of the time riding on what feels like a ticking bomb - so I'm not unaccustomed to it, but she had been working hard and travel tends to take it out of her somewhat and consequently she had lost a little weight. That in turn wouldn't have been a problem had her rider not just taken a ""three wraps and the first hole"" approach to his latigo. So anyway, there I was on a fast moving horse with my saddle having rolled half way around her side. I did the dignified thing and landed on my ass, while my poor mare panicked and went bucking and galloping off across the arena. 

Funnily enough, when I was lying on my back with her throwing herself in the air a couple of feet away, I was absolutely clear that I was in no danger from Iris. I may not trust her not to spook, but I knew I could completely trust her in that situation.

So off she went, at a flat out gallop interspersed with bucking, right through the class of thirty other riders. The effect was a little like rolling a bowling ball across a snooker table- an immediate hectic crisis, which everyone needed to get control of. Buck talked everyone through it ""there's nothing any of us can do for her right now, so keep your horses safe"" and told everyone to follow Iris if she was scaring their horses so that they were moving towards what bothered them rather than it approaching them. 

<img src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/454/19541478719_b9805d267f_z.jpg"" >
After a brief circuit, Iris made her way back to Buck, which I'm sure is no co-incidence, he was an absolute island of calm in the middle of the arena, and he had his apprentice Nathan remove the saddle and then reseat it, while he talked a little about what had happened and I got a brief check-over from one of the other riders who is a doctor with a lot of experience of people falling off horses. Luckily I had landed on my well cushioned rump and aside from a few bruises the worst injury was my pride, but it was very reassuring to get an immediate check over there and then.

Nathan saddled Iris back up ( amazingly, given what had just happened, she was fine with this ) being careful to tighten the cinch a whole lot and did a little work with her before giving her back to me. Iris was really good with it all, but I can certainly see why Buck works this way to help horses and riders stay safe in those types of situation. Once he was confident we were good to go, I hopped back on and we got on with the clinic. As Buck said, sometimes you just have to cowboy up.

<img src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/516/19540049500_87fce5f4e7_z.jpg"">
In the afternoon we did work with the poles in an hourglass shape ( although with no central crossing point ) where we used the poles as transition markers for fast trot to slow trot, trot to canter and so on. I found this use of visual markers very useful, although judging by the pictures they strongly incline me to look down.

This was a big clinic, twice the size of the next largest I have ridden and it was certainly interesting and a lot of fun. It may well constitute a unique way of helping a horse learn to handle those crowded conditions, but in spite of the large group size, everyone seemed to get a lot out of it. Much of that is because both Buck and Melanie had a lot of helpful accounts and interesting stories to share in addition to the exercises we were working on, but I think having lots of points of comparison for the work we were doing and being able to call in and ask questions at any point also helped. It's also challenging because everyone is working at a slightly different level - there wasn't much that we worked on in Buck's sessions which fell outside of the exercise I use routinely, but that didn't mean I couldn't improve them a whole lot with this kind of focus. You want to get things right in front of this kind of audience and that certaily presses one to improve, I feel. The focus means that you don't really notice the spectators and although I'm sure we were all catching all kinds of criticism from the benches as we rode- it's always way easier to get things right from the back row than it is in the arena after all - we couldn't hear it so it wasn't a problem from where we were sitting. I got a lot out of it, but for someone less experienced in this way of working a horse, I might suggest riding with some other trainers who can give you more personal attention first, because if you go into this with some solid basics I think that can equip you to get as much out of it as possible.

"event","Two things happened last weekend - I spent three days riding a clinic with Buck Brannaman and <lj user=herecirm> pretty much reached the end of her tether with Marty the mule. She's been working hard with him but lately a string of setbacks and periods of patchy progress have really left her feeling a little lost and unhappy in her work with him. I have been ever so impressed with her progress both in horsemanship and in her relationship with Marty but I could see her getting dismayed and I know just how difficult it is to be learning a new way of working and to be working with an animal who is also learning, even with a lot of support. After talking about it, I suggested I might work with him for a week and see what I could get. 

You might wonder why I wasn't being more help to start with, but the truth is that I have learned time and again unasked for help is almost invariably unwanted help, so I won't offer help ( rarely even an opinion ) unless someone has asked for it. Unfortunately <lj user=herecirm> is far too considerate and consequently hadn't been asking me for help in spite of wanting it because she thought it might inconvenience me. As having a happy Sari is my A1 top priority, I found myself in the happy position of being able to do the thing I most enjoy in the interests of making my true love happier. A most auspicious confluence.

I had an idea of where we had gone wrong in our work so far and at the root of it we had really listened to too much advice from too many different people. Marty is very sensitive, he feels everything, he is aware of everything, he can respond to the most subtle energy cues, he also tends to get introverted, which means that there is a chance he might shut down if pushed too hard and avoiding that was a priority.

We've done a lot of good work, but where we went wrong was that we worried about that last one and allowed it to back us off. He <i>is</i> sensitive, he <i>can</i> feel everything, but that doesn't mean he needs to be cut any slack. Whether or not he is sensitive, if he isn't trying to get along with us then he needs to change his mind.

""A good horseman,"" Buck said, when I asked him if he had any mule tips, ""might have very high expectations of a mule."" So when we began our first session I went in there with high expectations.  I had done some work to where I could catch him a few months ago because he was of the opinion that I wasn't allowed to do that at all which didn't seem entirely practical to me. Now I was saying that I needed him not only to be caught after a cautious approach and very careful preparation, but to really buy in to the whole idea of being caught. That day it took me most of an hour to put a halter on him and most of that time he was running around like a goon. I don't mind that kind of thing - I am always working on the horse's time ( or the mule's in this case ) so I just kept him moving and started pushing if he wanted to turn his back on me, dropped the pressure if he thought about coming over. It was a long session because he just didn't have the slightest interest in being caught, but as soon as he was I took him out and we got to work. 

Marty has an irritating trait of running out backwards from any situation he isn't keen on. It has been successful for him, but I wanted to start to get it changed. He's also very twitchy around his flanks and hindquarters, so it seemed to me that using a flag was a good way of working on both of those. As soon as we got into the school he thought that running backwards would probably help him to achieve his complex mule-type plans and vanished towards the corner. I went with him, using the flag vigourously in the general direction of his hindquarters until he tried moving forward instead. We worked first on him just walking with me - not walking alongside me but actually connecting in with my feet and my intention, so he could start following my changes without needing the flag. 

It took a while- he would drop back, then run forward when I used the flag at all and get ahead, which turned out to make the flag appear <i>in front of him.</i> It was a very trying day to be a mule. But after a while I started to see what I wanted- instead of jumping to conclusions about what I must obviously want, Marty began to start tuning into what I was actually asking him for. He started being able to walk and stop with me. After a while he was able to trot with me when I picked up my pace a little - putting more speed in tends to bring back any trouble that you were dealing with before, but you have less time to sort it out. 

I was very much influenced in this work by watching Buck help a horse find changes by simply being clear, firm and persistent so although they had a few anxious minutes initially while they tried all the things they expected to work, the horse really quickly accepted his leadership and clearly felt a lot better for it once it happened.

Over the next few days I worked a lot on having Marty walk with me, then on accepting the flag coming in and touching him while we walked- a doubly useful exercise because he gets to figure out that he doesn't need to flinch the whole time and we get to work on distinguishing between the flag just waving about without any intent and me using the flag to direct him.

He is a very apt student - I found myself having to rapidly move the goalposts to keep us from getting stuck and to keep him interested. We go back to the flag work often as he still needs to work on all those twitches, but I have also got a saddle on him ( he wore one but then had a big saddle related scare ) and after a few rather humpy strides and a couple of sproinks he settled to it pretty well. He's going to need a lot of work to be properly settled with it and between that and the twitchiness I think long-reining will be an excellent exercise for him. 

He has changed a lot in the last week - from being quite sceptical of me at the start of the week I like to feel he has come to think of me as ""a person he met."" Our catching times have come down from most of an hour ( I wasn't timing on the first day ) to being instantly caught by Friday. After a day off we were back to a little over ten minutes, but one wouldn't expect steady progress in this kind of endeavour and he marked me out for his highest honour on Saturday evening, as he kindly gave me permission to scratch his butt while he pulled ridiculous faces. It was a lot like being on the New Years Honours list."

Now I am not great at thinking about gigs I want to go to- in fact, I have somewhat lost my passion for seeking out live music in the last few years - but fortunately my brother is and for my birthday back in February he bought us tickets for their London show. My response to it was not what I expected.

<i>""A swallow is depicted there, along your fuselage.""</i>

When I bought <i>The Decline Of...</i> I was in a brief intermission of staying at my parents' house, having recently moved out of a flat nearby and being in the process of buying a first home. It was an exciting time, but also a happy one- I was in a relationship that seemed to be quite comfortable, quite grown-up, and we were temporarily living in the house I had grown up in. It was an odd house, built up from an old WW2 Nissen hut and entirely wood clad, comfortable in that cool November, with it's textured wall paper and the big green log stove in the living room that heated it. It connected up my childhood, my teenage years and the happy homecomings during university holidays with the changes ahead, my impending marriage and the house I was about to purchase. I had also joined a new band and I was exciting about the music we were going to make together. I missed my university friends but I was still young and there was a lot to look forward to.

<i>""Oh little England, tonight I'll swim, from my favourite island shores...""</i>

I didn't really appreciate <i>The Decline Of British Sea Power</i> for a year or so after I got it. I listened to it the next autumn and suddenly it blazed into my mind and my imagination and I realised in a flash what an astounding collection of songs it is.

<i>""I believe that bravery exists.""</i>

The band didn't work out, I mean we recorded a pretty great album and I enjoyed a lot of things about it, but there were others that made me unhappy. Well, if I'm honest a lot of them were to do with the relentless political machinations of our singer. There were things I liked about him, the person I talked to when we had direct conversations, and I was ambitious for our music to achieve something too, but he spent so much time working at being a jerk that eventually that was what he became. He had a very troubled relationship with women as well, forever teetering between worship and contempt. There are things about him that I didn't realise until years after I left the band, but certainly I don't regret leaving, but maybe in some ways I regret joining. We did a lot of gigs, we played in some interesting places, once I got a free t-shirt - although given the investment I put into the album it doesn't feel like a <i>great</i> deal in retrospect - and it gave me a glimpse of the edges of the music industry. Those edges were full of boring middle-aged men, no different from most other industries. It didn't look so exciting from where I stood and the relationship between work and the chances of getting any pay whatsoever as a musician playing original music seemed unbelievably tenuous. All around me I saw amazing bands who could have sold huge numbers of records playing to empty back rooms and slowly washing away. With them went my faith in the music industry. I will always love music, but I wouldn't want to work there.

<i>""I feel the lapping of an ebbing tide...""</i> 

I was standing in the Roundhouse with <lj user=""herecirm""> beside me and British Sea Power were playing <i>Remember Me</i> and at some point I realised that there were tears rolling down my face and I didn't know that I was crying until that moment. It was the strongest and most immediate emotional impact music has ever had on me. They weren't the last tears I shed that night.

<i>""For then you will have lost it all, the last of this island...""</i>

A couple of years after the time that we stayed there, my parents went ahead with their plans to demolish the old house and rebuild it. It was a massive undertaking, costly, time consuming and immensely stressful. They came through it stressed out, exhausted and having spent their life savings, but they also have a truly beautiful house. It's in a different position on the plot, with a tall prow, bright windows and gorgeous wood floors. Now it has been lived in for a few years it is a charming place and a well deserved reward for their retirement. The pine clad walls are gone, though and the old green stove and I will never be able to show them to Sari.

<i>""They say the past is a foreign country, how can we go there? How can we go where we once went?</i>

One of the first nights I listened to <i>The Decline Of British Sea Power</i>, on a deep November evening, I made a pecan pie in that familiar kitchen. It took ages because I'm bad at pastry but it was a really good pecan pie, what we had of it. We left it on the side in the kitchen over night and the next morning the pecans had all gone and the surface of the pie was covered with tiny mouse footprints.

<i>""All through the years, all through the dead scenes, all through the memories, melodies...""</i>

Every moment of the first half of the set was wreathed in magic and memory and that strange intensity that comes from listening to music that you have loved so intensely it feels as though every word of the lyrics is carved into your bones in a room full of people who are caught up in the same moment as you. Not your moment, though, because the last twelve years of your history are opening up like a flag around you and you are free to inspect them, and to enjoy them, and to let them go if you want. To let them rise like paper embers and give them up to the wind and the joyous noise of the sky. Not to let them weigh you down, but instead to allow them to lift you up. 

I have lived out some of my potential and allowed a whole lot more to drift away to nothing, but I am once again engaged to be married and this time it is to the absolute love of my life. I am becoming a horseman, playing music I love with a band I enjoy belonging to and working on other creative projects in the moments in between. And just the other night I heard the greatest album ever recorded, played live in its entirety by one of the few truly great bands of our era. This is a good place to be.

"event","I was in Lewes the other day and the drive home took me past the area where I got Cash from four years ago. When I met him there he was a very anxious little guy, very difficult to catch and not responding to any of the work that people were doing with him. 

Now it's years since I tried sitting on the little guy and when I last did it hurt pretty badly for some time afterwards, so he has no practical use at all. But when I got home and he was his usual friendly, confident, self coming over with his nostrils fluttering in a happy little whicker and demanding hugs and scratchies it did my heart a lot of good to see him. Everything about him is different these days and he is the most happy and helpful ( not <i>actually</i> helpful, but quite <i>convinced</i> he is helpful ) of ponies, about as fine of a friend horse as a person could wish for.

It's only one small life of a daft and adorable creature, but it's a life that has been improved by my being here. That counts for something."

"event","Yesterday evening we needed to get things done at the yard and I wasn't in a riding mood, so Iris' evening work was to come in and do a bit of groundwork. A few weeks ago I had done a short groundwork session that ended up with a bit of liberty stuff and she did really great while she stayed with me, so as I had a <lj user=""herecirm""> and a camera I asked her to do a bit of video of that:

Last time, after we had done a bit of liberty, Iris had realised there was some grass around and went off to eat it, and when I went over to catch her she ran off to the other end of the arena at top speed to eat there. I figured she might opt to do the same thing again, so we adjusted the camera and filmed some beautiful dappled mare running in slow motion, that just needed a sweeping soundtrack to add to the sentimental effect:

She really is a very special horse."

<lj-cut text=""illustrated version"">
A couple of weeks ago we visited Winkworth Arboretum ( although given the fact we had to pay on the door I suspect it may actually be someone else's boretum ) and got to see birds and flowers.

This gentleman was also present, showing off his plumage and whathaveyou. I wonder if the bird equivalent of a hairdresser is a plumber.

Blossom in the woods, just near here are some small carved houses nailed to the trees, presumably for the fairies, although given the price of property in the area they may be much vaunted affordable housing.

Looking out west from Blackdown. From the hill that day we could see the north and south downs on each side, while the Weald stretched out towards the Ashdown Forest ( famous in literature as the Hundred-Acre Wood ) to the west. One could quite understand why Tennyson was so fond of the place.

Finally two fine friends of mine, one of whom likes me somewhat more than the other does.

"event","One thing I have done since music grew into one of my obsessions ( which I think it probably no longer is, though it is deep in my bones now and I wouldn't be without it ) is that I have always listened to albums intensively at the time I discovered them and then often find that I can reach back to that time by listening to them again. Considering this the other day I started to think about spring albums that I associate with different years and so here, for no reason other than that I can is a list of albums that I have listened to in spring over the last 21 years:

<ul><li>Grammatics - Grammatics</li></ul>
2011
( My marriage had ended and I guess the inevitable crash was over, but I also had an idea that just possibly something better might follow it. )

I'm sure there are more that I don't recall around the early 2000s - recently is new and the joyous lack of context that marks youth means that the 1990s are vivid as though they were yesterday. One thing I see looking at this is that it wasn't just my feeling- some years genuinely were way better for music than others..."

"event","For my thirty*cough*th birthday, the mighty <lj user=herecirm> gave me a new camera, which I have been using quite a bit. My last camera didn't entirely stop working, but it has somewhat lost the ability to focus, which turns out to be a significant impediment to photography. So here are some photographs of things that have happened lately, which might also count as a general update on some of the things that are going on...
<lj-cut text=""Illustrated Version"">
<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/16559057218"" title=""Morning sky on the Surrey Hills by Ben Moxon, on Flickr""><img src=""https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8564/16559057218_c839e33066_z.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""480"" alt=""Morning sky on the Surrey Hills""></a>
The morning sky as I crested the hill on the drive to work from the farm we were house sitting at for most of February. Sufficiently pleasant.

<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/16720712666"" title=""Pony in hiding by Ben Moxon, on Flickr""><img src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7610/16720712666_f89960c271_z.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""480"" alt=""Pony in hiding""></a>
Cash is very good at hiding.

That one time when Marty huffled Cash so hard that his tongue came out.

<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/16745434051"" title=""Grooming chain by Ben Moxon, on Flickr""><img src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7591/16745434051_3d821150b9_z.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""480"" alt=""Grooming chain""></a>
Some kind of grooming chain almost established.

<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/16126660133"" title=""Asking for attention by Ben Moxon, on Flickr""><img src=""https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8652/16126660133_f2eca53362_z.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""480"" alt=""Asking for attention""></a>
This is one of my students working to get her mare's attention back after a big spook because hedges exist. She's a tricky mare- very anxious and needing a lot of direction to keep her brave, but she's making excellent progress and I'm enjoying teaching again after a bit of a hiatus in the end of last year.

<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/16720711216"" title=""Lunge technique by Ben Moxon, on Flickr""><img src=""https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8674/16720711216_d665e120a3_z.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""480"" alt=""Lunge technique""></a>
Another of the people I'm teaching with - I have picked up a few students on the exact opposite side of the county, who I endeavour to work with while Sari is at work on a Sunday but invariably take way too long and come home late in the afternoon.

<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/16560598819"" title=""Grey Heron by Ben Moxon, on Flickr""><img src=""https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8599/16560598819_89f09fec37_z.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""480"" alt=""Grey Heron""></a>
This Grey Heron was across the river from the car park at work- my new job is based in an office complex on the site of an old mill and the river runs right under the building we are based in. The heron was quite a distance away but the zoom on this camera is most impressive.

<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/16559055278"" title=""Stable door by Ben Moxon, on Flickr""><img src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7632/16559055278_b0150aec3b_z.jpg"" width=""480"" height=""640"" alt=""Stable door""></a>
Sari and Lindi, one of the horses she works with, looking pensive.

A cute girl and her mule.

Marty will jump quite enthusiastically to avoid getting his toes dirty. Although he is leaping right behind Sari he didn't come close to touching her or pushing on her at all. 

<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/16539347127"" title=""Mules don&#x27;t need to jump by Ben Moxon, on Flickr""><img src=""https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8671/16539347127_5abba2dbb1_z.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""480"" alt=""Mules don&#x27;t need to jump""></a>
However, mules don't jump just because there is something there. Not if they can step instead, which they usually can.

<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/16745430691"" title=""Bracken camouflage by Ben Moxon, on Flickr""><img src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7625/16745430691_aa3e057b31_z.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""480"" alt=""Bracken camouflage""></a>
You can see why Marty's colouring is sometimes described as ""fox dun"" - he's perfectly camouflaged against the bracken here.

Apparently Sari had a diabolical plan of some kind hatching here. I still don't know what it was. I should probably be concerned.

"event","I haven't written one of these in a while, but this is an important book so I'll share my opinions of it here as well:

One of the problems with most of the great horse trainers and clinicians is that although they are brilliant at working with horses or explaining what is happening with the horse in front of them, they are not always as good at teaching humans as they are at teaching horses and - at the next layer of remove - the number of definitive books on horsemanship can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Ross Jacobs is a clinician, a trainer and a writer and in all of those settings he stands out for his excellent communication skills, with people as well as horses.

In this book, Ross sets out to explore what lies at the very heart of horsemanship. Unlike many books in the field, it isn't tied to any particular discipline or style of riding but instead seeks to draw out what lies in common across disciplines and of course at the heart of them all is the horse. There are many books on how to train horses to peak fitness, how to improve your performance over fences or in the dressage arena but none of them really go into any depth on how to work with a horse's mind although that is usually the single most powerful governing factor in both the performance of the horse and the relationship between horse and rider. The Essence Of Good Horsemanship fills that gap.

The book explores three central pillars of working with the horse - Focus, Clarity and Softness and considers how to develop all three and how each one affects the other two. It is broken up into short chapters, each separating out an important idea and exploring it in detail. The writing is clear and easy to follow, combining expertise, personal experience and scientific evidence to shine light on topics that are traditionally difficult to grasp but become accessible through Ross' writing."

"event","Iris has always been quite busy in her mouth, tending to chomp at the bit, especially when she is anxious. I noticed it particularly when we were working on riding out the last few times and I realised that it wasn't just a manifestation of anxiety, there seemed to be a stereotypical element to it as well. So I set down and asked her not to. Just doing some gentle work on the ground, holding the bit rings and asking her to follow a feel without releasing until she had quit munching at the bit and was just holding it.

Two sessions later she seems to be able to just carry the bit most of the time. I'm ever so pleased with her but I can't help but feel a bit of a chump for not spotting it sooner."

"event","I had a big creative plan for this year, but most of my plans for the year have in fact not worked out because I am a horrendously lazy man.

However a conversation on Twitter with Juliet E McKenna ( <lj user=""jemck""> ) about representation of female authors on the genre shelves of bookshops got me looking at the ratio of male to female authors in that section of my local Waterstones and then deciding that this year I would only buy new fiction from female authors.

If I am honest, I don't always buy a lot of new books in any case, so this wasn't a big challenge for me, but this year I have bought way more new fiction than I have in a good few years so I thought I'd mention some of the books and authors that I read in case any of you might enjoy them too.

<strong>The Lescari Revolution - Juliet E McKenna</strong>
I have read quite a lot of Juliet McKenna's books and always enjoyed them but this series, in which a team of characters set about instigating a revolution to overthrow the warring feudal barons whose actions have devastated their country is the best so far. An exciting mix of action and politics taking place in a well realised world ( that has been the setting for a lot of other novels, which you don't have to have read, but if you have this will build up some familiar characters ) the thing which really impressed me was that intensity that these books created- the pressure picks up in the first quarter of the first book and it simply doesn't let off until the very end of the trilogy. Three books at maximum intensity. An impressively unputdownable achievement.

<strong>Ancillary Justice - Anne Leckie</strong>
This is one that you have probably heard of, albeit largely for the genderless society it describes ( everyone is simply termed 'she' ) rather than the storyline. I do enjoy a bit of space opera and this was very good but something about it didn't quite blow me away and I'm not entirely sure what.  However I do remember at the time that it reminded me somewhat of something between Iain M Banks and Ursula Le Guin's sci fi, which is not a bad place to be. I certainly plan to pick up the other books in the series in future.

<strong>Song Of The Earth/Trinity Rising - Elspeth Cooper</strong>
I enjoyed Song Of The Earth- the story about the young man raised by templars then condemned as a witch and his adventures and escape was a little bit familiar in places, but well executed and brisk reading. However when I got the next in the series, Trinity Rising, we started to learn more about the world and meet characters in different regions- the northern barbarian clans with scottish names, the fiery fanatics of the southern desert and the long-lived and magically inclined elfin folk of the forest - and I suddenly realised I was on main street of lazyworldbuildingville. Not to mention the ""evil just because"" antagonist. Now I acknowledge that sometimes the way you pick up existing ideas and reshape them is an important skill in its own right, but I just didn't feel that happening with this series. Interestingly <lj user=""herecirm""> picked up the first one and gave up very quickly.

<strong>God's War - Kameron Hurley</strong>
So at the other extreme we have a novel set on a planet where two sides are fighting an endless war in the name of religion in which women go out to fight and the core technology is based on insects controlled by magicians. This was an utterly, strikingly, original setting. Absolutely ideal, right? Well... the problem I had was that I couldn't find a character to hook onto. I loved the setting and the style and the imagination, but the main character was so busy being a relentless hardbitten bad-ass that I simply couldn't get any kind of handle on her. The other characters also lacked whatever quality it is that brings me to engage with them, possibly along with the fact that it was hard to believe any of them were going to survive for long. So there were lots of things that I really liked, but the story didn't draw me in. It wasn't quite an ""awful things happen to awful people"" narrative, but it certainly leant that way.

<strong>Tea With The Black Dragon - R A Mackavoy</strong>
This is an old book, set in the early 1980s and dealing with silicon valley as it was then, which makes it something of a period piece by now. In essence it is a short, beautifully constructed, character study with a background thriller and a little bit of magic as well. I enjoyed it and I think quite a few people reading this would, but I can imagine it may not be for everyone. 

<strong>The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms - N K Jemisin</strong>
This book was interesting and different- the setting is a world-spanning empire controlled by a royal house who took their power from imprisoned gods and most of the story takes place in their palace hanging high above the capital city of the kingdoms as an outsider princess finds herself drawn into the dangerous machinations of the royal house. The world was a little hard to get a handle on but it was worth the effort. It managed to pull a couple of totally unexpected but absolutely coherent twists on me, which is relatively hard to do and something I delight in. As a standalone book it is a little on the short side, but I believe a omnibus of all three books in the trilogy is available and that would be a worthwhile acquisition.

I did suffer a bit of a reading hiatus in the summer, partly because I had to do some technical reading to get up to speed on stuff for my new job ( the best parts of which were <i>Eloquent Ruby</i> and <i>The Design Of Everyday Things</i> ) and partly because I ordered a bunch of books from my local Waterstones who proceeded to take nearly three months <i>not to get them in</i> - this is the only major highstreet book shop left in the country and in three months they couldn't get a couple of books in to order. When I left the job I cancelled the order and bought them through Amazon instead. They arrived within the week.

<strong>Range Of Ghosts - Elizabeth Bear</strong>
This is the first book of a series in a setting based around central Asian mythology and it is flipping awesome. I have always enjoyed fantasy that steps away from the standard northern European forms, something I was strongly reminded of when I read Saladin Ahmed's excellent <i>Throne Of The Crescent Moon</i> last year. This is the story of the grandson of the great khan and begins directly after a major defeat in a war of succession which he only just survived. It has Rocs and wizards and a giant tiger lady and armies of ghosts and - as one might expect from a Mongolian setting - some excellent horses. I'm certainly going to buy the sequels to this one and I'm already looking forward to reading them. Strongly recommended.

<strong>Cold Magic - Kate Elliott</strong>
I just finished this one and so maybe it is super-fresh in my mind but it has so many of the things I want to read about going on that it's crazy. We're in a 19th Century Europe where the last ice age persisted, magic works and things are culturally very different. There is radicalism and technological progress in the air, but the ruling princes and  cold-mage houses are seeking to maintain the status quo. You'll notice that I've gone almost as long as some of my other mini-reviews just describing the setting, and that's before I've got to the characters and the way they develop and the trouble they get into and the things they learn and the way that every time a question is answered two more questions are raised and the way it's fun and sophisticated but also maintains a sense of humour and probably it's going to be quicker if you just get the book. Also I edited out a whole lot more where I realised I was just explaining the history of the setting because it's so great. Recommended <i>to the highest degree.</i>

So that was my year's reading and I have enjoyed reading a lot of books that I might not otherwise have gone to the effort of seeking out. There are certainly writers here who I am going to look for other books by. I think the main thing that this year has reminded me of is little to do with gender and a lot to do with the sheer amount of good genre fiction that is being published at the moment. I have also found Twitter to be a very good way of keeping up with authors and of finding interesting recommendations- I will tend to pay more attention to the recommendations of a writer whose work I admire and through the last year I have found a whole more of those, which counts as a good thing."

"event","Kathleen was one of the first clinicians I ever <a href=""http://glenatron.livejournal.com/99517.html"">wrote an LJ report about</a> and seven years on from that, it was nice to ride with her. We've both progressed a lot in that time- Kathleen was very much teaching like Mark Rashid who she had been travelling with for a few years prior to working in her own right. Since then she has been studying with a lot of different teachers including people like Martin Black and Buster McLaury, focussing lately on Buck and Jeff Sanders ( that guy again ) so very much travelling in the direction that I want to be. Because she has a background in English riding and jumper hunting she also has more in common with the average rider here than many trainers who come directly from that western tradition, so she is in a good position to bring concepts across.

<lj-cut text=""Clinic write-up, some pictures"">We started each day with an hour of groundwork, with everyone working on different things- as a general exercise Kathleen suggested people work on a pattern she calls ""the dance"" but which I know as ""falling leaf"" where you send the horse forward in a semi-circle, yield the hindquarters then turn the shoulders around the hindquarter and send them forward in the opposite direction. One should be able to do this while walking steadily forward so the horse is constantly coming forward and around.

The exercise is useful because it includes directing the horse forwards, controlling the hindquarters and controlling the shoulders separately. That is a lot of what you need to have working in order to have a good connection to the horse's feet.

Iris and I have worked on that quite a bit, so we were working on trying to balance out her feet a little and make sure her inside shoulder doesn't always fall in. Kathleen is very analytical and she suggested paying very close attention to where she was getting stuck so that we could find the exact point and free her up. She observed that even when the shoulders were getting level, her back end was dragging, which gave us things to work on. Over the next two days we worked more on developing side pass on the ground. I realised that Iris tends to get stuck on her right shoulder ( which is more developed than the left ) and that by focussing on moving that I could get a lot more activity in general, which was interesting.

Over the course of the clinic there were quite a few things that came up and rather than going through it session by session I'll try to pick out a few of the important ones and comment on them a little.
<h3>Unlocking The Shoulders</h3>
Kathleen observed that whenever she comes here she sees a lot of horses that are really locked up in their left shoulder. Her suggestion is that this comes from the standard British way of leading, holding the rope under the horse's chin and standing close in to them. Because this is traditionally done from the left it is almost inevitable that horses handled this way will end up getting stuck in that shoulder. 

Any time a horse is pushing on the bit they are also pushing down onto their shoulder- our job in working with them is to ask those shoulders to lift, raising the base of the neck and placing the horse in correct carriage. Consequently most tools and approaches that involve strapping something to the bit - particularly draw reins- also cause the horse to drop their shoulder. This is partly a consequence of the angle of operation- a flat or downward pressure will ask the horse to lower themselves- the rider's hands can offer more of a lifting feel, but none of the standard tie-down tools can do this.

This is also an area where one has to really experiment around to find what will work with the current horse- if you get firm too quickly you don't give them a chance to come through, if you ask too softly and don't firm up an older horse will probably ignore you. Finding the balance is a matter of testing and finding what works with this horse.

Working in balance is not easy for a horse because it requires them to use different muscles to their day today meanderings in the field, consequently we need to allow them to build up to be physically able to work this way. 
<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/14802362144"" title=""Kathleen Lindley Beckham by Ben Moxon, on Flickr""><img src=""https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2913/14802362144_1a56ba1851_z.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""480"" alt=""Kathleen Lindley Beckham""></a>
Kathleen riding Danny - normally she doesn't ride people's horses in clinics, but here she was just testing to see what his regular rider was feeling and to help him pay a little more attention to the bit.

<h3>The Axes Of A Horse</h3>
When I was working with Iris, Kathleen talked about how a horse works on two axes - the feet and the topline. At first you need to be working with the feet so that your horse can follow the direction of the rein ( something a lot of people here find very hard to do ) and body. Once that is reliable - which is where Iris and I are at - you can start working on the topline. 

Maintaining a soft feel, asking the horse to lower or raise their head without locking up their neck and developing relaxed lateral flexion are all steps towards releasing the topline.

To my horror on the second day of the clinic I picked up the rein a couple of times and got a totally dead feel back, Iris just holding the bit and not responding. I was baffled because <i>don't pull on me</i> has been the law for as long as I have owned her, but after thinking for a while I realised that on our <a href=""http://glenatron.livejournal.com/277297.html"">epic walk to the clinic</a> I had spent some time leading her on the mecate with the reins hooked over the saddle horn and because she was dragging behind that would have ended up creating a pull against the rein in her, so I had totally inadvertantly taught my horse to pull. I was gutted about this, but actually by the next day she seemed to have let go of the idea, so hopefully it wasn't too deeply engrained.

Iris does not want to be a saddle horse today - for some reason she decided the last day was the time to show off her heels a little.

Using lateral flexion to ask her to soften and engage her hind end a little.

<h3>Collect Data</h3>
With all the horses, but particularly with Anne's mare Heidi who reacts very badly to trot transitions, Kathleen was very focussed on collecting information about what brings about changes and what affects the horse. With Heidi she suggested Anne avoid using her legs altogether for the transition and so on, narrowing it down to a response to the rider's left leg. 

Kathleen told us that when she takes horses in for retraining, she is often simply collecting information for the first thirty days or so. Then she knows enough to be able to decide what to do next. Obviously that isn't quite so possible in a clinic environment, but the very analytical approach is certainly informative.


<h3>Following A Feel</h3>
With quite a few of the horses the topic of following a feel came up, the importance of the horse being able to follow the lead rope when it is picked up in whichever direction it is moved. This follows through to how well a horse will respond to the rein and how well they tie up. Kathleen puts a lot of importance on having horses that tie up nicely- she uses a series of steps to teach them to tie calmly and safely ( including <a href=""http://naturalhorsesupply.com/tying.shtml"">using a high line</a> ) and particularly to be aware they can move their feet while tied but not pull back, which is where most problems arise. 

One of the horses who had most trouble following a feel was Ozzy, a young appaloosa belonging to our clinic organiser. He had recently been off to be started and done tremendously well, but then they had got in some trouble when he came home and some of the work was around getting him ready to ride again. Ozzy was quite happy to lean on a lead rope and just try to ignore it. This type of bracing against direction is a good indicator of not being ready to ride and Kathleen observed that ideally she would get him ponying off a saddle horse. As I happened to have a saddle horse there ( albeit one whose entire ponying experience was a couple of circuits with the mule ) I offered Iris for the job and Kathleen ended up using my mare as a work horse to get Ozzy ponying, which was a useful exercise for both of them.

Ozzy doing a way better job - the first part of developing this was to explain to Iris that even though he was young and insolent she didn't need to be threatening him with her back end or trying to kick him, she could let Kathleen worry about the pony and concentrate on following her direction. Once she figured out that she had a job to do, she was pretty great about it.

It was really nice to be riding with someone who is teaching the good stuff and having had two clinics ( my year's supply for this year ) within a fairly short period has set me up with plenty of homework for the year ahead. This time next year, I hope to have a horse who is consistently soft and relaxed through her topline and able to move smoothly from forward into lateral movement with no loss of power."

"event","We're starting this week riding on a clinic with Kathleen Lindley. Because this was happening really close to home I figured we could just ride over there. <i>About three hours</i>, I thought, <i>I can probably get by with just the GPS mapping stuff</i> I thought.
<lj-cut text=""Six hours of getting lost in the Home Counties wilderness"">
In fairness, the GPS was full of Ordnance Survey mapping data, so it wasn't too impractical to use it instead of a map, which would be a lot bigger and I didn't really have an easy way to carry. I really should have thought of water, though, that's actually quite obvious.

So we set out from the back of the farm. Actually we started through one gate, then found another gate we couldn't open because it was closed with a stuck shackle, then realised the cows were in the next field with an open gate and coming over to lick us and annoy Iris. I dashed over to close that gate, got there just in time and then went back and unlocked the other gate. At this point I found that even without being shackled the catch on the gate simply didn't work, so there was no way to empty it. 

I set off to go around the long way to the back field and passed the farmer who owns the cows. He was probably nonplussed to find his cattle shut away in the back field, but to be honest I blame whoever is responsible for maintaining the gates. As it was I figured they would let the cows out again so we meandered through the alternate route to the back field ( past Cash and the Mule, who called to us a lot, and finally made it to the back gate. 

All this before leaving the farm.

Once we were through all the closed gates I was able to hop on and our adventure began...

Riding up beside the dual carriageway. We then went through a tunnel under this road. Iris was not sure about the noise of it.

We found the first track I was looking for and set off on the bridleway. It passed some fairly nice houses.

<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/14593259488"" title=""The Temple Of The Four Winds by Ben Moxon, on Flickr""><img src=""https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3848/14593259488_b6e851efe3_z.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""480"" alt=""The Temple Of The Four Winds""></a>
From the Temple Of The Four Winds on Gibbet hill. Quite disappointing to reach this point from where I was because I could have got there way more easily on a slightly different route.

Still a beautiful location.

We made our way down the hill and ran into the main problems that we encountered repeatedly on our expedition. Firstly some tracks were very badly marked, so it really wasn't clear which ones were bridleways and secondly many of them were also blocked by fallen trees. We would make our way down a track leading to exactly where we wanted to go only to find trees, uncleared since the storms in December, totally blocking our way and have to go back and find another route. Luckily the GPS mapping was pretty good for finding us, so it wasn't too hard but there were false starts and a couple of times we had to leave the track and at one point I was leading her straight through the woods with her having to step very high over tangles of fallen branches to avoid tree trunks.

We passed through the village of Grayswood, where Iris made small children and an older lady happy by being a beautiful dapply grey horse who stopped to say hello and be a little bit confused by cricket. Then we made our way on to find a track through some Forestry Commission land that would take us across the next part of our route.

We wound into the woods ( after a slight diversion ) and then followed narrow muddy tracks through the forest and over small wooden bridges of which Iris <i>strongly</i> disapproved. After a long brambly stretch the trail opened out:
<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/14593188370"" title=""Forestry track by Ben Moxon, on Flickr""><img src=""https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3906/14593188370_ed62bf7632_z.jpg"" width=""480"" height=""640"" alt=""Forestry track""></a>
At this point it would have been nice to stretch out somewhat but because I knew we had a few miles to do, I kept things steady. 

Unfortunately the track didn't come out quite where I expected ( another poorly signed tracks moment ) so I found myself coming out on a different road to where I expected and not entirely clear how to get back on track. It was at this point that the GPS batteries went flat. 

I followed the road I had found myself on up to the main road nearby, then having looked both ways, decided I was probably further east than I needed to be and turned right. The road was quite major so we trotted to get out of the way of traffic faster. After a few hundred yards it became quite enclosed and I realised we were coming up to the Lythe Hill Hotel and Spa, way further west than I expected. With the road busy and narrow I cut straight through the hotel and out onto a track behind it that seemed to be going roughly in the right direction.

<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/14756904286"" title=""Towards Blackdown by Ben Moxon, on Flickr""><img src=""https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3908/14756904286_7ce29b491c_z.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""480"" alt=""Towards Blackdown""></a>
After a couple of false starts we found a bridleway and I decided to turn right on it, thinking that would take us towards Blackdown and the last major section of our journey.

In fact, I was once again going completely the wrong way, but this time we were onto a winner because just the other side of a little valley we found a small yard whose owners were at home ( everywhere seemed strangely dead on Saturday ) and as it was a very warm day I asked them if I could steal a bucket of water for my horse and they ended up giving me some water too, which I was really appreciating as I had neglected to bring any and we had been going for a good four hours by this point.

They also told me that to get to Blackdown I would need to go back the way I had come through the valley and then in the opposite direction on that bridleway. I was genuinely grateful for this. 

We found our way out onto the road and then up onto the down in the late afternoon sunshine. It had been a very long day and Iris was very tired. When we reached the car park I got off and lead ( I had done a lot of leading previously too when tracks got too narrow or tricky and when we hit awkward gates and bridges ) and we walked together up the track onto the heath. The view from the top was pretty great, though:
<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/14777544634"" title=""The view from blackdown by Ben Moxon, on Flickr""><img src=""https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3870/14777544634_08e80fb43e_z.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""480"" alt=""The view from blackdown""></a>

Iris was really starting to drag by now and I ended up switching over to her halter, which I had carried on the saddle the whole way. We stopped for a bite of grass a couple of times but I really felt that our objective was in sight and I was tired and keen to get there too, so I pushed us on.

After a while I figured we must be in nearly the right place and we set off down a track that started out looking like a bridleway but then got narrower and narrower until we were pushing through bracken and brambles in single file. Just after its narrowest squeeze we reached another path and I turned downhill. This lead us down for a long time before we hit a road. At that point I called my friend who is hosting the clinic and she told me what to look out for and after I described what I was seeing, that I was going the wrong way and should turn back. We went back to the point where we had joined the road and about five metres further along there was another track down the hill, that matched my friend's description perfectly - we were nearly there.

Of course, Iris had no idea about any of this, but she steadfastly - if slowly - ambled along behind me.

<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/14799768643"" title=""Nearly there by Ben Moxon, on Flickr""><img src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5562/14799768643_06cd85dfc4_z.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""480"" alt=""Nearly there""></a>
This was around the point I realised I actually knew the track we were on. The last mile or so was hard going but at least I felt confident in our direction and eventually we arrived at my friend's yard.

We had gone about fifteen miles and it took us six hours. For us, that was a long trip. I realise that a bunch of you have done endurance and laugh in the face of such miniscule distances but it certainly seemed like hard work to us, particularly the demoralising process of finding blocked trails, trying other trails and finding those blocked too.

It was the first time I think I have really used riding as a way to get between two places, rather than going out for circular trail rides where home was never that far away, and it certainly felt different.

I was very proud of my beautiful, brilliant mare, who did a sterling job from start to finish.

The expedition also had a really unfortunate side effect which I will probably talk about later.

"event","Last weekend was our <a href=""http://www.silversand.com.au"">Silversand</a> clinic with Steve Halfpenny for the year. He stayed back in Australia last year, so this was the first time I have been able to ride with him for some time- although I took Cash to a clinic in 2012 he wasn't ridable so last time I actually spent much time horseback with Steve was three years ago.

One of the things that is interesting about Steve is that he never stands still - he is always working to improve his own horsemanship and recently he has been learning with <a href=""http://www.californiabridlehorse.com/about/jeff-sanders"">Jeff Sanders</a> and <a href=""http://www.manolomendezdressage.com/"">Manolo Mendez</a> which has helped him develop into even more refinement. The great thing is that having ridden with these top level riders, Steve has the skills to see exactly what they are doing ( which is not always the same as what people say, or even believe, they are doing ) and the ability to translate that into a version that is comprehensible to us mere mortals.

If you look back through my <a href=""http://glenatron.livejournal.com/tag/clinics"">clinics tag</a> you will notice that I used to do epic write-ups of clinics going through the work we did and the progress we made in great detail. 

I'm afraid I don't do that as much these days, partly because it is immensely time consuming and I don't know that many people read them, but also because these days I am mostly exploring a feeling, which isn't necessarily something I can express in a meaningful way. So instead maybe I'll share some pictures and talk a little about them.
<lj-cut text=""illustrated version"">

We had sunshine and heat for the clinic! In fact it was almost too hot to work some of the time.

<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/14725637881"" title=""Steve Halfpenny Clinic 2 by Ben Moxon, on Flickr""><img src=""https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2927/14725637881_db6ca59d9a_z.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""480"" alt=""Steve Halfpenny Clinic 2""></a>
Steve has been working a lot on riding one-handed and keeping his cues as small as possible- here he's using the lariat to put a little more energy into Baccanal rather than making his physical cues louder. The focus of the clinic was largely around lateral work and connecting our balance closely to the horse.

For contrast Jan was having great fun with Charlie, a classic Dartmoor pony.

Steve found himself a grey horse to ride. He said my horse doesn't lean! Coming from him that is an <i>amazingly</i> big deal. She still gets anxious and braces a little, but we're on the right path and as she gets braver I think we have a long and exciting way to go together.

You can't always judge these things from pictures and a lot of people are very quick to point out the flaws in everything, so I'll just observe that Janet and Finn were showing true collection on a loose rein. He was looking a lot like the Connemara pony most likely to audition for the Spanish Riding School by the end of the clinic.

Having got Ferrum to a good place, Steve suggest people have a sit on him to get a feeling of where he was at. The interesting thing was how differently Ferrum responded to everyone- it was very informative about the different riders.

<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/14542180758"" title=""Steve Halfpenny Clinic 7 by Ben Moxon, on Flickr""><img src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5588/14542180758_ff7b44a1c8_z.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""480"" alt=""Steve Halfpenny Clinic 7""></a>
Iris did so well this clinic. As I got more careful in my aids and worked hard on getting results without trying ( Iris and I both tend to try really hard, which means we end up getting in each other's way ) Iris started to come through really beautifully. We started to get some consistent moments of softness in walk and trot and doing some reflective work with Steve I got some changes of direction that felt absolutely fluid. 

The difficult thing is that I am writing this in words and if you ride and you haven't felt how smooth this stuff is then you would probably think you have experienced something like it, but I doubt there is a rider in ten thousand that has. It's on a different level to anything I have experienced with horses in any other setting. You use the words and people think they understand them but the limits of language and expression mean that you can't adequately communicate the most important things. It is very frustrating.

Kerin's mare Lottie was so happy to come out of retirement that she offered some beautiful work.

This was our last clinic at this venue, which we have been using since 2008, and I think it was the best one too. I have ridden with some excellent trainers over the years and I have watched a lot of others at work, Steve Halfpenny is the best trainer I have ever seen. This was a brilliant and inspiring clinic and has really opened the door to a lot of new opportunities to go deeper into this whole thing that comes of having given oneself to horses.

"event","I haven't updated here for the longest time, which makes me a bad imaginary internet friend and I do apologise. The reason is mostly that I have been very busy with layers of busyness on top of further busyness. This is not a thing of which I am proud but it accurately describes where I am at right now. And so, from busyness, onto business. The first order of which is: A grey mare!

It is now slightly over a year since Iris arrived and it would be accurate to say that every time I ride her she gets a little bit better. 

We haven't done as much as we probably should have in the last few weeks, which is absolutely my fault, but whenever we ride out she is forward and willing and sweet. Sometimes we have to stop and stare at ghosts for long periods ( and then either sneak past on tiptoes or crawl past with our belly most of the way to the ground ) and she is prone to moments of inexplicable doubt regarding everyday things like walkers or signposts, but by and large she is as good as I could possibly wish her to be and often better. Since Marty Mule came to stay she has seemed a little jealous of him, I think he spends most of his time playing with Cash and she is far too dignified for such antics, which has actually made her a lot more affectionate towards me. She seeks me out in the field and asks for my attention and for scratches too. It's very sweet.

Under saddle she is calm and accepting of the aids in general, but we have a way to go before we achieve real softness although she is starting to get a handle on it and certainly in the school I can do all the steering I need to by looking where I want to go. She accepts the bit way better than she used to ( but at first she was terrible at that, so although she is probably a five out of ten now, she was a minus-three when we started ) but she still has a bit of pull there and I don't always get down to her feet as quickly as I maybe should. These are all work-in-progress things, however, and she certainly feels like a really good riding horse right now. I just know that given another year of steady work she will be an extraordinary riding horse.

I would like to take her out on more adventures, but right now the horsebox is being repaired for it's MOT, and by ""repaired"" I mean ""having the chassis almost entirely rebuilt because it was so rusty throughout"" which will doubtless be inordinately expensive, but hopefully should get us back on the road to ride with Steve Halfpenny and Kathleen Lindley next month, which I am very much looking forward to..."

"event","Marty Mule is an interesting character. He learns things very quickly and <i>very specifically</i>. So for example when I was asking him to load, he figured out that he needed to put one foot on the ramp, then a second ( because I moved the goalposts quick enough in that respect ) but he also learned to do it standing diagonally on the ramp and looking away from the lorry and once he had that idea, anything else was <i>doing it wrong</i>. We actually loaded him by changing strategy somewhat and having <lj user=herecirm> lead him in while I added a bit of energy behind him.

Last night we put him out with Cash and Iris ( cue mule being chased around the place ) and things seemed relatively calm this evening although the horses were still arbitrarily deciding to chase him.

I want to make being caught and being around humans a more positive experience after his initial couple of days of loading and then travelling, which was inevitably traumatic. My plan for the evening was to bring him in and give him some dinner. 

The first task was to catch him in the larger area. That wasn't too bad because firstly he only walks off and secondly when he did decide to go and hang out with the horses they chased him back to where I was. It took a long time but we kept things pretty calm and nobody felt the need to charge about. Then we moved on to step two, which was to head over to the gate. Of course the moment Cash took an interest Marty McFlightAnimal reacted way more strongly to me asking Cash to leave us alone than Cash did. We spent a little while on getting him comfortable with any degree of movement from the rope. He's a sensitive little soul and I don't think anyone had really done any desensitisation type work with him, so I had to start out very quiet. He seemed to get the idea quite quickly though, and he didn't mind other people getting out of our way.

We got to the gate of the field ( a simple hook-on electric fence gate ) and that was really where the trouble started. The problem was that Marty couldn't go through the fence. In his clever mule brain, he knew where the fence was and he knew that the fence would zap him and that was a matter of mathematics and geometry and had nothing to do with the electric tape. He could not cross that line. Meanwhile Cash and Iris were circling like mostly harmless but vaguely irritating sharks, which put him more on edge in case they bullied him and put me on edge in case they made a break for freedom. The mule starts running backwards. I persuade him to stop but now I am stretched between the gate and the mule. If I let go of one the horses get out and cause havoc, if I let go of the other, there is an unsupervised mule on a halter and also I can't ever let go while he is pulling or he'll figure out that pulling works and life will be way harder than it needs to be. In the end I got him to step up a little, but not enough to close the gate, put the lead down carefully and closed the gate. Exit mule at full gallop, pursued by a lead rope.

After a very brisk circuit of the field, with no escape from said rope, Marty came to a stop and I went over and caught him again. He was actually quite superficially calm, but he is a lot tense most of the time so I can't guarantee that this appearance means much. I gave him a bunch of time to think things over ( I give him more thinking time than I usually offer horses because he seems to need it, often he will start to soften and work his mouth a minute or more after the last thing I asked him for ) and I touched him with the tail of the rope a bit so he could see that it didn't want to harm him, then we did some simple leading work. I finished by leading him over to the fence and giving him some handfuls of fresh grass I could reach from underneath it. It wasn't exactly giving him dinner, but it was hopefully at least on the right lines. He stayed with me when I took the halter off, so I think maybe we finished on reasonable terms. 

I didn't like to see him bothered like that by the lead rope, but there was a chance it would have happened sooner or later in any case- I have suffered enough rope burns that I let go pretty fast these days and I don't yet have the finesse to be sure that won't happen somewhere along the path. He figured out that he didn't need to run away from it and we ended up on a good note. As with everything at this stage, it is a learning process for both of us."

This weekend has been quite singular, however- we set out with a single goal and went out and achieved it. Specifically the outcome was this:
<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/13830475775"" title=""arrival day by Ben Moxon, on Flickr""><img src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7198/13830475775_93a6ff7ab4.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""371"" alt=""arrival day""></a>

The process we underwent was to travel to Dartmoor ( approximately 160 miles, as far as I can tell ) yesterday, meet Marty the Mule, train him to load and bring him back with us today.

It was an interesting experience and I've certainly had some time to find out the differences between a mule and a horse, but the little guy is unbelievably cute and very smart and he came through great, although we took a while longer than we would have with a horse. 

Also he didn't think much of travelling and decided he needed to make his own bid for freedom by climbing over the breast-bar of the lorry. Luckily he didn't actually achieve freedom, but we had some anxious moments while he stood with his front legs over the bar trying to hop forwards while I performed the full ""YOU SHALL NOT PASS"" with a stick and string in front of him until he backed off. It was a stomach-droppingly anxious moment. After we tried to create a more visual barrier and he attempted to clamber out again, this time ably averted by <lj user=herecirm>, we turned him to face forwards and he travelled better the rest of the journey home, although he was still pretty anxious.

So now we have a mule, or specifically Sari does, and we have the adventure of teaching him to be a riding mule. It's been a rocky start, but he's a smart little guy and hopefully he'll give us the chance to show him we're friends really."

"event","On Sunday I finally managed to do something I have wanted to try for the last five years and actually rode my horse to cattle here in the UK.

There aren't many places that one has the opportunity to do that in this country - the only one I know of is <a href=""http://www.rodeocowboys.org.uk/"">Bar S in Kent</a> who are about seventy miles away, so when I saw they had a cattle clinic there I booked myself onto it for mid January. Then it rained for the entirety of December, January and most of February and they were pretty much too wet to do anything. Last weekend was the first time that they actually had any dry enough space to ride in and as it was the going was quite muddy but workable.

We unloaded and it was nice to be around a group of friendly western riders with a common interest in trying some practical western riding rather than the showing disciplines which are most of what one sees here. 

The specific event we were working with was ranch sorting, where people work in a figure 8 pen with numbered cattle and two riders. The goal is to get as many cows as possible from the pen with the herd in to the other, in numeric order. One rider typically maintains the gateway and makes sure that no previously sorted cows come back, the other rides into the herd and sorts out the numbered cows then guides them to the gate. Letting an out-of-order cow through is an instant disqualification and the game has a tight time limit.

As the most total n00b there, I was teamed up with Stuart, who owns the ranch and was consequently excellent at sorting and moving the cows. We watched from the side of the ring while everyone else had a try - Iris with her ears fixed on the cows - and very quickly ( ninety second rounds go by quickly ) it was our turn. 

First time around we just worked on being able to approach cows and move through them, which Iris thought might be impossible. We were better on the gate in our second round, because that mostly required a bit of forward and backwards, which we can usually manage, although the day did make me realise our accelerator is a bit sticky. With Stuart sorting cows out and us keeping them sorted ( and moving to cut off other cows from diving through ) we got a lot through, though I don't think that speaks ever so much of my skill. On our second attempt at sorting we managed to get a single cow out and through the gate, although it took us a lot more time than the round limit, nobody minded and the whole atmosphere was very much of supporting people at improving.

The third time we went into the herd, something clicked with Iris and she realised that she was here to chase these cows and that they would move when she moved them. Everything changed in a moment- suddenly she was enthusiastically pushing the cows around and turning quickly to mark them once I made it clear to her which one we needed to beat. There was no longer any feeling of heaviness to our steering or transitions and we were able to get several cows through - in fact I think we were allowed quite a lot of extra time because Iris had so clearly cottoned on to her job and was doing so well. 

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/13089330173/"" title=""Iris and cows by Glenatron, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7421/13089330173_1946dfef62.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""Grey mare and cows""></a>
Iris having figured out what I was trying to ask her to do.

After lunch we went back out and when I was tacking up Iris attention was already fixed on the arena where we were going to be working and after that our rounds got smoother and way more effective, although there were one or two moments where she got a bit over-excited and kicked a cow that was passing behind her, so we might have to explain that isn't a great strategy. 

I had a really fun day and Iris seemed to enjoy it too. It certainly reinforced my view that if you have the chance to work cattle with your horse, regardless of your normal discipline, it is well worth taking.

It made me so proud of my horse and so impressed with her ability to turn herself to anything I ask of her, she really is about the best mare that a person could possibly wish for. I am already planning to go back next month for their next cattle clinic."

"event","Having been at a funeral today and hearing about the death of Pete Seeger - another twentieth century hero - I was reminded of something I have started to think about when I listen to Radio Four's <i>Last Word</i>. 

<a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qpmv""><i>Last Word</i></a> is a show that picks up on some of the people who have died in the preceding week, often people somewhat out of the public eye or widely forgotten, and provides a bit of detail about their lives and what marked them out. 

For a long time, it used to make me sad to hear these stories, a sense of the world losing remarkable people who had achieved extraordinary things in their lives, that we are all poorer for their absence. Then one day I thought ""what if there was a show that could describe the amazing things that will be achieved by babies born in this week?"" Now in addition to letting me learn about interesting people whose stories would otherwise have passed me by, <i>Last Word</i> gives me hope."

"event","I've been hella busy with some freelance work stuff over the last few weeks, especially as for a fortnight starting on December 21st we lost power for some part of every day. When you are trying to work on a computer from home, routinely losing electricity and internet connectivity for up to three days at a stretch makes things difficult. Also our house is electrically heated, so it got a bit nippy after a while.

Anyways, there were some pictures I intended to post then and failed, so here they are:
<lj-cut text=""illustrated version"">
<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/11844824193/"" title=""Watery trail by Glenatron, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2889/11844824193_4d132354e2.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""Watery trail""></a>
Making our way down a watery trail. The arena at the yard is going to be a swamp for a long time, so everything will be trail rides for a while. Not so bad when the weather holds like this.

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/11844822713/"" title=""Beside Hankley Common by Glenatron, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5501/11844822713_723c0320d7.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""Beside Hankley Common""></a>
This route produced many photographs in which either Iris or the background was in focus, but never both. No idea why. Here we were on a trail we haven't ridden before. Just over the hill on our right was the set for Skyfall Manor in the last Bond movie.

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/11845351246/"" title=""Fallen tree by Glenatron, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2872/11845351246_50fbca240e.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""Fallen tree""></a>
After the storms there were a lot of trees down- this one at least had been cut up- a lot of tracks were still blocked last time we went out.

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/11844833063/"" title=""Hammer mud-flat, Thursley by Glenatron, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5503/11844833063_f9d774851a.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""Hammer mud-flat, Thursley""></a>
This was Hammer Pond - I noticed the absence of a lake the first time I rode past there, but had no camera so Sari accused me of just making the whole thing up. This was photographic evidence. Also involved leading Iris through the woods to the banks of the former pond, where she followed me carefully like a good pony.

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/11844968954/"" title=""Broken Dam by Glenatron, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7439/11844968954_0b3b5271c0.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""Broken Dam""></a>
The pond was artificial and held up by this dam. Or the dam that this used to be before the storm demolished it.

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/11844540375/"" title=""A confusion of horse and sky by Glenatron, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5489/11844540375_a9f6a6737e.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""A confusion of horse and sky""></a>
A confusion of horse and sky. I like how this picture came out because it doesn't make sense at first. 
</lj-cut>

After almost two weeks of rain, we have had a dry day today and another is forecast tomorrow. I hope to go walkabout with my fine mare once more."

Irritatingly, I'm trying to work freelance at the moment and I needed to get a lot done on Tuesday, but with no power or connectivity, that couldn't really happen and yesterday and today have been pretty busy, so I'm going to have to play serious catch-up tomorrow.

Of course, there is another storm expected soon, so that may not happen either.

Maybe if we could find enough climate change denialists and get them together into one place they could disbelieve the storm out of existence. That would be convenient."

<lj-cut text=""Illustrated version"">
<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/11344539366/"" title=""Iris in the stableyard by Glenatron, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3694/11344539366_9bc4b8a4a9.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""Iris in the stableyard""></a>
Iris looking pretty on a sunny morning before a very long, very boring, schooling ride in which we had a lot of conversations about going where she is asked to while out on the trail, rather than deciding that she is definitely going to take the shortest route home. I think it was probably a success, but time will tell.

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/11344554104/"" title=""The mistwood by Glenatron, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3734/11344554104_a2e3d52cc3.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""The mistwood""></a>
Riding up through the misty woods. The other day we had a heavy fog that gradually lifted until it went through a beautiful luminous phase as the sun started to break through. At that point I realised my camera battery was flat, so I ended up waiting a while before going out for a ride and the mist was only hanging on narrowly.

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/11344593293/"" title=""Misty grey ears by Glenatron, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3689/11344593293_4597c597a9.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""Misty grey ears""></a>
Grey ears and a misted field.

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/11344542344/"" title=""out on the punchbowl by Glenatron, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7387/11344542344_cd112bd0f4.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""out on the punchbowl""></a>
We did our first full circuit of the Devil's Punchbowl, which was a reasonable distance and with lots of hill work. Iris comported herself with absolute excellence. The only time she got at all flustered was when there was a big crane thing picking up whole trees and swinging them around and to be fair that was a touch discombobulating. It was a very pleasant ride.

Also the mist was hanging a little on the lower ground and obscuring the hills in the distance so that the world grew and instead of low downland ten miles away they became grand mountains on the far side of a broad plain. A very pleasing effect.

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/11344440785/"" title=""Mare in trot by Glenatron, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7423/11344440785_f9060d4278.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""Mare in trot""></a>
We have been using the school a lot too, as it is still sufficiently dry ( until today it had barely rained in weeks ) and Iris is starting to do some really nice work. I think I'm getting better too, but I feel like my riding has not been up to scratch lately so I'm working very hard at making sure I'm really going with her whenever we work and not getting all caught up and carrying tension that I then convey straight to her.

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/glenatron/11344536724/"" title=""Hitting the brakes! by Glenatron, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3710/11344536724_b96ba6c5c6.jpg"" width=""375"" height=""500"" alt=""Hitting the brakes!""></a>
With some fence work and more cantering since the dressage test a few weeks ago, we're starting to get some reasonable brakes too. She is an absolute joy to work with.

Thursday's storm winds had stripped most of the leaves from the trees, but one birch had held on obstinately, standing out like a candle on the heath.

I like trying to capture the difference in light so that it looks a bit as though Iris has been photoshopped into the picture.

After that ride I was in a super happy mood and went off to teach - actually mostly to put some work in with my student's horse, who has been making some great progress but after a big jump forward during the previous session went through the worst bucking I have seen from her and then reared vertically, at which point I bailed rather than risk her flipping on me. I did a little more groundwork and then got some nice quiet work from her after that, but it was a shame because it put something of a damper on an otherwise excellent day.

Today I finally persuaded <lj user=herecirm> to go for a ride on Iris and my mare was impeccably behaved throughout, very nearly.

The birches and clear blue sky made this part a little bit like riding into a Victorian watercolour painting, something that might be on the cover of a Hardy novel. Except for the traffic noise from the dual carriageway beside the common at any rate. I think this time has a lot to commend it, but I would love to be able to hear how these familiar places sounded a hundred years ago, just to be able to remember it.

Making their way off into the woods. Iris was somewhat vexed by the presence of swans just before this. I think she suffers a general perplexity regarding the existence and meaning of waterfowl.

Or possibly she wants to be a water animal herself and feels they are encroaching.

I just really like the way this shows off her dapples.

Starting up the homeward hill. Iris was a little hurried up here and after a short trot ( and canter ) <lj user=herecirm> asked her to stop, which she wasn't keen on, the to come back towards me ( and <i>away from home</i> ) at which point she put in a pretty serious bucking fit. Sari rode through it and was fine, but it was a real shame because Iris had been <i>so good</i> up to that point, and pretty much was the rest of the time too.

Iris has some chill out time in which we wait until she can stand nicely and not be all wiggly and hyperactive.

Two forms of transport, a hundred years apart, similar colour scheme. The church would I suppose have seen more horses than cars in the nine hundred years it has stood here.

"event","The last week or two the swamp at our yard has returned to it's summertime status of arena, so I've done bits of schooling with Iris. After reading <a href=""http://www.brindisiequestrian.com/1/post/2013/11/the-secret-life-of-bones-reflections-on-training-injury-the-equine-skeleton-as-dynamic-living-tissue.html"">this piece on skeletal injuries</a> I was very conscious that we need to work on our correctness a little, so for the last few days I have been working with real focus on softness and balance.

As ever Iris comes through beautifully- she is starting to learn to release her poll, which gives the chance for softness to start reaching through her body ( I have an idea that relaxation in a horse stops at the first brace, so if they are resistant in their mouth it won't reach back to their poll, if they are tight in the poll they won't be relaxed down their neck and so on ) and that smoothness to start permeating her movement. I've also been working on straightness around corners and on circles. We have an ongoing dispute about whether she can turn without leaning like a motorbike, but all these things get so much better with time.

I am also acutely aware that I am not really a good enough rider for her, so I'm applying my attention closely to the feel I get through my seat when I ride, what happens to bounce me around and cause me to lose connection with her and what I need to do to correct it; almost always <i>more relaxation in the back</i> and <i>don't let heels creep up</i> - both pernicious and beginnerish habits I should have long since shifted. Unfortunately I don't learn to change a quarter as fast as Iris does, so it's very much an ongoing effort, but I am confident that if I can keep my focus and remain mindful in my riding, I will improve, if gradually. 

Today, as we trotted smoothly and softly through racing clouds of fallen leaves torn from the trees by the winter's first real gale, it felt like we have some pretty awesome places to be. My responsibility is to ensure we reach them."

"event","Over the last few years it has gradually dawned on me that I am a middle aged man now. Once, however, I was a long-haired chump who loved music. 

This started quite suddenly around the time I was 15- I started learning to play guitar and listening to various guitar music ( ahem... much of it was Dire Straits ) and the kind of turn-of-the-nineties cheese rock that was the thing at the time. Later I discovered U2 and it blew my mind a bit because here was a band playing guitar in a way that I could ( sort of almost ) emulate and yet they were a real band making real records. That was a pretty exciting thing to discover. In the autumn of 1991 I got a copy of <i>Achtung Baby</i> and REM's <i>Out Of Time</i>, which are probably my favourite records by both bands and I started to realise that what I really wanted was music that touched my heart and carried me away with the ideas it conveyed.

In 1992 I finished my GCSEs and left school for sixth form college. This was a big deal because until then I had really spent my time with school friends who I had been around in many cases through the preceding two schools, so it was very much a male group and I basically didn't know much about being around girls. At sixth form I began hanging out with a new social group, including some friends I had made later in secondary school and finally I was in the company of girls too. Obviously I immediately fell in love with everyone I met and was horribly, cringeworthily embarrassing ( and self conscious, and embarrassed ) as I now realise is the fate of all teenagers at some point. 

So suddenly my life was a heady social whirlwind full of amazing rollercoaster highs and lows. I was a total idiot, but it was so exciting- I still clearly recall the unbelievable intensity and somewhere I retain notebooks full of terrible poetry and lyrics from those days which are the closest thing I have to a diary.

As 1993 began as this social group began to take form and it's fair to say that it was the most amazing year of my life to that point. Luckily it was also an excellent year for music, so I had a great soundtrack. Maybe everyone has an amazing soundtrack to some equivalent period of their life, but this is mine.

The year began with me mostly listening to records from the year before, mostly ones I had borrowed from my friend Alf, so it was The Lemonheads with <i>Its A Shame About Ray</i> and Sugar with <i>Copper Blue</i>. I found both of these in a charity shop last summer and they still stand up very well. I had already extracted most of the goodness from <i>Nevermind</i> that I was going to but I was still enjoying <i>Ten</i> - my controversial opinion is that the letter is probably a better album, for all that it wasn't the peak of the zeitgeist. Just at the end of the year my friend lent me the first two Levellers albums and I couldn't believe it- here was a band playing music like the Steeleye Span my parent had played while I was growing up, but modern! It was so cool! They were one of the great unifying bands of my generation- there was only one way of life and that was our own. 

One of the early year records I got in 93 was <i>Sweet Oblivion</i> by Screaming Trees. Mark Lanegan's brilliant, gravelly voice over the dark seventies-tinged rock of the Trees was like a flame to my army-surplus combat-trousers-wearing moth. 

During the spring I had a tape on which I had <i>Are You Normal</i> from Neds Atomic Dustbin on one side and <i>The Looks Or The Lifestyle</i> by Pop Will Eat Itself on the other. The former was alright, but suggested the band were a bit of a one-trick pony, the latter I totally loved- Fuzz Townsend is an amazing drummer and it is baffling to me that the template for mixing dance and rock that PWEI created wasn't really followed up on for another fifteen years or so, though it is more or less the standard for most pop now.

As the year wore on I actually joined a band too. <i>The Way Out Exits</i> were really <i>something</i>. Listening back that something might be terrible, but that's neither here nor there- we were a band playing our own original songs and we were cool because we thought we were. Our singer couldn't sing, I started on guitar but switched to bass after our first practice, none of us could entirely play in time and our drummer was amazing. The first time we practiced we basically played <i>Enter Sandman</i> for three hours. I remember on the drive home ( getting a lift with mum, obviously ) thinking ""yes, this is the real deal!"" It was a late spring evening and the evening light on the water meadows was beautiful.

While I was doing every household chore I could think of in the hope of earning enough money to afford a bass amplifier, I was listening to the old <i>Best Of REM</i> on my personal stereo, building up an affection for <i>So Central Rain</i> and <i>Driver 8</i> that persisted ever since.

In the summer our group of friends went out for a week of camping holiday in Cornwall and it was the best thing ever. Actual best thing ever. On the train down we forgot our tent and one of our group had to go back on an epic adventure to retrieve it. We sat on the beach and drank Thunderbird wine through a straw while our friend Steve narrated farmer stories in a stupid west country accent. I bought a copy of the second Red House Painters album while we were there and it was totally depressing and beautiful and not fitting at all but I loved it. I had a ""Simon and Garfunkel for easy guitar"" book and it turned out our friend Penny had a beautiful voice so we played those songs a lot. Also Levellers songs because those were super easy.

When we got home my parents were away so the band moved in at my house and practiced for a week. During that week, on a trip to town, I got hold of a copy of <i>Fuzzy</i> by Grant Lee Buffalo.  We got a short set together and on the last night we played to our friends. It was the most unbelievably exciting gig I have ever played. I am sure we were terrible but it was awesome fun and gratifying when our friends realised that we actually were a real band playing real songs. It hardly mattered that we were playing them very badly indeed.

We were up all night partying then, and the next day took a lot of tidying up before my parents came home. When the last of my friends left I just broke down and cried for a very long time. I felt as though nothing would ever match up to that fortnight and to an extent I was right. Also I hadn't slept for thirty hours, so I was pretty easy to tip over into an emotional state.

Summer turned to autumn and we went back to college. I passed my driving test ( the day before we went to see the Levellers live ) and suddenly had freedom. It's hard to express how much difference that makes when you live in a village with very poor public transport links. Suddenly you can socialise almost whenever you like. 

During the autumn I bought <i>Together Alone</i> by Crowded House - now I know they are not a very cool band but I still think that is a beautiful record and the production is amazing. It really holds together as a single work of art- each song stands out but everything flows together perfectly. I still listen to that when I want to feel autumnal.

I remember sitting on the old sofa in the new conservatory at Rivendell ( my parents house ) and listening to that album the night I came home from my Biology A Level field trip. That night I decided I didn't want to study Marine Biology at university because that field trip had been agonisingly boring and I couldn't face three more years of that. I had almost sent off my university application form, so I had to tear it up and pick a new subject out of the air. I chose Psychology and Philosophy but in retrospect I'm very glad the Psychology side ended up by the wayside.

The other CD that ruled my listening habits during that autumn was <i>A Slight Case Of Overbombing</i>, the Sisters Of Mercy best of. I now have all of their albums, but I think that best of is actually better than any of the albums. The tracks were remixed and remastered in a way that worked very well and it also has the brilliant <i>Under The Gun</i> as its opening track. It's just a tremendous album from one of the most incendiary songwriters in rock. Of course, half the time you have no idea what he's on about, but man whatever it is it sounds cool.

That Christmas I was given two CDs among my gifts- I can't remember what my main present was, but those CDs have stuck with me - the second Pearl Jam album ( which is, you know, <i>fine</i> ) and <i>Little Earthquakes</i> by Tori Amos which I am listening to right this moment and I have never not loved. In fact when I was at university it was posters of Tori that ruled my walls. I'm not even certain that it's her best album ( The studio version of <i>To Venus And Back</i> might be, or <i>Boys For Pele</i> ) but it is a truly great record.

So that was probably my most intensely formative year. And it was twenty years ago now. I am considerably more than twice the age I was then. But - and maybe any year of this significance would seem the same to someone as music-oriented as I am - looking back from this distance I still can't think of a year that provided a greater haul of amazing albums. Especially if I was to include the records recorded that year which I got later ( <i>Gentlemen</i>, <i>Giant Steps</i>, <i>Siamese Dream</i>, <i>August And Everything After</i> ) and ruled absolutely over the next few years of my musical life."

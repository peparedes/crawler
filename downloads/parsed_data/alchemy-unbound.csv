"event","I have a problem with evangelism. I don't think anyone has the right to tell anyone else what to believe - when it really does all come down to belief, as much as some people would like to say there's incontrovertible proof. 

I have a problem with religion being used to manipulate people - for example, politicians publicising their religion to get votes from other people of the same religion. 

I think that even within organised religions, no one person's interpretation is precisely the same as another's. 

I don't believe that you have to be religious to have a moral code, although I accept the part religion has played in defining what is an acceptable moral code in today's society. I see 'religion' as very separate from morals.

Personally, I don't believe in a god, because I don't have questions about the world that can't be answered in other ways. I'm reluctant to have blind faith in <b>anything</b>. That doesn't mean I think that there is definitely no god or supreme being out there.

One thing organised religion really is useful for is creating a sense of community, and I know some people need that, and I agree that it's a lovely thing. Also, organised religion has produced some of the most beautiful architecture and art, and for that I'm definitely grateful to it. I love religious buildings.

However, because of the tendency of many organised religions to believe they are the only true religion, they have also caused <b>many</b> conflicts, and that's not good. After all, most of them have very similar principles. See my first point...

I think that's actually an appropriate point to stop, because I can't think of sanything else specific that I wanted to say. Comments are welcome on this.

"event","(In this post, I'd like to extend the definition of teenager to include anyone who is at university, or only just in their first job.)

I think teenagers actually cope really well with everything that's expected of them. Thinking about it, there's a lot we have to deal with.

Yesterday 'Feed the World' came on the radio (yes, it's early for christmas songs XP), and it got me thinking - as much as I love my subject, and want to go to university and do a degree, I'm not sure I can just ignore things that are going on around the world. Like famine, disease, poverty - and, personally, I'm not content to just give my money. I've always said I'd much rather give my time than my money. I'm not doing a degree in anything that could actually be helpful with these things, though, and that makes me doubt why I chose that. As much as I love chemistry and everthing it can lead to, it's not going to help people directly. Of course, science comes up with new drugs, new ways of getting energy, and all that... but I'm still not sure if I'm content with that. 

Maybe I'll do something humanitarian after university.

Also, recently, I was discussing climate change with Merrie - and we ended up talking about politics. One of things about being young - I turn eighteen in just over six months - is that you have to start deciding what you believe in, in political terms. Whenever I think about politics, it makes me annoyed enough that I almost want to do it myself!

When I mention belief, obviously religion, or faith, or whatever, is going to come into it somewhere. Personally, I have some firm beliefs and I stick to them, and the idea of being told what to think about the world terrifies me. Part of what I believe is that you can't judge anything until you're in that situation, and you can't judge anything for other people. This is why I disagree with organised religion, although I can see why it is reassuring to some people. The thing is, I don't have firm beliefs about <b>everything</b>, and I'm open to changing my mind. 

I might make a separate post about reigion - this has got me thinking. 

Of course - I don't know why I left this till last - there's sex and sexuality. That's kinda a large part of being a teenager. It's kinda a big part of your identity, too. I think I'm straight - but there's always the possiblity I just haven't met the right girl yet. I've had the odd lapse - like that girl in Holby City who was far more attractive than she should've been, and the guy in Hedwig and the Angry Inch who's hot, but played by a girl. I still consider myself straight, but I'm pretty open minded. For me, personally, it's not a big deal. 

I think what's coming out of this - which is mostly just my though processes put into words - is that being a teenager, or young adult, or whatever, is about finding your identity, discovering who you are. People forget that too often. Hell, I even forgot it. 

It doesn't really matter what you do at school, university, in your job. It doesn't matter who you date or the decisions you make. What matters is the you that comes out at the end. Mistakes, regrets, scars and all - this is our time to live, to experiment, and we should really make the most of it."

"event","I like the internet, and LiveJournal in particular. I've met some really interesting people through it. I'm using interesting in a very wide sense there - some are lovely, some are quiet, some are a little scary and some are just plain confusing. 

But without them, I would have a narrower outlook on life. There's no way I would know these people if it wasn't for the internet. Online there are no barriers of age or gender, or, particularly, space. I know people in America and a guy in Finland. 

So, to the people I might never have known: 

<lj user=""ava_leigh_fitz"">: She's English, and studies (or used to study) Classics, and writes good fic even though I don't know the fandoms ^^ She's in the same school year as me. I think we'd get on in real life, although I might be a little intimidated. 

<lj user=""domety"">: He's Russian, and posts really random comments which are often a little bit scary. It's hard to figure out what he means a lot of the time but it's certsainly and interesting experience talking to him.

<lj user=""dragonbat2006"">: She lives in America, and is in her thirties, married, and Jewish. She also writes Batman fic - again, I don't know the fandom but what I've read of it was very good. 

<lj user=""j0hnnyligament"">: A girl, I think. She likes AFI, draws, and writes original fic which is formatted badly and would make more sense if I knew the background but is good all the same. I like her entries, they're usally pure stream-of-consciousness and they make me smile.

<lj user=""ladybeth"">: I think she's 21, and at college or uni or whatever they call it in America. She likes cats, and Ancient Greek myths. I like her fic idea and wish she'd write more! We end up having really long comment conversations about random things. I think we'd get on well in person, too.

<lj user=""lionheart07"">: She writes CSI fic, which I was supposed to be beta-ing, but I don't think she's written any more since the first two chapters. She seems to like music more than writing, and writes song and listens to System of a Down (who scare me).

<lj user=""nosundays"">: He's part-Finnish part-Indian, but has been going to school in Swaziland. He's eighteen. I think he's gay. He writes beautiful prose that reads like poetry, and takes equally beautiful photographs. I barely know him, but he seems lovely. He calls people ""darling"".
 
<lj user=""sambleu"">: I think Sam is an F-to-M transsexual, and seventeen. I'm not sure. Their posts confuse me, a lot of the time, but they are a member of a GSA which is really cool, and seem nice.

Michelle: I don't know Michelle through LJ. I met her on a mailing list, odd as that sounds, and through Facebook. She's an M-to-F transsexual, and I think she's only fifteen or sixteen. She totally stands up for herself and her beliefs, which rocks.

And of course LJ helps me keep in touch with people I know in person who've left the area. Or during the holidays when everyone is away.

Basically, LiveJournal is great, and so are you guys."

"event","Things are so fragile, so changeable when you're young. I don't see how anyone could hang their life on something as uncertain as love. Maybe that'll change. Maybe everything becomes more solid, more real, as you get older. Although I'm not sure if I want it to or not. 

Some of the most beautiful things are fleeting moments."

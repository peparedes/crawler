"event","My existance is being overlooked by my own life partner. She's chosen to let herself become obsessed, completely consumed with someone she's never even looked in the eye before. When she and I were in the long distance situation this entire looking in the eye would have seemed completely rediculous to me. All we needed were our words, we learned to trust one another and we learned more about each other as the days went making what we had even stronger. The binder was not in the eye contact, it was in the emotion. But why do my thoughts make me feel like a hypocrite now? 

We're together and it's been amazing. After that small  bad patch we went through everything once again felt normal. But it didn't last. It hasn't been able to last too long. As soon as I reach comfort level with us and with what we have everything begins to rock back and fourth. Being intimate consists of she, her needs, her photos of him..and i'm namely the dick supplier. I simply feel that she's taking everything much more overboard. I don't doubt he's not a good person, but i'd hoped that seeing his attainment and devotion with his girlfriend would make Jennifer take a few steps back and accept whatever comes for what it does.

I tried having just one job but when she stopped working, there wasn't much of a choice then to get back to work. If we want to keep everything we have then we need to continue to work hard. It's been some year. A year of adjustments. We've worked hard for this year to get comfortable with each other, I had to adapt to a new environment. A whole new state, city..just everything. It wasn't that difficult though, it was actually great. It's been great and even what happened last December, that didn't change many things but now...now she's talking about how exciting the relationship is going to begin to get and how much fun she and he and the other she are going to have. I feel like i'm losing my girlfriend. Losing her to some sort of magnetic force that's just taken her to far away from me. The harder I reach the more I repel. I'm taking a leave of absense back home for a week. I need to think. I've got all my family in PA and I left all of them for her. Now I wish to go back and clear my head. I love Jennifer. I want to be with her, always. But I need to know if that's what she wants and I can't get the answers while I'm here. Maybe she needs time so she can miss me. 

I'm deathly afraid of what could happen. She could possibly realize I'm not what she really wants. I hope that's not the case. She can do what she wishes as long as she decides to come back. I'm just afraid, she wont."

"event","Arrangements are great. Getting caught up in them isn't so, however. This past week has been fantastic. A fantastic that has began to suck me into the innermost core of solitude. I don't want the distance again. I chose to leave work because Jennifer is more important to me then waiting tables on a daily basis for people who have the money to spend on meals out of home. I thought my having just one job would hint her that I want the time together like it was before. The time together at every instance. Eating together, doing the dishes together, buying two copies of the same book and asking her to read it with me and discussing it with her. Something she's always hated because she hates reading but she did it anyway. Just like I tried sewing her that damned pillow case just to make it even. We'd go to shows. It was fun. Fun in the oddest of way for some people. Lots of couples go 'clubbin' and dancing and to the movies or the mall. The mall is so high school to me and she feels the same way about it to. So why get another job and Work there? I went to see her today at the fucking mall. Where young girls walk around in their much too tight and revealing clothing hoping to talk to boys who are just if not more well groomed then they are who are on the 'hunt' for a quick 3 minute vagina fondling session Monday after school. Kids who walk around parent-less calling it freedom, with no money, with no other worries than who they're going to run into and how fantastic its going to be when they do it again next weekend. It saddens me. Probably because I was never that kind of kid. Probably because I'm too grouchy for my own age and my own good. I grew up with movies, books, playing instruments on and endless and devoted basis not because it was fun but because I wanted to show for the things that I had in my possession and what I did with them. Just..going to the mall is a way of looking into the future of this country. The future and current statistics rest upon the great big malls on those weekends. The tought of a mall itself...its just so irritating. In any case this is my bitch session for tonight. The night I bitch without my girlfriend even though she's to be home any minute now. I probably don't know exactly how she felt while I was gone all those days and for all those hours. But it is very much upsetting to think that she chose work over staying here. Heh, not necesarilly the money so much cause in all senses of the word Fine, that's how we're doing. So, why? Why the leave? I haven't asked. I've yet to but I'm pained at the thought of her saying something that'll break me. I dont want to crumble in front of her and my temper is something I need to work on to control.
Reading back on this entry I dont really understand why the upset is so large on high school kids with no money. But whatever. I'm allowed a few stupid rants in my lifetime."

"event","Worn out is the only way I can describe myself and how I am feeling.

What convinced me to take on the task of working two jobs I'm not so sure anymore. Yes the money is necesarry, it is the only secure way to provide for Jennifer but along with this comes the unbareable realization that I've been providing a lot less of love and support for her. We've been almost like strangers. Shifting from barely being home to hardly ever seeing each other. It seemed like there'd had been a lot of troubling thoughts on her mind, none of which she choose to speak of with me. I can't help but to feel ashamed for the things I've selfishly done to our relationship. These things could have potentially destroyed us both. This morning I got in from work at half past five, I got into bed exhausted and fully ready to give-in to the long awaited and what I felt was a well deserved full night sleep. The small crack from our parted bedroom door let the blue hallway light shine in through the room onto Jen's beautiful face. She was lying on her back, awake but not acknowledging me. She turned her face toward me and then moved her body so that she was now facing me. I touched my hand to her cheek and smiled. Her shoulder quickly shrugged toward her face, her eyes shut painfully.

""You're cold.""  She said in a low, timid voice.

""I missed you, baby."" Her eyes shifted away from mine, onto the ceiling then down to the bed.

""I've missed you for weeks.""  I gently pulled her close to me, she then began to sob. It was then many things came out that had needed to for a long time now. I had to promise everything all over again. I had to gain her trust all over again, as if we were barely starting out and deciding amongst each other where we stood with other people and what we equally wanted to be for one another.

""I watched the disk today. It made me so close to hating you."" Shame. It ran through me entirely. In many ways I felt like I'd robbed different people from different (great) emotions and experiences. I feel like I had imposed in the lives of two nice people, got my way and didn't care if the consequences would have a severe effect on Jen or not. 

I'm almost too broken and embarrassed still, even to go into bed with her right now. Honesty is great. But being honest had never been as difficult as it was the other night. The tears and the apologies were all things I was ready for but the topic that followed...Damnit, I haden't even considered she'd try and get into again. 

""Was she better than me? Was she worth it?""
There's never an easy way to answer that. Better? It couldn't have been. It's hard to distinguish. It leans more toward <i> No </i> although the fact that there's even any hesitation goes to show what a complete weak bastard I am. Worth it? How can I answer that. Worth the pain I put her through and the temporary chilled distance it created between us both? Worth jeopardizing an amazing relationship with an ultimately Incredible young woman, and a potential(and hopefully, still) friendship with the girl's boyfriend? I really had to ask myself, knocking into my head over and over again. Was it worth it? Was it worth it, <i> really </i>?

Almost.

It had started out of innocent curiosity. The fun part of the situation was that we were all supposed to be in on this together. What an asshole this must make me. What a horrible boyfriend I am. <i> Adultry </i>. Fuck, that word sounds horrible. Who's fault was it entirely? Her's? Afterall there were two of us locked in that bathroom in the middle of the night.
No. I honestly don't see her being one to blame. I proceeded this time and time again. I let things go as far as they did. I listened only to the words Jennifer had said paying no attention to her unsure eyes, her trembling broken tone and the forced smiles she'd put upon her face all to; ""Make you happy Mitch.""

Happy. That words turns me brittle. Happy is what we were before the decisions were made. Happy is what we both had with more time for each other. I was much more happy being at home with Jen having to eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for three days in a row because of lack of grocery money, then what things are now. Watching television together and having the physical contact we had yearned for with each other for more than four years...that is what defined 'Happy'. 


After hours of talking it almost felt like there was a smidge of peace in the room. I think she needed not only to hear the words but know that what I was saying were things I truly meant.

""Will you, please?""

""Ok...I'll get rid of the disk.""

With that a huge breath was released from her tiny body, she buried her face, cold with tears into my chest and shortly fell asleep.
I quit one of my jobs later today. There were so many things I haden't thought about that I had really began to miss, intensely.
Books, sipping coffee on an hourly basis, playing <b> Uno</b> with Jen, being around and with Jen. 
But I think mostly what I'd missed the most was that big plastic jar with that lid of blue that never seemed to run out its contents, no matter how many times they were spread on bread.

I'm making us some sandwiches in the morning. I'll take my skippy extra crunchy."

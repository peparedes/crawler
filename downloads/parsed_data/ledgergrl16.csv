"event","You know I'm now realizing how quickly time is flying by. It's my last year at university and it's mind boggling to me that I've gotten this far. My mother thought I would never make it past high school, which is very odd considering I was a good student. Weird. 

In other news....The Gilmore Extravaganza Viewing Party was a hit. It's a little crazy when you get 5 Gilmore fans in a room and just start watching favorite episodes or just episodes that are good and make you laugh. I think we literally sat there for 9 hours with a couple of breaks for food and other necessities. We're all a little crazy though! It was nice just getting together with the girls and it was so sad having them leave the next morning. But all good things must come to an end, or so I'm told. 

I'm moving my stuff into our apartment next Thursday and then coming home for the weekend. I officially move in the 28th and classes start the 30th. I'm looking forward to the few classes I have, but I am dreading Practicum and my commute to East Providence once or twice a week. I really don't think I'm cut out for this teaching gig. What was I thinking? Oh well at least I'm not the only one freaking out about teaching. My roomie is freaked out too, of course that doesn't bode well for the two of us living together. That means we'll be freaking out on a regular basis and it means the undecisiveness we both have with be at it's peak. 

Thankfully I know a lot of people living near us in the surrounding apts. R and K will bring some much needed partying to us. Of course the one year where I know I will need the relaxation I should be buckling down and writing lesson plans....how fun!

Looking forward to packing my crap up.....which won't be much since a lot of my stuff has remained packed and sitting on the living room floor collecting dust. Everything except my clothes and shoes and other things I use daily. I still have gifts from Europe that I need to give to people. I'm a bad friend! Here's to wanting to go back to school to see my friends, but not to work! 

More later

Saturday I had to do fucking community service from 10-4 at Coggeshall Farm....and I was feeling awesomely crappy. And did I mention the rain? The fucking rain...thank god I decided to park outside of the dorm Friday night without getting a ticket, which was pleasant. Emily and I kept calling Public Safety to ask if it was canceled cuz apparently there was a shuttle taking people to the farm , but I chose to drive. The fucking asshole who was answering the phone kept misunderstanding saying the shuttle was leaving at 10 when it wasn't supposed to leave till 10:30....he was fucking WRONG....I kept saying no u don't understand, but no.....he's a dumbfuck....I can't help that people r stupid.....sorry there seems to be some pent up rage.....anyway....me and Em get to the farm and they can't make up their fucking minds whether to cancel or not....so we learn about the farm, which is actually cool....stand around for an hour....thank god the guy who lived there started some fires...which was nice.....finally we got sent home and me and Em went to get breakfast anf hightailed it home to do nothing but watch movies....lemme tell you Taking Lives with Angelina Jolie and Ethan Hawke is fucking awesome!
  So sunday rolls around and hey....there's a Reno 911 marathon and I'm really sick and me and Em can't tear ourselves away from it! So did nothing all weekend.....
GUESS WHO'S COMING HOME THIS WEEKEND!!!!
If u didn't guess me ur not my friend and I don't know who u r!
So yeah Mercedes wants to buy my car back so I'm driving back Friday and Saturday morning Mi Padre and I r going to go talk to them and see how much more it will cost for me to get a 2005....and no Parker I don't think I will be able to afford an E class.....but u never know and I will never drive the station wagon.....so I'm assuming they'll just give me another ML320 2005 edition...but who knows....

Have I written enough...are u bored yet???
I'm sick...it sucks major ass....Lea, why have u not called me?!?!?!
OK....I'm done....say whatever u want.....maybe I'll start writing more religiously....then again..I never can seem to do it, but I'll try.

"event","<P>Ok see now I feel stupid. Lea was telling me about this so I decided to sign up so that I could keep in contact with what everyone else was doing. Since I am in far off RI! So I'm like yeah, lemme sign up. Well my dumb self couldn't figure out how to make an account so I was talking to Lea on the phone and she had to get online just to help me. That was definitely a blonde moment and one that I'm definitely not proud of! And it made my genius status drop to just average.....</P>
<P>So college life treats me very well and I have all this freedom and then I end up coming back home and BAM--- freedom's gone! I don't even think having a driver's license would help! </P>
<P>Well see now I think I have written enough.....I have nothing much else to tell anyone and seeing as how I only have one friend who knows about me having a livejournal....I don't think I should have to write anymore!!!!!!!&nbsp; :-P</P>"

Needless to say having them didnt help much, Im not to worried about it, im only out about 20 bucks for buying them with all the suplies. No sympathy for the devil, some of us arent deserving of such things as companionship and a life fulfilled by love and great things. Guess its better to have learned that now than 20 years down the road. Work time is getting close."

Some creatures born they never live but still they are alive
Upon a bony steed I sway, my scythe above the herd
I want to murder everyone in the entire world

Death feeds the cycle, driven by your hate
Can you see there is nothing left to create?
All is for me to destroy
And emptiness employ

I want to murder everyone in the entire world
Every man and women, every boy and every girl
Swallow up the air and earth, mutilate the worms
Kill the messenger who begs us to consider terms

But hatred is a feeling that mutated with time
Into something much more sublime
To kill without passion? A new ability
I slay with a new efficiency 
This effect is most pleasing
As I slaughter millions for no reason
A vision of universal death?
No
No

So
Horny
Fetid

The young are simply too dumb to live
The old are weak and unclean

The horrors of human expression. Theres not alot of hope left for me, on anything, im really grasping at straws, I really was doing good for a while, i was feeling better, trying to be constructive, and doing what i could to move on, things were descent for a while, and then i got hit with issues in a severe way, worse than i ever expected to happen, one day i wake up wishing i was dead and the next waking up laughing at what i used to want out of life, its so much easier when you have something to grasp onto, but there is nothing for me, i have freinds yes but they wouldnt understand. They are all happy with there situation and really dont know what its like to feel the way i do now. Even the ones i love and care about the most are glad to be done with me. i guess all i can hope for is to once again find some reason to be happy, i was happy before with being alone, not wanting or expecting anything out of anyone, if i cant find that happy spot again then oh well, maybe something will keep me going. i still dont know why i feel the way that i do but it cant really be helped considering ive tried everything, if i were to get really stupid im sure id leave a message or have it left for me for whoever is interested. im cold and need a blankie, blah blah blah im just digging myself in a greater invisible hole and ill wake up tommorrow wondering why i blabbed about shit that i do."

As i was laughing i finally got out, will you marry me or some fuckin shit? and i could tell my date was really pissed and the table next to us was about to get up and leave cause they couldnt believe i just asked her that in such a way but i didnt care, i was laughing to hard, and then i woke up and was still laughing about the whole thing. tried to doze back off again after i quit laughing but my alarm went off, guess that dream considering i woke up from laughing so hard in a dream that its just an easy reminder of what a big joke what i used to want out of life was. off to work i go."

Kinda ironic that shes sitting here telling me she wants to fuck and then asking me if she was able to take back what she said to her boyfriend because he was being a dick to her. I had no interest in messing around with her anyways considering I dont need or want to deal with trying to create any form of relationship with women at all, but still humorous that she was willing to cheat on her boyfriend just to get her rocks off. Im thinking about picking up a shotgun in the next couple of weeks, dont know what i need it for considering i dont hunt and would much rather bludgeon someone to death if they tried to break into the house, maybe its to satisfy the urges ive been having lately, or maybe its just to feel more comfortable knowing ones in the house, who knows, guess ill see how things go once I decide to pick one up. I know i can get one for pretty cheap at walmart, seen 12 gauges up there between 85 and 150 bucks, not to expensive at all. Other than the friend crying on my shoulder about what she should do havent had anybody else stupid enough to think they can break my will, Im sure id get a good laugh out of it if anyone did, theres some out there who believe that they're really that damn good and hot that they can get anyone they want, The horrors of the human ego. Im still curious as to why I continually update this journal, 99.9% of the time its insignificant rambling that im sure nobody gives a damn about, half the time i dont give a damn about what im saying either, Im sure most of the people who come across my babling have greater issues than I. Oh well, only time will tell and maybe one day I can leave this site for good and quit wasting well deserved space for someone else to take up."

I hate feeling this way, Its been 6 or 7 years since I actually tried anything of the sort, and have rolled with the punches rather well since then up until now.

"event","My old ways have been trying to creep back up on me as of late. Ive been doing really well about keeping the thoughts pushed away but they always tend to creep up again and slap me in the face out of nowhere. Ive been trying to do constructive things that are said to help when your feeling down like working, going to the gym, trying to hang out with the roomies when there around and not fighting, occasionally getting out of the house, but none of its really helping out. I really miss my princess, shes always on my mind....wondering what shes doing, how shes feeling, if shes found anyone knew or maybe hooking up with someone old, maybe its none of my business anymore but i still and i guess always will have an interest in knowing whats going on in her life and trying to be there for her the best that i can. Ive asked myself many times if i really did everything in my power to get to her, i mean i did do alot, I attempted 2 trips there, one of which i made it to the border, found out where i needed to get my birth certificate from and got it sent to me, had a speeding ticket paid off, other legal issues fixed that would allow me to cross the border, and when it came to taking the last step needed to make sure i could finally cross the border i couldnt get a hold of the right people. I tried several different numbers but obviously none of them were the right ones so what else was there to do. I know it wouldnt be fair to either of us to keep going the way we were, not knowing if what we wanted was ever going to happen or when. Ive tried moving on, keeping myself busy, doing things that make me happy, but theres still this big empty hole thats missing in my soul and no matter what im doing shes always in the back of my mind, hearing her sweet voice on the phone, seeing her beautiful smile, not being able to wait to get off of work so i could come home and spend time with her. Ive never had this much trouble getting over someone before, even with the people I loved I usually was able to move on and look to the future and start looking again or just goof off with freinds and wait for someone to find me, but id definitely be over it by now with everyone else ive had a relationship with. It may sound crazy, stupid or retarded but since ive known her and fell in love, ive always known in my heart that she was my soul mate, the one i wanted to spend the rest of my life with, and i still very much believe that to this day. Im doing what i can to move on and deal with what happened, i know she wont stay single forever, one day she will find someone that interests her and go on dates and such, all i can hope is that he is good to her, makes her happy, and can do everything for her that I wanted to do. I really dont have an interest at all in meeting anyone, partly cause of whats happened but mostly because i had no interest in meeting anyone before her, i was single for 5 years before me and her decided to hook up, in those years i never once went on a date or had sex even tho i had several opportunities for both, it just didnt interest me to be with someone just to get my rocks off and most of the offers for dates i could tell i wouldnt have been interested in anything long term so it would have been a waste of time. Maybe I did something foul in a former life, or maybe being willing to give up my home, family and country to be with the one i care so much about and wanted to spend my life with isnt good enough for whatever god that may be out there watching over us. I suppose I'll just have to see what time will bring me and maybe the wounds will slowly heal so that i can enjoy being alone. I know I will always love her and she will always be in my heart and all i can hope is that she finds happiness in life because if there is anyone deserving of total happiness its her. I got a couple new peircings in the last few days and i like them alot, Ive been wanting them for a while and i guess it was a good time to get them, it kinda brought that stinging pain that i was looking for in my old ways. I was kinda nervous about getting the neck one done cause i thought it was gonna be extremely painful, but it turned out that it really wasnt that bad, just felt a small pinch and it was done, sounds kinda silly to be nervous about the pain and then being let down that it wasnt more painful. Theres a few more im wanting to get done along with a couple of tattoos before summer comes around so they will be nice and healed up so i can go swimming and such. im hoping to lose some extra weight as well and put on some muscle before summer as well, i like being in shape and I let myself go for a good while and need to get back to at least the shape i used to be in, plus it all gives me something to do. Work is pissing me off cause ive been working everyday for almost a month straight and its taking its toll on me as well, and because of the fucked up shifts i work its causing me to get even less sleep and thats an area thats already been lacking since ive been here. My back is still bothering me a bit but not as bad, yesterday morning was hell tho, i started cramping up really bad in my abdomen and stomach area while at work and kept getting worse till after i woke up yesterday afternoon, i dont know what it was all about really, just started around 530 am and got worse. im thinking maybe my back and stomach are prolly stress related cause of work and everything going on in my head, but all it does is adds to the stress, which i could do without at the time being. I guess its time to start thinking about work again, i hate fucking split shifts, besides i didnt mean to babble into thin air this long."

Really makes me wonder about the whole friend thing considering in my opinion true friends know there boundaries and wouldnt make any effort to go out on dates or offer up sex just cause they know your single again. oh well, i found it rather ammusing that someone so young thought they could talk to me after reading a profile. guess ill just have to see what happens today, maybe ill have to edit my profile even further considering i thought my age and single not looking where good enough to keep people away."

And as your eyes are opening wider and your coming out of that haze of sleep your heart starts to become filled with a great sadness and pain as you realize your dreams have faded away into the darkness of your mind, leaving you forever. And as you pass the days you come to realize that some dreams arent meant to happen, are to good to be true. The pain is still there, as you wonder why the one dream you've wanted more than anything more than anything else in your life will never be within your grasp. Watching so many people piss away what youve held dear for so long. But you lose faith, put your dreams in the past. Your suffering grows with each passing day, but you've become One with it. You learn to enjoy its company like running into a great friend in the street after not seeing them for several months, catching up on the new and remembering the old times, you embrace it with everything that you are because its the only thing you will know for the rest of time, Except for the longing of a dream once had. And with your dying breath you realize you had gotten what you wanted all those years ago when you gave up the dream, you'd fell in love with the suffering in your soul, carressing that dark emotion as you trembled and cried in bed at night, looking for whatever comfort it may bring to you."

Maybe im just a glutton for punishment. Well thats 2 peircings in 2 days. To bad im not rich and didnt need a job, could cover my body and face in tattoos and peircings and nobody would see the ugly wildabeast hidden away under it all. Gotta start getting ready for work here shortly and my back is starting to act funny again so i guess i need to start moving around."

Out there in the cold,
Getting lonely, getting old,
Can you feel me?
Hey you,
Standing in the aisle,
With itchy feet and fading smile,
Can you feel me?
Hey you,
Don't help them to bury the light.
Don't give in without a fight.

Hey you,
Out there on your own,
Sitting naked by the phone,
Would you touch me?
Hey you,
With your ear against the wall,
Waiting for someone to call out,
Would you touch me?
Hey you,
Would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home.

But it was only fantasy.
The wall was too high, as you can see.
No matter how he tried he could not break free.
And the worms ate into his brain.

Hey you,
Out there on the road,
Always doing what you're told,
Can you help me?
Hey you,
Out there beyond the wall,
Breaking bottles in the hall,
Can you help me?
Hey you,
Don't tell me there's no hope at all.

My back is still bothering me a bit but cant really do much about it. The pain will stop, it always does whenever i think there may be something wrong with me.

My body insists on living...
While my mind does not at all...
My hands are made unforgiving...
With blade on my body they crawl...

I drain myself quite often now...
A life less longing for future...
I don't care when, don't care how...
My way of life, self torture...

No one knows the pain that you gave...
Neither I have the power to define...
But I can't bear it, I'm tired to crave...
On my body I follow my own lines...

My body is getting weaker...
My mind might soon win the war...
I'm plunging into a hole, deeper...
Watching my fate from afar...

Yet my eyes search for light...
Up ahead piercing the cage I've built...
Within myself it's made of plight...
Depression, anger, hate and guilt...

Misery that I've never known...
I'm towards the end of my rope...
A hand reaches me on its own...
Defining me, creating new hope...

Pulls me into warm embrace...
Now my eyes seem full of tears...
They stream down all over my face...
Washing away all my nightmares...

Soft lips kiss my tears away...
And a voice whispers in my ear...
Telling me it's going to be okay...
Expressing love I always wanted to hear...

Heavy breathings make me fall asleep...
Spreading new breath in the air...
But everything goes dark again, deep...
For the gentle hands that stroke my hair..."

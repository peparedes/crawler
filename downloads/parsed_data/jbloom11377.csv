the guy thats taking over the gym after september was asking me if i know anyone who would like to work there and i said maybe. Jen and Megan if you're interested let me know.

When I got home from work, dinner was waiting on the stove. Chicken and stuffing. I <3 stuffing.

On my stairs there were 4 grocery bags filled with awesome snacks so that I can pack lunch for a while to save money. ^_^ Goldfish, cookies, snack bars, pop tarts, mini snapples! one word. ZOMG.

(does ZOMG count as one word?)

now im listening to Dark Blue. =) I wanna learn how to play the beginning on the piano. probably would be hard though cause Andrew McMahon is a piano genius and i doubt he would make the music simple. *giggles*

Now I have math homework. Okay, not bad. At least it's ONLY math, not like math and english and chemistry. Lol. Am I getting optimistic again?? Yessss.

You know, Tommy Lee is a hell of an awesome drummer... but he shouldn't sing. For shame, Tommy. I'm sick of seeing his video on VH1 in the mornings. He needs to stick to drumming.

Oh, I need to do some laundry too if I want clean clothes Wednesday.

"event","Today was the meeting for People to People. They had this big presentation about how the trip would go and all that stuff. There's still the application process, and raising the money. It's gonna cost... a lot. Almost $6,000 including spending money. >.< I'm gonna have to do a bunch of fundraiser crap to earn the money. My mom said she would plan a Beef n Beer type dinner at Zion to help raise the money. Maybe a Poker Night too. Gotta call my Dad and ask him about possibly helping. I don't know if he will though. ""blah blah blah child support blah blah blah."" Anyway my interview is on October 23rd. I have some stuff to fill out for that, plus getting recommendations from 3 adults. After all that, if I get accepted, I'll be able to go to Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji. HOLY SHIT, DUDE. The presenters were saying how Fiji is like the most beautiful place in the world, but I'm mostly looking forward to New Zealand. 4 words: Lord of the Rings. XD What's the drinking age there?? I wanna go to Fidel's, that bar restaurant place that the LOTR cast went to all the time. And of course I wanna go on the bungee jump in NZ, it's like the highest in the world I think. My mom was like ""You would do that?!!"" Hell yes. And there's some law about not hugging koalas... weird, but okay. *hugs koalas anyway* Defy the law! Muahaha. But for now I have to worry about even getting accepted and getting the money.

So after that we went to the pork dinner at Zion. My mom told all the church people about the program and they all said they would help out with fundraisers and stuff, which is great.

That's all for today.

Ack, it's only 10:00! I want SNL to come on right effing now. I'm bored.

Your beliefs most closely resemble those of Buddhism. Do more research on Buddhism and possibly consider becoming Buddhist, if you are not already.

In Buddhism, there are Four Noble Truths: (1) Life is suffering. (2) All suffering is caused by ignorance of the nature of reality and the craving, attachment, and grasping that result from such ignorance. (3) Suffering can be ended by overcoming ignorance and attachment. (4) The path to the suppression of suffering is the Noble Eightfold Path, which consists of right views, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right-mindedness, and right contemplation. These eight are usually divided into three categories that base the Buddhist faith: morality, wisdom, and samadhi, or concentration. In Buddhism, there is no hierarchy, nor caste system; the Buddha taught that one's spiritual worth is not based on birth.<br><br><table border='0' width='300' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='0'><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Buddhism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='88' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>88%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Islam</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='83' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>83%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Christianity</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='67' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>67%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Judaism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='50' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>50%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Satanism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='46' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>46%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Hinduism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='42' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>42%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>agnosticism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='25' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>25%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Paganism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='25' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>25%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>atheism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='4' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>4%</font></td></tr></td></tr></table><br><a href='http://quizfarm.com/test.php?q_id=10907'>Which religion is the right one for you?

Case Closed #6
Inuyasha #1 and #2
Tuxedo Gin #2 and #3 (they didnt have #1).

Some girls threw trash at us in the food court for like no reason. Maybe we were being too loud for them, but I think that's what the mall is for. It is aimed mainly towards teenagers. But I think they were just jealous cause they were all super dooper fat and ugly and they had no guy friends. Bitches!

I forget where we might be going for Advanced Bio, maybe Jen can comment about that. I do know one thing.... PLANTS! For World Cultures we might go to the Rennisance (sp?) Fair. Just need 25 people to go. Awesome. Jess Portman is like obsessed over their chicken legs. XDD So yeah the trips should be cool.

And I know this is so far ahead, but this summer I'm going to the Dominican Replublic! Would have been going to Puerto Rico, but like all the time share things were booked. But either way, it's a vacation in a different country. It's gonna be Me, Mom, Dave, and the Regans. I'm sort of watching their girls, Emily and Leah, while we're there. At least it's only two kids and they're really good. ^_^ Yay.

I know there's other stuff to look forward to, but I have a horrible memory. Heh.

I can't sleep right now cause I slept like all day. XP I was watching TV and I kept falling asleep cause I was all comfy and I had some great pillows.

Paul Harvey Writes:
We tried so hard to make things better for our kids that we made them worse.. For my grandchildren, I'd like better. 

* I'd really like for them to know about hand me down clothes and homemade ice cream and leftover meat loaf sandwiches. I really would. 

I hope you learn humility by being humiliated, and that you learn honesty by being cheated. 

I hope you learn to make your own bed and mow the lawn and wash the car. 

* And I really hope nobody gives you a brand new car when you are sixteen. 

It will be good if at least one time you can see puppies born and your old dog put to sleep. 

* I hope you get a black eye fighting for something you believe in. 

I hope you have to share a bedroom with your younger brother/sister. And it's all right if you have to draw a line down the middle of the room,but when he wants to crawl under the covers with you because he's scared, I hope you let him. 

When you want to see a movie and your little brother/sister wants to tag along, I hope you'll let him/her. 

* I hope you have to walk uphill to school with your friends and that you live in a town where you can do it safely. 

On rainy days when you have to catch a ride, I hope you don't ask your driver to drop you two blocks away so you won't be seen riding with someone as uncool as your Mom. 

If you want a slingshot, I hope your Dad teaches you how to make one instead of buying one. 

* I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and read books. 

* When you learn to use computers, I hope you also learn to add and subtract in your head. 

* I hope you get teased by your friends when you have your first crush on a boy\girl, and when you talk back to your mother that you learn what ivory soap tastes like. (haha.)

May you skin your knee climbing a mountain, burn your hand on a stove and stick your tongue on a frozen flagpole. 

I don't care if you try a beer once, but I hope you don't like it. And if a friend offers you dope or a joint, I hope you realize he is not your friend. 

I sure hope you make time to sit on a porch with your Grandma/Grandpa and go fishing with your Uncle. 

May you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy during the holidays. 

I hope your mother punishes you when you throw a baseball through your neighbor's window and that she hugs you and kisses you at Hannukah/Christmas time when you give her a plaster mold of your hand. 

These things I wish for you - tough times and disappointment, hard work and happiness. To me, it's the only way to appreciate life. 

Written with a pen. Sealed with a kiss. I'm here for you. And if I die before you do, I'll go to heaven and wait for you.



^_^ Stuff like that just reminds me of being 6 years old, wearing hand-me-downs from my brothers, eating spaghetti and boiled hot dogs, being the only kid on the block who couldn't get ice cream when the truck came around, and waiting in the food stamp line, wondering why I can't have a quarter for the candy machine. I never even realized I was poor, that still amazes me.

So anyway, I can't wait until I'm older. Living in Philadelphia, working at the zoo. Wouldn't that be something special.

I went to school to help my mom with her class. its crazy in there... they cant read or write, they can barely go potty by themselves, one speaks only spanish. blame = parents.
Okay so after that I worked 4-6.
Then my mom took me to get some school clothes at Value City. Got 2 pairs of pants (only ones that fit out of like ten pairs tried on), three shirts, and a pair of sneakers! Not Roos, but still awesome. My mom originally said no shirts, but I got them anyway. XDD She loves the one blue butterfly shirt I got. haha.

Still haven't bought Jack's Mannequin ""Everything In Transit"". Gotta get it soon as possible.

I have the sudden urge to watch Aladdin. ""Riff raff, street rat..."" That song gets into my head and makes me laugh at the monkey. XDD I love that movie. Bet you didn't know that about me!!

Oh, and I'm going clothes shopping on Tuesday. Need new clothes for school. Ack, that sounds preppy. *shoots self* But I'm only getting a few pairs of pants and maybe a few shirts. And shoes!!! I need new sneakers. Can't wear Roos all the time, can I? Lol, my Roos were a source of amusement to Frank and Brendon. They'll have to do without.

I'm wide awake and bored. Trying to sleep would only make it worse. What I should do is go to sleep and force myself to wake up at a decent time. I'll try.

So now what? Sit here and complain, waste time, SuFi the computer? o.O

I was just looking for some more communities to join because I get so bored and I need more entries to read. And more icons to look at. I'll go back to doing that for a bit.

After I got home, I found out from Spencer that there was a Battle of the Bands in Yardley. Decided that Me, Megan and Gary should go. So I got my brother to drive us. Haha. The last band that played, Edgar and the Roaches, was really good. Got a band shirt while waiting outside afterwards. ^_^

So, that's all. :)

I'm still not tired. I guess I'll just stay up until the next moon comes along. At least it'll help me get to sleep early and prepare for school year schedule...which will suck terribly. 

I'm gonna try surviving on 5 hours of sleep during the school year. I just have to train myself to only need that much. Does that sound completely retarded for me to try, or do you think I can manage? Well, it doesn't matter what you think because I'm gonna try it anyway and hope it works out. I mean, it's not like I fall asleep right away when I try to go to sleep at 11pm anyway. I know I just lie there, eyes closed, for at least a couple hours. And no matter how much sleep I get, I always feel horrible waking up. 

I'm complaining too much, right?! Okay, don't answer that. I love complaining. It's what I do best, and it always leads to me getting what I want. 

Friggin off topic, back to what I was saying about sleep. The reason I don't want to go to sleep until 1 am (actually giving me 5 hrs, 45 mins of sleep time) is because of Adult Swim. ....Seriously. Aqua Teens and Inuyasha. I've grown to love these shows and I would be a bit depressed if I couldn't watch them for 10 months. My life has so little going on that my happiness comes from TV and music. Not from normal things. 

Man, this entry sucks. x.x I'm kinda just wasting time right now because I'm a little (A LOT) bored. I have the TV on. VH1 plays kick-ass videos for me. Yes, FOR ME! I love believing that everything is for me, about me, revolving around me. It explains a lot, but I won't go into detail about that.

I smell soap all of a sudden. I guess someone just got out of the shower, even though it's only 6:30 am. Who's up this early? Maybe Andrew has work? Doubt it. Way too early. He would never agree to that schedule. Hmm... whatever.

Nobody's online of course. They're all being normal. Sleeping. Probably won't wake up for another 3 or 4 hours.

I heard someone running down the stairs. Must be Andrew, you know the whole running thing... everyone else here is too old or too fat to run down the stairs.

Have you been reading this whole entry?! I'm so sorry. This all has nothing to do with you, and yet you sit here and read. Thank you, darling. You're either very bored, or you care deeply about me. Either way you're reading my entry and that's wonderful.

I'll put an end to this now. I have nothing else to share at the moment.

"event","First, here is an Inuyasha list thingy I got from a Sesshoumaru community (I recently joined it).

100 things to do with a dead Inuyasha

1) Make him part of your wardrobe. (Like Shessho's fluff!)
2) Make some hair extentions.
3) Use him as a pillow.
4) Revive him and kill him again. (haha!)
5) Use him as a floor mat.
6) Melt him with the Toxic Flower Claw. (a whata?)
7) Mail him to all your friends.
8) Mail him to all his friends. (XD)
9) Use him as bait to get all his friends.
10) Draw on his face.
11) Use him as a punching bag. (Sounds fun!!)
12) Have a staring contest.
13) Use him as a raft.
14) Make him your new side kick as dead Inu-Yasha is more helpful than Jaken.
15) Laugh loudly and dance on him.
16) Play tag with him.
17) Have him for lunch.
18) Use him as a pinata and see what comes out!
19) Play with what comes out!
20) Make him into a puppet!
21) Rejoice!!! (Hell yes)
22) Forge his bones into a weapon.
23) Make soup.
24) Feed him to your pet Oni.
25) Try and sell him for a small sum
26) Mount him over your doorway
27) See if Kikyou notices he's dead.
28) If Kikyou DOES notice, see if she REALLY cares... (Kikyo: >.>)
29) Use him as a boomerang.
30) Use him as a shot-put.
31) Make him into a flag.
32) Divide him into a gift bag.
33) Wait till he's nice and rotted, bring him to a party, then say, ""Phew~! What's the smell?!""
34) Sit him up against a tree, looking normal, and see how long his friends talk to him before they realize he's dead. (reminds me of Case Closed when people are passed out and the others dont notice that its Conan using their voice.)
35) Go fishing together and have a 'kodak moment' (with my new camera!)
36) Take him to the zoo and ignore all the 'do not feed the animal' signs.
37) Dress him up like Sephiroth and see if anyone notices
38) Walk him around like a zombie and pretend he's come back from the dead.
39) Chop him up, then try and put him back together.
40) If you can't get him back together, play jacks with the pieces~!
41) Have a pillow fight with him!
42) Use him in a pillow fight.
43) Play hide and seek with him.
44) Have a deep conversation.
45) Complain because your the only one expressing yourself in your relationship!
46) Use him as a Dragonball stunt double. (Dragonball! zomg.)
47) Give him a manicure.
48) Show him to Kikyou and see if she'll die again!
49) Use him as a pin cusion.
50) Practice acupuncture on him!
51) Put the Tenseiga in his rib cage, then hide him someplace really strange. (But Sesshoumaru probably wouldn't let anyone take the Tenseiga..)
52) Hide the body in Jaken's eye and forget to tell him that you did
53) Put Jaken in his rib cage, and hide the body
54) Steal his teeth and make a new necklace, one that looks like his but without that annoying ""sit"" spell
55) Then steal his clothes and ears, then see if you can't charm the Shikon jewel away from Kagome
56) If you can't, take it anyway. Inu-Yasha's not there to protect her any more ^_~
57) Roast him and invite his friends for dinner
58) Use his guts to make a new bow, and his bones for arrows
59) Then, if you can't shoot, present the Inu-bow and arrows to Kikyou. Don't tell her who they are, she should be able to tell since she is a priestess
60) Weave his hair into cloth and see if it makes good armor. If so, keep it, if not, give it to Jaken and tell him it is good ^_~
61) Put his head on a pike in your front yard, next to the traveling salesman from last week
62) Steal his arm! He's half human so you should be able to use the Tetsusaiga, and it is still stronger that a full human arm.
63) Invite all your friends to a BBQ! ^_~
64) Do experiments on him!
65) Try and turn him into a music box.
66) Make a wind chime out of his bones.
67) Turn into a big dog and use him as a chew toy. (I'm not Shippo. -_-')
68) Turn into a big dog and use him as a toothpick!
69) Turn into a big dog, uproot a tree and use it as a toothpick to get Inu Yasha out of your teeth...
70) Kick his ass just because you can!! (FUN!!!!!)
71) Have a family portrait done.
72) Drop him into the well and wait for him to land! *note: Inu can go through the well to Kagome's world so it may be a long wait till he comes back*.
73) Mourn because now you don't have a rival.
74) Bring him to Naraku and laugh in his face because you killed him first! (then get rid of the body and have hot sweet love with naraku and sesshoumaru. I mean... o.O)
75) Use him as a shield when Naraku tries to kick your ass...
76) Roll him into a ball and try some different sports
77) Shave his head
78) Use him as a sacrifice
79) Stuff him in Naraku's Jars of Flesh and see what happens
80) Dress him up as you and use him as your stunt double
81) Change clothes with him and pretend you're him for awhile.
82) Practice using Toukijin with him
83) Play dentist
84) Give him to Rin as a giant doll (That would make her happy, and since she's happy, Sessho's happy!)
85) Pull on his ears
86) Send him in pieces all over the country and device a treasure hunt
87) Make him into a futon
88) Re-act Mel's death scene in 'Braveheart'
89) Leave him in a bog and watch him rot
90) Hide him somewhere so no one will find him
91) If you hide him and forget where you put him, put up 'have you seen my puppy?' posters
92) Sew him onto a tapestry
93) Exchange him for a dead horse... about the same value I figure
94) Exchange the dead horse back for him... dead horses aren't much fun...
95) Dress him up as a girl
96) Throw him at people just because you can
97) Drag him home with you and ask your mom if you can keep him (pretend he's alive so Sesshoumaru will come for him!)
98) Dissect him and see what makes/made him tick
99) Carve him into swiss cheese
100) Make Jaken carry him around because you think he needs some change of scenery


Second, here's a conversation between myself and ""Almost Cool But Not Quite"" Gary...
BloodyRhapsodist: Arise, chicken!
ZenMaster14X: are you playing zelda?
BloodyRhapsodist: XDD No
BloodyRhapsodist: im just thinking of aqua teens
ZenMaster14X: ahh 
BloodyRhapsodist: Billy witch doctor dot com work mostly with chicken.

BloodyRhapsodist: otherwise.... x.x

ZenMaster14X: tough bastards 
ZenMaster14X: they dont die
BloodyRhapsodist: i know it takes like 5 minutes of straight stabbing!
ZenMaster14X: i know!
BloodyRhapsodist: XDD
BloodyRhapsodist: what a geeky conversation
ZenMaster14X: yes 
ZenMaster14X: indeed
BloodyRhapsodist: im going to kill myself now
ZenMaster14X: why?
BloodyRhapsodist: because you tricked me into being a geek
ZenMaster14X: but youve always been a geek...
BloodyRhapsodist: have not

K, that's all. Long entry, but tons of fun. XD

"event","""Darling Nikki"" by Prince

I knew a girl named Nikki
I guess u could say she was a sex fiend
I met her in a hotel lobby
Masturbating with a magazine
She said how'd u like 2 waste some time
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind

She took me 2 her castle
And I just couldn't believe my eyes
She had so many devices
Everything that money could buy
She said sign your name on the dotted line
The lights went out
And Nikki started 2 grind

Nikki

The castle started spinning
Or maybe it was my brain
I can't tell u what she did 2 me
But my body will never be the same
Her lovin' will kick your behind
Oh, she'll show u no mercy
But she'll sho'nuff sho'nuff show u how 2 grind

Darlin' Nikki

Woke up the next morning
Nikki wasn't there
I looked all over and all I found
Was a phone unmber on the stairs
It said thank u 4 a funky time
Call me up whenever u want 2 grind

Oh, Nikki, ohhhh

come back Nikki, come back
Your dirty little Prince
wanna grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind

{backwards at the end...}
""Hello, how r u? I'm fine. 'cause I know
that the Lord is coming soon, coming, coming soon.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Wonderful, isn't it? When I looked up the lyrics I couldn't believe that it was by Prince because it sounds so... rock n roll. XDD

"event","So earlier I was thinking about the changes that would be made once school started. Here's what I came up with...

Bad changes:
Not being able to sleep a ton of hours.
I Can't stay up to watch the great shows (Aqua Teens, Inuyasha, Case Closed).
I'll Have to wake up at 6:45. :sweat:
Now I can only work certain hours.
I'll have homework. x.x
AND, I will have to deal with certain idiots in school. >.>

Good Changes:
Seeing friends more often.
Getting more exercise (even though I don't care too much about that). XD

I tried to think of more good changes, but nothing comes to mind. -_-'

Anyway, school starts Wednesday.

MitsukaiKetsueki: I want to bother Sesshoumaru
BloodyRhapsodist: lol

BloodyRhapsodist: and dressing him like Inuyasha would be horrible cause sessho's outfit is way cooler.
BloodyRhapsodist: *steals severed arm and beats jen with it*
MitsukaiKetsueki: XDD
MitsukaiKetsueki: 47. Wake him up every half an hour and in the morning ask how he slept 

XD I wanna do that
BloodyRhapsodist: lol thats like what megan does to me
MitsukaiKetsueki: Oh my. =o
MitsukaiKetsueki: Kinky
BloodyRhapsodist: lol
BloodyRhapsodist: Take his clothes while he's bathing
BloodyRhapsodist: <333
MitsukaiKetsueki: So wrong xD
MitsukaiKetsueki: But he's hot,
MitsukaiKetsueki: so that makes it all better
BloodyRhapsodist: lol
BloodyRhapsodist: indeed
BloodyRhapsodist: burn the clothes!!
MitsukaiKetsueki: YES!!!
MitsukaiKetsueki: Actually...
BloodyRhapsodist: lol
MitsukaiKetsueki: I'd like to wear them. They're rather fetching
BloodyRhapsodist: XD
BloodyRhapsodist: yeah his clothes are pretty cool
MitsukaiKetsueki: I want them. x.x
BloodyRhapsodist: ill get them for you
BloodyRhapsodist: just gotta wait until he bathes
MitsukaiKetsueki: Yusss X3
MitsukaiKetsueki: Take some neekie piccytures of him on your camera while you're at it. Rawr. ;D
BloodyRhapsodist: great idea!

BloodyRhapsodist: it would be awesome if sometimes cartoon characters could like, come to life.
BloodyRhapsodist: (i think of wierd things.)
MitsukaiKetsueki: YESSS x.x I'd make Heero Yui, Trowa Barton, and Quatre Raberba Winner from Gundam Wing come to life and have an orgy with them. x.x 
BloodyRhapsodist: ...sick.
MitsukaiKetsueki: XDDD
MitsukaiKetsueki: But it'd be hot ;D

Hmm... what characters would I bring to life? Since Jen picked three, I will also pick three...

1. Jimmy Kudo (Case Closed)
2. Sesshoumaru (Inuyasha)
3. Cosmo (Fairly Oddparents)

Quite a group! So, if you want you can comment with your choice of three characters.

"event","i sent my tele back to the shop on saturday and they had it done by sunday night wich i was very pleased about. i still shouted at andy a bit more though.... oh and joeys with us now he arrived on sunday too but i didnt let him near my tele cos hes a drummer too, not that im drummerist or anything its just i dont want anyone but me touching it now. joey brought his ps2 so we all had a good play on that. oooooooohhhh god and its our gig tomorrow aaaaaaaarhhhhh i hope it goes alright. its only a trial thing where the people who own the place will see whether they want us to play properly or not, were playing with three other bands and we all get the same set time, about 8 songs i think. ill have to start writing a setlist actually. kiri sent me an email the other day it wasnt very well written cos she is japanese and everything but she thinks she left her melt banana cd here last time she was down. i didn't even dare listen to it its all scary weird tuning jap rock."

"event","well after andys attempt to wreck my new tele the other day he successfully managed to knacker the volume knob today by turning it all the way round. stupid drummer. i told him hed have to pay for it which he agreed to cos hes a nice bloke really, just a bit clumsy and..... well.... drummerish. aortas coming along nicely though, i added some phaser to it today and it sounded pretty sweet.

apparently joeys coming down to cardiff to see andy in a couple of days- i think hes coming to watch us play on tuesday. which is nice."

"event","well this is the first entry in this thing, it aint gonna be too interesting...... lets see, nothing much has happened today, what did i do yesterday??

well andy came round (thats my drummer) and dropped my new telecaster on the floor which i wasnt very happy about, but we ran through our new song (called aorta) and it went pretty smoothly so we were all ready when saul (bassits) arrived. he was late though cos hed been flirting with some girls at the bus stop- grrrr that boy gets all the ladies. but anyway aorta's sounding pretty good now and were probably going to play it at our next show along with our instrumental interlude thing that saul wrote. then we got distracted by the crate of berr that we'd not finished last night so we drank the rest of that and sat around arsing around for the rest of the evening. oh and joey sent me an email today, he says the tours going well for jellyfish but seths split up with his gf so hes a bit gutted. i like seth but he doesnt half pick some strange women.

i havent been to uni today either, i kinda overslept..... bastard alarm, i think i broke it when it went off on sunday morning. i hit it really hard with my hand and it fell on the floor.

anyway im off

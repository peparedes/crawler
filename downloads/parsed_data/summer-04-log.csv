"event","<P><STRONG>Today was the last day of school. It didn't even seem like it thoug hcos the flippin teachers pushed us out so fast we didnt even have time to flippin breath! But hey, what can ya do?</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>After school was over there wasnt much to do:( But then Kimberly Ottoni called me and we went to eat at the mall, and got some BLING BLING! lol. We saw some guy who oddly enough looked EXACTLY like Simon Colwell. WEEEEIRD!</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Then after the mall we went to Kimmy Poo's house and hung out. Her mom drove us to chart hits to get a movie but we ended up going to sav-on and buying food (the bag broke, RIGHT when we were on her grass in front of her house, GrRrRr!). Then we watched MTV movie awards, they were gay. Then i went home about like 10:30 or 11:00, i dont remember.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>That was day one. ;)</STRONG></P>"

"event","Dear Diary,

Today I am too Tired to Move.  I had the crew go outside and paint the ship last week.  On friday I went to check the paint job in a shuttle craft.  And much to my dismay, they had filled the Murgatroid with graffitti that was all about me.  And not in a good way.  

Well, they say that insults are the most sincerest form of flattery.  So I can't really fault the crew and thier high spirited hyjinx.  But I couldn't let the Captian know that the hull painting was  a failure.  So I spent the entire weekend outside on the hull repainting the Murgatroid. Now it is a very fashonable Greenish Blue.  Boy will we stand out in the fleet now!  Of course greenish-blue is this year's Orange-green.

Now I have lost an entire weekend and it was my turn to lead the arts and crafts hour.  Oh well, I hope this week is better.

-Lothar."

"event","Dear Diary,

Well, today I started my day by getting my feelings hurt (again) by the Capitan (booger brain).  As I passed him in the hall on my way to get an early breakfast, I showed him my idea of a new salute that would really help with moral, something that is seriously lacking here on the <i>Murgatroid</i>.  And he laughed at me right there in the hall, I was crushed.  And now, as I sit here eating my hot wheat germ and glutton free toast, the rest of the crew is comming in and laughing at me.  I am just so sure that the capitan is spreading rumors about me.

Well, I won't let that clown get me down (tee hee, it rhymed).  I just have to remember that I am good enough, smart enough, and by golly brave enough to face anything that this glorius day might throw at me.

Anyway, what I REALLY wanted to write to you today was about the shuffleboard contest that I organised yesterday.  I won!  Can you believe it!  of course no one else showed up and I had to challenge a mop that was there in the cleaning contest, but it was close and I still won.  I just wish I had gotten around to getting som spiffy prizes for the winner.   Perhaps I will treat myself to an apple at lunchtime.

Well, Breaky-fast is over and I have to get scooting off to work, Talk to you later Diary,

Lothar.

P.S. Please forgive me about calling the Captian a booger Brain, I was JUST THAT MAD."

"event","The Murgatroid seems like such an empty place.  Not that alot of the crew are ""out"" (as the Capitan put it).  Storvik, who took my Medailion last year and now Khan have both been missing for some time.  Given that two of the Capitan's major Taskmasters are gone it has become my job to keep the Crew up and running.  so far today I have organised a Shuffleboard tournament to keep the Crew happy and I have Made a roster to have the crew paint the ship.  We are still collecting votes as to what color we should make the Murgatroid, but I have sure, that the crew will pick a Jolly fine color!  Ifix himself told me that ""Any color the Crew pick would be an improvement"" and given his technical expertice, I am sure he is right.  I am a little concerned that he called it ""asspainting"" but I am sure that it is some sort of a joke that get lost in the translation."

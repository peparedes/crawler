"event","XOR&nbsp;is a lot of fun and&nbsp;I've talked about it before. I'm not particularly concerned about this being the least suitable forum for this discussion.&nbsp;LJ&nbsp;is mostly dead it seems, other than as a space for weird survey memes.

Sometimes you are at an exam, and you forget some important mathematical property or definition. And then you set out to prove the thing asked of you in the problem, except that with your incomplete or flawed knowledge base it is actually impossible to prove.

But while you're trying really hard you have a fun time thinking about the subject at hand, since you are forced to really examine it in detail.

I did this with a problem that involved expressing XOR in a certain way. While I&nbsp;was trying to do this, I came up with a fun list of ways to express XOR, given below.

0 XOR&nbsp;0 = 0
0 XOR&nbsp;1 = 1
1 XOR&nbsp;0 = 1
1 XOR&nbsp;1 = 0

XOR is also:

if NOT(A) then B, if A then NOT(B)

abs(A-B)

A+B&nbsp;mod 2

(A&nbsp;OR&nbsp;B)&nbsp;AND&nbsp;NOT(A&nbsp;AND&nbsp;B)

Or if you redefine 'false' to be -1, and 'true' is still defined 1, you can do A*B

I&nbsp;imagine there are many others..."

Added:&nbsp;
-A Serious Man
-Full Metal Jacket
-City of God
-The Pianist

To underline what I&nbsp;said about sad/dark/cerebral/serious movies, here's a re-posting of the rest of the list...

-Pan's Labyrinth
-Paper Moon (Okay this is an exception, it is pretty cheerful in my opinion)
-Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
-Moon
-Amadeus
-Being John Malkovitch
-Persepolis
-Donnie Darko
-What's Eating Gilbert Grape
-Y Tu Mama Tambien
-Fight Club
-Precious

For kicks here are some movies I did not like, despite their status as 'classics' or 'critically acclaimed' (note that these are opinions, so add a little 'IMHO' to the end of each line before you call me out on being a snob, which I most certainly am):

-Kubrick's A Clockwork&nbsp;Orange and also 2001. I'm not a fan of the way the movies 'look' (I&nbsp;don't know if it was that whole era of filmmakers or just him at the time--I definitely like some of his later films, see &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;). Also I hated the pacing of 2001...I remember loving the book as a kid, but I was so bored by the film...

-&quot;Once,&quot; because I guess I'm bored by most movies about relationships (I&nbsp;hate anything that gets too sappy, except my guilty pleasure, &quot;Titanic.&quot;&nbsp;For that matter, Titanic could be a great film if you cut out all the scenes that take place in the 'present' with the old lady version of the protagonist and all the marine biologists and that stupid jewel)

-David Lynch weirded me out with Dune (which I&nbsp;gather nobody liked) and now I'm not willing to see any of his other films

-I&nbsp;love sci-fi but Terry Gilliam's &quot;Brazil&quot;&nbsp;suffered from the same bad 'look' that Kubrick's above-mentioned two films had. Also I found Brazil confusing and drawn-out.

-A.I. and Gattacca were pretty boring in my opinion. A.I. was incredibly sappy and Gattacca was just utterly mediocre. For good (not favorite-list worthy but definitely worth at least one view!) sci-fi, see something like District 9.

-Boondock Saints - why does every dude ever drool over this film?&nbsp;I&nbsp;was so bored I can barely remember it. There were Irish dudes, and a Russian dude with a lot of guns? Whatever man.

-LOTR:&nbsp;Screw LOTR. The books were pretty boring, the movies even more so. The one thing I love is how the movies reintroduced Middle Earth to the current generation so that pop culture could get a kick out of it again. I&nbsp;like humming the techno version of the movies' main theme, and that's about it.

-Rashomon. Some movies require more imagination than I have to give. I'm sure Rashomon is great, but it is also really old. The message was profound, I'm sure, but I wasn't drawn in by the film. I'm wary and excited about any film that comes highly suggested from film buffs--they have a tendency to be excellent but also a tendency to be incredibly boring.

-Primer. I&nbsp;saw this with nerd-friend Allen, who didn't like it either. We felt that it was ultimately too confusing and left too much open-ended. Then&nbsp; I&nbsp;spoke with nerd-friend Samir. Samir says this movie is great, and claims we didn't understand its greatness because we didn't watch it over and over again while taking notes and drawing timelines. Samir says he still hasn't figured this one out despite having watching it some twenty-odd times (I&nbsp;might be exaggerating). But seriously, is any movie worth that?

Okay I'm done complaining! Happy summer everybody."

"event","Most people in my situation would just put down the ~$20 for a decent FM&nbsp;transmitter for iPod, for use in the car.

But I got it into my head that I&nbsp;needed to build my own.

I learned the hard way that an analog implementation just wasn't going to cut it...so I&nbsp;went with digital and purchased a chip.

Today I finally figured out what I&nbsp;was doing wrong. I had brought down the clock speed for my microcontroller thinking that perhaps it was too fast to communicate with the FM broadcast chip.&nbsp;But I&nbsp;forgot to also change the value of the clock speed when compiling my code to reflect that change. The delay statements were too long in this case (since the compiler assumed a higher frequency and thus a higher number of cycles to wait for) and the signal was not getting through to set the channel and misc settings on the broadcast chip. Also I&nbsp;added a small delay at startup to allow for the broadcast chip to turn on fully (devices usually have some short start up time, like 67 ms or something). That might have done the trick.

Ignore that you probably don't care for technical details anyway. That's justified; they can be very boring. The important part is that by the time I&nbsp;drive to campus tonight I&nbsp;will be using my fancy homebrew device and listening, for the first time in ages, to something that is not KCRW."

"event","Here's a post for which LJ is probably the wrong forum. I'm proceeding anyway.<br /><br />REDESIGN PROJECTS<br /><br />Digi-key and such charge me $10 shipping even on tiny orders. So I'm trying to get a big list of parts made up so that I can order everything at once. That means I'm trying to figure out the design on all my projects at once.<br /><br />1. Solar Powered Ipod Charger:<br />I'm rebuilding this from the ground up. It can be broken up into several parts.<ul><li>I need to design a charger for Ni-Cd (Nickel cadmium) or Ni-MH (Nickel metal hydride) batteries. I need to make sure that my charger, when hooked up to my choice solar panel, takes a reasonable amount of time to complete a full charge. I also want it to contain a mechanism to prevent overcharging, though with the solar panel that may be unlikely.</li><li>&nbsp;I&nbsp;will probably use 2 batteries for a total of 2.4V. I&nbsp;need to convert that up to 5V before I&nbsp;feed it to the iPod. Additionally I need to add a simple arrangement of resistors that will connect the data and clock lines so the iPod accepts the charging device.</li></ul><br />2. FM Radio Transmitter for iPod<ul><li>Acceptable quality, stereo. For this I'll probably end up using a design with the BA1404 chip.&nbsp;I plan to give this a try:&nbsp;http://electronics-diy.com/BA1404_Stereo_FM_Transmitter.php</li><li>Variable inductor. I like this better than designs with a variable capacitor because you can make your own variable inductors more easily than you can make a variable capacitor. I make my variable inductors by threading a screw through coiled wire.</li></ul><br />3. Dark detecting nightlight<br />Longevity is the goal on this project. I want it to work with one or two AA batteries (3V) and last for a long time (at least a week, though&nbsp;I&nbsp;believe that it would be possible to design one to last for months).&nbsp;I&nbsp;still don't have very detailed plans for this one.<ul><li>Two red leds turn on all night. The leds are pulsed and so they use less energy.</li><li>During the day the circuit must waste almost no power at all.</li></ul>4.Giant 7 segment clock<br />I bought 4 large (6.5&quot;) seven segment displays for making a clock.<ul><li>Will probably try using a wall adaptor for this one</li><li>Should include a system to set the time with buttons on the clock</li><li>Button to switch from 24 hour to 12 hour display would be nice</li></ul>5. Walkie-Talkie<br />I found a great, uber-simple FM&nbsp;Transmitter schematic that uses a cheap microphone (I&nbsp;tried swapping that out for my iPod's signal--did not work, hence, I'm still thinking about project #2). Unfortunately, it seems that FM&nbsp;Receivers are a touch more complicated.&nbsp;I found a schematic though, so I'll be trying that out soon.<ul><li>Must be small, use variable inductors.</li><li>Must run off of a single 1.5 v battery.</li><li>Must fit into this nice little clear box I found (used to house bobby pins).</li><li>I&nbsp;need to build a second one after I&nbsp;perfect the first.</li></ul>6. Project Free Laundry<br />I'm curious about 'smart cards' and I&nbsp;want to learn more about how they work and how to interface with them. If successful, I would never dream of using this for personal gain (ie, putting free credits on my laundry card)."

"event","When I was a kid I decided at some point I wanted to be a nerd. Granted, I was probably already a nerd:
-Got left behind on field trip because I was engrossed in an Animorphs book
-In 5th grade was shunned by rest of girls in my class
-In 9th grade went shopping for new clothes. Next day at school received comment from second violinist: ""You finally look normal""

But when I specifically wanted to be a nerd about was technology and computers. So I started reading MacAddict, which I found hilarious despite the fact that most jokes went over my head and most articles discussed things I knew nothing about. In middle school my nerd-counterpart was this kid Erik Krasney (some of you know him, I think). I think I might have gotten into web design because he had some website he made. Erik and I fought our own little front of the Operating System Wars, with me defending the Mac side and him defending the PC side.

That didn't result in actually making me tech-savvy, and so a bunch of years passed by and sometime near the end of middle school I learned some elementary coding, mainly in C++ and in that shitty terrible language on my calculator. That led to last year when I got into Linux and into a computer science-centric workplace, and while I feel pretty hardcore at times there are (hundreds of) miles to go.

I think that's why people like me enjoy throwing around big tech words. I'm surrounded by people who aren't fazed by them at all, and at the same time, I can't forget how cool it sounded when I used to be totally confused by technobabble. So I find outlets like twitter and facebook and write things like, 'ssh tunneling! woo! with x11 forwarding!' when it means practically nothing, and nobody who gets it should care.

So now I have to get back to reading about the java compiler (javac) options and figuring out how to put the output file in a specific destination."

"event","Sorry if this is boring. It's about my hair.

Since my last haircut I've worn my hair in a ponytail every day. To be honest it isn't that terrible (anymore), but I still hate it.

Over the last two and a half years I've gone to three different people, all of them charging between 60-80 dollars, and all of them giving me haircuts that I either hated or strongly disliked.

The last one was at my mom's expensive Beverly Hills guy. I've been to him a number of times. The first time I went he assured me it was the remaining elements of the previous haircut that were the trouble, and he would fix them as soon as they grew out. So I came back to him with long hair past my shoulders, and he still managed to make my hair look bad (kind of old-woman-like and kind of dog-ear-like).

I walked into that last haircut hoping for something like <a href=""http://www.thecinemasource.com/moviesdb/images/The_Devil_Wears_Prada%20-%207%20-%20Anne_Hathaway.jpg""> Anne Hathway</a>. It makes sense, because I have naturally stick-straight hair (so of course I wish I had curls), and because I used to have bangs and I rocked them, I think. As a kid I mostly read sci-fi and had no friends, so maybe rock isn't a word to use.

SO I walked in and told him I wanted bangs and he looked at me funny and said, no you don't, and from there it was all downhill. He tried a few different things, I said I didn't like them, he tried to fix it, and my hair got shorter and weirder until we had to give up because I really didn't want short hair.

I left totally and utterly disappointed, and because I haircuts do this to me, in tears. I hate to sound like a spoiled brat, but when I go into a haircut I'm both elated (at the possibility of ending up gorgeous) and terrified (at the possibility of ending up hideous). And all that waiting for my hair to grow out...and then having to wait again...I couldn't help it. And I mean that, because what mortifies me more than anything is accidentally showing disappointment in somebody for something they earnestly tried to do well.

Point is: I've been looking at my hair, and it is time for a haircut. Nothing drastic, because I still want that haircut in the picture of Anne Hatheway, but something for the interim. I'm too embarrassed to go back to the Beverly Hills guy, and also I think that after he's failed me multiple times in a row, maybe it is time to try another place.

Does anybody have any ideas?"

I've been working on this assignment for three days now. By which I mean, that is the only thing I have been doing for these past three days.

One problem I encounter is that I tend to take advantage of WebAssign to solve problems without actually understanding them (ie, liberal use of the ""practice another version of this problem"" button). I also scribble my work on scratch paper and don't put much effort into neatness which usually leads to typos.

Anyway, point is, I finally did one differently. I found the section in the book, found the procedure laid out (but in a different and non-identical problem), figured out how to do it, wrote everything out neatly, and solved the last steps only to find...

That the answer was zero. Now granted, I was supposed to arrive at this by doing all this work but I really hate when I have a pretty pretty integral and I've done everything right and everything reduces to 0. It somehow feels that I didn't have to do the work. Especially since frequently when I stick a bogus answer into the ""Practice another version"" so I can get the pdf with the solution worked out, then I use '0.'

Annnnnnyway this Calc III stuff is way more confusing than I want it to be and if I don't figure out the following topics by tomorrow 11am, I'm screwed

-Multiple Integrals (mainly I have to practice doing triple integrals over general regions, and in cylindrical and spherical coordinates)
-Line Integrals, Curl and Divergence, Parametric Surfaces and their Areas, Surface Integrals, Stokes' Theorem, the Divergence Theorem

The the exam will be followed by a period during which I will have 25 hours to write 8-10 pages. Immediately after that paper is due I have to get cracking for my Intro to Digital Logic final, which takes place Friday at 8am....

"event","Some of you are going to be all like pfft, I&nbsp;already knew about it or figured it out myself, but for the rest of you, here's something I&nbsp;think is totally awesome, that I&nbsp;only became aware of this week (due to a friend who likes to pose these problems to me while I drive, which is exactly when I most strongly shouldn't be thinking about them, if that makes any sense). The beauty of it is in the simplicity.

Say you need to swap variables A and B. You could just make variable C and say:&nbsp;Put the value of B in C, then put the value of A in B, and then put the value of C in A.

A= 1, B =2, C (empty)
2 -&gt; C
1 -&gt; B
2 -&gt; A

So now they are swapped, but you had to use an extra variable to store a value. That's kind of wasteful, so you could try this:

A = A+B ( which is 3)
B = A - B (which is 2)
A= A - B (which is 1)

But if you're constrained to a number of digits to represent a number, you could experience overflow. For example, working in our regular old base ten number system and allotting each value only one digit of memory, if you had to add an A =&nbsp; 6 with B= 5 you would end up with 11, which can't be represented in base ten with one digit. In binary, if you allot 3 bits to your numbers, you can't represent 8 (7 is 111, 8 is 1000).

In binary, using boolean logic, you can do this swap without risking overflow AND&nbsp;without using another variable. The trick is XOR. In case you aren't familiar with boolean logic:

OR will evaluate to true with either input is true, or both are true. Let 1 represent true, 0 represent false:

A &nbsp; &nbsp; B &nbsp; &nbsp; (A OR&nbsp;B)
0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1
0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1
1 &nbsp; &nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1

For example, if my alarm is ringing OR&nbsp;the time is already 9am, I need to get up. If both are true, I&nbsp;need to get up. If only one of the two conditions is true, I&nbsp;still need to get up. The only time I don't have to get up is if it isn't yet 9am, and my alarm isn't ringing.

XOR is similar. It stands for Exclusively Or. The difference is that for XOR, if both conditions are true, A&nbsp;XOR&nbsp;B does not evaluate to true. So...


A &nbsp; &nbsp; B &nbsp; &nbsp; (A XOR&nbsp;B)
0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1
0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1
1 &nbsp; &nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0

So again, exactly like OR, but now 1 xor 1 evaluates to 0.

So now the binary swap (note this works only in binary, but you can use it to swap binary representations of numbers with values higher than 1)

A =&nbsp; A&nbsp;xor&nbsp;B
B = A xor B
A =&nbsp; A xor B

Super simple. Let's try it out (you can try it out on all four cases, but I'll just do one) on A = 1, B = 0

A =&nbsp; 1 xor 0 = 1
B = 1 xor 0 = 1
A = 1 xor 1 = 0

So from A = 1, B = 0 we go to A = 0, B = 1. Sooo easy!

On a last note: If in binary A is equal to 1111, then the bitflip is 0000. So the bitflip is defined by just switching ones for zeroes and zeroes for ones. As it turns out, if you're doing addition/subtraction in binary:

(A - B)&nbsp; = A + the bitflip of B + 1, dropping the carryout from the most significant bit

It's easier than subtraction in decimal. I've actually forgotten how to properly carry numbers over, I&nbsp;always screw something up. But since binary subtraction is better expressed as binary addition, then I&nbsp;find it easy.

And now, for Physics homework, and then 8 am physics lab....Hope you found any of that interesting!"

"event","I just wish that the world had more well-designed step by step tutorials on how to do things.

Here's what I&nbsp;mean:

There are a lot of rather complex games (video games and traditional games) that are really fun, but learning the whole thing requires you to read a manual that can be book-length (no joke, just ask my friend Sam). A well designed game though teaches you as you go along, and does not ask you to sit down and read for a few hours before you begin. The problem is that some of the poorly designed ones are still great games, but most of us will get too frustrated to ever care about playing them.

And I'm pretty sure this applies to a lot of other activities as well. A lot of science/tech/computer/math related stuff is simple, but only if you teach it step by step. And if only there were better tutorials, with better diagrams and more careful instruction, maybe more of us would be inclined to learn how to do these things, instead of being scared off the the emergent complexity of the final product.

That was brought on by me looking for a simple schematic for a 3v input dark detecting circuit that uses a photoresistor (LDR) and not a phototransistor. The problem with this simple circuit is that most analogous schematics have a different input (say, 12v or a domestic power supply) and a bunch of minor differences, and they don't provide any background explanations or equations that would allow me to better understand how to modfiy the circuit to my needs. They also don't give me any insight as to how to read the diagram, or what parts I&nbsp;could swap out with analogous parts, or how many coils I&nbsp;might need on my inductor, or so on so forth. And sometimes I&nbsp;find&nbsp; a picture on flickr of what looks to be exactly what I&nbsp;need, and there's no schematic provided.

So if I could have anything right now, I&nbsp;would like to have a book full of electronics projects, starting with the simple and scaling up to the really difficult. And by the end I would have made a bunch of awesome stuff and also learned a bunch of things that are going to be pretty useful to me in the future because I've decided on EE as a major.

Lastly, a note:&nbsp;As a kid I&nbsp;had a lot of computer games that did exactly what I'm asking for right now:&nbsp;I&nbsp;learned reading, writing, math, and even some basic optics (refraction/reflection, convex/concave, filters) and electronics (series vs. parallel, conductivity and that kind of stuff) with puzzles that started out really easy and scaled up slowly. It was really fun and I'm pretty sure it was effective, and I wish there was that kind of stuff at a higher level, because it would make my life easier."

How nice would it be if you could go online, type in info on a product, and get a listing of stores near you that stock it?

For people looking for anything specific (imported foodstuffs, certain designer brands of clothing, specialty anythings, etc) it would make the search much easier.

The short (up to 5:45 minutes a page) timer makes purchasing really obnoxious sometimes, especially when you run into some glitches on the page.

And then there are the charges.

Order processing fee, $4.50. Uhm...You're a website. The transaction is run by a machine. No human needs to look over my purchase unless something goes wrong.

Convenience charge, $9.50 per ticket plus $1 per level by which ticket becomes more expensive. What the fuck? I have to pay, because the internet is convenient??

Delivery: It's pretty expensive (some 15-20 dollars depending on how many days) to ship it via UPS, especially considering that you really only need to send it in a regular sized envelope, like the kind they use for letters. So it seems great that you can print the tickets out yourself for only $2.50. But when you think about it, you realize you just payed $2.50 to print out your own tickets at your own expense, using your own printer and ink and paper, etc. That is definitely...scammy. (In fact, even to pick up your ticket from a nearby ticketmaster location costs you $1.00. The only free option is for you to pick up your tickets up at will call at the event. That was a problem in high school, because I wasn't the credit card holder, so I couldn't properly claim the tickets).

Yeah. /rant. Anyhow, I'm glad I&nbsp;have tickets anyway, and I paid for most of them with a giftcard I&nbsp;got back on my 18th birthday, so all's well."

Problem is, even in studying I procrastinate. Instead of figuring out what the hell a Taylor Series does and how it works and whatever (I kind of skipped that week of class) I find myself solving integral after integral. Because that's more fun. And I don't even do all the integrals--I do just the trig subs and integration by parts problems, because I can't do long division and partial fractions. I even do them twice, to cement them in my mind.

I guess sometime in the next 12 hours I will have to get on to studying all those things I have no clue about.

Speaking of which, when math is over, I have about a day to cram in a few months of physics. I keep telling myself how hard can it be, if the only topics are projectile motion, basic torque and inertia problems, and basic thermodynamics? That's like three topics. But my grade on the last exam ought to have tipped me off...

I guess the point of this is that it is 3 in the morning and I'm feeling like I probably dug myself into a pretty big hole. And the only way out is INTENSE STUDYING."

Today would have worked out nicely anyway if I had known about the evils of hidden carriage returns.

Basically, some weird formatting problems turned my final Computer Science assignment into programming hell. What should have taken me no more than four hours took me a whole eight hours, and I mean a full eight hours (I even didn't go to dinner, and my friends Allen and Joh came over briefly to bring me pizza and salad).

On the one hand, I don't know where that time really went, because I've never spent so long on a CS assignment before. On the other hand, I do know where it went, because I've definitely spent more than 8 hours before on troubleshooting something dumb and small and having to do with computers. I guess the problem is that usually these things are my own projects, and I don't mind spending all day on my own projects. But 8 hours on a homework assignment...one that I won't even get full credit for because I rushed the write-up and clean-up and commenting into fifteen minutes...For a class I'm not even having trouble in...

BLAH. I just want to play Bioshock and build my robot.

Usually I&nbsp;get back comment on papers asking me to please cut down on the wordiness, because it detracts from my points (though usually those are the same papers where I'm using wordiness to cover up my lack of good points).<br /><br />It was a short paper in which I&nbsp;analyzed two short stories by Gogol.<br /><br />Here is what I&nbsp;probably should have cited:<br />-I&nbsp;should have included an entry for both short stories. This is more a matter of form and I did not get any comments on it. It is obvious that these short stories are by Gogol&nbsp;(My title is:&nbsp;Gogol's The Overcoat and How the Two Ivans Quarelled.)<br />-I should have included an entry for the quote by D.S.&nbsp;Mirsky, though I&nbsp;attributed it to him in my paper anyway and I&nbsp;got no comments about that either.<br /><br />But my professor's only suggestion is that I cite the term 'poshlost.' True, Nabakov is the most famous user of the word, though he punningly calls it poshlust instead of poshlost. But my defintion of poshlust was obtained, basically, by a) seeing it in reference to Gogol, b)&nbsp;typing it into google, finding a lot of definitions by different people (as the world is not quite translatable), c) cobbling together a general idea and applying it myself to the stories I&nbsp;chose.&nbsp; My big mistake would be confusing Nabakov's pun spelling and the real spelling, and writing it inconsistently.<br /><br />I mean, really, the only material I borrowed was the same thing I always do:&nbsp;I&nbsp;look up the subjects in question on Wikipedia (this time, Gogol) and I&nbsp;try to understand what the usual venues of analysis are (I'm not a literary critic, and I don't want to write things that are totally off the map). Once I've gained a general idea, I&nbsp;do an analysis of the specifics (in this case, the two stories) entirely myself. That hasn't ever been a problem with any of my papers in the past (and, as all of you have, I've written many papers).<br /><br />The good thing is that my professor didn't seem like he was going to do the &quot;any suspicion and I&nbsp;report you to authorities, refuse to ask questions, and never give you a second chance.&quot;&nbsp;When I talked to him, he asked that I&nbsp;resubmit with a works cited including Nabakov's definition of poshlust/lost (which I'll have to do, even though I didn't really rely on Nabakov's defintion).<br /><br />But the problem is that on the comments on the paper, and from what I&nbsp;understood from his attitude, it seems that he doesn't think I wrote the paper itself. If it was just a question of citing a term that I&nbsp;had honestly thought was just a common-use term in literary criticism of Russian works, he would have given me a grade and not a big question mark.<br /><br />&quot;Dear Shira,<br />A very strange paper. It's written in an extremely highbrow literary-critical language and looks like borrowed without references. In particular, where did you get the poshlust idea? I'd suggest we talk, or you just rewrite, in your own words, and reflecting what you learned in class.&quot;<br /><br />Again--poshlust idea--1. I see Wikipedia uses it in describing Gogol. 2. I&nbsp;read multiple definitions to understand the word. 3. I&nbsp;use my understanding to analyze the stories myself.<br /><br />And of course, whenever I get stressed I doubt my own beliefs--so I&nbsp;thought long and hard about whether it was possible that I did somehow plagiarize this paper--but then I realize, <em>I never read any critiques of either of the two short stories I&nbsp;analyzed. </em> The paper was a compare contrast between these stories. So how in the world could I&nbsp;have borrowed my analyses?<br /><br />I'm so insulted. Needless to say, I'm breaking down a ltitle (a lot).<br /><br />"

"event","I recently found out that the dorms close here over winter break, which means I&nbsp;have to go home and pack enough books and clothes to last for three weeks.

And then I&nbsp;found out that my grandparents are also coming to stay during&nbsp; that time (though not all of it).

Those of you who have been to my house will understand why this is worrying. The house features one tiny bathroom, and two bedrooms. Between six people, that is kind of pushing it. Also, my grandparents snore like nobody's business.&nbsp;My sister and I would end up sleeping on a mattress in front of the front door, where the coffee table usually is.

So, uhm, anybody up for sleepovers during winter break? Maybe I'll grab a sleeping bag out of the closet and just travel around LA, alternating homes. You guys still like me enough to do that, right?"

"event","I got my Macbook Pro this week and decided to install Linux and Windows in addition to my Mac OS. Of course, since none of the tutorials I found exactly addressed my situation, I had to cobble together a lot of sources to figure this out. Not to mention trial and error which meant I had to install Windows and Linux some four or five times each. BUT it is pretty awesome to have the apple, penguin, and flag all sitting next to each other when I press the power button and so I have no regrets.<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""How I did it""><br />New Macbook Pro, with install CDs<br />Windows XP CD<br />Ubuntu 8.10 64 bit version CD (download is free, burned to CD with Disk Utility)<br /><br />Download and install rEFIt.<br /><br />Use the terminal to write partitions. This assumes no previous partitions.<ul><li><em>sudo diskutil resizeVolume disk0s2 249G &quot;HFS+&quot; &quot;Linux&quot; 17G &quot;MS-DOS FAT32&quot; &quot;Windows&quot; 32G</em></li></ul>Disk0s2 should be the Mac volume. I wanted to leave 249 GB to it, and put 17GB aside for Linux and 32 for Windows. The three sizes have to add up to less than your total available space on the drive. <em>diskutil list</em> will show you the partitions you have set up.<br /><br />Windows will have to reformat the partition it will be using, otherwise it will install but not boot. I did this to get the installer to give me that option:<ul><li><em>sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rdisk0s4 bs=1m count=100</em></li></ul>That writes over the metadata for that partition, making it Unknown Format to the installer. Alternatively, it seems like you can also just delete and recreate the partition in the Windows Installer instead of using the partition you created with the Mac OS. I prefer the former, though, because I know it worked for me.<br /><br />Install Windows by putting in the CD and restarting with key C held. After setup, choose the right partition to install to.  It will restart a few times, so make sure to boot into Windows to complete the process. After it is done, use the Mac OS install CD to install the drivers for Windows (for older Macbooks it may be necessary to find these drivers in BootCamp and burn them to a CD).<br /><br />Next, put in the Ubuntu CD and boot it as a live CD. Open up the terminal. Back up the MBR (Master Boot Record). I don't remember if you need to use sudo to get this to work. If permissions are denied, just add it in.<ul><li><em>dd if=/dev/sda of=/tmp/sda.mbr bs=512 count=1</em></li></ul>Run the installer (it is sitting on the desktop). Choose to partition manually. Select the right partition (sda3 should be it) and press Edit partition. Choose to mount to '/', to format it, and to use ext3. Go to next and ignore the error message about swap. When offered the install summary, look at the advanced options (important!). Install the boot loader on sda3 (your Linux partition) and not on the default (that will make Windows unbootable and none of the fixes I found actually worked without jeopardizing the rest of my systems).<br /><br />Restore the mbr. I'm not sure exactly when this is supposed to be done but I did it after hitting install and it worked fine. Again, in the terminal:<ul><li><em>dd if=/tmp/sda.mbr of=/dev/sda</em></li></ul>Wait for the installer to finish. Restart as necessary. Actually, try to shut down instead of restart, because at this point there's a bug that I experienced where restarting freezes the computer on the restart part. Shuts down fine though, so shut down and press the power button.<br /><br />Update the MBR by using the Partitioning Tool in rEFIt. When prompted, choose Yes to update. Boot Linux. I had to try booting it twice, but that seems to just be a fluke. I had a lot of those during this process, actually. Make sure all problems are real problems by checking if they happen at least twice.<br /><br />Finally in Linux open the terminal to make a swap space. Use sudo when permissions are denied.<br /><ul><li><em>dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap bs=1024 count=1048576</em></li><li><em>mkswap /swap</em></li><li><em>swapon /swap</em></li><li><em>chmod 600 /swap</em></li></ul>Now check all your systems to see if they boot properly. Hopefully you're all good. Hoorah.<br />&nbsp;</lj-cut><br />"

Because it has a magnet in it, the speaker conveniently sticks to the altoids tin while still being detachable. The indicator LED is inside (the red dot on the right).

The volume and gain controls do not exactly work. In the case of the volume, it is probably because <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel"">volume is logarithmic</a>, and we should have used a special logarithmic potentiometer.

In other news, I started playing Mass Effect. If Asher lived any closer, or if I had my own Xbox, I would not do any work ever again. Though it isn't like I do any work anyways. Recently I spend my free time doing electronics projects and reading Watchmen. Additionally, I haven't done laundry in two weeks. As we speak, my plans to do it today before Dani visits have been replaced by plans to work on the Arduino board project with Asher. Oh well. College."

<b>Summary of parts:</b>
BASICALLY the solar panel charges the rechargeable batteries, which supply the voltage needed to charge the iPod.

<b>Details:</b>
I am using the little printed circuit board that came with the garden light that came with the solar panel. It does what I need and was easy to hook up so I haven't bothered diagramming it. If I was a more dedicated person, I'd figure out the layout and share it online. But, I am not!

New iPods are more finicky than old iPods! Older iPods only need the input and the ground (+ and -, red and black, whatever). Many (storebought or homemade) cheap/old chargers work like this. They won't charge your new iPods though! New iPods (like my 80GB Classic) need their data lines hooked up too (the green and white ones if your cable is colored according to standards). Follow this diagram, found at this instructable: http://www.instructables.com/id/How_to_get_your_iPod_to_charge_with_your_homemade_/

<img src=""http://www.asherv.com/Shira/diagram.jpg""><BR>

Technically, I am supposed to use a 5v regulator (like the 7805). But when I hooked it up, I was only getting like 4.18v to my iPod across the + and - terminals. I took it out and I'm getting 5.09v (.09 too many) but I don't think my iPod is hurting too badly.

<b>Other notes:</b>
Rechargeable (as opposed to regular) AA batteries are 1.2v, not 1.5v. Four of those arranged in series supposedly make 4.8v, but I get 5.09 volts out for some reason. Works for me though!

ANYWAY guys I think this is pretty sweet! Sunlight streams into my device and at the other end I HEAR MUSIC."

"event","Asher and I listened to the data output of a computer keyboard today.

Materials:
Old keyboard with broken shift key
Cheap unamplified speakers
Scissors, batteries (4 AA in series), tape

Powering the thing was easy enough. We cut open the PS/2 cable and hooked up the power input and ground to the batteries.

Then we read a lot on <a href=""http://www.hth.com/filelibrary/TXTFILES/keyboard.txt"">how the computer and keyboard communicate</a> to fool the keyboard into thinking it was getting the go-ahead from the computer to transmit data back.

Finally, with the data line hooked up to speaker, and speaker going back to the negative battery terminal, we pressed keyboard keys.

The result: clicks, of very slightly varying pitches. Holding a key produces a series of rapid, evenly spaced clicks. The clicks aren't particularly interesting for music-making, which was what I had wanted, but oh well. It did what we wanted it to do, and that feels good enough."

So here's some pictures for you to enjoy, of my room. For those of you who don't already know, I live at: 1027 W. 34th St. Fluor Tower Room 408C LA CA 90007 (send me letters!

Classes start tomorrow, and I'm also excited about that.

It is time to check on my laundry...I'll be back to post next week about how classes are treating me, though probably I'll just talk about my Robotics class. If you didn't already know, I am majorly excited about my Robotics class. Also engineers. My bulletin board is absolutely full of events to go to where I can meet fellow engineers. Engineers are awesome people, I think.

The output is only 2.4 volts. So I plan to replace the two 1.2 volt batteries with a 9 volt rechargeable battery w/holder. Then I will have sufficient voltage to recharge an iPod, which is handy because I already have a iPod connector thingy that I tested on a 9 volt battery (Robin's iPod registered as charging) and also two wires with which to connect it that run in parallel with the indicator light (which can be turned off with a small switch that is inside the tin).

After that all I'll have to do is wait for my iPod to get back to me from Israel.

"event","<lj-cut text=""Gundam 00 spoilers"">Wow. The last anime series that actually got a proper emotional response out of me was Bokurano - a series that was dark, sad and aimed to make you connect with the characters as much as possible. I would never have expected a Gundam show, something I&nbsp;watch solely as a mindles fix of shounen fun, to have the same effect. The last sequence of episodes I've watched, though...seriously. Louise losing her family, her happiness and her hand just because a Gundam pilot was bored was something I hadn't expected - turning what I had seen as a minor character into a real source of hatred for the Throne Gundams. Consequently, I was happy as hell when Ali al Sarjhes shot two of them in cold blood.<br /><br />I wish I hadn't been. Using the Throne he stole from one of the dead pilots, he killed Lockon. They actually killed off one of the four main pilots, and did it fucking masterfully too. I honestly had tears in my eyes:-( *sighs* I liked him. I wonder how they're going to play this one out...the three left will be even more emo than normal, and as for Felt...damn.</lj-cut><br />"

For a guy who's sole purpose is to back up the main character, he has so many cool moments it's not funny. Plus his powers later in the series are awesome.<br />3. Code Geass: Lelouch (guessed by <div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://ryans-cupcake.livejournal.com/profile""><img width=""17"" height=""17"" src=""http://p-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" alt=""[info]"" style=""border: 0pt none ; vertical-align: bottom; padding-right: 1px;"" /></a><a href=""http://ryans-cupcake.livejournal.com/""><b>ryans_cupcake</b></a></div>).

Fullmetal Alchemist: Greed (guessed by <div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://wannabeking.livejournal.com/profile""><img width=""17"" height=""17"" src=""http://p-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" alt=""[info]"" style=""border: 0pt none ; vertical-align: bottom; padding-right: 1px;"" /></a><a href=""http://wannabeking.livejournal.com/""><b>wannabeking</b></a></div>).<b> </b>Probably the most open character in the series about his motivations.

<br><br><u>Ability Scores:</u><br>
<b>Strength-</b>14<br>
<b>Dexterity-</b>12<br>
<b>Constitution-</b>13<br>
<b>Intelligence-</b>13<br>
<b>Wisdom-</b>12<br>
<b>Charisma-</b>13
<br><br><u>Alignment:</u><br><b>Neutral Good</b> A neutral good character does the best that a good person can do. He is devoted to helping others. He works with kings and magistrates but does not feel beholden to them. Neutral good is the best alignment you can be because it means doing what is good without bias for or against order. However, neutral good can be a dangerous alignment because because it advances mediocrity by limiting the actions of the truly capable.<br>
<br><u>Race:</u><br><b>Humans</b> are the most adaptable of the common races. Short generations and a penchant for migration and conquest have made them physically diverse as well. Humans are often unorthodox in their dress, sporting unusual hairstyles, fanciful clothes, tattoos, and the like.
<br><br><u>Primary Class:</u><br><b>Bards</b> often serve as negotiators, messengers, scouts, and spies. They love to accompany heroes (and villains) to witness heroic (or villainous) deeds firsthand, since a bard who can tell a story from personal experience earns renown among his fellows. A bard casts arcane spells without any advance preparation, much like a sorcerer. Bards also share some specialized skills with rogues, and their knowledge of item lore is nearly unmatched. A high Charisma score allows a bard to cast high-level spells.
<br><br><u>Secondary Class:</u><br><b>Wizards</b> are arcane spellcasters who depend on intensive study to create their magic. To wizards, magic is not a talent but a difficult, rewarding art. When they are prepared for battle, wizards can use their spells to devastating effect. When caught by surprise, they are vulnerable. The wizard's strength is her spells, everything else is secondary. She learns new spells as she experiments and grows in experience, and she can also learn them from other wizards. In addition, over time a wizard learns to manipulate her spells so they go farther, work better, or are improved in some other way. A wizard can call a familiar- a small, magical, animal companion that serves her. With a high Intelligence, wizards are capable of casting very high levels of spells.

Anyways, enough doom and gloom. I'm 21! All old, mature and responsible...wait...I said no more doom and gloom, didn't I? Ah well - growing old is compulsory, growing up is optional. That's my story and I'm sticking to it. Had my party on Saturday, which went really well^^ Everyone had at least one other person they knew (not counting me, since supposedly I was the common denominator and all) and everyone also managed to get reasonably drunk (definitely counting me this time, not like I had a choice in the matter). So I'll call it a success.

Back to the real world, I have to finish my damn assignments by the end of next week, which is certainly do-able, if not fun in any way. I'll have to make sure to throw in some social stuff to distract myself. Jimmy and Becky want to double date with Katie and I, so that'll be a good start^^

Sure, student culture in Dunedin has always had the ""get drunk and burn a couch"" mentality...but this bad? Police had to push the fucking crowds back down to the Union Lawn and hold them there just to let the ambulance crews get to people who needed help. Thanks to the Code of Conduct that got passed last year, if anyone who was arrested on the weekend gets charged, they lose the right to study here. I was against that when it was passed. Now I'm totally keen.<br /><br />For the next month or so, if anyone asks what I do, I think I'll just tell them I'm a shelf-stacker at New World. It's less embarrassing than saying I'm a student at Otago University."

"event","Undie 500: An annual event, where students from Canterbury Uni drive down to Dunedin from Christchurch at mid-semester break of the second term. The cars must be worth less than $500 in total, are usually decorated insanely, and must make several stops at pubs along the way. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undie_500"">here</a> for more details and a couple of pics.<br /><br />Castle St: Hell. Alternatively, the most 'renowned' street in the Dunedin student area. If it's loud, stupid, involves drugs/fire/sex/animal cruelty/all of the above, it was done on Castle St first.<br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Fun times"">So this weekend was Undie weekend. This usually isn't a big deal, it just means the number of drunk students in the city rises a considerable amount. This time round...well, myself and some friends were walking back to Mark's car to head home about 2am. <br /> *group wanders down road*<br />*group steps over blood on street corner. Is comforted by fact that body on side of road is still moving*<br /> *group sees remnants of fire in middle of road.*<br /> *group sees new fire about 2m further down.*<br />*group sees party/riot - avoids*<br />*group gets to car, breathes sigh of relief.*<br /><br />Anyways. As we were driving off, we went past Castle St, which we were expecting to be basically a slaughterhouse. What we saw, though, was the street covered in broken glass and no one around at all. Kinda weird. I finally found out at work today what happened. Here's the description a workmate gave me, with my thoughts in brackets:<br /><br />""So someone parked a van in the middle of the road, and a few guys thought it would be fun to set fire to it <i>(as you do, when you're a drunken student).</i> Then the fire department comes along, and tries to put it out <i>(as you do, when you're the fire department and all). </i>The drunks weren't to pleased with this, so they tried to roll the burning van onto the firemen <i>(as you d-wait...WHAT?)</i>. Then the riot police showed up <i>(...)</i> and tried to protect the firemen...until one guy punched one of the cops, and then everyone started throwing bottles at them <i>(Oh for fucks sake...*headdesks*). </i>So yeah..they cleared the street.""<br /><br />I'd just like to make it clear. We're not <i>all</i> like this. </div><br />On a slightly different but not too much worse note: tomorrow is my first day of mid-semester break. I can sleep in...except I can't, since I have to report to the High Court at 9am for Jury Duty. *sarcasm* KEEN!! */sarcasm*"

"event","Another procrastinating update...though I really am working this time as well, honest! Linguistics has to be the only uni subject that not only allows but encourages the use of Google in 3rd year work. Weirdos. Anyways - current assignments to do in the next week:

-Finish Linguistics presentation
-Write History essay (Yawn. Damn Japanese history) 
-Philosophy article review
-Psychology lab report

Also, must make up music list for my 21st, and also tell the bar person what alcohols I want to make sure they have enough of. I saw a real lack of Midori when I went there to check the place out. Not good enough&gt;&lt; A guest list might be useful too, actually, I really should work out who's coming. 

Hmm...if anyone wants to help me with Linguistics, answer this: what is the difference between 'fast' and 'quick?' I know the answer, I want to see what people say^^"

"event","One more week to go before mid-semester break. I am...fairly well flooded with work atm, and will be for at least the next 3-4 weeks. At least it'll all be done before my birthday.

This week...well, I'll be looking forward to the end of it, though hopefully there are one or two things that might make it look a little better. First I have to worry about my next lab report...the lab of which I have tomorrow...why the hell am I still up? Bedtime. Now."

"event","Tired. Bed soon...

Started my Terry Pratchett collection, finally. Since the bookstores in Dunedin seem to suck as far as Pratchett goes, I've started with Thud! (exclamation mark part of the title, btw). It's a good book, although not my favourite. But hey, a start's a start. And thanks to Katie, I have Colour of Magic to read until I can get my next one.

Also: Without Saturdays at Ajay's, I think I would go insane. Seriously.

Ok. Work tomorrow, so bedtime now."

"event","In Linguistics this morning, we were discussing&nbsp;categorical prototypes&nbsp;(won't bother going into this, as it's simply a fancy name for a very simple idea), and a point the teacher raised struck me as fuuny. 

You often find, at least in literature, people saying things like ""I wish I was a bird!"" or something along those lines, say if they find a genie or whatever. Now I have this image in my head. 

Person: ""I wish I was a bird!"" 
*Genie turns them into a turkey* 
Person: ..... 
Genie: ""What? Not what you had in mind? HA, BE MORE SPECIFIC!!"" 

...Yeah, I know - small things etc etc."

That's all good but I don't think I am pretty and I don't have cute clothes. That is very fresturating. I can't spell either. (Obviously)!!! Oh yesterday went shopping with my Grandma and got really cute earings. I love American Eagle Outfitters but they can be so expensive. How depressing.

And then all of the world would crumble and die. Everyone would be depressed. Ok forget everything I just said. Oprah is awsome and that is that.

"event","Good, good day today! Got all dolled up with friend and went to the mall. Good stuff. Are mall sucks though. We have no good clothing stores and I just found out today that Orange Julius closed down for remodeling. UURRGGGGG!!!!!!!!! We don't even have a freaking Old Navy or Gap. For God Freaking Sake. I am going to go insane. I love chicago, it's awsome. I am listening to ""All That Jazz"". I think I have the chicken pox becuase I just got itchy all of the sudden. I hate school. I really don't want to go tommarow. Oh my god did I tell you how much I love Chicago. I hate the dark. It's not that I'm scared of it, it's just that I love being in really lit areas. It's really hard for me being backstage for a play because it's so dark. I got to go.

Thanx for reading!

"event","I waited all day to meet my friends friend, and right at the last moment she cancelled cause she's a little biatch.  Just kidding.  

Now I want to eat, even though I'm not hungry.  Whenever I'm depressed I eat.  It sucks.  Now I'm in my pajamas lounging around doing CRAP.  And I just realize that everyone, even people who aren't religious have crosses in their houses.  And a lot of people who aren't, don't.  Weird.  

My lips are so freaking chapped.  But I had a little facial, and it was very relaxing...or whatever.  Now I don't know what to do.  I think my friend's mom should take us to the store and get us each a pint of ice cream....

I'm bored.  I'm gonna shoot myself.  Just kidding.  Again.  But I am gonna shoot all the preppy 8th graders.  And the little short kid named Dakota....He stalks me.  I swear. 

Anyways, I have to go.  Thanks for reading...homie Gs....or whatever you gangstas say.  Bye"

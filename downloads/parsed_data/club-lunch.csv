"event","I HATE finals.
The rest of the world is out shopping and drinking cider and nogg and every light on the road is festive again, it's even raining and the pup is wearing a red bandana. 
Do finals make anyone else hurt all over? Because, I swear, every joint, every muscle, every past injury and especially my back and neck hurt like hell. 
I feel really old and rickety. Like some feable unsteady person masquerading as a sturdy college gal.
2 finals down, 3 to go. 
On a way happy note, Andrew gets to come home for Christmas (after much huff and puff because the navy is ... many things, but slow, and didn't tell the boys if and when they had leave until way late) and I am SO HAPPY because everyone ought to be able to come home during Christmas. SO! Let's round up as many people as we like and go ice skating. Yes? Oh say yes!! 

I hope the rest of you are doing faahbulously!! I miss you all and I can't wait to see you at the Club Lunch Christmas! 

Eternalmente,
Samwise"

"event","Before the 2001 inauguration of George Bush, he was invited to a get-acquainted tour of the White House. After drinking several glasses of iced tea, he asked Bill Clinton if he could use his personal bathroom. When he entered Clinton's private toilet, he was astonished to see that President Clinton had a solid gold urinal. That afternoon, George told his wife, Laura, about the urinal. ""Just think,"" he said, ""When I am president, I could have a gold urinal too. But I wouldn't do something that self-indulgent!"" 
Later when Laura had lunch with Hilary at her tour of the White House, she told Hilary how impressed George had been at his discovery of the fact that, in the President's private bathroom, the President had a gold urinal.
That evening, when Bill and Hilary were getting ready for bed, Hilary smiled, and said to Bill, ""I found out who peed in your saxophone."""

"event","Well Mere, 
Your fountain dipping sounds quite interesting I'm just glad I dont hve friends that would throw me in a fountain. Well last year we went to dinner and my friend stood on the table and told (literally) the whole restaurant that it was my birthday. (not a sober act mind you!) Cheesecake factory didn't like that one very much! But I'm glad you had a good birthday, and I promise that if Manis cooperates we will make it down there... hopefully more than once!!!! I can't wait to see ya! Love ya'll very mucho!

"event","Hey my loves ... ok, so I just wanted to say Hi to everyone and tell you guys that I love you more than you know (even if i dont call or whatever because Im really bad at stuff like that) ... anyways, one of my friends (my suitmate's boyfriend) was out here visiting and received a horrible phone call that his 24 year old brother had died the night before in his sleep.  This kind of gave me a wake-up call and made me realize that tomorrow really isnt promised and that I should let everyone that I love know just how much I care about them (thats you guys) ... so anyways, Im sorry that this is kind of a downer entry but it really is just to tell you guys that I love you and to remind you to tell everyone that you love how much you care about them. 

I hope to see you all very soon and be safe,
Love, Jenelle"

"event","Hey Guys ... So, I know that I have been MIA from the Live Journal for quite some time now and since I havent talked to some of you for a while now I figured I would catch everyone up on me I guess ...

So everything has been pretty good so far.  I still love SD but its no San Francisco for sure.  Classes these days are getting brutal so I have to kick my own ass into getting stuff done but i dont know how well thats working ... eating and watching tv or going out just sounds so much better than homework and studying!! haha

So lately everything has been going ok ... Ive been hanging out with Kasey a lot more than i use to but i really like it that way.  He practically lives in my dorm room with me these days and we are inseparable on the weekends.  He just got his own apartment that is closer to me and he moves in on the 15th so I guess Ill see how everything goes when that happens ... Im just happy that Ill have somewhere to go where i can cook real food and somewhere that I can go and just hang out in peace and quiet (something i never get here in the dorms) ... I seriously cant believe that ive been with kasey for over 8 months now ... ha ha its a big change from the one month and im bored method that i usually follow!!  But im really happy with him ... he is my home away from home when I cant be with you guys.

Recently we have started hanging out with Kaseys friends that are in the navy and its kind of weird.  We went to a party with all the guys in Kaseys shop and they are all either married or engaged (i was the only girlfriend) and most of them have had kids too and they are all really young! Last night me and Kasey had a double date with his friend (who is 21) and his pregnant wife (who is 20) ... its fun hanging out with these people because they are all really nice but its weird because it gets you in the mindset of ""I wanna be married and blah blah blah.""  Then I have to take a step back and say ""No I dont!!"" haha ... My family is so afraid that Im going to get married and drop out of school but worry not because i definitely wont let that happen.

So Ive been pretty happy lately but nothing can be going perfectly smooth ... School work is now at the unbearable stage, and there has been drama (which I hate) with Kaseys ex-girlfriend and some other stuff and you know that whole missing you guys things!

Alright well i better stop writing now b.c if it were me reading this I would have stopped a long time ago! haha ... I love you and miss you all!

Club Lunch for Life!! ~Jenelle

p.s. sorry this is mostly about Kasey ... he seems to be my life at the moment! : ("

Sorry for not going to the Incredibles gathering last night!!! I can't believe I missed it.  It wasn't intentional, I assure you.

"event","1. freaked out my friend by mentioning offhand how i wore a saran quick cover on my head as well as a tiara for every game of an entire giants season. she was weirded out, and i guess i understand why. a tall gangly punk guy then turned around, having overheard, and said, ""oooh you are like me! when the yankees lost, i ripped the head off my sisters doll with my teeth and now i wear it around my neck."" oh fucking man.
2. wore my entire goodluck outfit. like my test goodluck outfit. complete with neon socks, blue suede shoes, tiara, heinous jewelery, marissa's shirt and plastic bracelets.
3. proceeded to BREAK my nadyne plastic bracelet (do not worry, can be fixed!) while walking with shaunt (hot boy), yelled feck(*#$&(*#&@(*EDFEIPFJOI*(!()!!!!! at the top of my lungs and then made the mistake of tryign to explain why THIS plastic bracelet would be tragic to break.
4. took midterm. girl asked me if i knew the answer to number one (after test). proceeded to tell her ""No, I totally pulled that one OUT OF MY ASS."" she had apparently never heard THAT term before, and neither had the other girls sitting next to me.
5. contradicted teaher in amer cult saying that there was no deep meaning to the times in riverdance when the dancers had their arms up and waving. they were just doing shitty irish dancing. tradtional irish dancing = no arms moving. she said it had some symbolization about irish oppression. i said that was bull. negative points for me.
6. now i am lighting fires and NOT studying for my midterm. bully for me. fires make me happy.
7. i had lunch with the sole guiy in my womens studies class. he has a RIDICULOUSLY nice body. hence, he is uber hot. but alas he smokes pot. lovely. well, never said i couldn't admire the stupids of this world did I? (we were studying for our midterm. not that we did anything productive. not that it mattered as the test was easy.)

guys wow i am procrastinating to the point of me being disgusted wiht myself. GO AWAY KATIE!!! ahhh that's another thing i did, in the middle of the hallway, i was muttering to myself, telling myself to please focus on the task at hand (walking down the stairs) and then realized i was muttering out loud and then said quite loudly ""QUIT TALKING TO YOURSELF KATIE!!!"" good god. i'm in too deep and i'm trying to keep... up above... instead of going under"

"event","Hi everybody! Long time no update-- I'm sorry. I'll make it short and sweet. It's Midterm season! As some of you already know...or at least Katie does. Today was a day of small, extremelly irritating things that went wrong. First I get to school for my early class-- 9:35, thus very tired. I have tea. I sit down, with notebook to read a book that I have a midterm on tomorrow and I have not yet (and still) read. I move to get something and Whosh! There goes the tea. Allll over my lap, my notebook, my backpack, my jeans and the floor. Just sat there for a sec, dumping the water off the notebook and onto the floor and looking around in disbelief. If only you could go back a few seconds...oh wow. Go get paper towels. Go to writing, get in goup to talk about something, wave arm and get pen stuck in pony tail. Then am in the middle of a sentance when I bite my tongue Soooooo very hard and yell OW! Skip astro lecture to go work on this big paper I have due tomorrow for jour and the one micro film roll that I want-- January 1875-- is GONE! Out of all of them, mine is gone!! Hours later I find another one and the stupid feeder spits it all out and I have to roll it up from like 6 feet away, much to the amusement of a guy sitting by me. Now West just piddled on the rug b/c she gets so happy to see ppl. ARGH! It is so ridiculous it is funny. But MAN, my tongue realllllly hurts. Anyway, I have to go write a paper comparing the SF CHRON of 1875 to that of 1975. Let's hope I have all the info I need b.c there's no going back to the library....Guess what I whipped out? MLA!! Ahhh good ol' MLA.... hehe. Found a brilliant article about ""An attempt is being made by a portion of the press to check the growing evil wrough by the grossly sensual and indecent exhibition on the burlesque stage, which is a disgrace to the theatrical managers..."" January 16th, 1875, San Francisco Chronicle. Any ideas??? Heh heh, it's great-- the Can-Can!!!!"

"event","So I am absolutely in love with my campus here at Davis, it is gorgeous and sunny and beautiful. Not much like good ol' foggy p-town. I am getting along great with my roommates, they are all awesome girls. So what have i been up to.....well......I finally started classes today. YAY!!!! I started with english. I have a grad student teaching the class, and I have high hopes for her. She seems really dedicated and helpful. My class later today is environmental issues, which i am really excited to go to. I have seen Rashad a bunch, we always run into eachother, and Michael stopped by to visit us. I also ran into Alice at the bookstore today, which was fun!! On my second night i went to a frat house party....interesting. Didnt stay long though cause the cops showed up. I met this absolutely AWESOME kid named Kevin, a friends of my roommates, hes super cool. One night we played capture the flay against another dorm hall in our huge quad. It was at night and we had a blast. I ended up making a girl eat dirt cause she slipped after i tagged her....whoops. And last night we tryed to get into the Grad, which is our schools night club, but the line was outrageous so we ended up going to a house party. But that was no good cause i couldnt even get in the door. Wow, these parties are crazy like. I guess rashad found a good one last night though, cause he said he had fun. So i am glad to hear everyones doing good, except for the whole short girl thing.....what can i say mere, there are advantages and disadvantages for every size. And sam, let me know what to do about the beach thing, and my angry letter will be in the mail. Alright girls, my second class in half an hour.....Luv ya all. Have fun, even with the homework load....

"event","hello fellow members of club lunch,

Well this past weekend was in fact my birthday weekend and I am happy to say that I had a blast with Katie and Gabby.  You girls rock-hardcore.  Oh, and for those of you who haven't wished me a happy birthday, you know who you are, well you can rot in hell.  Of course I'm joking you fools. Buhahaha.  Don't get your panties in a bunch.  I always hated that saying but it's quite funny when you're the one using it.  Aside from my birthday a lot has happened here at the infamous UC Santa Cruz.  Like oh say my first sighting of an actual penis.  Katie I informed you of this horrific incident so you can skip over the next few lines if you want.  I was standing at the bus stop and this hippie was wearing nothing but one of those shawl things that girls usually put over their bathing suits when they go to the beach.  Well, a big gust of wind blows by and up goes the shawl, revealing to the horror stricken bystanders an ugly ""thingy.""  After that sighting I can't imagine how guys could allow themselves to walk around knowing that they possess such a gruesome companion as that one.  What else...ummmmm. Oh yeah on my way to my dorm room after a scrumptious lunch in the dinning hall on Friday,I came back to my room to find a note posted on the door.  On the note it stated in bold lettering ""Do Not Disturb for 1 hour.""  So you can guess what my room mate was doing in my room. Yucky yucky.  Anyway, I really needed my stuff from my room so I called my mom to ask her for some assistance.  After informing her of the note she bluntly stated, "" You know they're fucking in there.  call her and get your stuff.""  So i took my mom's advice and called her and she said to give her a few minutes before i came back in.  So as you can imagine I'm horrified at the thought that she committed the fucky fucky in my room. So yeah, I had a pretty interesting week last week but it was worth mentioning to you girls.  So that's about it.  Thanks for your time and take the few stories I told you into serious consideration for it may happen to you.  Oh and Caitlin I'm confused with your frat party thing.  Did you or didn't you that is the question.  Get back to me will ya.

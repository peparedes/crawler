Someone also suggested Freelancing with mainly writing & proofreading and some administration if we have to (but that would only be a small part if we did it at all) but Ive no idea how to go about starting that.

Am thinking of writing to papers/magazines/publishers etc with a bit of detail about us, contact numbers etc and see where that gets us. Other than that weve really no idea"

For a country that's supposed to be multi-racial there is still a lot of racial judgement. It doesnt matter where we go were almost always asked where were from originally and when we reply that we were born here the response is almost always the same ""but you dont look english"" and ok thats true but that doesn't mean were not. We've lost jobs because were ""not english"" (and yes, weve been told that directly) I know there's laws against that but try proving that was why you lost the job ... or didnt get it in the first place! And when were out with our brother the difference in the way were treated is amazing sometimes! We shouldn't have to put up with that.

Plus our whole life is dictated. Were supposed to be working Monday to Friday from 9-5 (if not more) when were out were told what we can and can't do, what we can and can't say. How we act. Even, in some places, where we can and can't go! Thats not a life, that's an existence. I want more than that for my life...."

Weve been trying to almost isolate ourselves recently because we know that theres a chance we may not be staying here long, but that doesnt help us now and it doesnt help us in the long run. If we do stay on these are the people were going to be socializing with, living with, working with for the next three years. How is isolating ourselves gonna help that? But then if we make an effort now and do end up being kicked out, its going to its going to hurt.

I want to talk to them about the things that matter to me, about the things that interest me but I know they won't be interested and if they are they wont understand.

I offer all I have, knowing they wont take it because they respect me. Maybe thats why it feels so wrong to me. I still remember the first guy we met here and maybe shes right, maybe that is why I loved him so much. He respected me, he acknowledged my existence, although we'd never ask he made it clear from the very start that he was always there if we needed anything and never asked for anything in return.

There arent the words to explain how Im feeling and what im thinking. I can't explain the way I react even in a situation where I feel safe because often even I dont know why, and even when I do I dont really want to discuss the reasons why with many people who are often just strangers to me."

In short, they spent half an hour trying to talk us into dropping out the course voluntarily. They were actually really annoyed when we didnt go into that meeting saying that basically were not willing to put anymore time and effort into a course we may not complete.

The director of student services complained that hes going to get in trouble for letting us stay. They kept telling us that at the end of this we may not be cleared etc etc.

Theyve given us till 22nd Jan to get an appt with a psych, for the psych to write up the report and then for us to be cleared, which with christmas in the middle will be practically impossible! I offered to go privately for the assessment but they wouldnt let me as the psych wldnt be independant. Even if we paid the uni so they could pay for a psych privately to avoid the wait on the NHS they wouldnt let us.

Going to talk to the union today about whether or not its possible to appeal that decision AND take up their offer of the assessment, they reckon it's going to be very complicated but they havent said its impossible. Havent got long to talk to them today but it's a start"

So, went to union to tell them what had gone on as far as we knew so far. They said the best thing to do was to go to the health office personally and get a copy of that letter, if it was something small that could be discussed then and there then that would be the best thing to do, otherwise we were to come back to the union and talk about where to take it from there including how to appeal and what should go in the appeal.

Anyway, went to the OH department and the letter we were supposed to get was dated the 3rd of Sept, they have the right address so not sure why it didnt get to us. Despite what I was told it doesnt actually say we havent got clearance, it says we havent got clearance YET. They want us to see a specialist and theyre worried about time because weve missed the placement now, so they dont think weve got enough time to complete the course. They want a meeting with us, the director of student services and our Programme director to see if theres any room for manoeuvre.

Were willing to do the placement over the holidays or even over Mondays and Tuesdays when we havent got lectures and put in the extra work this year so long as it gets us qualified in the end. But that means theyve got to be willing to extend the deadline for the essay thats based on the placement and put in a bit of extra time for any other things we may need.

The union are willing to come to that meeting with us so hopefully that should be ok so long as theyre willing to be flexible.

Either way, Im not so worried about it now that we know we havent definitely not been cleared. This is a lot easier to fight than a direct statement saying we havent got clearance."

"event","Does language actually hold you back from understanding other people?


Think about it, animals and babies pick up a lot more than people (in general anyway). They seem to know what you want or need even though they cant understand you through language. They seem to either understand your little quirks and the way you react to things or just accept it because language doesnt make them have a need to understand it.

If you go abroad to a place you dont speak the native language you assume you wont understand them, therefore you dont. Once u stop 'knowing' you wont understand them you pick up a lot more, either through body language or just by sensing it. Same applies if you go to a place you only speak the language a little, because u know ull understand a little, you actually pick up a lot more than you understand through the language itself."

Have a wasps nest underneath out bedroom window though which was fine when we first arrived because we didnt open the window, they didnt come in. Worked quite well!

But... the last few days weve been finding and either letting out if we can, or killing 3/4 wasps a day. We actually even got woken up this morning by being stung by one! Somehow they seem to be getting in through the wall where the the nest is. Spoke to the landlord, our actual landlord is out the country, but when i signed the contract I was told that as he's abroad a lot when he isnt available his wife will look after the houses (he has 7!) so I spoke to her. She said she would see what she can do and come round and have a look. She hasn't bothered to turn up.

Called the council, they cant do anything till mid October because theyre fully booked till them but there is no way we can live like this till either mid October or till they die. Although were not allergic to wasps we do react really badly to them.

Going to the uni later today to see what they can recommend we do seeing as they recommended the house!

Although saying that I don't know any other way but we had an appointment with our GP today about the health check for our university course and she got all excited because it went really well and from the things she said, and said she'll put, it doesnt sound as if its going to be a problem. And I'm just I don't know... lost is about the only word I know to describe it. Don't get me wrong, we need to move out of this house and Canterbury is the place we all love and so as were moving out I wouldnt want to go anywhere except for there but I just wish it was a course we all want to do and we'd all enjoy. Social work's ok, if its what she wants to do then it will help her to develop her confidence and self-esteem and obviously it will help with our work in the future and social works well paid but it's just not what I'd choose and some of the others hate it with a passion! and the thought of three years during which shell probably front most of the time (not counting when were co-conscious which for various reasons weve been doing more and more) i just wish I had more time to myself away from this house, away from the constraints that we have here. I love her, and I'd do anything for her, especially as its only three years, so please dont take this the wrong way im just ranting. 

Anyway, on a more positive note at least the appointment this morning went ok and moving out of this place will probably be the best thing that ever happened to us. The course starts on 11th September (which thinking about it is really early for a degree course) but we'll probably have to be down there at least a week beforehand and so we've only got a month before we leave.

Says it all really! So feeling a little happier about it now, plus Russells still not completely decided but he said hes leaning towards going now, which is more than before.

On top of that we've got an interview at Canterbury on wednesday, hoping it will go well because out of all the uni's we applied to thats the only one that we can all agree we like!

On top of the interviews weve got a written task, so not sure how that will go yet as we havent even got any information on what itll be on etc. but theres always clearing or next year if we dont get in this time around.

Had such a stressful week with Hayley, she went back to insisting we dont exist. I never have and never will know why she does it! Actually, this time I probably do. Tara was speaking to one of her friends and caused a few problems as shes too highly strung for her own good! So Hayley seemed to decide it would be easier if none of us were here, which only ended up causing more problems between us.

He means the world to both of us and although thats why we wanted him to know thats also the reason we were scared to tell him, rejection or a bad reaction from him would have been awful.

He just accepted it and was fine with it, he said he wanted to get to know me properly as me rather than as her. He had a lot of questions but then wouldnt anyone?! Answered them though and he seemed ok. He just basically said hed just gained sister and I really think thats the way he sees it.

In general I can separate between what people say when theyre angry and what people say because they mean it and I can let most things go straight over my head without letting it affect me too much because I am who I am and I'm not changing for anybody.

But there is one thing I can be told that WILL hurt and WILL affect me, and thats that I'm selfish. That was the one thing I was told the most when I was growing up, the one word that I associate with most things that happened back then because it was their excuse for what they did. I know it was just an excuse and that nothing they did was ever or could ever be my fault but there is still that link there for me. I spend a lot of time trying to avoid ever being told that im selfish for that reason.

When we were doing our counselling course ages ago I had a huge problem with one particular part of that course. They spend ages trying to teach us that we had to spend at least an hour a day of 'me-time' a day and that although it was bad to be too selfish it was ok, and in fact encouraged, to be a little selfish, more than most people were in their lives. I could never be happy with that and I could never accept it.

As for being selfish in relation to her, God I would give her anything she ever asked for, I would do anything for her.. and she knows it! Not only that but I would never hurt her, ever, no matter what the circumstances."

Hardly anyone offline knows about me and those that do refuse to use my name let alone acknowledge that its me rather than her even though I know they can tell us apart. There is one exception, ok she wont use my name but then she doesnt call me by her name either and she does speak to me as a separate person and I love that. I'm tired of being treated as if I'm her, I need room, time and space to be me without having to hide how I am. I need the time to explore things I like to do, the things I want to do. I dont think there's anyone I know that I don't know through her.

There are so many things that have happened in the past that I need to work through too, I spent so long back then just trying to keep us alive, keep us moving forward and allowing her and the others time to work through the things that had affected them in the way it had affected them. I always had to be the strong one, the one that let nothing bother her, or at least not let it show, because I needed to be there for the others and to keep everything running the way it should. Except now I need to accept that it is ok to let things hurt me, to accept that it is ok to still hurt from the things back then no matter how long ago it was and to work through it myself. I can't keep convincing myself that nothing happened because if I do it'll destroy me eventually."

I really need to find some time to do that once shes back up to date with her work, also really need to find some time to go places because I want to, rather than because I have to or because she's going. Can't keep losing myself in her life."

1. I'll respond with something random I like about you.
2. I'll tell you what song/movie reminds me of you.
3. I'll name something we should do together.
4. I'll say something that only makes sense to you and me (or just me).
5. I'll tell you my first/clearest memory of you.
6. I'll leave you a quote that is somehow appropriate to you.
or, I will include an icon just for YOU in my reply)
7. I'll ask you something that I've always wondered about you.

"event","Ok, so itll probably take longer for us to get our application back from there as its in very very late but we've reapplied to Canterbury uni! It's where we see as home, where we feel most comfortable, where we're most relaxed, where we can actually be at our happiest. She wasnt going to before now because it's so far from her brother but despite that it is where were all happiest and even after 3 years its still where she sees as home. So we've reapplied, I know were at a disadvantage applying so late but we can try"

"event","I don't understand why people would want to spend time with me. I know I have people that do seem to care about me and do seem to like me but I thought that was because I had something that they wanted, something I could give them, not because they actually cared about me for who I am whether or not I had anything to give.

I was talking to someone earlier who genuinely cares about me for who I am, not for anything else and I believe that, I just dont understand. The people that really matter to me dont seem to care what, if anything, they get from me, they spend time with me, they talk to me because they actually care, because they want to.

I don't understand how people can be so kind and gentle with me without wanting anything in return, without expecting me to give my life in repayment without wanting to hurt me in someway. I dont have any simple answers, but I do hope that eventually, given time, Ill learn to believe in myself more. I don't know whether or not I'll ever understand this whole friendship thing but I do know there are people that truly care and don't seem to want to hurt me and I don't know how to react to that but for now that doesnt matter. What does matter is that I know they are there and I know they have the patience and understanding to just sit with me and wait when I get scared, when I over react and when I push the boundaries just to see how far I can push them before theyll hurt me and for now, at least, thats all that really matters."

"event","We all know that life isn't always easy and we all know that life isn't always fair. That much is a given to pretty much everyone, but if for two minutes people could stop complaining about what's wrong with their life and what they want and actually stop and think about what they HAVE got as opposed to what they haven't got and figure out how to get the things they want that they don't yet have then they will find that not only will life seem easier but maybe, just maybe they could actually get further than the rut they're stuck in at the moment.

I know that life isnt always easy, and I know that people don't always get what they want but it's all about compromise and you have to remember that the world doesnt owe you anything. If you want anything you have to work for it. There is no reason why it should be any other way.

If your happy with your life the way it is, then great! If not work out ways to change it, don't just sit there complaining about the way things are without actually working to change anything."

"event","Been meaning to for a while, there was a reason I didn't before but for the life of me I can't even remember what that was!

Anyway, just got back from driving the essay to our tutors and before I even get home I have a sarky e-mail from our tutor about how it's supposed to be posted not driven and therefore he's threatening not to mark it, I checked the handbook and nowhere does it state that it has to be posted, only that it has to be with him by the cut-off date (which is tomorrow) so sent him a reply stating that and the fact that I know for certain were not the only one that has had to drive an essay to get it in on time!

Besides that it's actually been another quite productive day, we seem to be getting quite a lot done which is good because weve been letting things slip a lot recently. I think it's because it's finally becoming spring.

Got a bit of money left over from what we were given to spend on uni books, stationary etc so was thinking I might go out for a day somewhere seeing as I can't even remember the last time I went somewhere just for the sake of going!"

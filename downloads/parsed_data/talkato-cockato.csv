It's a sad story. Feeling like you are losing your best friend. We have been friends for four years. It has just been the last couple months that we have grown apart. I wish I could get her back. Maybe one day..

I have also sworn off girls named Megan and Whitney. If that is your name, I'm sorry but we will NEVER be friends. Your loss, totally. Girls with names like that should be shot and the ambulance should not be called. 

I miss Katie and Amanda and Victoria. I never talk to any of them, but they will always be my friends. Always. 

The New Year started off so great. I have plans for February that give me butterflies ever time i think about them. Except for being sick I dont think i could be any happier. I love him, and no matter what happens he will always be my first love. He is the biggest Asshole I have ever met but he is still the love of my life. 

For all of you that are still my friends, I am going to be in Arizona the beginning of February. I know I am not very good at calling people and making plans..or keeping them for that matter, but if you mean anything to me I will make an effort to see you when I am there. I am coming down to look at the Art Institute of Phoenix. Hopefully that is the way the cupcake crumbles. 

I love you all..(you know who are.)

Have a fucking awesome year and don't let anything get in your way of you getting what you want. I know I won't."

"event","it is easy to push away the ones we love so much. sometimes it takes a few words, or maybe none at all to push someone away. i keep thinking about the past few days and they have been a true mess. i just dont understand them. but after today, a very looonnng day, i feel like some things just aren't meant for us to understand. it takes a big person to admit fault and an even bigger one to move on. we will never be perfect. nothing in this world is. the weather is even one or two degrees off. so if the weather is off, why do we think people won't be. we all have our day, or even at time...days. no matter how long it takes for something to get back to normal remember to love those who u push away because u never know when they'll just be gone for good. a lot of times we feel so passionate about one thing or another and feel that the feeling needs to be shared. sometimes you regret saying things that are the truth because u dont expect the impact that words carry. but since an early age you are told to always be honest and speak freely. and while it is important to tell the truth it is also important to be considerate of your words, actions, thoughts, etc. we live, laugh and love. its all a part of life."

"event","guess it just doesn't matter. i mean i dont understand how i can feel bad about nothing at all. after all i didnt say that you sucked today so i shouldn't be upset. but i guess i just feel like maybe it was my fault. idk. i guess. yesterday was our 6 month anniversary and the day after we can't even hold a conversation. maybe im not sensitive maybe that was just a mean thing to say. i mean, yeah u might have been playing around but then say that. dont let me believe all day that im wrong n i shouldnt have thought that way. just put your pride aside and apologize. earlier today i told u that i wasn't ""trippin"" over it and i wasn't. i mean after hearing u say ""damn nigga"" and then ""babe, you suck"" i just floated off in my own world. i guess i just will grow accustomed to that. but then where does ur part come in? its funny how u can talk 2 everyone else today but me. a relationship gets hard sometimes and when it gets hard it gets really hard. and the funny thing is no matter how badly i feel i still am in love with this person who won't share a conversation with me. i mean i guess when u tell someone u need time to yourself or i'll call back later u think about what happened, think about the solution, call the person back, talk about it, apologize etc. i cant really just let things go especially when i feel bad. i jus want to own up to my responsibilites in whatever happened n when its done its done. but when u decide that we dont have to talk about n e thing and that everything will be fine when u talk to me again ummmm thats not how it works. at least say something...like yeah i was wrong, or i wasn't wrong. dont just drag it out. because here it is day 2...still no happy anniversary, and im still wondering if i was wrong for not appreciating the fact that i suck. but im living for the moment. and at this moment i am still in love with you. and will continue to be. we are different and we are going to have disagreements, they just suck (no pun intended)."

"event","i wish i had a better way to deal with stress n shit...  i dont though. i feel like i can't deal with stuff a lot. its like i dont know my capabilities. i second guess everything about me. second guess my decisions. i lack confidence in the things that i decide to do or my judgements. im not as strong as i thought i was. takes someone to break u to realize your capabilities. so i feel broken. just want to be fixed. i can see how someone can paint a beautiful picture on the outside but be in pain and hurt on the inside. either way i have to put on a smile and seem happy, jovial, etc. when on the inside i feel like shit. dont know why i even had to put myself in the situations that i do. im so damn sensitive i hate it. y cant i just take everything with a smile and keep going. i gotta analyze. am i happy w/me? idk n e more. im starting to feel like the old me again...holding stuff in just because i dont want to get judged. because i know my problems aren't big to anyone else. and i dont wanna sound stupid or sensitive. im so tired of being called that shit. im not sensitive im me. i cant help it. im not tough... i want to be. i cry...everyday over something. one thing/person, both, anything. dont look at me wrong because i'll feel bad. don't question me because i'll feel stupid. don't challenge me because i'll feel threatened. don't correct me because it means i don't know what im talking about. don't brush off my concerns because it means you aren't interested. dont yell at me because thats mean. dont disrespect me because im not disrespectful. don't talk down on me because im not stupid. dont be sarcastic because i hate that shit. dont say u understand when u dont. don't bullshit me because im the bullshitter. i dont listen well, dont pay attention, dont like certain foods,hate following directions, and im hard headed. sorry. thats just who i am. im loving, caring, compassionate, sensitive, picky, generous, self conscious, nice, likable and i ask a lot of questions. i question everything so that i can say that i can know everything. there's a thin line between what i like and what i dont like. a lot of people make me smile but only a few make me happy. someone else wants to be me but there's only one me. i loved high school. i was hated. loved. but respected. i dont have my shit together. i dont want to be alone. i think about my wedding. i think about my family. i think about my relationship. i think about my dad. i hope i make him proud. i think about how my nephew won't know his grandfather. i think about why. i think about clothes. i was smarter than the last 3. i ended the last 3. i want to cut my hair. im too scared to do it. i wish it were longer. i wish i wasnt so hairy. i wish my skin was better. i need to work out. i need a work out. i need to shut up. and stop writing to myself. i had an f'd up day. i need to talk to you."

NOOOOOOOOO WAYYYYYY... its weird b/c its a way that i kind of write to myself/that special someone..ahem jerome ahem. now what shall i write about? i could backdate this entry to like 3 wks ago when j came 2 visit me. yaaaayyy! that was like the best time of my life. honestly i just felt so happy and at ease with everything. didn't really care about much, except us. that visit took my mind off of a lot of stuff that i probably would have just locked myself up n my room and thought about all day. school is really tough without having ur best friend around. i mean when u think about it you do most of the things in your everyday life, from pre-school through high school with one particular person. this is one of the things that i am doing alone....all alone for the next 2.6 years. it sucks a lot and i really don't want 2 get used to spending everyday locked away in my room. i think im getting depressed. i never really have been depressed before so i wouldn't know. but sometimes i don't feel like waking up in the morning. i dont even know how i make it through the day. if it weren't for j i really don't know how i would be able to do a lot on my own. idk if he really realizes it but i depend on him a whole lot now. he's the only one who can really cheer me up and just listen to me cry and complain. sometimes i physically feel sick because of all of this stuff going on right now. im never one to be constantly sad, scared or just not me. i wish i wasn't so sensitive or just a stronger willed person. i let a lot of stuff get to me. i take everything personally, and i don't know how to change it. its who i am. i wish i could take being put down but i can't. and i don't even know what to do to get the point when i can understand. i'll write more later....gotta go"

now when i look at this picture i laugh. just because i could never imagine us being together in a serious relationship. as bad as i wanted to become serious with jerome i would have never thought that he felt the same way about me. i guess we both look really nervous or anxious in this pic. we probably were thinking the same thing...scared, not knowing what that pic would mean months down the line. i wish i could have predicted the future from this pic. this was actually like one of our first pics we ever took together. its like a reminder of everything we went through together.....yeah and i definitely had a boyfriend in that pic lol...whatever he was a loser and jerome is cuter lol..but yeah just remembering all those times when we felt anxious, nervous, scared and goofy around each other just because we knew that we liked each other and didnt know how to pursue each other. i wish we could go back and relive those times. 
so on july 8 2006 i said yes to a nervous and fast breathing jerome asking me to be his girlfriend and make it official. while i was watching i might need security not thinkin anything about what jerome asked me i was remembering all those times we spent together and how far we came from that very first pic we had taken together. its definitely destiny that we are together and its really funny how important pictures are to our relationship. i mean i did meet him while he was taking his senior pictures and i did work at a portrait studio...just a big huge conicidence. 
soooo basically i love my boyfriend. he's my best friend. my everything. he talks to me when im sad. he lets me cry whenever i feel like it. he doesnt laugh at me...that much. he talks to me about anything and he's basically just like me. and now that we're far away it helps to have him there everyday. i cant wait until we see each other again.
i love you baby, happy two months....muah!

"event","when the loneliness starts to set in then what do you do? i dont know. all that i can is cry and think about all of the good times and memories that we share. but i cant cry forever. i cant even sleep.everytime i think about the memories my heart aches and i feel less and less complete. i feel like i am missing a very important part of me. i feel like i have no life or energy to move on throughout my day. i just want to lay around and miss you all day. i guess absence does make the heart grow fonder but i didnt even imagine it would be like this. i have no one who i care about, here, to make new memories with. its hard to start over fresh when u have basically spent part of your life surrounded by the same people and now you are forced to do everything on your own. Loneliness feels like a force that has embodied everything that is me. it is so hard to show a smile on my face when i know that inside i feel sad and depressed. loneliness is like a bottomless pit, it feels like you are all alone.... loneliness. it gives you time to think about who you are and what the people in your life mean to you. i never analyzed myself so much...thought about my best friend so much....wished that i could change everything... the miles between us cause hurt. i feel like im missing part of me. with that being said now what do i do? i can't cry everyday because i did that before and its not a good thing to do. i cant always feel like i had to do something differently or that i can change everything. when there are moments like this when i have no one to talk to all i can do is cry and think. think about the past. think about what is going on now...and think about what is to come. love endures all things. i know that this is true love. my heart aches to be whole again and to experience the joys of love and friendship. this is going to be one of the hardest things i have ever had to deal with in my life. i wish i didn't have 2 deal with it alone. i love you so much that i can't even think about doing anything without you. please god just help me to be strong for us. i know i can't be sad forever. i can't cry the distance away. i wish i could do something but this is god's plan for us. i just love you. i cant even describe how much or how or why i just know that i do. just like i know that i have to blink or eat or even pee. i just know that i love you and that i miss you and that i cant wait until we are together again.

guess its time to write in my livejournal huh?
aight so my day was okay today i guess...nothing really exciting happened. y do i seem suprised...nothing much really suprises me these days. its funny how much u think about someone. no matter how far away you are it always seems like we are faaaaaar away. i feel so selfish at times b/c i just feel like i miss u that much. man school is about 2 blow me liiike..i can tell. i got it bad...like usher said. man its gonna be so hard to leave on friday. everytime i think about it my heart drops. its like a part of me has to leave one of the most important things in my life. i just dont want 2 be alone. i wasnt prepared to not have my #1 source of support, miles away from me. i would give anything to have him there with me. it feels like we invested too much into this relationship for it to end...ending it isnt an option for me. i have a lot of faith in us and i know we'll be okay. i just really dont want 2 feel lonely. im scared of so much....like us not being able to be there for each other....like off the 2am i want 2 talk about something that is bothering me..idk if u are always gonna be there for me, school and other projects take up a lot of time. tryin not 2 sound selfish but its the truth. i want so much love and attention. im a girl though. and im really sensitive on top of that. 
sometimes i dont think im prepared for whats really about to happen. especially with all thats about to unravel in this next year or so. aight so im about 2 make a list of everything that bothers me...not really bothers me but that i often think about, here it goes;
1.distance/loneliness
2.amount of time spent together
3.b.stew
4.college sh!t/transferring or whatever
5.distance
lets just basically call this, project atlanta....bcuz i think if i wasnt actually going to be in atlanta, 4 out of 5 of the things listed would actually be gone off of my list. well the first joint is basically because its going to be difficult to go from seeing someone at least 2 days a week and talking all day to seeing about 2 times every few months or so and squeezing in phone time after a whole day of classes and homework on top of that. its a challenge to juggle a full load of classes and a relationship. a long distance relationship on top of that. okay well the amount of time spent together is kind of like #1.... so i cant really elaborate on that any further. except for the fact i gotta stack chips so that i can take some flights... aight so #3 is kind of out of my control. i guess the only thing that bothers me about that is that its gonna take a lot of time up so i just hope that we can do is make sure we remember 2 talk to each other even when we are too busy. im just really anxious to see how all of this is going to work itself out. all i want is a little bit of attention some time...and thats about it. #4 is in my control however, if i can't get enough money from whatever school i decide to transfer to, i will be at clark atlanta. i decided today that i would stop stressing myself out over schools. i have to make my educational experience my own and complaining about it isnt going to fix problems that have been affecting clark since forever. its just something i have to come to terms with. and #5 distance..its just like #1..it just is what it is. 2 b continued..................................... im tired of typing"

we had a lot of fun this weekend. it felt so right 2 spend all weekend with him. just me n my boyfriend...perfect. doing what we do best (besides each other) sleeping, and getting fat. i was just thinking about us one day having our own place. and how we will just spend the weekend laying around, in love, and eating lol. he makes me feel so special just by the way he looks at me or holds me in his arms.. i love it. there's not a better feeling than that. 4 or 5 yrs from now i hope that we have us firstly, and secondly a place together. i want to take care of my babe. cook for him, take care of the cleaning and everything...all the wifey duties. i loved showing him how 2 cook lol it was the cutest thing ever. but yeah anywayz since i have 2 live n the moment im just more than satisfied about my relationship and my boyfriend. i really appreciate when he makes sacrifices just for me. it shows how committed he is to us.. i couldnt ask for anything more. he's everything i wanted and i feel that i finally deserved. although it took me 3 times before that lol i finally have something special. everyday im more in love with his intelligence, ambition, just overall swag. i cant really explain it. i love his personality...everything about it. even when he gets on my nerves i love him. 1 month yesterday, i cant wait until 1 year.... 

since i only have like 9 or 10 more days left until i have 2 go back 2 school :-( im just trying to make the most out of everything. no time for arguing, being sad or anything negative. i gotta make room for happiness and making sure i enjoy the last days of my summer with my babe. we have a big year coming up. i know there are gonna be a lot of long and lonely ass nights where i just want to sleep next 2 him or feel him breathe. but those moments are going to be what is going to hold us together. remembering when we used to wake up in the middle of the night across the bed from one another and then squeeze in close once we realize we were too far apart. im going to miss sooooo much about us. i wish i didnt have 2 go through this year without him but everything happens for a reason.

its been a while..the only thing that has changed is my nephew coming on july 21 but other than that :-) so its like 7 days until my one month anniversary...yay!!!! it seems like it took forever 4 one month 2 come but i guess its because it feels like we've already been together for longer than one month. its almost irrelevant considering how close our friendship was...its not like i didnt know what i was getting myself into. 
as each day goes by i also get closer and closer to leaving for school. i realy hate 2 think about it because it makes me really sad. i feel really alone when i think about not having my best friend around to make everything all better. it takes a lot of sacrifices to make a long distance relationshop work and i think that i am prepared. i can only hope for the best and remember that its not all about me its about us. geez i really want some water w/lemon right now. yum. but ne ways, i just really cant believe this is happening 2 me like this... i know it will make me much stronger. i can't bear to break his heart or mine...by stupid bullshit..
speaking of stupid bullshit...im just waiting for stupid stuff 2 happen w/the losers at clark. they b hatin soooo hard. i like the haters...lol... jealousy means u r doing something right so just smile and let them do what they do. i never really been the type to care about bad things people say. just gotta let it roll off your shoulders and understand that some people hate b/c they admire you.

hehe...i like that pic.. someone special to me took it... speaking of someone special. i had a difficult day today. i walked in my dad's house during lunch and just started crying. i know one day it will get a lot easier for me to just go through the day without feeling upset over something that i had no control over. its really hard to hold onto memories of someone that you lost because you so badly want to relive the memory. everytime i think about how much my dad is physically going to miss out on my heart feels like its missing something. man i just wish that i had the chance to relive everything. so many important things that i have to experience without that one important person. i could never replace the void that i have no matter how hard i try. i see his face everyday and remember the last moments we had. it hurts so bad. i take it day by day. sometimes it feels like the next day will be better but it seems like its not. it just feels like im numb to the pain. i talk to him all day, wondering what he's doing, hoping that im doing the right things, making him happy, hoping that i'll get some kind of sign of reassurance. i know he's there with me all the time but it gets hard to keep your faith strong. God planned out life like this so i can't complain... i just wonder why some people have different plans. one day with time i will understand what all this means for me. but back to something that makes me feel good...
i definitely know that God places people in your life for one reason or another. it definitely helps to have a boyfriend there that shows you love, kindness and is open with his feelings all the time. sometimes just knowing that he's happy makes me happy. a relationship is like an investment. you gotta put a lot into it so that you can get a lot out of it over a period of time. right now i feel like i have a secure investment :-) its difficult to find someone who u connect and relate to. im blessed to have someone care so much about me and willing to do anything for me.
... a lot of times i think about how much my family has changed over this past year. i could have never imagined the changes that took place. man i lost my dad, about to have a nephew or two, found my long lost love and definitely about to tackle a semester of college all alone. but thats a whole different lj...something is gotta give for me pretty soon..... a person can only take so much. but i guess im just extraordinary or something like that hmmmmm...

"event","just thinkin about everything we talked about today, and this stuck out the most. it makes me feel good to now that i still can make you nervous by doing something so simple as taking a shower... i love that you are in love with me and that you really appreciate me physically as well as intellectually. it makes me feel so complete and whole. something undescribable. its like i feel everything you're feeling. like i could tell that something was causing u 2 move a little slower...im glad that i still intrigue you. one thing that i think about a lot is whether or not our relationship will get old too quickly. not actually old, more like will we get too comfortable too quick. i still want to get excited when u come to see me or when u say u r going to call me. i still want to wait by the phone and smile when i see you sleeping. i love that u notice the little things about me, like when u told me about my eyes today...i really admire that you get completely into me. knowing everything that i like and don't like...every word im about to say before i say it and everything i think even though i dont tell u. its just weird how you know when something is wrong, when im having a bad day, when im thinking about something, just everything. i guess thats because we're meant to be or something like that lol. and something else that really stuck out in my mind today lets c...our painting project. lol thats what im going to call it. i just really appreciate the fact that we appreciate the same things. the arts are really important to me and im glad that u appreciate them too. but i really think i have a good idea for our project..something along the lines of layers of love, destiny or something like that. i gotta sketch some stuff out and see what direction i get bought into. i want this to be really really special, i already know its gonna have a lot of meaning so im not really worried about that. im excited about it! hmmm lets see so what else can i wrap about thats good.... considering i only have a month left here im really looking forward to spending a lot of time w/my babe... finding out more and more about him each day and revealing more about me too. i really want us to know every single thing about each other and really grow over this short time period. i can't wait to really get deep into our relationship, get some time under our belt, then i think i will be okay. its just that the distance scares me but i know if we keep our communication lines open and continue to find out more and more about each other each day then we will be beautiful. i love when u sing to me.....because your voice is remarkable! lol wamp wamp....kiss me....geez. but i think as long as we just stay strong for each other we'll have the best relationship. its so great to know that i always have u there to talk to about anything and im glad that you will always be there for me. oh yeah another thing im really glad that my mom and the rest of my family sees how much we care about each other. my family is a really important part of me and im glad we both have families that support our relationship. it just makes everything ten times better to know that i cant let u go because my family would prob disown me. lol. but honestly i found the one i've been lookin for...and im not letting go. i just hope that i can always make you nervous...."

"event","okay so im gonna try to write this without getting all emotional and stuff. keyword...try. lol today was a day that i probably won't be able to top in a long time. i never really had someone take the time to spend a whole entire day with me, buy everything, really enjoy spending time and making sure i had a good time all at the same time. to me, its just so sweet and loving and it makes me feel so special. like i never had someone care about me as much as my boyfriend does. like besides my family and stuff. he is my family. i just am really overwhelmed with my day today. it was almost like it didn't happen but i know it did. i needed today....it really meant a lot to me especially b/c i rarely have a day where i dont feel down about not having my dad around. it was just a really intimate experience even though it was hundreds of other people around and i could tell that he had a great time which made me feel really really good. sometimes i wonder why none of my other boyfriends had the decency to return the nice favors that i would do for them, the way that my boyfriend does now. its crazy to understand! he treats me like royalty, like im something that means a lot to him. his heart is soooooooooo big and it shows whenever i talk to him and spend time with him. :::::: and today was also moving day lmao..... i moved my plant to my one special sink in his bathroom lol and some of my other stuff. i guess u can say he's $uper $avin' me. lol thats my boo! im so glad with our relationship progress but sometimes i feel like i don't express my feelings enough and that i love you isn't enough. whatever words mean more than i love you, those are the words i would constantly tell him. it just hurts whenever i think about the time that we have to spend apart. thats y im just trying to make the best out of the time that we have left with each other....geez that made it sound like time to live or something lol..... i really feel so complete with him and i couldn't imagine how much he would fulfill my life. like honestly if i could spend every waking minute of my life with him i would be more than happy...anytime i make a wish on anything i just wish for our relationship to grow stronger and that we last. i always ask myself if i could live everyday with him and everytime the answer is always yes... finally i have someone who gives just as much; if not more, dedication and love as they receive. the feeling just overwhelms me. finally im experiencing true happiness."

"event","so i don't even know where i left off but im just gonna start wherever i feel like it.....soooo last night was really nice. finally i didn't hold back....well a little bit at first but then i jus decided to let go because i know i would feel a lot better if i just talk about how i feel. its really refreshing (lol thats the only word i could think of) to be able to have someone who is willing to listen to you and always willing to be there for you. im glad that i can get really personal and vulnerable without feeling uncomfortable. like i really am so glad that i have someone who is willing to open up to me, now if i could only do the same. a lot of times i choose to keep things to myself because sometimes i feel that i overreact or i can deal with situations myself when deep down inside i know i really cant. so right now im sitting here just thinking about how much deeper our love is going to be once we really get through the time away from each other at school. i guess it just really hit me yesterday that i won't be seeing my best friend, my boyfriend, my soulmate as much as i had wished but i know we will make it. i have so much faith in our relationship and i know it can only get better from us being far away. as long as we continue to communicate and keep communication lines open then i think we will be great. our love is really really strong and it already surpassed so many things that i could have failed at. i just want 2 make sure that we give our love a chance to grow and be everything that its meant to be. i dont want distance to hinder us and keep us down. like a lot of times i wonder why i even got so stuck on that little private college all far away from home and everything but i really know that God put us together in the same place once again so that we could find each other. i wish that the school was ten times better so that i wouldnt have to worry about whether or not my goals and plans for my future are going to fail. like i know how capable i am as a student, both academically and socially. its just really hard to bypass all my hard work for just a chance at a better school. damn it sucks....if i could go back i would definitely rethink my college selections but on the other hand i love him so much and us seeing each other again is definitely destiny. i hope that destiny keeps us together. im just really scared about being so far away from someone who plays such an important part in my life. i gotta be strong for the both of us....we gotta make this last... for our future"

i don't even know what to start with. well first of all today was an okay day i guess. i was kind of busy at work which is always good. one of the major things that happened today was definitely the realization that my goals/plans need some realignment. as if i didnt already no that. its just difficult to face the reality that you basically are setting your self up for default. like i know clark isn't the right school for me which i why i wanted to transfer in the first place. i was so through with not feeling like i was actually working through school......... bbak wrapping up"

"event","last night, i was on my way to starting a good dream...i know i was and i hear my phone ringing. so i was contemplating on whether or to answer it but i decided to even though the id came up line 1...i wasn't thinkin, i was half asleep and didn't really comprehend. ""hello???"" ""hello...u know who this is?"" ""u called from a blocked number....dumbass..."" ""u sleep?"" ""hello...hello...hello"" ""this trevin......"" after that i just hung the phone up.... question...y does it seem like every time something good happens some bad just has to come up to ruin the moment? not that my moment was ruined or anything like that but i could feel that it would proabably be a definite attempt to. its almost funny to think about how people still hold on to what they could have had. now that i have someone who treats me the right way and is mature about his, not afraid to show emotion and to love dumb ass niggas wanna wake u up early in the damn morning to stop you from dreaming. but now... i realized that im done w/ having my past trying to dictate what i do in the future. if u wasn't there back then, then don't even try to come back now. its no use....im so much better than that and i know now that someone is willing to appreciate me so much more than the lameO's. it feels so good to be able to talk to someone who really can relate to you on more than one level...not just sexually. which honestly i never really related sexually to any of my ex's the way i relate to my boyfriend now. its almost like when you have a strong connection you can tell. it shows in your sex life and everything. even when we kiss we feel connected its hard to describe the feeling. it just feels so good. nothing like i've ever experienced before... its like magic. and i love it. finally i get to experience that magic that i looked for in all the wrong places... now im just glad that the first time i saw him at emagine wasn't the last time. maybe i'll be able to have a good dream tonight....without the distractions. i just have so much hope for our relationship and i can honestly say that i want it to last forever."

"event","aight....right now im feelin soooooooooo good. its not a lot that can bring me down maybe tryin 2 schedule my classes for next semester but other than that i breathed my big sigh of relief a few hours ago. it sounded something like this...WHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEWWWWWWW.....maybe a lil longer. my dreams are slowly coming back to life instead of being crushed. i dont even know what to describe this feeling as. i already felt complete despite everything else so i cant say i feel complete. maybe relieved, carefree or something like that. honestly i prayed that whatever happened...happened and let it be for the best. so either way that the situation worked out some good would come out of it. God puts different people in your life at different times for different reasons. i really think that God didn't want me to give up and leave my problems to solve themselves. i just am thankful for the good in my life right now and it feels like i came out on top! yay! but honestly, i can only hope that whenever, if ever, times get difficult that we are able to go back to times where the hurt and frustration made ""us"" seem impossible. everytime i think about everything we've been through i get really really emotional because you held my heart a long time ago and through it all you still hold it. that's why if you feel like you have something good...you should hold on to it. the worst that can happen is that you find out what you really deserve. 
but for that little ass girl who tried to f' with my dreams..... fcuk you...you don't even deserve these words right here...stupid ass lying ass bitch ass lunatic ass girl..not even a girl , a child. grow the fcuk up and learn from your mistakes...if its real it won't hurt, it won't prompt jealousy and lies, it won't fcuk you over... i feel so mistreated i use to pray for her to get her head straight...health straight....life straight. its sad that she doesn't realize how fast all of that can be taken away from you........... keep them lies straight and you might be able to catch a dumb ass dude to believe all that bullsh!t that u talk. damn if i only had a chance to meet face to face sooo many things we have to discuss. bitch. 
but on a lighter note....
me and my best friend.... met again.... fell in love...and about to do this thing for US. nobody else just me n my j. im looking forward to this sleep. finally some peace. i love him with all of my heart. everything in my body tells me that i love him, there's just nothing that can take that away from me...."

"event","so its late as hell and i havent even heard ur voice all day, man i miss my babes. damn im so attracted to a man who works all day......sheesh but anyways.... i just got done reading this book called True Notebooks by Mark Salzman in TWO days. that joint was potent!!! man i hated that it was a true story because i really had my emotions entangled in every last page of that book. this book really touched me, i dont think i could ever forget it. i suggest that if you ever need a reason to love your freedom and your life...to read that book. it also made me really question the justice system and its injustice to human beings. even though convicts change lives for the worst they are humans too. im not trying to say that i dont agree that there should be some sort of punishment for offenders but there should also be the chance for change in a respectful, dignified manner. Anyways, another point in the book that i really really enjoyed was when the youth offenders discussed how they felt that it was wrong that men shouldn't cry. DAMN i loved that part! personally, i find nothing more sensitive, relatable, and normal than a PERSON male or female showing raw emotion. i think that a lot of times dudes get a bad wrap for showing their immediate emotion. my heart breaks when i see a male my age cry. just as if it were a female my age. then i started thinking that society makes males seem like they have to be untouchable. almost like they aren't real. life is real. tears are real. males are real. i know i cry at least once a week. sometimes i think about the good in my life and tears well up in my eyes. there's so much that i have to be thankful for. i just really love when a male feels comfortable enough to take off the mask that society places on him and show real emotion. im tryin to think about what song says ""...you can still love your man and be manly dog..."" i think that is so true. Love isn't sexist, racist, or anything like that. everyone who's anyone can fall in love with whatever they choose. because tomorrow is never promised.....cry......and tell the people that you love that you love them.

...latley i feel like i found everything i love about me except in a different body. its very intriguing and exciting to find so much in common with someone who you once thought u would never see again. lmao im watchin american pie right now and its on the part where finch was in the bathroom after his laxative but n e ways... big ups to emagine studios for allowing me to find someone who truly cares about me for me. i just really feel content and happy knowing that i have a special part in someones life who i thought i would never see again. everytime i see him i feel the same way i did when i realized we were n the same class second semester. i definitely believe in destiny after all of this... i would be denying the grounds of our friendship/relationship if i did...
...so with this being said, i wait, with a smile on my face...happy because i definitely know what i have and waiting to see what the future holds. i like seeing how this stuff works out...just because i know its going to be everything i hoped for. i like knowing that we got thru one really rough time together and we weren't even official yet. its like if u want something so bad, you would do almost anything to get it. i definitely knew that i wouldnt leave because i value friendship over anything. i know that if im this much in love with our friendship then im going to love our relationship undoubtedly. i really couldn't ask for a better friend. its like you know what im going to say before i even say it and u kno exactly what i think and feel, anytime. i really think God put you here on earth because he knew i would get lonely without you...two people who thought they would never see each other again...end up falling in love...it can't get any more perfect than that...mo...
...through it all, i still i love you and i promised you that i wouldn't leave you while you were working on you... sometimes it takes hurt and pain in order to open up for love. when i think about all the sacrifices you made for us and our future i feel unexplainable...i know that its all gonna be worth it in the end...its gonna be beautiful..."

"event","Okay well the moment that most of us have been waiting for is about to happen.... because of technical difficulties, Kevin and I will have to terminate this relationship. Aight well actually, things haven't really been the same since the very first time i went home. Unfortunately, I rarely get to speak to him anymore and its not that I don't want to its just that I am really busy with school and other committments here at CAU. Seeing as though he is in MD right now, he is doing the same things he's been doing and probably will be. Not that it is a bad thing but sometimes change is good. I truly still have feelings for Kevin but I just can't be with him right now. He is a really sweet, genuine, and caring person and I hate treating him this way. With all of the stres/stressors that I have in my life right now the last thing i want to do is put all my stress on him. Honestly, its not his fault that the relationship is turning out this way, up until last week its just been at a standstill. Then last weekend I had to hang the phone up on him b/c he was being rude and half-assing questions...so i was frustrated and hung the phone up. And that brings us to today.... the moment of truth

"event","Hey everyone....sorry that it took this long to update, but i have a lot of stuff to write about... so here goes the first attempt to get everything down.

Aight, first of all i was really happy about coming back to atl. I missed everyone a lot that week and a half i was at home. It was really hard to leave my family too, we had went through a lot with each other and getting on the plane by myself just made me feel really alone. The A received me w/open arms, no questions asked. I also want to thank everyone who sent cards, called, prayed, or just stood by me in the passing of my dad. Its really hard to describe how it feels to lose a parent, the best word that I can think of is empty. Its like a void in my life. 

I also got a chance to visit my school... good ol' shs. No matter what anyone says about my ""white"" school, i love it. I missed everything about it too. For some reason I felt really old while i was there and really tall. lol. I had fun though... I miss having AP Psych with Kris and Ash!

All of my experiences back home were really difficult to get through b/c i remember times when my dad was there w/me. Like at my Grandma's house or even at my dad and stepmom's house. I would never wish this feeling on my worse enemy. One thing that I have learned from this experience is not to complain. Honestly, it could be worse and there are worse things to use complaints on. People go through many different things everyday and still bear a smile and continue to laugh. We are blessed to be able to breathe, eat, walk, just simple things that we take for granted everyday. Okay last but not least make sure you tell the people who mean something to you (anything to you) that you appreciate them/ love them. Say thank you. Its important to let them know how much you mean to them. Luckily, I had the chance to see my dad and to talk to him. 

Okay i'll finish the rest later...... thanks again everybody luv u guys a lot!"

"event","There's so much to write about right now....i don't know where to start. Well for one, my weekend at home was pretty cool. I was really happy to see my fam and everybody. It was cool. I got a chance to eat some real food! I went to Mchunu (dissapointment) they didn't have a good selection for females, but i still got some shirts. I really realized how much i am changing just by being around my family. I guess I can say im more independent now only b/c i do live on my own while here at cau. It was weird when my mom told me to be home at a decent hour and it was already 10:30. In all reality she just wants to feel like she still can tell me when to come home....its aight though.

Aight well the kevin situation is mediocre. Its mainly me and my thoughts... u know i think a lot. I just feel like we are at two different levels right now and instead of trying to figure things out....ending it would be easier. But then again ending it would hurt feelings. Its kind of like donell jones, where i wanna be. Actually it is like that song. I just need to figure out me for me. Needless to say I guess he had a good birthday. Thats the most expensive birthday gift ever...a round trip plane ticket. I do love him but i dont know if i need him right now. But hey everything happens for a reason. Another trip to new res...

The fam is doing good. Kristen and Ashley are getting old, but then I guess that means that I am too. My brother is the same, if anything funnier. Parents are good....my dad's holding on. Man, i don't think i ever shared this but my goal for myself is that my dad gets to see me graduate from college. i know that i shouldnt make that a goal considering i have no control over it, but it is. Its hard to face the reality of whats going on in your life. All of my parents mean the world to me and i dont know what i would do without any of them. Im a true ""daddy's girl"" and its hard for me to cope with certain things that are happening now. Like lately i've been thinking about getting married asap...so that i wouldn't have to face my biggest fear. It just consumes my mind everytime I think about it. Man i just have to keep my faith in God... he knows what I can bear.

Well school is school. What can I say? Ummmm my english paper is coated in red. Sooooo considering that I am an English major I took that as a stab to the heart. I just have to remember that its Mrs. Morgan and she only wants whats best for us. Its her job so I respect that but damn my paper is my heart. 

I guess you can say I am the one who tries to save the world at times. Sometimes I just want someone to save me. Some days I feel like telling the world what Im thinking and other times I just want to help. God made the world in 6 days and thats GOD...why do i feel like i need to save it in one day? 

Thats it for right now....God, please don't let my whole world crash down at once."

"event","I guess today is the big day! Its funny because if this was about two weeks ago, I would be so excited to go home. Don't get me wrong, I am excited, but, im also starting to get comfortable down here in atl. I met a lot of really cool people and its almost like my family away from my family. Unfortunately, Im also missing a whole lot of stuff thats supposed to be going on this weekend but its aight...i'll get to see Kris and Ash and the rest of my family.

Man Whit and I had some fun yesterday...Bumstead to Ware to Publix to New Res... She REALLY REALLY had to pee ;) thanks girl. Man Whit knows how bad I need my daily dose so she hooked me up. Great minds think alike. I think I found my husband lol!!!!!!!!!(thats weird to think of)oven mitts, black lights and target shooting.... thats some freaky sh*t (sorry for cursing whit!)

I am going home for Kevin's b-day but he has been f'ing up lately so im really not pressed to see him. I also get my hair done on Saturday so i'm excited about that (u know how i am about the hair). I can honestly say that right now i really just want to go home to sleep and eat and see everybody. Kevin is on my bad list... but thats just because i let him get away w/too much. Like if ur ex has been calling u...why would u wait until the week after to say something about it? not that i want to really know..but i do want to know why she is consistently calling, if u supposedly don't pick up the phone? obviously she is calling for one reason or the other. this weekend we definitely need to talk about all this. LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIPS AGAIN!!!! THEY SUCK!!!!! ITS ALMOST LIKE I DIDN'T LEARN MY LESSON THE FIRST TIME!!!!!! Another thing is that this relationship is taking up lots of my time i could use to study... i need A's to stay on scholarship so....whatever happens, happens.

Aight I think thats about it...i can't wait to see Kristen and Ashley and my brothers and mommy and granny and daddy and my aunts and my cousins and everybody!!!!!!! See how i didn't put Kevin...he had me all pugnacious last night!  
Man, im also missing the dc metro club cookout at heritage...that really sucks too but its aight...i'll be back in 3 days! i hope everybody will miss me b/c i will miss everybody!

To my real roomie and my other real roomie....whit n ashlee...im going to miss you guys!!!!! have fun for me and ashlee dont sleep on my bed everyday! call me a lot and let me know what is going on. im glad we are roomies...4life!!! mi casa es su casa para vida!"

i had the weirdest dream last night....it was about u. not you. but u. i feel bad telling you this....but it wasnt about you. i know you are wondering why it wasn't about you. well sometimes i wonder that too. sometimes i wonder what you think of me and sometimes i wonder what u think of me. u make me feel different than you do. you know what i want and what i need and u dont. but im willing. willing 2 let u know. i kiss you... i kiss u? i know this dream was crazy but wait...it was all about u...not you...but u. why do i put you through this? you need me and i need u. u needs me and i need you. this is crazy...i think i need to go back to sleep.....i love you...i need you...i mean i need u... i mean you... i need u

"event","Hey guyz....and whoever else wants to really know what goes on in my life, Whitney dragged me into this. WE, yes WE, can't even finish our journals for Ms. Morgan's class but yet she wants to start live journaling. I guess its worth a try. Whats the worst that can happen? I can just lose my scholarship and fail out of English and by the way I just happen to be an English major. 
So now I really like doing this journaling thing. Today's word of the day is unfathomable...yesterday it was lackadaisical. I'm trying to expand my vocabulary so its a cute way to do so. Now back to the whole Ms. Morgan thing, WE also can't even start our narratives that just happen to be due this week. Sometimes it seems like there just isn't enough time in the day to do what you really want to or need to do. 
College really tests your time management skills b/c clearly on Sunday my friends and I decided to wait 4 hours for carry out instead of doing 4 hours of homework. You live and you learn I guess. I really need to get with it though just to make sure I keep on top of things. 
UNFATHOMABLE: what I did yesterday.... and if you really know me then you know what I am referring to. Whitney said today that the internet is the vain of her existence, well college just might be mine. I know sooner than later some changes will/have to be made, personally, academically, all of the above. Well thats about it for right now.... don't miss me too much! I love Whitney.she's the best...yes everybody we did know each other before this!!!
GO SKINS!!!! YES THEY BEAT THE COWBOYS LAST NIGHT!!!! 14-13 thanks to santana moss"

<TR>
<TD>You are loaded with a quirky kind of class that people find irresistable. Men turn and look at you admiringly as you walk down the street, and even your rivals have a grudging respect for you. You usually know the right thing to say, do and, of course, wear. You can take charge of a situation when things get out of hand, and you do it with great poise and chic. Your wit and sense of fun endear you to your partner and every other man in the room. Your screen partners include William Powell and Cary Grant. You're quite a catch...if you want to be caught.

"event","well well. I planned on updating yesterday. but I died. 
Now I'm back. I guess i will talk about my adventurous weekend.
On thursday afternoon me and bunch a girls (too many girls) went to Fort Loramie, Ohio for COUNTRY CONCERT 05. We arrived at our campsite, a glorious pop up camper! We settled in and cracked open a few beers and then headed on down to the concert site. The first two acts were Sara Evans and Brad Paisley, I probably could have stayed back and drank my self silly. I had a good time any way I saw so many people from Delphos it didn't matter who was on stage. After the show we went back and partyed! 
Friday we Started drinking again and walked around to find our friends who were staying across the road, visted for a while and everyone left to see Cross Canadian Ragweed. I enjoyed them, they had a country rock sound that I like. Later we went back to eat, YADDA YADD YADDA, skipped Chelly Wrights set, Nikki and I cleaned up and dance around to some Alambama and Lynard Skynard.THEN AT 6:00 the moment I had been waiting for... GARY ALLAN! I love him, he put on a great show!! I could go on and on about him, after Gary I was sitting around relaxing and this Cowboy came up and sat down next to me, he had one leg and was married. The weird thing was I met his wife and his mother in law?? we talked about what its like living on a farm and FFA. at 10:00 Tim Mcgraw came on and Alot og people said he wasn't that good. I thought he did a great job (he was lucky I was really drunk). After the show I really don't remember what went on.
Saturday came and I had to wake up at 7am to run and get tickets and seats for the concert later that day. After running like hell  I puked!!!! Umm Saturday I played horseshoes with our neighbors to win some money ,  while the other girls put on on their makeup and did there hair,  I grilled some delicious chicken. Nikki and I left to see Billy Curlington, he is one hott fellow. Okay by this day we all were pretty bitchy towards each other. But that did n't stop me from seeing the Oak Ridge Boys, and they may be old but they sure did kick ass. Then it was the Joe Diffie came on stage he was  great I had a Blast! Then all of us girls went back to our camper and I cooked MORE MEAT! after the eating it time to see Terri Clark. I became a new fan of Terry Clarks! The party really got started when Brooks and Dunn came on. Oh man good times! So after that we went back I grill some Hot dogs  and then I passed out. So while I was out my friend Jenni was walking to the port a potties and these guys came bye and said something to her and she sassed backed. So when she went in to the port a potties they tipped it over, the door was facing the grounds so she could n't get out.. She was screaming and finally some people helped her, I woke to her puking it took hours for her to get clean. I felt so bad for her . The Sheriffs wouldn't let her take a shower or rinse of the in the pond, when we woke up no body wanted to do anything we, finally cleaned up went down to watch Phil Vasser and then Montgomery Gentry. I really wanted to see them, because they always put on a good show, but I was so tired and exhausted from the heat, I was fighting for energy. So with what happened to A Jennie we decided to called it day and go home. Over all I had great time and can't wait until next year!
so sorry if this update was boring for eveyone.. Especially if you don't know who I'm talking about.

"event","Friday. Well I came home from cleveland around 2:30. I unpacked all of my things from the dormitory.and got ready for my Joni to come!. MY two bestfriends Nikki and Sara stopped out also. we drank a few drinks, sprayed Joni's ESCADA perfume all over our selves, then went up to the Rustic and Johnny A's. It was a good time we saw alot of people and got pretty drunk. then me, Joni Perrit, Adam Wisher, Brad Mohler(MO), Brian Clark and Sara Fisher made it back to my place. That is when it got CRAZY.  Well, maybe not. We had a good time we went swimming drank a lot of booze. danced made obnoxious phone calls. MO and I did our famous sacranized swimming. well I guess I could give more detail but, it's really not that clear.

Saturday. saturday was one big blur. I made amazing Cinnamon peanutbutter pancakes. Joni and I lounged around for way to long. But we finally went in to town and got groceries.  we grilled and made the best cheeseburger hotdogs. Because, well, I don't mean to brag but I am an excellent cook. Called up Dr. Mike and Randy. After they got lost a couple times they finally made it out. IT was a slow night but was nice, went into town again. But nothing really went on so we picked up the Adam Wisher and came out here and party like no other, Dr. Mike locked his keys in the his car. I laughed. Then grilled up some more delicious cheeseburger hotdogs. Excpet for Randy he is lactose intolerant. Listen to some records, Adam swam naked, I smoked way to many cigarettes, Randy was crawling around, Dr. Mike was falling a sleep and Joni read a magazine.
Oh ya, Randy wore my heels."

"event","I was in florida for week and I guess I will tell all about it in my LJ. Actually it was kinda boring, which I like.
I had no motivation to wake up early to hit the waves.
MONDAY: laid out on the dock. fished of the dock and caught probably the six of the smallest fish in the entire ocean. went to the beach. hung out at the dive shop and ate at the farmerboy diner(which is actually a greek restaurant). drank margaritas until I passed out.
TUESDAY: I woke up around 6:00 got ready for a dive. Leah and I went scuba diving all day with captain Mac and captain Jim (who I absolutely love). 
after the dive I took a very long nap and started drinking my coronitas.Oh glorious.went to the beach.
WEDNESDAY: I can't really remember wednesday. I believe it was SANGRIA DAY!
THURSDAY: lounged around recovering from wednesday.saw Sahara. loved it. 
FRIDAY: hung out way to long at the beach saw to many speed-os. went fishing.
SATURDAY: I came home. took a nap. went to the bars in delphos"

Also it was really cold. Driving for two hours with a plastic bag only covering half of the the window makes it really cold.   
bird feeder?
Okay, so as soon as I got home I went straight for the kegeraitor!
But honestly the night became really great when I went up to the bar and had a few beers. To my surprise a few of my High-school teachers were there and they bought me beers. Even the mayor bought me a beer. And I'm only 20!!

My girlfriend Joni became a chef and teaches salsa dancing. By the time I finish typing this load of crap, giant pigeons will starting eating pickles and smoking cigars.

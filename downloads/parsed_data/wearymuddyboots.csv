"event","Well it turns out that updating my journal is a task thats harder to do than I thought. Probably got something to do with the fact that I'm never home, and when I am, I'm not at the computer. The few minutes I am home, I'm battleing a new substance abuse problem. I discovered it about a week ago, and I haven't been able to turn away form it since. I was tring to watch tv while eating dinner one night and I couldn't get any reception on the rabbit-ears, so I plugged into the cable coming in the wall, and what do you know? We got cable! It must be hooked into someone elses. I've never had cable before, I find quite addictive! I'm used to having only 2 channels, so you watch what ever is on. Now there are 60-odd channels to lookthrough. Some people complain that there is nothing to watch. I say bullshit, they just little interests, and a short attension span. There's always something to watch. There are cartoons that make me roll on the floor, music videos, and interesting documentries. Maybe I'm the strange one, because I could probably watch a documentry on the life cycle of starfish, and be quite interested. Yes, I'm strange.

I think I may be moving in with a friend of mine, Trevor Wall. There's another guy, Jason Garnier who I would like to move in with, because he's looking to move out of where he is, but he want's something more permement. Trevor has a one bedroom apartment, but there's a share room I could have for my own, which would be more than I have now. 

My SWAP application has been submited, and I got my acceptance kit. Now it's only a matter of time. 8 weeks to be more precise. I'm very excited, and very nervous too. I'm leaving the country for the first time, by myself, hoping to find a job and a place to live when I get there. Oh the excitement! Kinda like going the forces, or fist week of university, but more so. I have alot less safety nets this time. I did meet a friend of Decker's this weekend though, who lives in Ireland, with his fiance. He'll be back there early December, an he told be that he would have no problem picking me up at the airport, letting me crash in his place, or whatever else too help me out. This made me very happy. He's a good, no-nonsense guy, and I'll probably need all the help I can get.

I' starting to worry about money too. I need to make sure I have enough to go over there, with enought setup funds, and not leave I goant debt at home thatI will be tring to pay off the whole time I'm over there. Nevermind the student loan payment will kick in just when I'm arriving over there. May I won't tell them I'leaving the country, and they won't be able to find be, and take my money. Yeah that could work :) I can't stand going out to the mall or anywhere because I always see lots of stuff I would like to buy, but I have to keep reminding myself that I'm saving to go to Ireland. It's just easier to do without the tempation. 

Speaking aout money, the car is out of comission again. Yes, my Betsey, of many a mile of happy road trip these summer, is no longer in service. The brakes have been acting funny for a little while now, but on my first day of work there was a strange whirring noise from the engine. Turns out it's the power steering. I would need to replace a compression line, which would be a $100 bill or more after parts and labour. And after that's fixed, who knows how long until something else needs to be replaced, and that would really chew a hole in my Ireland fund.

This saturday is the Potato festival at the botanical garden. It and the preparations should be a fun change of schedual. I'm enjoying the work at the garden. Working with Carl is like working with an old friend. In fact, it is. The only complaint I have right now is the waiting gae we're playing. It's time to cut alot down right now, but Dr. Nicholls what us to wait until last minute. He hates to see it go, but it's time to let it go. If we wait until the weather turns, we'll have ALOT to do, in short time, and in bad weather. Oh, well.


Anyway, bored of typing again, update again soon,
Later,
Peace all."

"event","I'm slowly going crazy with idleness! I don't know how much longer I can take this. And the uncertainty is getting to me too. A few months ago I thought I'd be in Ireland now. A few weeks ago I thoughtI 'd have a job and be on my way to Ireland in November, and now, I'm living with my brother in a one bedroom apartment, no job and no money. Is that sad or what? I've been out with resumes again and again, and now I just sit and watch the endless procession of empty hours go by. I never heard back from most of the places I sent resumes too. Colin says it's because I'm over qualified for the shitty little jobs I applied for. I think that blows. I'm not experienced enough to work in what I'm qualified for, and overexperienced to get a job at Tim Horton's! Gardening is utterly dead. Theres little to do know before I have to cut it all down in October. 

On the bright side I could be looking at a year long postion at the Garden. But of course I have to wait for a week or more for the red tape before I'll know. ARGH!! This job, as good as it sound comes with it's own set of complications. Namely, throwing my plans for Ireland out the window, or at least until next year this time, when I'll no longer have student status, and no longer be eligable for student SWAP. ARGH again!! I know I have nothing to complain about, I'll get one good thing or the other, but it's the waiting in the meantime. In my brothers cramped apartment, with mo money, and nothing to do, but read books, until my eyes get boggled, and rant on the Internet for anyone to listen.

Anyway, I'll gather my composer now and Stop gripping. Next time I will be more positive, I hope.

Later :)"

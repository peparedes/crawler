<h2>Libra - Your Love Profile</h2>
<b>Your positive traits:</b>

You are easily loyal and faithful, but only for the right person.
<br><br>
<b>Your negative traits:</b>

You're a bit gullible, and partners take advantage of you. You still may not know it.<br>
You find it difficult to decide where to go to dinner, what movie to watch, who to date...<br>
You have to be in a relationship, or else you just don't feel like yourself.

<b>Your dating style:</b>

Soft and sensual - you don't like anything to be rough.<br>
Extravagant  ... your fantasy involves staying at a five star hotel with your love.
<br><br>
<b>Tips for the future:</b>

Huge and born of flame,<br>they burn with light and power and rebirth.<br>Ashes fall from your wingtips. You are an<br>amazingly strong person. You survive, even<br>flourish in adversity and hardship. A firm<br>believer in the phrase, 'Whatever doesn't kill<br>you only makes you stronger,' you rarely fear<br>failure. You know that any mistake you make<br>will teach you more about yourself and allow<br>you to 'rise from the ashes' as a still greater<br>being. Because of this, you rarely make the<br>same mistake twice, and are not among the most<br>forgiving people. You're extremely powerful and<br>wise, and are capable of fierce pride, passion,<br>and anger. Perhaps you're this way because you<br>were forced to survive a rough childhood. Or<br>maybe you just have a strong grasp on reality<br>and know that life is tough and the world is<br>cruel, and it takes strength and independence<br>to survive it. And independence is your<br>strongest point - you may care for others, and<br>even depend on them...but when it comes right<br>down to it, the only one you need is yourself.<br>Thus you trust your own intuition, and rely on<br>a mind almost as brilliant as the fire of your<br>wings to guide you.You are eternal and because<br>you have a strong sense of who and what you<br>are, no one can control your heart or mind, or<br>even really influence your thinking. A symbol<br>of rebirth and renewal, you tend to be a very<br>spiritual person with a serious mind - never<br>acting immature and harboring a superior<br>disgust of those who do. Likewise, humanity's<br>stupidity and tendency to want others to solve<br>their problems for them frustrates you<br>endlessly. Though you can be stubborn,<br>outspoken, and haughty, I admire you greatly.

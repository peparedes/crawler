"event","well it's been a long time since i wrote, but i have been having fun! lol  Welcome week was fun, good times catchin up with peeps & getting some fun partying in.  Alex & I love our room & will love it even more when we get our futon!!!  We have an awesome view though! :)  All you people need to come visit me! :)

Classes were interesting.... I ended up dropping my dance & anthro class to take up Bio (which is gonna be crazy hard), but I actually feel good about it.  I have been considering pre-med again lately (not ready to give up on that idea) so i feel more productive now taking biology.  My other classes are spanish (with some hot boys!), law & philosophy (which i am excited about cuz i like philosophy), & sociology (which my prof is so cool!).  it should be a good semester but ill have to study a lot, which will get overwhelming.
p.s. it PISSES me off how much the bookstores ripe students off!!!!!!!

But anyways, its the first friday now & alex & I went to sit/lay in the law quad reading in the sun, which was soooo nice!  That will be tomorrow as well i am sure hehe.  I am actually really motivated to get stuff done! i think its the weather lol.  I am excited for the weekend.  we get to go to a soccer party tomorrow night to goggle at hot soccer players lol.  I am glad to be back!  See how i feel once classes really kick in! :b
p.s. i saw Garden State for the second time.  It's an awesome movie!!!!! GO SEE IT!  You'll love it!

Enjoy the day! :)

"event","Today I went to the Renissance Festival w/ Mom.  Despite the risky weather, it turned out to be a good time.  I had a couple beers (which i was really craving lately! - must be withdrawls lol) and I tried Gennius, which I actually liked (it was on tap)!  We listened to some good music, and I got some really cool earrings.  It was an enjoyable day!

Yesterday I visited Grandpa w/ Mom in Redford.  Aww I love Grandpa.

This next week I am gonna be keeping busy getting ready for school (lots to do!) & babysitting 2 days for a few hours.  But I am sooo excited to go back to school!  Ann Arbor, here I come in 5 days! :)

Good night all! Hope u had a nice weekend!

"event","So I just want to say that fake people suck.  All I have to say is don't say you'll call if you really have no intention of calling, and do not claim to be soooo close if really you couldn't give two shits for a person.  I am really upset with myself right now for actually believing certain people could really care.  To all my geniune friends out there, I love you and I hope we can always maintain our friendships throughout our busy lives.

Anyways.... Today was my last day of work today.  I am sooo sad cuz I will miss the kids sooo much, especially my favorites, and lots of people that I worked with were so nice!  I seriously came close to crying after work.  I really am going to miss working at Kiddie Academy but hopefully I can go back next summer, unless I stay in AA (which i am not currently planning but things could definately change).  I hope to get a daycare job in AA, but not sure if that really is available and accessable.  I need my dose of kids!  This really makes me want to be a teacher, but still i just don't know.  I am taking a bunch of random classes this semester, which will be cool but I feel like I am going no where! ugh its frustrating.  But I guess nothing is ever certain or secure and thats life.

ok enough for now.  Gonna find something for myself to do.

"event","Yeah really random title just cuz i felt like it....

So monday night we went to JR's for one lil last partay before Kristine, Steph, & JR left tuesday for school.  It was an entertaining evening, us girls with our 40's.  Some good quality time before everyone departs their separate ways again.  But I have a feeling this year people will make the effort to visit each other more since we have become so close.  It makes me wish I had my car in Ann Arbor but don't think that will happen...  I already miss people and its only been a few days. :(

Tuesday evening I visited Mary's baby guinea pigs with Julie Kowik.  It was really good to see them since I really haven't this summer. Julie & I have always been able to talk and she is such a sweetie & good friend.  Then Julie & I headed to Steph Robb's house to say good bye. I am so sad because I wanted to see her a lot this summer, and it just didn't happen.  We all get so busy, it's sad really.  She is so great, & also a very good friend who i can always talk to.

Wednesday night Bridg & I went to see Garden State.  WOW what a great movie.  It seemed like you were just watching real people & the movie was so true to real life.  I related & understood it in so many ways.  Great movie, go see it!

Tonight I met Angie @ Somerset with her new boy toy lol.  It was good to see her & she is another one I didn't get to see as much as I'd hoped this summer.  Also a good friend lol.  Hopefully I'll get to see her for a bit before I she leaves for school on Saturday.

Tomorrow is my last day of work at Kiddie Academy.  I am gonna miss it sooo much!  I had to say good bye to two of my favorites today cuz they do not come on friday.  Very sad cuz they really don't understand that I am leaving & I love going to work to see them.  I will probably visit next week before heading back to school, for me more than them lol.  I really was a great summer working there.

ok I just wrote a rediculous amount.  But I felt I needed to! lol Thanks to those who actually read this! lol  Night! Big day tomorrow of good byes! :(

"event","So thursday, Julie came home and Julie, Kristine, Jacquie, Stephanine B, & I headed to Tonic night club.  It was an enjoyable time there.  Vince & Jason ended up being there (guys we met at Tiki's in the beginning of summer & have hung out with lots since then) so we pretty much danced with them a lot.  Dan (kristine's ex) was there & it was good to see him.  he is a great guy, & we miss him!  We also ran into some random roch ppl as well, like Jenna Collins, and Tatum & Trisha.  But good times thurday night w/ the gang.

Friday I worked til about 6 & all day I was just absorbing my lil 2 year olds & realizing how much I am gonna miss them!  They are soo cute and funny to watch.  Before the had their lunch, Kyle entertained them all w/ a version of 5 little monkeys jumping on the bed. it made me laugh.  Friday night, Bridg, Jacquie, Kristine, Jules, & I headed to East lansing to Katie's (bridg's sis's) new apartment warming party.  it was a good time w/ some theatre ppl & other randoms.  We decided we were the butchest people there cuz we had our Miller Light while everyone else drank bitch drinks lol.  Still it was goodtimes as always.

Saturday I headed to the Dream Cruise w/ everyone again minus Julie who went back to kzoo.  We met up with some of the boys & got to ride on the guys croch rockets (except I didn't until later that night cuz I had a skirt on & the cruise).  Then we headed to Matt's house from some chill drinking time.  I got to ride on Peekachu's croch rocket which was an experience.  It's pretty sweet when its a straight shoot & u can go fast.  we wanna be biker chicks now lol.  Good fun.

Today, I got up for church & lunch w/ Dad & the bro.  Came home to atempt to read in the sun but ended up falling alseep in the sun for 2 hours.  Actually pretty productive cuz i needed the sleep & i got rid of my tan lines cuz i wore a tube top.  Came back inside to fall alseep again on my bed w/ my cindy baby, & woke up to eat lol.  Now i think i will read for a bit & watch a movie cuz i havent done that in sooo long, i've been so busy! 

I am really sad though cuz ppl start leaving this week & kelly already left for school.  makes me depressed cuz i love my friends & we have had such a great summer. ugh. but check out my new pics!

I have been working my ass off then  hanging out with girls after dinner.  it's been a pretty good summer.  i can't believe it is almost time to go back!  Kelly leaves this friday :(, Kristine leaves tuesday, and then bridget friday.  this is crazy.  i don't want to say goodbye to all of my friends again yet i am excited to go back.  getting away from dad is a plus as well! lol  last weekend i went to julie's cabin and had a nice weekend with the gang.  its soo relaxing and laid back up there, i love it.  lately i have allergies which sucks, and i had to miss the last night of tiki bobs cuz i just wasnt feeling too hot.  maybe i can scrounge up some ppl to go next week lol.  And my mom and i are going to the renissance festival i believe next weekend, which i LOVE!  i am feeling uneasy about summer ending and i feel like it flew by.  i hate that.  but fall is gonna be awesome i can just tell! :)  ok i am off for now.

"event","So last week, we had some fun.  Partied at Kristine's all week, and went to Tikki Bobs tuesday and had a BLAST!  Got a bunch of free beer and got WASTED!  But I chipped my tooth a lil on a beer bottle, which sucked. And work wasn't too fun the next day lol.  But we hung out with some cool 25/26 year old guys who we had met before.  Fun stuff lol.  We had some fun with 40's later in the week too.

Saturday I went to Kristen's bachelorette party in windsor.  it was a very nice and entertaining time.  Some interesting things happened, like meeting some cool guys from Ireland, meeting weirdos, watching trashy drunk women drop their pizza and demand another piece, and people stealing Kristen's veil which Tara went running down the street afterwards.  One asshole in the pizza place got in an argument w/ Gina, pushed her a lil, got kicked out, then came back in to tell Kristen that he hopes her babies die.  What a sicko, really who says that?  That's horrible.  Despite some of these things we had a great night.  After we got back to Brighton, i hung out by the pool w/ Tara & Kristen and got out tans on & chatted.  it was such a beautiful day too!  i am soooo excited for the wedding!!! :)

This week is gonna be busy doing a few things for the wedding and working 8.5 hour days.  But we have a soccer party on tuesday which i am excited about cuz i havent seen a lot of those ppl in a while.

Let me just say i love summer!!!!  ok have a great week!

"event","This weekend Bridget and I went to kzoo to visit my Jules!  It was a very fun and relaxing weekend!  I feel like we had some good talking and bonding time.  We also got some good quality drinking in, and i don't think i have played as much tippy cup in one weekend as I did this weekend.  All in good fun.  So I have decided Western people are cool as hell.  They are not too stuck up to have a good time with people you don't know at a party.  They also have really nice and new apartment complexes.  You can't find anything like it in Ann Arbor.  We spent sunday by the pool at Brad's place and it was amazing! I felt like i was on vacation!  Seriously thinking about changing schools lol.  But I still love AA and umich, dont get me wrong!!  it was a nice visit and i only hope I can visit next year often.  So who wants to drive me? lol

But anyways, heading to Kristine's tonight for some good old drinking fun with the girls and not sure who else.  ohhhh and jacquie quit cheerleading camp so now we have her home for the rest of the summer! so excited!!!  Alrighty i'm off! Have a wonderful night!

Then I went to Stoney Creek Park to rollerblade around with Dad.  Good times.  So I got home & Julie calls me saying she is still in Rochester & is hanging out at Scott's (Burry's neighbor that he is house sitting for).  So they invited me over there & of course all of them were drinking.  Ricky, Burry, JR, Jeff, & a couple random girls were there.  I was strong & didn't drink cuz i had work today.  It was fun to just stand around and chat.  I miss the old days when we used to hang out every weekend.  Fun times.  I loved wathcing Julie get drunk too! lol But anyways, worked all day today.  I think Dad & I are gonna rollerblade around Grosse Pines sub for a bit.  Then who knows what I'll do in Rochester! lol  Ann Arbor Art Fair tomorrow with mom!  Pray it doesn't rain for me!  ok have a good night!"

"event","So Saturday I got up late, cuz the weather wasn't too pretty, layed around, went to the grocery store, then showered, & went to Steph's house.  Lisa, Steph, Bridg, & I went to Lakeside mall to look for dresses for Kristen's wedding for me & i ended up keeping them there a lot longer then they wanted to be there lol.  But i found 2 cute dresses & bought them both to decide later.  I have decided on a black & white one, but it still has to pass the DAD test cuz its got some cleavage going on lol.  Then we went to see De-lovely, which wasn't too bad but was just really long & serious.  If you appreciate music you will probably appreciate the movie.

Today, I went to church w/ mom & brenden, & then out to eat at Rochester Mills.  It was nice to sit outside.  Then Mom & I drove to Gap in Farmington Hills to get a dress.  I currently have it in black & red and am trying to decide which i want to keep.  It is a light weight cotton summer dress so I am thinking red but i feel more comfortable in the black.  I wanna wear it to the art fair on wednesday (where i get to see my Caroline!) so i have to decide by then. ugh i am not good with decisions.  But anyways Julie called me on her way back from up north and ended up coming over to my house for a lil bit.  We just chatted for a couple hours.  Bridget up north asked her to stand in her & Travis's wedding next fall which is soo cute!  It's so crazy that we have friends that are getting married! wow and i don't even have a bf lol.  But then again life is a lil different up there.  it was sad to see Julie leaving tonight cuz she goes back to kzoo tomorrow, but i want to plan a trip next weekend to go visit her.  Let's hope this one works out!!!

I don't have to work til 10 tomorrow, which will be nice but then i work til 6:30.  So i am gonna hit the hay lol.  Sweet dreams!"

"event","yeah so I pretty much work then watch a movie at night with the girls. it's all i feel like doing really lol.  But wednesday I had that pot luck thing for work, & i ended up winning $25 in a staff drawing.  its weird cuz i like never win anything.  So that made that trip worth it, $25 plus on the clock while i was there.  I really didn't wanna go but I am glad i did.  There weren't any of the staff members there that are like me (part time) so it really shows that i care.  

And then a girl at work held a Body Shop party thursday where we did facials.  That wasn't too bad.  I was strong & didn't buy anything.  But those parties are free so i am thinking about throwing one.  If anyone is interested, let me know.  I wanna do the foot party lol where u do feet scrubs and lotion em up and shit lol.  Fun stuff.  Also last night, we went to kel's to watch a movie and Julie came home from kzoo so she came over for a bit.  I miss my jules. 

Today i didn't have to work until 3:30, so i woke up around 10:30 (got to sleep in but actually wanted to get up to enjoy the beautiful day!) then Julie and i went for a walk in her sub, then i went home to lay out, showered, & headed to work. Aww but the kids at work (my 2 year olds) missed me today cuz i wasn't in all day! that is soo sweet.  After work I went to Jen's baby shower (dance teacher).  she looks so great & i got to feel her baby Tanner kicking in her tummy!  I am so excited for her.  The shower was very creative to, like the center pieces were all toys for Jen, napins were baby cloths, table cloths blankets, & there was a game with baby diapers & inside were warmed candy bars (looked like poop) & we had to guess which candy bars they were. very cute.  I guess we are Cre8tive Fine Arts Academy of Dance.  We are creative people! lol

Ok so cuz there is nothing to do tonight, Bridget & I are planning something for tomorrow!!!  We are thinking Canada tomorrow night, so anyone wanna come along??  Or possibly Beach Boys concert with Mom.  We'll see.  I am feeling a productive day tomorrow! haha wish me luck!  Have a good night!

"event","So this week so far has been just working.  I get so tired from working, or on the down of cafeine from work lol that i don't feel like doing much when i get home besides watching a movie.  Last night I watched Honey w/ Mom, which was actually a good movie.  I actually suggest watching it for a life lesson.  If you can't figure out what you wanna do with your life (as many of us are!), maybe look to this movie for an inspiration.

Wednesday I have a pot luck thing at work at 6:30 where the parents and kids come with a dish and socialize and all.  I don't have to be there, but it kinda looks good to be there.  But i will be paid which isnt bad.  Then Thurday, at 6:30, one of the girls at work is having some lady that sells the Body Shop products come and do a little thing for us.  I don't wanna buy anything but i said i'd go.  I didn't have the heart to say no, but maybe it will be fun. whatever. no really looking forward to these 2 things cuz i am usually really tired in the evening after working all day with the kiddies. oh well.

Not sure what I am doing this weekend.  Hopefully something!

Well right now I am just waiting for dad to get home for dinner.  Not sure what I will do tonight.... probably watch a movie lol. oooo but swimming at kel's would be nice! lol
ok well i'm off for now. have a wonderful evening and CHECK OUT MY NEW PICTURES FROM 4TH OF JULY WEEKEND!!!!!!!!!

So last night I didn't end up going to Ann Arbor cuz me & bridg were really tired & i had a busy day planned for today.  So Bridget, her sis Katie, & I watched Win a Date w/ Tad Hamilton, which was alright but something you really only watch once.  Total chick flick lol.

Today I went to 9 am church, then went to see my Grandpa with my mom.  I like driving on nice days, & i love the little things my grandpa does.  It was a nice little visit.  I just got home a few mintues ago & I am going to babysit at 5:30.  Then i get to work 8:30 to 6 tomorrow - it should be a long day lol.  But my mom and i just realized the Ann Arbor Art Fair is not this week, but the following week.  But I already got this friday off so i feel like an idiot.  I will just have to tell her I can work friday if she needs me, and then get wednesday off next week i think.  I hope its not a problem.  Maybe she will even give me this friday off too, that would be a nice break.  So who knows what I will be doing this upcoming weekend.  I wanna visit Jules, but I think she is going up north.  We shall see how it all unfolds lol.  ok I am off for now.  I am really excited it did not rain today lol. ok ta ta.

"event","So last night, Bridget, Me, Erin (her friend from state), & Andrea (Erin's sis) went to the Incubus concert at the palace.  It was amazing!  I love them because they are unique & Brandon has the neatest voice! lol  I made the comment I wanted to steal his vocal chords and kept them in a box for myself whenever I wanted to hear it.  Bridget suggested just stealing Brandon & I agree! lol aw he's beautiful.  They played a really awesome song - it must have been new - in their return thingy (i forget what it is called) and it was really awesome.  I can't wait for it to come out. It was a good time.  I love good concerts.  The lights on stage were really awesome & almost trippy at times too.  sweeeeet.

Today I got up at 10 am (i am proud of myself for not sleeping later) but then ended up watching 90210 re-runs on FX for 2 hours lol.  But it was worth it! Gotta love that show.  Then I cut the grass - it was good to get the walking in & i had my music.  Then i layed out for a while.  i love summer time.  Tans are the best lol.  For now I don't know what I am gonna do with myself, maybe go work out.  I want Bridget to call me back to find out if she can go to Ann Arbor tonight.  It will be nice to visit Caro & party it up with some cute boys she met lol.  Hopefully she calls soon cuz I wanna go early so we can hang out and like go to dinner.  We shall see!  ok i'm off! Have a great weekend! :)

"event","This past weekend I went up to Julie's cottage w/ Jacquie, Al, & Bridget and had a blast as usual.  We hung out with some awesome people, had fun on the water, got a lil sun, & got a lil drunk lol.  It was a great weekend & we got to celebrate Julie's 20th bday.  For more details, look @ Julie's journal on my friends list.  haha I can't believe Jacquie, Bridget, & I sang drunken cariokee to You've Got a Friend.  oh man that was priceless.  I'll have the pics up soon.  I am currently lazy.  I came home w/ a cold/allergies which kinda sucks now.  So this week I have been trying to get over that.

Last night, Bridg, Kel, & I went to see King Arthur.  It was a good movie & I was into it.  The guy who plays Arthur is awesome & beautiful (Clive Owen) & he was in Beyond Borders as well.  I would suggest seeing both movies.  I have pretty much been working this week.  I ran into Alex Axel (future roomie!) & Sue at Caribou one day & sat to talk for a while.  I am soooo excited for next year! Can't wait!  Tomorrow Bridget, Erin (her friend from State, Erin's sis, & I are going to see Incubus at the palace.  I am way excited!!!! Not sure what my plans are for saturday.  Maybe Ann Arbor, Canada, or just relaxing at home to catch up on some sleep.  We'll see!  This week is going by fast....  ok well I am pooped.  have a good night all!

"event","So I worked all yesterday then met Jacquie, her friend from cheerleading - Holly, Bridg, & Kel for dinner at Max &Ermas.  Of course I got the southern chicken salad!  Then we shopped around for a bit.  Bath & Body works was having its sale & i got my favorite aromatherapy body wash (Jasmine Vanilla) & then Night Blooming Jasmine lotion & body spray (which they r retiring! I am soooo sad!).  I also got some from pulse point cream for sleep for 2 bucks! Fun times.  

We went to Tikki Bobs last night, minus kelly but adding Laura.  Fun times as always.  Bridget & I were excited cuz they played Turn me On by Kevin Little or whatever.  We met some boys, one called me today which I am just gonna avoid lol.  I ended up going to Bryce's for a lil after that & played some beer pong (which i suck at!)  My dad had called me & i made the mistake of calling him back so I had to leave Bryce's at 4, right when my girls finally came over.  
So yeah then I had to get up at 7:30 to go to work all day.  I am surprised I made it!  It got a lil rough around nap time lol.  I just did some little things after work.  My bunny, Willy, is dying.  he's been sick for a while but he probably wont make it through the night.  i spent like 45 mintues just petting him this evening.  My sweetie.  Pray that he gets relieved of his pain.  Ok I gotta do some laundry then go to bed and catch up on sleep!  Have a good night!

"event","Sunday night we (Al, Jacquie, CJ, Ryan, & I) went to Bridget's to watch Big Fish.  I ended up falling alseep cuz I was so tired, but woke up for the end lol.

Today I woke up around 11:20, dropped off a movie at Blockbuster, & went to the gym.  Saw Jaclyn working there.  It's so nice to see old friends.  We haven't been able to see eachother too much latley, but hopefully we will some more this summer.  She was my best friend for so many years & i think we will always be friends.  I went to work from 3:30 to 6:30 today then went to dinner at Mom's.  I guess they need me more hours this week, 8:30 to 5 both Tuesday and Wednesday now, which is good for my wallet, but I wanted some extra hours to myself this week.  And Tuesday night we r doing Tikki Bobs so I am gonna be tired at work on Wednesday but oh well!! Gotta go out! lol.  I helped Ryan with his math today.  He has a test tomorrow so I hope that I helped some.  I didn't remember all of it, but he said that I helped.  Tonight everyone is just gonna hang in and rest up for tomorrow night!  well I am off to do that I guess.  night!

"event","So friday night, Me, Bridg, & Kel went to see  The Notebook.  Let me tell you, great movie.  Once again I am gonna say I want love like that!  It was really good!  After the movie, we stopped at a bar/resturant to see Kel's sis.  It will be so nice to be 21 (in 1.5 years lol) and be able to go the bar & sit around and have drinks. Just chill. Bridg & I can't wait lol.  We'd actually have something to do in Rochester! lol

Yesterday, I went to Kristen's shower.  Got stuck in some shitty traffic on 96 on the way, but i finally made it. It was a really nice shower & kristen got tons of nice gifts.  i want my aunts to put on my shower like her's.  Kristen & Mike are getting married in 6 weeks!! I am soo excited for them!  They are soo cute together.  After the shower, I went to a BBQ at Al's house.  It was really nice to hang out with everyone, and his family cooked us great food!  We played volleyball, which turned a little competition but it was all good times.  His mom played with us & she was soo adorable haha.  After Al's, we picked up some ""milk"" (lol we remembered our code name from back in the day) & went to Julie's house.  We just sat around and talked like good old times.  Bridget and I are planning Tikki Bobs on tuesday night the boys might actually come with us.  That will be funny.

I guess my bro was having a lot of pain last night from the surgery.  That sucks, he's already been through a lot lately.  I just hope he heals up well.

Jules and i are gonna go to the scrapbook store today & later Bridget & us will probably go to the mall.  It's a beautiful day & i really wanna spend it outside, but we don't know what to do cuz we have already showered so don't feel like exercising lol.  We'll see. I LOVE having Julie home.  It sucks she is not here all of the time.  I miss the lil things the most, like going to the scrapbook store lol or just hanging out when there's  nothing to do.  But we are going to her cottage for the 4th and her bday and hopefully will make it to kzoo after that. ok but gotta go cuz my dad is yelling at me to come eat my omlette he made me lol.  Enjoy this beautiful day!!!

"event","It's been a long week of work, but i loved it.  Next week i don't have as many hours :(.  But that will give me some time to do some tanning lol.  But yesterday an older boy closed one of my lil boys in a toy bin thing & pinched his finger.  I was upset cuz he hurt my lil cutie dylan.  i love my kiddies.

Last night I got to see Jacquie for a bit while she was home, & kel, me, bridg, & jacquie went to Starbucks then drove around for a bit.  We went to the bank & these weird boys all dressed up in weird clothes drove up and went up to the atm behind bridg & jacquie.  They freaked me out lol and i rolled up my window & told kelly to lock her doors.  it was really funny. But we ended up going to bridget's to watch 50 first dates.  let me tell you, great movie. i want love like that. of course me & bridg got a lil teary eyed at the end lol. we r suckers.

so my bro just got out of his back surgery.  everythings ok.  unfortunately he is gonna have back problems for the rest of his life :(.  but i am glad to hear everything went fine with the surgery.

julie is coming home this weekend!! it will be really nice to see her. i miss her :(.
tonight ill probably go see The Notebook cuz it looks like a really good movie! chick flick! lol
Tomorrow is kristen's shower & then bbq at al's.  should be a good day! have a wonderful night!!

And everyone knows I need my sleep or I am a cranky girl!  But last night kel came over to watch The Missing w/ my dad and me.  It was an interesting movie I guess.  To gory & too many dead animals for me lol.

Jules might be coming home this weekend or going up north.  Everyone that knows her, convince her to come home!!!!  She'll get to see my beautiful face!  On saturday, I have my cousin's wedding shower, which will be lots of fun I am sure.  And friday is payday, which is always good.  This weekend has good potential! But i need to slow down cuz its only tuesday.  I got 3 more days of kids wiping snot on my shirt (which happened today) but also 3 more days of the fun times, like when they giggle or run to give u a huge hug.
As for tonight, not sure what I am gonna do.  Options are go work out, go rollerblading at stoney creek, go to old navy, or go to GLC w/ bridget.  Only time will tell.  U all have a good one!"

"event","So yesterday was a fairly productive day for me!  It's been a while! lol.  I woke up at 11 (later then i'd hoped), caught an episode of 90210 (oh how i miss it!), & decided it was too chilly to lay out.  So I went to the gym for an hour & a half, got father's day cards, mowed the lawn, showered, & went to a BBQ at the Hein's.  Had some yummy food & hung out there will Melissa for a while, then ended up going to Bridget's to watch Calendar Girls.  It was enjoyable even though i was tired.  Bridget had the idea of going to Canada last night but that one pooped out.  We are leaving it for a better time to plan it better.  Today I went to church with Dad, got lunch at the Rochester Mills Brewery, & ran to Target for some things.  I'm home for now. I'll probably just do some lil things around the hosue today.  My dad and i are gonna go rollerblading at stoney creek park later this evening. That should be nice.  But everyone enjoy the beautiful day!"

"event","So I had work today & ended up getting out 2 hours early. It was nice for a friday.  But there was a new lil boy today, named Raphele, that I helped adjust.  It was cute - we just held hands & walked around the playground.  He seemed comfortable with me.  The kids are really getting comfortable around me.  They call me by name now!  But it will be sad cuz the one of the regular ladies in that room has been on vacation & i am scared that once she gets back I won't be in there that often :(. I am sad cuz me & debbie work well together & i like the kids.  But next week I am working 8:30 to 5 everyday.  That will be fun!  I love work & I am really glad I stayed at this daycare.

So nothing much going on this evening. I hung out at mom's for a while.  Now I am just tired & think i might just go to bed early & wake up early.  I wanna tan tomorrow, work out, clean my car, & hopefully find SOMETHING to do lol.

ok that's enough for now.  Enjoy the weekend!"

"event","So last night kel & i finished The Last Samuri.  Great movie.  It really shows the result of guns, war, & the importance of a simple & balanced life.  It is really sad & disgusting how people so easily use guns to take someone's life.  What happened to the value of human life? UGH!
On another note.... I am re-reading Free the Children by Craig Kilburger - a boy who at 12 years old starting the organization Free the Children to help fight child labor and who visited Asia to see it for first hand.  This is the most inspirational book I have ever read. I highly suggest it to everyone.  It will really show you want child labor is & the facts.  It's amazing that 35,000 children dye everyday from poverty & yet some people in the United States feel it is justifiable to spend so much money on ourselves & our possessions.  Buy a $50,000 car, or save probably hundreds of lives?  I am guilty of this on a level as well.  I buy myself clothes, buy Starbucks Lattes $2.75 a pop, and lots more.  If I just saved this money instead and donated it, it might build a school for children in Asia so that they have an alternative to child labor.  Did you know that 8 year old children are forced into Protestution.  And the money doesn't even go to them!  And I know some of you might say well they choose to do that. No, not at all.  The people who find the children tell the parents lies, saying they'll be trained in a skill, taken to school, & will be paid for the work they do.  Flat out, they lie.  Then the children are stuck in unventilated carpet factories, where they are beaten, charged for mistakes, & work at hunched at looms ALL day. I can not even do justice to all that goes on.  Read the book.  Maybe you can find something to do help a bit.  We have to take action.  And I am guilty of knowing the info but doing nothing with it.  I hope I reach some of you & maybe some of you will read the book.  I only hope I can begin to take some action.


On a different note, I am not going to Julie's this weekend :(.  It is just not a good weekend & i really wanna be home for father's day.  And i need to clean my car cuz my dad has been on my case about it.  But i really miss julie & i really wanna visit her, see her new house & all as well. Hopefully we'll see her next weekend in the Roch.  Alrighty, I'm off for now.  Have a wonderful evening & think about what goes on in the world around us & how we can change it!"

"event","So monday afternoon i took jacquie to do some shopping & kel came too.  It was fun just to go around the town.  jacquie & i went to v secret later for semi-anual sale & got some fun stuff. Kel & I ended up watching half of The Last Samuri @ her house while bridg & jacquie went to see stepford wives.  Tuesday I babysat in the morning for Adam - this lil baby boy I am gonna be babysitting for this summer.  His mom had to take their dog to the vet to be put to sleep cuz he had bone cancer. it was soooo sad cuz he seems like such a sweet dog & when they left, he was all excited, but he had no idea what was coming next.  poor thing.  i had to like hold back my tears while she was still there & as soon as she left i balled my eyes out for like 10 mintues. it was so sad.  But When i got there Adam was sleeping & i had to watch him (awake) for a total of 15 mintues before his mom came home & got paided 16 bucks for it. nice.  then i went into work. we watched the pistons game last night @ bridget's (jacquie w/ her ben wallace fro on).  then i said bye to jacquie. i am sad. it sucks cuz we hang out like everyday & all of a sudden she's gonna be gone for 2 weeks straight & a majority of the summer. ugh. 

I babysat adam again today for 3 hours today. he is sooo cute - has the biggest brown eyes. and i have to go to work from 3:30 to 6:30. kel & i will probably finsih the last samuri tonight & i have to work early tomorrow.  jules called today to say that her mom is heading to kzoo on friday to go to the country concert with her so i might catch a ride. hopefully kel & bridg would meet us up there later on saturday. I gotta talk to my dad about father's day cuz i really wanna go see jules. but i hate to miss father's day cuz my dad has been through a lot lately. ill just have to see. oh & a friend from high school choir called me today & she wants to put together an acapella singing group this summer, so that could be lots of fun! ok but for now im off. have a wonderful rainy day!"

"event","So last night we went to Renee's for a BBQ, some drinks, & to watch the Pistons game.  It was fun to chill with everyone (kristine, dan, renee, joe, ricky, burry, nick, jeff, jr, jacquie, al, bridget, & me!).  I found out Ricky got his dick pierced. Thats interesting lol.  Us girls were realizing that all the skinny boys we hung out with in high school have grown up! lol. Now they are all tall and built up. it was funny.  The Piston's game kicked ass cuz we won!! In your face Koby & Shaq!! lol.  Us girls were gonna go to Tikki Bobs on tuesday night, but since the game is on (and we r gonna win the championship!!) we will most likely watch the game. Jacquie leaves wednesday for Champion Cheer Camp counsiling, so that is really sad.  we r gonna miss her since we hang out like everyday. we r just trying to get as much bonding time in before she leaves. well i worked 4 hours this morning & now have the rest of the day to play! lol. I'll probably be out with the girls. Have a beautiful day all!"

"event","ok just to catch up - friday night we watch Monster, which was an extremely depressing movie & i kinda wish i'd never watched it lol.  Saturday, I slept all day and decided not to go to State with bridget to visit her sister. I was really regretting not going to visit julie.  i coulda just gotten up and drove to see her. STUPID! So i ended up being really bored & with nothing to do last night cuz everyone was gone. so i called Caro & drove out to Ann Arbor for the night! it was a good time as always! it really made me excited for next year & being in south quad with alex as a roomie, & getting to arrange our room & all.  i got to meet Caro's friends from work & even saw janu for a bit. we tried a few house parties & ended up at one.  it was a good time - dancing & beer lol.  but there were these white trash girls there that were extremely annoying.  one fat white trashie ended up getting hit by a guy and pushed her way to the bathroom - where i was next in line.  when i couldnt move out of her way (cuz of the crowd) she started hitting me! i was like what the fuck & was pretty much shocked.  she just went into the bathroom & i was like ok.  i can't believe ppl r so quick to violence & so trashy. so that was interesting. Caro ended up meeting this extremely hot guy in the bathroom line. But the cops showed up & we got like locked in the house. we ended up getting out & walked around the block trying to find the hot boy & this van pulls up, opens the back sliding door, shines a flashlight in our faces, and asks us directions. so caro says get the flashlight out of my face and we turned around to book it out of there. yeah that was kinda scary but i remained cool. i called jules & she got me good, pretending she was mad i visited caro and not her.  she got me good! but next weekend i am gonna make out to kzoo, i swear! we even might hit up a country concert! lol. i can't wait to see my jules! alrighty well im off for now!  BBQ at renee's & watching the pistons game, maybe with a couple margarita's! have a good night all & go pistons!!!!"

Monday night, Jacquie had a bonfire & a bunch of people came that i haven't hung out with in while. it was nice to have the gang together.  of course we got wasted - us girls on miller light. lol And bryce & kristine found it necessary to pull in the pool (clothes & all) along with them.  everyone had good convo's, although things turned all drama-like later in the night.  i got to drunk dial caro like 3 times - it was a group effort by me, cj, & bridg).  i had work tomorrow morning at 8:30 and let me tell u that was torture! i survived - barely.  tuesday evening, went to kel's for a swim & we (jacquie, al, brigd, kel, cj, & me) watched the bball game. i left early to get some sleep & i was sad to wake up to hear our boys lost. :(  next game we'll get em!  it has just been great to hang out with the group lately. but i miss julie. hopefully, ill be going to visit her tomorrow, even if it is by myself! lol

"event","so today i slept until about 11:00 & found out i was scheduled to work at 8:30 in the morning! i had checked the schedule wrong. yeah so that kinda sucked, i went in late.  but luckily my boss is really cool, and she even said not to rush and to drive safe.  i have a lot more hours this week so i decided to stay only at kiddy academy and to decline the other job.  i really like where i am working now and do not want to risk that.  and the kiddies are really getting to know me and like me now, and i feel very comfortable there.  i am excited to be working 8:30 to 5:30 every day this week!
i can't decide what to do with myself tonight... i think i am gonna work out and relax, then go to bed early since i have to be at work at 8:30 tomorrow and i don't wanna mess that up! lol.  It was soo hot today and that means summer is coming! i am excited but not cuz its hard to take the kids outside when its so hot.  anyways, i hope everyone had a wonderful day!!"

"event","so tonight me, jacquie, kel, al, kristine, & dan went to bridget's  house for a baking muffins party & to watch the pistons.  it was nice to have us all together & we had a lot of laughs. plus the muffins were AMAZING! lol. yeah the pistons kicked ass too! And i have developed an immense hate for shack to the point it is gonna be hard to watch the rest of the games. but anyways, very good night. so tomorrow i work at 2:30, but i have to go into the other daycare to see about working out some hours. i am really unsure about this whole situation cuz i love my job @ kiddy academy, however i am only currently getting 20 hours a week.  right now i am thinking i will just work there and turn down the other job, however i feel bad becuz i kinda made them think i would work there and i hate to back out on him after he has spent time trying to work things out with me. ugh why am i so nice? but on the other had, he has not really been giving me straight answers and keeps changing the details. whatever, i guess enjoying work and the summer might be more important that earning a ton of money.  i think i am gonna get a job next semester too.  but anyways, tuesday night we might be heading to tikki bobs again - maybe we'll meet more german men or another cute hockey player from u of m. we shall see!  Anyone who wants to join us is welcome!  this weekend, hopefully we'll go visit my jules cuz i miss her dearly!  oh and caro thanks for dealing with my drunk dial last night lol i love ya girl! ok i am supper tired but i am hooked to this new journal so i had to write!  talk to ya all tomorrow! sweet dreams of hot boys as always!"

"event","I didn't get the Teletubbies.  I don't particularly like Barney, but I really didn't get the Teletubbies.  The little ones apparently did, and Pat Roberts aside, I couldn't understand their popularity.  But then I did.

Imagine with me if you will, Tinkiewinkie and the gang out in the rolling meadows.  Hello, hello.  And then a large white orb comes bouncing across the rise, and they scatter.  Or the Tartus materializing in their mist, and they scatter.  Or even John Phillips Sousa wafting in the background, and they run around in circles, and are mashed from above by any one of a number of large illustrations.  Or a large wooden bunny.  Yes, the bunny would be quite satisfying.

So, I hope this explains the teletubbies to those that didn't understand.  Okay, explains may be the wrong word.  But I believe it defines their niche.  Would someone who has little ones who watch Teletubbies please put Benny Hill in the VCR and let me know the results?"

"event","First, a little backstory.  This particular FL Century has an electronically controlled Detroit Series 60 engine, an auto-shift 10 speed transmission, Vorad w/smart cruise installed, as well as dash controller and standard ABS 4S/2M system.  The problem is that at random points in time and space, the manual throttle becomes inoperative, the engine surges from full governed to idle, like the transmission is trying to synchronize the road and the engine speed so it can shift.  This can happen at take off. It can happen at full road speed. It can happen 300 miles from the shop or 20 feet.  Time doesn't matter.  It might reset the first time the engine is cut off and on, and it may not.  The one thing it doesn't do is occur at the shop very often.

So, after spending untold manhours on tracing wiring, replacing ECU's, test driving, and being told we were idiots, we were agreed that something on the truck was malfunctioning, and sending enough bad data down the J-1939 datalink to jam the speed signal to the transmission controller, the Vorad, and possibly the engine.  The problem was that no intellegable codes were being set, The J-1939 and J-1587 data links weren't failing, and that we had replaced every component with a test component.

Oh, did I mention this vehicle had a lane alert system as well.  And it was directly tied into the data link as well.  Just so it would know when the truck reached 35 MPH, and could turn itself on.  This could have been accomplished through the engine ECM or the speedometer, or the manual on/off switch could have been used to turn it off at speeds below 35MPH when not needed.  Or it could have at least been in a manual somewhere.  But it wasn't.  No documentation.

The problem was then solved and the truck is running great, pulling freight, and making money.  We count this as a valuable, if costly, learning experience.  We are also getting some of the training that we needed all along.

I also changed two trailer tires, an oil change, and repaired a leaking coolant reservoir.

Now to ebay to replace those wrenches that were lost or stolen this last month.  Wish me luck."

"event","my paternal grandfather's given name was charlie.  
my maternal grandfather's given name was oscar lee.
i am the oldest grandchild on my father's side of the family,
the second oldest on my mother's.
mom wouldn't let anyone in the family call me charlie,
his name is charles, she said.
so i became charleslee.

i also have a younger first cousin charles,
call sign chuck.
he's a redhead, as is his mother, as is my brother, as was my father when he was young.

youth isn't wasted on the young, but it's damn sure underappreciated.  i know because i was once there."

cats meet on the dark side of the moon to plan, mostly to our benefit.

soon I'll be in the national fingerprint registry due to the hazmat endorsement on my CDL.  time and money aside, i hope it does some good.

cats enjoy our feeble attempts to ignore their bidding.  it's just behind napping, planning for after the nap, and napping in favorite catkin hobbies.

like a magnet, i am drawn to things of iron and steel on ebay.

cats are fascinated by the use of opposable thumbs in opening doors and cans, and in the scratching of chins.

ufo's are powered by magnets.  that's why they dart about so.

post wwI sci fi spoke to the crippling of the enemy's civilian populations and food supplies through the use of biological and neurological toxins delivered by balloons and blimps.

cats will blink when struck with a hammer.

no successful plan ever goes out of style.

"event","For some reason a good vomit post always brightens my day.  Whether it is the common ground we all must walk, or just those warm, vague memories of throwing up, instantly feeling much better, and not having to clean up behind ourselves.  For me, 5 AM Christmas Morning of 62.  Such innocent times. History says not, but I didn't know any better,  Folks, hug your babies.

On the other hand, those of us big guys who eat or drink too much of the wrong things, or who are ill by virus, remember to drink fluids during and afterward, to prevent dehydration, cramping, and the dry heaves.  My fluid of choice is warm water with a bit of salt added.  Also I recommend a standing projectile vomit, outside, to minimize cleanup, and that nasty post nasal drip.  It also helps with stomach cramps.

I don't know why I've never posted before???"

"event","Why do I sometimes feel like the proverbial comic book hero?  Perched high above the 20 and 30 somethings, going about their business, living their lives, posting their posts.  I am firm in my belief that I am on the side of good, on constant sentry duty to protect those below from harm, I'm also confused as to why those same people look on me with suspicion because I am where I am.

They wave, and I don't wave back. I'm supposed to be part of the background by definition.  And when I do wave back, it's out of character, and suspicion increases.  Particularly among the dogs of the law, who I have sworn my life to assist (or at least not annoy).  What's a middle aged Boy Scout to do but slowly fade away?

But how I enjoy being reminded what is was to be sure of ones self, learning life's lessons on a day to day basis."

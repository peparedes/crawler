"event","if feels like for so long i have been looking for a bump.. metaphorically.
doing what i can to become who i want to be, 
finding places where i can be at ease,
and in my search, i found the same old things.. 
i found the simple pleasures of life are all that exist,
and the simple pleasures are becomig few and far between

and i wonder why im still here in this same place running with the same crowd.

what about life? what about running away to find home..?

its getting lonely, especially in a world like this, where no matter how i try to mask it, i am a freak and a no good fetishy glutonous outsider 

time to be on my way.
soon, dont expect me to sit around typing on my handy dandy home computer for much longer..

i need to get the hell away."

i think ive gotten more shit smeared on me from quitting than when i smoked/.. i thaught people would be happy for me..
im just afraid of cancer, 
i got a 60% chance of getting cancer, at least. regardless of my habits...
my mom got cancer removed from her breast, my dad had cancer removed from his face, my aunt died of cancer, so did my grama, and my grampa, and ym cousin. and my uncle has cancer too.. so yea, i decided that would be a shitty way to die...

and i quit doing  a bunch of drugs. so im on the strait and narrow in a sense.. but it feels like hell..
im past the honeymoon stage, and its  torture to live like this.. but then again, i dont wanna be addicted.. so i started smoking a bunch of pot, and eating a bunch of OTCs like no doze and melatonin.

and im sick i think, my faCE IS ALL  pale, my eyes are all sunken in and glazed, and the underneath part of my eye socket is blue and gray. and i cant eat and sleep the way i should. and i am bleeding out of my crotch for weeks at a time. and i feel like i might have an ulcer.

i had to bitch to someone....
theres no one to talk to anymore.. so here i am on this fucking LJ.

but on the sunny side,
i quit my job,
applying everyuhwre
 and im going to see TURBONEGRO next weekend at the showbox, so you should totalllly go too! its all GA i think..

and ym nipples are stilll feelin great.


for the first time in years, my brother my sister and me actually did something together.
we went up the the best western in OH to bring our pregnant girlfriend a pain pill.. and the PM clerk was an asshole, a fucking awful man who decded to give us a bunch of shit for not taking his shit, and he called the cops on us.
(..long story short)
you should have seen the look in his eyes though. it was cold and evil and it sent pain to my heart.
ive never seen a man with that much angst and pain in his eyes.. and ive spent alot of time in mental wards.
needles to say, 
his eyes are burned in my memory and i cant sleep when i think of him, or the sickness he must carry inside his heart.

it was an evil night. and im afraid of the dark again."

"event","when the monotony becomes surreal
and i lose reality along with all the spontainiety that i crave in my life,

the little purple spots start to grow and reform, they turn blue and pink, 
they turn into horned kittens and bloody doves.. the walls and floor from liquid streams.
then i say to myself, this is not my life, and my contience drifts back to a moral human base of reality.

and whats more.. ive been sober for weeks.

restless sleep with dreams of jeoffery dohmer's blood thisrty serial killer mentality possessing my friends and family.. and the dead bodies haunt my sleep.. the corpses, with thier hollow eyes and stealth spirits become real to me.. 
then i see myself die, and feel the pressure of my final blow.. my heart pumps so fast it feels like maggots eating my veins. 

how has this become me?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`

 the pained stare of a sick animal,
the far away gaze of a corpse.
i see it in your face every day. 

its the look that says that tomorrow will never come
for the days ahead will bring no change;
this is the end of evolution
and the beginning of a shallow eternity.

the hollow man will feel no pain
no anger, no hunger, no joy.
his wounded soul will rot amongst
the countless pints he thaughtlessly consumes.

unmistakeably the largest natural disaster the US has ever seen.. thousands and counting dead.. and those who sruvived are left with nothing. the most beautiful and historical city in our nation has been destroyed.

and you know what the mayor of new orleans did about it??
he sent the task force out to hunt luders!!!!.. when they need to be taking care of the dieing and the homeless, and properly disposing of the dead.
and all that has been luded was un-sellable anyways.. it would have been a waste to leave all that food and other shit in the flood.

and george bush is soo balls up over the middle east that all the soldiers who should be here to help restore  the well being of our mangled american citizens are fighting a war that will never end in peace of mind.

this sickens me; the most powerful country in teh world cant choke down its ego for a minute and fix things at home.. we gotta give up on trying to be the hero of the world and work on this disaster area in front of our eyes.

gas is up to 6$/gal in some areas,, almost 4$ right here in coupeville. no one can afford to drive.. that is unless youre bill gates..
im afriad for my own future. 
i wont have social security, i wont be able to afford the means it takes to get me to work, therfore the means it takes to survive on a humane level.

boeing unions are going on strike.. my family will be royally fucked... and my best oppourtunity for a decent job is out the door for the time being. JUST GIVE THEM THE FUCKING PENSION!

all this, and we raised a generation of kids who keep thier thumbs up thier ass and wait for mommy to wipe thier dirty little mouths... 
im thinking that the US has become so dependent and used to its  cozy lifestyle that people are going to sit around and wait for things to get better. 
but it only gets better when the people stand together against our money-mongering government and bulldog our way to the top.

i get a day off.. get to see grillions of friends.. and celebrate!!

on a thicker note..

living fucking proof that Gay 90s is the dirtiest food biz for 100 miles:

last week: i saw 2 rats.. not just any rats,, big ass ones! thier bodies were like twice the size of my foot. and where theres 2, theres 20 you dont see.

i was talking to a former employee.. he quit because there was maggots in the pepperoni and they told him to just scrape off the top layer and use the rest of that bag!? i wouldnt do that in my own house.. and i believe him because:

while i was sweeping and wiping tables tonight i found next to the ketchup and pepper jars, 20$ worth of crystal meth all up in a sack,, just sitting there!.. people dont just leave thier shit around.. so this tweeker  must have had a bunch of fucking dope to forget his bag on the ketchup table.. and what person would do that any other place besides a flop house?

im thinking about quitting..
but its easier to find a job when you have a job, so ill hold out until some other place hires me..

i applied at BOEING.. i hope that works out...
and im going to apply at COSTCO. they treat thier employees well, i hear.
and for now.. since it'll take a long time for either one of them to hire me, im going to keep looking for a local restraunt, or something... im hoping i get in at the mad crab, where kevin ali rob and deal work..
its a real nice yuppie tourist attration place.. so i hear the tips are bomb.

and MOCKI:
if u read this.. tell me  if theyre taking applications and the knead and feed..
i need a job closer to home for now.. and that sounds like it would be cool to look in to."

"event","it was my moms birthday today... my dad made her dinner, and i spent the day with her, shopping around and shit.
too bad she couldnt really enjoy being out, she was in soo much pain.. so we went home early.
i wish this disease shit would leave her body. it seems to keep changing and spreading, and its starting to worry me more, especially when i hear the pain in her voice when she lies and says she is ok, then i hear her cries and such from her bedroom. this is unnecisiary, and hard to watch. but she's  the toughest woman ive ever known so i doubt this will get the best of her.
it just keeps me up,... wishing there was something i could do to help.. and hopeing she'll be well enough to enjoy living closer to my sister... my parents are moving to Sequim soon,,. i dont know what im gonna do.. 
i guess it would be easier if i had friends to back me up.. give me a place to stay while i figure out what i'm going to do with myself. because everthing is so hazy, all i want to do is take it easy and figure shit out... but theres no time for that.. im either trying to sleep or working, and if im lucky, i catch some good zzzs.
maybe its cuz im not used to this schedule; working from 4pm to 11ish is a son of a bitch. and thankless, might i add. shitty wages, shitty tips, shit work.
i was looking at cars so i can tow my ass to this shit hole every day...
my mom dosent want to give me the acura anymore, shes going to sell it because its so old and has 275000 miles on it... and she dosent want me to drive it anymore.
so i have to buy a newer car.. im totally digging the hyundai hatchbacks... theyre realisticly cheap.. like from 5-8 grand... and with the money ive saved, that would leave me with a managable payment.
and its looking like a career in the tattoo biz is going to be the last thing on my to do list.. its lost in the back of my mind and that makes me sad.
i dont know what my next move will be.
i guess buying a car, and finding a better job so i can afford that car.
i hate living a life with so little passion and creativity.. and friends. its like im losing the few i had faster than the flies accumulate on my window sill.
and im starting to question shit too much. because all this time, im thinking to myself al this constant bullshit because theres nothing to take my mind off of it.
at least legal adults get booze to drown thier sorrows.
us kids have to rely on robitussin speed and herion. and you know if youre not in the loop that shit gets hard to come by.
and good ole fashion meditation seems to always turn into a drug craving or a nightmare. i think im just stressed.
so with all this said... im sure its all a bunch of bullshit for you all to skip over while you read the entries of those who have less to say..
or do i have livejournal all wrong?
its not about communication, just self gratification.."

appearantly Don has been transferred from Bayview, and wont work there next school year.
last year, i remember bayview struggling alot to keep it together and progressing because of budget cuts. I cant fucking believe that the District can be so heartless, to steal the ONLY math teacher from a school that already cant fit textbooks or technologically adapted computers into the budget.

i know that if it werent for bayview, i would be dead right now, or dead before my 21st birthday and im not the only one who has been deeply impacted by thier system, making it an incredibly valuable establishment in out community.. its the only thing here that takes un-nerved kids and nourishes them by letting thier souls shine through instead of using the meat grinder method... besides youth groups and sports teams who only appeal to a meager percentege of the kids, bayview stands alone in fighting the good fight; contributing to the future of society.

i cant believe this is happening, and im so incredibly pissed off that im going to find out how to contact the school district manager people and send them letters and emails...
so.. if you want to help me... please do. this cant be.
ill find an email adress to post asap."

"event","what can i say?
life is so incredibly confusing for me.
there are so many things i want to do, so many people i am dieing to see, but with work and the apprenticship at the tat shop, there is no time for a social life, it seems.
i assume it will be easier for me when i have my liscense, so i wont have to sorry about finding rides home, wich is a hell of a bitch.

my tatoo became horribly infected an i ended up in the emergency room last night because the pain was so bad i couldnt walk, so im staying home from work for a couple days .. because i think i caught the infection at work, what with all the filth.. but i got some anti infection and anti inflamitory drugs, so i can walk now.

my mother got a new puppy, a bull terrior, we named her ""rubie tuesday"", to keep up with our musical trend, with our cat elvis, and our lab, bonnie guitar. so now that my mohter cant leave the house exept for her chemo/radiation treatments, she wont be so lonely while me and dad are gone.

**but what really matters, whats on my mind**

so few of you know, that my drug use got WAY out of hand for a while. every time i would swear it off, i would go get loaded again, finding myself in the wrong place at the wrong time.. i ended up curled up in pain and tortured thaughts, vomiting, while coming down from the largest load of heroin i ever done.. and i havent done any since, and its been a week. and im doing well, in fact i havent even smoked pot since then.. for those of you who dont know that much about me, it might be a suprise, me be writing about being a junkie, but its true, and i cant just go on pretending that this isnt reality for  me. im thinking of finding NA again, just because it helps to see other people who are trying to kik it too. last time i was reading the 12 steps, i ended up shooting up 20 minutes later, that was one of first times i realized that i was actually addicted to this shit. and i dont care who is put off by me writing about this, if you dont like it, hell man, be reminded that i would accept any of all your bullshit kindly and with emapthy any day of the week. this is ""step one 2 and 3"", right here, this spilling of guts.

and since that ""best sex ever"", ive been sooo lonely for a real true blue relationship.. because im sick of looking for something thru sex, or thru drugs, or faking it and preteinding that the guy im with is beter than the last/... i try to pray, to find god, but my faith has been canned and trashed,.. and i miss the hard times. when all i could find was god becasue everything else was soo awful i couldnt imagine life without an external power.
and i cant even call these hard times because i always kind fo think back, and say to myself, at least im not institutionalized, trying to hang myself with the shower curtain, splitting my veins with rusty screws i tore loose from the chairs and walls.
so when this shit hits me, and i feel like this; completely lost, i cant really call it bad, or see it for what it is, because of memories of the real bad shit.

so i feel pathetic, worthless and useless..
along with lonileness, the kind where i need a good man to carry me thru this. 
bad enough that im having dreams of my last favorite ex, telling him all the shit i never got to say to him.
all i see is people all around me, in love. and so one who i even want to love.
i want him to come to me. i figure that it would help me spend what free time i can scrape together, away from the junkies. because not only is is starting to show on my body, but my bank is low. even now that im wroking, i cant break even yet.

it makes me miss school, the good ole times where my olbigations seemed so simple, just get up go to school, go home smoke some pot, paint and write poetry.
no time for that kinda shit now."

then there were the faces of people who werent there adn the melting colors.

applied for shell, ACE and the floral shop...

probly go get my permit tomorrow.. god i hope i pass the test, finally.

mike owes me 275$ for this one night, well, a windsheild needed replacing on his mothers car after this one night i never got around to mentioning to you all.. so im waiting for that to come back to me, when it does, im getting my next tattoo i think. 
it wil be a loch ness monster... still designing it, going to bring it to billy to draw up all in detail.

and keith is still here and its still wierd.
we've been playing the 'avoid eachother until the bitter end' game.
so i spend all the time i can, occupied with things other than him, so the finding a job and looking for schooling is like benifiting that situaion.
he wants to stay till august.
not going to happen, its too fucking hard to deal with this, and i dont think he even gets the point.
i never become violent or verbally abusive, exept for when he is around. he brings my evil to the surface."

"event","""there goes my old girlfried
 another diamond ring          
and all those late night promises 
i guess they dont mean a thing
so babe whats the story?
did u find another man?
is it easy to sleep
in the bed that we made?
when you dont look back i guess the 
feelings start to fade away.
i used to feel your fire 
but now its cold inside
and now youre back on the street 
like u didnt miss a beat.

tell me what it takes to let you go?
tell me where the pain is supposed to go?
tell me how it is
that you can sleep
in the night
without thinking you lost
 everything
that you had 
in the night
to the toss of a dime?""

an ~A~ song
its one of my favorites, mostly because its soo crybaby-diva-rock, yet none the less powerful.
its one of those i sing to myself for no particular reason in the comfort of my alone-ness, just because that song has always been there when shit hit the fan.
ironic, relating to this song, ive always been in steven tyler's shoes. being the girl running off to hollywood to fuck for coke (or so i imagine the lyrics visually in my head, just like jenny and forest).. its strange, but much more liberating.
liberating in the sense that i am the one whos smothered out of love.
not taht i have ever done the smothering thing.. i would rather go find a naughty naughty drug and binge unitl the dust settles.
but all in all,
i must admit, this is still the best time in my life, regardless of the big smelly dead corpse in the closet.

seeing the cat man was a revival for me. i saw humans in a respectable light, being reminded again that we have this incredible gift to think completely individually and live in any way. i'll exploit this god given right for a moment with a quote from bob dylan's biography prologue: ""whenever he sensed contentment, whenever he bagan to observe a staleness about his work, or perhaps even lapse into self-parody, chaos followed. he'd hook a U-turn and race madly toward some distant beacon, some Cercean inner voice that beckoned him, without regard for approval or hostile criticizm.""



...waahtever."

"event","i finally have some time to explain myself.
and honestly, i wouldnt take the time to write this is i didnt think i could possibly get some feedback. its wrecking me.

keith coming here could be a painful mistake, honestly. see now, we were young, incredibly young and of course were willing to cling to anything that even resembles love, and that i now believe was the essense of our relationship.

3 years passed since the last time i saw him, 5 years since he moved away.
and as you know, even in this last year i have morphed into something i can now proudly call me, kat, myself. where, keith remembers me as i used to be; a miserable, clingy, absorbed by my image of darkness.

i see him now as a stranger. as he has also changed while living in kentucky. still the same person, but my love is placed somewhere else now. and there is nothing i can do about how i feel. he now never fails to disgust me.

i go to ryans, seeing all these people who i love and share deep connections with somehow, keith sitting there by my side, and i cant connect.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
but ya,
I SAW THE CAT MAN IN FREELAND!!!
that dude that was on teh discovery channel for having the tatooed face and split lip and wishers... THAT DUDE!

i might start an apprenticeship with billy, that tatoo guy in freeland

might get a job either at shell or gay 90s"

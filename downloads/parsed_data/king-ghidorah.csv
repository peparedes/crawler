"event","It's been a week and a half since the wedding, and I have to say I'm pretty damned happy. Feeling broke, but very happy. We can't go on the honeymoon until after the quarter is over, so we have another week before we leave town, but things are good.

The ceremony was beautiful, as was the bride. We are waiting for pictures, and trying to figure out how we are paying for things. But life is otherwise pretty good.

School is all right. The theory and writing part of thesis writing (i.e. most of chapters 1-5) is a bit ahead of schedule; the qualitative research part (i.e. most of chapters 6, 7, 8) is a bit behind. It's a wash, really. I am doing a presentation on my methodology and research plan today, then I have to turn in drafts of chapters 1-7 as they stand now in the next week and a half.

Next quarter will be interesting in comparison.

Maybe some day I will have time for blogging on a regular basis again, but for now, I'm caught up in work, school, and using Facebook to keep up with my students. In theory, I am also planning on setting up a work blog and a MySpace page for work. Oh, and trying to come up with a set of workshops for incoming students.

You know, just sitting around on my butt doing nothing.

Hope y'all are okay.

Back to prepping for my weekly staff meeting...."

Been busy for a while, and by busy I mean insane.

Working on first year of my Ed. D. program, leading to a non-terminal M.A. in education, which means that this quarter I am writing a 25 page paper for an elective course, doing a major rewrite of my first four chapters of my M.A. thesis (including a total change in my theoretical framework... yipee!), writing chapter 5 and parts of chapter 6 of my thesis in draft form and conducting some survey and interview research. 

Oh, yeah. And I'm getting married. Like in 2 weeks.

We'll see how long that lasts.

I had a dream that I needed surgery, though, and that I was calling people to tell them. In the middle of it, I ended up deciding that I needed to get of my old wedding ring, and was calling people to see what I should do and whether I should ask the Ex if she wanted it as a keepsake rather than just tossing it. That was an odd mental detour.

"event","Trying to make some sense of Matt's death keeps sending me back to
reading Euripes' Alcestis as an undergraduate. In the play, Herakles
strides in and when he finds Alcestis' family in mourning, traipses
into Hades and brings the the princess back from the land of the dead
without hesitation. In the play, Herakles is a bit swaggering, larger
than life, practically laughing at the face of adversity, but strongly
a man of both great passion and his word. He's invincible, he's a hero.

And then I realize that my brain is tricking me. I'm still thinking of
Elvis. The part of me that still relates life to books is still showing
me what I keep thinking. That any minute, in the next act, Elvis should
be striding in here bigger than life, straight from the afterlife,
with a princess over his shoulder, as if it were just the next thing
he should do.

Once, when I tried to describe Elvis, I said it was as if he seemed
bigger than life. And The Girl responded, ""that's because he is."" And
it's true. Not that he wasn't very real, and very full of life.
Instead, that's why he seemed so much bigger, and why this is harder
to accept as real, I guess."

I soldiered on, went to the neighbor's birthday party, went with The Girl to a family gathering to discuss what they would do to help when The Girl's oldest brother goes under the knife for major bypass surgery that may well not end well, which was hard and I had to leave the conversation every once in a while. The Girl may travel out to Texas to be with her brother and his wife after the surgery, but juggling that and Elvis' memorial will be a challenge.

Shit.

In response, I finished a pastel painting, an acrylic painting, and started work on a large pastel piece. I needed to create -- too much death sniffing around here.

Twenge</a> of San Diego State University. Recently, I had been exchanging posts with <lj user=""nightxade""> about the author's research on narcissism in young Americans and her theories linking narcissism to self-esteem courses given to pre-schoolers and young school-agers and to similar themes in popular culture. Shortly thereafter I had the opportunity to listen to Dr. Twenge speak at a professional conference, and after that, I decided to pick up her book.

Note that the book is not a scholarly tome -- it is very much written for the mass market. This isn't a bad thing, but that does mean that the scholarly research tends to be buried in the book a little bit -- numbers and methods glossed over quickly, correlations and conclusions brought out with minimal discussion of the means by which the author achieved them. All of this is acceptable, but leaves me with a bit of an empty feeling scholastically. And in the end, I find her conclusions unsatisfactory.

Here's the thing -- she has some very good research tracing the rise of narcissism, isolation and stress among college students, demonstrated strongly over time, with corroborating evidence that similar trends are happening among the more diverse population of school-age children. But linking this to self-esteem training is problematic, since it is not the only variable. And the tracking of only students and not the general population does not isolate this variable. If narcissism has had a linear increase among students since 1970, but this is not shown in the general population nor is it shown in older adults who graduated before widespread use of self-esteem curriculum, then there is a strong correlation between self-esteem training. Otherwise... well, we can say strongly that there has been an increase since 1970. But her data only compare students at the moment of college. So what if baby boomers were only half as narcissistic at age 20 as current college students if we don't know whether they, too, have become twice as narcissistic over the same period of time. Is it this generation who are narcissistic, isolated and stressed out, or is it a broader social pattern? That isn't clear in the research she presents.

Moreover, I'm not convinced that self-esteem training is the cause. My pet theory would be that these personality traits (which seem consistent and linear in her data) would be linked not to self-esteem training but to social trends driven by the growth of consumerism in the United States. The post-WWII economic growth drove a major change in American economic expectations, family structure, living patterns, and familial distribution. It also led to a huge rise in advertising, production, wealth and property ownership, driving a major trend toward consumerism, materialism, and high expectations for ongoing productivity. My theory would be that, in fact, self-esteem training is a symptom of this economic trend and its social impact, including the treatment of children as a matter of status, achievement and expressions of personal value.

In short, I think she's treating a symptom as a cause, myself.

Then again, I like to listen to Economist magazine's weekly podcast, and would subscribe to it if I had the $98/year to cover the subscription, so I'm putting a bias on the table."

Now: foggy enough that John Carpenter would be proud.

edit: Fog and chilly at 11:30am. Sunny and pleasant again by 1:30pm. Go figure.

Last night: after painting the guest room as part of our plan to make it more of a meditation/yoga space, I had left the door shut and the window open to help it dry out faster. Around 2am, I get up for a bathroom trip and find the door open, and the screen popped out of the frame. Our teen-aged (in human, not cat years) broke out the house. 

Now, she's old, she still thinks she's a scrapper, she likes to drink fetid water, and we have a pit bull next door. I start grumbling, honestly worried, get dressed, and open the door to go looking for her when she sidles in with a look on her face as if she were thinking ""how long does it take for you to let me in?"" She's muddy and she knows she's in trouble. The Girl and I ended up cleaning off her paws (pissing off the cat), securing the window, and go on to get too little sleep.

Six years and the cat doesn't try to break out of the house and now that she's elderly she wants to roam around and go back to being a tough cat? Freakin' pain in the butt."

But when I opened the box and tried to synchronize, I learned the L2 is not a phone supported by Apple's iSync.

"event","No Invaders from Mars today, but still plenty of demo work on the outside of the building. The Martians are still supposed to be around campus off and on for a while, so we'll see those gaffers and best boys hauling equipment for a while. No actual actor sightings, just the sound of nearby dialogue. Actual shoots seem to be rather boring, actually. Wonder how they are dealing with our construction guys and their drilling, sanding and hammering. Gotta make those sound engineers just love their jobs.

Meanwhile, the Invaders from High School and Community College, aka our incoming new students should be here starting in just over a week. The first day of welcome week will be, in fact, an overlap day as the Invaders from Mars finish shooting on campus, and the Invaders from High School begin their annual freak out over Actually Being in College. I look forward to the mass confusion.

On a separate front, we aren't sure around here whether the construction on the residence halls will actually be done before move-in day. It's kind of like the rush on one of those home makeover crews where everyone panics and you wonder if they'll get done on time. Only not so fast, and these workers don't really feel the need to rush much."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Hidden for heavy gamer geek content."">Like most role-playing gamers, somewhere in the back of my head is a part of me that always analyzes the mechanics and tries to come up with house rules or changes to make game x work more like I imagine it should. Lately, however, while I have no game group, my brain has been tearing apart the usual games I play in frustration as I try to find something that matches my tastes more.

What I have been looking for is a simple, free-form game to play a more swashbuckling fantasy game. I went so far as unearthing my copy of Jonathan Tweet's <em>Everway</em> to no avail. Still wasn't right. I wanted more of a sense of changing fortunes, more ability for players to manage resources to consider their options. I ended up deciding that Everway did have some good ideas to mine, but that I wanted to focus on a card-based mechanic.

My idea is to pilfer Everway's basic character generation, but to have characters defined by four stats governed by the four suits of a standard deck of cards: Finesse (Spades); Physique (Clubs); Charisma (Hearts); and Intellect (Diamonds). Characters can divide 15 points between these four traits, and then gain a specialization in each area, defined by the player but relating to each trait.

Conflict resolution will be resolved with a deck of playing cards. Any conflict will be defined by the GM based on an element. Solving a puzzle might be a diamonds challenge, a fencing match a spades challenge, a round of verbal sparring a hearts challenge, etc. The size of a player's hand is equal to the player's suit rating, plus 1 if the challenge matches a character's specialization.

The GM's hand size is a bit trickier. I don't want to manage multiple hands, so here goes:
<ol>
<li>There are named (major) and unnamed (supporting) NPCs.
<li>Named NPCs are statted up as normal. Unnamed NPCs are rated as ordinary (1 card) or extraordinary (2 card) NPCs.
<li>The GMs hand is based on the appropriate suit of the highest-ranked named NPC, +2 cards for every other named PC, +2 cards per extraordinary unnamed NPC, +1 car for each ordinary unnamed NPC.
</ol>
Play starts with the lowest-ranked player (or GM), and goes clockwise. The starting player bids first, with each round taken by the high card of the same suit. However, the suit of the challenge is considered trump for that challenge.

Each bid won gives a boon to the winner. That can be used to eliminate an unnamed NPC, damage a trait of a named NPC or PC, or change the conditions of the battle (perhaps giving a bonus card or other advantage to a player).

Each round of play should be role-played as cards are played, using the shifting balance of the cards as cues. Once the last player plays his last card, the battle is either over or, at GM call, a new set of cards can be dealt out, but with one fewer card for every player.

So that's what I have. A bare skeleton of a simple RPG game. I have ideas for a setting already, and am not sure what fantastic elements I want to add.

This intentionally avoids things like special rules for equipment and weapons, and is very vague to promote free-form play. Not sure it will work. Maybe it's time to really write this up and try some playtesting.</lj-cut>"

"event","Yesterday, Steve ""the Crocodile Hunter"" Irwin died in a freak accident - stung in the chest by a stingray while filming a documentary. Strange way to go for a man who has wrestled salt-water crocodiles, been chased by komodo dragons, and handled more venomous snakes than seems reasonable. Then -- cardiac arrest brought on by a creature considered to be venomous enough to be a serious nuisance, but not deadly.

While it was easy to laugh at his enthusiasm and bigger-than-life persona -- and I think more than a little intentionally so -- Steve Irwin brought to the world a passion for and awareness of the wonders of reptiles and large predators that I still admire. Helps that I like both, myself. But in a world where reptiles are seen as creepy and their elimination as a Good Thing, and even more in a world where large predators are feared and treated as a threat to farming, industry and profits, having someone champion them in the public eye was a wonderful thing.

Sometimes it seemed like the man was invulnerable, his enthusiasm enough to part seas and make him unstoppable. But sometimes, working with wild animals has dangers you can't predict. Or stop, even with a giant heart and huge passions.

I just don't get how this one wasn't in the bag. And since attention-seeking unstable individuals don't ever do this, no one could have forseen the outcome.

My suspicion -- John Karr was being eyed by Thai officials for child sex or pornography and managed to get a free trip (on business class, no less, with a little champagne) while avoiding a much worse jail sentence in Thailand. Even if he's going to get busted for a child porn charge in California, I'd bet that still looks sweet compared to a southeast Asian prison stint.

"event","So I may have mentioned after my hospital stay how wonderful the staff at Scripps Mercy Hospital was. A wonderful group of people.

The billing office at Scripps, however, has much less of my happy side. Every time after I go to the emergency room or, in this case, after my hospital stay, I end up with a bill that leads me to call them.

Today's call:
""I have a question about my bill.""

""Yes?"" 

""You are billing me for a total of $1235.""

""Yes, that is the balance showing.""

""Well, according to my insurance records, it seems that I owe you a co-payment of $250. The remaining $985 of that bill was sent to my HMO, and they denied it, noting that since it was a duplicate of charges that neither the insurance company nor I would be responsible for those charges. And I also see that a copy of that was sent to you a week before you billed me. Do you need a transaction number on that?""

""Umm... I'll have to pull your file, sir.""

""Please do. I'd like to make sure this is straightened out.""

""Umm... well, yes, sir, you are correct it seems those charges were added late to your account, pending approval from the insurance company. You only owe us $250.""

""Thank you.""

Every time, I get a bill for amounts already denied or being questioned by the HMO, or clearly disallowed by the contract between the hospital and HMO. Now this could just be incompetence, but it seems much more like it is being done quite intentionally so that the hospital just might get a double payment for services. 

See, they already hit their compensation limit from the insurance company, so they sent a smaller second bill to the HMO, trying to sneak past an audit. And they failed. So they tried to bill it to me, hoping that the notation that ""Your insurance carrier has informed us per the terms of your contract that the balance remaining is your responsibility,"" when they, in fact, had not been told that. Very shady.

Thankfully, I really do read all those statements from my HMO as well as the bills from the hospital.

But rationality is falling to emotion for people I find pretty intelligent. It's crazy.

Then, I read the reports of John Karr, supposedly confessed killer of Jon Benet Ramsey. And as I read the reports, it seems more and more clear to me that while this guy is likely a nutjob and a pedophile, he seems to also have read up a lot on the case and seems to be seeking attention -- but doesn't seem to match up with a killer. Especially since there is no explanation how he was in Boulder, how he could have known the house as much as investigators think, and why his ex-wife doesn't remember him NOT being in the Atlanta area near Christmas while they were married.

I had to take down one of the cabinets in the kitchen because we hadn't noticed before that it was coming off the wall.

"event","I am sick and I hate it. Having swelling in one of the lymph nodes in my throat, easily exhausted, having off and on fevers. And I have been tested for strep throat and the results are negative. The symptoms sound disturbingly like a mild case of mononucleosis, and I don't have time for that shit. Gaah.

But my kitten has joined me here at the new place, so some things are much better.

Sheri has had some ongoing health problems, too, which kind of sucks, especially since I am often too tired or weak to do much to help her. At least, not for any length of time. Boo hoo sucks to be me.

I need to get some food, then probably nap again, and maybe I won't feel so cranky."

"event","Last day of freshman orientation... an end to my 14 day work week (and the period where I have worked 20 of the last 21 days....) The student workers will be sad and we will have a nice closing luncheon for them, and it will be very cute and I will be so tired of dealing with people that I may have to fake it a little. But it will all work out.

Now I get two (two!) days off and I get back to catching up on all my other projects. Woohoo!"

"event","Today is the beginning of the second of five orientation sessions. This is where my life really begins to resemble ""Groundhog Day"" until July 3. Except that somewhere in the midst of it all, I am moving most of my belongings into a storage locker.

Joy.

But work will be fun. Exhausting but fun.

And for a change, I will be compensated for my overtime in actual money, rather than just time off. Woo-hoo!"

"event","The students I went to college with were, as a group, impatient and lazy. We dislike authority, we dislike having to pay dues, and we disliked imposed structure. To us, it was all bullshit that slowed us down. In some ways we were right, but often we were wrong about that, but that's what we saw. It's not that we didn't want to work or do stuff, we just wanted to get past all the stuff we thought was unimportant and get to the good stuff. Paying dues was the way the man kept us down. We didn't buy the idea that paying dues was part of the process of earning a place at the adult table. That, in a nutshell, was the heart of life as a slacker from Generation X. That said, most of my classmates were smart, even when they were stoned. They had as long an attention span as a hyperactive squirrel on crack, but we loved to gather information, sythesize it, true new things, and then get drunk or stoned and fuck, then complain a lot that we were never going to have any money. We argued with our parents, forged families of choice, and learned most of what we wanted from reading, TV, and talking to people at parties who had interesting things to say and stole their lines.

So when I see the students I see on my campus, who have taken many more Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate exams, who have taken more college courses in high school, who have mapped out their lives and done all the right things and own planners and have gone through academic tutoring and coaching; who have parents who are very supportive and mentoring; who join Christian clubs and don't spend their days drunk and stoned in the dorms, why is it that I talk to them and tend to find them much less lucid and clever than the kids I went to school with? I mean, this is a top school in sciences and technology. I went to a third-tier UC campus. We were the troubled kid in the UC system nobody liked to talk about. The slackerest of slacker schools. But despite that, we seemed better prepared to think, live and create. Sure, we bitched and moaned and thought we should just move into the executive suite -- and some of us did (go dot-com boom!) just before loosing everything rather quickly (thanks to the dot-bomb debacle). But in the end, we were pretty clever, if far too whiny and lazy.

The students I see today seem on the surface to be more together and more structured. But a lot of that seems to be surface. They can pass tests, but they don't know what they learned and why. They can't synthesize or analyze well at all. They sure don't communicate, and I seldom see students sitting around debating their classes. I'm not saying it doesn't happen at all, but it seems pretty rare. I find it baffling. I'm supposed to be surrounded with top students, but I mostly see students who lack the spark of curiosity and personal investment of even the most stoned Banana Slugs I knew back then.

What is up with these kids?"

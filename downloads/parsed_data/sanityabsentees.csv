"event","My resolutions for next year are as follows...
1. Lie to an entire country, for personal and political gain
2. Start a war on false information, once again mainly for personal reasons
3. Tell the families of fallen soldiers, that their loved ones died a noble death protecting America against the terrorists and terroristic threats, When in reality I'm just using them as pawns in my sick game to gain control of the world's oil supply
4. Take it upon myself to play God, and basically decline all gay unions any recognition in mainstream America, because it goes against my personal beliefs
5. While I'm playing God, I may as well tell women, that they no longer have the right to make any decision involving abortion. Once again, seeing how this goes against my personal and religious beliefs, I should just go ahead and make it illegal
6. Recommend someone, who is ""currently"" in violation of several Illegal Immigrant Laws, to be the next in line to head up the Homeland Security Council
7. Do my best to offend any Allies we may have, God forbid we have any other countries on our side
8. Use smoke screen tactics, like empty promises for changes in the economy and health care, to shadow the war, and the huge debt it will leave on tax payers
9. Hold my firm stance on terrorism, and pat myself on the back for a job well-done, While the ""real"" head of world terrorism hides in a cave and laughs at me through video messages
10. Last but not least. Dumb it down. Mispronounce a few words here and there, sound more like an uneducated 2nd cousin, than an elected official.
worst case scenerio, they think I'm too stupid to be held responsible for my actions

Now, if I follow these resolutions to a tee. I too could be chosen as Time's, ""Man of the Year""

Past recipients such as Gandhi, Kennedy, or even Nelson Mandela, would be appalled and probably ashamed to share a list with this year's winner, our ""honest and most upstanding of Presidents"", Mr. G.W. Bush."

"event","so let me paint the picture for you.. Celebration Hotel. Hosting the Christmas party for Kate's company. more or less, a lot of uppity rich people, drinking themselves into retardation, mingling with co-workers, and enjoying the night. Crowded ball room, full of people dancing and laughing.. music playing.. (enter Justin) I escorted Kate to the middle of the floor, sat her in a chair, and asked the DJ to kill the music as he handed me the mic. I asked everyone for their attention, and then proceeded to read the following.. something I had wrote earlier in the day...

I know that you hate it
cause I don't often say it
But my day doesn't start without you

I know I don't show it
But I need you to know it
The only thing in my heart, Kate, is you

When people make you mad
and life leaves you sad
I'll be that shoulder you need

And when times get rough
cause they're bound to get tough
I'll be there to watch you succeed

As our time grows longer
My love just grows stronger
I'll feel this way til they bury me

Cause I knew that first day
That eventually I'd say
Kate, will you marry me

as I read the last line, I slipped down to one knee, and removed the ring from my pocket.. just that moment, the room erupted with applause and screams..cameras were flashing, chicks were teary eyed.. and Kate was speechless. Her eyes flowed over with tears of joy, as she fought to catch her breath. I actually took her breath away. Between the tears and attempts to catch her breath, she was able to softly mumble, ""yes"". I took her in my arms, hugged and kissed her.. as a thunderous applause echoed all around us. As one girl told me later.. it was like something from movie, too perfect to be real. The rest of the night was spent shaking hands of those wishing to congratulate us... for a few hours tonight, I felt on top of the world. Guys and girls alike, most of which I had never met, came to commend me on the way I proposed..tonight, I impressed myself.. I went above and beyond anything I had envisioned...  when I saw the joy in her eyes as I placed the ring on her finger,I knew for that brief moment, that I had achieved perfection. This was, by far, the best night of my life."

Kate's been great though, came through with some NFL2K for the PS2, and some bling-bling earrings. Mom came by with some much needed cash, and some clothes. Not too shabby.

And NO!, I didn't evacuate, I stayed up all night watching the wind destroy my neighbors houses. Every once in a while I would go outside and try to walk against the wind. Why? I have no idea, it's the whole ""man vs. nature"" thing. I lost a cat during the 1st night. He decided he was going to go out and venture through the neighborhood. He later realized this wasn't too bright and came home soaking wet. All in all, it wasn't too bad. I have no cable, but I'll manage. Lake County is in shambles though, I guess I got pretty lucky. Most of the roads are out of service due to tress and numerous power lines. Eustis looks like a fuckin battlefield. Houses are missing, gas stations look like Godzilla walked on them, 70 foot Oak trees have been ripped out by the roots and thrown about like ragdolls. Anyways, I guess I should go clean up.

It's kinda nice, lake front property with dock, and a huge backyard. It's nothing I would sport on Cribs, but it's a good house to start out with. I'm really excited about the possibility of getting the house. I think Kate is too. We went out browsing yesterday, trying to get an idea of shit we'll need to get before we could move. Good lord! I never imagined how much I would need, let alone how much money I would have to shell out. But it's cool though, this is a change that's long overdue. I'm really looking forward to it. After saying all that, I found this amusing.. my horoscope for today....

Blinded by the mind's misconceptions, we ignorantly strive for progress on a path that can go no further. Frustration fuels both anger and embarrassment, as yet another path draws to a close. To error is human, to learn from those errors is divine. When searching for forward progression, I now know, a dead end road, isn't a very good place to start after all."

"event","*Click!* I hang up the phone. In mere seconds my mind wanders back to the conversation that just ended. The sound of her voice still echos through my ears. I Soon find myself engulfed by the thought of her. I never thought I would be able to ""hear"" someone smile. It only takes a slight change in her voice, to let me know I'm making her smile. With each word that softly rolls off her lips, another part of me falls harder for her. She can make me feel better about myself, without being in the same room. She can bring an everlasting smile to my face, without saying a word. She can effortlessly make me laugh til my cheeks hurt. She challenges my mind on an intellectual level. Using witty humor, common sense, and learned intelligence, she forces me into thinking situations. And when my line of thinking does happen to take a negative turn, it's her positive reinforcements, that drive me to move ahead. Her eyes are very inviting, but it was her smile that caught my attention. Her words started winning me over, but it was her personality that pushed me over the edge. However, it was her heart that padded my fall. As I lied in her arms, and gazed into her eyes, it dawned on me,.. she is the girl I want and need in my life. She calls to let me know that I'm in her thoughts, and that she misses me, and cares about me. She supports me, for the person I am. But she believes in me, for the person I will one day become. Just being around her has become habit forming. She's like a drug that I can't get enough of. I'm addicted to her. She's an awesome person, I only hope I can bring a smile to her face the way she does to mine. Having Kate as part of my every day life now, has played a huge role in my quest for happiness. Like a lighthouse to a passing by sailor, her words helped to point me in the right direction, and away from danger. If she weren't in my life, I'm not sure where I would be. Without her, I would be lost. She's showered me with compassion, kindness, and understanding. And because of this, it's really hard not to love her. I find her to be, quite simply, amazing. I would be lying to you if I said I didn't have strong feelings for her. But I would be lying to myself though, if I said I didn't love her."

"event","Quick side note... the people in the chat room, have further proven that stupidity of such an outrageous magnitude is in fact possible by people with apposable thumbs. It honestly amazes me, that so many people can allow their mood to be affected by the words of a complete stranger over the internet. And the continually overused phrase, ""I don't care what you people think about me"", just shows that you're too weak of a person to overcome your simplistic insecurities. The ignorance you people display in your feeble attempts to defend yourselves, is horrendous. You fail to realize that your useless words aren't equal to that of a Dr. Suess story. You people are like a group of lab rats, placed in that room for my personal entertainment. I recommend a mass suicide, it's the honorable thing to do. It's not like your lives will amount to anything worth living for anyways. You people are sheep! Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"

"event","So, Saturday was turning out to be just like every other night of my life, sittin at home, watching tv. Dwight called, and within minutes of talking to him, I realized that this wasn't going to be my average Saturday night. Somehow he managed to round up 75$ worth of Citywalk money, and it was burning a hole in his pocket. After rounding up Adam and Jenn, we headed down to pick up Dwight, and then over to Citywalk. Place was fuckin packed. Nothing really exciting going on though, we just walked around and laughed at dumb shit. Adam was ripped when we got there, in true alcoholic fashion. Met up with some of Dwight's friends, and sat around chillin with them. Just as the night began to wear down, and it seemed like it was going to be a relatively uneventful night, something unexpected happened. I'm not quite sure how, or why, but a fight broke out right behind us, between a bouncer and a customer. The two guys involved, lost their balance in the ruckus, and proceeded to topple over into some people we were with. Within seconds, cops swarmed the area, and subdued the guy with a few shots of the taser. I bet he wishes he had never grabbed that bouncer now. Dumbass! By this time, it was after 2am, so we left. Adam, Jenn, and myself, finally rolled into the house around 3:30. Adam hung out for a little while, drunk ass almost passed out. After he left, Jenn and I sat around and discussed life and the many aspects of it. Jenn finally opened up to me, it was such a relief. It's hard to see a friend trying to cope with the same depression, that you went through just a few months earlier. I'm actually really concerned about her. I know how it feels to hit rock bottom. Hopefully, I can use the knowledge I've gained through my personal expirences with depression, to help Jenn out of this negative rut. Jenn's a very strong person. I know she'll get through this. She just needs a little positive reinforcement, and good friends to be there for her in times of need. And whether she likes it or not, I'll be behind her, kicking her ass back to happiness, for as long as it takes to get there. I'll be there to support her, encourage her, and tell her the truth even if it may hurt. But when it's all said and done, I'll be the first to embrace her in open arms, letting her know, I care. Why would I do this? Cause, I AM a good friend."

"event","So get this. My 11 year old cousin was arrested, that's right, arrested. On felony charges, no less. It's a situation being blown way out of proportion by some uptight bitch. Apparently, he was standing at his bus stop, throwing Ritz crackers. I guess one of them happened to hit her car when she drove by. What did she do, she pressed charges against an 11 year old boy. But, better yet, the good 'ol Lake County Sheriff's Officer, picked him up at school, in front of his friends, and took him to the jail, where he was printed and put in a holding cell. To top it off, they charged him with ""projecting a deadly missle into a moving vehicle"". What IN THE FUCK is that shit!? Since when is a fuckin Ritz cracker a ""deadly missle""? I would like to commend the LCS's office on a job well done. Dumbassess!! You make the cast of Reno 9-1-1 look like model officers. A county full of Barney Fifes...
In other news, I lost my ""YerUsualSuspect"" name. LMAO!!, ""someone"" TOS'd me.. whooopity-dooo!!! 
School's good. Carrying a 96 average thus far. Not too shabby. 
What else is new... hmmmmm...I bought a new beanie yesterday, I also picked up a wireless keyboard/mouse set. Takes laziness to a whole new level.
Kate gets home in 3 days!!! Woohooo! This has been one long week, I can't wait to see her. 
Well, I'm going back to the game, and wait on Kate to call. See ya on the flip side."

I'm dreaming of her
She's seeing other guys
Emotions they stir
The sun is gone.
The nights are long
And I am left while the tears fall.

Did you think that I would cry,
on the phone?
Do you know what it feels like,
being alone?
I'll find someone new

[Chorus]
Swing, Swing, Swing from the tangles of
My heart is crushed by a former love
Can you help me find a way
To carry on again.

Wish cast into the sky
I'm moving on
Sweet beginnings do arise
She knows I was wrong
The notes are old,
They bend, they fold
and so do I to a new love.

Do you know what it feels like,

Bury me
(you thought your problems were gone)
Carry me
(away. away, away...)

Swing, Swing, Swing from the tangles of
My heart is crushed by a former love
Can you help me find a way

Through dreams, I can escape the sadness of being me. Through songs, I can bring brief joy, to a lonely heart. Through memories, I can smile once again. Through memories, I will shed more tears. Thoughts of, what is, what was, and what could be, engulf me. Self loathing soon becomes comforting. I try too hard, and think too much. But I fail, because I didn't give my all, and my plan wasn't that thought out. I'm a hypocritical contradiction. I'm a jar full of emptiness. In a world where ""everybody"" is ""somebody"", I'm just ""some guy"". Some guy, that's lost in social purgatory."

Clothes still cover the untidy floor, along with forgotton goals, and shattered dreams. Voices of those no longer with us, reassure us that all will be alright. Everything reminds us of something, and it only takes a something, to make us shed a tear. It's funny, how something that can take a lifetime to build, can be destroyed in mere minutes. True friendships can transcend the boundaries of time and space. Though you are gone, you could never be forgotton.

He's now the image of what happens when someone chooses to drink and drive. Some of you may recall, that I had a cousin pass away, just a little over a week ago. Wrecked his brand new crotch rocket, and never made it out of surgery. One man 23, another just 21. Both men taken down in their prime, It hardly seems fair. The week's events have been the driving force behind much of the in depth soul searching, I have been doing. I was hoping the rest of the week would go ok. Wrong! I had to break plans with Kate last night. Man, that pisses me off to no end, cause it was an encounter I was really lookin forward to. So come today,I get up, everything seems normal. Adam, Paul, Myself, and My father went and played 18 holes of gold today, sounds like fun, right? Not in the least. I'm not only suffering from sleep deprivation, but my body aches and cramps, as it cries out for some much needed rest. But, there is one thing, that takes the cake.... I have to be at work at 4pm... here it is 3:30. Talk about adding insult to injury... I'm just so tired, both emotionally and physically wore out.

"event","<p>Friday - was my anniversary with the girl of my dreams: Ashley Bettinger. I was not able to see her =( cuz i was grounded. it really sucked. but i love her to death.&nbsp;<br />Saturday - my uncle was here. it was fun. yay.<br />Sunday - miss ashley soooo freaking much. it really sucks that i cant see her. i love her sooo much.&nbsp;<br />Monday - i overeact about alot of things. things that i really shouldnt. its just the way i am and feel. i really care about her and i dont try to be overprotective but i guess i just really am. it sucks cuz i feel like she is really upset about it.&nbsp;i dont want her to be. i cant imagine what my life would be like without her. i love her so much more than she will ever know. me being this way is so unfair to her. i give her like no space to make friends when she is so short on them already. i cant believe im like this. its just how i react. i trust her and i always will. and i dont know why im so overprotective, cuz i know that its making her upset. fjkdaslfjdkaslfjdkaslfjdas;fdjakl;fdasj<br />i love her so much. and i hope that she knows that.&nbsp;<br />i need to try harder on this.<br /><br />im glad that i will get to see her soon though =)</p>"

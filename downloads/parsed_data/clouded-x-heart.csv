"event","we had to take the quarter test today. ugh... we have to run the mile tommorow. i reeeeeeeaaaaaly don't want to. i think i'm going to be sick tommorow b4 3rd period. i went to the fair with beth last nite. it was soooo fun !!! and i get to go again (( w/ my family )) on friday. we freaked out these little kids on the pitate ship thing. it was hilarious. beth says in this australien accent "" hi! i'm cany and this is apple!! and the person down there's mi mom !! "" i was like "" omgosh ur NOT australien.. get over it !! "" the little kids just stared at us for a sec then one goes "" hi!! i'm cotton"" beth was like "" wow if we got married we'd be cotton and candy !!! "" it was funny. we saw de'shawn there and rode the bumper cars w/ him. yah, it was interesting. omgosh i found a really cool poem ... look 
""Friends Forever"" you promised 
""Together till the end"" 
We did everything with each other 
You were my best friend 

When I was sad, you were by my side 
When I was scared, you felt my fear. 
You were my best supporter-- 
If I needed you, you were there 

You were the greatest friend, 
You always knew what to say: 
you made everything seem better. 
As long as we had each other, 
Everything would be okay 

But somewhere along the line 
We slowly came apart 
I was here, you were there 
It tore a hold in my heart 

Things were changing 
Our cheerfulmusic reversed its tune 
It was like having salt without pepper 
A sun without its moon. 

Suddenly we were miles apart, 
Two different people, with nothing the same 
It was as if we hadn't been friends; 
Although we knew deep in our hearts 
Neither of us was to blame 

You had made many new friends 
And luckily, so had I 
But that didnt change the hurt-- 
The lloss of our friendship made me cry 

As we grow older things must change 
But they dont always have to end 
Even though its different now 
I want you to know.. 

.....your still my friend..... 

^^^ isn't that sweet ? 
yeah ... i'm gunna go outside and skate .... later"

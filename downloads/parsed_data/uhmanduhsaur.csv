"event","this break has been okay.
today was the first day i didn't do ""something/anything"" but it's cool.
hm, i think livejournal has very less people than i thought it did. no one added me back on my old friends list.
no one likes livejournal. : [ saddd.
okay, well im pretty sure im off to do some cleaning because im wide awake and no one is online [its 1:30 exactly am.]
i woke up at 3 today to my sister calling. lovely.
okay, have a wonderful break guys/girls. and yay, 3 more days until christmas."

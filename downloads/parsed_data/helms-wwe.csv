If I had to stay, Fred better have to! :-\

Jeff, bro? Give me a call or something...I'm worried about you man. 

Matt, I know your out there. Keep your ass away from him! He loved you, trusted you...how the hell can you stab your own brother in the back like that? You disgust me man...seriously.

Jeff, I'm coming over there. You shouldn't be alone."

Got a phone call from the folk's this morning. Apparently my grandmothers pretty ill. I'm going to head on over to see if they can use any help, and hopefully visit with her. My grandmother is truly my favorite person in the world. *smiles* And no I'm not just saying this to score brownie points. She truly is. 

The woman would give you the shirt off her back if you needed it. No questions asked, or needed. 

So; that's where I'll be if anyone needs me. 

And, hey, Sean bro give me a call later. Want to ask you something about this Raven character *smirk* 

Oh and Fred! Check out my current music!"

*Snickers* I've been hanging out with Fred way to much. The man's a pretty decent guy, once you get to know him...and get past the sarcasm. He's not all that bad. 

Just DON'T EVER let him play you at Dreamcast. Don't know how he does it, but he will CHEAT TO NO ENDS! 

Told you I'd tell them Freddie *g*

Jeffro; where have you been bro?

So; new look for the journal, which always leads to some new icons. I'm in a dire need for them anyway. 

Peace Out."

Hmm, what to say, what to say. 

Well,; I finally got free from Jeff. The guys my best friend, but can be really annoying with his in-depth stuff.

Um well, I think I'm gonna go find Shanny then pounce the hell out of him. 

Now doesn't that sound good? Heh.

The pouncing has a meaning though. Have to remind him about the band practice. 

Ah yeah."

Seriously though, we just didn't want him to be left alone. Poor guy has to much on his shoulders. 

Mr. Hardy if your out there reading this, sir I'm truly sorry to hear about your condition. Your going to be in my thoughts and prayers, hope to God you live a long long life. You've always been more like a second father to me..if you need anything Mr. Hardy; please don't hesisitate to ask.

Shanny? Baby..I miss you...

Gregory Shane Helms...
Am An Idiot.

That's right, I've graduated from IGA College. You may all bow to the superior idiot. 

Last night I went over to Jeff's. Only to give him the jacket I borrowed a week ago back. What happens though? I run smack into Shannon Moore. After getting over the ""stunned"" fact, I tried to blend in. Keep in mind that I've had about the worst day possible as it was. That very morning Vince McMahon and JR called me. They had wanted to meet with me to discuss my contract. The meeting went as follows.

<Center><B>A.</B> Greetings
<B>B.</B> We'd like to discuss...yadda yadda yadda
<B>C.</B> If you can only improve.. more yadda's
<B>D.</B> Me getting angry and storming out.</Center>

They've already made me a tag champ with Glen. So I've must have proved to be good enough somewhere down the lines. Why the hell decide to get rid of me now?

So now, Shannon's mad at me, Matt think's I hate him and the WWE wants to get rid of me. Damn, what a <I>Perfect</i> life.


Damn, what I wouldn't give to have the OMEGA team back again....Just Jeff, Matt Hardy, Shannon Moore and myself. We could be a dominating team...<i>yeah what I wouldn't give...</I>"

Time to go off and make those Icon things. Hmm, I've got a feeling that I'm about to get lost already."

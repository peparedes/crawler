"event","&nbsp;Y'know, some people lie, some people are bitches, one or the other isn't so bad. But together it creates a massive pile of useless, waste of space, worthless human being. What does any of this have to do with Sam? The beautiful, most amazing person I've ever met? Oh, right, she's all of those things and then some, at least it seems to add up to that.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now I'm not sure if I've updated since she gave me a blowjob and told me she was a lesbian, but if I&nbsp;have, well, there you go, she did both and now you know. Anyways, over Winter Break she apparently decided she wasn't a lesbian and has a boyfriend now. Y'know, that's not so bad right?&nbsp;I shouldn't call her a motherfucking stupid bitch right?&nbsp;I didn't, don't worry, I called her a stupid motherfucking bitch, and she completely deserves it. Allow me to explain?&nbsp;Here it goes:<br /><br />Back in June, she was still dating her now ex-girlfriend Maddy. Maddy was gorgeous, I mean DAMN. Well anyways, they were on the rocks, to be certain, nearly dating a year though so go them. I&nbsp;had no interest in breaking them up or anything, though I wanted it deep down I would never have tried to CAUSE&nbsp;it. (Not that I&nbsp;ever could anyways.) Well sometime around, let's say June 7th, because it was early June, and that is. So around June 7th Sam told me that she always wondered what it would be like to give a guy a blowjob and she was wondering because recently a good friend of hers had gotten a boyfriend and she kind of liked him. So she asked what I'd say if a girl that was a friend asked to give me one. Well I gave her my answer, I said that I'm weird, I'd probably say no, depending on the person, but most guys, I'm sure, would not turn it down. We then continued talking for a bit and she mentioned that she'd like to first do it with a guy that was a good friend not someone she was dating or anything like that. Day after my birthday she told me she kind of liked me. I&nbsp;was so happy I think I&nbsp;actually made a little squeek noise.<br /><br />Now flash forward to mid July (The 15th-ish), her and Maddy break up! CELEEEEEEEEEBRATE&nbsp;GOOD&nbsp;TIMES!&nbsp;For me, at least. Anyways, I did my best to be a good friend and take care of her with whatever she needed. I did&nbsp;EVERYTHING&nbsp;she asked. I mean, literally, she could have asked for anything I'd have done WHATEVER&nbsp;I&nbsp;could to get it for her. I&nbsp;mean, I&nbsp;took her out to eat, I&nbsp;bought her things constantly, everything. As an early birthday gift I got her a PS3. Then, I&nbsp;got her three games for it. Yeah... I really wanted her to be happy, and did everything I could to make it happen.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now we move forward another week or so. (25th I&nbsp;believe)&nbsp;She comes over to watch porn with me. I was looking forward to this, let me tell you. Now, I wasn't expecting anything just some fun with the girl I was/kind of still am madly in love with. So we're watching and eventually we kind of stop and start talking. Well, after a little bit she asks if she can give me a blowjob. I froze up very quickly. A&nbsp;lot of things raced through my head, and the strongest of which was that conversation from June. I was worried, to say the least. Not to mention her recent break up with Maddy, it didn't seem right. So if you can' t tell I said no. I&nbsp;told her we weren't dating and that didn't feel right to me. She asked multiple times, without specifically saying the words, it got turned around to me having to ask. Of course I wanted it, she knew it and I&nbsp;flat out said it, but that I&nbsp;didn't think it was something we should do. Well, eventually I&nbsp;laid down-ish, and she was laying against me with her head on my chest, neither of us really said anything. After a few minutes of amazingness she sat up and looked down at me. And she said, &quot;Of course I'll go out with you. Just not while I'm still in love with Maddy.&quot; To which I&nbsp;responded, &quot;R...really? I&nbsp;mean, wow...&quot;&nbsp;and then Sam said the real killing blow, &quot;Who else would I&nbsp;go out with? I&nbsp;could never do that to you...&quot;&nbsp;And then she kissed me.&nbsp;<br /><br />*************************************************************PAUSE********************************************************************************<br />This was the best few minutes or seconds, whatever it was, of my entire life. I&nbsp;can't even explain how amazing I&nbsp;felt at this moment specifically. There aren't really words for it, I was so fucking happy I&nbsp;can barely remember it all clearly until it got back to the blowjob thing.<br />************************************************************UNPAUSE******************************************************************************<br /><br />Continuing on with the story, like I said I&nbsp;forget the next part of the conversation except for a few vague things until it was back on giving me a blowjob. Well, it came up again to the point where all I&nbsp;had to do was say&nbsp;&quot;OK&quot;. Eventually I&nbsp;did, but it took a while. And in that time my parents walked in, so I was, in a sense, saved.&nbsp;Before she left however, she did tell me one thing, after kissing me she was pleased to realize that she was in fact bisexual and not just a lesbian as she had been fearing.&nbsp;<br /><br />We hung out pretty much daily at this point. We went to IHOP&nbsp;soon after but everyday it got brought up. Well after IHOP&nbsp;Sam asked if I wanted to. I&nbsp;finally just said yes. I&nbsp;couldn't just... keep saying no, it was hard enough as it was. Not to mention she had started to tell some sexual lesbian stories, and I&nbsp;am only a guy. Well, anyways, we go to the woods and in the course of an hour the deed is done. I&nbsp;take her home and go home myself, and that was that. I was happy, I thought we were going to be going out soon and my life was nearly perfect. Well, this was as close as it would get.&nbsp;<br /><br />The next day, Sam and I&nbsp;were talking online and she told me she realized she was a lesbian. This made no sense to me and it never had... doesn't to this day and now I&nbsp;know why. After a month of it being REALLY&nbsp;bad for me, I went to IUP, that's another story, I&nbsp;went there, and had the time of my life, realized things may not be so horrible in life after all, light at the end of the tunnel, all that. So when I got back I&nbsp;was OK&nbsp;that she was a lesbian, even if I still loved her.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now is when the bomb drops. Two days ago, I&nbsp;got home from visiting friends in Geneva, I&nbsp;asked how she was. Actually, here is the conversation:<br /><br />(8:32:55 PM) Doug: how have you been?<br />(8:33:01 PM) Sam: tired, but good<br />(8:35:00 PM) Doug: that's nice<br />(8:35:02 PM) Doug: how was your break?<br />(8:35:09 PM) Sam: uhhhh<br />(8:35:16 PM) Sam: well<br />(8:35:28 PM) Sam: do you remember calvin?<br />(8:35:42 PM) Doug: vaguely why?<br />(8:36:00 PM) Sam: well he and i have gotten rather close lately<br />(8:36:08 PM) Doug: oh<br />(8:36:12 PM) Doug: that's nice<br />(8:36:20 PM) Sam: well<br />(8:36:39 PM) Sam: he's kind of my boyfriend now<br /><br />Yeah... that hurt, really bad. Evertything I feared was coming true. It didn't add up and never did. To me this all leads to one thing, she never wanted to and maybe never even intended on dating me, she just... wanted to give a guy, close friend, that she trusted a lot a blowjob. She wanted to try it and well, I&nbsp;fit the description nicely. I suppose it's possible this is all a coincidence, but it just makes too much sense... at least I&nbsp;think so. Take from it and draw your own conclusion, but mine is pretty simple:<br /><br />Sam is a stupid motherfucking bitch. And she can go to hell. <br /><br />Thanks for listening.=<br /><br type=""_moz"" />"

"event","Well, in the last thirteen weeks, if there's on thing that's happened to me, I've grown a pair. Honestly, I simply don't care anymore about anyone's opinion but my friend's. If I say something insulting with some random person around, OH WELL! They'll live, and so will I. It's easier just to say what you have to say, to whomever it is, than make up a lie to appease everyone. That's not to say I still won't be as polite as possible. It's just that I don't feel a need to think about everything I say one thousand times over anymore! <br /><br />On top of that, I love Sam, I've been in love before, I know what love is, and it's the only thing I have describe my feelings for her. It's not just that I <i>like</i> her anymore, I love her. We've been hanging out more lately, though she's on vacation now (more on that stuff later), and it's amazing. Every time we hang out I have an awesome time! I think I might be too smitten around her once in while, but that really can't be helped, and I don't think she minds much anyway. The best part about the whole thing is that she likes me too!&nbsp; I can't say I could have been more pleased! Obviously we can't date or anything like that, she has Maddy, and that's fine. It's enough for me that she likes me to be perfectly honest. That's not to say I wouldn't like to date her, Hell, there's nothing I'd like MORE than that. But I don't want to be an issue, or problem with her relationship with Maddy. It's just great that she enjoys my company and everything. <br /><br />Anyway, on a slightly different note, I'm working out, and it's been three days. I'm pleased to say you can see the difference to this point. I've kept a log of what I've done, and it looks like this so far:<br /><br />July 1st:<br />Situps (Sets of 50): 2<br />Crunches (Sets of 50): 2<br />Bicycle Excercize (sets of 50): 2<br />Run a Mile: 2<br />Walk a Mile: 0<br />Bike Two Miles: 1<br />Pushups (Sets of 25): 1<br /><br />July 2nd:<br />Situps (Sets of 50): 3<br />Crunches (Sets of 50): 2<br />Bicycle Excercize (sets of 50): 3<br />Run a Mile: <br />Walk a Mile: 1<br />Bike Two Miles: 2<br />Pushups (Sets of 25): 2<br /><br />July 3rd:<br />Situps (Sets of 50): 3<br />Crunches (Sets of 50): 2<br />Bicycle Excercize (sets of 50): 2<br />Run a Mile: <br />Walk a Mile: 1<br />Bike Two Miles: 1<br />Pushups (Sets of 25): 2<br /><br />Don't ask why, but you can tell that I've been working. Now, it's SLIGHTLY less related because I'm doing that for Sam's sake. She wants me to have abs or whatever, so I am. I'd do anything for her, because to be honest, she's perfect. There's absolutely NOTHING I dislike about her. Fuck what I said when I first met her, she IS gorgeous, she IS extremely pretty, and she IS all the other things I've said, be it smart, funny, nice, it doesn't matter, she's all of them. It's amazing, it really is, because I don't know how I'll possibly find a person I'll be happy being with assuming her and I don't get together at some point. Everyone I meet will be compared with her, and they'll all fail miserably because of that. But that's just what I'm like,&nbsp; I'm picky like that. Honestly, everyone and their brother knows Sam and I are perfect for each other, I'm fairly certain she knows it too. I admit I wasn't completely honest with her when she asked me, ""What, you don't think we'd be great together?"" But at the time I COMPLETELY believed whatever I told her. But that's only because I convinced myself too... though now I don't remember why... that aside, I keep hoping that I'll get to be with Sam at some point... I just know it would be amazing. It'd be the most perfect thing ever...<br /><br />Anyway, I did say I'd explain something, she's on vacation. East Coast until the 14th or 15th-ish. It sucks, but on the other hand it gives me time to get in shape and all that for her return. She's my SOUL motivation for all the work I'm doing. I just can't wait to see the final results of it, and I'm sure she'll be surprised too! She motivates me... that is basically the absolute clincher on how perfect she is... nobody motivates me, especially to do work, but she did. <br /><br />One last story to explain how amazing she is... she calms down... I mean, sometimes I get pissed, most of my friends have seen it, it'll take me an hour to calm down, but whenever that happens around her, be it at my brother, mom, dad, anything, she just... looks at me and I calm down, and apologize, immediately. It's amazing... <br /><br /><br />Alright, well, I think that's all for now. I'm done. Until next time loves :D"

"event","I haven't updated in a while, nothing really seemed worthy, but I had quite a dream last night. It seemed so real, but at the same time, looking back, some things made no sense. I don't have a ton of time so here's the quick version:

I got up and it was late October, and rainy. I went to school, and somehow caught a bus or something to New York, about, I dunno, 30 minutes from Central Park? I was going to meet Meredith, and I caught a ride to Central Park with my cousin Megan after her school ended. (I had been planning on taking a plane, but oddly enough I was already in NY and caught a ride with her). Well it was raining so we met at a restaurant, where I had no pants on but I did have a blanket so somehow I hid the not having pants thing? I had boxers on though, no worries ;). Alright, so basically when Meredith got there she was wearing a beautiful white dress, and she came in, and I kinda looked away, and then just turned and looked at her. We both knew who the other was, but we just... stood there a sec, and then hugged. Then she walked a few feet towards the table and looked up and back at me and I gave her a kiss. After I did that she stared at me like, ""What was that?"" and I said, ""You're just gonna have to get used to that from now on Meredith,"" and smiled at her. She laughed and we went to eat. There was this small chicken on the table, and the waiter was doing something with it, what I can't tell you, but regardless, Meredith put it on her plate and cut a part off. For a brief second this weird thought of her trying to get fat crossed my mind, but it went away, and we ended up splitting the chicken. The next day we met at some record/CD store, Meredith was wearing jeans and a shirt this time, and I remembered my pants! Well, I guess she enjoyed the kiss, cause we ended up in some corner or other of the store making out for a while, before we noticed our friend, who I guess was a celebrity. Cause she came in and signed some pens, yes pens, for us and when we said, ""Uh, no thanks"" she got all piss-y till she noticed it was us. Not so much piss-y actually it was more like pompous celebrity ""I'm awesome how can't you want my autograph kinda thing. Well after she left, Meredith and I kinda looked around, and then I woke up... it was a weird dream. Not a bad one necessarily, but weird all the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;"

"event","So, life is going absolutely 99.9% perfect right now. Literally, it's THAT close to perfect. There is merely one small hitch. Now, before I mention said hitch, I shall do a quick update on one Sam Russ, of whom I am quite fond. First off, I don't <i>like</i> her anymore, that obsession has been over for a few weeks now. I still think she's wonderful, and pretty, but I couldn't date her if she wanted to, she's too... Sam? Haha... not too many adjectives work for her. Now then, the hitch, her AIM away message is, &quot;I'm actually so free that I don't know what to do with myself. Everyone's doing wedding crap or going to concerts these next three days.&quot; And so I was gonna invite her over to play some Wii with me, because I too am VERY FREAKING BORED. Nobody's around in the weekday... I had a half day for finals.<br /><br />Now that the complaining is done... it's time for me to tell you why I feel like crying with happiness as I write this, no joke... I can feel tears in my eyes... I'm that happy. Here it goes:<br /><br />1) The last two days I've had finals, and I thought I did absolutely TERRIBLE on my Physics one, failed it in fact. Well, I had a 102% in the class, so it'd be HARD for me to end with below an A, but I wanted to be sure, ergo I went to see my teacher today. Now, when I went up to him I asked about my final and he says, &quot;You got a C&quot; and I said &quot;YES!&quot; (Not super loud, but I said it). He looked at me rather confused and said, &quot;I was just kidding... you got an A&quot; which made me absolutely ELATED! On top of that I got a 110% on my Math Analysis final, and AT LEAST 100% on my Probability and Statistics final.<br /><br />2) Mary Beth is simply the most interesting person in the world, what can I say? I've been talking to her on the phone daily for... two weeks now, for HOURS ON END, and there are times of 5-10 minutes of no talking, we have Cingular, so there's no point hanging up to call back 10 minutes later, but every minute of it is WONDERFUL! She's quickly become one of my best friends in the world, and I love her for it. She's far too hard on herself as well. She complains all the time about how horrible she is in so many ways, but I sure as hell don't see it?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A) She's a WONDERFUL singer, best I've ever spoken with.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B) 99% of the time, she knows EXACTLY what to say to make you laugh or cheer up.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C) There's nobody in the world more interesting to talk to, I mean, we spoke on the phone 30+ hours over the last two weeks, and STILL HAVE SHIT TO TALK ABOUT.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D) She appreciates things, everything, from the smallest possible thing you could imagine, to being given a laptop. Doesn't matter, she appreciates it all.<br /><br />3) The class I was worried I'd fail... it turns out I have at least a C+ in... and I had a 47% in it before break. <br /><br />4) My semester grades will look like this at WORST:<br />1st Block - Physics - A<br />2nd Block - Math Analysis - A+<br />3rd Block - Probability and Statistics - A+<br />4th Block - Teacher Cadet - C+<br /><br />5) Last but not least... I've realized lately that I have the best friends in the world. The best anyone could possibly ask for in the whole universe. Whether its my best friend William who I hang out with a few times a month, Sam who I see daily, but don't really hang out with, or ANY of my AMAZING friends from the internet, Teresa (Ego stealing bitch! ;) ), MB (Bob Marley DOES NOT SING DON'T WORRY BE HAPPY NOW!), Kitsu (Two hours isn't THAT long!), Cloudy (BIG BANG GLOVES!!!), Haley (DAMN RIGHT I SAID IT), Crystal (Tough love... tough love...), Meredith (MERCLAIREMERBEAR HAHAHA), Annia (You defy the laws of EMO), N double S (YOU HAVE THE BEST DAAAAAMN NAAAME!!!!), and all the rest I can't even think of at the moment. Every single one of'm are the BEST, every one of them are great for something... be it advice or someone to bitch at for problems other people caused me! All of them UNDERSTAND me, and most importantly not ONE of them gives a SHIT about what I can do for them... the only thing they give a shit about is that I'm there. These are all things that please me... and bring me tears of joy...<br /><br />PS: If I forgot you, I'M SORRY I SUCK AT THINKING!!! =D"

"event","Basically I went to another high school for my last period, this every Monday and Tuesday for the rest of the year. Well, I have to catch a public bus afterwards, which is an hour long ride from there to my house. Unfortunately I missed the 2:45 bus, I get out at 2:20 and that's the closest one. Then, it's supposed to come every 30 minutes, but did it? Of course not, it had to not come until 3:45, but by then I already had my brother's girlfriend, Katherine, who's living with us at the moment, come to pick me up. By the time she gets there it's about 4:00-4:10, and I didn't even get home until 4:30ish. It seems crazy I'd miss a bus that comes 25 minutes after my class ends I know, but in fact I was waiting at a bus stop that's 10 feet from the door of the school I was at. Problem with that, is it doesn't COME THERE ANYMORE! Starting that year it only comes across the street from the school... hence, I never got on... ugh, it sucked."

I all but went insane sitting in the car for 10 hours today, not that it would have made a difference. *shrug*. hat's life though I guess.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm probably just going to sit awake, and stare at nothing for a few more hours, but I suppose I'll add goodnight to the end of here."

They just kinda came over and hung out for 2 hours talking. xD My mom now thinks I have some massive crush on her, as does my brother, who asked, ""Did you two sneak off and kiss somewhere Doug?"" My mom just kept asking questions about her, with that, ""You like her don't you?"" smile on her face. It was really annoying. The meeting of Tara was so fun though, and as I said her dad and mom were real nice.

When they came in, they walked RIGHT past me, I was sitting on a couch in the lobby. As they walked by, Tara turned her head and saw me, and says, ""Doug..."" really quietly under her breath while shaking her head! It was HILARIOUS!!! I almost broke out laughing. Anywho, I then just said, ""How's it going?"" To which her dad responded, ""Are you Doug?"" Then it all just went from there. Very easy to talk to and such, nice people, you know, that whole jazz. Aside from liking a few crappy shows, it couldn't have gone better! :D

Ugh, I got to bed sometime after 1:00AM.&nbsp;I was really happy, because although I was up from 10:30PM-then unable to think of anything except the last two nights, I was still going to get a fair amount of sleep based on how tired I was. You know, that feeling right before you fall asleep? Well, it hit me, and then the worst dream EVER! Or so I thought...

So, apparently I was getting married in my dream, xD, which is strange, I've had dreams where I got married before, but in general, the ceremony never happened in the dream, while in this one, it did. Anyway, I go to the room where my bride should be, I had gone to the bathroom for whatever reason after the ceremony, and, I REALLY wish I hadn't gone and opened the door to THAT room. Ugh, and let me just say, I don't know WHO that dude was... *shudders*

Well, needless to say I woke up, and ugh, it was not fun, I fell back asleep quickly, only to have the SAME DAMN DREAM, BUT WORSE! This time... *shuuuuuuuuuuuuuuudder* my BROTHER was there... and you can bet where he came in... I woke up from that one, and took a bath, for about an hour.&nbsp;"

"event","I picked poison number two of the options Kit gave me. <br /><br />Kit's post: <br /><br />Time has come to take some action. <br />The Leader-char is about... a day or so from Confiscation. <br /><br /><span style=""FONT-WEIGHT: bold""><span style=""TEXT-DECORATION: underline"">THE OPTIONS </span></span><br /><span style=""FONT-WEIGHT: bold"">1.) </span>You adopt Doublestar-character and eliminate Blackwater-character. <br /><span style=""FONT-WEIGHT: bold"">2.) </span>An appropriate end is found for Doublestar-character and Blackwater-character gets a promotion. You'd NPC Doublestar until such time as that end is arranged. <br /><span style=""FONT-WEIGHT: bold"">3.) </span>You opt to maintain deputy status and a new player is found for Doublestar-character. <br /><br />So, Blackie, pick your poison.<br /><br /><br />MY RESPONSE: <br /><br />Well, after talking with Willow... and by no convincing of her I assure you. I'm going to go with promoting Blackwater. Reasons: <br /><br />Option 1: <br />I hate the character Doublestar... I thought he sucked just from his name history. Not to offend anyone, just giving my own opinion of him. <br /><br />Option 2: <br />You'll know why I chose this after you see the rejection of option three lives this as the only other. <br /><br />Option 3: <br />Well... this option would require me NPCing Doublestar until an appropriate suitor is found. Based on the fact that that could take AGES, as this is a Clan LEADER that's being searched for, and the fact that the first person to apply will be Webfoot... which will just annoy everyone, I think I'd end up playing Doublestar for a long time if I went with this. It honestly just seems pointless to bother with this one, if I'm going to end up playing the leader of the Clan for possibly a long time, then I might as well do it with a character I like. <br /><br />Therefore, I have chosen option 2 Kit. :) Thanks, Iodine seems like a fine poison to kill me with! <br /><br /><br />There you have it... my cat Blackwater, will soon become Blackstar, and run WindClan. I suppose that means the deputy search will be on!"

"event","I know, two posts in ONE DAY!?!?!? What is WRONG with me! Well... let's not open that huge ass can of worms. Anywho, I had a STRANGE dream on the way to Philly today. Here is how it went.

PS: I've decided to post ALL dreams that I have from now on, on LJ.

Well, it started off at my friend Joe's house. We got in his car, and I was driving it. We're on the highway, and someone HITS his car. The trunk's top fell off. For some reason, we didn't stay at the scene, we just kept going, and Joe just goes, ""Don't worry, it happens."" Which is weird, because I all but wrecked the back of his car. Then I FLIP the car, and somehow we ended up on a big open sand area. It was strange, and the car rolled back over and is all dented, and Joe says the same thing. ""Don't worry, it happens."" FINALLY! We made it to William's house, I dunno why we went there, but apparently I murdered someone and was hiding the body and shit. Then as I'm about to leave, I'm in his den, and I see them about to pull in, and I go, ""OH SHIT!"" I started to haul ass out his back door, and then I woke up.

Dream over!"

"event","<p>I think there comes a certain point, when it really doesn't matter anymore if I can't sleep. There's just a certain point that it happens because I can no longer stay awake. Unfortunately, that point hasn't hit me yet. 3:00AM last night, I didn't fall asleep until a bit past then. It wasn't quite the same as the last two nights. The last two nights I've been trying to make it go away, and, that just hasn't worked out too well for me. Last night I just couldn't figure out why I liked the things I liked about the person. I don't even give a shit anymore, for my own sanity,&nbsp;I have to write these down somewhere, and I really need it to be a place my family can never find. It'd be far worse than anyone else in the world finding them, so here it goes, in no paticular order, I shall write down my findings last night.<br /><br />1) She's sweet, and not the cliche, almost annoying kind of sweet. If something bad were to happen, she's not just going to say, ""Oh, don't worry, it'll get better,"" or, ""Aw, I'm sorry, I know how you feel,"" and definitely not, ""Well, you just have to look at the glass as half full, at least now..."" and blah blah blah blah. She'd tell you something that nobody you know has probably ever said before, that has 10X the worth, because it's not cliche bullshit.<br /><br />2) She's nice, genuinely nice. Far as I've ever been able to tell, she likes everyone until they give her a reason not to. Most people, are quite the opposite, and take an approach closer to, ""What have you done for me lately?"" While she seems to take a more, ""What have you done to piss me off lately,"" kind of look at it.<br /><br />3) She's interesting, you can talk to her about a block of wood for an hour an not get bored, because even if you think you have the most perfect block of wood, she can analyze it for that hour, just asking you things, to prove to you it's not the best one, and in fact, may not even be very good at all. Or, she could probably think of a completely ridiculous game for you to play, using said block of wood.&nbsp;<br /><br />4) She's honest, and not just, if you ask a question she'll say yes or no, without lying. It's more than that, it's like, if yoyou say something, anywhere, and she sees it, she'll probably give her opinion on what you said, whether you ask or not. Also... if you tell a joke, and she's not fond of it, she'll, unfortunately, give you no credit for it, no matter how perfectly timed you used said joke.<br /><br />5) Being tired of saying she's... I'm going to now say, ""Said person is,"" and this category would be, smart. Quite actually, one of the smarter people that I've had the pleasure of knowing. I'd definitely say she's up there with the Kitsufox, of the world. Yes, the KITSUFOX, not -FOX's, xD there's nobody quite like Kit to the Fox of the Extraordinary Variety.&nbsp; (See, if you read this, you get some ego stroking too Kit! xD). Anywho, she's just one of those people who's good at explaining things... and seems to have an answer to everything.<br /><br />6) Said person is also funny. I'm not really sure how hard it is to explain this, but it's easy to laugh while talking to her. Not so much that she even makes jokes, as the jokes just... pop up. It's really pretty funny. She's not uptight, so you don't have to, be afraid of offending her with something stupid, she's not going to take it the wrong way. Makes life a Hell of a lot easier.<br /><br />7)&nbsp;Damn... possibly the most confident person in the world, but it's... the most amazing thing I've ever seen. She could literally, walk up to you and say, ""I'm awesome, and probably the coolest person here,"" and at the same time not seem stuck up, or cocky, or anything like that, in any, way shape, or form. I dunno what it is, but there's just something the way she goes about doing it, that's amazing. Not to mention, with the way most girls/woman/females, whatever you wanna call them, are these days, ""Oh my God, I'm not this, or I'm not that,"" and all that annoying bullshit, it's nice to have someone who thinks highly of themself, and at the same time isn't... an asshole about it.<br /><br />8) Though I haven't seen much of said nameless person, from what I can tell, she's certainly pretty.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm getting tired of giving massive compliments, so I think I'll leave at this, and let's just hope this makes it all go away. And I can get over this stupid crush thing, because it annoys me... again, not that the person isn't worthy of a crush and all that, but... it's just weird, and I always feel stupid when I talk to her. *shrug* That's life I guess though.</p>"

"event","The meaning of sleep has escaped me, for reasons quite similar to those yesterday. As far as... annoyance, it wasn't quite as bad, as may be known, or unknown by the universe of mine, I spoke with the person yesterday, so it's not bugging me quite as much. Still though, it's frustrating, I've become fond of sleep over the years, and I miss it a good amount. I only slept THREE FRICING HOURS last night. Fell asleep around 4, my brother wakes me up about 7, mind you, I was trying to sleep since about 8:00 because I couldn't the night before. Then I go upstairs, and I can't fall asleep, or even come close. I decide to come back downstairs for a bit, and I end up staying on 'till like 11:00. Go back upstairs to sleep, NOTHIN'!!! GAH! Life is cruel... so very cruel. On the bright side, there was another small thing keeping me awake last night, Gary was snoring like HELL! However, that wasn't it as much as the other thing. I AM DETERMINED HOWEVER, TO SLEEP TONIGHT!!!!!"

Then this morning, my mom called our room from hers, and I was trying to do what she told me and she said, ""I'm coming over there,"" and I said, ""What the Hell was that as I hung up,"" but she heard. I didn't mean it to be a mean thing, and I feel terrible now... ugh, this has been a crappy ass few hours. Aside from those two things though, GREAT DAY! Ugh... life is a bitch...

"event","Well, it's been a while since a lot of things for me. I haven't really talked to Willow in ages, I've been very inactive on any website of late, as I have my friend Matt over, Yukon died... three weeks ago now.... it's been a long.... long while. I never got around to saying how much I miss him, which is a shame, but I think it's best anyway, no need to garnered unnecessary sympathy, which is what that would have been. There are far more painful things than losing a pet. That doesn't take away any feelings of sadness that he's gone, but I guess life just goes on. The Cubs have been kicking butt, unfortunately that's going to change now that Alfonso Soriano is out for 2 weeks to a month... I'll just tell you his contract: 6 years $136 MILLION dollars... AKA $20+ million/year.&nbsp; On the bright side I bought Super Mario Strikers CHARGED for the Wii yesterday, and I got Kit on my Wii-mail xD, that was funny, and quite the challenge. I'm a bit tired, just woke up... so... off to somewhere else..."

It's going to be so hard to say bye. Then we're going to have to bury him tomorrow too, which is really gonna suck. I almost feel like just getting the memorial for him out of the way now, just posting some pictures and things. Not much, but it's something. I'll wait until tomorrow though... put off saying goodbye. I'm going to watch the Cubs in about 3-4 minutes with Gary and my mom, keep his mind off of things best I can, so I should get going here pretty quickly."

It doesn't seem right that he's not going to greet me at the door when I get home anymore, or bark at me when I yell at my younger siblings for being idiots, or cheer when one of my sports teams score. I'll up up a few pictures of him the day we take him to the vet... just, because. *sigh* I don't think I can say anything else without crying, which I did plenty of last night, so... yeah..."

On vacation, you're supposedly not supposed to do anything, but if that's the case I HATE VACATIONING! I need to be doing things, and if I am ever that bored over the course of a week again... I may explode! It actually got to the point where I was using my time to SHUFFLE CARDS FOR FUN! SHUFFLE!!!! I actually thought I was going to DIE of boredom. I mean, the only fun I had was playing the TWO games of Hold'em poker, the two times we went tubing, and watching ONE cubs game. That accumulates about... 9-10 hours of my vacation, TOPS, and that's out of a WEEK! Seriously, couldn't do... ANYTHING. I'm so glad to be back, I actually hugged my sister! GAH! Alright, well that's about all there is to say... I'm off to Bill's later, YAY NOT BORING!!!!"

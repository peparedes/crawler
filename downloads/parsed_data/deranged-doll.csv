You are not easily intimidated.<br /><br />You master any and all skills easily. You don't have to work hard for what you want.<br /><br />You make your life out to be exactly how you want it. And you'll knock down anyone who gets in your way!<br /><br /><br /><br />You are usually the best at everything ... you strive for perfection. <br /><br />You are confident, authoritative, and aggressive. <br /><br />You have the classic ""Type A"" personality.<br /><br /><br /><br />You are wild, crazy, and a huge rebel. You're always up to something.<br /><br />You have a ton of energy, and most people can't handle you. You're very intense.<br /><br />You definitely are a handful, and you're likely to get in trouble. But your kind of trouble is a lot of fun.<br /><br /><br /><br />You are deeply philosophical and thoughtful. You tend to analyze every aspect of your life.<br /><br />You are intuitive, brilliant, and quite introverted. You value your time alone.<br /><br />Often times, you are grumpy with other people. You don't appreciate them trying to interfere in your affairs.<br /><br /><br /><br />You are friendly, charming, and warm. You get along with almost everyone.<br /><br />You work hard not to rock the boat. Your easy going attitude brings people together.<br /><br />At times, you can be a little flaky and irresponsible. But for the important things, you pull it together.<br /><br /><br /><br />You are a seeker. You often find yourself restless - and you have a lot of questions about life.<br /><br />You tend to travel often, to fairly random locations. You're most comfortable when you're far away from home.<br /><br />You are quite passionate and easily tempted. Your impulses sometimes get you into trouble.<br /><br /><br /><br />You are a free spirit, and you resent anyone who tries to fence you in.<br /><br />You are unpredictable, adventurous, and always a little surprising.<br /><br />You may miss out by not settling down, but you're too busy having fun to care. <br /></font></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatsyournameshiddenmeaningquiz/"">What's Your Name's Hidden Meaning?</a></div>"

In five days, I came to terms with myself and got over a <u><em>load</em></u> of insecurities. In five days, I realized how loved I am. In five days, I found that I'm NOT worthless. In five days, I realized that there IS a purpose in life. In five days, I was able to say what I needed to say and do what I needed to do. And now that I'm back home,&nbsp;I have the strength to tie whatever loose ends are left in my life.<br /><br />I definitely found peace of mind at our cozy retreat house, and I found utter bliss in the 42 people (my classmates + Monica + Father Edwin + Sir Henry + Ms. Gcel + Ms. Yvette) I spent my last high school retreat with.

For you, chemistry doesn't really happen without compatibility.
Companionship and openness are the most important parts of your relationships.
Whoever you love should be your best friend. 
And falling in love with a good friend is never out of the question.

But anyway, thanks for being a great friend. I love you. :)<br />20. I MISS YOU GUYS SO MUCH. You made last summer the best I'll ever have. I love you.

And as an example, I mentioned the song ""Makita Kang Muli"" by Sugarfree. After downloading and listening to it last night, I realized just how powerful the lyrics are because they're in Filipino. There's just something about the language that's truly beautiful.

"event","<p>I can't believe 5 weeks have come and gone.

AJSS has made this the best summer ever. The friendship and the memories mean more to me than words can ever express. In AJSS, it didn't matter where one was from or how old one was. It didn't matter whether one was good in English, or good in Math, or good in Philosophy. One never felt the need to put on a mask. It's impossible to describe how AJSSers found a home in each other. There was just this inexplicable bond. We simply made each other feel special.</p><p>We had our graduation ceremony yesterday. The Escaler hall was pervaded with joy, as well as sadness and nostalgia. Though we were aware that it was our last day together, none of us wanted to go home. Amidst the excitement of receiving our certificates, watching the presentations we prepared, and having the after-grad dinner with our families, we all wished we could turn back time and live AJ all over again. Even at the afterparty at Chiara's ""guesthouse-lang-yan,"" our merrymaking was lined with depression and the knowledge that after that night, we would never have another chance to be together, all 72 of us, the same way we have been for the past five weeks.

As Evan said in his valedictory speech, all of us in AJSS allowed ourselves to be vulnerable. When we got close to one another, we knew we would eventually have to part ways. We opened our hearts to pain. But that didn't stop us from making memories that would stay in our hearts long after we resumed our everyday lives. </p><p>There are people whom I won't see in a very long time. There are people whom I may never see again. As much as this pains me, I'm beyond grateful for having had the chance to be with 71 extraordinary individuals. I found a home in AJSS. And though time will pass and people will drift apart, my memories of AJSS will remain.

To everyone in AJSS (including Sir Waxx),<strong>  thank you</strong>. You've changed my life in ways I never imagined. I'll miss you terribly.


<strong>""This isn't goodbye; this is 'see you later'.""
</strong>
<strong>""I love you, always. Time is nothing.""


<font size=""6"">AJSS 2007. <font size=""3"">All my love to you. &hearts;</font></font></strong></p>"

"event","<p>AJSS just keeps getting better. (:</p><p><u>Highlights of The Week<br /></u>1. <strong>Monday: the Math long test<br /></strong>Killer. We were given 10 problems to solve in 1 1/2 hours; I solved 5 and partially solved 2. -_-<br />2. <strong>Tuesday: Labor Day<br /></strong>No classes, baybeh! I wanted to go out, but our AJSS gimmick was postponed. And I was uber tired. So I stayed home, slept, pigged out, and bummed around. xD<br />3. <strong>Wednesday - Friday: Computer Camp<br /></strong>As nerdy as it sounds, computer camp was pretty fun. Not the programming part per se (I've realized that I do not have the patience for C++ programming), but working with my classmates, having weird and funny conversations (Meebo, anyone?), camwhoring,&nbsp;etc.&nbsp;Lunch periods were really fun, too. We found a new lunch place, the pavillion near the cafeteria. xD&nbsp;During&nbsp;Thursday's lunch period, I auditioned for and got the part of Conchitina&nbsp;for our English B play. xD&nbsp;<br />Oh, I have a&nbsp;new&nbsp;pick-up line: <em>Hi, I'm kutsinta. Will you be my puto? </em>( Evan's variation: <em>Hi, I'm puto. Will you be my dinuguan? </em>:)) )<br />4. <strong>Friday night: Stargazing<br /></strong>Okay, this was more of a bonding/bumming around session than a stargazing activity. :)) Our physics class stayed in the football field of Ateneo with Dr. Chan and Sir Waxx. This telescope was set up in the middle of the field; I looked through it and only saw one star. -_- Haha. Each physics group gave presentations on certain constellations (our group's: Virgo. <em>Like a virgin, touched for the very first time!</em>). The rest of the night was devoted to talking, eating, listening to senti/emo/Weird Al music, and telling ghost stories. :)) Fun fun. xD<br /><br />Next week, we go back to having normal classes. I have yet to do my English literary analysis, study for the Psych long test, and attend to other stuff.&nbsp;GAH.&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway, <strong><font size=""2"">I love AJSS! &lt;333</font></strong> Woot! (: I'm gonna make the most of&nbsp;the next three weeks! =P<br /><br /><strong>Sarah, Abbi, and Nikki: I MISS YOU. :'(</strong><br /><br />Anyway, time to get to work. Bye, friends! =P<br /></p>"

Oh, and there are girls AND boys [I'm still not used to a co-ed class]. :)) We spent the day having orientation and some quick tours, followed by a group dynamics session wherein we played some ice breakers and basically got to know each other better. I'm the oldest in the entire group [no surprise there; I'm always the oldest]. :)) Would you believe there are people who are <em>14 years old</em>?! Dayum! :O<br /><br />Today we went to class, met our teachers, and were oriented in each subject. I'm SO happy I got Physics/Psychology and Philosophy in ENGLISH. Wahaha. All the classes seem fun, but I think Math is going to be hell. Noooooo! ):<br /><br />I'm enjoying getting acquainted with my classmates. They're all interesting, fun,&nbsp;and very down to earth.

</u>10:15 am - Finished the Filipino test 30 minutes ahead of time. Ahaha
10:45 - G4 with Abs and Sarah [foodtrip, ""Because I Said So,"" shopping, foodtrip again :))]
6:00 pm - Went home and got ready for Synergy
9:00 pm - Met up with Abs, Sarah, and Nico at the Dasma pavillion

<strong>Synergy </strong>was such a gago and FUN party! Abby Mercs and Aina became my hot lesbo dancing partners. I asked Trish to make out with me [which she didn't do...DUH]. Oh, and I had like five minutes of total drama [I won't include the details]. :)) Nicholine, we miss you like hell, you tae. You better be at the next party with us. =)

<u>Saturday
</u>Omg, I actually worked out. For like, three hours, pare. =| I still have body pains. Haha. I went on a foodtrip and shopping trip in Greenhills right after I worked out. :))

<u>Sunday
</u>Two words: MOVIE MARATHON. I miss doing this so damn much: just bumming around, me and the tv. Haha


I'm super gonna crash people's houses this summer. Nikki, movie marathon at your house? ;P

You tend to be the rock in relationships - people depend on you.
Thoughtful and caring, you often put others needs first.
You aren't content to help those you know... you want to give to the world.
An idealist, you strive for positive change and dream about how much better things could be.

Your strength: Your intuition

Your weakness: You put yourself last

Leave a comment here and...
1. I'll respond with something random about you.
2. I'll tell you what song/movie reminds me of you.
3. I'll pick a flavor of jello to wrestle with you in.
4. I'll say something that only makes sense to you and me.
5. I'll tell you my first/clearest memory of you.
6. I'll tell you what animal you remind me of.
7. I'll ask you something that I've always wondered about you.
8. I'll tell you what I'd want to steal from you if I ever had to pick.
9. If I do this for you, post it in your journal too."

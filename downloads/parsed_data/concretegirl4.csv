"event","About me? 
Im Tara. 
I have a million nicknames. 
So feel free to call me what you want. 
As long as it's not mean.
I am Eighteen.
I was born on June, 1st 1986. 
Happy Birthday to me. 
Im getting old, and it sucks. 
I live in VLE.
That's in Vero Beach.
But everyone thinks it's in Sebastian. 
Because it's next to their highschool. 
But I swear it's Vero.  
I went from 732 to 772. 
I miss New Jersey. 
That's right, I'm a Jersey girl. 
I want to go to Full Sail. 
For recording arts, although I've been debating on film also. 
But I'll stick with Recording Arts. 
I love music. 
All kinds of music. 
I'll listen to anything once.
Except Gwen Stanfani.
I hate her.
Well, her music at least.
I love movies.
All kinds of movies.
Except porn.
But that's another story.
I work too. 
But im looking for another job. 
Why? cause i can do that. 
Im going to have like three jobs. 
Im a busy person. 
Which pisses people off. 
Sorry. 
I eat, alot. 
But I'm not a cow. 
I like to cook. 
But I usually don't have time.
Which sucks. 
Oh Well.
I love Italian food. 
I like pancakes. 
I like bagels.
It's hard to find good bagels in Florida.
It's hard to find really good pizza too. 
Now im hungry. 
But im always hungry, get used to it. 
I ramble on, if you didnt catch on. 
Im lazy, sometimes, if I have time. 
I love to sleep. 
Usually don't get to sleep a lot though. 
I hate waking up early. 
But surprisingly enough, I'm not a grumpy person in the morning. 
Im crazy. In a good way. 
Ask anyone. 
I blast my radio when i drive. 
With the windows down.
I sing in the car.
Unless there's other people.
Then I kind of just mumble.
I never know what to do. 
I'm usually very indecisive.
I dunno is my fav answer for everything. 
That also pisses everyone off. 
A lot.
But get used to it. 
I try my best. 
This is getting really long. 
I can type pretty darn fast.
I'm a dork.  
Thanks for reading. 
I appreciate it. 
If you read this far, and didn't want to jump out a window, leave some love.
Toodles.
-like I said, I'm a dork.-"

What does Love mean? 
A group of professional people posed this question to a group of 4 to 8 year-olds, ""What does love mean?"" 

The answers they got were broader and deeper than anyone could have imagined. See what you think: 

________________________________ 

""When my grandmother got arthritis, she couldn't bend over and paint her toenails anymore. 

So my grandfather does it for her all the time, even when his hands got arthritis too. That's love."" 

Rebecca- age 8 

________________________________ 

 

""When someone loves you, the way they say your name is different. 
You just know that your name is safe in their mouth."" 
Billy - age 4 

________________________________ 

""Love is when a girl puts on perfume and a boy puts on shaving cologne and they go out and smell each other."" 

Karl - age 5 

________________________________ 

""Love is when you go out to eat and give somebody most of your French fries without making them give you any of theirs."" 

Chrissy - age 6 

________________________________ 

""Love is what makes you smile when you're tired."" 
Tara - age 4 

________________________________ 

""Love is when my mommy makes coffee for my daddy and she takes a sip before giving it to him, to make sure the taste is OK."" 

Danny - age 7 

________________________________ 

""Love is when you kiss all the time. Then when you get tired of kissing, you still want to be together and you talk more. 

My Mommy and Daddy are like that. They look gross when they kiss"" 

Emily - age 8 

________________________________ 

""Love is what's in the room with you at Christmas if you stop opening presents and listen."" 

Bobby - age 7 (Wow!) 

________________________________ 

""If you want to learn to love better, you should start with a friend who you hate,"" 

Nikka - age 6 
(we need a few million more Nikka's on this planet) 

________________________________ 

""Love is when you tell a guy you like his shirt, then he wears it everyday."" 

Noelle - age 7 

________________________________ 

""Love is like a little old woman and a little old man who are still friends even after they know each other so well."" 

Tommy - age 6 

________________________________ 

""During my piano recital, I was on a stage and I was scared. I looked at all the people watching me and saw my daddy waving and smiling. 

He was the only one doing that. I wasn't scared anymore."" 
Cindy - age 8 

________________________________ 

""My mommy loves me more than anybody . 
You don't see anyone else kissing me to sleep at night."" 
Clare - age 6 

________________________________ 

""Love is when Mommy gives Daddy the best piece of chicken."" 
Elaine-age 5 

________________________________ 

""Love is when Mommy sees Daddy smelly and sweaty and still says he is handsomer than Robert Redford."" 

Chris - age 7 

________________________________ 

""Love is when your puppy licks your face even after you left him alone all day."" 

Mary Ann - age 4 

________________________________ 

""I know my older sister loves me because she gives me all her old clothes and has to go out and buy new ones."" 

Lauren - age 4 

________________________________ 

""When you love somebody, your eyelashes go up and down and little stars come out of you."" (what an image) 

Karen - age 7 

________________________________ 

""Love is when Mommy sees Daddy on the toilet and she doesn't think it's gross."" 

Mark - age 6 

________________________________ 

""You really shouldn't say 'I love you' unless you mean it. But if you mean it, you should say it a lot. People forget."" 

Jessica - age 8 

________________________________ 

And the final one-Author and lecturer Leo Buscaglia once talked about a contest he was asked to judge. The purpose of the contest was to find the most caring child. 

The winner was a four year old child whose next door neighbor was an elderly gentleman who had recently lost his wife. 

Upon seeing the man cry, the little boy went into the old gentleman's yard, climbed onto his lap, and just sat there. 

When his Mother asked what he had said to the neighbor, the little boy said, 

""Nothing, I just helped him cry""

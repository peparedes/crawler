<P><STRONG><FONT color=#9999ff>on saturday i went horse riding. its bad cos lowie has athritis and can hardly canter. so we're not going to be going into the mountains anymore and i cant do anymore galloping or jumping. and im not even allowed to canter much. so sharon is putting up posters offering to excersise ppl's horses for free, so we're waiting to see the response.</FONT></STRONG></P>

I had to read the map and it was all screwed up and I kept listening to my music and forgetting that I was supposed to be giving directions.

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#6633ff>And then I went to my appointment and couldn't go to see Cami's dancing with Ariel and Calley.

They tricked me, to make me run. Evil cows. Not Cami though, just Avz and Caz. Typical of Ariel to do that but CALLEY! I'm disappointed in you. Then we went to the bakery and Ariel paid for a&amp;nbsp; yummy bun for me to make it up...and then they made a shirt for me out of a plastic frickin bag and Avz paid me five cents to dance like a retard, home in it when she and Calley left.

"event","<P>Guys maybe, everyone's being a little harsh on eachother...last week&nbsp; there were some fights in our group. It was just a bad week, and things will get better so take care all of you.</P>
<P>Lucy, I hope you had a fun time at Head of the River, even though you didn't row. It's a pity&nbsp; you/she left our group...it's going to be strange... :(</P>
<P>Okay. I've got a Media assignment that has to be put on tape, so I might need all of your help during study and lunch and stuff. Claire came over for a sleepover and we got lots of work done on tape for her assignment, cos she doesn't have a tapey thing. We got Evan and Amy over to help us act out our Radio Drama's...we got Clare's done, and we attempted mine,&nbsp; but I think we can do better, so yeah, I'm gonna do it during Study, so Ariel and Louise and Lauren and Rainer...I'll need your help doing that. I also need the whole group at lunch time to make some ""Lunchtime noises"" and stuff. So yeah. Just to tell you.</P>
<P>I've also got this HPE assignment thats due in a week that I haven't even started...and that green booklet due in this Tuesday that I have to finish off...I'll do that later today and then I'll check all my answers with you Louise in HPE or whenever. Then I've also got that Maths&nbsp; test that I should start revising for. I should do those&nbsp; revision sheets too.</P>
<P>Before I had&nbsp; 6 assignments and a test coming up. Media, HPE, French, History, English, Duke of Ed. and the Maths test. Now I've only got 2 assignments and a Maths test coming up. </P>
<P>I really should practice that clarimanet...and&nbsp; tennis if fun. If you didn't know, I used to do tennis since like, year 1, and then I did it until year 4, when I broke my arm and I stopped playing for like, 6months, then started again. Then I quiet 2nd semester last year because I was really sick of it, then I started again this semester because I missed it so much. I'm going to try out for the sch<IMG src=""http://www.abc.net.au/news/olympics/graphics/gym-ball.jpg"">ool team next year...I wonder if I'm good enough... They're all really hardcore...Lauren's in the A's isn't she? And that Erica chick is in the Opens! Crap, she must be really really good. You guys&nbsp; have to for ce me to try out next year. I really regret not trying out this year.</P>
<P>Hmmm...I'm gonna listen too some music! When Clare came over, she brought her Coldplay album with her, so I'm gonna get Mum to burn it for me at work...oh and Clare asked me to burn her my Franz Ferdinand CD, so I said she didn't have to give me a CD cos it's the police's CD's and they can pay for it, smeh...Mum works for them and they're all friends so they won't care.</P>
<P>Cool, softball is coming up soon. I really hope I get in...I'll be upset if I don't get in...and if I do get in, I hope I get to play 1st Base again. That's my best position. In HPE we're doing softball, it's really great! I love it. I'm going to try and get an Excelling for it. I got advanced for Soccer. Soccer is boring...yuck...it's hard too... softball is so much better.</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://www.abc.net.au/news/olympics/graphics/gym-ball.jpg"">Last night I saw a Rythmic Gymnastics ball routine on the Olympics last night....wow! I wish I was half that good. They're really good. WOW! I had a really yummy pie on Friday at Lunch, it was so yummy. I might have another on Monday.</P>"

went riding yesterday and i rode wiggy. hes HUGE! 16.2hh! coolies. a bit crazy on the way home, but he was such a good ride most of the time. wiggy belongs to this person we met (sharon and i) on the way home once. she has two horses. wiggy and apollo. apollo is a grey 14hh. a little taller than lowie. hes even ""whiter than igor."" i didnt ride igor yesterday cos he was lame, so i rode wiggy, who is a chestnut. and at the end i untacked him, and rugged him and it was so great! it was like nearly having my own horse! wiggy's real name is bandit, but his nickname is wiggy cos u can always see the whites of his eyes. so he always looks scared, its funny. hes a great horse, but hes so damn stubborn sumtimes. he has this wierd thing with turn left (zoolander, lol). and i really have to use leg aids with him.like, really use them. with igor, it was a bit, but not as much as wiggy. its good for me, tho, ive been pretty slack with leg aids

i might ride him next week...if igors still lame.
sharon took sum photos, maybe ill post them here when i get them."

"event","i juz finished reading ariel's post on duke of ed. and i guess i shud write what happened on duke of ed.  b4 i 4get coz i have to write about it for the ppl who organise it all.

k well, i had already packed my stuff the nite b4 into a garbage bag stuff like sleeping bags and toiletries and stuff..i had to wake up and like...6am and had a 26  minute shower! YES PPL! 26 mins! then i had 2 cups of hot  milo and waited 4 ariel and her mum to come cozthey were picking me up and  we  drove to beaudesert (close to it) and stopped near it to take a rest. we played on the swings and ate yumm blueberry muffins and had hot victorian mochachocolate drinks (my last intake of sugar for 31 hours) 

then we kept driving and then there were lots of horsies everywhere! that was one of the best things...anyway then we got there (oh and it was like, a 2 hour trip) and waited for everyone else to get there. while we waited (ariel's mum left)  we played stupid crappy ""fun"" games like, catching ""smerfs"" and and tag and yeh. and then everyone else arrived and we packed our stuff into these huge hiking bags...and we had to carry ""fresh"" vegies, i carried onions and broccili.

we hiked for 1.5 hours with 5-10kg bags up a mountain, thru ""cobblers pegs"" and webs and  mud. ariel and i kept talking about how we would get a cow and hitch our packs to it then ride it to where ver we're going and ariel and i were WAY! in front of everyone else which is pretty sad coz we're like, not that fit. we walked past the high ropes courses and 100m away from there were stinky drop toilets and then 100m away from there were ""fancy"" (just a bit cleaner) drop toilets which were 300m away from camp and if we went to the toilet, we had to take a ""pee buddy"".it was really tiring but i guess worth it coz then we got to our ""area place"" which i will call BASE coz its easy to type. it wasnt fancy or anything...just a few logs around a fire hole thingo and table on a concrete surface with no walls with some cabinets with food. and then there (this was all in the bush on a mountain at a little clearing) was a pewny lil hut they called ..wait 4 it... 7 11!!!!! bcoz it had extra food if we ran out...

ariel and i were gonna be in the same tent as rosa and sophie blackhall (everyone was from bshs) and we were gonna set up when we realised we didnt have enough stuff 2 set our own tent up so we had to go with jane and sophia in yr 10 who were nice and let us be in their tent (us 4 were the only yr 9s, the rest were mostly 10 and a few yr 11s and 1 yr12). so we set up what we called a tent which was actually 2 tarps and 5 poles. then we were supposed to unpak but airel and i walked around a bit. we were split into groups to cook dinner and make lunch and cleanup and stuff. 

so sum ppl  made lunch while me and ariel sat and laughed at how much of a loner mr howard was...serious! he was juz walking around by himself..and then we pictured him as a kid...who has no friends and hangs around the popular group in an attempt to look cool lol, it was so funny. and then we ate the food  (sandwhiches, lettuce, beetroot, tomatoe, cheese, pineapple...stuff like that, u made ur own) and we left for the ropes course. 

we had to wear these red harnessess up high on our waists and it look ed so stupid, but everyone was wearign one, so it wasnt too bad. and there were 3 courses. 1=shit easy, 2=a lil scary, 3= didnt have time to do it, but looks scary. 1 was close to the ground but got higher in the middle then bak near the grond at the end, 2 was high the whole way...there were wooden bridges and rope bridges and the ""tunnel of love"" (nothing suss) and a rock climbing thingo...and more...it was kinda scary, but..actually, it wasnt that scary... it just hurt ur hands ALOT, coz u have to hold onto the wire, and if u slipped and fell, ud fall like...20m. no not really, when u wore the harness, u clip urself to the wire and ud just hang there if u fell. oh and there was a lwinging log one, that really hurt ur hands...it was long and painful. now i really wished i had done three!

i wanted to go on 3, then we a shopping trolley"" that wasnt really a trolley buut more like a cage, and everyything was like, 35m in the air...and i didnt have time to go on it...but i nkow i wouldve been freaked out...stupid dumbass unco ppl who just HAVE to go first and hold smart ppl like me and ariel up! it really pissed us off, we shud have gone first... it wouldve took us  5 mins to finish if it we didnt have to wait 4 ppl to get on and do it..god! frikking unco! ok...calm...

so we walked back past the stinky dunnies to base and i made dinner. ariel wasnt in the same group, but because shes such a loner, she helped. we pulled apart thawed beef and we made the pasta and we talked to david whose in my band and play a huge barry saxophone and is in yr 10 and is like....huge...6ft5 of somthing who was cooking beef on the same pov stove as us. we kept trying the pasta but most of the time it was gross and uncooked...we didnt even try the beef until the end. i poured some soy and honey into the beef pot. sum other ppl cooked the vegies on the fire. then we ate the food and told lame jokes and riddles while sum ppl tried to make a choc. cake and milo (mainly hot water with a bit of milo, but it satisfied me). the cake was ok, but really sticky...funny. oh and ariel and i shined our WHITE (go white) torch lights into david's eyes, while he shined his blue (pffft) into our, it was pretty fun. excpet, 4 the whole..tripping on tree stumps bit...i swear ariel, it had something against me...oh and also the cobbler's pegs thingos...everywhere i went i got shitloads of them on me!!! and ariel and i probly spent like, an hour altogether trying to get them off eachother

we had to go to bed at 10pm and be asleep by 10.30. david slept outside...dumbass.it was so cold. i slept on the opening of the tent. i didnt want to carry too much, so i slept on a towel, my sleeping bag and some clothes in my sleeping bag cover (pillow). really really really cold. and rosa kept damn complaining! if u have to spend more that 2hours with her, then its hell! god, can she frikin shutup! shes such a loser! SHE PISSES ME OFF! ok...calm...AND WHEN PPL WERE LIKE ""OK QUIET NOW"" AND EVERYONE IN OUR ""TENT"" WAS QUIET SHED START COMPLAINING ABOUT SUMTHING! IT WAS ALWAYS HER!!! im so glad she was on the other side of the tent (oh i t was rosa, sophie, jane, sophiA, ariel, then me. in that OReo-DER ok...calm...

then i was laying awake, just thinking  and trying to warm me hands, this thing ran past our tent! and i was like...HOLY SHIT! i rekon it was a koala...it was small...and the way it moved...i didnt say anything till morning cos i didnt want to scare anyone...

then at 3am sophie woke up and her and i went to the toilet in the cold and the toilets didnt smell to bad and when we came back everyone was up. i think we stirred our tent up who woke up david  who woke up his tent who woke  up everyone else. lol CHAIN REACTION! so then we went to sleep again at 3.30, well, our tent did, and it was still cold, but it got better...then at 4 sum1 yelled ""EVERYONE WAKE UP ITS 6! (we had to get up at 6, and her clock was 2 hours early!)...then ppl did wake up and they talked...it was still dark...but our tent went back 2 sleep. and then we got up at the REAL 6...and me and ariel sat there and didnt talk...just sat there in our nice warm rugs. and we packed up a few things like sleeping bags and stuff and went to the logs and sat around the fire mr howard had made. and we warmed up and then ppl made brekky which was toast and ""spc cheese and tomatoe"" spaghetti or toast and vegimite or jam or peanut butter, or cereal. and we also got more water-milo.

then we packed the tents up and left for the flying fox. it was 150m which is apperently the longest flying fox in the...southern hemisphere...or was it northern..oh, well , whichever one australia is in. on the way there (ariel, doesn't know this yet, but i bet she will soon) haiana was butting cob. pegs all over ariel's back. i was cracking up and she kept asking me what was funny and i ju st said that it was coz i had to spit my sugarfree gum out and she believed me. then she saw them and i pretended i didnt know, and i helped take them off. lol ariel :P 

we had to wait at the end of the fl. fox and bring other ppl in (when it was their turn) and pull them up to safety on the block (ariel and i hardly did anything, we let ""big dave"" do it). then it was ariel's turn to walk to the beginning and do it, and then it was mine, but bcos she had to wait 4 other ppl to do it, she wasnt that far ahead of  me so we could still talk. we hard to balance on logs and wire bridges and walk on a single piece of wire (we still wore harnesses attatched to wire above us, which we had to clip and unclip to go to different obstacles, like the high ropes courses) and then climb up a vertical ladder to the realy fl. fox thing, where haiana (hi-arna) the dude guide clipped me up and stuff and then i called out ""MAKE ME"" to everyone on the other side to tell them i was ready, and the others called back to tell me to go and i went! it was mad!...like, 50m off the ground...amazing! NOW I WISHED ID LOOKED DOWN! that wouldve bin cool to watch everything fly past/below me! then i got off and i was shaking. the actual fl. fox wasnt bad, it was the coming up to it, that scared me!

we walked backed to camp (screw that base thingo) and ppl made lunch. ariel and i further paid out mr howard...and then we ate sandwhiches again like the day b4. we cleaned up the camp (sewpt put away all the gear, proberly packed bags and got ready to leave. ariel and i juz mucked around and put cob. pegs on hai. fun. and then we left. 
we hiked right back near the parking place, but still were hidden by the bushes. we played stupid games like ariel said and made up lam-o stories about monkey eggs. i also got cob. pegs all over me again, bcos...i dunno y...they r attracted to me.

it was 3 when we got to the clearing where we would do the sugar gliding. ariel and i volunteered to be the ""huskies"" to run and pull sum1 in the air. it was funny, and then we did that, then ariel had a turn then i had a turn and i ran on the ground then i was in the air!the other activites were more fun, but it was still pretty cool. then we walked for 5  mins and arrived at the car park at 4.10pm. parents where there and we took a few group photos and then ariel and i left with my mum and sis. when we got in the car there was a women's day magazine mum must've bought and straight away ariel and i started reading it...we also went to macca's cos we were so hungry and there were heaps of other ppl there from duke of ed. 

b4 we ate food we had too wash our hands, and we marvelled at the clear water and then i screamed really loudly coz there was one of those auto hand-driers and bcoz i wasnt used to civilisation yet and loud noises, it blasted air and it scared me! lol! and then ariel and i ate and went high on coke and laughed at stupid things and went to the car to get ariel's camera to take pictures of hamburgers and ronald mcdonald who looked posessed! it was funny! and we were the lest duke of ed. ppl to leave and  we also scared this old couple...the kept giving us strange and dirty looks...actually, now, come to think of it our whole group of friends who sit at the cove at school gets that alot...lol... 

so we drove home and we told mum and sam what we did and then ariel and i laughed at stupid things and yeah...then we dropped ariel off and her mum and my mum talked about how stiky we were and weere mean to us and then we left for home and i sat on my book and read ""factor x"" from the sunday mail to see what the world had been up to for the approx. 37 hours i was gone. and i realised that the jokes are all lame...

Emma- I know I don't show it most of the time Emma, but I love you k? I feel like I can talk to you. I know I can actually. We haven't really done that much together, so we sooo have to go shopping sum time. And you can buy your bloody iced coffee and ill buy some gj iced chocolate (uggh, so long to write the word, chocolate.) with ICE! Can't beleive they didnt have ice that time. Anyway, I can talk to you, and I can always reason with you. Love you.

Fiona- Your so silly. I love going high with you too. Your crazy, and so smart. I love going shopping with you, coz I can trust your stlye, you have a great sense of fashion.

I love you all my dear friends. I am so privelaged to be your friend. And I count all 9 of you as my close freinds. But sumtimes I dont know about you. But, I would understand that, coz sumtimes I can be quiet. I usually only say things if theres a point to it and I keep things to myself. We all have to go riding together! It'll be so fun. I hope you can all come to my party. Coz if one of you dont, then it wont be a party w/o everyone there."

Dear Reader

Please find enclosed a section from the Magical Book of Fairy Types

The Tinsel-Tooth Fairy:

A very rare and unique breed, this fairy is well known for its large amount of tinsel decorations. It is sometimes mistaken for the Christmas Pixie, but not many people get the two confused any more, because the last time someone mixed them up, the TT Fairy Organisation got together and gang-bashed the stoopid retard idiot-head who said that. (They also had a few extra teeth after the incident).
The TT Fairy first originated in Brisbane when a girl had to go to her friend's PARTAY, so she caught two fairies, Tooth and Christmas. She stuck them in a box and 7 days later out pooped (?)the 1st TT Fairy. But then out pooped another TT Fairy. There was one male and one female (tt-twin fairies). The female was named Deni, and the male was named Dani. Fairies mature very quickly, so they grew up (1 day=13years) and Dani flew away, but Deni stayed with her creator...Dani made other TT Faeries, and created the TT Fairy Organisation. And Jenni borrowed Deni's body to go to her friends Fairy Party. It was hell-crazy. 

Yours Sincerely
Dani TT
Head of the TT Fairy Organistaion

Yeah...""I think I'm goin crazy"" (song from Black eyed peas, cant memba name). Yeah. Like ma essay? I really felt like writing sumthing....oh creativity is comin outta skin in fumes, and its swirly and pink and yellow...O_o   o_O <-----faces, eyes and mouth)"

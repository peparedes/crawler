"event","I don't know why, but today i got to really&nbsp;thinking about my first love. His name was Patrick and it was the ending of elementary school. I had liked him for a long time but was too shy to admit it. When I learned he was moving away, I finally told him how I felt through a short letter. I was always better at writing out my feelings then saying them.&nbsp;It was the most nerve wracking thing I had ever done. I avoided him up until the last few days of school. Then, on the very&nbsp;last day of school, I was waiting for my dad to pick me up when Patrick came up to me and told me&nbsp;he loved me too. He had for as long as I have and, like me, was too nervous to say anything. What shocked me was that he leaned in and quickly kissed me on the lips.&nbsp;My first kiss ever!&nbsp;It was so sweet and perfect for my first kiss. I was so happy that he felt the same way I did.&nbsp;But then I remembered we'd probably never see each other again. We hugged goodbye and I haven't a clue where he is now. I started thinking about him for the first time in a long time when I first started watching Heroes this year because Patrick actually looks like Peter! Freaky was my first thought. And when I watched the show and got to know the character, I realized Patrick also had Peter's personality. Broody,&nbsp;a dreamer, reclusive,&nbsp;cute as hell all describes Patrick as well as Peter.&nbsp;Double freaky! Anyway, it felt good to talk about my first love. Who knows, with how the universe works, maybe one day when we're grown up we'll run into each other and have a chance at a real romance.&nbsp;

"event","Another boring day. Of course then I realized I had just a month and half left of my summer vacation. And then, I'll be going back to school. Junior year. Yipee. Not very excited at all. They're changing everything at my school next year. Which means I'll have to basically start over. And the other bad thing is, my mom, dad, and even my teacher syacy asked me when I want to start driver's training. Now I know most all teenagers can't wait to get their licenses. I'm not one of them. I'm petrified of even the thought of getting behind the wheel of a car. And when i learned all the things you have to do just to get your permit, that just added to my fear. I know overcoming your fear is a good thing, but I'm a very reserved person and assertiveness does not come easy to me. May be I'll move to New York, no one ever drives there. Of course then I'll have to fly. another fear. But this one has a good reason. When I was seven or eight, my mom moved all the way to Florida and I had to fly there with my older sister to go see her over a school break. But I had to fly back alone because my mom and sister had an argument and my sister left early without me. It was terrifying being a little kid in a bid airport being handed off to stranger after stranger leading me to where I was supposed to go. I'm also afraid of bugs, especially flying nes like bees and wasps. They freak me out. If I see one, I run and scream in the other direction like a lunatic. Go ahead and laugh at me, I won't mind. Anywhoo, I guessed I've had my daily vent. Maybe next time it will be more pleasant."

"event","Ever since becoming a die hard Heroes fan, I've been constantly updating this playlist I have of songs that fit the show, well most of them for Peter and Claire, as a couple or individuals.<br /><br />Here it is.&nbsp;<br /><br />Tell me what you think...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Heroes Playlist by Amanda<br /><br />1. <em>Almost Here by Brian McFadden &amp; Delta Gooderm.<br /></em>Heard this on a YouTube video about Peter and Claire. Beautiful song<br />2.<em> Far Away by Nickelback<br /></em>Fell in love with the song and I thought it fit<br />3.<em>Wait For You by Elliot Yamin<br /></em>The man has a beauiful, sultry voice and it speaks of Paire<br />4.<em>It's Not Over by Daughty<br /></em>I love Chris, totally should have won AI. Not sure if this one fits but I love it so, there, take it or leave it<br />5.<em>Because You Live by Jesse McCartney<br /></em>Wrote a short fic using this song as inspiration, so I had to put it in<br />6.<em>Chemicals React by Aly &amp; AJ<br />Another YouTube viewing. It fits<br /></em>7.<em>Girlfriend by avril Lavigne<br /></em>Whenever I hear this, I get an image of Claire kicking Simone's ass and seducing Peter. I don't know, I guess I'm weird.<br />8.<em>Dirty Little Secret by The All American Rejects<br /></em>Thought about a secret Paire relationship<br />9.<em>Savin' Me by Nickelback<br /></em>This song = Paire!<br />10.<em> If Everyone Cared by Nickelback<br /></em>They used this song on one of Heroes' trailers, so now I can't hear it without thinking about the show.<br />11.<em> The Way You Make Me Feel by Michael Jackson<br /></em>Huh...I haven't a clue how that one got in there. Maybe the lyrics made me picture Paire. *shrugs*<br />12.<em> Colorful by Rocco DeLuca &amp; The Burden<br /></em>Recently fell in love with the song. I pictured it as Peter's thoughts about Claire<br />13.<em>Behind These Hazel Eyes by Kelly Clarkson<br />Youtube vid again. A Paire cheating break-up vid. Basked in the angst<br /></em>14. <em>Lips of an Angel by Hinder<br /></em>A Paire loved triangle with my archenemy Simone<br />15.<em>What's Left of Me by Nick Lachey<br /></em>Beautiful piece, Nick at his best. a peter-centered song, with minor Paire love<br />16.<em>Crush by Jennifer Paige<br /></em>I think I'm seriously YouTube addicted!<br />17.<em>Crashed by Daughtry<br />YouTube again, but this song I feel fits Paire the most ouy of all of them I've heard on there<br /></em>18.<em>Last Request by Paolo Nutini<br /></em>a fresh new talent from Scotland. I feel this, his most recent song, describes Paire and their never-dying love.&nbsp;<br />19.<em>Big Girls Don't Cry by Fergie<br /></em>I know, the only reson I first listened to this song was because Milo was in the music video. But I came to adore this song, so don't bad mouth Fergie<br />20.<em>Keep Holding On by Avril Lavigne<br /></em>Another song when you hear it, Paire pops into youe head<br />21.<em>Secert Lovers by Atlantic Starr<br /></em>Ancient song in my book. I found in while searching through my mom's CDs(I was really bored okay!) and it spoke Paire to me. and it's actually pretty catchy and beautiful.<br />22.<em>If You're Not the One by Daniel Bedingfield<br /></em>Beautiful voice, beautiful song, and so utterly Paire<br />23. <em>Way Back Into Love by Hugh Grant and Haley Bennet<br /></em>Favorite song off the Music and Lyrics soundtrack by far. Paire didn't cross my mind when I first heard it. Until, don't laugh. I saw a video done on YouTube using the song. Then, the rest is history.<br /><br /><br /><br />Well, that's it. i hope the few of you that see this like my choices. I might update if I find anymore songs. Also, if you know of a Paire song thta's not on my list and you believe it's worth listening to, please tell me."

I think Masi is the most adorable smart guy ever! And he plays Hiro with such an amazing aura. I mean come on people. think about it. If Hiro hand't been created, we never would have been given Paire.&nbsp;

I love you Hiro!

"event","Because of my straight A's on my report card all year long, my stepdad got me a cool speaker system for my iPod. He's really into all that techno stuff that involves blasting his hip-hop /rap music he loves so much. But now I'm able to fight back and blast my music as well! It even came with a nifty remote so I can adjust the volume and change songs. It's so lame to be excited about this but hey, it's my journal afterall.

Um... other than that not much to report I guess.&nbsp; I was thinking about writing another fic about Claire replacing Peter's girlfriend again. This time it would follow the 'Five Years Gone' plot. Meaning it would start with Future Hiro and Past Ando going to Las Vegas for Peter and end up at a strip club where peter's girlfriend aka Claire works. she'll definitely be a darker Claire, just like Peter. And I'll explain why their not uncle and niece in the fic. i'll probably post the idea on Paire Love to get the dialongue of Peter and Niki and a couple other scenes and also to see what people think.

Anywhoo... This is TrueNughtingale signing out. :)"

But I doubt Paire will ever happen for real. But then again, anything's possible. Heroes is in desparate need of new writers. Writers who are Paire fans."

"event","i can't believe what I just real somewhere. In season 2 of Heroes, Claire's getting a boyfriend, no suprise there. and he kinda looks like Peter, but not as hot and broody. But that's not the infuriating part. The actor playing him is, get this, 27 years old! *screams at the tops of lungs*! And Kring was always making the excuse of Peter being too old for Claire because Milo's 29? Unbelieveable! This seroiusly sucks. are they going to dangle the idea of Paire forever before we hear those magical words,&nbsp;<br />""<em>Claire, I'm not your uncle.""<br />""Really? How awesome is that?! Wanna make out?""<br />""Thought you'd never ask.""<br /><br /></em>But I guess as long as Kring is in charge, that episode will never come.<br /><br /><strong>DIE KRING!<br /></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Okay. That was good, venting is always good."

"event","Like I said, a huge fan of the PeterClaire relationship on NBC's Heroes. I became addicted to them and the show right before its hiatus period earlier in the year. When I discovered they were related, I was like what the Hell? I mean seroiusly! Does the stupid creator realize what he's done?! I'm just praying like many other Paire shippers that it&nbsp; comes out that they're not related. I mean two people who have that much chemistry and not to metion eye sex cannot be related. I have to also say I was kinda let done with the season finale, what about you guys? I realize all finales end with a bunch of what-ifs, but this ended for me with a lot of Huhs? But I guess we're just are going to have to wait til the end of the year for season 2. But that's another thing, I heard that season 2 goes backwards to explore the many Heroes families. Who cares?! I want more Paire since we were deprived except a couple episodes. Guess my ranting is done. Til next time!"

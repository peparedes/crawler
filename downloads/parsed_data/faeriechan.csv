That's kind of cool. Don't know what I'll be doing when she gets back. Hopefully I'll be able to move up to the nesxt stage. I am really looking forward to start an actual career in the resteraunt business.

Jenna is 8 months old in six days! I can't believe how fast time is flying. I couldn't ask for a better baby. She is always happy and playful, we hardly ever have a problem with her unless she is teething that day. She's sitting up on her own and SO close to crawling. Time to baby proof our house!

My new roommate is awesome. We're getting along great. We have done a lot of work on our house and it's looking fantastic. I think that this will be a long term thing and I""m looking forward to it.

My car is STILL in the shop. I really regret buying it now. But I'm going to have a practically new car when I get it back because of all the work I've had done on it. But this shop is horrible and if it's not right this time I want to sue. It's been over two months and they still don't have my car done!

The whole Jared thing is starting to calm down. His stuff is gone and I haven't heard from him. I am so relieved to have him out of my life. Now I just need to get the ball rolling on the whole child support and sole legal custody. And I need to figure out how to change Jenna's last name. 

So, that's the update on my life for now. Sorry to keep most of you in the dark for so long!"

"event","So, Jared is gone. Long gone. Goodbye. It's a shame that I will have to see you again, since we share a daughter. You have made me miserable long enough, I won't let you make our daughter miserable too.

So now I'm in this $985/month house, with a car payment, three credit cards, comcast, verizon, electricity, water, insurance..omg, it seems like the bills just keeping going on and on. I make really good money, but it's going to be a tight squeeze, and just one day off will hurt. I just did my finances and I have a little more than I thought I did, so woohoo!

oh! and I'm getting a roommate! her name is kayley. she's awesome. and pregnant. I think we are going to do well. I'm going to DSHS with her tomorrow and we're both going to get foodstamps. And hopefully I can get some money for childsupport since Jared isn't working. I can also get money for childcare! 

Oh, and my mom told me that my grandparents might be sending me some money, since they just sent Skyler and Shasta some money. Plus the rebate from Bush. And I should be getting my deposit back from the duplex soon too! Financially, I think I'll be just fine.

Still stressed about my car though. I guess there is a blown head gasket, and the insurance company wants to total it out. My only hope is that my powertrain warranty will cover it. Crossing my heart. I blame Jared for driving my car the way he did.

I am free and excited to move on with my life."

Work is going great! I am training for management. I really hope to get an assistant manager position within the next two years..and then manage my own denny's within the next five years. 

Jenna is getting so big! She'll be six months old next week! She's starting to get her first teeth, so she drools everywhere. She's such a happy baby though. Always smiling and playing. She hardly ever fusses.

Not really sure what else to say...Hopefully I'll be on the council for bethel 30 next term. Don't know when I will find out...Kind of nerovus about it. 

Um..that's pretty much all I have..."

"event","So, my beautiful baby was born Oct. 11th and 5:44 AM. It ended up being a C-section. When I arrived Tuesday morning, I took Cytotec orally, and that afternoon they had me take it again vaginally, they also gave me a folley ball which was extremely painful. That night they started the Pitocen but nothing was happening so they stopped it and gave me a shot of morphine to help me sleep.  Wednesday morning they started up the pitocen again, and that afternoon they broke my water. After they broke my water things got really painful so they started the epidural. Wednesday night my epidural stopped working, so they tried just giving me a big dose again, but it still didn't work. They ended up taking it out and giving me a new one. After that happened I started throwing up and shaking uncontrollably, for the next two hours my temperature kept rising, and my cervix had my dialated to a six for like ten hours now, and the baby just wouldn't drop. So they decided to do the c-section. It was so incredibly painful, they knocked me out as soon as her umbilical cord was cut. 

We were in the hospital until monday! that's 6 days! The recovery is so so so painful, tiring and hard. Not to mention that my emotions are so out of control. I take so many pills now I feel like an AIDS patient. 

It is all worth it though. My daughter is SO beautiful. I will hopefully have pictures soon."

The induction could take up to three days in some cases, and I'm hoping that won't happen for us. It would be great if I could just give birth tomorrow...OMG! I'm going to have a baby! It seems so surreal...I can't imagine what it's going to be like. 

Anyone wishing to stop by is more than welcome to. Can't guarantee I'll be in the best of moods, but who knows, I've been surprisingly upbeat during my whole pregnancy. Not the emotional wreck of a woman you see on tv all the time. 

I'm excited to have my mobility back...to be able to bend down and roll over without so much effort. not to have my belly bumping into things all the time...but still...a BABY!"

So Kim was showing me all the remodeling that her parents had done to the house (I know they really have done some in real life) and Katie and Sally came knocking on the door! It was really cool to have them all in one place to hang out, I was still preggo so they got to see my belly and stuff...and then Kirbey showed up! At first I tried to hide from her but then we talked and made up and everything...That's when I woke up cause I had to pee...but it was a weird dream..."

"event","So. I HATE being pregnant right now. I want this stupid baby out of me. She kicks so hard it hurts, I'm tired, I can't get comfortable, my back hurts, I have to pee all the time, my head is killing me, and I hate taking insulin.  The baby room is all set up and I feel pretty prepared for her to come, so now it's just this waiting game...

So the trip to the hospital and the two days of worrying was for nothing because Jenna decided to roll over on her own, so she's head down again. Hopefully she stays that way.

In other news, I went to the jobie meeting the other night, and it was absolutely heartbreaking. There were two girls. They only did a round table, because there wasn't a daughter to lead the meeting. This is Leanndra's last year as guardian, we will have a new one in May...I hope the bethel can hold out that long, and that it's not too late to be saved.  Heather resigned and no longer attends, and I don't blame her. Cause everytime something went wrong the finger was pointed at her...NO it's not her fault that the guardian never sends in paperwork on time, it's not her fault that she is met with 'no' everytime she attempted to do anything.

I want bethel 30 to survive, and I feel horrible for not being able to help out more. Even now, I can't volunteer to do anything right now, because I never know when I'll be going into labor...but I really am planning on doing as much as I can when Jenna gets here. 

Jared is working at TGIFridays, and seems to like it. He has been helping out by washing dishes this week, but he starts his real job on tuesday I think. He'll be a line cook again, which is fantastic, cause he really loved cooking at VI. I hate just sittting around the house all day long..he does everything. cooks, cleans, works. 

I'm going to go lay down...my head hurts soooo bad all the letters I'm typing are all fuzzy..."

"event","So. Jenna (my baby) has been in position for about a month and a half down, head down and ready to come out...but for some reason, during this past week, she's decided that's uncomfortable and has turned over, so she's now breached. GR! So, on saturday I go in to the hospital for an aversion, which means they are going to push on my belly a whole bunch to try to get her back into the right position. It's really nerve racking cause there are quite a few complications that could happen...pre-term labor, umbilical cord could tangle, placenta could break away...But if I don't try it's an automatic scheduled c-section...so it's worth a try, I suppose....cross your fingers and hope that all goes well!"

"event","So. Life is crazy hectic and emotional. But what else can you expect?  I am officially nine months pregnant today, according to the doctors.  So Jenna will be here soon. It's nerve racking, cause I don't feel ready. We still don't have a mattress for the crib!!! 

I stopped working finally, and it is such a relief. I was so exhausted, it was just getting too hard. Jared is job hunting like crazy and we're crossing our fingers that he'll find something soon. We're going to try to move to Puyallup, cause Auburn just isn't working out.  Our duplex, as much as I loved it, is simply too much hassle. We've had ants the entire time we've lived here, and now we think there might be termites in the floor. The fridge leaks, the dishwasher door is broken, one of the stove top burners doesn't work, and there is NO insulation in the walls! NONE! We will freeze our butts off in the winter! 

We packed our bags for the hospital and are hoping she'll stay in until we find a place to live. Although I can't wait to get her out of me. I feel like I'm on my period right now, and my back hurts SO bad. I'm always tired, but my sleep is so restless...

Anyways, I think we're going to head down to Puyallup to do some hunting now.

What have I been up to? Not much..

THIS TIME NEXT WEEK I'LL BE AT WESTPORT! It can't come at a more perfect time, I'm super psyched. I look forward to Westport all year long.

I really like working at Denny's. I'm training to be a server right now, which means more money! woohoo! Even though I'm going to have to quit in about a month, I want them to train me so I can say I have waitressing experience. lol.

Jobie Installation is tomorrow. I'm Mistress of Ceremonies, so I have to look all pretty. It's hard to think that this might be my last installation for a really long time...who knows when I'll be back to see another one...

My dad is in china again. for three weeks this time. he'll be gone for my birthday..and when I pointed it out, he said, ""so?""...so...it's my birthday...whatever. I'm so over getting hurt by the things he says to me.

I mowed the lawn today. go me ^_^. 

testing my blood sugar hurt a lot at first, but doesn't so much anymore...and I have a much better understanding of my diabetes now...I have to make an appointment with the pediatrist soon, to get my feet checked before i moved...I also need to go get my eyes checked too. Then I just have two check ups..1 with my regular physician and 1 with my diabetes educator and I'll be done and ready to move.

Not sure what else to say...so i'm probably going to head home now."

I am bloated, my period is late, so I don't really feel like trying on a bunch of clothes. But my grandma wanted to go shopping. I told her that I really didn't want to go today (we had gone yesterday and the day before that too, because that's all she ever does). She was livid, of course. when she was leaving she asked again if I would go, and I said ""I love you grandma, but I really really really do not want to go shopping."" So she stormed off saying ""You don't love me!""

ugh. it's very draining. it's so hard to sit there and listen to her talk about how miserable she is all day long. How lonely she is, because her daughter and husband died. 

I found this huge jar of pennies in her attic. Turns out they belonged to my aunt amy before she died (almost 18 years ago). So I wrapped all the pennies...it over 55 dollars of pennies! My grandma is giving me half of that money...I'm going to use it to party with. lol. My Aunt Amy was a big partier. My grandma said she lived 'hard and fast' because she knew she was going to die young...she was 21 when she died...

"event","So recently, I made a small comment on a friend's journal about how it's bad to feed ducks. Unfortunately, I seem to have upset some people, which happens quite often. I think perhaps I did not articulate myself enough...so here is why you should not feed ducks.

Ducks beg for our attention and our food, which makes them hard to resist. It's great fun watching them gorge themselves on our leftovers, but the fact is, feeding ducks anything destroys their health and creates serious health risks to humans. Once they get a taste for junk food they stop eating the healthy natural foods in their environment.

The colorful Mallards and other wild ducks you see on many lakes and ponds have bodies that allow them to fly. They are physically designed to eat natural foods growing in their environment to stay healthy and light for flight. Sometimes a specially formulated duck food is provided to them, but only under strict supervision of park officials, when wild ducks are in a man-made setting or natural foods are not available. When wild ducks are fed human foods their organs become engorged and fatty on the inside and they quickly die from malnutrition, heart disease, liver problems and other health complications. An overfed, malnutritioned duck is sluggish and can't escape from predators. Feeding wild ducks adversely affects natural migration patterns, which are critical for their ongoing survival. 

From another source:

Ducks and geese normally eat seeds, roots, shoots of sedge, grass and aquatic plants such as millefoil and algae. Their digestive tracts aren't able to handle bread well. When the birds eat dry bread, it swells into an indigestible doughy mass in the stomach that can cause blockage and prevents the bird from absorbing nutrients. Sometimes the bread actually gets stuck in their throat making it impossible for them to swallow.

When ducks and geese (in fact, any bird) are given bread, large numbers of them repeatedly gather in the same place. The unnatural concentration of food and feces (poop) enables disease and illness to spread through large bird populations quickly. Also, bread that is left on the ground can pollute water and cause bacteria to grow possibly causing infections in these birds.

And another source:

Many health hazards can result from feeding migratory and domestic waterfowl such as ducks, geese and swans, and many municipalities have bans in place. The goal of this type of legislation is to prevent accumulation of droppings that may result in damage to flora, fauna and property, harm water quality, increase potential to spread disease or create a nuisance. Another goal is to protect the welfare of the birds themselves, as wildlife studies have shown that feeding waterfowl and migratory birds can interrupt their normal migration patterns, cause nutritional problems, and promote the spread of bird diseases. Regulations prohibit feeding waterfowl, as well as creating a condition which results in a congregation or congestion of waterfowl. Some legislation grants enforcement agencies the authority to disperse flocks by scare tactics or noise tactics.


So there. I'm not being selfish, fuck all of you for thinking that...as tasha said I'm ""bad for the environment. You with you car and your lattes in the morning, and your stupid big ass house that's probably sitting where a rabbit's den was."" It's bad for the DUCKS. You know, how you're supposed to cut holes in the plastic rings on coke, and crush cans so animals don't get stuck in it? You know how you should properly dispose of needles, rubber gloves, and popped balloons so that they don't hurt animals? It's the same fucking thing. Human food is harmful to ducks. We fill our bodies with all these preservatives and chemicals, why do we need to give all that to the animals too?"

Saturday I left for idaho. My dad told me my flight left at 2:50...so I get to his house a little after 12 and he's printing off my itinerary and goes ""Oh no! Your flight leaves at 1:40!"" so we get at the airport at 1:15, so I had to rush through to catch my plain. It was crazy, but I made it.

I have to leave in a few minutes to go with my Grandma to meet my Cousins (Ginger and Megan) for dinner. I haven't seen either of them for over three years, so I'm excited to see them.

Idaho is boring. My grandparents are insane. lol. They don't like to talk about things...like religion and politics and stuff...so we just sort of sit around and read...which is nice. I finished New Spring, and now I""m reading Crossroads of Twilight by the same author. Robert Jordan rocks my socks.

Skyler is driving me crazy as well. He never puts anything away. I go to the kitchen and the fridge door is open and milk and eggs are on the counter. I walk down the hall and he's taken the clean clothes out of the dryer and stern them all over the floor...

my schedule is way off...I don't wake up until 1 or 2pm, and I don't go to sleep until about 4 or 5am. I haven't gone to any shows lately, and haven't been listening to hardly any music, and I think that might have something to do with why I am getting so irritable.

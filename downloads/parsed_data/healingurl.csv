sitting in womyn circle
all fullness and ease
my feet grow roots
like those of 
hundred year old trees



newness of it all
striking in familiarity
not new then but old
trusted
tried and true
i see roots deeper
redder
whiter
greyer
crashing through floors and celings deep
anchor
anchor
commonality
banality
i am spitting it out now

mud mouth
locked
what happened?
where was i?
slipping around in dream world worked up but disconnected
not really there
dreaming
painting my nails
fear dropping in
for chats
and meditation"

and all the words that came to me in the early a.m.
swirling around in my head
the imagery
the meaning
the significance was it a dream
did it sound better then
was it a little gift

i knew that i could be there
so yes it was a gift

no one tells roots to grow
they do
they just do
like babies just know
they know before they don't anymore
we once knew too

thundering up through
stomping feet
bretahing
in through toes
outstretched then somehow
looked to the ground with roots white with no sunlight
and fragile to the gardener's claw
no gardening today
darker
deeper
stronger pink
like baby fresh baby roots

o glory glory
grace and glory
the chant becomes 
o yes
i can be here
i am here
thindering through
feet like inhales
in breath coming
from feet
in a most grounding way
i take my place
stake my claim

why does this feel like a new day

why do the clours i see in my minds eye match the paper this is written on



where did the nice imagery go

rounding chain
circles
circleness
circle shape
roundness
inside
outside
purity
lazy day in blue hammock drenched
in sunlight love
energy
peacefulness
stretching inward
outward

feet finding footing
fullness and ripeness
swollen aching

i have returned
this is when i am most alive
this is when i am most alove"

I keep thinking
mistakenly
that what I extended
to you 
offered 
and gave you
was love
unconditional

I overlooked so much
willingly
not always comfortably
but with extreme loyalty

I ignored my inner self for you
I ignored my truth for you

the only thing i can do
i look into your eyes
we look the same

more

or you: my lover
or you: my mother

i wish you were my mother

even our eyes
especially our eyes
match
our hands
i bite my nails
you are manicured
but when i am through 
the nail biting will have been replaced
with the ability to live right then and there
to sit it out and ask what is this all about
ask for guidance
and a willingness to sit still and see it through
take the messages from it and see it for the divine moment
that it is

heavy with meaning

all guidance... i hear you say that even now... all guidance
in that grounded voice of yours

your skin is so soft
your silver rings perfect
follow your arms up
the sun on you
you drink the sun soak in it revel in it welcome it
i know this about you
you are dressed in purple
i want to think you are dressed this way for me
and this becomes love poetry

i learned something about love
unconditional love
i brought it home
put it on the table
sipped tea with it just sitting there
made a cup for her 
and when she reveals unconditional love for me
seeing it sitting there on the table triggers her feelings
and she goes into the shades of defining it
i get prickly sometimes
and scared sometimes
and quiet and calm
i look at my fingers
think of the grace in your hands
oh what an anchor to hold hands with you
breathe into it
grace
and open up
i open up
best I could
and love

see the grace in her body
and the serenity of wishes granted 
in my home"

why did you hear me russian
why did you apply and re-apply meaning

translucent

angelic
prized for her spelling bee ways
vocabulary beyond compare
that i lost over a series of days
non-linear
not one after the other
more like dots on several calendars stretching
over many years
starting very little
with me listening not just with my ears
me listening with all my cells
all my cells so that it isn't as easy as erasing/ignoring/talking down/re-framing the words 
words are only 1/4

your body language
your eyes

your shoves

I worry how apparent that is to you
of all people

stuck in memory

tell myself the point is 
to not worry how apparent that is to you
of all people

I struggle-stumble
so much
especially lately

I blame it on what I don't have
and/or what I didn't have
blame stops me 
from seeing what I do have
why would I let blame 
play that big of a role
it seems deliberate
it seems like a secret
it makes my jaw ache

you said that
stumbling and struggling
is okay
do you know any healers who don't struggle-stumble
they do
they just do
and maybe they have to
and even if they don't have to
think of the lightness that comes
out of reckoning that within yourself
the value of the struggle
it isn't a have to
it just is
that is the point
if you are not struggling-stumbling
then you are not addressing
your own suffering
if you are not struggling-stumbling
then you are not aware and living in that mindful place
don't fight yourself on this one
give in to it
give into the process

<i>i write your words out like they are epic poems</i>

you called me a healer and i cannot acknowledge that except in private words clicked out on a cold sunny day
no reader
no reader
no audience
no audience
shush now

when will it be spring?
i crave every time and state that is not this state and time

i have superimposed someone elses face over yours and your voice is interpreted as someone else's
and the left over intentions
pick at me and reveal in voices
do you need to know that

do you need to know that sometimes I think I love you; sometimes I crave you; sometimes I want to be with you; be you; be in you; sometimes i want you to say how special I am
I need that acknowledgement from you
I feel like a teen, you know
Is that part of the process
Is this the healing
Is this why I can't really know you

i am good at seeing
i can see it all in my head
assign images
and colours 
to moods 
and feelings

oh-heavyweightness-press-down-on-me-unbearably

and all you are doing
is playing along
maybe tagging along
though your role 
is more active than that

sometimes i see you as someone who saves
someone who ends suffering
someone who loves

and sometimes i feel so mad at you 
for no good reason except that
you point out what i don't want to hear
i have a hard time
listening
to the hard stuff
which seems so unlike me
maybe
me the woman who prid<i>ed</i> herself - oh why is everything so past tense or future tense and not now tense?
the woman who prided herself on faithfulness and fearlessness
who no longer prides herself on those things- is that the implication?

I need: 
a lullaby
an extra day
a name for my faith so I can call it in
more practice
a cup of tea
to give myself what I want from you
to give myself what I want from all
my voice
to surrender to knowing nothing

I need my voice back"

It happens all at once or just doesn't happen in a single line.

Events always pick up where they leave off in this/last/next life.  The faces change and mark the time.

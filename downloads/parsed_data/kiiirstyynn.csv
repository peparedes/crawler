"event","Hot afternoons, we'd climb onto the neighbors house. 
Breathed deep and jumped into a waiting sky. 
Our bare feet were framed on the horizon. 
I felt the future in your eyes. 
It was the promise of summer. 
We'll seal it with a kiss. 
This time I'll do things proper. 
How did it get to this? 
Dear you, tonight let's get ahead of ourselves, 
Past now, I barely can remember. 
Yesterday stretched on for so long. 
Tomorrow feels like forever. 
My God, you know how much I needed this. 
These days are filled with such disaster. 
Sometimes I think that life will never be the same. 
Sometimes I think that's the answer. 
And she said, here comes the promise of summer. 
Let's seal it with a kiss. 
This time I'll do things proper. 
How did we get to this?"

"event","Something of a canon dump here. I've been taking notes as I replay ToA. It's SLOW GOING partly because I don't get much time to play, and partly because when I do play it takes forever. So far I've only done four of these. However they are long and have a lot of random little facts about charactets, the world, plots and events. This is mostly for my own reference because ToA is VERY LONG and it's hard to remember exactly how various things go, and it's useful to be able to revisit scenes and remember what a character did or thought at the time.

When I first started taking these notes I tended to summarize information and extrapolate from it. As I continued on I spent more time simply scripting events and then commenting on it. This way I can revisit the original writing for character voice as well as further debate as to what this means, or what that indicated etc.

Notes are in chronological order. Taken as I play the game. It contains spoilers for the ENTIRE GAME right from the beginning, as it has a lot of my thoughts on characters are different from the start than at the end, as well as various foreshadowing. So! Don't read them if you haven't beat the game.

That said, I thought they might be helpful for people who have played the game and are thinking about apping, or people in my canon, and not to mention an easy reference for myself.

Just general ""HERE IS HOW TO DO REALLY COOL MECHANICAL THINGS"" details. There's also a section for how to connect it to TEH LABS for escape routes, and random stupid shit, like having the mote connect to the lake so INTRUDERS can be flushed out to be dealt with by Marcy.

"event","Van/Luke ship essay thing.

<lj-cut text=""WHY DO SORA AND I HAVE THE WORST AUS EVER"">

There's no actual sex in that AU yet, but FRANKLY THAT'S IRRELEVANT. The fact that we're willing to do this at all makes us terrible. Horrible. Wrong people.

I have a friend who haaaaaaaaaaaaaaates Van/Luke and Van/Asch. It's a reasonably popular ship in the fandon, judging by the amounts of sickeningly adorable fanart I have for it. I understand her hate, though. Because it's often represented as. Well. Cute. And fluffy and full of love.

And if you played that game and left it thinking that Van and Luke have (or have ever had) a cute and fluffy love. Well. That's just sort of painful.

FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T PLAYED THE GAME AND DON'T CARE ABOUT SPOILERS, LET ME TELL YOU THE THINGS VAN DID TO LUKE

Well. actually we have to start with Asch to get HOW TERRIBLE VAN REALLY IS in proper order here:

What Van Did to Original Luke (Asch):
-Acted as his beloved mentor, inspired and taught him. 
-Was a surrogate father, because Duke Fabre fails
-Encouraged him to be an awesome leader, a fact that he became mildly obsessed with
-Kidnapped him! Took him to a DIFFERENT CONTINENT.
-Put him in a cage, created a replica of him (basically torture).
-Allowed him to FIGHT HIS WAY back to his homeland.
-Only to let him see when he arrived that he'd been REPLACED by everyone he loved.
-Acted as comforting mentor again. Trained him with the intention of using him to kill everyone in the world.
-And then there's the GAME PLOT (mostly, see Luke's)

LUKE ARRIVES MIDWAY THROUGH THIS. SO NOW WE HAVE

What Van Did to Replica Luke:
-Created him
-Acted as a beloved mentor and surrogate father. 
-Basically lied to him for seven straight years, encouraged his infatuation, and garnered his love to the point where Luke could legitimately be considered KIND OF OBSESSED with maintaining Van's opinion of him.
-It is seriously not out of line to call this brainwashing.
-Filled his mind with HOPES AND DREAMS of being a hero, escaping the jailcell of his life, and running away with him.
-All for the purpose of having Luke destroy an entire town, and die in the process, in place of Asch.
-Hyponotised Luke, so he would release his VASTLY POWERFUL ATTACK to destroy an entire town.
-The TRIGGER WORDS for this were ""Foolish Replica Luke""
-Proceeded to call Luke a useless tool, useless because he didn't even die when he was supposed to
-And basically proceeds to NOT GIVE A SHIT about Luke for the rest of the game.
-Except for when he tries to kill him several times.
-Works very hard at and nearly DESTROYS ALL OF HUMANITY
-Yet, despite his intentions to replace all of humanity replicas. Clearly doesn't believe they are actually human (Luke included).
-Doesn't acknowledge Luke as a human, free-will filled individual until Luke CLIMBS OVER A METAPHORICAL MOUNTAIN OF CORPSES TO REACH HIM.
-And proceeds with the attempted apocalypse, eventually forcing Luke to kill Van himself.
-Also, both Luke and Asch die by the end of the game, which can ultimately be tied down as Van's fault too. (Though, arguably, if not for Van, Asch would have died EARLIER and Luke would have never existed).

SO. That's something of a LAUNDRY LIST of shitty things to do to a boy who is basically seven years old.

Luke still loves Van.

This is... key to the plot. It NEVER stops. It changes! Luke is smart. He very  much does see Van for what he is. Perhaps more clearly than a lot of people might, because waaaaaaaaaaaay deep down inside, Van is a good person. He's also crazy, obsessed, and borderline sociopathic. But Luke's aware of all of this, not to mention all the HORRIBLE THINGS Van did to him, and he still loves him. He still wants his approval, his happiness, his attention.

THIS IS WHY I SAY it's not out of line to say Luke's kinda brainwashed. 

But he... knows he shouldn't be, accepts it. He WOULD kill Van again if it came to that. But he doesn't think it will. He also knows Van DOESN'T care about him, and that... hurts. But he's not crying about it and he basically accepts that... he can't hate Van just because Van never loved him. Van is still strong, brilliant, wise, all around incredible, and was the most important and most influential factor in Luke's life for... pretty much his entire life.

The ironic part of their relationship, is that by game's end, Luke is more or less physically as powerful as Van is. Van's still A BOSS. But then again, he was being souped up by Lorelei at the time. You beat Van at his regular power levels midway through the game, so it's not out of line to assume Luke could take him one-on-one by now. 

Luke knows this! He's a very <i>very</i> humble guy in a lot of ways by now, so he doesn't really DO anything with the knowledge that he could beat Van if he had to, just takes some confidence from it. But since they aren't fighting, that info isn't really useful, and in JUST ABOUT EVERY OTHER WAY Van continues to be his superior, and Luke acts like it.

It's... not that Luke is submissive. He's very much firm on the things he thinks he needs to be firm about. Things like NOT KILLING PEOPLE, that he is human, that we all have our own choices in life. He just... don't feel the need to be firm on all of the other stuff, mostly because he's not critically aware of all of his weaknesses and failings. And for all Van is FULL OF FAILINGS he's pretty much awesome at everything that isn't tainted by his convoluted view on destiny.

What I'm SAYING here, is that Luke will do just about anything Van asks of him, and at least consider anything Van tells him. Which sounds all very reasonable from Luke's point of view. But uh. When you line it up against EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED the fact that Van still has that much influence over him is REALLY KIND OF UNSETTLING.

Which leads into why them in ANY SORT OF SEXUAL SITUATION is incredibly wrong. Luke's a virgin! AND EIGHT YEAR OLD ONE. Van is and always will be his hero, albeit his fallen one. It's... exactly like any mentor/student relationship you can imagine, only where the mentor CREATED AND USED AND THREW AWAY the student and where ALL OF THE LOVE was a lie and manipulation. Where the student existed to be sacrificed, and where there ISN'T a heartwarming ending about how Van actually grew to care about Luke. He did grow to RESPECT Luke, after Luke fought a fuckload of battles to stop him. But see him as the BELOVED STUDENT he acted like? Nnnoooo.

Their positions on each other are SUCH a juxtaposition, and the end result is always that Luke is APPARENTLY completely open to someone so utterly untrustworthy.

And the really terrible part, is after ALL OF THAT STUFF? The only thing about Van that really upsets Luke is that Van tried to destroy the world. Luke NEVER complains about how Van CREATED HIM TO DIE or CALLED HIM A TOOL AND THREW HIM AWAY. Not because it doesn't affect him on some level, but because he... really genuinely accepted it and moved on and never got angry or vengeful or even goddamn cried about it.

SO BASICALLY.

I LOVE THIS AU

<lj-cut text=""AKA. STATE OF THE UNION"">
<font size=""4""><b>Argilla-</b></font>

<b>How's life?</b> GOOD. Argilla is in her happy place at the moment. Camp is her Happy Place. She's currently sharing a bed with Jinana. That was supposed to be temporary and just. Ended up not being. And neither of them seem to be in any desire to change it. Otherwise she has people at camp she likes, things to explore, and has made herself a mental note to go out and meet more people rather than waiting for them to meet her. By now she has explored pretty much every inch of camp and knows where most things are, except for when they suddenly change and she doesn't really mind going out and relocating things. She's sort of tired of the cold but you know, not complaining at all, and teasing Heat about it has not yet gotten old.

She is, all in all, sane and happy and domesticating. She takes care of most of the cleaning around the base, I think, without prompting. But probably isn't above just handing Serph or Heat a basket of dirty sheets and telling them to get going. She eats well on Tuesdays and gets more irritable toward Mondays, as does Heat I hear, so they probably peck at each other a lot more around those times. When she gets especially hungry she'll down a zombie or two but really doesn't enjoy it, and with Jinana being so zen about Not Eating it actually helps Argilla stick to her... diet, as it were. She's picking up hobbies as a distraction, and reading a lot of whatever seems interesting. Kira gave her a Bible at some point, and she probably reads a bit of it each day.

<b>Plans for the Future?</b> ATM Argilla needs to meet more people, get to cooking with Aragaki and Izumi, and top Roland into a relationship. At some point I'd like her to have a Bad Day and berserker but that would probably be a cast event.

<b>Posts to be Made:</b> hanging curtains in the base, reading playboy for the articles, reading the Kama Sutra in the library with Jinana.

<b>OOC Things to be Done:</b> Finish DDS2 (don't judge me), make her more game icons.


<font size=""4""><b>Edward Elric-</b></font>

<b>How's life?</b> .....acceptable. Thanks to the magic of having something to fixate on, Ed has pretty much gotten over his slump from being in camp two and a half years now. He's also practiced A-T to the point where he's probably sort of irritatingly good at it, though given as he's never really worked with anyone but Kazu I imagine he is both...lacking in creativity in some ways, and very creative in ways people would never have expected. Thanks to Ine he isn't chronically in pain anymore, other than the bruises and scrapes he gets from riding. Which are basically nothing, and being stuck in camp aside, he's feeling better than he has in ages. It's not really enough to balance being stuck in camp, as nothing really outweighs Ed's goals, but they are nice compensations and since he's not really the mopey sort to begin with he's handling very well.

<b>Plans for the Future?</b> Ed's been on the back burner for a while and needs to start getting out more. But that will probably wait until after his OOC stuff (below) is taken care of. In general I'd like to thread with Ine and Ogiue and Tomo more, beat Kazu about Stuff, and have a A-T fight with Agito. He's also getting an elephant at some point, and is going to be permanently deaged to 16, because he's 18 in camp and I just don't really like him being so much older than he is in canon. So.

<b>Posts to be Made:</b> A-T battle with Agito, can has elephant, should do that golden stature of Kazu at some point.

<b>OOC Things to be Done:</b> Reread canon, completely rehaul icon set. Started this but keep getting distracted by DGM icons.


<font size=""4""><b>Wanijima Kaito-</b></font>

<b>How's life?</b> Uh. ...Workable. Kaito's life isn't really good if he isn't you know. Throwing people in jail by the droves. Large droves. But he's not ...more discontent than usual. On a subliminal level he realizes that time is irrelevant here, but so is his position. He doesn't particularly CARE. But it keeps him from obsessing over what he can't do anything about.

Kaito is sort of my... force of nature character, like Ichijou and Hibari. Even more so than Reborn, actually, just because Reborn does actually have a vested interest in what is happening in camp, and has established friendships and concerns, and Kaito meanwhile just sort of detaches. He's here here for hilarity and topping antics and owning Agito and Akira and doesn't really attach much. Playing him otherwise would be very difficult since that's pretty much what he is in canon. Thus Kaito will probably never leave his semi-zen with camp state. Ironically the A-Tards in camp don't factor into this heavily, beyond that they are annoying, much as roaches tend to be.

<b>Plans for the Future?</b> Nothing in particular. Possibly aquire more bitches, general jail antics, keep Agito on his goddamn leash, etc.

<b>Posts to be Made:</b> Got a gym battle with Ash to arrange |D

<b>OOC Things to be Done:</b> Nooot really anything. I'm pretty good on his canon. Just missing a couple of icons to be made from the new pages.


<font size=""4""><b>Nagisa Kaworu-</b></font>

<b>How's life?</b> Lol. Uh. Okay but with GREAT CONCERN. Kaworu is a bit... well. Concerned. About the amount of information regarding himself and his companions at camp, about the barrier and camp itself, about being stuck here and not being where he's supposed to be. He hides it well because there honestly isn't anything he can DO at the moment. But he isn't becoming any less aware of it. He's hoping that camp really is unrelated to Yggdrasil, but while he thinks that might be possible, it's not something he can afford to lay his bets on.

Other than that, there's people! Wow there's a lot of people. Some of them touch him. Others know things about him. Others have opinions on him that he didn't have a chance to give them. Still others have unusual psychoses and concerns of their own.

Kaworu is Not Used To People. Like. He wasn't completely shut off, I think. But I doubt he received a lot of love and understanding at the labs he was raised in. I suspect Rei and Asuka were his only friends and only people he really connected with and learned to understand. I think he understands Lilim as a whole fairly well, but has trouble with them as individuals, and sees them from a fairly analytical point of view while realizing that... that's not all he needs, and that he is lacking the part that lets him really <i>get</i> them. What this all means is that MOST OF THE TIME he's fine. He understands just enough, is confident in himself enough, that he can interact with most people without problems, and handle their problems from an objective pov, and basically be toppy and attentive. The issue is with stuff that don't really fit into the norm, and then he becomes very well aware of his own lack of humanity. Vincent does this a lot, since... Vincent's actions should disturb people! But they don't bother Kaworu, he just realizes that is Not Good and would like to help and has no idea how to help because while he can recognize the trends and actions on one level, he doesn't really <i>connect</i> with it. So far Vincent is the only one to do this but I suspect most crazy characters will have that effect to one extent or another.

Anyway! So basically Kaworu was created to die for humanity, not to understand it's every aspect (unlike Ori!Kaworu who had no trouble with that) he's very zen but slightly confused. He'd rather not be in camp but he's enjoying himself here anyway. And making a genuine effort to fit in and do the right things but can tell he is sort of failing to come off as normal. Oops.

<b>Plans for the future?</b> Noot a lot in the way of specific things I want to do. Talk to Yamazaki and Agito and Vincent more. Touch Shinji at some point. Possibly burn Yamazaki's porn of Rei with the mun's permission. Meet Ogiue. Basically just MEET PEOPLE. Kaworu is a heavy interaction type character.

<b>Post to be Made:</b> No specific plans.

<b>OOC Things to be Done:</b> Just continue buying and scanning Asuka and nagging Desu for translations |D am pretty much ON TOP of his icons.


<font size=""4""><b>Kira Sakuya-</b></font>

<b>How's life?</b> Good. Kira Likes Camp. He enjoys being alive and being human-ish, and is genuinely grateful, deep in his black little heart, for the additional time. He's making friends! That aren't Setsuna or people related to him. Not that he had NO friends before but it's sort of a. People who he somehow collected without meaning to and then sort of looked out for and basically I sort of doubt Kira EVER made an effort for people before beyond. Keeping them alive. And so. It's WEIRD but his relationships in camp are marginally better even if Kira himself doesn't recognize it. Because the fact is, he's basically HERE for personal pleasure, even if he's not thinking of it that way, and not directing it at anyone but Setsuna. In his past lives he had a clear Job and could write everything off as part of that job. Now he's just... hanging out, really. And meeting people and poking into their business and. Developing relationships! It's good for him. He's happy. He's 99% zen with the fact that when Setsuna leaves he will die, and there aren't really any thorns in his side worthy of note here.

<b>Plans for the Future?</b> Kira doesn't do Future Plans and thus I don't have any real goals other than talk with people he likes more, and meet new people now and then and have him switch with Tiny!Sakuya again at some point. Should possibly meet Abel so I can harass Shigure about his homo.

<b>Posts to be Made:</b> Need to have a quietly reading outside the library post so he can actually for once be doing something that isn't being a jackass in some way.

<b>OOC Things to be Done:</b> I keep meaning to colorize his icons but I never find anything that works. So. Nothing )= Other than topping people into apping my canon.


<font size=""4""><b>Luke fon Fabre-</b></font>

<b>How's life?</b> I HAVE TO REWRITE THIS SINCE LUKE MESSED IT UP. He WAS doing 'Extreme Decent'. Now it's more like 'Notably Crappy'. He's really upset about Mukuro stuff but dealing with it in that Luke way where he's sort of perpetually upset without acting like it. He had a Tear-like moment of 'enough of this shit' but lacks her ability to actually wash his hands of the matter and disassociate himself. Thus he got mad at Mukuro and is going to stand by his decision of, frankly just, being done with him for now. Only in his head he's not really done with him and does want to help but has run out of options and BASICALLY IS FRUSTRATED.

...Also very hurt because like two days before this Mukuro had done something that made Luke feel like they were friends and now on top of everything else he's betrayed on a more personal level. Which he can SET ASIDE fairly easily. Because he's Luke. And that's what he does. But he feels like crap about it.

HANDLING. Luke HANDLES. And won't really be acting any different other than getting down a little more easily, but is a little 'mehn' in general at the moment. Also bees have taken over the showers and he feels grungy )=

<b>Plans for the Future?</b> Mostly need to get him out more, he's been backburning the past few months. Need to play with cast more, top Asch more. Have that thread where Natalia catches him and Asch sleeping together. <s>Touch Guy</s>. Touch Guy. Make Chrome love me. Play with Dera and Tsuna and Yamamoto more. Deage him to pre-game/early game Luke and be a bitch.

<b>Posts to be Made:</b> Currently just the deage one.

<b>OOC Things to be Done:</b> I should really get a hold of raws of the manga now that it has short hair luke and make more icons, but I'm pretty happy with my current icon set. Also need to finish my replay of the game.


<font size=""4""><b>Reborn-</b></font>

<b>How's life?</b> Life is ALWAYS good for Reborn. He has fellow babies here and his family and he can beat Tsuna into his training and he's making arrangements for everyone else and to Reborn camp is like an awesome vacation. He loves it.

<b>Plans for the Future?</b> Force mafia to fail less |D

<b>Posts to be Made:</b> Babies talking to each other about who they would hit. AU with Colonello. 

<b>OOC Things to be Done:</b> I need to make more icons. Reborn doesn't really NEED A LOT for general interaction but I wand more costumes for him.


<font size=""4""><b>Ticky Mikk-</b></font>

<b>How's life?</b> Lolo. uh. Hard for me to say at the moment. He's sort in the middle of a plot which is still waiting to conclude. But at the moment HE is doing just fine. He got to take out a liver and a gallbladder and that was fun. Realizes he might die immanently but isn't terribly concerned, since it's really not outside his planning at all. Ticky's sanity is fluxing a lot lately, which is partly why he removed Rabi's liver I think (other than because Ari told me to hurt him). He really NEEDS another plot line to get him moving this way or that. Ticky tends to have EVENTS that affect his sanity and feelings toward someone, and then he lives in a flux of that state for a while, then something else happens that shifts him again. Last time it was body switching with Shigure and since then he's been living poking at Shigure. Now it's de-livering Rabi and getting Allen involved and possibly making Mika revoke their friendship. And for Ticky none of this is really BAD. It's just a shift that... keeps him rolling, basically.

<b>Plans for the Future?</b> Fight Mika and Raph? Have Allen take up residence with him and much stupid/sexy/unsafe/stupid antics ensue. Get beaten up by Reborn for Shigure's amusement. Hang out in his white form more.

<b>Posts to be Made:</b> Ticky's not really a poster so. No.

<b>OOC Things to be Done:</b> ........working on a Gray icon set for inevitable de-noahing. Might take a while. Should possibly also catch up with my my manga. 


<font size=""4""><b>Vash the Stampede-</b></font>

<b>How's life?</b> Vash's life is pretty much perpetually chill at camp. He worries about people in his Vash way. But frankly life here is so much more relaxed than the last seventy years of his life have been it's not even funny. He's pretty zen. Fixing garden after giant blizzard. Bees )= Probably takes cold showers outside courtesy of vases and pitchers since the bathrooms are all. Bees. He was a shouta for a while, but he likes that and doesn't really mind any of it.

<b>Plans for the Future?</b> Break the mess hall. Go sledding with Wolfwood and Livio. Top Soubi somehow. Meet Ritsuka. Meet Shigure, continuing my trend of getting Shigure connected to all of my characters somehow.

<b>Posts to be Made:</b> Mess Hall Smash.

<b>OOC Things to be Done:</b> Need more dodging and pain icons )=


<font size=""4""><b>Viral-</b></font>

<b>How's life?</b> Viral's sort of... in a slump that I should possibly get him out of. He needs more connections to further him leaving his cave. Viral HIMSELF is as fine as he... gets without actually having a place in life. He has some secret uncertainties and angst even but he doesn't really acknowledge the latter and tries to override the former. He's very constructive! In his. Viral way. Still sort of rejecting humans out of habit but getting better. Still, he prefers to spend his time out in the woods and that should be worked on.

<b>Plans for the Future?</b> Anima+ Shouta training I've been meaning to do for forever. Meet people. Get beat up by Hibari. ......stuff.

<b>Posts to be Made:</b> Anima+ Shouta training.

<b>OOC Things to be Done:</b> Read the manga and make icons.


<font size=""4""><b>Zack Fair-</b></font>

<b>How's life?</b> EXCELLENT \o/ ZACK LOVES EVERYTHING but the no sex ban but you know IT'S COOL he's not complaining. Zack is in the most awesome threesome ever. Also. Not dead. Also. Actually getting played. Also Zidane sold him great gloves and he can now use abilities WHENEVER HE WANTS and basically Zack is psyched about life. And I... don't even have anything to add to that. HE'S GREAT.

<b>Plans for the Future?</b> <s>have sex</s> <s>make out with Aeris</s> <s>make out with Cloud at greater length</s> <s>watch Aeris and Cloud make out</s> uh. ........bring cell phones to camp |D Meet more people. Somethingsomething needs more laser dragon.

<b>Posts to be Made:</b> Cellphones? Fluffy animals.

<b>OOC Things to be Done:</b> I reaaaaaally need to work on his icon set. I've been very lazy about it up until now.</lj-cut>"

Peony asks if they are GIRLY. Yes they are. These are all from either doujin or official manga 4koma things. I DESPERATELY NEEDED MORE ICONS but the sad thing is I don't agree with the presentation of Argilla in most of them (the doujin, ironically, seem to do a better job than the 'official' things). Anyway! I haven't used the last one yet, dunno if I ever will. The first two are pretty IC, the first especially, because Argilla DOES GET KINDA TRAUMATIZED a few times. Before the flying rage sets in. Plus I like the art.

FIRST: FROM AN AWESOME VOLUME COVER. This is the one where Ed WANDERS AROUND IN A SEA OF BLOOD and fights Envy after being EATEN BY GLUTTONY and uh, uses the souls of the dead for selfish reasons and basically IT KINDA SUCKS TO BE ED IN THAT VOLUME. He handles it well. But if you scrape it down to bare facts it's a pretty brutal arc |D ANYWAY IT'S SUPER HOT I LOVE IT. SECOND: Not actually an embarrassed icon originally. IIRC All is stopping Ed from flipping out for some reason. I added a blush to it because Ed never blushes in canon and I needed a way to react to being molested by Riddle. THIRD: UH. I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT TRAUMA INCIDENT THAT IS FROM. I think that's from when he realizes what happened to Nina? He looks 12 because the art looked a lot younger back in volume 2 )=

FIRST: uh. so. sometimes Kaito gets angry. One way to make Kaito REALLY CRAZILY ANGRY is to be his possession, stop him when he's trying to CAPTURE CRIMINALS. and then RUN AWAY. Agi/Akito did this. This icon is from when he catches up |D SECOND: pretty ""lolo what the fucking shit"" surprise look from when the King of the Rising Road whose name I forget magnetizes the floors and forces all of the cops to drop their guns at once >D THIRD: SO OHGREAT DOES THIS AWESOME... CHIBI. ICON. THINGS. He has one for like EVERY CHARACTER. This is kaito's |D

Kiraaa. Stelas asked about the range. UH. Well the first is actually a character named Rin from a different Kaori Yuki manga I used to make him a girl. BUT. He has an almost identical expression as a male. The second is... a chapter cover from the chapter when Kira kills himself |D And the third is Kira being topped by what a retard Setsuna is. SURPRISINGLY, KIRA HAS A VERY WIDE RANGE OF EMOTION. We just don't see him USE it that much. I.E., icon number three is pretty much the only time he looks surprised and topped, most of his surprised faces are faked exaggeration or sort of ""why are you touching me"" faces. He also smiles REALLY HAPPILY or really softly or FREAKS OUT AND YELLS or looks really depressed or really bittersweet uh. He never really looks scared. But anyway yeah. BUT AT THE SAME TIME he just. Never really expresses himself outside of certain people or situations. Most of his faces are lies |D

Luke totally tops Tear into a kiss like a non-failure )= (then proceeds to fail but details). Someone should app Tear )= THIRD: SO UH. THIS ICON SUMMARIZES EVERYTHING THAT IS ASCH AND LUKE. WHICH IS TO SAY. THIS IS HOW ALL OF THEIR CONVERSATIONS GO. This particular one is from toward the end of the game when Asch is like DO WHAT I SAY OR I WILL NEVER ACCEPT YOU and Luke is like UH I DON'T REALLY CARE IF YOU ACCEPT ME STOP BEING A RETARD and Asch yells at him for it.

FIRST: REBORN TOTALLY WEARS AWESOME SLEEPWEAR. He loves being a baby )= FOOTIES. I cant' remember where it's from but it doesn't matter cuz he wears it a lot. SECOND: MY WIFE IS AWESOME. Uh. Reborn was making fun of Viper's tentacles and somehow we got onto Reborn having better tentacles and next thing I know I was demanding my wife draw me Cthulhu!Reborn. THIRD: This is from. One of those many times Reborn had to force Tsuna to do something. I think. I just love it cuz it's one of my icons that LOOKS SO CLEARLY MAFIA |D

First: The butterfly icons are very bright because in the anime they are depicted as glowing neon blue and I wanted a way to convey that, without deviating from the theme of the icon set. So there are the very saturated butterfly icons, as well as some very saturated yellows in the black icons, and I think all together it works alright. This is a general ""when butterflies attack"" icon. ONE DAY I WILL MAKE A GOOD ICONF OF THEIR TEETH. Second: the Hobo is kinda a retard. There are few white icons because we only see Ticky living his white life once in the manga so far )= HOSHINO HATES ME. Third: THIS IS THE FACE TICKY MAKES WHEN ALLEN BITCH SMACKS HIM it's hilarious. I like NEVER get to use this icon, but I always love when I do. This is sort of a ""You really surprised me and that's sort of cute/funny but you are obviously still harmless and I'm not really taking you seriously"" face.

FIRST: THIS IS HARD WHEN I LIKE. DIDN'T MAKE HALF OF MY ICONS. I. I can't remember when Vash makes this face. I think it might be like, when this guy is being a retard and showing off his AMAZING GUN SKILLS for Vash and Vash totally plays along and is amazed and |D despite the guy BLATANTLY HATING HIM I love Vash )= Second: SO UH. SPOILERS WOLFWOOD DIES. Vash makes him a stone grave and leaves his cross as a grave marker )= third: IT SUCKS TO BE VASH. He is WITHOUT QUESTION the most horribly scarred charater ever. He has burns, cuts, gouges, and lots of random bits of metal drilled into his flesh, plus he's missing an arm THIS IS WHY YOU SHOULDN'T TRY TO BE A JESUS KIDS.

"event","SO IN LIGHT OF NOT DOING WORK AT WORK ON A FRIDAY. Let's have an essay.

Mukuro owes me like a million essays. Bother her. IN THE MEAN TIME I've been wanting to write about this because while I realize NO ONE BUT ME AND HER follow Luke and Mukuro's interactions, the gradual shift their relationship is really interesting to me.

SO, I dub this essay; <b>Mukuro and Luke: A History</b> or <b>Why Luke Gets To Top</b>.

<lj-cut>

First of all, to know why I felt like writing this, you'd have to be aware of the nature of the last four threads of significance that Luke and Mukuro have had. As of the first, when Luke was in a bad mood (due to something that happened with Asch) and Mukuro tried to make him feel horrible but ended up helping him out, Luke has kind of gotten into the habit of confronting Mukuro in an intelligent manner on his issues. He does this <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/4249052.html?thread=1404985308#t1404985308"" target=""_blank"">Here</a> and <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/4264099.html?thread=1416614563#t1416614563"" target=""_blank"">Here</a> and <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/4268220.html?thread=1418023612#t1418023612"" target=""_blank"">Here</a> and <a href=""http://eternalsamba.livejournal.com/13858.html"" target=""_blank"">Here</a>.

Now! Part of the reason I suspect that NO ONE ELSE NOTICES THIS is because on some level they are very plain and boring. Mukuro doesn't... do stuff to Luke the way he does to other characters. He doesn't fight him, rarely outright insults him or fucks with him. Luke, meanwhile, has a jesus-y sort of zen where you can tick him off or make him a bit bitchy, but most of the time he's happy and calm and... normal. Neither of them talk about their own problems, Luke never pries at Mukuro unless he feels the situation needs it (as in recent developments) and basically they spend a lot of time just talking casually and I'm sure it's boring to read.

ALSO there is a matter of the fact that due to the nature of Mukuro being Mukuro, you can't really tell by reading the threads that he's losing. It's not something he'd ever admit. Even in canon he's zen and collected about getting his ass kicked. THAT'S HOW MUKURO ROLLS. So the only reason I KNOW LUKE IS TOPPING is because the entire time we're having these threads Mukuro-mun and I make faces at each other and yell and discuss character issues and she assures me that Mukuro hates Luke (only not really) and it's actually all very hilarious.

Anyway! This is partly for me, because I think about it a lot.

Luke is... a kind of unique character to play. He never fully develops in canon. Which I like! But at the end of the game he is not entirely the person he will one day become. Not because he isn't completely a jesus, but because he's very human in the way he continues to learn things, shift and work with people. Comparing Luke at the beginning of the game to how he is after Akzeriuth is not really fair, the dramatic turn of events send his personality into a complete one-eighty. But comparing Luke after Akzeriuth and through the course of the game? That is fair. In is roughly half a year his time (one year our time) he goes through a lot of things, loses all confidence in himself and finds it, learns to trust people, learns to interact with others differently. His relationship with Guy, who he tends to casually enjoy as a friend and perhaps take for granted, isn't like his relationship with Tear. Even though both Tear and Guy are supportive of him and love him, Luke acknowledges Tear a lot more because Tear sort of demands it of him, meanwhile Guy makes it almost a point to be more of a reassuring shadow. In this way, Luke is still very ignorant, since he doesn't realize any of this is happening. But he very much does learn things and change his approaches to peopled based on his experiences with <i>them</i>, rather than sort of setting a bar for how he will interact with everyone ever and only shifting it when absolutely necessary.

It's very human of him, very young and not completely self aware but speaks a lot of how hard he tries, and I like that.

Which is kind of how things go with Mukuro.

Initially, and for the course of four or five months, Luke never really got Mukuro. He associated Mukuro heavily with Master Van in his head, because they had the same goals. It took him until... just recently, to understand that while Master Van and Mukuro might have the same overall desire and a lot of similar life experiences, they're actually very different people. And so they talked a lot and Luke started thinking of Mukuro less as ""Gokuder and Tsuna's enemy"" and more as ""My friend who needs help and is kind of a jackass"". And Luke isn't... completely dumb. He has a certain faith in himself that he can both be friends with someone and at the same time do what he has to, if he has to. He doesn't hold back from people because they might be his enemy one day, any more than he ever tried to pull away from Master Van. It just doesn't occur to him to try to make things easier but avoiding the part that will make it hard. And... he does like Mukuro, he really does. He's honestly grateful for Mukuro's company and opinions, for explaining things to him. And if he doesn't really LIKE Mukuro being an ass to him? He... traveled with Jade for a year, he can handle it, and seriously doesn't hold a grudge, at all.

But the thing that sometimes worries me is that Luke... isn't smart. He's not dumb either. But Luke is rarely the one doing emotional insights in ToA. He gets Tear a couple of times, helps Anise, yells at Ingobert, picks up on the fact that Asch loves Guy, and makes his own choices regarding Asch. But... that's really not a lot. Usually the team helps each other, usually the team fixes Luke. Luke can sometimes sense things but doesn't know what to do, and goes more toward offering support and help but not knowing what to say or how to approach it. He's young and earnest but also doesn't have a lot of confidence in his ability to help other people with their problems.

And for a long time, Luke didn't. He believed everything Mukuro told him, and when he figured out Mukuro was lying still couldn't understand why. It never occurred to him that Mukuro was being less than honest about his own issues, because in Luke's world, the only people who aren't honest with their own issues are... him and Asch. Because Mukuro gives every appearance of being sure and confident and Luke is not really either in his own way, he has no reason to doubt that image.

Soo... what changed? Asch, actually. The start of it was Luke getting frustrated with Asch. Asch is a liar. Asch is angry and dumb and irrational and Luke has been kind figuring this out gradually. And gradually Luke has had to accept the fact that <I>no one else is there for Asch</i> (well Natalia is now, but back when this was happening, no). That Asch doesn't have a Tear to knock sense into him, and that worse, Asch is deteremined to be unhappy forever. And the fact that Luke continues to get brushed by him was annoying him. Not because he wants Asch to love him, but he wants Asch to be happy and to deal with things and Luke can tell he's NOT, and finally Luke decided that, for Asch's sake, he would have enough confidence in himself to attempt to make a difference in Asch's life. Which is... a big step for Luke, since that is sort of like stepping into Tear's shoes for him, but he got fed up and honestly didn't know what else to do.

Which! Did not immediately translate into ""forcing Asch to deal with his issues"" = ""force Mukuro too while he's at it"". For one, Luke wasn't really AWARE that Mukuro has issues he lies about until recently. He's been gradually noticing the pattern of Mukuro having... holes in his logic. But Mukuro is good at changing the direction of the conversation when Luke finds them, and Luke is easy to distract. Furthermore, intentionally ignoring these sorts of thing is so far from how Luke deals with things NOW it took him forever to realize Mukuro might be doing it on purpose. Because... in a way, Luke admires Mukuro. Because Mukuro, in his head, was like Master Van. Now that he's truly and finally disassociated Mukuro from Master Van, that will probably change.

Ironically, in a way Luke is having more luck with Mukuro at this point than Asch. Why? Because Asch outright rejects Luke and walks away, and Mukuro doesn't. Mukuro, for Mukuro reasons I will let the mun discuss on her own time, never seems to really reject people. He makes them reject HIM. Which has been the problem in Luke and Mukuro's relationship all along: Mukuro is a crappy human being, but Luke's seen worse, been through worse, and loved people despite it. The latest thread I linked to up there (which is still unfinished and can't be worked on until monday) is over Mukuro killing a kid in camp 'for fun'. This is not a SMALL THING to Luke. And Luke moving into a serious and sort of caring conversation with Mukuro after that doesn't mean he's forgiven. But Luke... knows better than the throw the futile thing back in the face of someone who doesn't care, much like how he doesn't bring up Akzeriuth to Master Van in order to say ""You are horrible and should feel bad about this"" once it's clear that Van <i>doesn't</i>. He's perfectly capable of still hating that and being personally upset by it but won't get chained to it to where no positive movement can be made, if that makes sense. Mainly because Luke isn't actually capable of hating anyone. I mean. He didn't hate Van? He's not going to hate anyone. Not even if you kill people for fun, and with the recent turn of the conversation, Luke realizes it wasn't really the killing people part Mukuro enjoys.

Luke has decided he doesn't care if he's wrong about his ideas and says the wrong thing. That's mainly what held him back over dealing with other people's emotional issues: He is young and stupid and doesn't think he can offer any worthwhile advice. He'll misunderstand, be insensitive, do something wrong. But he's <i>very</i> comfortable with Mukuro by now, and isn't really worried about being dumb around him or accidentally offending. And he's also used to the fact that if he wants answers from Mukuro he has to work it, carefully and persistently. Thinking his way through everything the way he promised himself he would always do, and just not hesitating to ask questions when he doesn't understand, and make guesses when no one will offer him explanations.

Mukuro, meanwhile, never really gets his logic seriously picked apart. He's from a shounen manga. People state their side briefly, if at all, disagree, fight over it. It would would be different if Mukuro or Luke were the type to attack, but Mukuro doesn't attack Luke for... Mukuro reasons. Luke never attacks out of anger ever. He attacks out of dire need for something, and fighting Mukuro physically in a place where he can't stay dead is just... dumb, in Luke's mind. Meanwhile, where MOST PEOPLE would get frustrated after dealing with Mukuro logic for a while Luke... okay he DOES but he doesn't give up. Because... Luke killed the person most important to him in the world over a disagreement in beliefs, and he can do that, yeah, he believes in himself that much. But he never want to again, so if he has the chance to change someone's opinion, or find a middle ground, to make them understand (as he can't be help Master Van might have one day been able to do, if they'd had time...) he's... not going to pass it up. And Luke just isn't the type to forget that priority, ever.

So what this finally results in is Luke asking Mukuro questions, getting a variety of answers because sometimes Mukuro tells the truth and sometimes he lies, and Luke piecing it together, finally realizing that Mukuro is... ignoring things. Like Luke used to do (he actually considers this a Luke Trait, I'm not kidding.) and that sort of... immediately brings Mukuro down onto a level Luke can truly consider equal and. Mukuro's probably never goign to escape from that now.

SO THE END RESULT? Luke... tops! Eventually, sometimes. He still gets mad, can be manipulated to an extent, and the fact that he gets to top is KIND OF BAD because it makes Mukuro go take stuff out on LANCIA (cuz Lancia doesn't top him) and in a way is causing problems since Mukuro is a bitch. But then Luke doesn't realize he's doing he's honestly just, doing his best to figure out the situation. And any sense of 'topping' he gets is the periodic realization Mukuro is being honest with him.

And it's a weird relationship and I like it a lot. And everytime I'm sure Luke is really going to give up on Mukuro this time something happens... partly because Luke can't actually give up. Ever. Partly because Mukuro has a critical weakness to Luke.

So! There! That's how I ended up here, with a dumb jesus redhead who somehow tops crazy mcbastard pants despite not actually being very insightful generally. Luke will probably continue to be somewhat dumb and oblivious toward people who aren't Asch and Mukuro, because he's not focused on their problems and because he hasn't come to the conclusion that he's more emotionally competent than them. This even includes people he's clearly more emotionally competent than, like Gokudera. Because unless you are SERIOUSLY FAILING AT EVERY ASPECT OF LIFE AND HURTING OTHERS IN THE PROCESS it will basically never occur to Luke to look at your life the way he does with Asch and Mukuro.

Aaaand as for what this means with future Mukuro dealings? I have no idea I just don't even try anymore =D

AND WHILE I HAVE A GIANT ESSAY maybe I should talk on Luke re: Mukuro. Because I'm nice.

In simplest terms, Luke loves Mukuro. Not in a gay way, in a friendship and jesus way. That wasn't really meant to happen. Luke only got involved with Mukuro in attempt to help Dera. But through virtue of being Luke, Luke has hung out around Mukuro a lot, gotten honest answers from him, learned things about him, and cared about him despite a lot of lies and casual abuse. Mainly because Luke is pretty well immune to both lies and abuse and unless you're doing ACTUALLY BAD THINGS tends to only see the good and the annoying, and he can live with the annoying. And up until Mukuro killing Thomas, Mukuro hadn't killed anyone in camp as far as Luke knows. Fighting people who are fighters (Ikki and Gokudera) when those people are connected to the mafia (which Mukuro hates for reasons Luke now knows) is still BAD but... it's understandable. It's a thought process he can follow. Also Gokudera invites it, Luke's not blind. KILLING A KID TO FUCK WITH LANCIA IS VERY BAD. But at the same time it comes when Luke is making headway with Mukuro and he's not going to abandon that, otherwise in the long run more people might die, and Luke is pretty good at remembering to keep the big picture in mind.

And Luke... is a jesus, and he cares about people a lot. And Mukuro's attempts to hurt him by calling him stupid don't work, because Luke is zen with his own intelligence. Because short of outright attacking him or his friends, Mukuro actually can't do anything to Luke that Luke hasn't dealt with in spades since the start of his game.

In more recent threads, Mukuro has gotten more desperate to make Luke give up on him, and thus gotten more brutal. He told Luke he hates him, and would kill him if he would stay dead. This ended up in a run around that resulted in Mukuro indirectly admitting he liked him, but Luke... missed that, cuz Luke is dumb.

WHAT DOES LUKE THINK MUKURO FEELS if Mukuro is ALWAYS LYING? That's... hard to explain. Luke KNOWS Mukuro doesn't think Luke is worthless, and hasn't in a long time, even though Mukuro tends to act like he thinks that. Luke knows this because when his Master told him he was worthless, you could just... you could tell. Van literally <i>never gives Luke the time of day</i>, Luke KNOWS what it's like to have absolutely no value in someone's eyes, and Mukuro doesn't treat him like that. So he's solidly confident that Mukuro feels something for him. Not... necessarily something good! If it makes any sense he both completely believes Mukuro hates him and suspects Mukuro likes him, at the same time.

HOW THIS WORKS IS SPECIAL LUKE-O-VISION where he doesn't think about it very hard. It's sort of like Tear both loving and hating Van. Not on as personal a level, but just the idea that opinions can conflict a bit. However, Luke has... issues! So he finds it easy to believe Mukuro hates him, and believe if Mukuro likes him it's probably because Mukuro finds him entertaining. He's... okay with this, really. He thinks of Mukuro as a friend, and won't stop just because Mukuro has made it clear the sentiment isn't returned. Loving people who hate him is KIND OF LUKE'S THING ANYWAY. He's pretty cool with it by now and honestly doesn't stop to think about it much, and it rolls off him when Mukuro tries to be a bitch and make it a point to be mean.

Aaand in a way that's sort of it. Luke has a very simple and direct way of viewing things, that hilariously helps him break through Mukuro's walls. He takes tiny logic steps that his tiny brain can follow but it also keeps him from getting turned around or confused or from giving up. He sees Mukuro has a friend, this is not hindered by Mukuro's plans, because Luke doesn't look at things that way. He believes Mukuro hates him, but can deal with that, because regardless Mukuro is still a friend in need. At the end of their third thread (that I linked), Luke agreed to leave Mukuro alone, and he did that for Mukuro's sake, because Mukuro made it clear he didn't want Luke around him. That'... didn't last long due to the Czes getting killed, thing. But at the time he decided that because Luke believes he isn't being useful in helping Mukuro. Mukuro IS changing for the better, Luke can see this, he just thinks it's thanks to Tsuna and people in general, and that Luke is just frustrating him and so, as a friend, agreed to leave him alone. In the middle of the most recent thread, Luke adjusted Mukuro mentally to be his equal, instead of a superior, which will change their interactions a bit, probably. Luke will be okay with making more assumptions in the future, and being direct about things that possibly aren't his business. Overall, Luke likes Mukuro despite everything, really does care about him, probably won't ever stop, since I can't imagine anyone doing anything worse than what Master Van did and Luke still loved him after that. He's also totally unaware of the troubles he causes Mukuro, and may very well always be, because Luke is dumb and tends to not realize he has positive effects on people.

THERE THAT WAS LONG but I'm happy and think that sorts out any issues I might have been having with myself. \o/</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""BLAHBLAH LUKE ESSAY ON ASCH SPOILERS FOR WHOLE GAME IF YOU ARE PLAYING THE GAME DON'T READ THIS OR I WILL FUCKING KILL YOU"">

K so I didn't really think I initially needed to do an essay on Asch because IN MY HEAD it was all pretty summed up. Luke honestly loves Asch. Was just. So. <I>Hurt</i> by his death. And then he came to camp, which basically made Luke the HAPPIEST REPLICA EVER and yeah.

Uh! To sum up roughly how things were at the end of the game.

Luke and Asch never resolve. Which is perhaps one of the saddest things ever. But if they did it would sort of. Well. Asch wouldn't be Asch. And hell it's true Luke CAN'T really <i>truly</i> understand how bad his existence damaged Asch. At the same time, Asch didn't seem to really GET Luke, and kept trying to make Luke prove his existence, or threatening to deny him, without getting that Luke never needed Asch to prove his own existence. Luke found <i>himself</i> and his original wasn't... really a part of that. 

Luke is more honest with Asch, and more intolerant of him than pretty much everyone in the game. Which isn't to say he doesn't cut Asch any slack, he cuts him a LOT. But Luke will put up with just about anything from anyone and Asch is the only person he ever really makes an effort to be on an equal level with. This combined with his deep attachment to Asch, several honest efforts to reach out to him, and frequently being concerned for him when he isn't around, despite the fact that they NEVER REALLY DO CONNECT leads me to believe Luke just. Has a sort of inexplicable connection with Asch ANYWAY. And. It's not that surprising! Asch his original. Luke took everything from him, he doesn't feel TERRIBLY guilty about this, as for once it wasn't his fault and he has PLENTY OF OTHER GUILT COMPLEXES. But He recognizes that it hurt Asch. At the same time, Luke spent a while trying to find himself. ASCH existing usurped pretty much everything Luke ever believed about himself. And those things never seemed very important until he didn't have them anymore. The fact that Luke, as a replica, does not appear in the Score is what ultimately saves the world but. But... on their <I>ENTIRE FUCKING PLANET</i> everyone around the world had a Score that told them everything from what they would eat the next day to the minute they would die. We aren't a society with a heavy fixation on destiny. Luke's IS. And for a while he just... had no idea <i>why he existed</i>. Everyone else had a part in the Score and he was the only person who didn't. And he'd HAD THAT and LOST IT and yeah. Luke had a few issues too.

ANYWAY That was a tangent. My point is. These things all tie into Luke having a mild and very squishy sort of obsession with Asch (unlike Asch's angry rar obsession with the stupid replica). Asch was something he could connect with, even if it didn't want him. Asch represented everything thought he once was, everything he no longer wes. ""Real"". And while that gradually faded and Luke found himself without need of Asch, Luke is far too much of a jesus to NOT care about his original. Especially when his original is HIMSELF only angry and miserable and without friends or family or the country he loved (far more than Luke ever did growing up). And Luke REALLY TRULY wanted for his happiness. But wasn't going to give up himself or just roll over out of pity for Asch.

But! They... never resolve. Not really. There is certainly understanding there, but both of them working toward the same goal (fighting to give their lives up for it, lolo) isn't really the same as being friends. Or. Even chill with each other.

But just the same (and trust me there WERE issues on both sides. Asch was just noisier about his) Luke deeply loved Asch and then he died. He died in crappy way. It sucked. And Luke was sadder over than probably anything else that happened that day.

So the entire time Luke was at camp he was secretly hoping Asch would show up. HERE'S THE THING ABOUT LUKE. IF YOU THINK HE'S HAPPY YOU'RE PROBABLY WRONG. Well. not WRONG per se. He is capable of being very happy very honestly! He's just secretly pretty much always miserable somewhere deep down inside. You TYPICALLY WON'T NOTICE IT. It's canon. HE JUST HAS ISSUES THAT HE DOESN'T WANT TO BOTHER PEOPLE WITH. So. I don't think the Asch thing EVER CAME UP IN CAMP because Luke didn't want people to know how much it bothered him but he seriously didn't go a night without hoping that Asch would appear.

So when he finally DID Luke was thrilled and excited and a little heartbroken all over again.

Luke didn't try to push anything. And by PUSH ANYTHING I mean push Asch putting aside their differences. DESPITE THE MOLESTINGS he's not really interested in Asch like that. The kissing just... comes from the fact that he's a hormonal boy and Asch is, ironically, the only person he feels truly comfortable with.

Anyway! So he figures HERE WE HAVE TIME and he hasn't really made a serious effort to get past Asch's walls but...

Here's the thing! Luke's changed in camp. I'm aware of it. I don't mind it because he changes SO MUCH IN CANON it would be weird for him to be in camp a year and stagnate. In camp he didn't have his party to think for him (as they do A LOT in canon) and he has gotten pretty good at... playing the parts of his various party members. HE SERIOUSLY DOES THIS IN HIS HEAD ""What would Tear say?"" ""What would Guy do?"" etc. And then through... dealing with various people, he's just gotten a little wiser. He's still DUMB but he's also better at figuring people out. I.E. Mukuro! When they first started talking Luke TOOK HIM AT THIS WORD ALL THE TIME. Now he can pretty much always tell when Mukuro is being a jerk just to be a jerk. He... still tends to assume Mukuro is telling the truth (ironically, he often is >D) but he can tell Mukuro LIKES to just. Be a bitch. Similarly Luke, despite being SUCH A JESUS, is not beyond bitching right back himself. He's slowly but steadily learning to see and call bullshit among people he's familiar with (people he ISN'T familiar with can. still fool him completely). And! That's how this sort of leads back to Asch.

Cuz. Asch bullshits a lot. Luke isn't QUITE to the point of telling his original he's a moron. But he's... more capable of seeing it. Of separating one thing from another and realizing this doesn't justify that. Not so much in relating to Asch's GIANT ISSUES. But just... little things.

FOR EXAMPLE. They both liked both kisses. THIS IS VERY OBVIOUS. It's not a matter of ""Luke loev Asch wai wai OTP"" they're hormonal and APPARENTLY VERY BI BOYS. They both have NEXT TO NO EXPERIENCE and they're both too uncomfortable with other people to seriously ever do that sort of thing. Luke has had other mistletoe kisses! They were varying levels of awkward. He liked them but didn't know how MUCH he should like them due to his relationships with the people involved and just sort of went ""._. ..."" and put it aside. Asch he... doesn't really have to hide anything from. To say he doesn't care what Asch thinks of him would be a LIE but it honestly isn't a matter of needing Asch to validate his existance. He wants Asch to LIKE him. He wants Asch to like him for WHO HE IS and isn't really... going to. Act different for him or anything. But he's not going to just give up either! And... the more he doesn't give up the more he notices that ASCH IS KIND OF REALLY FUCKING HYPOCRITICAL. 

As for... why this is only now starting to bother Luke and why he's progressively pushing the issue a little more each time. And why it's one of the RARE THINGS to actually sort of peeve him off...

Well! ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A MIRROR and the mirror mad Asch nice. That stuff about lalala only liking people for their TRUE SELVES? Bullshit. For a few hours Luke got to hang out with Asch. Asch who was STILL ASCH only nice and... most importantly. Didn't hate him. Asch who <i>apologized</i>, something Luke never expected, wanted or needed but... but appreciated more than he can really say. Not because he thinks he DESERVES one just. Because it DOES SORT OF HURT to be completely loathed by one person who you sort of can't help but love a whole fucking lot (and wow Luke has EXPERIENCE with people he cares about loathing him sigh) and never being able to reach them and. Yeah. He liked it.

So they hung out. They had fun. They were equals and nice people and I'm not saying Luke WANTED IT TO STAY LIKE THAT FOREVER!!! because. He didn't. But. It did make him realize what all he was missing out on, something he'd never seriously thought about because it'd never seriously seemed like an option. Losing that. Having Asch ONCE AGAIN HATE HIM for 'taking advantage of it' and just... it meant a lot to Luke and NOTHING TO ASCH other than another cause of anger and.

And Luke ... does want it! He wants to be friends. He wants to NOT BE HATED. He wants... Asch to be happy and if Asch would be happy if Luke just LEFT HIM ALONE FOREVER Luke... would probably do it! But it's quite obvious Asch is completely incapable of finding or even looking for his own happiness, and Luke wouldn't be doing him any favors by abandoning him.

Still. It's become progressively more obvious that the main thing standing in their way is Asch's incapability to DEAL with Luke. And even if Luke doesn't realize it quite that technically, he can tell the whole unforgiving hatred has to go. It's not that Luke is looking for forgiveness or to apologize (though he WOULD, probably) or that he needs Asch to forget it all. But to... get PAST it? Yes. Getting past it is HEALTHY. LONG TALKS WITH MUKURO has convinced Luke that people can be pretty stubborn about their world views and... hell Luke isn't anyone to point fingers! What with. you know. HIS HISTORY. But he does... GET it. And he finally has the confidence to believe maybe he CAN do something about it.

Which is also a new development. He didn't think so when Luc was here, or he would have been a little more forceful on his opinions. But between Luc and Mukuro, Luke's gradually learned there ISN'T always a Tear to come and bitchsmack you around until you're not a dumbass anymore. And he doesn't WANT these people to have to DESTROY A FUCKING CITY to realize maybe their view on life isn't bringing them or anyone else any happiness. So. While he still knows he's perhaps not the most FIT person to punch people in the head to get the stupid out, he's not going to give up on them due to his own self worth issues. 

Which. Basically means. Luke's sort of figured out Asch is a moron. But he still loves him and is going to pester Asch until he either loves Luke back, STOPS HATING HIM. Or finds his own happiness.</lj-cut>"

"event","MOTHER BOARD ONE DID NOT WORK. Motherboard two did! Note to self, only buy MSI. Of course, buying a new processor and RAM to go with it might have helped.

HOWEVER, despite the computer working, the networking does not. As networks can be TRICKSY BEASTS I am not at this point sure if it's the onboard nic having issues, or if it's just NEW AND DIFFERENT and I haven't successfully configured everything perfectly.

BOTTOM LINE. I have been working on laptops for like, two weeks now? And I'm PROFOUNDLY SICK OF IT. So! I haven't forgotten those threads! I WILL PICK THEM UP. Just. Possibly not today. I mean HOPEFULLY TODAY but if I can't get the network on my computer working? You know why. But I HATE LAPTOPS and they remove a good portion of the joy of computers for me. So, I'm using this time to sit around and play video games. Which, honestly, I haven't done in ages anyway so it's not totally a loss.

I will leave the laptop up on gmail when I'm not fucking around with my network connection (I only have one landline so I have to keep switching them) so you can poke me. BUT I won't be RPing until my machine works.

PS I know a lot of you got ToA for christmas. GO PLAY. AND APP. JOIN MY CAAAST."

<b>House:</b> Hufflepuff
<b>Year:</b> Third, despite being seventeen =\ 
<b>Talent:</b> Quidditch, Muggle Studies, DADA
<B>Wand:</b> 14"" Sycamore (growth and persistence!), springy, siren hair
<b>Other:</b> Luke is the heir to a very wealthy very important wizarding family. However due to 'losing his memory' at age ten he never went to wizarding school, but was kept in his father's manor and tutored in magic by MASTER VAN!!!11 while he was re-raised. Since he didn't know anything other than a life of luxery he was a brat =\ However, after some BETRAYAL and HORRIBLE REVALATIONS and using his SECRET MAGICAL ABILITY TO RIP THINGS APART WITH HIS MIND AND KILLING A LOT OF PEOPLE Luke mellowed out a LOT and is now a really nice kid bent on doing his best to MAKE EVERYONE HAPPIER. O, one of the 'betrayal' things was finding out he was a Duplicate (SEE WHAT I DID THERE?) of the 'real' Luke fon Fabre who Van made off with seven years ago =\ Now known as Asch the Bloody, his whereabouts are unknown.

Anyway. THAT STUFF WITH MASTER VAN IS ALL RESOLVED and Luke was going to go enter societ \o/ only to find he really wasn't capable of doing so because he's really only seven years old, his tutoring was incomplete and unbalanced, and he's barely able to take care of himself, much less be of any use to society. So he had his RICH PARENTS work a deal with Hogwarts and he was accepted as a student... only he had to take an aptitude test and start with whatever grade his weakest point was. TURNS OUT Luke is really good in muggle studies (after wandering around the world a lot!) and DADA and Quidditch but fails at everything else so. Despite being seventeen and this being his first year at Hogwarts, he's a third year |D

STAFF KNOWS ABOUT HIM BEING A DUPLICATE and such. But otherwise he doesn't really talk about it |D"

"event","So this came up recently and I thought I would make an effort on it.

Some people have characters that just... don't interact well, and have a hard time starting relationships, good or bad, at camp. You know, the sort of person who just DOESN'T CARE ABOUT PEOPLE or DOESN'T WANT TO SOCIALIZE or has NOTHING TO SAY. Or hell, is a Ghost/Spirit/Whathaveyou, and basically for one reason or another you LOVE and are just having a hard time getting out.

HERE IS THE DEAL. I HAVE SIX CHARACTERS <S>soon to be seven!</s>. I HAVE two Jesii, one stubborn and one dumb, one midget whom you can do no damage to, and one psychopath who doubles as a hobo. My other two: a sword who doesn't care about your shit and an anti-social failure drenched in DAKRNESSS may or may not be participating. But the first four? Can talk to ANYONE.

So! If you are having troubles with a character, and want to get them out but for whatever reasong can't get conversations that last, or find someone who can make an impression on your character, leave me a note here. Preferably leave me a note with a LINK TO WHERE THAT CHARACTER IS ACTIVE that I may poke you. I will basically go down my list of characters whenever I see them until something sticks. 

It's not enough, alone, to get or keep a character active in camp, but it might be the jump start you need to play them more."

"event","So here's the thing, I have, like I imagine many people do, a mental list of people I want to attack with certain characters, either for the first time or as a follow up to certain events. SOME PEOPLE talk to each other enough that it goes without saying. I. E. Canonmates are USUALLY a given except for the cases where I don't play that character enough (read: Riku) and then relationships like oh... Luke and Chizu-nee, or Luke or Eiko, Ed and Tomo etc. If I see these people I jump them by default. BUT, VERILY there are far too many people who don't fall into these default raping categories.

THIS, dear folks, is a list for my benefit (and yours! If you have any particular interest in playing with me, or even NOT playing with me!) of specific characters I want to throw specific characters at. MY GOAL is to be able to mark off at least one of these a day. And if things go well then, yanno, maybe the characters play more! If they don't click I can either try again later or maybe switch the characters around.

THAT ALL SAID. If you have any desire for me to ninja you completely out of the blue (read: whenever I see you) let me know here. Request any character! I WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN. Similarly, if you see your characters on my list and would rather I don't ninja you, by all means, lemme know and it uh, won't happen? =D

-Luke did, at one point, think Guy was his mom when he was being raised. Only not by the <i>word</i> but in concept. It was a while before he got everything straightened out.

-Luke is an original bedninja, and slept with Guy fairly frequently until Duke Fabre decided Luke was forming an unseemly attachment to servants and started forbidding Guy to be in his room unless he was doing his duties, and eventually at all.

-Despite actually being a very capable with both reading and writing, Luke has no interest in the former. He'd let Guy read to him mostly for the time spent with Guy, but reading about the outside world that he couldn't visit always made Luke grumpy for days.

-Though he liked almost all of his servants, Luke could never keep the names of all the maids straight, and ultimately stopped caring around the time he started becoming a brat.

-Luke wouldn't have anything against technology if Guy didn't make such weird faces when he talked about it.

-Until he was fifteen or so, Luke tried to escape the manor fairly regularly. He never made it more than a few feet past the threshold but he gave the entire staff hell for years with his trying. The one time he DID manage to get out the door involved setting fire to Pere's flower beds in the summer. He got in a LOT of trouble over that one and, to be fair, felt pretty bad about the flowers.

-Despite his attempts to escape the manner, he never raelly intended to run AWAY. He just wanted to escape for a while and show everyone he would be <i>fine</i>.

-And despite the above claims, if he HAD managed to escape he would have been terrified but too stubborn to show it.

-Luke got his six pack when he was fourteen, courtesy of doing situps constantly for a month in order to impress Master Van.

-Luke never exercised until Master Van started teaching him the sword, and then he did it a LOT.

-Luke has no concept of treating children like children. To be fair, the youngest person he ever met was Anise. And then the next youngest person he met was Eiko. As far as Luke is concerned, everyone is equal; servants, kings, and six year olds.

-Luke also has no concept of money, and yet is remarkably good at making it.

-On nights when he has particularly bad nightmares, Luke sometimes kinda wishes he were still young enough to bed ninja Guy.

-The image on the back of Luke's jacket is something he scribbled out when he was fourteen or so, thought was cool, and demanded the maids sew it into the back of his jacket. This is another failed attempt to impress Master van.

-Speaking of Master Van, Luke still loves and respects him, so hah.

-Luke has 0 desire to be King, but he does think it would be a good way to help make the world a better place.

-Luke has accepted the fact that he's stupid and gotten over it, this is basically a requirement for being friends with Jade.

-Luke doesn't actually REMEMBER when Guy's birthday is, but he has it written down... somewhere.

-Meanwhile he doesn't even bother trying to remember Natalia's because everyone in the manor, not to mention Natalia herself, lets him know way ahead of time.

-Despite his reservations about technology, Luke would love video games, and be good at them.</lj-cut>"

"event","<b>Clothing/appearance:</b>
Unless otherwise noted, Luke is dressed <a href=""http://img181.imageshack.us/img181/9914/mediumanimepaperscanstagr1.jpg"" target=""_blank"">like this</a> at all times. He sleeps in it too. It never gets wrinkled or dirty due to game logic. Or maybe Guy is just a laundry ninja, I'm not sure.

<b>Habits/mannerisms/body language:</b>
Luke has Gay Hand Gestures. I have, unfortunately, not been able to icon any very well, but he puts his hand on his hip and does that hand flippy thing a lot when he talks. It's not CONSTANT it's just one of his habits.

Luke tends to keep his own bubble. You know, that typical safe distance of however much you can stand next to someone without it being weird. But he doesn't MAINTAIN his bubble, and touchy people can hang off of him, hug him, boobsquish him et al and he'll only really resist the last one (and only belatedly). Luke himself is not particularly touchy and will only hug or touch someone when he feels especially moved to, usually in moments of extreme happiness for him/extreme sadness for others. But really, he's kind of like a whining doormat and you can do whatever you want to him.

LUKE MAKES FACES. See <img src=""http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/57611636/12143759""> <img src=""http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/57611924/12143759""> 
Despite how disinterested he LOOKS there, he's not... really. These are basically his default faces, when he's discussing stuff. If he's in a good mood he'll smile, but despite being Happy Happy Luke now, he still doesn't smile all that much.

<b>Current Residence:</b>
Amestris Dorms; rooms with Caesar, Hugo and Guy

<b>Typical Daily Routine:</b>
Luke wakes up late pretty much every day. Typically Guy would have to wake him up, in which case he'll be awake before noon, but if Guy doesn't for some reason Luke takes a while to drag himself out of bed. He'll typically wake sometime between 10:30 and 12:00 but once he wakes up he'll get up almost immediately. Luke's kinda prissy about cleansliness and takes a shower every day, though not always in the morning. He eats in the cafeteria for all meals.

As far as what he does all day... visits people, mostly. He'll drop by Guy and Harold fairly often and hang out until the stench of technology drives him away. Otherwise? If you're one of his friends assume he drops by to see you. He has a kind of MENTAL LIST of people he makes a point to visit because they're grumpy and lonely and need friends, right now that's Luc, Manji, and Gokudera. Otherwise he wanders around camp and talks to people, checks things out, and makes himself useful where he sees an opportunity. Sometimes he just zones out staring at the sky. He's fairly bored a lot, but he's used to it.

<b>Favourite Haunts:</b>
The Amestris Dorms, wherever Harold stays, pretty much any place that is outdoors.

<b>Does he make his own bed?:</b> 
lol no"

"event","<lj-cut text=""Meeting More Replicas"">It sounds weird to say I've been here for 'a while' when just about everyone I've talked to says they've been stuck here for at least a year. But still feels like it. I guess I just got so used to traveling all over the place. And I can't say being here is just like being trapped back in the manor anymore. There's so much going on all the time that it still almost <i>feels</i> just as busy as flying all over Auldrant in the Albiore.

Anyway, now that it's been a while I think I'm getting more used to it. Something crazy is still always going on, but I think my head's cleared a little since I got here. It's like I was just constantly dizzy for the first week. It's kind of like when I left my manor for the first time, only now I care enough to try to pay attention to it all. It's pretty hard to follow most of it, but it actually helps if I keep reminding myself that I'm already on a different planet. It doesn't seem like it has to make as much sense then.

So now that it feels like things are slowing down more, or maybe I'm just keeping up better, I don't really have as much to write about either. But I met <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3396079.html?thread=857127151#t857127151"" target=""_blank"">Tomo and her boyfriend, Sano</a> at his birthday party. Or at least I <i>think</i> that's what it was. Tomo was saying something about him not being older after all. Probably some weird custom? Or maybe you can't really have a birthday one a planet with a completely different calendar? And then I picked up a <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3391463.html?thread=854544359#t854544359"" target=""_blank"">whistle</a> from a boy here that was handing them out, only now I can't find it. I probably lost it behind the bed somewhere. I'll look for it later, I haven't had a whistle since I was a kid.

I got to experience my first really weird 'camp thing' since I got here. It was pretty weird, but not actually all that exciting except that I got meet a bunch of people. It would've been better to turn into a girl.

Anyway, I was... <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3410651.html?thread=866366939#t866366939"" target=""_blank"">stuck to a bunch of other people</a>. I don't know how it worked, but everyone was saying something about magnets. I <i>thought</i> that only had to metal, but even if we weren't wearing metal all of us were sticking together! And people kept coming <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3410651.html?thread=866432219#t866432219"" target=""_blank"">flying</a> out of no where until they'd get stuck with the rest of us. Only it wasn't everyone in camp, not even close, so while we were all 'sitting' there we tried to figure out why it was just us.

Well, <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3410651.html?thread=866373083#t866373083"" target=""_blank"">the other replica</a> was there and I got to talk to him for a little while, but he wasn't much help. It did make me wonder if us being replicas had something to do with being stuck there though. But I figured there's no <i>way</i> there are that many of us in this place.

I also met <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3410651.html?thread=866389723#t866389723 "" target=""_blank"">Rey</a>, who says he was the start of the... uh... 'magnet'. He was pretty calm about suddenly having a bunch of people stuck to him though. I wonder if that's what happens if you're here too long? Like I needed any <i>more</i> incentive to leave.

The other two people I met were <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3410651.html?thread=866375643#t866375643"" target=""_blank"">Sasarai</a> and <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3410651.html?thread=866381275#t866381275"" target=""_blank"">Luc</a>. 

Luc is the friend of Tir, that guy I met who says he's sick and stay around people much. I wondered why he was okay with staying around Luc then, but actually I just wanted to meet him since I've never met anyone with the same name (even if it's spelled kind of different). He's 'deaged' right now though, which is what people here call it when someone is younger than he should normally be. Only Sasarai says he'd still in his twenties.

I talked to both of them about different things. <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3410651.html?thread=866847195#t866847195 "" target=""_blank"">Sasarai told me</a> that the reason they look my age even though they're (normally) thirty-two is because of something called a True Rune. I don't really know what it <i>is</I>, other than some kind of 'magic', which is like fonic artes, and it keeps them from turning old. I don't think it's meant for that though, since Sasarai says that there are only twenty-seven of them in his entire world. I also got the feeling it's pretty powerful? Sasarai said they were good or bad depending on who used it, and it reminded me of forbidden fonic artes Jade learned.

Anyway, at first I thought the two of them were just brothers. They look exactly a like, but they're not the only people here who do. But Sasarai said something that made me think he was a replica, and when I asked he confirmed it. Only it turns out Luc wasn't his original but they're both replicas. But even though they both have True Runes and are the same age and don't act like they're fighting, I don't think they really like each other either. I wonder if I'll ever get to meet any replicas that get along with each other, or their originals?

They really are pretty different though. I guess I shouldn't be too surprised, I'm only seven and Asch and I aren't <i>really</i> that much a like (no matter <i>what</i> Jade and Anise say) and they've had three decades to become different from each other. But Sasarai was really friendly and Luc... wasn't. I can't even say he reminded me of myself that much, though I guess he was kind of stuck up. He mostly just didn't seem like he was interested in anything. He kept saying that things didn't matter, or he didn't care or he didn't need to. The only thing he acted like it mattered at all was this stone tablet. I haven't seen it yet but Luc says it's his job, and that he would stay with it. He told me this when I really just wanted to make sure he had somewhere to stay (asking that's turned into a habit, actually. But it's something I can do. Sometimes it feels like that's the <i>only</i> thing I can do here). I tried to tell him he couldn't stay out there all night, even if he can take care of himself it'd still be ridiculous. It started snowing today out of no where, people can't just stand around all night in that!

I eventually found out the reason he doesn't want to sleep is because he has nightmares, or something like that. I can't really feel that bad for him though, not that I <i>like</i> my own nightmares, but you still have to deal with it and not sleeping isn't any way to do that. I kept trying to convince him to agree to sleep at night, and he finally said ""I'll think about it"" but I think he was just saying that to get me to leave him alone. Fine, it's not like I'm going to drag him to a bed or anything. 

...but if he's still out there when I go to bed I guess I'll at least bring him a chair. <i>That's</i> not interrupting his job, right?

I wonder if he's less obnoxious when he's older? 

Luc's not the only 'deaged' person I've met recently. Buffy was the first but now there's <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3410651.html?thread=866824155#t866824155"" target=""_blank"">Hellboy</a> and <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3413086.html?thread=868142942#t868142942"" target=""_blank"">Chris</a>. I was worried about Hellboy having a place to stay now that he's so little, but I found out he's been sleeping in the library. I was going to find him some place with a bed but he seemed pretty excited about find his own place, and I guess the library is probably as safe as a cabin. And Chris I haven't met when she's older, but I've noticed that the only times there are little kids around here is when they deage, so I guess that's what happened. She's got a lot of people looking after her though, probably including <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3413086.html?thread=868362334#t868362334"" target=""_blank"">Emperor Peony</a>.

The only other interesting thing that happened was I played a word game with <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3411540.html?thread=867214420#t867214420"" target=""_blank"">Chizuru</a>. It was pretty fun for a while but eventually got too personal so I gave up when I couldn't think of the right word anymore. I guess that's what happens when you say the first thing that comes to your mind, it's eventually going to come back to the things you're always thinking about. Even though she's pretty strange, even for a girl, Chizuru's really nice too. She kind of reminds me of Tear, because she cares a lot but hides a lot too? Maybe that's stupid, she and Tear don't really <i>act</i> anything a like. <i>Tear</i> never would have shoved me into her chest like that.

She would hit like that though. But then, so do Anise and Natalia.</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""A New Sidequest?"">I've finally seen the barrier. It's actually not invisible, even though I'm pretty sure someone said it was. When you can get close you can see a lot of different colors, a little like a reflection that's all messed up. I wasn't sure if I wanted to get near it, much less touch it. So I started by trying to see if I could make a hole in it with my hyperresonance. It didn't work, maybe I shouldn't have been but I was actually pretty surprised. I mean, I thought hyperresonance could destroy <i>anything</i>? I was able to use it to get rid of the miasma, so why not some stupid barrier? But I couldn't make a dent at all.

Nothing happened to me though, so after that I wasn't as worried. I tried using force and fonic attacks, but nothing would effect it. But you'd think that if the barrier could <i>really</i> do something to you, trying to destroy it would be bad enough, right? Only nothing happened to me. I didn't turn into a girl or an animal or anything, maybe everyone <i>was</i> pulling my leg about that. I guess hazing the new people is how they keep from getting bored around here.

Anyway, I've been trying to get out and meet more people, but I really haven't done much since I got here.

I played a game called <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3376525.html?thread=844650381#t844650381"" target=""_blank"">Apples to Apples</a> for a little while, but I didn't stay in it very long. I didn't understand a lot of what happening <s>and my mun got distracted</s>. Then, outside one of the cabins, there was <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3372851.html?thread=841941043#t841941043"" target=""_blank"">big robot</a>. I think that's the biggest one I've seen yet! Anyway, this guy made it to guard the cabin or something, he says his sister stays there. Maybe it's just the robots, but for some reason he kind of reminds me of Dist.

I talked to <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3374849.html?thread=843334913#t843334913"" target=""_blank"">Maya</a> again, and she says that her boss is going to get the people innocent for the murder out of here. I guess the director hired them for that? After trying to get through that barrier myself, I'm not sure I believe it, but I hope they can do something. Man... I feel pretty useless. Something like this should be easy after defeating Master Van. I wonder if Asch would be able to do it...?

I met two more people who don't have anywhere to stay. One a <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3377886.html?thread=845437918#t845437918"" target=""_blank"">girl</a> and then <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3373264.html?thread=842085840#t842085840"" target=""_blank"">a nice guy named Peter</a>. I don't know if either of them ever found a place to stay, but I think they must be running out beds around here. <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3377886.html?thread=845460446#t845460446"" target=""_blank"">Hugo says</a> he's been here for six months, and every month a new group shows up. I guess people do leave enough, or else they would have run out of places a long time ago, but if more are coming in then going out, it's got to fill up eventually, right? I talked to <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3377886.html?thread=845451486#t845451486"" target=""_blank"">Guy</a> about it, and he suggested we go door-to-door and find out who has more space. He didn't actually want to do it, but he can help anyway. We don't have anything else to be doing, right? And we might be able to help some people. I'm used to fighting monsters all the time, but this place wouldn't be safe for most people to sleep outside.
 
<a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3377886.html?thread=845451998#t845451998"" target=""_blank"">Good luck telling Emperor Peony that thought</a>. If I didn't know Jade wasn't a normal kid to start off with, it wouldn't be that surprising if it was from working for that guy for so long.</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""Learning New Things"">Today I was reminded again of how much I still don't know. I guess I'm pretty used to it by now, but after everything it feels like I've learned a lot, then I show up in a place like <i>this</i> and I don't get everything all over again.

Well, it turns out the reason Kazumi kept asking me if I liked Guy was because she thought I was sly. <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3366352.html?thread=839224272#t839224272"" target=""_blank"">Captain Reynolds</a> explained to me that 'sly' is when guys like each other the way they usually like girls. The normal way is 'straight'. I didn't believe him at first. It sounded like some kind of joke! But when he asked me why I didn't believe him I couldn't really say. I guess just because I've never heard of it. I didn't need Guy to tell me that men like women (...I think) so it's hard to believe I wouldn't notice something like that. It just... doesn't happen, right?

But he told me there were two guys here who were even <i>married</i>. By that point I pretty much believed him, but I wanted to make sure for myself anyway, so I went and talked to <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3371245.html?thread=840957421#t840957421"" target=""_blank"">Gwendal and Wolfwood</a>. And they really <i>are</i> married, and they're definitely both men.

I still can't say I really get it, and I don't see why people would keep thinking that about me and Guy. I'm not 'sly', and Guy's not either. But now that I know what they're talking about it doesn't really matter, I guess. Gwendal seemed to think I'd have something against him for it though? I wonder if it's something people don't want you to know? That'd explain why I've never even heard of it before.

Anyway, I met a couple more new people today. Didn't get either of their names though. The <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3368240.html?thread=839677744#t839677744"" target=""_blank"">first one</a> had a stick with wire on it he says he uses to catch fish. I wanted to see how he does it but I'm pretty sure the lake here isn't safe for that that kind of thing. It <i>glows</i>. The <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3369304.html?thread=840026968#t840026968"" target=""_blank"">other guy</a> was just a jerk who made fun of me for not trying to get out yet. I guess he's right though, I can't sit here and worry about not being able to leave when I haven't even seriously <i>tried</i>. I'll go the barrier tomorrow. At least I can take a look.

Oh, and there was <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3368240.html?thread=840453680#t840453680"" target=""_blank"">a dog</a> in the room when I got back. He's sleeping on the floor right now. I've never really had a pet or anything before, unless you count Mieu, who's <i>way</i> too annoying. But this one's not bad! He can understand me, but can't talk back. I wonder if all the animals around here can understand people? Anyway, I don't know his name yet, but I'll ask Hugo when he gets back.</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""Arrival at Camp"">Today I <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3366352.html#comments"" target=""_blank"">arrived</a> at Camp Fuck You Die. Despite the first impressions the name gave me, Anise says she <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3366352.html?thread=838169552#t838169552"" target=""_blank"">didn't have anything to do with naming the place</a>.

Anise isn't the only one here either. <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3366352.html?thread=837678544#t837678544"" target=""_blank"">I found Guy right away</a>. I'm glad... I mean, I want to see everyone again. But if I have to be stuck somewhere far away from home, Guy's definitely the person I'd want to be there with me.

And by 'far away from home' what I really mean is another planet. Man, even writing it down makes it hard to take seriously. I mean... I know now that the world is a big place, but... <i>other</i> worlds? A girl named <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3366352.html?thread=838125776#t838125776"" target=""_blank"">Chizuru</a> says she's never heard of Auldrant. But I guess even she had they wouldn't know it's called that, right? And <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3366352.html?thread=837693392#t837693392"" target=""_blank"">Namine</a> says that every star in the sky is another world. I wonder if that could really be true? I wish Jade was here. He'd know about it. He'd also probably know a way to <i>leave</i>.

Apparently there's a barrier around this place. <I>Everyone</i> told me about that, but no one could tell me how to leave. <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3366352.html?thread=837697232#t837697232"" target=""_blank"">Hisoka</a> says that people still manage to get out, it's just that no one knows how. I know we can find a way to get out of here! I... I know it sounds really childish, but I want to go home. I want to see Tear and Natalia and Mother and Father again. Even Jade.

Oh, that's right. Jade might not be here, but <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3366352.html?thread=837683920#t837683920"" target=""_blank"">Emperor Peony</a> is. Can you believe it? And he's apparently here on vacation! I'll have to remember to ask him later how he got here. Who leaves the <i>planet</i> for a vacation? Even I think that sounds pretty irresponsible for a ruler.

Uh... let's see. I met a lot of people today and I heard a lot of things. I'm not all that worried about losing my memory again anymore, but this is a lotl to take in, so I better write it all down.

A guy who looked like a little mouse named <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3366352.html?thread=837680592#t837680592"" target=""_blank"">Ari</a> was the first one to tell me that people can... change here. He says he's usually a boy, not a mouse, but the camp did something to him while he was taking a nap. And then I met <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3366352.html?thread=837733072#t837733072"" target=""_blank"">Buffy</a>, a cute little girl who says she's usually older. And <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3366352.html?thread=837747152#t837747152"" target=""_blank"">another girl</a> told me her friend, who's usually a guy, was a girl the other day. Stuff like that... it's pretty hard to believe. A day ago I would just be laughing about it. But even Guy wouldn't set me up for this kind of joke. ...how am I going to get back home?

I also met <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3366352.html?thread=837678032#t837678032"" target=""_blank"">Harold</a> and <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3366352.html?thread=837683408#t837683408"" target=""_blank"">Kazumi</a>. They're both pushy girls, but Kazumi is cool, I guess. Harold is just weird. She wants me to do all kinds of things for her, like fight robots and be examined, and she asks me lots of questions. She says it's because she's a scientist. I wonder if this what Jade would be like if he didn't already know everything?

Oh, yeah! Kazumi showed me pictures of Guy in a dress! I guess there are some girls here who do that to people? I should probably feel bad for him, I guess he was really freaked out. But it's really funny. Still, I'm going to have to be careful, I don't want that to happen to me.

Who else was there? <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3366352.html?thread=837689296#t837689296"" target=""_blank"">Eiko</a> is a friend that Anise made. She gave me play script to give to Anise later. And <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3366352.html?thread=837702864#t837702864"" target=""_blank"">Hellboy</a>... well. He looks like a monster. He didn't tell me exactly what he was, but it's not human. He's really nice though, even if he looks a little creepy, and he told me about how on his world people who are different like him are getting more rights to live like regular humans. I'm glad... Now I'm even more sure that replicas will be seen as humans if we just work hard to make people understand.

I didn't get the name of <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3366352.html?thread=837722320#t837722320"" target=""_blank"">the guy who explained the laptops to me</a>. But what he basically said was that I shouldn't trust them. Well, he doesn't have to tell me twice. I'll leave the fontech to guy. I'm not even going to use that thing. And after that I met <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3366352.html?thread=838026704#t838026704"" target=""_blank"">Captain Reynolds</a>. He's pretty much a jerk, and likes to make fun of me a lot. But I guess he's alright...

And then at the very end of the night a <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3366352.html?thread=838689232#t838689232"" target=""_blank"">couple of guys showed up</a> wanting to know if I was a 'camper'. Well, according to them I am, since I'm not twenty-two yet. But I didn't get why it mattered until they told me it's because the campers are suspected of murder. ...Eiko mentioned that earlier, and then got mad me for worrying about it too much. With the amount of people I've killed, I don't feel like I have much right to defend myself against this kind of thing. But... if this isn't even my planet, why am I being suspected for a murder that happened here? I have enough blood on my hands without adding the deaths of people on places I never could have even <i>got</i> to. I don't really know what they're planning to do, but I'm not going to let them tell me I'm guilty of a crime I didn't commit. But somehow, I don't think convincing them of that will get me out of here either.

I was on my way to bed, Guy says he has a room in some dorms here, when I ran into <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/campfuckudie/3366352.html?thread=838836944#t838836944"" target=""_blank"">Maya</a> and got called an alien again. Dammit... I guess it might be a little true, but it doesn't seem fair. I'm human, why should I have to be an alien too?</lj-cut>"

"event","<b>Name:</b> Luke fon Fabre
<b>Birthday:</b> Okay, Asch's birthday is Lorelei Decan, Rem 48. This is what Luke would celebrate. SO THERE. Lorelei Decan is the 13th month of the year, incidently.
<b>Age:</b> Physically 17
<b>Height:</b> 5'7"" NOT TALL
<b>Weight:</b> 150 lb. I- I have a character with a feasible canon weight. I knew this day would come ;.;
<b>Eyes:</b> Green
<b>Hair:</b> Red
<b>Medical Info:</b> HEALTHY AS A HORSE.
<b>Physical Traits:</b> Left handed. His hair does this thing, when it's long, where it fades off into a lighter color at the tips. His fonon frequency is PI this is cool really. Otherwise nothing really.
<b>What's Okay to Mention Around Him/Her:</b> For the sake of Luke's fragile grasp on reality and minimal spoiler issues, lets say nothing that wouldn't be semi-common knowledge from the game and no fourth wall stuff.
<b>Abilities:</b> By now a master of the Albert style artes, Luke can fuck your shit up with a sword pretty gosh darn well. But, as it is with all the ToA characters, he's a hell of a lot stronger in a group. However, out right whacking things with the pointy end is really all he's good for. Luke can't heal, and never learned to cast fonic artes. 
He CAN however create a really gosh darn powerful hyperresonance, a shiny an ability which can destroy and reform any kind of matter. ...he mostly uses this to write stuff in the sky =\ he won't use it in battle much because he doesn't like killing people.
Basically, he's a straight up fighter and perfectly capable of defending himself, but despite being a shounen retard isn't likely to try to solve things with violence, so I doubt it'll come much.
<b>Notes for the Psychics:</b> lol SPOILERS if this applies to YOU feel free to ping me. In a more GENERAL sense Luke is a fairly happy kid with a heavy underlying sadness and sense of responsibility.
<b>Can I shapeshift/bodyswap/spit at/step on/etc?:</b> ask/ask/yes/yes
<b>Maim/Murder/Death:</b> yes/no/no
<b>Cooking:</b> LUKE IS A MASTER CHEF... as long as you want him to cook something from Tales of the Abyss |D he has TWENTY MEALS HE IS VERY CAPABLE WITH and... that's it.

"event","<b>Name:</b> Luke fon Fabre
<b>Age:</b> 17
<b>Series:</b> Tales of the Abyss
<font size=""1""><i><b>Canon:</b> Despite being heir to the throne of his kingdom, Luke fon Fabre wasn't particularly good for much. He lost all of his memories at age ten and subsequently had to be raised from a know-nothing infant all over again, this time by his best friend, Guy Cecil. Initially this left him a stubborn, arrogant, whiny little brat who somehow still had enough self-esteem issues to blush furiously whenever anyone actually praised him. However, being chosen to save the world and forced to kill a few thousand people in the process has a way of humbling one, and over the course of the game Luke becomes one of the most generous, understanding and self-sacrificing people on the planet. 

New and Improved Luke wants to help you. Yes, you. He wants to do whatever it takes to make you happy. Fetch quests? At no additional charge! Save your city? Happily! Give you copious amounts of money to fund your frivolous dream of turning a giant mansion into a small amusement park? Nooo problemo. But despite growing up enough to take responsibility for... just about </i>everything ever<i>, Luke still only has seven years of memory behind him. Thus he can be not only unknowledgeable but very naive, something that tends to frustrate him. And since even dramatic life changes can't COMPLETELY wipe out the old, Luke is not at all above still being a whiny little wiseass. Just, you know, </i>while<i> he runs all over the world doing your errands for you.</i></font>


<b>Sample App:</b>


Well, this is just <i>great</i>. Good one, Luke. Barely on your own for a whole day, and you've ended up lost in a strange place without even the shirt on your back.

At least it was for a good cause, I guess. I'd never even thought about it before, but even plants must want to feel like someone cares about them -- why else would they get so lonely? I didn't really <i>mind</i> letting them pass me around for hugs... those are always nice. But they could've at least listened to me when I told them to be more careful about my clothes. I <i>liked</I> that shirt. As it is, I'm lucky I was able to get away before I lost my pants too. They must <i>really</i> not get that many visitors way out there, if they were that desperate.

Anyway, this is no time to be complaining about being underdressed, even if it is too cold to be walking around like this. I was told the people here need my help, and who knows how long they have before this disease eats them away completely? Uugh, I've never even <i>heard</i> of UST before! Why don't I ever know about the important things?! Guy could probably at least tell me something about it. I'll have to ask him later if there's any way to at least relieve the pain of the people suffering from it, even a little.

Really, the only thing I <i>do</i> know about UST is that it's supposed to be a disease that rots the brains. But I think whoever started that rumor got their facts mixed up a little. Their brains <i>definitely</i> aren't the only things rotting. That must be what goes first though, because I haven't heard any of them moaning ""aaaaaarrrmms"".

How does something like this even happen?! It's got to be because all these people are locked up together, right? They don't have any choice but to wait, while it spreads from one person to the next. But... that's <i>horrible</i>! I can't accept that all these people are going to get UST and just rot away, trapped here, begging for release.

I don't know if I can really be of any help -- I'm not even a healer. But I'll do whatever I can! Just tell me where I can lend a hand.

1.  I only meant that Sara can now join Lesa's club of disliking me because of LJ drama.  

2.  I never drew similarities between the two of them in any other way.  It was everyone <i>else</i> who jumped to that conclusion.  

3.  Jenny, Joanne, you both know that I haven't even mentioned Lesa in a year.  Why would I purposefully insult her in a public post?  Thanks for thinking that I'd suddenly feel the need to badmouth her in public after never saying a word about her to two people I <i>know</i> are her friends.  It's her life.  She can do whatever the hell she chooses.  I took myself out of the situation because I couldn't watch it happen anymore but I wish her no ill-will.

"event","1.  If you reach an answering machine, speak clearly.  Leave your name and phone number, even if you think I know who it is or already have your number.  Sometimes I forget my phone and check my messages from elsewhere, where your number is <i>not</i> programmed in.  

2.  If you are giving directions, be specific.  If you don't drive, give the damn phone to someone who does.  Landmarks are good things to include.  

3.  Don't back out of things at the last minute.  It's frustrating and fucks up everyone's plans.  Try to give at least 24 hours notice.  

4.  Don't come to my house, eat my food, and use my stuff only to later say that I'm selfish.  

5.  Get a room.  I don't care how cute you think it is, nobody wants to see that shit. 

6.  Do what you say you're going to do.  If you say you'll call, call.  If  you say you'll be somewhere, be there.  

7.  Don't forget about your friends the minute you get a significant other.  It makes us feel like we were only filling in until you found him/her.  

8.  Pay attention.  

9.  If you don't have a car, don't complain about my driving or the mess in mine.  And pitch in for gas if I'm picking you up, it's just polite.  

10.  Soap.  Toothpaste.  Deodorant.  Know them.  Love them.  Use them.  

11.  If you are a guest somewhere, clean up after yourself.  If you are at a restaurant, use your damn silverware (unless you ordered a burger or something like that).  I have an etiquette book I'll be happy to lend you if you are confused about any of this.

"event","Thanks for nothing?  OK.  How about this:  

Every day I face euthanasia.  Every day I face a room full of cats and kittens, dog and puppies just waiting for homes.  It never ends.  Sure, you may have homes for the 6 kittens your cat has..but what if she has 12?  And the 6 homes you find for them will mean 6 less homes for the <i>already</i> homeless cats in the shelter.  And when your friends use the same excuses you are and don't get their kittens spayed or neutered, we'll end up with 6 more, 16 more, 26 more, and it just keeps going.  

Fact:  A female cat and her offspring can produce up to a startling 420,000 kittens in just seven years.  Can you find homes for all of them, too?  

And when Loki isn't a good mom (as happens with many first cat moms), are you prepared to be up every 2 hours to bottle feed the kittens?  Are you prepared for the vet costs that may come up when she's stuck in labor for 26 hours?  What about when a kitten gets stuck halfway out and dies, keeping Loki in pain until you can find the time and the money to get her to a vet?  

It is less cruel to spay her 2 weeks before she's due than to expose her to the possibility of a painful death because of complications.  Also, she's never been vaccinated.  The chances of her having Feline Leukemia or Feline Immunodeficiency Virus are very high. These are diseases with no cure.  They will make her sick.  She will die if she has them.  Testing is an additional 20 dollars through the humane society.  

So don't give me that ""thanks for nothing"" crap.  Do my job for 1 week and you will understand.  Hell, volunteer at an animal shelter for 1 day and you will understand.

At around 11pm I decided I wanted to go out, so I left <lj user=""annamarie958""> a comment.  She agreed to come out with me.  I went to pick her up over in Lakewood, then drove down to Vinyl (it was their 18+ night and Jenny's only 20).  I'd never been to Vinyl before, but it was ok.  Enough space and a pretty eclectic crowd of people.  I didn't go upstairs because Jenny couldn't go and it's not cool to leave your friends alone.  The dj was ok.  Not great, just ok.  I think her name was SpaceGirl.  She spun mostly house, but threw in some trance, too.  Here's the kicker of the situation:  Apparently I'm a good dancer.  I had a few guys come up to me and tell me they liked my dancing and Jenny thought I was good too.  I dunno, I always thought I was <i>ok</i>, but not like great or anything.  Not someone that would get watched just for their dancing.  *shrug*  Whatever, I just like to dance, and I couldn't give a shit if I'm any good or not.  Anyhooooo, Jenny danced with some guy who was kinda cute and seems alright.  (Despite my attempt to rescue her when I misread her signal.  Oops! Sorry about that!)  Jenny had to go to work, so we jetted at last call (like 1:30).  It was a great night.  I had an awesome time.

15. Eww, there's an inch worm on your thigh. 
16. <b>Will it squeak if I squeeze it? </b>
17. Oh no, a flash headache. 
18. (giggle and point) 
19. Can I be honest with you? 
20. My 8-year-old brother has one like that. 
21. Let me go get my tweezers. 
22. How sweet, you brought incense. 
23. This explains your car. 
24. You must be a growing boy. 
25. Maybe if we water it, it'll grow. 
26. Thanks, I needed a toothpick. 
27. Are you one of those pygmies? 
28. Have you ever thought of working in a sideshow?

"event","Went to see <i> Mullholland Drive</i> tonight.  
1.  David Lynch is a crack smoking freak.  
2.  What the <i>fuck</i> was going on in that movie?  Seriously, even after I came home and read the salon.com synopsis/explaination thing, I'm still all weirded out by the movie.  Pieces of it just don't fit, don't make sense.  And, while it was a well made film, I really want to kick David Lynch in the junk and tell him to stop being so damn cryptic.  
3.  Cinema Grill is a cool place.  More comfortable than a typical movie theatre, decent food and you can order alcohol.  Only down side is that you can't smoke in there.  

That is all."

I had a good night. Very relaxing, laid back.  Went to shoot pool with a great friend.  Had amazing conversations over Killians and my horrid attempts at sinking the 8 ball.  I swear, I used to be decent at pool.  I have no idea what happened.  Reverse gravitational pull of the Earth...or something.  

So.  I'm taking the job in Lakewood.  I've made my final decision.  Need to call them tomorrow, I guess.  I just hope they don't want me to start on Monday.  Er...Maybe I'll just call on Monday.  That'd ensure my not having to start then.

Yah.  Now I have nothing to be stressed about.  Exam's over, I have good job offers, Chazzbear might be here soon.  All good things.  

Methinks I will have a hot pocket.  And then a nap.  I have an utter lack of responsibility until at least Monday.  This makes me quite happy.  

And <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/sickoftraveling"">somebody</a> has some explaining to do.  Get in touch kiddo.  

Who wants to come out with me tonight?  Anyone feel like meeting me for a drink later?"

Studied for 4 hours today.  
Mildly freaking out.  
Need sleep.
Can't wait for this all to be over.  

I bought a thing of mixed fruit mentos for the exam tomorrow.  I guess I need to stop eating them now.  And I bought new pencils.  Bic mechanical pencils with #2 led and brand new white erasers.  It's kind of a tradition for me.  I always buy new pencils before big exams.  Does it help?  It helps my psychosis, and that's all that matters.  

I'm going to go smoke a few cigarettes and then force myself to bed.  Wish me luck.

Do I take it?  It's a clinic that is a little behind the times currently, but they are working with a top notch consultant and expanding and restructuring the whole place to make it cutting edge.  There is lots of opportunity for growth in this practice.  All that and it's only about 25 minutes from my current apartment.

In other news:  
Talked to Chazzbear for a while.  Almost have him convinced to drop everything and come out here quick-like.  So we'll both be broke for a while.  So we'll hate living in this little one bedroom apartment for a while.  But it won't be for long.  No bringing dates home for either of us whilst doing this, if it really happens.  I'm trying not to get my hopes up.  Also talked to Kyle for a bit.  Something about Vegas for a few months, then here.  I don't understand him.  I think it has something to do with the fact that Kyle's logic is just a little skewed.  If there is any logic in his actions at all.  I'm hoping that if Chazz comes out here soon it'll speed Kyle up.  I miss those guys.  

Yeeeeeeeah.  National exam on Friday.   I've studied a bit.  It's amazing how a 200 question multiple choice exam can dictate the rest of my life.  Breathe. Just Breathe.  I need a hug.  And someone to kiss my forehead and tell me that everything's ok.  

Blah blah blah.  I plan on being plastered somewhere on Friday night.  I just need to find someone to drive.  I need friends who like to club.  

I guess that's all."

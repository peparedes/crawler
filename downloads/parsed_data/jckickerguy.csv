"event","anyways, i had quite the morning.  here's how it goes.  my dad was in the shop and i was outside doing some stuff.  we were moving some machinery around and i hear something really loud.  i look out to the road and there is a fire truck flipping on the road/side ditch.  yup.  total craziness.  i yell at my dad to call 911 and i run out there and SOMEHOW both guys in it get out and seem to be fine.  it was the burlington fire department's tanker truck, so then all the water spilled out and went everywhere and the truck is completely demolished and since it was a fire department truck it was a big deal.  russiaville fire department came, tow trucks, ambulances, and police people and yeah.  it was an eventful morning.  not to mention we were supposed to have a semi come today to pick up some stuff.  so that got delayed until the mess could be cleaned up.  the road is open again but there is still some cleaning to do.  so that jacked stuff up for several hours.  soo..... if you live in burlington and your house is burning, you're pretty much screwed until someone else gets there.  i think we got some pictures so maybe i'll post them sometime.  oh well. lunch break is over, time to go outside again.  its hot outside."

"event","mmm.... its been forever.  so here's a quick recap.  i worked for the past ummmm long while.  and i'm going to work for the next.... long while.  i've hung out with burnie a lot.  and blakey some.  because he's always with jess.  umm...  went to indy with burnie and antao.  that was definately interesting.  and led to some very interesting conversations that we aren't repeating.  the geek squad at best buy is worthless.  our managers are dumb.  people that think that you can only have creationism OR evolution are retarded.  christians that say creationism is right but evolution is wrong are retarded.  go ahead.  argue with me.  christians that believe we shouldn't explore outer space - retarded.  umm...  people that claim to be christians but they make up their own rules that have no biblical backing - retarded.  people that claim to be christian but only want to follow certain parts of it - example: ""i am a christian.  homosexuality is the coolest thing since batteries.""  ummm...  oh.  to clarify.  believing in God does not make you a christian.  in case you were confused.  it takes more than that.  so yeah.  a lot of religious stuff has been ticking me off lately.  burnie and i are hardcore.  we're pretty much the hardest core people in the world.  either that or the most hard core.  but hardest core sounds better.  blake and i and jess and maybe other people watched band of brothers and blake saw a milipede thing or whatever and freaked out.  so basically the way i see it, someday blake is going to be in a jungle with the army and they are going to get attacked by a huge bear.  and everyone will freak out and run and blake will be like, ""psh, its only a bear.""  and he'll shoot it in the head and go on like normal.  but then when they camp he'll lay down and a spider will crawl on his arm and he'll pass out or something and everyone will laugh at him.  anyways, its time to do other stuff.  fair well!  or fare well.  it actually works both ways."

"event","anyways, its been a while.  i thought i should take it upon myself to tell the world that best buy is pretty much the worst ran company in the world.  at least the kokomo store is.  so yeah.  we are in the red.  as usual.  and have been for like 9 months.  so we REALLY suck bad.  actually, its more like the gm is horrible and 90% of the sales people have no clue what they are doing, whether its jacking orders up which ticks customers off or they just don't know crap and lie about the product or whatever.  they need to just fire everyone and start over.  getting back to the point...  we are doing horrible.  so we are pulling ideas from our butts to make money.  we are now doing car washes and detailing!!!  so... best buy, being the 22 billion dollar company that it is, sets up a tent in the parking lot, holds the tent down with 6 five gallon buckets full of cement, runs a hose across the parking lot, and calls it a car wash!!  its about as professional as a fund raiser.  which is what it is because we suck so bad.  oh.  and we are in the red, so of course we hire 2 new people JUST TO WASH CARS ALL DAY.  yeah.  chad is a moron.  oh well.  thats all for right now.

"event","anyways, i missed derek's livejournal post about vehicles.  so here is my opinion.  ha.  in the truck genre, you aren't going to beat a new superduty.  no way.  if you'd just forget your brand loyalty crap and just compare vehicles, the new superduty owns.  in the car genre, gm definately wins this one.  why?  they have all the pontiac cars like the grand am and grand prix and g6 and stuff.  and the impalas and corvettes and yeah.  they win that hands down.  oh.  they have the saturn cars with the performance switch.  you can't tell me thats not cool.  so yeah.  in other news, best buy, aka the big blue box, is now the big blue hell.  don't go there.  ever.  prices are cheaper online for the same if not better product.  they rip you off and you don't even know it!  90% of the salesman lie out their butts just to make a sale.  and luke stone is an idiot.  if you know him, you'll agree.  thats it."

Born on the 7th day of month gives you a tendency to be something of a perfectionist and makes you more individualistic in many ways. 

Your mind is good at deep mental analysis and complicated reasoning. 

You are very psychic and sensitive, and you should usually follow your hunches. 



You may not take orders too well, so you may want to work alone or in a situation where you can be the boss. 

This birthday gives a tendency to be somewhat self-centered and a little stubborn.</td>

so you might sarcastically say, ""carter is just always right about everything in the world.  lol.""  nah.  i don't know everything in the world.  i'm just the only one that has the balls to say things from a realistic point of view instead of trying to please everyone.  if what i say will piss someone off, i'll say it anyway as long as its true.  i'm not going to lie to make poeple happy.

"event","another thing that ticks me off:  ""God knows everything.""  ""God does not know whats going to happen in my life.""

these statements are very contradictory to each other.  yet some people believe both.  impossible!  some people say that if God knew what was going to happen in your life, it would take away the surprise.  it would mean that all of your decisions were pre made and you were just playing a role instead of doing what you want to do.  false!  look at it this way.  for christmas and your birthday, your parents probably get you presents.  your parents know what gifts they bought for you, but you don't.  does that make you angry? do you hate your parents because you don't know what you're getting?  i don't think so.  you are usually excited and can't wait to see what you got.  in the same way, each day is a gift from God.  we don't know whats going to happen, but He does.  april 24th is a gift! yay!! may 17th is a gift! yay!!  so should we be mad that we don't know whats going to happen?  no, we should be happy and full of excitement for awesome gift.

"event","so yeah.  i got decently bored before spanish class. and i was talking to burnie about gay bands that bash the government and stuff.  and i got to thinking about ""rock the vote.""  i went to their website and wow.  its quite humorous.  so yeah.  i'm going to post about it.

to start off, rock the vote is pretty gay. sure the whole getting younger people to vote is awesome, but they are still gay!!  as i quote, ""While young adults struggle to get on a career path, they are relegated to part-time and temporary jobs that lack benefits, good pay and basic rights. Many are borrowing heavily: for 18-24 year olds, credit card debt increased by 104% in the last decade.""  

lets break this down.  they are using it as an attack against bush saying we need more jobs for younger people.  i for one would rather have more jobs for older people THEN for kids.  i'd rather my parents have a job before i have one :)   but yeah.  a part time job that has full benefits? wtf?  stupid democrats.  that isn't going to happen.  it'd cost WAY to much.  and i think they are saying the reason 18-24 year olds have a lot of credit card debt is because they don't make enough money.  i may be wrong, but i'm pretty sure its because they are spending to much.  i wish i was a democrat now.  that way i could buy a mcclaren f1 on my best buy part time salary!!!  yeah baby.  then just tell the bankers that its okay, i'm not paid enough.

another ""Cost of Education: Debt for college students is climbing. For the nearly two thirds of college students who graduate with student loan debt, the average burden nearing $19,000. That's nearly as high as the national average family debt burden. Meanwhile, 22% of high school graduates are unable to attend a four-year college due to cost. Many young adults leave school with debt, but without a diploma. Just over one-third of those who left school without completing a degree had borrowed between $10,000 and $20,000.""

ha.  so basically, its saying college costs to much.  alright, sure it does.  but someone has to pay for it.  the government?  i checked, there are 314,000 college students in indiana.  and the average is 19,000 dollars a year.  divided that by indiana's 6.1 million people, and its about 1,000 dollars.  how many of you want to pay 1,000 PER PERSON more in taxes?  and the people that left school without a diploma but have a debt, maybe you should've stayed in school!  and there are CRAPloads of aid and scholarships.  don't take this to mean that everyone can get them, but there are a lot.  but gosh darn it.  the money has to come from somewhere!!!  it seems that democrats want to just pull money out of their butts to pay for crap.

there is more, but i'll move on.  look at the list of celebrities supporting rock the vote.  ashlee simpson, jessica simpson, lindsay lohan, brittany spears, the douchebag michael moore, and more.  how many of you would listen to them for advice?  i wouldn't.  they want publicity(except michael moore who is just a flaming homo).  sure there are big name bands and such, but why would you listen to them?  sure people go out and buy a certain toothbrush because juan rico suave charles says so, but why!?  get your own opinion people.  yeah so the elections are over.  and rock the vote failed!!! so gay so gay.  and why did it fail?  the young people that actually would listen to the celebrities are to young to vote.  so wow.  maybe america is smart afterall.

that is all.

p.s.  john travolta and john goodman and bruce willis and chuck norris aren't rock the vote partners.  if they were, then i may reconsider.....

p.p.s.  technically, rock the vote was just about getting people to the polls.  subliminally, they wanted you to vote against bush.

so screw anyone that bashes the government!!! (including green day!)"

1.  people that over analyze the situation.  just take it as it is....
2.  people that think to highly of themselves, or think they are something special when they aren't.  they might be alright, but nothing spectacular...
3.  gay comments.  like literally gay.  its starting to get REALLY annoying.  the random shouts of ""i'm going to suck your dick"" in public or whatever.
4.  hype.  simple as that.
5.  people that think they are better than everyone else.  same as 2, but it REALLY ticks me off and needs to be on here twice.
6.  people that try to be a hero figure one day, and a douche bag another.  whats with that?
7.  the quote ""its only a sin if you believe it is""  or ""its only a sin if you feel guilty doing it.""  i'm not going to say the name of the person that said it because it would start a really huge debate and make lots of people angry.  but its one of the things that helped start our super secret club.

EDIT******
8.  PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE ANY FREAKIN RESPECT.  yeah.  some people know what i'm talking about.

Troy was on, and guess what.  it was horrible.  total waste of 2.5 hours.  so yes, it is now the worst movie ever.  holy crap.  they tried to sum up a 10 year war into about 4 battles and 5 days.  if you didn't know any greek mythology, you'd think that the battle only lasted a week!  noo....  and what is up with achille's jump attack? its all he does.  so yeah.  troy is number last on my list.  we'll see what happens to the list after i see chronicles of riddick.  some people say is good, but people that i trust more to give an unbiased opinion say it sucks.  so the next time i get bored, i'll watch it.  anyways.... go patriots!!!!!!!!"

"event","such a sad past few days.  corey the gay kid traded in the best vehicle in the world.  the nissan was indeed the greatest performance vehicle EVER.  and extremely reliable.  and awesome offroad.  it will definately be missed.  however, it wouldn't have had to be missed if corey didn't trade it in for a vehicle that doesn't even come close to matching the pimpness of the nissan kingcab...

i love you nissan!! wherever you are!!

"event","yeah.  i love showers.  i do my best thinking in the bathroom.  that includes showering and..... you know.  so yeah.  i don't know why these ideas pop into my head.  but it occurred to me.  technology sucks.  let me outline it for you:

1. day by day, we discover new things, make new technologies.
2. day by day, we extend the life span of humans

so.... we live longer and longer, but at the same time, have more things to waste our life on.  if you subtract all the time we waste in our lives due to entertainment (computers, games, television, movies), we probably have just as much time as people did way way way in the past.  only back then, when you died at like 40, you felt like you had done something with your life.  you worked hard, provided for your family, and just felt proud of yourself.  what about now?  most people spend 20ish years educating themselves so they can spend the next 35 or so years hating all that they do, just so they can make enough money to be old.  yeah.  plus, all this technology makes things so easy for us.  most poeple have no sense of hard work.  and so we die feeling like we wasted our lives.  and we pretty much did.  blah.


p.s.  yup, i totally wasted part of my life on this gay livejournal thing!"

"event","howdy hey!! it seems that my livejournal has been quite the attraction as of late.  let me recap quickly.  i said a comment.  i thought nothing of it.  no problem.  it was taken out of context.  people got mad.  there.  darn good summary.  but... if you thought the first one was bad, this one might be worse.  ready? GO!

to derek:  i'm sorry you were brought into this.  it was all meant as a joke.  however, i am not trying to blame anyone.  i said a comment and thought then, as well as now, that it was rather innocent.  i'm sorry that you did not find it to be that way.

to lindsay:  say what you want.  if you want to blow stuff out of proportion, okay.  have a problem with what i said? tell me.  ""hey jeff, i don't like what you said. i think it is disrespectful.""  then i say, ""sorry.  i didn't realize that it could or would be taken like that.""  i stand firmly by what i say in this post.  i'm sorry you feel that i was rude.  but one request.  get to know me before you judge me.  btw, you pinpointed nothing about what REALLY needed to be said.

k. that is done.  so basically the whole phone call and waking people up thing is not an issue anymore.  if that was it, i guarantee that people would unanimously agree with me that when you get woken up and don't want to, you aren't happy.

i suggest you stop reading here.

if you don't want to stop, then alright.  i tried to stop you.

so the issue at hand is whether or not jokingly saying you are going to shoot someone is okay.  personally? i could care less.  other people feel that it is inappropriate because jon committed suicide.  okay.  suicide to me is absolutely retarded.  i don't care how bad you feel, its not worth it.  so okay.  suicide = stupid.  simple.  but anyways, people still do kill themselves.  alright.  that sucks.  its a very sad thing that they feel they had to do that.  i lose a lot of respect for someone that ""takes the easy way out.""  they had a life to live, but didn't want to live it.  guess what.  we can't change that now.  i think it was stupid of it to happen, but dang it, i am not going to let my life revolve around it.  if someone dies in an accident or something, thats different.  they wanted to live their life and had goals, but now they are no more.

so you say saying i'm going to shoot someone is disrepectful or whatever.  what makes jon's suicide more special than all the others?  because it was someone that you knew of?  a lot of people have died.  okay... so why start with this now?  and just where do you draw the line?  not eating is disrespectful of starving people.  causing people to be mad is disrespectful because they might go off and kill themselves.  not wearing a jacket when its cold out could be disrespectful of homeless people that can't stay warm.  drinking alcohol for fun is disrespectful of ruined families of alcoholics.  am i being irrational? i think not.  just where do you draw the line?  and how many of us have said a fat joke or made fun of someone for being fat, even if it was jokingly.  EVERYONE.  okay.  so can people please stop with random crap? reading a comment, taking it out of context, and then coming up with a GAY excuse?  oh look.  i said gay.  i offended homosexuals.  we should stop that too.

excuses really irk me.  one of my biggest pet peeves is ""racism"".  hear me out on this one.  whenever something bad happens to a minority, the first thing that comes up is racism.  oh they are being discriminated against.  or parents that say ""oh no my kid did something wrong but i can't punish him or that'd be mean.""  blah blah blah. GOSH DARN IT.  TAKE SOME FREAKIN RESPONSIBILITY.  which brings us to this.  ""you can't say that because its disrespecful!""  bull crap.  excuses are retarded.  will the events of the past days change me? probably not.  k. let me fix that.  definately not.

so la la la.  other people are telling me what i can/can't say.  alright.  so i get told that because i'm the one that said it and someone misread it.  but i'm by far not the only that has said things like this.  people that tell other people what they can't say are guilty also.  i am! you are! so and so is!  alright.  so... we are all guilty.  we all say the things that are explained above.  want to get mad at me? then by golly you'd better be mad at yourself also.  want to hate me anyway? go ahead.  if you can't handle the truth, then that's your problem.  i just presented this stuff. its up to you to decide if you want to open your mind and take it in.  i've read and reread this, and i believe it 100%.  i've also had other people give me their opinion on it.  so if you have a problem with it, then alright.  but i present no problems or dispute here.  if you blow it out of proportion, its your fault.  and please don't call me immature ever again.  i'm mature when i need to be.  wait.  if you knew me, you'd know that.  i'd like to see you come up with something like this.

p.s.  if you criticize me in the future, make sure you aren't guilty of what you accuse me of."

"event","hey all!  its been forever since i've posted.  and no one reads this anyway.  i'm just mega bored.  could do homework, but come on.  that'd be the smart thing to do.  anyways.... i took my physics exam tonight.  that was fun.  if anyone can tell me how the crap a massless object (gamma ray) can have momentum, let me know.  think i got it though.  totally skipped my chem lab today.  they drop your lowest score, and since i've gotten a's on all of them and this is the last one so....... yeah.  awesome reasoning.  so now that i'm done with exams, its pretty much all downhill from here.  just lots of review.  and finals.  screw finals.  why does everyone get worked up about them?  if you actually paid attention in class and learned as you went along, then you don't need to cram at the last minute.  and if you don't know it by now, then chances are you won't remember it after you cram either.  you'll just forget it after the exam.  so yeah.  finals shouldn't be stressed about.  blakey pooh comes home in like 2 weeks 1 day and 12 hours.  ha.  yeah.  umm.... my birthday is 1 month 6 days away.  ummm.... my jaw surgery was 1 year 12 days ago.  which, my jaw is jacked up again i think.  an epson printer attacked me at best buy over break.  so i kicked it.  sidenote, don't by epson printers there for awhile, they might be broke.  but then again, everything in the store gets tossed around a lot so oh well.  maybe you shouldn't know that....  anyways, now my jaw pops a lot and hurts.  go figure.  and.... my physics class got cancelled tomorrow.  and i haven't been to chem in forever.  so i only have 1 class at 10:30, then i'm done for the day.  i love days like that.  just more time for studying!!!(games)  btw, i think playing half life 2 totally qualifies as physics homework.  since the physics engine is so darn good.  yay they finally made homework fun!!!  oh well.  time to go off and do something else."

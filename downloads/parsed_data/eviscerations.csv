The sea is freed from icy chains
Winter is letting go

Oden! Guide our ships
Our axes, spears and swords
Guide us through storms that whip
And in brutal war

Our ships await us by the shore
Time has come to leave
Our country, family and homes
For riches in the east

Some of us won't return
But that won't bring us down
Our fate is written in the web
Woven by the Norns

A ram is sacrificed
Across the longship's bow
And as we set our sails
A strong breeze starts to blow

It carries us out to sea
With hope of fame and pride
And glorious all will be
That with sword in hand will die

Philip isn't hiding out or waiting for the right moment to speak, he's in Texas right now searching for answers to this tragedy the best he can. There was one thing he asked of me, that I humbly bring to you all:

i saw slayer in wyoming, of all the places in the world. i got to stand right at the front of the stage on the left (facing out from stage), and got to see fear factory and kilgore open. ff is like definately in my top 10, and kilgore was a new band i just heard. i stood in the pit for almost 4 hours, getting beat to death by big huge metalheads, and damn near passed out from being crushed against the barricade. that was possibly the best show ive ever seen.

im glad to see, along with all the bullshit, that the town is changing. 

now if everyone would stop being dumb and hitting up all the time, something might eventually happening that billings wouldnt be a bad place to be.

my head is fucked up, has been for years, since the accident. i remember how things used to be, how i used to be. 

how i am different...

im having problems with my kidneys. it started with the salmonella poisoning, and since its been worsening. im not saying this to be funny. my pee smells of arsenic or something, and my kindneys hurt to the touch.

i can feel that supposed lump on my left pelvic bone the doctors told me about after the accident. it is noticeable.

im much weaker than i was even 6 months ago.

nobody loves me anymore.

i went around a bit while i was in billings, to some familiar places. memory lane if you will. it seems so distant, like an afterthought. my memories are fading, for lack of new ones to be had. thinking about the past isnt enough to keep it preserved. 

im waiting for that moment of clarity.

some have said i am my own obstacle, that i stand in my own way when it comes to success. if only they saw as i see, that there is no success.

i want babies, big house with a pickett fence, and a dog. i want what i cant have, and it wont be long before the opportunity is gone.

Never mind how much it costs, you copped the best weed to smoke
And for her a fur coat
You got jet skis and boats
And next thing you're broke (damn)

every single day here in america, this country slides further and further down the road to tyranny. we are living in a police state. september 11 didnt happen the way that the mainstream media and the federal government wants us to believe. george bush and his administration green lighted the terrorist attack in manhattan, not unlike they did in waco texas, or oklahoma city.

evidence? it is everywhere you look. for instance, there were 12 surveillance cameras surrounding the a p murroh federal building in oklahoma city. the federal government confiscated all of the tapes, and when they put mcveigh on trial, refused to allow the footage into evidence, citing national security. no fucking way a fucking truck bomb, in a ryder truck, would blow a building in half like that. those were internal explosions. prove me wrong. please.

more evidence? the pentagon, sept. 11, 2001. supposedly, a boeing 757 crashed into the side of the building, yet, it is plain to see to anyone willing to look at the photos, there is no evidence that a 115 foot wide (wingspan), 45 foot high (tail), crashed into the pentagon. look at the photos. there is no wreckage from a plane outside the building. 86 million btu, thousands of gallons of jet fuel, wouldve burned everything it came in contact with. yet if you examine photographic evidence, you can see with the visible eye, on any still or video, from any media agency, that the hole in the side of the pentagon was no larger that 65 feet wide, and 55 feet high. look for yourself. right on the inside of the building, perfect condition furniture, computer monitors, filing cabinets. certainly, these items would be cooked to an unrecognisable state by the 3000+ degree temperatures generated by thousands of gallons of burning jet fuel.

the planes that hit the world trade center. more evidence here. why, when they impacted the building, was there an explosion at the nose of the plane? well, to ignite the jet fuel coming in behind the fuselage. building number 7, wtc. never impacted by any aircraft or any other objects, came down like it was scheduled for demolition, a process which takes weeks of planning to prepare and execute. yet, the building came down, 9/11/01, and it went like clockwork. federal officials, caught on camera saying they decided to ""pull"" that structure. how could they ""pull"" it, unless they had already set it up prior to the attack.

the patriot act is an evisceration of the constitution and the bill of rights. all cell phones produced after 2001 are required to have satellite tracking systems in place so they can keep tabs on us. in washington dc, government schools are forcing kids to get id badges, and use thumb print recognition systems just so they can have lunch. throughout texas, there are military training excersizes under way to prepare the marines, local police, and other government assets for the eventuality of placing american civilians into nazi-esque slave camps. its documented. happened in seattle, happened in oakland, happened in miami.

resist the system. never turn in your firearms. read the fucking constitution sometime. know your rights. they are about to be violated. look around, its a new world order. the euro, the takeover of mideast nations for control of oil, retinal scans, voice identification, facial recognition systems.

are you prepared to be enslaved? you better wake up, you already are.

"event","reality is setting in, yet again...

phoenix sucks... its been over 100 for like 3+ months straight. it maybe rained 4 times, and only once did it rain for more than half an hour.

so once again im considering my options.

i hate math, yet i constantly find myself doing it, without even being asked. whats wrong with me?

so here are some figures... oh but first, lets say that every time i fill up my tank it costs me 26.98$ (thats 1.90$ per gallon on a 14.2 gallon tank) lets also assume that i am retarded and should have brought my car with me to phoenix rather than leaving it in montana. so, to have my car delivered to me here in phoenix i have to foot the bill of 230.00$ (thats an over-estimation, actually it is 215.84$, err on the side of caution)

ok...

billings - phoenix - billings (i have to drop my buddy off at home) - toronto = 4,290.21 miles
billings - phoenix - billings (again, with the buddy and stuff) - boston = 4747.22 miles

wee...

now, assuming that its about 27 bux a tank, and a 14.2 gallon tank, i still have to calculate the mileage...

lets aim low, lets say 22mpg (i know its more like 28, but as i said before, err on the side of caution)
ok so 22mpg means ill get about 312.4 miles on a completely full tank. damn...
 
13.73 fill ups to toronto = 370.44$ in gas
15.20 full ups to boston = 410.10$ in gas

this is entirely unrealistic, because everyone knows something always goes wrong... never make plans, cuz as soon as you do, thats when things fall apart...


better to figure at least 50$ overage just for gas and oil and the like. 

fucking shit man, why cant i find a place to move to and just stay there?"

And I know you'll never return to this place 

Gone through days without talking 
There is a comfort in silence

Burning in my eyes to blind 
To cover up what really happened

You have to join up but you can use a decal maker to make a really cool emblem for Mariokart.  You upload a photo or put in a URL and it'll turn that photo into the grid pattern so you can enter it into Mariokart.  I now have a really cool Grendel eyes emblem for Mariokart."

Those are all the ones I've played with the intention of getting awesome times.  The rest are just those we passed around in the car that one day and that day before the wedding, so they're not that competitive.

"event","It wasn't long after the attack on Hogwarts that Gilderoy managed to get a hold of the Daily Prophet.  Not even bothering to return to the salon, he immediately scanned the article on the attack with unusual interest (perhaps he actually worried for the students of the school).  He was certainly shocked upon reading about the death of Ronald Weasley, nearly dropping the paper where he stood.  He walked slowly and somberly to the salon, turning the words of the article over in his mind, reading it again to be sure of what he read the first time.

Gilderoy opened the door to the shop, closed it again and locked it, then flipped the ""We're Open!"" sign to show its other side.  He thought carefully for a moment, then wrote in his journal:


<i>""What exactly happened at Hogwarts?  And with Ronald?""</i>


He figured he wouldn't be getting many (if any) answers, but believing everything written in the papers didn't sound like a smart idea at all, even to Lockhart."

Professor Dumbledore:

Greetings from me, Gilderoy Lockhart!  As you may know, I now manage a hair salon in Hogsmeade.  I am looking to hire a student worker to help me with the general runnings of the business during the weekends he/she is available.  My apprentice informed me that Hogwarts has a school newspaper, and I was curious as to whether or not you'd allow me to place an advertisement announcing a job opening in the aforementioned paper.  It'd be a chance for the students to earn a little extra pocket money, as well as learn work ethics and values<strike>; plus, they're cheap labor</strike>.

Thank you for your consideration,

Gilderoy Lockhart

"event","Gilderoy had certainly noticed a change in his ward: while he wasn't usually a chipper fellow, Ron's demeanor had fallen to the point where he seemed downright enervated.  As the youth entered the salon, he greeted his employer and was promptly interrupted with a yawn.  His eyes still looked as if they were packed for a well-needed vacation, and his hair was surprisingly disheveled for an employee of a hair stylist.  A look of fatherly concern appeared on Lockhart's face as he addressed Ron.

""Ron, how have you been doing outside of the workplace?""  Ron continued toward the hall with no response.  ""Ron?""

""Huh?"" Ron replied, awakening from his distracted daze.  ""Did you say something?""  

""I asked if you are all right.  Frankly, you look terrible.""

Ron glanced at Lockhart, looking confused even through his apparent exhaustion.  Lockhart's tone was an uncommon one, since Ron had become accustomed to his boss caring for no one except himself.  <i>Then again,</i> Ron thought to himself, <i>he did help me send that vengeful letter to Milly.  Maybe all that time at St. Mungo's did him some good.</i>  ""There's been a lot of drama at the school lately.  I've not gotten much sleep in a couple of weeks.  I'll be fine, Mr. Lockhart.""  He was starting to sound like a broken record, having used the same excuse at school whenever he was asked that question, but it was his only defense.

Gilderoy shrugged, still worried about his apprentice.  ""All right, Ron.  I'll trust you this time, but I'll send you home for rest if you come in looking like this again, okay?  I wouldn't want to give the wrong impression for the customers, after all!""  He smiled, amused by the idea of customers being frightened by Ron's unkempt appearance, and watched Ron head down the hall.  He leaned backward from the front counter to the point where he could see Ron; he was cleaning a pair of scissors in the bathroom sink at the end of the hall.  <i>Ah, it's so nice to see my apprentice prepare for the day!  It already looks like it will be a good one!</i>  He smiled and returned to his records, reaching for his quill.  He lifted the pen from the ink jar and delicately touched it to the paper.

<i><b>Whump-cachink!</i></b>

Gilderoy retracted the quill, surprised by the noise.   Remaining as stationary as possible, his eyes trailed to the quill in his hand, suspecting it was the cause of the clamor.  He lightly touched the quill to the paper again, listening for the noise to repeat itself; this time, there was no reaction.  He lifted the pen again, examining the end of it with a questioning glance.

""Ron, you haven't messed with my pen, have you?  Enchanted it or anything?""

There was no response from the hallway.  Gilderoy carefully leaned backward to see if Ron had left the bathroom.  From his position, he could see no more of Ron than his hand lying limply in the doorway, the sud-covered scissors lying a few inches from it.

""Ron!""

"event","The bell above the door rang loudly as Ron entered the salon, eyes glued to the floor and packed with bags.  Gilderoy looked up from his morning paper and cheerful whistling, waving a greeting to his assistant.

   ""Good morning, young Ron!  I do hope the day finds you as well as I do!""  Gilderoy then took the time to actually look at Ron, and realized that the morning had not only found him unwell, but it had probably run over him with the weight of a dump truck.  Lockhart's smile quickly changed to a look of confusion.  ""Well, it apparently hasn't found you well.  Rough night, my boy?""

   Ron glanced at his employer with a look that could've frightened the dead: ""Spiders.  I hate spiders.""  His hair was messy, clothes wrinkled, and he was wearing two different kinds of socks.  ""I didn't get much sleep.""

   ""Obviously not,"" said Gilderoy.  ""Any particular reason?  Other than the spiders you mentioned...""

   Ron sighed, deciding whether or not he should tell Lockhart the reason for his sleepless night.  He finally resigned into explaining the situation, figuring it couldn't really hurt to tell an idiot like Lockhart about his recent problems.  ""I like to buy gifts for people to make them happy.  It makes me feel a little better about myself to do something good for other people, and this one Slytherin girl isn't taking it too well.  She's not much for receiving gifts, and she responded to my presents with one of her own-- some toy spider she'd enchanted to move around like a real one.  I've got this... thing about spiders, and I couldn't sleep well with the blasted thing in the room.""

   Gilderoy, to Ron's surprise, didn't ask any questions or start into some story about how he was in a similar situation at one time and what he did to amend it.  He thought for a moment, an idea churning in his mind.  ""You know what you have to do now, right?""

   ""Quit and go back to feeling guilty and jealous of people?""

   ""No, my boy, no!  What you need to do now is get revenge!""

   Ron was taken aback by this suggestion.  ""Huh?""

   ""She's obviously not used to getting gifts, so she responds poorly.  She thinks she can just push you around because you're trying to be a nice guy!  They always say that nice guys finish last, but I don't believe that for one minute!  If she thinks she can intimidate you, she should think again, right?""

   ""Mr. Lockhart, I don't think I really want---""

   ""Play along with her, Ron.  She's a Slytherin, right?  They thrive on their cleverness, and hate to be beaten at their own games!  Teach her something, Ron, like what it's like to be just as low as she can be.""

   Ron shook his head, hoping this was some sort of weird dream.  ""Are you serious?""

   ""I am, Ron; I am.  I may be famous for my good looks and incredible charm, but my skills of deception are quite developed, if I do say so myself."""

To Professor Snape,

I am in need of some assistance from you, my good man,  I have recently been tormented day and night by the strongest of passions-- love; however, I have the problem of not being able to fully express my dire need for companionship!  It is so hard to put such passions in to words, you see, even for an accomplished writer like myself.

I wish to rid myself of these feelings, and so I call upon you to make me a potion to forget the woman who fills my daydreams with emotions of longing and desire.  I would do it myself, but I'm a very busy man, and cannot take the time to make such a concoction.

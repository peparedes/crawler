Perhaps this place is worth staying at. It brings me to myself.

I drink.
I wait.
I drink some more; and the longer I stay, the more I reckon I like this place.
It does remind one of Deadwood. Less humanity present, but the motion of the place, and it's ways?
oh. I recognise them well.

"event","<STRONG>I got the book because it has bill on the cover.</STRONG>
It's a decent bit of work, with SOME research obviously done but turns the characters into paper cutouts of themselves.
Bill does his Billglare, drinks and plays cards; that's all he does. He loves his wife, but his careful writing's turned to a toddler's tripe. His obvious love for his wife Agnes Thatcher is downplayed, and he even says he doesn't wish to bring her out to Deadwood when ... that was the idea behind much of his trime there. Calamity Jane's turned into an ugly, drunken whore with no sense of what she was doing, no knowledge of Bill or even friendship; and the marriage she actualy claimed to bill several years after his death, has been claimed.
Cody's wild west show is mentioned, which..didn't exist until after Bill was dead.
Seth Bullock is turned into a rough and tumble idiot, Swearingen is a horny, cock-sucking fiend (litterally) who is duller than all get out; and Saul Starr is ... a miserly jew. Stereotypes gone wild.
What detail there is isn't much, and....really, I was expecting something better.
Granted I'm only on page 84, and I'm hoping it'll get better, but my prospects are bleak.
Continued: Bill is SHORT.
Jane is an ugly, drunken whore who... has no sense of balance, sucks at bullwacking, shooting, etc.

The sentances are horrid.
I keep reading. It's like a trainwreck."

"event","<I>My dearest Agnes,</I>

The world I have ended up is not the afterlife; though it is stranger than any dream. I have wandered my way through hell, to a place where anything -anything- truly seems possible. And yet I remain haunted. People recognise me, call me by name, as if I am some legend brought to life... far worse than it ever was when I was living. There are those here who remind me of people I have met before; people I knew, people I cared for, people I killed.

I was asked if I took joy in my work; that is in the dispatching of people. Tell me, love, would I still be human if I could not look upon the deaths of friends without some regret? If I could somehow change the past, and undo the bullet that too Mike's life, I would have. I still sleep uneasy some nights, thinking of the events of that October in Abilene. Does she mistake joy for bloodlust, I wonder? Tell me, Agnes, am I becoming the very monster I fight against? - I wonder.

I hope to be reuinited with you oncemore,

Bill won't tightrope walk.
<lj-cut text=""I'm a lousey actor (Bill)"">
1/11/2007</P><P>03:52 PM
Logfile from TK.</P><P>Verdant Fields</P><P>At the edge of the city, commerce gives way to agriculture, buildings</P><P>and street vendors in turn giving way to fields of maize and soybeans.</P><P>The road becomes unpaved here, little more than a swath of dirt that</P><P>two carts have trouble passing each other on. Most of the length of</P><P>this long stretch of dirt road is flanked by split-rail fences that</P><P>keep the traffic out of the crops. A few farm houses and ranches dot</P><P>the landscape now and then.</P><P>Contains: Bill &amp; Fab</P><P>
Bill stands, eyeing a playing card tacked to a fence-rail some 60 paces away from him. The afternoon sunlight catches his eyes, bringing out the blue tint to the gray, giving them a lively, alert appearance, and dances along his grayish-brown hair, bringing to life the subtle yellow highlights it has. Sunlight makes him look...human.</P><P>Presently, Fab arrives from the direction of the town. Naturally quiet on her feet, she's fairly sure of what he's doing. It's best, she decides therefore, to simply watch from a distance for a while, waiting until the moment is right to announce her presence.</P><P>Bill cocks his head faintly to one side; the card is not in his direct field of vision. He draws both guns as one the motion swift, swifter than thought, because he doesn't have to think about what he does, at this point in his life. Muscle memmory. There's a faint click, and then a deep Boom as he shoots once; and then again. The card remains tacked to the post.</P><P>""Bravissimo!"" Fab raises her hands above her head and applauds, approaching with measured tread and a smile on her face. She hasn't actually seen the damage done to the target, but nobody moves like that if they don't know what they're doing.</P><P>Bill smirks. ""Save the applause till we see if I hit the card,"" he replies as he reholsters the pistols, striding over towards the fencepost. ""I'm not infaliable, no matter what the reports say.""</P><P>Fab follows cheerfully enough. ""Yeah, right,"" she says, ""Besides, even if you missed I'd still give you top marks for style. Did I ever mention I once did a stint as a knife-thrower's assistant?""</P><P>""You didn't,"" he comments, as he removes the card from the post, holding it up to the light. Ace of spades; in the center, a hole. The geezer got it. ""Not bad,"" he remarks, eyeing the card.</P><P>""Told you,"" says Fab wryly, bowing in deference. ""How are you doing today, anyway?"" She's swapped her sari for a knee-length sweater worn over pink leggings, and a silver harmonica hangs from a pink ribbon about her neck.</P><P>Bill offers Fab the card. ""I'm fine, ma'am.""</P><P>""Good to hear,"" says Fab, taking the card with a warm smile and sliding it into a pocket - there's a faint jingling sound as she does so. ""And, umm, for the help the other night? Think I'm back on my feet now - got a room over the inn and a job keeping the punters entertained. Not sure what I'd have done if you hadn't taken the time to show the new kid the ropes.""</P><P>Bill smiles. ""Think nothing of it. Everyone needs a hand up sometimes.""</P><P>""Maybe,"" says Fab, but her gratitude seems genuine. She hops up onto the nearest fencepost, balancing there with a cat's agility before slowly setting out along the rail. There's an expression of vaguely blissed-out concentration as she does so. ""Meri'd never let me erect a wire in the Fiddler's green, would she?""</P><P>Bill shrugs ,and leans back against the fencepost, thoughtfully. ""Can't hurt to ask."" he says, after a moment.</P><P>Pace, pause, pirouette, change leading leg. ""Ceilings are too low,"" says Fab dismissively, ""Can't get a sense of drama if I'm only six or eight feet up. It's still good for focusing the mind, though - you should try it sometime.""</P><P>Bill chuckles. ""I think I'll keep my feet to the ground, ma'am.""</P><P>""Are you sure?"" asks Fab, eyes sparkling with mischief, ""If you can hold yourself that steady, chances are you'd be a natural.""</P><P>Bill mms. ""But I am a lousey actor,"" he remarks. ""Theatricality was Cody's love; not mine.""</P><P>""This isn't acting,"" responds the girl promptly, ""If you were in the tent with a bit of an audience, well, you'd probably want to wave and smile a bit. It's just you and me, though, which makes it a bit of healthy exercise for mind and body."" She makes a couple of high, catlike jumps, changing leading leg each time. ""Helps if you work above thirty feet, of course, but this is fine to begin with.""</P><P>Bill hrmphs; amused but there's no way HE is going to do wirework. He knows he came back from death once; he's not about to kick a gift-life in the face, though.</P><P>""Suit yourself,"" says Fab cheerfully, pirouetting through 360 degrees and then hopping back down again. ""Besides, it doesn't look to me as though you need anything to help you relax.""</P><P>Bill remarks, ""Some whiskey, decent company; perhaps a touch of laudnum now and again."" He shrugs. ""Haven't lived my life without have some old scars, some old pains to remind me of it.""</P><P>""You and me both,"" says Fab, ""Mind you, if you've got the time I'd love to swap a few stories.""</P><P>Bill smiles briefly. ""Always willing.""</P><P>""You first, then,"" teases the girl, ""Allow a lady to retain a little mystery?""</P><P>Bill chuckles. ""As you wish.""</P><P>Raeft pages, ""Ah, NOW I see what you meant by demo."" to you.</P><P>""Sooo...."" says Fab teasingly, ""C'mon, I know you've got fun secrets. I can see it on your face and in your eyes.""</P><P>Bill hrms thoughtfully, twining a finger briefly about the edge of a trailing mustache. ""A secret, hrm...."" He sighs, eyes half-lidding. ""When I was a young fellow, I met a man named Cody. He'd become Buffalo Bill when he was older; but at the time we were hardly more than boys, really. Thought we knew damn near everything, though.""</P><P>
""You do when you're a kid,"" says Fab, ""Don't you? And then suddenly life bites you in the arse, and you realise you've barely even crawled out of the womb.""</P><P>You say, ""Cody was like Liquor. He'd get you to believe anything. Never grew out of that, really,"" he smiles. ""Anyhow, I was between driving work, Cody was working the express, and we made our way to Santa fe... He proposed a wager.""""</P><P>Fab nods slowly, liking the sound of what she's hearing. ""Go on,"" she says, hopping back up to sit on the fence.</P><P>You say, ""Ten dollars on who had better marksmanship. So we setup something like I was jus' doing -a few cards. Fifty paces. Cody goes first; than I. We walk up, look at the cards.""""</P><P>""Mmmhmm?"" says Fab, licking her lips. ""You're a born storyteller, by the way - if you ever visited Janx 3 you'd be a millionaire within a week.""</P><P>Bill chuckles lightly. ""A natural born storyteller,eh? Maybe. Pop always said my mind flew higher than a kite."" His eyes sparkle briefly in amusement, and he returns to his tale. ""Anyways, we looked at the cards. Cody said straightaway I won; I had speed on him, that's for certain. But if you looked at the cards? -it was Cody who had hit dead-center. He always said I won it, though. It was the only time he beat me.""</P><P>Fab nods thoughtfully. ""He sounds like good company,"" she says, ""I always thought I'd have done quite well in those days, actually."" Absent-mindedly, she removes a handful of small blades from her pocket and begins to juggle them.</P><P>You say, ""Cody was. We traveled together for about a week; parted ways. I didn't see him for several years, till after we'd grown up. He had some play, Scouts of the Plains or something suchlike, told him I couldn't act for horseshit....""</P><P>""You'd be amazed how many can't,"" says Fab conversationally, ""Particularly females, actually. Oftentimes a perky pair of tits and a nice arse is enough. Time was when that was all people believed there was to me, even.""</P><P>Bill smirks. ""Jane could, surprisingly enough. If she wasn't drunk.""</P><P>""Stage-fright?"" asks Fab sympathetically, ""Or did she just have a taste for the stuff?""</P><P>Bill shakes his head no at the stage-fright question. ""No; she just was born half a man; could outdrink anyone in camp, outswear anyone, too. Had a good heart, though. If you were ever in a calamity, just call Jane, she'd patch you up quick as any doctor.""</P><P>""You loved her, didn't you?"" asks Fab thoughtfully. There's an odd distance in her eyes now, as though her mind and body aren't quite in the same place.</P><P>Bill shrugs; then shakes his head no. ""There wasn't love. Friendship, yes. Trust, yes. Love? -no. Agnes? -now /that/ was love.""</P><P>""Go on, then,"" says Fab, ""Well, unless it's a personal matter, of course.""</P><P>You say, ""Jane, Charlie, Charlie's brother and I went to Deadwood. One last hoorah before settling down for civilized life, you might say. Charlie thought I should set up a claim, set some money asside for Agnes and I, being newly married and such...""</P><P>Fab nods again, stretching out her legs and wriggling her toes before relaxing back again and continuing to listen to the story.</P><P>You say, ""I wasn't in the mood for it, though; prospecting... and Charlie and Jane and Steve followed me around like hens... no peace at all...""</P><P>He has her sympathy there; a life lived in the public eye has made Fab more protective than most of her privacy. ""...So what happened?"" she asks softly.</P><P>You say, ""Perhaps we went mad. Gave into vice; there was death on the wind, and we all knew the west wouldn't be wild for much longer. The end of a way of life... We could all see it comming. Charlie and Steve set up a mail service, got busy with that. Jane? I don't think she was sober a day in Deadwood.""</P><P>Fab quirks a brow; while she's indulged in her fair share of non-prescription pharmaceuticals, she's actually generally fairly ladylike in public situations.</P><P>Bill stares off down the road, his eyes go flat; gray like a slate. Light does not reflect from them, doesn't give them life. ""I didn't prospect. Dranks as much as Jane. Spent the rest of what little I had at the tables. I'm not sorry I did; it was my Hell, and I loved it."" He turns his head, to peer back at Fab. ""You can tell when death's coming. The air changes, there's a tenseness that wasn't there before. You just don't know who it'll be until it arrives.""</P><P>Bill smirks. ""I knew it was coming, long before the others did. We reacted as we knew how.""</P><P>""Still a shame, though,"" says Fab, ""And rather more of a shame for those left behind, I think.""</P><P>Bill gives his head a shake. ""I should've given more thought to Agnes' welfare. Other than that? - I regret nothing.""</P><P>""It's the way to be, I think,"" says Fab, ""Regret's a waste of time. Not that it's something you can consciously control, of course..."" She tosses the knives in the air, catches them in one hand and slides them back into her pocket in one single smooth motion.</P><P>Bill smirks faintly; the ghost of a smile upon his lips. ""Anything is possible, ma'am,"" he says. ""And now, I've business to attend to...I wish you good day.""</P><P>""Take care of yourself,"" says Fab, ""And good luck."" As she departs, she raises her harmonica to her lips to give herself some music to walk to.</P>"

Late Evening
Riala calls someone a Liar.
Bill gets profane.
Nothing is shot; except for my formatting.

<lj-cut text=""I am, indeed, saying that you are a liar (Riala)"">

1/10/2007

01:44 AM
Logfile from TK2.


Western Aes Vicus

For a street dedicated to commerce, this one seems terribly underused.

While large buildings crowd the sides of the canal, some of them

dangerously close to crumbling into the mist, the street side vendors

are few and far between. A few brave souls have set up on the various

bridges built across the creeping river of fog below, hawking their

wares. One enterprising soul has even fashioned a barge out of what

used to be the pavement that lined the street. How it floats in the

middle of the mist is anyone's guess. To the south, a large tavern

dominates the street. A [sign] swings over the door on a rusted and

nearly snapped chain, causing it to send ear-piercing squeals into the

street. The sign proclaims it to be the Fiddler's Green.

Obvious Exits:

[FG] Fiddler's Green [SO] Small Office [P]awn Shoppe

[D] Down [E] East [W] West

Contents:

Boyd



Bill walks along the street, his boots crunching lightly on the ground. He's not drunk, but

he's certainly had a drink or two before going on his constitutional.


Boyd leans against the outside wall of the Green. A cigarette dangles from the corner of

his mouth as he sits there cross armed. His eyes follow over the various people milling

about on the streets.




Matt wanders down the street, doin the patrol thing, bout time he was actually doing his

job for once no matter how bored he seems. He humms along with some tune, know only as the

bored humming song.


Bill slows his step lightly, listening. He turns his head to one side, to see Matt.

""Evening, Matt,"" he greets in a light rumble. ""Seein' to the town?""

Boyd looks over, hearing Bill's voice. His eyebrow raises slightly as he tries to get a

look of the man Bill is talking to. He pulls the cigarette from his mouth and exhales a

plume of smoke. Not ready to step forward, he keeps leaning against the wall by the door.


Matt slows as well to look over at Bill, ""Yeah, its still in one piece, to an extent."" He

kicks a loose stone into the rift in the street. ""Not keepin your table warm?""


Bill gives his head a light shake. ""Naa; gettin' a touch of a headache, too bright in that

damn place for my mood. Seen your Captain around?""


Boyd's attention is piqued at the mention of ""captian"". He pushes himself off of the wall

and walks towards the two men talking. ""Fancy meeting you here,"" he says deadpan to Bill. 

Looking Matt over he adds, ""Why don't you introduce me to your friend here?""


Matt blinks a few times, ""Captian? Who? We don't have a..."" He turns as Boyd enters into

the conversation, offering a slight wave, ""I can do that myself thanks, not exactly mute.

Names Matt."" He offers his hand.


Boyd clasps Matt's hand and gives his a quick shake before pulling away. He smiles and odd

smile as he looks recognizes the uniform Matt wears. ""You're one of the cops around here,

aren't you?"" he asks.


Bill doesn't roll his eyes. But Matt's confusion does send a brisk, brief flash of

annoyance across his weathered features. ""Nevermind, pup,"" he remarks, turning his gaze to

Boyd and nodding; yes, Matt's one of the cops.


Riala arrives from the tavern.


Matt nods a quick yes to Boyd and turns to Bill, ""Oh, you mean the sergeant, nah haven't

seen her lately."" He turns to Boyd, ""So who would you be?""

Boyd nods and sets his hands into the pockets of his suit jacket. ""Name's Boyd Corcoran. 

I'm a businessman, insurance mostly. Anyhow, I needed to report something to you. Some

murderers around your city,"" he says to Matt, he sounds a little detached though.


Bill hrms at Matt's remark, and steps back a pace when Boyd steps up to speak to Matt. At

the tone, the old gunslinger eyes Boyd a little more closely.


Riala walks along Aes Vicus, coming from the direction of the Square. She's got a folder

under one arm, but she's angling for the Fiddler's Green. She actually looks.. almost

happy, for once. Content, at least.


Matt lifts an eyebrow, ""Yeah?"" he clasps his hands behind his back trying to look

professional and interested. ""Who?""


""Two of them,"" Boyd says, ""One's a big guy, goes by Frank Mason. The other is a smaller

girl, heard her name, Mithren."" He looks around briefly. ""Frank was a former business

partner of mine. He was supposed to meet me and another partner of ours to settle some old

debts of ours. You know how paper work causes problems like that,"" he says. ""Well, he

brings along this girl. So during the meeting, they jump my partner and me. Killed him,

and tried to kill me,"" he tells Matt.


Riala comes to a stop, hearing the conversation, and immediately changes course. ""Wait just

one moment!"" She glances at Matt briefly, then frowns at Boyd. ""What's this about Miss

Westfall?""


Bill's head turns, once he hears Riala's voice. With one hand, he gestures lightly towards

Boyd and Matt.


Matt nods a few times during the conversation, then turns towards Riala, blinks a few times

then salutes, ""Sergeant."" He looks between the two, ""Miss Westfall? I'm gonna go ahead and

guess that you mean Mithren. Apparently herself and a Frank Mason jumped this man and his

partner, killing said partner.""


Boyd looks over as Riala calls out. ""So that's her last name,"" he says quietly. ""Well,

that girl and her accomplice killed a friend and business partner of mine. And she tried

to do the same to me, too. I was just trying to warn some people about the danger really,""

he reaffirms what Matt said. ""It was just business, but Frank took it personal.""

Riala comes to a stop within reasonable speaking distance of Matt and Boyd. ""You'd better

start from the beginning, and tell me about this, then. When was this, and what danger do

you speak of?""


Bill watches; observes, and moves towards the Green. Settling with his back against the

building's edifice, he takes out a cigar; lights it, and smokes.


Boyd nods slowly. ""This guy, Frank Mason. He's the big lug. Used to be partners with me

and a guy named Mickey O'Doyle. Well, he wanted out of our business, so we cut him out. 

Some debts don't get settled, though. So we set up a meeting. Frank and this girl,

Mithren he called her, show up. They get the jump on us and kill Mickey and try to kill

me. I got lucky,"" he tells Riala.


Matt just stands back and listens to the story, for the third time. His face falls for a

second as some realization or another hits him. ""Could you give a description of them? Any

defining features, besides being big? Big is kind of a relative term around here.""

Riala nods shortly. ""As the Private said, please. Also, when did this occur?"" She frowns.

""I've met Miss Westfall before, and she doesn't seem the type to try to kill someone.""

Bill smokes his cigar, eyes half-lidded.


Boyd looks over to Matt and nods. ""Yeah, I can. Frank's a bit under six and a half. Kind

of thick too. He's a professional fighter, real meaty looking. And his face is all mashed

up too, flat nose, and his eye is sunk in a bit,"" he says. Looking to Riala he scrutinizes

her as he speaks. ""She was just this girl, arm candy I thought. Shorter than Frank, but a

lot of people are. She was athletic, real fast. Jumped around a lot and got Mickey with

some sort of knife. Caused him to go loopy and pass out. That's about it. I tried to

run, but she caught me with a knife. They must have written me off as dead,"" he tells the

two Knights.


Stern arrives from the tavern.

Matt nods a few more times, ""So, no
description of the woman, other than shorter than Frank

and athletic."" He sighs, ""Its okay I think I have a good idea of who your talking about and

as Riala said."" He doesn't bother finishing, ""Either way, Can you be more descriptive of

Frank? Big and looking like you've survived a few fights is well rather common sadly. Hair

color, eye color? Stuff like that?""


Riala frowns a bit. ""And you still haven't answered my question. When did this occur? Given

your lack of bandages, I'm assuming this took place a while ago, but I still need to know

when. And I'd like to know why you didn't approach us sooner.""


Bill continues leaning back against the outside of the Green, smoking his cigar. He seems

relaxed, perhaps bored, a touch sleepy. At one with his thoughts, whatever they might be.

Stern steps out of the Green, chomping down on the butt of his own cigar. The tip flares

alight as he crosses the threshhold, and he quietly arches an eyebrow at the other two Mist

Knights nearby. ""Everythin' alright here, Sarge?"" he calls out to Rialla.

Boyd nods to both of the officers. ""About Frank, he usually shaves his head, but he's a

red head. Eyes are sort of green. He's a mick, light skin, that whole deal. He used to

be a stevedore. Dresses like one still. Knit hat, jacket, those denim trousers, and

boots,"" he tells Matt. Turning to Riala, he answers her. ""Happened about a month or so

ago. Outside the city. It was Frank's request. I guess he wanted to keep you guys out of

it. Meeting was in that big scrapyard you guys got out there. I never came to you cause

Frank's turf are those docks. So I hid in that yard, made sure no one came back for me. 

When I was sure I could be safe, I came here. Been looking for you guys since then,"" he

explains.


Matt absently waves to Stern as he exits the building, then waits for the description to

end, before turning to Riala, ""Want me to get a description written down and passed out for

Frank and Mithren?"" 


Riala glances over at Stern, and gestures at him. ""Come on over, Corporal."" She turns back

to Boyd. ""Did Miss Westfall say anything? She's usually quite a talkative woman, and

anything she said might be helpful to know."" She glances at Matt. ""Not just yet. For one

thing, I can find Miss Westfall myself.""


Stern arches an eyebrow as he approaches, ears perked a bit. ""What'd I miss?""

Bill continues to smoke, in a borring way, just working on his cigar, finishing it off. His

gaze turns briefly towards Stern, then back to Riala.



""She was playacting for a while. Acting like a ditz, real flirty with Mickey. Poor sap

went gaga over her. Then she stabs him. After she got me, her and Frank talked for a bit,

about payment. She wanted him to work in some sort of project of hers. They didn't go

into detail,"" he says. Seeing Stern come over, he nods. ""Evening.""


Riala hmms a bit, and nods. Then, she turns to Stern. ""Hey, Corporal. Do you remember what

happened to Miss Westfall, just over a month ago? And what the result of that was?""

Stern says, ""You mean her falling out of the second story of this bar?"" He hooks a thumb

backwards towards the Green. ""So far as I know, that one lady - Pancua I think it was -

confessed to shoving her out. I got Mithren to the healing college, n' that's probably the

last time I saw her since. She wasn't sayin""

Stern says, ""she wasn't sayin' much that night, to be honest.""


Bill finishes his cigar, lets the remainder fall and kills the embers with the toe of his

boot.


Boyd looks at each of the officers. He flicks the ash from his cigarette to the ground. 

He eyes where Stern pointed and looks back to the officers. ""Pancua, she ain't like you,

is she?"" he asks Stern.


Matt shakes his head, and looks between the three, ""I'm gonna go pass out descriptions of

this Frank guy then. Since you've got the Mithren thing under control. Want me to file a

report of the incident as well?"" He runs his hand through his hair.

Riala shakes her head at Matt. ""No."" She nods at Stern, and says, ""That's because she was

unable to speak, a condition that lasted for some time."" She turns back to Boyd, and says,

""Which, of course, means that you're lying. What I'd like to know, is why, precisely,

you've given to us this story.. which, I'd like to add, is also, entirely, a fabrication.

Do you have something in particular against this Frank, and Miss Westfall?""


Stern quietly chews his cigar from one side of his mouth, to the other. ""Pancua n' I are

similar in that we're both cats. That's about it."" He nods quietly at Matt, then turns

his head a little, ear cocked as he looks sidelong at Riala, then back at Boyd.


Boyd shoots a baleful look to Riala. ""Are you calling me a liar? Listen, flatfoot, of

course I have something against them. They killed my partner and tried to kill me. I

think that gives me a good reason to have something against them, do you?"" he says, his

voice doesn't show anger, but cold hate. ""And I said, a month or so. I was in a scrapyard

recovering from getting stabbed in the chest and kicked upside the head buy a man the size

of a flivver. You expect me to keep a logbook of my activities?"" he adds. ""I was guessing

on the time."" 


Bill keeps his expression placid. He lets his arms dangle akimbo, lightly, his hat tipping

forward as he leans back, to shadow his gray eyes.


Matt shakes his head a few times, muttering, ""This isn't gonna end well."" under his breath.

He runs his hand through his hair and lets them drop to rest near the weapons on his belt.

He looks between Riala and Boyd as if deciding who exactly is gonna snap first.


Riala raises an eyebrow. ""I am, indeed, saying that you are a liar. Quite a good one, too -

fortunately for us, I don't have to rely on visual and audible clues as to whether or not

you speak truth."" She shakes her head. ""You, your partner, Frank, and Miss Westfall may

have had a fight - you weren't lying there, but you're lying about them being the

aggressors. I'd like to know why you attacked them. It's obvious as to why you're here now

- you lost, and still want to do them harm.""


Stern frowns a little, still just listening for now. He glances between Riala and Boyd,

then makes eye contact with Matt as he quietly maneuvers himself to block the human from

making any sort of rash attempts to bolt.


Boyd shakes his head. ""I get it. Frankie's better than I thought. I didn't think he was

that bright. He paid you off, didn't he?"" he says. He looks to Stern and Matt. ""I mean,

come on. I was there, I know what happened. I have the scar on my chest to prove it. And

she just dictates what happens as if she's Jesus fucking Christ? Figures cops would be

just as in on the take here as back home,"" he says. He refrains from any threatening

physical gestures as he talks, keeping his body relaxed.


Bill lifts his head, peering at Boyd. ""Hey, Boyd,"" he calls out, from his post.


Matt nods to Stern but just shifts position from foot to foot where he is standing, looking

rather bored with the whole thing and humming. Yep just waiting for something he could do.

He switches attention to Bill as he calls out, as if just now remembering he was there. But

quickly resumes his bored posturing, keeping an ear open for any sounds of excitement.


Riala's face goes from neutral, to a dark frown. ""I don't claim to be an angel, however, I

have not, and will never, accept money from anyone as a bribe. And anyone I find under my

command doing so while face charges."" She rests her free, right hand, on the dagger on the

right side of her belt. ""I have never met this 'Frank', and while I have met Miss Westfall,

it was purely with her as a middle-man for something else. Now, you can stop trying to

avoid the truth. What, precisely, is your problem with those two? And why are you trying to

use the Mist Knights to get at them?""


Boyd pinches the bridge of his nose and looks down for a second. ""I love that

incorruptible bit. The higher ups always dance a good jig,"" he mutters. ""Frank was

business partner with me and Mickey. He left the partnership. Mickey and myself set up a

business meeting. He brings her along, for what I can only imagine was to kill us. Why

else would he bring her along? And I'm going to you guys because you are supposed to be

the law around here,"" he says, his hands offered palms up. ""Though I say I'm a little

curious as to what this something else was. Didn't know cops associated with murderers,""

he adds. Finally, he looks to Bill. ""Yes, Bill?"" he asks the man.


Bill watches Boyd; his attention doesn't waver as he speaks, grey eyes dead-calm, not the

slightest spark of life to them. Corpse's eyes. ""You,"" he says, ""Remind me of a cunt. You

go poking around other people, slinking about them like a whore trying to hunt up business.

You even lie like one. A sneaky, lying little cunt."" He doesn't take a step forward, his

voice doesn't raise, nor does it lower; just a light, faintly mocking modulation. ""Why

don't you act like a man for once, and tell them the truth?""


Riala snorts. ""You don't know who I am, or why I joined the Knights in the first place, so

I'll forgive you your ridiculous attempt at slandering me, this time. I'll swear to

Nemesis, if I have to. But you'd best do as Bill over there said, and tell me the truth.

Remember, I will -know- if you're lying.""


Boyd Shakes his head, looking at Bill. ""I can keep telling the truth all I want. It's all

of you that just don't listen."" He unbuttons his vest, opening the front of the body armor

underneath with it, hiding it under the vest. He turns to the Knights, showing a scar on

his chest. The scar is fairly new, and is a knife wound. ""She chucked a knife into me. 

How much more do you want?"" he says coldly.


Stern clears his throat. ""A knife wound is a knife wound. I've plenty of my own - some of

them also recent. But the intent behind the knife that was thrown, is the real question

that needs to be answered."" He reaches out, gently placing a hand on Boyd's shoulder. 

""Sir, if you want our assistance, we need all the facts. Otherwise, the Sergeant there is

going to merely get more and more angered. If there is something being withheld, rest

assured, she knows about it, and continuing any pretense to hide information from her will

*not* aid your cause.""


Bill watches Boyd with his dead gaze. ""You saying I'm hard of hearing? That my facaulties

are faulty?"" He pauses briefly; not blinking, just watching. A snake would have more

emotion in it's gaze than Wild Bill at this moment. Now his tone drops, just a slight

notch; but it's there. The warning. ""You want to test my other facaulties?""


Boyd fastens his vests. ""You want to know the honest to God truth? Fine. Frank Mason is

a mobster. He's a killer and an enforcer for the Hell's Kitchen Crew. He made some bad

deals. Tried to get out of them. He cut and run from Mickey and Me. Wanted to leave the

city to avoid the crew. We set up a deal with him. He shows up with this girl. We

confront him about it, the deal being only us, and he sics the girl on Mickey. I got away

and held them off long enough, but they got me in the end. I didn't die though. Happy?""

he says, still cold and steady. ""It was business. He made it personal. ""And shut it,

Hikock. Your faculties didn't keep you from getting a bullet in your head. Yeah, I know

who you are, used to read the dime novels about you as a kid."" he adds in a dull voice.


Riala shakes her head. ""And you tried to use us to finish your 'business'. It sounds to me

like you got precisely what you deserve. I suggest you leave here, and not bother us, Frank

Mason, of Mithren Westfall, ever again. We're not too concerned with your history before

you come to this city - only what you do while you're here. And as neither of them have

committed any crime in Caligo Arx that I'm aware of, you've no leg to stand on here.""


Stern withdraws his hand, and takes a quiet step back. ""If you wish, ma'am, we could have

a chat with Frank and Mithren, get their side of the story for comparison purposes and to

make sure this is logged appropriately, Sergeant."" He glances at Boyd for a moment. ""If,

in fact, evidence suggests this was a matter of self-defense on their part, then we would

have cause to take an alternate course of action."" He smirks softly. ""Maybe even get all

parties to this situation together to see if we can discern the truth of the matter.""


Bill smiles at Boyd. ""Going to shoot me if I turn my back then?"" he asks. ""See how long I

stay dead?""


Boyd nods slowly. ""I see how it is. You do what you need to do then. Just remember that

Frank Mason can't be trusted. He's a cold blooded killer. And that this Mithren girl is

in cahoots with him,"" he says, backing away. ""And don't go making business you don't need,

Hickok,"" he adds coolly.


Riala glances at Stern. ""Let him go, Corporal, at least for now."" She turns back to Boyd.

""Thank you kindly for the information. But it is time for you to be going. Do not attack a

citizen of this city again.""


Stern nods, making his way over to stand next to Riala. ""As you wish, ma'am."" He folds

his hands behind his back, and quietly looks around.


Bill's smile turns back to it's normal passivity. ""Keep on moving, Boyd,"" he says calmly,

dismissively.


Boyd backs away, keeping his eyes on the collective group. He smiles a calm and cold

blooded smile. ""Thank you. I know you've helped me,"" he says as he backs off.


Boyd has applauded you! See 'Applaud #mine' to read it.

Boyd forces the door open and steps inside.

Boyd has left.


Matt watches Boyd leave, then looks around at the crowd ""Well I've got more patrolling to

do."" He gives a quick salute to Riala ""Sergeant."" before turning to head further down the

road.





Stern frowns a bit. ""Guh... reminds me of the time I had to find some salvage at Mall of

America... Fat Tony and his crew made my skin crawl."" He glances at Riala, frowning. ""Are

we certain he was lying?""


Bill watches Boyd until he's out of sight; then the old gunslinger hefts a sigh, as if he

carried the weight of the world upon his shoulders. Or perhaps conscience.


Riala nods at Stern. ""Absolutely. That's a man full of hate and spite, and he was lying

through his teeth. There's no way to fake that. Especially since he didn't know of my

ability in the first place.""


Bill remarks, ""It was in his tone. If anything, I'd bet he killed his partner- if the

fellow existed in the first place. He's been heeling me all day.""



Matt has disconnected.

You have applauded Matt.

Stern nods. ""I'd still suggest we let the other two folks know about this."" He glances at

Bill, arching an eyebrow. ""Pardon my asking, but are you truly James Butler Hickok?""


+++ Stern just looked at you!

Riala nods at Stern. ""That is precisely what we will do."" She looks over at Bill, ""He had a

partner. He told that much truth. He even spoke truth about there being a meeting, but I

believe the truth of the matter is that he and his 'partner' attacked Mister MAson and Miss

Westfall.""


Bill's gray eyes turn to observe Stern. ""I am,"" he says simply. ""And who might you be?""


Stern smiles a bit. ""Nobody you'd know, I'm afraid. Call me a boyhood admirer, though."" 

He sticks out a gloved hand. ""Jake Stern.


Riala frowns a bit, then raises an eyebrow. ""I feel I'm missing something. Would either of

you care to explain?""


Stern smirks a bit, glancing at Riala. ""This would be history for me... but Mr. Hickok

here is a living legend from where I come from...""


Bill shakes Stern's hand. It's a firm grip, followed by A quick release. ""Well, Nice to

meet you, Mr. Stern. It's a pleasure to meet an admirer.""


Riala huhs, and shakes her head. ""The Mists have a strange way of bringing people together.

Well, if you two will excuse me, I have a file to read and my dinner to get.""


Stern grins softly. ""Anytime."" He nods at Riala. ""Take care, sergeant... I'll be back on

duty again tomorrow, most likely...""


Bill tips his hat lightly to Riala. ""Enjoy your night and dinner, ma'am."" His attention

then sidles back to Stern.


Riala shakes a finger at Stern. ""No more training sessions with corpses for you."" Then she

heads into the Fiddler's Green, shaking her head.

Riala has disconnected.



Stern rolls his eyes, and smirks. ""If only she knew the worst part of it..."" He looks

back at Bill, smiling. ""Sorry... just rare that one gets to meet someone like yourself.""

Bill remarks, ""I've gotten that a lot since comin' here.""

Stern smirks. ""I can imagine..."" He rubs his head a bit, and looks around. ""I'm afraid I

shouldn't stay long. Was on my way to chat with one of the doctor's here...""

You say, ""Keep an eye out for Matt, if you can. The kid worries me; make sure he don't

shoot himself on accident. ""

Stern chuckles. ""He's alright, if a little bit trigger-happy. Trust me, I try to keep

tabs on 'im when I can.""

You say, ""The other night he and his cat fell down the flight of stairs at the Green. Don't

know how he didn't break his damn fool neck."" He shakes his head, ""He must've stolen his

cat's nine lives, if you ask me."" ""

Stern arches an eyebrow, and nods. ""Hrm... I'll ask him about that."" he coughs a little,

sounding slightly consumptive. ""If you'll excuse me... hate to run out on you... but I

really do need to be going.""

Bill nods. ""Night."" he says, and then heads off himself, moving not at a swagger but with a

bold stride. Wild Bill owns the world, and don't you know it. He doesn't need to swagger."

Yes, Bill is TK's resident version of J.B. Hickok.
This blog'll be a place for notes, logs, icons and general rambling about his version, as well as IC journaling and IC letter-writing. My J.B. is based primarily on the HBO serries Deadwood, a bit on historical information, and a lot on bull. That being said, while I will make an effort towards history, my bill is *NOT* necessarily historical; and being in the mists a long time HAS affected his character.

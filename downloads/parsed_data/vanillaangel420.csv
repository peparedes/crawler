"event","Well, I'm at my parent's again. My stupid Neopets account has been frozen and I don't really care....it was the most stupidest waste of time of my life. I've wasted over 2 years on that bullshit so whatever, time to move on and grow up from the internet pets. Internet pets are for people with no lives, and I have a life. I go downtown and socialize with people all the time, I make plans with my friends and chill with them. And I've found a real joy in walking aswell, I'm happy when I'm walking...music blaring, energy flowing, adrenaline pumping. I love it! 

Anyway, I'm gonna go play some games, or some shit. PeAcE!!"

"event","Hahahahaha! Well, this weekend had been pretty crazy. I got my NEW computer on Friday that my parent's baught for me. The net doesn't exactly work at the moment which is why I am at my parent's place doing the online thing....I'm going back to hell tonight. 

But after I had the comp set up, I went over to MY best friend's place and chilled all night. He even gave me a ""candy"" pill to have some fun, and did I ever. I was fucked for like 24 hours (from midnight Friday night to midnight Saturday night), but I had so much fun. Minus a few things that irritated me, it was great. 

What's even funnier, and something that's been bugging at me like a giant thorn in my side is that my stupid roomie thinks that I turned him (my best friend who used to be hers) against her.....UM, HELLO!!! She did it all on her own, I didn't say shit to fucking turn him against her. I made use of my time and walked over, I picked up the phone and called him and made plans. I've offered to help him pack his grandma's things when she was gonna move, and he took me up on my offer and it was some of the best memories I'll ever have. I've offered to baby sit his kid #1 (just recently had #2), both girls and absolutely adorable. And I have never once lied to him about anything, nor will I.  

And for the record, I DO NOT FUCKING LIE!!!! I haven't lied to anyone in years and years, and before that I would only lie to my parent's and teachers. Got away with a lot of skipped classes...lol! Anyway, I'm hungry so I'm gonna go shove something in my stomach to shut it up. PeAcE!!"

"event","Well, Here I am at Operation Go Home again.....not sure how much longer I'll be posting from here, but I will do what I must to get things done. If I have to come here almost everyday for a fucking month, so be it.....however, once I get the old computer from my dad and get the dial-up hooked up, the phone line is mine. 

I've already changed the message for the phone and it's only a matter of time until I change the passcode for the message box, she doesn't pay for her part in the phone, she doesn't get the privlidges of using the message box. Or giving the number to anyone else....it is no longer partly her phone, I pay for the whole thing, IT'S MY PHONE!!!! 

But, other than that......things are just great....got a refill of my sleeping pills. And I'm socializing with more people now....even a couple people that I know from Vars are popping up down here and they're surprised to see me down here.....uhhhh, been coming down here for 6 years now, going on the start of year 7. But, oh well...I'm not bothering with people who don't care about me. Either love me for me with all my damn flaws, or get the fuck out of my life!! Anyway, I'm out...got a few more things online to check out. PeAcE!!"

So I paid the whole phone bill and therefore I have every damn right to change the message.....it's MY phone now....my dad's even giving me the old computer and getting me a connection through Carelton U for dial-up. LOL!! And it may be a shitty ass computer and I have cursed at the damn thing many many times, however it gives me access to my email. 

So, other than that.....things are pretty good, my cold's almost gone so that's a good thing. I baught a new phone yesterday too, one with a cord cause the battery pack on my portable sux ass so this will do for now until I can get a new battery pack. Now I'm going to attempt the Neopets on this comp. TTYL!!!!"

It'd be working on an assembly line filling, capping, labelling, and cleaning bottles to stick into boxes. Pretty routine work if you ask me. And my friend just so happens to be the manager of this place which is some very kool beans. LOL! $8.50/hour with 40/hour weeks.....in one month, I'd make $1,360. That's definately enough to cover first and last month of any place I go to.....and I'm definately saving up. Blah! Getting distracted so I'm gonna go. Bye!"

"event","Well, apparently my roomie has taken her piece of crap comp back, and I really don't care anymore. She can have fun paying for the internet herself, why should I pay for something that I can't use. She says I acted like the comp was mine, which I didn't....I barely even use it anymore anyway. I used to get up, make my coffee, take my pills, get my utensils ready to smoke a joint, fill my cat's food and water dish, and then turn on the comp and go on for max 3 hours now cause any longer and my eyes hurt. Then I would jump into the shower and go out till 9-midnight. 

I didn't piss and moan when she wanted the comp, I'd say just a second to either finish whatever game I was playing on Neopets or to say bye to whoever I was talking to and then I'd be off. And I used to be on so much in the morning cause I would get up around 7-8am and my roomie wouldn't wake up till 1, 2, sometimes 3pm in the afternoon. And 75% of the time, I'd be off the comp by 11am. I'd basicly be out the door by the time she even woke up.

This just gives me more reason to walk downtown and lose more weight in the process. I lost over 40 lbs within the first couple months of moving out of my parents place and walking downtown and walking to see my friends is what's keeping the weight off. The last few days I've learned alot in how to deal with my problems. And the 45 walk downtown gives me the time I need to think about my life. So, she thinks this is punishment...hahahahaha!!! It's a blessing in disguise. It just took a lil while for me to realize it. 

In the beginning I was so furious that I couldn't even think straight, now...I am calm and collected and thinking properly. Like the Pheonix who regenerates itself from it's own ashes, I have been reborn. A new light has formed at the end of the tunnel, and I'm walking towards it with a smile on my face. I am changing and growing and accepting what comes with it. Now it's time to go eat, I'm outie! PeAcE!!"

"event","Well, I'm at my parent's place now....my coffee date didn't show, but I don't mind. I got to see a few people anyway, which was good. But, boy....do my legs ever hurt. From walking almost 15 hours yesterday and about 3.5 hours this morning. I got a major burn yesterday aswell, my nose is burnt to shit....I look like Rudolph! LOL! 

But, I learned a lot about myself while downtown last night. I talked with a guy yesterday who, I have to say, was a very good judge of character. He pin pointed a lot of different things about my life, and my mind. He even baught me something soft to eat considering I just had a tooth pulled...lol! I even told him he didn't have to but he refused to take no for an answer. 

So, I had a pretty ok night. I got home close to midnight and just passed out. I was wiped....and add that with the walking this morning and oi....my legs are dead. But, it'll be worth it in the end. I'm walking more and more now that it's not winter so I'm gonna lose alot more weight, that is unless it just keeps building my legs muscles. 

Anyway, I'm gonna go get something to eat....I'm hungry. Bye!"

He was supposed to be here at 10am, and it's just past 10:30 now.....grrrrr, that lil fuck better not ditch me. I don't need the guy that raised my spirits yesterday to dash them today. That would completely suck ass! 

Right now, I'm just sitting here, trying to kill some time and hope he shows up soon. I have no smokes so I don't have to ""go out"" for one. Which I guess is good for the hole I have in my mouth from getting my tooth pulled. Grr fucking arg!!! I am getting quite bored with waiting, and I have to be back in Vanier before 3pm cause my dad's comin to pick me up for the weekend.

And I swear, next person to kick my chair is getting bitched at....grrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!! And I have about 15 minutes left on this computer and I kinda can't go do my neopets cuz this comp won't let me download the flash plugin that I need to do it. So fuck! Anyway, I'm just gonna go.

Like WTF is that, I am so fucking infuriated I don't even know what's what anymore. I don't even know why the hell she did it, possibly because of my last entry but ya know what? I don't fucking care......she won't let me online, she can't use the phone! I don't even know what the hell her deal is and I don't fucking care anymore. I don't even know what to fucking say anymore. I've just been cursing since I got home at one in the morning and realized that I couldn't get on the computer. When I woke up this morning, I was like ""why did you change the password?"" she said ""cuz you're not allowed on it"" I'm like ""why?"" she said ""that's what you get for being a bitch!"" All I ever fucking did was bitch about fucking cleaning and be a fucking friend cuz friends tell you what you need to know even if it's hurtful. HELLO! The truth fucking hurts!!! Anyway, I'm gonna make the best of the 10 minutes I have left on the computer and go do my stupid ass neopets. BYE!"

"event","Ok, I'm not sure how long this one's gonna get but I have a lot on my fucking head right now. I just read my roomie's entry and got quite irritated. She thinks that I get all this shit, free smokes blah blah, but that doesn't mean I don't feel bad for my parents. They have NO MONEY, and when they give me stuff I get lectured from ear to ear. ""Don't smoke it all like air, don't hand your smokes out like candy, etc."" 

But, I am a nice person, at least I try to be which is why I give my roomie smokes when she has nothing, and smoke her on weed when she has nothing. I used to hand her 10 smokes at a time when she had nothing, but I never got that generosity in return, I always have to ask when I'm out. She rarely has to ask me for smokes because I beat her to it and toss her a couple before she even asks me. And even though I get the smokes and the weed, I get the food once every couple months. My roomie can also easily walk to her mom's house and get a few things if she needs it, however in my case...my parent's live in the middle of fucking nowhere. I can't hop, skip, and jump over to their house whenever I need something.

Sure, my parent's are great for supporting my nicotine habit, but I don't like to mooch off them, but I have absolutely no other choice. I don't like the fact that I'm broke every month and if this job thing don't pan out, one of my other friends might be able to get a job at where she is. Which would be good, howvere I will not blow my money on weed or booze....I will be saving it up to be able to move again. Minus a trip to the SUPER EX on August 21st which is the day Joel from Distant Society is playing. Definately gotta go on that day!!

And I just counted how many smokes I have and I have 61 left. Joy oh joy!! I also have almost no cat food left and my cat is starting to get feline acne again cause he keeps drinking from my roomie's cat's plastic water dish. If I could change them to glass I would, but she'd probably bitch like no tomorrow. Just like how she bitches when I leave her notes asking her to do things that she should be doing naturally on her own. Like, she admits to being lazy and in a previous entry of hers she stated that ""why should I pick up after other lazy people when I make enough of a mess on my own"" (something like that) and that is quite true. She is one of the messiest cooks that I have ever seen! And I luv the gurl and all but shit, she is definately her mother's daughter.

However, the fact that she keeps useing her EX as an excuse not to clean is getting quite tiresome. ""I cleaned all the time, cooked all the time, etc, etc"" Gee, welcome to my world.....I may not cook for her and her b/f, but I clean and pick up after them like no tomorrow. Think I'm not tired?? Think I'm not fed up?? I'm down right exhausted, but I keep going and going because this appartment will not clean itself. 

My back and body may hurt and ache, but I continue to strain myself to keep this place presentable and clean. I have never lived the slob life and I never will. I can be coughing up blood and have cramped muscles and I will still pick up a broom and mop and clean this place from top to fucking bottom just because the sight of dirt and filth disgusts me. The amount of cat hair that collects in this place is absolutely insane, I'm surprised that it hasn't caused a fire behind the damn TV! It's a danger hazard and I'm the one who gets rid of it the best that I can. 

Also, in a previous comment that my roomie had left me...""If I know people will do things for me, I won't do it, but I will help more, I promise!"" Uh-huh, riiiiiiiight! *Rollz eyez* She may not like people telling her what to do, and I barely ever do. I know my own responsibilities and I accomplish them without anyone telling me to do it, I just keep hoping that she will pick up on my habits, fat chance. She will start to realize that the only person that she can fully depend on is herself, not everyone else. One day she will wake up and she WILL realize that no one will help her anymore and she will have to do things for herself. Once moving day comes, she's on her own and won't have me there to clean for her. 

And she may piss and moan about me writing this, but I'm just gonna take her approach to it. ""I don't fucking care anymore about what people think, I will bitch about what I wanna bitch about whenever the fuck I please! Get it! Got it! Good!"" No one tells me what to do because no one fucking has to tell me what to do because I do it on my own without having people to tell me to do it. It's called responsibility!! It is my responsibility to run a clean and healthy household, it is my responsibility to get a job and look out for myself because I KNOW no one else will do it for me and if you want something done right, you fucking do it yourself! 

Anyway, I need to jump into the shower considering I have a dentist appointment today and it is my RESPONSIBILITY to be there on time. I'm done ranting for now, I'm out! PeAcE!"

"event","Well, I went out last night with one of my friends (the big bro), not really expecting anything major to happen. First of all, I got fed supper at the place where my friend is staying. 

After that, we walked downtown in the rain and met up with one of his friends. We all went to Minglewoods and she baught a pitcher, so I got a wee bit buzzed off my glass. I didn't even get asked for my ID considering I don't really have any. 

So, I had fun there.....we then trekked around downtown for a bit. Ran into a few friends, which is always good....I love getting my huggz!! We even walked over the EVIL BRIDGE to Hull...after this I started to get dehydration dizzy spells so later on the the evening, I parted ways with my ""big bro"" and walked around a bit on my lonesome. 

Ran into one of my chickitas and chilled with her for a little bit and tried cheering her up cause she was stressin about quite a bit of shit. Shortly after 9pm I decided to head home, my back was hurting from walking so much and I was getting cold. I got home just before 9:30pm and everyone was passed out, so I went online and smoked the last of my roaches....got real fucking stoned!!

It is now 10:30am and my roomie just left with her b/f and his best friend to go out to eat once again....and once again, I am left out. And they wonder why I'm always grumpie, it doesn't help when my fucking roommate keeps walking over my fucking carpet with her big ass klunky fucking boots. ARG!!!! Like, my dad is one thing, he needs the arch support from his shoes....but she doesn't have that problem. And I don't care if I walk over my carpet and the floors considering I'm the one who cleans them. If it was her carpet, I wouldn't really give two shits, but it's MY carpet and it's hard enough to keep it clean without people tracking dirt all over it. 

Also, within the last few days, I have given her and her b/f the equivilant to 1/4 of my carton of smokes. If this keeps up, I'm gonna be out of smokes within the next couple days. And I love them to pieces, I do....but I can't do this anymore. She best be forkin over at least 15 smokes when she gets her next carton. Anyway, I'm going to take a fucking shower, and then clean this appartment AGAIN. I hate living in filth, it's disgusting......maybe i'll clean before my shower. Yup, that's what I'm gonna do. I'm outie! PeAcE!!"

hard to beat. When video games werent just some pulp crap with a half assed
story line with a half naked girl with big guns and obnoxiously large breasts.

I miss Alex Mack, Mummies Alive!, Cadillacs and Dinosaurs, Under The Umbrella Tree....my sister and I actually have part of one of the Christmas episodes on tape, we just stumbled upon it....hahahahahah!!!! Even tho I never owned a digital pet, I found no need for them....annoying lil noise makers. However, Nintendo games were easy for me, less fucking god damn buttons, with NO vibrators...lol!

It has always, ALWAYS been hard for me to verbally say things to people,and when I do verbally communicate with others, it's on a one-on-one basis. It's especially hard when it comes to asking people to help me (or do their part in household chores). I have a habit of leaving little notes for people, and writing letters when I have something to say. 

When I write, I can think about what I am going to say....when I verbally say shit, my tounge gets tied and nothing ever comes out right. Which is also why I don't really talk when I'm chilling with people; I'm always afraid that I'm going to say the wrong thing and embarrass myself, and more often than not that is exactly what happens. I am quick to shoot off my mouth when I talk which is why I DON'T TALK!

I still hold a lot of anger within my soul and that comes out in almost everything that I do....and until I find the right way for me to release this anger, it will continue to show in my facial expressions, in my tone of voice, in everything that I do. And if some can't understand that, well I'm sorrie, but I have always been like this...I can't explain it nor is it easy for me to change it. 

Also, any time that I do make some progress, something always happens for me to regress to the state that I was in. Now that I have 10X the stress than I had a year ago at this time, it is even harder for me to find the time to be able to work on my mental problems adequately. Most of my time is spent thinking and going over plan after plan attempting to get my life started. Worrying about bills, rent, finding a trust-worthy roommate before August, acquiring the funds to be able to move again are just a few of the things that are weighing down on my shoulders at the present moment.

Furthermore, I would like to say that I'm sorrie for lacking the ability to verbally communicate with others and only being able to communicate on a one-on-one basis. Even though I shouldn't even really have to say I'm sorrie, people should accept me for who the fuck I am. I've always been an introvert and I can't change that fact, I can only find ways to deal with it and find ways to get my message across and writing is how I deal with it. There's not much I can really do to change that aspect about me and I've accepted that. Don't like it, oh well....that ain't my fault. Sue me for being shy and having to expess myself through writing. 

I have enough of a hard time meeting new people because I lack the ability to verbally communicate with other people. And to those who have known me for a long time and have accepted this fact about me, thank you....and to those who are just getting to know me, have patience with me....and to those who try to push me into verbally communicating things, DON'T! I am slowly working on changing this aspect of mine and any type of pressure to do it quickly regresses me, so please...just give me time and be patient with me. I am doing the best I can with the amount of stress that I have to sort through and it's extremely hard and I don't need any exterior forces trying to make this process go faster. The fact that I write in this so often shows that I am making at least some progress in trying to communicate.

So, if the fact that I need to write to say things buggz anyone...I'm sorrie but fucking deal with it, I have to on a daily basis so give me a break! At least I'm communicating in some way instead of holding EVERYTHING in and not talking to a single person. So what would you rather have, a slow steady-flowing lava flow (in which you can escape) or a huge ass eruption that could follow with devastating consequences. Right now I am a steady-flow of lava; however, if people push me, I'll clam up and explode. It has already happened once and I really don't need it happening again, the first blow up was scary enough. 

In closing, I would like to say that it was quite difficult to make this entry considering it's about a topic I don't like to talk about. I don't the fact that I'm an introvert and I don't like the fact that I'm shy to the point where it cripples my ability to make new friends and communicate to my current friends. I don't like the fact that I can't verbally express myself to other people and that I HAVE to do it through writing. I've written so many poems because of the fact that I can't verbally communicate my feelings to my loved ones. And even though I don't like this fact about me, I have come to deal and accept it as a part of me. Please try to do the same. I'm out! PeAcE!"

I packed away all my fragiles and stuff, they were collecting too much dust.....I never realized how little time it takes a tiny appartment to get dirty. It's quite disgusting actually.....and you're talkin to the Queen of Clean so of course I'm gonna say it's disgusting. 

Right now I'm just chillin a bit and might possibly roll a pinner before I go on, actually I am going to do just that....hold on...

~*~*~*~*~*~~*~*~*~*~*~~*~*~*~*~*~~*~*~*~*~*~~*~*~*~*~*~~*~*~*~*~*~

Doober is rolled, now I am ready to ramble for a little bit. Tee, hee, hee! Yeah...I am an odd one...lol! But, hey...gotta love me for bein me. No one can ever change me, and if people don't want to accept me for me....here's a quarter, call someone who cares. LOL! I'm not gonna go boo-hooing over people who don't care about me. However, I hate it even more when people PRETEND to be my friend only to USE me and ABUSE my generosity. It has happened time and time again where I have turned into the most downright selfish bitch. I did not care who the hell you were, you wouldn't get anything from me. No smokes, no smoke-ups, nothing! I am slowly turning into that person again. 

Now that I live on my own, I can NOT afford to do this anymore. And, I love to smoke my friends, and I would love to smoke every new pothead that I meet. But, I can only do this very rarely now. For the longest time, I have been a solitary toker. The only time I would smoke people is if people came over or I would go downtown, and going downtown was my down fall. Sure, I met a few decent people during my ventures down there. However, most that I have come across are mooching little fucks who kick a gift horse in the mouth. Who are also major heat scores when they do get high. It's pathetic and most of all embarrassing....especially if some of them are over 18 and act like they're 13. It drives me crazy considering that the rare time I do smoke in public places I get extremely paranoid. 

Anyway, I'm gonna put some things away, make something to eat, and go to bed....my back hurts...oi! I'm outie...PeAcE!!"

Little did I know I was gonna run into someone I had met at the Super Ex last year with my roomie before we were roomie's. I met a few new people, and got smoked on so many joints and had 2 jamacian showers....it was all very unexpected. But, I had a blast...I even got to hold the new babie....and I've never held a newborn in my life. She's sooo tiny...lol! 

I got to spend some one on one time with my best friend when he walked me home considering his bday's in, well...tomorrow technically...lol! I miss my walks with him, we talk about so much....from the weather to what's stressing us out. We haven't had them very much cause I've been going downtown and he's been busy aswell. But, it was good to chill with him for about 6 hours. 

But, I had a great night, even got praised for my massage talents aswell for 1/8 of the night....it was hilarious! But, I liked it...made me feel good, to be appreciated. Gave me that good ol' warm and fuzzy feeling...LOL!!

Well, I had my interview yesterday and it went pretty well as far as I could tell. I walked all the way back downtown from Bronson like I used to when I had my anger management in the same building. LOL! I walked around downtown for a bit, then got something to eat, and decided to drop by Operation Go Home. I walked up the stairs and the first face I see is the guy I've kinda been crushing on lately. He's gonna be 26 in September, quite the people person, extremely polite, and very intellectual. I wanna pick at his brain.

Anyway, that put a huge ass smile on my face....a little later on I invited him back to my place to smoke a doober (kinda my ritual in getting to know someone if they toke). But, I had to buy toilet paper at Giant Tiger before we could leave. After I baught it, he carried the bag from GT to the bus stop, onto the bus, and then to my place. He had to go to the bathroom, so he took in the bag, opened it, and put a new roll on the holder. LOL! I didn't even ask him to do any of this. But, I greatly appreciated it. 

He could only stay for a little bit considering he had to meet up with a friend at 2pm....but, I hope the next time he visits he can stay longer. I like being around him, he makes me laugh and forget about the many problems I have...even for a split second. And his hugz....*melts into big puddle of goo* LOL! He smells good too...hehehehe!!! *BLUSH* And even though I met him downtown, he's not a ""downtowner"" like most of the people I have met.

All I know is that it holds more meaning to me now than it ever has before. Like, the first month I lived away from home, I freaked out! All I could do was smoke weed....I could barely eat, barely sleep, barely even think straight. Within that first month it was clear to me that my stress was severly attacking my body because my back broke out in muscle knots and I've become a chain smoker in attempt to destress and it's wreaking havoc on my body. Now with the month of moving slowly looming over my head, I am just flippin!

I'm gonna have to get up around 5am and my roomie and her b/f haven't even gone to bed yet. I think he's crashing now, but she's playing video games on TV. I honestly don't know how they can stay up all night and then sleep all day. It's a very bad schedule to keep. And if I get this job, I'll be up at 5am Monday to Friday, and probably back home around 6pm. That gives me about an hour to eat and then about 2 hours online....in bed by 10pm. So, I think some compromises might be needed. 

The only time I'll be able to clean will be on the weekend and that will basicly be twice a month considering 2 weekends out of every month is spent at my parent's place. That will be my life for about 6 months with moving smack dab in the middle. So, I am stressed out to say the least. I don't know where I'm gonna be, who I'll be with, how I'll be moving my stuff. 

And I pray to God that I get the job because I need the money to be able to move. With the amount of big furniture that I have, I NEED to rent a U-Haul truck and get my dad to drive but other people to help me move. My dad can NOT do it this time, I refuse to let him carry any big furniture, I don't even like him taking my laundry bag which is why I do it most of the time. He's a stubborn old fart and I definately inherited his stubborness. LOL! 

Now I'm smoking a doober so I'll probably start rambling even more. LoL! Right now I'm just shaking my head in amazment at how into a video games people can get, the main game you will see me playing is Mario Kart. Went through my DK64 phase, got bored with it. But, there's one game that I only played a couple times on Playstation that I absolutely love, it's Hydro Thunder!! However, you'll mainly find me playing online puzzle games. I also don't play most games because of DK64...I sat infront of that TV for hours and hours on end and I'm not gonna let that happen again. I'll stick with the computer, at least I can do more things. 

Anyway, my tummie is grumbling like a mother fucker so I'm going to make a lil something to stick in it; and then do the dishes and then clean the kitchen and the bathroom. Joy oh Joy!! PeAcE!"

"event","Well, here I am once again.....had quite the eventful day today. First of all I didn't go to bed until 4:30am and got woken up by the phone. It was about the Woman's Employability Workshop in which I will get paid for it. It's a 6 month thing (I'm pretty sure); and if it's like the program did before, I will have an extra $1,200 a month for 6 months. Which will help greatly considering that I have to move at the end of August and I have no idea where I will be or who I will be with. 

I'm so stressed out about this, and about the other responsibilities that I have that I'm breaking down because of it. Like, I came home today and I was in the kitchen wiping crumbs off the counter that I do almost on a daily basis, then I just broke down in tears. I don't know what's wrong with me lately. In my mind or my body. 

I've been coughing up blood for 8 days now, but my ablilty to breathe has gotten easier....the muscles around my ribs are starting to go back to normal. The knots in my shoulders are being stubborn lil golfballs, poppin in and out from underneath my shoulderblade. And I know over half my health problems are related to stress. And the more I try to destress my life the more stressed out I get. I literally stress out about my stress and it's taking it's toll on my body. Some days, my muscle knots bug me so much that I literally can't function properly. And I've been trying to fix my posture aswell, but most of my knots are preventing that and it hurts. 

But, what hurts even more is the God damb toothache I have. Cause right at the back of my mouth the furthest tooth on the left side has almost completely disintegrated and OMG does it ever fucking hurt. It's mainly cuz the wisdom teeth I had there weren't taken out for at least 2 years. It's almost like my body is falling apart from the inside out and my mental state is just so depressed as of late. 

I just dread that I won't be able to finmd a place and I will be fucked...I have my cat and way too much furniture and stuff to let that happen. If I could live by myself, it would be great...but with what welfare gives me is not enough and this program thing is only six months and I still have to have the interview on the 17th. The girl that called told me to be there at 9am sharp or don't bother coming. Like, rude much. 

And inbetween the phone call and coming home, I went downtown. And I don't take the bus when I'm going downtown, it's takes me about 40 minutes to walk downtown and I walk around for hours on end and then I walk home. I did that for the last two days and my entire body is acheing from head to toe. Anyway, I'm am going to retire for the night and take my sweet sleeping pills. (Which are also an anti-psychotic...lol!)

I'm probably gonna go to the clinic tomorrow, or Tuesday; depends on if my mom's coming to see me or not. It still hurts to take deep breaths, yawn, cough, and definatly sneeze....the pain's only on the right side so I don't exactly know what is wrong yet. It may be from smoking, may not be....I am not sure. 

But, I'm not making this a long entry cause I hurt and took my sleeping pills so they should be kicking in soon. However, I definatly over exerted myself cleaning the kitchen today, but I couldn't stand looking at the nastiness any longer. It was fucking disgusting...and I do admit that my roomie has been helping out a little more than she was, which I am greatful for. But, I would also like to remind her that: ""I am your FRIEND, not your MOTHER...I didn't move in with you to pick up after you. Next time the dish towel or the mop may be thrown at you...lol!""

However, during the recent pain I've been going through I haven't gotten much help....I tossed the drying towel at her b/f (lil bro) after I did the dishes today and I had to go lie down cause I was hurting bad. I didn't mean to ""order"" him to do it, but she pays bills and he doesn't and he seriously need to start contributing towards this house hold or a can of whoopass will have to be opened...lol! 

And I love him to pieces, I do....he has been an amazing friend to me for many years now and I wouldn't think of calling anyone else my little brother. He has been there for me when I needed someone to talk to, or when I needed a shoulder to cry on. I am just concerned about his future, I don't want to see him waste his life sitting infront of a TV playing video games. He needs to get off his skinny lil butt and DO something, anything. There are under-the-table jobs out there that he can apply for. I just don't want to see him waste his life away.

Yay, my roomie just found her magic bag....sweet heat for my side which I am going to enjoy very shortly...after another smoke. Ya, ya...smokin bad for lungs. *Slaps hand* So much for not making a long entry. Anyway, it's time for me to retire to my comfy double bed with the glory of a heating pad. Good Night!"

I went to the Urgent Care Clinic and they Xrayed me and said nothing was wrong....just a case of pulled muscles and ripped capilaries from coughing. My dad drove me back home. I took a HOT bath after I got home and the pain increased so much afterward. Around 12:30am I called my dad in serious pain and he came and picked me up around 1:30am, we waited at the Montfort until 3:30am and I told him I was tired of waiting. When I got home, I went straight to bed. This morning I woke up around 8am and around 9am I went and picked up some Robax platnium and Extra Strengeth Advil. Took a nap shortly afterward.

It started off with me having to go get my blood taken at the clinic, that was fine minus having to fast for it. My day didn't start going to shit until I went to go buy my bus tickets. First, I lose $10 right out of my pocket....all I know is I lost it somewhere during my lil walk from upstairs to downstairs. So that's pissed off reason #1. 

Now for the main course.....for about a week and a half now my so-called fiancee has been completely avoiding me and ignoring me. On Thursday night I came online and he was on, and so was my sister who has him on her list aswell. I said hi to him and all he said to me was ""hoop your forehead bitch"" and logged off, but he didn't log off because my sister was still talking to him. And then she added me to the convo and he said the same thing (""hoop your forehead bitch""). Then he left and blocked her.....but he forgot our other emails, so her and i logged on to our other accounts (Appear Offline) and saw him still online. 

My sister, my roomie, and I all sent emails to him....my roomie's the only one who got a reply and she sent it to both me and my sister. I read this when I got home today....I was pissed to say the least and the more I think about it, the more pissed off I fucking get. I'm smoking a joint just to try to calm myself down but I am just simmering....I knew it was gonna happen, but come on now...""hoop your forehead bitch"". Pathetic!! 

Sure, I have my immature tendencies, but this guy does not know how to fucking commit to anything. Ya, he took care of me when we lived on the streets, but I learned shit. He may be the one longest relationship that I had but an ex is an ex and I am sooooooooo sticking to that from now on. Fuck this ex bullshit, memories are to remain memories....and when you try to bring the past into the present.....you WILL get fucked over royally...at least in my case anyway. And right now, shit's just waiting to hit the fan....I'm a volcano waiting for the next earthquake to explode. I'm so angry that it's making me weak and I can't even talk, all I can do is write at the present moment. My muscles are tense as hell and I can't make sense of one thing or another.

Right now I'm smoking a joint to try and get my mind to go at least somewhat numb. Half the stress I'm under is my own doing, however...I can't change over night. 

And I'm stressing so much about moving cause I don't know where to go, who to be a roommate with, and how the fuck I'm gonna move all my furniture. I know for a fact I can't afford to live on my own so I have to find a roommate before August. 

One who perferably smokes weed (or doesn't care if I do), isn't allergic to cats, and having a comp would be a big bonus, someone who is organized would be an even bigger bonus. I don't need to clean sweep anyone else. Clean sweeping myself is a hard enough task as it is and I do it periodicly. 

I am slowly getting more and more organized, took me a while cause I'm still not 100% used to living on my own....fuck, I go to my parent's place every two weeks and stay the whole weekend, kitty come with me back and forth too. Along with a giant duffel bag of laundry, and a back pack and a bag for my binder and shit....and a bag of all my bathroom stuff and hair products...lol!!!

Man, this constant page moving is getting so fucking annoying!!!! GRRRRR AAARRRGGG!!! I pooched my doob....gonna smoke the rest when I wake up. I'm gonna have a smoke and finish this off without wanting to scream from constant page movement. 

But ya, so far I'm doing better than I thought I would be living on my own even though this whole building is practically falling apart. The front of the places has gaps and falling off exterior panelling...almost the whole eavestrough on our side has fallen down, the trees have grown into the wires, I could take apart our back porch with my own hands....there's only a pile of boulders and rocks supporting the front steps. All the floors are slanted like crazy; our bathtub tap has even shot out of the wall (landlord did a poor cocking job aswell). I honestly DO NOT feel safe at all in this building....I'm sometimes scared to fall asleep at night cause I think I'll wake up and the whole front of the place has fallen down. Like shit man, major accidents waiting to happen and no one will do anything till someone does get hurt. 

Who says watching TV doesn't teach you anything, I've learned so much from watching Holmes on Homes and I suggest that everyone watch that show. Anyway, I'm going to bed....Night!!"

I don't know what the fuck to do anymore....I have such a heavy feeling hanging over my heart that it's not even funnie. I was playing a game on Neopets and I just felt tears swell up underneath my eye lids....gee, maybe it's cause I'm being completely ignored by my so-called fiancee. I love him, I truly do which is why this hurts so fucking much. The way things are going, he's gonna lose me before anything even gets started. 

I'm just so fucking pissed off and upset that I don't even know what to do right now. If I had money, I'd be getting shitfaced like no tomorrow. Hopefully this doob I'm about to spark will cheer me up somewhat, but I don't think it will work that well. But, it might....who knows. I'm just, fuck...blah.....almost ready to say fuck it to it all!!!!

"event","I am getting so tired of this bullshit that is supposed to be called a relationship. He says he loves me and has never stopped and wants to spend the rest of his life with me; yet he never calls me back when he says he will, completely ignores me online. 

We'd be on a video conversation and he completely doesn't pay attention and ignores me. He so can not multitask for shit, his excuse for not calling me back is ""I was baked""......UM, HELLOOOOOOO!!!! POTHEAD RIGHT FUCKING HERE!!!!! I can do a multitude of things when I am high or drunk. So, how hard is it to talk on MSN when you're smoking a joint or drinking?? I'm smoking a joint and writing this as we speak. Oh my gosh, what an accomplishment....MULTITASKING!!! However, I do know my fair share of stupid fucking stoners, I guess he just turned into one over the time we didn't talk. He's almost 30 for fuck's sake and I can act 10X more mature than him. 

He says he's gonna come back to Ottawa to see me, well....if he doesn't start actually paying some fucking attention to me, he's gonna fucking lose me before he even gets back. I am absolutely fucking fed up with these stupid ass games of his. It's fucking pathetic!!

"event","Here I am again, hopefully this time the page doesn't move on it's own on me, but it probably will...ahhhhhh, it's already starting. Oh well, I'll grin and bear it. 

Anyway, today started with me hitting my snooze button around 4-5 times. I eventually crawled out of my bed, very sore on one side of my back....damn pulled muscles, EVIL! But, I got up anyway, with the intention of going downtown and buying stupid toilet paper again and I know for a fact it was my roomie's b/f's (my lil street bro's) time to buy it but whatever....what's done is done so fuck it! My roomie is also my friend and she reads all of these. 

Anyway, back to my long day....lol....I talked to our friend who was gonna come over today...said he's be here around one....well, 1 turned into 2 which turned into 3, and the bugger was still online. He's a hippie, and I love my hippie, hahahha....and he takes his time on everything; never in a rush type thing. Oh so mellow, like Jello....hahaha! And the bugger knew I wanted to go downtown before the damn sun went down....I didn't even end up leaving till just after 5 cause I ended up chatting with the roomie....lol (ain't it obvious by now I am never going to use names).

I walked downtown and our friend walked with me for part of the way then he went home and I kept walking. For the last 4 days I have walked downtown, and back 75% of the time. I met up with my sister downtown yesterday and like hell I was gonna make her walk to my place, so we took the bus and I bought 2 bustickets from a guy for 50 cents. Hahahahaha!!!! Something that is worth 1.90 and I gave him 50 cents.....it's all he asked for...lol!! 

ANYWAY....I walked downtown, headphones blaring as usual, 90% of the time I can't function on my own without it. When I walk out that door, it's on my head. It helps me zone out and focus and people have a hard time breaking that focus if I don't see them first. Some of my friend have had to grab my arm or something to get my attention. However, today I spotted some friends before I got to the Square (if you're not a downtowner, you will not know what the means) and then we walked up to Majors Hill, ran into more friends. I ran into one of my good friends who is like the big brother I never had, unlike some that I know, I respect him a lot and I guess you could say I kinda look up to him, even tho he's only a few months older than me. LOL! 

Anyway, I'm getting tired so I'm gonna wrap this up....there was a lot of bullshit downtown, fights, bloody noses and all. Just lovely...got the toiletpaper around 8:45pm then walked back with my ""big bro"" to where he stays and he refilled my whole pack of smokes. I thought he was just gonna give me like 10 smokes as payback for all the smokes he's gotten from me. But, he filled my pack up to it's 20 smoke capacity. It just made my day, even though it was hectic, that evened it all out. Then him and I watched Cabin Boy....that is a FUCKED UP movie. I can't even describe it, look it up on imdb.com cause I am so not explaining it. But, it was fucking hilarious!!! I gave the ""big bro"" a big hug before walking home at 11:30pmand walked in the door just shortly before midnight. And I made a 11:11pm wish that my roomie would me sleeping when I got home...it came true...lol! I just wanted to come home, change, go online and check my stuff, smoke my doobie and just relax. 

Now I am going to play a couple games and then pass out. I am sooo sleeping in!! PeAcE!!"

Probably gonna do the main entrance way aswell, who knows. I'm contemplating going to Mavrick's tonight for psy-trance too....still not fully decided yet. I'm just happily tokin on my doober, or shall I say chokin on my doober. LOL! I didn't put any tobacco in this one so it's not exactly what I'm used to. I was just too lazy to take out a smoke....lol! 

And I swear to God, every time this thing auto saves....either my page gets bigger or words move.... ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! ATTACK OF THE AUTOSAVED DRAFT!!!!!!! Run For Your Lives!!!!!!! Hahahahahahahaha!!!!  

Gee, can ya tell I'm high?! Puff, puff, pufffffffffff!! Wow, almost 3pm...the day is slowly creeping away from me....puff, puff, pufffffffffffffff.....I wonder why?? LOL!! It'll take me less than an hour to sweep and mop all the floors; as long as I don't have bodies in my way. I'm a Super Cleaning Mad Woman when I get going....all I need now is a kick ass vaccum and a damn Swiffer and I'm set....and possibly proper storage for everything.

*Sparks smoke*

Storage, organization, and cleanliness are the mosy key factors in actually making it in this world. I'm a lil Clean Sweep obsessed...ever since I started watching shows like Clean Sweep, While You Were Out, and Holmes On Homes; it has had a great impact on my life. I have learned much from these shows and when I go up to my parents place, I hunt for Holmes on Homes. Out of those 3 shows, I have learned the most from Mike Holmes...and If I were to ever build a house, Mike Holmes would be the one to oversee everything.

EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW.....I JUST HAD A BUG CRAWLING ON MY NECK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! EWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!! Felt like a beatle of some sort....YUCK! Ok....Time to clean! PeAcE!"

I hate it when people say they're gonna call and don't fucking call.....how hard is it to pick up a phone and call the one you say you love??? Like seriously....this is pathetic. When you say you're gonna do something, you do it...you don't put it off for later cause ""you don't feel like it right now, or got high, or got drunk"". Come on now....I am one who has used that excuse for years, except the drunk part. But, even then, when it came to calling people back...I always did when I said I would, half the time right on the minute. Maybe I am obsessive-compulsive about some things in my life, like how things are ordered, how things should be done, organization, punctuality, cleanliness, neatness. I'm a clean freak, I take after my mother...I am more my mother's daughter than I'd like to admit. And sometimes that scares me. However, those reasons will remain in my head and not online.

"event","Well, yesterday was a day of hell to say the least. One of my so-called friends had hacked into my email, changed my password (all while I was online MSN; he did everything through the web browser), sent emails to me, my sister and a few other random people all from my account. My sister and I spent hours fixing everything and getting my email back to me considering this person sent her the password. 

We confronted ""our friend"" and he denied it obviously and started blaming my sister and one of his own friends. And this friend of his (who also knows my sister) ended up replying to an email I ""supposedly sent"" and I wrote back what the hell happened and that ""our friend"" was blaming him and my sister for all of this. 

I now have another new email and I changed the password 3 times for my original one. My new email is only gonna be for people that I know and my original one will be used basicly for chat and screening people. Now, it is time for me to depart and go on with my day. PeAcE!!"

"event","Once again, writing another post. I was asleep inbetween 1am and 3am, however...I got woken up by drunkies. I'm tokin on a joint to hopefully knock me back the fuck out. I'm praying to God that it works fast. And I can feel it kicking in cause I have to keep hitting backspace to correct myself and I keep staring at the screen blankly and thinking about that certain someone, wondering where he is. Haven't talked to him in a couple days and am really starting to miss him. So, I'm just very blahhhhhh!!!! Anyway, it's almost 5:15am...lovely. And we have a demon snorer on the couch and holy shit, does he ever snore fucking loud....he's the loudest snorer I have incountered yet. Anyway, I'm getting off...Good Night/Morning/Whatever!"

"event","I am curious about something....how can someone who smokes an ounce in a week say to me that I smoke a lot...and I smoke a quarter a week, on average. Isn't that a complete oxy-moron. I just don't see how that makes any bit of sense. Oh well, it's not my problem.....it's just something that has got me thinking.

Now, on to a topic that has been digging at the back of my brain for some time, I am the one who CHOOSES to smoke my friends, out of the goodness of my heart. However, one can only afford to do so much and if I have to stop being so ""nice"" and smoking so many people to save money....so be it. I have my own habits to support and can't afford to support other people's habits. I'm am tired of being ""expected"" to smoke everyone whenever they are out of weed. It is NOT my responsibility to smoke anyone, I do it because I am nice and a good friend...however, I am tired of this shit. I am a pothead nonetheless, BUT I need to start thinking realisticly. I don't care what people think after this. 

BUT,what if I stopped toking all together (like that would ever happen, but still)...IF I DID stop smoking weed, over 90% of my so called ""friends"" would stop being my friends....just think about it, I've seen it happen. 

Anyway, like I have already stated....I am the one who CHOOSES to smoke my friends because I am nice...however, if I have to CHOOSE to stop smoking my friends to be able to actually get by money-wise, so be it. Call me a bitch, call me a loser for smoking alone, I do NOT fucking care....This is how it's gonna be, don't like it....too fucking bad. Here's a quarter, call someone who cares! I've had it, I'm fed up, I'm pissed off, I'm tired, I'm cranky, I'm worn down, I'm stressed out, I'm frustrated, I'm down right fucking emotional so shit eh shit shit! BLAH! I'm out!

Once I'm done my smoke after this joint, I'm gonna finish cleaning the kitchen and attack what's left to do in my bedroom. I swear, I get bored with how my bedroom looks at least once a month so I'm changing it constantly. Always experimenting with new creative ideas and organizing solutions. If only I had endless amounts of spending money to experiment with aswell....if only. But, I don't...so I make do with my cardboard boxes (perferably unmarked). *Holy shit, that was a good doob!!* Anyway, lol.....I love workin creatively on things and giving them my personal touch. If I had all the supplies possible, I could do almost anything I wanted to. Anyway, I'm outie for now. PeAcE!!"

"event","Well, here I am again, the beginning of another month and another season. Spring is finally here...new flames are being lit and old flames are being re-ignited. For the last six years, I have lived in complete denial of my feelings. I had ""told"" myself that I was over him, when deep inside even I knew that I still loved him. And now I have the chance to be happy once again with the one who has always loved me, for me. 

But, that doesn't mean it will be easy...if this is going to work, it's going to be done right and I will personally make sure that it is done right. I have grown to the point that I know what I want and I know who I am now (well, about 70%...lol). But, fact of the matter is, I have always loved that man whom I am proud to say will be my future fiancee. This time, I'm not young and stupid so I won't fuck up. But, he has had his fuck ups aswell. However, that is for me to know and not blab around. 

Anyway, that's enough for this post. I'm out!"

"event","Well, I did the dishes again before I went to bed and I woke up to what I usually see....the dish drainer still full with no dishes put away and more dishes in the sink. I am very compulsive when it come to the appearance of where I live. I like it to be clean, organized and tidy. But, no one seems to pick up on my routine so I just end up doing it myself. 

I haven't bitched about the cleaning factor for a long while, but I'm tired and wearing down. I'm stressed out beyond belief and have so much going through my head and knowing the fact that things won't get done for a good while unless I do it myself....I love my roomie and her b/f to pieces, but a little help would be nice. 

However, I realize more and more each day on what my mother went through with me, I feel like I'm picking up after myself times three. I may have not done much at the very beginning, but since I started doing the dishes almost every night to every other night if I'm too tired, I've noticed that it just doesn't get done unless I do it. So, let's make a lil list here on the chores that I have done since December.

1. Shoveling
2. Salting the stairs and ashphalt area
3. Ice breaking
4. Washing dishes
5. Drying dishes that are still wet
6. Putting away dishes
7. Sweeping the Kitchen, Main areas, and the bathroom
8. Mopping the Kitchen, Main areas, and the bathroom
9. Cleaning the kitchen counters, stove, and my microwave
10.Cleaning the bathroom sink, tub, and my half the the sink counter

That's just about it and I know my roomie will end up reading this so; ""Roomie"": I love you and I do not want to fight about this, all I ask is for a lil help more often even though I shouldn't really have to ask considering you ARE my FRIEND and live here aswell. 

Anyway, I'm gonna go put those dishes away and wait for my ex fiancee (soon to be fiancee again) online. And then go downtown for an appointment. Byeeeee!"

"event","Well, this weekend has been one hell of a weekend. First of all, I am single once again. And talking to my ex-fiancee again....realizing so much too. Like the fact that I never stopped loving him, even though I tried to convince myself that I didn't and that I got over him...but, I was only fooling myself. I have never loved anyone like I have loved him. He's the longest relationship that I've had (8.5 months) and every guy I have been with since him was compared to him and no one is like him. No one has ever made me feel the way he does. I met him when I was 16, and he was 23. I know the age diff, don't give a shit. If you have a prob with it, too fucking bad. Anyway, he was with me during the whole living on the streets episode of my life back in the summer of 2000. He took care of me and loved me like no other has. And he still loves me, and still wants to marry me. So, my head is goin loop-di-loop and my heart is doing back flips at the present moment. So, obviously I have ALOT on my mind. But, I am so fucking happie inside that I can't even describe it. So many different emotions flowing through me it's unimaginable. Right now I am just writing this to waste time until he comes back online, which should be soon...I hope. But, I've missed him sooo much and have thought about him constantly over the years. And now he's online so I will depart. Byeeee!"

A total of 9 people that my stoned brain can remember. LOL! I ran into an old friend that I haven't seen in months and I ended up bussing to Bayshore with him and meeting his g/f; then we went back downtown. Currently I am waiting for my ex to come back online cuz I found him on hi5.com and messaged him cause I have been trying to contact him for a lil while now. I added him to my msn early this morning and he came online at night after I had come home. I talked to him for a good hour or so, but he had to go....he said he was gonna be back online in an hour or so and it's been almost an hour and a half. I am getting very tired and getting quite impatient. I hate waiting for people...grrrr! If he doesn't come back online by 2:30am, I am going to bed. Anyway, I'm out....I'll post again some other time.

"event","Well, it's been about a week since my last post. I called Bell and got that stupid ass number blocked and they removed $80.25 from the $130.25 that was the original bill. 

I also talked to my employment specialist at welfare yesterday and she found an opportunity for me to work at The Anti-Poverty Project(T.A.P.P.) again. This time with a group of all females...12 positions avaliable. She's already sent off my resume. And those who know me best know that I do NOT get along with 90% of the female population so hopefully I don't make too many enemies.

I also got a message from one of my friends and she wanted to know if I wanted to know if I wanted to babysit on Thursday, of course I called her back...left a message saying that Thursday's good. And then on Friday I go back up to Navan for the weekend again. 

However, this afternoon is the only afternoon that I have completely free so I'm gonna make use of that and clean this appartment from head to toe. Go shake the mats outside and everything cause my roomie is heading off to her mom's to go see her dad so this place will be body free except for her cat. So, yay.....no legs to trip over, no walking fast by the TV cause someone's playing a game....lol! And my tunes all the way so YEA!!!!! 

Now I will bid adue and go make a lil somethin to eat....and then clean, clean, clean. See ya!

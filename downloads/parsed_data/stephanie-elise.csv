"event","Well I'm so sore right now but yesterday was my great Cassandra, Gentry, Jono and I all went surfing and out to eat. Cassandra and I were alittle late picking up the boys (just an hour) but we got there at 8am so we were good. A dolphin came like 2 feet away from me and Cassandra it was so cool! We stayed out there for maybe 4 to 5 hours. It was freezing! We got dressed (quickly lol) and went downtown to the Mellow Mushroom to eat so good food! After that we headed home and i went to help Elena get ready for prom then i went out to a movie with selimah and out to ice cream! it was a very busy day but so so so much fun."

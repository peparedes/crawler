"event","welp, 2004 sucked.  i've been a true nomad this year... just like i was last year... and as i will be again this year. i think it's an addiction... a movaholic? yeah. whatever.

to sum it up... in 2004 i discovered how lacking i am in true friendships.  the bonds i do have are stretching thin.... and all in all, i've realized i'm incredibly lonely. i'm nineteen.  i'm alone. and all i can say about it is fuck off. 

that said, i have begun to realize in this state of solitude how much i value music.  it really helps soothe the pains of life, in ways nothing/ no one else can. i know, i know... fuck off. 

well, that was fun.  nothing else to say. hope you all had a better year than i did.  





here's to fucking up 2005... *raises glass of water*"

<i>by, me.</i>

People come
Yet, people go
Memories live on
Still, memories die

Our age is never right
Our place is never perfect
Our time too long, too short
Our hearts never cease their longing

Too rare we feel peace
Too often we doubt
Too long we wait to feel whole
Too scared to really let go
Too bored to stay too long
Too tired to really care

Always searching
Never finding
Always planning 
Never doing
Always gambling
Never winning
Always wanting
Never getting

We run through the roses of love
Too tempted by their beauty to resist
We come out covered in thorns
That not only sting us
But sting the next who dare try loving us

The lesson in it all?
To laugh at the comedy of it all.</div>"

"event","It doesn't interest me what you do for a living.
I want to know what you ache for,
 and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart's longing.

It doesn't interest me how old you are.
I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool for love,
 for your dreams, for the adventure of being alive.

It doesn't interest me what planets are squaring your moon.
I want to know if you have touched the center of your sorrow.
If you have been opened by life's betrayals or
 have become shriveled and closed from fear of further pain.

I want to know if you can sit with pain, mine or your own, 
 without moving to hide it or fade it or fix it.
I want to know if you can be with joy, mine or your own;
If you can dance with wildness and let the ecstasy fill you
 to the tips of your fingers and toes without cautioning us to
 be careful, be realistic, or to remember the limitations of 
 being human.

It doesn't interest me if the story you are telling me is true.
I want to know if you can disappoint another to be true to yourself.
If you can bear the accusation of betrayal and not betray your own soul.

I want to know if you can be faithful and therefore trustworthy.
I want to know if you can see the beauty,
 even when it is not pretty every day,
 and if you can source your life from its presence.

I want to know if you can live with failure, yours or mine, 
 and still stand of the edge of a lake and shout to the silver
 of the full moon, ""Yes!""

It doesn't interest me to know where you live or how much
 money you have. I want to know if you can get up after
 the night of grief and despair, weary and bruised to the
 bone, and do what needs to be done for the children.

It doesn't interest me who you are, or how you came to be here.
I want to know if you will stand in the center of the fire with
 me and not shrink back.

It doesn't interest me where or what or with whom you have studied.
I want to know what sustains you from the inside when all 
 else falls away. 

I want to know if you can be alone with yourself, 
 and if you truly like the company you keep in the empty
 moments.

"event","I'm looking at a copy of my birth certificate.

my dad signed it... to certify it.  he was 24.  his signature looks the same as it does now, but a little more sloppy.  and in the box where it reads ""relationship to child"" he wrote in capitals ""FATHER"".  and dated it 9/20/85.... five days after the day i was born.

father.

in the space where the ""mother of child"" is named, my mother's name is typed:  <b>First:</b> Betty  <b>Middle:</b> Jo  <b>Last (birth name):</b> Ventrone

but this is not the name she was born with.  my mother was born in florida on november 10th, 1961 to a man named Charles, and to my Grandmother, Sue... their last name was Bailey. 




Charles died when my mother was seven.  Before his death, my grandma was beaten by Charles.  my mother's first memory is of Charles attempting to shoot my grandma but missing and blowing a hole in the wall. she was an infant. when he died, my mom was relieved.  and soon after the relief came the guilt from being relieved that your father is dead.  guilt like that doesnt go away.

my grandmother remarried to a man named Art Ventrone.  this is the Papa i knew.  she was young and widdowed with three young children... he was young and single with none.  when they married, he addopted her children, and my mom's last name became ventrone.  overnight he became a father of three.  he was hard on them, but was a good man.  he had good morals and passed them on, making my mom who she is today.  in my eyes, this man was a saint.  he gave up his dreams to father children that werent his.  Art died when i was 9. 




I know my parents love me.  But they were so young.  What was it like to have 2 kids by the time you're 24 and 23?  Were they happy?  Were they confused?  They obviously didnt know what they were doing -- they divorced 4 years later.  

I cant help but think that the feeling my dad had when i was born will be the feeling that Mark feels when his daughter is born.  And i hope the feeling is pure love.  




I dont see my dad often, and i miss him alot.  But it's wierd... i cant imagine my life any different.  I was raised mainly by my mom, seeing my dad every other weekend for about 7 years strait.  My mom and I have fought my entire life (dont worry, it's made our relationship a closer one in the long run) and when I was in 7th grade, my mom threatened to send me to my dad's and make me live with him.  He lived 4 hours away, and she'd been threatening this for too long.  I didnt want to move, my friends were here, not there.  But being the stubborn girl that i was, i called her bluff.  I said fine, I packed my bags, called my dad, and I left.  She cried for weeks.  

I lived with my dad for a year and a half.  I felt so happy and so ""in the right place.""  My dad brainwashed me with christianity, and I imagine I used it like a drug, and that's the reason I felt so at home.  It's hard to explain.  But then he my dad moved me out of the school that I loved, to northern california, and i hated it. So i rebelled.  And my dad kicked me out.  Back to my mom's I went. 

I didnt talk to my dad for a year.  Not once.  No calls, no visits.  Nothing. 

My dad and I are fine now... I love him, and i know he loves me.  But i really miss the days when I was his little girl.  He lived in Simi Vally through most my young child hood.  My sister and I loved his house.  He was so creative.  He had built us a 2 story ""spaceship"" in the corner of the garage, equiped with a black and white tv that recieved one channel, a ladder, a coat rack, carpet, and in the top story we had a black light, along with a bunch of glow in the dark stars and old control switches and buttons that made us feel as if we were really gona take off.  

We also had a tree fort and two tree swings made of sanded wood and some old ropes.  mind you, the tree with the fort in it was a tall one.  i'm not sure how he built it... we even had a pulley basket thing that allowed us to bring stuff up without carrying it while we were climbing, but it was these things that, through most my childhood, made my dad the ""best man alive"".  He was my idol.  




I love my parents.  I love them for who they are, completely.  I love the fact that I wasn't raised by them both under the same roof.  I love my mother, and even though we've been through some really rough times, she's one of my favorite people.  I love my dad, even if he's a christian ;).  He has a big heart, and I'm proud to know such a kind soul. 







Now, i'm sure no one read all that, but that's okay. <b>I didnt write it for you.</b>  I wrote it for me."

"event","its so hard to tell what's real and what's fake
who can i trust?
and why do i care?
people come
people go
but true friends are forever
and if that's the only test
to tell who's on your side
then i'm fucked.
doubt and assumptions are the evilest of evils.
they waste my time 
and fuck with my head
im sick of trusting people 
who dont give a fuck
about how i feel
and who wont trust me
there are two things i know
about myself that are consistant
i'm honest. 
i'm loyal.
and they go hand in hand.
these days i feel like i'm the only one being honest.
and the only one willing to die for a friend.
prove me wrong.

<br><br>

i feel like i'm in this narrow, deep, black hole...
i'm all alone inside
wondering how i got here
and how i'll ever get out.
my muscles too tired to climb
my head to tired to think.
ive been here for far too long.
at one point i had friends
at the top of the hole
yelling down to me to come out
telling me that life looked better up there.
but it seems no one's there anymore.
maybe they fell into their own dark holes
and cant find a way out.
or maybe they just stopped caring.
how do i find the strength to get myself out?
i'm a prisioner of my reality
its caving in on me
and theres no one here to save me.
how do i save myself?"

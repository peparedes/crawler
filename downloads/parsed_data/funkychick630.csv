"event","<text size = ""7""><center> You know...as I headed on this journey, I thought ""hey, this is going to be fun, this is going to just be easy, this is just going to be an extension of my life back in my hometown."" Boy, was I wrong. Not only did I get lost a lot, but it helped me see the beauty of growing up and getting on with my life.
Not only that, but realizing that life as I know it now will NEVER be the same and everything that I thought I knew is now going to change and everything that I hope to know is now going to be attainable at a cost. Everything is at a cost....the real question is now, is it worth it.
Are my dreams worth the cost I am going to have to pay to get them? Well....in a simple word ""yes"" they are...and yes, I will reach them.
I will have trouble no doubt, but the outcome....will entail sweet victory."

After superwow, He showed Himself again and again, and is still doing that today.&nbsp; I have grown so much as a christian and I can honestly say that Jesus is the best thing on the face of the world, although I have not traveled the world, yet! but thats another story.&nbsp; Just to see Him working here is one great thing.&nbsp; The evidence of His love is prevelant here. <br /><br />meanwhile, my interests have been peaked by photography.

"event","<div align=""center""><font size=""3"">Well, I just feel like writing tonight, I dont know what about, but I just feel like getting some stuff out.<br /><br /><font size=""4"">First of all school starts in like 2 days. Yes, even though I try to deny it, its still here and no matter how much I want it not to be, it is and I have to accept it.&nbsp; I hate to admit it, but I am kind-of excited, its just a good feeling knowing that I am going to be an upperclassmen for the first time in my life.&nbsp; Last year was great because it was all like oooh domination over the freshmen and now its like oooh domination over the sophmores and the freshmen. Nothing like being power-hungry, eh?<br /><br /><font size=""2"">Second, There is the whole sister thing.&nbsp; I mean dont get me wrong, I love her and I would do anything for her and I tell her a lot of things, we are like best friends and I know her and I have had to be around her all my life, but sometimes, oh man.&nbsp; I just dont get it, I feel like she thinks that I am going to abandon her and i'm like no, are you crazy? I just want to smack her for thinking such thoughts and I...ahhhh.&nbsp; But then again, I wouldnt be able to live without her because she knows me and she still loves me and I know that I can always go to her and she will listen to me(well sometimes) and then usually give me some sort of wisdom back on my situation.&nbsp; Oh, and I HATE it when people think they know my sister better than me, for example, we had a fight a while ago and I knew it was best to just let her cool off, but no someone thought that it would be best for me to go and talk to her and I was like no, thats no a good idea, but they insisted and I did and it made it worse.Yeah, I win on that one.<br /><br /><font size=""5"">Third, I am the happiest girl in the world. Why, you ask?&nbsp; The reason is none other than Joshua. I love him.&nbsp; I know most people are all like, you dont love him, you have only been dating for like 10 days, and I am usually one of those people, but in this situation, I feel as if I really do truely love him, its just one of those things that you cant explain.&nbsp; I dont know how it happened, but I know that it did happen for a reason and I am so happy that it did.&nbsp; Its different being with him, there no over-obsessiveness going on(well maybe on my part, but hey come on now), Every time I see him, I still get nervous that i'm going to say something stupid or that he wont like me, but then i'm like ""well, hes liked me so far, so why not just be yourself"" and then, usually its all good. That is when I do get to see him. Oh gosh, I am rambelling on and on and I cannot spell worth anything.<br /><br /><font size=""4"">Fourth, I love Maria.&nbsp; I have never been this close to anyone thats not related to me, but we are one person, so ya know.&nbsp; I would have never made it through high school without her right there.&nbsp; She stuck with me through all the STUPID crap that I have dragged her through, and good lord, she is tough.&nbsp; Oh the good times weve had, Oh yes, Mr Millsaps I still remember him and the rendouvxes weve had, yes yes, good times. Oh, and Kashi trail mix bars, yes and staying up till ten and sleeping on my computer and taking crazy pictures and sleeping outside and doing fun crazy stuff and I love her!<br /><br /><font size=""2"">Well, I would be suprised if anyone was still reading this because its like the longest entry that I prob have ever like typed, but ya know, sometimes you just need to get your feelings out and thats ok.<br /><br /><font size=""1"">Ok, Fifth, Why do people have to be stupid?&nbsp; I know that i'm not the brightest one at times, but really come on.&nbsp; Some people just give off that stupid vibe and your like good lord, whats the deal man.&nbsp; It rather drives me insane, ya know?<br /><br /><font size=""3"">Well, Jons party was fun.&nbsp; Maybe I need to work on my soccer skills a tad, but I wasnt really trying for the record, and oh yes,&nbsp; Ri discovered that sitting on my car was like perfect for stargazing, so i'm going to keep that one in mind.&nbsp; <br /><br /><font size=""6"">If you want something so badly then why dont you just go for it???? I'd like to ask that question to some people, gah, it makes me mad, but whatever.<br /><br /><font size=""4"">Well, I have work tomorrow and its already like midnight, whooo. I;m going to get some sleep, well at least try to.&nbsp; Ok, well peace out.<br /><br />\\goodnight.<br /></font></font></font></font></font></font></font><br /><br /></font><br /></font></font></div>"

We celebrated mom and dads anniversary last night, we made shrimp pasta salad, it was awesome. 21 years, I believe.<br>
I have started reading Pride & Prejudice by Jane Austen.  Yeah, I got to chapter two!!! yay! I am trying to read as many books as I can, well ya know.<Br>
I have a website now.  Its rather spiffy, but not everything on the site works.  I will be posting the link on here in a few days, so....<br><br>

My deep thought of the day: <br>
   People are idiots & thats all there is to it.<Br><br>
Ok, well after some deep inspiration, I cant go to sleep at night, its like I have that sleep thing where its impossible to sleep, but maybe thats because I was used to staying up late in Washington and there is like 3 hours away, so<br>

I think I should document <strong>my life</strong> as it happens.<br /><br /><font size="""">T</font>oday, I went to the gym and worked out and then Steph and I were going to go <strong>swimming</strong>, but when we got to the lake, there were these gansta wannabes/trailer trash(excuse my bluntness) walking around everywhere with their 8th grade girlfriends, so I decided just to go back home.  I know, but I really didnt feel like having to deal with all the <strong>jazz</strong>.  Ciro was trying to convince me to come and see him, but I held back and decided that me seeing him tomorrow would make up for me not seeing him tonight.<br /><br /><font size=""4"">T</font>omorrow, I am planning on going back to the gym &amp; then go swimming down at the rope swing with a bunch of people, yay, that should be so much <strong>fun</strong>!!

"event","<center> I sometimes wish that I didnt live here.  I hate all the little drama that goes on in a small town.  It seems as if everyone is stealing someone else's boyfriend or friendships are in ruin because of nothing at all just someone goes and gets ""hurt"".<br>
What is true love?? I thought I knew, I believe that I was in love, but you look at life differently when you are in love.  Thats life I am not seeing what I saw back then, I am wondering why the heck that I used to think that and then I remember, oh yes, I was ""in love"". Freakin Love. I mean come on, if I say that I dont want a boyfriend, then hey, I dont want a boyfriend, well its not that I dont want one, its just that I feel at this time I am supposed to be single. ok, well with that off my chest.<br>
Washington was fun. Samantha had her baby as I have told in the previous entry. I kind-of miss it up there, well more like Sam & Will & little Alyvia. I miss being around them, but ya know thats just what makes you stronger.<br>
The flight on the way here was fun. There was a cute guy sitting two rows back from Stephanie & I. He was playing his, well what i assume, psp all night. There was a movie, Firewall. Hum...well oh yeah, we got off the plane around 6am. We went to eat at Cracker Barell(spelling). MMMMmmmmMM....that was awesome.  Thats one of my favorite things to do, wake up really early and go eat there, but of course it would have to be a special occasion because the nearest one is like an hour away. <br>
Well, I am here pouring my heart out and such, ok then well...I am going to go because I want to go to the gym, so....Take Care<br>
=]  Oh yeah, I love Coffee now!!!"

Gosh, I fly tomorrow, well actually today if I want to get techinal.  I am somewhat nervous, but overall I am just blah about it.  I want to see Samantha and mom and Steph.  <br>
I kind-of hate my situation that I am in right now, I jsut want it to be over.  I really miss someone, just talking to them, knowing that they are there for you and knowing that they are thinking about you, but he is currently mad at me and doesnt even know if he wants to be my friend again, that is just tearing me up inside.  
I wish that he wouldnt be mad at me anymore, but I also wish that he didnt move as well, but what can ya do, right?<br>
But, on the upside I just got back from WOW Weekend.  It was positivly awesome!  I am finally on the right path, well not that I wasnt on the right path before, just now I am back on that right path. =]<br>

"event","<center>Life is going swell right now, nothing to complain about. School was am early release day, so yep. The eighth grade dance was last night. Oh my. I did Nikkis make-up, yeah she was so pretty. But, then we went to mexican after the dance and it was loaded with all these middle schoolers, some of them were even crying. It was quite a site.<br>
There is a song stuck in my head.....<br>
I am unwritten, can't read my mind, I'm undefined 
I'm just beginning, the pen's in my hand, ending unplanned 

Staring at the blank page before you 
Open up the dirty window 
Let the sun illuminate the words that you can not find 
Reaching for something in the distance 
So close you can almost taste it 
Release your inhibitions 

Feel the rain on your skin 
No one else can feel it for you 
Only you can let it in 
No one else, no one else 
Can speak the words on your lips 
Drench yourself in words unspoken 
Live your life with arms wide open 
Today is where your book begins 
The rest is still unwritten 

I break tradition, sometimes my tries, are outside the lines 
We've been conditioned to not make mistakes, but I can't live that way

Ciro and I have been dating 11 months and 6 days. :)<br>
Soccer is going great, we had a game Monday against North Hall(I think), and we beat them 4-2. We had another game Thursday against Chestatee and we lost, but only because we got a hand-ball in the last minute of the game so they got a pk. The next game is on the 9th. <br>
School is going swimmingly so far. Nothing big to complain about. <Br>
Stephanie, Ciro and I are going to a party tonight. Birthday party. lol.<br>
Ya know, I dont think anyone ever reads this so yeah, im just typing to myself yada yada yada yada yada.<br>
There was a baseball game yesterday.  The game was a shut-out, but we won. yay.<br>
I get to drive in 2 months!!!!!!!!!hooray."

"event","<center>Life, right now seems as to be semi-perfect. Ciro and I arent fighting at all & Ri and my friendship is back to good again.<br>
Um...Last week Ciro, Santos, Steph, mom, dad, and I all went up to the mountains and went sledding down the road. It was a blast, then after that we ate at the Waffle King and we all ordered alot of food and it was really good. <br>
School is going good again after that 5 day sickness. Gah, that sucked all I could do was just stay inside the house.<br>
I love Ciro, gosh, its amazing. In one week, Ciro and I will have been dating for 11 months!!! It only seems like yesterday. But, I guess often times thats what happens when you are in love. <br>
Today, we are going to do something fun with the fam and friends. It will be a blast, then tonight we are all going to the Valentines banquet.<br>
Peace"

"event","<center>There are some things going on in my life now, that I assume everyone has been through and that this is just a part of growing up. Well, I cant really go into it right now, but yeah. <br>
Church was good today.  The 5th sunday night singing is tonight and I have to miss it because of refuge tomorrow.<br>
Well, Ciro and I are doing awesome, I love that boy so much, but its hard not getting to see hime everyday and having to go to 2 diffrent schools, but usually he comes to school after work and sees me. I hate that he has to work on his days off, but I supose that that is the price to pay for money.<br>
Gah, I feel like a sasuage, egg, cheese, buiscut like the one that Ciro brought me for breakfast this morning. It was yummy in my tummy. ;) lol.<br>
Well, im hungry so peace out.<br>"

I went to the basketball game on Friday and everyone one their games, but V-team boys. It was sad.<br>

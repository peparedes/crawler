"event","Today was one interesting day nonetheless. On my way to school i some guy was drifting over into my lane and my windshield was all fogged up so i had very limited visablity so i swerved over and hit the curve, which resulted in a flat tire. i need to explain some goings on before i get into the meat of the story. in the last year my house has been put up for sale by my friends 3 times, also  my car has been egged so whenever anything happens my parents choose to blame my friends. So as i show the tire to my dad the first thing he says is ""looks like someone slashed your tires"". which i know wasn't true. So later on in the day i went to sears at rivertown to check out some tires, i walked around the mall and then i almost died of a heart attack, i walked by abercrombie and they were playing in my waking life by saves the day and right then i just wanted to vomit.i got the our song online though, http://www.purevolume.com/BrokenSilence"

"event","i'm soooo tired, it's unbelievable. it's been 2 days since i really got to sleep, last night i was disturbed at 5 in the morning by the parentals. Anyways, the last two days have been eventful,eventful enough for me to remember i had this journal. Yesterday i hung out at the mall with Mitch, Justin and Pat. This trip actually turned into a funny expierence. earlier in the week, charles gave me a piece of paper that said ""this coupon is good for one free hug"" this was to good for it to go to waste, so i went into gadzooks and walked up to some girl working there and asked her if she honored those coupons, eventually she did which made me laugh. lol i'm hi larious. Later on we went into fye and i asked one of the people there if they had any vanilla ice cds, suprisingly they did which made me laugh. For some reason, everyone in that store always follows us like were kleptomaniacs or something. This disgusted me, and when we left the store i thanked them for following us. The real entertainment came later on as we entered abercrombie where it seemed like we weren't wanted. Mitch and Justin went into to the fitting rooms to play prep dress up or something and while me and pat were sitting there in the store, they kept asking us what we were doing there which made us feel not wanted. After that i started breakdancing in the store which made me happy. Then we went to best buy which was also fun. They had these karoke machines there and so i turned one on and preceded to song the msot off key song ever which caught the attention off have the people in the store."

"event","YES!!!!!! we did it, we recorded a song. Today we had a recording session at mitchs house. We decided to record afterburner which is one of our best songs. Mitch recorded the guitar first, it took him about 3 takes to get it good. Chris was next, it took him about 4 tries to get it right. Then it was my turn, i sucked so bad tonight. I was extremely nervous when i was recording it, it took me about 7 tries to do it, but it would have been about 4 if mitch had done it right lol anyways it's all good now. Mitch put down the vocals then we were finished. after that we decided to do a rough mix of the song so we could put it on cd and hear, i think it sounds amazing but i'm super biased. If anyone wants the song just leave a comment and i'll send it to them."

"event","meh i just thought of this idea, instead of using this as an actual journal type thing, i'm gonna post random things that amuse me the sogn of the day and an occasional journal. yay the first song of the day is: Brand New- Seventy Times Seven

back in school they never taught us what we needed to know,
like how to deal with despair, or someone breaking your heart.
For twelve years I've held it all together but a night like this is begging to pull me apart.
I played it quite left you deep in conversation.
I felt uncool and hung out around the kitchen.
I remember I kept thinking that I know you never would,
but now I know I want to kill you like only a best friend could.

Everyone's caught on to everything you do.
everyones caught on to.

As if this happening wasn't enough I got to go
and write a song just to remind myself how bad it sucked.
Ignore the sun, the cover's over my head.
I wrote a message on my pillow that says, ""Jesse, stay asleep in bed.""
So don't apologize. I hope you choke and die.
Search your cell for something with which to hang yourself.
They say you need to pray if you want to go to heaven
but they don't tell you what to say when your whole life has gone to hell.

Everyone's caught on to everything you do.
Everyone's caught on to
Everyone's caught on to everything you do.
Everyone's caught on to
And I can't let you, let me down again.

So, is that what you call a getaway?
Tell me what you got away with.
Cause I've seen more spine on jellyfish.
I've seen more guts in eleven-year-old kids.
Have another drink and drive yourself home.
I hope there's ice on all the roads.
And you can think of me when you forget your seatbelt,
and again when your head goes through the windshield.

And is that what you call tact?
You're as subtle as a brick in the small of my back.
So let's end this call, and end this conversation.
and is that what you call a getaway?
well tell me what you got away with.
cause you left the frays from the ties you severed 
when you say best friends mean friends forever

"event","Everything sucks, but i'm gonna ignore everything for now. Anyways, i had an interesting weekend. Friday night we had band practice, we ran through most of the songs, i think were getting to the point were i feel like i'm actually part of the band rather than just being there. I just stayed at chris' that night. We played some tony hawk underground which both fun and hilarious . Saturday was alright, i got home from chris's house around 4, took care of something for the parentals and then watched some college basketball ( stanford is incredible). I did nothing today, I hung out with la familia, listened to 2gether lol (the hardest part of breaking up is getting your stuff back), Slept for a few hours. Now i'm just sitting here thinking about everything thats going on. My friends are wasting they're time trying to find someone to go  to swirl with me, even if they do happen to find someone i'm not going, i'm not gonna waste my time on that shit. Everything is starting to bother me right now, i really just want to start over with everything even though i can't."

For some strange reason, i haven't been abled to sleep for the past week, which has left me disoriented. Was i got home i passed out in my bed for a few hours, i was supposed to go to guitar center with Charles and Dan today at around six, but that never happened because of my 5 hour nap. Tommorow looks intriguing, Band practice after school shall provide me some entertainment and amusement other than that i'll probably do they usual, talk online about how great Jesse Lacey, Geoff Rickley, and Chris Conley are, listen to Saves the day, watch the simpsons and pardon the interrruption,  Play bass, talk shit about good charlotte and yellowcard and still not get any sleep all day."

Nothing interesting really happened, basically i jsut hungout with charles and jason all night.We started the night out at nicks house which was alright for awhile then we all got bored and when to mejiers. The ride their was fun, it ended with me almost killing up all turning into the parking lot. i'm such a good driver lol. Walked around meijers, me and jason tried to lose charles, megan and katie, and we would have been successful if we weren't such nice guys. We then drove around for awhile until we dropped charles, megan, and katie off at charles house. Jason and I went back to nicks to for a half an hour and then decided to go home. All in all it was an interesting day, it was MUCH better than just sitting at home."

"event","Today was a day of reflection for me, and i really don't know how i got into but somehow i did. I thought about how i've been living out my life the past few months and i came to the conclusion that i have some really good friends. Whenever i've been down they've always tried to help bring me back up again. I'm very thankful to have friends like Charles, Mitch, Tina,  Jason and a countless cast of others. This seems strange to me because in the last few months i've ignored them, stopped listening to their advice, and at some points stop talking to some of them, but they still are friends of mine. I would like to apologize to everyone, i'm sorry about everything. I'm sorry for my days upon days of isolation from the outside world, i'm sorry for treating you all like shit, and most importantly i'm sorry for ever thinking about doing something harmful to myself. I want to thank everyone for putting up with my shit for the last few months. I also thought about my whole depressed period aswell. I think i will benefit from the suffering i dealt with lately, it has shown me that not everything is all fun and that sometimes it's better to be sincere than hilarious, i hope to achieve a perfect balance of sincerity and hilarity. For the first time in forever i'm happy again lets hope i stay this way"

I don't even know anymore i don't feel like myself anymore. Anyways, Yesterday we had a snowday, i slept in and practiced some bass. I finally broke the silence with my friends today by talking to them for the first time in two days. I'm getting into some really weird music now. The Postal Service- a keyboard driven group with emoesque lyrics and singing by Ben gibbard, Death Cab For Cutie- Ben Gibbards regular band, Bright Eyes, Cursive. yeah, you know what would be great? 450 dollars so i can buy a bass amp i found a good one today when i went up to rit with chris and mitch."

"event","Today i went to Mitch's girlfriends house out in rockford to meet a friend of hers. It just wasn't a good night for me at all. Throughout the whole night it seemed like she was ignoring me, almost like she i thought i wasn't even there. I tryed making conversation with her a few times which lead to nothing, which made me just not care anymore. So it basically just became me hanging out with Mitch and his girlfriend. I'm frustrated beyond words, what is it about me that makes people ignore me? It's not like i'm a jerk or i'm a boring person. It makes me feel inferior to people when this happens. I don't know what to do anymore, i'm a nice guy with a good sense of humor why does this happen to me? Anyways enough with my problems and self pity. I learned some new songs today and i played bass for a good hour and half. Music is slowly but surely becoming the sole reason for my existence. People just disappoint me, i always seem to get screwed, at least with music i know it will always be there. The Get Up Kids= ownage everyone should own something to write home about. blah blah blah tomorrow i think i'm going to my grandmas and then i'm gonna sit here and play some bass."

Friday was the only interesting day for me. Mitch, Chris, and I recorded a song which was pretty exciting. Then we screwed around playing other songs and some covers. Today, I did nothing at all, I practiced by myself on the bass. Listened to the Early November and Brand New all day. Watched some college basketball, damn you Arizona. Tomorrow doesn't look much better than today, it looks like i'm gonna be doing the same thing except change college basketball to the NFL. Sigh, I need some kind of excitement in my life or friends or maybe even something to do."

He said he got the idea of changing his name in full from banter at work. A female colleague referred to him as Bubba, Bubba, Bubba and another colleague believed that was his real name.
""That's kind of what started me thinking: Well, let's just have it all the way through - Bubba Bubba Bubba - first, middle and last,"" said Mr Bubba.
The 39-year-old's new identity is already on his driving licence, says the Peoria Journal Star <http://www.pjstar.com/>. He said he's long been known as ""Bubba"" or ""Bubby"" Gray.
He said: ""My dad called me Buddy, and it got switched to Bubby. Some of the kids couldn't pronounce Buddy too well, so they said Bubby, and it just stuck.""

Feeling bored i decided to make my traditional trip to target, i've decided that Target owns the mall. Tommorow doesn't look to bad, all i got to do is present to of my projects and listen to people talk about how much exams are gonna suck. YAY band practice tommorow night.

Since my friends were out with there girlfriends, I decided to work on my english project by listening to some cds and reading the lyrics. My conclusion, Saves The Day owns. After that I got out my review sheets for fourth hour, I lost all the packets from earlier in the year and so i'm screwed now. Unfortunately, the sadness continues, it's been going on for a month now. i found out the reason why though which helps a little bit. i believe it is all because of my negative thinking, whenever something bad happens to me I immediatley fall into the illusion that everything sucks and everyones against me. it looks like another boring weekend for me again, my friends are going to be busy snaking with their girlfriends, so it looks like a another weekend alone for me which suxors."

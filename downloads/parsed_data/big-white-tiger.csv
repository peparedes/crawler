"event","Hi all hope life is being good to all of you. Yesterday was a real bad day for sue and I. Her dad pasted away. We got the call at 6 am and left for ct by 6:30 got there around 9:30. Spent day with family and friend remembering the good man that he was. Left for home about 5ish got as far as ny when Nissan broke down on side of route 84 right in front of 2 help trucks. One of the drivers now owns the Nissan. (Picking up the truck later today after it has been repaired for the last month.) We got picked up by 2 of Sues friends who drove down from tux fair and picked us up from a gas stop on the off ramp of 84. They took us home to pa and then drove all the way back to tux. I can not express in words how thankful I am to them for doing this for us. They made the day a little better for us. Sue will be heading back up to ct tomorrow to help make the plans for her dad. please say a blessing for him to help him pass on to a better place."

"event","Well i have the Nissan on the road. Its break in run was up to CT to pick up Sue. The car ran great and has power to spare. It did make me realize I have changed in the past i would have needed to do 100 or better to ""prove"" something but I was happy just cruising with the tops off at 70 on the highway with the flow of traffic. The car still needs some body work to remove rust in the wheel well but it will not be redone to have more power (i don't need it). I think this is because  i'm in a happy place in my life with Sue. Sue has made me realize that I can be happy with who I am. In other news we now have a new chest freezer and the beast is in the shop to get fixed (new exhaust , get the rear parking lights working ,front end work , and 2 tires that i know of ).Sue and I will be at the Jeff Mach fair in CT for the next 3 weekends working so the house is on hold (but it is almost done).Hope you are all well and happy. May life bring you all the good thing it has to offer till later Roy"

"event","Hope you are well and ready to enjoy the upcoming holiday. Today I will be getting the Nissan 300 z back and putting her on the road. The pick-up is now going in to be repaired new exhaust and ball joints front tires and the rear parking lights are the things i know she needs just to pass inspection ( it expired in jan of 09). I will hope to get her back by Sands point fair as i will need to tow a trailer to that fair. As for my life sue and I are doing well. The divorce will be finished by the end of July. Work is going well route is growing as is my pay. Larry will be back next week. The new bosses are a good bunch,and the company keeps getting bigger. I like the job more then ever now because the drivers are asked about changes before they are made and we have input on how they should be made. And they listen to us for real. I am off from fairs until Sands point because all of the fairs have shut down due to the economy, there are 2 that we are looking into one is bucks county ( if anyone has info please let me know who to contact)and one in CT. This weekend will be fun. Anthony from across the street and I will be setting off fireworks, and Sue and I will be working on the house to get ready to finish painting the last 2 rooms. The next thing we want to do is hardwood floors in the whole house house but that will have to wait until budget allows ( we hope by the end of this year ). Cats are doing well."

The gun i had on layaway was sold because i didn't get the down payment there in time. the Nissan is up for sale, the shop where she is at is willing to help me sell her. I have come down with a cold and am trying to get rid of it with otc med so i will be better by Christmas. I have drank 2 gals of oj. I cant get the heat in the trailer to light will have to get someone, the ppl i called to do it want 150 dollars per hr to fix it plus parts. Will have to find someone else.It has fuel and i checked the blower motor it works, sends air though all vents in house, it has spark to light , just wont fire I think the injector is clogged but that is something I don't know how to check, if it was a car I could have had it rebuilt by now. The truck needs a radiator and I will be under it in a bit fixing the exhaust pipe it cracked so i will sleeve it over the crack. Work is going well the route is now shortened i get back on Thursday at 1:00 and on way home by 3:00. Hope all of you are well and have a good holiday season. thank you  Roy ."

You are wild, crazy, and a huge rebel. You're always up to something.
You have a ton of energy, and most people can't handle you. You're very intense.
You definitely are a handful, and you're likely to get in trouble. But your kind of trouble is a lot of fun.

You are well rounded, with a complete perspective on life.
You are solid and dependable. You are loyal, and people can count on you.
At times, you can be a bit too serious. You tend to put too much pressure on yourself.

You are a free spirit, and you resent anyone who tries to fence you in.
You are unpredictable, adventurous, and always a little surprising.
You may miss out by not settling down, but you're too busy having fun to care.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatsyournameshiddenmeaningquiz/"">What's Your Name's Hidden Meaning?</a></div>"

Monday we bring the cats to our new home in pa. shut everything off here. laura and her mom will take them in her moms car.I will follow in the new (92) pickup that we got on Monday. we both have all our pa paper work now. Tuesday we come back and finish the job whatever does not  fit will have to stay. when the bed cover is left in pa we can fit a lot more in it.  please I  only ask that our friends will all send good vibes our way . the stress of not having a job is starting to get to me. I have some hopeful prospects and hope one pans out. All of our other cars are gone the last one went today. my bike also went (the price I got to fix it was $1300.00).this is my last post in nj the next will be from pa.

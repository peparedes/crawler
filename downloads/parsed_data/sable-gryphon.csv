Ok, here's the deal with my legs.  The doctors don't know what's wrong.  All I know is I have a circulatory problem.  While the doctors don't know what's wrong, the current theory is Compartment Syndrom (check old posts for what that is).  It only kicks in after I've run a mile or so, and the next couple weeks I'm going to physical therapy to dry a 'deep heat' treatment, where they use sonics to warm up the muscles themselves, hoping that expands them and let's the blood travel more freely instead of rupturing and bruising.  Whatever it is, it's extensive, and the doctor isn't sure this is gonna do anything, but we're gonna try it anyway.  Now, I hear all of you worrying about me out there, and I want to reassure you, this isn't even going to effect me outside of running.  I'm OK.  I'm NOT gonna die.  My legs PROBABLY AREN'T going to EXPLODE in FLAMES hot enough TO consume THE STATE of NEW Jersey.

On the other paw, I may have met someone.  I've developed a crush on a fur known as Ceithen.  He's a strapping young minotaur, and currently we're feeling each other out, finding out each other quirks and idiosyncracies.  We've already called off any yiffing of anyone else, online or offline, for the next little while, just to see how we react.  Having never really had a crush before, I'm feeling this one out, slowly, unsure of what to do, but seeming to take steps in the right direction.  I'm getting that funny feeling in my stomach about this, which seems silly.  Is the gryphon actually falling in love?  If so, what awaits him in the future.  Stay tuned for more exciting episodes of 'This Boring Gryphon'

"event","The results came back from my MRI today.  It doesn't show anything wrong, or at least the person who looked at it didn't see anything wrong.  I get to schedual my second Physical Therapy appointment now and find out what they think.  It looks like I'm going to be getting permanent profile out of this, or at least a long term profile.  I guess I won't be running soon.  

In other news, I've joined a Furry Guild on WoW.  Horde server 'Blood Hoof' with the character 'Klexie' a Tauren Druid, currently level 26.

It's an amazing feeling to be part of a furry group.  For the first time in a long time, I feel wanted, at peace with the world around me, at least when I'm actively interacting with them.  I don't know how to describe the feeling other than I feel hope.  Pure, untainted hope.  It's a feeling I don't have often.

I'm also in a Roleplaying game online.  Star Fox game comprised of furries, which is double plus good.  I'm playing a scientist squirrel who specializes in FTL Theory.  I've played one game thus far, and already the group loves me (because I'm really good at getting them out of bad situations, like usual) :)  Anyone who's ever gamed with me will know what I mean. :)"

<TR>
<TD>Cool, calm and powerful. Whilst your actual super abilities may not be anything too dazzling, you have earnt the respect of both friends and enemies in response to your amazing fighting skills, strategic combat and experience. Luckily you have access to the greens which can fund all your majorly cool gadgets, vehicles and weapons! Also, you're reluctant but still accepting to the idea of having a teammate/side-kick, which just makes everything a whole lotta fun, doesn't it now! On the down side, you've probably suffered some sort of trauma at a young age (that's why we don't talk to the old man near the swings, kids). Similar to the Wolverine, your past is a base for your current motivation, undertaking some kind of personal vow in search of justice. All in all though, you're one tough nut. There's not a lot of people who have the minerals to go up against you, and you're experienced enough not to get cocky and let the little things like never finding happiness get you down! </TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD>You're hot! You've read a lot. You've done a lot, and there's a lot you'd like to try in the future. You've got a sharp, sexy mind, and few inhibitions to restrain you from exploring all the pleasure you can get. You have few hang-ups, and there's not much you don't know about sex. You're open-minded and able to enjoy things that would make a lesser person squeamish. You're an exceptional treat as a lover, appreciated greatly by those who know the differnce. You were probably bored with a few of the people you've been with in your past, feeling like you had to drag them along with you in the sexual adventures you want to have, and probably dumping them for the same reason. It takes a lot to stimulate you; you realize it's not just about bumping uglies. In the end there's gotta be a lot more to it. Still, there is always room for improvement. Before you can graduate into a true sexual genius, there are a few things you've got to learn, to explore, to think through, talk through, and fuck through. A good place to start is in taking a look at the few things you're still a little hesitant to try. Break down you're last few barriers and discover the outer sexual frontiers, and you'll become a master. </TD></TR>

A score above 100% means you use that kind of thinking more than average, and a score below 100% means you use it less. It says nothing about how good you are at any one, just how <I>interested</I> you are in each, relatively. A substantial difference in scores between two people means, conclusively, that they are <FONT color=#006600>different kinds</FONT> of thinkers. <BR><BR><B>Matching Summary:</B> Each of us has different tastes.

"event","Today was not a good day.  I guess I'll start out with this, I hate running.  But, I have always gotten better at running.  However, over the past few months, I haven't been getting better, I've been getting worse.  It hurts more and more when I run, but I was too stubborn to really pay much attention, forcing my way through it.  It wasn't a sharp, stabbing pain.  When I run, it's always my legs that give out first, forcing me to slow down to barely a jog.  Yesterday was the first day we ran in shorts, however.  The back of my legs were developing dark blueish black blotchy spots.  The entire section decided I was going to sick call.

So I went to sick call.  In the past, my experience with sick call is they blow you off.  Whatever you have is not as bad as you are making it out to be.  Pneumonia becomes 'Upper RespiratoryInfection' take motrin and a three day no PT profile.  This time, when I described what happened, the Specialist (rank, not doctors title) listened to what I had to say, then left the room for a good half an hour.  He came back in with a 14 week rehabilitation profile, and numbers to set up appointments with both Physical Therapy and to get an MRI to check out my leg.  He tried to down play it, but I know that medical personnel are supposed to downplay it.  Any sign of fear or doubt in a medical person's attitude can massively impact a patients status.

They called it Exercise Induced Compartment Syndrome Lower Extremity.  A quick search on the internet brought up this link http://arthritis-symptom.com/d-g/exercise-induced-compartment-syndrome.htm with this information;

""Exercise-Induced Compartment Syndrome 

Exercise-Induced Compartment Syndrome is a painful cramp caused by compression of muscles during exercise. 

The syndrome affects the compartments or confined spaces in the body partly surrounded by long bone: 

in the arm between the elbow and wrist 
in the leg between the thigh and knee 
in the leg between the knee and ankle. 
Causes of Exercise-Induced Compartment Syndrome
Exercise-Induced Compartment Syndrome occurs as the result of trauma to the forearm or leg or overuse of the muscles and ligaments of the lower leg. 

These injuries can cause tissues in the affected area to swell. In these compartments muscles, ligaments, nerves, and blood vessels work together. Swelling cuts off circulation of blood to ligaments, muscles, and nerves in the injured area and/or the area below it. 

The compartments in the lower leg are generally most affected. This injury occurs most often in athletes who run a great deal. It has been noted in women airline attendants because of the continued stress on their lower legs from wearing high-heeled shoes while walking a lot each day. 

Symptoms of Exercise-Induced Compartment Syndrome
The symptoms usually occur in the area of the affected compartment of the forearm, thigh, or leg. They can include: 

pain 
swelling 
weakness of the lower leg, ankle and/or foot 
warmth of affected area 
tenderness over the front of the shin 
tingling and/or numbness of the leg and foot 
foot drop (inability to lift the toes so that you must limp to keep the foot from dragging) 
pain when flexing or pointing the big toe. 
Diagnosis of Exercise-Induced Compartment Syndrome
To diagnose Exercise-Induced Compartment Syndrome, the doctor will review your symptoms, examine you, and may do a needle test to measure the increased tissue pressure within the compartment. 

Treatment of Exercise-Induced Compartment Syndrome
Depending on the cause and extent of the problem, the doctor may first treat the syndrome with ice packs to the area for 15 minutes several times a day and with anti-inflammatory medications. 

If the trauma is more severe or the injury more involved, the doctor may want additional tests that could include an arteriogram to identify where the blood flow to the area is stopped. 

If surgery is necessary, a fasciotomy is performed. This surgery involves cutting through the tissue surrounding the injured area and repairing the injury. As a result of surgery, swelling will decrease, pressure will be relieved, and the circulation to the area can be restored. 

Prevention of Exercise-Induced Compartment Syndrome
You can use warm-up exercises before exercising. Gradually increase your exercise level for any job-related activity or exercise requiring extensive use of lower arms and leg muscles.""

What this means to me is that it is not an easy fix.  The medical personnel skipped the ice pack steps entirely.  They are already starting with the tests, and a regimen that stops my PT (running at least), effectively, and builds me back up.  Considering the place where they do the Physical Therapy is two hours away, this tells me that they think it is serious.  

The way I see it, there's a range of possibilities, starting with the least serious.  That would be, I follow this profile, and by the end I'm fine, and the rest of my career is filled with lots and lots of running.

The more serious option would be I have to go to surgery, they fix everything up, and I don't really run for a while, and when I get out, the military pays me a small amount the rest of my life.

The most serious possibility that I foresee is that it is either something different, and I don't run the rest of my life, or it is a very serious version of this, and I don't run the rest of my life.  In either of THESE cases, when I get out, the military pays me a bit more, and I have medical coverage the rest of my life.

I hate running, but I guess the idea that I CAN'T run is even worse.  I'm worried about my future, mainly because I don't know enough at this point to determine what's really going on with me.  For someone who maintains an iron control over their body, this is frightening.  Only time will tell, I guess.  I'm betting that it's nothing too bad, and I'll be fine, but I don't like the possibility of something major hanging over my head, especially with the severity of the medic's reaction."

I won't appologize for the number of quizes I'm doing.  Many I do that I don't post.  The ones I do post, are the ones that I have thought about and either agree with, or they bear more thought, so that I may further unravel the mysteries of my soul.  I feel that the average day to day posts of 'Today I played World of Warcraft' or 'Today I worked really hard because my truck is a peice of shit' or 'I like potatoes' don't really scratch the surface of myself.  This journal is for me to plumb the depths of my soul, while at the same time providing those who read it some insight into myself and, perhapse, themselves.  If one person can learn something new and profound about themselves while reading this, then the world is a better place, and I am satisfied."

This is interesting.  I'm really gonna have to think about this one.  I have always called to the wind and the rain, the elements of air and water in their elemental concept, for aid and succor.  I also call to the moon, and have a special allure to it.  However, if this is accurate, perhapse the reason I never call to the earth is because I embody it.  It it is truely my element, I would have no reason to beseach myself to give myself strength.  I would call to others to give me aid in reaching those hidden centers within myself, which is what I try to do.
The other possibility is that I may have to go back and retake the quiz, and reexamine my answers.  I'll have to wait to do that, however, as in my current mood I would, likely, answer all the questions the same, or at least similar."

"event","Hehe, I have to say, I http://www.superdickery.com/ is funny.  I suggest you check it out.  The guy took pictures of OLD superman (mostly) comic covers, and posted them.  Most of these were made pre-WW2, to give you an idea.  

I have decided it's time to get an avatar, so I'm going to start approaching artists for a commissioned piece.  Nothing major, just a piece I can be proud to use as my avatar on LJ, various boards, and so forth.  A quick outline of what I need is thus:

I'm a gryphon with black coloration, standard lion/golden eagle configuration.  Bipedal, of course.  Brownish Golden eyes.  I just need a headshot, really, at least for this image.  As for clothes, there are options here, up to the artist of course.  A simple T-Shirt would suffice, however, I think I would be better suited in either modern US Army battle fatigues (the Army camo uniform), or feudal Japanese battle armor.  Again, it's up to the artist, as to what they want to draw, and what they feel will fit the picture the best.  

Far be it from me from ever interfering with an artist's inspiration.  I am in awe of the entire artistic process, as it is beyond me.  I can't draw, so I content myself in looking upon another person's creation with wonder.  To all artists, including those who work in all aspects of the visual and auditory realm, out there, thank you.  The world needs you more than you, or incidently they, know.

I'll admit this is what I TRY to be, but that's kind of hard to say, given the fact that I've never been in a relationship, per ce.  I'm always 'The Friend' or hear this 'It's kind of hard to think of you as a sexual being'.  That's something you would say to your grandma.  I guess it's kind of true.  I strive hard so that my sexual nature does not interfere with my day to day living.  Sex is fun, not something that should rule my life.  

I guess the problem is that I don't pursue anyone.  If pursued, I will reciprocate, however I have a very strong personality, so that it would take another strong personality to pursue me.  I guess I could say I'm aggresive on the street, but a bottom in bed.  Very aggressive and very bottom.  It's leading to a very lonely life.  My one hope is that I find someone I can share my life with.  I need someone who's independent, able to function without me.  I guess I'm asking a lot. An equal that takes control in matters of romance. *sighs*"

Can't choose music.  I want something slow to make me sleep, but all the slow stuff I have will make me depressed, but if I play something upbeat it'll keep me up longer.  Rawr.

Things in my life need a good gryphon mauling.  You don't even know what I would do to have my beak and talons.  I'd go to sleep well with a full crop.  Rawr.

BTW, if you haven't already, you should check out Two Mix.  It's a Japanese technoish band.  Most of their stuff is in Japanese, but some of it's English.  It's upbeat, and good.  Yeah...

So, yeah.  If I care, I might delete this post, but I doubt it.  Caring isn't high on my list of priorities for this week.  Short, rambling post.  I guess it'll give you insight on how I work when it's tired.  Well.  Goodnight.  Morning.  Whatever time it is when you read this."

"event","As some of you may know, and the rest of you now know, I was born and raised in Idaho.  There are various things I could say about this place, few of them good, but I was searching online and found a 'You might be from Idaho if...' list.  Wasn't very long, nor very good, but it had one rather interesting point.

Anyone has ever not believed you about why there are 5 parallel stripes painted across the road at the freeway onramp.

I shall explain.  When cattle graze, their grazing land is surrounded by fence, of course, but it takes too much effort to get out and open a gate every time you cross grazing land, particularly if it's on a main road for the area.  Someone came up with the idea of a pit with a grate over it.  The openings are wide enough that a cows hoof will get stuck in it, or at least wide enough that the cow won't risk it, so cars don't have to stop when crossing the fenceline.  These are called cattleguards.

So, on onramps to the highway, in grazing areas (this is IDAHO, remember), 5 parallel lines are painted across the onramp so that any cattle that got loose will think it's a cattleguard and won't cross it and end up on the freeways.

Just a quick update."

A birthday on the 10th of any month gives greater will power and self-confidence, and very often a rather original approach. 



This 1 energy may diminish your ability and desire to handle details, preferring instead to paint with a broad brush.

Hrm... this isn't completely accurate.  I don't have any 'extra energy' that it talks about it.  Also it's 'painting with a broad brush' isn't quite accurate.  I like to take a smaller section of things, and deal with the details.  I love philosophy, and painting with a broad brush ends up with the theory shot to hell.  Ah well, that's what you get for a generic 'apply to everyone' description."

"event","I won't be online from Sunday to Friday (supposedly) because I am doing a field exercise.  What this is supposed to mean is that everyone pretends to be at war and fights an imaginary battle.  What really happens is quite differnt.  For line units (people who do their jobs) this usually means getting screwed, hard, with no lube.  They have to go out somewhere, sleep in tents, and put up with the nonsensical and sometimes insane orders of their commanders (an example being, when it's -20 outside, an order to remove all heaters from the sleeping tents because of a fire hazard, yes this DID happen).  At division level, the level with all the lower ranking generals, everyone is more worried about how things look than anything else.  We work on scenarios that are completely outside the realm of possibility.  I can't give details, but the scenarios range from unlikely to absurd.  

More and more, I think that the Army needs an outside efficiency expert to come in and evaluate the Army.  Find out who needs to be cut and what can be gotten rid of.  I think you'll find a LOT fewer officers and high ranking NCOs REAL quick.  Get some good, younger guys with good ideas promoted fast.  Instead, it take a LOT of effort to get rid of someone who is a shitbag, someone who is a fuckup that no one likes.  On the other hand, if you promote them, you can get rid of them really easy.  So, if you fuck up a lot, you can get promoted easy, but if you work hard, you don't.  This entire army sucks.  Maybe I haven't seen the 'real army' yet, but none of the army I have seen has put on anything resembling a good show yet.  I should have joined the Air Force.  There are some Air Force on post here, living in the best barracks on the camp, and they get paid 'substandard living' allowances.  Substantial allowances.  Like $400 a month extra.

I guess I wouldn't mind the Army so much if I didn't just keep getting fucked every time I turn around.  Just over two years to go.  Then I can go back to college.  I got two years to figure out what I want to do with my life.  I'm gonna have to recert in SCUBA when I get out of Korea, because I'm not allowed to dive here.

Strangely, the song I'm listening to is a strangely accurate picture of the Army.  Never thought about it before."

I find it interesting that I scored higher on fundamentalist than I did on Modernist.  0% Modernist fits because I hate modern society and feel it to be corrupt.  I guess, while I don't believe what they teach, fundamentalists hold a certain moral code which, supposedly, contains the priciples of honor, though rarely do they actually display this.  Man is condemed to be free.  There is NO destiny or fate.  We can't let these ideas make us lazy because we feel that no matter what we do, things will be the same in the end.  Fate destroys the meaning of life, for it means that all we did, everything we strived for, worked for, ment nothing.  It would have ended the same anyway.  People call existentialism depressing, but I find the world where nothing I do means anything to be far more depressing than having to strive for everything we do."

"event","Well, given the comment to my last post, I decided I was going to post my favorite systems, an overview, and their merits and flaws.  These are the top four.

Ironclaw: This is a Fantasy Anthropomorphic Roleplaying Game.  Set in a richly detailed and fleshed out fantasy world of swords and magic, all the characters are humanoid animals.  Unlike standard D&D, this isn't quite high fantasy.  You won't find mages that can alter the very structure of the world in every town, or ancient dragons alive and well in a 15' by 15' in a sealed and forgotten dungeon further underground that the diameter of the planet.  There is magic, but it is not as flashy or overly destructive, but a little more subdued and overall, much better done.  The character creation system is a point based system, though the races are templated.  The dice system is one of the best encountered.  Starting with a d4, as the skill level goes up, the dice size goes up.  Skill level 2 would be d6, skill level 3 would be d8, all the way to d12.  When you reach skill level six you get a d12 AND a d4, but you only take the higher of the two (great if you don't want to critically fumble one out of every 12 times), and so on.  With a wide variety of races and professions to choose from, this game really displays some unique content that is a refreshing change of pace from the old D&D or d20 system.  They system does have it's flaws though.  While the dice system is easy, the magic system and overall rules are a bit complicated, and will take a few session of fumbling through it for a new group to feel comfortable with it.  Also, the first supplement (Rinaldi) is no longer in print, even though it's the only supplement with the mounted combat rules.  All in all, this is  a great system, one I highly recommend.  If you are a furry who likes to roleplay, check this one out. Their website is here http://www.sanguine.com/Ironclaw/

Big Eyes Small Mouth: Known as BESM, this is an anime roleplaying game.  There IS a d20 version, which is good for a d20 system, but the original game is the one that is covered.  This is a fast paced, simple, and effective system.  It has a point based character creation system, with a wide variety of broad skills, advantages and disadvantages, allowing nearly any character concept to be made, given enough points.  The dice system is extremely simple.  Two d6, low is good.  For the dice purists, give this game a chance.  It may not have all the funny shaped dice, but it's fun and effective, definitely worth the time spent to check it out.  On the down side, the supplements don't add new material so much as tailor the system to a setting.  They are funny, and a good read, but not overly useful unless you plan on running that, or a very similar, campaign.  The simple system is good for a short to medium length campaign, but breaks down in long use, and a simple system, in the end, just isn't as effective is a more complicated and specialized system tailored for the campaign.  The system is a good, solid system, for a group of friends to get together and have a good time.  Serious gamers will find this a refreshing diversion from an ongoing campaign or filler between campaigns.  http://www.guardiansorder.com/

Legend of the Five Rings: Known as L5R, this is a system based on feudal Japan.  The characters play Samurai, either Bushi (warriors) or Shugenja (magic users).  This is a complicated system, involving honor, which is internal, and glory, which is how other people see your honor.  The characters strive to survive in and defend the Emerald Empire, and their Emperor, while (usually) maintaining a strict code of Bushido.  The clan is templated, the points are used to characters discretion on attributes, skills, advantages, and disadvantages.  This system uses d10s exclusively.  The characters skill and attribute, with any modifiers (tens get rolled again and added together), then added together and compared to a target number.  The system is complicated, and it's hard for someone raised in western society to quickly grasp the intricacies of honor, so the first few sessions will be rocky, best used to show black and white honor choices, though quickly becoming grey.  The biggest problem is that the company no longer supports the old 2nd edition L5R system, instead turning all it's efforts toward the d20 version.  Their website does have the old books still for sale, but they are only mentioned near the bottom of the ordering page.  The ones without pictures and the ones with a semisolid color border around the picture are the old books.  This is, sadly, another great system that's about to be lost to time because of the d20 system.  http://www.guardiansorder.com/

Cyberpunk 2020: This is a fast paced, dirty, deadly system set in the year 2020.  Corporations control most of the society through unscrupulous means, without care of who they hurt.  Technology advanced so fast that people are in a state of futureshock.  Weapons are widely available, as is armor, drugs, and cyberware (machines grafted directed to someone, like a replacement arm that's better than the original).  The corporations hit each other through black ops moves, blowing up research facilities, kidnapping employees, etc, but can't move against each other overtly.  The characters play the people who do these illegal activities for whoever hires them, be it the corporations, the mafia, so on.  The dice system is based off of CIA statistics, police reports, and lots of not-clean-fun sources, so it's deadly and fast paced.  Skill rolls are stat+skill+d10 (d10s explode, IE, if a 10 is rolled, the dice is rerolled and added to the original number), and damage is usually d6s based on the weapon, though heavy weapons can have d10s for damage.  Characters are based off a simple template, given random stats, distibuted skills, and then equipment is purchased.  This is a deadly system.  It's unforgiving.  Stupidity WILL get you killed, and some players just aren't up to the task of playing a system that will take them to task for silliness in character (out of character is fine).  Also, this system hasn't been worked on since the mid-90s, and Cyberpunk v3 was supposed to have been demoed at Gencon 2001, but the main writer took a job working for Microsoft as a head game designer for the XBox, so it doesn't look like we'll ever see v3, so all the books are out of print.  They ARE purchasable off the website (so it says) and findable on Ebay, the most important four books are the main book, the two Chromebook compendiums (1/2 and 3/4), and Blackhands Street Weapons.  I highly recommend this system if you want a serious, near future, dark game without any supernatural.  http://www.talsorian.com/cpindex.shtml

That should give you a brief overview of some of the older, forgotten systems out there that deserve more attention than they ever had."

"event","I have always been facinated by the Legend of the Five Rings tabletop Role-Playing Game.  It's based off Japanese feudal society and focuses on honor as a key idea.  Few other games give more than lip service to the players morality based off the campaign in which they exist, even though these things are a major part of who we are.  Without getting into a rant (with is probably gonna happen later anyway), I highly recommend the game, even if the original game isn't in print anymore thanks to it being used as the d20 Oriental Adventures.  Anyway, here's the results.  No surprises here.

"event","I have been asked, many times, how did I enter the realm of furry. How did I become furry?  Well, since it's usually hard to launch into a full diatribe at the time, I figured this would be a good place to tell the whole story.

I had always been an odd kid.  I can get into that later, but the first major experience that would result in who I am today was a chance encounter with a D&D book.  My brother had bought the original boxed set, and he and his friends tried it, but didn't like it, so it sat downstairs, forgotten, until I cam along.  I had known it was there, but the only thing I really cared about was that it contained instructions for a board game 'Dungeon' that a friend and I had been trying to play for years.  When I told him where I had found it, he, having heard of D&D and desperately wanting to try it, jumped on the idea that we should play that instead.  So, he borrowed the books to learn the system and how to play, so we could begin playing.  After one session, we decided to get some more books.  The ones we had were older than we were.  I went out and bought the 2nd Edition Players Handbook, the Monster Manual, and the Planescape Setting.  He purchased the Dungeon Masters Guide.  About this time, a mutual friend of ours took over the spot as DM (as the first friend sucked at it).  Several weeks later, I was finally able to look through my Monster Manual, and I encountered Griffin in the book.  I immediately felt a connection with the creature, even though the picture sucked, and I didn't read the text about it.  I started boasting about how the Griffin was the perfect creature as kids do.

Time went on, and I encountered more and more gryphons in fantasy and gaming.  When I read 'The Black Gryphon' by Mercedes Lackey, my childhood hero became Skandranon, the Black Gryphon and main character of the book.  I was getting into MU*s online.  Text based precursors to MMORPGs, I was introduced to the Transformers fandom and quickly joined about 10 of them, usually having all 10 open simultaniously.  I won't lie, I was 14, and hyper online.  I'm sure pretty much everyone hated me. :)  I DID meet a friend there that I still have, her name is Wolfsong, a furry artist who's LiveJournal is listed under the name (found at <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=blackwintersnow"">Blackwintersnow</a> However, I didn't know she was a furry artist at the time, nor did I even know what a furry was.

Then, the same person who had become our DM for the D&D experience suggested I join furry MUCK.  I declined because he didn't explain it, and I already was on too many MU*s to begin with.  Staff on 6 MU*s and playing on 4 others is tough. :) Thus ending my first chance to enter the furfandom in failure.

Things continued on about the same for a couple years, but then my family had to move.  I had lived in Idaho Falls, Idaho all my life, so moving to Richland, Washington was tough, but I was a resilient fledgeling, so I adapted well.  I quickly found a gaming shop in Richland and was able to find a great group.  During that year, I had slowly stopped MU*ing, just because I realized that I was acting the hyperactive 14 year old, and was ashamed.  My web presence disappeared for a time.

The school year started up, I was gaming on the weekends, but I was slightly nervous.  When you are raised in a place and become an outcast, you know all the other outcasts and you stick together.  Now, I was going into a new school my Junior year of highschool friendless.  I have always been big (currently 6'3"") but I have always been the gentle giant, so I had always been picked on.  This worked to my advantage though, because none of these kids knew all my weaknesses as the others had.  However, this also left me alone.  Until, one day, I was wearing my 'Knight of the Dinner Table' T-Shirt, reading Knights of the Dinner Table (gaming magazine), sitting on the stairs, when a kid came down.  He instantly recognized KoDT, and me as a gamer, and we quickly became friends.  He introduced me to his school gaming group (having two gaming groups and no real work was wonderful).  This kid later took the name Samwise Fox.  <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/samwise_fox/"">Samwise Fox</a> He's one of the nicest people I know, though he has several faults (the most annoying being thinking he has more faults than he does :) ).  He was a fur, but was slightly intimidated by me.  I was his gaming equal (the rest of the people in the group were... sub-par), smart, and he really couldn't get a read on me.  As previously stated we became good friends, and I introduced him to my other gaming group (which was much better than the school group).

The end of my Senior year was comming, and I was going to be moving away, both my family (back to Idaho), and me, (to Moscow, Idaho for college), when Samwise finally introduced me to the fur fandom.  After several agonizing weeks of trying to figure out what animal I was, my love of the gryphon finally slapped me around a bit with a 2x4, and I realized that I WAS a gryphon.  Spiritually, I held a connection to the Gryphon that I can't quite explain.

I AM a Gryphon. I AM a Furry.  And I'm damn proud of it."

"event","Hello.  This is Sable Gryphon, as you may have guessed by the name you clicked on and that is subsequently displayed on this page.  The first question you may be asking yourself is why should you care about what I have to say?  IE Who am I?  I, too, have struggled with the question of why would anyone want to hear what I say?  What can I possibly put on the web that hasn't been seen hundreds of times?  Well, I decided I would just put my thoughts online, finally.  I keep being told that the insights I put into every day conversation are... well... insightful, so I decided to make a journal more as a place to keep those thoughts, so they aren't lost.  So, with that rambling introductions, I will begin.

I am a Gryphon.  Standard 'Golden Eagle' and 'Lion' mix, with the standard golden coloration with golden eyes.  However, I dye all my fur and feathers black, because I think it looks cool.  Yes, to those people who are well read in Mercedes Lackey, Skandranon does the same thing.  When I first joined the online community and was developing my internal identity, Skandranon was my hero.  I tried to be him online.  But that was only the starting point of myself.  Over the years, I grew away from that into a completely seperate being.  I, now, am I, instead of trying to be someone else.  I keep my affection for black, not out of Skandranon's sense of stealth and his stuborn refusal to change, but simply because I like the way it looks.  I am even tempted to play with a black and white coloration, but struggling to find a good one.  I have always been a sucker for the black and white colorations.  Penquins, Magpies, Orcas, Siberian Tigers, and so on, I love them all.  

On a completely different note, I've been playing World of Warcraft.  I possess a level 60 Paladin on the Daggerspine server, named Emeraldas.  However, I've noticed something that is hurting my love of the game, and has nothing to do with Blizzard.  There are these extremely powerful world bosses that take 40+ people to kill them.  However, sadly, I have found that the only way to ever see these is the join a high level guild.  There are never enough people high enough level on that a non-guild raid can be formed, and the guild won't take non-guild members on the raids because they are worried about the non-guild members getting the loot that should go to a guild member.  The problem with joining these guilds is the fact that A) They run on a timezone based in the states, which is extremely hard for me, being based in Korea, and B) They are generally full of people who are only interested in making their character better than you, so they aren't pleasent to be around.  It's Highschool all over again.  If you're annoying and stupid, you go far, but if you're smart and care more about friendships and helping others out, you never get to see the really cool stuff.  I guess, in the end, despite all of Blizzards efforts, the people who spend all day, every day, on the game are far stronger than the casual gamers that Blizzard was aiming for.  I guess I'm struggling not to lose interest in the game because it really is a great game.  I'm trying to start another character, but I always get bogged down in levels 10-20.  I've done those areas to death, because there aren't many of them.  If I can get a character to level 20, I know I'll have renewed interested in the game, but right now the highest I have is 14 other than my 60.  I guess I'll just have to keep working on it to see what happens.

Anyway, I'll update this journal sporatically when I come across something that I need to talk about, even if it is just to myself. :)

May the wind carry you to where you need to go.
-Sable Gryphon"

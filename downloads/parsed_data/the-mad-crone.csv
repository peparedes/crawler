"event","So I was asked to do this poster thing for my thatre company, for promotion and fundraising and all that jazz. 
<lj-cut text=""the progressive poster"">

my basic ink lines were as follows...

now the guy who asked me to do it, said ""and colour... like... watercolour..""
i was skeptical about him actually wanting watercolour, but i said if that's what he wanted, I could do it.
the result looks fine, on the original. But the photocopyablity of watercolour is less than good.

so i went my own way. scanned the lines and used Photoshop and my tablet to do some cell-style shading. 
and i was much happier, and I think he will be too.

hooray!
and i spent way too much time on this. colouring it different ways and re-drawing characters. 
uhg. 
but it's done.</lj-cut>"

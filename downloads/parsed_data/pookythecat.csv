"event","my mom said sorry for the whole night light thing. Or at least I think she did. I didn't want to make my mom sound evil. Really, she's a really good mom.
<p>I went to choir rehersal today. Almost missed it if I wouldn't have reminded my mom. I was like an hour late.
<p>My mom is so mean to my cat sometimes. She hits him when he doesn't want to eat, she yells at him and it just breaks my heart. She talks about how don't need a cat anyways and talks about getting rid of him. That would just break my heart. Like right now. *sigh*"

"event","I had the weirdest dream. I was in some kind of school with 2 of my friends. One I recognized, Sacha, who was alot skinnier in the dream. And some other person who was my random dream friend. So we were at this weird school at night and ronald mc donald was the teacher. And we were trying to ecaspe. So we went down the stairs and went through the back gate (like true idiots) and the gate locked behind us. So we walked to the back scared as fuck and we saw ronald mc donald laying on the ground. It seemed like defeating him was the only way to escape. Sacha ran over to him and jumped on him and the green force field propelled her back to where we were standing and she magically landed and her feet and said:<p> ""I can't do it, he's all powerfull.<p>Then he laughed evily and turned into this evil ronald mc donald. And then I woke up.<p>That was scary."

"event","Yesterday my mom went totally physco on me. It started when she came home and she wanted to tell me some good news. She walked into the pitch black kitchen and got mad at me for not turning the night light on in the kitchen, at first she wasn' that mad, but as time went on she got really mad. She told me to help her with her curtains in her room. Then She started saying what could have happen, like her stepping on my cat pooky. Then she started to yell. She socked me once and started to yell again and socked me again. Then she told me to put the towles up and they had better be right in 5 minutes. So I was like ok. And while I was putting the towels up she started to yelkl even louder and started bringing up some old stuff that I did and she was using it against me. Then she hit me into the closet and got the broom like she was about to hit me with it. Then she started talking about how her mom would grab anything to beat her with. So she gabed a pot and hit it against my arm and asked if I would like to get beat with that. Of course I said no. Then she hit me into the closet again and I screamed. I was hoping that I screamed loud enough so the neighbors could hear. Then when I was finished she told me to go look up something about obedience in the bible and to call Sister Hudson. So I did but she didn't call me back. 
<p>Then she stareted talking about how I'm disobedient and how my little sister is more obedient than me which gave me the idea that she liked my lil sister more then me. She was talking about calling places to send me to boot camp. <p>REMEMBER PEOPLE ALL THIS WAS BECAUSE A NIGHT LIGHT.<p>And trust me I'm not lying to you. I was so scared but I'm kinda used to it by now because she flips out over little stuff. I want to move in with my grandad..."

"event","yesterday my mom got mad at me for adding ice to my smoothie cause the bananas were already frozen. She said that's not why she was mad, she said it was because I didn't listen to her. Yeah right. She's just mad because my smoothie was the bomb! She said I couldn't use the electricity. So I was stuck playing guitar and drinking my smoothie.
<p>But a short time after that the power went out because of my neighbor (we live in a duplex). Our neighbor, Rosie, was tampering with the electricity box thingy. So like all of our power went out. Right when I on the computer (free online guitar lessons :P). My mom got hella pissed. She was yelling and man was it scary. At the time of all this I was talking on the phone with my friend Elizabeth. She told me she doesnt liek when my mom yells and to call her back later when she's not angry. Trust me, my mom mad is not something you want to be an eyewitness of. It's like teling somebody the fire is hot, but they wanna touch it to make sure. Stupid huh?"

"event","i still haven't firgured out this time thing works. Oh well. I'll just put what time it is over here. Mabey that will work.
<p>I changed the layout for my journel. My other one was too gothic lookin. I like this one better anywayz. I think I'm gonna change my avatar back to the pikachu doin DDR (Dance Dance Revolution). I thought that was cute.
<p>There nothing to do on the internet these days. Lately I've been spending all my time on neopets. Which is getting kinda boring now. It's always boring when you're a poor peasent like me. But enough about neopets.
<p>I go back to school on Sep. 2. I wanna go, but I don't wanna go. My mom's makin me wear uniform. Not so bad because I get to wear Dickies, only the best brand of pants and skirts ever to be made. I'm going to the 8th grade. I've been waiting for this my whole life. I had it planed out and everything. A word of advise, never plan out your school year. This whole uniform thing kinda ruined it. I don't know, mabey I'm exagerrating. Mabey not...
<P>My aunt still has my cd's. My ""rock"" cd's. My mom gave them to her so she can decide whether they're good or not. Bull crap if u ask me. My aunt likes that old crusty mc dusty rock. like R.E.M and stuff. I miss my Nirvana cd sooo much. Good thing I have it on my computer *devilish grin*
<p>OK I'm done for the day."

<p> Today I went to the dentist. Still no cavities. My mom wants to whiten my teeth. I also gotta brush and floss three times a day. And then she wants me to brush my teeth when I'm at school. I don't mind though. No big deal.
<p>I'm starting to get annoyed by neopets. Mabey it's because I'm broke. Whatever."

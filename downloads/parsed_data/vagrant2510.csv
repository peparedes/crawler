"event","-Well obviously we wont go as far as to say the word ""sin""...but lately it seems un-acceptable to be so, uhh forgiving that is. And whose to blame anyone, in a time when aggression is rewarded, why should anyone weaken their stratedgy plan just to seem compassionate. All anyone will ever say about them is what they exactly did: they would be considered weak. I, for one, find it very couragous and ballsy to even talk about forgiveness. But I just dont see foregiveness for what it is, what is means...i see it for what it can be. Sure there the saying goes you may forgive but not forget...but whose stopping you from forgetting, i say, of course its a givin to never forget,ever. It just feels right to me that along with forgiveness comes compassion and understanding..many of us forgive, but along with that comes a ruthlessness so harsh that it would seem to cancel the previous act of human sympathy. As of recent, my actions would qualify me as a dunce...well, to many anyway...you all know the dilly, broke up, forgave, and still replenish my thirst for humanistic tendancies. I have no doubt in my mind that i still indulge in my pastly ways...with the following of the heart and all...ok ok ok new topic, the difference and paralell relationship of forgiving and chances. When forgiving, many dont think to giving another chance...ok fine, makes sense;for obvious reason as to not fall for the same trap again. But what if theres a imense belief and attachment to the one who is in need of forgiving. What is to become of the face that we show to society, what if worth is proven once more, why is everyone so quick to shut them out when face with exact, if not similar scenarios, then another chance is put to consideration. Many will not understand my decision at all, but the dont expect them too. Difficult it is to question what is not along the path that is walked, easy it is to pronounce differences in paths and billboard them so that then becomes our definition of weakness...yeah,yeah!thats it, we define weakness as the path that only a few and seemingly ""mis-guided"" take....according to society, i am weak because i love, i am weak because i choose to see the prospective good in someone rather than acts committed, i am weak because i cannot let love go, i am weak because i forgive, to everyone else, i am dumb, i am self-defeating, and i do not learn from my mistakes, but i do not see mistakes...i see paths traveled differently and the reactions they cause, they say im making a mistake, i say i see hope for a better tomorrow....a fool i am, that may be so, but slander me not for trying to see good in what most would say is a cruel world..make fun of my ways, but not at how i attempt to give life to my ghastly human nature..."

"event","<P>yeah...there's not much new in my life right now... just enjoying the summer and partying it up. last wed, christie, the girls, and billy and his friends and i went to JD's and Time and that was a lot of fun! i've been to Sevin but never those two places. Amy and i had a lot of fun up on stage but other than that there weren't many <EM>HOT</EM> guys there or anything, but it was still a good time. last night i went to go look at some cars and stuff and my dad, sis, and i are, as of now, trying to lease a Saab, but we're not sure if its going to go through or not b/c they can't find one near here that fits what we want. what can i say, we're picky! lol. but the two guys that helped me and lisa were really hot. they're both from Europe (one's from Sweden and the other is from the Netherlands) and had the HOTTEST accents. i can't resist a guy with a european or southern accent lol. i think that might be one of my biggest weaknesses. HAHA. but yeah if the Saab doesnt go through, then i dunno what kind of car i want... i was thinking a Grand Am GT or a Stratus or something else thats kinda fun. but my dad wants us to get a stick shift b/c ""thats what everyone in Europe drives"" so i guess i'm going to have to learn pretty quickly here how to drive a stick. i dont think it'll be a problem, its just going to take a while to get used to. but w/e. its a car ya know? <STRONG>:-) </STRONG>so yeah, John (not to be confused with my brother john) has been in Florida now for over 2 weeks and i'm really starting to miss him. but what i dont know is if i really miss him or just the company... i dunno i gotta still figure some stuff out. boys are confusing. or maybe its just my feelings that are confusing.......</P>

"event","<P>yeah... i think i had the most interesting week i've ever had in my life. to start it off, my dad, sis, and bro come home from camping and pick up a puppy on the way (her name is molly and she's a chocolate lab and <EM>adorable</EM>). ok, here's where the <EM>drama</EM> comes in...the&nbsp;following thursday, i'm hanging out with christie and a couple of our friends and i get a call from one of my sister's friends saying that lisa is wasted, but nothing to worry about,&nbsp;and blah blah blah. so we left it as lisa was going to spend the night at her friends house or w/e. then i get&nbsp;a call from someone else saying that i better come get lisa or they're calling the cops. so then i'm thinking, ""how bad is she?"" and it turns out when christie, chad and i get to this party, my sister is lying on her back, when she's still throwing up, and is <STRONG>totally</STRONG> <STRONG>non-coherent</STRONG>. so needless to say i was a little pissed at her at first. then ppl help me get lisa in the car and she falls out of the car and onto the cement. ok, she is my sister and i've never had to deal with anybody this drunk, so i start getting scared and start to cry.&nbsp;steve starts&nbsp;holding me, and as he's doing that, i guess some guy starts shit with christie telling her that we're too loud and have to leave. well no shit sherlock, its not like we wanted to stay and party anyways. so he starts calling christie a bitch and whore and whatnot, and christie smacks him and honestly, i dont blame her. i would do the same. so then me and christie start asking why no one would at least take the alcohol away from lisa if they saw her ""chugging inches at a time"". i guess its just comforting to know that my friends would care enough about me to not let me get that bad. so i'm driving away and i can barely drive b/c i'm crying so hard and flipping out. so christie gets on the phone with my mom and my mom says to take lisa to the hospital so we went to beaumont and lisa had to get some shit put in her to i guess detox her or something. all i know is i was really freaking out. <U>and honestly, i wanted to say thanks to the couple of ppl who cared enough to call me and help take care of lisa- u guys know who you are.</U> but yeah i guess now christie and i are getting shit talked about us b/c of what happened that night and all i have to say about it is this. <STRONG>1)</STRONG> the guy who started shit with christie is <STRONG><U>THE BIGGEST PUSSY</U></STRONG> i have ever known b/c now he has his GIRLFRIEND, yeah girlfriend, after christie. <STRONG>2) </STRONG>if ppl dont think i should've taken lisa to the hospital and that she was fine, thats a bunch of bs b/c her blood alcohol level was .215 and the toxic level is .25 so you can see how close she was to that. but the main reason i brought her there was b/c she's my sister and i didnt want anything to happen to her. one of the biggest things i learned from this experience was to pick your friends wisely b/c in situations like what my sister went through, you learn <EM>very</EM> quickly who your true friends are.</P>

"event","<P>tonight i was watching VH1's 100 best love songs, or something like that, and i heard that Tina Turner song, ""What's love got to do with it"" and the verse where it says ""who needs a heart when a heart can be broken"" makes a lot of sense... i dunno it just sounded, good i guess, to me. lol i'm in a weird mood. but yeah i got invited to go to the Kanye West and some other ppl like Brandy and whatnot concert tonight, and i have work tomorrow from 5-9. so that sucks. but my friend that asked me to go i guess has some friends that could get me and a few friends into some clubs, so i might go do that tomorrow night. i've never been clubbing, but i love to dance, so i think it might be fun! i think tomorrow i might go to the beach with some friends and get some sun and just chill, so that should be fun also. but yeah, a couple days ago, my mom mentioned to me that this one pageant was going on and she wanted me to enter it, but i'm scared. i mean, my mom was peach queen of '81 or something and she did pageants, so if i ""follow her footsteps"" and do this and i loose, i'd be crushed. i mean, on my mom's side of the family, my sister is the one who is all state in lacrosse and really smart and expected to do well in life, and i'm considered to be the beauty and to marry well and be the perfect country club wife and tennis mom or whatnot. that sounds really old fashioned, but thats just how my 100% Italian family still thinks. its kinda weird tho because my sister is pretty also, but i guess because i didnt get a 4.0, i have to do something else in life besides getting a good career. but i dunno, it might be fun so i might give it a try. w/e its not a huge deal. lol her, my Nana, and my mom's old teacher who got her to do the peach queen festival asked me if i wanted to do the peach queen pageant this summer and i was like, ""HELL NO"". that would just be too weird- a mom and daughter in the pageant. <STRONG>no way</STRONG> would i ever do that one. OH YEAH! i almost forgot... my birthday is in 7 days, so on june 30th, i'm planning on going to a club and paryting the night away, so if you want to come and joing me and some ppl, give me a call! i think a lot of ppl are planning on showing up, so it should be fun! we'll see how it all goes tho. ok well i'm sleepy and i want to read my cosmo, so good night! </P>

"event","<P>Last sat., i found out that a girl i used to know and see every once in a while died in a waverunner/jetski accident. she was 17 and just graduated. it still blows my mind to know that i just saw her mabybe a month ago and she was still the sweet, loveable ashley i used to know. i still remember the first time i met her that she was one of the first people to walk up to me and introduce herself. she was&nbsp;always so nice to me and would always take time to see how i was and just to talk. i always thought she was the nicest person i have ever met just because of how friendly and personable she was. she always knew how to have fun and was ALOT of fun to be around. i remember last memorial day(in 2003) going to stoney with a bunch of ppl and she was there and her, kassie, and i went and made a food run. the whole time she was making kass and i laugh and it was just so much fun. she would always tease me about how girly-girl i was and wherever she was, you know everyone else was having fun. you never know when someone u love/care about could be gone. i guess from now on i'm going to take more chances and tell people how i feel and let them know that i appreciate their friendship and support. there have been a lot of ppl in my life that have been there through thick and thin. to those ppl i want to say thanks for always being there and i really appreciate your love/ friendship. Ashley, even though i didnt know you as well as some other ppl did, i will miss you and you will always be in my heart.</P>

But anyways, i was such a dork/klutz this weekend. first of all, on sat, i was sitting in jess' car and all i could think about was how i knew i had some type of hw to do and what the heck it could be...then i realized we're done with school. that was a nice feeling lol. then, as i'm leaving christie's house on sat, i'm walking down her stairs and i fell. like 4 stairs down. lol my mind was all weird this weekend. but yeah, right now, i have to get ready for church and then the bbq that my dad is putting on- guess who has to do dishes?

AHHH i really need to find a new job! i heard this one golf club is hiring and i think it would be fun to be a beer girl- u know, where u drive a cart around and serve beer. i think i'd be good at that lol. ohhh jeezzz... i was thinking today that my birthday is coming up in a month...YAY!! lol i know what i'll be doing that night- clubbin with my girls:) cannot wait. hopefully its the best birthday ever since my parents, for the past 9 years, decide that its just GREAT fun to get into a fight on my birthday. well, this time, i'm just not even gonna go home lol. i'll be out with my friends!:) i also decided today (today was a contemplative day i guess) that i wont be having a graduation party. at least not at my dad's. i dunno i just dont think its worth it when my dad said we could go to Andiamos or The Palm with close fam and a few friends and just get me some nice gifts... like hopefully a labtop or a nice burberry purse:) i'm hopin'... but we'll see.

"event","i obviously am aware that i have 3 more days left of school, but today, i was really thinking about it. The past 4 years of my life have been spent at AHS and it was probobly some of the best years of my life... i had a pretty normal high school experience. sure there were bumps in the road and some unfortunate occurances, but it really taught me a lot. i grew up a whole lot from this experience. i learned how to be responsible and take responsibility of my actions, i learned what true friends really are, and i learned that not everything works out according to plan. the best part i think was meeting and becoming close to so many people, and its really gonna suck when we all leave-knowing that we probobly will never talk again. its kinda scary... but then i think about how much fun college is gonna be and how many more new and exciting experiences i will have in college. thats what i'm really looking forward to. but its just so bittersweet...i'm gonna miss SOOO many people, and not just the seniors, even some underclassmen. its been a hell of a ride and i'm so glad i had such an awesome time at Athens. i hope that i stay close/in touch with all my friends and hopefully my underclassmen friends wont miss me too much. lol. its just so weird knowing that i will never step foot in athens again as a student...wow.

<P>I'm joining the chorus. <FONT color=#ff0000>YEY</FONT> <STRONG>go me-</STRONG> the chorus geek to be!! haha nah- I can't wait, singing is my passion, I just need to learn&nbsp;how to control my voice. </P>
<P><EM>...moving on...</EM></P>
<P>I applied for a position at Perkins today, if this doesn't work out, then Winn Dixie or Publix are my next victims...mwahahaaha. Ok evil moment over.</P>
<P>Nice hair Erik...it's so....<EM>you</EM>? Sure why not, that works.</P>
<P>Dead body found in Wally World. But <EM>everyone </EM>knows about that already. If you don't know about it, I suggest you get out more. heh.</P>
<P><STRONG>Good</STRONG> lunch food with Salina ;) <EM>yeah</EM> babah.</P>
<P><STRONG>v.e.r.y good</STRONG> hugs and makeout sessions with Andrew. As always ;)</P>
<P><STRONG>Oh! </STRONG>I almost forgot. I was talking to this kid today in first period. I won't use names on the risk of getting him jumped. (although that might not be too bad of a thing).</P>
<P>Me: Did anyone go to the concert last night?</P>
<P>Him and like, 3 other people: Nope.</P>
<P>Me: It was awsome, my boyfriend was in the drumline. They were great.</P>
<P>Him: Your boyfriend is black, isn't he?</P>
<P>Me: Yeah.</P>
<P>Him: Well, i'm racist and I don't believe in that mixing crap.</P>
<P>Me: Well then, it's a good thing you're not dating a black girl.</P>
<P>Him: Hell yeah that would be nasty, they have all that nappy hair.</P>
<P>Me: So, you don't find Beyonce Knowles attractive?</P>
<P>Him: Who's that?</P>
<P>::laughter heard from across the room @ such ignorance::</P>
<P>Random person: She was that girl in Gold member.</P>
<P>Him:Oh, her? She's ugly.</P>
<P>Me: Haha no way. So I suppose you don't like big butts&nbsp;too?</P>
<P>Him: No-</P>
<P>Me: Yeah, you like little skinny butts? Or maybe just a straight down back?</P>
<P>Him: No, just little. Plus, black people are loud. They're always&nbsp;in the hallways yelling to eachother, like they can't go up to eachother and talk.</P>
<P>Me: Not all black people are like that, and I can name many white people who are loud too. What do you think of Hitler?</P>
<P>Him: Hitler's awsome.</P>
<P>Me: You're going to Hell.</P>
<P>Then Danielle and I moved across the room. I can't stand ignorant people, it's sad, really.</P>

I guess...I'll just do what feels right in my heart. One thing i've learned though, is some people really wont take your words seriously until you take serious actions. 

Time for serious actions.

I cried today, I didn't expect it. Normally I know when the tears are coming, but they surprised me today.

"event","<P>I can't&nbsp;possibly <STRONG>begin </STRONG>to describe the incredible <STRONG><EM>anger </EM></STRONG>i'm feeling right now. I don't even know where to begin-</P>
<P>Have you ever&nbsp;been&nbsp;so angry&nbsp;that you've cried? Not crying out of sadness, but you're so angry you can't help it. Then, afterwards you have this headache, and you can feel the tears in the back of your eyes-just waiting to be released. Well, that doesn't even begin to describe what i'm feeling.</P>
<P>My family is so broken. I don't feel guilty in the least by saying that my mother is the <STRONG>cause</STRONG> of our detachment. My brother is failing math, and there is a very&nbsp;great chance that he will get held back. Well, my mom and dad decided that he wouldn't be allowed to use the computer for his whole spring break. (He <STRONG><EM>lives </EM></STRONG>on the computer, playing <STRONG>runescape</STRONG>. It's all he talks about, ever- and i'm not overexaggerating.) It's sick, i've never seen anyone so obsessed with a game. This week, his spring break started. <EM>He has been on the computer every day since then.</EM> I tell my parents, and they care for the first day- they have a little meeting to talk about what they should do about him-the whole thing was BULLSHIT because he recieved NO PUNISHMENT. They just don't <EM>care </EM>that he doesn't respect what they say. He does nothing around the house, and complains when asked to do something. He is so disrespectful, he talks back to my mom, calling her ""<EM>female</EM>"" and condescending shit like that. I honestly <STRONG>hate </STRONG>the person he has become. I feel like I need to straighten him out by making him do the things my parents ask him to do, and be on his back until he does it. But the sad thing is, that <EM>is </EM>what I have to do in order for him to actually get off his ass and do something asked of him. I can't take it anymore....I can't. I feel like there is nothing I can do, but there is so much I want to do.</P>
<P>My mom grounded me from the phone today because I was doing something and couldn't whipe my nepphew's ass right away. I told her I couldn't believe that I got punished for not whiping my nepphews butt when my <EM>brother </EM>didn't even get a minor punishment for disrespecting their wishes. I told her that the child she <EM>should </EM>be focusing on was Richard. He's only 12 and he has no respect. So what's gonna happen when he gets into highschool? He's only going to get worse. Then I told her that he's gonna be a drug addict with the direction he's going and she screamed to me at the top of her lungs ""<STRONG>shut the fuck up</STRONG>""</P>
<P>and I know why that made her anger boil over, because she knows it's true. Every <STRONG>ounce </STRONG>of what I said to her was the absolute truth. And that scares her to death because she doesn't know what to do, and she feels powerless. That's why she's always so angry...she's angry at herself.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>love</P>"

"event","<P>Interesting. I left Thursday during school to go to New York. My cousin was getting married...It was a beautiful wedding. I've decided that I really don't want to get married the way she did, in a church, because it all seemed so...I don't know, what's the word...informal. <BR>Not the outfits, or the surroundings, but the actual event of their marriage. My cousin and the groom (Anthony) actually sat down while the priest spoke. I don't want my wedding to be like that, I want it old-fashioned. It wasn't even announced ""I now pronounce you husband and wife, you may kiss the bride."" I couldn't tell at what point during the ceremony they were really made husband and wife...oh well...</P>
<P>The remainder of my Spring break was spent hanging out with my family in New York, and we came back last Thursday.</P>
<P>Speeding up to Saturday. Andrew was going to come over since it was a special occasion...</P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff><BR>HAPPY ONE YEAR BABY!!!!!!!!!<BR></FONT></P>
<P>...but his mom wanted him to go to this picnick his church was having by the water. It was actually alot of fun. Good food...nice scenery...good food....haha. I liked the food. Danielle was there and so was this girl Sabrina, she was really friendly. I like her :) </P>
<P>Nature walks are great.</P>
<P>There was <STRONG>one </STRONG>event that kind of&nbsp;put a damper on the whole evening, but i'm not going to get into details right now. Anywho, I think i'm going to go lay out. Wish me luck.</P>

<P><FONT size=1>Universal was <STRONG>so </STRONG>great. When we got there, we all ate a sub in the van. It was yummyful. Anyways, after stuffing our faces, we proceeded to the park. The first ride we went on was ""Jurassic Park"" haha Andrew got <STRONG>so </STRONG>soaked. I had a water bottle and I dumped it on my dad and brother right before the big drop. Well we went on that twice, and then we went on popeye. Man o man we all got so <STRONG>wet, </STRONG>all of our clothes were soaked.&nbsp; Okay, so after popeye, they were begging me to go on ""Dr. Doom"" and I knew that I would get sick because that thing just shakes, and rides like that don't mix well with me. I gave in after about 15 minutes of pleading and decided to ride it. Just to be nice ;) haha. I didn't feel really sick afterwards, so I thought it would be okay for us to go on the hulk. Well, I screamed the first minute, and then I felt it comming. I was gonna puke. Thankfully, the ride ended before I blew. Andrew could tell, too...and he held me the whole way to the bathroom- God I really felt like I was gonna puke right then and there. I spent the next half hour in the bathroom, staring at the toilet...-it was no go. I wasn't gonna puke but I still felt sick. It even hurt to move my eyes and speak. So, to help me recouperate, we went back into our <STRONG>*new* </STRONG>van and put down the back seat so I could lay down. We stayed in the van for about an hour and watched The Matrix Reloaded, by then I could walk by myself. We went back into the park and went on Spiderman, I closed my eyes the whole time, because the screen was making me feel sicker. After that, my brothers went on Dueling Dragons- Andrew wanted to go on it, and I told him to go- but he wanted more to stay with me (which was really, <STRONG>really</STRONG> sweet of him)- So we walked around and looked at the shops, tried on sunglasses and watched these weird people make coins. It was really fun. So by then it was about 6:40, and the park closes at 7:00 so we left to go out to eat. I was really set on eating at Outback-dang they've got some good food. Me and Andrew got the same thing- my brothers, my brother's friend, and my dad were acting soo crazy, it was great haha. Andrew and Dan, my brother's friend, really hit it off. It was so cute watching him mess w/ Dan. Good times, good times. The ride home was perfect. Andrew and I in the backseat, he held me the whole time. Even kissed me once when I wasnt expecting it. It was so sweet, I love him so much....</FONT></P>

Moving on...
Danielle, I don't see why you're mad at me, You were sapposed to call ME back and that never happened. Plus, you know my number is blocked and that I can't get through to your house. And I didn't get pissed at you once when you stood me up three weeks in a row when I was sapposed to go to church with you. Another thing- you said I was just using going to church with you as a way to see Andrew- yeah that played a big part in me wanting to go- but you're being hypocritical in saying that because you have came over my house and then spent the whole time with Ruslan- I didn't get pissy at you for THAT either. I told you my plans with Cheltsy weren't for sure, and that if you called me back telling me if I could hang w/ you that I would, but you didn't- so what did you expect?

Andrew: No, it is, cause I have it on my phone. And it's Wednesday.
Martine: No, it's Tuesday, we've been doing FCAT yesterday and today. Oh wait...Monday was that calculator thing....oOoOohhhhhhh!!! Happy Anniversary baby!!!

....haha, oh goodness. that was sad, yet funny. My mom is taking Andrew and I to Universal, and one of the days my mom is thinking of going is April 3rd.....OUR 1-YEAR-ANNIVERSARY!
-only SHE doesn't know that. Wow...that would be so completely perfect. Thats gonna be some fun shit. Heck yeah!

<P>Anywho- I'm bored. Afsha gave me a really sweet note today (i'm writing you back this weekend).</P>
<P>Man, I swear, I almost DIED in Mr. Eddy's class today. I have the highest grade in the class (of 8 people -hahahaha- great accomplishment, right?). Well my average is at LEAST&nbsp;a high B per test, and today, my brain just shut down. It sucked. So right..are you following me still?....good...Well I was turning in my test, (Mr. Eddy was in his office)&nbsp;and Tony says to me ""Dang, Mr. Eddy is so stupid, he left the answers on his desk."" Sure enough, I looked over and there they were...calling for me to look at them. I didn't want it to be obvious, so Tony read the answers to me...I got alot of them right anyway. But I made a ""B"" (80%) on it. An <STRONG>ok </STRONG>grade. N-E-wayz. Moving on.</P>
<P>My biology mid-term is on Thursday. Here's the deal, i'm bringing in my dog, and a video for shiggles and gits. The video blows ass, but it has that stupid kinda humor in it that you would see in ""All That."" It's better than talking for 6+ minutes.</P>
<P>I bet you're wondering if I have anything to talk about of even the slightest of significance. Well, the truth is, <STRONG>no</STRONG>.</P>
<P>My brothers are kicking&nbsp; eachother's butts. Should I interfer?.......Nah.</P>

<P>Yeah a freaking <STRONG>GAY-ASS <U><FONT size=4>A-FUKIN-WAY-</FONT><FONT size=5>GAME.</FONT></U></STRONG></P>
<P>Now, isn't that some absolute bullshit. Fuck that. That's not fair. It's <STRONG><EM><FONT color=#ff0000><U>VALENTINE'S DAY&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT></EM></STRONG></P>
<P>for fuckin fuck's sake-what the fuck? Valentine's day- our first one <STRONG>TOGETHER</STRONG>...and he's gonna be away? God, what the fuck, of all days?</P>
<P>That was so important to me- I was <EM>so</EM>&nbsp;looking forward to our first Valentine's day like Christmas-. They'd damned well better make it worth it and win then. Or else I <STRONG><U>WILL </U></STRONG>kick some serious buttocks. Not Andrew's...just, ...some.</P>
<P>I don't know-I just wanted to be with him on Valentine's Day.</P>
<P>Okay- well I can't dwell on that subject forever- so, moving on...</P>
<P>Boredom.</P>
<P>My days are so uneventful- I wish I could be aprt of some kinda activity- that's why I enjoy working so much. It makes me feel like i'm making some kinda difference, even if it may be small. Hell- yesterday I washed my dad's car OVER&nbsp;after my brothers did a crappy job on it ALL because I wanted to actually get out an DO something. Update later.</P>

"event","<P>I'm bored, and I have this sudden liking to Marilyn Monroe. She's really classy (If you haden't noticed, that IS her in my background). Anywho- My butt bone hurts. I can feel it everytime I sit down, like pokin&nbsp;a little to the&nbsp;right side. It's <STRONG>REALLY </STRONG>annoying. grr @ that. I miss <STRONG>my</STRONG> baby boy. People annoy me. Not all people, but many. I want to kick sum people's asses. Not <STRONG>ALL </STRONG> Racists piss me off. You don't even know. I have to sit with them EVERY FREAKIN LUNCH. That is a <STRONG>SHITLOAD</STRONG> of red. So moving onto the next subject...lets see...biology final...animal instincts....zoo...blah blah, blah blah......annoying ass librarians taking over computer and logging me off.....roy talking about psycho killers...annoying people at lunch...blah blah.....boring comp. apps. class....make out with baby daddy by busses...blah blah. And THAT, folks, was my day.</P>

"event","<P>Well, yesterday I talked to Andrew about what had been on my mind, and I feel better now. He always knows how to make me smile. (<EM>Ps- If you are one of those people who for some odd reason ""dislike"" entries about significant others, leave now.) </EM>I know that he loves <STRONG>me </STRONG>and only <STRONG>me</STRONG>- I trust him when he says that. The way he looks at me-amazes me...I've never seen it from anyone before. And the other day, I was looking at him, and he was just staring into my eyes. I was like- what?? And he described in <STRONG>detail</STRONG> the colors in my eyes. It was so sweet. I honestly can't see my future without him. I mean yeah- we have had some rocky times, but they just seem to bring us closer together </P>
<P>(very, <STRONG>very, </STRONG><FONT size=4><STRONG>very </STRONG></FONT><FONT size=3>close if ya know what I mean ;) And I don't just mean physically- spiritually as well. As he says ""it's like we're one person."" God he makes me feel so <STRONG>special</STRONG>- like always saying how we're going to grow older together and have our&nbsp;cute lil oreo babies-haha. (Well I say the oreo part-but you catch my drift.) We've grown together so much- I look into his eyes and all I can see is my future. :)</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>alright, i'm gonna go before you all gag. haha. love ya's.</P>"

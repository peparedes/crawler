I have a new roommate. Mother suggested, father approved.


His name is Dann. He got himself a 50k/yr. job and i'm so so so proud of him!! If anyone deserves it, it is him. I love more than anything. And I finally have someone who is an equal, if not better than me, at video games. yay!

I start my first day of work next week. I'm looking forward to seeing everybody again on a daily basis... and sending emails to SGH on a daily basis. god bless Microsoft Outlook.

I am in WDW withdrawal. <3epcotcenter<3 I miss the feeling of wind running through my hair while my legs stick to the blue leather seats on the TTA.

Okay. That is a quick update on my life at the moment =D
 
Time to go play some Nintendo."

my cousin is in the air force and he was in the first plane to fly into afghanistan, which im proud of him for.. ya know.. fighting for us and stuff.......

but anywho he's still an asshole.

so he asked me what im doing now and i told him that i was hired as an interior designer at an architectural firm. and this is how the conversation continued:

<i>him:</i> OOOOH so can you decorate my cabin when i build one in a few years?
<i>me:</i> I don't do that.
<i>him:</i> Well then what do you do?
<i>me:</i> I build structures I don't put up curtains.
<i>him:</i> Right. So basically you decide how the stove relates to the oven.
<i>me thinking to myself</i> *i'll fucking show you where i'll put the goddamn stove you asshole.*
<i>me:</i> No, actually the other day i was working on the morgue in Harvard Medical School creating the As-Builts for the engineering drawings.
<i>him:</i> yeah so when i build a cabin.. i want a 2 car garage... a barn with a causeway connecting it to the house.... 


and so on.

i was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO fucking bullshit. from that point on it was bitter erin. 

fucking ignorant assholes.

"event","Work was exceptionally satisfying today.

Since the end of september I have been in charge of the construction documents for some of the floors in 3 PO Square and 24 Federal St. in Boston. Today was the first meeting since the project was bid on. Paul and I went to Boston to meet with the client and the head construction guy. So i was expecting it to be me, paul, bob and shaun. But instead it was the 4 of us plus like 8 other contractors and engineers. It was kinda funny... just lil old me with a bunch of construction guys asking me questions about things. 

I dunno, it was just cool because construction was already underway on some of the floors in the buildings. It was really neat to look at it and be like.. ""yeah, you totally did that work because of the drawings that I did.""  The fact that i had the power to develop drawings that created a change on a building is satisfying. I don't know.. i may be lame for being proud of myself but I am. It was cool to see these big guys carrying around MY drawings and spreading them out and discussing them with one another. 

So this is officially my first project that I had a lot of authority on and I actually got to see the steps they are taking to build it. 

And I know it's only going to get even harder and more exciting from here."

"event","Very very weird dreams lately. And they all seem to be involving celebrities.

<b>Dream 1:</b> I am leaving work one day when it's snowing. I see Brandon Lee (as Eric Draven) walking down the cobblestone road and I yell ""hey!!"" to him. He was dressed like the crow, but the wasn't famous in my dream. He was just some guy wearing an outfit like Eric Draven. Soo... yeah. I yell hey then I say ""I normally don't talk to random guys but I had to talk to you"". Then right when I'm in the middle of talking to him my mom picks me up from work and that was the end of it. At the same time she ""picks me up"" my alarm goes off. Fucker.

<b>Dream 2:</b> Erica and I go to work one night for a party that Mark and Paul are throwing. It's a random party so we didn't know whats up. We step off the elevator and everyone is in the conference room watching something on a projector screen. We walk in the room and there is Jon Bon Jovi sitting there with his poofy hair and tight jeans (not the 'updated' look he has now). Apparently, Mark and Paul made a video for Bon Jovi and this was a party celebrating it.

<b>Dream 3:</b> I am outside of my house with my family and a few friends when everyone in the Huxtible family individually shows up at my house for a ""reunion."" My mom was on an episode teaching some child how to read. Heathcliff gave my mom a huge hug and thanked her for all her work on the show. Vanessa was wearing a camo-green trench coat. Theo has dreds like he does in real life now. Claire batted her eyelashes at Cliff because he was giving a long hug to my mom. Sandra and Elvin were there. And that hippy girl who's name i just had a total brainfart with wasn't there. BUT!! Cockroach was. 

<i>After a discussion about my dreams with Mr. Potvin I was told that i watch too much tv. But i made last night an exception because I was alone in a hotel room and the tv kept me company. </i>"

Picture this... we're driving home from the mall. I am complaining about the xmas music that she is making me listen to on the radio.

I state how sick i am of Feliz Navidad because i've already heard it about 9 times in the past 2 days. Since Antichrist Superstar was in my cd player i decide to put on the Beautiful People. 

My mom says to me, ""And how many times have you heard this in the past two days???""

I state, ""About 9 times in the past DAY."" Then i proceed to change it so she doesn't complain.......

Then she yells, ""NO! PUT IT BACK!""

My jaw drops. I put it back on the Beautiful People.

I turn to my right to see my mom banging her feet, her head, and her fists to Marilyn Manson.

She turns up the song. And she keeps whispering ""the beautiful people the beautiful people... aaahhhhh ..."" and when they go ""aaahh"" She raises her hands like they do in the video. 

I was speechless.. i wanted to laugh but i didn't want her to stop cuz i honestly had never seen her like that before EVER. I mean, she's banged her head to The Genitorturers. But this was FULL body movement.

I just wanted to document this joyous occasion. So someday i can look back on it and be proud.

It has come to my attention that there have been some outstanding noises taking place in the work area.  All bodily functions need to be done in another room this includes, coughing, sneezing, farting, and anytype of throat clearing. Also any type of banging of food items should not take place in the immediate work area.  These noises have tried to be drowned out by music and other soft soothing noises.. but the noises are just too loud and jarring!

&hearts; Seeing my long lost uncle at Bella Italia. To all of you not familiar with Bella Italia.. it is home to the nectar of the italian gods.
&hearts; When most people have a 1 hour wait.. they wait.. what do we do? we shop!
&hearts; My dinner (if i knew the word for dinner in italian i'd write it) = Penne Greco Romana: penne pasta, basil, peppers, FETA!!! and eggplant. Ems' dinner = I'll let her describe it.
&hearts; And we are very glad the couple next to us finally got their food. Bella cannot have any upset customers.
&hearts; More shopping... Target in Nashua = soooo disappointing. Lacking in the kitty.
&hearts; Bryan, the nice, talkative Finnish guy at PacSun. He was super friendly... although maybe a little TOO keen on fashion. But he liked emily's Mambo jacket so he gets an A++ in our book.
&hearts; Jake, the obnoxious and pushy guy at Hot Topic. Although he redeemed his obnoxious qualities when he finally gave up on trying to get emily to buy more than she wanted to. And she got a jack skellington bag so all is well... and i told Jake he had nice hair (which he sorta did.. but it wasn't too noteworthy).
&hearts; We feel bad if we look at something to buy and don't end up buying it. I felt bad at the jewelry place... i felt super violated at the hair place.. I could smell that womans breath and feel it running down my neck. <i>""uuuhh erin... look to your right""</i>
&hearts; english candy. yay! 
&hearts; I still feel bad for that nice guy at DQ. I got = small vanilla cone with CHOCOLATE SPRINKLES (god that was hard for me to type). Emily got = I'll let her describe. <i>emily: ""you were even 'bullshit' when you were young?"" erin: ""no this was a few months ago!""</i>
&hearts; being followed by 11 year olds. most likely due to my ice cream cone. we're fun girls. although we are in our 20s!!!!!!!!!!!!! yeesh people.
&hearts; one liners.
&hearts; and last but not least..... limited too is good for both clothes and cute pictures. and NOT the sticker type!!!!

Please conclude my literature review for me. Since you seem to get off on commas and the MLA format I'm sure you would be interested in writing a simple conclusion. I'll even throw in a free definition of the differences between ""affect"" and ""effect."" I feel that 19 pages is enough to describe how designs that promote interaction affect corporate productivity. Please consider this.

More anon,

Erin"

"event","So I'm sitting here at work with Kristin. And im updating this because we both decided that I need to document this idea and this would be a good way so i can go back and look at what i wrote if we ever actually followed through with something like this.

Last night I dreamt of being backstage at a Manson concert. In the backstage area Manson had actually done the design and was very detailed about everything he did.. right down to the lighting. In my dream he had a chandelier made out of handguns. So I was telling Kristin about it and we decided that I need to try and design this. 

It's pretty hott.

We went on to think of other gun items that we could possibly design. So that's my idea. Probly would never ever happen.. but now it gives me something to play around with.

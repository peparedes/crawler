"event","so this is my first entry in this thing. im not exactly sure what im supposed to be typing. anyway, im in pembroke pines right now visiting friends and family, ive been here a little less than a week. im fucking over it. i miss gainesville and i miss my bike and i miss my friends. and i miss not having my mom breathing down my neck. so it turns out the place i was planning on moving in isnt happening. the landlord said no dogs! so when i get back, house hunting again. blah, it wouldnt be so bad, but school starts in a few days and i really dont feel like dealing with it. 

so what did i do today .. um, i went to a garage sale and bought a cat stevens record. i did a lot of sitting around, then went out to dinner with my mom. i hate it here. im going back to gainesville sometime tomorrow, i cant wait. 

ok im done. not so interesting today."

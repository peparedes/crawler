"event","Friday night Dale stayed the night at my house. I got him this jade zodiac chinese good luck charm, and i was trying to be all sweet in bed and tell him a little about it. Then when i gave it to him he was like umm im not a cock im a dog. I felt so stupid, my intoxication when i purchased it prob. did not help. Anyways, Dale took out the gift that he got me, which was a book called "" The prophet"" and tried to read his favorite part to me but i was too drunk and could not understand. I felt really bad for how bad i was being, and i did not want to fell like an ass any more, so i took out the other gift that i got him. I got him a flask with his name engraved on it, and then "" love Steven"" on the back. He really liked it, then he gave me a pair of boxers, and socks. So after we finished opening up our gifts we got it on. Then on saturday morning I woke up around 10Am and made Dale Breakfast. It was really good i made eggs, waffles, fried potatoes, and biscuits. We hung out around the house for a little longer and then, we went to Fat tuesday's. Dale, david, manny, and i all went there, we had a few cocktails and an appetizer then left after 2 hours. We dropped david off at his car, and dale and i went back to my house. We were so sited from the night before so we took a nap until 10pm. the nap was a nice addition to the day. So after we woke up we both got ready, and then we to erica's party. It was alright, nothing spectacular. I was only able to have one beer because i had to drive. The party got old quick, and i was not having that great of a time. Dale had wanted to go to his friend's party also, so we stayed about an hour and a half then left to mark's party. There were many people there that i knew, and all of dale's friends were there. We didnt stay there to long, and nothing exciting happened, well dale had drank some pickle juice from the party earlier, and was throwing it up in the bathroom. We left for house around 2am. When dale and i got home we got ready for bed and hit the sack.

"event","I got a phone call on wed. night as i was getting out of the car. I didnt recongize the number, but i answered it anyways. I asked who it was and the reply was DALE. I was so happy to hear that it was him. I had been wanting to talk to him for so long. He was in Mexico City for an entire semester and i had not spoken to him since the summer. Well anyways we talked for a while, then decided to meet up on thursday. After I got off the phone i felt so relieved and so happy to have spoken with him.
    Well on thursday i went to get my hair cut at Toni and Guy with by my stylist Valery. I got all my hair cut off three inches were cut. While she was cutting my hiar her breast were pushing against the backof my head, and she wispered in my ear that she was only doing it cus i'm gay. I busted out laughing so looud and everyone T&G looked at me. Oh and before i evensatdown to get my hiar cut, i spilt my drink all over the floor in the lobby. After my apt i met up with Dale at epic, and we ate lunch. The entire time i was there with him was so nice. I was so glad to see him. He looked really good, and he seamd to be happy to see my also. We talked about many things, and he complimented me on how i looked many times. I was telling him about the art opening at jay internship ""MOCA"" he was interested and want to go, so i invited him to go with me on Saturday. After lunch we hung out for a litte while longer and walked up 4TH Ave.  I had to leave soon after becaue work was near. He walked me to the car and kissed my cheek, hugged me and said his goodbyes.
   On Saturday Jay Manny Ryan and I drove down to mexico for the afternoon. On the car ride there we smoked most of the pot that i brought, out of Ryan's pipe. When we got to mexico we all walked aroudn the streets of Nogales and then found a cute resturant to eat lunch at. Our tabel was right next to a water fountain in this garden type setting. I ordered the tamale plate. It was really good and the XX was so good also.  We stopped at the candy store and bought some shit, and i also bought a carton of ciggs.  After that we left nogales because jay had to get ready for his art opening. Manny drove to the opening and we had to stop by Dale's house and pick him up. When arrived at MOCA the place was alive there were many people there. I interdouced Dale to all of my friends that were there. Then when i was out side this girl came up to me that worked with Jay and began to talk to me. I introduced her to dale also. And the reply to being introduce to him was "" OH YOUR THE BOY THAT BROKE BLAKE'S HEART"" OMG I cant believe that fuckinggirl said that right there infront of him.  I was so embarressed, and i was pissed at Jay becaue he was talking to some girl that i hardly know about my personal life.  Anyways the opening went well, Dale came back to my house along with some of my  other friends. Dale invited his cousin over also, along with some  of her friends. We were hanging out at my house for a while and everyone felt like going out and dancing. We decided to go to IBT""s. All who had fake id's were able to get in. The club was alof of fun with Dale. He bought alof of drinks, this one shot in picticular called abuttery nipple. it was hella good. So after the club we all went back to my house and hung out for a while longer. Everyone left except for my roommates and Dale about 2am. Dale stayed the night, and the night was amazing, i had longed and forgotten what  it was like to sleep with Dale. but once we crawled into bed together it was if it was regular we were aperfect match in bed and we were able to sleep together so comfortably. 
   In the morning Dale wanted to go to breakfast before i day to go to work. We got up around 9 and left the house around 930. We went down to Cafe Pariso. It was pretty packed but there was a table available for us. The food was good, and Dale and i talked about the previous night. I dropped Dale off at home and then went to work. Work sucked, i had to be there for 6 hour, and i did nothing but talked to alumni and got high the entire time. after work i went over to Dale's house and he was asleep, so i crawled into bed with him and fell asleep. we woke up at 8pm and he was going to prepare dinner. He made this Indian soup but it was not good,  and i didnt want to eat it, I made this weird face when i put it in my mouth and Dale was like you dont like it. and i didnt so i had to tell him. He was not mad, i told him that white boys cant smoke Indian food (hehe) So he made a salad. It was pretty good he used all fresh vegtables. We watched TV while ate our salad. After dinner we went back to his room and laid in his bed for a while, until it was time for me to leave.  I left and went  home and went to bed. 
Im so happy right now, im so glad that i have Dale back in my life and everything is going well.

Blake: So how have the boys been treating you? 
Curtis: Oh you dont know? 
Blake: know what? 
Curtis: Im dating Anthony your ex.... You didnt know? 
 So the bastard known as Anthony Reed my ex dumped me for a boy who looks like a bird. I never got the phone call on new years because he was with bird boy Curtis. The little bitch was to afraid to tell me so he just ignored me what a big man. BOYS ARE FUCKING COWARDS AND CHEATS!!!!! I dont understand...... IM not ugly i dont treat guys like shit im not controlling over obsessive rude uncaring. But yet everytime I am left cheated on or just ignored. I talked to Stephen tonight after I found out about Anthony and he told me not to let it get to me and im not. Im not going to be the new typical me and get all pouty over it and go into a depression.  He told me that this is going to keep happening because of one reason. I date guys that act the same as Dale he says and until I stop that im going to keep getting hurt. I read my past journal comments and they were exactly as I suspected. I already know what my friends think about Dale and I knew that they would write stuff like ""i need to get over him"" im better than him"" "" i need to move on"" oh and that I have changed since he has been back and that my friends want the old me back the whore me..... when I was a whore everyone talked SHIT because of what I did but know they want that back because I was more fun back then. COME ON WHAT DO YOU PEOPLE WANT FROM ME???? what is the whore me?? I was sad..  I hooked up with guys to use them to get some sort of unachievable pleasure I slacked in school drank way too much beer partyed all the time and wasted almost a year and a half of my life. I like my change thats in effect now. I mean okay so I have not been the happiest of people rihgt now but I have my shit together. I party moderately I get the shit that I need to get done I dont hook up with random guys and im not wasting my life away. I Feel that I have achieved some comfortability with myself but not fully im still a weak person. I want a BOYFRIEND.... someone that I can spend the day with and not have one moment of dullness....... pure love and happiness. But I know that is not  achievable  until I reach happiness with my self. Hopefully that will be sometime soon.

"event","Last night was crazy.... we started off by going saki bombing at Courtny's work. I had some Saki Bombs also 151 and cola. The whole goup was there and the hippies joined also. Oh and James came out with us also. The night was going well everyone was having fun together. After we left May flower jay manny ryan james stephen robert jamie and I went back to my house to hang out. stephen stoped at the store and picked up some liquor before he came over. We loaded up the huka and smoked it while we drank. once we finshed smokeing the huka i wanted to go out to a club and everyone else agreed. Ryan and jamie could not go because they were not 21 and i had my fake iID so i was in the clear. Robert drove us and 5 other people had to fit in his small two door bronco. james and i rode in the very back where you put your shit. It was crowed but we made it IBTS alright. James was kinda weirded out at first because he was a straight guy going to a gay club. So while we were at the gay club i ran into my old supervisor clint's girlfreind. I had like 4 rasberry stolies while i was there. and Jay hit a brand new drink out of mannys had. I danced some and socialized with my friends. there were not that many cute boys there. We left the club a little before 1am. it was a cramped ride back also. when we got home ryan was there with jenny her brother mike and this stupid bitch Mckyla. It didnt register to me for a while that the Mckyla girl was the stupid bitch that ryan jenny and stephen got into a fight with when we were in nogales. So i really dont understand why she was at our house. Well anyways so i dont know what was going on with jenny but she was like This is the girl that ripped stephen's necklace off. AND SHE SAID IT RIGHT IN FRONT OF STEPHEN!!! WHAT!! WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? so anyways stephen flipped out and got really upset and started to go crazy. he said that he wanted her out of my house right away. i granted his request and i got her out of my house as soon as i could. and while i was doing all this he was throwing a temper tantrum out side of our house.  Sorry but we dont throw fits in front of our house.  he went as far as throwing a shot glass in the road. but whatever . So when Mckyla was leaving stephen started to tripp out more and walked off saying "" im going to my mothers"" his mom lives like 1-2 miles away so he prob could have made it. well actually i dont know he was pretty drunk. everyone was freaking out and i made ryan give me his car keys so i could go and find stephen. i found him the first time just past the stop light and i went and parked infront of where he was walking. and he fled and started to run the opposite way into a parking lot. I drove into the parking lot and got out of the car and started to call for him and tried to talk to him but all i got was ""fuck you Steven"".  so i went up to his partents house and tired to get them up but i knocked for a few minutes and no one answered . I contuined to look around for him by myself. I kept on calling stephen also and i finally got ahold of him but he cussed me out and told me that his mom was comming to pick him up. I decided to drive back to stephens parents house. and i saw george driving down the road. i stopped practically infront of him to get his attention. he told me to follow him  and i did. we found stephen and i tried to talk to him but all i got was ""fuck you"" again andhe got in his dads car. I was pissed and spead off. when the light turned green for me to turn i did and the right tire blew out. i had to drive down the road a bit to park in the parking lot. it sucked cus i was right next to my house too. i called jay and he had ryan and robert come to my need. i didnt have any shoes on and it was raining out side and i parked in a puddle. my feet were soaking wet and cold and i was changing a tire. So anyways. when i got back home everyone was gone except my roomies. i jsut sat in my room for the rest of the night and got high until 5 am..

The dreaded day of graduation . i got there around 5 because we had to be there early for group pictures. but the guy did not end up showing up until 15 minutes before the cermony. So I hung out with Faith ( I was surprised she graduated with me? until we had to take the group photos. This FAG named angel was graduating with my class and I had never even seen him at Presidio.  So yeah after this group picture we had to line up in alphabetical order to walk up frot. The cermony when on and I really did not have any interest to what was going on. Then it was time to announce the scholarship winner. That was the only reason for me attending this stupid graduation. I wanted to win that scholarship so bad. My stomach was hurting when they were talking about the winner. I thought that I was going to win it but then I hear Jamica Stevenson...... Thats not me.  I did not win the scholarship. I was so pissed I wanted to get up and walk out of the graduation. but whatever i just waited until my name was call to recieve my diploma.  All of the students had to prepare a speech to give. But Me I didnt know that I never pay attention. SO when I went up there I told them that I did not prepare a speech and Just wanted to thank my teacher Mrs. White but my voice got all choppy I couldnt even talk. I was embarressed but I dont care.  I couldn't wait to leave the stupid graduation once all the names were read off. When we were able to leave. I grabbed my dad and we took a few pictures and then left.

"event","So I went out to lunch with Courtney today. We went to the resturant Rusty's right down the raod from my house. It was pretty good I liked it. Work was from 4 to 7 today and I did jack shit as uaual. I raised a little bit of money and the sat on my ass. Tonight was Robert's (Stephen's boyfriend) birthday dinner at Sakura. Jay Manny Stephen Robert and I got to Sakura a little early. So we decided to have a drink in the lounge. So we sat down and our waitress came over and took our orders. Luckily My fake ID worked there or else I would have been screwed. Once our Table was ready we brought our drinks over to the table in the dining area and sat down. Our waiter was cute well at least I thought he was. He took our order and brought us back the Saki that we requested. The Saki was Warmed up and it tasted really good with the cold beer. SO after our order was taken our Chef came to our table and cooked up our food. I order the Vegtable plate (I wasn't in the mood for meat) and the chef was picking on me and saying ""oh I'm a vegeterian"" ( in a Japineese accent) and like throwing his boudy around like he was gay. It sounded like I was watching an Anamie Movie. We did a few toasts to our chef and ate our food. OMG there was this busser there that I went to school with and I thought that he was going to rat me out!!!
 All five of us left Sakura and drove down to Puff N Stuff to buy our Huka. The car ride down was so cramped I had to lean forward to even sit down. While we were at the smoke shop I saw a Bad ass cheap pipe there and bought it. Its pretty tight it has a spiral down the middle and like tubes on the sides. It reminds me of the Mario Brothers when they travel through the pipes. When we got home we broke out the pipe right away and put the huka together. Sara came over and we all got pretty high and smoked the huka. It was good times I had fun. Well I'm off to bed now. 
Late!

I looked forward to seeing him today but then I got the call.... (everyone knows what the call is)""Hey Blake! its Matt Sorry but I can't come over tonight."" I felt kinda shitty after he told me. But what can I do? I mean he cant even admit that he's gay........It wont ruin my mood.

In other news.....
 So For the past two nights I haven't smoked and I have had really bad insomnia. I've been staying up really late. I thinks its because I have lack of THC in my body. I had to get up early today at 8 am. Seeing as I dont get up until 10 am. I had to turn in this Scholar ship essay to my high school by 9am. I made it there on time. but I did not look my best. I got back home around 8:45am and I went back to sleep. I woke up at 1:30 pm which was shitty because I wanted to spend time in my house before I had to go to work at the P.O.T. at 2:30pm. so I just took a shower and left for work.
 Work was boring today I raised a total of 1000 dollars from 2:30pm to 9pm. Which is pretty shitty. Our Bad Ass Supervisor Jamison came back to work this week and it was good times. I talked to Desiree today about Matt comming over now I cant wait to see what she says when I tell her what happened.

I finally got mota so im smokin.. I'm gonna have a good nite sleep tonight!!

 I recently graduated from high school, i graduated a semester early so i'm pretty stoked. I just moved into my new house with three of my best friends. its going pretty well, lets hope it continues that way. Its the beginning of 2004 and there are tons of new options out there.

time to vent.....
 So I have been here in Tucson doing nothing for the past year, I feel as if I have not accomplished much. The gay life, the gay people, and the gay scene suck, along with the rest of Tucson. I ask my self often why do I live here in this hell hole, but I can never come up with an answer. I sit here as if i am waiting for something or someone but the opportunity never arises, there is nothing beneficial from living in Tucson and let me tell you girls, gay guys are the same exact way as straight men. I've dated many people, and all I can say is that boys suck. I dont understand them... they're shady, assholes, rude, inconsiderate, and un-caring oh and they dont give a fuck. I've been fucked over twice recently. they just stop calling, it seams to be a trend or something..... I dont know

 Well that was my first entry, now just hang on for the ride to come.

I haven't worked int over a month, I have no urge to be social, and I have let my house turn to shit  (Sorry Nick). I have put in alittle over 10 job applications to everythign from B&N, chile's, and a few day cares (Kids are refreshing and pure). Not even a call back! EB lied to me, saying that they would hire me pretty much on the spot, so I sat on that for 2 weeks as they continued to drag me along.  Ok thats enough bitching I feel slightly better, good bye LJ."

"event","Well, sometimes when you feel like you have fucked up everything in your life, someone can pick you up in the oddest way. Tonight, this odd pickup came from Kevin King, 1 of the few people that have been at the Oasis longer then me. He actually said he could be more like me because I dont let things build, I have been known to have a short temper within the groups, but at the Oasis it is turning into my identity. Tongiht he told me that I have made more then 1 girl cry, and I felt so bad at first but then he said the oddest thing, "" I wish I could do that"". He says that I am known for being a great worker that you dont want to fuck up around because I will rip you a new asshole. Does that mean I have respect and am feared by my fellow workers? I know that the Dr. Cox to my JD is starting to warm up to me, which makes me feel alot better about myself (Shove it, the guy realy does remind me to Dr. Cox.). More when I care enough to update"

Well last week I for the 1st time in a long time and kicked alot of ass. Well tonight would not be a repeat... I love the whole ""..."" thing.

60 bucks later and I am really kicking myself, usually I lose 60 in about 5 hours of playing. Not tonight, no tonight I did it at he break neck speed of under 2 hours. Fuck that was dumb I am trying to get myself a new computer, and I just put myself $60 further away from that goal. I have decided that I will wait till the summer for the computer. I will be putting the money into my mom's account for the large sum of money I still owe her, paying my bills before they come due, and most likely a bunch of stupid dates.

I have not posted in a long time just because I just didn't care to. The people that read this are the people that I talk to at least 5 times a week. Whatever happened to the old days when we had an army sitting at he wall chatting it up and everyone was talking to everyone. I went to the dining hall with Nick a few days ago and walked passt people I used to talk to a year ago with maybe a head nod or that cheesey ""Hi, how are you"" but you dont wait for the person's answer. Fuck it, I guess it just shows that school is school and at the end of the 4 years you dont keep many of those friends.

Does that make me and Brian just fucking weird? I have been friends with the kid since we were in the 5th grade, we spent weekends upon weekends hanging out with each other. Now we are getting older, and what do we do? Hang out whenever we can and talk about the 1st thing that comes into our heads. Never a doubt that the other one will look over and be like ""What the fuck are you thinking?!""... well nevermind that does happen but no crosses get pulled out or that crazy shit.

I just checked out Brians costume idea, and it is making me wonder how I could do the whole plastic man thing... I will have to wear red briefs to pull it off, just a warning. I guess I could try going for something lamer... like a clown. I always wanted dress up as one actually, because when was the last time you saw a good clown? Or what about a stripper? I have a month to workout and tan. But once again, another idea I would have to wear black briefs to pull off... well I guess the girls could always pull them off for me, damn that was lame.

BUt something that he brought up to my attention was that the FDNY is preparing the next class, and I am in the clear to sign up. That would be so much better for me just sitting on my ass. A few of the real benifits would be things like, making 80 grand after 5 years, if I didn't even go for a promotion. If I decided to jump for promotions over 100k in the 5 years. The cost of living is higher, but nnot that much higher.

Also I will bringing a friend along with my to the comedy show, good old Con. A girl that I have had almost the same amount of mixed feelings as with D... ok scratch that. Thats like comparing a crap from me to a crap from Jamie. I am trying to get back into something of a normal life, kinda the idea of new home new me. I have lived on Armas for over a year, and it is a little scary to think about at times. I have changed in alot of ways and I had some great times there too. BUt it is over now and I must be moving on.

Going to my 1st big comedy show this Tuesday with Brian. I am planning on the Chappelle show to crap on the Michael Mack ending. IF not, oh I want my freaking 70 bucks back. That would be a few lines of coke, a bottle of rum and... maybe a pet hamster? Those items combined would have to amount to the same amount of total laughter (I dont know how long coke stays in your system, so I might be running off a ton of rum, and hamster are just so cute).

I also hate indenting paragraphs. Last night I calling it St. Father's Day about 9 times. Why would I confuse such a simple thing, it is 2 words, that I just need to say in order. It's not even a new word for the day, like Easter or Christmas.

But I am starting to look towards the future and I am actually saying fuck the pride, I am going to get back with the help of the person I hate more then almost anyone else... my mother. Yeah I am moving back home after being out for a year, I fucking hate it too. I will be on the other side of the house like i was before I moved out, which will be nice to keep a certain amount of freedom. I also had the balls to go up to my boss and flat out tell him I want my old job back or a leave, turns out I didn't need to say any of that, I was offered it back to me before I had a chance to say a word.

I am not even going to try and play the dating scene right now either, because it seems like I might not be in the right state of mind. I was supposed to go on a great weekend trip last weekend, but right before i was going to leave, I got hit with money issues, and a weird feeling. I haven't bothered with real feelings with someone since Mary, and I ended up blowing that chance because of the bit of cancer that is still in my heart(Fuck you D, you aren't going to beat me). This time I have those feelings and I am kinda scared by it, because I dont want to end up fucking up again. I could keep rambling but I dont know what it would actually fix, or even if the venting would help.

Brian won for the 6th week in a row, and I am pumped up for him in a huge way.

I regret to inform that I am actually moving back home, I am not a happy camper about it either, but what can I do about it. I will be moving out of the house at the end of the month, but oh well. At 1st I felt bad about leaving mike out in the cold, but he is a big boy, he will be fine. I am hoping to live there for a few months and get back on my feet, you know, save some cash, start looking into schools again... blah blah blah. Fuck it, shit happens and you just need to move on.

Speaking of which, I have been D free for about 4 months now, might not sound huge but if you think that, you dont know me well enough. I dont know why that has been such an on going fight for me, well I know but I dont understand. Part of that is because of 1 girl that reminds me of what a good friendship should be like.

Hmmm what else, oh yes Brian is doing his show thingy, and kicking some major ass (the option to kick that 1 guy's ass is still open). I'm happy for Brian that he is winning, I am proud that he is not falling back on the same old shit every week just to make sure he is a shoe in. Grrrr come on Brian, let me break his hip.

Oh I will be leaving town late thurday now instead of around 5ish. I started to say something about leaving before Brian's show, and the next thing I know Roan is staring at me like a pair of shoes that he is  about to put his feet in. I dont know how many of you have checked his nails lately, but those are enough of a reason to rethink my battle plan.

I now know why my spelling is laughable on this damn thing, because I dont care if you can read it. This is supposed to be a way to get everything out of your head that has been sitting there for a few weeks, or hours if your some people. Well I am going to fall back sleep for alittle...

"event","Wow, about an hour ago I was the lowest form of life out there, some whiney ass little kid who didn't know how to get over his shit. I was freaking out over 10 different things that are just small problems once I reall start to pick them apart and notice I can beat any of that bull shit in a hurry.

okok Denise will always fuck me over no matter how macho I try and act, thatsa given. Con, shouldn't mean shit to me, because she has proven tha I dont mean shit to her. I have no money what so ever to my name... meh, I will just have to start acting like everyone else and actually watch what I  spend. That giant bag of bullshit I am dealing with over at the Oasis, fuck that fat bitch, I will say it to her face again... and not care who hears it. SHe will be there in 3 years and I will be happy and making a fuck ton more then her, and be loving my job. 

SOrry for freaking out on a few people, they know who they are, I just lost it. I am usually the one who buckles down and pushes through all of the bullshit, but sometimes I kinda hit that point where I just cant do it anymore. 

Well I just took a couple of sleeping pills because for some reason I haven't slept soundly without them for awhile now. I am going to wake up in the morning talk to Gregg about all the bullshit, hang out with Nate for lunch, and go to work. I am not going to even bother with what happens after work she will most likely back out again and I will be left there looking like a fool if I actually plan on seeing her. Seems like I havea few bitches that are just killing me right now, i dont care though... god works in weird ways.


PS: I love cock."

I swear I am going to spend V-day with her, I couldn't take that time of stress. I am starting to think I might just go to a far away town for a 4 day escape.

"event","okok so I haven't posted in a long time but thats because my house is mighty gay and it is pretty much cuddling with Jason in the gayness because I cannot post anything from there. Nates birthday rocked, Bill's birthday rocked... drinking nonstop rocked untill I broke my toe. I then decided to go drinking 2 days later and hit the same toe, and now it looks like I am turning into a zombie from the toe up. ON the flip side I now can work in flip flops everyday until it turns back into normal colors.

Tonight's only amazing moment is that someone called Hutto's phone and said that he is going to get a bunch of people together to kick Hutto's ass... OH COME ON! No one actually does that shit in real life, if you want to beat the shit out of someone you just do it. Phone calls are the most tell-tale sign that you do not actually have enough nuts to fight the person. Who knows, these guys might be different, and I think it would be kinda funny to see a full blown war between this guys gang of tards and our gang of fatter tards. We would so win... unless some how they catch Hutto by himself, and then we would all have to visit him in the cemetary... Irish Wake anyone?

Hmm... nothing else seems to be exciting enough to put on the online world. I am now working at a pizza place untill I find a better job... I just want to find that before friday, when the owner gets back. So if you know a place that is hiring and would be worth my time working there, you should give me a holla.

Also Denise has agreed to V-Day but now she seems to be looking for a loop hole to once again fuck me over... why do I do this to myself. I know! I love pain and it's name starts with D. I miss all the people that used to be family. I also would like to thank Kat for the update about March 14th, I just need to find someone for that day."

Constance is moving to NY, so that will make thing easier to deal with. I was fired from Oasis last week... can you say WTF! I dont care as much as I thought I would though, no matter how cool those people were to work with, they are just a different chapter. I am going to Panama Hatties at some point this week to get a job there. I delivered a Pizza there and one of the manigers knew me from Oasis, and the almost begged me to work for him. YOu know how good it feels to have a business say that they need you? It feels great!

Right now I found the otherside and I am damn happy with it, if I don't want to I dont have to work for 3 weeks, damn that feels great to say (or right which ever). Hopefully a party will be in order sometime rather shortly either where all the guys get together and we just chill with the girl friends. I hope Nate will be able to bring his, she is damn cool. Well time to play games with people.

So I kinda found a kink in all the good that has been going on lately, sh is leaving for UNF once the dorms open up. I dont care things should be ok even with the piece of bad news.

I am no happy with the change, I feel like back then I was on top of everything, while now I am starting to turn into a bum. I feel like all the thigns that gave my... I dont want to say life but it seems like the only word to describe it, well whatever the word should be, the worth is gone.

       I feel very alone right now, and it has effect everything I do. I have my friends, but I want more right now. I seem to be looking in all the wrong spots though. I found a person that seems to have all the things I like in a girl, all except that spark from her side. I seem to be the chump who got played this time. I really want to treat someone like a queen, but I burnt my bridges with the best girl I ever had, and I cant find anyone else that I get that click with. 

       I hate these posts, they are just someone crying about shit that they can fix, but are just too weak to get it done. Fuck it, maybe it is time for me to realize that I might just be too weak, I am not as strong as I could ever want to be."

"event","Ahh, what a way to party for your 21st. At 12:05am, I was carded for the first time. Went to the Hookah bar and partied there till around 3 went back to the house and partied for another couple of hours. I met Xeetaa (sp?) at the hookah bar and hung with her for the night, that was damn cool. After I fell asleep woke up around 1, chilled out and at 8 headed the old Oasis. They got me crunk! I chilled with m sister and her husband for most of it, that was damn cool, and funny from what I hear.
     I tried to knock JJ down again. And surpise surprise, it didn't happen. I jumped from the top of the stair case at the Oasis all the way to the bottom... and he caught me. You know how funny that is to think about? I leaped from 14 steps and was caught like a child.
     Had my first drink at Jack's, partied some more, and then was driven home, where I kept falling foor hours. I will say that I had a great 21st birthday, I wish I had seen my brothers, but everyone was busy for the most part.

Time for bed, and in the morning I go to work as a 21 year old, woot.

"event","For the first time since skool has started, I am extremely happy and giddy.  I mean, I feel like everything is good and that I have a grip on everything.  I feel like I understand everything.  I am no longer confused.  I got the issue dealing with Jeremy sorted out: We are friends and we are gonna stay like that because our friendship is one of the things that keep me sane here.  If that got outta wack, I would go crazee again.  In addition I am not annoyed by anyone in the hall at the moment.  I am so giddy and happy.  I feel good about myself.  Hopefully I can feel like this for awhile.  Debbie and Jeremy are like ""why r u so giddy and happy?""  Debbie thinks I got laid, which I DIDNT.  These legs stay closed.  My biggest fear is getting pregnant.  That would be such a disappointment to my family and that is the last thing I would ever want to do.  My parents have given up so much for me and given me the world, to do sumthing like that to them is worst them stabbing them in the back.  I love them to much to do sumthing like that.  Anywhoo, like I was saying, I am really happy and content with myself.  I dunno what has gotten into me, but I dont feel confused and outta place anymore.  Before, I only felt like myself around Jeremy and my bro Arjun, but now, I feel like I can be myself with everyone.  Also, I realized that joining Alpha Chi Omega was a really good decision.  At first I was skeptical, but now I am so GLAD that I joined.  I am having so much fun getting to know my sisters and hanging out with them.  Everything is going good.  Oh, today's my daddy's birfday.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY DADDY (even though u dont read this and have any clue about what this is).  I LOVE U!!!!!!!!"

"event","So, I havent been home for like 1 month now.  And I can finally say that I miss home.  I really wanna go home.  I cant wait till this weekend.  It's weird, I guess this whole college dorming thingy is getting to me.  It's hard sumtimes.  I mean I love it here and I love the peeps, but its hard to try to get your point across at moments.  Anywhoo, so fri nite was presents.  I had so much fun.  I got closer to alot of my sisters (soriety).  Presents is when all the sorieties and frats present their new members to the rest of the sorieties and frats.  So many cute frat boys.  OMG.  Anywhoo, theres this one guy who is a Phi Delt.  He's half Mexican and Fillipino with green eyes.  He's so fine.  As of rite now, he's my got to get with guy.  The top on my list.  As for Jeremy aka ""You"" (now u know his name Kerry), well, I finally figured out that we are SO much better as friends.  The more and more time I spend with him, I realize that our friendship is what is best for me.  I wouldnt want anything more then that.  It's weird though, because ever since he found out that I like him, I feel like we've been growing apart.  Even Blanca thinks so.  I mean she says that we havent been hanging out as much.  Anywhoo, as for the guys.  I really want a boyfriend.  Freakin a.....theres so many guys around, but of course I have to be so picky.  As for the #1 guy on my list, he's outta reach, eventhough Paul (dorm mate) knows him.  I like to look, but I will never do anything about it.  Um.........who can I have........or who do I want.   Whateves, I cant really force stuff like that.  My time will come.  I wouldnt mind it being sometime soon though.....REALLY SOON.  Well, off to bed for now.  Bye"

"event","Jeremy pushed me overboard today.  This whole day, I was annoyed by almost everyone.  Whenever sum1 touched me, I felt irritated.  So, seeing that I was annoyed, Jeremy goes ""I hate u Tina.""  See, the thing is, I know he was just messing with me.  But seriously, the word hate is so strong.  I just started balling.  He's like the one person that I actually care for at this skool, and he said he ""hates"" me.  Thats so hard to hear, especially coming from sum1 that I actually trust (I only trust like 1.5 peeps here, and the 1 is Jeremy).  Freakin A.  I've been really outta it lately, not feeling like myself thats why I've been so blah.  I mean, I'm kinda glad he pushed me overboard because now I feel alot better."

"event","So today I was suppose to go home, but I decided not to because I wanted to stay back with my dorm mates.  Not a wise decision.  First off, the first decision I made after deciding to stay at the dorms, made the rest of my nite a tiresome one.  GOSH FREAKIN A I HATE THIS CRAP.  I think I'm PMS-ing.  Maybe I was wrong, maybe I do go through mood swings when I am about go OTR (I got OTR from my cousing Cat :p ) Anywhoo, I've been sitting here and I am kinda annoyed. Its hard being in college because its like, I dont miss home, but I need to get away from the dorm life for awhile.  Where do I go though?  I really dont have anywhere to go."

"event","Just to add to my previous entry...

FAMILY: I think that this whole transition is really hitting home.  I am the first to go to college in my whole entire family and I think that me moving away is hard for them and mee too.  But they have a different way of handling it.  I miss them like mad.  When I am at skool, I miss home, but when I am home, I miss skool.  Crazee stuff.

GUYS: Last nite after typing in my journal, I realized a lot of stuff.  Even though I see a lot of things in ""You"" I want in a boyfriend, my feelings for him are slowly fading.  I mean, its not because I am forcing myself too, or am I?  But I dont feel as strong with my feelings then before.  I guess the truth has suken into my head.  I am cool with it though.  It makes it so much easier.  The one good thing about me when it comes to guys is that, even though I fall for them easily, I can quickly lose interest.  I tell myself sumthing about them that makes me not like them anymore.  Or I pick out every little thing they do that I dont like, and keep that in my head.  It's hard with ""You"" because I dont find that many ""faults"" in him.  Maybe I am not looking hard enough, but I cant find that many.  I know he isnt perfect, no one is, not even me, and I would be the first to admit that, so eventually sumthing will pop out about him that I dont like.  This wont make me not want him as a friend, because that would ruin my year if we werent close anymore, but it would just turn off my feelings of more then friendship for him. 

DORM LIFE: Well, there has been a problem that peeps in my hall have been noticing.  Sum peeps think I have changed, but the thing is, I havent.  I'm still the same ol' Christina, just been very tired.  And the thing that peeps dont know about me is that, when I get tired, I tend to withdraw myself from others.  Its not that there is sumthing wrong, I'm just really tired.  And I guess now the real Christina is kinda coming out, in a way.

SOCIAL LIFE: So like I finally accept and enjoy the fact that I am in a soriety.  ALPHA CHI OMEGA babeeeee.  But the thing is, there are so many stereotypes that come along with this privledge.  I guess the streotypes r hitting me, because peeps are constantly clowning.  It gets to me, but I deal.  I guess I have to get use to it.  I mean, peeps think that me being a soriety girl will change me and stuff, but I will never let that happen.  I would withdraw my membership if that were to happen.  I'm Christina, and if u dont like that then thats too bad.  U get what u see, like it or not.  So, this soriety thing is a good thing for me, not a bad thing.  I hope everyone will be able to see that and be happy for me.

K, I think thats all for now."

"event","I know it's been so long since I've written, but I have so much to say.  Since last time I've written, alot has happened.  COLLEGE has happened.  Anywhoo....

CLASSES: Classes r coolio.  Not too hard, but not hella easy.

DORM LIFE:  Everyone in my hall is so freakin amazing, except for the occasional annoying ones.  I love the peeps and we all click so well together.  We r all tite and have so much fun.

ROOM MATE:  Nythia is my roommate and I am really glad she is.  Its cool, because we dont know each other that well, but its not like we dont know each other at all.  Its like, we dont have to start off on the ""where r u from?"" and explanation of everything phase.  We totally watch each others back.

PEOPLE: I've met so many cool peeps here.  I have a dorm hall mate Arjun that I call my older bro.  He's really helpful when I need advice or sumone to talk to.  Everyone I have met has been really cool and nice.  I randomly say ""hi"" to peeps so that makes it easy for me to meet peeps.  I'm trying to be outgoing and friendly now.  I've met peeps that I know will become really close to me.

GUYS:  There are so many cute guys here.  I guess going to an all girl high school really got to me.  I am boy crasee, just dont do anything about it though.  I like to look, but dont do anything about it.  Hehehehehe.  Anywhoo, theres alot of dorm building staff members that are cute and stuff.  Theres this one really cute senior in my spanish class.  We always pair up when we have partner activities.  He use to be on the basketball team.  And the other day, he invited me to this parteee he was having, but I couldnt go.  He's so freakin fine, but I would never get with him.  It's funny, because there are actually cute asian guys here.  And for those who dont know me, I dont usually go for asian guys.  I think I have lowered my standards a little since everyone around here is asian.  Its cool though. This helps prove rite what Helen constantly says about me...""u r gonna marry an asian guy.""

SOCIAL LIFE:  Um.....I joined a soriety.  I am a new member of Alpha Chi Omega.  It's really cool.  At first I was iffy, but now I am happy with my decision.  I originally withdrew from rushing (the phase where u get to meet all the 6 Greek sorieties on campus and choose which one u want to join), but Alpha Chi still extended me a bid (invitation to join the soriety).  So I guess, if they put all that effort in trying to get me, it means sumthing.  2 other sorieties called me back AFTER Alpha Chi, extending me a bid too.  But, I chose Alpha Chi because they got to me 1st (they called me 1st).  I went to my 1st ""Social"" (events with the frats on campus) last nite with the girls.  We spent the nite with Kappa Alpha, the biggest frat on campus.  Had fun.  Didnt drink, but still had fun.  I dont have to drink to have fun.  Having fun comes naturally to me.  Hehehehehehehe.  Got to met the guys and stuff.  Cool peeps.  Got to hang with the girls and get to know them better.  We have a retreat next weekend.  We shall go camping in the moutains.  SCARY, but coolio.

FAMILY:  It sucks because ever since I started skool, 5 weeks agon, I've only been home for a total of like 20 hours.  I have gone home 2 times and each time I come home late, sleep, and wake up early to come back here.  It sucks.  But, I'm dealing.  I get the same questions over and over again though.....""How's skool, how's the food, etc.""  After awhile, those questions repeated over and over again, make me frusterated.  I feel bad when this happens because I know that they r just trying to see how I am and how college life is treating me.

PERSONAL LIFE:  There are the ocassional break downs.  Once so far. Its like ""I want it to be like old times.""  Sumtimes its just hard because no one really knows the real Christina yet and I just feel lonely or just feel like I need to get out for a little while.  It's normal though.  Everyone who live in the dorms go through it.

LOVE LIFE: So i've met this one guy named ""YOU."" I've never met a guy that I clicked with so much.  I mean, I can talk to him about God and stuff.  I go to him when I need to talk and vice versa.  We joke around and have so much fun.  I can tell him anything and its like he doesnt judge me or anything.  WE TOTALLY CLICK!!!!!!!!  But, yes there is a but, he is in a ""love triangle.""  He has a girlfriend, but still has feelings for another girl.  It's really complicated.  But thats the bottom line.  Nothing will happen with us.  Just friends, hopefully really close friends.  Thats better then nothing.  I would rather have him as a friend then not have him in my life at all.  He has kept me sane and in tack since we've gotten here.  We always kick it together and stuff.  He's a GREAT guy, and any girl that gets with him is ""Hella"" lucky.  I've never met a guy like him.  It's weird because I tell myself, when I'm around him, that I dont have feelings for him like that, but when he isnt around, is when I do get those feelings for him.  It's weird.  I mean, I like him more then friends when I miss him.  We flirt, but I dont think either one of us knows it.  I only trust like 2 peeps at this skool, Arjun and ""You.""  Those r the 2 peeps I trust to drive my car, and that means alot.  If u dont know me by now, I dont ever let anyone drive my car.  Anywhooooo, there are things he does for me that no other guy has ever done.  When he is not around I miss him like mad.  Never missed a guy before (Brian....R.I.P....doesnt count).  There are so many things about him that I adore and wish for in a boyfriend, but I know that that wont be.

Anywhoo, that is all for now. I will enter more in next time."

"event","K, so let me tell u about yesterday.  Yesterday.....didnt do anything in the afternoon except sleep and pick up my bro.  At 7am I was off to LMU to visit Max and go to Tin's Kuya's frat parteee.Oh no!!!! My first frat partee.  Let me tell u, the guys were extremely nice and sum were actually cute :).  Makes me take back my ""i'll never date an marry an asian"" speeches.  We ended up going to like 5 different houses.  The partees would get broken in matter of minutes.  I think the record time that we got kicked out was like 5 seconds.  Seriously.  Kuya was the designated driver and out ""counselor"" so it was coolio, he took us to the spots and stuff.  I had a GREAT TIME.  So much fun and so many fine and funny ass guy.  This one guy Chris, LMU freshman, Hawaiian was high the whole nite and that was an ish watching him.  Hes soooooooooooooooo cute.  Personality and looks wise.  Anywhoo, lots of older guys, but they were all coolio.  Didnt want to take advantage of us, well except for one who tried to get his mack on with Max, but that didnt happen.  Ewwwwwww!!!!  Yeah, so I had a grip load of fun thanks to Kuya Michael.  He took care of me and Max the whole time, watched our backs and made sure we were home safely.  I wish I had an older brother like him.  TIN U R SO LUCKY!!!!!! (wish u were there with us though ;).....miss u like mad).  Welp, we didnt get to sleep until like 6am (so we were out from 9:30pm-6am,) well me at least and I slept for like 4 hours.  That was great.  Went home, shopped for skool and now I am here sharing this lovely story with u.  :)"

"event","So lately, my mom has been very frustrated at my grandma and shes taking it out on my dad.  So, for once in his life, my dad stands up to her and is like ""if i'm bugging u, u have to tell me so i can change it and make it better.""  No reply from mom....then he adds ""i dont want Tina leaving this house like this.  u and your mom r fiting and u r taking it on me, causing more ruckus.""  She storms out of the house to go to my bros back to skool nite.  He comes up to me and is like ""i told her to put enough in the bank for u for 4 yrs of skool, u have to do well, u hear me,"" ""whatever dad, leave me alone, dont do this to me(in a frustrated tone), I dont wanna hear this now.""  And he leaves me alone. Then he goes to my bro and is like ""how would u like it if i moved out and u lived with your mom. i will come and visit u on weekends."" For all that i can remember, whenever my parents would get into BIG fites, they would have to be BIG, he would threaten to leave.  Its like, IF U WANNA LEAVE THEN LEAVE.  Dont ask.  If u really hated the situation u r in, then y dont u leave it.  The truth is, he would never leave.  He loves me, my bro and my mom too much.  Thats the only way he can make us scared.  So finally, I couldnt take it anymore so I was like ""I'm leaving, I'll call mom later and tell her where I am, Bye.""  He was like ""Where r u going, what time r u coming home, dont stay out late, its dangerous, u r a girl, be careful"" and I respond with ""Gosh, I'm leaving for college next week, u cant do this to me anymore!"" and I drove off.  Yeah I feel bad, but he knows I'm rite.  I am leaving next week, and I will be out without them knowing about it.  I'm an adult now, they have to understand that I can make my own decisions now and stuff.  I guess u can blame it on the whole seperation factor of me moving out, but still.  I mean, hes really trying to make my last week at home a good one.  Hes the one whos collecting info on buying my labtop and cell phone and stuff.  More then me.  I love him so much, but its time to let his little girl go.  Its time for me to experience my individuality.

So today, like last nite, Myra and I visited peeps at LMU.  Pretty cool ish.  Met new peeps.  Got a feel of dorm life from the eyes of my friends.  Met HOT guys....i.e Mel's roomate Hank from Colorado.  It was fun.  Just makes me more excited about skool and stuff.  But just one more week.

Myra leaves tomorrow so thats y I spent the last couple of days with her.  Its been fun, but now we part our seperate ways.  We hopefully shall KIT.  I'll miss that ""bitch.""

Tomorrow I shall be attending my 1st ever college partee.  Sum frat partee Max invited me too.  Its Tin's kuya's frat.  It sould b fun.  Michael (tin's kuya) will be the designated driver even though I wont b doing anything bad.  Spending the nite at Max's dorm.

Today I was really emotional.  Cried as I watched the news about the terrorist attacks.  IT really gets to me how there r so many peeps hurting and stuff.  Makes me miss Brian."

And another thing, peeps keep on saying how they have never felt so much pride in being an American citizen, well, I totally agree.  For sum reason, I've been feeling like that.  I feel proud and privledge to be apart of this country, and it hurts me knowing that I cant do anything to help, but just sit back and watch.  I dunno."

The 1st thing that popped into my head was ""OMG, my cousin lives in NY n goes to NYU...freakin A I hope he's ok.""  SO, after watching the news for like 2 secs, I sign on to see if my cousin was on too, and THANK GOD he was.  He told me what had happened with him.  ""By the time I woke up, the 1st tower was already hit, so i went outside to walk down this street with a really clear view of the twin towers and all of a sudden it collapsed.  Everyone around me, about 500 peeps, stopped dead in their tracks and started crying, including me.""  WTF...this is is so damn scary.  What can u think at a time like this.  There r so many things that r being passed around:  1) todays date is 911 2)if u add up the numbers in each flight that crashed, seperately, they equal the days to come 3) today is the same day the peace agreement was signed between the US and the middle east (i think its the middle east).  Just little stuff like that is weird.  What else do I have to say, except this ish is scary and it makes me nervous.  Freakin A.....I mean, even though we r not in NY, every US citizen has to feel this impact some way or another.  This has affected history as we know it.  we never think about this kinda stuff, or never think that it could happen.  Well now we know that it can.  All i have to say is ""what goes around comes around""  Its just one big cycle...the US did this to some other country, and now they r doing it to us and it will just keep on going back and forth.  Does this mean WAR?  I dunno what it freakin means.  It means sumthing though.  I mean, for all i know, sumthing can happen any minute now.  GOSH!!!!!! I really hate this stuff.  I'm kinda scared just to be at home. ""Pearl Harbor 2"" they say....or even ""WWIII"" maybe.  WTF...these comments dont help me at all.  But I dunno.  Theres so much to say rite now, but I dont know what to say.

I'm really excited.  This whole soriety thingy is really getting to me.  I cant wait for rush to begin.  What else....went skool shopping again with my aunt this time tough.  Got a trunk to lock up my valuables in my dorm.  Got some new pants from Tar-jay (aka target).  I need pants. i have lots of shirts, but not that many pants.  Its weird that i wont be wearing uniforms to skool anymore.  Anywhoo, I am tired, so i'm typing nonsense.  Oh, today, my dad was pissing me off like ther was no tomorrow.  He is so freaking protective of my brother.  protective is not the word, overly cautious when it comes to my bro.  He's always like ""i wonder if he has had enought to eat?""  The boy is freakin OVER weight, of course he has had enough to eat.  He can afford not eating for like a month.  And then, in addition to that, he's like....""gosh, as Christopher grows, the weight doesnt leave him"".....of course its not leaving him....u r worrying if he has enough to eat all the damn time.  Another thing, today, my bro needed to cover his books but it was past his bed time and stuff and my dad was like ""y dont u just cover his book, he looks tired and should go to bed"".....WTF!!!!!!!!! he's 10 years old and can do this SHIT on his own, but he's too lazy. So I just went off on my dad and was like ""THe boy is freakin 10 years old and can all the stuff on his own, y r u always doing his stuff for him....u r just making everything worst!!!!!!!!!!! (in my loudest and maddest voice)"" and my dad just shut up and went on like nothing happened because he knew i was rite.  i didnt feel bad for yelling at my dad...i usually do...but not this time.  This time I was rite and my mom even agrees. She was there when it happened and didnt say anything.  Usually when she hears me yelling at dad, she yells at me for yelling at him. I'm so mad and annoyed by the whole situation."

"event","EARTHQWAK!!!!!!! As my mom and I were looking at the cloths on the rack in Macy's at Fox Hills, on the 2nd floor, we feel the damn building move.  At first, we hear the sound of the structure moving, it's just a little shake, then it gets bigger and bigger till it finally stops.  4.2 they say and West LA was the center.  I couldnt stop laughing for sum reason after the quake.   I know, I shouldnt have been, but for sum reason I thought it was funny.  The way peeps didnt care about it and just went on shopping.  Or how the manager of Macy's went around like ""JUST STAY CALM, DONT PANIC"" while everyone just went on with they're business.  It was some funny ish.  I thought that it would have been bigger then a 4.2 but I guess it was because I was on the 2nd floor.  It seems as if a quake is stronger the more higher from the ground u r.

So, nothing new except for the quake.  Acutally, take that back.  I told my parents about the belly piercing I got.  I went into my mom's bathroom while she was putting on make up and said ""Dont get mad,"" lifted up my shirt and showed her.  ""No, No, NO! I dont want u to have it, NO!"" my mom responded.""  ""Sorry mom, but I'm not taking it out....Helen (my younger cuz by a yr.) has one, and its not like a tattoo that is perminant or its not like i'm doing drigs or "" and I left.  After telling my dad, he was a little cooler about it, she comes out and is like, ""u ask after u do it.""  In back of my head I was like....:""I'm not asking, I'm telling.""  I'm 18, moving out soon, whats the worst they can do....ground me for life?   PLEASE...Wahtevs.  Anywhoo, after cooling down a bit, she was like explaining why she doesnt like them and stuff.....""only those who r dirty (like hoes) have them back home (Vietnam)."" Then she was like ""this is gonna lead u to other things"".....""i'm not gonna do that other stuff, trust me""....""fine, u r old enought to understand"" and my dad added ""no more, just that."" So the end of that.  Then we went to the mall where the quake awaited us.

P.s.  THis is what Rice had to say....she sums up my hole view on my piercing...
""it's just a piercing...it's not gonna change ur attitude...they don't kno that we're smarter than that
...just cuz we're into certain trends doesn't mean it's gonna change who we are...c'mon now...we're level-headed individuals."" -Laurice (oohbarracuda)"

"event","My pop and I went to the Vietnamese capital in the US...Santa ana today.  I had a ortho appt for my retainers and he had a doctor and dentist appt.  It was pretty cool.  I drove of course, but the time gave us sum moments to bond.  I liked it.  I usually go out with mum, so i dont kick it with pops a lot.  He always says ""what happened to u, u use to be a daddy's girl""  Daddy got his tooth pulled today and I got to watch the hole thing.  Now i know why i didnt want to become any type of doctor.  GROSS!!!! but very interesting, from a viewers objective.  I got to see everything from the injection of the medication to the pulling itself.  All i have to say is that they pull the teeth back and forth ALL THE WAY till it lets loose.  EWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!, but coolio.  I know...crazee huh?

Anywhooooo, finally got my housing info.  Got everything i wanted.  Rooming with Nythia and in A&I.....PERFECT...very lucky I shall add.  I can already tell that this shall be a very FUN year ahead of me. :) ;)"

"event","So, today outta blue, I decide to get my belly pierced.  This comes after looking at some navel jewlery at the mall.  I dunno what I was thinking.  I'm not suppose to have one because ""they look cheap"" -my mother.  I was gonna wait till I moved out, but no.  I mean what will they do if they find out? They cant really do anything, so whatevs.  But, I called around some places and I finally got it done.  Hehehehe....I felt so sneaky doing it behind my parents back. HAHAHA!!!!! I've never done anything to this degree behind their backs.  I mean yeah I lie to them and stuff, but this is kinda different. Now I hafta hide it from them for a couple weeks till I'm off to college.  I got it done by some guy named Keith at S T Tattoos.  It went by pretty fast.  Inhale, Exhale and u r done.  Pretty cooliol.  I'm not gonna lie to u.  It did kinda hurt. But not that bad where I wanted to cuss at the world or start crying.  Cost me $35 plus $5 tip.  Not that bad, and the hoop is cute i guess.  Welp. Thats all for now.  Am I getting exciting yet?  Hope so.  Welp, i'm off to see a movie with mi amiga Sabreen.  I'll be back though. :)"

"event","So today was MTV's VMA awards.  Went over to Alisa's and watched them with a group of other peeps aswell.  The VMA was aight.  Not that many interesting performances.  Britney was the best, even though I am not that found of her sumtimes.  Liked her new song and outfit.  She had live animals on stage.  Some crazee ish I tell u.  After the show, we went to the Bridge to get caramel apples....I LOVE CARAMEL APPLES, and I realize how sum girls can be very obvious when liking a guy.  I mean, they do things that make them seem desperate to the point where it just makes them look bad.  Like chasing the guy, or just going out of they're way to be next to him.  I guess that's how it is.  I mean, I probably do things like that too, maybe not as obvious, but I do it to.  And now I know how I look when I do it.   
K, next subject.  Lately, I've been feeling kinda life less.  Maybe its because I still have jet lag, or what not.  But I dont think I can blame it on that.  I've been home for a freaking week already.  Anywhoo.  I really dont know what my problem is.  Maybe its because no one is around for me to talk to and kick it with.  Everyone is in skool.  It sucks not being in skool with them.  I sit at home and just bum it.  Whatevs.  I'll get over it eventually. ARG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  And what gets me more frusterated is that my damn skool hasnt sent home any info about my living arrangements.  And I effin need them.  I need to send in some papers to the skool, but cant till I get my housing info.  DAMN IT!  I need to know what they provide so I can buy what they dont.  Gosh..........ARG.............ARG.............."

"event","WARNING: I KNOW MY ENTRIES R SO FREAKING ANNOYINGLY BORING AND WORTHLESS, BUT I PROMISE, ONCE SKOOLS STARTS AND I GET A LIFE, MY ENTRIES WILL GET BETTER.....OR SO I HOPE.

Today was a chill day.  I went to go pick up my bro around 12pm.  Its funny, because this morning my mom reminded me to pick him up, and I almost let time pass me by.  TV does make time fly by....I looked up at the clock and it was 11:30am already.  Damn....I have 15 to take a shower and jet off.  The one thing about me that is not like the typical girl is that I take fast showers. 15mins max.  I'm in and out, none of that relaxing in the shower stuff.  Just get me clean.  So I go pick up my bro, and when he gets into my car, he tries to open my glove compartment, but it was locked.  He tried so hard, the handle broke off.  There goes more money outta my parents pocket.  I would pay for it, but it was my bro's fault.  Trying to show off in front of his friends. Whatevs. Anywhoo, then I went to the bank to transferr sum money to my checking account so that I can go buy sum stuff later.  That took like forever and a day.  There was like 1 teller and 5 peeps in front of me and the line went on after me till the end of day.  I finally reached the teller and do my ish. Then I go to Office Max and Target for sum more skool shopping.  Gosh its sad how skool shopping makes me happy.  I used my new credit card/check card for the 1st time.  I understand how peeps can go crazee with the plastic thingy, but luckily mine isnt a real credit card...its a check card, theres a different.  I've made a pact to myself, that while in college, I shall not get a credit card, unless my mom's name is on it.  That way, I can hide my card, and have my mom build credit for me.  :) Sneaky huh?  I love how I am able to be like ""charge it please"" and flashing my ID for confirmation.  I feel so...adult like.....I feel free from having to ask my parents for money (even though I shall continue to do that with my check card).  Everyone says that driving gives u that freedom, but for me it was using my check card.  I'm such a nerd."

"event","Today was a tiring day.  My mom, bro and I went skool shopping.  Mom spent like $300 on us in like 3 hours ($200 on Chris).  Damn we are expensive.  Well, thats the price they pay for having us. :P  Sumtimes I feel bad.  My mom and dad works their a$$es off for my bro and I to have a good education, but they complain when we spend too much money on school supplies.  Will they make up their minds.  What do they want me to do about it?  Whatevs.  I thought that the hightlite of my day would be skool shopping, but I was wrong.  Today, my coz, Nhat, IMed me.  Talking to him was actually the sunshine in my day.  He's such a coolio person. I really look up to him.  He's a jr. at NYU and he is SO DAMN SMART.  I've never met sumone as smart as he is.  I mean, this guy is naturally smart.  I feel stupid when I'm around him sumtimes and that doesnt happen often.  I'm really proud to call him my coz.  At least one of us is smart cuz I know I'm not.  He can teach me alot.  The one thing that came out of my vaca was the bond i formed with him.  It was great.  Anywho, nothing really to report today. Just chillin like a villian and waiting in anticipation for skool to start already.  GOSH, I WANT TO MOVE OUT NOW!!!!!!"

"event","This past Sunday, Myra took me to the TRL concert.  It was coolio.  Saw a few stars, but none that are BIG.  City High, 3LW, Dream, Eve, Nelly and Destiny's Child performed.  I thought Nelly was the best....I dunno what is was, but his performance was one of the best I have seen.  Anywho, after the show, which was in Irvine, we went to In&Out and I havent been there in like years....well, at least for awhile.  As for today, Tuesday, I shall be going out with mi mama.  Tuesdays r her days off and I take advantage of her on these days.....(i.e. shopping). My parents dont buy me stuff anymore since I got a job, which has been for like 2 yrs., but now I am unemployed, so they have resumed the role of the bank in my life.  So, today, hopefully we will be able to go skool shopping.  Its my bros first day of skool, and usually they send home a ""to buy"" list.  Its sad, because i'm really looking foward to skool shopping.  That must tell u that I have no LIFE.  Everyone is in skool, it seems, and I have no one to kick it with.  Damnit, y couldnt skool start the same time everyone else does.......but no, we have to start like 1 month later.  Whatevs.  And another thing that pisses me off is that my skool (UCR) is so slow at sending out info.  I mean, i dont know where i am living, who i am dorming with, when i move in and all the other important dates.  I havent even gotten my skool ID yet.  So when i go to the movie theaters, i still have to flash my NDA (high skool) ID to get a student discount.  Gosh.  What else do i have to complaim about........Oh yeah, and my parents, they bug.  I know all parents do it, but lately it's like, stop telling me what to do.....i'm going to college and i have to learn on my own.  My mom is like ""clean your room, your grandma is gonna visit and she is staying in your room""   I ALREADY KNOW THIS.  I'm 18, I know what i have to do and i'll get it done on my own time....they dont understand that.  My parents rarely nag me, but when they do, it really bugs.  They always make me do things for them though, because they think they cant do it themselves.  What r they gonna do when i am gone?  Whatevs....now i'm off to drive my mom (ever since i got my liscense, i drive my parents everywhere, they r too tired of driving themselves i guess) to the uniform place to buy my bro new skool uniforms...he's always gaining weight and needs new uniforms every year...plus he's a boy, n boys cant keep clean."

I love fast cars! then i went to Rices partee.  It was fun. I had to make a speech that i knew nothing about.  Glad i took that impromptu speaking class with mrs. jardine. hehehehe.  most of all mi amigos was at the partee so i was happy i got to see all my friends on me birfday.  it suxed though because one of my friends, who shall remain nameless, didnt even come up to me to say ""hi"" or ""happy b-day"" and we were in each other's presence for like 4 hours.  she knew it was my birfday too. everyone knew, thanks to rice ;).  i mean that was so  heartless of her, i was really pissed off. but she is that type of person.  whatevs.  the next day i went skydiving with kerry.  that is the craziest thing i have ever done.  THANK YOU KERRY for introducing me to the expensive hobby.  the weekend after was Brians 1 yr. I really miss that boy. I cant believe its been a yr without him.  i love him soo much and miss him more.  i dont know, it sucks.  losing a love one really hurts, and he was only 8.  thats another story for another day. anyways to a briter note....my bestest bud Melvin got me tickets to the teen choice awards and VIP backstage passes.  it was so fun.  i've been to many concerts and gotten lots of hook ups but this is the bestest one ever.  Jorge, his cousing, vania (jorge's best bud) me mel and mel's bro eric went.  it was so fun.  met joey and lance from n'sync again, mya, pam anderson, ummmm....destiny's child, left eye, sisqo, tyrese, the rest of nsync, nick and aaron carter.....so many more....went backstage and hung out with the stars and everything....it was a once and a life time experience, thanks to mel and aunt debbie.  then the following tues. i was off to jesey, new york and belgium.  went to jersey to visit my dad's bro and his family, very boring state.  my cousin nhat was my official tour guide for NY.  he goes to NYU, very SMART guy. we trained it to NY from NJ everyday.  saw all of the tourist attractions in NY.  Gosh i felt like a tourist, didnt like that feeling at all.  anywhooo....we way beauty and the beast. it was really good.  i fealt bad for the little boy in front of us though, his dad kept on falling asleep and SNORING ( i thought it was my dad, but thank goodness it wasnt).  So NY was soooo much fun thanks to Nhat. we really bonded.  i think he is such a coolio guy. i really do respect him (most of the time). hehehehe. belgium was coolio too, mostly shopping. my dad's side of the family is over there. nothing really fun happened there, just alot of family bonding.  now i am back in the states, thank the lord.  i missed home (LA) so much. i mean i love my family, but i didnt have that much fun because i knew that while i was gone, all my friends were off to college....oh yeah, and i find out that aaliyah died.  she was so pretty.  had it all, the looks, the talent and the smarts.  y is everyone dying this year....cant take it anymore. now i'm finally done with my 1st entry....YAY...FINALLY....sowie so long."

Theres so much to say.....1st off, thanks Rice for introducing me to this....u r awesome.  k...what do i wanna write about now.....lets have a recap of my so called summer......{pondering}.........
During the beginning of summer, nothing really coolio happened, Tin and i hung out alot, LOTS of boba. went to a couple of grad partees and bonfires, nutting special. nothing really exciting. then July rolls around...damn is it already July....GOSH. Dacos birfday: we go miniture golfing, my 1st time ever. its fun at first, but frustrating at the end because the damn ball never ends up in the hole thingy. whatevs. it was fun though. we went to malibu castle near torrance. it was me, her, tony, reyes, ramano, eric and julius. we blind folded her and made it seem like we were taking her to a strip bar...funny ish.  what else. thats really it for july. o...i also had orientation, that was truely the hightlite of July...no offense Daco, ur birfday was fun too.....but orientation was the best. me and nythia went together. i drove the lovely distance. it only took like 50 mins. that has to be a record...from LA to Riverside. anywho, when we get there i see this FINE guy. he was white. drove a blk acura.  he was so cute. i love it.  so i check in and the orientation crew had some cute hotties too.  my roomate was coolio.  typical asian girl though. fixed up honda prelude, bleach blond hair, petite, really cool though.  so basically i had a great time. my counselor was so cool.  she really HELPED me alot regarding skool and whatevs else i asked her about.  Kimi is her name.  the one thing that went wrong is that i lost my room key and i thought i would have to pay for it, but someone found it and turned it in.  THANK GOODNESS.  i decided to rush and join a soriety....dont know which one yet, but thats y i is gonna rush.  Kimi really opened my eyes about sorieties and i am really glad she did.

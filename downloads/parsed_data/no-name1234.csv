"event","I dont know what to say. It seems like everytime I start to get in a better mood everyone around me starts feeling worse and worse. My friends think I dont really care about them, they dont believe anything I say. I dont understand what I can do. Ill sing a song, maybe thatll work.......

Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings
Of the bluebird as she sings.
The six o'clock alarm would never ring.
But it rings and I rise,
Wipe the sleep out of my eyes.
My shavin' razor's cold and it stings.

Cheer up, Sleepy Jean.
Oh, what can it mean.
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen.

You once thought of me
As a white knight on a steed.
Now you know how happy I can be.
Oh, and our good times start and end
Without dollar one to spend.
But how much, baby, do we really need.

Cheer up, Sleepy Jean.
Oh, what can it mean.
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen.
Cheer up, Sleepy Jean.
Oh, what can it mean.
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen.

Cheer up, Sleepy Jean.
Oh, what can it mean.
To a daydream believer

Doesnt just make you feel all warm inside. Come on smile, be merry, lifes too short to be gloomy."

"event","Hello. I have been awake for 3 days now. so I figured that I might as well write in the jornal. not much else to do at 5 am. I really want to go to the all american rejects concert next month. its on the 15th. well anyway. you know for the last 3 days I keep thinking about whether it is really in my best interests to join the army or to go to college. Its a hard decision to make. because my parents will pay for me to go to college and college will be fun. and about the army, i just dont want to join for the wrong reasons. and then regret it and wish i choose a different path. because i cant quit if i join. but i will be making some good ass income. but then ill miss my friends, family, and home. what does everyone else think? I should taKe a poll. and now i feel if i decide not to join everyone will look down on me because i already said i was going to do it. I dont know, I got nothing, all I can do is watch. hahaha. well till the next time. peace out niggas."

"event","Crystal- sorry for not treating you how you should have been treated. I was always mean to you. I took advantage of your friendship, I was an asshole. You were only trying to help me and looking out for me, but I didnt realize that till now. And Im sorry.

Tyler, and the Crew- Sorry for being an asshole when I was drunk. I shouldnt have let you see me like that. I hope that incident didnt change your views about me. But I would understand. 

Lindsay- Im sorry for what happened. You didnt deserve what happened. I dont like to be remembered through bad experiances. I really hope that you can forgive me. 

To everyone else- Anybody who I have failed to mention above and that I have wronged in the past, I apologize. I have been an idiot and I still am. But hopefully Ill change for the better.

This is not a goodbye letter so dont get the wrong idea. I just realize that not ever get the chance to apologize to all of you again so I figured Id do it now. Thats all I got. See you later."

Ok here's the deal. I dont hate anybody... But I am sick and tired of people getting into my business. just let it alone. Dont talk about it, dont even think about it. Cause its my decision not anybody elses. You have no say. And please get over you little childish hatred. Why hate when you can love. 

I believe you. I dont think you would do that. Its funny, you say Im a very important part of your life and yet I hurt you the most. Now what did you say about her and Jon. They hurt me the most. The people that mean the most to us are always the ones that hurt us the most. You can call me an asshole if you want and just be like everyone else who doesnt like to deal with their problems. I do care about others. But I care about her more. She means the world to me. Nothing is going to change that. Clearly. We have made our mistakes and we have both paid for them. I know everything now. Thats all I have to say about that. 

Anyways I have found a new activity that everyone can partake in when you are bored. Go to any car dealership and find a decent car that you like. Then you have to smooth talk to dealer in to letting you have a test drive. Me and jon did that yesterday. I got to drive a Z28 V8 5.7 Lt Camaro and 2005 Tiburon. Jon drove a F 150 Truck, really nice. He is out driving it now, the dealer let him take it for as long as he likes. Next time I go I going for a 2006 Eclipse. Yeah you know its fun. And Im spent. Im OUT!!!!"

       Entry number 2. This has been a very crazy week for me. I havent gone to bed before 4 am any single day. Some days I didnt even sleep. Thanks to Bawls. I just got back from Key West last night, or should I say this morning. Me and Jon were going to stay there till tuesday but Jon's mom ended up going to the Hospital yesterday. We found out on the way down there. We were going to stay with one of Jon's Captains. The guy is fucking rich. He had a full bar, thousands of dollars worth of Liquor. The best part was he said that we could help ourselves to anything we want. But we couldnt drink because we drove back at 11:30 pm last night. Anyways. Well till next time. Peace Niggas"

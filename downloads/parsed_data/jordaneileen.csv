Saturday morning i went to Brad's graduation party and i swam in the neighbors wicked hott pool...(it wasnt hott but it was awesome)..then brads friends left and we chilled by the pool, then i left and went home...i didnt do much there either but i showered and then the family came over and i babysat my cousins...btw me and my sister were grounded that night so we couldnt go to my cousins house to stay and that sucked and so we were in our rooms until like 12 doing absolutely SHIT and now im here...and now im leaving</FONT></P>

"event","hey everyone. its still the same day as when i wrote this morning but im getting distracted trying to work on my history project (which is like 20-30 hours of work...no exaggeration). Im so sick of school to this point and this stupid project isnt really helping. i have to babysit my brother tonight which is going to be a total bore. Im looking out my window and see boats (with people on them) in the water cuz its WARM today. Finally, ive been waiting for a warm day for like ever it seems. Well i found out that this summer im going to Hershey Pennsylvania to go to the theme park. I went last summer with my friends and it rocked and this summer right after we get out of school we're off! For my present i think cassie is going to come with me. i hope my parents let her because i couldnt stand a vaca like that with my brother and sister all over me...mostly my brother because hes ten times worse than my sister...but shes not bad though. Anyways its gunna be bomb and i am sooooo souped! i have to go to my soon-to-be aunt's wedding shower tomorrow and i have to be at my grandmothers at like 930 which means i have to get up at around 8-830 which sucks but whatever. well im gunna go try to concentrate to finish up my project so that way i dont have to worry about it when book report and theisises come around....lyl

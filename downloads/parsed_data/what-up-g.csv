"event","today wasn't nearly as good as it should have been.  It was the rare occasion where you seem have got just the right amount of sleep and getting up actually isn't a problem.  This once in several millenia occurence ought to precede a ridiculously good day.  As it is now, I'm only satisfied.

I heartily reccomend everyone listen to the following artists in the evening: Miles Davis, Dexter Gordon, B3 Bombers, John Coltrane, Charlie Parker, Maceo Parker, Lester Young Trio.  Its damn therapeutic."

"event","I think relationships are fluid, constantly changing connections between people that hinge on communication.  Communication is to relationships what milk is to cereal, what butter is to toast, what marshmallows are to hot chocolate.  But I think if a person is trying to say something that they want to, either intentionally or unintentionally they can alienate the person they're talking to by being ignorant of that person's thoughts and emotions.  Each person has a right to their considerations, and walking around with a sledgehammer instead of a handshake can make people bitter.

Thanks for listening to my tangential thought process.  Excuse me while I make some hot chocolate.

"event","I think life is a measure of your ability to balance things.  Prioritize, procrastinate, and work.  You need to gauge the importance of each element of your life and then make an action upon it.  An example: calculus has an importance rating of zero. sleep has an importance rating of ten.  good night.

A lesson in balancing.
Thankyou"

"event","Seems like something is always going on in my life.  The last time I slept past 6:30 was in April.  Climbed Mount Shasta last weekend.  What a bitch.  A little bit of a headache.  My head, I think, fell off and rolled down the mountain.  I had to go catch it.  On the way down, it seemed to have developed some strand of leprosy.  Doctor calls it sunburn, but I have my doubts.  Maybe it will go away in several minutes.

If anyone knows how to post images in your entries, let me know.  I would like to place a picture of something on fire underneath 'this is how my face feels'.

Excellent news.  It seems that through some flaw in the fundamental equilibrium of the universe, i no longer have a third or a sixth period.  It appears, therefore, that i will be ending my school year on tuesday.  Suckas!  although, I think all this good karma is tipping the scales and something really bad is going to happen in the next 24 hours.  I'll keep you posted.

"event","my hair was dissapointingly flat today.  i have devided that 120 volt outlets aren't cutting it anymore.  I've heard that toasters and bathtubs mix well.

goodbye cruel world.

i've been thinking for quite a while, and i never get to see anything cool.  i mean, something really cool. maybe if i became one of those camera men for realtv, i might someday get to see somthing really cool. like a cat jumping out of a highrise building that's on fire, or somebody actually standing on a bed of nails.  those have always been  sort of personals goal for me.

other personal goals:
-drive with my head out of the moonroof. 
-be a camera man for realtv
-get a song on the radio.  i mean one of my songs
-open a cereal box without having everything fly everywhere
-set fire to my... on second thought, i'm not going to finish that sentence.
-take madam ross's clipboard and shove it up her ass.  mabe it will dislodge whatever she's got stuck up there.
-survive finals
-get the skeeball into that ridiculously elusive 500 point hole
-mohawk.  one word.

this list will be continued later..."

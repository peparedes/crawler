"event","Today's sermon was on Knowing Jesus: The Healer
 John Gregory did the sermon. We watched some movie clips and one was on some members of our church. They found out that they had cancer. and her husband had something majorly wrong too. They were both life taking and in one family. how depressing. They have the Lord and knew if they stuck with him everything would be alright. They both ended up getting long painful surgery's but in the end there both doing much better. One surgeon said to the man you must have angels surrounding you. to sit and think that people can tell that you live a life with faithfullness is awesome to hear. also there was a clip on a man that was a swimmer when he was younger. One night he had to jump into the ocean to save 100's of people who were in a boat wreck and dying. Even though the water was ice cold and he had to get up to save them he still did it.It was the worst thing he had ever expierenced... and he will never forget the tragedy. when he heard people dying and drowning he couldnt do anything except swim faster.His legs were giving out abut he kept pushing himself to do a favor for people he didnt even know. He ended up saving 17 people.He lost all feelings in his legs becuase something happend with his nerves in his legs. He said it was very upsetting to him becuase not one of those 17 people said thank-you for saving there lives. yet he had to go paralyzed for them and has been in a wheelchair since and will be the rest of his life.When he went out to save those people he didn't say no because i could get hurt. He went out anyways and not to get one thank-you. from anyone? To stop and think if you saved 17 peoples lives wouldn't you want to get a thank-you? atleast one.It was amazing to sit and hear that and just to think.. you could be in that situation one day. either saving lives or being saved. but would you say thank-you?"

"event","Ok well i'm just going to say it. I hate hypocrisy so much..its been happening SO MUCh latlety and so many people right now are being hypocrites. I cant stand why people do that. Why dont people just come and talk to you (definatly talking about woodland daycare workers).. why they tell others and they start talking about you behind your back  or why dont they just tell you what is wrong instead of just acting like they hate the world but when there around you there nice to you but then when they aren't around you there saying they always are left out and never do anything.? I'm not saying i'm perfect.. because I know i'm definatly not. but i mean come on.. acting like that is like the 4 year olds at woodland. and some of them are adults. I mean seriously telling on someone for laughing and talking but you do the same.. and crying and being all upset and down becuase you don't think your friends like you or you dont think you have any friends. it's life. If life was a smooth thing with no wrong turns or bumps ever then everyones life would be perfect. Our whole world could never be perfect because if it was there wouldnt be little kids starving in 3rd world countries.. or being in gangs when there 7 or getting beaten because there parents dont want them. It's sad but all that will never stop becuase, our world will never be perfect."

"event","This is a forward I just got.. It made me stop and think about my friends..

 
One day, when I was a freshman in high school, I saw a kid from my class was walking home from school. His name was Kyle. It looked like he was carrying all of his books. I thought to myself, ""Why would anyone bring home all his books on a Friday? He must really be a nerd.""

I had quite a weekend planned (parties and a football game with my friends tomorrow afternoon), so I shrugged my shoulders and went on. As I was walking, I saw a bunch of kids running toward him. They ran at him, knocking all his books out of his arms and tripping him so he landed in the dirt. His glasses went flying, and I saw them land in the grass about 10 feet from him. He looked up and I saw this terrible sadness in his eyes.

My heart went out to him. So, I jogged over to him and as he crawled around looking for his glasses, I saw a tear in his eye. As I handed him his glasses, I said, ""Those guys are jerks. They really should get lives. ""He looked at me and said, ""Hey thanks!""

There was a big smile on his face. It was one of those smiles that showed real gratitude. I helped him pick up his books, and asked him where he lived. As it turned out, he lived near me, so I asked him why I had never seen him before. He said he had gone to private school before now. I would have never hung out with a private school kid before.

We talked all the way home, and I carried some of his books. He turned out to be a pretty cool kid. I asked him if he wanted to play a little football with my friends. He said yes. We hung out all weekend and the more I got to know Kyle, the more I liked him, and my friends thought the same of him.

Monday morning came, and there was Kyle with the huge stack of books again. I stopped him and said, ""Boy, you are gonna really build some serious muscles with this pile of books everyday!"" He just laughed and handed me half the books.

Over the next 4 years, Kyle and I became best friends. When we were seniors, we began to think about college. Kyle decided on Georgetown and I was going to Duke. I knew that we would always be friends, that the miles would never be a problem. He was going to be a doctor, and I was going for business on a football scholarship.

Kyle was valedictorian of our class. I teased him all the time about being a nerd. He had to prepare a speech for graduation. I was so glad it wasn't me having to get up there and speak. Graduation day, I saw Kyle. He looked great. He was one of those guys that really found himself during high school. He filled out and actually looked good in glasses. He had more dates than I had and all the girls loved him. Boy, sometimes I was jealous.

Today was one of those days. I could see that he was nervous about his speech. So, I smacked him on the back and said, ""Hey, big guy, you'll be great!"" He looked at me with one of those looks (the really grateful one) and smiled. ""Thanks,"" he said. As he started his speech, he cleared his throat, and began ""Graduation is a time to thank those who helped you make it through those tough years. Your parents, your teachers, your siblings, maybe a coach...but mostly your friends...I am here to tell all of you that being a friend to someone is the best gift you can give them. I am going to tell you a story.""

I just looked at my friend with disbelief as he told the story of the first day we met. He had planned to kill himself over the weekend. He talked of how he had cleaned out his locker so his Mom wouldn't have to do it later and was carrying his stuff home. He looked hard at me and gave me a little smile! ""Thankfully, I was saved. My friend saved me from doing the unspeakable.""

I heard the gasp go through the crowd as this handsome, popular boy told us all about his weakest moment. I saw his Mom and dad looking at me and smiling that same grateful smile. Not until that moment did I realize it's depth.

-------------------------------------------

I don't know if this particular story is based on a true story but there is so many story's like this that happen everyday. Some people don't have that person that stops and helps them with there books.. sometimes they just stop and laugh and they never would think they could be changing someones like forever."

 saturday.. woke up and i wasnt going to go to Rock The Universe but then i made my mom let me go and i felt awful the whole day... but no worries i was still OUT OF CONTROL! like always.. :-D well High school rode up seperate then the middle school and we had to stop on the way and high school almost got in 2 accidents becasue of the bus driver.. anywaysa we go there and all of the sudden erica comes up from behind me looking like she has been running taway from the high schoolers.. then she was like BYE see yuo later ( to the high schoolers) and said they almost killed her out of boredum on the bus so she was goign to hang out with us. so then we had to eat befoer I died so we went to.. I D K where and while we were eating all of the sudden the lion from Madasgascar came running up and i thought he was chasing me and i started panicing and hid behind Erica. He wasn't chasing me he was chasing some guy that worked there andhe tripped and fell and his head rolled off it was hilariuos! then Lucas came up and was all like OPHELIA! and like freaking out on everyone and then me and emiyl heard a song and we started to belt it out and we wer singing at the top of our lungs and everyone around us  was starring wile Erica was on the floor laughing at us. So we got up and went to E.T. and we picked names to tell them and Ilsa was Shakila.. Emily was Dolly.. Lucas was Ophelia.. Erica was Bionca and I was Shanequa Mill Latoya.. haha. i told her that and she was like how do you spell it and I was like sha-ne-Qua.. the Q is hard.. and I WASNT LAUGHING( it was really hard) but erica and emily were. So on the ride we were all screaming and these two people were like ughh? whats your problem.. haha. and so then Emily MADE us go on a roller coaster and i had on ericas BIg flea market sunglasses and my hair in really high pigtails and i was screaming and waving my arms around on the rollercoaster and the guy who worked it complimented me on my screaming and said he likes my sunglasses and he needed more people like me at universal.. that dont care what others think.. and i was like are oyu calling me crazy? but then erica pulled me away from him and TRIED to go to the Gritz concert but these two girls wouldnt let us then we stopped and Danielle got something at starbucks and she saw laura so we were there for a while and didnt get to see the gritz concert. me and emily were really sad! So we walked over to the Mummy with LAura and kessica and them and then we couldnt go on it becaused we had to check in and the wait was to long so laura and them went and we went to the Chris Tomlin concert. that was AWESOME. i loved it.  So then we went on Back To The Future and I HATED THAT! then everybody went all stank and we were trying to go to the relient K concert but there was like 3,000 people at that cocert! NOT EGZADURATING!(SP?) it was so packed! so we decided to leave and we  went to Jaws.. we were OUT OF CONTROL IN LINE! Lucas kept running full speed into me and Erica and then he would yell christian MOSHPIT!! i was dying... so then we were seeing how many high fives we could get and all of the sudden this guy gave me and emily a high five and was like yeah i have AIDS and  was like year eww.? so we stopped and when we got on Jaws i was dying and so we went to Back To The Future and I HATED that ride! I got thrown around SO MUCH! So we  decided to stop and get some drinks and we saw Mike and Brittany and me and Mike had a pretty OUT OF CONTROL conversation so then we headed back to the busses and vans and then i got split up from everyone so me and erica went back to chad and then chad told nme to go to the vans by myself and erica to go to the busses by herselfand i was like ughh? are you crazy..? so he got mad and he got mad at me because justin had to come back and get me.. so when i got to the van they told me that me and erica werent aloud to go on the next trip becuase we were late. so we were flippin out and telling them that it was crap because we were with chad and all this stuff and blah blah blah.. so when   we got on the vans i couldnt walk and my new was as big as an apple! so i was in so much pain and yeah Luara hung out with us NONE like she said she would.. poop. well yeah that was pretty much OUR saturday.. exciting isnt it. :-\"

"event","Well church tonight was really good. There wasn't really a lesson but 11 people got baptized tonight and said that they gave there life to christ. I was really happy!!  Most of them were bayshore boys and all the bayshore boys are all like ""YOU KNOW"" and stuff and whistling at them. but the worship was so awesome tonight. we were in the sanctuary and we did a lot of jumpy songs and we were all bunched together and it reminded me of camp the last day.. when we were all at the stage jumping around.. (as my brother calls it a CHRISTIAN MOSHPIT.) haha. but anyways then we did three slow downbeat songs to close the night off.  So many people from our school came that you would never think would even walk foot in there and I was really happy that they got to witness that event and see that just becuase we go to church we still have fun. But Chad was OOC!! He was wearing those suspender thingys that you wear when you baptize someone and he had on a straw hat and he had grass stuff in his mouth and was talking like he was from Myakka. It was hilarious.. then he put on this music and started dancing aorund in circles and swinging people around. and we played ""Bride,Princess,Knight"". Before chad dismissed he told everyone that the sanctuary was gogn to be the new youth room in about a year because we will be outgrown from the B.E.A.C.H. and he said there was 235 kids there tonight.. not counting leaders! he had to order more tickets for Rock The Universe and had to get another bus because there was to many people and more people i guess signed up tonight and we already had 130 kids going. so i'm wicked exited about Saturday and there is a buttload of kids coming to my house on saturday night.. :\ ohh well. Well i'm off to do some homework and get to bed.

How do you call that a good time? and in what way could you even be proud of saying your one of those people? i'm not saying i'm a goody goody who never messes up but i dont go around getting wasted, having sex, having a foul mouth, ect. yeah sometimes i do slip and make mistakes and i'm not perfect but i do my best to  stay on the right path and i do my best to listen to what God has in plan for me.

  I can't believe all the damage that Katrina did in New Orleans.. it is really sad to watch the news and see all the people that are living on there roofs and haven't eaten or even gotten something as small as water in a week. there is little kids not even 1 year old that are laying down on the sidewalks just crying because they are so hot and need food and water.Not to mention all the bodies everywhere becuase they drowned or the people that drowned in there houses because they couldn't get in the attic fast enough and the house filled with water. It brings tears to my eyes to see all this people suffering by something that they couldnt control and then familys getting split up and going to different states because thats all they can do to live. To see how grateful that some of the people still are that they are alive makes me feel like we all act so ungrateful for what we have but then again im so thankful that it didnt hit us."

I STARTED FREAKING OUT!!! i was dying .. and then she almost hit and truck turned really sharply and almost hit a semi.. yeah so we were pulling out of hess and see something on the pole and it looked like a ghost! i was so scared and so we finnaly made it back to my house safe and checked inside the whole car and saw nothing. so idk but were NOT crazy i swear!

"event","Today I decided that it would be in my best interest to return to Tifa's bar and apologize for the incident I caused there a little while ago. I felt particularly bad for the trouble I caused so I gathered up what little Gil I had, searched the Gauntlet high and low for some special flowers, and got a hold of some chocolates to give her in recompence. When I arrived I was interested to discover a strange individual sitting at the Bar, and both Tifa and Aerith trying to discern his purpose, what exactly it was that he was looking for. The man's name was Foil and after breif observation and a short, whispered discussion with Tifa I determined that the man was most likely an assassin. Now, the distressing part of this news was that this man was eyeing Aerith in the same manner as a cat my eye a fish, which was making Tifa very uncomfortable and, after accepting my formal apology she was delighted to tell me that she knew of a job oppourtunity... I was, obviously, delighted to hear this and when I enquired as to the nature of the work and the employer Tifa slid a peice of paper across the table, informing of the job without alerting the disturbing weird boy present in the tavern.

*Attached to the page here is a smaller peice of paper. The script appears to be in a woman's hand* 
Lucian, 
I trust that cloaked fellow about as much as a 2 year old could throw him. I really don't like the way he was looking at Aerith. Think you can keep an eye on her for me? Don't let on that you're looking out for her though. Keep it subtle if you can - it'll probably be easier for you to look out for her if she doesn't know you're looking out for her. I can pay you per day. And anything you can find out about that man would be appreciated. Might want to let Captain Nooj and the Eschatologists know about this guy - I have a feeling he's going to want to visit them, and I doubt that the visits are for tea and cookies.""
Tifa

Of course, upon seeing the nature of the job I could not resist. It was wonderful to know that I was needed therefore I responded in kind with a note of my own accepting the job. Looks like I'm going to have to play a little bit spy, a little bit body guard, and a little bit errand boy. I do hope Foil tries to cause problems... That would be wonderful.

List of things to do:
1) Notify Nooj and the Eschatologists.
2) Watch out for Aerith.
3) Get revenge on Kyara...
4) Get paid.
5) Get new gun.
<strike>6) Take over the world.</strike>"

"event","It's strange how life tends to seem darkest before a new dawn. As I sit here on the banks of this wretched infernal river people call 'Lifestream' (Bah! Life indeed!) memories slowly come back to me. I peruse the pages of this volume... the old entries set upon paper from the days in Ivalice when I had no doubts and thought I truly understood the world... and one by one I tear the pages from the binding and cast them into the sickly glowing soup of the Lifestream. The past is gone now... washed away like dirt in a gentle spring rain and I am here now...

By rebirth from the waters Lethe was confusing and dark and punctuated by nightmares. The thing that sticks in my mind most firmly though are the moments of my death. So I choose to write this here, just so I can remember and it can remind me... the only hold over from my old life. The dream was dark... but I can remember it quite plainly:
The Priest held his hands aloft as he spoke, the crowd was intent on his words. ""This man, this Lucian Snyder, is guilty of High treason against the nation and against God."" The words rang in my ears as I recall, and they rent my heart. The crowd fell into a hushed awe as the Priest said his words. I stood beside the man, a noose around my neck knowing with all certainty that my day had come, my luck had run out. I had never asked for this... I merely did what I had thought was right. The church however, had different ideas of right and wrong apparently. ""Look upon the Heretic!"" The Priest had continued. ""Shun this man, even in his last moments for there is no forgiveness for him in the heart of God!"" A snicker from my lips, no longer containable interrupted the Priest's holy tirade however and he turned to face me, the 'accused'. ""You have something to say heathen?"" He asked me. My response... I spits in his face. ""Tell them about the stones Cardinal! About the demons! About the filth you fill their minds with!"" I said my peace; spoke of all I knew because I would not have another chance. The crowd stirred, obviously confused, but all that was stopped by a wave of the priests hand. There was a sudden drop and a short stop and then... no air. I couldn't breath. I struggled but my hands were tied. 'This is the end' I thought, as the blackness caved in. 

That blackness... That blackness had the gentlest touch I have ever felt. It was the loving embrace of death, and it welcomed me, just as it welcomed all others. Death was a lover without scruples. All could come to it and all would be welcome... whether they wanted to be or not. And so death claimed me and had it's way with me. But somehow... this place... this place has defeated death and I here I sit, alive and breathing.

Initially I had believed this place to be hell... I had even mistaken one of the people who wanted to help me for a demon. It was a confusing time... but the people around me attribute it to something they called the 'Gauntlet Blues'. However... with the help of a woman from my homeland and a little rest I managed to over come my difficulties. She was kind and caring... but I've not seen her as of late. Perhaps I should go seek her out once more... to talk of old times... or perhaps I shouldn't. After all... this place is new and different. This is my new chance at life. Ah yes... chances. Now this is the philosophical quandary. Do I cling to the past or forge ahead anew and leave behind all that I once knew? Truly in this world I seem capable of doing both. There are people from my old world here and new people from worlds I could have only dreamed of. I find myself torn between dedication to my past and the movement of time and road of future. Perhaps... I think, as I tear these old pages from my journal to make room for new, I need not make a choice just yet. Perhaps, I'll just see how things turn out from this day forward. I know my mother always told me there was no way to walk the fence... but that rule has been shattered by the very existence of this place... so... perhaps I can keep to my past and walk the road to tomorrow.

We shall see."

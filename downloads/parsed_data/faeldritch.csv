"event","We bought a car from one of David's coworkers with a contract stating $300 down and $900 more to follow. She didn't have the title to give us and had had&nbsp;a lien against the car that she'd paid back, but the company had since gone out of business. So while she was appealing to whomever you appeal to in such situations, we were driving a car with an expired tag for months- because you need a title to get a new tag. (David told her that if we got ticketed for having an expired tag, she was paying the fees.) So one day a month-or-so ago, she comes to work with the title and said if David didn't give her the last $300 that day, she was taking the car back (evidently she'd kept a key). So she did, and David called the cops and showed them the contract which did not stipulate time frame for payment. Small-claims court, they said. She tried to tell us we had no right to ask for the $900 we'd already paid, but the next day she admitted that she'd been wrong about that, and simply couldn't afford to give it back, so the car was still on the table if we could come up with the last payment. So my mother, my wonderful, thoughtful, caring mother who rocks gave us the money out of her tax return. Upon taking her the money, David learned that the car had been impounded because she decided that a good solution to having an expired tag was to just remove the plate altogether. It cost her $400 to get the car off the lot, so she had to use all of our last payment and $100 of her own besides. And the title is signed over to David. 

I'm caught between thinking that the car was meant to be impounded and isn't it a blessing it happened after she had reasserted possession so we were not out that money too, and feeling very smug. I'm trying to be more charitable in my thoughts.&nbsp;

The husband of my&nbsp;boss at the foreign language dept. just underwent spinal surgery and I overheard her mention that she needed a mini-fridge so her husband wouldn't have to walk up and down the stairs to get a drink or snack. I told her I had one she could borrow, though it is a bit dirty and i need to get my computer off of it first. She says that doesn't matter. She's giving me a lift home today so I can put it in her car. 

Tomorrow I'm going to camp out at Walmart until the manager sees me. If he's not there&nbsp;then&nbsp;I'll go Friday as well. I've got books, I can wait all day.

I've been making A's and B's on all my quizzes and tests of late. Actually only a couple of C grades this semester, and those should be dropped. I love teachers who drop the lowest quiz grades. Stuff happens. I'm a little nervous about next fall, though. I've switched to World History and Cultures major, which uses more of my classes (all but 2, and they were D's anyway) and doesn't require that I qualify for an upper level program. It looks like all the psych and soci and anth courses I took were not for naught. Even that 3000 level anthropology class about human origins and evolution that I took because it sounded interesting fills a slot in my checklist. I'm glad because that was the hardest I've ever worked for a C and I'm damn proud of it! Having it listed under &quot;unused courses&quot; for my Ed major tore at me. I asked and was assured I could acquire teacher certification after graduating. If I still want to at that point. Pretty sure I will, but, well."

I intensely dislike working evenings. I'm a early bird/ night owl hybrid. given my druthers, I would stay up until 1:00, get up at 6:00, and take a long nap after lunch. I've no use for afternoons, especially during summer in the south. it's hot, humid, and I'm drowsy from lunch and the sun. I love mornings before the sun has fully established itself ( pre-dawn is best) and from twilight on. I still prefer to see morning from the other side of sleep, though, or else I would just stay up all night. 

I am very proud of my sister. she's gone back to public schools in Gwinnett County and has taken to it nicely. she has some good teachers.

"event","<p><font color=""#993300"">Golly, this might take several installments! I guess I should start in chronological order, though that'll be difficult because what's happening now is so much better and more exciting than what came before. I've been hesitant to post because I didn't want to write about the bad, but didn't see anyway around it, and now I see I must tell about the things that suck so it will be clear just how much things are beginning to not suck now. Something I've learned in my recent wanderings is that you cannot gauge how far you've come until you turn around.&nbsp;<br /><br />When I first moved in with David, he and his friends Will and Little Dave had just recently opened their door to David's little brother, Kevin, futher crowding their tiny 2-bedroom apartment and cramping the style of untold numbers of cockroaches. Kevin was sleeping on one of the couches with his furniture and belongings in the dining room. I was quickly overwhelmed by the chore of cleaning up after four men, only Will having the same views on the necessity of cleanliness as I had. He was less than helpful, though, seeming to have little practical knowledge of how to get and keep things clean. I blame that on his wealthy upbringing and the indulgence parents often have for the messiness of their male children. He was going to throw away his bathroom rug when I took it from him, shook it out over the balcony and added it to the dirty clothes we were amassing for the trip to the washateria and asked him to humor me. The delight and amazement on his face when he pulled it, fluffy and bright, from the dryer filled me with despair that I was doomed to teach people older than I was things I learned when I was two. Welcome to the disposable generation. If it requires effort, throw it away.&nbsp;<br /><br />It was a relief when the end of the lease neared and we agreed to move into a bigger 4-bedroom apartment in the same complex. We all took the week off, wanting to&nbsp;move as soon as&nbsp;the management said the new place was ready. David asked everyday, and they finally handed him the keys on the last day of the lease and told us we had six hours to move. Then it started raining. The new apartment was missing the silverware basket in its dishwasher (which had broken racks) hanger poles in the closets, a fridge that opened the wrong way, and had several outlets that didn't work. We scavenged what we could from the old place and were grateful that we had fewer roaches (they negotiated with us for our food, instead of simply taking it). Kevin lost his job. I learned I was diabetic and a week before Christmas, I got the flu. I was so sick the first day, I was to weak to get out of the bed and became dehydrated because I could only stand long enough to go to the bathroom and drink water from my cupped hand. David was at work, and no one knew I was home. I was sick for weeks and my boss replaced me, though I kept him in the loop. I have since learned that people with diabetes have crappy immune systems and are supposed to get flu shots every year as soon as they're offered, since we are more likely to die from it. Then Will started coming up short for rent, though he made more than any of us. This, combined with his attitude of entitlement had us asking him to leave.&nbsp;<br /><br />When we were living in the small apartment, I had stood in the doorway to Little Dave's room, where he was worshiping his computer with his back to the door. As a joke, I lifted my shirt and flashed him. Right then he shouted ""Yes! I just got 250 in Engineering!"" Little Dave then wanted to know what the rest of us were laughing about. So one night after we moved into the big place, we were watching a movie and everyone else had gone to bed. Little Dave and I were watching the credits and he asked me if he could touch my breasts. Out of the blue. I said no as gently as I could. He asked why I had flashed him that time, and told him I did it because I knew he wouldn't turn around and I apologized for making a joke at his expense. I said I would've been mortified if he'd turned around, and I was sorry for any confusion I'd caused, but I was in love with David. He apologized for asking and I told him we were cool, and went to bed and told David. I later told Little Dave that if he'd asked while David was present it might have affected my answer. I stopped flirting with and teasing him. One evening I was napping on the couch, waiting for David to get home from work, when I felt something and woke up. Little Dave jumped up and went over to the lamp and switched it on. I asked, ""Little Dave, what were you doing?"" and was surprised that I didn't sound as scared as I felt. He said he was turning on the lamp. I said, ""Before that,"" and he sat down next to me and said, ""I'm very sorry, Amy, I was touching your breast."" I had on a t-shirt with a low neckline. He said I was giving him mixed signals. I don't know how I was giving any signals in my sleep. He asked if I was going to tell David. I said of course I was, and I did. We couldn't kick him out, because he was paid up on rent, and we couldn't afford to buy him out. Besides, I had teased him before. I figured it was my fault as much as his. Now I'm not so sure. The next day, I went to his bedroom door and said, ""Hey, man, if you ever touch my breast again I'll knock your teeth in. If you were anybody else, I already would have. Do you want Chinese?"" That was pretty much the end of that, except now I can't nap on the couch in my own home.&nbsp;<br /><br />Kevin decided to get his own place, and David and I are doing likewise. Little Dave is moving into the dorms at his school. At my mom's suggestion, I took over the dishes entirely because I was tired of us arguing over whose turn it was. It gives me a sense of purpose. David and I went to the new apartments to look around and get applications. When I finally got up the nerve, we filled them out and the next day I walked down the road to turn them in. David had forgotten to sign something, so we faxed it to him at work and she ran our credit reports. We qualified with the minimum deposit. I was so proud of myself for handling business. When I was younger I was so shy I would have my little sister go up to the counter at Barnes &amp; Noble to ask if they had a book.<br /><br />I think I got a job. I called walmart every other day or so until I got an interview. When I got there they didn't know who I was. As I was leaving, a lady who had spoken to me said that the person I'd talked to on the phone just walked in and I should call personnel. I did and they told me to come back. I was glad because I hate to waste a good outfit and the dress shoes I'd bought in January seemed to get more painful each time I wore them and I had blisters on my heels. I had a great interview, and the lady asked if I could wait 15 minutes so they could do my second interview and send me for a drug test. I did, and they did. I walked (in cheap flip-flops I bought) almost a mile down Cobb Parkway and waited an hour to pee in a cup. They said they would call me for orientation on Tuesday, if nothing comes up in my background check or drug test. I'm going crazy.<br /><br />I've been packing my books and things we don't need like winter clothes and knick-knacks. We have 10 boxes of books, and another box worth left to pack. I sealed all the corners and unglued seams to keep from picking up stowaways.<br /><br />Heard you today, that isn't my name, you were fast asleep, <br />Forget what he did, can I be the kid for your soul to keep.<br />Some of us laugh, some of us cry, <br />Some of us smoke, some of us lie, <br />But it's all just the way that we cope with our lives.<br /><br />I've grown to see the philosophy of my own mistrust, <br />We all have our faults, mine come in waves that you turn to rust,<br />Some of us laugh, some of us cry, <br />Some of us smoke, some of us lie, <br />But it's all just the way that we cope with our lives.<br /><br />I've been hanging onto something, <br />You keep laughing awe-inspiring.<br /><br />Some of us laugh, some of us cry, <br />Some of us smoke, some of us lie, <br />But it's all just the way that we cope with our lives.<br />Some of us laugh, some of us cry, <br />Some of us smoke, some of us lie, <br />But it's all just the way that we cope with our lives.<br /><br />My wandering soul found solace at last, <br />I wanted to know how long it would last.<br />She's losing control, she's coming down fast, <br />The heart that I stole, I'm not giving back, never giving back.<br />""Some of Us""-Starsailor</font></p>"

I came up with this: <br /><br />when I am old I shall wear brown <br />so when I poo myself it doesn't show <br /><br />I told Dama this and she laughed and laughed. I hope she was wearing her diapers because she was laughing pretty hard. <br /><br />she has to be on oxygen now. it turns out she's been hallucinating for about a year due to unhealthy levels of CO2 in her brain, but she didn't feel it was necessary to <font color=""#800000"">mention this. the good thing is she had to quit smoking. the bad thing is she had to quit smoking. well, she could smoke <em>once</em>, I guess. but then we might not have a house left.</font></font><font color=""#800000""> <br /><br />also, I just got it: Ben and Jerry's Cherry Garcia= Jerry Garcia. stop giggling, I'm a little slow. <br /><br /></font><table cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""2"" width=""350"" align=""center"" border=""0""><tbody><tr><td align=""center"" bgcolor=""#eeeeee""><br /><font style=""FONT-SIZE: 14pt; COLOR: black"" face=""Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif""><br /><strong>You Are Basil</strong> <br /></font></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor=""#ffffff""><br /><center><img height=""100"" alt="""" width=""100"" src=""http://www.blogthingsimages.com/whatspiceareyouquiz/basil.png"" /></center><br /><font color=""#000000""><br />You are quite popular and loved by most people.<br /><br />You have a mild temperament, but your style is definitely distinctive.<br /><br />You are sweet, attractive, and you often smell good. <br /></font></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatspiceareyouquiz/"">What Spice Are You?</a></div>"

"event","<strong><font color=""#663300"">typically me, i chose the snuggliest jacket i could find when mom handed me her card and sent me to old navy's website. (i only had one pair of jeans and they were getting holes). it's not really a jacket, it's a zip-up hoodie sweater 3 sizes too big and the color of bitter chocolate, which suits me. my old jacket i bought when i worked in re-retail: roomy by several sizes, olive drab canvas, cargo pockets, and (according to everyone else) utterly hideous. i liked it well enough, and my style has ever leaned toward mixing soft, feminine&nbsp;articles with incongruent&nbsp;men's clothes like a flowing, ankle-length peasent skirt under a plaid&nbsp;button-up i got in the men's department. but the exasperated sighs combined with my recent purchase of an olive cargo messenger bag of a slightly lighter shade to lead me to thinking that i might need a new jacket. also, it seems to be a bit more bracing where i now live, and i spend a good deal more time outdoors.&nbsp;<br /><br />anyway, i found a sweater-jacket. today was the first day i thought it might be cold enough to wear it. and wasn't it! it was still trembling on the edge of darkness when i left the apartment. how the wind must love the gaps in loose-weave sweaters; it always seems so keen on penetration. usually, i end up wishing i'd left the extra bulk at home so i wouldn't now be carrying it; this morning i want to go back for longer sleeves on my shirt.&nbsp;<br /><br />i love the cold. there's a sort of giggling desperation in it: huddle close or we'll freeze! humans during the ice ages must have been very appreciative of ever their enemies in a storm. i wish we could love like that now.<br /><br />the autumn always puts me in mind of magic and family and the falling away of everything not crucial. leaves leave. the wind wipes the slate clean. rains wash away memories of what has been. the old lends its strength to&nbsp;what will be,&nbsp;quickening in the womb of the earth. people talk of spring as the beginning of the cycle. i think death comes first. not in the macabre sense of Everything Dies, but in the realistic view that everything does, in fact, die- and that's absolutely necessary.&nbsp;following my great-grandmother's death, my mom (who was pregnant with my sister at the time) told me that people had to die to make room. fall never disappoints me.<br /><br /></font></strong><strong><font color=""#663300"">Charades, pop skill

Ly has just learned this and is angry with mom for not having told her. when a kid's in shit, you never tell them how deep it is. mom didn't want her to have the fear that still sings in my nerves and makes me shrink from a raised voice and flinch when a hand comes near me. hell, mom didn't tell me how she got her shiner, and we were in the same foxhole. i suppose i might have guessed, but set it aside as knowledge that wouldn't help me. it bothers me how much my brain skipped over. <br /><br />it's well i know that others have had it worse. dad didn't randomly wail on me. i had food, clothes, and shelter. i never slept in the garage. i was never molested. but when i was 3, holding my fork improperly or forgetting the ""ma'am"" or ""sir"" after ""yes"" or ""no"" were offenses punishable by a carefully controlled ass-bruising spank session. not beating, because i <em>had</em> done something wrong (i had the strong sense that dad was merely waiting for me to slip and forget my Manners so he could hurt me with impunity). always careful. that was a source of the fear: knowing that if he loosed that control, he could kill me. and i knew one day he would. <br /><br />when we lived in the apartment in Jonesboro, the hall to my bedroom and bathroom had a door that, when shut, drowned the space in darkness. i was terrified of the dark, so putting me in the corner in this hall with the door closed and the light off was an <em>ideal</em> chastisement. i was obedient to a fault (i once called my mother from a birthday party to request the required permission for eating cake and ice-cream) so i sat facing the corner and sobbed. i was certain that Something Would Get Me and that i had dropped so low in my parents' regard that i was being offered up to this awful Something. i would emerge trembling, tear-stained, and later, <em>hateful</em>. i had seen my friends get in trouble and be embarrassed and guilty and even spanked, but none that i observed exhibited the trepidity and dripping fear that i felt. <br /><br />so i got pissed. <br /><br />in this way i reached the belligerence of my teens early. i didn't disobey purposely, but when confronted with a wrongdoing i hid my dread and reacted in a chilly, rational manner. and so my mind has ever been my escape route, my defense mechanism. i learned that one or two well-nuanced words could be stronger than my father's well-muscled arms. it all happened for me in that apartment. i grew up (or grew <em>sideways</em>) there, at the unripe age of 6. <br /><br /></strong><p><strong>Children in bloom cooking in the sun <br />Waiting for a room of our own <br />Leave my sister alone <br />She don't deserve this <br />She is a flower and I am a flower and <br />We are all alone <br />I gotta get out on my own <br />I gotta get up from this waiting at home <br />I gotta get out of this sunlight <br />It's melting my bones <br />I gotta get up from this slumber and just get myself home <br />All these wasted dreams <br />Just waiting for the sun to open up my heart to anyone <br />Bring me some rain <br />Because I'm dying and I can't get this damn thing closed again <br />I gotta get out on my own <br />I gotta get up from this waiting at home <br />I gotta get out of this sunlight <br />It's melting my bones <br />I gotta get up from this slumber and just get myself home <br />Where's the funhouse this year? <br />The fairground's deserted and</strong> <strong><font color=""#800000"">all the skies don't seem as near <br />Nicole's my oldest friend <br />But the altar is empty and she'll never be a little girl again <br />I gotta get out on my own <br />I gotta get up from this waiting at home <br />I gotta get out of this sunlight <br />It's melting my bones <br />I gotta get up from this slumber and get myself home <br />I can't find my way home <br />""Children In Bloom""-Counting Crows <br /></font></strong></p></font><br /><br /><table cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""2"" width=""350"" align=""center"" border=""0""><tbody><tr><td align=""center"" bgcolor=""#dddddd""><font style=""FONT-SIZE: 14pt; COLOR: black"" face=""Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"" color=""#800000""><strong>You Are 85% Tortured Genius</strong></font></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor=""#ffffff""><center><strong><font color=""#800000""><img height=""100"" alt="""" width=""100"" src=""http://images.blogthings.com/areyouatorturedgeniusquiz/genius-5.jpg"" /></font></strong></center><br /><strong><font color=""#800000"">You totally fit the profile of a tortured genius.

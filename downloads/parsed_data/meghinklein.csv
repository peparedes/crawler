"event","so skip to tonight.

first and foremost!
i saw the lizzie mcguire movie
today and thought it was cute.
ive seen the show, so i actually 
followed the characters and whatnot-
but it was good all the same.

had robin hood rehearsal all day
and i love being Lenore that merry individual.
or that ""spunky blonde"". haha
the script is aimed for the child's attention span,
but we're having fun with it.
""lead with your sex"" -john bukovec
 ..when walking around the stage. 
profiles and upstaging and whatnot.
LOVE having him as the director,
we're very lucky.
the actors are awesome 
once you get past
some ""i hate you looks"". 
::cough:: haha

only down side is that its a big cast.
which equals damaged attention spans 
and highschool bullshit drama.
""huzzah! huzzah! oh..joy. oh...elation.""

HOLLY- YOU STILL HAVE ""IN DREAMS""
AND ""ARTHER"".PLEASE GIVE THEM
TO MEL TO WATCH! b/c i know 
you dont have time to watch 
them yourself.

and i think ill exit with one 
line by the Town's Guy.
""Have you ever heard of fade out
and segue to next scene?
Mr. Technical Director! Please do
that voodoo that you do so well!""

this is all.
YODELS! April 10th."

the work atmosphere-

justin: ""yo meg! come here. come here!""
meg: ""did you just say 'yo'?""
larry: ""dawg, you cant say 'yo' to meg. that white girl will do that riverdance shit on your head.""
 and then,
justin: ""so that girl is gay?"" (emma)
meg: ""yeah""
justin: ""gay gay?""
meg: ""sure, gay gay""
justin: ""she doesnt look gay.""
meg: ""well how should she look?""
justin: ""not like that.""
larry: ""well shes not gonna come into fridays with a pussy in her mouth.""

last night 
me and court hit the circuit duet style.
no one else can make time to hang out 
with me anymore.
fine.
everyone is so damn busy 
with those busy lives 
they complain so damn much about.
saw the russian clan, marina and mike.
sang some 'blondie' with marina.
met frank sinatra and liz.
heard mikes cd.
'deck of aces' was awesome.
he rocks my world.

wed was the conference room painting project
/disaster.
the color was of a drugged albino smurf 
...who was sea-sick.
had to finish that by myself 
because everyone had to leave 
for one reason or another.
at the first sign of trouble, no doubt.
small room, paint, 
no windows, paint, 
no ventilation and paint. 
yeah, i had a fucking blast.
came out alright though.

this mornings english class was a film.
""M. Butterfly"" 
based on the true story and opera 
""Madame Butterfly"".
please go rent this movie.
love, deception, lies, death and more. 
a truely taboo masterpiece.

i guess thats all for now.
a weekend of work and then
back in action monday morning.

excited to see how this show comes out.

i convinced nikki to audition for Robin Hood.
nikki and i auditioned for Robin Hood together.
she made it, i didn't. typical.

didn't hit the circut last wed or thurs.
didn't get a call.
tried to help on Rodgers and Gershwin. failed.

worked all weekend. torture.
then went to help with Rodgers and Gershwin. failed. again.
was labeled ""worthless"" and given no job.
sherri flipped on me to relieve her stress. sucked.

today was math class and world civilization.
came home and died. no plans.

plans for tomorrow: _________  typical.

and thats all the fun exciting things ive been up to.

"event","well first id like to thank holly, shannon, lisa and evan for all calling me back today.

after experimenting with red hair gel in nikkis hair we went to tech class which was about shit and i almost fell asleep. mac thinks he can bum my notes b/c he thinks i have a crush on him and id do anything for him. right. i love people who think theyre god. then sherri gave me shit about her color blue and gave me an art license for the Rogers and Gershwin show backdrop. printed out a pic of van gogh's starry starry night and me and nikki went all artsy and kicked ass. we're so proud of ourselves. the thing covers four flats! we rock. then after cleaning up that mess, i watched the R&G tech which hurt my head and i went home. picked up court from the baby shower and went to the lounge. marina was there with every russian in the state of new jersey who all sang in russian and spoke russian and yeah. her friends wanted me to sing so i did the 295 and everything was going well until i was outside talking to this girl Anna the law student about mike. turns out he has this girl he's seeing and i was way out of line to give him my number and thats why he didnt call and its her bestfriend and blah blah blah. so that kinda ruined the evening. but of course i couldnt just sit there and wallow like a normal human. no! everyone wanted meg to sing! sing meg sing! so marina and i sang some jewel and sunk into some alanis and i was just so sick to my stomach i put down the mic and just walked out. bringing courtney with me of course. nothing can ever work out for me. ever. its not fair. i know, i know- but its my journal and ill bitch and moan if i want to. and i am NOT going back there for a while now. fucking ugh!

on the brighter side of things, i bombed my Robin Hood audition and cracked my head open on a door. BUT today my mother said she just bought this $9,000 water filtration system for the house that will pump purified Aquafina water all over the house. shower, tap, dishwasher, washing machine etc. why? god only knows. but hey- i AM meg hinklein and that shit is normal for my life.

theres always something to bring you down. 
excuse me while i go slit my fucking wrists."

"event","i love that man. everything i thought and said about the super half time show he said on the show last night. about kid rocks tribute to the USA by representing it with turning an american flag into a poncho. and how the NFL tried to make everyone sick with their new matrix cameras and that hard rock aerosmith concert to respond to the columbia? then of course the jackson tit problem. which is here for those of you who didnt see it.
http://www.funforwards.com/funpages/view.cfm/1910
justin said it was a slight ""costume malfunction"" and they both had to apologize and whatnot althought the NFL is sueing them b/c the super bowl should be a coach fighting, player fighting, steriod using, spine cracking, skull crushing, kill the other team FAMILY PROGRAM and jackson was WAY out of line to show half of her boob to all those children watching the innocent and pure coach fighting, player fighting, steriod using, spine cracking, skull crushing, kill the other team ""FAMILY PROGRAM"". i mean, what WAS she thinking? john said it was probably b/c her brother was getting all the press and attention and she wanted some also. haha. god, i love america. 

today im off to see ""Lost in Translation"" finally! in EBrunswik. and i know how to get there too- (thanks mel) goddamn route 18. i pulled a holly. haha

"event","so jules, courtney, nikki and i went and hit the circut the other night. met the famous Clay Poet (who absolutely rocked! if billy joel and elton john had a child together, it would be him. next saturday i have free i'll be going back to chat with him again and buy his cd.) and we also played a fabulous game of Scrabble (i spelt topaz)and had an ok time i guess, but the company will never again include jules. it didnt go that well and i guess she doesnt get out that much.

today proved ""super"" as the day at the restaurant moved very slowly.. the whole 9 hour shift was just painful.

nothing else is that exciting or even worthy of adding to this update, in which case i think i might go to sleep.


p.s. the big half time show sucked big time. janet jackson? and her song was from the soundtrack to the first clump movie. not new at all. and then ""oh diddy youre so fine, youre so fine you blow our mines with nelly!"" ?! what?! and justin lipsinking with janet? AND to top it off with kid rock? fucking kid rock? who- did you notice? had to change his lyrics b/c he decided to wear an actual american flag.
real lyrics: ""im a cowboy baby, and i can smell a pig from a mile away.""
tonight's lyrics: ""im a cowboy baby, and im proud to be livin' in the USA!"" psh. garbage. the only good part about the game was the very emotional Columbia Tribute and of course, Aerosmith.

"event","so first theres, ""i come for cabaret.""
second is this thing, no pressure:

1. Give me a nickname and explain why you picked it.
2. Am I lovable?
3. How long have you known me?
4. When and how did we first meet?
5. What was your first impression?
6. Do you still think that way about me now?
7. What do you think my weakness is?
8. Do you think I'll get married?
9. What makes me happy?
10. What makes me sad?
11. What reminds you of me?
12. If you could give me anything what would it be?
13. How well do you know me?
14. When's the last time you saw me?
15. Ever wanted to tell me something but couldn't?
16. Do you think I could kill someone?
17. Describe me in one word.
18. Do you think our friendship is getting stronger/weaker/or staying the same?
19. Do you feel that you could talk to me about anything and I would listen?
20. Are you going to put this on your livejournal and see what I say about you?

so last night we hit up the circut at the lounge and i sang cabaret again with court, mel, evan, bill, mike and nikki cheering me on! ""i come.. for cabaret!"" no, i dont need the words or anything. haha- and listened to mike the bartender and his shy friend sing ""do be do da dee"" and whatnot. god, i love that place. the owner joseph loves me. wants me and my ""posse"" to show up whenever we feel like it as long as i sing and he says i should go on american idol. (no emma, he's not deaf, or half deaf.. b/c im sure you had a comment to that somewhere in your head.) and after work on saturday im going back at 9 to meet his agent friend and a few guys in a band that play there every saturday. i mean, i know im not very good- but this is fun for me and im gonna enjoy myself. ill just take some swigs of some wall-tusson and ill be fine, right mel? dear god. mike: ""you'll be talking to her and she'll be passed out on the steering wheel."" mel is very talented and can drive very well while drugged up. what else? oh yeah, ...THREE! haha and all that ""sexual tension"". i had so much fun guys.. even with the retarded candle, the cold slab floor and courtneys tin box of human ashes. hey man, whatever! haha today was the ""tech corner time"" and class with the usual suspects and hoe-anne. mac was a no-show and jonny showed up to take the class! we sang cabaret the whole time and he was teaching me the dances b/c he had done it with premier. haha- and thats that. nothing else.. oh, told bill i was gonna go out with him, but cant now since hes going to california. darn. and mike takes every word i say to heart. and for those who dont know, i might come off as sarcastic at times totally unbeknownst to me. im sorry to hurt you mike, you really DO mean a lot to me. so i do randomly go into being completely sarcastic sometimes and i just want everyone to know that im really sorry if i do this while im talking to you, because i honestly have NO idea im doing it and please tell me if it happens, because i dont want to make you feel bad.   ...sarcasm? sarcasm? bueller? what else? i dont know- answer the questions up there so i can make fun of your answers. PEACE!

stuff has happened both good and bad,

  the cell has died and i need another one.
the numbers are gone, so i need them again-

went to new brunswik, Escape and frank's ""party"".

to be or not to be doesnt seem to bother me
stop complaining you whiney little brats
life is hard, thats why its life
no one ever gets out alive
breathe now or forever hold your peace
scream and yell and build a bridge to get over it
and dont think everyone cares about your problems
because we have our own to worry about
we dont need anymore
curse and cry and tell us you want to die
emotions are only human here on earth
stop wasting away and go do something fun
or suddenly you'll be 40 and alone

"event","so i failed to update about my night out with bill and tom the other night. it was the night of snow and slush when we decided to meet at bills house and then go bowling. bill had to give me directions yet again because i have a very small sence of direction, and except for the deer that were trying to ram me off the road, i got there fine. note: bill lives in northern bumblefuck and i dont care what he says. so we get in toms limo of a car and head to brunswick lanes? where bill showed us up with his many skills. i got a 109 the second game, which is good for me. and i beat tom in both games. ha! so then we played some air hockey! whoo! and violent air hockey it was. the puck was flying all over the place, taking out little kids and rolling over to the lanes. it was like, ""whoa! watch out, in comming!"" and everyone had to hit the deck. bill and i had this championship show down of air hockey which he won. (i let him win. thats my story and im sticking to it) and at one point the puck hit my hand which decided to turn a nasty shade of blueish purple, but im fine now. haha then of course the turkey game! ""KEEEEEEP GOING! YOUVE GOT TURKEY ON THE BRAIN! YOURE A TURKEY SLAYER!"" haha him and tom love that game to no end. it was a fun night that ended with bill taking care of my kissgloss and a long drive home.

TODAY: DOES THE WORLD STOP AT BRICK? WHAT IS BEYOND THE ABYSS?

route 9 north my ass! holly missed her band auditions b/c the directions were wrong and me her and court ended up at the newark airport. im not going into detail, but it was one hell of a trip involving finding my house,the Gem Motel, (bill! we saw the Gem Motel!) and bill my savior, a target, too many gobstoppers, the turnpike/parkway signs, the boop motel, eguanas, driving problems, ""im feeling this"", the ABS light, no U-turns, babies and trying to sing blink and brand new while on 9 during rush hour with locked doors and mel on the phone. not too sure when the next road trip is scheduled for, but ill be going. 
""where would you have ended up? 'Meg, is there a Quebec, NJ?'"" 
""Nah, I wouldve stopped her at Orange County NY or the ocean."" 
""Well, its Tom's River right? Maybe we should take this ferry."" 

""have some yo-gurt and i need an eguana
some-thing veg-table, i smoke marijuana
you gotta admit right now, i'm feeling this...

""OHHHHHHH AHHHHHHH OHHHHH ohhhh OHHHHH AHHHH WHAAAA YAAAAA
ONLY YOU! .......AHHHHHHH YAAAAAAAAAAAAAA OHHHHH ONLY YOU!""

-thanks guys. we made it home! and sorry again hol.. 
""DIE-UM!""
""thats Dee-um, hol.""

"event","In the greenest of our valleys 
By good angels tenanted, 
Once a fair and stately palace-- 
Radiant palace--raised its head. 
In the monarch Thought's dominion 
It stood there! 
Never seraph spread a pinion 
Over fabric half so fair! 

Banners yellow, glorious, golden, 
On its roof did float and flow 
(This--all this--was in the olden 
Time long ago), 
And every gentle air that dallied 
In that sweet day, 
Upon the ramparts plumed and pallid, 
A winged odor went away. 

Wanderers in that happy valley, 
Through two luminous windows, saw 
Spirits moving musically 
To a lute's well-timed law. 
Round about a throne where, sitting, 
(Porphyrogene!) 
In state his glory well befitting, 
The ruler of the realm was seen. 

And all with pearl and ruby glowing 
Was the fair palace-door, 
Through which came, flowing, flowing, flowing, 
And sparkling everymore, 
A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty 
Was but to sing 
In voices of surpassing beauty 
The wit and wisdom of their king. 

But evil things, in robes of sorrow, 
Assailed the monarch's high estate. 
(Ah, let us mourn--for never morrow 
Shall dawn upon him desolate!) 
And round about his house of glory 
That blushed and bloomed 
Is but a dim-remembered story 
Of the old time entombed. 

And travelers, now, within that valley 
Through the red-litten windows see 
Vast forms that move fantastically 
To a discordant melody, 
While, like a ghastly, rapid river, 
Through the pale door 
A hideous throng rush out forever 
And laugh--but smile no more.  

^ ""The Haunted Palace""
Edgar Allen Poe
_______________________________________

Thank Heaven! the crisis-
The danger is past,
And the lingering illness
Is over at last-
And the fever called ""Living""
Is conquered at last.

Sadly, I know
I am shorn of my strength,
And no muscle I move
As I lie at full length-
But no matter!-I feel
I am better at length.

And I rest so composedly,
Now, in my bed
That any beholder
Might fancy me dead-
Might start at beholding me,
Thinking me dead.

The moaning and groaning,
The sighing and sobbing,
Are quieted now,
With that horrible throbbing
At heart:- ah, that horrible,
Horrible throbbing!

The sickness- the nausea-
The pitiless pain-
Have ceased, with the fever
That maddened my brain-
With the fever called ""Living""
That burned in my brain.

And oh! of all tortures
That torture the worst
Has abated- the terrible
Torture of thirst
For the naphthaline river
Of Passion accurst:-
I have drunk of a water
That quenches all thirst:-

Of a water that flows,
With a lullaby sound,
From a spring but a very few
Feet under ground-
From a cavern not very far
Down under ground.

And ah! let it never
Be foolishly said
That my room it is gloomy
And narrow my bed;
For man never slept
In a different bed-
And, to sleep, you must slumber
In just such a bed.

My tantalized spirit
Here blandly reposes,
Forgetting, or never
Regretting its roses-
Its old agitations
Of myrtles and roses:

For now, while so quietly
Lying, it fancies
A holier odor
About it, of pansies-
A rosemary odor,
Commingled with pansies-
With rue and the beautiful
Puritan pansies.

And so it lies happily,
Bathing in many
A dream of the truth
And the beauty of Annie-
Drowned in a bath
Of the tresses of Annie.

She tenderly kissed me,
She fondly caressed,
And then I fell gently
To sleep on her breast-
Deeply to sleep
From the heaven of her breast.

When the light was extinguished,
She covered me warm,
And she prayed to the angels
To keep me from harm-
To the queen of the angels
To shield me from harm.

And I lie so composedly,
Now, in my bed,
(Knowing her love)
That you fancy me dead-
And I rest so contentedly,
Now, in my bed,
(With her love at my breast)
That you fancy me dead-
That you shudder to look at me,
Thinking me dead.

But my heart it is brighter
Than all of the many
Stars in the sky,
For it sparkles with Annie-
It glows with the light
Of the love of my Annie-
With the thought of the light
Of the eyes of my Annie. 

^ ""For Annie""
Edgar Allen Poe
____________________________

From childhood's hour I have not been
As others were; I have not seen
As others saw; I could not bring
My passions from a common spring.
From the same source I have not taken
My sorrow; I could not awaken
My heart to joy at the same tone;
And all I loved, I loved alone.
Then- in my childhood, in the dawn
Of a most stormy life- was drawn
From every depth of good and ill
The mystery which binds me still:
From the torrent, or the fountain,
From the red cliff of the mountain,
From the sun that round me rolled
In its autumn tint of gold,
From the lightning in the sky
As it passed me flying by,
From the thunder and the storm,
And the cloud that took the form
(When the rest of Heaven was blue)
Of a demon in my view.

today was work from 10 to like 6-ish. we had deer frolicking in the parking lot and playing in the snow today. some little kid goes, ""A MOOSE!"" and her mom goes, ""no dear, moosen dont live around here."" and i thought of holly doing that comic impression of box and boxen and died laughing. but of course the woman thought i was laughing at her and got annoyed. so i gave her a breadstick. michelle and rachel worked today and now im in charge of training any new kids, said lew. hoo...ra.. whatever. bryan worked today and gave me a hard time just because he loves the attention. yeah, we might hang out. and i had to get up this ladder in the middle of the restaurant to change a lightbulb b/c i couldnt tell Luis to, b/c i dont know spanish and everybody else was uneasy about it. ""dont fall! oh, be careful, dont let it shock you!"" ""its off you retards."" and what else? work was fun today i guess. danced around with vee and she told everyone her stripclub stories that all start out with, ""it was SO illegal, but.."" haha i love her.

and im stayin in and rented ""catch me if you can"" with leo. its a good movie so whatever. and of course i have no plans for tomorrow b/c i have no friends, haha so call me up whenever and im game for anything. well, maybe not ANYTHING.
who am i kidding? ANYTHING SOUNDS AWESOME!

Question of the night:
If anything was possible, what would you love to do?

My answer: do a tap number with frankie and gene.

"event","so 10am i was at the restaurant. figured i could stay until 4 and it would be slow and steady and quiet..

i get there to find out that they hired two new hotesses and i had to train them this morning. one was the girl michelle from freshman french class who was friends with julianna and damien, and her best friend rachel. not like they were dence or anything, but its a lot to learn in one day and i really didnt feel like teaching the world this morning. so we're off to a good start until dena gets double sat and starts bitching at rachel to wait on the seating until she can get a drink order. so of course i put in my two cents and then we skip to the lunching hour. we get hit hard around 2:00 and have to sit all the booths, side cafe, held a party of 13 in the smoking cafe and had to triple seat bryan my french canadian (who i love) in the front cafe. and there was only 6 people on day shift with michelle as the only swing and it wasnt pretty. turns out the server shawn lied to me, and couldnt handle the pressure b/c it was only his second day on the floor. so of course lew flipped shit and said we could only sit 4 tables per server although each server had sections with like 7 tables in them so we had to go on wait when we had tables free. didnt think rich or vikki were gonna show up, but lucky us- they decided to come and unfortunately allison came on time too. got to work with jen, which of course was the highlight of the day. we played around with bryan who said we should get together so he can give me french lessons. on the language, you perverts! told him i already have a burr-ray (sorry mel, that must be painful to read. i cant spell!)which i do. haha.
so of course theres no fucking helium for the balloons, and they cant send them to us because of our heat wave thing going on, and the atmosphere would create some type of helium bomb thing. so i have to physically blow up some balloons for these crying kids and i turn blue. but its not enough that im standing in the kitchen turning blue, i have the night shift coming on and justin, kendel and jesse are making fun of me turning blue. meanwhile, the booth that sits up to 6 people right next to the kitchen entrance gets sat with this angry fat woman and her 5 whiney prostitot daughters with their fucking gucci purses that match their hat and gloves. keep in mind that this woman had to wait 20 minutes for this booth and it turns out it was closed on the floor plan so when i saw them being sat, i knew lew was gonna freak out. so as im blowing up my billionith balloon, i turn around to look for lew and i see veronica's arm fly up and it hits wendy in the head. wendy turns around and thinking it was me, grabs the cherry liquid jelly shit from the dessert station and squirts it all over me. i let go of the balloon that looses its air and flys across the kitchen, out into the restaurant and right into the gucci moms soda. so poor des (their server) comes in the kitchen while wendy is apologizing to me with the balloon in hand and nobody said anything. silence. dead silence. but as soon as she left, we laughed. this cherry jelly was blood red and it was ALL over me and also hit the cabinet behind me and was all over the floor. so im laughing and crying b/c i cant catch my breath and everyone around me is just having a ball and jess comes in and sees me standing over this red puddle and i get, ""damn girl, plug it up."" and of course the kitchen just dies! i laugh too, b/c it WAS funny. so while this is going on, pam the manager needed to fax a menu to Work Out World (which i thought was funny. the guys who work at WOW want some healthy mot sticks and pot skins?)...and needed lew to help as soon as possible. so she calls up front by the door that lew needs to get to the office NOW. so he comes bouncing back thinking the worst and stops dead in his tracks to face me. blue in the face, cant catch my breath, covered in this blood red cherry juice with tears in my eyes and standing over this red puddle...

""WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED IN HERE? YOU'D YOU KILL?!""

it was a very long day and i plan on going to bed right about now. and tomorrow is work at 10am. who knows what'll happen this time.

oh snap! life is funny.

"event","ok- so lemme finish that dream i had..

so im unloading the tomatoes and puting them around the edge of this big stone table we're siting at and chris is going thru another bag and mel is sitting at the table asking me which ones she can eat. so then elijah wood comes bouncing in and says ""melanie! melanie!"" and he declares that hes in love with mel. mel doenst say anything and just sits there. then behind elijah is this older woman in this dress made out of packing tape who picks up mel by the shoulders and says ""melanie! give me one hour, one hour"" and she brings her up this long stone staircase. and behind them going up the stairs are like 50 girls who all looked the same running behind them with bags and luggage and suitcases. so chris says he has to leave for something, or maybe he had already left, and elijah sits at the table and asks me which tomatoe he can eat. so i reach over to give him one, and the tomatoe turns into a clock and starts to ring. so he goes, ""one hour! melanie!"" and the the sound of some far off gong in the distance, at the top of the stairs is mel is this cinderella/barbie poof (and i mean POOF) pink layered dress with her hair done up in curls and baby's breathe in her hair and these long ass bright pink fingernails and matching makeup. so shes coming down the stairs and chris comes back in and asks where all the girls are. so mel lifts her dress up and all these 50 somewad girls come running out from under her dress and stand in these two lines on either side of mel.. who is now getting married to elijah fucking wood. so shes coming down this makeshift aisle of girls thru my stone kitchen and me and hanson had to pretend to be her parents- so we're standing in the back with our hands folded by our breast bones. (like we were gonna start some opera) and mel keeps walking down this aisle onto this balcony thing that was behind me. so i go out there and theres this big metal pole thing right outside the balcony. so i go, ""whats that?"" and elijah says, ""its the eiffel tower, look down"" and sure enough- it WAS the eiffel tower. so i turn around to mel and she looks around the room and then looks at elijah and takes everything in and says, ""where are the cinnabuns?""

thats the dream. no, i dont know what it means and i dont know why hanson was in it and no, i never did, nor do i presently ""like"" hanson. sorry.

anyway.. last night i went to fridays to grab a tip share and then went to mels crib to journey into the Dark Realm of Anuelen and Queen Huelenai and her warrior something-or-other who had this awesome weapon the Valdris! which of course we played with and mel got it stuck in the cardboard box b/c she had to stab the box instead of some stuffed animal, which i sugessted. then i went online and we decided to make an act for the open mike event last night at the lounge cafe. after conversing with emma on different songs to try, we realized which sounded good, which ones we should never sing again and which ones just sounded hilarious! (the hooAAA..high note i cant reach..AHHH!) so maybe next time ""Dyke And A 1/2"" (thats what we're calling ourself) shall play, b/c last night i pussied (pussy-ed) out. but we did go and met up with evan, sorry again for being a tad late, and met up with bill and his friend tom. who thinks im cute- aint that swell? anyway~ so i downed like 3 mochas and a peice of this very fattening cake and after chatting about gossip and whatnot, and deciding that Boggle should always have paper with it, evan had to leave us. :( so bill, mel, tom and i had a championship game of taboo. and the buzzer/binger thing sounded like a enlgish car horn. no, i dont know why. so it was a fun night. course it WAS snowing so it took bill an hour and a half to get to the lounge and 45 min to get home. and my TRACTION ACTIVE light was blinking like fucking crazy..but we all made it home safely.

and my cell is dead dead. like, cant even turn it on but you can still leave messages that i can check from another phone. i should probably get a charger for it, but b/c im a lazy-ass.. i dont know when ill get around to doing that.

now, this morning i had a bomb raid in the my house AGAIN! 7am my mother is banging on my door to get up and out of my room so these old men can look in the upstairs rooms and attic for squirells b/c my mom hears noises at night. FIRST OFF: now.. if there was a squirell in my room, wouldnt i notice it? my mother obviously thinks not. and SECOND: maybe my mom should just take some sleeping pills b/c i dont hear any noises! ... and so- i had to get up out of bed and without my gift of sight due to not having time to put my contacts in yet, i opened my door and introduced myself all fucked up from no sleep to these random old strangers who were equipted like the fucking ghostbusters to hunt down a squirell. turns out they found one and now they have to come back in the near future. ...i...cant...wait.. fuckers.

and today i did nothing. after the bomb raid, i watched Murder She Wrote on A&E with angela lansbury and..whoa- its 3:00?! i dont know what i did all day. time warp i guess. thought i had work today but i dont. but i told my father i did and he wants me out working to give him money for the car bills..so maybe ill just dress up for work and show up at someones house. eenie..meenie..miney.. oh, im done here. call me! im at home.

"event","so for the past few days i have been wallowing in my pit of tireless existence waiting for something exciting to happen, and of course because this is life and i am me, nothing has happened. i ordered school books, went to Barnes and Noble to find a thriller (to no avail) and came home to watch ""In Dreams"" with robert downy jr. i highly recommend it, as it is a somewhat disturbing film with images that will stay hidden in the back of your thoughts until you decide to fall asleep. of course its rated R, so not for children or emma.

speaking of dreams, the past few nights i have been having quite interesting dreams myself. the other night i dreamt that i had gone off to a summer camp with a group of children i had to watch over. i remember counting them over and over and always having exactly 12. then once we got to the open field to play some sort of game, i re-counted yet again to find i had 13. i looked down at this girl who had a cracked doll's face as to be porcelin. she had only one blue glass eye and as i bent down to ask who see was, i saw her nametag read 'meagan patricia'. as i came up to stand straight i banged my head on this large metal pipe and found myself in this long white hall. and a boy named richard was being beat in the head and pushed up against the wall by nothing. there was blood all over the floor and me. and when i looked down at my hand covered in blood, i could see into my hand. at my muscles and bones.

..Then i saw the movie. which was odd i supose. as one has nightmares after the movie usually. but i guess theres still hope for tonight.


""look at the sky! how beautiful it is. oh, deja vu. haha ..wish i could save this.""
""but you did save it.""
""what do you mean i did?""
""sara, youre dying my dear. right now as we speak im holding your cold hand.. and youre reliving your life.""
""dying? right now? this present is really my past? this moment?""
""we're all dying sara. in one way or another.""
""reliving my life? right now?""
""you've left your body dying and youre going over the few things you can remember. right now""
""this cant be happening! whoa- deja vu.""
""exactly my dear.""

..and now i know who you are..

went to the mall with courtney last night where we just missed evan and crew. got my ""too pure to be pink"" shirt. (grease, kids.. pink ladies!)and i found twinkie and dingdong flavored lipgloss in tictactoe. heads up hol. then B+N where starbucks told me that they discontinued my coconut drink. psh-shar! how dare they..  and  then went to the movies to see big fish without holly and met up with kirk, emma, james, kirk, jill, rob, kirk and leah. oh, did i say kirk? no- he didnt show. :X  well, we went into the theater and left rob playing a video game, but he found us later and thank god he still had his gloves! and we ran into leah b/c leah literally ran into me. whoosh //// the red flash /// and saw mikey b who tried to lpull my new zipper earings ( >:| haha ) after trying to exaplain to emma that there wasnt anymore ""E"" in the slushie machine b/c it was broken and it only had nasty slush left over. and shakeema works at the movies too! yay for those cool movie employees. ~ so the movie was pretty good. everyone loves tim burton and im sorry- but the scene of him going into the chinese army tent was great!

and work today was alright. i love jen, i mean Mrs. Williams.. haha -shes awesome. too bad i cant work with her more often. and work was all i did today. that was it. little miss no friends.. ugh.

tonight i stayed in the room and unpacked all my stuff. im soooo happy to be back at school. everybody understands me here! its more of a home than my actual home.. alright room 113!! whoo!         

right. nothing against those unpacking of course. mazol tov.

hmm.. worked all day to no avail. nothing exciting happened. oh wait! ALISHA! -do you read this?- fucking PATTY BROWN came in for a job. remember Higgins beware room 34? yeah.. so THAT was weird. but they call her Tricia now, due to that bad pepermint patty year and she has long down her back to her but braids. flashbacks. ::shudder:: haha

what else? still have to get books for school. blah- oh mike! watched the movie and loved it. it really is a ""meg"" movie. but it makes more sence since you went over the characters a bit before i got really into it. however- as soon as allan put the record on, i knew exactly what was gonna happen. i dont think it was predictable.. but when jeckyl twitched i KNEW. but it was awesome. i couldve SO played the vampriss. is vampriss a word? so rent League of Extrodinary Gentlemen kids. and if you need anything explained, ill introduce you to mike from the lightbooth. ps, the LAGOOM from peter pan with the demented/ghoulish mermaids had to be the coolest part. ;)

so tonight i dashed to the outlets for that candies show sale. tomorrow is the last day! everything $5.00! emma gave me the heads up call and i bought 4 pairs of boots. tan, red, black and seafoam green/blue. no, i dont know what the seafoam boots will go with, but its ME and i needed them. probably shouldve told shopaholic joanne about the sale.. but since shes spending all her money on vikki's secret underpanties store- i highly doubt shed have left over.

do i have anything else to say right now? tonight im going to the movies with a group of usual suspects. emma, jill, heather, james and kirk. (turns out i will see him) <3 and holly is coming as my date, b/c im cool like that. BIG FISH is the movie so ill tell ya about that later.

then i went to work at five.

now work can be either awesome or sucky. tonight was kinda on the sucsome side. saw alisha, allan her boy, kevin and benis. i was waiting for matt to do something obnoxious and stupid, so i left crayons and paper and an etch-a-sketch on the table to distract him and it worked. not a loud roar from the table. weird..but thank you for not getting me fired. jessica simpson came in late at night with her friends. or was it britney spears? one of them came in and had the whole restaurant talking. me and justin couldnt care less. took a cig break with him and bryan and others.. turns out he isnt french.. at all. haha i realized that in that whole 5 minute cig break, you can learn a lot about a person. and you dont talk about work b/c youre there! you talk about a movie or a play, your car or your ""friends"" problems.. its a fun time. i can talk to my manager on a cig break like he was a friend, but when its over- he'll yell at me to get back to work. like its a time warp where reality leaves you and all is peaceful and calm.. for that 5 minutes. so now this socail smoker might become a heavy duty, but who knows. i like chatting with co-workers b/c theyre awesome and everyone is soo different in soo many ways. but off of that- jp and amanda came in and jp might work with me. thats cool~ having him there to talk with would be interesting to say the least. which brings us into school starting up again.. the 21st i start. and our first play is ""the some-what true tale of robin hood"" which i will be auditioning for. i think jp will be assistant directing it. rock on. hmmm what else? saw a cop go backwards on 9 after this one truck who was ALSO going backwards on 9 for whatever reason.. ok- it was a slow night. haha and i had this man give me his card and said he'd love to take me to AC with him sometime. when he can DITCH HIS WIFE. what?! the card said arther something and that he was a carpenter. i said i wouldnt call him, ""sorry"" and i thru it out. better to mean you wont call and say you wont call rather than mean to not call and say you will call.. right?

so last night i got all dolled up and met the kids at the cornerstone. mel was playing git-tar and emma was singing. ..and evan was the jew carrying everything in. and he did a GREAT job too! so lisa fretz also shows up with the video camera and her one-of-a-kind scarf that her great aunt made for her on her death bed. (it was a very nice gap scarf) so after my two cups of black coffee and 6 sugars, they decide to begin. dun dun dun. surprizingly both emma and mel wore the same color shirts (not planned) and i knew most of the songs that emma sang. (or is it sung? i dont think sung is a word.) anyway! so while evan is itching wether or not to tweak the cords and volume, im just tapping away and softly singing along to emma the whole time. well, until they decided to make up the ending to that one song. but it was great, i mean, i loved it. sure, there could have been more people there.. and i mean for SUPPORT- not the fact that it was a tuesday. but then again, it WAS a tuesday and im sure everyone had big plans they had to attend to. (note: well aware there was WE) but mel played and went to WE. supa-mel. ::cue bad theme music:: hmmm.. skip to today- went to brookdale campus for about 2 hours to sort out insurance and my sked and whatnot everything else. i actually stood behind this girl waiting to see a counsler about getting a socail security number. now, you need a bcc id yes, but what?! this girl was giving me a headache so i told her outright if she didnt have one, she wasnt a US citizen to the point where i got, ""oh my god!"" and she ran away. i mean, i had to do it- or i couldve been there for 3 hours! oh well. god bless stupid people. so my sked is fabulous. the man paying for my education says i had to drop my acting II class.. so that was a sad email to the instructor. but maybe he'll realize that the world of theater isn't a waste of time and of a person's life and ill be back in action next semester. lets all prayer together kids!

so theres no plans for tonight as of right now.. call  me if you want me!

"event","listening to ""perfectly marvelous"" from cabaret

its lovely to just wake up whenever you please and have the whole day to just shit around. i have that day, and today is it! so i emailed adam the other night about his performance and yes, i mentioned the township show and whatnot so we'll see what comes of that. and the other night, jan 3rd, court and i (yet again) went to see cabaret starring adam and susan egan, rick holmes and fucking vance avery. well, lets explain that ""fucking"". so right at the end of ""perfectly marvelous"" theres a drum roll, lights go down and then the emcee comes on stage with the white curtain and goes right into ""two ladies"". so me and court are sitting in our great seats trying to prop up the roses we got adam in between the seats (course the flowers kept leaking, so at one point court looked like she had wet herself. until she quickly designed a flower condom all McGyver like by pulling stuff out of her purse) and theres the end of ""perfectly marvelous"" and the drum roll.. ok..lights are still on...drum roll continues..and stops. at this point i get teary-eyed (you know i think i left my cd player on upstairs b/c i hear Rent..or maybe its just in my head..did i mention i like adam?) ANYWAY! so i get all teary-eyed thinking the adsolute worst and court starts to get mad.. then God comes on with ""PLEASE REMAIN IN YOUR SEATS. REMAIN IN YOUR SEATS. DUE TO SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES WE WILL HAVE TO PAUSE THE SHOW. PLEASE REMAIN IN YOUR SEATS. THE SHOW WILL CONTINUE WHERE IT LEFT OFF AND THE ROLE OF EMCEE WILL BE PLAYED BY VANCE AVERY."" at this point the audience decides to run around in circles asking other people in the audience what happened. (now, would they REALLY know if they were sitting next to you? and if they did, would the tell you? ""Yes, well actually I was paid to poison his water backstage left and well, looks like it worked! If you'll excuse me, I must go to the restrooms now."" - HONESTLY!) so i turn to court with cracked-out raccoon eyes b/c adam is gone and i start panicking for his family and him not being able to do the closing show! court got mad. court got mad, mad, MAD. :::::::::::took a DEEP breath:::::::::::::: then court picks up the roses and pulls out the FTHS DRAMA flyer and puts it in an envelope she just happened to have in her wonder-bag, and we decide to write this fucking AMAZING note to adam to put in the envelope all together. we wrote that we were here, our hopes and prayers are with him, mentioned the FTHS flyer and the roses and court has this great idea to add the Irish Blessing on the back of the envelope. so we put all that back together and put the roses ont he floor and Rick and Susan come back out of stage. Rick hops onto the desk and starts singing the end of his song. ""I...met..."" at which point susan decided to break character and turn to the audience with ""come on everybody sing!"" so everybody sang ""THIS PERFECTLY MARVELOUS GIRL"" to get Rick back to where he had to be..like he needed OUR help or anything, right? but it was funny and even rick and sue laughed at it. so they end and the drum roll...lights go down....and BAM! here comes Vance Avery! (ugh) now, everyone wanted to hate him solely for the fact that he wasnt adam, but we later found out that vance was playing one of the kit kat boys and was pulled off stage, and was told he had to play the Emcee b/c adam went to the ER as 3 different people tried to put him in costume and make-up and then they said, ""break a leg"" and pushed him out on stage with a BAM. (see above) NOW! skip the rest of the show with a note that vance WAS very good.. especailly sicne he had 45 seconds to get ready. ok, so we're skipping...:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: the end of the show and me and court RUN outta there to the stage door where we met everyone, gots sigs and pics and had this body gaurd guy who worked there take the roses and swore to give them to adam. and im sure he did- after my star performance as adams close concerned friend, Meg. which leads me to the story of the ER.. so Vance of all people told court and I that adam had banged his knee into a metal pole coming off stage and the pain made him loose his balance and he fell, hurting his ankle. they had to rush him to the ER for insurance purposes (which court thought was interesting- rushing him in full make-up and costume to the ER) AND TURNS OUT ADAM IS 110% A-OK! HE DID THE FINAL SHOWS WITHOUT A MISSED BEAT AND WAS AMAZING AS USUAL! he'll be working with Disney and Phil Collins now on a Tarzan workshop toward the end of January. he'll be the narrator and he said he looks forward to singing all phil's great songs.   ...so it was an interesting trip to say the least. course there also was the box office who lost my tickets b/c they were under KINKLEIN instead of HINKLEIN. whatever- so then the bus and the audio commentary for evan.. all was good. k- now i gotta go. catch you on the flip side!

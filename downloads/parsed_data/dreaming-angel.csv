How can you just walk on by
Without one tear in your eye
Don't you have the slightest feelings left for me
Maybe that's just your way
Of dealing with the pain
Forgetting everything between our rise and fall



You, i hear you're doing fine
Seems like you're doing well
As far as i can tell
Time is leaving us behind
Another week has passed
And still i haven't laughed yet
So tell me what your secret is
To letting go like you did, like you did

How can you just walk on by
Without one tear in your eye
Don't you have the slightest feelings left for me
Maybe that's just your way

Forgetting everything between our rise and fall


Did you forget the magic
Did you forget the passion
Did you ever miss me
Ever long to kiss me"

"event","Last night(Tues) I had the privilege of working the 11-7 shift as an extern in the Er. At first I was very scared because well its the ER and anything can happen. My fears subsided very quickly because the PCA and the rest of the staff that I worked with were excellent and eager to teach/show me things. I saw everything from a guy coding to a stomach ache. They also trained me to give ECG (Electrocardiograms) and I got to do one all by myself without supervision. I really enjoyed this unit but some things were sad to see like the guy coding and the little kids that were sick. 

I did have something awesome happen as well. I was talking to my PCA as we were walking to get Medical Records and he told me he had worked at Cabell for 27 years so I figure he knew my grandfather. As soon as I mentioned his name his face lit up along with another nurse who had just passed us. They both were so complimentary of his ethics, bedside manner, and his personality. He definately a one of a kind surgeon who prayed before every surgery and in meeting with the patient. I know some doctors have bad reputations of just ""getting the job done"" and leaving the room as quick as possible but please keep in mind that their are some amazing ones like my grandfather who really care. So Cummings' family..be proud,honest, caring, and hardworking because we have a legacy to up hold."

Yes, I can be and have in the past when people need me to be or when I just want to hide behind my feelings but I'm having a little trouble with it right now.

"event","My Western Carribean cruise with Mom, Vern, and Becky was beautiful. The ship and everything to do with it was faboulous! I would have to say that my favorite spot was Grand Cayman. Even though the walk was horrible, the beach was amazing. We actually got a small little spot and it was like we had our own private beach in the Carribean. Ahh it takes my breath away just thinking about it. Well its so hard to describe the cruise so I'm just going to stop here and say that Carribean waters and just being out at sea is so amazing to me. =) The only issue I have is that I feel so guilty arriving in a HUGE and extravagant cruise ship at all these poor islands. I just want to tell them to come aboard. Oh but I did get to see a monkey in its natural habitat in Belize!! Mucho smiles here.

Well after the incredible cruise it was back to reality. I had extern orientation on Tues from 8-3 at the hospital and then I worked 7-3 for my unit orientation today. So life is crazy again. I worked with a PCA (Patient Care Assistant today) and I've never been more busy. I spent the morning getting vitals, giving bed baths, passing trays, collecting trays, Glucoscans, and help sit with a restrainted mentally disturbed man. Needless to say it was an experience. I love being able to take care and talk with patients but its just so hard and tiresome. I did have to fight back tears today when helping bathe a female who was a car wreck victim. Some of her injuries and some of her features reminded me of Molly and it kind of hit me like a brick wall of a sudden but I managed to suck it up. On another note...one of the other externs (Ryann) and I had to sit with this restrained kind of crazy man. He told us that we were both beautiful girls and that he loved us. He also told me that I could he his wife and all I had to do was get pregnant and take care of the children. Awesome I know but I did feel bad for him because he's been there so long and noone came to visit. I guess some of these things are just the downside of nursing but at least I sort of helped. There are so many stories I have from today but don't worry I'll just stop here.

My life is good right now! Tommorow night is my sleepover night with my HHS Htown girls Amy, Katie, April, and Lysh. I'm excited to laugh and to be happy with my girls!!!  Twin Julia and I are going to Buckhannon on Friday too see her bf (Jim) and so I can finally spend time with Roberto!!! I'm soo incredibly excited that I can barely stand it!!!! =) Well its bedtime so I hope everyone is doing ok.

"event","Wow! The movie ""Hotel Rwanda"" has definately opened my eyes to so many things. If you have seen the movie then you know what I'm talking about. I'm not going to sit here and explain the movie to you but its definately something people should watch. Yes, it puts us outside our comfort zone and at times is very difficult emotionally to watch but its so inspirational and eye opening. I feel so blessed yet I feel ashamed. I take the simple everyday things I have for granted. As Americans we are blessed but we have too much. I'm sorry if you beg to differ but we do. I felt almost ashamed to be an American during that movie. Yes, we weren't the only ones to blame but we didn't do all we could either. I don't even know how to sort out my feelings right now. I'm so overwhelmed. This movie also reminded me so much of Guatemala and the city of El Carmen. The kids and families have basically nothing there yet they are the greatest people you will ever meet in your life. I want to go back and help so badly and I'm determined to again in December. I just wish I could explain things to you all! Please just pray for those less fortunate and be sooo incredibly grateful for what you have. Take care"

"event","As some of you know, my pastor of 10 years, David Erenrich had his last Sunday at my church this past week. He is being appointed as the District Superindent of the Northern District. Pastor David's leaving has been extremely emotional for me since he has seen me through my young teenage years until now. He was there to hug me and hold my hand as I said goodbye to Papa minutes after he died and he was there to comfort me through the loss of all of my grandparents. David watched me grow up through youth group and was always so encouraging and supportive of my various roles in youth and other activities. He was so energetic and definately touched the lives of many. On Sunday in his sermon he told us he wanted us to remember at least these three things if it was all we learned during his 10 years. Here they are and I'm going to try to do my best to elaborate.
1. Never lose the spirit of gratitude. Try to be grateful and find something good in every situation whether it be cancer, death, graduation, etc. You don't have to be grateful for the cause but rather find something good about the situation as a whole. For example being grateful for the love and support you receive during the disease or treatment.
2. Never lose the spirit of love and compassion. Basically never forget to reach out to others no matter what their social standing is or who they are. 
3. Don't lose the will to follow Christ's mission. 

My words do not do David justice but still its something great to live by.
I was thinking about these 3 statements and a memory of my grandfather (mom's side) came to my mind. I will never forget when my Dad's father (Papa) died my grandfather came to the visitation and the funeral. At the time, he was really struggling with his health and my grandmother was really starting to decline emotionally and physically. The receiving line for Papa was very long but my grandad managed to wait in line with my grandmother for about an hour or more just to pay respect to Papa and show concern to me. I remember my other relatives on my Dad's side saying to me how wonderful, considerate, and kind it was for granddaddy to be there. I remember he also did the same thing at Maa's visitation as well. Grandad is one thing I was very thankful for him in that situation. My grandfather definately lived a life of love and compassion and I will always be grateful for the time I had with him.

My advice for you all is to live life with gratitude, love, and joy because you only get one lifetime on this Earth. Go out there, chase your dreams, and enjoy life for what it is worth.

I'm already starting to get bored but once my externship at Cabell Huntington Hospital starts I think that will change some things. I'm missing *you* so incredibly much and I honestly don't think you realize how much you mean to me. 

Since I've been home..... I've watched my beautiful neice in her ballet recital, had QT with bestest and Kristin, went to church which made me happy b/c I got to see everyone and my preacher is fantastic, had a physical, presented scholarships at HHS awards ceremony, went shopping twice, and slept a lot. Oh yea my life is really exciting! I'm sure you can understand why I'm anxious for my job to start. On a really really good note, I get to go on my cruise in 10 days!!!! 

Although I've been rather bored I have been able to think about a lot of issues in my life and figure some things out. Maybe when I can find the words to describe what I'm feeling then I will. 

I've been trying to write my scholarship essay for church but the words just aren't flowing. The topic is involvement and what you've done for your church. Its really hard for me to describe something that has been so much a part of my life for 20 years. I'm starting to realize how much I miss being a part of youth group and the church family in general. Its amazing how fast time goes by. It seems like just yesterday I was on the House of the Carpenter Mission Trip! 

Ok so I've rambled enough, sorry to take up your time!!! I MISS MY ZTAS, WESLEYAN KIDS, NURSING KIDS, AND MY LIVE TIGGER! 

So excited for lunch with my girls Katie, Amy, Lysh, and April tommorow!!!

Remember when old ones died and new were born
And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
We came together, fell apart
And broke each other's hearts
Remember when"

Micro is killing me and I'm ready for it to be over especially since I have a practical tommorow. On the contrary I don't want to leave this place behind in 15 days because that also means saying goodbye to a special someone for awhile! I did have a wonderful dinner, evening, and night with him!

I'm so relieved to be stress free for a few days and not having to worry about when the next test will be. Although in some ways I wish it was the middle of the semester again. I miss my friends and all the amazing memories we have made. Its hard to believe that the semester is over because in some ways it feels like it just began. I think I took advantage of some of the things in my life. (Mainly my senior friends and sisters) I kept thinking oh we have a few more weeks to be together and make even crazier memories. Well that time is gone and they are moving on to something new. I wasn't completely ready to let them go but I know each of them will succeed in whatever they try but I'm going to miss them. At least some of them will be around Bucktown when I'm in May Term so I can't complain too much. Well, home is nice. Some of my out of town relatives just left so I can finally totally relax with the exception of the phone ringing off the hook. I hope everyone is enjoying summer, graduation festivities, classes, or even upcoming finals. If you need a friend,I'm here. Don't hesitate to get a hold of me. Take it easy and live it up!

When I got back from the Tea Collette tells me to grab a beer and chug it with her because she got treated like shit by a boy. So I run to my room and slowly drink a beer with her and try to calm her down as much as I could. We ended up playing drinking games and just hung out with Sam, Lauren, and Angie. Well in the middle of the night, everyone seemed to disappear and Angie and I were left to have a heart to heart. We talked about our families in general, the deaths of loved ones, and trying to live up to high standards our siblings have made for us. It really felt good to get somethings out and to know that someone has experienced or felt some of same things I have in my life. Of course we cried but it was good to cry. Robbie called shortly after to tell me he made it to Buckhannon safely and was going to work on a project. I hope it went well babe. Shortly after I hung up the phone with him......Steph Brenner runs in the room and tells us we have to listen to something. It was a song Matty had written for her when she was going through a hard time in her life and it was beautiful. We actually got him to play the song live along with 2 or 3 beautiful lullabies in Nellie Wilson. I really don't think I stopped crying the entire time because so many thoughts were running through my head. The night ended beautifully even though I was upset. I love the empowering sense music can have on me. Thank you Matt Wing for the talk after your talented friend mesmorized me. I miss you friend and we definately have to hang out more. 


Well today I got my clinical eval by Mrs. Smith. I was a little nervous but everyone was getting As. I did in fact get an A but I'm still a little upset by some of the comments she had for me. I feel like no matter what I do its not good enough for her. I would treat my patients and then sit and talk with them for hours while others just stood in the hallway. One day she had to yell at me to quit talk wit the pt and his family because she was ready for post conference. Sometimes I just feel like I put my all into things and then get nothing in return. Maybe I'm just being selfish. But its not like I wanted a 100 because I'm not perfect..noone is but I just wanted her to say you did really well."

"event","So many things have been going through my mind lately but I will just post about the funeral for now because well frankly I'm exhausted. I was kind of nervous about the funeral today because I've only broken down once and I was afraid it was going to happen in front of people and that bothers me for some reason. Well we had visitation again for an hr before the service so it was nice to get more hugs. Well I was doing pretty good because I keep thinking how much grandmother suffered and now she is with Jesus, her husband, and all her loved ones that went before her. At some point near the end of visitation, I went up to see grandmother with my 5 yr old Neice Katie, 7 yr old nephew Ben, and my sister. When we got to the casket I noticed my neice had pictures in her hand. She had drawn pictures of she and grandmother and wanted Grandmother to have them. If this wasn't emotional enough, my nephew says to Katie, this will be the last time we see her so tell her goodbye. Well my neice replies by saying ""No Ben! We will see her again in heaven."" I completely lost it. Katie is so intelligent and wise beyond her years that it completely blows me away sometimes. 

About the funeral itself....
My pastor did an absolutely incredible job with the funeral at church and the mini service at the cemetary. It was very good for me to be reminded of the incredible woman my grandmother was and how many lives she touched. Pastor David told the family today that he considers my grandfather and grandmother to be saints. They were both amazing individuals who I love and will miss very much but I'm so happy they are united and at peace. I feel so privileged and honored to have 2 sets of absolutely incredible grandparents. I know that I now have some incredible angels on my side.


Sorry that my thoughts are so scrambled. I want to thank my amazing friends again for being available 24/7 if I needed you...all my love!!


Mr. Willams so glad you are ok but I hope the pain decreases some. Thank you for always making me smile and being wonderful."

I was getting kind of emotional after the vball loss and just thinking about my grandmother so I decided it was time to head home. Some of my girls were getting ready to compete for 3rd place but I managed to catch Julie before she got on the court and I got the biggest huge of my life. I turn around and start to walk away when my sisters just start a hugging line. It was so amazing to me to have all my sisters hugging me and telling me if I needed anything at all to call them. I sort of ran out of the gym because I didn't want anyone to see the stream of tears running down my face. I really don't know what I would do without those girls. I've gotten so many emails, ims, and hugs from them that its incredible. I'm so lucky to be blessed with 78 sisters who are incredible. You all have gotten me through everything so far and words can't express how much you have helped and touched my life! Much ZLAM

After I got ready I went to the mall to return something and look for some new shirts or anything. It really amazes me how many people from high school I've seen since I've been home for break. I always manage to see the ones that I never really cared to see again though but oh well. As for clothes, I bought a very cute shirt that I'm absolutely in love with so get ready to see it a lot this Spring and Summer. I'm not really sure what I'm posting about but just felt the need. I do need advice, help, or just to talk about a certain subject matter. Most of you know that my good friend Patrick Cunningham died my senior year. It was a major event in my life and I've had a lot of problems emotionally dealing with it. He died November 16, 2002 and yet I'm still having some issues. I dealt with a lot of the major problems I was having the first several months after he died but I'm still hanging on to a few. I know its normal to miss him and I would never ever think of trying to block him out of my memory because thats not fair or possible. Maybe what I'm feeling is normal but I just get so sad sometimes thinking about what an amazing person he would be and the wonderful life he would be leading right now. I get so sad around his bday (April 11) and in November just thinking about him and what his parents and sister must be feeling. I went to his grave today and thought it would help to just be there for a bit and it did but I still can't manage to let go completely. Someone please help me...should I still be feeling things like this or should some of it be gone? I'm sorry for getting down all of a sudden but its just something I struggle with a lot and I've tried to hide it but I can't do it anymore. I'm going to pray about it too and see what happens. Thank you for listening."

"event","Its amazing what a few days home will do to you. I started reading my old diaries and comments people signed in my books during high school the other night. It amazes me how much I have changed over the years but mostly since my senior year in high school. I've started to care more about my dreams, goals, and the future verses boys and my body image. Not only has my mind set changed but my friends have as well. People would always tell me that my friends would change drastically once I was away at college and I never really believe them until now. Some of them I really miss but others I really think I learned what I could from them and its time to move on. I do miss the closeness of my youth group and church, working on the newspaper with Mrs. Hale, all the girls and our guy Ryan, and yes sadly I miss the crazy times in Show Choir with my boys Lee and Deakin. =) It was so nice to talk to the girls and catch up last night even if it was until 5 am. I'm glad that I still have those 4 (Amy, Katie,Lysh,April) and my best friend in the world Ashley. I just hope I can be half the friend to them as they have been to me. I've accepted that things are gonna change : my friends, relationships, classes, and my activites but I'm ready to face them head on and I just hope that my true friends will be there at the end to see me through. 

For all you seniors out there live these last few wks or months up and enjoy your friends because sooner or later things are going to start to change and you won't even realize until its happened. So go chase your dreams and have a little fun while you are at it.

Not talking 'bout a year. No not three or four. I don't want that kind of forever, in my life anymore. Forever always seems to be around when things begin. But forever never seems to be around when things end.  Ben Harper"

Me: if they ask me what skills i have..im gonna freak
Me: seriously
Me: i will be like ummm NOTHING
Megan: no no no 
Megan:say 
Megan: ""i can wipe peoples butts""


Me: they will probably ask me stupid questions like why do you want to be a nurse
Megan: yeah 
Megan: and you will say 
Megan: ""i LOVE cleaning bedpans""

After the party, I went to the Pancake festival with my dad and my sister's family! Yummy!! Today was my neice's bday so Mom and I took her to see Suessical, the Musical! It was very good but really long and it caused me to miss a VIP phone call which really upsets me! I just hope your having fun babe..I miss you!

I can't explain to you how awesome these girls are and how excited that they are now my sisters. Saturday was Jump which is one of my favorite days out of the year. We have a tradition of cooking the Theta Chi boys food and just hanging out until Jump which is always fun. For those of you that don't go to Wesleyan I don't think JUMP can be explained. Basically, the Fraternity boys have their new pledges run down the sidewalk jump into the them and they pull them over this wall thing. All the fraternities and sororities are there screaming their chants and just having fun. Its glorious!! The parties that night are always soo awesome! Of course I pregamed a little bit and went to my favorite fratnerity house..Theta Xi. I love those boys! I spent the night dancing and hanging out around the house and had so much fun as usual. The night also ended very well but we will leave it at that. I just want to thank my friends for being amazing and always bringing a smile to my face. You all mean so much to me its unreal.  To my incredible ZTA sisters and the sweet 16: you all rock my world and lift me up when you don't even know it! Thanks for everything!!!!  Bestest-I miss you so much! 

Gonna leave you all with a quote from an awesome song.
Well I hope I see you later
'Cause it's time for me to go
Someone just pulled over
Sure was good to know you
Go answer your calling 
Go and fill somebody's cup
And if you see an angel falling
Won't you stop and help them up
 
'Cause we are each other's angels
And we meet when it is time
We keep each other going
And we show each other signs
Sometimes you will stumble
Sometimes you might fall down
Sometimes you will get lonely
When there's nobody around
You might shiver when the wind blows
And you might get blown away
You might even lose your colors"

After Awhile You Learn...
The subtle difference between holding a hand and chaining a soul.
And you learn..That kisses aren't contracts and presents aren't promises.
And you begin to accept your defeats with your head up and your eyes ahead; with the grace of an adult, not the grief of a child.
And you learn to build all your roads on today because tommorow's ground is too uncertain for plans, and futures have a way of falling down in mid flight.
After awhile you learn..That even sunshine burns if you get too much. So you plant your own garden and decorate your own soul instead of waiting on someone to bring you flowers.
And you learn...
That you really can endure, that you really are strong, and you really do have worth.
And you learn..
And you learn..
With every goodbye, you learn."

We did dosage calculations the entire time..reminder I hate math and I'm horrible at it. Well as soon as she gave us our problems to practice I was almost in tears because things like that just don't click in my brain. Well that emotion went away real fast as we all did problems on the board. My professor is crazy. She basically told us that even if we had answers right..if we didn't the work exactly like we should then it would be wrong. What the hell? What a biotch. I think the whole class was pissed off. I'm so sick of the bs in the dept. I mean I love nursing as a whole but some of the bs that goes on is ridiculous. If I didn't think this was what I'm meant to do then I would be done. Agh... Other than that nothing is really going on. I've accomplished just about nothing this week except working out with Meg! Thanks Megan for putting up with me and my klutziness!!!

I don't like leaving my family and friends because I miss them so much while I'm gone. I wasn't ready to go back to the drama and the classes. I realized tonight after having a not so great evening that Wesleyan is my present life, everything occurs there and I'm there most of the year. Huntington is my past and for the most part my future. Sure I'm here for the holidays and summers but for the most part my life is at Wesleyan. I hate to say that but its true. I have made some of the greatest friends of my life at Wesleyan and so many of my major experiences were there. I'm not saying that my family isn't a HUGE part of my life because they are but ya know my life is at school. I feel like I distance myself from everyone at home because I'm so scared of getting more attached and just having to leave in a few days or weeks. Its so hard to explain. I'm starting to forget who the real Leslie is. I need to bring her back wherever she is. Does anyone ever feel like this or understand?! Maybe..I'm just crazy right now.

Bestest-You have made my time here great! I love all the crazy times we have together! At timese it seems like I've never left and I'm very grateful for that. Thank you for being my best and truest friend. I love ya pretty!

Oh so I just wanted to comment on some of the Huntington population and how weird and rude they can be at times. I was walking down the sidewalk with my dad and stepmom after Finding Neverland. We look up and a bunch of guys in this car start whistling and yelling how hot I was. If things weren't bad enough since my dad was standing right there one yelled ""Hey! I fucked her one night too!"" How rude is that. Especially since my Dad was right there. Actually they are glad they were moving fast or I think my dad would have kicked the shit out of them. I was so embarassed. Not only was that demeaning to me but hello be respectful. I didn't mind the comments about how hot I was as much as the I fucked her one. I was about to be like in your dreams asshole but I didn't. Ahh well enough of my ranting.

My family and I are leaving for Richmond, Va tommorow. My cousin is getting married on Sat (New Years Day..how cute) so we are getting an early start tommorow. Please pray for us while we travel and for my cousin and her fiancee. Have a HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE!!!!!"

I'm so lucky to be alive and have such a wonderful family and friends!!!"

I think my best Christmas gift this year was being able to take Molly to the Christmas Eve Candle light service. I just thank God everyday that she is alive. She looks so good now. She is so strong and I only wish I had has much strength she has. Once again I thank you all for all the prayers and encouragement! God is good..all the time!! Cherish life because you only have one chance on this Earth! 

Oh and when I get smart enough to post a music clip on here I will. Mark McVey and his wife sang O Holy Night at the service. They both sing on Broadway but Mark's voice really takes me breath away."

I don't know whats wrong with me. I just wish someone could like me for me and I wish I could love myself again. I just want things to go back....

Please pray while i take care of my grandmother from 7am to 3pm tommorow! Its so emotionally hard and some of the workers aren't the greatest."

"event","Wow! My aunt told me this story about Molly tonight. I have to give some background before I begin but honestly read this. My 2nd cousin Donnie, 52, died my senior year (03. My cousin Molly was very fond and close to him. Donnie's father, Bill, died about a year before Donnie and Molly was also very fond of him too.

So the first night Molly was in the hospital, the nurses told my aunt that Molly had been very rude at one point. Well when my aunt Lillian asked Molly why she was mad she had this story to tell.

Well Mom they interrupted me. 
Lillian: What do you mean?
Moly: Well, I was talking to Donnie. I also saw Bill who was just smiling at me. Donnie kept telling me that I wasn't allowed to come yet because it was too early. 
Lillian: What do you mean Molly, where couldn't you go?
Molly: Donnie said it wasn't my time to go to heaven.

I am seriously blown away by this story. Life is a miracle.

Update on Molly: First off, Happy 21st Bday Molly! She looked so much better tonight compared to Thurs afternoon. She was very alert and talked as best as she could. She is back in Huntington and is going to have surgery on her tongue, jaw, and eye socket tommorow morning. She seems to be doing better expect she is having some pain. Her jaw will have to be wired shut for 4wks so it can have time to heal. She still really needs your prayers, especially for her surgery. 

She doesn't remember the accident at all which is a blessing. I just hope she doesn't have post traumatic stress later on down the road. The guy who hit her is being very nice and even brought flowers for her bday. Well this is all I have for now. Thank you for the continued support."

"event","Well I have some sad news. My cousin Molly was hit by a car last night in Morgantown on the way to take her final. I was very worried last night especially since she suffered facial and head trauma. I went to see her today after my final. She looks better than I expected but she does have bruises and lacerations everywhere. She is going to be transported to Huntington once she is stable to have surgery which is good. While I was there she was heavily medicated but she did perk up and talk to me some. It felt good to use my nursing skills to help her. I'm just so happy she is alive and didn't suffer any brain problems. I'm still very worried about her emotional and psychological state especially when she realizes what is happening. I was in the room when my aunt told her she needed facial surgery and she just cried and asked for the best. All I could do was hold her hand and fight back the tears. Please pray for Molly and my family. I'm still in shock but very happy I still have my Molly. Thanks to everyone who helped me get through last night. I'm so lucky to have such supportive friends. Sam D-I couldn't ask for a better cousin, I love you! Megan Jones if you read this..You mean more to me than words..I really really appreciate all the ims and the phone calls..mucho ZLAM!

On a positive note, I am finally home!! So htowners get ahold of me!!!

Here are the grades I know I am getting so far!
Chem-B which is awesome considering I thought much worse
Lang and Principles of Nursing-88 B...So happy but still wish I had gotten 2 more percent points for an A but hey a B isn't bad!!!!"

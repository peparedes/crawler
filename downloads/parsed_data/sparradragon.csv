By default ljfind removes journals that have been deleted from livejournal. We also do not index journals that have the flag ""limit journals inclusion in search engines set"" from now on.

For people with journals already indexed who wish them removed please simply post a new public post to your journal. You must have the flag set in your account that limits your journals inclusion in search engines.

Within 48 hours this should be removed from our index. Once your journal has been removed you can remove your post and your journal will remain unindexed.

Thankyou and sorry for the delay in releasing this functionality"

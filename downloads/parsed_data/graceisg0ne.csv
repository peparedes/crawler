"event","Punk. The first thing that comes to my mind is mohawks and plaid. and in my eyes that is wrong. Not wrong in the sence that punks shouldnt wear mohawks or plaid or what not just wrong because punk should not be thought of as a fashion statement. I wasnt alive to know for sure but i think that origionally punks were people who just did not care. People who did not try to live up to the standards that sociaty set for them. People who went against what was considered normal and right. Punk is also defined by music. I would have to say that Buddy Holly was the begining of rocknroll which eventually led to punk. But just look how every thing about rocknroll and punk have changed. I asked my mom, who was in a past life (the 60's) was a hippie, why she was one. i was hoping to get some deep anwser about the econimey or about nature or the war or something but all she said was "" i dont really remember i think i just did it because it seemed like everyone was"". I have alwasy considered my parents some what cool to have of been hippies but to hear my mother say that was more then a dissapointment. i have always admired punks. I have always found the way they dress and are influenced by music to be fascinating. In my family i have my two sisters and my brother. My sisters are lovers of gap and expensive name brand things and poptype music and they are people who believe that money in a sence can buy happiness. I remember watching movies with punks in them when i was little with my sisters and hearing them laugh at the punks and look down at them. like we would be driving in our car and  pass some one dressed in ripped tights and wearing black eye make up and they would stare and ask eachother why some one would want to dress like that and present themselves like that. i would always think in my mind because of people like you. because of people that judge others by apperance. my sister who went to college this year was worried that she might have a punk as her roommate. and i thought that this was one of the stupidest things ive ever witnessed. why would someone not want to get to know a person based only on the music they listened to and they way they dressed?

Its hard not having anyone understand you. I dont really know what im trying to proove by writing this. Its no more then a bunch of mixed thoughts and feelings about punk and society and teens today. Its just that i feel that the true meaning of punk was lost by society years ago. I have always had a strong sence of who i am and who i want to be. ever since elementary school i have found it to be admirable when people know who they are and when people dont try to dress a certain way or be a certain way. 

I dont want to say it but my school is seperated by social groups. its not that bad, as bad as it could be. and i guess its like that at everyschool.. but i dont know it just annoys me. all of my friends basically dress the same way. well not all of them because i have a lot of different friends in a lot of different ""groups"". but my closest friends, in my grade they all basically dress the same way. they all in there own way resemble someone you would see in a fashion magizne. i just think what would happen if we didnt have fashion magiznes or television or anything to base ourselves on or judge others on and its crazy to think about how different everyone would be. 

i know that what i wrote might be really confusing becasue i didnt really stay and follow one subject and im sorry that if you didnt agree with what i said... im not trying to put anyone down because of the way they dress. this is just my opinion and i would love to hear what you think of what i wrote. and i am NOT saying that i am necessarly right. sorry but i have to say all this becasue last time i expressed my opinion like this.. a lot of people got mad at me and told me i was wrong. so please take the meaning of opinion into consideration. opinion my own personal belief.  lol okay im done now."

"event","This is a fair request and i promise i will not judge any person only as a teenager. If you will constantly remind yourself that some of my generation judges people by their race, their belief, or the color of their skin and that this is no more right than saying all teenagers are drunken dope addicts or glue sniffers.

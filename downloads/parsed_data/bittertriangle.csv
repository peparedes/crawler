<br>
I finished writing my Greek &amp; Roman Studies paper, just about to
give it one final proof-reading before I call it done, and call it a
night.&nbsp; This is actually really great, it's the first time in
about a month that I can actually say that the end is in sight.&nbsp;
I've just got to read Oedipus Rex for tomorrow and do a cell bio
assignment and then I'm done.<br>
<br>
I had my organic chem midterm last night, which went really well, I
think.&nbsp; It was really good to get it done and I went for coffee
(well tea) at Higher Grounds with Jenn, Haley, and Nicole.&nbsp; (Get
an account, lurker!)&nbsp; That was really fun, and a great way to unwind after
a <span style=""font-style: italic;"">really</span> stressful night.<br>
<br>
I'm still not sure what I'm going to do for my birthday as it sounds
like the weekends around the end of the month are fairly booked up, but
I'm sure I'll find some time and figure out something.<br>
<br>
Had a conversation with <lj user=""tapdancingfool"" /> on the way to drop off my
banking info at work (again, this is the third time now... what does my
bank have against letting me actually use my account ... *grumble*)
about relationships, and whether or not there's one right person out
there you just click perfectly with.&nbsp; Kind of gets you to
thinking, I suppose, but I'm still too pessimistic to think that there
is one person who is made for you out there and it's just a matter of
finding them.&nbsp; Oh well, maybe now that I have some free time I can
start looking again.<br>
<br>
Anyway, it's late and I'm barely coherent, so I should go to bed.<br>
<br>
Ciao!<br>

"event","Well, my biochem midterm is over. I'm actually feeling pretty
not-too-bad about it, which is suprising, given how little time I had
to study for it. Now all I have to do is tie up some loose ends I've
been dragging my feet on and study for my organic chem midterm.<br>
<br>
All things considered, this week isn't actually looking too bad; after
Wednesday I'm essentially home free. God I'm looking forward to that,
this past week has just been, in a word, hellish.
Anyway, I met up with <lj user=""geneticalopera"" />
after the midterm and went to Steeps after the exam, it was a really
good end to the day, especially given how stressed we both were because
of the exam.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I should get to bed, relaxed as I am, it's not over just yet.<br>"

"event","Wow, it's been a while since I posted something new. I suppose that in
a stressful situation I shouldn't cut out one of my tension outlets
first, but that's just how it goes sometimes.<br>
<br>
I totally stayed up too late last night trying to get my chem
assignment done, and ended up sleeping through my alarm, meaning that I
missed my first class (A cell bio tutorial, the first one I've missed
all semester, which is surprising given that it's at 8 AM.) as well as
the two hours I set aside to finish said chem assignment. Oh well, I
suppose that it is better to have gotten some of it done than none at
all, and besides, it's only 2% of my grade.<br>
<br>
It could just be nerves, but it seems that I've been feeling pretty icky since the end of reading week, which is
odd; without fail I always get sick during, not after vacations. I
think that the stress is definitely getting to most of us, and I know
we're feeling it. That said, freedom is only two months away.&nbsp; And
my final exam schedule is actually pretty good for once.<br>
<br>
Wow, I just realised I only have four weeks left until I turn 20. I
should be more excited. Or is this when I start dreading them? I'm
pretty blah on the matter.
Kris, thanks again for the oscar party! It totally kicked ass.

"event","It's odd, I wasn't feeling too bad for most of today, but since I got home I've just felt like death. Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration, but it feels like I'm getting a little bit of a flu bug or something.  I really hope that I don't; that would be just wonderful, getting behind in a semester that I'm already feeling like I'm just keeping up with. At least it'd help me drop a bit of the extra baggage I picked up over Christmas break.  No, I'm kidding.

I think the weather changed at the right time.  As much as I liked the weather, (no, seriously.) it was starting to get a bit cold, even for me.  I'm just hoping that it gets nice and stays nice so that the snow all melts away, not just leaving little slush-puddles (or big ones, for that matter) all over the place.

If anyone wants to see Kinsey, an evening showing, call me or drop me a line here.  I guess that the weekend matinees don't really work so well with my schedule.  Oh well, that's life.  Thanks for dropping in to see me, guys.  Honestly, sunday afternoon shifts are so boring, you have no idea.

Anyway, my amino acid flash cards are calling my name.

Ciao."

"event","Wow, it's just dawning on me how much work this semester is going to be.  Especially considering I'm actually going to work. <i>No comments from the peanut gallery, thank you.</i>  I've got twenty amino acids to memorize for my first test, in three weeks.  Three weeks! January isn't the time for tests.  Oh well, I suppose I should get to studying then.  But not just yet.

My god, supplies are expensive.  I've spent about $80 already, and I haven't even bought a textbook yet.  Oh well, c'est la vie.

Classes don't start until 12:30 for me tomorrow, thank god. I don't think I'll be able to deal with 8:00 classes.  Meh, I'm sure I'll be able to cope.

Who had said something about seeing Kinsey? I'd totally be up if anyone wants to see it."

"event","God, why are my co-workers completely incapable of doing their jobs? Last night I was working and found out that the morning staff haven't been rotating the salads we've been getting from the kitchen - rather than using older salads before using the new ones, they've just been using the new ones as they come in, letting old stock pile up in the back. I had to clean out the entire cooler and ended up throwing out about 15 lbs of salad because it had all expired.  I hope that they like fruit salad, because that's all they've got for today and probably tomorrow.

And of course, tonight is the staff meeting.  The new supervisor apparently has a ""list"" of ideas, but given that they're all recycled concepts that didn't work the first time around, I don't really have high hopes.  (Also detracting from my expectations is the fact that she's supposed to be responsible for rotating the salads, see above.)  I'm sure that the salad issue is going to come up, and I really don't want to be the bogeyman here, but that is one of the maybe three things that they're responsible for.

Am I too self absorbed in thinking that the only people who do their jobs here are the ones I helped train or trained myself?  Probably, but that's how it looks from here.

Anyway, I think I needed to get that out of my system, now to relax for tomorrow.  I'm betting that I'll end up sleeping in through my first lecture, though I really don't want to.  Oh well, fingers crossed.

"event","Well, every year I decide that New Year's resolutions are not worth the time, and every year I end up making at least two, both completely unrealistic, and this year is no different.  I have decided that this year, I will start a blog, because I don't have enough in my life already, and need more commitment.

So, hello everyone, and welcome to my hole in the web, and with no further ado...

It's hard to believe that the new year is only 9 days old, and already it seems as though nothing has changed.  I suppose that it has only been 9 days, and that I shouldn't expect rapid and immediate change like this, but then again I'm all about unreasonable expectations, especially regarding new beginnings. For god's sakes, it's 2005.  The flying cars and self-cleaning homes are five long years overdue and I won't stand for it.  Not that I'll do anything about it; I suppose that I'll just remain bitter and snarky.

Cheers!

Pat"

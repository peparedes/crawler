"event","wow, I havent wrote in this thing in AGES! I was reading through some friends' ljs and decided to crack this thing open, let the bats fly out and write something. 
What is new in my life? 
   Well, I turn 19 on wednesday!! woohoo
And my rsd is almost completely gone!!! My doctor is a miracle worker. Because of him, I dont have to go out to minnesota to the mayo clinic. I'm down from 10+ vicodin to one or two. It's such a great feeling being able to do things now. I'm not 100% better.. there are still somethings that bother it, like blow drying my hair, having it raised too long, stuff like that. But im not complaining. I havent been this happy in so long. Well except for when I met jeff.

Jeff. He's a year above me, and went to FHS. He was captain of the hockey team. I met him after I graduated at the kennel, where i work, on brickyard. 

well , I'm going to have to finish this later because i am going out with jen (hodge)

au revoir =o)"

"event","yesterday was an absolutly b-e-a-utiful day. And I got my first ride on a harley! My cousine Debbie took me out. It was amazing, I loved it. 

Then today, I wasn't feeling too hot so I went home early and just slept. I felt better when I wokeup though. ThenI brought the cox boxes to practice, and I didn't want to stay at the mead so I decided to go hang out with the boys practice and talked with Jesse a bunch.

right now I am at CCSU helping my sis. Im spending the night here. I have to help her draw some stuff. She says we'll probably be up until like 3 in the morning, but thats alright.

Im so sick of school. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm sick of the people at school. I just want to meet new people who arent immature and wont harass me about  my RSD, like the people in this hell hole.

I miss hayley so much.. I wish Matt wasn;t being such an ass about this whole thing.. *sigh...* :( such a bummer..

I need to go draw now..

I'm so unbelievably sore from that doctor's appointment today. Argh. And my neck is super stiff x12039743586. It kills

I've missed so much school because of doctor appointments. Especially math. I don't understand what we're doing and there was a test on the stuff on friday. So I'm screwed. 

saturday night I'm going down to coventry to go to my aunts house. we're opening christmas presents. And then sunday, it's christmas for me and my family.

It was bothering me last night and I kept tossing and turning. I'm bringing my pillow in the car with me tomorrow morning, and going to attempt to fall asleep. But usally once I'm up and showered, or atleast up, I can't fall asleep. Maybe this time will be different. I need to find my disc man, my dads going to use the GPS talking navigation. that voice annoys the hell out of me. I'm missing all of school tomorrow. And then I have another doctors appointment at 3. After that I'm going back to school though to practice. So I can let Dr B know about what was said/done/wants to be done. And of course tell Chris. My neck is quite stiff. It needs to be stretched out desperatly.Maybe I'll just go in my room and watch a movie. 

I'm really nervous about tomorrow. I need to stop. I'm going to make myself sick I'm worrying so much.

That means I have to get up at like 4:30/4:45. Joyous. Hopefully I won't need any needles. I'm sore from the cold weather. I can't wait til florida. I can't wait to get away from people. Mainly the people that still continue to mock me and talk crap about my arm and say I'm making excuses for everything. What part of stop don't they understand. Whatever..karma.. what comes around goes around. 

I wanted to see Chris today after my doctors appointments to tell him what was said, and since I won't be in school tomorrow. Plus I'm really scared. But that didn't happen. I wish I could put him in a suitcase and bring him with me to Florida.

"event","Went to a portion of the basketball game with chris last night, then we went out to dinner with my parents. Afterwards we came back to my house and watched Lord of the rings because it was on tv.

 A lot of people at school are sick or starting to get sick. I'm starting to get sick and my moms loading me up on cold stuff to make that not happen. My head hurts, but this time its not from stress. 

we got a new car. A nissan murano. I get to take it after 3 today.

My arm hurts. 

I'm so sick of people. No, let me rephrase that, a certain group of people at my school. I have Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD). I am <font size=""6""> NOT </font> making this up. Many of you, have NEVER asked me anything about this. None of you have ever even looked up things. Why don't you ask me about it instead of mocking me. You have absolutly no right to say that I am faking this. You have no idea what it is like to live with RSD. The constant throbbing pain, the feeling of your hand being on fire, someone scrapping your bones out with a spoon, a jagged nail through your shoulder, and everything else I feel. Or to lose function in your arm for a day, few days, a week, etc. You have no idea of the torture I go through. The countless Stellate Ganglion Blocks (needle)in the front of my neck, and the epideral needle I got in the back of my neck, where I could hear my cartilidge rip. And let me tell you, it wasn't pretty. Or the EMG where they SHOCKED my nerves. None of you have the right to saw I am faking. Just because you can't see it , like a broken arm with a cast, doesn't mean I'm faking it. <font size=""5"">We are in HIGH SCHOOL. Not middle school. Grow the fuck up.</font>

"event","I left shool at 10:30 today. My head was pounding and I just felt really crummy. So I slept for about 2 and 1/2 hours before my MRI. The MRI was alrite I guess. I had to get dye injected into my good arm. I could feel coldness going up my arm as it spread. It fell out of my arm, the first time because my arm twitched, so they had to put it in my hand. That hurt. They gave me sesame street bandaids. 

my throat was bothering me earlier, it still is, but not that bad.

I wanted to go see Chris after my MRI, but that didn't end up happening =( Hopefully I can spend time with him this weekend.

and I'm supposed to be finishing my ghost story, but that's not happening. I'm going to attempt to get as much of it done tonight as possible, and finish it in 2nd, 4th, 5th and 7th period and just give it to her after school. I just have to find out what tiem she will be after til. 

Manda's birthday dinner is tomorrow night. But I have no money, so I dont see the point of me going. I mean I want to, but it would be kind of stupid for me to go to a restaurant and not eat.  And then Amanda wants me to help her keep score at the jv basketball game which starts t 5:30. I might I don't know. Depends how I feel. Hopefully I won't have an awful head ache tomorrow. I have to remember to bring in fake flowers, 4 paper plates, forks, napkins, knives and cups for out skit in Psych. We're doing a project for defense mechanisms. The setting is in a restaurant, I'm representing denial, so I'm this big huge druggy/drunk. Steph is compensation, Andrew is Identification and Alicia is day dreaming/fantasy. Should be fun. But I get really shy presenting things in front of people. Unless I know them. And I really don't know the people in my psych class except for a few people, like Kim. 

My parents are picking up the murano tomorrow. I get to drive it to school on monday. and another day when my car goes into the shop to get new tires.

ok I reallllly need to finish that ghost story.  and maybe look for some info on the JFK assassination for forensics after.

"event","I just found this, through some random thing on livejournal, and I'm bored so why not?


Step One

- Make a post (public, friendslocked, filtered...whatever you're comfortable with) to your LJ. The post should contain your list of 10 holiday wishes. The wishes can be anything at all, from simple and fandom-related (""I'd love a Snape/Hermione icon that's just for me"") to medium (""I wish for _____ on DVD"") to really big (""All I want for Christmas is a new car/computer/house/TV."") The important thing is, make sure these wishes are things you really, truly want.

- If you wish for real life things (not fics or icons), make sure you include some sort of contact info in your post, whether it's your address or just your email address where Santa (or one of his elves) could get in touch with you.

- Also, make sure you post some version of these guidelines in your LJ, or link to this post (it'll be public) so that the holiday joy will spread.

Step Two 

- Surf around your friendslist (or friendsfriends, or just random journals) to see who has posted their list. And now here's the important part:

- If you see a wish you can grant, and it's in your heart to do so, make someone's wish come true. Sometimes someone's trash is another's treasure, and if you have a leather jacket you don't want or a gift certificate you won't use--or even know where you could get someone's dream purebred Basset Hound for free--do it.

You needn't spend money on these wishes unless you want to. The point isn't to put people out, it's to provide everyone a chance to be someone else's holiday elf--to spread the joy. Gifts can be made anonymously or not--it's your call.

There are no rules with this project, no guarantees, and no strings attached. Just...wish, and it might come true. Give, and you might receive. And you'll have the joy of knowing you made someone's holiday special.



<font size=""4"">My wish list</font>(no perticular order)
01. star stuff
02. gift certificate to blue moon to buy pretty jewelry.
03. stuffed animal(s)
04. snowflake necklace
05. Charmed DVD seasons box sets (there is 7 in total)
06. a pigmy goat =)

"event","yesterday was amazing. I spent over 9 hours with Chris. We went to the meridan mall to go shopping and got a few christmas gifts. Then we thought of something to get Eric, and went to westfarms, but they didnt have it. Hopefully they get it in soon. Then we went back to my house and waited for my moms christmas party to start. I was really dizzy though, so we just stayed on the couch for a bit. then people finally started arriving around 7ish. Then at somepoint Kel, Sam, Val, Chris and I started to play disney monopoly, and my mom and her friends were playing some game where a bunch of words sounded like a real one, like, yell opa chess (yello pages) it was something like that. they were so loud. every time they would scream and cheer,we would do the same thing and say opa really loud. But we got bored of the game, Chris won, and then Sara and Ash got there. After they left me and chris went into the living room and turned off the lights so the xmas tree illuminated the room and we fell asleep on the couch . But then he couldnt fall back to sleep after my mom and sis woke us up to ask us where a game was. Apparently my body was twitching a lot. He's comfy. I haven't slept that good in so long. He was running his fingers through my hair and I passed out

I kept waking up this morning and going back to sleep. I woke up at 8, then again at 9:15, then at 10:37 and then finally at 11 I got out of bed and jsut sat in my room.

oops, i forgot to feed my fishy.hes cute, when you pick up the fish food, he'll start swimming wicked fast around and around his bowl. Silly fish.

////supposed to be working on my ghost story, but I dont have the energy to write it, and my elbows a bit sore. supposed to get snow tomorrow and freezing rain at night.

I'm in the mood to wrap the christmas gifts I got yesterday. I still need to get my brothers and another one for someone. I should look on ebay.


ok welll time to go search ebay for random things.

I heard that movie got horrible reviews and wasnt scary at all, we were screaming! And the guys were laughing at us! Me and Signa had our hoods up and kept pulling the neck part where the strings are above our eyes, Mindy saw it so she wasnt phased, Jen was hiding under her hoodie, plugging her ears lol, and courtney latched onto sarahs arm. We were laughing our asses off during the previews, We were probably those obnoxious teenagers you wanna kill at the movies lol. That movie was so weird and creepy!! We went back to Jens house adn watched hucules =)

I need medication, my arm hurts. Physical therapy on tuesday, 3:30.i have my MRI thursday at 2:30, some doctors appointment up in boston at some point, a doctor appt with dr bluth on the 22nd. WHo knows what else. I know its all before the 23rd, thats when I leave for florida.

He thinks maybe it's my brachial plexus so he's going to have me get another MRI. What is this, number 8 or 9? Maybe 10? Its still hurts when I take deep breaths. And my arm still feels weak. It hurts to type with this hand. So  I'll resort to typing with one. Amanda was so sad today, I felt horrible for her, along with everyone else. And ryan, I didn't even read your damn livejournal, Amanda told me. And when we do talk about what you wrote, SHE'S ALREADY READ IT.

i'm scared about tomorrow. i feel my eyes begin to burn and fill up with tears everytime i think about it. i had a conversation about it with him. he was saying he wouldn't do anything that would hurt me, but the only problem is, we don't know if it will make things worse til its too late. apparently the surgeon I'm going to knows about the same amount on rsd as dr kost does. scared.. nervous.

Then I went to the mall and I was walkign along and I'm looking and I see this person and I just kind of stop walking and start staring, and they do the same. It was Jen!! We're such losers, at the mall by ourselves hehe.So we walked around, did some shopping. She found something for amanda's bday/xmas gift. I didn't find anything yet.  I'm going to the westbrook outlets tomorrow so hopefully I can get my xmas shopping done. but I'm not sure what exactly people want. Or who's buying me things. I hate when people buy me things and I don't have something for them. I feel bad. For a few people I'm getting them things while I'm down in Florida. 

so I'm bored. I have nothing to do. Marc's party isn't until 6:30. Jen and I wanted to buy him some gag gifts, but we don't have a Spencers at our mall, crummy thing. So we sort of got him a gag gift. It's amusing, well, atleast to us because we're losers. I need to return the movie chris and I watched yesterday. I want to hang out with him too.

Forensics was interesting, we're doing a thing on the kennedy assassination.

{after school} i stayed after with chris and amanda. chris had to go get help with bio, and I went with Amanda to her LAX meeting. I wouldn't mind managing LAX, but i don't think I could manage two teams. Too bad it wasn't a winter sport. Then we kinda of stood around the school, and he kept tickling me.[inappropriate ;)] damn ticklishness. I got him back slightly, so it was all good. he makes the cutest faces when he gets tickled. And he attempted to fit in my locker.

[wednesday] !half day! that makes me so incredibly estatic &hearts; hanging out with chris and possibly amy and steve. wonder what we will do.

[thursday]thanksgiving. eating with my family, then going over to chris', then coming back here (hopefully) so he can meet some of my family.

i need to stop procrastinating and get back to my ghost story.."

"event","just got back from chris' boyscout cookout thing. I'm cold. And someone in a red truck drove through a murky puddle..and all the spray hit me. It got the back of my jeans really bad. 

My arm is hurting. i should be reading frankenstein since i have a assessment on chapters 1-8 tomorrow. I was reading, then chris called.Now I'm just not in the mood.

Kel, Sam, Val, Em and me went to meridan mall yesterday. we went in two different cars. me and em went off on our own. i got two shirts from american eagle. one is green and says vixen's lounge and has 2 martini glasses on the front and 44 on the back and the other is purple and pink (i think) striped with a 5 on it. and then we went to hollister and I bought a shirt that says green eyed goddess. then at night I watched what lies beneath with emily. then we all stayed up til maybe 3:30/3:45, woke up at 10. And just lounged around until they left around 12ish."

"event","I didnt end up going to my thing at Uconn. My dad cancelled it. And whats even more pecular..when he called to ask to talk to the guy who I was supposed to met with, didn't exist. Very odd...

So me and Jen went to the mall. We went to victoria secret and she bought some stuff. That girl could buy out that entire store. Except for that $120 thing we saw. Then we had chicken fingers for dinner and left. She bouhgt me a flower =) from NHS, and I didn't buy her one, I feel bad. So im going to go out later tonite and buy her one, or maybe a small bouquet. 

My arm is quite sore. My doctor is almost convinced that the problem is with my nevres (thank you captain obvious) and he increased my neurontin, so bye bye memory. If I call you bob or sally, I'm apologizing in advance. My necks stiff, it needs to be stretched out. I have physical therapy next week.

Emily might be coming to school with me tomorrow. I got pandiscio to sign the thing, so hopefully she will. that is, if her and sam arent planning to do anything. And later tomorrow night we're going to the homecoming football game. 

I'm watching Angel on tnt. and charmed is on afterwards (favorite show of mine)

hmm.. need medicine."

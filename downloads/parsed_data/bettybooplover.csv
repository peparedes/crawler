I am leaving the non-profit world to be a doula and a midwife wow! my heads spins at the thought and there are so many things i need to get in order its really mind boggling. Luckily my mother bought me a laptop which solves many of my problems and I just feel so overwhelmed by the move I am making. I have the support of my friends but I havent told my mother yet. I told my chritians godmother and she was like Oh. I expect my mother to freak out and make me freak out. when I am ready I may send a letter. I just dont want to fall off my cloud of faith because my mom is a mess. I just keep putting things off and putting one foot in front of the other. Whew! good times man good times."

"event","Man and lemme tell you Barney's burger makes it all better. I am eating a hikcory turkey burger and seasoned fries feeling the bad food course through my body on this beautiful sunshine day and I feel good. 

I decided to go ahead and buy my mother a vibrator for her 50th and if she goes off then imma just hafta deal with it. I think she will thank me later even if just silently. S

So this weekend Imm go visit Obatala cause well i am in need of his clarity, love and patience. Its been awhile since i have been to see him and I wonder what will come up. I keep seeing a white plate with 8 pears and cascarilla so that is what he will have and now it is in writing so yeah. 
ok this food is too good so ill be back with a real update peace."

"event","I love it cause the day jus goes by so much faster. I mean awesome. So my job hunt continues and seeing that it took me 8 months last time, i am in chill mode about it right now and am hoping I will gone by june and in my new place by july. Oh speaking of which, I meditated this morning and decided to tell my landlord that I am moving out july 1st. This also means that my roomie needs to know that but that gives me and everyone eles plenty of time. I am hoping that my roomie can stay in that house and I get my full deposit with no bumps. I have been looking at the market and until I get a job that pays more it looks like I may end up in a studio, which is ok since I need to collect some things anyway so be prepared to get a invite to gift me house items cause imma need my community on this one. I must say the thought of living by myself is scary. There is so much that now lands on my back. Like: the rent, food, saftey, bills and more. I am also excited to have my own space and not have to hurt somebody because of them being asses, or dirty or disrespectful. I also look forward to a one bedroom since that is truly what I want. I am excited folks. 

Then on the job front, I am a bit afraid of making 46000-52000 just becasue the expectation goes up. I wonder where I will find that money and the job that makes me jump outta bed and rush to work, having fun all day. Man, I visualized this place and I will have it.

I have also decided to go on a silent retreat the summer regarless of if I have the vacation time or not. its 10 days long and all you do is eat, sleep, shit, piss and meditate. I know it will be difficult but I feel like there are lots of places in my spirit that need attention and healing and I want to give myself just that. We shall see."

I decided I was taking on too much of other people's stuff and have since made two appointments to get body work done instead of go to therapy. I am not sure for how long but I feel like it is what I need right now and then I will go back. I feel so clever to come up with that cause I can't afford therapy and body work so here I go man. Plus I am taking a human day off sunday. Saturday night imma take a whit bath, put on some white clothes and all sunday just relax and not talk to humans at all. No cellie on, just me, books and TV maybe a movie or two ya heard me. I am about feeding my spirit right now in any way I can cause the shit is gettin deep. I am about movin and shakin my world instead of waiting for shit to happen. I look forward to what is to come, to livin in my own place, to have a job I love and pays me my worth. I cant wait to receive olokun and allow him to change my life. and to see my eggun soon. I love you all."

I mean, I got the phone calls (which i intensly appreciate) and I am having a party but I mean my 24th was good but I was somewhere else so i kinda feel like i am celebrating my 24th, 25th, survival of my fire, rebirth of me trhough ocha. Also, I am like damn im 25 and I am trying to figure out what that means. You know like at 21 it was about getting laid and partying or 18 was about independence. I guess 25 is about putting it all together, creating the foundation for your adult life. Or maybe its that I am an adult but am not ready. who knows. either way time continues and I will only get older. I hope to enjoy this age/year and to appreciate this time. I hope to heal and get to know myself intimatly. I hope to find abundance, money, love and my dreams. I hope...."

"event","Abundance has/is my theme for 2007. and I would love to say not in that greedy way but it is definetly in that kid that wants more cookies when they have just hade like 9 and they need to share with the other kids. I am opening myself up to having more than what I need. My neccesities are taken care of, I get by. I want to not live pay check to pay check. I want to take vacations to places that are outside of CA shit outside the country. When I need something spritual I want money to not be the hinderence hell nothing to hinder it. I want to quit a job and not worry for 6 months, I want no debt I want freedom that can come from money. Yeah its a move away from the hardcore lefty I had become, but that was before bills started growing in the back yard screaming for more water when I was having a drought. I feel that it is possible I also feel that abundance of all kind (health, relationships, happiness, confidence and more) is possible and I will have these things because though I cant see it because It has never been in my life I can feel it down into my soul so much so that when I really let myself feel it I cry because I know.

With all that said i had a kick ass holiday. I was able to get my mother a present for x-mas. I enjoyed her company and I brought in the new year with a game of uno, good cheese, melissa and tracy. I spent my first day of the new year with orisha and it was beautiful. I am so blessed to be apart of a tradition/religion that allows me to touch God. I mean really sit on that y'all, its off da hook(understatment not intended but shit there are no words really).

I was thinking about the fact that a year ago today I had my fire and how far i have come. Thanks to eggun, orisha, my mother, my cousin, friends and myself I cam through well. It was hard and continues to be but it is really amazing how much it helped me to grow. I changed alot because of that experience and many others that came after. I really look forward to this year. Heres to new friendships to be made, old relationships that revolve and abundance. May this year bring you what you need and more.

"event","Last night I went to Ameoba and was just kickin it by myself when I realized the plague that is early twenties has almost completly lifted. oh god it is so good. All that feeling of loneliness and that no one loves me including me. the fighting everyone and everything. not knowing myself one minute and then feeling like I have a grasp just to have pulled from underneath. I feel a weight has lifted off of me. I feel content and clear about how I want to reach my goals. I have not fought with my mom in awhile because i let shit go. I havent fought with many people in awhile. its hard for me to describe this feeling on paper (computer) but I love it. bottom line my future, my present feel clear and the fact that i dont fully understand it clear. oh the joy."

<p align=""center""><font face=""Verdana"">The Moon is all about visions and illusions, madness, genius and poetry. This is a card that has to do with sleep, and so with both dreams and nightmares. It is a scary card in that it warns that there might be hidden enemies, tricks and falsehoods. But it should also be remembered that this is a card of great creativity, of powerful magic, primal feelings and intuition. You may be going through a time of emotional and mental trial; if you&nbsp;have any past mental problems, you must be vigilant in taking your medication but avoid drugs or alcohol, as abuse of either will cause them irreparable damage. This time however, can also result in great creativity, psychic powers, visions and insight. You can and should trust your intuition.</font></p>

I am freaking out and not freaking out about my job situation which feels like only7 yeasterday that I was in the same situation. I keep thinking about how I was rescued but it was at the last possible momment and I was nervous until that momment and I am hoping that I can be saved way before the last possible momment cause I gots bills man lots of them ya heard me.so you, me and everyone within a 200 mile radius of me need to pray alot that I get a job, i get one that is the one i want/need that it pays much more than the one I have that I ge this job within the next month and it is a smooth transition. ok with all that said i am fundraising for a ceremony i need soon cause my stomach pains are coming back and I cant afford to go to the doctor where they will tell me they dont know whats wrong with me but I know so yeah. If ya got 5 bucks or 500 to kick my way please do so maybe I can make something for ya as a exchange (jordan). 
on another note I finally bought a dye and some soda ash so I can start dyeing fabric we shall see where that goes. ok i feel better now off to the races."

I know a way will be made but untill then....wait a way is beginning to be made I mean my finances are in the balance and I am seeking another job which i feel is going welll....oh gawd the thought of not going to (well u know the place) makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside...like jordan feels when he thinks of leaving sf ( oh by the way good luck wit dat bro) whew, i have alot going on but i sit in this moment feeling good about it because it is the change i have been asking for for a long time. its hard and time consuming but watching me and life fall into the places i need feels soo goo and deserved

"event","I keep this running fantasy in my head that some old whit lady finds out about my life and wants to help me so she gives me enough money to pay off my debt, retire my mom, buy her a new car, a new house, pay off the condo she has, tells me to quit my job, and then gives me money to live off of for the rest of my life and I  build a house where my broke friends can live and build my madrina a huge house and next to that a ocha house so hers is left as a home. then I go and stay in spain till I feel like coming back knowing spanish having met a guy named something awesome and he loves the ground i walk on and i get back to the us go to school get my phd, travel some more and then it fades to black cause I can't see past that point. then I wake up and see all of my bills that are stacked to the ceiling and over due, the immense amount of debt iam in, a job that i am ready to leave but need the money for and a mom that is so tired she can't sleep. But for just a little while i am swept off to a place where at least one part of my life is fixed like a broken drain and i am left with the hope that one day it will come true."

"event","well, things are bit less crazy, although my mom is completly freaking out about her surgery and I am just not. I did for a second and then I was like no my mom will be fine and she is not I will deal with that as it comes yes. I said my good byes to kristi who took me off of myspace setting the ""battlelines"" as jordan would say. I found it funny but a bit hurtful but considering the pain I have been feeling the last year it aint that bigga deal. I feel good about the decision and it made me go hey who else is holding me back. there are a few friendship imma let go and others imma reshape so that i can deal. i have met so many new and great people that i no longer have time to try and keep up with certain people. to think i was worried when i graduated that i wouldn't meet new people. I should have known i mean i am a social butterfly and i come from social butterflies. i mean at the end of the day i have to say mojucue to orisha, eggun and my godparents for hookin it up. and much love to my god brothers and sisters that are helping me figure out who i am and love myself as is. i have learned so much in the last year it is amazing and I am truely coming into myself. i am excited to get to know me and go on vacation hahahahah."

<TD>You are the fabulously quirky and independent woman of character. You go your own way, follow your own drummer, take your own lead. You stand head and shoulders next to your partner, but you are perfectly willing and able to stand alone. Others might be more classically beautiful or conventionally woman-like, but you possess a more fundamental common sense and off-kilter charm, making interesting men fall at your feet. You can pick them up or leave them there as you see fit. You share the screen with the likes of Spencer Tracy and Cary Grant, thinking men who like strong women.

"event","well, I am sitting here eating in and out for like the 2nd time this month and am thanking the gods for it plus a few other things. this week and this day have been rough but I have been sent my beautiful friends to deal. Roshan called, kristi emailed and nia is back in town and hopefully by the end of next week I would have seen them all. I ran to my hommie kristina and realized she rocks too. I guess I am finally in a good mood and it has been awhile since I have been in one like this. imma go to my madrina's b-day and set up a time to sit and talk about my warriors, my misa and whatnot. I think I am beginning to get excited about that and I am doing the spiritual work I thought I would not be able to do. it amazes me how much orisha has changed me in so little time and how far I have come. I am in love with orisha and they are in love with me. I love my eggun and they love me. I am held...next I feel that I need love and it is going to hit me when I least expect it. I know its comin and i think i am ready."

"event","I am not really sure why or how but I have been feeling lonely. wait maybe that isn't it, left out is more like it, unwanted by all those I love. Some of it is that many of the people I care about are very far away from me. Its like when i ask for harjant and sunny to go I didn't mean all my friends too. Many are coming back this week which is perfect cause I think I just miss them all. I miss laughing with them and they help me to not be so hard on myself and enjoy my life."

I tried to get on myspace to see what da fluff was saying about chris and myspace won't even let me on so imma take that as a sign that I need to leave well enough alone.

"event","Nikka Costa kicked assssss last night Gaaawd damn. This was Renato's first interaction with her and he was blown away. SHit I have seen her three times and I was still in awe. I got to be right in front of her. I was so close she hit me in the head with her leg and was sweating on me.  And lord was she hot in her tight hip-hugger bell bottoms that showed dat ass and a tight blue shit, no bra, and a brown vest she eventually took off, and a gold scarf. Twas tight. After I had a very late dinner with reno and we had a great converstion. I am now trying to get oh my nappy hair on the phone to fix my locks. I think the lady who did them last time underestimated how much perm I had left in my hair cause those are the only parts not locking and I tried to fix to no avail so now for more proffesional help. I wanted to go there in the first place cause it just calls to me so this time imma follow my instincts. yeah imma go now I gotta get ready for the eye doctor."

"event","well imma go see crowns tomorrow and hopefully I will remember to pay my mom back for getting the tix. Yay for her being in a house full of queer women hahahah loveit. So I have been feeling fat lately and so i have been reading books and watching movies to feel better hopefully it will work.
Me and my godsister went and hung out with Yemaya and it was wonderful. swimming around and singing to her and she let us know she kne we were there and she liked the songs. we even saw a yawo on a walk and she acknowledged us.
Alas I thought it would help with this feeling I have been having but it has not. I keep feeling like something is missing and i dont know some old feelings. I have been looking inside to see whats up and I am getting closer to seeing what is going on. once I do that I can do what I need to in order to change it. im sleeping to bed I go"

I am going to hang out with a new hommie and I am not fully sure what we are going to do or how it is going to go but imma just try and go with the flow. So I emailed frank and he emailed me back which was a total shocker...would have never thought. I miss him, not neccessarily as a b-friend but as a friend. I mean we did kow each other for 9 years before we started dating and I just miss his energy but I doubt we will ever be friends again. I really don't know why I am making an entry I think i am procrastinating. Imma stop and get up holla at me."

Then I need to send the predator twins something and I am fully done with them. Damn it feels good to be free. So this week has been crazy but I am somehow alive and looking forward to a busy weekend full of friends and hopefully good times. Other than that my life is still settling itself into something I don't know so I really don't know how I feel I am just along for the ride. Oya whipped my life into a whirlwind and now eleggua, yemaya and obatala are helping put the pieces where they need to be and really its quite fun. So I guess that's all folks holla at me in da streets."

"event","Well I am almost packed and ready to leave this bitch. I have to pick up the rent-a-van at like 9 am which is insane. Oh well I will be happy when my shit is set up at the new place. It was nice getting rid of so much stuff. I mean each time I move I get rid of more and it allows me to let go of the past/present. I am so excited that I will no longer be in the presence of harjant and sunny. Apart of me will miss them because we knew each other for so long but other than that I am just ready to move on. So tomorrow I will move all my stuff in and hopefully arrange my new room and finish this place. it sucks cause even after I move I have to clean, paint and plug any holes. I am giving myself a few days for that because I expect it will kill me. I am already sick as it is and I am hoping that I will be better tomorrow. anyway, off I go."

"event","Yay!!! I finally got my dreads. Although I know that the woman who did them will be talkling about me for years to come. She just kept talkling about how I told her that I hadn't comed my hair in two weeks. Good thing I didn't tell he about the time I didn't comb it for 3 months...oh well. I was embarressed and then this voice came into my head that was like ""and since when do you give a fuck about what some black folks in a salon you don't know care"" and I was like hmmm fuck it I won't care as long as she can dread the shit. It took about 6 hours which is what I figured and it didn't hurt as much as I thought. I figure after maybe a touch-up or two I will begin doing it my self and the dreading begins. I already love them and look better than I thought I would. 
So good bye to da aldo (peach bitch)
and I am literally days away from leaving the hell I have been in with the idiot twins. Once they are gone I am going to begin the process of forgiving them and myself. Then I am going to wash them off my life and move on...I can't wait *takes a deep breath* after that I will literally only ave people in my life that I want in it woo hoo.
mother hasn;t seen nor heard about me getting dreads hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha hilarious.
tired is as tired does but work is never done."

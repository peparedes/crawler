"event","man, I hate memorial day. its so confusing. what is it for. I get the impression that its the same as veterans day. At least the way it was explained to me. so, why is there a need for both. do the veterans feel like they need 2 days a year to honor them. if thats the case. I think that I should have 2 days as well. so now I have 2 birthdays. one for the 1/2 point. so mark your calanders. my 16 1/2 birthday is nov 4th. go buy me stuff ho!"

The influence of Emily makes you positive, self-assertive, and independent. You can be creative, inventive, and ingenious in practical matters, such as handicrafts. When you have the opportunity to pursue your own goals and interests free from interference, you can feel very agreeable and express a buoyant optimism. On the other hand, you can be impulsive and forceful when opposed, and act without due forethought and discretion. Hence you have many bitter experiences and generally rather unsettled conditions in your life, with little progress and financial accumulation. You cannot tolerate any domination by others, or circumstances that restrict your freedom and independence. You are inclined to make changes abruptly in your life as an escape from such conditions. When annoyed or offended, you can be very candid and sarcastic in your speech. Many disruptions in friendship and association have thus resulted. Verbal expression is difficult for you, and you can be forthright in situations requiring delicacy, even though it is not your intention to be. The intensity of your nature would cause you to suffer in the senses of the head."

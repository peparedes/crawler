"event","Well...ain't life just been great lately...

I have court tomorrow.
Matt got he car taken away and is grounded for life.
Matt's mom is sick...
Matt's mom also told his dad n step mom that we've been going out and have had sex.
I have court tomorrow.
There are so many raw emotions that I don't know how to help.
I'm about to spend the next two months waiting for the next court date in hell.
People I've trusted have betrayed my loved ones, and me.
No one agree's with my desicions, n choices
I've got this really bad head cold..

MMkay now for the good stuff...
uhh....
Matthew n I are still together, granted now that his parents know....lets just say I don't know what he's gonna do.
My mom really likes Matt and would never tell anyone bout us

just ack

so much shit, so much drama...
I suppose thats highschool?

I never have this kind of d...nevermind *realizing the past year*...

I'm out, I'm gonna be dead tired tomorrow at court...

Ciao, n have fun"

i walk out of my room (forgot why) and i see my dad charging the couch running at full speed, then the couch kinda tips and he falls on to it, all the while carrying his ash tray. im standing thinking wtf is doing? turns out he got up to fast and his medication made him too dizzy so he kinda started falling...i duno...i know this might sound mean but while i was concerned if he was hurt i also wanted to laugh my ass off, because i'd never seen him move that fast...

ack..i feel mean now lol

sweetie, i need to talk to you real quick today. you havent been online yet, i know you'll probably get on later. my mom likes you alot btw...which is one like a fraction of why i need to speak with you lol.

"event","i need a relationship, im tired of all this phyzical shit.....i need feelings involved....its getting hard to do this. i need someone to care about me, i need to care about someone. im just getting tired of being...... usually im feeling like im being used and i hate that feeling, but granted i usually bring it on myself, i guess im just having an off day. not quite sure, but when i have these days they make me think. 

they usually make me think about what my life is all about, usually makes me wonder, well nothings really wrong, but yet nothings really right. so that makes me think why? why am i still here



last nite i was thinking how funny it is, is that people type there feelings in here. its like a person, people will type shit that doesnt even matter. when you first start updating lj you say stupid stuff (hence look at mine from the begininglol). and eventually you prgress to actually typing feelings lol. i guess i usually type in here because i wont have someone to talk to.

i dont know

im sad, no one ever replys to my posts.....like seriously ever lol

i think im going to stop typing right about .......now"

my mom pisses me off soooo much

i call her to arrange for me and my dad to come and pick up my stuff and she starts yelling at me about how i need to call ahead of time to pick up my stuff (hence i called her) and about how she needs a few days to get all my stuff together (ummm...shes had 5 months). and it seems that every day i call she's either in a bad mood (everyday shes in a bad mood) or is sleeping (?)

erg...i cant even make sense right now cause im soo pissed off

all i want is my fucking shit back

that is not too much to ask

i mean hell ive even given up on asking for my tv back, i just want my other stuff

why cant she just fucking give up whats not hers?

she didnt fucking pay for it

i did, i was the one who had to babysit, and take care of neighbors, and help out tiffany (not tc) to get money, so i get money and i buy all my shit that i wanted, and what happens....i dont even get it.

and on the other hand she still has over 100 cds of mine, that once again i either bought, burned, or got from friends

now i was pretty pissed off about the cds but ive been collecting them back and reburning, even when i know that i shouldnt and my mom should just give me all my shit back

she gets all pissy about how i only call her when i want stuff, well wtf am i suppossed to do

magically telaport all my shit over here

ya because i can totally do that....not

i wish i killed her while i had the chance

or at least have killed me when i had the chance

i had always had my gun inbetween the mattress, and my mom still has yet not seen it

so many times ive pulled it out thinking today is the day.....but then i keep thinking and realize all the shit i still have yet to do

anywayz

i think i'll stop now....."

i hung out w/tiffany, matt, purple, derek, dan, trend, and some other people. 

earlier tonite, me, purple(matts lil bro, dont know how to spell his name lol), and derek go back to his house, (it was raining outside) well we go inside i lay down on the couch w/purple while derek plays guitar, all of a sudden he's like guyz i think my parents are home, so me n purple run outside to the patio/porch, whichever you wanna call it, i was behind purple, me wearing converses, when all of a sudden i fell, and went sliding right into the porch dork (nice dent), i landed right on my back, it was hilarous, and i can still feel it. purple falls down laughing and trying to help me up at the same time, i couldnt stop laughing, i seriously couldnt breathe i was laughing so hard, surprisingly i didnt hurt myself, the only thing i hurt was my ass, and thats just a bit bruised, and by bruised i mean i feel like i have a 2 foot stick up my ass, cause i landed right on my tail bone somehow.

so now when ever i walk, im kinda walking funny since my ass hurts lol

haha dan made a dick outta a sausage thing, i held it in place for him while he positioned it then, then went around poking people, and trying to fuck them, it was hilarous."

i miss....someone
 
i wanna make out

i wanna fuck, like now, (and sorry to freak out any guys for this part) and now that im not on my period nothings stopping me. lol

""love sucks but with out love would you want to live""

today i became really sad

i was reading my friends letter/writing thing and it was about love, and he described it perfectly and as i read it, it made me really sad. Because i realized that out of my two really serious boyfriends that ive had, that even tho i ""fell in love"" and even told them i loved them, i never really did. Ive never experienced love. And that makes me sad. Because me being ali n all, even tho i'll never act like it, nor look like it, my life has alwayz been about love, but now that ive realized that there is none in my life, its like why live? but then i think about it and realize that someday when the time is right i will find it, and if i lose it once again then i guess love w/that one person just wasnt meant to be or things wouldnt have happened the way they did.

i was going to keep putting L's in front of every word but i figured that if i was going to be talking about something somewhat serious (look about dork lol) then i couldnt be doing that. but uhh ya.

i think im running out of stuff to talk bout.

ive been so busy lately. me n my dad keep getting in these stupid random fights about the stupidest things ever ex:candles, insense, windows, pepsi, my bed. just stuff like that, really stupid. me so happy, im going to be getting my xbox back soon, cant wait :D wow this is kinda sad, karen disappeared, and no one seems to know where she is. sorry i havent updated this lately. theres just so much i wanna type, but i cant because .... well i just cant. my friend who ive been friends w/for almost a year now, like really good friends, almost raped me yesterday. and if it wasnt for his parents being home, i dont think anything could've stoped him. he reminded me why i had stopped trusting guys in the first place......im getting really tired. even tho its not even that late. seriously tho the guys i hug are the ones i trust, which at the top of my head are just a total of two: matt n sterling.....ok i think that im going to stop writing in here before i put my deep feelings, and end up regretting opening up to a keyboard....."

Your feathers are dark, raven<br>black, which can also be spiny and scaly. No<br>one really knows why your feathers are this<br>dark, because you always conceal yourself with<br>a bubble. A great sadness surrounds you, and<br>you take it out on others and the world. In<br>Spite of your beauty, your inside is twisted<br>and dead, because you were hurt so badly that<br>youre heart couldnt take it. Before, your wings<br>were white, and slowly, when your life was<br>changing, so was the color. You have no<br>friends, because you cant let anyone get too<br>close to you. Grief fills your heart, though<br>anger blinds your eyes.

<i>""And The Vampire was all that remained on<br>the blood drowned creation.  She attempted to<br>regrow life from the dead.  But as she was<br>about to give the breath of life, she was<br>consumed in the flame of The Phoenix and the<br>cycle began again.""</i>

Some examples of the Vampire Form are Hades (Greek)<br>and Isis (Egyptian).
The Vampire is associated with the concept of<br>death, the number 9, and the element of fire.
Her sign is the eclipsed moon.

As a member of Form 9, you are a very realistic<br>individual.  You may be a little idealistic,<br>but you are very grounded and down to earth.<br>You realize that not everything lasts, but you<br>savor every minute of the good times.  While<br>you may sometimes find yourself lonely, you<br>have strong ties with people that will never be<br>broken.  Vampires are the best friends to have<br>because they are sensible.

"event","got home around 3 something last night, now after homecoming was alot more fun than the actual homecoming
lets see the dance, kinda sucked, jake completely hated it, wouldnt even smile, im pretty sure that he hates me now. im just glad that no one saw me crying. sabrina almost did but i stopped myself, but other than that i had fun dancing w/all my friends lol, and some people that i didnt even know but they were nice. 
wow this is actually harder than usual. i can usually pull off being happy around other people when im not , and right now im trying to do that but it just aint working anymore
im gonna go i gotta think

"event","dude screw this shit, all this is just starting to fucking piss me off. i seriously need some anti-depressants. but hey w/e, not like it fucking matters. i wanna cry now, but i know i cant, i know that i cant let people actually see that i have feelings, i just wanna light some candles, curl up in a ball, and cry myself to sleep, and never wake up . . . . . . but i cant and that makes me more sad, makes me more sad to know that people actually need me, so if i do go, like i want to . . . . . . . good-bye"

"event","why cant people ever tell when im pissed, or sad, or depressed, why dont they ever realize. and the only person who actually does notice is usually a major ass to me alot, cept when he's trying to go out w/me. and people who do know me well enough would realize that i just dont tell/give people my feelings, because ive been hurt too many times. guess im just scared to be hurt again. well anywayz im going to go in my room, light some candles and die (j/k, but i wish), and then i guess i'll call jake. speaking of jake you look really hot in your suit, forgot to tell ya, lol."

"event","wow this fucking sucks i have a soccer game on sat. at 6:45, and that completely interfers w/homecoming. theres no way that im going to the soccer game, and i dont think im going to the pra. on fri. either because my friend wants to go dress shopping for homecoming. i guess it could be fun. i got soccer pra. today. i dont think that i'll ever go to conditioning (yes there is a difference for you blonde people who dont realize)because for some weird reason im alwayz busy every tues/wed/thurs so i dont ever find time to go but mon/fri i alwayz have time. it just goes to show ya that my life is fucked up. but thats ok, cause truthfully isnt everyones. im mad at john he's not going to homecoming and i was planning on buggin him, but its all good. my love keely has a cold, my poor baby. but she's still going to practice, so i guess i'll have to have my fun petting her there instead of at school. hi jake, i kinda already figured that youd be reading all this shitty ass stuff that im typing about, so umm ya . . . .anywho brian your a jackass!! with that said im out"

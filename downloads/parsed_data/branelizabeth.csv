"event","As we grow up, we learn that even the one person that wasn't suppose to let us down, probably will. you'll have your heart broken and you'll break others. you'll blame a new love for things an old love did. you'll eventually lose somebody you love. so take too many pics, laugh too much, forgive freely and love like you've never been hurt, because every second you spend angry is a second of happiness you can never get back


heartbreaker you got the best of me, but i just keep on comin' back incessantly. oh, why did you have to run your game on me? i should of known right from the start you'd go and break my heart.


**** Lately i have been CONFUSED a/b EVERYTHING ****

THE THE I HATE THE MOST IN THIS WORLD IS TO GET LIIIIIED TOO!!! and SOMEONE has done that alot lately.. I'm really getting sick of it.. i like him alot but i guess iono.. i'm confused like i said.. 

i was thinking.. that if i just TRY to block him out of my life.. it would get better but iono if that would work.. ?

neways.. i guess i can TRY to stop complaining and talk a/b positive things. maybe
today was trashy i could say.. i woke up so late for school and rushed getting ready something i HATE and then went to schoool looking SO bad .. i didnt care at all.. my hair was sticking up and nobody told me so oh well.. it was just ONE OF THOSE DAYS.. after school i had to go get my cousin peyton from DeSoto.. and then we went to a couple stores so i could look at this dress for this weekend.. but they still didnt have a bigger size.. ugh!! i hate fat as ppl say.. or having a KINDA big ass.. iono? WELL i got home around 4:30 HURRIED up and cleaned the house for gMaw.. i love being sweet i guess.. then caitlin came over while i was cleaning.. i finished cleaning and shit and then helped her get ready for her sports banquet.. it took FOREVER to find something to match her skirt.. but we finally did it.. it was a blast tho.. ya wouldnt know what we was talkin a/b if u wasnt here.. well anyways we talked a/b some THINGS like always..because we tell each other EVERYTHING i believe.. well i do.. and then at 6 she left to go to her banquet.. I cleaned my room MORE.. and MORE.. MORE.. and then i was done w/ it b/c it will NEVER stay clean.. 

I ate a little after that b/c all i had for lunch was like 2 cookies.. and then watched BOYS 'N THE HOOD.. it was sooooo gooood!.. got on the internet and talked to hunTa B. seeing if he ever got better unlike ME!.. and then watched another movie and the inferno and shit.. 
thats kinda all i did today.. Well mom finally made me ANOTHER doc. appt. my 7th one in like 2 weeks.. UGH.. i'm never going to get better.. neways.. i decided i'm working out and running and stuff after school till i LOOSE MY LOVE HANDLES.. i'm not fat at all and i KNOW THAT.. i have a flat stomach its just i have lovehandles outta this woooooooooooorld.. i HATE it.. ugh so yeeah. It feels like the meds. i take makes me gain weight.. or something iono.. if thats so i'm not taking them.. YEAH i'm serious a/b this weight thing. BITCHES in this town call me fat.. so ill prove them wrong.. I'M NOT FAT! Im getting sick of hearing it.. 

today was a good day in another way.. AMANDA AND I ARE FINALLY GETTING ALONG AGAIN.. i'm sooo glad.. i mean we're sisters and we fight like crazy.. when we do laugh and talk alot like we used to i'm like soo happpy b/c i love her alot and i dont like to fight w/ her.. if feels like since i stopped being friends w/ one of her friends thats when we started NOT getting along.. SISTERS COME BEFORE FRIENDS.. always remember that hunnnn!..  Well she's loosing her voice and its soo hard for her.. its kinda funnny to me but its sad.. i tell her not to talk and just carry around a notepad.. but she is STILL TRYING to talk.. its harrrrrrrrrrrd for her you can tell.. but were going to the docter tomorrow so maybe they will help her.. 
Oh yeah.. SUNDAY was the most laziest day evvvvvvvvEr!.. i didnt wake up till like 12:30 i haven't slept that long in like FOREVER.. i always i get up and clean and shit.. and then i took a shower and got ready for the day... i sat around the house ALL day.. til around 4:30 kellie came by for a bit and then caitlin, kD, jermey, and dullah came over till around 6 something.. After they left i fell RIGHT to sleep. Didn't wake up till 8 or so.. woke up and waited for the fooood to get ready.. then ate me some STEAK.. SHRIIIMMMP.. & chicken that was cooked on the grill.. it was soo good.. well i was pretty full so i took my meds. and went BACK to sleep.. yes i'v got 'LOOOTS of beauty sleep lately..

i feel kinda better after writing in this.. its just i like THIS guy sooooooooooo much and i know he knows i do b/c i tell him i do.. but it just we're never going to be together.. iono why? its confusing. its just i HATE it when s/o tells me they love me and shit but reallly doesnt.. just says that? hmmm.. sounds like s/o i KNOW.. but N T WAYS... i believe im going to take my MEDS. GROOSSSS and hit the haYyyY.. i'm tiiiiired kinda..

~ wishing life would get better SOON~...

One more kiss could be the best thing
But one more lie could be the worst
And all these thoughts are never resting
And you're not something I deserve

In my head there's only you now
This world falls on me
In this world there's real and make believe
And this seems real to me




You love me but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me but you don't know who I am
So let me go 
Let me go

I dream ahead to what I hope for
And I turn my back on loving you
How can this love be a good thing
When I know what I'm goin through

In my head there's only you now
This world falls on me
In this world there's real and make believe
And this seems real to me"

<P>I thought I felt you touch my cheek this morning But I must've been dreaming And in the middle of the night without a warning I thought I heard you breathing Me and my so-called independence I've got this loneliness that's so relentless I guess you get used to somebody Kinda like having them around I guess you get used to the way they make you happy</P>
<P>&nbsp;Bring you up when you're feeling down I never dreamed when I was letting you go that I would wake up and miss you this much I guess you get used to somebody, I guess you get used to being loved I kinda miss those rambling conversations Where we'd talk about nothing The way you always made me laugh at my frustrations </P>
<P>Baby that was something I should've been careful what I wished for 'Cause I've got my freedom and so much more I just had to call you, i had to hear your voice And tell you i still love you we still have a choice You're sewn into the fabric, the pieces of my life And i just can't remember why we said goodbye Everything i do Leads back to you I know i just can't let us go Bad love, she took a good shot Heartaches, she's had a whole lot of tough breaks And no one could blame her if she holds out She's a little worried to jump right in She ain't in a hurry to try again She's taking time off from love, but Every night she cries just a little bit less And she tries a little bit more She's got every right to wait until her heart has healed And when she's ready, I'm here and I'm gonna hold her Inch by inch she gets a little closer to me, every night She's mad that she ever loved him She's through and she's had enough of him, but it's true He's gonna take some time gettin' over But I don't mind the waitin' because I know She's worth the time it's takin', our love will grow We're makin' it day by day and </P>

SOMETIMES *YOU* just HAVE to MovE oN. Let GO. And GROW UP.



----Dont spit on me and shame yourself
Because you wish you were someone else
You look so clean but you spread your dirt
As if think that words dont hurt
You build up walls no one can climb
The things you do should be a crime
You're queen of superficiality
Keep your lies out of my reality
And when you're nice it's just a pose
You're one of those

Haters
Traitors to the human race
Haters
What a drag 
What a waste
I'd like to see them disappear
They dont belong anywhere
Haters

Spinning a web thats hard to see
Of envy, greed and jealousy
Feeling angry but you don't know why
Why dont you look me in the eye? 
You want my friends
You want my clothes
You're one of those

--All my life I've been telling myself
I don't need no no nobody else
I'm sitting here thinking
Sittin here drinkin bout you

I look through the mirror
And all that I see
Is one crazy lonely sucker looking back at me
I'm sitting here thinkin'
Sittin' here drinkin bout you.......








          ** She wants someone to call her angel
           Someone to put the light back in her eyes
           She's looking through the faces
           The unfamiliar places
           She needs someone to hear her when she cries **



So let's forget about the hatin
And the way the bulls are playin
Without Jordan on the team
And the high price of gasoline
And if your living in a bubble
Then I guess you got no troubles
But if your anything like me 
Well then I bet you really need

To take a ride 
Let's take a ride on the love train
Unwind, we'll be chuga luggin all the way 
Let's roll, like the stone playin all day hey
Let's take a ride
Let's take a ride on a love train

"event","Ok this is hell, pure freaking hell, for those of you on my friends list that arent local friends too, let me just tell you it is 107 degrees here in Fresno Freaking California, and being that im bout 8 mths pregnant that means that I am like 701 degrees, im gonna fucking croak. 
MUST SWIMMMMMMMMMM
Well my company is going outta business, so I'll be having no job, ackkkk, scarry shit. I am going to apply at some portrait studios after the baby is born, that is the one thing I loved to do and im pretty damn good at it, if I might say so myself,hehe. I have to update my portfolio though, it is over 5 years old, I havent done pictures since Lou was 1 year old, my goodness.
I am poor right now, and so sick of being poor, and with new baby on the way it really sucks. I cant even afford the necessities, but im not letting that get me down.
I have registered at (The Lulliby Club at Target, and Babies R Us, and Walmart for baby stuff) I dont wanna push an online baby shower on any of yall, so if anyone wants (and I truley mean WANTS, no pressure) to buy the baby something for the shower let me know and I'll give you the links.
And for my Lo's and Lette's out there (It will all be explained in the book) You mean the book that is coming out in 3 days???? Yup that be the one, whoop whoop. I cant afford it so who ever wants to burn it for me that would be mighty kind of you,lol. I heard psrts of it on the sample on their site, and DIZAAAAM, that shit is tight.
Well im gonna jam, so hope everyone has a fun, safe, cool, tight, sick, dope weekend.
LUVINS ALL"

Here's her face, hope the cut works cause the picture is kinda big.

Contractions have stopped so that lil scare is over (knock on wood). But here is a little taste of my biggest scare, regarding Louie.
He had the MRI/MRA done Monday, he was loaded, he kept trying to fight with himself in the mirror and he kept telling me that the guy in the mirror wouldnt stop staring at him,lol, I dont like seeing my son all high like that but it was comical.
They found a blood clot in the artery of his arm which is why it has been so cold and if it doesnt push the clot through itself they will schedule a bypass. We will know more within the next few weeks, I'll let you all know when I find out.
I want to thank you all for being so supportive of me, I really appreciate your genuine concern, it means alot.
So as usual, tons of stuff, very little time, and trying to stay sain through it all."

Im bout to be 30 weeks, and the baby already wants to come out, lil stinker. I go back on Wednesday to my doctor and we will see what happens. Im suppose to be just lying around til then, and NO SEX!!! What the?!?!?!?! Eh, does that mean no masturbation?? Like im gonna ask my doctor that,lol, so to be on the safe side, none of that either.
Oh and just a lil info for <lj user=""lothos""> I just started to lactate, for those of you who get grossed out by that, MY Bad!hehe


Hope everyone has a great weekend. I luv you all. Hugs and Kisses, and best wishes for Lou please. Thanks Guys."

The Whys of Men.

1. WHY DO MEN BECOME SMARTER DURING SEX?
(because they are plugged into a genius)

  2. WHY DON'T WOMEN BLINK DURING SEX?
      (they don't have enough time)

  3. WHY DOES IT TAKE 1 MILLION SPERM TO FERTILIZE ONE EGG?
     (they don't stop to ask directions)

  4. WHY DO MEN SNORE WHEN THEY LIE ON THEIR BACKS?
      (because their balls fall over their butts and they vapor lock)
     (You're laughing, aren't you?!?!)


  5. WHY WERE MEN GIVEN LARGER BRAINS THAN DOGS?
     (so they won't hump women's legs at cocktails parties)

  6. WHY DID GOD MAKE MEN BEFORE WOMEN?
      (you need a rough draft before you make a final copy)

  7. HOW MANY MEN DOES IT TAKE TO PUT A TOILET SEAT DOWN?
      (don't know.....it never happened)

  (C'mon guys, we laugh at your blonde jokes!)

  And my personal favorite:

  8.  WHY DID GOD PUT MEN ON EARTH?
     (because a vibrator can't mow the lawn)"

"event","Turns out that the entire time I was complaining that something was wrong after the break, and was told that his swelling and excruciating pain was normal, was all bull shit. He had a condition that is called ISCHEMIC COMPARTMENT SYNDROME and it was a condition that, if caught in time, like the 4 times that I took him back complaining, that it could have been fixed. But rather than the Dr. take the time to cover all the possibilities that could have been causing such pain and discomfort he brushed us off as overprotective parents, and now my baby has to have surgery again(by another doctor) to see if they can fix some of the damage, and if it is successful he may gain 50% usage of his hand again. Fucking 50% is an optimistic estimate he says. You know how hard it is to hear that? I am fucking breaking down. He will pay for this, he treated us like we were idiots and blamed my son's stiffness on him being a baby about it, he was wrong and he will pay. His bosses were there for todays appointment and they have sent a referral to the plastic surgeon and to the patients advocates office because they know they are being suid now, damn right they are, they will pay for him loosing a part of his life because of their neglagance.
He said SORRY. SORRY? Sorry doesnt give my 6-year-old his hand back. I am having to teach him how to do things with one hand, like tie his shoe, and he is a trooper about it but it is alot of work, and it is hard for him to have to go to therapy 3 times a week while his friends do fun things like ride a bike and climb trees, it isnt fair. Yes I am greatful that he is alive and that he can walk and talk and breathe, but if not for this ass holes cocky attitude and neglagance my son would be capable of tying his shoes by himself today so for that he will pay.
I told Lou that will will prove them wrong, and that he will use his hand again and it will be better than before, and he takes that like a tough lil guy and agrees, but he is scared. Last time he had surgery he went through excruciating pain and it was avoidable so I understand why it scares him. We will get through this, but rest assure, he will have 4-6 years of college paid for, and he will have money to buy a brand new car when he groes up among other things. He will be compinsated for this.
Im tired. Thats all.
Hope you all are ok, sorry for the crazy lady post, but im still pretty much feeling that way about my ex so I wont even start on that one. This day makes it even harder, it would be cool to not have to go through this alone, but fuck it, I,we'll be fine.

Well I wanna invent ""DUDES""
Blonde hair, mohawks, skate and snowboards instead of chains and guns. Just the typical Dude looking people. Tattoos, peircings, the entire collection of what all my family and friends look like.
No racism intended, just seriously, DUDES. HOMIES sold well, so why not DUDES? 
LMFAO, yup, im clinically insane, 51/50.

"event","Mom didnt have blood pressure med for three days and couldnt get outta bed due to the fact that she looked like a blow fish, my sister went and got it for her and left Brittney there to run amuck through the house so I stopped by on my way home from work, I was hella freaking tired and so was Lou and we still had his homework, dinner, 2 loads of laundry and ""that 70's show at 8,lol all to get done and it was already like 7pm, FUCK. I gotta get control of this hectic shit. When I was at Moms Lou was being a tired, crabby lil guy and so I was all ""kiss grandma, were going home"" and as he walked into her room to tell her goodbye he trips causing all her wanna be dogs (lil chiuahas) to yalp hystarically which drowned out Lou's tears cause he caught himself with his left arm coming down and it hurt which poostponed anything we had to get done last night cause I was trying to make him feel better, I think the fact that it hurt a little was the worst part cause it is just a reminder to him that he is nt all normal right now, so tears lasted a WHILE.

So Junior and Jelly show up pretty thrashed around 10:00, Both staggering all over the place, fucking idiots knocked my playstation off the entertainment center along with everything that was sitting in front of it. I yelled at them like a billion times to shut the fuck up cause Lou was sleeping. Then D calls and bitches me out for letting them in when they have been drinking,but wont even speak to him when he does, duh dude, difference being they dont kick my ass. But they just stayed till they could get their stroll on to some lil tricks of theirs house, till round 11:00, then I locked my door and crashed.

Im so glad it is almost the end of the week. Like the weekends are even near a relaxation time, but at least I dont gotta work.
I counted how many times I wake up during the night, last night it was 5 times, no wonder im so tired.

I want Ice cream."

Im not over the fear but obviously the extreme overwhelming feeling that I was having has in some way calmed down a little.
I will deal with it all, I have no choice but to deal with it, and I know that it just hits harder somedays, being human and having feeling really bites sometimes.

<lj user=""bigdogg"">, I hope your feeling better and if you want to vent just email me.
Thanks to you all that expressed concern for me, I always know who's replies im gonna see when im upset about something and I love you all for being there.
And a special thanks to <lj user=""bgdftnfsn""> you are just a great person, thanks for the Happy Mothers Day message.

On a brighter side Lou's arm is now from a 30 degree angle to a 20 which means that only 20 more degrees and he will be able to straighten  it completly, woo hoo. Im so excited about that. And so is his therapist, she is impressed with his progress



Hope everyone has a good Monday."

"event","I am having a mental fucking breakdown. I just dont know anymore. I am  scared outta my fucking mind, I dont want to be alone, I dont want to be with Dustin (although it would have been nice) because I dont want to get hurt physically or emotionally anymore, but im so fucking tired of trying to handle everything by myself. Yeah I got myself into this, I know, and I love my son and I love my baby, but it was never suppose to be like this. I can talk all the shit in the world and say how tough I am and how strong I am but ya know what? I cant even lift the laundry basket without loosing my breath and feeling like im going ot pass out. Fuck this. Then he wants to say that I should just be with him, that he loves me and forget about the past, even though he is still the exact person from the past that he swore he would never be again. It would be so easy to just say ok, and then I would have a black eye to be crying about instead of just a broken, lonely heart. I sometimes wonder which is worse. My brain is fucked, I cant stop crying, I want my Mom to take care of me but im  the Mom now, it just isnt suppose to be like this. I hate admitting that I cant hang, and that I dont know what to do. I just need someone to take over for me. 
The world is so big, and im such a small peice of it, why did I make such bad decisions? Why cant I be that girl that got lucky and found her Mr.Wright, and he loves her and they have a happy little fucking family togather? Why couldnt I be her. Im not a bad person. It is one thing after another, and I just want my turn to rest, I just want out."

"event","Compatibility For Leo with Aquarius
This pair of the sun and Uranus is usually a good one. Leo likes surprise and Aquarius will be happy to supply it. Both signs are better when doing things for others. Leo loves the world and Aquarius loves humanity. This makes for an excellent combination for a partnership that deals with or caters to the public. Each have a mutual understanding of the other when it comes to intimate matters, needs and desires. There is never a dull moment in their lives as Aquarius holds many surprises for Leo.

While these two will be attracted to one another, they are zodiac opposite which means that it can be as bad as it is good and usually is. 

See the exact opposite thing makes sence cause Dustin is Leo and that would explain why there was so much good and yet sooooooo much bad.

But honestly I am always attracted to Leo's, go figure.

NOW THEN HERE IS WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT THE FOLLOWING SIGNS AND ME, WHERE DO YOU ALL FALL IN? PLEASE REPLY AND TELL ME WHAT YOUR SIGN IS, IM REALLY CURIOUS.

You harmonise best with Gemini, Libra & Aquarius

There is mutual help & support with Sagittarrus & Aries

You either repel or attract Leo

You may ignore, avoid or adapt to Scorpio & Taurus"

I want my body back already. I cant stand this. I feel icky. It is still my legs and my ass and my bigger than ever boobies (I really didnt need bigger boobs) but I have this uncomfortable lump that is getting huge. When the baby moves I get all emotional, like awwww, but every other second besides those are just annoying. I wanna bend over, I wanna run, I wanna have hot nasty sex,(hehe, had to throw that in) I just want it to come out so I can get back into my own skin.
I think it is great that some woman cherish their pregnancies, it is wonderful for them. I am a good Mom and I love being a Mom, but I HATE BEING PREGNANT. Im jealous of flat tummies, and belly button peircings, and the freedom of eating what you want and drinking what you want and Im being a selfish bitch and I will continue to take care of my body so my baby will be healthy, but I am screaming (silently) that I cant fucking wait to have this baby."

My throat hurts really bad, and although I know how much of a wuss I am when it comes to the discomfort of not feeling perfectly healthy I really feel bad. I have tried to snap outta it, drank juice instead of soda, ate salad instead of fast food, and tried to go for walk instead of just lying my head down on my desk but I still feel like crap, this is the last of it though, cause I have been feeling it coming on for like 3 days now and today so far is the worse yet.

I have read some sad shit today too which makes for a depressing ass mood set, so enough of that shit. Lou is staying at his Dad's tonight, which is cool cause my Dad is going over there for dinner, (I know sounds weird huh?) I grew up with my son's dad and while I wouldnt choose to keep him as a buddy ol pal if not for my son my family and his still get along great and will forever, it is better like that for Lou's sake. 

Wanna hear car convo yesterday on the way from daycare to therapy.

Louis: Mom, do you think the baby will look like me?
Me: Im sure you will have some simularities, but not all the same.
Louis: Why?
Me: Cause you have the same Mommy but not the same Daddy as the baby.
Louis: We have the same Daddy, cause I have two Daddies.
Me: That is true but your Daddy Louis and I made you and Your Dustin and I made the baby.
Louis: How did you make me? With tools? 
Me: (In my head, yeah but none that you'd recognize,lol) No honey it was something a lil different.

Then I went on to carefully explain to him how babies are made without too much detail.
Then he says:

Louis: So by egg do you mean the same kind that Uncle Jason came out of?
Me: What?
Louis: Grandma said she didnt give birth to him that she sat on him and he hatched like a chicken egg.
Me: LMFAO Hysterically (gets on the phone with mom while driving)and she says: ""I told him that like a year ago Candice, I was making fun of your brother in front him, she giggles.""

So yeah, I thought it was funny.

Last night I tried to eat, but my appetite just isnt there, I lost 4 lbs since Tuesday, probably not too good since im suppose to be gaining a lb a week now, must call Dr.
Lou had hella homework, and he was being a lil smart ass last night, going ""Duuhhh, Ok Mom"" OMG *SMACK* I was like ""Dude, what is your tude about"", and he would just start giggiling which just makes me laugh and then I cant even get angry at him. He's funny. Then by the time I gave him his bath and did his therapy and put his splint on and did laundry, it was like 10:30. I didnt even shower last night, my ass fell asleep fully dressed, (shoes and all) on the couch and didnt wake up till 6am, good thing too cause I didnt set my alarm either, so I was only a few mins late.
I still basically feel like shit, alien in  body makes for illin Candice. Just a few months left and then it's on like donkey kong, I cant wait to get my body back, woo hoo. Gym here I come. Not that I cant be there now but I just really dont have the time or energy, so nah.
I need luvin, but what's new, and no im not just talkin bout the average lil hug I need some mad luvin. 
 
And MISS MICHELLE D!!!!!!!! The shower is gonna be in a few weeks, I need to get ahold of you to see when,if you think your gonna make it. CALL ME!!! 618-0104 or 225-5140 or 225-5137 or 229-9066, or come to my work.

Hope you all are having a good day."

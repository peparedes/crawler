"event","Well, today is the first day since I've known Ryan that he's not been here.  At least, this is the first time that he's gone for good.  I dont know how I feel.  I was actually pretty proud of myself last night; I made it the whole night without even mentioning his leaving.  I hugged him goodbye, walked to my car and didn't look back.  But as soon as I was sure he wasn't able to see, I cried.  Cried like a baby.  I'm such a sucker.  Wow.
Anyway, today I promise myself not to obsess on his not being here.  There are other people here to see and talk to.  Besides, as soon as school starts again, next week, I will hardly have time to breathe.  I'll be working 40+ hours in addition to 15 hours of school.  I know lots of people do it, I'm not saying I'm special.  I'm just saying there will not be time for getting all worked up over the small stuff.
Well anyway.  I'm crossing my fingers that I like my new store more than the last one.  I worked there once last week.  It went well.  But I sort of have an ominous feeling in my gut.  It's possible that I'm just nervous because I don't want the same thing to happen this time that did last time.  Minetta will probably just wash her hands of me if it does.  And, honestly, I couldn't really blame her.  
Okay, that's it."

"event","man, i'm really worried about my sister.  i feel like she thinks i'm out to get her or sabotage her or something.  and it's not like that at all.  in fact, a lot of the time, she accuses me of something, and i really and truly have absolutely no idea what she's talking about.  i mean, i was reading her livejournal the other day and she said that she thinks i go on her computer while she's gone.  but i dont.  i dont even have any reason to.  i use the computer downstairs.  using her computer would be pointless because the only reason i go on this time of year is to use the internet and i don't know her password.  also, i like to use aim and if i signed on my screenname on her computer, it would show up.  it just hurts my feelings a lot that she thinks i'm doing stuff that i'm not.  and like, when i would watch teevee in her room, it was only because mom and steve monopolize the downstairs teevee and the one in their room is at an awkward angle and it's uber cold in there.  also, if i watched teevee in annalee's room, i actually get some privacy because her room is the last in the hallway. but oh well.
man.  also, annalee has been soooooo moody lately.  and i dont know what's going on.  i dont know if it's just her age or if she's having some sort of trouble that she's not talking about or what, but more than it angers me, it worries me.  i dont know how to help or how to not provoke her.  and it's weird, we'll be totally awesome one minute, and the next she's really mad at me.  sometimes, i dont even know what i did.  oh well, i'm sure things will get better.
and i'm also concerned that she's smoking again.  i saw a cigarette in the toilet the other day.  i caught her smoking last may, and i thought we resolved the problem then, but i don't know now.  i wish she would come to me with these problems.  i want to help her.  i just cant if i dont know what's going on.  and i know she thinks i only want to get her in trouble.  the truth is, i want to keep her out of as much trouble as possible.  damn.  
anyway, i dont know what else to say.  the truth isnt always enough, no matter what anyone says."

"event","oh my goodness, i haven't updated in FOREVER.  what is my problem??
actually, i've just been busy and kinda apathetic to the whole livejournal game.  work is a bitch.  lets just say that whoever devised the 40-hour work week was a damn slavedriver!  
so anyway.
i went with adam to watch him get a tattoo on saturday.  i was soooo jealous.  i want another tattoo so badly, but i'm sort of economically bound.  and i dont know what i want exactly.  so yeah.  and then he bought me some lunch, well, he bought part of it.  hehe.  we went to hops and i got this asian salad thing.  but it was junk!  the chicken was like yesterday's roasted chicken and it was cold and i felt completely dissatisfied.  
after, we went to his apt and just sat around.  it was actually kinda nice to just sit around and yak and do nothing.  ryan never seems to be able to just sit and talk to me. 
last week, on wednesday, zach, dan and i went out.  it was so much fun.  we drove around and went to st pete and tampa and clearwater.  and then we went to bolesco, this coffee shop, and got a hooka.  haha.  it was just comical.  dan the dragonman.
we have tenative plans to get together this week sometime before dan and zach go back to escuela.
oooh i found out that this guy i had a major crush on in ninth grade, who is dating the same girl he's been with for like 3 years or something, works at another walgreens as a senior tech just down the road from the store i'm getting moved to.  it's weird, sorta, to think that i'll be talking to him about work-related stuff... err sometimes.  like calling for interstores and whatnot. hmm
right well, i'm uber tired.  i'm going to bed like a wuss super early.  nighty"

"event","well, despite the fact that's it's completely emo of me, i'm really sad.  and tired.  i've spent the last week so stressed because i had to move out of my apartment and because i was in an awful store with evil people.  but that's all behind me now.  i'm completely moved out of my apartment and my last day at the terrible store was yesterday.  the only sad thing is that there was a guy there that was cool.  he gave me his number... but i probably won't call him.  i'm a chicken and i dunno... i dont think i'm good enough for him.
anyway.
ryan is fixin to leave.  it feels like everyone is leaving me. adam leaves forever in about a month.  ryan is moving to gainesville in a week.  zach is going back to orlando in a couple weeks.  courtney's family is moving to georgia.  my dad and i hardly talk and when we do, i feel totally uncomfortable and on edge.  i dont know what my problem is.
man, i'm so freaking frustrated.  i want to get a laptop.  and i've found the perfect one, but everytime i try to order it, dell says that the link is temporarily broken.  i hope it just means that it's on some sort of backorder.
i must have cried in my sleep last night because when i woke up, my eyes were all puffy and my nose was stuffy.  i vaguely remember a dream about ryan and without trying to be melodramatic, i know it was about him leaving and me not being ready to let go.  it's really pretty sad that he means as much to me as he does.  i dont think i amount to much more than someone to stroke his ego to him... but, what can i say?  i really care about him.  i'm pathetic.
it's about time i get over ryan, and maybe his moving to gainesville is the final push i need.  only time will tell i suppose.  
anyway, i have to go try to clean up my room some.  i guess."

"event","Oh my gosh, today was the Pharmacy Technician Certification Examination... it was the single most difficult test I've ever taken in my life.  I studied for it a bit, but nothing I could have done would have prepared me for the information covered on the exam!  I work in a retail pharmacy... The test is about mostly hospital-related pharmacy.  They asked about infusions and parentrals and D5W(dextrose 5% in water) and all sorts of other stuff that retail pharmacy never deals with.  It was awful.  
One good thing, I saw some people I had worked with at other stores, so I wasn't stuck there all alone.  We ended up hanging out afterward, but man, the test was still uber-hard.  Unnecessarily hard.
And you know what?  I had to work until 1030 last night, then turn around and get up ass early for the damn test that whooped my butt.  Grrrrr.
Now I'm really tired, but I have to wake up relatively early tomorrow so that I can paint my room and finish picking it up.  Blah.  
And my nose won't stop itching.  All around the outside and top of my nose... it itches constantly.  And I've scratched and rubbed it so hard that my nose is really sore...
Oh well, I'm gonna go see if I can round up something to do."

"event","Today was my first day in my new store.  I'm not sure how it went.  No matter what the reason, whenever I work in a store for the first time, I find myself so intimidated by everything.  It's just that, when you work somewhere, you get really comfortable and you know everyone and where everything is, and you know how things are done... but not when you're new to a store.  And at my new store, the pharmacy manager is one of those people who just likes to do everything herself.  And that makes it really hard for me to do my job.  
It's funny how particular I am about things, considering this is my first time as a senior tech.  I mean, there are a bunch of things that I like to see done a certain way, and it really irks me when they are done otherwise.  Also, as much as it seems like I'm being a kiss-ass, I really like to do what the district likes.  That way, the rules aren't mine, and it removes a bit of responsibility.  I know that sounds awful, but what can I say? 
So yeah, there's a certain way the labels are supposed to be pulled from the printer and put on the counter to keep them in time-order.  But the techs at this store pull them the wrong way and everything gets out of sync.  And they separate them into groups and it's makes everything really confusing because there's a huge mess on the counter.  
I really almost gave this one tech some serious attitude.  I had other stuff to do besides fill prescriptions, it was time for me to leave, and I had to finish a half dozen things.  So there was a whole stack of labels on the counter, put on there incorrectly.  But, I took for granted the fact that people would actually keep them in order, and I saw that the top label wasn't due for like two hours.  So I kept on with my stuff, but before I left, I put the labels the correct way, and I saw there were four or five that were past due.  And this other tech, April, was like, these wouldn't be late if *other* people would do what they are supposed to.  I took a lot for me to restrain myself.
I made some baked penne for dinner later in the week.  I kinda want to eat it now, except I ate dinner like an hour and a half ago, so it wouldn't make a lot of sense to eat again now...
Oh my goodness. When I first got to the store, the manager took me on a tour, and the front cashier was this hot boy.  And I was like, things are looking good already... But then later in the day, he came into the breakroom while I was on my lunch, and as is my fate, he's gay.  Oh well.  It's so typical that the one attractive person in the store is both too young and gay.  Haha...
Anyway, I'm gonna go watch Antwone Fisher..."

"event","I am sooooo tired.  Tonight has gone on forever.  My friend Zach and I went to dinner at the Dish and then to the Hard Rock Casino in Tampa.  It was so much fun, although I think my lungs are going to give out on me.  I have never been in such concentrated cigarrette and cigar smoke in my life; it was worse than any bar I've ever been in.  Anyway, we invited Courtney and her friends from Louisiana to go with us, but they're a bunch of boring losers and they opted to stay home and play Monopoly.  Oh well.  So yeah, that was fun.
Then we came home and went to Steak n' Shake for some ice cream to soothe our nearly dead throats... we invited them to come out then, and they initially said no.  So we were on our way to one closer to Zach's house when Courtney's mom called us back and was like, they'll meet you there.  Weird.  I'm still not sure why that happened.  So we turned around and went to the Steak n' Shake in Largo by Courtney's house.  Blah blah blah... Zach and I went back to his house, switched to his dad's Wrangler and went to two different Wal-marts.  I bought the Suicide Kings.
Then I went home.  Zach and I are supposed to rent the Boondock Saints and get some thai food in the afternoon, so I am going to bed... I'm exhausted."

Like today, I can't get the damn mop to do anything I want.  It looks wretched. All I can say is that I'm thankful my hair doesn't look like this girl I work with... her hair is horrendous.
I also, while I'm on the subject of not finding myself attractive, cannot find anything to wear to damn work.  I've settled on a Ron Jon tee.. but I really don't want to wear it.  I think I might be going over to Courtney's when I get off work tonight, so I wanted to wear something that could go from work to play.. but of course, as my wardrobe sucks, that was impossible.  Grrr...
Anyway, I guess I'm gonna go... I have to be at work by 1230 and I have to pick up a few interstores on my way."

"event","So I told myself this morning that I was going to abandon my adolescent melodrama that I am always creating for myself.  But, I've since decided that making such a decision consciously, as a set decision, really undermines the importance of it.  Or more truthfully, the significance of the transformation.  The truth is that I have little to no life and I have to create excitement in my life.  Unfortunately, more often than not, it comes in the form of something rather debilitating... but so it goes.
Moving on..
Talked to Ryan, Dave and Matt tonight. I miss talking to Matt.. we honestly dont really talk about anything of any substance and yet, he might be my favorite person to talk to online or on the phone because I feel absolutely no pressure to live up to any expectations.  Dave has few expectations for me, I'm sure... he seems to sincerely like me for me (as a friend, of course it goes without saying), but since he's known me since I was in eighth grade, he's seen all of me.  Probably more of me than anyone else.  And then there's Ryan... ever present.  And although he himself may have no expectations of me, I have them for myself.  I have a set way in my head to act around him and hardly, if ever, am I successful in living up to it.
Anyway, I need to stop being such a turbo bitch.  I seriously go from normal to bitch way too easily.  My temper needs to be calmed the hell down because the tiniest things piss me off so much lately.  *mental note... as if that'll make a difference.
Okay.. enough ranting.  I'm gonna go to bed, at a decent hour for once."

I'm not sure why, I can't recall any earth-shattering dreams or anything from last night, but I feel incredibly optimistic about everything going on with me.  that's good, too.
Ooohhhh... last night, while I was uber bored, I looked around online for some new <a href=http://www.delias.com/main/html/goto_frameset.epl?g=category.roomwares target=""_blank"">sheets</a> and stuff.  I think they're cute... check them out.

Work... is... inevitably, work.  Sometimes, it seems like it's going to get better and I'm just going to have a great time and everything is going to be perfect and people are going to be nice... but then one person just says or does something so unnecessarily WRONG or MEAN... ugh! They ruin it all.  Not a customer.  They are a nuisance at worst.  But the people I work with, this one lady, Grace, in particular, sometimes drive me to near insanity.  Why they feel compelled to be so rude for no reason is beyond me.  I admit that I am stuckup. It's relatively common knowledge among people who know me.  And, like I said, admit it.  However, owning up to a fault is a far cry from someone calling you it in a manner that is meant to be supremely insulting.  Perhaps I am too sensitive.
Oh well.
The ever-present Ryan rears his head again in my life as more and more of an enigma.  I spent last night with him.  Well, the majority of the night... and sometimes, things feel like how they are is just how they should be, even if, given the chance, I might choose to change them.  But then, in an instant... in a split second, things turn from harmony to a cacophony of harsh crashes because a stick was stuck into the spokes...  Last night, I was really comfortable and happy, but then I made a decision, and although it was probably the right one, it felt kind of wrong.  I want to... even if I don't act like it.  Honestly, I dream and fantasize and presuppose all kinds of situations and events that would happen with him.  But when it comes time to put my money where my mouth is... I fall through. 
Of course.
Also, sometimes, he makes me so angry and HURT because it feels as though he pulls away from my touch.  Why do you do that?  Holding my hand doesn't mean we're married, and despite what I want to be true, I'm not delusional and I know how things are.  
Grrrr....
So it goes... life will, as it always does, go on.  But damnit.

The three girls I had to work with, a pharm tech, a pharm intern and a pharmacist, all kinda had attitude and were really clique-y.  But then, this other pharm intern came in and he was nice.  And then this hot pharmacist came on.  But that only made things better for a few minutes because I tried to talk to him and he had absolutely no sense of humor.
So I was still trying to figure out how I would get to go home early, and then at 3, this guy Mike came on.  And he made everything better.  He was really nice, and I think he's cute.  AND he was working at the same end as me, so I wasnt as bored.
I ended up giving him my number when I left... we'll see if he calls, hopefully he will.  I know it sounds lame, but I really need him to help me get over Ryan... lame, lame, lame.  Oh well.

"event","i have this friend, ryan.  and to be honest, it's no secret that i like him a lot.  he knows, we've talked about it quite a bit, and a lot of those conversations have occurred recently.  the truth is, however, that he does not like me back.  and that's okay.  but, if that's the case, then i just want to get over him and i cant.  it's an awful feeling inside to feel like this and have no outlet.  but it's more than just not having an outlet.  i have no one, and that's the problem, i think.  maybe.  
i say that i'm independent.  and when i'm in a relationship, most of the time, i feel trapped and out of myself.  but when i'm single, i long for someone to hold my hand, touch my face, anything.  i hate being so hypocritical and contradicting.
so anyway, back to ryan, he's moving two and a half hours away in a month.  and to be honest, that really scares me.  for two years, i've known him, and for the greater part of those two years, he's been the one i can depend on for stupid stuff i dont even think he's aware of... even when he makes me mad, he still makes me happy.  and not in the fourth grade crush sort of way, and not in the deeply in love kind of way, but just in a simple sort of you are a good friend who knows me well and still is my friend kind of way.
sometimes, most of the time, practically all of the time, i just wish so much that ryan would be completely honest about his feelings... not necessarily toward me, although that i want to know, but also about this other person in his life who causes me a bit of frustration and a lot of jealousy.
so anyway... instead of carrying on any further with my pseudoromantic falderall.. i am going to go to work."

"event","This Fourth of July, my sister and I embarked on a day trip to Cocoa Beach.  It was my idea to leave in the middle of the night and arrive there in the early morning, visit Ron Jon Surf Shop, and then go to the beach.  As it turned out, we left around 4, got to Ron Jon about 830, and then went to the beach.  My sister decided that she was going to stay up all night the night before we left because she is awful to wake up.  It's actually really funny because she sleeps so deeply that if you are able to get her to wake up, 9 times out of 10, she falls right back asleep and doesn't remember ever waking.  
So anyway, Annalee did not enjoy swimming in the Atlantic.  The water was all together too cold for her enjoyment.  But we did manage to swim for about an hour and a half.  Then we went to Walgreens, across the street, and bought some conditioner and mousse, and primped in the bathroom there.  It was kinda funny.  
Annalee loves Krystal burger.  There is one in Daytona Beach that we were going to go to on the way home, but when we got there, we had already eaten lunch, so we weren't hungry again.  So since there is another location in Ocala, we drove to 40 and took it across to Ocala.  Since we had no scheduled time to be home, we stopped in Ocala National Forest at Mill Dam and went swimming for an hour.  The lady at the visitor center place told us that there was supposed to be a good looking tan young man with a tattoo there all alone.  But Annalee and I could find no one fitting that description.  Maybe she has poor taste.
So then we left, got some Krystal, and drove home.
I almost forgot... On the way from Cocoa to Daytona, while we were on 95, this guy from PA passed us and he was hot.  Annalee thought he had a really cute nose, so she made a sign and I put it in my window.  He smiled.
One last thing, two guys from North Carolina took our picture as we were driving down 75 from Ocala.  Annalee was pissed.  haha.. chances are that the picture didn't come out as were were driving at different speeds.  C'est la vie.
So that's it."

"event","Yeah right.  Sometimes, I just want to scream.  
Natalie, the senior technician at my store, can be such a super bitch.  For no reason, she was freaking out about everything today and I was in no mood to deal with her. Ugh..
Oh man, I hate working with new pharmacists.  They are so anal retentive about everything, it drives me crazy.  Today, this new pharmacist was working at our store, and she was slowing down the whole process.  Where ordinarily we would have had a wait time of 30 minutes, it was like an hour to an hour and a half!
Anyway, I finally talked to Courtney today.  I have been busy, and she's not very good about calling me... so I haven't spoken with her in over a week, which is a long time for us.  So the main reason I wanted to talk to her was to find out how her new apartment was shaping up.  The back story: She and I were supposed to move to Louisiana together to go to LSU.  We were going to live together and stuff and all that jazz... but things didn't work out, so I'm still here and she's there.  Last year, the apartment complex she was staying in paired her with a roommate, Becky.  Becky turned out to be a bitch on wheels with some problems and so she moved out in May.  Since Courtney didn't know anyone and wasn't ready to deal with another roommate, she moved from the two-bedroom she was in to a studio.  But it's super small.  Like 426 sq ft or something ridiculous.  I gave her some stuff out of my apartment.  She was able to use that stuff because it was for the walls and rugs. 
Also, I wanted to find out about her boyfriend, Nick.  I've not met him, and I obviously only know what she's told me about him, but I dont really like him too much.  I just feel like he's trying to invade her life or make her compromise her values, and I hope she doesn't submit to the pressure. 
My sister and I are such nerds... seriously.  We were outside playing with a ball by throwing it on the roof and trying to hit it was a pole.  Then we knocked into the neighbors yard, and I had to endeavor upon a stealth mission to capture our lost ball without our neighbors' knowledge.  All was successful, but it could have been messy."

"event","I work at Walgreens in the pharmacy as a technician.  It's not a big deal; it's a job, not a career.  But recently they've offered me the chance to become a senior technician as soon as I become certified.  FYI, a senior tech is comparable to the immediate manager of pharmacy technicians and pharmacy cashiers.  It's kinda a big deal that they are offering me this promotion since I haven't worked there for that long and because I am only 19... But if I take it, I would have to, have to work 40 hours a week.  I know it doesn't sound like a big deal, but I have to try to schedule a full time class schedule around that.  It's kinda a lot to put on my plate, and I'm not sure I can do it.  
I'm also worried about my FAFSA.  I mailed it ages ago, but I haven't received any paperwork confirming it or anything.  I am going to have to call or something and find out what has happened... I hope nothing has gone wrong or this could really mess things up for me...
Anyway, I guess I just need to really consider what is important to me and let that influence my decisions.
Any suggestions or input, just comment."

"event","So my sister's dad, not my dad, was cleaning out some stuff and he came across a box...  And inside were the pictures of my youth!  Oh, blessed youth! So long ago and nearly forgotten... Anyway, that's what she and I are doing now, digging through some old photos.  Memories.  Sigh.  Meow.  
I think we're gonna go swim in the pond.  So that's it for now.  Annalee, you better post!"

"event","Right... so I did have a livejournal account back in the day before they became all the rage.  That was more than a year ago, maybe as many as two years ago?  I don't really remember.  But now, I have a new account!  Woot!  This is exciting.  It's like Christmas, less the wrapping paper and annoying family.  Anyway, I wanna go play around with this and junk.  

later"

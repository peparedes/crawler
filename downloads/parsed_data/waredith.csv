"event","I keep forgetting lj pretty effectively, it seems...
Well, I have nothing to write here anyway really so maybe that's okay then.

I should edit my NaNo. But it's also way too easy to forget somewhere under my bed and then it gets mouldy and I stuff it further in. Out of my sight. Because I can't get anything done now, my BA thesis is dead... That too.

And everything else too for the matter.

I arrived home yesterday from the spring camp. It was lovely (most of the time). So now I'm knackered... Dead tired and still I need to get to uni tomorrow to do my job as an opponent to Oskari. Even if my own thesis is dead atm...

Sigh."

Eris just won't let me download Et Cetera Discordia. Stop the discordian propaganda!

That's not what I came here to tell you though.

I just washed my hands. And dried them in my big towel which I've been using for a looong time.
And it stabbed me. I now have a bleeding hole in my thumb.

I am mildly... confused."

Yes...

Life is weird and I think the looming end of the world began in may 2010. Probably.
It's not ended yet. But it has begun =) With the slow dying of everything beautiful.

I'm going to buy myself a shirt today, and sew on it with lacey ribbons and glitter the text: 
I AM CIRCUS


Confusion."

"event","Last night... 00:00 I started to write. Despite the fact that I'd been celebrating kekri last weekend ==> almost no bloody sleep whatsoever... And then you start writing and agonising and feeling sorry for your FMC and then it's 3 a.m. and you think the desk you're sitting by is floating with a 60 degree angle to the floor... And then... you go home... And at halv past 4...

It is time to go to sleep. Because you reached 104% of your wordcount goal ^^
...and then you dream of people who make you and your friends eat daterapedrugs or smth...


Whoa.

I'm knackered.

Uni soonish. Did anyone see my brain?



EDIT: I got dressed. Brown teaparty dress. White fluffy kneesocks. And a white collarshirt.

I feel like a fucking gingerbread (with a knife)."

I - OFFICIALLY - HATE - LIVEJOURNAL. WHY THE FUCK CAN THEY NOT MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR NON-NERDS TO ALTER THE COLOUR OF THE BLOODY JOURNAL EASILY AND WITHOUT THE NEED TO GET A STUPID CUSTOM-THINGY FIRST WHICH IS ALL FUCKED UP LAYOUT-WISE AND AND AND... fuck it. I hate this shit.


And the earlier journal from before LJ fucked with my brain:

Abney Park =( Stupid SiS Bolig (the people who I paid my rent to while in Norway) stole me money, so now I has none for Abney goodies... AND I REALLY NEED THEM D'=

I got nuts when I saw who'd made the Saints and Sinners AP cuffs *drooooooool*


Why

Why

...

Why... ='C 

Mates... Give me the last olive cuff and I will not make the world one fcking big lake of tears (because... you know.. that would make it difficult for airships, yes? ...The air... full of water... and various other stuff you have in tears...)

Off to emo now... =C

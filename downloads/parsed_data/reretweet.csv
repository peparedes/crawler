So Hannah's party is the same night as my party and I don't want to even hand out invitations now because I don't want people to have to choos, so if you don't come it is okay, I'll have my real friends, just joking. OKay because I am leaving next week and then again in July I think I better just stick the hell hole out. It's only a few weeks and it looks like they are cutting my hours. STAR WARS THIS WEEKEND."

"event","This is the first happy entry I've written in a long time and I am actually happy. Last night was the bomb diggady. We all went to Celebration Station in order to let loss for a minute and boy did we ever. I won and stole about five hundred tickets, I will return and I will win something good. We got banned from go karts cause Joe and Tristan decided to make the whole thing a demolition derby with some people we don't even know, it was kinda funny. This little boy knock the hell out me going down the hill and I went after him but it look like he was scared so I stopped. These cute guys were there, but with their girl-friends that's when I decided you know what I've never had to be the one chasing before, so why am I trying so hard now, I'm not so I'll sit back and wait cause frankly I'm a little too tired to be trying to attrack somebody. Well this is the good part Raj and Germaine stole some golf balls, golf ball, golf balls? Why? I don't know. 

While attempting to the parking lot we all almost crashed into the barrier at the end of the parking lot, Raj's fault, then me and Germaine spent the remainder of the drive trying to get Trae, Raj, adn Tristan's attention because we wanted to go to Pizza Hut instead of Taco Bell. They were too busy trying to kill themselves to pay any attention to us. But somehow I took Germaine all the way home and still managed to get there only seconds after Raj and Tristan it was really kind of funny. 

I learned how much I reallt appreciate all of these people, they knew I was kind of down and I think everybody did tried to help me with that and it worked because I am no longer down. I've learned from my experiences and I want to grow from them. I also want to go back to celebration station some time around my birthday what do we think? 

Oh tonight is the night I lay it hard on my mother, I really really really really really really really really want to get a belly ring Monday night or Tuesday since I have to work on my birthday, I think it would look realy good on me and I like acessories I can't lose.

I was thinking about what Trae said about music and I was kind of on the same track today in the car. It was like everything that came on was about me and I sunk deeper into I hate the world mood. I swear this is not what my last few weeks of highschool was supposed to be like. 

Boy News
I saw my ex boy-friend Saturday and it was kind of weird, he looks just like Bobby Valentino now. I was really funny b/c I remember when we were dating he wasn't very cute he was just so nice and I was so vein, he called me too many times and people started referring to me as he's and I broke it off after about two days, no lie. Some Cierra song reminded me of this. And then I saw Fantasia's Truth Is and boom Cherie there is life all over the television. Jaren is still nice but there was never that chemistry there, I think we're going to be friends now and I'm happy about that seeing we haven't talked in years, we were such good friends before we started talking and before, I broke his heart? I don't know he said it not me, but do we see a pattern forming here people, I have to study now goodnight."

This is some bullshit, I hate school, I hate everything about computers now, and I will never in a place that makes me use excel. I went to work and everybody knew I was in a bad mood, I said hey to everybody and walked in the back with out my usual joke session with Tracey and Jill. I was heating up a water bottle and Tracey walked back there and asked me if I was in a bad mood, she said she could see it all over my face. I work with dogs and disease filled cats all damn day, I was just at an elementary school where a child decided to wipe the chalk board with his face and if I don't get at least a C on this exam I am going to have to pay 600 to this crack-head school. No offense to anyone who is going here but I hate this school. Tuesday night people we are getting crunk and that ain't no lie. If you can't hang don't come. I was tricked into making to food for over 100 people for this stupid senior shit, it better be good too cause if it and I will be irate. 
    I am here studying with Elliot early in the damn morning and we tok a five minute break, this fool done fell asleep and then scare himself with his own phone, which was only on vibrate. I tell you what I might just fake some type of attack during this test, I am not above that, I am nervous and all this pressure is going to make my hair fall out. 


Badder news, I can't take the job with Zah, my mother doesn't want me delivering and putting more miles on my car going back and fourth. And she doens't think the job will pay for the gas I use doing the job, so now I have to apply to jobs quick before the college students start doing, hey I am about to be a college student.

Trae went to the mall with me Friday and we had some fun, then we went to the cultural fair with Kevin, Funmi, and Toyin, it was really good seeing one of my homies from DHS, I'm really miss them at times and hanging with Toyin really brought back some memories. As much stuff as I talk about DHS I really love my peps there. Oh Anna thanks, for making me your backup friend when you and joe aren't hanging out, I really feel special. I'm am in denial as to how this week is going to go, cause there is just so much stuff to be done it is ridiculous but I am going to do and graduate and we're going to have fun so let's do this and get on out of here."

"event","I comfronted him on his newly found repetition with the ladies, I wasn't angry, there was something so calm, something so confident driving me. I would be the first to call Mr. WOnderful on his actions, I know there was no physical reward but there was some type of closer there for me, but then there is really no closure. He became unconfortable, he even started to sweat a little, then I saw his arrogant grin turn into an unsettled stare, then there was angry. He demand I tell him who was spreading these lies about him; I refused, I was not looking for a fight just a little tussle but not a fight. His anger then switched to me, I was his enemy now, I was the one who didn't know him or his heart, and quite honestly I couldn't deny that. The one thing that lacked in our relationship was trust, I didn't trust him and he doesn't trust me and he shouldn't because what I have in store for him is...while maybe it's better if I didn't say. But what I am feeling is cold, so cold it would make the devil buy a winter coat. I have to remember this is not about revenge this is about lessons, lessons that no one else would dare to teach, I have always been a daredevil and will use that to my advantage.

Okay today was a fair day, lovely weather, got some things done, got to leave community service early and the negative end I don't know where me and Elliot stand right now but if I am being brutally honest I really don't give a damn. This weather is so amazing one day it's raining and the next it is wonderful and sunny. Tristan was able to amuse me this morning by cracking on Anna. I believe his exact words were, ""your butt got smaller and your mouth got bigger"" Hilarious I know. I guess that's it for today, I hope Trae is having fun."

Trae was big pimpin the whole night (b/c he's a hoe). We went all over creation to drop and pick people up, I got blisters on my feet from dancing because yes I was shakin' my ass even though Chonasty was standing on the floor telling everyone what they were doing wrong, and the broadway musicals were a little weird but put that all aside it was a pretty good night. I drove the BENZ baby, it won't happen for another twenty years but hey whatever. Highlight of my night I danced with a gay man and he's still gay. Thanks to Funmi I know where to look for a few good men. And last but not least I stayed up past one o'clock and I wasn't seeing things.

Okay so when I completly ignoring McAllister in english I've started writing poetry and it's not half bad contrary to what anyone may think. I've realized that there is a lot of despire in my life. I was thinking about how much I ask my mother to do and how much she has to do and I just started crying. There is no reason why my father shouldn't take part in paying for my college education other then the fact that he is a complete jerk off, I mean I love my family so much and I think that is what makes me so angry that I love these people and they just keep stepping on my face and taking advantage of my mother and if I had anything say in this matter they would all be cast off this island. 
Here's what really pissed me off last night, I was at home minding my own business sleep on the sofa in the den, I had just finished my cry and I was hot literally and figurtavily( I cannot spell anything) so I was trying to relax, my sister and our neighbors came in there and woke me up to ask me what a thesis was. I told them once and I guess I didn't put it in idiot language because they asked me again and again so then I got pissed off and out neighbor started talking shit, my mother told her it was time to leave so she and her sister left, then my sister got an attitude. I was already pissed off with her brother (yes he's my brother too but I'm not claiming them at this point in my life) so I thought it would only be right to take it out on her so I basically yelled until she went in her room and closed the door, then I went back to sleep and had a dream about ponys.

So I got up this morning already stressed out bc I made the biggest mistake of my life yesterday by writing that boy that damn email. I really wish I hadn't done that but anyway I was calming done during my quiet time when I started looking for my brand new timberlands to go with this very comfortable top set I have on today. I looked high and low for them, I went outside looked in both cars and then I looked inside again. Then I asked my lying ass sister if she saw them and she of course said no surprise, surprise. That is okay because I know either Candace Lanelle Edwards has them or Jeremy Douglas Edwards has them, either way somebody gon pay. Jeremy is mad at e because I hid my PS2 from him, all he has to do is pay me my money and there would be no problem but we have to act stupid and I am so tired of being nice to these bitches. I am going to get everything they owe and more, if I call anybody in the next two days please pick up the phone, I'll probably need bail money.


On the the happy end of the spectrum prom is coming up, which I am looking forward to just so I can say I participated. Trae finished his work for this week so he won't be stressed out and to the point of man crying thing anymore, Anna isn't upset right now, I worked everything out with Tristain and Joy is still a bitch (Had to insult you sense I didn't do it yesterday). I feeling really confident about finding another job or a summer job now because I can't stand these people anymore, even better I could be getting a job with some of my friends which is even better. Countdown to college days has begun and I am excited, sad and scared all at the same time. I am ready to be in college and be done with it but I am not ready to leave my friends, live with a complete stranger, and share a bathroom with nasty people."

I was in a pretty bad mood this morning because I had to go to work and then come to school, which isn't that bad when I thought about it because I get to go home this afternoon and have to do shit. I have become really calm about my present work situation, I have decided after prom I will truly quit. I don't think I am appreciated and I truly believe they take advantage of me. I feel guilty when I go out of town and then when I come  back, I get a bunch of attitude, they must of forgot that I am black and the queen of attitude. I'm not going to let it get to me though because I know this storm will pass. Plus I can't wait to have my Friday's free soon. We all went out Friday afternoon before I went to work and it was so cool. I finally got to hang out and loosen up before I go to work for the devil. I just thought of something funny.

My Apologies to anyone who may become offended but not every white person is a cracker.
We got off of work Friday and I got a phone call from Brian, the only other Black person at my job but anyway, I pick up the phone and he's like ""Ree I hate crackers"", then we got into this big conversation about how they treat like slaves and they act like their above us and all this other shit. It felt good to know that I'm not alone with my feelings. My family was talking about this, this weekend and I finally understood. 

I have decided not to let this shit get to me anymore bc like I said it won't last forever, and it will be over soon."

I was supposed to go with Trae at first but I realized that I can't do that. This is the senior prom and I think everyone should have a chance to go with who they really want to go with. (I promise I won't call out any names.) Then there was Tristain, which would of been a great idea because I could talk shit and he could talk shit and we would have a grand ole time. Now everyone wants my to do a pity date with (you know who it is and there's no need for me to say it out loud.) Now I am all stressed out and don't even want to go to prom anymore. I have a few choices for dates now, Trae if he doesn't have a date, so many problems could arise from this, Clayton, but Anna said he would just try to rape me after prom, BITCH. Then there is the ever popular hook up date from MS> Johnson, the possibilities are endless here. I could go from ugliest to beautiful man in the world but if I know my friend I know that if the boy looks good he is already on her lay away plan just in case her number 1 man doesn't work out so well."

Last night was horrible, I went with my dad to McDonalds and he completely and totally bashed my mother; if I weren't so used to it I would have been surprised but at this point I'm just mad. My mother left him over seven years ago and he is still bitchin' about it, I'm like get the fuck over it man. I'm like damn is it that serious. My biggest problem is that he doesn't know how to care more about his kids then his own fuckin' problems, because it's all about him and what she did to him. My question is what about me? What about my brother? What about my sister? The only father I've known for the last seven years died in September, when my grandfather was burried. 
OKay now I'm going to move on cause I still got alot of shit to get of my chest. So the guy will call him Stupidman 1, I was talking abouy in my first entry we're friends or whatever so me and my best friend Trae invited him to join us in finishing our homework for English. I get into English today and he ask me what time we are meeting and I told him 2:30, he goes outside calls Trae and tells him we are going to meet at 12:00 because he doesn't want to meet late. Once again What About Me. I am doing community service and he's like do some other time. MotherFucka I don't want to do it another time, I want to do it the time me and my friend scheduled originally. I know I come off as a bitch or whatever sometimes but that's only because I take in a lot of bullshit from people and don't say anything about until I get mad. Contrary to what people think I do have feelings and they get hurt really easily. I'm not going to say I go home and cry because I don't but I mean can a get a little respect, it's bad enough I probably won't ever let myself fall in love with anyone again but I mean for him to keep doing stuff to piss me off, is that really necessary?

For the past two years I have let him decide whether I was going to be in a good mood or a bad one. He's gone from girl to girl while I was sitting back watching, I kept thinking that one day it would be me. I kept allowing myself to get sucked into the flirting and all that other good stuff because maybe I was really in love. I have learned what a space filler is and I have determined that maybe I am a space filler. Maybe he's paying attention to me now because there is no one else around; and that hurts me more then anything else. I know that he doesn't realize he is doing this but it still hurts. The worst part about it is I'm supposed to be the tough girl who doesn't let guys do these things to me, and when it's all said and done that's all bull-shit."

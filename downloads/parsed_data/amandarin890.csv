wow.
it's very powerful. it makes me cry to think how racism pretty much can never be cured.
i would advise you all to watch the movie, it might make you think twice."

i dont like it. 
all of this drama& bad things going on- its all too heavy.
life after of high school isnt this concentrated.
i cant wait.

JR year... i keep catching myself thinking it has gone on for a while. but no.
and its only going to get worse.


the only thing keeping me going.... is knowing i will make good memories and friendships that will hopefully last a long, long time."

<P>&nbsp;</P><PRE style=""FONT: 12px arial"">I remember when the days were long,
And the nights when the living room was on the lawn.
Constant quarreling, the childish fits, and our clothes in a pile on the ottoman.
All the slander and double-speak 
Were only foolish attempts to show you did not mean
Anything but the blatant proof was your lips touching mine in the photobooth.

And as the summer's ending, 
The cool air will put your hard heart away.
You were so condescending...
And this is all that's left:
Scraping paper to document.
I've packed a change of clothes and it's time to move on.

Cup your mouth to compress the sound,
Skinny dipping with the kids from a nearby town.
And everything that I said was true,
As the flashes blinded us in the photobooth.
Well, I lost track, and then those words were said.
You took the wheel and you steered us into my bed.
Soon we woke and I walked you home,
And it was pretty clear that it was hardly love.

And as the summer's ending, 
The cool air will rush your hard heart away.
You were so condescending.
And this is all that's left:
Scraping paper to document.
I've packed a change of clothes and it's time to move on.

And as the summer's ending,
The cool air will rush your hard heart away.
You were so condescending,
As the alcohol drained the days.

And as the summer's ending,
The cool air will rush your hard heart away.
You were so condescending.
And this is all that's left:
The empty bottles, spent cigarettes.
So pack a change of clothes, 'cause it's time to move on.</PRE>"

"event","well i guess today proves you can never know how a day turns out.

in the morning, bright n early, i went to hospital with chase(sorry i woke you up!!)
then i hung out with nicole/anna/wes for about 20 mins, till i decided to go to starbucks with bridget
the APers studied a while, then we just sat around. 
then i ended up going to the maroon 5 concert <<who i just found out today, that today was the concert>> with jon, jon, and kayla.
we ate some good food.
then we got to meet the fricking band. i love jons mom. fo sho.
the concert was great; first act wasnt very good(sounded the same) but i did like the thrills alot. 
then maroon 5 did a superb job. very entertaining:]
im kind of runing off adreneline right now, i need sleep becuase i have to get up early for church, then wont get home till late b/c of all the sweet birthday parties tomorrow.
LOVE YOU ALL

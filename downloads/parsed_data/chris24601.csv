As of about 1PM EST my Dad and I have set out on a two-and-a-half week road trip across the Northwest.

My mom, sister, brother-in-law, and niece are flying out to meet us later in the week while we're in Montana).<br /><br />Around noon we were ready to go... here are our intrepid adventurers ready to go (I'm the one outside the car, my Dad is at the wheel).<br />&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: center""><img alt="""" align=""middle"" width=""400"" height=""300"" src=""http://i35.tinypic.com/wm02h4.jpg"" /></p><p>We set out heading north into Michigan.

"event","With all the distractions I've had going on the last six months or so (during which time I've relocated my business and been swamped with work from a number of new clients), it completely escaped me that I had never actually finished posting all of my latest fanfic.

Julie Monroe had never named a father on Lucy&rsquo;s birth certificate so, regardless of the physical similarities and Lois&rsquo; admission, Family Services wanted more concrete proof of her relationship to Lucy before they went any further.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 11pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""""><font face=""Times New Roman"">The question was; further towards what? She&rsquo;d told Mr. Scott in no uncertain terms that, now that she knew about her, she wanted to be a part of Lucy&rsquo;s life. But that was so vague as to mean anything and that was because she kept coming back to the same question again and again in her mind; could she really take responsibility for an eleven-year old girl?</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 11pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""""><font face=""Times New Roman"">Okay, it wasn&rsquo;t like she was in diapers and needed constant attention; Lucy&rsquo;s ability to get herself to Smallville and across town to her apartment on her own spoke to a fair degree of independence on her part; possibly too much.

In two years Lucy <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal"">would</i> be a teenager. She remembered how clueless she&rsquo;d thought her father had been during those years with her and he had been a grown man with more than a decade of parenting and several decades of actual life experience under his belt. Plus, he&rsquo;d been her father, the one who&rsquo;d raised her since she was a baby. How in heaven was she, a virtual stranger, supposed to enforce discipline on a teenage girl when she was just a half dozen years past being a teenager herself?</span></font></span><font face=""Times New Roman""><span style=""font-size: 11pt""><o:p></o:p></span></font></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 11pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""""><font face=""Times New Roman"">Further, she&rsquo;d never be able to replace Lucy&rsquo;s mother. For all the girl&rsquo;s hopes that finding her flesh and blood would make everything just like it was before Lois knew that such a thing was impossible and she would be the one having to deal with that fallout. Given all her own issues regarding the death of her father was she even remotely qualified to try and help this girl get back to a normal life?</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 11pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""""><font face=""Times New Roman"">True, the definition of &lsquo;qualified&rsquo; for a blood relative was a lot less stringent than for a non-relative, but that just made Lois&rsquo; logical side even more upset. After all, what did blood really matter when it came to raising a child? Just look at Martha and Clark. He wasn&rsquo;t even from the same planet and yet when you looked at them you couldn&rsquo;t see anything other than a mother and her son.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 11pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""""><font face=""Times New Roman"">Lois, on the other hand, felt like she didn&rsquo;t even have a reference point in the same galaxy for what it would take to be a mother; it had been two-decades since she&rsquo;d been abandoned by her own. What she knew of parenting at all she knew from her father&hellip; the only reason she was even here was because of his final lesson in what it meant to be a parent.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 11pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""""><font face=""Times New Roman"">Lois&rsquo; eyes moistened at the thought.

It was something far deeper.

Sure she was getting by right now and even saving a little; but it wasn&rsquo;t like she was rolling in money.

Family Services would be turning her life upside down and inside out if she wanted custody of Lucy. Actually it had already started. As per the fine print in the release she had signed before the needle had been stuck into her arm, her blood was going to be checked for more than just a DNA match, which could have been done with just a mouth swab.</span></font></span><font face=""Times New Roman""><span style=""font-size: 11pt""><o:p></o:p></span></font></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 11pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""""><font face=""Times New Roman"">At least she didn&rsquo;t worry what they&rsquo;d find there. Other than caffeine, which to her qualified as a food group, the strongest drug in her home was aspirin and she&rsquo;d never felt the need to drink much; she didn&rsquo;t like to lose control and even a single glass of wine was enough to give her petite frame a buzz. Her drunken binge after Lex had dumped her had been the painful exception to that rule and that was a low point she was determined never to repeat; so much so that she had actually poured what little alcohol was left in her apartment down the drain the following day&hellip; admittedly more out of spite than an actual desire to become a teetotaler. </font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 11pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""""><font face=""Times New Roman"">No, it was the rest of her life that concerned her.

He&rsquo;d had to take the already overburdened city bus line because his car, like so many others, was still sitting on the interstate. Between the gridlock caused by the initial rush to recover their cars and the fact that many had left their cars running when they&rsquo;d been abandoned there were probably a hundred thousand or more automobiles blocking the lanes of the interstates that were either out of gas, or wrecked, or blocked in by a car that was. FEMA had already set up a number of locations where people could put in their information to retrieve their cars and shuttles that would be departing throughout the day as, mile by mile, they worked their way through the mess.

No one had said anything in so many words but it was clear to everyone that the last few days had finally catalyzed them into a couple. As much as Jim liked Mr. Luthor he had to admit that Lex&rsquo;s belief that Lois had feelings for Superman couldn&rsquo;t have been more off target. He&rsquo;d never seen Lois and Lex&rsquo;s relationship before Superman had shown up, but it had always been pretty obvious to Jim that it wasn&rsquo;t some mysterious and distant alien Mr. Luthor was losing out to; it was the friend and co-worker who&rsquo;d just been there for Lois day after day while Lex had become ever more distant.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 11pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""""><font face=""Times New Roman"">Whatever the specifics were, their couplehood was clear enough that Hendricks from accounting had been able to collect on the office pool.

She didn&rsquo;t have to say who. One thing Jim had learned was that those who did not participate usually became the object of the bets. Lois, he had learned, did not participate much in any office recreation. Abby Dawkins, Perry&rsquo;s secretary, had confided in him that Lois had only attended one office New Year&rsquo;s party in the five years she&rsquo;d worked here and that was only because Perry had forced her and even then she&rsquo;d slipped away almost immediately. She just didn&rsquo;t go out of her way to make friends; which was why after just a few months Jim probably had more friends at the Planet than Lois had made in five years.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 11pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""""><font face=""Times New Roman"">That said, though she didn&rsquo;t go out of her way to make conversation, Jim had always found Lois to be social enough; with other people anyway. His article the day after her front page Superman exclusive had chilled her opinion of him greatly. Despite that Jim still didn&rsquo;t regret writing the piece. It was all factually true; just yesterday Kal-El had even admitted to being an alien and people HAD been fearful of Superman; and Jim would never feel bad about writing the truth, even if it hurt. Still, he was glad that Lois and Clark had ultimately been proven right about Kal-El&rsquo;s benevolence. Maybe now that she had been proven right they&rsquo;d be able to move past the earlier bitterness and be friends&hellip; or at least be cordial.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 11pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""""><font face=""Times New Roman"">Considering the office pools again Jim decided to hedge his bets and on more than just the office pool. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pass on the first,&rdquo; he said finally. &ldquo;Put me down for six months on an engagement.&rdquo; Even if Lois did find out about the betting pool she couldn&rsquo;t be mad that he&rsquo;d bet on a speedy courtship and happily ever after&hellip; he hoped.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 11pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""""><font face=""Times New Roman"">&ldquo;Suit yourself,&rdquo; Jenny said as she veered off for her desk.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 11pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""""><font face=""Times New Roman"">It was maybe five minutes after that when the objects of the betting pools emerged from the elevators and into the City Room.

Regardless, as a figment of the imagination it was up to his creators to speak for him and that was Lois and himself. Still, all the bluster and outrage preceded by the months of distrust and at times outright condemnation by the press made Superman coming to them for a second time seem plausible, which was why they&rsquo;d gone ahead and written the story.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 11pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""""><font face=""Times New Roman"">It was rather ironic really.

The whole point of Superman was to protect his family and friends from those looking to exploit his powers or exact revenge for having thwarted their plans. If people thought that he or Lois could just call up Superman on the phone whenever they needed him that would pretty much defeat the whole purpose of the disguise. For that reason alone, Superman was going to hold on to the mystique his silence had garnered as much as possible and he and Lois were going to be getting their stories the old fashioned way; keep their eyes and ears open and ask lots of questions.</span><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 11pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""""><font face=""Times New Roman"">Well, that reason and because </font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt""><font face=""Times New Roman""><st1:place w:st=""on""><span style=""font-size: medium"">Clark</span></st1:place><span style=""font-size: medium""> didn&rsquo;t exactly like being on the other side of the story.

When he focused on a distant point the gravity field which gave him many of his powers somehow reached out and conducted the sounds vibrations from that distant point to his ears rather like a tin can and string telephone could.

It looked like half the population of Metropolis had been gathered into the city&rsquo;s main park. From his vantage point near the edge of park he could see dozens, perhaps hundreds of the Kryptonian robots stalking the perimeter.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">&ldquo;Is that&hellip;?&rdquo; Vicky began as she too saw the red-cloaked figure in the distance floating up to Brainiac.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">&ldquo;&hellip;Superman,&rdquo; Jim finished; saying the name like a curse. For a time he&rsquo;d truly believed that the man in the red cape was a hero. He&rsquo;d almost let himself hope that Lois had been right all this time. He never so badly wanted to be wrong, because a Superman was about the only chance this sorry world had against the likes of Brainiac. The sight of Superman floating side-by-side with the monster Brainiac just proved though that knights in shining armor were nothing but fairy tales.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><font face=""Times New Roman""><i style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal""><span style=""color: windowtext"">Well, the world would know the truth</span></i><span style=""color: windowtext"">, Jim vowed as he again pulled out his cell phone and dialed Perry&rsquo;s number.</span></font></span><font face=""Times New Roman""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><o:p></o:p></span></font></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" align=""center"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: center""><span style=""font-size: medium""><s><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><span style=""mso-tab-count: 9"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></s></span><s><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></s></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">The sky around Brainiac crackled with energy as its task of remaking the world continued. As it had on worlds beyond measure, it would bring order for the greater glory of Krypton and her people embodied in the Lord Kal-El. Yet never before had it faced such opposition as it had here. This world had poisoned the Lord&rsquo;s mind in a manner it had never seen happen before. That it had taken a full battery of mental flash learning to undo that taint was evidence to how corrupt this world was; how much it needed to be cleansed and brought perfect order.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">Admittedly, in Brainiac&rsquo;s assessment, a good portion of Kal-El&rsquo;s rebellion could be traced to the biological imperative. It was the single aspect of Jor-El&rsquo;s design that was indeed flawed; though effectively immortal the desire for a mate was present in all biological organisms and, lacking a fellow Kryptonian to mate with, it was only natural that Kal-El would come to desire a companion from among the beings his image was molded from; the lowly and disgusting natives of this world. Brainiac had done its best to correct this difficulty and, though it considered the solution to be far from perfect, it was the best that could be achieved.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">&ldquo;Vrill Dorax Ran.&rdquo;</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">Its name echoed unexpectedly from behind it in the elegant Kryptonian language and for a fraction of an instant its systems reacted as they always did against a potential threat; by raising its impenetrable shields; a gravitic distortion as extreme as that of a black hole; able to bend back even light itself if need be.

So instead he flipped the mode over to camera, turned it around to face him and Vicky and snapped a picture for no reason other than to do something other than just sit and wait. He then snapped a picture of Amy and Nathan.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">Jim loved photography even more than he did writing. While it wasn&rsquo;t entirely true that a picture was always worth a thousand words when it came to conveying the news, a good picture often made the difference between an average story and the front page.

Looking up at the window it seemed as if the very air was shuddering in anticipation. Getting up, Jim ran to the window for a better look. Moments later the sky in the distance tore open with a brilliant light as what looked to be another wall of energy hundreds of feet tall and equally as wide erupted into the sky.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">Then dark shapes began to appear on the surface of the light; shapes that were racing outwards into the twilight like rockets.

In response one of the other occupants Jim had been holed up with, a burly man that he&rsquo;d gathered was named Ed, charged the construct with a metal pipe. He never reached it. The construct&rsquo;s eyes flared and Ed burst into flames so intense that in moments there was nothing left but char covered bones. Jim could hear Vicky, Amy and Nathan cry out in panic while one of the other men in back cursed.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">&ldquo;<i style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal"">You will come</i>,&rdquo; the construct repeated in the same flat monotone.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">&ldquo;Right then,&rdquo; Jim said as he picked himself up off the ground. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">As he moved towards entrance and beckoned the others to follow he again pulled out his camera phone and wondered if the creature would allow him to use it or if he would share Ed&rsquo;s fate.

Yet for all her wildest imaginings she never could have conceived of the sights and sounds that greeted her. The first thing she was aware of was a dull roaring sound. The next was the column of light rising before her and seeming to climb into infinity; glowing streams of fractal patterns flowing up from the center of a chamber so vast she could not see its top. As her eyes rose higher and higher she became aware of the shapes looming over her. Gigantic statues of robed figures over thirty feet in height towered over her to either side, supporting a massive pockmarked sphere easily thirty feet across directly above her; a representation of what could only be Krypton.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">As Lois spun around in place for a better look she was able to get a better look at the chamber&rsquo;s edge and at last found the source of the rumbling roar. A waterfall a hundred feet tall tumbled down the wall behind her, gathering in a massive pool at its base. The walls, which looked like silvery multifaceted crystal, seemed to glow with a soft internal light and as she followed it along she was able to make out the roughly circular shape of a chamber large enough to hold a football field. Three more waterfalls and their pools, each at one of the cardinal points relative to the first lined the edges of the chamber. Almost lost amidst the sheer vastness of it all were gaps in the walls that could only be passageways to other chambers.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">It took Lois almost a minute to regain the power of speech and from the look on his face, </font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><st1:place w:st=""on""><span style=""font-size: medium"">Clark</span></st1:place><span style=""font-size: medium""> was faring no better in the words department. &ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; she finally managed softly, though the exclamation did not begin to describe the sheer immensity of what she was seeing.

She couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder what he&rsquo;d looked like before. The statues held no answers for her though, for their faces were nothing more than blank masks.

He had finally called an end to the planning meeting when it became clear that there was simply nothing that could be planned at this point. The fact of the matter was there was nothing they could do about the bolts of energy raining from the sky around the city of </span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on""><span style=""font-size: medium"">Metropolis</span></st1:city></st1:place><span style=""font-size: medium"">; there was nothing to target and no enemy to fight. Sam could feel in his bones though that the situation would change soon enough. A simple truism of warfare was that no matter how technologically advanced a military force was you couldn&rsquo;t actually hold territory without feet on the ground.</span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">So if there was nothing to be done, Sam reasoned, he shouldn&rsquo;t waste what time he had with people he couldn&rsquo;t stand, but with the person he cared about. As he walked Sam considered the people who had been his advisors. He considered himself a good judge of character; one did not rise to the rank of general without the ability to evaluate others.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">Of the three, the one he found easiest to tolerate was Dr. Irons. The man clearly knew his science and was willing to think outside the box when it came to solutions. Dr. Irons also had an aversion to killing, which any professional warrior liked. He&rsquo;d met many scientists who&rsquo;d developed all manner of ways to increase the lethality of weaponry over the years, but far fewer with a genuine passion for non-lethal solutions. Sam suspected this was in part because those scientists were detached from the end results; something a soldier could achieve only if they were an utter psychopath. Sometimes killing had to be done, but it was nothing to enjoy. Sam had read Dr. Iron&rsquo;s file en route to Metropolis and in addition to his space plane design, the man was also in the process of developing an EMP weapon for the military to disable vehicles and installations without harming the occupants and this sonic weapon looked very promising for use against anything that wasn&rsquo;t a super-powered alien.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">The only thing Sam could really fault Dr. Irons on was his choice of employer. Lex Luthor was very charming Sam had to admit; beguilingly so. When he spoke it was with an air of confidence and authority which suggested to those not paying close attention that his opinion was the correct one in any given situation. Coupled with intelligence and a great deal of ambition it made Lex Luthor a very powerful and influential man; one able to turn the ear of many inside the beltway. He was a man who had seen death and betrayal and survived both through sheer force of will. He could tell from the way he spoke and way he stood that he was a man who very much wanted to be in control of everything in his life. There was also a darkness to Lex Luthor; something primeval and predatory. It was something the man warred against, Sam could tell, but it was there all the same. Combined with that desire for control, it made Sam very grateful that Lois was no longer in a relationship with him; she deserved better.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">As for the last of his advisors, Sam could not find the difference between the young woman named Lana Lang and his niece to be more striking. Though Lois was very pretty, Lana Lang was poised and elegant with perfect silken hair and the sculpted beauty of a porcelain doll. She had received degrees from some of the most prestigious universities in the world and associated with the most powerful and prestigious people on Earth. But she was utterly dead inside and that frightened Sam more than even Lex Luthor; for there but for the grace of God was what his niece could have become.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">The analogy of the porcelain doll was an apt one, for they too were hollow inside. Lois had distanced herself from people out of grief, but he had seen the spark of life in her eyes when she glanced at her friend Clark and the genuine tears of gratitude upon receiving her father&rsquo;s dog tags. There was still a soul hiding underneath the emotional scar tissue which covered her heart. It could be a burden, Sam knew, for he had heard Lois crying out in her sleep when she had come to visit him all those years ago and from her eyes Sam knew that it was still the case. But Sam would not wish the likely dreamless sleep of Lana Lang upon Lois for anything; for despite what Lois might think of herself then she <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal"">would</i> be truly dead; nothing more than a shell pretending at life.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">Then there was the object of all their attention; Superman. The politicos in both the government and within the military had pegged the alien as a threat from the moment he burst onto the scene; but for the first time Sam found himself honestly asking &lsquo;why?&rsquo; What was the source of the instant animosity towards a being who, as Lois had pointed out in her tirade, had done nothing but try to help people? It was true that Superman had stepped on some toes when he tore through the D.E.O. facility, but the animosity had existed even before then and, from the reports he had read, no person of good conscience could have stood by and allowed the incarceration and outright torture of innocent people. So where did the hostility come from?</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">Power. For all Sam&rsquo;s attempts to find some higher reason for the hatred, the only one that fit was power. Who had it, who wanted it, and who got to decide where that power was exercised. Superman had power and that made him a threat to anyone else who thought they held all the cards. Those who believed themselves the elites could not trust one being with the power Superman had because in their heart of hearts they knew what they would do with such power if given the chance. It was this distrust and fear that Sam had read in Luthor&rsquo;s eyes when he spoke of Superman. They might be correct in their analysis, but their judgment in the matter was compromised.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">Could one man be trusted with such power? Sam couldn&rsquo;t even begin to guess. For all his exalted rank he&rsquo;d never stopped seeing his career as one of service. To his mind the greatest flaw in the world was that power only seemed to gravitate towards those who lacked the ethics to use that power responsibly; when such a man did come along they were often persecuted mercilessly in their own time, often due to the influence of the power brokers they opposed; their noble accomplishments only appreciated in hindsight.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">Sam didn&rsquo;t know whether Superman was hero or villain, but Lois had certainly been convinced of the former and, though </font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><st1:place w:st=""on""><span style=""font-size: medium"">Clark</span></st1:place><span style=""font-size: medium""> did not trumpet the sentiment as Lois had, he could tell that her friend certainly appreciated the sentiment.

When she&rsquo;d needed a convenient excuse Lois had always been standing by to take the fall; not that her father had bought it for a moment, but sometimes he&rsquo;d indulged her. When she had finally chosen to take the name Lois Lane as her own it had been Sam&rsquo;s last name she was adopting&hellip; that it happened to also be her mother&rsquo;s maiden name was something that simply couldn&rsquo;t be helped.</span><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">It had been Sam who had filled Lois in on a lot of the details involving Elle Lane-Sullivan when her journalistic and investigative interests began to take hold.

Lois could barely remember her grandmother, just that she was very nice and often smelled of cinnamon, but she could at least relate to what it was like to lose a parent. No one knew exactly how or when, but Elle had turned to a radical feminist sect vaguely associated with the Bah&rsquo; I religion; more of a cult than a sect actually; as a way of dealing with her grief. The cult had taken advantage of her grief and, at their urging, Elle had embezzled over a hundred thousand dollars as part of her initiation into one of the cult&rsquo;s communes.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">Lois could almost relate to the craziness that the loss of a parent could bring except for what had happened next. The embezzlement was discovered fairly quickly and the police had a lot of questions for Elle. Elle had decided that her best chance was to run for it and she had planned to steal away her daughter when she did so. A heated argument that Lois could barely remember had erupted in the hallway outside her bedroom that night between Elle and her dad. Sam had later explained to her that her dad would not let Elle take his daughter away from him to join some cult and after first begging his wife to get some help, had threatened to call the police. So Elle had chosen to run off without her daughter and hadn&rsquo;t been seen since.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">The next morning Gabe had tried to make waffles and Lois had taken to hiding in the garage rather than deal with the fact that the woman who was supposed to be her mother had abandoned her and her father for a bunch of strangers and a hundred thousand dollars. Not that she had understood that at the time; all she had known then was that her mother was gone and wouldn&rsquo;t be coming back. In the years since, the FBI and even the IRS had tried to track Elle down, but with no success. Someday Lois would have the courage to mount her own investigation, but she didn&rsquo;t even know what she&rsquo;d do if she ever found Elle again.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">Lois would have understood if Sam had chosen to distance himself from Gabe and her after that; Elle had been his sister after all. But he hadn&rsquo;t. For his part Sam treated the matter almost as if Elle had died and made an effort to be there for both Gabe and his young daughter. Eventually that&rsquo;s how Lois had come to see the matter too. Elle Lane-Sullivan might still be alive somewhere, but her mother had died the night she walked out on her.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">Lois tried to tell herself that the way she had let herself drift away from Sam after her father&rsquo;s death was nothing like what had happened with her mother, but at the moment she couldn&rsquo;t quite bring herself to believe it. She didn&rsquo;t want to think that she had anything in common with Elle, but looking at the disaster that was her life she did see certain similarities. Her interest in the extreme and bizarre was one such trait that she had certainly inherited from the woman; her father was much too grounded for it to have come from his side of the family.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">But Lois was not Elle. She didn&rsquo;t walk out on her family and her life; they had been taken from her. Whatever similarities she shared with Elle they were merely cosmetic. Even if it had been a mistake to let Sam slip out of her life, it was a mistake she could still fix. As she looked across the room at Sam she vowed that once this insanity was over she would make the time to reconnect with her uncle.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">&ldquo;Listen up people,&rdquo; Perry called out a moment later. &ldquo;The President has ordered an evacuation of Metropolis.

Throughout the city there were people busy loading everything they could into their cars or trucks while others smashed in windows and engaged in other petty acts of violence. She had already seen groups of doomsayers and self-styled prophets with their signs, loudly proclaiming the end of days and either the need for repentance or to stand against the demon called Kal-El.

No, when a reactor enters meltdown the reaction reaches a temperature where it will vaporize solid rock at which point the core would sink into the Earth until it reached the local water table. The water table would slow the reaction sufficiently that it would cool and sink no further, but there it would remain for thousands of years, leeching untold amounts of radiation and toxins into the water supply of the surrounding area. Eventually that poison would leak into the river and work its way down into the Gulf, potentially turning the entire area into an uninhabitable radiation-soaked wasteland.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">Two minutes later Lex, Doctor Irons, and his men were racing into the deserted control station only to find everything under control.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">&ldquo;Core temperature is high, but returning to normal range,&rdquo; Doctor Irons confirmed a moment later. &ldquo;The moderators have been fully lowered.&rdquo;</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">In layman&rsquo;s terms that meant all nuclear reactions in the core had been stopped and now the core was just bleeding off heat.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">&ldquo;How long until we can get a team in there to check for damage?&rdquo; Lex asked.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">&ldquo;Tomorrow afternoon at the earliest,&rdquo; Doctor Irons.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">&ldquo;Damn!&rdquo; Lex cursed.

The government was doing everything it could to fight that notion, however. Already Congress had created the sanitary sounding Committee on Metahuman Affairs to oversee the restructuring of the DEO and to come up with legislation, if any, to deal with metahumans. CSPAN had been devoting quite a bit of coverage to the new committee and Lois had spent many an evening watching the progress of their many hearings while trying to get exhausted enough to go to sleep. Particularly amusing had been the debate over whether Superman should be included in the category of metahuman in terms of regulation or whether he was in a category by himself due to his alien nature. It was amazing how many people thought he was a relatively recent arrival and not connected in any way to the meteor shower of almost a quarter century past that was responsible for giving all the metahumans their powers.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">Less amusing had been discussions of enforcement and the &lsquo;super-soldier&rsquo; research of foreign nations. Though it was going nowhere, the call for the outlawing of metahumans continued to echo in the United Nations.

Well, friend might not exactly be the best word anymore. As with so much of Lois&rsquo; life after that fateful summer eight years ago, nothing had been the same.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0.1in 12pt 0in; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">Lana Lang had been the poster child for the meteor shower that had devastated Smallville. Orphaned when her parent&rsquo;s car took a direct hit, her cry of anguish at the loss of her parents had been captured forever on the cover of Time Magazine along with the faerie princess outfit she'd been wearing at the time. Smallville had never really let Lana grow beyond that role as she grew up. She&rsquo;d been kept constantly on a pedestal and able to do no wrong as far as the general populace of Smallville had been concerned. As the head cheerleader and most popular girl in school Lana had also been an obvious target for dozens of stalkers driven mad by kryptonite poisoning. Lois had lost track of how many times she and Clark had needed to come to her rescue.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0.1in 12pt 0in; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">That continual need of rescue had brought the girl into </font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><st1:place w:st=""on""><span style=""font-size: medium"">Clark</span></st1:place><span style=""font-size: medium"">&rsquo;s orbit and Lois and Lex&rsquo;s by proxy. It had also instilled in her a hatred and fear of anyone mutated by the meteor rocks; continual reminders of the event which had killed her parents. Having been the prospective victim of a few meteor freaks herself, Lois could understand how Lana might come to feel that way, but her investigations at the time had shown her that most meteor freaks just wanted to live in anonymity and the minority who did harm others were either criminal to begin with or being driven by desperation or extreme kryptonite-induced insanity.</span><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0.1in 12pt 0in; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">It was Lana&rsquo;s feelings on meteor freaks, coupled with frustration over </font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><st1:place w:st=""on""><span style=""font-size: medium"">Clark</span></st1:place><span style=""font-size: medium""> keeping his secrets from her, which had prompted her to leave Smallville. With Lex&rsquo;s help she spent her senior year at a Parisian art school. She had returned to Smallville briefly after her studies abroad, taking up residence at the Luthor Estate. Gossip in town speculated the two were having an affair, but Lois knew better. Lana was like a younger sibling to Lex and had become his prot&eacute;g&eacute; even before she left for </span><st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on""><span style=""font-size: medium"">Paris</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""font-size: medium"">. At first she had planned on staying in Smallville, but shortly after the incident with another stalker by the name of Marcus Krieger she could not leave fast enough&hellip; not that Lois could blame her. She wondered if she would have had the stomach to stay if it had been her father&rsquo;s <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes"">&nbsp;</span>long dead corpse that had been animated by Krieger&rsquo;s kryptonite-induced power and not Lana&rsquo;s parents.</span><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">All Lois really knew was that Lana had cut herself off from everything associated with Smallville after that.

It seemed that Lana Lang had returned to the States and Smallville just over two years ago where she&rsquo;d received the welcome of a favorite daughter and quickly parleyed that into a seat in local government and then a seat in the U.S. Congress as probably the youngest Congressman ever; she only just met the Constitutionally required age of twenty-five when she had been sworn in and had actually been underage during the election itself. Smallville had always had a weakness for granting Lana Lang her every wish.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">The calculation of her return and parlay of that into an office that would actually require her to spend much of her time far from Smallville reminded her more than a little of Lex&rsquo;s own business savvy and maneuvers, as did the absurdity of a freshman congressman being giving chairmanship of any committee, much less one as high profile as this. He&rsquo;d never brought it up with her, but she suspected that Lex and Lana still kept in touch. It also reminded her again of how much all of them had changed, how much innocence had been lost to them, in the years since they&rsquo;d first met.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">Speaking of meetings&hellip;</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">&ldquo;Well, boring as it might be, one of you is going to have to cover it, just in case they have something interesting to say,&rdquo; Lois said to Clark and Jim.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you do it?&rdquo; Jim asked.</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">&ldquo;Because I, <i>alas</i>, have plans with Lex this afternoon,&rdquo; she said with a contented expression that told the world she was not regretting having to miss the press conference at all. &ldquo;He called me this morning and asked if I could come over around noon.&rdquo;</font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman"">&ldquo;How positively boyfriendly of him,&rdquo; </font></span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: windowtext""><font face=""Times New Roman""><st1:place w:st=""on""><span style=""font-size: medium"">Clark</span></st1:place><span style=""font-size: medium""> remarked.

Once upon a time Intergang, the multi-ethnic cooperative of organized crime families in Metropolis, had been feared by other criminals and those who thought they could enforce the law alike. The deluded might believe that the city government controlled Metropolis, but that was just an illusion. It was Intergang that called the shots and any politician that didn&rsquo;t play ball with them found their career in civil service to be quite short.

A couple of good murders would have restored order nicely, but even the enforcers he had sent to make an example of the reporters had turned themselves over to the police and refused to talk to Intergang&rsquo;s own lawyers about why.

At times like this when he&rsquo;d just saved a dozen or more of her officers&rsquo; lives it was hard to remember that Superman was wanted for questioning in more than two dozen incidents since his appearance on the scene just two short months ago.

"event","<p>Just a little update.&nbsp;Right around&nbsp;1 PM EST today&nbsp;I finally finished the sixth installment of Metropolis series called &quot;Blood.&quot;<br /><br />It's been a long road to get here on &quot;Blood&quot; (or &quot;Changes&quot; as it was originally called). You may not believe it, but I actually started writing this thing back in season four, but then I got side-tracked by life and writers block and regularly posting on various Chlois threads. I've made several fitful attempts&nbsp;to finish it in the&nbsp;years since, but each time the above mentioned items&nbsp;kept interfering. Well, I finally persevered and this time it's really truly&nbsp;done.<br /><br />Due to the sheer size of the finished story (just over 56,000 words) I will be posting the story in sections here on LiveJournal along with the other two of my previous fanfics I've not yet posted here (and which lead directly into book six) over the next few days. Here's my tentative schedule;<br /><br /><strong>Monday, Oct. 13th </strong>=&nbsp;Metallo (features Metallo, Brainiac, and&nbsp;Chlarkex drama).<br /><strong>Tuesday, Oct. 14th</strong> = Convergence (features the final stand against Brainiac).<br /><strong>Wednesday, Oct. 15th</strong> = &quot;Blood&quot; Chapter One: The Day After.<br /><strong>Thursday, Oct. 16th</strong> = &quot;Blood&quot; Chapter Two: Questions.<br /><strong>Friday, Oct. 17th</strong> = &quot;Blood&quot; Chapter Three: Tongues.<br /><strong>Monday, Oct. 20th</strong> = &quot;Blood&quot; Chapter Four: Looking for a Reason.<br /><strong>Tuesday, Oct. 21st</strong> = &quot;Blood&quot; Chapter Five: Cat and Dog.<br /><strong>Wednesday, Oct. 22nd</strong> = &quot;Blood&quot;&nbsp;Chapter Six: Soldiers.<br /><strong>Thursday, Oct. 23rd</strong> = &quot;Blood&quot; Chapter Seven: Heroes and Monsters.<br /><strong>Friday, Oct. 24th</strong> = &quot;Blood&quot; Chapter Eight:&nbsp;Belly of the Beast and Chapter Nine: Resolutions.<br /><br /><strong>Note:</strong> The&nbsp;Metropolis series diverges from the television series &quot;Smallville&quot; at the end of season three. No material past the episode &quot;Covenant&quot; plays any role in the series, even if that material is about events that occurred prior to season three of the series.<br /><br />Speaking of which, my Jimmy Olsen is so completely&nbsp;different from the one&nbsp;found on Smallville to the point that I have a completely different actor cast in the role in my head.&nbsp;When trying to get what my version of Jimmy Olsen looks/sounds like, imagine Michael Welch (Joan of Arcadia's younger&nbsp;brother - also thank mshaffer for the correction) because that's who I mentally cast in the role.</p><p>I look foward to reading your comments on the story itself.</p>"

"event","<font size=""2""><p>As promised from the &quot;Plastique&quot; TWoP page a few days ago I wanted to outline what's going on with Chloe's arc and why I think it shows we're still on target for Chlois. I'm going to be referencing Robert McKee a lot. For those who don't know Robert McKee is the professor who taught AlMiles how to write and since PS3 learned at the feet of AlMiles it should provide a great deal of insight into what is informing their writing choices.<br />&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Long McKee based analysis follows...""><font size=""2""><p>What seems to be going on is that PS3 are following the textbook rules for the principle of antagonism with regards to Chloe's overall arc and have reached the point where she must go through the &quot;negation of the negation&quot; or &quot;doubly negative&quot; as it's called in screenwriting classes or &quot;the end of the line&quot; as I like to call it.</p><p>The short version is that without conflict you have no story and that to get conflict you must put some value (love, justice, truth, etc) up against forces of antagonism/opposition. These forces vary by degree from the contrary (something slightly off) to the contradictory (it's opposite) and then to the end of the line (the absolute worst possible extreme of the opposite). In a story the protagonist needs to go through all of these stages and reach the end of the line before they come around full circle to the original value... only this time with an increased appreciation for that value's true worth.</p><p>In Chloe's case the value in question for her seems to be &quot;reaching for your dreams&quot; and the struggle to get her dreams has always been one of the defining stories of her character. We've seen her go through the contrary (getting an imperfect version of her dreams... the Lionel deal; starting in the basement) to contradictory (being denied her dream by an outside force... blacklisted by Lionel; being fired by Lex), but until this season we never hit &quot;the end of the line&quot; for Chloe in her pursuit of her dreams, until now.</p><p>The end of the line in the pursuit of dreams is not being denied them, but giving them up as something not worth pursuing. You see this in countless movies. In &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; for just example (mainly because it was on just the other day so is fresh in my mind), the professor's sexual advances so crush Elle that she not only abandons the pursuit of her degree, but considers herself stupid and foolish for even attempting it.</p><p>In &quot;Odyssey&quot; we have Chloe saying yes to Jimmy's proposal because she's been held back. She was waiting for her dream; for Clark; but she's given up on that dream and is settling for Jimmy. In &quot;Plastique&quot; we have Chloe saying she devoted so much time to journalism... maybe she should try something else; she's giving up her dream and settling for something else.</p><p>The good news here for Chlois is that Chloe has reached her &quot;ends of the line&quot; early in the season. As McKee explains about the principle of antagonism, if the purpose of the conflict is a tragedy where the character fails to overcome then the story ends with the end of the line. Hamlet ends abruptly when he is poisoned and has minutes to live. Romeo and Juliet ends immediately after Juliet's suicide.</p><p>We still have 20 hours left to go (which is like saying about 15-20 minutes in a typical Hollywood movie) and the only reason for that given that from a writing perspective according to McKee is because the intention is to show Chloe come back from the end of the line to achieve her dreams, only now with a true understanding of the value of achieving them.</p><p>By the same token I wouldn't sweat the various Cnois have feelings for each other, dance, etc. spoilers simply because, by the time you get to those they should be at or near &quot;the end of the line&quot; for Clark's story about the value of finding true love. Clana has for years been the contrary (settling for a lesser love) while Clark's inability to see who his true love really is was contradictory (he misidentified his true love as Lana). Likewise, over time Lana shifted from being a lesser love to one that was all wrong for Clark... she too became contradictory.</p><p>But before the story of Clark's quest to find true love can be over according to McKee he must first reach the end of the line. To do this though he first needs to figure out WHO his true love is (a process that I think started with the news of Chloe's engagement which will be catalyzed by learning of the &quot;Fever&quot; letter) and THEN Clark has to LOSE her... seemingly forever. Only then can he truly appreciate the worth of his true love.</p><p>Thus, Clark will come to love Chloe, but then have to take some of her memories of him to save her and then watch her marry another man and then Doomsdays is probably going to come in and make a bloody mess and Brainiac is going to take complete control over Chloe to make it even worse.</p><p>And if that was the end of the story it would make a fine tragedy; but by this point there will still be twelve episodes left (8-12 minutes in a typical movie... Harry fixed things with Sally in less time than that) so it's NOT the end and again, according to McKee, you only do that if intend to have the hero pull through and win the value he is seeking now that he truly understands what it's worth.</p><p>And really... one of the biggest complaints about Chlark as it relates to Chlois is that it has always been one-sided. Chloe has waited and sacrificed and pined for Clark, but not so Clark for her. All too often he takes her for granted. He NEEDS to almost lose her for him to be worthy of having true love like that.</p><p>I think these aspects of archetypal story structure which is being used with Clark and Chloe (and has been used in regards to all of the main characters of the series) makes the deviation from this model with Nois even more telling. Then again she is a supporting comedic (bordering on farce due to the reliance upon coincidence to propel her story) foil stuck in a dramatic story. That NEVER ends well in fiction.</p><p>That Nois is a supporting character is hard to deny. One of the true marks of a supporting character is a lack of story arc or consistent development because the primary purpose of a supporting character is to support the stories of the main characters. That's why it was not important for us to see how Nois whiled her way into the Blackcreek facility, what mattered is how she interacted with Clark once she did get there.</p><p>&quot;Plastique&quot; again shows us Nois in a total support role. She stays behind rather than rushing to the story because if she had gone she'd have been in a position to see Clark's heroics. Later she does go to the scene and flubs her attempted bribe of a police office, but this gives Clark a chance to learn there was no bomb. Still later she provides the reason for Clark to be waiting in the hospital hall so he can run into Davis and learn that Chloe's engaged. After that she serves as a warm body for Clark to exposition about Bette and the boy she murdered and realize that Chloe was in danger.</p><p>We get this too in past seasons. Nois is placed into positions seemingly at random and her part of the story is never truly wrapped up. We get no explanation for what she thinks happened to Grant after he dumped her. We don't see her initially struggling at the DP. Instead things happen to Nois and the camera jumps to main characters like Clark or Chloe (or even Jimmy in &quot;Arctic&quot;) to see their reaction to it.</p><p>Nois is hired at the DP and we cut to Chloe's reaction to the news. Nois get a byline at the DP and we cut to Clark's reaction to the news (and he is less than impressed... not surprising seeing as he did almost all the investigative work and she's getting the credit). Jimmy gives her false info on Lex and we don't follow her attempts to investigate them, we follow Jimmy as he feels bad for doing it.</p><p>The reason why Nois is not developed and fleshed out or given consistent traits is because her role in the overall story isn't that important. One of the rules of effective writing is to never tell your audience more than they need to know. If it's not important to the story that the character once flunked geography you don't waste time in the story telling the audience that they flunked geography. You only bring that up if your point is to prove a character to be an idiot.</p><p>I have in the past complained that the writers do not do a good job on characterization, but now I think that much of that complaint came from not understanding that for many of the characters in this story, you don't need fully fleshed out characters. Based on the story being presented, Nois is one of these characters. A supporting one.</p><p>Similarly, Nois' role as a comedic character is plainly obvious to me. As McKee puts it;</p><p><em>All characters pursue desrire against forces of antagonism. But the dramatic character is flexible enough to step back from the risk and realize: &quot;This could get me killed.&quot; Not the comic character. The comic character is marked by a blind obsession.</em></p><p>We have seen this in past seasons with Nois' obsession with fame. She wants the front page no matter the cost, even if she has to lie (as she did at the Inquisitor), cheat (as she did to get her plushy assignments from Grant), or steal (as she did from Chloe's trash and in &quot;Plastique&quot; with her taping Clark without his permission) to get it. We similarly see this obsession override her common sense in her attacks on armed individuals that get her hurt and yet that she refuses to learn from.</p><p>Another aspect in relation to comedy is the reliance on coincidence in pushing Nois' story that simply does not come into play in other people's stories. According to McKee, coincidence needs to brought into the story early so that there is time to build meaning out of it. Without meaning there is no story. Following a man through his day and then ending the story with a car accident that kills him gives the audience no meaning. How the car accident affects his family and friends is something that the audience can latch onto.</p><p>But continued reliance on coincidence to move a character's story forward is, according to McKee, &quot;deus ex machina, the writer's greatest sin.&quot; He feels this so strongly he feels fit to set it apart and bold it in his book on screenwriting.</p><p>To further quote McKee;</p><p><em>Deus ex machina not only erases all meaning and emotion, it's an insult to the audience. Each of knows we must choose and act, for better or worse, to determine the meaning of our lives. No one and nothing coincidental will come along to take that responsibility from us, regardless of the injustices and chaos around us. You could be locked in a cell for the rest of your life for a crime you did not commit. But every morning you would still have to get up and make meaning. Do I bludgeon my brains against the wall or do I find some way to get through the day with value? Our lives are ultimately in our own hands. Deus ex machina in an insult because it is a lie.</em></p><p>Time and again Nois' story is moved forward by pure coincidence. The barn door just happens to land next to her. Grulian just happened to think she was hot and interested in UFO's. She gets her story in &quot;Plastique&quot; entirely via the good graces of Clark Kent (no wonder he was unimpressed).</p><p>Indeed, it is the relative LACK of struggle that marks Nois' &quot;story.&quot; Opportunities fall into her lap without effort. It reminds me more than a little like playing a video game in &quot;god-mode&quot;; it might let you blow off some steam, but there's no sense of accomplishment in beating something without any real effort.</p><p>The one place that coincidence used in the manner it used with Nois DOES work is in farce; a story that begins, moves forward and ends by coincidence creates its own context and meaning according to McKee; that the character is absurd and to be mocked.</p><p>As I mentioned above though; Nois is a comedic character in an otherwise dramatic series and that has its own unique implications. It would be one thing if Clark, Lex, Chloe, and Lana all bumbled though similar misadventures and chance occurances, but they don't. They reside in the realm of drama where causality and consequence and character move the story forward.</p><p>As McKee pointed out above, dramatic characters can pull back from the edge while the comedic one will rush in where angels fear to tread. Thus, in drama, the comedic character is the one to serve as the object lesson; the one singled out by the villain to prove they &quot;mean business&quot; or the natural disaster to show the main characters that &quot;this isn't a game.&quot; The demise of the comedic character in a drama serves to create instant pathos; once the comedic character realizes that what's going on isn't a joke... the comedy is over.</p><p>A few other points worth considering that I've brought up elsewhere but feel the need to reiterate here. As I pointed out above, Nois is clearly a supporting character. So here's a rhetorical exercise for you. Name as many dramatic series or movies as you can think of where you have a single male lead who up choosing a supporting character instead of the female lead (provided there is a female lead and he makes a choice at all).</p><p>I bring this up because several friends and I struggled for hours to think of some example of where this has happened in television or movies and we drew a blank. Yet this is what the expected ending to Smallville supposedly is? The male lead chooses the supporting actress over the female lead?</p><p>The reason why such an ending feels false is because it is. Romantic relationships are among the strongest and most profound in human existance and so when they are central to the story must be given that level of weight. Smallville has always had Clark's search for true love as one of it's core elements. Anyone less than a character given equal development within the story will feel false because in real life we know our romantic partners more deeply than we know almost anyone.</p><p>Coupled with the above this makes AM being signed to 22 episodes while ED is still limited to 13 a definite sign of authorial intent. If Nois is really intended to be Clark's true love then she should be the most central character in Clark's life because that is what is true to human experience. But she's not. Chloe is.</p><p>Similarly, another sign of authorial intent is that they took the time to sign AM for s9 on the off chance that they might get it. From ED's own interview she has not been approached about the prospect of season nine at all (indeed, if she were signed to a standard five year contract she's on her last year right now and is burning through her episodes at a prodigious rate).</p><p>If they do get a ninth season the show-runners would once again need to stall their planned ending. If ED/Nois were in any way important to that ending shouldn't they have secured ED's contract before they secured AM for s9? What this says it that, from the showrunners' perspective AM/Chloe is crucial to the ending of the series as they wish it to end, but ED/Nois is not.</p><p>Finally, because I know there are specific concerns about Chloe marrying Jimmy I think it's worth noting that much of the Superman lore that the writers have pulled from is the Silver Age. It is the Silver Age that gave of Lex and Clark as friends and Lex's interest in Lana Lang. It is the Silver Age that gave us Pete knowing Clark's secret while Lana long remained clueless.</p><p>And in the Silver Age Lois Lane not only married Jimmy Olsen, but also Batman and even a convict on death row... all in continuity and all of which were later annulled (usually due to Lois not having been herself at the time of the wedding). So the argument that Chloe could never be Lois Lane if she marries Jimmy Olsen is completely false since Silver Age Lois Lane was indeed married to Jimmy Olsen until that marriage was annulled.</p></font></lj-cut></font><br />"

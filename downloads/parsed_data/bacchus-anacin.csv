"event","dear no one and nothing:

in the past i have stayed up with you, throught liquor and love, telling you what i hear, what i think, and what i do.

tonight i come to end this.  someone finally told me to shut up for good, they said
if you want to make a comment, you can go ahead and tell me who you are or keep it to yourself.

and then i was told, why do you find it necissary to critisize everything we (being the people who do not belive the same things as you) believe in? 

well. they're right.  you have only become my weapon and my bother.  i don't want that anymore, i don't want to bother you, i don't want to take your time, and i'm not scared.

i'll sing to myself to the eternal slumber i wanted so much.
this i learned:

realize that sometimes you're not okay
you level off but its not all right now
you need to understand
there's nothing strange about this
you need to know your friends
I'll be waving my hand watching you drown
watching you scream
quiet or loud
maybe you should sleep
maybe you just need a friend
as clumsy as you've been
there's no one laughing
you will be safe in here

Throw away this very old shoelace
that tripped you again
try and shrug it off
it's only skin now 
you need to understand
there's nothing fake about this
you need to let me in
I'm watching you drown


to no one and nothing:  i'm sorry i bothered you, i'm sorry i was never your sister. your friend, your brother, or a catcher. i writer, a ride, a picture, a hottie,.....i guess i'm just not. but at least i'll spell my name right for once.

-----------
the valet
garcin
inez
estelle

Garcin, Inez, and Estelle are brought to the same room  by a mysterious Valet.  a plain room furnished in Second Empire style. 

open scene a small grey room.  six windows. one large in front, one in the back, two on each side.

five chairs. on the windows scenes of character's live pass by.

enter valet:

""safety in numbers, i fold under the naive fascination, sketches of dreams, safe and sound, in between shadows, i'll remain unseen. suspended by transparent lies. i can't feel a thing every vapid interactin every shallow embrace is a slow disconnection.  i'm pulled under static whispers burning in my ears, tears me apart at the seams, i know they're just waiting to hang me out to dry in the desert su.  my slow disconnection a predictable disgrace where they fail to live up to my greatest expectations, a love eclipsed by isolation.  the pull of inertia has me up against hte wall i'm restless, twiting nad turning on a bed of broken glass, our breath, nothing to confess. nothing""

cue lights, on separate chairs garcin faces estelle inez sits across an empty chair. the valet has dissapeared.

they look at each other with simple admiration and fear of a knock at the door. the valet enters and mockingly sets a paper knife in the center of the table, he moves his chair next to garcins, but at a relative distance. 

inez and estelle converse with each other.  they are arguing.  garcin turns to each and advices them that the room is far too crowded and perhaps they should lower their voices.  he asks if he can remove his coat,  to which estelle replies with certain discontent that she does not appreciate the gesture.  inez insists on applying make up, but the room has not mirrors.  

the valet stands and sits by the wall looking out his window.  
slowly, he moves further from the group.  until he is virtually in the hidden corner on the north side of hte room.  garcin looks at the ceiling and whispers some condemnations to a non visible enemy.  estelle again turns to garcin and suggests that he lower his voice.   garcin apologizes and begins playing with the paper knife.   the conversation followed.

i-i can't see my face, there is nothing here to reflect what i need to see. is my lipstick on.

e- i can be your mirror. look at me and i can tell you how you look, no, you have a little too much on the top lip.

g- don't you see, stop talking. this is what will lead us to our damanation.  the only way to save ourselves is to clearly stay out of our paths.  we can individually be happy.

i- [ignores g]  what is the valet doing.  shouldn't he be entertaining us?  he brought us here?  and where is the rest of the company.

e- that's right.  i heard from the valet that the entertainment would be a gratuity and would happen in due time.  i believe my time is due and would now like my entertainment. i am often alone and have no one to talk to.  where is the entertainment.

i- i agree with you, where do you suppose the entertainers went?  did you ever visit Solita?  it's a city on the southern parts of south america? that was a facinating place.  it was filled with amazing things to see and people to meet. except   i didn't go out often.  i was located in a house where other high society met, but we rarely spoke.  my society of social vanguard traveled their often, but, we didn't meet unless the meeting was mandatory. honestly, estelle, i can tell you how much i enjoyed traveling, except i often found myself lost.  we had valets and tour guides, but i'm an adventurer you know?  i enjoy the life and dares!.

g- then why are you here?

[in the background the valet laughs at the question and turns to find garcin playing with the paper knife]

v- put that down.  you will drop it and and dent it.

[estelle and inez have seemingly ignored the situation]

e- i know exactly what you mean, when i traveled as well, i carried my life with me.  i was sure to be ready at any moment that life might bring me; you could say i'm somewhat of a thrill-seeker.  still, fun is second and safety first, that's what i always say. oh dear, your mascara rubbed a little. let me adjus.....

i- no, don't that is the new haute couture. honestly, how do you call yourself a thrill seeker if you can't even manage my make-up?  speaking of which do you think the valet knows of the entertainmetn schedule?

e- i would think he would but you know how it is.  usually there is a loyalty thing amongst the workers and they often plan on making our stay unpleasant.  i've overheard them talking and i'm certain they were criticizing us.  

g- have you maybe stopped to wondered that you missed the entertainment.  this is what was made available to us meaning this is what we are supposed to use.   i know the valet promised us what we have paid for, but i am inclined to believe that somehow this was not a trick.

i- what do you suggest?  i am a woman of society, i deserve respect and the best, and if you intend to tell me that i will find entertainment in pulling strings in the air, then you are wrong.

e- besides what we demand is only what we have invested.  if you didn't look at the itenerary then i suggest you do.  

i- why do you consider yourself part of a we now, estelle, i don't remember you from Solita?

e-  are you insulting me?  my travels have been far more further away than yours. and simply because i lived in Novio, that doesnot mean i don't travel...

v- shut up, shut up, shut up you wanted entertainment?  then why didn't you pay attention.  it was here all along. it was you that decided to look for mirrors, look for conversation, or not even speak at all. that was suppposed to be it.   i left your respectable group so that a simple valet would not interfere with you entertainment.

g- what do you mean?

e- i don't agree, i still don't feel entertained, and if this is your performance for my amuse, then i'll naturally say i find you dull and in err.  the brochures described...

v- i wrote the brochures.

i- then we'll write our complaint to you?

v- yes if you have one, i will gladly take it.

i- very well, take note, the seats are uncomfortable, i prefer reading lights, and this garcin to my right is not adequate company...

g- adeaquate?  i never intended to be your company, i merely offered myself to be part of your converstation, something i was denied to begin with.  how od expect a pleasant time if you don't look outside this human mirror of yours,

e- human mirror?  is that some sort of insult towards me?  because i very much tried to be in your company.  simply because i didn't direct conversation at you or shook your hand does not mean ignored you.  honestly you'd expect modernity....

v- modernity, by your haute couture, as inez pointed out i can tell you, modernity is something you are bound to miss around here.  i apologize having to interrupt the discussion.

i- as you should be. inez, this reminds me....

"event","it's interesting how the caption where you update your journal says event, as if really your life was comprised of a single event.  well. let's begin. i woke up kind of late, because last night, i had insomania...really it's just my bad sleeping  habits, i can't go to bed before one or two. unhealthy, understood, but also, realize i get up at 930.  thus i like to think i'm okay. my face was twitching the other day, but yesterday i took  like three naps and i woke up late.  thus it went away.  i've also been moody, but some have told me i'm naturally moody.  i don't know if it's just that they are getting to know me a little better, but often they mention things that surprise me.  well yesterday, my significant other, or should i say life partner, in english class, gave a presentation on sartre. i heard it wasn't as good as mine, so that means i win the sartre contest. russell and i had both set up the sartre contest which would determine who would be the best existentialist writer.  i looked over ""nausea"" ""no exit"" and ""the flies""--making me me ultra-existentialist...but that would contradict the essence of being an existentialist, damn cyclic philosophy. 
nonetheless, that constest validated my supremacy, and made me feel better about myself. i decided to ditch english, watched a video entitled ""the farmer's wife"" which makes me sad because their relationship is screwed up enough for both of them to be happy, and at the same time, happy enough to be screwed, it struck me that he was about to lose his farm because they were short 100 dollars, when i figured, that's about how much i make in a week!  i felt bad. then i went out and bought myself something, i don't remember what, oh, dinner plates.  i got some furio bland colored plates. they are flat and look like broken egg shells.  ayn criticized my lack of colors and use of only bland tones.  i laughed and was amused by her idea that only because i like art, i like colors.  i don't. i came to that conclusion after my art history course from renaissaince to post modern. i noticed that subconsicously i enjoy the bland colors and the straight geometric patterns because they create a sense of stability, timelessness, and continuity.  if i can make my life of greys, browns, off-whites and lines, stripes and squares or circled patterns, i present an image, like art, that wont be forgotten.  very vanguard.  that's what i'm afrai of, being forgotten.  i don't suppose i really care if i'm needed as long as i'm remembered. i have some ice cream in the fridge, pardon me............................................fridge door...................spoon..................cd change....................scratching eye..................continue.....mmmmm. dreyer's dreamery deep dish apple pie ice cream, this reminds me of the day tom amy pam came over and we watched a movie.  for some reason, we were happy and we didn't argue.  okay. so i came back to my room after art history and had lunch with aida. she gave me five dollars on monday night to fix dinner, which somehow i'm jipped some money, but we both enjoy lunch/dinner.  yesterday [on my new dishes] we had angel hair pasta with fresh roasted mushrooms and a side of salad with red wine vinagrette dressing.  browned breadsticks with melted cheese on top.  she made brownies and coca cola.  then for lunch the following day we had roasted chicken thigh with fresh rigotini pasta and a flour tortilla.  today for dinner we had caesar salad with potato soup and bread and butter.  she had noodles.  i like this whole dinner/lunch thing. it's something to look forward to.  especially cool when your meal adds up to like four dollars, drink included.  i went to photo class and the proffessors likes my work. i pulled a nice 86 and 83 when the highest class grade was 90.  i felt accomplised when considering my experience with an slr camera.  i'm still learning- michelangelo....well i was also confused today, for some reason i thougth today i was my math test but it wasn't. so i studied somewhat yesterday night.  today i studied more with robb and a girl whose name i can't remember.  i wish people were obsessed with their name enough to write it on a shirt, thus i'd never forget what they are named...you know?  speaking of knowing. ayn  mentioned i speak ackwardly; she mentioned i put subtle pauses between my words--especially noted in my ""i don't---know"" where --- = pause.  i don't     know.  she's wrong.  my ice cream is melting.  so back to math.  i was studied more today and i hope i do well on this upcoming test. otherwise gibran will have to somehow-perhaps illegally- persuade crazy math teacher to improve my grade.   i must say if worse comes to worst, my ms.robinson dilusion does not work with her.  i just couldn't with her. now my residence hall director...well i can't speak of that otherwise i might end up sued or at least dead.  i remember i work tomorrow. i will update more then.   i'm listening to this bossa nova cd and i love it. it's samba meets moby...well, there is this song, track ten to be exact on the bossanovacoa wher the background is the ocean.  as this lady sings.  to be brief, the ocean reminds me a lot of california and my dad.  i tell everyone whence i reminisce that my dad and i had good times driving by palo verde, that must be my favorite place.  well, during the summer in third grade he'd pick me up in his truck and take me where he had to make deliveries.  we went to this ritzy place where the shops were nice. the houses were neat and the wallets were full.  it was riche-noveu all the way.  that was the day my gatsby complex rooted.  i saw my house, my friends, my life.  it was a medium house, tan in color where the entrance is a tall belltower with a large rustic clock in the middle, someday i'll draw it out.  the outside was manicured and it faced the beach.  the sky was blue and scattered clouds or balls of pure cotton balls floated by.  the street was divided by a small patch of grass and palm trees. the cars were not expensive but finely taken care of and i swear i saw a party of friends seated in a lawn somewhere drinking.  they were nice clothing and the women had large sunglasses and the men had linen shirts.  i don't suppose all this detail was taken in that day but i added the fine touches in years later.  the breeze was cool, but the sun was warmer.  there was no care because really everything was okay.  if i have complexes this must be one of them.  but event the complex has real solutions, right?  i don't like nice things, i just like things that are nice to me.  i think it funny that i've settled well into this cray metaphor.  you know Gatsby, Gibran.  Tom, Tommy.  Daisy, pam's favourite flower, gerber Daisy.  Jordan Baker, just always fits amy.  they have same characters.  attractive but still detached.  and i tried fitting johanna into a character, but who better than the narrator him/herself who would oversee all this and write about it.  josh yelled at me once when i mention gatsby as my literary hero.  i guess he expects me to be some sort of philosophical-phile. but detailing life according to terms seems abrubtly non-sensical, like my writing.  which i pride myself upon. well since that house was close to the beach i remember i asked my dad if we could have lunch by the shore.  he agreed.  he carried a grey plastic lunchbox that always smelled plasticky.  he handed me a sandwich wrapped in a white patterned napkin.  the sandwich was a weird one, a concoction of my mother's whose i will never forget. take one part ground beef one part ground pork.  in a large bowl mix with your hand, add one egg, some salt some pepper and let set.  on an aluminum sheet  pour some progresson seasoned bread crumbs.  take a small ball of the meat mixture into your hand and flattened over the bread crumbs. set aside. on a large skillet pour one third inch of oil, let heat.  once hot, carefully place the bistek over the oil and fry until light brown. turn over carefully with fork.  dry excess oil off.  on one slice of toasted bread, place two tablespoons of russian vegetable salad and one bistek.  russian vegetable salad should be prepared beforehand.  in pot, bring water to rolling boil, add little salt and half a teaspoon of oil, add diced potatoes.  let water return to boiling point. then add frozen corn, carrots and peas.  bring to boil and simmer until soft ""al dente"".   drain and wash with cold water. in a mixing bowl transfer vegeatbles and add mayonaise. all vegetables should be covered with mayo.  we had an iced tea, lipton i think.  and we talked about school. maybe, really, i didn' realize it then, i just took it in. and over the years i made my own illusions part of my reality.  or also, i may just be a boy.  doomed to always be, just a boy.  the sea looked refreshing and the sand looked like salt."

"event","my working hours at the front desk at the front desk have changed and possibly my homework routine.  i will TRY to work here, but that's near impossible....

i'm eating grandma's animal circus and a sierra mist.  i went ot get my vest that i wrote about in my other entry.

the mall is less fun, sort of like a vacuum of money that's what it is.  my room is good.  i realized that when i don't sleep well, i get really moody. today i yelled at nathan and matt [one of tristan's friends].  i felt bad sure, but also they were being insanely annoying.  i was cleaning my fish tank with a vacuum and they were like ""it's making the water dirtier, hey try sucking up the fish up, make it eat its own poop""  then i said shut the hell up and get out.  why? why? why would you say something so stupid?  why?...then ayn noticed and she said, i'm sorry. maybe you should take a nap.  ayn has the power to like point out my mistakes and then, it's kind of funny. nathan and matt just annoyed the hell out of me.

well...i'm going to write to my parents a detailed letter of what i did in the past 48 hours.   i also want to work on my collage book.  which special note to those who get bored on friday nights! consider the following:

           book of boredom

materials:

art notebook with heavy paper, 100lbs+
exacto knife
scissors
glue stick
bottle of elmer's all-purpose glue
paper samples [i.e. magazines, wrappers, newspapers, textbook  pages, notes, hand-made papers, etc.]
ruler
french curve, sketch design patterns

instructions:

begin by purchasing all the materials listed above, and clear your workstation, your mind should focus and only be distracted by your interests.
open your notebook, skip the first two pages.  i personally suggest CARnet's ARTspiral notebook, 148lb paper.

look through your paper samples, look for designs, lines, colors, patterns, anyting that is interesting to your eye.  cut out a variety of things you find interesting.

spread out your selections and look at your blank page, imagine your sheet divided into sections using the rule of thirds. example:

----------------------------------
|          |          |          |
|          |          |          |
|          |          |          |
|----------|----------|----------|
|          |          |          |
|          |          |          |
|          |          |          |
|----------|----------|----------|
|          |          |          |
|          |          |          |
|          |          |          |
----------------------------------

my notebook has horizantal-rectangular pages. take note as to how i have divided my page into nine sections.  commony under the rule of thirds, your image or your piece should be placed in any of the cross-sections of the lines.  in theory our eye moves from left to right, up to down, and is guided by this structure.  

NOTE: rule of thirds is not applicable in every situation, if you feel your image fits better and is more aesthetically pleasing, throw the rule out.  

create a scene with your pictures using the different types of paper you have; experiment with tearing designs or lines from your rulers and curves.

enjoy. and display."

it's been a good day. but things are going to take a turn for the worst, i have math in an hour and thirty.  i hate math. 

my com professor is taking my late homework for normal credit. so i'm not losing points. i ditched on monday, that's when it was due.  unlike math.

my presentation on sartre was awesome. the class liked my visual...guess what it was....guess....NOTHING.  lol. yes that's tright. i tried explaining sartre's nausea, his novel on the meaningless and emptyness of life and i gave them plates before my speech. i told them they would get food in the middle of my presentation, then i had like seven seconds of silence and i said why aren't you eating your food?

they were confused then caught up...NOTHING!

i got an excellent on my presentation, unlike math.

my photo professor says i do really good work for never have worked with an slr camera.  he likes the mood and the settings i find.  ironically he liked the ones i took at the cemetery.  lol.  that's where i'll end up soon, with math!

then i ate krispy kremes last night and a quart of chocolate milk.  then i had to do math! 

let's see, oh yeah and i also got accepted into northern lights! we're like the student welcome committee.  they woke me up at six to take me to breakfast!  then i told them i was tired because i went to bed late, because, i was doing math.

i got jipped ten dollars by the pizza guy, because he can't do math!

i have a down vest on hold at the gap that i could go get now, but i have to go to math.

and the only way i make myself go to math is if i play the song: it's getting better.

I USED TO GET  MAD AT MY SCHOOL! TEACHERS WHO TAUGHT ME WEREN'T COOL

and when i come out of math i play: a day in the life

I READ THE NEWS TODAY OH BOY. ABOUT A LUCKY MAN WHO MADE THE GRADE, AN THOUGH  THE NEWS WERE RATHER SAD, I HAD TO LAUGH.  HE BLEW HIS MIND OUT IN A CAR, HE DIDN'T NOTICE THAT THE LIGHT HAD CHANGED. A CROWD OF PEOPLE STOOD AND STARED.  THEY'D SEEN HIS FACE BEFORE.

since i'm away from home, i've  been trying to figure out a way to tell my parents how i want my funeral to be.  i don't want to freak them out, but i really want my funeral to be as i plan.

i want, by the time i'm thirty to have saved enough money to buy a small lot.  turn it into a simple garden with three paths leading to the center. and in the center i want a giant vase to be a water fountain but i'd like the vase to be made out of clay that's been mixed with my ashes.  however, i don't want my hands cremated. i want them to be buried. and when they are being buried, i'd like them buried under a dry tree in the park. and when everyone comes to the funeral of my hands, i want them to play ""a day in the life"".

i also want this to be an art park.  sort of like a free studio and gallery.
but that's asking too much.  i have this feeling that i'll die before i'm 35.  i can sort of feel it.

gross subject. i'm sorry.  arhrhrhghghhg i HAVE TO DO TO MATH NOW!"

russianauthrsrul: hahahahahaha........
russianauthrsrul: i love you!!!!!!!!1 you're incredible!
thegibran: i love you??????1 you're my only credible. lol.
thegibran: you do believe me, right?
thegibran: the incoherentillalobos
russianauthrsrul: ahh... well tonight, i want to marry you, but i guess that's why we have the relationship we do, huh? eh.. cat and mouse has always been good enough for me
thegibran: why don't we get married? we can be together but allow for our bad and martin tendencies
thegibran: or should i say our virginia woolf and jean-paul sartre tendencies? lol
thegibran: wait no, i need an idealist?
thegibran: yes....kant!
thegibran: lol
russianauthrsrul: lol...!
russianauthrsrul: you'll likely find a balance of both in another
thegibran: yes, i suppose, but i hope to never balance with you, otherwise we'd complement each other, and i rather be insanely againts you.
thegibran: ""There I found my religion: nothing seemed to me more important than a book. I regarded the library as a temple."" -sartre
thegibran: LOSER!
russianauthrsrul: ahh.. maybe i have misjudged sartre...
thegibran: MAYBE?
thegibran: MAYBE!!!!
thegibran: Later in 1943, Sartre took advantage of the National Committee of Writers and contributed to the writing of underground papers in an attempt to influence political movements.  
russianauthrsrul: ahh... what can i say? i love to arouse passion in you!
thegibran: you do arouse me!
thegibran: in a passionate way!
russianauthrsrul: like sartre?
thegibran: YES, YES, YES, YES, YES Y...E....S.........
thegibran: Despite his strength as an activist, when he was presented the Nobel Prize in October of 1964 he refused the award on the premise that Nobel himself claimed himself successful upon the death of thousands lives because of his production of dynamite.  Nonetheless he continued his lectures across the world and his intent to promote the communist party against the ideals of 
capitalism.  
russianauthrsrul: i don't think i'm old enough to be partaking in this conversation
thegibran: i think you are.
thegibran: it's only literary interpretation~! lol
russianauthrsrul: hahahaha!!
thegibran: ah, play on words!
thegibran: you can roll in them, jump on them, slide on them, and even turn them around!!!!
thegibran: Bibliographers have calculated that Sartre averaged about twenty pages a day throughout his career as a writer.  
russianauthrsrul: i know in the back of my head that you and sartre are right about everything..
russianauthrsrul: but something keeps me behind the fence
russianauthrsrul: so close to freedom but not quite ready for it
thegibran: orwell?
thegibran: lol
thegibran: AHH, KILL ME, I'M LITERARY INCLINED TO COMMIT SUICIDE ON MY SATIRICAL JOKES!!!
thegibran: LITERALLY.
russianauthrsrul: oh, but i love them!
thegibran: as i do you.
thegibran: not do you, but also you. lol
thegibran: LOL
russianauthrsrul: or both at once?!
thegibran: HAH AH AHA HHHAAAA
thegibran: quiet you! my roomate sleeps and i laugh at such nonsense.
thegibran: """"""ground control to major vig, ground control to major vig, take your protein pills and put your helmet on, commencing countdown engines on. check ignition and may gibran's love be with you""""""--bowie
russianauthrsrul: hahahah!!! oh, you make me roll on the floor with delight!
russianauthrsrul: care to join me?
thegibran: HA HA HA, """"""my 'spaceship' doesn't know where to go. tell my wife i said hello"""""""" """" can you hear me major vig?""""""
russianauthrsrul: this is too much. i am going to die from laughter
thegibran: may i die with you tonight?
russianauthrsrul: my brother threw a pillow at me, and i can't stop laughing.. oh, die, die please.. that way we can remain together is a permanent state of 
joyous, happy
copulation
thegibran: ah, and they said deat would not be pleasureable!
thegibran: *death
russianauthrsrul: oh, you slay me, dear boy
thegibran: are we into slaying? 
thegibran: what will be our code-word for 'stop'
thegibran: ?
russianauthrsrul: hahahah!
thegibran: i don't like hahahah, how about...oh woe is me?
russianauthrsrul: oh no! that will only further provoke me!
thegibran: god...!!! make it stop....lol, lol lol ha ha ha ha ha.......
thegibran: why do you treat me so? what have i done, or not done for you to treat me this way.
thegibran: should i continue?
russianauthrsrul: hmm.. i should probably try and get some sleep before i go to school in you know... four hours!! ahh!! why didn't you tell me it was 3:30?!
thegibran: because i can keep going all night!
russianauthrsrul: ahah!! you must stop! 
thegibran: russia-nau-thrsrul--it's a sign.
thegibran: am i too much for you?  say the code-word!
thegibran: or should i make you beg...?

russianauthrsrul: i'm there. i'm at nau.. you make me laugh too much to be anywhere else
thegibran: i only trick you into laughing, really, it's you who tells me what to say.
thegibran: lol LOL that's why i'm a public relations major.
russianauthrsrul: hahahahahaha! lol
russianauthrsrul: oh, gibran, it's been fun. but i gotta go
russianauthrsrul: so if you just pay me and i'll be outta here
thegibran: ha ha ha ha, oh my, i may have woken my roomate becaue of laughter.
thegibran: very well, take these few sheckles and return to me, you know how to benefit from me well, but don't tell anyone, i have a reputation to keep.
thegibran: And in other occasions, two of Sartre's friends in Naples took him to a burlesque hall to view a nude woman in a room with mirrors.  He later reflected on all of these reactions and wrote about them in The Respectable Prostitute.
russianauthrsrul: lol.. i fall in love more every day
russianauthrsrul: farewell then
thegibran: if only it was me...
thegibran: and the way i treat you.
thegibran: goodnight.
thegibran: rest.
thegibran: for tomorrow will set again, and i will need to be satisfied. i've all ready the ""canon"" list of harvard's literature department.
thegibran: it's bound to 'blow' you away!
thegibran: goodnight.
thegibran: let me go. goodnight."

"event","tonight i wondered who i was. so i took quizilla tests. 

i am HADES--like the greek god hades in real life i tend to judge people a lot, weighing up wheter they deserve what they have, the underworld is simply where rewards are for the best and punishment for the worst and so i definitely believe in people getting what is coming to them. i confuse the world a great deal.

my dramatic death: suicide

what swear word am i? asshole:  i am a jerk, and like pushing others around, but it will possiblym get me far in life ""yes, i'm an asshole, and your point""

mythological figure: the Gargoyle;the fallen You ""And The Gargoyle mended his wings from the blood of the fallen so he could rise up from imprisonment. With great speed and resourcefulness, Gargoyle made the world his for the taking."" Some examples of the Gargoyle Form are Daedalus (Greek) and Mary Magdalene (Christian). The Gargoyle is associated with the concept of success, the number 4, and the element of wood. His sign is the new moon. As a member of Form 4, you are a creative and resourceful individual. You are always thinking of possible solutions to problems you face and you generally choose one that is right. Much of your success comes from your ability to look at things a little differently than everyone else. Gargoyles are the best friends to have because they don't always take things for face value.

Nintendo character:  Wario. i think i'm bad, but i'm really not, i might get a big head sometimes and think i'm the boss


Where will i go when i die? Ghost or spirit: You are a lost soul. Very calm and sweet, you are often the one who asks: What if? With a clever mind, you want to explore the world on a different level. Without the answers, you aren't ready to move on. You are most likely very creative and find yourself thinking things through on a different level.

"event","today, my appels and oranjes rotted.

i was late, didn't turn them into anything good, so they've rotted away. 

tears grew in my eyes and it was easy to store away these things, but has this ever happenned to you:

you hope, and then it doesn't happen, and then you laugh because you realize you were right about being wrong all along?

i'm reading sartrean philosophy. that's as healthy as drinking, and perhaps one could say since i've been mostly hammered for the largest part of my life, i should be used to it. i am.  i've learned that things don't last-- it's better to get used to nothing.  you'll never be better than right now-- there is no exit.  and help is not around the corner, nor is it on a map, it's in your own twisted ways.

[insert laughter here], i used to think a lot. i used to hope a lot. i used to laugh a lot.

but then my thoughts got old, and no one really cared.  then my hope broke and i'm left with pieces to mend and bend.  then everyone knew my laugh was used and annoying.

i've finished.  i've set things into place and i'm ready to stop playing. everything is stored away. as it always should have been.  but i'd like to think that my hands aren't dirty. i didn't do anything.  and perhaps that's my problem. there is no next time, so i can't ""try again"". but maybe that was the problem. i didn't do anything.  i never do.  

i sent away everything i could.  but sending things to them would not hold them together. i sent them words, but words only separate them.  i sent them brotherhood and sisterhood, but now we're darkly-hooded.  i brought them to me, but distance is broad and wide.  they made me real. now, i'm just a matter of memory.

i wonder what farmers do. do they take seeds and re-plant?  because those seeds seem tarnished to me?  and if he does, does he plant different things? new fruits?  i used to think what i grew was good.  you know, rockwell-like. pretty. picturesque. ideal.  fucking artists--they always get it wrong.  and then i saw 
outside the canvas an saw the dark spots, the bites, the bruises and the sour taste.

do you know the way that i can't lose? do you know the ways that i can't? do you you know the things that i can't lose? where has your heart gone to? tear me apart from you. i wont see you there. i'll be on my own, you kissed me cold. 

i don't know who to direct journal writing to. you know? it's empty. nobody will try, so why should we begin at all?

i thought i was better. i thought i was satisfied.  i thought i was:

natali-9-left her in l.a. dissapeared through time.
rick-5-  fianceed to the girl i liked.  then he stopped talking to me.
lael-2- found out who i was, then moved on. accross the country.
monique-1- never liked me. but she was funny.
mallorie-2- *see rick, a cure for the obsession with love
dana-2-  vanished.
tony-3-  gone marine
charlie-2- glendale was too uncool.
melissa-(~~)- ravaged soul with me. she continues.
danny-3- another fucking artist.  he had better things to do.
johanna-( )- i'm not freid and i'm not tin, mar
josh-1- i was not enough for him, really just part-time.
aida-.5- i'm unnecessary
tom-( )- [insert answer here]
pamela-( )- [insert answer here]
amy-( )-  [insert answer here]

for the first time heaven seems SANE for taking you away. because I am to blame, for taking you away.  lights come to flash, THEY are dark operas that end in Motorcrash, gone in a flash, as i cough on my nitrous overcast.  very real.

come drive me home.

lol, then i looked at the lines, they read: who am i? to need you when i'm down. and who are you? when i need you around, your life is not your own, and all i ask you is for another chance, another way around you, to live by circumstance. once again. 
who am i:
to need you now.
to ask you why.
to tell you no.
to deserve your love and sympathy.
you were never meant to belong to me.
and you may go, too many years built into memories, your life is your own, who am I? 
i'll be okay. to mold like clay, to break like dirt, to tear me up in your sympathy.

we have finished for tonight. fuck, there i go again. i'm sorry.

i'm finished for tonight."

but i'll tell you something, something to unwind, we're tangled up in all this shit, and i'll make you mine.

i'm sort of tired and i realized that it's not my compulsive ideas of nothing and everything.  i'm not insane. i'm not a drunk [despite what brothers will say] and this is MY journal as well, right?

i don't want to be one of those trendy i-hate-the-world for every reason nor do i want to think that modern rock is music, it might.  but hell, if puddle of fucking mud can do it and linkin park, i suppose any kind of trash is acceptable.

here we go:  i'll let you down.

and to go against my las paragraph, i'll say this, lol, i do hate the world, but in an artistic way, and as billy best put it, the world is a vampire. nobody really cares about you.  i don't understand why we all keep thinking, hoping and wasting our time that anybody does. our intentions are selfish and we are better off helping ourselves.  if we get a bone thrown at us from someone else, then we accept and react.  he threw you a bone, bite back and hope that his marrow is delicious.  i wouldn't want to be the one who bothers you, or let's you down, but you've already set expectations about what you want from me, what you want me to type and what you want to read about me.  thus i really can't change your mind. but really get over it and help yourself. trust me, you'll be much happier.  

this is not what you wanted, candy coated pain. this is pain. anacin!  we're stumbling again!--o l p

what can i do? tell me, what do i do. i don't help, but if i do, i'll fuck it up again. 

i haven't called my friend melissa.
i failed a math quiz.
i don't know what to tell a brother
i can only make temporary ideas to relieve boredom
i can't idealize who will fuck us tomorrow
i waste my money
i waste myself
i cursed a god
i can't write enough letters or package enough goods to keep three things together.  it's an unsafe road.  have you been there?  ((( I ))) CAN'T.

what's happened?  what did i do wrong?  did i also expect too much from them. i believe i've been forgiven for the begining of last semester and the way i acted, but even then, i ask nothing of you besides that  you continue-- at least together

car crash, ends my day, on the side of roads, i'm trembling i'll wake up later today, i swerved away.

i can only keep you electronically together, but I of all should know that telvision and computers are a cancer. in my room every fucking day i see those that waste their breaths away guiding some figure to death. do they realize that they are wasting their breaths away. i struggle to understand that if i let go of each breath i die a little, and i can't grow anymore, i'll explode.  yet my little girl in glendale would never listen to me, my two others in tucson can't handle me and a brother who wont talk to me.  what else will i do.  i guess in an hour i'll find out, when i let out and go back to sleep."

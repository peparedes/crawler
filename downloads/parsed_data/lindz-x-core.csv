& i love them.

Ashley's cast party was soooo much fun. We played the 'You're a Good Man Charlie Brown' Cd and we sang and danced to all the songs. Then we played 10 fingers, and the question game.. haha and I beat Kayley in the last round. Then it was time for everyone to go .. but we all might go see 'Kiss Me Kate 'this Friday/Saturday together.. which will be awwwwwesome.

well this week was an exceptional week :) i loved every minute of it.
drama camp is incredibly awesome .. i get to be Flopsy the rabbit in one scene
.. but I'm Peppermint Patty in all the rest. yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay.

Friday started out as definetly the best day ever... I had camp & then later Caro and Nadine called me from PDC and asked me to pick them up .. and I got to see all my camp friends .. such as Emma!!, and Micaela, and Nikki A., and Heather, and Alyssa, and Tucker, and Asher, and Barret.. it was truly wonderful. It made my life.

Then later I slept over Jeanine's with all the ladies.. and we watched Hairspray
& What's Eating Gilbert Grape (Match in the gas tank .. Boom Boom). Wonderful movies I must say... then me and Nadine snuck out of the house, ran down the street and stole a balloon.. and then we got locked out of Jeanine's cause Caro didnt know the door was locked and she shut it... so we star gazed for a while until they realized we were gone.


Today we went into Boston for a bit ..and then around 6 we headed over to Fenway to watch the Red Sox.. it was an awesome game .. Sox won 14-6.
The whole stadium started singing 'Sweet Caroline' haha it was soo cool.


and John Kirby said I cant come to camp because they dont need me :(
and there are only 10 spots for counselors next year ... 4 of which are taken :(

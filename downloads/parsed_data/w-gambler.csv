"event","(A Week Late, but you know what?  P-I-S-S Fuck You.)

The only 'elections' that count in my book are the ones that involve some dude cutting off some other dude's head and taking whatever he was wearing off said head or when some skirt tells some dude to cut off some other dude's head and give her the thing he was wearing on his now lopped-off said head.

I suppose I am also ok with non-merit based means of succession also, like if your maw or paw was the person who picked up that new hat, then you get to lead when they shuffle off the ole mortal coil.  Bonus points for chopping off your parents' heads?  YES PLEASE.

So good job general elections!  You have no relevance (see also: above, jackass).  And mid-term ones where we don't even pick the new Leader of the Free World?  Wow.  It's like a Teen People article on the latest 3DO games released.

Hooray Democrats!  I'm quite certain the Dems could have resurrected Hitler and ran him and he would have won his race because he's not Republican.

Foley the Page Fucker or The Scourge of Jewry?  WHICH ONE IS BLUE--I VOTE FOR YOU!  God you people are idiots.  Next time, do what I did instead of just voting party line so you don't elect Democratic hopeful and Cannibal/Zombie Jeffery Dahmer. 

If I didn't have a candidate in mind (keeping in mind that I decide who to back by who has the more ludicrous, outrageous TV spots...I almost went DeVos, but then Granholm had some ad with cartoon elephants and cartoon DeVosiexes and it pushed me over the fence), then I selected one from the available choices according to this series of questions:

1)  Is this candidate a girl? (Or have a girl's name.  Fucking Leslies fucking up my curve.)
2)  Is this candidate from a third party I know nothing about?

If a candidate met both criteria?  AUTO VOTE.  In the case of a tie, I went with whoever had the most white sounding name.

So I ended up voting Libertarian and U.S. Taxpayer quite a lot.  (As I only really cared about funding the libraries and shooting fucking mourning doves.)

BTW the U.S Taxpayer Party?  HILARIOUS.  After I voted, I called up E.F. and we deduced that either the U.S. Taxpayer Party was very, very, very against the Government and their taxes OR, less likely, they really, really liked the Government and were completely for taxes, and hoped for new ones to pay in the future.  Then I wiki-wiki-wiki'ed them.  OOPS.  They are crazy paleoconservatives.  I am pretty sure I voted for slavery again whenever I voted for one of their gyals.  BUT THEN EVERYONE ELSE DID, TOO?  

...as affirmative action got pwned in Michigan.  LOL  Good thing I'm a member in good standing of the most favored minority.  But now I'm fucking pissed I won't be able to AA myself onto volleyball teams and high kick lines.  Also, locker rooms?  

I still say that H. Rodham Clinton V. General Colin Powell (ret.) would be the most assassination and suicide-filled election EVAR.  

An example is in order.

John Q. Everyman-Publick:  ""phmigod, a girl or a minority?!  I either have to kill one or kill myself bragheghal!""  END QUOTE

And therefore an election I would definitely almost sanction.  HOORAY!


EDIT:  I've softened my position on Democratic candidate Cannibal/Zombie Jeffery Dahmer, after all, he's only eating other zombies now."

Memories

9. Are you musically inclined?

lol I once 'composed' and 'performed' the harmonica 'score' for a play (the reviews of which I cannot recall...probably with good reason) and I have a bass guitar...but ownership does not imply fluency.

The first instance of carbon based life.  Silcon based could be fun.

11. If you MUST be an animal for ONE day- what would you be?

lol obviously a bunny.

12. Ever have a near death experience?

I once choked on one of those pink chalky candies you can only seem to get in the bulk section.  I got an electric shock from an outlet plugging in a toaster one time; maybe that could have killed me.  There was an incident involving gasoline and a flame source that could have gone the wrong way, probably.  I used to run up and down the stairs with knives and shit until the one time I tripped and decided to stop doing that.  I almost got t-boned on the driver's side of Grey Lightning.

I guess I'm Chinese to whitey.  Idiots.

14. What's the name of the song that's stuck in your head right now?

I have the suspension to prove it

19. Have you ever sang in front of a big audience?

22. Do you have a crush on anybody?

tons.  some aren't even living people!

23. Ever had a drunken night in Mexico?

People only go to Mexico to be drunk, so the question?  MOOT.  NEXT

24. Has anyone ever said u looked like a celebrity?

LOL I used to get called Jackie Chan a LOT, but what other Asian celebrity is there that people would be familiar with?

25. Do you still watch kiddy movies or TV shows?

lol I have a very...simple conception of romance, I think.  So the most romantic things that someone did for me that I can think of are when someone (not my mother lol) mashed potatoes for me when I was sick and really wanted some and when I was given someone's favorite necklace to wear. 

29. Do you speak any other languages?

I speak leet and forum now, thanks to WoW.  I'm in your intrawebs, stealing your jargonz.

30. Whats your favorite smell?

All real battles stop at 6pm for dinner, right?  ""We've got no exit strategy for Sara's house!  Uh...I think I hear my mom calling me...""  MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!  

When the first Missilestorm appeared on our neighborhood battlefield, I had to friggin' wrap my bike in M-80s and drive at it to neutralize it.  The technology and arms escalation that would occur from me taking back one of these Longshots would probably lead to there being available NEW for Christmas 2006: Nerf Sarin gas.  Or maybe Nerf Howitzers.  Imagine a 50 pound ball of yellow foam which, on impact, shatters into a hundred thousand irregularly shaped Nerf shards of Nerf shrapnel.  I love the smell of Nerf in the morning!

from The Onion's A.V. Club about the upcoming Will Ferrell vehicle Stranger than Ficton:  ""America's love affair with Luigi Pirandello comes full flower in this story about one character (Ferrell) in search of an author (Emma Thompson) intent on killing him!""

Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author is one of the few plays I would probably go see incorrectly done by the local theatre company.  This sarcastic, insincere, and obscure reference to it definitely just bought my ticket.  Onion AV Club is worth more than 15 standees.

But who will go with?  Sigh.  Sadly, it's another thing I'd probably have done with someone who's out of my life.  

Time marches onward!

...as Will Ferrell, comedy whore, strikes again.  What won't he be in?  Does he have a lot of time and just not care what he does with it?  He's on Norm's comedy album that came out a few weeks ago, too.  Norm is my hero but so far the album is...ok.  The skit that is supposed to be the setpiece of the album features Mr. Ferrell and is...not good.  I think the main problem is they made Norm enunciate.  Like 10% of his funny is how he mumbles and swears a lot, mumbling.  Or when he goes, ""ahhhhhhhh....!""

Lol there's this movie called Troop Beverly Hills that my sister or my mom or my family all really liked or thought one of the other members really liked a lot so I saw it like 20 times growing up.  I guess Jenny Lewis from Rilo Kiley and The Postal Service was in it, which is funny?  (It's not as funny as it was when I first discovered this.)

First person to bring me a dvd copy of that movie gets reimbursed for the price of said movie.

Do I miss it?  Sure.  I'm a lot hungrier on average, but there's like 16 other things my body produces that I can eat instead.  I'll just have to figure out a way of harvesting those in public that won't get me arrested.  Or a really creepy date.

Instead of bloody, chewed stumps at the end of my hands, I have fucking tiny shovels that constantly fill themselves with whatever deadly poisons or biohazards I've handled on any given day?  AWESOME.

Or should I say tiny syringes?  Because they fucking cut me all the time, too.  If there's anything I learned in elementary school, other than pizza = good, it's that nails are sharp as hell.  I'm not sure if I just pissed girls off a lot or what, but I got clawed and kicked in the shins by them SO MUCH.  So I'm well aware of fingernails' skin-puncturing capabilities.  So now, if my back itches and I scratch it, HOORAY, all the bullshit underneath my nails just got directly placed into my bloodstream, since my nails carved me up like a Christmas goose.

"event","Very tired, but when I came home TBS was showing (as I should have guessed, since they show it 22 times a month) The Negotiator, the greatest not-so-good movie ever.

You got Sam Jackson being mad with a gun (every movie he's ever been in), Kevin Spacey, the tall guard from Green Mile, Pauly Giamatti, and Siobahn Fallon all having fun.  It's good stuff.  I will watch this movie any time, any place, under any circumstances.  You also should.

The movie kind of all falls together at the end though, which sucks.  Movies are better when either nothing gets solved or everyone gets shit on or a combination of the both.

Lost in Translation, Ghost World, and that movie about affairs with Richard Gere and Diane 'HOT"" Lane are all great movies that illustrate the first point.  Nothing really gets resolved at the end, and that is how life works out.  Friggin when was the last time you broke up a wedding because you were in love with the bride and *GASP*, she was too?  Never in your life.  If life worked out like a Guy Ritchie film (Snatch, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels) it would be boring and you could just do whatever the shit you wanted because YOU WIN in the end, Dr. Pangloss-style.  NOT FUN.

Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back, American Beauty, Spider-Man are good everyone gets shit on movies.  Star Wars IV and VI...how the fuck do the Rebels win EVER?!  Star Wars V was the only one with any realism because you go hey, the Empire has the universe's resources behind it, yet 12 fighters beat it?  Not so much.  Empire Strikes Back = Hoth?  Smoked.  Han?  Smoked.  Leia?  Smoked.  Luke?  SMOKED.  I'm pretty sure Bespin isn't in too great of shape, either.

Kevin Spacey gets the shit killed out of him at the end of American Beauty, just when stuff started working out great for everyone involved.  That's about how things go in life.  Except maybe instead of getting killed by the ex-marine that kissed you who lives next door, you just lose your job or wreck your car.  But the point is you didn't single-handedly bring an entire galactic regime down because you were too short to see over the console of the starfighter you hijacked.

Spider-Man has to fight and kill his best friend's father and turn down the love of his life so she doesn't POTENTIALLY get hurt in the future due to mere association.  His life BLOWS.  But what can you do?  Life tends to suck, you do what you can.

HAMAS BY A LANDSLIDE!

Errone is talking about how this is going to 'destabilize the region'.  A fucking SLICE OF CHEESE could destabilize that region.


""Um Lois...go get the medical dictionary and look up 'fork' and 'lung'"".  We used to have this big yellow book for emergencies that basically as ludicrious as that: what do to if you have a stingray needle in your arm, or a knife in your trach..  I used to read it all the time.


I got this new coat for Christmas.  Most of you have seen it; if you haven't...well, whatev.  (I asked for a digital camera as well, but didn't get one, so you lose.)  Anyway, there's this famous <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v406/w_gambler/USGrant.gif"">Mathew Brady picture of Ulysses S. Grant</a> that I've secretly, and other times not-so-secretly, always tried to emulate.  This coat helps me do that so much more.  It is probably the Greatest Coat Ever.  I can't wait until it gets stained with red paint by Pam Anderson.


There's this guy who calls himself The Great Racist.  I'm not going to link his stuff because I'm too lazy for that today, but I encourage you to watch it because it is pretty hilarious.  The caveat is, it IS racist material, so if you're going to fucking post comments like, ""blah blah racist"", fuck off and don't watch it in the first place.  Isn't there a rally you need to be attending anyway, Nazi?  Ouch.  That parallel has got to hurt.

I'm in PSY 441 this semester, it's all about relationships and group interactions.  The simple question of, 'what is the 'typical family' depicted as comprised of?' got the BIGGEST SILENCE I've ever heard in a classroom...and I've been in EMPTY CLASSROOMS before.  Oh, you know that the answer is a man, women, 2 kids, and maybe a dog?  YOU ARE A SEXIST, CLASSIST, HOMOPHOBE.  PROBABLY A RACIST, TOO.  Some hippie wanted to start a fight, but the teacher stepped in and cut her off since we only had 15 minutes left in class after the HOUR OF SILENCE.

The boys are the worst.  If they do get called upon, they're always saying bullshit like, ""I do my own laundry and I don't expect my girlfriend to cook"", when you KNOW they don't know the difference between Tide and thyme.  Being a liar and a coward is worse than being racist or sexist.  Just admit you know the stereotypes, you collar popped fuck.  Everybody knows them--it doesn't mean you believe them.  OR DOES IT?

The problem is everyone thinks that if you know it, you believe it.  I know that there's a book called The Bible and a Theory of evolution.  Fuck, I must believe in those things!  Oh you.  You got me there.

FLYING SPAGHETTI MONSTERS RULE THE WORLD.


NBC's Thursdays are pretty good again.  I think My Name is Earl is pretty funny, and usually oddly uplifting somehow.  The Office is alright.  The one guy's (I have no idea of anyone's name in the show) slow burn is really funny, especially when he like backhandedly looks at the camera like ""oh fucking seriously?  You've got to be kidding.""  I would totally do Angela.  Also Pam.  Zuh.


So mine accidents, eh?  Yeah, pass that bill on creating safer mining conditions because someday mining will be the safest job possible if we do.  MINING IS DANGEROUS.  Also, IF YOU LIVE IN A COASTAL AREA THAT IS LIKE A MILE BELOW SEA LEVEL AND KEPT DRY BY MAN-MADE LEVEES, HURRICANES WILL DO A LOT OF DAMAGE.  DON'T BUILD A GIANT MANSION ON THE SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN PRONE TO MUDSLIDES IF YOU ARE GOING TO CRY ABOUT IT WHEN THERE'S A HUGE MUDSLIDE.  Why are people so dumb?  ""Let's sue the government because they didn't use technology that doesn't exist to protect us from a natural disaster!""  Let me get Scotty on the horn to just beam that out of the area next time, ok?

I was watching a football game and some team was playing the New Orleans Saints and the announcer was yelling about someone doing a 'hurricane kick', and you could just hear him saying in his mind as he said it, ""Oh fuck.  Worst choice ever.""  It was pretty hilarious.


Sure death and destruction sucks.  I'm secretly a humanist at heart.  I like you people, really.  The hurricane sucked and New Orleans was a great place.  But everyone blaming the govenment for it is just ridiculous.  No levee ever made would have prevented the destruction.  It's just like people blaming the government for 9-11.  Yeah, I can just see you guys in 1996 voting yes to putting guys with guns on all public flights because the government thinks that....'what's that you say?  People are going to hijack planes and fly them into buildings?  Buildings like the World Trade Center and The MF Pentagon?  Yeah, ok, I'd rather you buy 1500 dollar toilet seats than waste my money on that, thanks.  (Somebody's  been playing too much GTA!)'  So even if the government could do have done 'something' about that, how?  When?  Where?  And you'd vote no on it anyway because it involves guns, increasing taxes, and the big, bad government stomping on your personal rights.

I went to the Detroit Auto Show thing Sunday.  I really only go to see the Jeep waterfall thing--it spells words and makes shapes and stuff.  I learned it is not approriate to ask the hot girls that stand next to the cars how many torsos would fit in the trunk of the cars they are standing next to, not because of the implied murdering and social stigma associated with the murdering arts, but because the girls don't know ass about the cars.  Except this one knew all 5 colors it came in.  GG

Quick comedy note: if you replace the generic 'torso' with 'torsos like yours' it is funnier, but exponentially increases the amount of armed officers summoned to your general location, BUT FAST!


Taking care of just the wireless network here at 575 Cornell is like a full-time job, I'd hate to have to manage, like, a REAL one.

Is it possible to remotely reset routers to steal bandwidth?  DEATH BLOOMS IF IT IS.  And please, sir, will you teach me how?


I'm not going to claim that <a href=""http://movies.yahoo.com/feature/datemovie.html"">Date Movie</a> is going to be good, but any movie that mocks the god-awful Napoleon Dynamite and has someone doing a Lil Jon impression is good enough for me.  Watch the trailer, ya'll.

Tests like these are great because they are so wildly inaccurate and horribly inadequate.  I was especially proud of how close I am to totalitarian...a distinction I will not deny, as long as I am the Totalitarian.

24. It should be legal for two consenting adults to challenge each other to a duel and fight a Death Match.

You know that got a Hell Yeah! from me.  DEATH MATCH: ME, YOU, OAK TREE, TOMORROW!!!!

I saw an rerun of SNL a couple of weeks ago.  Darrell Hammond did his Trump impression while shooting a commercial for Domino's pizza.

My greatest fear: that the Scarred Bitch of the End-Times had a hand in writing any part of it.  It sucks when your life gets flipped, turned upside-down UNLESS you happen to be Cousin Will.  And even then, he had to put up with Carlton, so it wasn't all pool parties and DJ Jazzy Jeff.

My cousin is home for the holidays from the Navy.  He tells us great Navy stories like how he has to get his hair cut every week, how he almost missed his haircut one week, and how he just had his haircut for the week done a few days ago.  Unless you died, THE STORY IS BORING.

It would be like me talking about what I eat when I am away at school...which I do incessantly out of spite.  I WIN.

Nah, it would suck if he died, mainly because then I'd have to like cure cancer or invent physics or some bullshit to catch up.

It will be awesome when I find out a family member reads this and I have to defend this post in the name of the advancement of hilarity in these dark times.  What I meant to say was....The Pledge of Allegiance?  I GUESS I GOT CONFUSED.

Because they made the books into movies, I recently reread The Chronicles of Narnia.  There's some type of stupid-ass controversy about Book 7 and what happens to Susan.  She just stopped believing in it, so she doesn't go back.

Either way, Book 7, The Last Battle, will make a fine movie for the kiddies, since the premise has all of the main characters from the previous books, save Susan, dying in a train wreck and concludes with the destruction of the land of Narnia.  (SORRY IF I SPOILED THE 50 YEAR OLD BOOK FOR YOU, IDIOTS.)  Please see the first six Narnia movies because I REALLY want to see how Disney handles all the death, hooray!  And supposedly Susan grows up to be crazy hot.  That will translate well onto the big screen.  Fictional charaters are fun to date!"

"event","As per everyone's away messages, I was coerced into debarking to the vaunted Midland Street for the 'biggest bar night of the year'.

Coerced meaning planned and coordinated the whole affair, of course.

With enough Fris vodka and ex-girlfriends to sufficiently amuse me, it was only 40% disappointing.  Usually it is more class reunion-like instead of creepy old guys staring at hot girls half their age-like.  So I didn't get to see a hundred people whose names I forgot 3 years ago--I saw enough people whose names I forgot a year ago to make up for that.  But then I remembered them suddenly and made sure to interrupt their conversation by just yelling it at them.  YEAH!  I WIN.

I like the Midland Street bars because when I ask for a vodka by name--because I read it off the bottle I was looking at behind the bar--the bartender goes, ""huh, what?  I've never heard of that!"", and then I spend 10 minutes directing their gaze towards the plainly obvious bottle and then pay them some amount of dollars they just made up off the top of their heads to drink it.  Usually seven.  Sometimes two.  Tonight, twelve.

Anyway, the drunken yelling at the Texan afterwards was fun enough that I forgot about that crappy 40% until just now.  Fucking bullshit sobering up crap.  God damn.  Also, eggs poached easy are not homosexual in anyway--YOU ARE.

Everyone that didn't make it out--Swami, AJ, The Wonder Twins, Maxson--you lose, idioths.  Way to be stupid and some other crap.

Watch the video of him documenting this.  In fact, watch all the videos of him just being an idiot.  It is genius level idiocy, the kind that only the genius possess and the insane lament?

Anyway, I didn't personally call him--I had my people do it.  They're hammering out some details of something imaginary AS WE (THEY?) SPEAK (TYPE.).

They should really let me be famous, because I'd do shit like that all the time.  I once scripted what I would do on Letterman, and it was funny, but alas, it was lost to the ravages of time and my ""OCDlemia"" condition, where I have binges of just purging everything that's junk in my room in an effort to take control of my life through cleaning, only to wake up next to the toilet bowl cleaner the next day going, ""what the fuck happened?!"" and then proceeding to throw up a packet or two of loose-leaf notebook paper and a pound of mixed bulk candy into the air, scattering it nicely and resuming life as normal, for me.  Also, sex with Paris Hilton!

IN WoW NEWS, my guild killed Lord Victor Nefarious, the Lord of Blackrock Mountain, brood of Deathwing.  It's kind of like beating the game, in much the same way that getting a Tetris beats Tetris.  Or getting to the boat section of Spy Hunter beats Spy Hunter.  Speaking of which, fuck Spy Hunter.

Arrested Development was seemingly cancelled, which sucks because I fucking told all you bastards to watch it, which you OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T.  OMG YES, DEAR IS ON, BETTER TURN THAT ON!  A NEW EPISODE OF AMERICA'S (ADJECTIVE) (NOUN)?  HOW COULD I MISS THAT?!

DEATH BLOOMS FOR SOMEONE, I HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT QUITE WHO EXACTLY YET, THOUGH.

I bet you're all watching 12 oz. Mouse, which is fucking horrible.  There's good insane (Vincent Van Gogh's paintings!) and there's bad insane (Vincent Van Gogh's Home Cosmetic Surgery!).  12 oz. is the ear-chopping off and mailing it kind--that's the bad kind, you Philistines who didn't get the Van Gogh reference.  I do like Squidbillies and The Boondocks, though.  Perfect Hair Forever becomes a series on Sunday, and that was pretty funny also.  Ramble ramble.  None of that made sense.

I went to this club in Ann Arbor called Oz last Friday.  It was a lot like the movie, and the book on which the movie was based.  They were about 500 Indian pre-med students fighting due to the state and caste they were from back in the 'old country', right?  Oh, that Toto!  Also, anal raping.  Seriously though, they were playing like Indian hip-hop all night--if it weren't for the 14 Jager shots, and people I was there with puking on other people I was there with, the night would have still been REALLY HILARIOUS.  OMG LOL.

(BTW, ""OMG LOL"" is my new catchphrase.  It's really fun to say in the middle of a 'real' conversation, about budget deficits or war deaths or why you couldn't have committed that murder because you were, as the previous character witness said, in an entirely different city.)

SPeaking of which, I was also in Chicago last weekend...which proved to be a little less fun than the previous night (RE: Punjab jabberings and Puking in Big Brown Bags) but still awesome since I got a slice of pizza the size of a normal pizza.  JAWSOME!"

Today I'm going to list some of the best of the best of the best of these foodstuff marvels and why you should eat them the next time you can't trick a girl into making you a fancy dinner with empty promises of a shiny ring or a shiny dodge or not giving her a shiner.

4-cheese lasagna Hamburger Helper: Fucking kick-ass.  This is tasty as hell, with the added bonus of having powdered mixes.  Powdered mixes are usually tasty as hell alone, so don't be shy in doing the ol' spoonful for me, spoonful for the actual foodstuff routine.  The topping is probably the best part.

""Bacon-grease eggs"":  cook a pound of bacon, then scramble like 4 eggs (three if you're just a lil guy like me) in the grease.  This whole process takes like 4 minutes, tops, but the results will stick with you for a LIFETIME, of which it also shortens considerably.  A good-looking corpse never tasted so good!  (WTF?)

Shake-N-Bake pork chops: the coating is so damn tasty.  After I'm done shaking, and while it's baking, I eat the left over coating straight out of the shaker bag.  Once again proving that sometimes, food particles are much better than the food itself.

Tuna fish in a packet:  this is awesome.  No more draining or cutting yourself on the can lid (unless you're into that).

Well, I'm done with thisbullshit.  It wasn't as entertaining as I thought it would be.  Sucks to be you if you read it, eh?  Also, I am very hungry.



""I think I'll become a little more pretentious and self-involved with my 'Internet persona' and make my livejournal friends-only!""  WHAT A STUPID FUCKING MOVE.

""7-2?  ALL IN.""  SMARTER PLAY.  It's completely counter-intuitive to the entire concept of the weblog, or blog, as fuckheads like to call them.  Don't fucking use the word blog, unless you want to be an asshole.  Or fuckhead.  I guess I called you fuckheads first, right asshole?  DEATH BLOOMS.

Oh someone you go to school with that you're crunching on found your journal and knows you like/hate/like-hate them, on noes!  Better make it friends only and block them!  Idiot.  You signed up for bullshit like that because it's the INTERNET!  In fact, you probably opened the journal and poured out all the crap about that person in the hope they'd find it and read it.




Supposedly we're going to have a cocktail party in a week or so.  Come on down to East Lansing to get drunk and whatnot.  Not that anyone has ever came down to East Lansing with a purpose other than getting drunk.  (Come to East Lansing or came to East Lansing?)

Friggin' go to their site and download Unicorns LA.  The video for it is the coup de grace, as the French say, but if you want to be a baby and stay within the theme of this post, just get the .mp3.

Meat Loaf's Paradise by the Dashboard Light  from the album Bat Out of Hell is about the funniest song ever.

The Aquabats! have a new album: Charge!!.  Highlights include Meltdown!  (sample lyrics: ""Then he had a meltdown, he had a meltdown.  He didn't wanna, he didn't wanna have a meltdown--but he had one!)

Next up on the countdown is Annie's Chewing Gum.  She's from some European country like Sweden or something.  Good for her.  Best song ever.

Vying--maybe a winner was chosen, I guess I don't care either way--for England's Mercury Prize (think Grammys except with tea and crumpets?) are a bunch of bands who don't matter except for The Magic Numbers and The Go! Team.  Morning's Eleven by the first band and Ladyflash by 'the latter' are pretty awesome.

Danger Mouse and MF Doom (a couple of rappers...or comic book characters?!) put out some collaboration called the Mouse and the Mask, a Adult Swim/Underground Hip-Hop mishmash of fuckin' absoludicrious levels.  (Ghostface Killah is on the third track!!!!  Whoever the fuck that is.)  This is what rap should be--not about this shootin' each other, slappin up bitches,bling bling crap, but a celebration of cartoons.  And maybe our parents sometimes just not understanding (Fresh Prince stizyle!).

The title track off Deerhoof's concept album Milk Man is almost annoying enough to be catchy.  Credit the lead singer's fragile grasp of the English language for that.  (She's from Japan or some other chipmunk language nation.)  Deerhoof seriously ups the ante for this list's credibility with music snobs, so we've got to go the other direction for this next one:

Cannibal Corpse's ""Stripped, Raped, and Strangled"".  Funny story behind this one--Internet pranksters (or fucking whiny-ass anti-rape advocates [LIBERALS!]) decided to splice this song together with currently non-relevant songbird Tori Amos advertising some 24-hour rape hotline.  THE IRONY.  A song a bout rape + an anti-rape hotline = Comedic Genious.  Anyway, this version has made it nigh-impossible to fucking get the real version of the song now, which is a total classic in my book.  A must read.  (The song, that is.  Not my book; that doesn't exist.  On this level.  Also, by read, I meant listen.  It's confusing, I know.)

Metric is from Canada, but they seem to have nothing better to do than write songs about how Amurrica and its gov'ment (i.e. GWB) suck ass.  Too bad for U.S. (us/U.S....it's a pun, you idiots) that those songs are friggin awesome!  Move to Canada, folks.  And check out Succexy. off Old World Underground, their debut album.

Avenged Sevenfold rocks out on Blinded in Chains, and really most of the rest of City of Evil, the name of the album which Blinded in Chains is on.  GO FIGURE!  Lawl.

Lastly, we've got theSTART with Gorgeous, which I played on repeat for probably a week straight.  It's that good.  Also, I broke my mouse and keyboard.

Hate her so much and she isn't even real so I can punch her in the face or some crap.  And even then, she's dead from AIDS, that dirty cunt.

I once got in an argument over whether Jenny died of AIDS or cancer.  If only I had remembered that in the movie she says that it is a virus killing her, then I would not have been forced to acquiesce that MAYBE it was the cancer.  Another argument about nothing I should have won SPOILED AGAIN--and those are the worst kind to lose, because every damn argument ever is about nothing.  Or everything.  Death blooms.  And Jenny's a slut.  Because only sluts get AIDS.

I think another reason Forrest Gump is a good movie is because it trivializes 4 decades of American History--one idiot singlehandedly caused or participated in every major event that occured in his lifetime.  I'm surprised he only saw Reagan get shot at on the TV, a better writer would have had Hinckley drop the gun in his nervousness, and Forrest there to return it to his hands, saying something like, ""here, sir, you dropped this--momma always said you pin things to your coat so you don't drop them because you're retarded, son.""  Zing!

Anyway, they should make a prequel where Forrest's grandpappy like accidentally shoots Gen. Stonewall Jackson as he returns back to camp on a foggy eve, spooks Mrs. O'Leary's cow, and probably meets Eliot Ness or is the stableboy that points Mary to the horsestall she'll be sleeping in; ""I heard that lady had a baby who got nailed to a tree some time later...that's all I have to say about that.""  (All that happened at about the same time, as I recall.  Because knowledge is power!)  Prequels are FTW, sir.

I was once told in some stupid class I had that New Orleans was going to be underwater in like 75 years because of geology or whatever.  Looks like someone didn't give that memo to the voodoo wind gods!

It doesn't take retarded children--who spend half the time trying to eat the book--this long to read a Harry Potter book.  And that's counting the ones that don't even know how read.  So what is The Goat's excuse?  Anyway, Snape kills Dumbledore, but it's all part of a grander plan involving the wizened old wizard returning just when the short, idiotic, 'hero' character and his band of friends need him the most.  But was I talking about Star Wars or The Lord of the Rings?  I GUESS I GOT CONFUSED.

ASLAN THE LION SAVES!

Sersiously though, for a series of books so firmly grounded in reality, I do doubt that Dumbledore will come back in any manner, especially not via fucking talking and walking oil-on-canvas paintings.  And if Snape dies, I'm burning down England.

Also, because we're already on the subject, I found out that most of Harry Potter's readers aren't children at all--it's mainly pederasts (future and present) and, most likely, furries!  YIFF YIFF!  To wit--the greatest pasttime of the fandom of Harry Potter is 'shipping'--short for 'relationshipping'.  In which, writers of fan fiction stories place two (sometimes more!) of the characters in very teneble positions.  The Kama Sutra lists most of these.

The main problem, it seems, that the new book creates in the fan world is how to properly 'ship' Dumbledore and Snape, Snape and Hermione, Draco and Harry, Remus and Buckbeak, Ron and Percy, Wolf-form Remus biting Trelawny so there can be a wolf-form Trelawny, Hermione and myself, etc., etc, because of the events in the book.  Awesome.

The front yard to my new place down in East Lansing is just a big patch of dirt, the kind that is probably perfect for setting up beer pong tables, or for fracturing your skull on when you fall down drunk on it.  I'll run some scientific tests to confirm/deny this when I officially move in on Saturday.  So far we've determined that there are 3 unsecured wireless connections we can access...I've suggested that we use the network named the defualt 'Linksys' because it is obviously paid for by a bunch of girls, since they don't know anything about computers.  It is very cute.

The other two networks, however, are very mysterious.  They are both named (Nick and 3East, respectively), but unsecured.  Why would you do this?  It's like two more steps to secure the network.  Anyway, they all lose, as the MPAA and RIAA is gonna come thundering down on them once I get started lol.  Who wants to pay to see The Aristocrats anyway or pay to rent the Aristocats because the title of the raunchy comedy documentary reminded you of the racist Disney cartoon?

Avant-garde for teh win, e.e cummings style, because finding words that rhyme with 'sucks', 'hate' and 'omg the government is ebil and so are my parents I think I will kill myself but wait there's a girl who looked at me so maybe I should follow her around constantly uh oh restraining order repeat cycle' gets soooo boring after you do it three times a day every day for like, you know, A DAY.

I also saw Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory today.  WOW.  Let me just say this about it: HORSE-SHIT.  Johnny Depp, trying to trump his own performance as Captain Jack Sparrow in 2000-somethings Pirates of the Carribean, completely ruins the entire film.  Gene Wilder is like 500x more menacing and eccentric WITHOUT shitty flashbacks for no reason, cartoonish facial expressions, and an idiotic voice that grates forever and ever.  Almost everything about the new verson sucks, except Grandpa George, who steals the show over whiny, coddling Grandpa Joe.  TAKE GEORGE TO THE FACTORY, CHARLIE, HE'S A HUGE BADASS.  Also, half the 'charm' (I don't have a fucking clue what that means) of the original stems from the ungodly shitty 'special effects' of the 1970s, especially during the oompa loompa songs.  I would concede, under pressure, that the new oompa loompas are cooler and scarier than the old, but the songs were kind of...uh...not remarkable in any way.

That is the first movie I've seen more than once in theaters since I worked at a theater, so I'd see every movie like 80 times.  There's a really funny part where they are fighting and Brad Pitt just starts kicking her over and over, but no one else laughs when I do--in fact, I can tell that whole scene got edited down hardcore because of 'abuse to women' concerns.  Fuck that, they are both fucking hired killers.  Idiots.  Vince Vaughn is pretty funny, I might be a fan of his if it weren't for motherfucking Swingers.  WHAT A HORRIBLE MOVIE--GOOD JOB TRYING TO CREATE SLANG, BTW.  THAT WAS MONEY.  Assholes.  Anyone attached to it = asshole.  The fact I've even seen more than the trailer for it means I'm an asshole.  If you've seen it, you are too, smart guy.  ALL BECAUSE OF SWINGERS.  If there's anyone I want to be able to do a good impression of, it's Vince Vaughn.  His cadence and delivery is hilarious.  And he's almost reached Will Ferrell levels of comedy whoredom/overexposure!  AWESOME.  (Will Ferrell will do anything, and play the exact same character while doing it.  At least you only see Sandler like once a year.)  The Island, with superhot Scarlet Johanssen (who I, after much discussion with myself, recently decided is hotter than Natalie Portman) is probably goig to be awesome also.

I took a couple of philosophy classes during summer session, in case you have no reading comprehension/haven't read the last like 4 posts I made, so in case a recent conversation I had with you has gravitated to the area of 'metaphysics', I apologize.  I caught myself doing it recently and was reminded of Step's friend Moksha or whatever, who had the most arrogant, annoying journal EVER, mainly because he, too, had taken a PHL course or two.  I do suggest everyone take an intro to philosophy course or something because it is interesting stuff, but I also recently started a journal for my WoW character, so I may just be an idiot.  The game is to find it and comment about the ridiclousness of its existence until I get bored of updating it and shut it down.  Hooray for games!  Winner gets all the free oxygen they can breathe.  TO DIE FOR!

Lol

The last two weekends I have spent with my family, up north at my aunt and uncle's condo, and at my cousin's ""shipping off to the Navy"" goodbye deal.  At both places there were some randoms there--friends of my cousin, frineds of my aunts and uncles and whatever, so I got to have fun playing the ""black sheep"" of the family.  I took a fifth of Absolut up to the cabin, and even though I didn't drink any of it, all they did was talk about it.  I also spent almost the entire time after Rebecca left the Navy party reading the Left Behind series of books they had laying around which, God aside, are kind of fun books.  Too bad I couldn't read all 12 of them.  WHAT THE HELL?  I read the first and last one and I don't see any way you can make the middle 10 books unless they spliced the entire text of the Book of Relevations in there somewhere.  OR maybe I am just not a really bad, hackneyed, writer that just fills pages and pages with inane bullshit that doesn't progress the story anywhere?  OH WAIT, I AM.  I thought greed was a sin, Left Behind authors?

Homework this week--still get WoW, since none of you did that (E's all around), find the new mystery journal, read at least Left Behind (book 1), if not all of them (to fill me in on what I missed), and see Mr. and Mrs. Smith.  And The Island, and Wedding Crashers, I think they come out Friday.

AND DRINK BOOZE ERRDAY!

"event","So I was sitting in class writing an in-class essay, when the damnable Chinaman sitting next to me was all like, 'U China??'.

Does it look like I am working on the first railway line from California to New York over here? Have I been burying my female offspring alive? Not quite, but please, continue with whatever the hell stupid-ass crap you were going to say as to why you thought I was Chinese.

'Oh, I just saw your handwriting, which is a lot of straight up and down lines, so I thought maybe Chinese was your first language. Or at least some Asian script. Instead, it seems, that you just write like a chicken in his 4th year of kindergarten.'

Then the chicken in the row ahead of us turned around and was like, 'Please. Don't insult me by comparing this kid's handwriting to my people's at any age'.

Before the kindergartener in his group could chime in with his two cents, I fucking kicked him in the god-damned face. And the chicken offered his wing to some black girl, and she's was all like, 'THAT'S SO RACIST, GIRLFRIEND', so the Jew and Arab kids in class blew him and most of the rest of us up, while I, with my big stick, got (cue music)   STUCK IN THE MIDDLE WITH YOU.

MSU is a fucking weird school.



Since anytime I am connected to the Internet I must be logged on onto World of Warcraft, lest I miss some event of import (such as the potential that the next Rich Thorium Vein I mine will contain an Arcane Crystal), and since broadband Internet means I am always connected, it follows to reason that I MUST be logged onto WoW constantly. ""GG Blizzard,"" as they say.

HOWEVER, everyone is moving out and no one really wanted to pay for cable, so I am actually not connected to the Internet right now. (How I am posting this, then, shall remain one of the world's great mysteries. [The computer lab in the Chemistry building.]) No WoW make Tyler go something, something...

Our good friend MC Rawford/Ballgrabber, in the meantime, has landed himself a real job, with aspirations to the actuarial sciences. This led me to wonder,

<U>What Has WoW Done for Me?</U>

According to my calculations (which don't exist), so far I have determined (not really) that WoW has considerably lengthened my life expectancy (debatable). I am just waiting for the results from my studies done by my second (who does exist, albeit solely in my head), so those should be factored in close to maybe someday, probably never.

Had I not been playing WoW, I most likely would have been drinking, eating pills, drinking AND eating pills, playing in traffic, petting various strange animals and sharp objects, dodging bullets and/or flirting with Death, amongst various other activities we'll call 'class' and 'sleeping'. Although my diet (mainly Shake n' Bake porkchops and Faygo) was far from nutritious, last year I had no WoW and survived solely on beef jerky, Tang, and sunflower seeds.

The exact amount time my life has been extended seems to be about 1.33 (repeating, of course--oh man, a WoW in-joke even!) years, which, when added to my old life expectancy, means I SHOULD have died probably a week ago.

My empirically confirmed immortality, then, must be explained in some manner. And for this I will refer you to my pact with Beelzebub, who will be also referenced within this text as Satan, The Devil, He, Him, My Lord, and whatever else seems fit. Not that this administration worships or condones worshipping Him, nor does it imply existence of said God and Saviour--just that IF a Devil exists, PERHAPS I MIGHT strike up a deal with Him. Again, highly speculative, as the greatest trick The Fallen One ever pulled on you jokers is convincing you He doesn't exist. And who am I to spoil that?

ANYWAY, the current deal I have with Santa Claus is I live until I have finished my job (job to be named at a future date). Kind of like mob favors, I guess. Except instead of murdering someone with a sawed-off baseball bat and eventually ending up in the East River, I end up in some Fiery Lake of Unending Doom. PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING, IMO.

I say current deal because we've had to revise it a few times here and there as I find new ways to tax His great power. i.e. It was originally I live until I change the world as he saw fit, but I took that to mean 'gain super powers able to terraform Earth' ,and was exposing myself to as much radioactivity as I could find...that had to stop :( Then there was some weird thing about a fiddle of gold or some crap, but you all know how that turned out...

...and that's why WoW was a gift from that other dude people like so much, Wayne Gretzky.

(He's The Great One.)




The moral of both stories is: good handwriting is for girls, and girls are bad. Rape and pillage, sirs. Rape and pillage. AM I DONE NOW, SATAN?!

All randomness aside, you should all get WoW, listen to Gorgeous by theSTART and the cover of Tom Sawyer by Mindless Self Indulgence, check out <a href=""http://www.e-thug.net"">this</a> link, Stephanie should watch last week's episode of Family Guy (aka Season 4, episode 6), which was the best EVER for reasons that she will see as obvious, and then everyone report back to me for a blue ring and the next quest in the chain.

So I have two philosophy classes for the summer semester.

Philosophy is tougher than I expected, because you are trying to bullshit other bullshitters and one cannot shit a shitter.  UNLESS one has more past bullshit to reference and bullshit that it is relevant to whatever bullshit you are currently bullshitting about.  Thusly, I was forced to buy the textbooks and am royally pissed at having to have done so.

My intuitive concept of education does not include buying motherfucking textbooks.  HATE.

I got my hair cut like crazy, needing-gel-in-it short.  It was either that or something with bangs, since I have no idea what bangs are anyway.

The girl that did the cutting of my hair was young and hip.  I bet it sucks for her that she is plying her craft at MasterCuts in the Bay City Mall.  And it sucks for me that I went to MasterCuts in the Bay City Mall.

I do enjoy grabbing at my head and yelling for a mirror when people say things like, 'oh, I see you got a haircut' or 'did you get a haircut?'.  I am going to start telling people I am in medium to light chemotherapy for medium to light cancer--you don't lose your hair, it just gets a little shorter.

Instead of wearing fucking trendy-ass yellow braclets to show you care about the fight against cancer, friggin do the chemotherapy drug cocktail--more demand = more production = less costs for those that need the drugs!  And since we'd all be on chemo = no cancer!

It is 3 am, and Angels in the Outfield is on TBS.  Improbably, it stars Danny Glover, Christopher Lloyd, with Matthew McConaughey, Tony Danza, and a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  4 people needed new boats and someone wanted a new RC one, it seems, as it may be the worst, lamest movie ever made...yet I cannot look away.  And that is why I am still awake, watching it.

...instead of at the midnight showing of Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith.

I only started watching it because I heard Chris Lloyd being crazy and thought it was something cool like Back to the Future or Who Framed Roger Rabbit.  I was sleepy--fucking TBS tricked me.  Just like they tricked me with that damnedable 'Yes, Dear' show.  I KNOW ALL THE MAIN CHARACTERS NAMES.  MAY HAVE TO REMOVE BRAIN TO PURGE BAD DATA.

I suppose I am lucky I am not in anyway responsible for the production of the show.  Someone's obviously going to spend some time in hell for that.  That's all part of the deal...


On the last day of one of my classes last term, a girl was wearing a <a href=""http://www.SuicideGirls.com"">SuicideGirls</a> shirt.  Which begs the question: Is she just a fan of the crazy naked girls, or is she herself one of the crazy naked girls?  (Original text: Is she just a fan of the crazy hot naked girls, or is she herself one of the crazy hot naked girls...because the suicide girls are largely hit-or-miss, lol)

Anyway, I never got a chance to find out the answer because I was the first one done with the exam.  Again.  Really, my only goal when I take an exam is to be in the top three finishers.  Like a horse race.  First is nice, but second and third still get you money.  (Or not.  I don't really know that much about horse racing.)  Passing = extra ball bonus score round!!!!

They really should give time bonuses, though.  When you're out on the jobsite and things are flying at your head, you don't get a chance to friggin diagram out stupid crap or consult your precious notes.  Veins and worlds are exploding about your head, good Doctor--you've got to go go go!  So please, give me all As when I turn in exams that are 85th percentile and the first to hit the inbox.

Man, I remember the days when I knew every movie that was released in the past year, currently playing, or coming out (Adam Kerbleski-style) back when I worked at Bay City 8.  But now, as a poor college student who doesn't work at a theater...negative to movies.  I want to see Constantine, but paying for movies suck.

ON a non-related topic, I will be back in town sometime next week for Spring Break, so if Andrea or Kristina or Kelly Jo or something want to hang out, maybe catch a movie....eh?  EH?

I thought Clint Eastwood was dead.  Turns out he's not.

Nah, I didn't really, but I DID watch the Back to the Future movies and wondered if, since the ravine is named the Eastwood Ravine after 'Clint Eastwood', if Clint Eastwood choose a different stage name....perhaps Sandy McSouthers????

There was an really old episode of Saturday Night Live on at like 5 am Saturday night; George Carlin was the host.  In addition to containing Carlin's worst bit, the episode had one of those fake commercials.  It was for a razor with three blades--because that seems like a ludicrous, nutty thing to have.  They even had a graphic that showed the three blades cutting in sequence--JUST LIKE EVERY RAZOR COMMERCIAL TODAY.  It was nuts--what seemed like a such a stupid-ass marketing ploy that it should be made fun of by SNL actually exists today!  And aren't they making 4 bladed razors now?  The Irony.

I ran out of soda pop about 2 weeks ago and did not want to go to Meijer because that's like 2 hours of World of Warcrafting I'd miss out on.  So I lived off of terribly watered-down Tang, then switched to fucking Hi-C juice packs--of which all that was left were the god-damned Sour Blast kind.  Fuck balls, that sucks when you forget about the sour coating on the inside of the straw and just suck on one like Maxson...something gay....whatever, you all know the drill with these posts--I'm gay, Maxson's gay, Joel drugged Raoul and fucked him, Adam's stupid....anyway.  After which, I started making Jell-O just to drink it when it was cool enough to drink, but not cool enough to have set and choke me as I tried to drink it .  I knew I hit rock bottom when I had to resort to fucking WATER and gross-ass MILK.  Oh god, the two worst ""beverages"" on earth.  Cavemen I'm sure drank their piss instead of just plain water--but as I am not a caveman, that was one thing I did not do because today I broke down, walked to Country Markett and bought some Cokey-Cola.

Whoever said that caffeine is a stimulant and a diuretic was not just making up words to look smart.  I am peeing and shaking like an....animal that pees and shakes a lot...?  BUZZ BUZZ says the Yellow Swarm.

BUT if I did have those headphones...oh man...I'd hear that difference I just told you you'd hear if you had them like the sax player did.  Definately.

This paragraph is for Rebecca, who always complains (eh, I tried to come up with a less combatative word than complain, but, you know, the caffiene and the shaking and some maple candy!) that she is not in posts!  She is now.  And she is a little Cutey the Bee!  LOL.  If the complaining did not get her attention, the embarassment will!  Winzorz!

So somehow, they got a truck to come from the future...?  I'm not sure how big business works, but they have time machines!!!!

During load-in, one of the roadies was like, ""BRING UP THE .50!"", and I had crazy flashbacks to the time when I wasn't in WWII.  Nonetheless, they did in fact have a de-milled .50 caliber machine gun as one of the props....at least, I assumed it was de-milled.  Celebrities that love guns and the military probably can pull a few strings...

Anyway, my job was guarding Toby Keith's hallway.  For a country act, he sure had a lot of TRUMPET and TROMBONE players, all of which who were black--doesn't the South hate that stuff still?  (Jazz and blacks, that is.)  And I have never seen so many crazy-ass hats--from pink fuzzy cowboy hats to whatever the hell you call what The Nuge wears.

Yeah, he came in carrying a bow.  I bet he sleeps with one.  It was crazy!  So I told him that his dressing room was down the opposite hallway, and he tanked me, and thus, I met Ted Nugent.  Lol.

Toby Keith never once went into his dressing room, but I did talk to the band quite a bit during the night.  Turns out, musicians download .mp3s just like we do...except on 5,000 dollar laptops and listen to them through $500 dollar headphones.

All night, people--with the proper credentials--kept asking me where Toby Keith's dressing room was.  So I'd direct them down my hall, with the disclaimer, ""He hasn't been there all night"".  Lo and behold, the bar was located in his dressing room.  The sax player drank a whole 5th of JD.  Good times.

Anyway, the concert sucked, I was there for 13 hours, but it was funny when Ted shot a cardboard cutout of Saddam with that bow he was carrying.  I think he even played the solo in Cat Scratch Fever with it."

Not to be confused with Friday, Fryday is what you heathens refer to as 'Monday'--the worst day of all 8 days of the week.  So Monday being so terrible, I cut a deal and obtained a way for my weeks to have two phonetic equivalents of Friday...and 8 days total.  Plays hell with me scheduling, though, as not very many professors grasp how fluid and arbitrary time really is.

Anyway, today was a fucked up Fryday, as I had an exam in my 8 am class which I do not go to unless there is an exam.  So I smoked the hell out of that exam (being the first one finished out of 400 for the third exam in a row) and was like, ""Welp, my next class isn't until 12:40, and I wouldn't normally even be awake for 3 more hours, so what the hell, let's actually go accomplish some things.""

I headed to the Library to tell them I lost a book about rabbits a few months ago--and had renewed online twice as I was looking for it--and that I was ready to pay the piper  so I can register for classes.  Turns out, it showed up as returned sometime, so that's a free 20+ dollars for me!  And to celebrate--French Fries!

But due to that damn exam, I fucked up my timing and I arrived at McDonald's at 10:15 am--WHEN BREAKFAST WAS STILL BEING SERVED.  FUCK.

Such an awesome rallying cry--""Be an agent of change until your first defeat, then just run off somewhere else and start bitching and moaning about problems there until you have to run away again because of some type of setback!""

Hope I don't ever have to rely on you fools in a war.  Oh wait, thousands of servicemen  do right now--sucks to be them.  THEY ARE THE DEAD NOW.

Just wait like 20 years, when all our grandparents and parents are dead or otherwise incapacitated, thereby placing us ""in power"" as the most influential voting bloc, and watch the asinine ways we fuck over our kids and make them all pissed off and whiny and threatening to move to Canada.  Sure, we'll overturn all those silly proposals that don't even really mean anything except that our parents grew up in the 50s and were raised by our grandparents who have a different set of values, but I am sure we'll neglect to legalize the newest 'benign' drug or restrict some type of fun, new, inherently dangerous recreational activity while doing so.   Change takes time--I know we all hate waiting because waiting is for people without the 'right connections', but Rome wasn't built in a day...it was just torn down in one.

"event","JUST like both political parties, I will attempt to make one last ditch effort before Tuesday's election to sway your voting behavior.

UNLESS you have a pressing reason to do so, (i.e. your name is Bush, Kerry, or *shudder* Nader, you own a casino, or you ARE the Michigan Lottery) DO NOT VOTE AT ALL.  I SUPPOSE if your entire identity is tied up in voting, you should go ahead and vote because The Powers have already bent your tiny, tiny mind (and even lesser resolve), to serve them, whether it be 'George W. Douchebag' or 'Old-ass Kerry'.

BUT DO NOT VOTE because it is ""your right to do so"", or because you might get laid for it (ww.votergasm.com) or because, as I have experienced, Christina Aguilera (or another media whore) told you to do so.  

That last clause includes, but is not limited to, both Michael Moore AND Rush Limbaugh--I'm not out here for partisan reasons.  I hate all these manipulative jackasses.  All of American politics is bullshit and the only FEASIBLE way I see to distance myself from it is by ardent non-voting.  ESPECIALLY this election, where the Democratic Party's candidates are nothing more than opposite images of the Republican Party's.

EXAMPLES: The choice of John Edwards as Vice-Presidential candidate.  Young, good-natured, friendly, smiles a bunch.  Everything that is the complete mirror image of Dick Cheney, the Republican Vice-Presidential candidate.

Even the main candidate, John Kerry, is nothing more than a diametrically opposed foil to George W. Bush.  If they ever did coincidentally agree on something in the past, it has been, during the course of election, totally denied, disavowed OR WORSE, time-traveled back and changed to the contrary.

While the candidates should be dissimilar, lest we get Futurama-esque situations like the twins Jack Johnson vs. John Jackson running, they should not disagree on every single issue ever, because most of America is not so polarized.  Or at least, it wasn't.  What this election has visibly accomplished IS that polarization of average America.  Good job guys, way to widen a gulf that you should all be working to close. 

Everyone that is telling you that you should vote isn't doing it for altruistic, pro-freedom, pro-democracy reasons.  They are saying you should vote--with the implied rider, <i>for the candidate that I am supporting/telling you to vote for</i>.  Democratic Stooge Jon Stewart isn't pressing you to vote so you go out and cast a ballot for Dubya, he only wants you to vote for Kerry, and is only pressing you to vote so you do, in fact, vote for Kerry--EVEN IF HE SAYS HE ISN'T.  Three of my non-political science professor this semester have implored my classes to vote, usually qualifying it with the statement that, ""they don't care for whom we vote"" which is completely untrue.  They all have obvious political leanings, as can be inferred by anyone who is not a rock, and want you to vote that way--they are only trying to get votes from the masses because this election is predicted to be close.  Not one person who has intoned that I should vote has ever said, ""you should figure out where you stand on the issues, and where the candidates stand, and then decide who or what to do on Election Day"", they have just ordered me to vote because it is my right to.

If this is truly a free country, with a right to decide one's own destiny, with a right to free speech, and a right to vote, isn't it implied that there is also a right to not vote?  The mindless obsession with basically forcing people to vote because it is their duty is, to me, analogous to the mindless obsession to duty and state that conjures up images of NAZI GERMANY or FACIST ITALY.  YES, I AM COMPARING VOTING TO THE INHUMAN TOTALITARIAN REGIMES EVERYONE LOVES TO INVOKE IN POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS.  If everyone is forced, even if only by social forces, to vote, how is that freedom?  If I have learned anything in my work in the field of Social Psychology, it's that social forces are more powerful than any laws or morals or threats.

If all it takes to be elected is voting for the 'lesser of two evils', all I need to do is wait until someone is running with the position that they will make abortion a felony, homosexuality a capital crime, declare war on Iran, give oil companies control of all finance in the country, and give the Pope senior advisor status, then all I have to do is run on my pro-choice, pro-full legality to gay marriage, pro-secular, and PRO-NUCLEAR BOMBS campaign to get elected, because basically I just described what people who are against Bush describe him as.  AND BECAUSE THEY HATE BUSH SO MUCH THEY WILL ELECT NUCLEAR BOMBS.  It's true, think about it, idiots.  While that may be a tad eXXXtreme of an example, it would not be hard to envision some type of manipulative election like that--OH WAIT, we are in the midst of one right now.  HMMMM, DO I SMELL NUCLEAR WINTER????

WHILE I am not saying that Kerry is pro-Nukes, I am saying that no matter who wins, everyone will be wrong.  If Bush gets re-elected, and something bad happens--even though it is logically BOUND to happen--the Kerryites will blame his 'poor leadership', just like if Gore had been elected, 9/11 would never have happened because of his oh-so-warm and gregarious lack of personality.  If Kerry gets elected, anything bad that happens will be due to 'Bush's Legacy' or, the Bush people will say, because Kerry is 'weak on terror'.  Hey, with that kind of logic, why not just call 9/11 Washington's Legacy because it is his damn fault he helped found this country and was its first President.  Self-fulfilling prophecies and hindsight are the only real winners come November 3rd and NOTHING GOOD WILL COME OF IT.  If everyone does not vote for either two of these jokers maybe Washington would get the point--we are tired of being manipulated into hating our neighbors and fellow countrymen.  At worst, if you don't vote you can always say, ""Hey, I didn't vote for that idiot"" when whatever idiot is elected FUCKS UP BIG TIME.  JUST LIKE PASCAL MIGHT DO.  He's a brilliant guy.  And if that conclusion seems rushed and incomplete, it is because it is.

P. S. Nader is a non-entity.  Hippies suck."

"event","Tuesdays and Thursdays I have Cognitive Psychology with Rosemary Zachs from 10:20 to 11:40.  On this day, 5 October, in 2004, I had a paper due which I worked super long and hard on from  roughly 1:20a-2:00a.

I smartly watched the repeats of Family Guy, Futurama, and Sealab before I decided I had, ""Better get to bed so I can turn in this paper that is like 10% of my grade tomorrow!""

With that, I promptly set my alarm clock for 10:20 am--the time the class is supposed to start.  UH OH.  When it went off at 10:20, I hit snooze twice before realizing, ""HEY!  Class has been going on for 10 minutes already!""  BETTER GET MOVING.

So I showed up at class at around 11:15.  SHORT DAY FOR ME.

If Thirteen Monkeys' Bruce Willis can't figure out time, how the fuck is a mortal like me supposed to?

That Old Navy commercial with the girl who is so excited about the air should annoy the crap out of me, but for some reason I think it is really, really funny.  So much so, in fact, that I actually stopped whatever the hell it was that I was doing to watch it.  The ""trouser atoms"" and ""feel good molecules"" should make the chemist in me roll over in my future grave, but they are so damned cute that, ALAS, I cannot.  I wish I were a feel good molecule.  TO OLD NAVY, AS I MUST BUY THINGS POST-HASTE!

Anyway, I creep into class that is only 25 minutes longer, and go up to the front of the room to put my paper on the giant stack of them that were all turned in already.

The prof. sees this, comes over, and hands it back to me, without missing a beat in her boring ass lecture about boringness.  I find a seat quickly, choosing the front row so it looks like I do not want to further interrupt class--but secretly it's because I am waiting for her to be on the other side of the classroom, looking away, so I can sneak up and turn in my paper.  Eventually, circumstances favor this operation, and I creep up--low to the ground--towards the room.  BUT SHE LOOKS OVER, forcing me to duck behind a podium that is always there, yet never used.  She stops her lecture, and walks over to the podium.  Just as she looks at where I am, I am no longer there--the old Bugs Bunny around the tree gag.  Finally, she catches up to me.

""What's your name?"", she asks.
Uhhhh, uh....Rosemary, ummmm, Zachs....
""....""
....that's your name, isn't it?  Damn it.
""Mm-hmm.  What is it that you think you are doing?""
Uh, I think I dropped a quarter when I came in earlier, at the beginning of class, 10:20.  Oh yeah, there it is (producing a quarter from pocket).  Welp, back to me seat then.
""Yes, I think that's what you should do.""
Oh yeah, I knocked this paper off of the pile of papers that aren't really that close to me.  I'll just put it back (inserting paper into middle of stack) for you.
""LEAVE!""

So I left.  But mission accomplished!

But of course it didn't really happen that way.  Life is boring.  That was my plan for if she didn't just let me turn in my paper 55 minutes late, which is what she did do.  ""The best laid schemes o' mice an' men gang aft a-gley.""  Using her name as my name was going to be my coup de grace to not get me dropped from the class because it is crazie funny.  McBAH.

I may be an Ewok for Halloween, only because they are able to defeat giant future-metal machines with rocks and sticks--and they aren't even wizards!  HOW IN THE HELL?!  Ewok vs. Terminator = EWOK WINS."

"event","I was walking around Ann Arbor last Friday with Rebecca, when we passed some dude and she was like, ""Damn those Jews for Jesus"".

...about two hours later I was like, ""JEWS FOR JESUS??  WHAT THE FUCK?!"", as it took my mind that long to fully process the idiocy contained therein. 

I do believe the rift between the Jews and the CHRISTians is the Jews think Jesus is a sonofaslutbitchwhore.  Rebecca, raised in the Jewish faith, had this to say, ""Jews are raised to SAY that, 'Jesus was a great Rabbi, but not the son of God', but to BELIEVE that he was NOTHING AT ALL.  He's like fucking Alfred McAllister.  Who the fuck is that?  EXACTLY.  JEWS FOR JESUS--YOU HAVE BEEN OFFICIALLY SMOKED.

Since Jews for Jesus isn't a logical fallacy or STUPID ASS WASTE OF TIME, I invite you all to join my new associations to better the world: Gypsies for Nazis, Republicans for the Downtrodden Negro, Vegetarians for Medium Rare--but Slightly More Rare Than Medium, and Robots for Not Eradicating Humanity.

So Ann Arbor seems to be about 83% JACKASSES, as later that day we also passed some people wearing ""STOP SHOOTING DOVES"" t-shirts.  Is this really a problem?  I mean if they were going extinct from all the shooting or something, maybe I might be, ""OK, fair enough, Dove Persons"", but I see doves all the time....FROM THE OTHER END OF A GUNBARREL.

But seriously, I spent half my summer in PINCONNING, HICKVILLE CENTRAL, and I did not hear, nor see, any evidence of doves being unnecessarily slaughtered anywhere.  And these people keep BROKEN DOWN REFRIGERATORS IN THEIR YARDS.  It's a primitive culture in those parts.

If doves are honestly in trouble of making it to the next Ark, I think that 'STOP FUCKING LANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY GOD-DAMNED VEHICLE, DOVES' shirts are far more appropriate.  I fucking kicked one in the head the other day because it landed RIGHT WHERE I WAS PEDALING MY BIKE.  IDIOTS.  Everyone just needs to sign my ""Teach the Doves English"" petition, pay 25 bucks for a shirt, and get my newsletter bimonthly on our progress.

...unless they are talking about the ""Best Band Ever""--The Doves.  In that case, secrecy essential to mission--elimanate the shitty musical act.  THEY SUCK ASS."

"event","So Gwyneth, star of Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow (opening today), named her kid Apple.

And in an interview when asked about her real ""world of tomorrow"", she was quoted as saying, ""Perhaps I'll have a whole orchard"".  

HAHAHAHAHA, FUNNY GIRL!  WAY TO DOOM YOUR CHILD TO BE MOCKED FROM GRADES K-12.

I don't care how famous you are, don't fucking name your kids bullshit that will eventually cause them to develop huge complexes from the constant TAUNTING they will receive at the hands of their peers.  I barely got through school with the innocuous name Tyler, because it means just what it sounds like, 'maker of tiles'...AND ALL BATHROOMS ARE TILED, SO OBVIOUSLY I LOVE TO EAT SHIT.  Fucking kids.

Oh, but maybe the other private schooled celebrity children with fuckhead names like A Knight's Tale's Shannyn Sossamon's kid AUDIO SCIENCE or even Chasing Amy's Jason Lee's offspring PILOT INSPEKTOR won't give a fuck.  THESE ARE REAL NAMES.  Fucking Jason Lee, not even a real actor, thought he might not be a giant DOUCHEBAG, was I proven wrong.  God-damned asshole celebrities, so removed from real-life that they think they can get away with naming their children like they are Mega Man bosses...AND DO.  Why doesn't al-Queda get on the ball and start hugging-with-bombs-strapped-to-chest these bastards South Park movie style, so then America will really cry and elect John Kerry so we will cower and quiver in the face of the enemy so they stop killing our precious movie stars, so they start killing more movie stars so we give into more of their demands instead of re-reelecting Bush so we can continue bombing the fuck out of things and making The Terrorists more angry so they kill more movie stars...and thus begins the FBI's surveillance of me.  But please, just the idiot celebrities, Ahmed...don't you fucking touch Sir Sean.  HE'S JAMES-FUCKING-BOND, HE'LL TEAR YOUR SHIT UP.

The other day I called Joel a 'Hufflepuff', and I have to apologize for that, because that is probably one of the meanest things you could ever say to someone that is also over 20 years of age and a Harry Potter reader.

Hufflepuff is like CMU--they'll take any bastard, in fact, they thrive on taking the skill-less, the outcast, and the absolute dregs.  (HA.)  Ravenclaw is for the smart kids, Slytherin for the badasses, Gryffindor for the noble and brave, so I imagine Hufflepuff to be all fat, socially awkward kids and maybe a retarded kid or three...because fat kids can't be smart, badasses, noble, or brave.  THE FAT CHOKES OFF ALL THOSE TRAITS.  It's true, ask Covieo.  

How much would that suck ASS?  You're sitting there thinking to yourself, ""I am pretty bright, noble, and willing to do anything to rise above the pack"", and then the Sorting Hat comes on and yells out, ""Hufflepuff!""...meaning you're not really that smart, brave, or badass...you're just mediocre, at best.  The suicide rate of Hufflepuff should be staggeringly high, but I'm sure it ain't too bad as those kids are so good lying to themselves that they'll figure out a way to deal with being in the Loser House.  Or die trying.

I may have a drinking problem.

The seven days before class (""Welcome Week""), I was drunk as hell.  On the third day of class He rested because, as I mentioned earlier, I was sick as hell.  I thought I had the strep throat or maybe the throat Ebola.

But yesterday (""Thirsty Thursday) I had a bunch of vodka and my throat felt like Dracula was coming over tonight and he's looking for me, aka cat o nine tails in the esophagus.  The thing welcome week and last night had in common was a fifth of vodka.  Which poses a problem to me, a budding psychologist.  You see, sobriety is the least fun state of consciousness and without the ability to drink vodka, I will have to spend large tracts of time in said state, which will eventually lead to the deaths of innocents not seen since I last ""got on the wagon"" aka World War II, The Great War.  What does that all mean?  Not much (due to the gibberish), except that I am sober.

End result?  To the pillbox, lads!

Update on crazie Abnormal Psychology prof.: Today he was talking about a case history from his career.  The patient was beating up his girlfriend because she was 'immoral', in this case, as the prof. put it, by ""performing fellatio on him"".  Some dumbass was heard in the back of the class to say, ""what is that?"".  The prof. replies, ""well, I try to talk straight with my patients, but this is a college course and I try to be professional, but you know, she sucked his cock.""

TOO GOOD.

Oh, by the way, everything I said about CMU accepting anyone?  Double that for MSU, with the additional requirement of being able to drink a case of beer and/or be blonde and hot.  IDIOTS.  Who doesn't know what fellatio means?!"

"event","Mr. Dave Chappelle stood up to a sold-out crowd at the Breslin Center Friday night.  I was working the gates, meaning that most of the concession staff had a better view of the show than I did.  Not that seeing a comedian is the most important part, unless he's doing pratfalls or pie gags, and I don't think Dave Chappelle does that kind of comedy.

...OR DOES HE?  I don't fucking know, I couldn't see a god-damned thing.

There was a no-camera policy that night, and everyone brought a camera.  Since no one wanted to walk back to their car, they all had to get it checked at guest services.  This one girl didn't want the hassle of either option, so she and her boyfriend decided to just use up the roll of film there at the gates.

Did I say boyfriend?  Because I meant PIMP.  I cannot describe to you the 'clothes' this girl was wearing without this journal becoming a tawdry rag, and I have standards, but suffice it to say that she was definately a strippertute, that is, both a stripper and a prostitute.  The pictures they took were friggin softcore porn--all the dudes outside having a smoke were like, ""WHA?  Smoking does kill, because I am dead from a heart attack due to the shock of seeing a striptease in the Breslin while having a smoke!""

At the end of the show, Dave called up some random joket to tell the crowd a story.  It was some random bullshit that I wasn't really paying attention to until he got to the end of it and said, ""I'm Rick James, bitch!"".  WHAT A DUMBASS.  Chappelle just sighed.

I am pretty sure Dave didn't say that all that night out of respect for Rick James WHO IS DEAD NOW.  God damn idiot kid.  If Mr. Chappelle had brought people, I bet he would have had that kid roughed up in the parking lot by them.  But he didn't, so they didn't.

A-Jizzle smoked on down that same night with his roommates, all clad in CMU shirts.  Walking down Grand River that night and campus the next day proved to me, once again, that MSU students LOVE CMU.  And David Hasselhoff.

I rode my bike to work.  When I met up with all of them they were walking.  Biking at the slowness of Monty's walking = me stumbling off my bike and losing my bike lock, which I didn't realize until I tried locking up my bike, which sucked ass.

So Bunsy and I went to Meijer Sunday to try to buy a bike lock.  I emphasize try, because they were all sold out.  

All.  Sold.  Out.

Meijer, why hast thou forsaken me?  Seriously, I don't know if I can ever trust Meijer again...a simple thing like a bike lock, can't keep it on the shelf--in a college town?  That won't be good for business.

BUT I decided to walk home from class yesterday, and as I passed the QD, I found my damn bike lock in some shrubs.  Hell yeah, it is like free money because those damn bike locks are like 20 bucks.

So I bought a 5th of booze."

So I was reading the back of the hand soap the other day and it said, in <b>BOLD</b> letters, ""keep out of reach of children, unless under adult supervision"".  What the fuck?  Out of all humans, shouldn't the kids--the ones out poking dead birds and digging for insects all day--be the ones using the soap?

But then I noticed how much it looked like berry fruit-on-the-bottom yogurt (once you have made the fruit-on-the-bottom fruit-dispersed-throughout), and I started thinking about how good yogurt is.

Well, the end of the story is I ate a bunch of the hand soap and Maxson knows all about FRUITS ON THE BOTTOM.  Fuck.  Kids, stay away.

Rabbits love yogurt.  I thought Bunny was sick, but he wasn't--my family was just giving him too many treats when I wasn't looking.  Now he gets yogurt, sparingly, on the vet's advice.  Also keep bunnies away from hand soap without supervision.

I like my Presidents of the United States of America crazy as hell.  So in an effort to keep the spirits of Nixon, Teddy and Franklin D. alive, this Fall I am friggin casting my vote for George W. Bush.  Word on the street is if he gets re-elected we go into Iran.  HELLS BELLS YEAH!  FIRE UP LUDICRISOCRACY!

Now before any of you get all, ""Blah blah blah, how can you vote for a known and proven idiot,"" and shit, remember this: I am not registered to vote and probably never will be unless I myself am running for President....or Arnold Schwarzenegger is.

CYBORGS RULE THE EARTH!!!!

So I have already missed 6 classes, mainly due to illness, as I was already sick as hell once this semester.  Luckily, it was 'Syllabus Week', meaning no one did jack shit.

....OR DID THEY?  I totally missed an in-class writing assignment in my PSY 235 class, which means I lost out on like .005% of my overall grade.  HORRORS.  First week of class, my ass.

Since you all go to MSU and care, I am going to talk about PSY 280, Abnormal Psychology, a bit.  The professor of this class is Dr. Bertram Karon but it might as well be Dr. BADASS MCGEE, as that is far more fitting, even though Betram is a kickass name.  B-dawg was dropping f-bombs all over today, in between which he told the entire class, ""if you are stressed out about this class, just think about me dying,"" and then gave us like 4 crazie examples if we couldn't come up with our own, such as his being hit by a car as he left class or a disgruntled student coming in and ""testing out his gun.""  He also smoked the hell out of religion and then was like, 'no no, I kid I kid....but seriously, I only teach the truth in here.'  SORRY GOD.

Speaking of crazie, I guess it is a clinical term, since he used it about 50 times in our first lecture.  He also mentioned chopping people up and putting them into a Christmas pie TWICE in one class period.  AMAZING.

In the rare instance that it is just an innocent hypothetical question, always pick deaf, as BEING BLIND SUCKS ASS.  I had to go get a simple eye checkup a few weeks ago, was supposed to be no big whoop, but due to my semi-serious eye injury from hockey a few summers ago, turned out to be a 40,000 drop affair...with one of those
sets of drops suspiciously looking like GIANT SYRINGES.  So seeing for the next day-and-a-half = NEGATIVE.

Now, you may be saying, ""One day, Tyler?  ASSHOLE.""  FUCK YOU.  IT SUCKED BALLS.  Sure you can listen to a CD, but without BRAILLE ON THE ALBUMS, you're as likely to grab Kenny G as you are the Tenacious D.  LIKE I DID.  AURAL TORTURE RESUMES....NOW.  And shutting off the infernal device?  Not so easy when you can't see any of the damned tiny-ass buttons.  I couldn't drive, so I missed work and I could listen to the jackasses on the TV, but that is no good.  I'VE GOTTA SEE TITS, MAN.  I tried going up to some girl and being like, ""I am blind, I need to read your shirt, let me use the braille popping out there"", but it wasn't braille, so jail was fun.

The end of the story is I got new glasses and I most likely will develop glaucoma, unless I die before that.

So in my Community Psychology class the prof. was like, ""Hey!  Being active in the community and helping it to address issues such as teen pregnancy or underage drinking is so much fun, you all get to do a group presentation on how you would execute such a program for 40% of your grade!!""

CHANGE IT UP

So thanks to that jackass, I have a Friday class now.  And I am pretty sure the whole incident has now soured me on ever contributing anything to my community, ever.  EXCEPT FOR MAYBE A HAILSTORM OF SEARING HOT HOLLOW POINTS.

Nah, I kid.  If it weren't for community-based help programs, how else would AJ and Swami ever be able to get the help they need when they finally realize they both do, in fact, HAVE HUGE GAMBLING PROBLEMS.  Nah, I kid again.  If I lived in Mt. Pleasant...blucka down those student loans!

ON THE OTHER HAND, you have the left lane, which is conveniently located an arm-length's away from a cement divider whose only purpose (seemingly) is to put your engine block through your chest as you attempt to escape the rumble strip and the Fallen One's summons.

Helping out your night drive back home on the highway is all the oncoming traffic.  There's a reason you don't stare directly into the sun anytime, anywhere, for any reason--because a bright lights blind you.  So how about 1,000 bright lights streaming at you in the inky blackness of night?  DON'T MIND IF I DO

Fucking idiot bikers.  I'm always caught behind one of them and I know one of these days one is going to lose control in front of me and the van's gonna pop his melon like a friggin pimple.  And then I'll get delayed for like 2 hours and the van is white so it will be stained all red and shit with brain matter and blood and I am SO PISSED OFF ABOUT IT ALREADY.  FUCK YOU HARLEY DAVIDSON.  FUCK.

FUCKING FUCK YOU TOO, MACKINAC ISLAND

First of all, fudge SUCKS ASS.

Secondly, horse shit smells like SHIT.

But most of all, you wouldn't let me fucking inline skate except in a tiny designated areas, forcing me to walk around the horseshit infested ASSland in my socks.  WHITE SOCKS, MIND YOU.  I CAN SKATE BETTER THAN HALF OF THOSE BEHEMOTHS YOU CALL TOURISTS CAN RIDE A BIKE and yet you let them go willy-nilly, helter-skelter about the joint with reckless abandon and I wish I could think of another redundant phrase because I don't think I got the point across yet!  FUCK.  I almost got killed by two stupid jackass girls on a tandem bike, while their fathers sat back and laughed, ""ha ha ha, we raised dickless cuntsack daughters that have no motor skills, which caused them to almost kill THE GREATEST INLINE SKATER IN THE WORLD, Ha ha.""  FUCKSTICKS.  C BOMBS ALL DAY I HATE TANDEM BIKES

Chino Captain Ron may be manning the N-Bomb bay doors, so I guess I'll just take command of the C-raygun.  CUNT-CUNT-CUNTY-CUNT (that is the sound the c-raygun makes).  Everyone needs a hobby?

Today at work at lunch I put forth the idea that The Law should just put Terry Nichols in some building that is due to be imploded and let The Fates do their thing(s?).  Not because I like the death penalty, or hate Terry Nichols, I just love irony.  And death.  And hating Terry Nichols?  Either way you slice it, it's delicious!"

"event","On M-13 is a billboard that single billboardedly finalized who will be receiving my coveted--and necessary--vote in this fall's presidential election.  The billboard states simply, ""Vote Jesus: Write Him in This Fall"".

If there is any way of smoking that bastard out, it's by making him President of the United States of America, and some tell me, of the entire Free World...unless he decides to go and get himself nailed to a tree again.  You know that old chestnut, 'when the going gets tough, shirk responsibility and get nailed to a tree' (Psalms 181).

SECOND COMING, HERE WE COME!

I saw Spider-Man 2 a few weekends ago, and it was pretty awesome, except for all the random made-up talk about SCIENCE and COMPUTERS.

The thing about Otto Octavius is this: if you live in a reality where superheroes with superpowers exist and your last name is all silly sounding like Otto OCTavius, you should probably think twice about creating four artificially intelligent mechanical arms that attach to your spine, thereby giving you an OCTET of appendages.  And even if you want to become a supervillian so badly that you throw caution to the wind and create said AI Mecharms, at least create a backup system to the crucially important 'inhibitor chip' that keeps the arms from infiltrating your mind.  Just so it doesn't look so BLATANTLY OBVIOUS THAT YOU WANTED TO BE A SUPERVILLIAN.  Idiot.

Thanks to a brilliant 'radio time share' system we use at work, I get to listen to Rush (think Oxycontin fatass, not Tom Sawyer), Bill O'Reilly and country more often than the Surgeon General has deemed safe.  However, if I had a radio show, I would pattern it after Bill O'Reilly's:

Bill: Ramble ramble froth ramble, we'll take a caller
Caller calling in: I am your biggest fan, I love your show, I agree with everyth...
Bill: (INTERRUPTING) NO NO NO YOU ARE WRONG I AM RIGHT, TANGENT, TANGENT, FORGET TO SAY GOODBYE TO CALLER WHO I INTERRUPTED ANYWAY, COMMERCIAL, NO SPIN, YELL

I can interrupt and yell at people with the best of them, why don't I have a talk show on 790?  MAURER CONSPIRACY

But I've got to tell ya, the radio does have it's good points.  Such as 'Uncle Dave' from whatever the fuck place he sells motorcycles from.  Even after hearing his commercials 12 times a day for the last month and a half, I could not tell you what the fuck his damn store is called because his command of the English language rivals that of Colin Quinn's in the category of NOT ACTUALLY BEING ENGLISH AT ALL.  ""You mean I have to pick between Uncle Dave or Rosie Perez to read this bomb-dismantling handbook out loud to me or we all die?!  I CHOOSE YOU, ROSIE-CHU.""

Went to the casino Wednesday and took down 220 bluckas.  I can cut that room up like it were paper made of warm butter.  BUT the bad news is I had to spend The Sacagawea Dollar in order to stave off heat stroke and, most likely, death.  So I guess I get ground up into taco meat and eaten or whatever the fuck I said would happen to whomever spend the damn thing.  I WAS GOING TO DIE.

HEY ASSHOLES.  Just because you have 12 acres of property doesn't mean you should keep EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER OWNED ON IT.  Fucking everyone 'up north' has a hugeass woodlot with like 22 cars, 3 sinks, a washer, 2 campers, and 1 rusted out boat in it.   WHY WHY WHY WHY.  The boat will rust just as well in an ACTUAL JUNKYARD, MOVE IT OFF YOUR PLACE, TOILET FACE.  Other Bangor kids were always making fun of Pinconning kids, calling them hicks and whatnot, and I always thought, 'Hey, they aren't all hicks, they are probably cool people up north'.  Never have I been more wrong.  SWEET JESUS ARE THEY ALL FUCKING HICKS AND TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE HUMAN BEINGS.  If you value your dignity and don't want fucking tetanus, do not travel north of, oh, let's say: WHEELER ROAD.

Welp, I am going to be up in the Mackinaw area for the weekend, so I won't be able to post until I get back--not that I do anyway.  Blucka."

I started work at Mosquito Control, finally, and I just realized one of the main components of this job is one of the things that I am the worst at: NOT GETTING LOST.  ""It's north of townline 16"", ""Go check out this 10 acre woodlot"", ""Take Beaver Road to Mackinaw"".  I LOSE.  I can barely get anywhere in Bangor Township without having to call SwamDog or EF for help, and now I'm out in fucking Garfield and Frasier--I THOUGHT THOSE WERE TV SHOWS.

Score thus far:
woodlots I have gotten lost in = 2
clearly marker roads/houses I have driven by = 22+
stop signs ran = 0
times I have laughed at Flajole Road's name: a billion
how much I hate Wade Duck: ALSO A BILLION

Mosquito bite tracking system: neck, right little finger, top of head, EYELID (what the fuck man?!)

I got back into the Bay City and all the fucking radio stations were fucked up big time.  100.5 went from whatever the hell you call that format (shit) to the first all-disco station since 1973.  97.3 is now some crazieass station that plays Guns N' Roses, Duran Duran, ENYA, and Eiffel 65, all in the same half hour.  I have termed it 'schizo rock favourites' because it has more personalities than Robin Williams dating Anne Heche or something.  I haven't heard that much Journey played since I went to Steve Perry's Journey Ultimate Fan Club Meeting.  Don't stop believing....that you are a good band.  

If you were a psychologist, you would know that Multiple Personality Disorder and Schizophrenia are two distinct maladies and that Hollywood and the idiot General Public have somehow made the two synonymous.  And, come fall, I may just be the meddling psych student to tell you something like that.  That is correct, I may be kicking carbon chains to the curb and buddying up to bipolars instead!  Both subjects are my favorite, but which one shall prevail in this battle to the death?  Perhaps I should just join a convent?

The Sacagewea dollar has not left my possession because we haven't been playing cards at all.  Or have we?  MC, EF and I busted out the Magic: The Gathering decks to try to reclaim our respective lost childhoods.  Is it working?  Or were those very childhoods lost BECAUSE we played Magic: The Gathering back then?  Many questions, no answers, and I spent 50+ dollars on new cards.  How in the hell?  Fuck you, M:TG.

I went to the Sage Library (aka The Bay City Mall) and reserved myself their copy of Watership Down, depriving some idiot high schooler from crossing that one off of their summer reading list.  Good job me, for still looking like I am a high schooler.  Accolades also given to Watership Down for being an epic tale about BUNNIES.  BUNNIES ALL DAY, ALL IN.

Becky got herself a little baby Holland Lop to add to our family!  He is all black and named Lop, and he is super cute, and I think Bunny wants to eat/mount him.  It is all very confusing.  I was also at some random house in Frasier Township and there was a rabbit in the yard, so I went over to it and it was a white, brown, and black adult Holland Lop just chilling there in the yard, chewing on grass!  He was cool and I petted him.  I wanted to take him home, but the Mosquito Controllers do not like rabbits in their trucks.  I was sad.  But I have a rabbit, so I am happy.  He is cute and brown, and someday I will take pictures of him for you.  Rexes are not cute bunnies.  But Netherland dwarfs are!  I am sorry if you have a Rex and you are sad that I just said they are not cute.  They are still rabbits, so that means they are cute after all.

I finally saw Return of the King t'other night...what the fuck, Oscar giving dudes?  While an entertaining yarn, it was no 42 Oscar winner.  And the theory that those Oscars were awarded as a way of honoring all three is bullshit because they weren't that good overall anyway.  BUT IT DOES NOT MATTER, because I do not work at a movie theater anymore and have no reason to argue about things like that.

There is a Kosher beer called <a href=""http://www.shmaltz.com/"">He'Brew</a> and I was told its slogan is ""Jesus Christ, that's good!"", but I cannot find evidence of that on the website.  Damn.  Either way, it is funny times!

In July VH-1 will premiere I LOVE THE 90s.  Finally, no more pretending I know what the are talking about when they refer to something, as now I'll be able to relive the awesomeness that was the remakes, sequels, PREquels, 'inspired bys' or returns of those kitschy things from the 70s and 80s!  And I'll be able to reuse all my grunge jokes!   Thank you, VH-1!

Throughout the summer, all of you readers out there under the rainbow in Readerland will be able to track her fortunes, and thus mine own.

So all of you that play poker with me, if you win the dollar from someone who isn't me (since if you won it from me, I would know already fool), let me know.  It may be a fun thing to do it may not.  I am certain I will stop it as soon as one of you assholes spends it on a taco.  Asshole.

A prison in Oregon, to stimulate 'good behavior', has an awards system in which one of the rewards an inmate can receive is, ""A spanking new flat-screen TV"" for their cell.  Spanking indeed--those lucky inmates who curb the urge to throw food in the cafeteria or hide Jimmy's cards will now be able to whack off to Avril Lavigne videos, a luxury I myself can barely afford.  Says Nicolas Krahmer, serving time for assault with a knife and lucky recipient of one of the TVs, 'I've never seen an episode of 'Survivor.' I'm eager to watch that. I want to see what my family watches.'

GOOD JOB PRISON, LET KNIFEY MCKNIFERSON WATCH ANGER INDUCING SURVIVOR.  HOMICIDES PREDICTED?  1000 IF HE DOESN'T KILL HIMSELF FIRST.  Whatever happens, what he said was one of the funniest quotes ever.  Oh those failures of society!

Krahmer = 1, other inmates stabbing each other with shivs or their penises = 0.  Or 10, from a certain point of view.

It is packing time here at 432 West Owen Graduate Hall, as I am sure it is for many other colleges.  Because I am limiting myself to two boxes, as that is all I have and as I am too lazy to find more, I have had to come up with some 'creative' ways to get all my crazie crap stuffed in there...ways I am about to share with you now, young padawan.

For those of you who, like me, have accumulated numerous bottles of booze and various pills, set aside one day to drink and eat all of the booze and pills, preferably a day where you do not have an exam that will require you to read, write, express any accumulated knowledge or not hallucinate and/or collapse and have to be resuscitated by EMTs.  This will lighten your load considerably, and at a profit of .10 cents per bottle.  (For those of you interested, this day for me will be Wednesday.)

Donate dirty clothes to the less fortunate students.  They will often be too shy to identify themselves, so use these handy tips within tips to figure out who to give them to.
Step 1) Look in a mirror and memorize your face
Step 2) Give clothes to anyone with darker skin than you.  Sometimes you will be tricked by idiots who think they are surfers and tan every other day, but it is okay--they will probably try to eat the clothes and then die.

Not taking dirty clothes back seriously removes the packing weight--and makes you feel good for giving back to the community!

You can also tell your floormates/suitemates you have contracted cancer and that your bones are too weak to do any lifting, thereby getting them to do all moving/packing for you.  You will never be seeing them again--if you are smart it--and even so, faking your death costs just pennies on the dollar.  A massive return!

Hopefully that will help you out.  I may come up with more hints, I probably won't.  Either way, the next hints will be Members Only, so sign up now!  I also have private vids for sale!

I would have done an 'end of semester recap' like Joel did, but I did not go to class ever, and who wants to hear about other people's classes at different schools anyway?  Welp, sucks to be cute girls that wanted to be hit on by me....by which I mean Rebecca, who does not even go to my school, so everyone wins...?

All you damn idiots who are SO SURPRISED AND SHOCKED by the snow in April and are angry or bitching about it are henceforth not allowed to complain about the heat or humidity this summer, nor shall you ever ski, sled, or participate in any winter activity for the duration of history. 

Penalty for disobeying this decree--being dipped in liquid nitrogen, then thrown into an active volcano then, finally, having the sludge that once was you launched into space where the mean old atmosphere does not exist so the nasty little weather will never bother you again.

My decrees are law...or they will be.  Better start practicing now, just in case, eh?"

But which are cuter, the Bunnies or the Chicks, as I will only eat the cutest of foods.  (Or anything free.)  The Chicks, being the original, have the most craftsmanship of the two, but one cannot deny the sheer cuteyosity of a marshmallow rabbit.  I suppose it doesn't matter either way, because I just end up naming them all and not eating them because I belong to PETASC--People for the Ethical Treatment of Animal Shaped Candies.  And I'm schizophrenic.  SAVE A PEEP, EAT A PEZ.

TGIF is advertising new 'Shrimp Flavors'. Orange Peel, Cajun and...Sizzling.  Last time I checked, sizzling was not a fucking flavor.  You know how I know this?  I'm not a dumbass 5-year old, the only age at which one might think a sensation is a flavour.

""Mommy, Mommy, that tastes sizzling!""  So will this vicious backhand, son.  You'll never make it in this world with a mind of mush like that.  UNLESS YOU WRITE COPY FOR TGIF RESTAURANTS!  Because soda tastes bubbly and chicken tastes pink, right?  Idiots.

T'other day I had the pleasure of watching The Dawson and Kelso pretend they aren't pansy-ass pretty boy model shitheads in the cinematic gem Texas Rangers.

For those of you who were unaware, as I was, Texas Rangers is the worst movie ever not involving the words Dude, Where's, My or Car.  OH HO--Kelso is in both, surprise surprise.  You should all watch this movie, if only to observe what NOT to do if you, by some quirk of fate, are suddenly an actor.  A good example: do not sign onto movies that Kelso has looked at, thought were within his 'range' and was subsequently actually HIRED to appear in.

I did happen to catch Kelso in the Butterfly Effect and...NEGATIVE.  APRIL 14th FOOLS, CHUMPS.

The movie does make you hate Mexicans, though.  Or, as the movie calls them, 'bandits'--so as not to offend.  But we all damn know they are damn Mexicans, and we all damn know they are damn cattle-thieving damn subhumans.  YOU DAMN HEARD ME MOLINA.  GIVE ME BACK MY DAMN BEEVES.

In the Nordic tradition, I long for a glorious death in battle.  Like Paula Cole sang, WHERE HAVE ALL THE BATTLES GONE?  Everyone hates battling, but they love swishy-ass pirates.  OR IS THAT SWISHY ASS-PIRATES?!  Also, the Jim Carrey vehicle The Mask offends me religiously--if Loki was acting up and shit, Odin wouldn't fucking trap him in a stupid wooden mask, he'd cleave him in two with his mighty axe or tempered broadsword (OR BOTH?!?!?!) and eat his insides from the inside out.  FUCK YOU THE MASK AND FUCK YOUR STUPID ASS SEQUEL THAT IS COMING OUT THIS SUMMER, I THINK.

To reply to an unasked question, no Virginia, there aren't ghosts.  I must concur with the Captain (and quote a certain Mr. Jerry Seinfeld) when I respectfully say, ""What are you, an idiot?""  God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit in Combined Mode rode down to me on Ganesha's back with a letter handwritten by Zeus (who had borrowed Buddha's pen to write it) that said: GHOSTS ARE FAKE, READ A BOOK.  I may have been firing up the Stacker 3's and the Flying V's when this happened, though.  Threes and V's....an interesting concept....any callers?

Is that Snoop Dogg in a video game?!  Or am I a racist and think all black men look like the Snoop DO-double-G??  VOTING ENABLED.  But don't fret: I think Luigi/Link, Ritz/Townhouse and  Robocop/Mega Man are the same people, too.  Because they are crackers and robots, which I hate.  RITZ CRACKERS?   GET IT?  HA HA!  Shut the fuck up, Rodney.

I've been hearing a lot about how Liz Phair's new album 'sucks' because she 'sold out'.  Which is bullshit.  I am pretty sure 'selling out' isn't even a real concept--it's just something people make up when a band doesn't make the exact same record again.  If after I was elected President of the World, I made some comment in the press about how my favorite color is green--when I had repeatedly told people it was blue when I was just the lowly Secretary of the Universe--is that me selling out?  To people that identified with me and the color blue, yes.  Fuckers.  The only people that do the exact same thing for their entire life are either robots or liars lying about it.  Everyone changes their minds.  If you're a real fan of the artist, you'll be happy that they are having fun and putting out new stuff instead of getting all mopey and lame and shooting themselves in the face like some other jackasses I've heard of.  (Everyone knows Cobain did the ol' Shotgun Funeral because he wanted to cut an album of showtunes covers, but his fanbase would lynch him if he did because they are all idiots.)  If you don't like your 'favorite' band's newest release, don't tell people they 'sold out'.  That just makes you sound like an asshole.  YOU CAN'T RELEASE THE SAME RECORD TWICE, PEOPLE CATCH ONTO THAT SHIT, RIGHT MANDY MOORE?

If you check out my friends list, you'll see that I am the friend of both the <lj user=""bunnyowners""> and the mysterious <lj user=""stfu_fatty"">.  The former are those individuals who own rabbits while the latter loves to eat animals.  Whoever runs that thought it might be witty of them to put all the bunnyowners on his friend list, along with some of the vegan groups, presumably so they would get pissed off.

HE LOSES.  Everyone fucking knows I LOVE TO EAT ANIMALS.  I tried to sue Pizza Hut over their meat lover pizza because there were only 3 animals on it--MEAT LOVER, BY DEFINITION, REQUIRES AT LEAST 6 ANIMALS.  LOOK IT UP.

Whoever it is gets 35 points for pissing off a bunch of idiot vegans, but loses about 1,000 because it isn't nearly as funny as I bet they and their friends think it is.  Overall score: NOT A WINNER

If Britney Spears wants to glamorize suicide/commit suicide herself, I am all for it.  Why is there even a controversy?!  If a bunch of dumbass chumps see that video and wants to fire up bloody baths, the gene pool doesn't need such mindless zombie bastards anyway.  Or dies it?  IF ALL THE EASILY MANIPULATED SIMPLETONS ARE DEAD BECAUSE OF BRITNEY SPEARS, WHO WILL FORM MY DREAD ARMY OF DESPAIR TO RULE THE COSMOS WITH?!

Damn you Britney Spears, you just put my schemes back a WHOLE GENERATION.  FUCK.  

I haven't seen Kill Bill, Vol. 2.  I haven't seen Kill Bill, Vol. 1.  There's a reason for this, it goes along the lines of...Quentin Tarantino is an idiot.  If I wanted to watch a movie which is nothing more than a masturbatory amalgam of the writer/director's boyhood cinematic fetishes, I'd watch Indiana Jones or Star Wars.  I get Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction confused all the time since they are THE SAME MOVIE.  I haven't seen two more similar movies since ASHLEY JUDD'S ENTIRE ACTING CAREER.

Was James Dean a badass, or did he just play one on the screen?  ANYONE THAT IDOLIZES JAMES DEAN SHOULD SUFFER THE SAME UNTIMELY DEATH FOR BEING A STUPID-ASS TOOL.  If Mr. Dean hadn't died, ten to one says he'd be doing appearances in Scooby Doo cartoons, alongside the Addams' and the Globetrotters.  How the fuck do those kids run into the Globetrotters EVERY THIRD DAY?!  I don't see the same 5 people when I go to class twice a week.  That may be because I go to the wrong classes but....oh well.  Any 'star' that dies young is not BRILLIANT--first of all, they DIED YOUNG, like a fuckhead moron chump.  Secondly, an early death means they just didn't get the chance to do a bunch of shitty movies, guest appearances on Hollywood Squares and voiceovers for Disney cartoons.  I know you're listening, Brandon Lee...

SPEAKING OF THE CROW, what a shitty movie.  I can't believe anyone counts this among their favorites--oh wait, yes I do.  It's one of those 'identity movies'--the kind that people say are their favorite not because they actually like it, but because it fits with whatever they happen to be saying their identity is on that given day."

The rap music is not my favorite scent of spice.  Yet, I cannot deny the power of the current radio and MTV favorite, D12's ""My Band"".  The video is even better.  TOO FUNNY.  You have to see it, I said so, and I am a Golden God because....

I won the 20 person buy-in last night at Lipinski's.  +70 dollars of commerce.   Dirty  is all-in?  I'll call that with my AJ offsuit.  UH OH.  His pocket fives make 2 pair (88) on the flop.  SHIT, another 8 on the turn!  TOOT TOOT.  I lose to the boat....BUT  WHAT IS THAT YOU SAY????  8 on the river?!  Quad 8s on the board so my ace kicker wins?  DON'T MIND IF I DO.  Fortune smiles upon thee, thou hast found a torch.  

LATER THAT NIGHT....

Flop is 3,10, Q or something.  I have A3--low pair?  ALL IN.  Dirty = CALL.  He has a ten: looking dire for me again, except A on turn AND A on river.  Someone call the Coast Guard because there're boats all over this river.  Shit, dawg.

I was listening to my new favorite band The Polyphonic Spree and I think one of the reasons I like them so much is because a few of their songs (Section 4 La La and Section 10 A Long Day) remind me of music from Earthbound, the 3rd best video game ever.  Somehow, it did not fucking make 1st round in <a href = ""http://archive.gamespy.com/titlefight/"">Gamespy's fucking Title Fight thing</a>.  A grievous affront and stupid as hell to boot.  Who'd rather play some god-awful mess like Halo instead of SMAAAASHing Starmen with Poo?  NOT I, and, as mentioned earlier, I am a Golden God.

Claims to divinity, eh?  Why the hell not?  Jesus, Muhammad, Moses and a bunch of other jerks--they were all just dudes.  Or schizophrenics.  OR BOTH.  Joan of Arc?  SCHIZOPHRENIC.  If the French want to win a fight, they have to look to someone mentally ill (Napoleon has a fucking COMPLEX named after him).  Ahhhh, helping France out in one post, and delivering a vicious soldering iron to the face in the next.  I LOVE IT.

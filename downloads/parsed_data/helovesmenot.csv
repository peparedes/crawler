ok so here it is, one of those deep meaningful stories followed by a question that i need feedback on :


so.. im sitting in class (first day as a college sophomore, yes!) and this kid walks in and stops dead in his tracks stares for a minute and sits down. he then waits, and gets up and plants himself right next to me. out of the corner of my eye i keep noticing him staring past the front of my face. i look over and hes drawing a picture of my eye - eyeshadow and all, including out of place eyebrow hairs. note: there was never any conversation what so ever between the two of us.

i should be creeped out, right?"

"event",".. as im leaving my geo121 class i note that the entire side of the building across the walk says:

 <b>""capitalism stole my virinity""</b>

in big chalky letters.

i stop and stare for a few seconds trying to figure out if virinity is a word, or if the writer was just an idiot.

the next building had the same message, only it said virginity. 

so ill assume safely that the idiot that wrote on the dow science building just cant spell or didnt bother to look at what it was writing.

conclusion.
college is a breeding ground for ignorant, immature, liberal, hippie fucks.

stop being uneducated, and <i>stop being so fucking liberal</i>
its really beginging to make me ill 

p.s. if youre going to continue to put up fylers EVERYWHERE claming that george bush is such an awful leader, and a worse human being. ok so he might not be able to speak at all.. but, why dont YOU fucking write him a letter and ask if YOU can run the country during times of war for a few days, and well see how great of a job you can pull off.

"event","now, 
dont get me wrong i completely expected to cry [ because if you know anything about me at all or have known me for any substantial amount of time you know that i have never had a normal birthday ]

so

picture it march 17th 2004 

[night before birthday] 

eleven forty five pm - i was at taco bell and realized what time it was and <b>freaked out</b> cos i figured that jeff had already shown up at my place and left pissed off cos i was there

eleven fifty pm - RUSH home and try calling jeff like six times, cant get through
(first cry fit here)

midnight - vanessa calls, jeff calls *happy birthday jessica*

one am - jeffrey gets here

two am - sleep

eight am - i'm awake and writing a paper

one pm - i go to class

two pm - i return from class

three pm - jeffrey finally wakes up and gets out of bed

three thirty pm- we go to big boy

four thirty pm - we get back from big boy

five pm - jeffrey leaves

now lets sum up at this point : ive seen jeff for four hours total awake and he leaves to go home because he has band practice - which i <b>totally</b> understand <i>only</i> because he has shows this weekend - BUT after being ignored for the band for ten days straight (due to more show situations) i got a <i>wee bit</i> touchy over fact that the band comes before me even on my birthday- 

(insert crying fit number two here)

six pm - jakboiee comes to get me

six thirty pm - we go bowling

eight pm - we go to hunan house

nine thirty pm - we go to the movies [welcome to mooseport bleh movie]


(quickly insert tears in dark theatre here)

eleven thirty pm - come home and try to sleep

one am - actually end up going to bed

two am - amber comes home with a plethora of drunk people who i cant see

two ten am- ambers drunk boyfriend attacks me in my bed 

two ten am and fifteen seconds - amber screams and beats boyfriend

(crying on the phone with jeff cos the situation is weird and uncomfortable)

three am - amber and gang leave for food [lil' chef]

three thirty am - i fall asleep

four fifteen am - i get a series of calls from amber that i try to ignore.. then she starts leaving messages on the dorm answering machine crying and begging for help 

quick filler story: john, ambers boyfriend, by some magical feat ended up at cmu with all his friends they were all incredibly drunk.. there was apparently some fight between some boys over amber at random party and it continued while they ate at lil' chef and so john took his friends car keys and left, only he didnt take the car... he just started walking. john was gone for over an hour by the time amber called me.

four thirty am - i go and get my car to get amber and johns friends cos they are abandoned at the restaurant.. i see john walking while im going to my car/cant get his attention and he starts walking incredibly quickly away from me

four forty am - amber, myself and one of johns friends [danny] drive around the entire city of mount pleasant looking for john

five am - i get pulled over. the cops had been following me for a good ten minutes and finally wanted to know what was up and pulled me over

cop story:  the officer pulls me over and tells me i made an illegal left turn. i ask how thats possible and he says, what he MEANT was that i wasnt completely in the left turn lane and he admitted that i wouldnt know because there was snow on the ground and everyone knows you have no clue where the lines are on freshly snowed on streets. he says hes been following me and wanted to know why id been driving in circles - i explain to him that we are looking for a drunk boy who is possibly dangerous due to his drunkenness and anger.  cop pulls up my record and comes back to talk he asks me if ive been drinking and i almost start laughing and reply ""no sir i havent drank in well over four years"" he says thats good to hear from a college student and then progresses on that he can smell liquor in my car.. amber and danny are forced into admitting that they are both trashed. cop thanks me for being the driver gives me my shit back and says if he sees john he will personally drop him off at my dorms front desk.

five thirty am-  danny amber and i come back to the dorm

five thirty one am- i find john passed out coma like in a ball in front of our door and go and get amber and danny from down stairs

five thirty five am- danny beats the fuck out of john in the hall way

five forty til six am - lots of screaming beating fighting crying calling going on in the other room

seven am - i finally fall asleep

seven thirty am- i get up to go to my eight am class, collapse on the floor and decide its better to just go to bed

(cry)

eleven am- finally get up, puke some water up take some midol and shower. get the worst cramps ever and crumple over in pain 
(cry)

two pm- go to class to take an exam, which i failed miserably

three pm- return to dorm john tries to talk to me and apologize and such i get pissy and tell him its better off not to talk to me at all - he wishes me a happy birthday, belated, and hides in ambers room 

currently - amber comes home from class grabs john by his hair drags him to the door and screams that they need to talk, they are out in the hall screaming and crying now


hi?

ive been coughing up blood and sneezing blood all day. 

end of story.

well .. at least my birthday is over."

"event","so yesterday all the members of adelaide .. minus rob.. added me - so i came up with this whole case scenario where the band was sitting at rams horn -duh- and all decided to track down my lj on a certain day at a certain time.

maybe ive got to much spare time and like making up stories in my head about obscure events

so through much extensive research and years of field study i have finally come to a conclusion : college students are the dumbest people on earth. including me and everyone else thats pays obnoxious amounts of money on any kind of classes. and do not mistake the last comment for being the reason of stupidity - for it is not. we are just... not intelligent people in any way shape or form.

amber is having her drunk ass hick boyfriend and one of his followers come up to drink for st. patricks day (aka my birthday).. am i pissed? oh slightly - so what does this mean? she doesnt get more than a half hour warning when five growing boys come to spend the night here.

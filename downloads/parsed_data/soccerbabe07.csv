My mom is doing relaly good apparently. which is more&nbsp; good news.&nbsp;
However, ive been stressed out up the asshole the past couple of days.
monday i was too tired to do anything but i had t o do some homework and part of my paper which stressed me out. my sisters wouldnt stop calling me and asking me questions i dont know the answers to, that upset me alot. cuz i hate seeing them so unhappy.&nbsp;
Yesterday nicci and i took our lofts down and rebuilt our bunkbeds. yeah there's not enough room in our room for all this shit, plus bunk beds, and 4 desks,and a futon. it sucks. its so cramped. theres desks in the middle of the room and ugh. its annoying.&nbsp;
I talked to my big sister last night on the phone&nbsp;for like 2 hours, and it made me really happy. she always cheers me up. &lt;33&nbsp;
i think i might be staying with her this weekend. That should be fun :)
scotts moved out of my house. im kinda happy, but kinda sad at the same time. i feel bad for him. but i know its what my mom wants and i'll back her up with whatever she wants.&nbsp;

Im sorry to all those i didnt call back, or talk to much this week.  Had alot to do. 

So...
my mom is in the hospital right now for the next couple of weeks. Its really depressing cuz i can't talk to her. And i can't go home :( Got 1 week left of school, then im going to stay with mindy, lauren and andrea and central for a while, then mindy's house til i turn 18 and can actually go home. 
this shit is depressing and i dont want to deal with finals and stuff. it sucks asshole. I cant concentrate on anything, and i dont have the motivation to do anything.
Im running on literally no sleep. 
stayed up all night with my big sister at her house friday night, and the rest of the week i got like 2/3 hours every night. But staying up with my big sis was worth it. i love her to death and im so glad shes helping me thru this.  dunno what id do without her. or kayla. or mindy. you guys have been amazing. and i love you. 
I am no longer excited for my 18th birthday. Still planning on going to tiki bobs, and getting my nipps pierced, and now my sister and i are getting tattoos together. She wants her first one, and i want to get another cuz im addicted. But i dont get to see my mom, or my sisters, or scott. so it fucking sucks. :(
i just want my mom back. the old her. the one i know and love. i dont want any more of this shit, and i want my sisters back at home. i want to know they're safe, even if that means them staying with my step dad. least they'll be safe and i'll know where they are...

i need to finish my paper. but i dont want to. 
i need to go home. but again, i dont want to.
i want to run away. go somewhere with 1 or 2 people nad just drive. for hours. and not have to worry about anything. 
sigh..i want my life back.
i need a hug..a big one :(

This weekend was mucho fun. Came home on thursday, hung out at jess' house with ryan, kay and sammy, then later on when kay and sam went home jess ryan and i went to coney's for ryan's birthday breakfast..at 1 in the morning.
Friday got  up, kayla came over and then we went to royal oak with jess and ryan to get ry some sunglasses. Came home, jess and ryan came over later on and we went with my mother to get some alcohol. woo. then people started coming over and getting drunk.  friday night was definitely fun. Although i don't remember alot of it...but oh well. 
Didnt get to bed til like 5.30ish. And we'd been drinking since 7. twas good. 
got up at like 11 the next morning. wtf. sat around with andrea and my mother and talked til pat woke up. then andrea and pat left and i sat and waited for lauren and ryan to finally wake up. But i gave up on that and decided to go out to lunch with kayla and chin instead. :) 
Then later saturday jess, ryan, ben, kayla sammy and i played softball up @ Cousino. it was really fun. And we were being active. go us. then we dropped ben off, picked chin up and went and got thai food. wow, my mouth was on fire. i felt like the guy in the wendy's commercial where he breathes fire. it was so good, but soo damn hot. But anyways, after that we all just went home cuz we were shit tired from the night before. 
sunday got up and watched a ton of nip tuck..again. ive seriously watched both seasons about 5 times now. 
went over kayla and sammys for a while. played some catch outside, watched some of pulp fiction. thennn it was time for me to go home :( Ate dinner, started on my treck back to school.  Nicci wanted us to pick her up from the airport in lansing cuz she went to florida for the weekend. Wow. she got us so fucking lost. She gave us totally wrong directions, then failed to tell us the road we were supposed to follow splits into two and we were supposed to take the left, not keep going straight. soo it took us about an hour to find her, then about 30 minutes to get back to my dorm..when the airport is only 10 minutes away. good times. 
So my week was good..up until now. Yesterday i woke up with a sore throat. I now have strep throat. Again. for the 4th time this year. and i just failed my math class. Cuz i didnt go to the test. cuz i feel like im going to pass out everytime i move. and i cant stay awake for more than 10 minutes at a time. or i feel like im gunna hurl. and i have a horrible headache. but i needed to pass this test. and i didnt go. hopefully they'll let me re-take it if i take in a doctors note. cuz i have to go tomorrow. boo. 
now im going to pass out on the futon. again."

Saturday i cleaned like allllllllll day. Then a bunch of people came over and got wasted with me and scott cuz my mom went to a sex toy party. Yeah. 
That was alot of fun. More fun than ive had in a long time.  Cept i did get pissed off for a while at my mother, of course, and punched a wall, really hard, twice, once with each hand. and now my hands are kinda bruised and they hurt. But oh well. 
played some beer pong, tried the hottest hot sauce in the world and had to chug a ton of milk before my tongue fell off. Got  to hang out with my sloppy hoes, and that was awesome. Its been way too long. :) didnt end up passing out til around 4.30ish.
Woke up to my phone ringing at like 10.45. Gahhhh. Kay sam and sean were the only ones left, everyone else had split and random times i guess.
Went to olga's. hung out with jess, sam and kayla the rest of the day.

I definitely think i need to. <strike>My mom and Scott broke up</strike>, My Mom broke up with scott.&nbsp;and my mom's not happy to say the least. :( <br />Last night me n ashbo went to Nicci's bar night.&nbsp; Its greek week for the sororities and frats, and for the past 3 or 4 months nicci's been practicing for some dance thing, like 5 girls from each sorority and a few guys from a frat are it in.&nbsp; It was at the auditorium and all the frats and sororities danced and shit, it was fun. Nicci was so cute, she was amazing. Her lil jump rope solo. awww &lt;33&nbsp;((Makes me glad im not in a sorority tho. Fucking A-n-n-o-y-i-n-g.))<br />Nicci was really pissed off tho cuz they got 5th. They shoulda got better than that, but the people that were the best did win, so i'll just keep my mouth shut bout that one.&nbsp;<br />Lately all i've been doing is watching nip/tuck. i found that i had season 1 and 2 at home. weird. so i brought them and we've watched it none stop.&nbsp; Started on thursday night, finished season 1 and 2 monday night. I think that counts as obsessed.&nbsp; Now we have nothin to watch, so me and ash started season 1 over. haha.&nbsp;<br />i havent slept in my bed since saturday.&nbsp; Ash and me keep sleeping on the futon.&nbsp; Its weird. But i dont like my bed anymore.&nbsp;<br />Need to figure out classes for next year @ Wayne.&nbsp;<br /><strong>Excitement.&nbsp;<br /></strong>i need to go to the bank. Rarg.&nbsp;<br />I quit my job. finally :) Was supposed to work my last shift last night 5-close. But i didnt feel like going. Sooo i didn't. :)<br />now i dont have to work a whole bunch and can actually watch the tv shows i wanna watch. **Yes**<br /><br />The End."

Attention Mindy...you might not want to read the first paragraph..its the story of my car, and i know you hate hearing it more than 8 times :)&nbsp;

With that said...
thursday night i got off work at liek 11.10 and called Andrea, she said pick up batteries before&nbsp; you leave to come to central. Sooo i go home, pick up my friend, and get batteries. Well...im driving back down the street i work on a my tire blows out. Greaat. So i get my manager to change it cuz he was still there. Then we're back on the way again. Like 20 miles down the road my car starts violently shaking like...i dont even know, the chairs were shaking the mirrors were shaking and i freaked out, pulled off an exit and sat at the side of some street.&nbsp; Called my mom and asked her what the hell im supposed to do cuz its 12 at night and theres no one around, she called Triple A for me and i aclled andrea, lauren and mindy. They get leeann and they start driving from mt. pleasant to come get me &lt;3 . Well jules gets her friend to come pick her up cuz its got to like&nbsp;1 in the morning, and i didnt want to leave my car, so i stayed.&nbsp; Tow truck came at like 2.30 and said drive down to the gas station. well i didnt really ant ot drive but i did. He went to fill up the donut tire with air cuz he said it was low.&nbsp; The tire blew up in his face and blew his hat off. i almost shit my pants. well he bailed and just left me there, so i went and sat in the speedway gas station in St. Johns with some lady and waited for andrea, lauren, mindy and leeann. I have no clue as to what time they got there but they did, and thats all i care about, so we went back to central, got taco bell and passed out at like 4.&nbsp;

Friday, got up...my mom screamed at me for not getting my car fixed that day .even tho i had no money to do it, but i was supposed to figure that out myself? whatever. Went to the moooovies to see Stay Alive. It was alright, nothing too special. Got chinese food. yummmmmy. Drank in the room a lil bit. Went to lil chef.&nbsp;
Saturday..got up went to get my car fixed.&nbsp; Mindy, lauren andrea and i went to my car and got it towed to Walmart, they said they couldnt fix it at first cuz the rim was bent, but they smashed the rim back into place. But i eventually have to get a new rim. FUCKERS.&nbsp;
Anyways...that night was fun, went to a party, cops broke it up. Good times. Balled my eyes out with lauren. Fun.&nbsp;

i dont really feel like writing the rest of the weekend down, cuz my hand hurts and i have to go to class soon, but i had alot of fun, and it was good to see you guys this weekend :) And thank you sooo much for all the help with the car :) I love you guys :)&nbsp;

Im still sick...fucking aye.&nbsp; I cant eat anything without throwing it back up. It sucks. I havent eaten really since hmm...sunday.&nbsp;
booooo. Im starving. I want to eat. 
I hate writing papers, cuz thats what i should be doing right about now.&nbsp;

Picked up the beer pong table and the beer from my house, had trouble fiting that bitch in my car. but we managed cuz we're slick. Huge traffic violation &lt;3 lol.&nbsp;
Went to joes, got to see everyone. Twas lots of fun &lt;33&nbsp;
Got up at like 10, after we went to bed around 6. lets just say i was very tired.

I got up at 7.15..gahh. Got my shit together and left. Stopped by Kayla's house to say hi/bye. Then it took me from about 8 til about 10 to get to school
I went 35mph on 696 cuz there was so much traffic. I was pissed. But whatever.
Got back here, unpacked my shyt and went to math. Boring as usual.
Got back to my room and low and behold nick is over..i was kinda confused. But i guess him and nicci are getting back together. I am against this idea, but whatever. Not my business i guess.&nbsp;
The weather was B-e-a-utiful...72 degrees, sunny...i wore a spagetti strap and flip flops for the first time in forever. And i was mucho excited about that!!
Went to chemistry with lisa. Good to catch up with her. I missed her.&nbsp;
Went to wra...got there..there was a sign saying class was cancelled. I was probably the happiest person on the planet. So i came home, me n nicci caught up on s/b shit, then went to laff. It was heaven.&nbsp; Its sad that we're so obsessed with eating there. But its so damn good. mmm.&nbsp;
I tried to take lansbury's bed apart today. But there were no wrenches available. So i tried using this other thing. didnt work out to great.
And she came back here to do something? oops.&nbsp; But we're re-arranging our room, and it's gunna be saweet. Im excited.&nbsp;
I watched 2 hours of friends and an hour of family guy tonight. It was Amazing.&nbsp;
I'm getting sick. Boo. Damn sammy!&nbsp; &lt;33
But im calling in sick to work on friday so i can come home. So im going to pretend im sick all week. :)&nbsp;
I want a crunchwrap right now. Im a fat ass.

<p>i dont want to go back to school. This has been a really fun week.&nbsp; Spent some good time with some fun people, and it made me happy. <br />Everything at home is finally working itself out. My mom is finally happy. And i love seeing her happy. She deserves it.&nbsp; I now don't have to deal with all that curfew bullshit. Which makes me veryyy happy. <br />I know i need to concentrate on the next 2 months of school. Like realyl concentrate, so i dont end up failing out or something. Cuz that would be bad. <br />Angela Lansbury is moving out of our room after spring break to go live in her condo that her rents got her. I'm jealous. And sad.&nbsp; Im definitely going to miss her. She's crazy, and she laughs at all my jokes. ha.&nbsp; However...our room is going to be nutso.&nbsp; Nicci, ashley and I. Wtf. Its never going to be clean, we're never going to be sober, and we're never going to class, and we're never going to sleep. A-w-e-s-o-m-e.&nbsp; Kinda scared, not gunna lie. <br />Kayla sam and i went appt. searching this week. It was a real reality check that im actually going to move out of my house.&nbsp; Even tho im not lviing here currently cuz of school n shit, i do still live here. But im going to get my own place, that we can call our own, and do whatever the hell we want, whenever the hell we want. Im super excited, don't get me wrong, but im kinda not looking forward to the finding a cheap appt. that can fit 6 people in it part. Thats going to suck.<br />this weekend i took the first step to moving the fuck on. I was really proud of myself.&nbsp; Bake was having a party this weekend and wanted kayla sammy and chin to come with. Kayla said we could go if i wanted to. But...I had way more fun at mindy's brothers house, and im really glad i went there, and didnt go to bakes. We had already got ditched one time during the week, and i didnt want to deal with all that old past bullshit. And i wasnt upset at all, all night. Go me.&nbsp;<br />Wayne state wont let me log in to send in my transcript. Bastards. I should&nbsp; call. Soon.&nbsp;<br /><br />Im going to bed. im dead.&nbsp;<br /><br />late night talks with my best friend are the greatest :)</p>"

then my mom came home. haha. she was SO Drunk. i loved it. Her, scott and kathy had just coem back from my moms suprise party, and they were completely drunk and scott joined in with beer pong and 2 bitch which was awesome cuz i love him.&nbsp;
only downer on the nite was when he made me cry. but whatever. im over it.&nbsp;
i had mucho fun that nite, and got totally shitfaced in front on my mom, which has never happened before. but will happen again ha.
anyways..woke up saturday with the biggest headache and about 400 bruises all over my body. dont even know. i didnt fall...much. but i have bruises on my toes, on my legs, on my stomach (andrea) on my back, and on my arms. wtf.&nbsp;

Ended up sitting there for a hella long time. then we watched wedding crashers. i love that movie. &lt;333
Yesterday i got to see jessy. haven't seen her in forever and a day. i dont even know how long its been. it was good to catch up :)
but yesterday was definitely a chill day. i kinda liked it tho.&nbsp;
i dont know whats going on for the rest of the week. but who cares, im home and thats all that matters to me. i just dont ever want to go back!!
i should go clean my room...or at least take my moms boxes out so i can get into my room.&nbsp;

I absolutely LOVE working with her.&nbsp;
our headsets for drive thru has a thing on it where&nbsp; you can talk to only the person wearing the other head set. So while im taking orders, she likes to sing to me. And she likes to sing to me the rest of the night too :)
Besides working with her, worked SUCKED.
People just kept coming in. We were slammed from 5-10.40. And i usually start closing at 9.30. So yeah, i didnt get out on time, obviously.&nbsp;
Today is Angela Nicole's birthday. so HAPPY BIRTHDAY LANS!&nbsp;
I dunno what we're doing. Hopefully getting crunkness going tho ;)
2 more days until spring break, and 2 more days until my step dad is gone forever.
Lets just say im a little pumped.

People have been pissing me off lately. No one in particular. Just people. its kinda driving me crazy. i think i need this spring break a lot. To get out of here and clear my head. Cuz this place is hell.&nbsp;
Tj moved out the other day. haha. We got some new blonde chick from Holmes. I haven't talked to her yet cuz i've been busy. but she seems alright.&nbsp;
kinda pissed tho, cuz even tho my roomies and i thought we were being stealth with the alcohol...tj brought it to our attention that she knew of all the parties and the drinking. Specially when everyone came to visit after christmas break. But she said as long as we were being safe she didnt care. So now we have to figure out what this lady is like..dammit.&nbsp;
My sisters came up this past weekend, it was fun to hang out with them. I miss them more than i thought i did. 
I've been in a really good mood for like 3 days now. And i like it. Alot.&nbsp;
I got my hair did today with nicci. 
I like it alot :) The lady that did my hair was pretty good. but im in love with her instructor. her name was ty. now thats just a really hot name. And she looked liked a much better version of cheryl. And for those who know who cheryl is...thats pretty fucking hot. 
and i got a free head massage. Score!&nbsp;
my hair's really short now tho...back to the way it should be if i wasnt so damn lazy.&nbsp;
i really have nothing interesting to say. So im just going to shut up now.

i hate it, and i have no clue what im doing. and i have a test on monday. AWESOME.
Last nite i wanted to kill someone. 
So 3 people didnt show up for work. Yes, 3 people. SOo it was just nick and i working 5 people's jobs. Lets just say it didnt go too great. Nick got food thrown at him by some stupid bitch who said she waited too long. She said ""im sick of incompitance"" well bitch it was incompitance it was the fact that tehre were 2 people there when there's supposed to be 5!! Arg. that pissed me off, i wanted to bitch slap her. 
So i didnt get out of work til 11.45, cuz i stayed later to help nick do his stuff cuz i felt bad. Im only supposed to work 10-15 hours a week, right now im working 20 and eva decided to schedule me last minute for sunday. Well that means 26 hours in a week, thats just bullshit. So i told nick im not coming in cuz i have other things to do. I seriously have no time to do any homework or any studying cuz all i do is go to class, work, sleep. Its retarded. 
So i got home around 12, and sat on the phone with rosemary for a good hour and a half. It was nice <3
angela was drunk. it was amusing. Until she poured her entire drink on the futon, which i was laying on. Drunkass. 
My sisters are coming to stay with me tomorrow night! YAY! Nicci and i have the day all planned out, and im really excited. i miss those lil shits too much. 
today was poo too. Damn math. I hate my math teacher, he's so dumb. i cant understand a word he says. mayb he shoulda learned english before trying to teach math. seriously, how do these people get jobs?!?! 
Anyways...now i have to study for chemistry for a half an hour before i got to work..again..to close...again. i get paid today tho, so thats exciting. it better be a good check. 
as for tonight..after work i plan on getting absolutley beligerantly drunk as to the point where i can no longer feel feelings, cuz right now i feel the most alone i have ever felt before, and i hate it. :(

Something like that.&nbsp;<br />Next morning Kayla, Sammy, Chin, Alise and Pat came up.&nbsp; We all went to Friday's.&nbsp; Kayla and I split our meal, and then ended up not paying cuz the guy kept ignoring kayla.&nbsp; I thought it was amusing. Other people didn't however. Julie and Natalie came later on that night too. <br />That night we got the hotel.&nbsp; Got pretty drunk.&nbsp; Then the weekend just turned pretty much to shit for me.&nbsp; And i have no one but myself to blame for that one.&nbsp;&nbsp;That night was pretty much shit, and i wanted to jump off the balcony right by our room.&nbsp; Ended up sleeping in a spot with jess and pat that wasn't even big enough for 2. It sucked asshole.&nbsp;<br />Woke up in the morning wanted to die pretty much. Sat around for a while before me kayla and sammy took a trip to Taco Bell.&nbsp; Sat around for the rest of the day, showered n stuff, then decided at like 3 to get drunk with Mindy.&nbsp; So Alise, Mindy, Lauren, Kayla, Sammy and I played 2 bitch whilst everyone else went back to jessica's dorm to pick shit up and shower.&nbsp; So i was pretty wasted from around 3 to all night.&nbsp; It was well needed.&nbsp; <br />That was a good night for 99.9% of the night...until i made a drunken phone call to stephanie.&nbsp; That was bad.&nbsp; She definitely told me something about a certain someone that made me want to die..literally. Apparently the past 11 months of my life didn't happen. And i just couldn't handle that, so i balled my eyes out for about an hour.&nbsp; <br />Then we all went to bed, at who knows what time.&nbsp; I didnt shit, and i still didnt get a bed. Fucking game.&nbsp; <br />Woke up Sunday to roughly 45 alarm clocks going off at once.&nbsp; Packed all the shit up, realized my phone was broken cuz i left it on the heater, which was actually on air conditioning all night, so my phone was soaking wet thanks to the condensation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />The drive home was awkwardness for about an hour and a half. Not going to lie i wanted to drive the car into a ditch. <br />Although i said all i can say, i still feel as though i have more to say.&nbsp; But i don't. Or maybe i do but i cant figure out what it is. I don't know. All i know is the worst feeling in the world is having your best friend hate you and knowing that it's all your fault.&nbsp; And what might be worse than that is not being able to go to my best friend and talk about it.&nbsp; I am the first to admit that <em><strong>I fucked up</strong>. i </em>did and i know that. and i know i cant fix that with a snap of the fingers or a i love you. But i do know that i could never feel this way again,its killing me inside knowing that i hurt you.&nbsp; It makes me want to die knowing that.&nbsp; And i know you probably don't believe me, and i don't blame you, but i would never do that to you again.&nbsp; I couldn't take this feeling of losing my best friend.&nbsp; I can't take this feeling of losing my best friend.&nbsp; <br />I feel like i have no one.&nbsp; No one to care enough to actually listen to me when i want to talk, when i need to talk, when i have to talk.&nbsp; No shoulder to cry on, no hand to hold when all i want to do is scream.&nbsp; People say ""oh im there for you"" or ""you can talk to me anytime"" but really..its&nbsp;a crock of shit.&nbsp; i learn that one the hard way.&nbsp; Even yesterday i told someone i needed to talk to them. But i get ignored, like its not important enough.&nbsp; Guess people have better things to do with their time.&nbsp; This is why i don't ever open up to anyone, because i can't take telling peopel things then having them either run off and tell someone else, or smile, nod, and then suddenly have to go.&nbsp; <br />Lots of people have told me that they don't feel like they know me as well as i know them.&nbsp; And i realize that that is really true. Because i sit and listen to people talk, and tell me stuff, but i can't do that back.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't do that back.&nbsp; Sometimes i feel as though i should work on that, and maybe try to open up to people, but then sometimes, like last night, i realize, people really don't care.&nbsp; <br />it sucks to feel all alone.&nbsp; It sucks to not have any one to talk to. And it sucks to know that the people that you want//need to talk to don't want to listen, or have better things to do. And&nbsp;finally...it sucks to not have my best friend to talk to.&nbsp; The one person that actually listens.<br />I just fuck everything up. All the time. And i hate it."

<p>im sooo irratable..i don't know why. Only with certain people too. Like they can say hi, and i'll get so irritated. Fucking weird<br />This week has sucked asshole so far. <br />Monday was just monday.<br />Tuesday i had to work 5-close. And&nbsp;the district manager was in and he made us do everything perfectly which took like an extra half hour, plus i was on drive thru and that closes an hour later than lobby. Only plus to that was that i got to talk to nick for 6 hours. he's so cute. 23. and single. hmm...Me and people i work with. I Don't know what it is. but yeah..shit happened with 2 people, i want my manager back home, and now nick. i should just stay away from people i work with. <br />And yeah, tuesday was valentines day, obviously. and i was fine, up until i got a stupid IM from a certain someone saying happy valentines day. and there was no need for that, it was just kinda a huge kick in the face. not to mention the heart. So me and nicci just felt sorry for ourselves and watched titanic.<br />And today...ugh i dont even know. didnt go to chemistry, felt like shyt, in a shitty mood. I talked to my mom for almost 2 hours on the phone tonight tho. we talked about everything. it was amazing. im glad i got to talk to her, cuz that hasn't happened in a very long time.&nbsp; Shes finally happy, with scott and all. and im glad, cuz he's a nice guy, and treats her right, for once. <br />Tomorrow i have to work til close too. Boo for work. I despise it. <br />Least i get the pay check tho. should be a good one.<br />I just cant wait for the weekend. Going up to western to see my loves. Getting totally fucking shit faced. and im going to enjoy it.<br />Then i just have to wait for spring break. And after that, the end of the semester. THANK GOD.<br />only like 70 something days and i get to go home. for good.<br />Im definitely going to miss my nicsters tho..:( shes my lover. <br />ok i think im done rambling.<br />not like anyone really reads it anyway. <br />not like i really care.&nbsp;<br /></p>"

"event","<P>I really don't know if i can handle any more of this shit.<BR>I just want to go home, and curl up into a ball on my bed and never come out. <BR>I really thought i was ok with everything. Finally thought that i was over it. But i lied, im not.<BR>I hadn't thought about anything to do with a certain someone in a long time. Well not a long time, but a long time for me. So like 2 days. But then i had to read a stupid away message, and ever since then i want to shoot myself in the fucking head. <BR>Seriously, love does stink. I hate it. <BR>And i can't really talk to anyone about it, cuz i have nothing to say. I just want to scream, and cry. But i don't really have any close shoulders to cry on, or anyone to scream at. Cept nicci.&nbsp; <BR>which is why i want to go home. Im sick of school, and not going to classes. Cuz i never do anymore. Im sick of stupid assignments, and having to walk to class in the freezing cold. I just want it to be summer so i can forget school, get really drunk and really tan by my pool, and have everyone i love like 5 minutes away, not 500 miles away.<BR>I seriously cannot wait to get the hell out of here, and not have to deal with this shit. And i cannot wait to move into a house with kay, sammy, jess, chin, and whoever else is included. Its going to be the shytt x100. <BR>But until then i have to tryyyyy and focus on school, and keeping my grades up cuz my moms on my ass about that. Apparently if i get bad grades my car insurance goes up? WTF? <BR>and i have to try and keep my mind OFF of certain things...even tho i think ive proved to myself its physically impossible for me to do so. </P>
<P>Wow thats a really depressing entry.</P>
<P>I have to go to chemistry now. Woo hoo.<BR></P>
<P>I Love You..And it kills me.</P>

p.s i love my best friend"

<P>I don't know...</P>
<P>today was just a weird//retarded//dumb day<BR>I got an oil change, and the guy who changed my oil said that the 600 dollars of work i got done on my car wasn't necessary..that pissed me off<BR>Then i basically did nothing, until me and nicci decided to do each others make up like retards, and dress up like even bigger retards. it was fun for the 45 minutes it took. <BR><BR>I think im in love with Grey's anatomy. that show is ridiculous. <BR><BR>And i think im sick of thinking too much<BR>Like..ugh it sucks. <BR>I have so much on my mind, and i can't say anything to anyone about it cuz i know it'll just cause trouble and that's just not good. I'd rather just keep my mouth shut and not deal with the crap. <BR>I don't like, however, having people assume shit...that just pisses me off. Don't assume unless you know. </P>
<P>My step dad is FINALLY leaving at the end of this month. Although he is taking half the damn house with him, we get to keep the house, and my 4 cats. and thats all that matters really. Im really excited, cuz then 1. i get to actually go home on weekends and not stay at kayla's house and piss her mom off, and 2. i get my mom back. I don't have to deal with the person she became because of my step dad. and that makes me happy. cuz i miss my old mom more than anything. <BR>AND..i get to throw a huge party at my house after he leaves, and get schwasted with scott and my mom. haha awesomeness. So im excited for that...me n jessica finally get to play my mom in beer pong. never thought id actually say that. haha</P>
<P>besides that, im just excited for the weekend<BR>Yay for western and my loves</P>

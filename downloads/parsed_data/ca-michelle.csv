"event","The drama-free weekend ended at about 1am this morning. 

Darn teenagers. I need to keep it all in perspective. I did dumb stuff when I was a kid (and sometimes I still do). They listen better when I am not yelling, nagging, or berating. To make a point, I've got to pick my moment and not get overly wordy.&nbsp; 

I so dislike the grounding process. When the kids are grounded, so is Mom. 

On the plus side, it's nice and cool outside. Yay!"

"event","I've been thinking a lot about how I spend the bulk of my time and about how&nbsp;that is&nbsp;keeping me from working on some of the things that I'd really like to be doing.&nbsp; I enjoy writing, but blogging is keeping me from working on my book and it's keeping me from spending much time with my camera. 

If I'm going to make photography my business, then I need to be TAKING&nbsp;PHOTOS. I'm either going to have to write blogs that I put less time and energy into, give up one or more of my blogs (means I make less $$), or ..........dang I don't know. I think that the photography will bring more money in the long term, anyway. 

It's hard, especially when money is tight, to make some decisions. I want to be able to provide a better living for my family. Doesn't everybody want to do that?&nbsp; I'd like to be able to take a trip to see my Grandma, to go camping, to not freak out if someone tells me they've outgrown their jeans/shoes/jacket. I need some wiggle room.

My friend, Jackie, was here this weekend. She is going to move to Chico so that she can go to Law School. She's been working as a realtor for a long time, but it's not a business that is treating her well right now. When she moves over here, she will still do property management and she will look for a job at another real estate office. She'll do the Law at night. She's very excited and I think her kids are looking forward to it, as well, because she is going to pick a place to rent that has a pool. Like here, at my apartments. The idea of having my best friend as a neighbor is very exciting. I think it will be especially cool because we can help each other out with the kids. I love her kids and she likes mine, too. 

Okay, I'm pooped out. Long day. Talk to you later."

This is always the time of year when I start thinking about how nice it would be to move to the coast, where the high is like 75-80. <br /><br />Mark called me from his place and he thinks he has pneumonia. I think that the flu is more likely, as he's only been sick for a few days. It seems like he is always coming down with something. He should eat better. <br /><br />I've been watching the beginning of S1 of <a href=""http://www.hbo.com/trueblood/season2/"">True Blood</a>. Did I mention that already?&nbsp; So far I'm 3 episodes in. I like Sookie, like that she's cute in a real girl way and not perfect. She's got a split in her teeth, which is something that I have as well. So far the boys are interesting too, but Sam is my favorite. <br /><br />There's a lot of sex in the show, which my friend warned me about, and it's not pretty sex&nbsp;- it's more on the raw side. Those HBO actors are brave.&nbsp; The story is interesting, but it shows the South in a sinister way. I wonder what it really feels like over there?&nbsp; Is it anything like they show it on tv?&nbsp; I've heard that the bugs are HUGE."

"event","Hello, I've been away for awhile. I blame it on a few things. The first being me and my inability to get organized for some reason. I always tell myself that today is the day that I get organized again. The second is my work. There's always more to do and I keep taking on new projects. I&nbsp;love the work I'm doing right now. It is so much fun. The third thing is my new boyfriend, Mark. My head is full of boy thoughts and that leads me back to the first problem - it's hard to get things under control when my head is in the clouds. 

My kids are all doing well. We had the meeting for Max's IEP yesterday. He will be able to attend his school until he is 22. Right now he is 18.5. That change is going to be a hard one. He has been going to the same school since just before his 3rd birthday. They start special needs kids very young - Early Intervention. One of Max's teachers made the comment that his chin whiskers look like Shaggy from Scooby Doo. That's what we say around the house. They grow so fast, while the rest of his facial hair is still blonde and soft. Raising Max is such an interesting experience. He is my baby, but he's also a man, a petite man. He still wants me to hold him, he likes his head tucked under my chin. He is just so very sweet. 

Bay is doing well. Her boyfriend, Greg, is still living with us. Have I&nbsp;talked about that before?&nbsp; He moved in with us back in January. He's spending a bit more time with his family lately and he's talking about &quot;transitioning&quot; home this Summer. I am very glad that he is doing better with his family, but I will miss his constant presence. I&nbsp;love to hear the rumble of his voice through the wall. I&nbsp;look at him and he feels like My Boy, but he's not, he is someone else's boy.&nbsp; He cried the other day, his lip trembled and then the tears came and it tore me up. He's on the verge of being a man, but still so vulnerable and my girl, Bay, she's hard on everybody, especially the people she loves most (Greg and me). 

Bay is going to school pretty hit and miss, as always. Right now she is laying under the heating pad. She took two days off last week for the same thing. I want her done with school. I do not want this worry any longer. The good part of this school - I&nbsp;get a break and she has no homework. 

Sarah is miserable at her school. She gets called names and she feels that a couple of students are watching her every move. She says that they will call other students over and tell them, Sarah did this, Sarah did that. I am taking her out of that school for next year. I have talked to her teacher before about the problems. She either does not care or is not paying attention. This stuff happens INSIDE her classroom.&nbsp; 

I better get moving. I need to get Max ready for school. I hope that you are having a good day."

Next day we went by his house and his mom had packed up ALL of his stuff. ALL of it. <br /><br />I want to .......well, Mom helped Steve when he was a year younger. I was 17 and Steve was 16 and he had a bed at our house. I asked Mom tonight, I said, &quot;Mom did&nbsp;Steve parents call you or did they just......&quot;&nbsp; because Greg's mom hasn't called. She hasn't checked on him. She doesn't&nbsp; answer his texts (he only has text service on his phone).&nbsp; Isn't she worried?&nbsp; Does she trust me, even though she's only spoken to me three times?&nbsp; Or <strong>does she not care?</strong>&nbsp; I'm sure he's not perfect. What teenage boy is, but honestly, <strong>he's good to Bay</strong>, he's polite to me, he's cool with Max. I know that he must have done something to piss his mom off, but how bad could this boy be?<br /><br /><strong>&nbsp;He is just a boy</strong>. <br /><br />I got four different shipments of stuff today. Frozen soup, lip gloss and a candle, cashew juice,&nbsp; and about 20 bottles of Johnson's products. Did you know that this is the 50th anniversary of No More Tears? The frozen soup came with dry ice. I touched the bag it was in and Bay said, &quot;Don't touch that,&quot; but it was right next to the soup, so I thought it would be okay. Anyway, it felt cold, so my brain said &quot;wet,&quot; but it's not wet, the bad that held it was cold and dry.&nbsp; And it stinks. <br /><br />Did you watch The Office?&nbsp; Or The Beast?&nbsp; This boy on The Beast, he's very pretty.&nbsp;He has these dark circles under his eyes that keep him from being too perfect.&nbsp; Oh, I just looked him up and he's Travis Fimmel. I didn't recognize him without all that hair. Did you see him when he was Tarzan?&nbsp; I used to have him as my wallpaper awhile back when he had long hair.&nbsp; Those Australian men, they have something extra. Have you ever noticed that? <br /><br />I'm really tired. G'night.</p>"

Three different companies are sending me probiotic bars or drinks.&nbsp; I hadn't even heard the word probiotics until a couple of months ago. Now it appears to be the new &quot;thing.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />While I am looking forward to trying the new products, I really wish that there was going to be more cosmetic or perfume packages.&nbsp; I'm rediscovering how much I love makeup and perfume. I was using it, sure, but I got a little lazy and just used the same thing all the time. It's so fun to try fancy-smancy stuff that I would never buy for myself, because I'm a mom and moms don't do frivolous things like that. <br /><br />Today is my Grandma's birthday. This will be her first birthday without my Grandpa. I tried to call her earlier and got her machine. I'm hoping that means that she's doing something fun for her birthday dinner. I&nbsp;miss her so much. I used to get to see her so often, but it's been years now and I don't see how I can get up there with Max again. His scoliosis is so much worse than when we last made the trip. She was going to come down here, but has already changed her plans (or my sister changed her plans, I'm really not sure what happened) and I'm afraid that she will do it again. She won't fly, it frightens her too much, which I can understand.&nbsp; <br /><br />I saw a man at the Farmer's Market this past weekend and he looked like a mixture of both my Grandpas who are no longer alive.&nbsp; He had Grandpa Johnny's eyebrows and he kept doing this thing with his mouth - I think he'd been snacking and we caught him mid-snack, but his skin and his cheeks and the way he kept trying to explain this recipe to me, it reminded me so much of Grandpa Harold. I had such a hard time hearing him and I felt sort of frozen. I was so afraid that I was going to start crying right there in the middle of the market.&nbsp; Leah, my friend, made a joke about my &quot;new boyfriend&quot; and I laughed, was able to regroup. Grief is a strange thing. It can just swoop in out of nowhere and sucker punch you. <br /><br />I have a giveaway going on over at Veggie Chic.

"event","<p>I've been thinking a lot about Spring lately. Sort of wishing Winter away - I know I can't actually wish it away, but I day dream about hurrying it along.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Earlier in the week, I&nbsp;started cleaning out my flower beds, moving away the dead leftovers from the Cannas and the Hawaiian Ginger, but it was cold and the only tool I&nbsp;have is a little cutter from the dollar store.&nbsp; I&nbsp;did a haphazard job, intending to go back and finish later, when my hands grew stiff and sore.&nbsp; Only, now I don't have to, because the gardeners came and they cleaned it all out for me. <br /><br />I thanked them and one offered to move all the pots around my patio, to clean up the leaves that were trapped between.&nbsp; That's over and beyond, as far as I'm concerned, and wholly my responsibility - my pots, my mess.&nbsp; I told Bay and she mentioned how <strong>everyone appreciates being appreciated</strong>, getting some positive feedback and since she is a now a working woman (of 2 months), I think she knows what she is talking about.&nbsp; I know that I&nbsp;like to hear good things at any of my jobs.&nbsp; <br /><br />When I took my garbage out to the dumpster tonight, I could see all the clean lines of the flowerbeds clearly in the security lights. It looked very tidy and reminded me of last March when I cleared off the patio and planted the early tomatoes.&nbsp; Everything was so pristine&nbsp;then and even though it was early Spring, I was already dreaming of Summer.&nbsp; That's a bad habit of mine, dreaming of the next season - in Summer I look forward to the milder Autumn temperatures, too.&nbsp; Something about seeing the cleared flowerbeds reminded me that <strong>I&nbsp;need to slow down and appreciate where I am - bloom where I'm planted</strong>.&nbsp; <br /><br />I spent the past year and a half thinking about what it would be like when Steve and I lived together. I had such a hard time letting go of that, even when I was horribly unhappy, even when&nbsp;I felt rejected, or whatever.&nbsp; I've decided that yeah, okay, maybe I'm not meant to have a partner. I was resigned to that before, I can get there again. <strong>I need to accept that this is me, this is my place in life</strong>. I can stay in this place comfortably, sort of wiggle around, scoot around, loosen out the tight spots. I can do this.&nbsp; My life is good.&nbsp; <br /><br />Always wishing for something else is so pointless.&nbsp; If I die tomorrow, I would be so pissed that I wasted this last year.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>"

I'm a big fan of pin-up art. I love the style, the beauty of the models, but more than anything, I love that attitude that they show off. A sort of come-hither-if-you-dare sort of thing. I have a few books of my favorite artists - mostly Maxfield Parrish volumes - but my favorite is a big, thick book of pin-up art through the years. 

I read today that Bettie Page had a heart attack and is now critically ill. I know that she's elderly, she's 85, but in my mind's eye, she's still a lovely luscious lady in her 20s.  I did some research on her, for a post for The Scented Life.com and I found out that she left modeling in the late '50s after she became a born-again Christian. She attended 3 seperate Bible colleges and wanted to be a missionary, but was turned away, at least once, due to her previous divorces - she was married 4 times, I think, but twice to the same man, her teenage sweetheart. 

What a long and interesting life she must have led. When you look back on a span of years for anyone, you see a starting point and you see where they end up and somehow the path from one point to the other takes so many twists and turns. You just never know how anything is going to turn out. 

My life has changed so much in the past year. I was heading into a depression at this time last year. It sort of jumped out and grabbed me. I wasn't able to leave it behind for about 2 months. I'm sure that I'm lucky that it was only 2 months, but at the time it felt endless and all-comsuming. I will always feel horrible for ruining my children's Christmas last year. I could not snap myself out of it. I couldn't get any help either, because I had no money and no medical care. Happily, this year, my head is in a better place and if I do have trouble, I can get some medical help. 

Many things are uncertain for me now, but I keep plugging along, getting my work done, trying new things when I can, and somehow I get by. Just like every body else."

"event","I'm enjoying my new writing jobs, but my brain is exhausted. A lot of time goes into the research and the writing, but even more goes into the promotion of the posts. I have to go to different places and place links, visit other writers to either link to them in a post now or at some later date, have to make ""connections"", etc. I feel that my computer is now permanently connected to my lap. 

One of the posts that got the most interest this week was about my experience with that new Loreal mascara with the tubes. I liked it and I've tried a lot of makeup that I felt was a waste of money, so I felt compelled to share it's magic with the readers. :D  If you are interested, it's here http://www.thescentedlife.com/i-tried-loreals-new-mascara-with-the-tubes/ but like I said, I'm pro tubes. 

I've decided to try dating again. I'm not officially broken-up with my boyfriend, but that's hard to do when he refuses to accept your phone calls, emails, or texts and he lives in the next state.  I wish that he would magically change back into the man that I love and if at some point he regains his footing, well that would be wonderful, but I've spent the last 11 months feeling confused and rejected. He's spent it lost behind a big wall.  When I am able to speak with him, I'll explain that I love him, but that I'm interested in something radically different from the heartache of the past year. Either he will yell at me and hang up (this has happened in the past) and I won't hear from him again, or he will yell at me, hang up and then talk to me after he's thought about what I've said (also happened before), or we can actually have a conversation where I am able to explain my point (what a wonderful surprise that would be!).  At any rate, I do not want to spend another holiday season mopping around. My kids do not deserve that. 

I went to see Twilight with my girlfriends last night. Jackie and I had previously read the book - Leah and Brionna had not. I sat in between the two non-readers. Their reactions were interesting. 

I don't want to spoil anyone, so if you do not want any clues about the movie, please skip my post. 
<lj-cut>

I liked it, but I was still a bit disappointed. I felt that too much was left out, making some of Edward's actions/reactions/expressions look just silly. Leah laughed through most of the movie - at the not supposed to be funny parts.  At first this bothered me, because I went in there really rooting for the movie. I liked the casting of Bella and Edward, the scenes that were shown in online teasers, the music, the look of the movie, etc. Then, I thought whatever..... if they screwed some of it up, then they screwed some of it up. I could not take it personally (yes, I know I'm odd). 

I feel that the things I did not like had to do with the directing. I like Catherine Hardiwicke - The Lords of Dogtown is one of my favorite movies. I felt that she Dogtowned this movie and it's not the same story at all. (Surfing?? Eric?? The girl from 13 and Dogtown as a blonde??) It had a California feel and as a native Californian, who has also lived in Washington, I know that they are very different states.  The Cullens were just plain odd - except for Alice, I felt that she fit. Why did she direct Jasper to walk around looking half terrified/half constipated? So weird. His eyes looked like Johnny Depp's in Edward Scissorhands. It was very distracting.

The movie, by not explaining things like why Edward acted the way he did until way later, felt as if it was written for readers, but it was still changed a lot story-wise. Why change it so much? Just details that made me go, ""well that's not in the book."" I leaned over and said this once to Brionna and then I thought, I cannot do this to her all night, and I did not say it again, out loud. Apparently her mom, Jackie, did.  Jackie said that we should have sat next to each other so that we could have shared our wtf looks. I think this feeling has happened in most of my loved books movies, with the exception of Harry Potter. I have never been disappointed by a Harry Potter movie.  

The movie was best in the kiss scene (made me cry - I think I was thinking about my own situation), the fight scene, the crash scene (this was great!!), the dad was great - really fleshed out as a character and the most natural acting actor in the story, Bella's hair (seriously - it was gorgeous), Edward's anything (that boy is beautiful), the band of bad guys, Alice, Bella's friends, and the setting was so beautiful (green is my favorite color). 

I did like the movie, but I think I went in with too many expectations. I think that a younger viewer (as I noticed while watching the movie, the young girls were giddy) would enjoy the movie more. I'm going to take the girls to see it - they will love Edward.  I'm definitely buying the soundtrack - the music was great. I'll buy the movie when it comes out. I just wish I had been able to tell the story my way, which is selfish and silly, I know, but sometimes I am selfish and silly."

"event","I found this today - The Most Irritating Phrases in the English Language -at Lemondrop. (http://www.lemondrop.com/2008/11/12/the-most-irritating-phrases-in-the-english-language/)  

I love words and I will be the first to admit that I do not always use them correctly and I like to think of myself as a nice person. That said, I have to admit that I enjoy it when another person uses a phrase incorrectly.  Most of the time. I do have my pet peeves. For example, I am no fan of ""brutal honesty"" and being ""politically correct,"" is not a sin, in my book - it's being polite. 

Here's an bit of the Lemondrop article: 

Misused/Mispronounced Phrases: irregardless (for ""regardless""), aggravate (for ""irritate""), anyways/towards (anyway, toward), for all intensive purposes (for ""for all intents and purposes""), suppose to (for ""supposed to""), could of (for ""could have""), analyzing/analyzation (for ""analysis""), literally (when meant figuratively).

""For all intents and purposes,"" that cracks me up. (Sure hope I never used that one.) 

I have looked up the proper way to use ""lay,"" ""laying,"" and ""lying"" twice lately.  I fear it is one last rule that my overflowing brain just cannot hold on to.  And the word ""just"" - I use that word over and over and over when I write. I have no idea why I love it so much and when I edit, I ""just"" have to go back and take the time to edit it out. Grr on that word. I wish my brain would ""just"" reject it completely. Unless I'm thinking in terms of fairness, then I'm all for being just."

"event","Happy Saturday to you. Had a scary fever situation with Max, but he appears to be on the mend after two antibiotic shots from the doc yesterday. He was up to 103.4 F. Yikes. Steve was here visiting and able to go fetch me (in the middle of the night) some additional fever reducer to get Max under control. It took both ibuprofen and acetimenaphon to get his fever down to 102, then 100.  

Now I'm going to be quick because I need to get to Max, but I wanted to share with you that if you go to my http://www.thescentedlife.com blog, then you will find links to two different Beauty and Style Channel giveaways. One is for a bag with $180 of skin care and the other is for a $50 AZJeans gift certificate.  

It appears that we have a lot of great products coming through the channel. I will let you guys know when giveaways come up, because who doesn't like free stuff?  I have some perfume in route to me right now - a new Vera Wang fragrance - and I am so excited. The lady who contacted me, she is sending all this press stuff with it.  Does this mean that I am a member of The Press?  Does this also mean that as a Liberal, I am a member of the hated Liberal Media? Okay, you might not be laughing, but I crack myself up.  And to be honest, I did express my disgust with California's Measure 8 passing over at Dating Dames.com.  Very, very upseting.   

Free stuff!  Okay, maybe it's sad that I am that excited, but a gal has to have something to look forward to. ;D"

I keep trying to get ahead and I can barely keep from falling further behind. I got another blogging job - this is for a perfume blog called The Scented Life - but my company has changed the way they count stats and I will make less money than I would have a month ago.  I did sell my first photo.  To my sister........ someone emailed and asked if I will be offering it in an 8x10. I need to see about that. I am so tired of worrying about money.  

How is everyone else? I'm off to look at my friend's list."

"event","Fall is beginning to settle in here. I had to turn on the heater for a few minutes before I got Max into the bath.  We've had some high winds, so I had to put all my potted plants - including the trees - into safer places for a few days.  My skin feels all crispy.  

I set up an Etsy shop with one photo in there.  If you are interested, it's at www.chaseyourbliss.etsy.com  I'm calling my business Chase Your Bliss Photography.  As soon as the trees start to change at the park, I'm taking Bay and her friend Kimm out there for some faux Senior photos. I want something for my portfolio. I still need to get a faux wedding party shot - well, my two girls fancied up - for it, as well. I need to make a to-do list........

Max turns 18 in a couple of weeks. Wow.  Again, I need a to-do list, have to get his affairs in order.  

Today I have a post up at Dating Dames that is part of Blogtoberfest. If you leave a comment, you may win a prize.  It's at http://www.datingdames.com/i-do-not-suck/

Has anyone read ""Eat, Pray, Love""?  I'm reading it now. I really like it.  I'm currently in the part where she talks about meditation and how hard it is. I've always found it challenging and I give up after a few minutes.  I have fallen asleep in yoga class before, during the ending meditation. Maybe I need to do more yoga?

"event","It's raining!  I mean, raining, raining.  Not a whole lot of dramatic clouds bringing the threat of rain that only ends up being a couple drops, but real rain.  

I can't remember the last day it really rained.  Possibly last April, maybe May.  You should see how curly my hair is. 

I feel like it's scrubbing the air so that I can finally breathe.  Max, too. I can see him right now, he's listening to the sound of the rain - the dripping, the cars moving through the puddles outside, and there's also a breeze ruffling the leaves.  

Lovely beginning to the weekend.

After I jumped, I fell to one knee.  When I got home, I told Bay about it.  She said, oh no, were there people around? did anyone see you?  

Well, maybe, but I don't have to worry about that stuff, I explained, I am not a teenager.  Thank goodness. Sarah doesn't have to worry either.  She jumped off that ledge for me over and over.  She was a trooper."

Sarah had so much fun.  She took a lot of shots of the sky, the trees, some flowers.  It was fun to watch her get so excited about what she was creating.  

I""m currently watching ""Fringe.""  It's pretty good so far.  It's supposed to be very unlike ""Lost,"" but it has a similar feel to it.  The music, that might have something to do with that.  Some of it feels right out of Lost.  I like Joshua Jackson. I was always a big Pacey fan."

Today we've been watching Ice Road Truckers from the History channel.  Wow.  Have you ever watched it?  I thought that they road over icy roads, but no, it's over WATER.  They are driving over a frozen river and the Artic Ocean.  They set up this temporary town, then when the season is over, they have to truck the ""town"" back out, including any ""dirty"" snow.

Sometimes I watch shows like Ice Road Truckers or Deadliest Catch and they make me so happy that my man sells cars."

I changed out my air filter and saw next to no difference, but a couple of days ago I checked my tire pressure and added some air.  I now notice a 25% increase in efficiency.  Yay!!

"event","I love my computer.  I spent a lot of years sort of semi-hiding out and it's helped me to branch out slowly, to fill my world with new people and experiences as I've felt ready to take them on.  It's brought me jobs, my writing, helpful information in so many areas, entertainment, my photography, closer bonds with my family, my boyfriend, and a lot of friends that I may never see in person, but who I care about as much as the friends I see every day.  

One of those friends is going through something right now.  She's been on my mind ever since I read that she was hurting last night.  I've been through something like what she's going through, a lot of us have been through it, but still when I tried to think of something helpful to say, I felt that I stumbled.  I know I can't fix it, but I'd sure like to ease her pain a bit.  So, I turned to my computer and used it for what I love best - information.  I researched and wrote and just in case you are in need of it, I wrote this today How To Heal A Broken Heart  for my column over at Dating Dames.  

I found that a lot of the advice out there is what comes naturally. Cry if you need to cry, laugh when you feel you are able, and eventually you are going to be okay.  Too bad there is no quick fix.  Wouldn't that be wonderful?  A pill or a vitamin that would fix it?  

Another friend, this one from high school, also brought back to me through my computer, came down from her mountain home to visit last week.  Her ex-husband got married the day before and she was having a hard time with it, as they'd been seeing each other just this past Spring.  He met a lady and married her in just a couple of months.  All weekend they sent her nasty texts on her cell phone.  In fact, they are still texting her over and over, which I find really odd.  Is that the way you would want to spend your first week of marriage?  Not me.  Anyway, she came over and we went to the creek.  There's something about that creek, or maybe it's all water, it soothes.  She told me today that she wishes that the creek was right outside her door.  

Okay, time to run out to the pharmacy - two pharmacies actually.  I hope that you are enjoying your Saturday."

I saw something about this over at www.shuttersisters.com  You use a slow aperture (shutter speed) and this is what you get - a twirly girl who looks a bit like a ghost.  I can't wait to try it outside - I always do better with the outdoor stuff."

I have been able to spend an hour at the creek - both wed and thurs.  Wonderful break.  I wrote about some of my online pals and my daughter Bay's confidence in the face of single-dom, in case you care to read about either subject over at www.datingdames.com  I have a new co-blogger there and she is very knowledgeable.  I have learned a lot from her in just a day.  Smart girl.  

I colored my hair tonight - covered my highlights.  Tomorrow is picture day at school and I need a new id photo.  It's pretty dark - the girls both said, ""black.""  It's not black, only a medium brown, but they are used to my fairly red Summer 'do.  I love haircolor and the quick change it gives you.  I used to enjoy seeing Diana's green hair photos.  They reminded me of the days back when I was orange from henna.  

I keep sneezing.  I don't know what it is, but Max is all messed up and he was coughing from whatever it is so hard that he barfed tonight. It took me an hour to feed him and the whole thing was back up in about 30 seconds.  Damn.  He's sleeping peacefully now.  Smart kid. I think it's time for me to go to bed as well.

That's me above, saying goodbye to the creek for the Summer. :(  

Today was the first day back to school and it was hectic.  We had a big budget crisis and everything feels like it's been switched around.  For example - the ladies that have worked our kitchen for years are GONE.  They are at another school, well two different schools. The ladies we had today, they didn't know our serving system and the computer system was not ready.  I'm sure it was a nightmare for the new lady, but you know, at the end of the day, she was making jokes and smiling.  I think she's going to be great.  

We have lots of new faces at our school, I'm told in part because of some small rural school closures. I sure hope that those kids feel comfortable. I can remember being a new kid over and over and over and over.  Some places were welcoming and some I never found a friend before we moved again.  I am going to not allow myself to get caught up in the hectic tomorrow and really make a point to smile at each and every student.  Including the sixth graders, even though I have dreaded the day they became sixth graders since back when they were in grade three.  (Seriously, they are a charming, but really naughty group).  

I got my first pay check (or pay pal payment) from my new writing job. I'm really enjoying it so far.  The girl I was partners with has quit and they are hiring a new writer, but I like having it to myself right now.  I've covered online dating, John Edwards Affair, a few stories about my boyfriend (one entitled ""Sometimes There Is A Jackass), the huge number of weddings in China on 08/08/08, among a couple of others that are escaping my really tired brain right now. The John Edwards story started a little comment war between a couple of the ladies who write for the company.  Fine with me, that means they are clicking on my page and increasing my $$.  :D  My friend, Eliza, wrote a piece on Kate's bag of John and Kate Plus 8 back this Spring and it's still getting comments.  She has 39.  That Kate, I had no idea how controversial she was.  

In writing my datingdames.com column, I've noticed that people are really having a prejudice against online dating and no amount of me saying, ""hey, you've got to take some time and weed out the bad ones"" seems to sink in to my readers.  Would any of you who have used online dating be interested in allowing me to interview you?  I would really appreciate it, especially if you've found some success *cough* perhaps you Nebraska ladies *cough*. I promise to make the interview process as painless and quick as possible. 

Time to feed Max. Night!"

I had a wonderful weekend with my niece and nephews. I got to keep them while my sister and her husband went up North for his high school reunion.  

We went to the creek, as you can see from the picture of Casey above, and we went to a concert in the park, on a walk through the lovely CSUC campus, swimming at the pool, watched lots of the Olympics, and I gave out lots of back rubs.  It was wonderful and the perfect way to end the Summer, as we go back to school in a couple of days. 

Two of my girlfriends took me out to dinner on Saturday.  One is a friend from jr high and one is a friend from high school.  We had a great time talking.  They are good friends - both then and now.  I am very lucky."

I made a new box for ttv-ing.  Then, I took it and my cameras out front.  I need to drive a bit, get outside my neighborhood.  All my shots are looking the same.  When the kids go back to school, I'll have more time.  We go back next Wednesay. Bay goes back on the 18th.  

I took this shot below at the mall last night.  Does anyone know what makes the lights do that?  A mall security guy drove up and gave me a lecture, even though I was not even pointed at his mall - it was at my back, it's a different shopping center in the picture.  He said that the signs are copyrighted, so you can't even take a photo of something like the JcPenny's sign.

I am so out of it right now.  I am not organized and I have no energy. I don't know what is wrong with me.  I skipped my run yesterday and I'm dreading doing it today.  My joints hurt - my ankles, knees, my shoulders, my wrists.  I know I'll feel better after I run.  That's the part I need to keep telling myself."

My sister is here for a visit with her family.  Right now I'm sitting in the living room listening to the kids play SS Tricky.  Before that it was James Bond.  It's a little smokey out, so the kids are hanging around the house.  

Steve might be coming Saturday night, early Sunday morning, with Owen.  He had to cancel his last trip because the big kids had plans.  I haven't seen him in a long time....2 months, I think, this time.  

I started a new job.  I am writing for a column called Dating Dames, along with another girl.  You can find it at www.datingdames.com if you are intersted. I'm pretty excited about this.  My friend, Eliza, was showing me where to look up top keywords that lead people to your site and the top 3 were 1) dating, 2) Heath, and 3) Ledger.  There so many tools out there that I'm unaware of. Hopefully my brain can contain at least some of it. 

I had a job interview at a Life Insurance company last week. I'm going for my second interview next week.  I'm not sure that this is something that I want to pursue, they contacted me when they saw my resume online, but I'm interested in seeing if they offer me something.  I'll decide after I hear about it.  I have to be flexible for Max, that's the most important thing."

"event","Duncan brought this dragonfly to the door to show me last night. This is the second one he's brought by.  I've tried to get them - with my camera - on my own, but the light and the contrast are never right for a good shot.  I like this one - his hand and the dragonflies wings next to it.  The dragonfly is missing a leg, not sure if that's apparent in this shot, and as soon as we were done, he took off and flew away.

I'm having a pretty good weekend.  I restarted my food blog, but at a different place - it's now http://www.acooksbounty.blogspot.com and I'll have to update the link I have to the right over there.  It's easier for me to naviagate blogspot than wordpress for some reason. Not sure why. I joined a new group at flickr - a bokeh group.  Have you heard of bokeh before?  There's a bit of bokeh in the dragonfly photo - the are that is out of focus and round-looking.  I got some okay shots this weekend, some insects.  I got the dragonfly, a praying mantis, and a bee.  I like bugs.  Not flies or mosquitoes, though.  I also found two caterpillars when I was working in my garden.  Hhmm, not sure why I didn't take picures of them.  

Steve is enjoying his new job - he started on Thursday.  He sold a red, convertible mustang yesterday and was in good spirits.  He wants me to go up to Bend to see Beck with him August.  I'd like to do it, but I was planning to do a Century ride (a shorter version) up in Yreka (our hometown) around that time. Not sure I can manage both.  I like Beck, but mostly I like Steve and he's never invited me up for something like that before.  

I suspect that the peaceful feeling I've got going on right now is due in part to two things - 1) No fighting with Bay this weekend and 2) My boyfriend seems to be doing better. I've got to find a way to love him and support him, but still seperate myself a bit when he's unable to connect.  It's too hard to survive the bad times otherwise.   I can't make him well or make him make sense when he's having trouble.  I end up feeling worthless and crazy.  I can't dismiss him either, because the happiest I've ever been are the good times we've had - both now and when we were kids.  The trouble he has, it's only one part of him, it's not all of him.  He's complicated, but then so am I, I suppose.  It's hard to be a human. 

Bay is happy or at least calm this weekend.  Not sure why, but yay!!!!!!!

Does anyone watch ""In Plain Sight,"" on the USA network?  It's on tonight - a good show about a woman who is a US Marshall, working with people in the witness protection program.  Right now, I think that the USA network is the strongest when it comes to quality dramas.  I think I talked about this yesterday, as well.  Oops.  My too-much-tv is showing."

"event","My grandpa died this morning.  He was a really, really good Grandpa.  He had cancer for a long time.  He used to be a tugboat captain down out of Long Beach, in Southern California.  Then, he moved up to Copco Lake and he owned and operated a carpet cleaning business until he was about 80 years old - he might have actually been over 80, I'm a bit upset and not clear on the details at the moment.  When I went to town with him, he knew more people than I did and I'm the one who actually lived IN town.  My grandpa taught me how to swim, how to ride a two-wheel bike, how to fish, how to squirt water through a hole between my pressed-together palms.  He used to make jokes to distract me when I got hurt, said things like, ""Look at that!  You put that big crack in the sidewalk!""  He used to tell me stories about being at sea - I especially remember the one about the monkey with greased tail and about how scary it was when they were with the fuel tankers during the War.  He called himself the ""old goat,"" and he called Santa, ""Santy-hooks.""  Don't know where he got that one.  He did this little dance thing, where he put out one heel and sort of swiveled with his arms out and do this little Grandpa sound.  He gave big, big hugs and his cheek felt both smooth and prickily next to mine.  I used to cut his hair and it was really soft, like a baby's hair, which always surprised me because he put this hairdressing (Four Fingers?  Three Fingers, something like that)on it that kept it in place.  When he smiled there were deep crinkles next to his eyes and he sparkled.  I'm serious, he really sparkled.  Grandpa was my height - 5'4"".  He had a permanent tan and a smudgy tattoo of a harbor on his shoulder.  He was a great diver - did a perfect jack-knife, then slide across to the other side of the pool, under the surface.  He loved to watch sports.  He helped anybody and everybody who ever needed any help, at any time.  People would get stuck up on the low spot on the lake where he lived and he'd head down to his boat, help them out.  He was like my dad for the first part of my life - we lived with him and Grandma off and on for a long time.  He smelled really good and he wore white t-shirts and blue jeans and cute running shoe sneakers.  I haven't seen him in a few years, he moved up to Washington and I only made it up there once.  I still thought about him all the time, the girls still talked about him regularly.  Even in his absence he was a big part of our daily lives.  He was fun and funny and warm and loving.  He loved my grandma so much.  He was a really, really good Grandpa."

"event","Today, Sarah and I went on a search for a box camera.  Something like this: http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Hall/5912/duaiv4.gif  We went to 5 stores before I found two - a Kodah Duraflex and an Argoflex.  They are both so cool.  You hold them against your chest and look down into the viewfinder. I am using them for the lense, I don't even know if the cameras will work yet. I built a tube to keep the light out, then I pointed my Nikon D40 down the tube to take a photo.  It's called Through the Viewfinder.  The photos turn out aged and weathered looking, due to the dust on the lenses. They are square in shape and have a black ""frame"" around them.  Actually, you end up with a photo of the interior of the tube, the top of the Duraflex, and then the ""shot"" in the center.  You can straighten, then crop the photo.  It's really a fun process. I got a couple of decent photos today. I'm going to work on a better tube system tomorrow.

I was goofing around, trying to use my windshield as a polarizer.  I kind of like it. 

Pretty good day, here. I met my friend, Jackie, from high school, for coffee.  She was in town running some errands.  I talk to her on the computer all the time, but this is the first time I've seen her in person in about 15 years. It was so fun to talk - I hope we can get together again soon."

"event","Today was a pretty good day.  Right now I'm sitting on my patio and I've got a fire in my little fire-thingy.  I'm drinking a Sierra Nevada and daydreaming about what I'm always daydreaming about lately - a new camera.  So many things are not great - my daughter's grades, my son's allergies, Sarah's changing attitude, my boyfriend's jack-ass-ery, but I still feel pretty good.  I feel like there are some better times ahead and I'm nearing a jumping off point.  Not a bad jumping off point, but the kind like when I was a kid and we'd jump into the Klamath River off the bridge. Very exciting.  

Here's my favorite shot of the day. Sarah in the pool.

I am so excited about tomorrow. Maybe next year I'll do the 60 mile ride. :D Here's a look at my swag.  The bandana is a map of the course.  It's pretty cool.  I have a copy of it over at my askewtoyou blog, if you want to see it.  I think I folded about 800 of them today.

Chico is a big tree town, but we also have this huge sky.  I don't know if it's because we are in a valley or what, but it feels endless and it's frequently dramatic.  

My event is in 4 days and I am beginning to feel a little nervous.  I believe that a good part of what is going to carry me through is simple excitement to be taking part.  I have never been out there by the river road on my bike.  I can't wait to take some pictures.  I can't wait to be riding with the crowd - that's going to be a very different experience.  I hope I don't crash.  

I picked up some biking shorts today.  They are pretty important, I gather.  They pad your seat and cut down on chafing.  I'm a fan of chafe-cutdown.  They feel funny - I wore them on a ride today.  Bay kept saying, it's like a diaper, but it's not really.  It's like a pad, because it IS a pad.  It killed me to pay so much for them, but I want to get involved in the local riding club, and I am sure they will pay for themselves in less-sore-butt-ness."

I have been off for a few days.. but we have been spending a lot of time in front of the TV watching the first season of Dead Like Me.  I have not enjoyed a series that much in a long time.  Amelia bought the 2nd season.. So now we have more to watch.  
I hope I see you around soon.  Don't get the bird flu."

"event","If I have a live journal and I don't post anything, am I really alive?  Am I a figment of my imagination?  
Sometimes I have not the slightest idea what to write.  I enjoyed going to the AR cafe with Amelia and Jamie today.  
Nice skirt today Jamie.. I liked the green ruffles.  
I brought my painting of Lori home today.  I hope I can finish it this weekend.  
ok.. thats all for now.  going to go sit on the ceiling fan and spin for a while."

"event","I am at work.. it never occurred to me that I could log in and ramble here. The mountains?  Which mountains?  Would you bring a tent?  you should bring snowshoes. I read in an article that some people were attacked by river otters while swimming in a mountain lake.  Can you imagine, there you are all alone swimming in your remote mountain lake and you emerge from the lake like venus on the half-shell, except you are covered in otters, nibbling away at your skin like chipmunks, only bigger..  They find you juicy and delicious. You narrowly escape by yelling Fire and they all skitter away to safety.. You get away and while wandering in the woods in a river otter daze you are captured by sasquach. He brings you to his rancid cave and makes you his servant.  It turns out not to be too bad. While he does smell bad and is hairy, he is kind and brings you presents of dead river otters. Eventually Sasquach is spotted and captured and sent to a zoo in seattle. You are broken hearted.. You are taken in  by a lumberjack in the area and he gives you a homemade bearskin cap and a heavy flannel shirt, and oh yes.. some heavy boots. He teaches you the lumberjack trade and eventually gives you your very own axe.. After a while of lumberjacking, you decide to come back to Sacramento.. You write a book about your adventures and it becomes a bestseller. You become rich and buy a large  but remote home which you have furnished like a sasquach cave.  you try to recapture the good old days.. You hire big hairy men to lumber around and squash river otters but it isnt the same.. You send them away and take to modeling for one of the better local artists. People recognize you in the galleries from the picture on the back cover of your book.  You are invited to the talk show circuit and appear on Regis and Kelly. You bring complimentary copies of your book and a couple of homemade bearskin caps and gifts.  you are a big hit. Hollywood wants to make a movie of your story. They make the movie and it is a box office smash hit. Unfortunately, your agent makes off with all your fortunes and disappears into the mountains and you are back to where you were, struggling to make a living in a place you don't want to be.  On the bright side.. you agent was eaten by river otters and his remains were found by another sasquatch and his remaining skin was made into a homemade cap. thats Karma for ya.  
I am so sleepy. sometimes its hard to stay awake at work. 2.5 hours to go.. see you online. or in the mountains.. or on TV.. or in a gallery."

sometimes I feel close and sometimes distant..  
sometimes I am full of bullshit.  
no.. not really.. I try to be truthful and sincere. 
its not that.. the bullshit.. what is the bullshit?

"event","I touched the warm sculpture.. she felt alive
I took the broken pieces and tried to put them back. 
she looked like an angel with her wings ripped off. 
she got cooler and cooler and was finally cold to the touch. 
I didn't kill her.. I was trying to give her life.
I glazed her and put her broken body back into the fire.. 
I glazed the pieces and put them around her. 
another day.. two days."

"event","Home at last.  The house is quiet.  
Sat to write.  why not try it. 
I am looking at a glass jar, it is empty
There is a magnifying glass next to it that I have had for years.
I still use it. 
I wonder if I ever burnt anything with it.. probably.
I need to paint.  I need to find a picture to paint on Monday on the fresco. 
Something simple that I can finish while the lime is wet. 
On a tile, perhaps a single flower.. something with nice lines and shades. 
whatever.  I guess I am not in the mood to type.  
good night"

"event","It was a very long day.  I just got home from work.  Remember class this afternoon?  I went home. got my work stuff and headed back out the door.  It's always good to see my friends at work.. but it is still work.  
fresco... it's a blizzard.  yes yes. I know. its Fresca.. so what.  I just keep thinking of it that way.. 
Do you know what Fresca is?  It is a gross drink... I never liked it.  And it was a diet drink.. so it had that ratty artificial sweetener flavor as well. 
ok. maybe I better go play or something.  
see you tomorrow.."

Pruney.. Balloony..  laugh at me.  do it.. do it now.  do it again.
Lets go have a drink.  2 drinks..  not beer. 
Actually, a hot chocolate from rick's dessert diner sounds really good. 
Sherry bought me a pair of boxers.. they have cowboys on them.  she calls them my brokebacks..  I wonder why she does that.  She is teasing me.  
If I had a studio, I would be in it right now.  I hate trying to paint in a makeshift place that I have to fold up and put away after a bit..  
brokebacks?  Is she implying something?  hahahaha.. 
I saw you today.  I wanted to stop in but I was in such a hurry. I could not justify stopping and sitting around chatting.  
When I am blue..   I make sure I have not forgotten to breath.. if I am the other kind of blue.. well, I don't know. it passes.  
are we there yet?"

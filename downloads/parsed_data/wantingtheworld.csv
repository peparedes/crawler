"event","so, a lot of pressing questions to be answered. 

here i go.

Well to start off, i am really in love... with someone whom i know will never EVER hurt me in anyway shape or form... and his name is Christopher R. Fields.&nbsp; 

I know that this is the real thing because he has proven himself.. not a whore. And i know that he will be there for me whenever i need help. He will never hurt me.

You have hurt me soo many times. That is one of the reason i don't feel for you at all. I have been hurt and it sucks. I know you will say i hurt you...&nbsp; but really...&nbsp; how did I?&nbsp;&nbsp; I went out with someone else besides you? Or what?&nbsp;&nbsp; yeah you had your chance... and it seems to me that you blew it..

You did stuff with loads of other girls, me included... then you swore up and down that you liked me soooo much you would never do such a thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; LIE!&nbsp; over and over again.&nbsp; I bet you are going to come back at me saying that when i was still kind of.. seeing reece, i did stuff with you.&nbsp; BIG MISTAKE on my part. 

Now that i look at it.. i wish last year never happened because of all the shit everyone put me through.&nbsp; IT SUCKED thank you very much. 

Bottom line is.. 

Yes i liked you once... but not anymore. I am in love. REAL LOVE, i am actually happy.. i am not worrying about anything. 
I am not! Chris and I are making a big commitment together, him going with me to San Francisco. Nothing will change that. 




I am in love.. and i have moved on major.


It is about time for you to do the same....

I know that this hurts, but sorry, it is the truth."

Where i am left?    All i know is that i AM left with nothing.  That is great... I have nothing.. left in the middle of no where.

Know the feeling? 

I missing something great. I shouldnt have done the things i did. I shouldnt have listened to myself. 


WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN TO ME..... 

why? 


I cant run from anything anymore. It is like a nitemare... when you cant runaway from something bad (monsters and what not) because you arent running fast enough. You cant run fast, no matter how hard you try... 

i am running as fast as i can.. and still... my problems cant seem to leave me alone. I have no where to hid. 


I just want you..  to be with me right now. 


i miss you. 




you should know who you are.

I dont even know if i can believe anymore. I am trying to wish this all away, but everytime i look up to the sky, the stars are always covered up by clouds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It hurts to be honest to the one you love.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I want to believe so hard, but this wish isnt happening. My fairy tale end is destroyed and i dont think i can even see the ending of this nightmare. All i want to do is run or jump into someone's good dream and live there. I cannot take this lie inside, i cannot take this feeling that i did something wrong and i cant fix it anymore. Finally, something i cannot change... i have no control and that is the reason why i feel so.... wrong.
You were my angel behind that mask of perversness. You were my light even though all i wanted to see was dark. You were my happiness when i felt like i was going to die.&nbsp;
I dont understand this feeling.&nbsp; I want to love you like you do me, but something in me is warning me and telling me i shouldnt. i am not ready to love someone yet because i still love a man who flew away from me.&nbsp; It just takes time they say, but this feeling will always be the same.&nbsp; I will never love you the way i love him. And it hurts to say this at all. It just hurts.&nbsp;"

"event","I dont know what to do. I am stuck in this battle of feelings.&nbsp; I dont know what i want. All i know is that i dont want to get serious with anyone.. well at least not yet. 
I dont want to experience love, because all i learned from it is that sometimes it is a dead feeling.&nbsp; 
I cant control who i want to be with. I really really like someone, but then .. there is someone else who i really like. the thing is.. i think that i like someone more than the other. And i dont know. I just dont want anyone to get hurt. And i know the place i am in right now, someone is going&nbsp; to. AND I DONT WANT IT TO HAPPEN. i just dont know how to stop it from happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

I feel gross....&nbsp; 


So once, a long while ago, i thought i loved someone. And when i told them, it seemed to make them distant from me. And it hurt me more than anything.&nbsp; To know that i just poured my emotions out on a plate, and then turned down like some over cooked food. I am not sure what is real anymore and what is pretend. I dont want to do this anymore.&nbsp; 


Once in a short while ago, I reunited with a boy. He is amazing and always has been. I thought we hit it off right then and there. (at the movies when i was kind of on date with someone else.)&nbsp; But yeah, we started to hang out like crazzy, nothing to serious or anything. then, the climax. He told me that he really liked me, i told him i that i really liked him. and that night we fell asleep in each others arms.&nbsp; that next day was a whole mess..&nbsp; turns out, his ex wanted to hang out, they were at the same party i was at.. he failed to even say hi to me. THAT hurt me the most... (you know the whole night i felt so used and worthless.)&nbsp;

But later, he told me how sorry he was and how messed up his ex was. (not to mention how crazy.) And i forgave him.. and lately he has been letting me know in small amounts how much he truely likes me. And t, oh i dont know.. it is just cute. I like him.&nbsp;

so yeah... basically, i dont want to be in a relationship right now. As you can tel... i have some trust issues, and i guess i just dont feel to comfortable with myself to actually make a small commitment of any sort. Right now the only pressing matter at hand are:
The Phantom Toll Booth
Auditions for Tewlfth Night
Log
Showcase
and.. My awesome 18th b-day party my awesome friends are throwing for me.&nbsp;


and i like what i have right now.. with everyone.
Friendships are the most important thing a girl can ever ask for."

I like the idea of me now. But i dont want to see what is going to come next?&nbsp;


Not drugs. I refuse.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I guess it is so hard to compete with myself. That is all i seem to be doing to myself. Trying to make myself thinner, taller, prettier, and just.. better. You know... so someone would take a keen notice to me. I do this to myself, but i lie about it to myself. I tell myself, ""I love being single."" but in real life.. i am dying to be with someone. I know this is silly.

I have reece.

WRONG.&nbsp;He is just my friend. i love him to death, but i am not inlove with him. at least not anymore.

I have Chris.

RIGHT.. but wrong. HE is there,&nbsp; but he cannot be there for me all the time. I mean, he has graduated high school. He has a job. and he doesnt have a car currently. It sucks. It would be ok, if my car was fixed and my family wasnt crazy. I like him a lot.&nbsp;

I have Ben.

RIGHT, but i guess it is just so hard to go back to him. I like that kid to death. but i guess my Wall of Anit-hurt is forming up. I guess i am too afriad that i might get hurt again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

See i am torn. I dont know what to do anymore. Sure i can not think about it. BUT NOT THINKING about it is driving me crazy.&nbsp;

i just want to be held. right now.&nbsp;

I look at all the people i know now.. and i try to see myself spending the rest of my life with them. It is wierd i know.. but i think the truth is out. I dont i could marry anyone here. Oh well.. damn it all. 

So yes. Drunken party, FUN!  I went over to Kyle Battin's appartment not too long ago.. and there was a huge party. It was fun. 
I got wasted. That was the best. Ryan Weise was there. ohh my goodness. he was all trying to get up on my grill. (haha i sounded ghetto) But yeah.. then Chris kept getting pissed at me for letting Ryan hit on me.  But he should have known better that the only Person i wanted to be with was him (chris that is). And i told him that too!.  :D  He got Jealous!   Awwwwwwwwwwwww. I think that is the sweetest thing in the world when a guy gets jealous over a girl.  It proves they like them. hehehehe 
Yeah anyways... chris and i got drunk some more.. and well.. we were talking. And it was like everything came out at once.  

the truth. 

Chris likes me. I like Chirs.
   
But we are too goddman stupid to do anything about it. 
Shelly Tells me all the time that we really like each other.. but we both are so affriad of each other. we dont want to get hurt. And i guess that is our only flaw.. i think. Yeah... i dont know.

first there is The Christopher situation. I dont know what is going on. Everytime i give up on him,&nbsp;something happends or i hear something that makes me rethink my thoughts, and makes me wonder if he actually does care for me or not.&nbsp; So, basically, i am between a rock and a hard spot. And it is not a very comfortable situation to be in. I guess it is just .. crazy.&nbsp;

So on myspace i always post the.. (i hate boys) or the (I love boys), pretty often. That is to show everyone the craziness of what i feel. Only a few people actually notice. But it is ok. I like doing it. It lets boys know when to back off for a bit, and when to come to me.&nbsp;

No more secret lovers.. I cannot stand it anymore. No&nbsp; more being used, and no more being abused.. emotionaly. I just cannot stand it.&nbsp; SO yeah. i am liking one guy right now, and sticking to it. (Even if he is the worst type to even play around with) I dont care.&nbsp;

I have been thinking an awful lot about.. well an ex boyfriend. I dont know why. But i just am remembering all the fun things we did. Like.. i dont know.. watch movies, hang out, go to shows..hang out. I dont know.. but i guess i miss it. It was so innocent. We never did anything bad. I remember.. he lived soo far away from me.. and he would ask his cool friends to drive him over to see me, OR to come over to pick me up.I even remember getting really excited to talk to him on MSN. And how fun it was to talk to him over MSN.  I remember.. my phone being stupid.. and he having to ask me out over MSN.. hahahah.. oh the things i remember..hahah silly!I dont know.. I guess the age of innocence is lost. But i remember those times.. i do. And even though it didnt seem much at the time.. it kind of does now.."

"event","So.. i went to this stupid party thing up at the sailing club in Geist. let's see i went up there alone, and was alone for about 5 hours. Then My mom made three swimmers from the Lawernce North high school swim team. I dont remember all there names.. but my mom was trying to hook me up with their friend named Andrew.. (Met him finally, and turns out he is the biggest jerk in the world.) but yeah.. so i got to hanging out with one of the 3 swimmers and found out that he is a pretty cool kid, his name is Mike. He invited me over from my little hang out group to his. Everyone was wasted almost.. but not mike.. so us two kind of went away from the other group and just hung out and talked about school and stuff. He is pretty cool. So yay! i have more friends up in indy!!!  yay!!
Sadness...
No movie party with Sean today.. :(
Yayness....
Ben is back from Europe!"

Where i am torn between two loves. one is pure, simple, and loving... and the other is  Caring, compassion, and strength. I am torn because the two combined make up.. what i love in a person. I dont know why my mind is reeling on this again. I thought it was over.. I thought it was dead.. I thought he moved on. I THOUGHT HE MOVED ON."

I saw X-Men 3 uhh twice. Both in the same day.  one at the 11am showing and then on at the 9:50 showing. One with Sean and the other with reece. That was fun though. 
OH! Reece's suprise party was awesome. Everyone showed up! It was crazy. Then i went over to Seans house and swan in his heated indoor pool. Yeah that was fun. Reece was there so it kind of killed the mood because he was being a baby. Oh well. It was ok. I still had fun though. REECE Had the most fun!
Thanks for everyone who went. WE all had a blast. I think...

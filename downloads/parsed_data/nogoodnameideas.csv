"event","so, i dont use this very much. but no one's home right now and it's late and i'm bored.

i've been thinking a lot about drinking lately.
i had to read this book called ""from binge to blackout"" for my public health class. it's about a kid who's alcohol behaviors from highschool and college turn into alcoholic behaviors in his adulthood.  it's an important narrative, i think, for young people everywhere.
so after reading the book i've been contemplating not drinking anymore. i remember when mel wanted to stop drinking and how bummed i was, not because we drank all the time but because i thought she'd be missing out on all the fun lolzzz. 
but there's not a lot of fun in throwing up in my brothers car, not being able to drive myself, throwing up in the boy i'm seeing's car, sleeping the entire next day, acting stupid. oh sure, i ""let myself go"" and ""loosen up"" when i drink, but fuck that man. i could be reading a book, bettering my life, rather than binge drinking and destroying my body. binge drinking is very detrimentalto women's bodies, it erodes our bones much faster than mens.
i'm in college to get an education, not build an inappropriate relationship with drugs and alcohol.
i dont think i'll give up drinking forever, but moderation is key. what's so wrong with having a few beers, and not geting WASTED BROOOOOOO KEG STANDDDDDDD TAKE OFF YOUR SHIRTTTT I JUST FELL DOWN THE STAIRSSS, get it ?
i like the way beer tastes, but i dont like being drunk anymore.
maybe i've grown up, maybe i'm thinking too much.
but i'm really sick of accepting that ""it's college, everyone does it"".  because stastically, there are going to be some frat dudes or girls that are so happy to be away from their parents that they drink themselves into oblivion five nights a week, that turn into alcoholics. 
and that's not what college is all about.

i'm sad for cory lidle and the other person in the plane.
they keep saying that there is no sign of terrorism, i mean, it was a yankee who was flying the plane. a yankee wouldn't commit acts of terrorism.
anyway, so there is no sign of terrorism yet fighter planes were deployed in several major US cities. 
why does the government have to instill fear in us like that. it's bad enough a plane crashed into a building, bad enough the yankee died, bad enough the pictures were really reminiscent of 9/11. and then they have to tell us it isnt terrorism but do actions which completely take away our feelings of safety.

update: i had the most fun this summer in washington with kyle. we got caught in the rain and walked miles and ate really good food. i love it there. i hung out with mel a lot, and worked a lot, and went to school a lot, and shopped a lot. 


i thought i was ready to go back to school but now that i'm here i'm not. i dont like my roommates i dont like the location i dont like that i'm the only that cleans i dont like that they yell at me sometimes. i'm not 'one of the guys' and i dont want to smoke weed all the time. i have homework to do and good grades to earn and parents to make proud. 

i miss home, my parents, my cat, peoria. and i know i dont have very many friends there and that i didnt hang out a lot this summer but that's home. this isn't home. people use my bathroom a lot and i have to sleep with ear plugs in. it always smells like pot and i'm the only one that knows how to use a dishwasher. i dont eat anymore because i dont know how to cook, but i'm not hungry either.

i'm turning into the person i'm going to be, and i dont know if i like that melanie yet. i'm so high strung and focused, i think i need to balance more. who knows, who cares. life goes on, time moves forward whether you want it to or not, things come at you without notice. i need to learn how to deal.

listen to me whine. l8r everyone."

typical weekend, me and michelle being drunk at heckers frat.
or it could be at a house party.
either way, i like college again. this weekend was fantastic.

the house is so nice, and i can't wait to move in.
they boys want to call it thug mansion.
no way !

i'm in the process of making a meeting with the head of human resources at planned parenthood.
i would like to work there when i grow up, and i hope that i can learn what major would be best suited and all that jazz.
i'm really excited about that, planned parenthood would be my dream job.

i have a lot of meetings with advisors coming up too.
maybe i can pick a major before may. 

spring break will be spent working, i have less than $200 to my name right now.
it's ok though, food is free and so is beer.

i miss mel and my family, 
my friend micah told me that zak morris once said, ""college is great, too bad classes get in the way""
true story.

"event","it's ok if no one reads this, it made me feel better a little.

today i told someone why i only have one diamond earring.
people always tell me MELANIE YOU LOST AN EARRING.
and i always tell them no, that it's my dead grandma's and my sister will get the other one when she graduates from highschool.
and they always are surprised that i call her my 'dead grandma'
but she is. she's not here anymore, and i have pictures and all that stuff, but i have this earring too.
i know i only have one, but i always have it. 
and it makes me feel better when i dont feel well sometimes.

a few years ago my mom gave me a little glass cup. 
it was my grandmas grandma's.  it says barbara boehm on it. and it also says 1904.
sometimes when i need to put things into perspective i look at it. 
it's over 100 years old, and it's really pretty. 
i dont know know why she gave it to me, but i really appreciate it.
i never met barbara, but it's special to me.

i walked by andys room tonight and i heard him playing guitar. 
i got so naseous, i had to walk around to not throw up.
why does he make me feel bad, like i did something wrong ?
lately i feel better when i talk to mel or when i sleep.
i sleep so much, i take naps in the middle of the day, and sleep until noon on the weekends.
not that  need to catch up on my sleep, but because i get so sick to my stomach.
i could really throw up most days and feel better. 
why do i feel so bad about everything.

but then i remember my diamond earring and my little cup.
and i'm sure every woman has gone through some version of this, including my relatives.
and i'm sure they survived. maybe a little broken, but they did.
so be the diamond. be the cup. stand the test of time. be strong. leave something for your grandkids grandkids.
this isnt the end, and the worst is over."

 I have a boyfriend now, he's so hot dudes. and i'm not even kidding. he's majoring in music, he plays guitar and he's really good. i really really like him, and i'm stoked on this feeling.
i miss my sister and brother a lot. i think i'm pms-ing and therefore prone to crying, but it makes me cry thinking about how much i miss them. i'm sad i cant be there for olivia when shes bummed, and i'm sad i dont know what josh is doing most of the time. i know he's having fun, but i sort of wish he went here. it would be way more convenient.
i miss melanie, and all the kids from peoria. i miss tiffany and nic, i miss my cat and my house.  I see my family a lot, but it's not the same. i've come home the past few weekends but only for a day, i guess i dont miss things that much. i dont know, it's starting to get rough, and i'm really looking forward to winter break.
i havent been drunk since my birthday, which makes me happy because all this stuff with andy is going well, and i haven't been drunk when i'm around him. and that's pretty chill.
i tried weed, i didnt like it very much. but it was awesome to be stoned with some of my favorite people from home and from tucson.
classes are going ok, i stay up way too late, and i eat constantly. i need a job, but i'm not stressing about it. i hardly ever wear make up anymore, and it's pretty awesome.
i saw cedric from laguna beach, stoked on that.

"event","it's my first night in my dorm and my roommate isnt here.
i love having it to myself, although i do look forward to meeting her.

i cried the whole way down, but now i'm ok.
i'm tired and i forgot eye drops. (for anyone that knows me at all that's a big deal)

i did something totally out of character the other night.
i was pretty stoked on it, though.

my room has plenty of floor space for anyone that wants to crash here.
i'm not sure is susy is ok with it, but i am so i'll see everyone down in tucson.

goodnight.

ps pictures later
pps thank you to everyone who came to my party. it was the best way to leave peoria i could have ever imagined."

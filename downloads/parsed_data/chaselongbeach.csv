"event","why is it so freakin' cold!?! anyway, i thought i would report on last night.(i'm so flippin tired, woke up @ 8:30, couldn't sleep anymore, and didn't even get home till 2:10). well, we played alot better than we thought we were going to, it sounded actually pretty ok, good almost; considering the horns and jimmy don't know all the songs yet, our new songs aren't completed fully(but we played them anyway), and that fact that hoser wasn't there and grandpa humprey had to play drums(except for some songs when others switched so that he could play trombone). so, ya, it went pretty good, and we were all having a really good time and hung out w/ each other and all became better friends. 

i got the pics developed and they're awesome, everybody loves them. i gave them to grandpa humprey last night and they're gonna put them on the internet, i think on our myspace, i give further details when they're up. we gotta take more pics though, because these weren't enough.

we have a show scheduled @ dipiazza on dec. 5  (patt's sweet 16 as well), but we gotta make sure everyone can play, but ti's most likely a go; so it shall be our debut with everything and new songs and hopefully ska greatness! then we will start playing shows w/ a bunch of other ska bands, and just other bands(bigger bands) in bigger places!
later ska kids, keep skankin'!"

next saturday, the 23rd: we have 2 shows(and all of us are playing, but i'm not sure about rodney), but sorry you guys neither are open to the public. but some of you will be @ one of them. we're playing patt's gf's b-day party @ dipiazza first, then after we finish, we gotta pack everything up real fast and zoom over to fucking santa margarita, and play @ my friend's b-day party @ her house. the trip should be interesting, but hopefully we'll all have fun!

well, now there is nine of us, i repeat, nine. we have another trombone player(but he plays tenor unlike dustin), his name is ryan. oh, and the trumpet player's name is matt(if i forgot to mention that before). and we have practice today, 7 out of 9 will be there(joser's in mexico and rodney's sick-rodney plays clarinet, maybe alto sax instead), and the practice is gonna be long, there's alot to be done! fruitful things will come from today!
oh, yesterday i found out that the woman who had the prints for our stickers(cuz i finally found the right sticker paper again), her computer w/ the prints crashed, so now i dunno what were gonna do; we'll discuss it today @ practice.
that's about it, and i got to go becuase my cat is licking my hand wanting me to play w/ her, and play i must! later ska kids, keep skankin'"

so, if you go to bosco or josephs(haha, i'm sorry, i know how it is too) and you're a junior or senior, then go! it's wendseday( i think i spelled that wrong, i always do) from 6-9pm @ bosco (in the gym i think) and i'm pretty sure it's free! come on, free admission, free food and like 8 bands, that's a great deal, don't let it pass you by!
we have a trumpet player too now. oh, and the alto sax is pro @ clarinet, so he's gonna p[lay that instead. head count now: 8 people! that should hopefully be ska enough. well hopefully we meet the trumpet player tommorow @ practice! 
that's it for now kids. keep skankin'!

"event","well, it's been a little while. anywoo: practice on sunday w/ jimmy went great!(except for the fact hoser was sick and didn't come) well, jimmy's definitely in the band, but not going to play w/ us tommorow night. he has so many connections, and is going to be so great for us! he's even re-writing the horns!
anyway, so tommorow:

DiPiazza's resturant and lounge in Long BEach, off of PCH and Anaheim. we play @ 8:30, but i think it might be 8 instead now, so be there @ 7:30 just in case. it's only $7

tommorow will be our last show for a litttle while(like maybe a month or so)(oh, except i think we're playing brave jam @ bosco on oct.6), becuase we're going to get jimmy ready, and... our alto sax player! and jimmy is talking to a friend about trumpet. so when we come back, we're gonna finally be a full fledged ska band, and play w/ other ska bands, and play bigger places, woo-hoo! too much excitement  you guys! we're real excited and everyone else seems to be too!
oh, and the website's still in progress: sean's internet broke, and then he got deathly ill. but when it's finished, it'll be worth the wait, i promise! i think i might see him today too, so i'll talk to him about it.
hope to see you kids tomorow, keep skankin'!

It would seem that I was not present at last night's Chase Long Beach extravaganza at the youth center.  While this may sound ridiculous to some, it is, I am shamed to say, true.  Your honorable Captain of Funk Music was taken down by the mighty crippling power of pestilence.
Yes, I have become a diseased man, and I was too weak to contribute my majesty to the performance.  But fear not, citizens!  The Cap'n has fought and killed more terrible enemies than this sickness, and I shall soon be free of its viral clutches.

friday: wasn't the best, we kinda sucked, but we had fun, and it was just practice anyway. ryan made up funny stage names
saturday: no one really showed up to ryan's party, which sucked, but we had really good practcie and felt like we were ready for sunday.
sunday/yesterday: dipiazza's show: it went great! thanks to those that showed up, and to the rest: shame on you. yesterday, we announced the website, so we should be getting some new followers. i had a few strangers come up to me wanting a demo, so that's good: new and fabulous people: we love everyone! i also had someone tell me they love me and show me a condom while onstage; very interesting.

well, that's pretty much it for now. we had pics taken as far as i know, and when i get my hands on some, we'll put them up here.
i'm going to start burning the demos from yesterday hopefully today; so if you want one, and we don't know you, write a comment and figure out a way to get one to you!

oh, sorry kids, but our trumpet player will NOT be making his debut on Sunday with us, he got sick this past sunday and was sick for practice, so he never got to practice w/ us; next time hopefully. just more of a reason for you kids to keep attending our shows, to catch something new coming up!

"event","On Friday August 20th Chase Long Beach will have the closing spot at the St.Hilary's Fiesta. So if you aren't busy come on down. St.Hilary's is in Pico Rivera and that's right next to Whittier. If you need more info comment on my livejournal at Huskerdunt or IM under Nintendomondays. There will also be a show at DiPiazza's on the Sunday of that week, the 22nd. I hope to see all the people that read this there. If you need info contact me that any of those names. That's all for today. And let's all hope that Karen is having fun and keeping safe while she is away in Canada. That's all for now.

"event","I was bored so I thought I would create a place for fans of Chase Long Beach to come. It's not much since I have barely got any idea how to turn on a computer, but this is the best I could do. So come on in, wipe your feet at the front door and enjoy our brand of easy listening (easy) third wave ska.

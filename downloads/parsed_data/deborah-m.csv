"event","So I answered an ad for a lead vocalist on the musician section of craigslist.  They are a couple of guys pushing middle age who cover the Ramones among other bands.  They also write original punk and reggae.  Drove over to their Sammamish practice studio last night.

They're very good musicians.  They played me their stuff and said ""you want to give it a try?""  I had a blast with blitzkrieg bop and sedated but I couldn't do their original stuff.  I just wasn't a fit with their songs.

So I've been thinking, what have I learned about myself.  First, I can risk putting myself out there--just showing up and taking a stab.  I was just a little nervous.  Mostly, I anticipated simply having fun (which I did).  Second, maybe I'll never be able to sing/perform some of the kind of music I really love: punk.  Then again, maybe *their* punk was the problem.

I think I'll keep my options open for having some fun with a band.  It would be totally awesome to make a little money doing it.

Crazy, huh!!?"

"event","Thanks to all those who have continued to celebrate me and my entrance into the lj world.  I am truly grateful!

I've been kind of pensive today.  Seems like 16 is such a big milestone for daughter and mom.  With Monica, it is also that she's my second of two.  Then there's the fact that I didn't have a mother past the age of 16 1/2. (Melissa, Monica and I are  parallel in age to my oldest brother's age, my age, and my Mom's age at the time of her death.)  There's a just-less-than subconscious pull that I should be counting down the last months of my life. Yet, in such a big way my life as a professional in my chosen field is just beginning - I almost feel like a late-adolescent myself sometimes. 

I wonder if this is part of why the last couple of weeks for me have been more intense in the realms of hope and hopelessness."

"event","Hmm, this mode is very new to me - it would be encouraging if someone would post a reply.  :-)

Well, my website is up and running (http://debmashock.com) and I've been posting regularly on the musican area of craigslist.  I've been in touch with someone just this morning from Chicago who said he could hook me up with some good contacts in the Seattle area.  I have much, much more I want to do to keep running down this dream and I am hopeful.  :-)"

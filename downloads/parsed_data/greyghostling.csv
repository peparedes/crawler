"event","I was looking through my wife's stories and poems and ran across this one that always touched me for some reason...


	A soft, cool breeze swept by, rustling the leaves along the path the man and woman walked down.  They walked beside each other, content to be together on such a pleasant fall afternoon, the sun's warm rays spilling over them and their surroundings, giving everything a peaceful glow.  The woman looked up, tears brimming her eyes.  It had been too long since their last walk together.

	""What's wrong, darling?  Why the tears?"" the man asked her.  The woman merely shook her head, brushing a tear gently from her cheek.  ""It's just good to be with you again.  I've missed our walks,"" she murmured softly.  The man nodded, a smile curling his lips before spreading to his eyes.  Reaching out to stroke her hair, he let out a soft sigh of contentment, his words almost a whisper as he spoke, ""I've missed them as well, my love.  But you know there was nothing we could do to change it.""

	The woman turned away for a moment, biting at her lower lip to keep it from trembling.  Her brow furrowed in thought, trying to find the words she needed to say.  ""I know,""  she finally said.  ""I know we couldn't change what happened.  And at the time, I was angry, so very angry.  But now, I just miss you.  My body aches for your touch, my heart longs for your words of comfort.""  Turning back to face him, the woman sighed, lips quivering.

	The man reached out, thumb brushing softly over his wife's trembling lips, his expression saddening.  ""I'd give anything if things could go back to the way they were.  You know that as well, don't you?""  His gaze was questioning as he watched her, almost unsure.  He wanted nothing more than to comfort her now, but knew he couldn't.

	With a soft sigh, the woman wiped away the last of the tears, then gave a soft nod, her eyes lifting to his as she responded.  ""Yes.. I do.""  She wished she could say more to him, that everything she had ever thought to say would come spilling from her lips, but it wasn't going to happen.  Not now, and most likely, not ever.

	Letting his hand drop from her face, the man gave a deep sigh, features contorted with emotional pain as he did.  ""I'm sorry.  Maybe I shouldn't have came, but I wanted to see you one last time,"" he murmured softly.  ""Once more to look upon my beautiful nymph.""  With that, he shook his head and started to turn, shoulders slumped.  ""It's time for me to go, now.  I'll miss you, but you have so much more left to live,"" he whispered.  Turning completely, his back now to her, the man started to retreat up the path, his figure fading into the sunlight.

	The woman cried out suddenly, face screwing up as he started to leave.  This wasn't how it was supposed to happen, she thought to herself.  He wasn't supposed to just leave, again.  Not like this.  ""I love you!"" she called out, voice carrying to his ears.  He looked back over his shoulder for a moment, then blew her a kiss before vanishing.

	Sobbing, the woman buried her face in her hands, her insides churning.  She'd lost her chance now, there was no denying it.  For what might have been hours, the woman simply stood there, not thinking, not seeing, merely crying.  Then, finally, she dropped to her knees, the last waves of emotions coursing through her.  She had expected to feel numb, but she didn't.  Instead, she was raw.

	Slowly pushing to her feet, the woman continued down the path, stepping off into the grass as she finally came to the right spot.  She settled into a crouch in the cemetery, bosom heaving as she did, then blinked as her gaze fell upon a note.  Picking it up, she read the words once, then again.  When she was finished, she clutched the note to her heart.  ""I forgive you,"" she mouthed silently.  For the first time in a year, she was at peace with herself.

The note read-
	""I'm sorry I got drunk that night baby.  I'm sorry I got in my car.  I'm sorry that I hit the man on my way home.  But most of all, I'm sorry that my actions caused me to lose you."""

Seriously. You know you really, really want to.
Life's too short to have a job you hate...
And though you may be a success, you're secretly miserable.
Time to try out a new career - maybe one involving g-strings?

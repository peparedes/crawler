"event","Bill and Dana broke up and now were not exactly going out but.... getting there! Toms getting out this weekend to come down to visit. Sponge and I are totally broken up... and Dylan likes me alot, again. WOW .

Any ways my knees doing really good, i can run but i look kinda dumb and i cant run fast, i can swim, i can ride a bike but its hard. Im so glad i didnt have to end up getting actual surgery. 

I am so afraid for this school year to start, i really do not want to go to MHS. Theres some people in MHS whom i cannot stand. Its not just that i judje them, they judge me and harrass me and i cant stand it. I have enough going on in my life right now... i dont need stupid bullshit high school drama overwhelming me. 

My birthday is August 7.... yay ill be fucking 15! one more year till i can drive. I am gunna try my best this year in school so that I can have good grades to show for BCTH. I want to atleast get into that school in my junior year. I also have to do good so that i can get good student discount on my car insurance. YES! They do have that. You also get a discount for Drivers ED... but i dont have to worry about that for another year. 

The people who I would talk to a lot at school and considered great friends... they are hanging out with the people i dislike and it hurts that they never ever have time to call me or i.m me. Krysta thanks for calling me i love you... u are like the only one who has outa ""them"". Well it sucks seriously.... i dont know what im gunna do when i go back to school and get harassed by the assholes again and my friends arent there to back me up. :( 

Well i must go0 adios.... comments pwease??

Tommy is coming down in like 2 weeks for a visit.

I talked to bill last night for like 2 or 3 hours and well he confused me.
How can you break my fucking heart and tell me i was too good for you? I know i wasnt too good for him he could have any girl he wants and why did he pick me? Blah make me fall in love with you, break up with me. Get my hopes up... lead me on and then crash all my hopes down again, stomp all over them and now tell me that i was too good for you!!! WTF. I want him back which is so dumb on my part. He sent me this one song ""Make a move"" by incubus and like its in my buddyprofile on (t33nagexdirtxbag) and also you could go to www.letssingit.com and look it up. Tell me what you think he wants of me? If he wants me to move on or make a move to get him back! I D K.

Well I went to Erin Mooneys sweet 16 it was cool met some cool techies and chilled with Rae. Hah i drank 3 smirnoff twisted green apples.... YUMMIES!!! Didnt get drunk though...

"event","I dont know what love is, but when i'm with you, i feel like the safest person in the world. I forget about everything else. Nothing else matters. It's about the here & now. & when you leave, its a waiting game..because all i want..is the next day i get to see you. & that's the reason i keep on going everyday. In hopes that today is the next day i get to spend even one minute with you. So if this isn't love, it should be, because it's the best thing in the world..

Falling in love is easy,
staying in love requires work.

 The first time you fall in love, it changes your life forever.
& no matter how hard you try, that feeling never goes away..  (billy)

To be with the person you love
for just one day makes the rest of
the days without them seem pathetic!

 he got her out of bed in the morning,
dragged her to school, pulled her through classes,
brightened up her day, & didnt and still doesnt even know he did it
Now what does she do when he's no longer there for her?    (BILLY)

Love sucks.... 3 boys ive fallen in love with... thats a lot for my age i know but i cant help it! No one seems to measure up to bill and it kills me. He kills me well. I havent been with Bill since fucking New years day of 2005. And every single day since ive been with out him has been hell. It doesnt hurt as much as it did but it still hurts and tonight Im feeling a lot of pain from him. He was my first love and I hate him so much! But despite all the imperfections i see him perfectly... i know there are imperfections but i look past them all. I hate how he never thinks of me, never calls or i/m's or texts me... doesnt talk to me when he see's me. Im just another face to him and it kills me so much. Its been what 200 days and look at how much pain im in still!

The doctor told me to try and do that and i couldnt but now i can... which is a good sign that my muscles are working. YAY! Well im getting around much easier and better on my krutches... im adapting to them i guess? I want to go out tonight on my krutches but im just afraid I will get knocked down. My friends said that they'd protect me. I dont know about tonight though cuz it might not stop raining and its kinda slippery and wet outside. Well, we'll see how it goes. I like a lot of guys right now and one in particular has caught my heart. But the truth is that Tom Sands still has half my heart... with out him I'd be incomplete. I want to be by his side wether were a couple or just friends. Well my cold is nearly as bad as it used to be which is go0d. Im just coughing a lot now and my nose is a little bit stuffed up. Ahh ill get over it. Im coming back to school MONDAY! Well Laura must get going now.... adios!

"event","I feel like crying right now. I just broke up with my boy friend (Tom Sands). Its a very confusing matter but heres the over all summary. Im still here for him no matter what and Im not saying theres NO chance for us in the future, but I cant stay in a relationship thats at the time is non - existent, ya know? I still care and Love him but... I never get to see him which makes it hard to stay in a relationship. When he gets out we are going to talk things over in person and see how things go from there... other wise im single for now. I like a few guys one in particular.... im not very big on giving names out on the internet but if you want to know just ask me if you dont already know. I typed the whole letter up because Im a pretty fast typer and writing gives me writers cramp. If I had written the letter on paper by hand... it would probably be like 3 or 4 pages. It was pretty long and heart felt. Im not going to drop him like a fly because no matter what... our past together from the first time that we met to the last good byes will never be erased from my memory. Well any ways. I went to the ortho pedics yesterday and they told me that If in a month my leg doesnt heal at all that I well have to get SURGERY! Thats like my biggest fear.... SURGERY! Well i tore all my tendons, nerves, muscles and cartlidge around my knee and in my lower thigh a bit My knee hurts a bit of course it is going to be freaking sore! Well im out of school until Monday with doctors excuses so the school can bite my ass if they wunna complain about absentys  Well im going now adios!!!

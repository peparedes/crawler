^I can honestly say that this fortune makes no sense whatsoever.  Moving on.  Slept for a bit... probably about 45 minutes or so, but now I'm wide awake because... I don't know why.  I think it was stuffy and uncomfortable, so I woke up.  I just opened one of the windows in here, so hopefully soon it'll cool off a bit.  Didn't go to San Francisco as planned.  Last night I got really depressed and just started crying, and I came to the decision that I really didn't want to go.  Perhaps my shyness got the better of me, but I'd say it's probably because it was 4:30AM and I still hadn't fallen asleep.  Even though I think I can, I really cannot function with an hour or so with sleep.  I heard somewhere once that if you get an odd amount of sleep (such as 3 hours or 5 hours) you'll be more tired than if you got an even number of sleep (such as 2 or 4 hours).  Strange, but so far it's turned out to be true once I sit down and think about it.  

All of my animals are sleeping next to me, side by side.  It's quite cute.  It's curious how my pets can get sleep and I can't.  Just one of those things I suppose.  And my back still hurts.  It's been hurting ever since Wednesday, and the pain hasn't gotten any better.  In fact, I think it's gotten worse.  It feels like it's bruised in numerous places, and it hurts ever so much to bend over and twist my torso.  Even right now as I'm sitting on the couch it hurts like no other.  Last night I took 2 of Damon's muscle relaxors since I don't have any more for the time being, and even they didn't get rid of the pain.  Maybe I put too much faith into medicine, because I just can't seem to understand why there isn't a medicine out there that'll make this pain go away.  And for that matter, why isn't there a sleeping pill that makes me sleepy?  Lots of people find it astounding (including doctors) that Ambien didn't work one bit.  I keep seeing these commercials for a new sleeping pill called Lunesta... the next time I visit the therapist I'm going to ask him about it.  Maybe he can prescribe me some.  I just want this strange and long lasting problem to disappear.  For the time being though, I'm going to take a Benadryl and hope that helps.  At least I know it will stop my restless legs.

peace.

"event","So yesterday I had a total flashback to senior year when I went over to the crows nest and norm told me he had decided to become goth. He said that now everything he owns is black except his ipod headphones which I suggested he color black with a permanent marker. He also said he got a new jetta and I said I hoped it was black with black interior, and Dein said no red interior for all of his blood that's been spilled. Later when I asked norm if I could borrow a dollar he said he spent all his money on black hair dye and nail polis...and well you get the idea.

It made me miss Barbara and Dani and Brave New Workshop."

"event","Last week I did dance enrichment with the kids. Today when I was walking Sierra to childcare a girl who I had in my twos class last year came up to me and went ""Look Teacher Lauren I can do it now!"" and proceeded to do a perfect reverse undulation. Her name is Kaili she is going to be gorgeous, she is three. It was one of the coolest experiences of my life. 

Last Friday Chase and Charley (brothers Chase is four and Charley is two) both came and sat on my lap and hugged me. Then Kaiden came over and hugged me. When I got up to do enrichment Kaiden came with me and said to all the other kids sitting down, ""this is my friend Teacher Lauren, she is going to do some pretty bellydancing."" Then she stayed up there with me and helped the younger kids do yoga. Max told me that he wants to be a bellydancer, I also taught Max how to blow bubbles with gum. Chase walked around yelling ""Its time to clean up Teacher Lauren is going to do bellydance now!"" for forty-five minutes before it was time to dance. The kids kept getting confused and Christine kept telling them to ignore Chase because it wasn't time to clean up. When I was done Kaiden and Chase came up and hugged me and asked me not to leave (when I had done enrichment in their classrooms I had left right after) and I said I wasn't leaving. Then the two of them ran around telling all the other kids that I wasn't leaving. I love my job. 

Also Sierra who cries and cries at the end of class because she does not want to go to childcare and I had a nice chat on the way to childcare. When Mary came in she came over to me and goes ""That's David's mom, when is he going to come visit?"" She loves David so much and I'm sure David is sick to hell of hearing that story from every woman who works with us and thinks the story is adorable. I think its amazing how the lead teacher is not always the lead. In Christina and Emily's room, Emily runs the show. The kids love her and want to do activities with her and such. I really like Emily and David they are a lot older that me Emily is 25 and David is 22, but they just get it, some kids our age come and try to do the job and they just don't get it. The kids don't trust them or really take to them, but the three of us are the youngest people who work there and we are three of the favorite teachers of the kids. We all are able to handle the kids that nooneelse can deal with. I wish David worked with Janine instead of me he is much better with her. I should ask him about that the next time I see him. I made Mary a mix and she told me she likes my mixes better than any other music (this is the second mix I have given her) I really like Mary too. I wish the woman at work weren't so sad all the time."

Tony got drunk of SoCo and tried to convince Norm and me that he wasn't drunk before telling us over and over that he is half black. G-rat's house got the cops called on them on friday night and then on saturday their house got searched and they all got taken to jail and given misdemenors, instead of the felonies they would have gotten had their been a drug dog. AD flipped out, a girl came and told Tony and I that the cops may come to the zoo, which we both knew wouldn't happen, although as Tony pointed out, the cops probably will come to the zoo someday...We watched strange TV shows and I slept in Jason's bed with Toker (Tony's cat) whom I accidentally kicked during the night. Tanis and Tony refused to watch I Heart Huckabees, Ronelle inhaled a jello shot and it came out her nose. I didn't go to Don's. Norm, Danni and I reminisced about 10KLF, Tanis, Whitney, Heather and Tony may come this year which would be excellent. Bellydancing next week, on thursday I danced for an hour and made $32.81 for democracy. WHOOT!. Belkei brough home a skank from the bar and woke up everyone to meet her, she asked Tony to play guitar for her and Tony was mad that he had been woken up, so then she asked Belkei to play for her he said no too. Heather tried to fight Belkei because she was blacked out and beligerant. Tammy still is mooching off the crows nest. Norm threw a radio into the tree. Jason told Nick Morgan that I chain guys down to their beds and rip off their eye lids.

"event","So tonight was a responsible night. I worked today with the one person at my work who absolutely hates me, but it was alright...she just didn't talk to me, which meant that I spent more time with the kids...who were all really cute and awesome and pretty chill considering they were really little, littler than I usually work with the oldest was almost 2 1/2, so yeah...most of them woke up from naps and came right to childcare which tends to not be so good. I got to see Charlotte one of my 2 year old girls from this summer...whose birthday is the same as Caitlin's so I guess she's 3 now, but she was in the 2 class...and my god, this girl is going to be beautiful...so is her sister Catherine (who I had today), and she has two brothers one who is 16 and the other is 8, which they are both really cute too...at least the older one is (I know I feel really gross writing that, but its true) and the younger one will be, but yeah anyways, their mom is super nice too, and she's pretty,so I guess her husband must be good looking too, because well, they are all really attractive...wow that ended up taking a complete detour to what I was going to say...but anyways...the kids loved me, which is always fun, because sometimes the kids get scared if they don't know you...and I saw Uma (a girl I had in childcare and a night class over break) at Jerry's (grocery store by my house,and she reached out to me and smiled at me, I know she recognized me, which made me feel really good...but then my job always makes me feel good...I love my job so much, but I don't think I could do it for the rest of my life, I just wouldn't be able do that. I couldn't be a teacher. I need to be way more involved than that, not that like teachers aren't involved or anything, but I just can't help feeling powerless (as anyone who knows me at all can tell you)and while teachers aren't powerless, I need to rule the world, and that is what I am going to do...that is what I was meant to do. I'm sure most people would tell me that I was crazy for thinking that, but I honestly believe that, that is why, inspite of everything, I am not dead yet (which is an even more amazing thing that anyone who knows me can tell you), because I have to do something great, and I am really excited for it...whatever it is, it will be a good time I'm sure. That is why I went to Perpich, that is why I went to DePaul, that is why I am going to Morris and why I want to go to Macalester next year...because that is what I need to do in order to take over the world. 

Tonight I went to the Democratic caucus, I know I should have gone to the Republican one, but well...it seemed like I should go to the Democratic caucus, I should go to the caucus that would be the most welcoming, although I am sure the Republicans would be just as thrilled as the Democrats to have a young college girl at their caucus, but oh well, it's too late now...Dad said it was because I was afraid of republicans, but I realized how much I hate democrats tonight, which is quite a bit, it seems like many democrats are just republicans who haven't realized they are assholes. There are some democrats that I hate more than some republicans, and there are many centrists that I hate more than all of them...MAKE A DECISION! I have realized lately as well...that many democrats and republicans are actually the opposite in disguise...which is interesting to me, although I don't know why...I guess because to me you may as well just be what you aren going to be and leave it at that...there is no need to be trendy or whatever and go along with the political views of others, you need to just figure out what works for you...I never realized how liberal I was until my senior year of Perpich, when during the election...I found myself thinkging that Kerry and Bush were essentially the same..and finding myself frustrated that the ""liberal"" democratic party wasn't nearly liberal enough for me, and what was more they wouldn't take a stand on issues...guided by Joao, Wallace and Tory, I soon found out that I was extremely liberal and upon arrival at DePaul my activism took off...and I was so happy, I felt like things I were doing were making a difference...or could make a difference, if I worked hard enough, the people I met at DePaul really inspired me, more than anyone ever has, Joao and Wallace and Tory gave me the ideas and the motivation I needed, but the people at DePaul showed me what to do, they showed me what needed to happen and that I wasn't alone in wanting change and in wanting to act to create change. For that I am eternally greatful to them...whether or not they read this far in this epic entry...which for those of you have been keeping up in entirely unplanned...well not entirely but you get the idea, anyways...I suppose I should wrap this up, seeing as I doubt that very few people are actually going to read this and I am starting to come down...which means I may want to go to sleep before I have to wake up in 4 hours...but then again...maybe not at this point...it might make more sense to just keep going...hmm...the life I lead is so difficult, I know, I'm sure that all of you pity me greatly of my intensely difficult life of going to school...teaching preschool...interning at various places...kissing a whole lot of ass...doing drugs...having sex...dude my life is so F ing hard. 

Wow...this ended up being a really long entry and I didn't even talk about half of the stuff I wanted to talk about...stupid having only one person to talk to, although he's cool, he's a friend of John's named Reggie who I friended on facebook earlier and now we're talking about ethics...and now we've moved onto religion...man I haven't been challenged like this for a while...its fun, I'm totally getting my ass kicked in philosophy, but I suppose its because I'm currently taking intro to ethics and he has taken 16 philosophy credits...wow, this kid is seriously wasting me...that's really sad...but at the same time...awesome...I enjoy getting my ass kicked from time to time...it makes me realize how little I really know about things and how much I have left to learn. 

Emily and I talked today for the first time in years...I told her I was sorry about all the bullshit, and then just kind of explained what I was feeling at the time. It was definately a good conversation, and we plan on talking again, I feel very good about that, which I didn't know if I would feel alright about talking to her about what happened...but I do think it went rather well, it wasn't awkward, and it went rather smoothly. 

Devin was upset today, I tried to make him feel better...but I don't think that I succeeded...oh well...sorry peachy I tried. 

I tried to make Gus laugh today too, because I feel like I only call him when I'm upset or need help...which I do not try to do. 

Man two hours later and I am still getting my ass kicked by this kid...I'm not going to stop though, this is excellent times. Thanks John Ledder for telling me about this kid, he rocks my socks off. 

Wow...I have been up all night...I didn't see this one coming, oh well...this post took me about two hours of intermingled writing, talking to people...bonding...yeah there was quite a bit of bonding that went on last night...me and nina, me and john ledder, me and emily(well sorta...close enough to bonding), kind of devin ( I just realized that lower case d's really bother me is that odd? So do lower case i's), reggie (philosophy kid), finney(although that wasn't really bonding so much as just chatting about life, but hey close enough right?), I texted amanda(not DePaul amanda...although I did call her too...but devin's ex amanda...just to be funny, which worked out in my favor), talked to abby and tina(from DePaul) both very briefly and both encouraged me to come back and visit which I assured them I was working on(which I am working on), and I tried to talk to Kelsey(that didn't work so well), ya know how much time I spent working on this...but I think I'm just going to post this even though its done...done...done...I need to not use the ... so much because I way over use the ..."

I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing...but it is a thing and I felt I should address it.

 I got to talk to Devin and that was good I really missed him, well I still miss him, but I think that things will work themselves out. I just have a feeling. Well, since I actually need to get productive tomorrow, I should go to sleep. yesterday I slept like shit.

"event","so I missed 45 minutes of my hour long class today because Veronica and I were looking at the boa constrictors in the science department, when a teacher offered to let us play with it, so we got out both of them. they wrapped all around me. I want one so bad now, but mom hates reptiles, so guess it will have to wait until later. They are really beautiful though, it climbed up to my head and put its tongue in my ear, that felt really weird at one point Ramses was wrapped around my waist and 8 Ball was wrapped around my arm. It felt really cool. They are so amazing, and I love the sound of their hiss. I can't describe to you in words how much I love them...Its so cool to be a science major.

P.S Froilan please move to Minneapolis!!! It would be so friggin sweet! Haley should come too! You love Minneapolis! And it loves you guys...it told me so...seriously we've talked about it extensively"

So after being passive agressive for about a million years he started telling me how I was going to hell because...among other things, I am gay and have premarital sex,also because I call god by a different name and because I'm not sorry for sins I have committed...etc...etc...It was quite upsetting to me to say the least no one really enjoys being told they are a terrible person especially when it is for things they do not believe are wrong. 

I don't understand why he can't just accept me for how I am and the decisions I make. I don't try to change him and he would get upset if I tried to, so why does he try to change me?"

"event","So far Morris hasn't been too bad. Yesterday I hung out with Nick a whole bunch. I am so fond of that little chap. I remember when I first met him in 10th grade and Ms. Hitchcock would always yell at him. It always made me angry because Nick wasn't trying to be obnoxious he was just being Nick...Anyways, I have alot of respect for him and I think he is going to make sure I don't die this semester. He is so different from most people I know I find him interesting. 

There are times when I really miss my depaul friends, and times when I really miss my high school friends. But those times have lessened. I think it will be okay here. Except there are no coffee makers in this dorm...MAJOR PROBLEM.

Sarah I hope you don't get sick of me, but if you do let me know...like right away and I'll leave you alone...and stuff....

I have found the person whom I am going to constantly make fun of, at DePaul it was scribbler and here it shall be merdock. The first thing he said to me was ""I don't like people unless they're goth."" I know right? How can I not make fun of someone who seriously says that? I would be a disgrace....people would throw things when I walked by...

Tonight I get to hangout with Jason I am under strict orders from Finney as well as my brother not to date him, as though I were that stupid. But apparently alot of girls are because four girls have had to leave Morris because they dated him. I'm leaving anyway...so maybe I should date him...except. NO."

While it could cause him to lose his job and his teaching liscense. So if you could all please stop that would be great. 

P.S. once again previous journal entry was not meant to insult anyone, so if it was taken that way, I was just trying to put into words the difference between my Edina and Perpich friends. Don't be upset, and if you are stop being a drama queen and get over it, not everything is about you, I wasn't saying it to be mean or malicious."

"event","Today I realized the difference between my Edina friends and my Perpich friends. I realized it because Zoe asked to meet Caitlin and I said no. I told her I didn't want her to meet Caitlin, because she would not like Caitlin and she wouldn't understand. 

With my Edina friends we can just be. We don't try to tell each other what to do or what not to do. We don't try to be cool, or smart, or dark, or angry, or alternative, or slutty, or drugged out, or rebelious...we can just be. We just have fun and its not a big deal, if two people are dating, they don't have to be in love, there isn't like this split of friends about if they break up who will be on whose side. There isn't drama. If two people makeout it doesn't have to mean something, we don't have to talk about it, it can just be told to us and then everyone moves on. We don't have to lie to make ourselves more interesting. We don't backstab, we've all known each other way too long to do that. If something bothers us, we can just say it, but not in a dramatic or bitchy way, and it won't linger its just said and we all understand and then move on. We are loyal, but not clichy, we don't have to tell everyone that we miss our ""ladies"" or that the ""ladies"" are hanging out and make others feel excluded. We don't have to be democratic or anti-christian, but we can be. We don't hate wherever we are and wish to be wherever we aren't, quite the opposite, we are happy wherever we are, but can the negatives of the place as well and have no problems moving from one place to another. We don't have to be angry and hate everything, but we can be. WE CAN LAUGH AT OURSELVES! We all love each other and we know that.  For the most part we don't really have anything in common, except we all have a desire to be. We just want to be comfortable with the people we are with, we just want to be. 

Caitlin, Kelsey and Nina were some of the first to visit me in the hospital. Kelsey was the first person I came out to. Nina was the first person to welcome me back to the Edina family. Both of them were the ones who looked out for me in 9th grade, and while at the time I was furious at them, later i realized why they had done it. We did lose each other for a while when Emily came on the scene, but well, things are the way they are. Caitlin has been the ying to my yang for many years. I think she got frustrated at times and felt like my side kick, but I think people tended to warm to her more than me. I was always the one who demanded attention, I was the dramatic one, the sprinter who ran until she collapsed. Caitlin was the distance runner, she was the one who slowed down when she had to, she thought things through much more than I did, not that that is saying anything. I think that we taught each other alot, I taught her to be say what she wanted, she taught me to say I love you. Without me, she probably wouldn't have had as much backbone as she does, my constant sarcasm taught her to buck up, while she taught me that you need to tell people when they mean alot to you otherwise they don't know. These three are not my only Edina friends, but they are the ones I have known the longest, Caitlin and Kelsey since second grade, Nina since 4th, we read the Oz books together, watched Now and Then, obsessed over Lord of the Rings, disected animals, made Goosebumps bookmarks, got boobs (some more than others), dressed up as sluts in kelsey's basement, we ate frosting out of cans, tortured barbies...and I still talk to them. I am so amazed by that, even after everything, after we have all grown up and become so different we still talk, a large part of me hopes that we do end up like those girls in now and then, Caitlin: the shy, goody-goody (in the best way), Kelsey: the adventurer, Nina: The writer, and Me: The attention grabber(demander?), and we all come back whenever one of us needs the others. That we help with each others babies, make fun of each others mistakes...that we reminisce...thats probably lame...oh well...deal with it. 

Don't get me wrong, not everyone at perpich is like this, and I do love my perpich friends, its just that my edina friends and I have a different feeling that my perpich friends and I. We are much more of a family. 

Please don't get angry and dramatic about this that is not my intention at all. I just was glad that I am figuring things out finally."

"event","Last night I saw Becky, who was my best friend starting in about 8th grade and who I have had a crush on since then. She's pretty awesome...but she's pretty much the opposite of me in every way..She's a 5ft 10in super religious Mormon who is opposed to premarital sex, drugs, alcohol, being gay...ya know..me.


And she didn't really know what I had been doing for the past two years, because well I thought she would hate me. But last night I just kind of told her...like everything and I expected her to be mad/disapproving/Becky...about it...but instead she was like oh okay...and I was like are you mad and she was like no I love you. And she even meant it, she used to say that and then ignore you as a way of showing you she was mad, but she stayed and talked to me all night. So I was really happy about that. I asked her if she hated me because I am half fag and she said no I love you. You never understood that and I don't think you ever will but I do. And that made me think of Dani and what she said...and i realized that four of the people in my life that I cared alot about I had driven away...in the order they appeared...Becky, Evan, Dani and Devin...because I was afraid that they would stop caring about me, not because of a blind self hatred, although I'm sure that had some to do with it. After Devin and I stopped talking I realized that, and then I kind of shut down...I just felt like I shouldn't talk to anyone, like I'd just be a jerk again. And you know who brought me out of it? Tory...Tory Peterson...our overweight middle aged theater teacher. When I told him I might have to leave for a year for treatment, he didn't just like say okay and ignore it. He acutally talked to me about it. Not in the way therapists did, trying to break it down bit by bit to make realize the obsurdity, not like my parents did, yelling at me hoping to scare me away from it, not like my friends did, awkwardly and unsure of what to do. He just talked to me about, he asked me questions, he told me he wanted to make sure his daughters didn't go through it too, he even tried to relate to me by telling things about when he was growing up. But when the other kids were around he treated me the same, we didn't talk everyday...but we did talk several times a week, and it was really helpful, just to talk about it, not in a theraputic way trying to disect it, not trying to defend it...just explaining...

The other people who really helped me probably have no idea...Sarah Kvidt, Joetta Wright and Kelsey Shultz...everyday they would talk to me during class. Not in any special way or anything...but we could just talk...it was nice...we didn't really need or expect anything from each other we could just complain about school and boyfriends, I copied notes when Joetta and Kelsey were hungover...and it just kind of made me feel okay about being at Perpich. I didn't dread coming to school like I did at the beginning of the year because they were there and I knew that I could talk to them during class and such...it just made things very simple...

I dunno I just started thinking about this last night, about how forgiving all of my Edina friends were, and how the one person who I had been the closest to, and who I had expected to not accept me the way I was, just did. She didn't care, I was still Roach...Why aren't Perpich people so forgiving? Are they? I never really understood...my experience with Perpich apologies is that they were somewhat half hearted at times, which was confusing. Anyways...

So as I was leaving I told Becky I was sad because I wouldn't see her for a long time, and she said she would see me over spring break, and I asked what if we didn't have the same break, and she said then I'll see you this summer and I said what if I die? (Remember when we counted how many times we each should have been dead Devin? Good times...) and she said she would see me in heaven and I said what I went to Hell and she said she escape and come visit me. 

For an extremely conservative, somewhat anti-gay (although actually she's gotten alot better), anti-sex, anti-drug, super religious, 5ft 10in amazon Mormon, she's not too bad. I love her alot. I have been debating telling her about my huge crush on her...but I've always decided against it...I don't think she could handle that...but then I didn't think she would handle anything else I told her. Anyways...I'm going on two hours of sleep and this is like a million years of babble.

Jessie/Cyndi I'm excited to see you so you best be callin me...too bad I hate Froilan...jk...I best you soon homefry."

SO many good vibes all in one place. The only person I got a bad vibe from was Rosie, which I warned Caitlin would probably happen as Rosie hates everything, but Caitlin insisted on bringing her...so whatevs. It really realligned my compass so to speak. 

I hope everyone feels as good as I do right now."

I moved up a level in yoga and yoga kicked my ass today

I heard the song ""Just like Heaven"" (I think that's what its called anyways...) by the Cure and I remembered when devin played that song for me

Babysat for Max and Maggie, poor Angie she looked so tired. She had an art show on friday and her stupid boss showed up at 9 right when it was done and wouldn't leave until after midnight...

I went for a walk today seeing as it was a balmy 20 degrees, Shayla is coming to visit me. 

Chris is joining the air force and has requested to be stationed either in England (because he wants to go over seas) or Chicago (because I own his soul)"

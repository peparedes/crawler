I am M203 gunner, and that is a grenade launcher attached to. my M16 A4 service rifle. Anyhow, I am with Unit 2/1, that is 2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Division, Fox company, 1st Platoon. I am stationed at Camp Pendleton, California.

I also have good news. I am deploying overseas July 16th 2005. I am home on Pre-deployment Leave and taking it easy before I go. I will be going to Hawaii, Australia, Egypt, Kuwait and possibly to Iraq for a few weeks then leave back from there. On the way back we might hit Thailand and Singapore. That is pretty much what's going on. Anyway, It is good to be back home for a while.

"event","Welcome everyone. I just wanna let ya know how things are. I am doing just great. COuld never be better. I have had a really rough but good last few weeks. I had a Pool Function Saturday July 10th. I  still hurt from that lol. The Pool Function is where all of Marine Recruits went with our Recruiting Officers and did the IST (Initial Strength Test) again. I ran over 2 miles, did 10 pull-ups, and 60 crunches. Then I ran the obstacle course 3 times. It was extremely difficult. But I guess Recruit Training is gonna be a little easier. After that we did a cadence march. It was pretty fun. 

       Everything is going great though. I am really happy to finally be getting in shape again and to not be depressed anymore.

"event","The true story, people do not know about me.

Fist to start. My name is Ryan and I am going to be 20 May 1st. I have been out of High School for over 2 years now. I am making money to go back to art school.

Now to the point. It all started when I was 5. 
My parents fisrt got a Divorce. It was all due to my bitch mom realy hurting my dad for no reason. My dad loved my mom and my mom threw that away. She was constantly sleeping arround and junk. She had one boyfriend His name was Steve Newit. He always neglected me and my brother. We asked him to do things with us and play or what not. He said he would bet never did. He always fucked my mom and she did the same to him instead of doing anything for us. 

A few years later my mom had another boyfriend, Dwane. He was realy cool and he dd lots of stuff for me and my brother. We were about 6 and 7 at the time. He was the coolest! He took us to Western Michigan Basketball games HE bought us candy and stuff. He was awesome. My mom soon dumped him and a year later when I was nearly 9 she met this guy named Chris Horton. He seemed realy cool for the first half year. Then later he was constantly getting drunk and comming home late and beating me and my brother. Seemed like it was more me than my brother. He hated me and always hit me and hurt me. My mom on the other hand just let it happen, and started neglecting me and my brother more. Chirs every day beat me and hurt me and even had me sit in a corner for 5 hours at a time. He was always yelling at us and doing things to us that just made me hurt. 

During this rough time at home, bad shit was happening to me at school. I was since I was 7 constantly picked on and thrown arround and beatn up. I always was getting caled some realy nasty names. It hurt and I am not made of brisk so it soaked right in. That went on up untill I was 12 and out of grade school.

Back to my living. I was durring the summer one year when I was just 8. I got grounded by Chris for the whole summer. I was not allowed to go see my dad on the weekends I was su[pposed to see him. I was not able to do anything. I was grounded to my rtoom for the whole summer. Not much could I do nor my mom. Life seemed to just suck completely. Then My mom had the nerve to start verbaly and mentaly abusing me she was always saying nasty things and always neglecting my brother and I. I got sick of it and started to act realy bad and soon drove that jack ass boyfriend out of the house. Then came the new boyfriend about 2 years later. I was then about 10.

he seemed like a realy awesome guy, he always did stuff with my brother and I. Just good times. we then moved to another place and my mom got re-married. Jeff her new husband was my stepdad and he started to treat me like shit. I had no freedom to do anything. If I wanted something I had to buy it myself. My dad sent child suport to my mom and my brother adn I neevr were able to use any of it and my mom wasted it on her and her husband buying stupid 4 wheelers or snowmobile. They wasted the money on themselves and my brother and I never ate much nor got anything good even clothing wise. not much at all. We looked poor and bad. We had to basicaly clean the whole house. To my mom and stepdad we were more just there to clean up after them. 

They never did anything and we never got an allowance for the work we did which we deserved. We asked but they said no. My mom continued to neglect nme and always fight with me. We were al;ways fighting and fighting and it got so bad. She and Jeff never left me alone. Always barging into my room to tear into me for something stupid. I was always getting gorunded and forced to do thins that I knew I didn't have to do. I was continualy hurt and grabbed and or hit by Jeff. When ever I got into a fight with my mom he would grab me and throw me on the ground hard. Not to mention I had Jr. High to deal with. I was continually getting beat up and being called useless and stupid and a loser. I was always the one sitting alone getting stuff thrown at me. I had one kid always puta knife to my neck threatening to kill me and he always beat me up, every day. I was so close to the edge and about to break. I just didn't know what I was going to do. When I was 12 I was beggining to think about killing myself. every day I had to come home to a bad household and had to go to school to abuse and threats. I had no way to get out of it. I when I was nearly 13 I attempted suicide for the first time. I tried to slit my throat with a butcher knife. I dunno but I still have a small scar where the edeg of the knfe actually cut into the skin. Ever since then I continued to deal with the physical mental and emotional abuse. My mom then kicked me out when I was 13 I had to move to my dad's and my grandpa's house.. My grandfather didn't even eant me there. I found out that My mom wanted me aborted when she was prgnant with me. I found out she didn't ever wanna do anything for me. She was too greedy to deal with anything. I had to depend on myself and no one else. That is when my dad helped. Things are better now but now I am starting to feel all the pain that I weent through. I started cutting and hurting myself when I was 14 I cut for 2 years and was alwasy trying to kill myself. I then got into smoking weed and stuff. That is as far as I went but still smoked more than I should have. I realy wanted to kill the pain I feel inside. No matter what I did nthing helped. I then continued to try suicide. To this day I have tried to kill myself more than 100 times. I still am evry suicidal and am very unstable. I am getting back on track with lots of help though. I just wish I had an easier life to live. I realy wish I had a mom that loved me. I wish I never had to suffer and feel the pain I still feel to this day. Sometimes I just wish it would all end. Smetimes I blame God for this happening to me. I know it isn;t his fault but still I am scared. I am so scared. I just hope I can find the answeres. I want to stop hurting myself, I wanna staop trying to kill myself. I know there is something for me but whenm will it happen. 

All I seem to get is rejection. Even from girls. I get rejected from girls and they leave me for other guys. No job no money no girlfriend, no mom that loves me. Not to mention I found out about 5 months back I have Mannic depression and am skitzophranic(sp?). Now things just keep getting harder and harder.

The last year of my life I have lost more than 6 friends to death. February of 2003 my best friend killed himself and it was rough, in May I lost 2 good friends from school ina drunk driving accident, June 30th 2003 my ex girlfriend and another friend were murdered and I had a rough time dealing with it. So much death. Then another friend from LPU kills herself. And my girlfriend whome I met on LPU dumped me. I now have no job and still struggling. SOmetimes I just wanna die, but my friends always help me. I have 2 realy great friends and 2 new friends I have just met that have been real help in my life. Gita and Ady have helped me through some of the toughest times in my life. I also have April an Jess to thank for being such col friends too. You guys are awesome and you all have my prayers. To this day I still run into the occasional suicide trip or self inflicting trip but I have my friends and my da to help. If it weren;t for my friends I wouldn;t be here.

Oh and Maranda, I duno if you will ever see this but. I miss you and thank you for being the greatest friend I ever had. If not for you I would have done something to myself back in August. Thank you.

To all who have made me feel good and helped me through my tough times thank you for everthing.

This is Ryan and I say to you all, try to look up instead of down. No matter how hard things get, keep your chin up. I may not have had it very bad or worse than someone but things can always look up if you drop the negativity. Positivity is the key and with that I bid you all ado

That is the point of my life where I was truly happy for the first time in my life. since the beggining of the year I have been misserable and back to the way I was a few weeks before July of 2003. If I had one wish I would wish for just that to repeat over and over and over again till the day I die."

"event","You know what. It is killing me. Everytime I come online to do something Alex is always on. and whats sad is I don't know what to say to her. I come on and I get ready to type out something to her but for some reason I just can't get myself to click the send button. Today was the first time I talked to her ina like quite a few days and all I said was I have a question! Has LPU been messing up for you? WOW very exciting. I just don't know what to say to her anymore. I am too affraid to talk to her. When ever I do talk to her I start crying. I hate this so much. I did learn something from my relationship with Alex, and that is that I now know I am not meant to be in one cause every relationship I have been in has ended the way this one did, not to mention it has happened to me 3 times in the last 2 years exactly the same way. I guess I am a guy who drives other girls to have feelings for other boys and it royaly blows. I guess its what I deserve for loving and caring to be treated with such disrespect when I gave my all, and to get it thrown in my face people say they love you and want to do special things then they whipe their asses with it metaphoricaly speaking of cource. Well I learnd from this that I am not going to ever love again. I am too affraid. This relationship I just can't seem to get over. it has been over a week now and I still feel like it happened just yesterday. Not to mention it has been making me sick and driving me crazy. What did I do to deserve what happened? Everyone says nothing, I did nothing wrong. Yet why did it happen? only god knows and he keeps screwing me over. Women! Can't live with them, can live without them. I wish I could just DIE. I only have a few good things going for me and one is moving further away from me.  Not to mention I am very happy for her. Things are starting to go good for her. I am though affraid to thank God for helping her but when ever I pray to thank God the total opposite happens. One example. Ever since I met Alex I prayed every day thanking God for meeting her and hping we would stay togather, I thanked him for everything now look what happened. He laughed at me and said yeah right! Why are you thanking me. You and Alex won't ever happen. Look exactly where that got me! I do that all the time I thank God for stuff and then he screwsme over. If I had one wish I would turn back time and prevent the things from happening the way they did, I don't know how I would do it but yeah, I wish I could. It just hurts so much knowing I am uncomfortable talking to the one I loved. It hurts so much to even bring myself to talk to her. I sit here for hours sometimes just staring at my screen with my message saying Hi Alex how are you today, and I spend the rest of the time debating weather or not to click send. I am to affraid to do it. I had the greatest thing going for me and it got ruined. thats been happening to me my whole life. Things start to go good then they get ruined. I honestly don't know if I could take something bad happening to me again, so I am gonna avoid all chacnes of it happeneing. No relationships no nothing for me. I would rather be misserable then get hurt over and over again. I guess I truly am alone cause God obviously doesn't love me like people say he does.

"event","well, my saturday as a few know, weren't my highlighs of the weekend. I had a serious emotional breakdown and almost did something very irrational. Too all you who care about me I am truly sorry. Now to other things. I went to a party saturday and all was well, we were having fun and watched Bad Boys 2 (good movie by the way). Then after we went out with about 20 of us went and played football in 5 inches of snow in the freezing cold at night. We had fun untill a kid I don't necessarily care a whole lot for called me a sorry loser and that I was crazy. I just sapped and ran across the field and tackled him to the ground and started throwing him arround. It took 4 guys to get me off of him whats sad is he is like twice my size. I was in such a rage and was screaming at the top of my lungs saying don't you ever call me a loser again, don't you ever fucking call me a loser again, like 10 times as the other guys were holding me back. They had a hard time doing so. I wanted to kill him. I had the distinct feeling of just wanting to beat his head into the ground till he was dead. Then we all went back to the house and everyone got in the hot tub, and chilled and we watched some TV and played Halo the rest of the night. 

I of cource out of the whole thing now am bruised and achey, I pulled my groin muscle, my ribs and abs hurt, my arms and leggs hurt and my back is killing me. So then I came home and then lied down after talking to my sweetheart a lil bit. I felt bad for getting off, but then I needed to go to the hospital to see why I ached so bad, the dr. gave me some pain killer and I was off so yeah. I came back home and slept the rest of the night and well there ya have it.

To those I love: 

Alex, I love you so much. Please forgive my act of crazyness the other day. I need you more than ever right now.

Maranda, You are like the sister I never had, You are just the greatest best friend in the world, thank you.

and to all you who have helped me through rough times, I thank you so very much.

Much love to you all

Well for starters, things have been realy awkward, especialy online lots of my freinds on LPU rarely talk to me, LPU has been down alot lately, and just lots of awkward things. I haven't talked to Maranda ina few days, and I realy miss talking to her. I am kinda worried abut Alex cause well, she has been awfull quiet the past 2 or 3 days and I am worried something may be bothering her and maybe making her uncomfortable, and not to mention the awkward silences, I hope she is ok. I just hope everything gets back to mormal soon, I miss it, realy I do. maybe its just the weather, or its the holidays coming up. I don't know, what ever it is I just want it to pass so everything is normal. Maybe it is me and I am the one that needs to change, hmmm, I have no clue, I am maybe just worrying too much.

"event","I hate my life, all except a few people who make it enjoyable to bare through my sucky life. Why do I feel this way? Jealousy, frustration, anger, depression? Well one is Jealousy I have a lot of friends who like this one kid that I thought was cool to beggin with I tried to help him but he never took my advice to actually use it. He said he looks up to me or atleast did. He says he admires my strength and able to fight my problems. Well I tried to get him to try and help himself instead of bing so negative and so depressed all the time. He sad its impossible he can't doit, I helped him for probably a good 5 weeks straight. never once did he try to use my advice. I therefore wasted my time helping him and I eventually gave up when he told me to fuck off. I honestly think most of his problems are bull shit. well they may be realy but he is makingthem sound alot worse than they realy are. he always has a new problem every single day. I swear and then he has the nerve to tellme to fuck off cause of trying to help him and make him realise that hos feeling that was isn
t good and all i do is butst my ass of with time to help and what do I get. He needs to fucking grow up. now to the point of my topic. Alot of my friends are friends with this kid and well they think he is so cool and so nice and it makes me litteraly ill to my stomache. I literaly get angry and depressed cause of it they think he is so cool then why the hell dd he just basicalay kick me and spit on me for doing good and helpinghim realise whathe was doing wasn't just affecting himself but others. Well I got into an argument about him with my girlfriend and another friend. I honestly dunno what to say. wehn I heard someone say his name I felt realy jealous they think he is so cool. he may sound like a cool person but how do you know for real? Well I dunno what to do im just sick of this. so I am the one tolook like the outsider or the bad guy in this case since I am the onlyone who don't like this kid. everyonr else seems to be oh hes cool hes nice he has never done anything tome. well he made me feel like shit. He insulted me. I just feel like im theone being left out and cast aside cause I am the only one who doesn't like him. Well guess what I am a FUcKING BAD PERSON AND I AM A BAD GUY. I AM AN ASS AND A LOSER. And to add my weekend so far has sucked. I have had nothing but problems all weekend so far. Nothing works i got my new computer not working spent 7 hours trying toget it to work and then found out I needed a new one. lots of things just bad for me. I talked to Alex and I was hapy to talk to her. She also had em download a program so we can talk over a microphne well my damn mic wouldn't work i spent 4 hours trying tofix it. IO had givven my hopes of talking to her and hearing her voice for thr first time, But by the time I fixed it she had to leave and then we started arguing about the kid that had been a jack ass to me. what a night I end it with getting mad a bouta  stupid kid. why the hell do I do these things why? I feel so damn low and pathetic I do not deserve to live. Why do I feel so jealous when Alex tells me she is talking to that kid why do I feel that I don't want her to talk to him. Damnit I hate myself. Alex if you read this I am so sorry. you don't deserve a guy like me im just bad news. I am a loser. I am pathetic im sorry and I will always love you. Always remeber that Always remeber I wil always love you.


Sorry for ruining all of your guyses lives... Goodbye everyone."

"event","I didn't have the greatest night lastnight. First off i am feeling realy crappy due to this nasty weather we are having, its like hot cold, hot cold, hot cold, and it lowers immune systems and gets people sick and I just hate it. Second off I got into a realy bad argument over weather homosexuality is wrong and or right with my girlfriend, she dissagreed with me that it theer is nothing wrong with it. I then said no it is very bad and well I don't know, it got pretty bad cause I got realy upset and started to feel sick to my stomache but eh what can I do. I just feel horrible for getting into the argument period. I feel like shit I don't wanna argue with her. This is the first time this has happened and its just awfull and its making me sick thinking about it and whats worse is I started it and that makes me feel a whole bunch worse. All I wanna say is Alex yes homosexuality is wrong and is a way people weren't ment be like its just a choice people make and well we have to live with it weather people like it or not and well we have to accept the fact they are like that so I guess there isn't a thing we can do so yeah. I just wanna appologise for turning it into what all happened cause I feel bad that happend I don't ever wanna get into another argument ever again with you cause  its now 2:01am and it has been over almost 10 hours since it happened and its stll eating me alive inside. I am so sorry. Please forgive me. I love you so much Alex. I love you more than anything. God I love you so so much Alex I wish that had never happened. Please forgive me?

One other thing making me feel bad is it just seems weather I am wrong or right about a matter I am always the one in the wrong everyone I live arround always dissagrees with everything I say even my brother now he is always bitching and whining and weather I have an opinion or fact at hand he always says I am wrong well its hard to be wrong abouta fact but still it upsets me that I am always thought to be wrong. I hate it im just so frustrated and sad and just over all sick. I don't know what I am gonna do.

Well thats my rant for the day thanks for getting through it all if you did. I congratulate you.

Over and out!"

Artist - Evanescence
Song - Anywhere
Album - Origin

Dear my love, haven't you wanted to be with me
And dear my love, haven't you longed to be free
I can't keep pretending that I don't even know you
And at sweet night, you are my own
Take my hand

We're leaving here tonight
There's no need to tell anyone
They'd only hold us down
So by the morning light
We'll be half way to anywhere
Where love is more than just your name

I have dreamt of a place for you and I
No one knows who we are there
All I want is to give my life only to you
I've dreamt so long I cannot dream anymore
Let's run away, I'll take you there

We're leaving here tonight
There's no need to tell anyone
They'd only hold us down
So by the morning light
We'll be half way to anywhere
Where noone needs a reason

Forget this life
Come with me
Don't look back you're safe now
Unlock your heart
Drop your guard
No one's left to stop you

Forget this life
Come with m
Don't look back you're safe now
Unlock your heart
Drop your guard
No one's left to stop you now

this is like the song that reminds me of Alex the most. I swear this is like what best descrbes how I feel about her, what we have been through together and all the feelings I have for her, I love her so much I dunno what I would do without her, I thank god every night for having her in my life, I would be lost without her, she is my every wish and my every dream and that soon became a reality for me. but yeah I love Alex with all my heart, i will alwasy live my life for her, she is my alltime best friend well in a realtionhsip context :) she is my everything, one thing so awsome about this is that if it weren't for Linkin Park and the Underground I would never have met this awsome woman that I know now, she is just amazing I thank god for creating LP and thanking LP for such an awsome fan club thanx, so much, and Alex thank you for letting me help you and be there for u when u needed me thanx for trusting me and putting faith in me that I could help you, imma always be true to u, and I will never ever turn my back on you no matter what, cause u know what I LOVE YOU SO MUCH more that the world itself."

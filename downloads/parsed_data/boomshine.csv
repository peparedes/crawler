"event","""A man's soul, fully inspired
At the cost of heart broken
The pain burning stronger than a funeral pyre
And his voice becomes outspoken
But does he get what he truly desires?
His emotions being treated simply like a token?

Thousand cannons fired
Acros't the battlefield of souls banished
Alone stands one warrior, tired
His fighting spirit, vanished
God knows he bled his heart, expired
But love is a hard war when panicked

So here now this hero stands, dismantled
His body, battered
His soul, tattered
His heart, shattered

Though many a tear had been shed
And this war of hearts over for time being
With everything considered in his head
This love was not dead by any meaning""


Mine. My feelings, my emotions, my tears.... All of those were put into that poem. I only write poems whenever I'm emotionally inspired. I got my inspiration today. But I can't talk about it tonight. I'm trying to recover. I'll get back to you before Sunday's out, for sure.

Ok, not really a quote, but a twist of my own on ""Sorry"". I can't help but sit back and think about how I've messed things up with girls in the past. I had a chance for a long time to be with Marissa, and then once I start liking her, that ends in a flash. I had Kim for a few weeks, but then I just f***ed up there, too. (It's funny, because as I name these people off, they're logging onto MSN...) Then, I just have no idea what happened from there. Things just start to decline from there... Then this year, I seriously thought I had a chance with Lauren, and I thought that would've been the greatest thing for me in what's been an otherwise-declining year. That would've been the perfect way to end the year. Boomer screws himself over again. I don't get it. I don't know what's happening to me anymore. I'm seriously losing it. Life's getting duller and duller. I starting to feel like there's nobody out there who NEEDS me in their life. I'm losing everything I have, and I don't know what to do, or how to fix it."

"event","Woah. I just remembered I had one of these things. Man, it's been forever (or a couple o' months, anyway). Hope you all are enjoying yourselves, especially my Australian friends who are getting out of school at the end of this week (lucky bastards). I know I've been doing all right.

So, enough about you, let's talk about me... :D First off, driver's ed is almost done for me. 

-I only need an hour more of driving time, and I'm done, and my parents will FINALLY take me to get my license. I'll most likely finish that up later this week after school.

-Currently, I'm trying to get a job at either Safeway (won't know until next week), Fred Meyer (no CURRENT jobs available for me), or Wal*Mart (Haven't tried yet). I'm just hoping Safeway goes through. I need some money, and quick, and I think Safeway would be best, since Fred Meyer's 8 miles away, and Wal*Mart's kinda meh.

-I've been practicing guitar a lot lately, and learned a few of the songs on Green Day's newest album, American Idiot. I can play American Idiot, Jesus of Suburbia, Holiday, and I'm working on Give Me Novacaine right now.

-I got a new haircut, and really short. Shortest it's been in about 2-3 years. And I think some girls are finally starting to notice me because of it, too. It's weird.

-I've found out that I have addictions. I'm addicted to tic-tacs and Texas Hold'em. Tic-tacs are like my crack, and Hold'Em is my booze.

-School sucks. My math teacher hasn't been teaching me anything, and I'm failing his class because of it. I try telling him, but he makes me feel retarded when I talk to him, and so I can't get an answer I understand.

That's about all I have for now. I may update later on if I think of anything else. 

Signing Out,
""Boomie"""

"event","Life is lame: Live it, then get the hell outta my way. I'm in the mood to run people down, and it's prolly gonna happen really soon. Something's goin on inside this cyclone of a bitch they call my brain - something I don't understand. It's like a bad in the the back of my brain, that won't go away. I'm not sure what it is, but it's sure as hell causing an emptiness in my heart. An emptiness that's gonna be hard as hell to satisfy. I've been feeling this way for quite a long time, too, and I'm not sure what it is. Maybe it's cuz I don't have a girl, maybe it's cuz I'm itching to get on the road, maybe it's cuz school's back in, maybe it's cuz I need to get away from it all. I like that last one right about now. I think I'm gonna move up with Snake to Canada, although I don't know which province he moved to now. He said he was in British Columbia, and said he'd be leaving the province, so I'm assuming Saskatchewan. But I feel like Canada might be the place for me now. There's nothing left in this town for me, and I don't really want to sit here in it. So, get me out of here. Snake & Mirage (or Dwayne and Michael, whatever you want to be called), as soon as you're ready, I'll be packed and ready to come up there with you. As I said before, Oregon is a hellhole with no signs of possible evoultion whatever. This shitole oasis is driving me insane, and I can't cope."

"event","Well, let's see... Where do I start this time? Oh, lemme start off by saying that all info entered today is on me being in a tired and somewhat pissed off mood, so please forgive.

First off, my relationship status: still single. Somehow, I managed to fuck up what I had going with Lauren, losing the only girl I've really liked in over 5 months. AND THEN, now I've got Jenny liking me, and that's just weird, cuz I feel like her and I are too good of friends for me to date her.

IN OTHER WORDS: I fucked up my relationship area, and now I feel like shit.

School's not going bad. Six weeks is over, and I had 6 A's, a C, and an F. The F, only because my teacher couldn't find an assignment I turned in. But, I'm get this all straightened out, just so that I don't screw things up in another area of my life.

And what the hell, let's finish off with non-academics. My soccer team lsot yet another game, so... We still haven't won any games other than one by which was a forfeit. 

I don't think things could get any worse in my life right now...

P.S. Thanks to network_shock, whoever you are, for that post you made. It did tend to lighten this shitty day I've had so far. I owe you one."

"event","Hey all, here I am again. Right now, I'm in driver's ed, and we were SUPPOSED to be outside watching traffic at interesctions for violations. Guess who's not doing that? :D Answer: Me. Yeah. so anyways, I feel like I'm in the Breakfast Club right now, because I'm spending all of my Saturday (8:00-1:00) in the library of Scappoose high school. If anyone wants to come over and rescue me, it'd be gladly appreciated.

Anyways, not a whole lot's been going on otherwise. School is dull as normal. Life's getting back into it's normal swing, and I'm bored as hell. Something big needs to happen, or I'm gonna die of boredom.

Someone save me from this hellhole of life that I keep falling into year after year.

"event","Well, it's Friday, so what the hell, I guess I'll update the ol' journal...

School: Not doing too bad, i've seemed to settled myself a little bit. I've had a few tests, and they've all been B's or better, so I'm sittin' pretty and feelin' lucky right now. But that speech class is scaring the shit outta me... I dunno if I'm gonna do so well in it or not. Hope so. I have a load of charisma and confidence. But, I get dyslexic at times... It's gonna suck.

Sports: God damn, our football (A.K.A. soccer) team is not doing so hot. We're 0-6 so far. We had been doing beautifully on game 4 and 5. But game 6 came around, and we lost 7-1. League games start next Tuesday, and we get to play one of the best schools in the league. Hope we can pull some magic out of our asses, or we're gonna be gettin a faceful of mud.

Friendships: I think I've finally gotten Colin to warm up to me a bit. He doesn't take kindly to people he hasn't known for years, but I think I've broken the ice. 

Relationships: Well, thigns with Lauren and I are going good (at least from my standpoint). I hope she's still interested. She at least lets on that she is, but I dunno if it real, or if she's jsut trying to not hurt me... I dunno. But, I'm not the kinda person to lie to. I'd rather know the truth, so I can get over things faster. But, I think she and I sincerely might have something good goin' on. She came over today, and we wacthed Eurotrip together. She hadn't seen it before, so I made her come over to watch it. You haven't lived until you've seen that movie. So we watched that, and I laid my head on her shoulder, and she kept calling me a baby cuz I'd keep cuddling on her and shit like that. LOL, it's all in good fun though. I think she was just teasin' me cause she likes me though. (Well, hope so anyway. Heh.)

---------------

That's about it for now. I'll get back to ya guys later. Take care all, and thanks again for reading into my bore of a life.

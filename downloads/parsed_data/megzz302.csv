"event","This was a very much enjoyable weekend i must say!! On friday after i worked in the morning tanya called me and asked me if i wanted to go to arts, beats, and eats with her! I thought why the hell not since i didnt have anything to do anyways! So i met her at her house and we drove down to her work to meet her buddies, toni, cay, and rob. They were some funny ass dudes man lol! We had a couple shots then went down to pontiac for the festival.  We stocked up on drinks then watched seether and crossfade put on a rockin ass concert! Then tanya drove cay and rob back to plush pockets...and on our way home al and matthew called us and wanted us to meet up with them. It was sooo great to see matt cuz i havent seen him in soo long....and to hear him sing again was like de javu! I had forgotten how i much i loved hangin out with the guys....i also had forgotten the driver matthew was! lol and how signs that say ""ROAD CLOSED"" doesnt seem to matter to him much! lol So it was a very pleasant evening and was topped off with a very nice surprise of seeing al and matt! Soooo yesterday was fun...i worked from 4:30am-1pm but it was with jelena so i didnt mind! Then some shit went down yesterday at work and thank god it's all being taken care of today! After that i came home and i had the entire house to myself so i did some laundry, running around, and other shit! Soo surprised i didnt take a nap! Then later on adam and i, kellie and rob went to see 2 movies at the drive-in...it was nice we brought the van, propped open the back trunk to hear the sound and brought chairs,blankets, and snacks! SOOO much better then the regular theater.  We saw ""the cave"" which was soooo stupid! DONT SEE IT!! Then we saw ""four brothers"" which was such an awesome movie!! I didnt expect to like it as much as i did! Then we got home at like 1:30am and i totally passed out cuz if i were up just 2 more hours i would have pulled a 24-hour day being awake! So today should be lots of fun! My sister and the baby are coming over! YAY....its always a pleaure seeing her and   
tanya is coming over since she still hasnt seen the baby yet! This labor day weekend was a very nice weekend i must say!!!"

The way you look at life is with<br>wonder, and sometimes you're even a little<br>naive. But people love you for that trait and<br>they feel the need to protect you from the<br>harsh facts of life so that you can retain your<br>innocence. You are very capable person and when<br>there is trouble people turn to you because<br>you're able to stay calm and collected. You<br>like balance in your life and you try not to<br>make many waves. Even still, if there is<br>something that you believe strongly in, you<br>will commit yourself totally to that cause.<br>Your weakness is that sometimes you can be<br>indecisive and perfectionist, especially about<br>little details and you drive people crazy<br>sometimes with these traits. With the
innocence of a Hufflepuff and the calm of a<br>Ravenclaw you will be loved in life!

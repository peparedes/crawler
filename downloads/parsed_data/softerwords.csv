 The first full day of HS wasn't too bad, I guess. I saw Danny in the morning (two hugs!) and Will in the afternoon (phonenumber!), and also Cooper (hug!<3) around that time, so that made me happy. 

BUT. My bus was nearly an hour late (and the fucker doesn't get us to school until almost 8:30 every day) so I just got a ride home from Katie. 

And I have four books for English; I'm having to use my brother's old bookbag just to fit everything in it. 

I guess I lied: FIRST DAY=Sucktastic!"

"event","hi. seeing how it maybe a little akward because i havnt been around in
a while lets get through it with a joke. no joke i lied. i have alot of
homework today some im going to be doing that at some point. i took my
mom and my sister in the woods to go to the old cars wich is where the
purevolume picture was taken. yesterday was pretty sweet. i went to
seans house in the morning and we played san andreas. it is by far the
best game. i beat most of a mission then sean killed freddy to finish it
off. i loaded up my drums from his house and tool them home because
they have been there for about 3 weeks. i still had birthday money so i
went to daddys junky music and bought a new remo snare, well its
accually used, and a crash and stand. it was costly. i had subway today.
i got my usual which is a sweet onion chieken teryioki. i ate it while
watching greatest red carpet moments on vh1. i have alot of homowork.
ehh whatever.<br>

"event","i got a digital camera for my birthday. that was sept. 4th. it took me
a while to figure out all this crap on how to do it. it would of went
much faster but i installed a program that overpowered everything else.
what a downer that was. well now all is well. i went out on my boat on
on birthdaywith ryan a sean. it was good. we all did something we were
proud of. i finally drove the boat for my dad to water ski. ryan got up
his first time (he hadn't done it in a while) and sean threw himself
off the wake. seans a legend in that lake for his rope swingage that he
almost died for. we all went to skaraua tokey. i have been going there
for 6 years now on my birthday. love japanesse. then we all came back
to my house for no reason but it was fun. ryan and my dad had a chess
game with my nifty lord of the rings chess board. ohhh it was all out.
RYAN WON that made him two and 0 in his chess career. he beet me and mt
dad.but then i beet him the next day. my birthday was kind of a long
time ago and nothing has been happening too much exept for school. we
made TIGER BED HOBO t-shirts, we've now all worn them to school and we
didnt get made fun of too much accually people were wanting to be in

"event","hardcore hide and go seek yesterday with ryan and sean. that leaded up a new beat the crap out of eachother game. thats mosly what we do, beat the crap out of eachother. sean always randomly get a pIllow and starts beating ryan over the head. i then join in and ryan gets pissed. so they start throwwing the pIllow back a forth. it really pisses me of when they do that. i get really mad because we spend half our time doing that when we could be hoboing throwing around a pIllow. then thers sleeping bag wars which is the ultimate beat the crap out of each other game. it is basically everyone get into their sleeping bags and you go around jumping off of couches and stuff on to people. its not a true sleeping bag war if eric dosnt have a spaz though. he must have a spaz in order for it to be an official sleeping bag war. my tactic is useing unusual  slug like moves to attack and destroy. nothing to much going on . bye"

(the new cone is seans icon)i'm having trouble remembering what i did yesterday but I had a good time. ohhh ya we made a movie . it was good this movie was a long term idea of my. heres the plot. these kids are like""i've never seen my self sleep before so lets tape ourselfs sleeping"" so they do it and the next day they watch it and they see a guy come in their house and never leave. so then we watched ""you got served"" oh my! that was a terrible terrible movie. for the love of anyone it was so bad sean turned his back to it because he didnt think it deserved his support by watching it. eric and sean both fell asleep during it. the we did some hardcore sleepage, and had cinimon buns in the morning. they were really good. soon after we played a neighborhood wide capture the flag. no one won because it just randomly ended because eric had a spaz because i got him in jail. then we didnt not anything much for a while and eric had another spaz at the fact of that. that was his third spaz becasue the night becase he went midevil on ryan because ryan hit him in the eye with a pillow. eric went home and then we made ryan a journal. (his icon should be mine because its practically all my stuff) but its call ""r_u_yoing_me"" that phrase comes from another movie when ryan was a ghettoer and he said ""r u yoing me?"". but then ryan went home. so me and sean and his sister went outside. sean rode circles around us while we sat on their car. so after that long term sitting session the pizza guy cam and i gave him the money. i was really good at it. we ate the papa ginos pizza and me and sean went to my house where we palyed the mini bike game and ate ice creme. syonara."

I believe Beware of the dog came in first, Double helix came in second, and from this farewell came in third. my personal favorite band was From this farewell. some kid got arrestest. it brought much exitment to me at that moment. when beware of the dog finished their set the drummer threw his sticks into the crowd. i got one, although i did have to beg some girl for it. Over all it was a good show. today i went golfing with mike and jory. he brought his new camcorder, and we taped lots of stuff. then i came home, and a a big fathers day bash. e got my dad a hamock. school tomarrow and its the last day! alright syanora."

Kind of queer, but she was an old gramma so that made all the more cool.then mrs. calio yelled at me because she couldnt  find me. the bus ride home was ok. i zoned out just listening to music, mostly a static lullaby. ( way cool )Sean got off the bus at my house and his sister brought his guitar and good amp over. the one that he leaves at my house has no athority compared to the drums. we set up outside on my padio. We worked on our song mostly. its way to the jamming jam awesome. We played out there for a while, at least untill it got dark. we then were out at the edge of my driveway and sean had his guitar. he want out the side of the rode and when a car passed he went crazy. it was wicked funny to the max. we also recored oursellfs on a little voice recorder. it sounded so bad! and the today was spri day BUT WE DIDNT GET TO GO! instesd we listened to in the news presentations and did science stuff out a at illages. it was depressing seeing all the bouncy things up and we didnt get to go on them. so then sean came over again after school. he left his guitar at my house so we could play.we were playing on my padio again, and the i said lets go jam on my halfpipe. so we brought everything down there. it was awesome. our song is now exquised. at least we think so. a new song is coming along. sean uses 3rds. thats awesome because we are not just POWER CHOARD POWER CHOARD POWER CHOARD.  in motivates you sean uses alternate picking. we really dont want to be like some bands with the power choard every two seconds. then we went down and got Danielle. she likes our song. shes also very good at the drums. she taped us on a cam corder. it didnt come out so good but who cares. she went home and i went with sean to his lesson. i bought some sweet Vic Firth sticks. after his lesson we got dinner and the did some really random stuff with a bike and scooter at his house. i went home and put my drums back. very cool two days, also very productive  band wise."

"event","Today i woke up and i heard MALES talking ouside. It was the paving MALES! i went to school. pretty regular school day except for a science assembly. it was pretty cool, the lady had all this cool phyisics stuff like pencil guns, catapults, leaf blowers, and all that fun stuff. after school was the student council party. oh ya take that all the people who are not on student counsil. there was so much food. aww it was great. then i went home and the paving MALES had completly dug up my driveway. jory called me up to have a home run derby. the fist pitch jory got stuck in a tree. we threw all sorts of stuff at it. we almost hit the workers like 20 times. so then kyle climbs up the tree wicked high, meanwhile jory is still chucking rocks at the ball. i was surprised none hit kyle. i got some crocet balls to throw at it. they came clase but none hit it. we got bored of throwing rocks so kyle got his paintball gun. It didnt work. kyle tried to fix it but it didnt work. eh oh well. jory nailed my half pipe with all the paintballs he had in his hand. i stocked up on them too. then we went to practice, for once it was fun!  we had a great gaame of ""right field"". it started raining but we still played it stared thundering but we still played IT STARTED SLEETING and we ran! I grabbed the c-core and saved it (risking my oh so valuble life) we all jumped in one of the coaches cars and were amazed we were alive. I rode home with Mr. Wood along with aj and josh. you could see the sleet balls on the wind shield, but there was no seeing after that. a turn was basically risking your life.i got home and a river was pouring down my hill. i stayed out there for a while just to enjoy it. i got inside and practiced some drums and changed. i also ate the left over chinese food! and that where i wrote this."

"event","today i went to school even though i felt pretty sick. school was school. nothing more to say. i was the transpoted to my habbitat by the automotibils provided by the school.      At home i didn't do much, just the normal boared crap. so the nmy mom brought me home chinesse food. how cool, i know, you are enviese........................................................................................................ just thought i would advance myself in the lenghth of this......................................................................................................................................... gotta get far...................................................................................................... ok enough of that way cool advancement. i ate my way jammin chinesse food, and went for an ever so random bike ride through my neighborhood. at the middle of my journey i stopped to watch a squirrel because they fasinate me.the queerdo climbed on a fence and took a crap. it was super queer. so then i got was of watching it excrete, so i carried on, on my joy-ride. on the way back i went on the same street and there was the squirrel. it looked at me and i looked and it. I could tell from the moment that was fude was about to uproar. it started hopping at me therefore i ran at it like those midevil guys on horses with polls. it would have made a great scene to play ""charriots of fire"" ya know that song played in all the slow motion football scenes. while we were running at each other it realized i was going to dominate him so it turned away, jumped on a fence and started running away from me. i got on my bike and started chasing after it. it was a way super long fence so the pursuit went on for quite a while. the fence then ended and it ran away. i was victorious, so it let out an evil laugh. i went home and practiced my shoulder and tip things, ate some more chinesse fod, watched punked and made this."

"event","Spoor of temporal movement, of action and reaction, of knowing All There Is To Know:  I am not a bit satisfied.  I, too, am unimpressed.

And I miss my cat.

There's something creepy and amazing about the course of health, of sickness and wellness in a body.  Every breath is someone closer to death -- every chortle and guffaw, every sigh and moan, every thinking and not, every moment of cloud run and sun burn is one space closer. (""you're older than you've ever been, and now you're even older, and now you're even older, and now you're even older..."")

I don't want Mom to die.  There, I said it.  Not Allowed.  Not Allowed just yet.

I do not fear my own death and have, indeed, been dreaming it a lot lately.  Last night, I fell from crazy height, hundreds of storeys, and, lo, it took forever.  So long, actually, that it is the first falling dream in all my memory where I did not hit the ground (well, except for those dreams where i was Trying to Miss the Ground, but that's a whole other perspective).  I freefell through a continual action-reaction loop, mental processes of tensing up frightened and alarmed, followed by an oxymoronic (but effective) forced relaxation, supplemented by vinyl-skip reminders to let go, let go, let go. In the middle of a longwinded, longitudinal plummeting -- unexpected, undeniable -- my thoughts kept going back, serial killer to crime scene, chanting low soft soothing, ""Ain't Nothin You Can Do, Baby...Enjoy.""

tense...relax...tense...relax...tenssse...and...relaaax...

no, fucking let GO, already.

falling through her, bloodpulp and organ mass.    
this is some sticky shit.    
the stuff that won't wash off, 
that stains indelibly.  

and i am wallowed.

Let Go. 
Let Go. 
Let Go. 
Let. Fucking. GO.

I've had this lifelong revulsion for people who cling to a Desperate Denial of The Inevitable.  I wholeheartedly salute those who jab a middle finger in Death's grinning visage, who stand with chest out and chin jutting, brave and laughing to the end.  My contempt is reserved for those who, for lack of any better term, throw Tantrums, hoping dumb and blind that Mortality is as soft-willed as their own mothers were.  Nauseating, really.

I will not go quietly...neither will I go snivelling or screaming, making a weak-willed Ass of myself.  I will not behave this way on the death of my mother. 
No, sir. 
Noooo, cer. 
'Cause the bitch ain't gonna die until we have officially reached the plateau of Too Much Fun.  So sayeth We.

It was New Year's Eve, maybe three years ago, when Mom and I stumbled home from a swingin' party and talked about her death.  Said she didn't want to scare me, make me uncomfortable.  Just wanted to let me know she'd thought about it, wanted to plan on it so her kids wouldn't be burdened with an overweight jockey of a coffin salesman atop the saddle of our grief.  No threat.  No discomfort.  Death ain't quite so discomfiting in the abstract.  Abstraction warps emotional weight, makes it manageable.  It is easier to talk about mortality when it applies to goldfish, 
to ideals, 
to some far-off Future Person, 
or just to 
Not Now.

We had our New Year confessional/planning session long before she knew about the tumors. ...Or did she already know?  Deep in her cells, did she already feel cool breath on her neck?  Did I miss the ground for once because this time I can't take the fall for her?  Because this time she's gonna hit?  Is she still dreaming the two of us atop elephants, charging madly through the jungle, laughing 'til tears streak our dirty faces?  Is she falling, too?

The women in my family are so fuckin butch when it comes to pain and tragedy.  We grit our teeth and grin sardonically through the whole damned thing.  If the pain's too much to grin through, we shoo everyone out of the room so no one will be obliged to suffer our annoyance with us.  Ain't nothin we hate more than company that tries to talk us out of our misery.  As if we hadn't already tried that. If you want to sit quietly with my head in your lap, that's one thing.  If you want to try and soothe this family's savage breast with the Everything's Gonna Be Okay mantra, you are wasting your fucking breath.  We're at least two pragmatic thoughts ahead of you. 
We Know it's All Gonna Work Out. 
We fully grasp how inconsequential are our corporeal troubles.  We mourn in private.  We die in solitude.  We are bitches to the bitter ends: jealous of our time, overprotective of our privacy, exorbitant with our Love. 
Effusive, even.

We smell fear like bees, and will have no truck with weakness.  Not even if you're trying to help.  Especially then.  Like bees, we are honey and anger.  Like bees we smell the stench of our own emotional reaches.  Like bees, like poets, like adventurers and seekers, we, too, are Not A Bit Tamed.  We, too, are not satisfied. 
Gathering nectar, creating Sweetness.   
Gathering swarms, creating Chaos.  
Gathering Death and Immortality, the slip-satiny Folds of Time's Fabric Skirts about our waists to ford the realities-deep mud of every Moving River.

We get the futility.  And we do it anyway.  Grin at it always.

I do not want my mom to die.

But I will be there, big-mouthed and laughing, when she does.

And the thing is?  If my awesome superstar mom really is falling for real?  Bitch is gonna be laughing the whole way down.  She just rolls like that."

"event","on joe's laptop (bless him down to his fidgety bones) at the noisy, noisy bakery.  
<br>
is this a good idea?

<br>
<br>
wonton off for san jose, red to my blue; my chinese dumpling hole empty for a few days.  <br>
i am yet cerulean and amazing.  <br>
writing official tenant-to-landlord letters:  'fix this or fuck you.'  <br>
i am for the grey drip and drizzle, the cold clam chowder of a not yet
afternoon, putting the smack down over a couple lattes. love-breath
aquatic. i am starfish and eating, viscera prolapsed.
<br>
<br>
<span style=""font-style: italic;"">waaaaahhhh!</span> metaphor's
replaced marrow today and i'm not quite sure i should be allowed
outside. feeling like i should be chained, southern-style, to a
slippery elm, a cypress, an oak, tied in the front yard, low howling
from beneath my eyes. <br>
(don't go past the fence, bitch...it ain't seemly.)

<br>
<br>
i am overwhelmed with the noise here, am crawling with other people's half-assed drivel, can feel it slick on my skin.  (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">shudder!</span>)&nbsp;
sometimes it's useful for writing, though. sometimes the din on the
outside matches volume with the brass/woodwind/colossal-percussion
cacophony i hear on the inside. sometimes drowns it. or forces it to
focus. that is useful.
<br>
<br>
it is also a chance to observe the filthy hu-mans acting, well, filthy.
in this little madison valley bakery, with the hallelujah-holy
triumvirate of rather good pastry, good coffee, and baristas i
adore...in this little bakery, i have opportunity to be consistently
appalled at the willful retardation of the self-congratulatory wannabe
elite. i mean, did anyone bother to instruct these people in the art of
Not Being An Ass? it is a nonstop tickertape parade of strewn napkins
and straws, spilt sugar, scattered chairs, disarranged tables, words in
belligerent earth-tones crashing into each other, cluttering the air
above my head with linguistic flak. an oasis of self-satisfied
mediocrity. an oasis of 'Metown,' of 'I-Belong,' of 'We Are Alike and
That Is Comforting.' <br>
<br>
...which, you know...<br>
fine. if you want to be average...by all means, feel free.
don't let me stop you. if you want to hop the Train of Mundane, the one
that'll keep you in relative comfort without asking you to pay too
much, without asking you to sit by anyone too different from you, where
the smoking car has been detached and the children are all cherubs,
your itinerary set, your encounters with the locals prearranged, by all
means. <br>
by all fucking means.  
<br>
seriously.  
<br>
you're doing it anyway, so, you know...why change now?  

<br>
now, when you're so comfy.

<br>
<br>
...appalled, i tell you. these people who love thinking themselves
well-bred, who think they are still in touch, believe they're still
walking the tightrope between Cool and Stable, believe that they have
worked for a living goddammit, and they deserve good service
(obeisance) when they go out for coffee, these are the same people who
leave this place looking like a grade-school cafeteria when they leave.<br>
i'm talking <span style=""font-style: italic;"">trashed</span>.  <br>
seriously.  <br>
and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">this</span> is what bugs me,
makes me a little jittery, pisses me off: these patrons of habit who
have not, will not see their impact; have not, will not make efforts to
balance what they take against what they give. this is an issue of
forcible consciousness. <br>
this is an issue of laziness.

<br>
fucking appalled.  
unsurprised and appalled.

<br>
<br>
beyond that, i have seen the rain-slicked ravens and know what that portends.  

<br>
<br>
ye gods.  <br>
<br>
reinforce your heart muscles, sweet soldiers, for the plagues are
coming to town! if i put my ear to the ground just so, i can hear the
pounding of horse hooves. on a day when the wind is right, i can smell
the riders, worn, beaten, ready for battle, ready for any battle
that'll be as easily won as this one. we've already done half the work
for you, so how 'boutcha just come on in and share the booty? we
flushed most our rights and a lethal dosage of our altruism into the
Eternal Sewer this century so, you know, we aren't gonna bitch too much
when we start getting Slaughtered, Disappeared, spirited to Gonesville.
just come on, already! we're hard-up for new entertainment around here
and schwarzenegger done ruined and jaded us for violence before we got
outta diapers. you can't touch the terminator, man, i don't care what
fuckin colors your horses are. <br>
<br>
jesus, i gotta get outta here. i can feel my cynic-skull rearing, teeth
bared and starving. unfun. i will go eat tofu larb, rebalance my
phytoestrogens, and i will not slay another living thing today. i've
half a mind to find those fucking Jockeys of the Apocalypse and ask 'em
for a job. hell, i'll even give 'em head if i can ride bitch (ass, gas,
or grass), since, as neil gaiman says, they're all gonna be riding
Harleys anyway. anything's better than malingering in this torporific
slaughterhouse for originality. at least during the Destruction Of All
Living Things, i'd be getting laid, doing drugs, aaannd assisting in a
wholesale skimming of the gene pool. <br>
<br>
after being bathed in yuk-yuks and infant squalling, hearing the same
tired jokes and weather reports, seeing the same clothing repeated ad
infinitum, smelling the same foul perfumes and lost-hope stagnation,
same upon same upon same for three motherfucking hours now...the
destruction of all life sounds pretty fucking hot. <br>
<br>
the human soul is dead!  long live the human soul!"

here we are trying to plan our new year's party routes to allow us the most copious consumption of physical inebriants and sensual debauchery with the least likelihood of waking up alone or with smellier strangers, sans pants, covered with questionable fluids of varied viscocities, in a completely foreign area of town.  or of the state.  or of the damned continent, for that matter.

fundamentally bad idea!&nbsp; see, i'm not crazy enough for qualified
people to qualify me, on paper, as being crazy, thus both making my
life even more romantically tragic and allowing me to get free health
insurance.&nbsp; no.&nbsp; i am, in fact, only crazy enough to make my
life feel completely insane.&nbsp; i wage a great, invisible war
against an endless series of tiny, annoying, self-inflicted patterns of
absolutely no consequence.&nbsp; <br>
<lj-cut>
<br>
like this bourgeoning obsession with an online journal.&nbsp; grammar bitch, now reformed grammar <i>rebel</i>
that i am, i have to make sure everything's puuuurrrrrfect before i can
leave it alone, posted and undisturbed.&nbsp; i freak out over perfect
verbage the way i freak out over clutter when my mom's coming
over.&nbsp; i fret with bruisingly furrowed brow over the precision of
my word usage, whether or not i can stretch a word's literal meaning
to cover a seemingly antithetical one, fret over whether or not my
every weighty idiom is the most effective one in existence for what i
want to say.&nbsp; i worry, chafe, and brood as if anyone will actually
be willing to wade through the long-winded excess of my brash
pontifications.&nbsp; this is <i>asking</i> for obsessive-compulsive
disorder.&nbsp; ...not that ocd is something you get for being a little
linguistically, ah, focused, just...well, you know.<br>
<br>
oh, christ, before i go all simpering-idiot-up-past-her-bedtime, i'd
like to clear something up.&nbsp; as the word ""retard"" and derivations
thereof will almost certainly appear in later posts, and since none of
you brainwashed fuckers will probably think to look up the word's
etymology or actual definiton, let me just say this quickly, and, if so
inclined, you can check on it equally quickly without leaving the
comfort of your mother's-milk cpu.<br>
<br>
""retarded,"" according to merriam-webster's, is not some sort of passive state of being; it is <i>an act of</i> <i>slowing something down</i>
especially by preventing or hindering advance or accomplishment.&nbsp;
this has nothing to do with a person effected by a developmental
disability, except as a tired, trite colloquialism.&nbsp; this has
everything to do with the people who <i>choose</i> to slow their
educations, advancements, accomplishments.&nbsp; willfully.&nbsp; now
if that's not retarded, i don't know what is.<br>

"event","saturday was my 30th birthday, an event i would've sworn i'd never live to see.  huh.  

<br>
<br>
finding myself still breathing, my involuntary organs still
involunteering, i chose to consume the flames of my unexpected living
with intense research into the much-reveled and little-examined field
of intoxicology. a fascinating period of ritualistic chaos and
addle-brained magnificence followed, a period which functioned as a
delicious respite from the freight train monotony of every day, every
day, every day. <br>
<br>
***is there any legitimate reason i shouldn't have hallucinogens with my scones and jam every goddamned morning?***

<br>
<br>
<lj-cut>
i also received an alarmingly abundant number of whuppins from all the
party monkeys.  please try and imagine, if you will, a gluteus maximus (and its requisite layers of fat and flesh)that has been stained not blue and green, but honest-to-monkeys *black* and fucking *purple.*  had the spankings not felt so good, my morning-after bruises would make me cry. 
<br>
<br>
ahem! ...moving deftly away from diving headfirst into the soulcrushing
chasm that is melodramatic self-reflection; like i've got time for that
particular suckhole of a literary pursuit. ugh. <br>
<br>
i read today about douglas adams, that he ""seamlessly blended
world-class intelliegence--and a daunting knowledge about an impossible
variety of subjects--with transcendental silliness; ...deep cynicism
about virtually everything with an effusively joyful spirit; and one of
the quickest wits on the planet with a relentless perfectionism in
pursuing his craft...."" (c. cerf, intro. to 'salmon of doubt'). <br>
<br>
i'm working toward something like this. i've got phyllo leaves of
cynicism and as many airy pockets of joy, am belligerently happy
despite my absolute conviction that there are no real people anymore,
that we've gone and mussed this up beyond repair and that the whole
thing is going to end very, very badly. however, just because i have
almost no hope for humanity, no belief anymore in our inherent
altruism, and am outraged and disgusted by about 80 percent of the
species, i do NOT have to give in to this apathetic angsty pie we've
all sidled up to.  if no other weapon, i've got middle fingers and raspberries to offer that depressing, pervasive spectre. <br>
<br>
never let the bastards win.

<br>
<br>
be joyful despite colossal bitterness. when the moral bile of your
daily observations comes a knockin on your uvula, choke it back, spit
it out, or just fucking laugh about it, already! the best things
laughing's got going for it are these two: <br>
<br>
laughter is an ultimate form of rebellion, and 
<br>
<br>
laughter both attracts people and makes them really uncomfortable.<br>
<br>

hell of a weapon, huh? it's also perfectly portable and concealable,
translates itself into almost any language, and is, despite deep
thought's calculations, the ultimate answer to the ultimate question of
life, the universe, and everything. maybe the big bang was really more
of a big belly laugh, the universe having a chuckle at the grand
meaninglessness of the whole thing.
huh.
<br>
<br>
okay, i'm tired and want to end this with something pretty. this isn't
some girly flowers and butterflies crap, this is me trying to set up my
brain to have dreams more pleasant than apocalyptic this evening.
something to counter the mass death and destruction in indonesia
yesterday. function of the artist and all that. <br>
so, i wrote this on the bus in november:
<br>
---------------------
<br>
O Autumn!  O Death!
<br>
My nostrils flare and fill with your crumbling dust.
<br>
My ears, on spinning maple seed,
   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; strain to hear your whispered expirations.
<br>
You season of last gasps!
<br>
You cry of hearth &amp; stillbirth!
<br>
You woodland siren swathed in fire!
<br>
Your pageant paints arousing invitation to lie
   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; buried 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in your bright strewn clothing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nose deep in the music of your decay.
<br>
----------------------

<br>
feeling helpless in the face of disaster, in the face of willful
ignorance, in the face of bubbling up, unstoppable, incontrovertible,
hallelujah eternal joy;<br>
<br>
got my pan-hooves pawing and am hungry for whatever's in my path;

air around my lungs. gettin a little hot in here. swelling molasses riverbanks, slow and inevitable, toward

""we have tomorrow right before us like a flame."" (l.hughes)

<br>
<br>
a flame that burns by turns and tantalizes others. seductress of thick
swamp evening, siren song that tugs at our moth-strings and propels us
madly in erratic patterns of attraction and avoidance. <br>
<br>
why do we bother to continue dancing? i don't mean that in some sort of
fatalistic, 'oh what's the fucking point of living' kind of way; i mean
when, exactly, are we gonna become cognizant of the metaphoric
realities of our situation here? aware that we run around tomorrow's
blazing without thought of what it is we're flirting with and why we're
both enamored and afraid of it?&nbsp; if we're gonna take our evolution
by the tail and consciously make some goddamned changes around here, we
are going to have to wake up and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">examine</span>
some of this bullshit.&nbsp; i realize it's been done and done and done
again by ages of sages far wiser than i.&nbsp; however, we've got to
keep rediscovering and reinterpreting this stuff for ourselves, or else
it gets lost.&nbsp; drifts into antiquity with barely a spoor trail to
follow, while we continue on our current path of willful homogenization
and mindless stagnation.&nbsp; both the question and the necessity of
implementing the conversations surrounding it keep me up a lot of
nights.&nbsp; more the colloquy than the query, though...now.<br>
<lj-cut>
<br>so, tomorrow's right before us like a flame, huh?&nbsp; you know, there's not much
langston said that i disagreed with, and this is no exception.&nbsp;
fire is comfort; it's warmth; it's home-cooked meals and light to read
by, gooey s'mores and rare cigarettes inside; it's welcoming.&nbsp; fire is also your goddamned house burning down
in the middle of the night; it's singed hair and flesh, the smell of
imminent death, the apocalyptic destruction of your entire world.&nbsp; it's the
great purifier.&nbsp; that's quite the cozy little antipode there,
ain't it?&nbsp; heaven and hell, all wrapped up into one pyromaniacal,
pulchritudinous little package.&nbsp; 

<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Mm!</span>&nbsp; 

no wonder we jitter a
coked-up watusi around the ""should i/shouldn't i"" of making our
dreamlands live in real time, around bringing out all the dancing girls
and azure-dyed elephants, laying 'em all on the table in the grandest,
most dangerous gamble of 'em all!&nbsp; <br>
<br>what's that saying?&nbsp; that magic little nothing that hit my epiphany-pink g-spot
like a long hill freight train almost a year after i first read it?...<br>
<br>
""we reveal what we
value by what we are willing to risk.""&nbsp; <br>
<br>
yes.&nbsp; yes, i think
that's it.&nbsp; if going toward that phosphorescent flame of
foreverafter seems like a bit if a gamble some days, make no
mistake:&nbsp; it is.&nbsp; of course it is.&nbsp; and if you've
already gone to the trouble of deluding yourself that you can find
somewhere to hide from this danger, find some way out of this particularly congenital chaos (a
colossal mistake our culture encourages us to pass off as the
penultimate lifestyle choice), allow me to remind your backdoor mammalian pragmatist that that is fucking bullshit.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
oooh, the difference between living and existing.&nbsp; that might be
where the dream king's blue sand beach, teeming with iz and
rabbit-legged pachyderms, gets divided.&nbsp; see, as you may have
already surmised, our goofy, addled, impractical, unpredictable,
sugar-frosted black magic of a bipedal, soft-fleshed species has
somehow been flimflammed, bamboozled, and hornswoggled into believing
that getting by on the daily grind can somehow be mistaken and even
substituted for living!&nbsp; what the hell happened?&nbsp; depending
on the course of your inquiries, it's any number of things.&nbsp; boils
down to greed.&nbsp; power.&nbsp; fear.&nbsp; hope...which i'm thinking
more and more is just fear in pink ruffly panties.&nbsp; many of us
spend a hell of a lot of time trying to figure out what went wrong with
the human species where.&nbsp; but the time is long past when we should
have collectively begun figuring out what the hell we're going to do
about it.&nbsp; we've had some overwhelmingly passionate advocates of
pigeonhole busting in this country; no doubt whatsoever about
that.&nbsp; i'm talking about all of us though, or at least a
distinctive majority, pooling our noodles and then throwing the whole
wiggly sticky mass high, high in the air, watching it pitch, heave, and
hurl our mental soba, our string thoery brain pasta into a wind-lifted
flying time expansion blast zone.&nbsp; what if we all came together
and decided that being individuals is really where it's at.&nbsp; not
like we all <span style=""font-style: italic;"">say</span> it is, but really just flipped our own breakers, ditched our suburban mentality....<br>
<br>
house just filled up with after hours revelers.<br>

Life is about not knowing, having to change, taking the moment and making the best of it, without knowing what's going to happen next. Delicious ambiguity."" --Gilda Radner</i>

My life's not a fairytale. No big surprise there. Growin' up in a place like Manticore, they don't bother to give you the low down on the life that could be. Closest we ever got was Ben and all that stuff about The Blue Lady. And even that was something else entirely. On the bright side, none of us ever expected a happy ending. Already knew it just wasn't in the cards. 

After broke out though, I thought that things would be at least a little bit better. It's not like it could get any worse, right? Took some time, but eventually, things weren't that bad. I had a job, I had an apartment, I occasionally had a nice hot bath or one of those culinary masterpieces whipped up by Logan with his impossible to find wine selections. Like I said, not that bad. For the post-Pulse world anyway.

Looks like I'm gonna have to get a little more used to this pre-Pulse world though. Grace just told me she can't send me back. How is that? These people can bring me all the way here from 2020 but they can't send me back? Some shit about them using a spell to bring me here that can't be reversed or whatever. Something whack like that. 

So just what the Hell am I supposed to do now? I'm stuck back here, where there's already a version of me. The version of me that hasn't already busted out of that government sanctioned Hell hole. And the only person I know here beside the witch that brought me, is Alec. Definitely not the way I'd pictured my life turning out. 

Like I said, my life's not a fairytale. I just didn't know it'd turn out to be such a nightmare."

Max officially had everything she'd been missing out on in the post-Pulse world of Seattle 2020. Unlimited hot water for unlimited baths, no boiling or scheduling required. Tryptophan as easily and cheaply available as aspirin. A place almost like Logan's. No more abandoned buildings with the need for roomates or bribing cops just to keep a roof over her head. She could go to the grocery store and buy olive oil instead of breaking in to the Italian Embassy for it. Anything she wanted or had ever dreamed of was practically at her fingertips.

And the best part was that Manticore already had her. The tiny version of her due to stage the big breakout in just a few years. So no one was chasing her. Even Ames White was over a decade away from hearing her barcode. It was almost perfect. Except that all her friends, her whole family, they were all still back in that post-Pulse world. Still having to fight just to not be captured or killed. Still boiling the water. 

She noticed Alec was perfectly happy back in time, and it didn't surprise her. That he wouldn't even want to go back where they belonged. Because no matter how much he thought he could fit himself in in 2007, no matter how normal his life was supposed to be with the job and the girlfriend and everything else he had going for him, he was still out of place. A Nomlie, not that she told him that. Wasn't her place to tell him which year she belonged in. Just because she knew where she belonged.

At night, she dreams of Logan. His face, the way he smelled, what she could remember of his touch, before the retro virus came into play. Then she'd look at pictures of a Seattle that was long dead by the time she got free to wander out into it. The building Logan lived in, somehow even nicer. She missed him. If he'd been able to come with her, then maybe the past wouldn't be such a bad place after all. But he wasn't there, and she couldn't even figure out how to reach him through a 13 year gap.

So what Max was really doing was missing out on the one thing that had been everything and not even a pre-Pulse world could make up for that.

She had to find a way back.

<i>""After I have traveled so far
We'd set the fire to the third bar
We'd share each other like an island
Until exhausted, close our eyelids
And dreaming, pick up from
The last place we left off
Your soft skin is weeping
A joy you can't keep in.""</i>

"event","<i>""True heroism is remarkably sober, very undramatic. It is not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost, but the urge to serve others, at whatever cost."" - Arthur Ashe</i>

People talk about heroes all the time. It's gotten all played out. Just like the word love. Or amazing. Everything these days is supposedly amazing. Makes a girl wonder what in life really is amazing. What love really means outside of all that Hallmark bullshit that's so damn bankable. What a hero really is. 'Cause it's not just some freak with a cape who saves the day with a dramatic flair and then shows up for the parade or whatever. It's not tryin' to get people's attention, or to make them think you're somethin' special just because you did something that's a little bit above and beyond. I've seen Alec at the bar, all big talkin' and tryin' to mack, milkin' it for all it's worth. He could be out rescuin' cats from trees and he'd still spin it for whatever chick he thinks will take his two drink minimum and then follow him home. It's pathetic.

I've been told I'm a hero. Maybe that's true, and maybe it's not. Sure, I've saved some lives. But I've sure as Hell taken a lot of them too. So if there's some kind of cosmic balance book or whatever? It might not be tipped in my favor. I could try and justify by sayin' I only kill bad guys. But if there's a Higher Power, like The Lady that Ben was all about, I don't think it matters much to them why we kill. Just that we do it. I've lied. Stolen. Kicked a lot of ass. If there's some kind of standard that says a hero has to be a saint too, I'm tellin' you, I don't qualify.

And you know, I've fucked it up too. Big time. People are dead because of me. Good people. Transgenics. Promised them they'd be safe and then they end up in some big ass jar like a specimen. Like these unborn kids you see floating in jars of formaldahyde. Tinga. I couldn't save her. Couldn't get there in time. It was too late and she was gone. Nothing I could do then could bring her back and I only got myself captured, by use of lethal force. Which meant I got Zack killed too, because he gave up his heart for me. Mine was useless. I was dead and he saved me. He's the hero, not me. Syl, Krit, Brin. All of them. We were forced out of hiding, hunted down. Some of us came out willingingly to help the others, and some of us were caught. But everything we did was for each other. We never forgot that we'd been a family. Manticore may have mixed us up in a bunch of test tubes, makin' us alone in the world. But they still gave us each other. And we would've and sometimes did give our lives for each other. Even Alec, when Ames White came lookin' for a genocide on the transgenic population. Not that his head needs to be any bigger, but he was pretty heroic. The kind that needs no bar braggin'.

But most of all, when I think of heroism, like the true meaning of the word and it not just bein' thrown around to just describr anyone whose been a little brave, I think about Logan. Without him, I'd have never done half the things I did this last year to help people. Without him, half of Seattle would be pretty fucked actually. He has no reason to make this broken world a better place, other than the obvious fact that it sucks. And yet he does. Without asking for anything in return, without even wanting people to know it's him who does it. And no matter how dangerous it is. Even if it kills him someday. (Like I'm gonna let that happen.)

I guess what I'm tryin' to say is that a real hero doesn't need to name themself. Actions speak louder than words. So heroes usually end up being named.

"event","It'd been months since Alec went missing. Popular theory was good ol' Ames White and that freaky snake cult of his finally got their hands on him. No proof yet. No body. Not like anyone was expecting them to give it up if that's what had happened. Logan had been busy trackin' him down by all available leads. But there weren't that many. And me, I was busy stayin' as far away from Logan as possible. Even the whole webcam thing was becoming too hard. Reminded me of how much I missed bein' around him. And what would happen if I was. 

The stand off was still goin' pretty strong in Terminal City. I was just about to head out with a few of the others for a covert mission to score some food for everyone when my pager started blowing up. Like somebody forgot you only gotta call once. What was the big emergency? Didn't recognize the number but I figured I better call it back anyway. It's not like that many people had the number. Picking up a phone near the computer where I'd just given Logan the big disconnect for makin' me feel guilty again, I dialed the number someone had punched in. Wasn't local, which probably meant I should leave it alone. Yeah right. Since when do I do that?

""Hello?"" Came a high strung voice on the other end.

""You paged?"" I said, not givin' up any more info than that.

""Is this... Are you Max?"" She asked, her voice all frantic sounding and shit. What was this? Another Logan rescue victim in need of a little more rescue? The kind his money couldn't buy? So he got me playin' all sidekick-like for that. 

""Speaking."" I said. ""Who's this?""

""My name is Grace. Grace Lockhart. I know you don't know me and probably have never heard of me, but-"" She started and I cut her off to save her whatever sob story got Logan sprung enough to be just handin' out my digits.

""But you're bein' held political prisoner by some guy that got fingered by your husband to Eyes Only who turned around and got him thrown in the penn. or whatever so now he's gonna make an example of you to his criminal empire?"" I guessed. Wrongly, apparently. 'Cause there was this long pause after.

""Not really."" She replied quietly. ""What's an Eyes Only?""

""Nevermind."" I muttered. ""So what's your dealio?""

""Manticore."" Grace said, and I felt my whole body go cold. Manticore? I burned that place to the fucking ground. What's she want with Manticore?

""In case you missed the memo, there is no Manticore."" I informed her since apparently she lacked the know. ""Burned to the ground, all its big dreams of super soldiers right along with it."" Another long pause. I was gettin' kinda antsy and was thinkin' about just hanging up when she said the magic word.

""It's Alec."" She said when she finally made with the talking again. Again, my spine suddenly felt all frozen. Alec? She knew where Alec was? 

""Where is he?"" I demanded, shifting my weight to my other foot, already grabbin' my keys.

""He's at Manticore. Someone named Lydecker kidnapped him. Your name was everywhere in the file. All signs pointed to you and that number. Look, I'm about an hour outside of Gilette where they've got him. But I don't know what the Hell I'm doing, or even where to start. So the thing is, I need your help finding him.""

I started to say somethin' back, like how Lydecker is dead and there is no fucking Manticore, but before I could get the words out of my mouth, I was back there as if the place had never burned down. Didn't even blink and I was just there, in front of some cell Alec was sittin' in, looking both pissed and exhausted. I could still see the marks in his arms, no doubt from bein' their labrat again. What the Hell? I was still standin' there, looking all confused when he saw me and stood up quicker than he probably should have. I looked both ways around me, listenin' out for anyone nearby before sighing.

""Guess I'm savin' your ass again.""

Figures.

((Alec...))"

Definitely wouldn't have quite the same skill set I got now. But I'd like to think I'd still be as badass. A little bit of that nature vs nurture situation. Manticore created me but they didn't make me, know what I mean? Not everything in me is because of them.<br /> <br /> Guess that's how most people feel about their parents. You get a little bit of one, a little bit of the other, and people somehow think everything about you is either one or the other. Like there can't be anything completely unique to you that didn't come from them. Technically, that's true. You don't just get genes from nowhere. It's really one or the other. Jury's still out on just how much those genes influence your personality, though. <br /> <br /> This is probably the part where I'm supposed to say that if I could pick anyone in the world to be my parents, I'd just pick actual parents. Go back, live a nice normal life, none of this running since the day I was born, song lyric bullshit. Sometimes that doesn't seem like a bad idea. Even though the one time I tried actually living with a parent didn't work out that well. So maybe it just wasn't meant for me anyway.<br /> <br /> Thing about it is, there's this man. Joshua calls him Father, but to other people, he's Sandeman. He's the one that created us all. Manticore was his deal. And he's the reason I've got no junk DNA. Everything about me is for a reason. Turns out that reason is I might have to save the world. Probably have to. Whatever. Point is, why would I change that? Most people are walkin' around, always trying to find some kind of meaning to their lives. Some purpose for bein' here. It's never really enough just to be here, is it? Lucky for me, my purpose is written in my genetic code. Don't know what that really means yet, and maybe I've spent too much time with Logan, but if having Manticore and Sandeman as my parents means I get to save the human race? Necessary evil. <br /> <br /> <font size=""1""><b>Max Guevera<br /> Dark Angel<br /> 530 Words</b></font>"

"event","It's not my fault. I get that a lot of people say that when it comes to their mistakes but hear me out. See, when it comes to<br />relationships, I used to not do them. Had to figure, what's the point? That barcode on the back of my neck might as well be a target. 'Cause I had to face that from the day I busted out of Manticore, someone would always be looking for me. Always tryin' to track me down and throw my ass in a cage or some lab or send me back to that place.<br /><br />Anyone else I decided to drag along for this bumpy ride they call life? They'd become a target too.<br /><br />So I stayed hands off. Mostly. There was the occasional heat-related hook up. Blame it on my feline DNA. But it was strictly no strings attached. And when it was over with, I had to bounce. Nothin' personal. That was the whole point.<br /><br />Then I met Logan Cale. What can I say? Boy got under my skin. Way under my skin. I tried to fight it. Tried to pretend he was just any other guy and that I didn't feel something for him I hadn't felt before. But it didn't work. Couldn't run, couldn't hide. If I tried, he'd just find me. He was good like that. Had all these resources and stuff.<br /><br />He liked me, I liked him, sounds like your average fairytale, right?<br /><br />Wrong.<br /><br />Manticore eventually did get their hands on me again. They decided to make it worth their while too. Guess they'd tried to get to me through Logan before. But he's not the kind of guy you can break or even bend so easily. Their solution was to shove some retrovirus in me that was targeted to his DNA. I touch the average person and nothing happens. No infection, no latent reaction. I touch Logan and he dies. Painfully. That's kinda&nbsp; the point when it comes to biological agents<br />anyway right? I've infected him twice already. Once was unknowing, the other was an accident. Since then, I've been careful to the point of crazy. You know those people who are all germ phobic and washin' their hands like a hundred times a day? Keepin' themselves in some self imposed bubble? Yeah, that's me. Just&nbsp; Manticore's&nbsp; little way of makin' sure I'm always gonna be their bitch.<br /><br />The virus isn't even the mistake. It is, it's just not on me. It's on those mad scientists who cooked it up. My mistake was not sticking to the original plan. Not staying at arm's length from the rest of the world. If I hadn't let Logan get all tangled up with me then they'd never have targeted the virus to him. I could touch him and he'd be fine instead of bangin' on Death's door within minutes. So it's either be with Logan but be a liability to him, or be able to touch Logan but not be able to actually care about him. That's the real bitch of it. Besides the part where I'm Logan enemy number one.<br /><br />Either way, I can never really have him.<br /><br /><b><font size=""1"">Max Guevera<br />Dark Angel<br />520 Words</font></b>"

"event","The Blue Lady. 

Max passes statues of her almost daily. It's funny to her, how a place like Seattle that's gone as far downhill as it has ever since the Pulse can still be so full of relics. Religious artifacts outside the churches, between grafitti painted walls and buildings that are practically crumbling to the ground. In post-Pulse America, even the so-called good people of the world are just like everyone else. Lying and stealing and doing whatever they have to just to get by. Whatever it takes just to be able to survive because she had to face it, this wasn't exactly what they called living. But that was a whole other story entirely. There were a lot of reasons that Max Guevera had never really felt like she'd been living, compared to the few rare moments when she actually felt alive. 

She couldn't help but think of Ben whenever she passed one of the statues, looking down all calm and peacefully on people like there was actually some kind of grace out there; some reason to still have hope. And thinking of Ben made her think of a lot of things, things from when they were just kids but already expected to tow the line like a bunch of soliders three times their age. All they wanted back then was a reason to hope. That's why everyone bought into Ben's stories about The Good Place. It was better than the idea that they'd spend their whole lives at Manticore, trying not to be sent to the Nomlies. 

Hope, like faith, was a funny thing. 

Logan had said something to her about her being mankind's only hope against some coming Apocalypse, most likely brought on by White's freaky snake cult and their not-too-selective breeding crap. Max didn't know how true that all was, or if it was, what exactly it meant. That she wasn't some kind of mistake? Someone had actually came through when they'd been engineering her and her government issued DNA? Genetically, she was an anomaly. They all were. None of them were meant to be like everyone else in the world. Their cocktails all contained something that was specifically not human. And then she somehow ended up with no junk DNA which was probably the biggest incongruity of them all. People were looking at her like she was some kind of prophecy, when she was just a Nomlie herself. 

But when Max stands up on the Space Needle, looking out over the darkened city each night she goes up there, she doesn't look down on them with the same look of peace and calm that the Blue Lady looks over her own with. The thing was, she couldn't sit there and tell herself how she could protect them or save them the way she was supposed to and even if not, then there was still The Good Place for people to go. She didn't know. It all felt like a lie. Who knows, maybe she was their hope. 

Still, hope is a long way from grace."

"event","This whole introduction thing is for the birds, especially for a girl who's spent the majority of her life watching her back and trying to stay off the radar. I've got people out there who'd love to get their hands on a real live transgenic so they can turn me into some whacked out science project and do all kinds of freaky experiments to see what makes me tick. 

Name's Max. I was created as part of this covert government project known as Manticore. See, a bunch of these scientist types got together and decided to start mixing up some shit in test tubes to try and create the perfect soldier. Guess enlistment was down or they were bored or something. So, that's how I ended up here. They mixed me up in a test tube and some girl carried me for 9 months, gave birth and then they started training me to be this bad ass killing machine. I was part of the X-5 unit. X5-452 was my designation. We really didn't have names. Me and the others though? We gave each other names. Made it seem more like a family I guess. Just one of the things that made us different from all the other transgenics. And this was all before 12 of us escaped from that place. The place that created us and trained us. 

I spent ten years on the run, always looking over my shoulder after that. Just trying to blend in, pretend I was a normal girl in this broken world. Truth was, I pulled it off. For awhile. Until I started caring about somebody other than just me. That's where Zack will tell you I failed. I forgot my mission, my head wasn't in the game. I let my emotions get in the way. But, that's not how I saw it. It was just me, growin' up. Zack was a soldier, he might've got away from Manticore, but he'd never get it out of his system. Me, I turned my back on it as soon as I stepped outside those gates. I didn't forget all my training, I just found other stuff to focus on.&nbsp; Like Logan and his whole Eyes Only save the world crap. I kinda owed him after getting' him all shot up and paralyzed 'cause I was too selfish to give a damn. Once I got involved though, we made a good team. I liked helpin' him out. Love will do that to you I guess. 

Just when I thought I was living as normal a life as someone like me could live, reality had to knock me on my ass. Tried to be the big hero and take out the DNA lab at Manticore so they'd stop churning out more of us. I succeeded too, blew the whole thing up and was almost out of there when I got myself shot. To make a long story short, I died. Zack, being the good big brother he was, decided my life was more important than his and I ended up with his heart. Manticore ended up harvesting his organs and well, that's just another whole story for another day. But, I ended up right back in the hell I'd escaped from, playin' their little games and pretending I was all good little solider glad to be back home again so they'd get off my back. Drew the line at the creepy breeding partner thing they tried to force on me though. Sorry Alec. Just wasn't gonna happen. 

I found a way out and back to Logan. Big fairy tale happy ending right? Not even close. Manticore decided to have one last big laugh by givin' me a genetically targeted retrovirus. In other words? I touch Logan, he dies. Pretty fucked up huh? So much for me havin' that normal life. I was pretty pissed and decided I was gonna take care of those bitches once and for all. I did too. Burned that place to the ground and released all of Manticore's tricked out experiments on the world. Let's just say they weren't really ready for somethin' like that. 

But, I did what I had to do. Guess that makes me some kind of hero right?"

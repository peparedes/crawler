"event","Well now I know what it feels like when you're a musician or film director, and you make what you consider a perfect work of art, and the ""execs"" think that it's no good and want it completely changed and watered down because they're afraid the public ""won't get it"" or ""misinterpret it"", and ask you to heavily modify it because they don't like artsy things, they want to dumb it down for the sheep-like public, and they want to maximize profits.

Sweet mercy.

This is about the poster for this year's Tigerama festival, which I was asked to do the poster for. This will be the third year I've done the poster, and I really wanted to make this year's poster look special. I went all out, and spent an entire day painting the picture on Adobe Photoshop and Paint Shop Pro. I thought it was perfect, submitted it, and was told it needed some ""minor changes"", which of course were major, so major that I had to scrap the entire background, which I thought was beautiful originally. Of course, the revised version lacks the charm and flourishes of the original, but that's what the bosses want.

Here is the original picture: (COMING SOON)

And here is the revised one: (COMING SOON)

Maybe it doesn't seem like much to you, but keep in mind, that's hours and hours and hours of work put into each one."

"event","In my infinite wisdom (or lack of), I have discovered something interesting about my pets - specifically how they relate to me. My hermit crabs each seem to represent a different aspect of me. Let me explain:

Sebastian is truly the definition of Hermit Crab. He is extremely shy, and whenever I pick him up, it takes him at least 2 minutes before he comes out of his shell. I think that he represents the side of me that is shy and isolated. The real me. I don't mind being shy. I think it adds character, and makes me a bit mysterious (which I am...mwa ha ha ha!!). Like Sebastian, I ""come out of my shell"" once I get used to change.

Artemis is a very friendly crab, and eagerly pops out of his shell whenever picked up. He is really active and enjoys being around people. This is the side of me that is social and playful when with other people. Like Artemis, I may fall or make a mistake, but I'll pick myself back up and continue having fun.

Rex is...well, he's the inbetweener of Artemis and Sebastian. A little bit of both. I guess that's how I see myself. A shy guy who is social and embarrassingly playful around people he's comfortable with.

As for Stewie...well, I guess I sleep a lot :D"

"event","Argh, damn you Clemson! Foiled again!

Bumper has recently been diagnosed with intestinal cancer. So all the eye infections, kidney problems, etc. were just a warm-up. He has until the end of summer to live.

I wanted to include him at the end of Attack of the Killer Hamster: Part II in a cameo, and dedicate the movie in memory of him. I went to Tillman Hall to rent a digial camera, which I've done dozens of times. Well, they were apparently under heavy renovation, so I had to weed my way through some hanging trashbags until I found them. Unfortuantely, the girl that usually is really nice and lets me rent stuff wasn't there. Instead some big dumb guy with no neck and a short bitchy little lady were there. I asked them if I could rent a camera, and they bitched and moaned about the renovations and then asked if I was an education major. I told them I wasn't (which hasn't mattered before) and they said ""Absolutely not! We never check out equipment to non-education majors. Nothing is checked out during the summer!""

That was total crap, because just a month earlier I checked out cameras - twice! The difference is I was talking to nicer staff back then, and not the head of the department, or whatever, who is strictly by-the-book and just generally anal.

So I don't have anything to get Bumper filmed on, now. Unless I can find somebody who has a digital video camera, or has a digial picture camera that takes quick 15 or 30 second silent videos, I won't be able to get Bumper in the movie, and he'll be nothing but a memory @_@

Once again, damn you Clemson!"

"event","I've added a new hermie to my collection! Yes, I have crabs.




Hermit crabs.

Anyway, I've had two for most of the summer. I bought them for myself on my birthday, and they have been happily living next to Stewie.

Now, hermit crabs are really not anti-social, as their name implies. In fact, they're very friendly, to each other and to their owners. They sleep during the day, and they hide whenever there's a shadow over them or they see something move quickly. It's instinct. If you pick them up, they stick out all their arms...er...legs...things and run around like crazy when you put them on the ground.

Originally, I wanted to name the two I had Frodo and Sam, since one was missing a claw, it fit perfectly. Now that there's a third one (with a T-Rex painted on its shell), I think I'll give them different names. I'll name the one with the T-Rex shell, Rex (hah, how original). I think I'll name the one that always hides (and in general, is really anti-social, even to the other crabs) Sebastian, and the last one (the one with a hole in its shell) Artemis.

I think it's time for some updates on pictures. I'll take some pictures of these critters and post them on here within the week."

"event","My Trigun DVD still hasn't arrived. The post office told me that if it didn't arrive by Monday, I should go to them. Well, I'm going to. I ordered this package through priority mail almost TWO WEEKS ago. Two weeks! It takes 4 days at MOST for priority mail to go through, and it was confirmed to be on the way two Wednesdays ago. Ridiculous.

This isn't the first time this has happened. There have been many times where I've ordered packages from Amazon or Ebay and they either get sent to the wrong address, take weeks more than they're supposed to to get here, or they just never show up at all. There was a CD I ordered a few months ago that never arrived, and the seller mailed me some papers that confirmed that he mailed it, to my satisfaction, but it never did arrive.

I want to know: is the post office just messing around with me? Is my address really so difficult to understand that nobody ever sends me the crap I need because they can't find me? I haven't had a smooth transaction with the mail in God knows how long. I'm almost paranoid, thinking that the government thinks I've done something wrong so they delay my parcels so they can look through them (don't worry, I'm not ordering nuclear bombs off ebay or amazon).

Today I checked Amazon to see whatever did happen with that long-lost CD. Guess what? Nothing is there. I recently got a CD from them (that was weeks late) last month, so it should be listed. Guess what? Nothing there. According to Amazon, I've never ordered anything from them, or from their zshops. I've never bought something from them in the entire time I've been a registered user (which is a few years). I don't exist, and that is total crap. WTF is going on here? Is my account hacked, or is Amazon just fucked up? I have a lot of questions I need answered. I wonder if ebay forgot I existed, too."

Stupid-ass managers. I suppose they thought it would be funny to sleep in while their employees lose sleep and gasoline on them. I tell you what, whatever their reason for not showing up, the management lost all their credibility in our eyes. Fuck you, Seneca Cinemas management staff.

The only good thing that came out of this morning is the short run around the neighborhood I had after I got back, because I couldn't go to sleep and I'd been meaning to go running this summer but haven't because it's been raining every single day.

Also, the paper says that Clemson is raising Tuition 12.7%. Thanks Clemson. Your top twenty plans are really working out, aren't they? At our expense you would say, and we're actually dropping down to top forty. Fuck you, President Barker."

"event","Got up at 8:00 am today to go to work. I of course went to bed around 1:00 but couldn't fall asleep, so I ended up reading until 5:30 in the morning until I felt sleepy enough to try to get to sleep. So I only got about two hours of sleep. At least I finished another one of the WWI books a professor lent me for the summer. Two down, three to go. :)

Work was slow, and boring. I was working with a good crew today, and I had the Alice in Chains song ""Man in the Box"" stuck in my head (because of the new Tom Cruise movie, Collatoral). I was humming and whistling it the whole morning.

I was supposed to work till 5:00, but I was allowed to go home at 1:00 because we had nine people working and we really only need six.

I'm so tired, and I have to get up at 7:00 tomorrow for a stupid employee meeting. So I have to drive all the way over to Seneca, sit through a stupid pointless meeting that will tell me everything that I already know, and if I don't know, I can find out from somebody at work in just a few minutes' time. I'll then drive back home, probably fall back asleep (I'm going to try to crash early tonight to get in a good 8 hours of sleep), and then go to work at 6:00 until closing. Yay.

I also wanted to say something to everyone. I'm sorry if I seem like I don't stand up for you sometimes. Friends tend to argue. It happens in all relationships. Opinions are opinions, and sometimes I disagree with everyone and other times I agree with everyone. I know what buttons not to press, so sometimes I might not defend one friend because I don't want to upset another, and possibly hamper my relationship with that person, but I usually end up upsetting the friend that wanted defending. I tend to piss people off when I don't mean to. I really wish only good intentions, but I tend to give off a nonchalant air. Also, when I joke around with people, I tend to upset them. If you make fun of me, I'll do the same to you. Take your own medicine. I've had many near-fights over jokes that were misinterpreted on the other person's part. All of this has caused me to be cautious about what I say to friends when they're backing against a wall or passionately arguing about something. I tend to settle things one-on-one, one person at a time, but if things get out of hand, I will stand up for whoever I feel is being attacked. I know I haven't always done the right thing in the past, but I am trying to be more aware now. If I don't do something and you wished I had, let me know so I can better understand your viewpoint, instead of keeping your feelings inside and letting them paint a murky picture of me in your mind, or in the minds of others if you talk about me in that way to them.

Sorry, just had to get that off my chest (ouch!!). @_@"

I hope he'll have a quick recovery and will be making another album soon. I find it a bit ironic that he had heart trouble when he exercises every day and eats mostly chicken and fish.

<center><font size=+1>WARNING!! WARNING!! WARNING!!</center></font>

<center><font size=+1>All names have been kept to not protect the innocent.</font></center>

We got in two cars, with me and the guys in one car, and the Dianas and Matt in the other. On the way down, we stopped in Marietta and picked up Alvis. I switched into the car with Matt and the Dianas to make more room in the other car.

On the way down there, Matt was really obsessing about his car. So much so that he wouldn't even stop at certain gas stations because supposedly the gas from those places messed up his car. Right. He also checked the air in his tires. Hmmm.

After narrowly surviving the way to Daytona, we got in our room, which was on the second floor of a REALLY crappy motel. Matt and the girls had a room down the hall from us, but they refused to stay in it because it was in bad shape. A lot of arguing, pleading, and bruised egoes later, they got packed up and drove all the way back to Greenville that night. If they had stayed one night, they could have gotten a room at any place they wanted in the entire city, since they were all open the next day.

Anyway, so we got settled in and Will and I ended up sleeping on sleeping bags while Greg and Alvis got a bed and James got a bed to himself...because nobody wanted to share a bed with him. LOL.

Things were pretty regular for a while. I really missed the Dianas and I felt like going back home. We walked around the beach and checked out the place. Apparently we were in the frat-boy district. To our left was the family district, which was very pretty and calm. All the hot girls were over there because they didn't want to be around the roving cars packed full of horny ""playas"". To our right was the retiree section, with quiet beachfront homes and several fishing docks. Very nice and calm. We got shafted :P

Will and I would go to the arcade almost nightly. Lord of the Rings pinball and Ms. Pac-Man called. Also, almost every time we were there, cute goth girls would be roaming around. The first night we went there, there was one playing LOTR pinball that made my jaw hit the floor. Unfortunately I was in a rather preppy-looking buttoned shirt that day, so I would've come off the wrong way if I had said hi to her. Plus she was probably younger than she looked. It sucks not being a teen anymore. :(

So goth girl hunts aside, the guys and I would also go by a lot of shops. I had accidentally put lubricant in my zippo lighter instead of lighter fluid (apparently my dad switched the bottles...errr), so I tried in vain to get it fixed at several cigar shops. One of the last nights there, we grilled out with hotdogs, and then smoked a pack of cigars I brought. Ahhh, cigars.

I got sick the day after. I thought perhaps it was just a dry throat from the cigars, but it was a cold or something. I felt like shit, and so did Alvis (I still think he gave whatever it was to me). Things seemed pretty normal, until Wednesday came about...

For the sake of respect and decency, I won't go into detail what happened. All I will say is that Will and I returned from scouting around the beach for places to go to that evening and found somebody getting into a fight over a girl. The girl was then kicked out of the motel for something else and her and all her girl friends ended up in our room. We went dancing at the clubs, which sucked because it was so hot and packed with human bodies that we couldn't move or breathe. We went back to the room and locked up. Each girl came back with a different guy and they each went off to a different place. One of the guys looked like one of the <a href=""http://www.stuntaz.com/"">Icy Hot Stuntaz</a>, and that was hilarious. We kicked the girls out the next morning when they returned.

Most of us got drunk here and there. Coconut rum is good :P We ate at the Pizza Hut across the street a lot, and one of us got really drunk and we had to take care of him there. He was really out of it since it was his first time getting drunk, so I ended up helping him out with his order and stuff. I'm glad I could help him out, especially since he wasn't used to drinking. I'm guessing I did a good job, or at least I hope I did.

We also went to a lighthouse, the saltwater turtle rehabilitation aquarium, and considered going deep-sea fishing, which Greg really wanted to do, but it was really expensive, and took a whole day. We instead watched as the returning people threw fish scraps to dozens of pelicans and herons. It was amusing, and I took some pictures. Herons are cool >:)

We drove back home and everything returned to normal. I actually really enjoyed the second half of the trip. I didn't enjoy having sand all over the bathroom and in my pants and everything. I didn't enjoy the constant humidity that made my hair curl up like an afro. Otherwise it was fun and I wish we could've gone to some really nice seafood restaurants, but Will is allergic to seafood.

It was a fun trip, but I think next time we should go to the Mountains or something. I'd rather do something different every Spring Break. 

Hmmm, what to do for Fall Break?"

Luckily, Jerrell decided to come to see King Arthur and instead ended up hanging out with me at the usher stand and talking about all types of things for hours on end. I really appreciated his company, because he really didn't have to hang out with me. We talked about work, the problems I'm having with a few individuals, movies, girls, cars, how odd Rocky Horror is, and more. Samantha, one of the girls that works there, was also going to see King Arthur, and she said that her dad, who owns a vet clinic, is willing to hire somebody like me for the fall. I might just take that position. I originally wanted to be at a kennel or vet clinic, but ended up at the Cinemas instead, which was my second choice if the vet applications didn't work out.

I don't have any art up yet. I think I'll work on a few pictures tomorrow (my first day off in over a week). Hopefully it'll be good enough to post. I might go for some weird, gothic surrealist stuff. Maybe draw some mood pieces.

Today I got my cavity filled. I got up at 8:30 and went to the dentist. They didn't give me laughing gas, dammit! I was really looking forward to that. LOL! Oh well. The drill didn't hurt at all, and I was finished in about 10 min. Very quick and painless. I came back home and fell asleep and had a very strange dream, that involved emails, strange green-glowing rooms straight out of sci-fi and fantasy flicks, rodents, and some type of love story where a cute scientist-like girl with auburn hair and glasses was my secret love, and only before I woke up did I tell her how I felt, and she accepted.

<a href=""http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00003CX5P.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg"">Episode I DVD</a>

<a href=""http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00006HBUJ.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg"">Episode II DVD</a>

<a href=""http://www.starwars.com/episode-iv/news/2004/06/news20040624.html"">Episodes IV-VI DVDs</a>

Now, I would say that the hand-drawn posters are far, FAR superior. There are those who would say ""Who cares? It's just the art. The movie itself is what matters."" Yes, that's true, but if you saw some fantastic art get trashed in favor of some half-assed photoshopped image, you'd be upset too. That is, if you cared, or if you liked artwork. The artwork for the DVDs is done digitally, and malign the original art, which showed true skill, epicness, and nostalgia. Lucas's decision to digitally rehaul the art is very much the same thing he did when he digitally rehauled the original trilogy, much to many people's agony. Hear me now, listen to me later.

In any case, please make a special six DVD re-release in five years or so with hand-drawn artwork, Mr. Lucas, and I promise I'll never bitch about your decisions to ""revise"" things with digital technology again."

"event","Just watched a show about the Hindenburg. I think in a couple years, we should really revise airships and have a few zeppelins again, sort of like cruise ships: just for pleasure, not for regular air travel.

I have to get up early tomorrow to go to the dentist to get a cavity fixed. Funny thing is, this is my first ever cavity, but it's been 'observed' by the dentist for 8 years. 8 YEARS!! I guess it takes that long for them to develop, but dang.

After the dentist visit (where I'll get laughing gas...yippee!!!!), I'm going to the theater to watch Two Brothers and King Arthur. I'm looking forward to Two Brothers, but I'm having lots of doubts about King Arthur. Normally I'd piss myself in excitement when I'd see a historic war movie, but the de-mystification of the King Arthur legend really isn't all that appealing to me. I love the 80s movie Excalibur, which I consider the ultimate King Arthur movie. The fact that Hollywood, the king of changing history for entertainment reasons, thinks it has the true King Arthur legend figured out makes me laugh.

I'm planning on going to Amstar on Thursday and applying for a job, mostly just to see if I can actually get it. I'm not sure if I would go if they said yes, considering I could only work a month, but Seneca's really beginning to piss me off, especially some of the employees. It seems like every job I'm in always has a sort of clique all the employees are in that I'm always excluded from. Even people that get hired after me join with this clique with ease. I guess they know each other from school, or they live near each other, or I'm just too different for them to care to ask me to go to parties or let me in on some gossip. It also is really annoying how they can try to jokingly boss me around, or tease me, and when I do it back to them, they get pissed off and want to fight me or get me fired. I have a little message for you people: learn to take your own shit. It's something that would really come in handy.

I guess I just won't goof around with people at work anymore. It's too bad, really. I was getting along really well with everyone. I really thought I was a part of the group this time, but I guess I'll always be on the outside. I've gotten used to it."

"event","Wow, lots of Trigun-related news!

First, it appears Darkhorse comics has been publishing the original Trigun mangas for some time now. I never saw them in stores or even knew they were released over here. Something tells me Darkhorse doesn't like to advertise @.@

But now, Darkhorse plans to bring the Trigun Maximum mangas to the U.S.!

<a href=""http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/pressrelease.php?id=270"">Trigun Maximum Press Release</a>

I know I'll be picking up my copy the day it comes out :)

Also, the guy who created Trigun has been working on a new anime, which was made into two PS2 games, called Gungrave. Here's a link: <a href=""http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/2929.php"">Gungrave</a>

In other news, I was considering applying for a job at the Amstar 14 theater in Anderson, mainly because I'd be making at least a dollar more than at Seneca. But since I'm only going to be working at Seneca for another month, it isn't worth switching. I'll do yardwork to make up for it."

"event","Wow, my feet hurt.

Anyway, on to more important things...I got a new cell phone! (A few days ago)...!!! Now, I'll be the first person to admit that I hate cellphones in general. Too many people talk on them too much. I'll have somebody pull in front of my car and nearly hit me, and I'll look to see what they're doing in their driver's seat, and I'll give you one guess what it was they were focusing on. Cell phone baby, awwww yeaaah. Plus you gotta love how you always have a girl in class whose phone goes off when everybody's taking a test. And her conversation usually goes something like this:

""Hello? Yeah. I'm taking an exam right now. Uh-huh. Oh really? Where? Hmmm. (notices people looking at her) Uh, I'll call you back. Bye.""

And of course they always have to have those really annoying, loud, two-minute long ringers. Can't you people put them on vibrate? Sheesh. Inneundo aside, a cellphone vibrating in your pants is a lot less distracting than a cellphone blaring loud obnoxious music out of your pants. You wouldn't think it would be, but it is.

Anyway, so I got a cellphone. My old one was really bulky and lame and I never used it. My parents made it a surprise christmas gift and pretended they spent a ton of money on it. It was free, I found out later. In any case, they actually DID spend money on my new cellphone (for the adapter), and the new one is the kind I always wanted: flip-top, LCD screen, and blue glowing buttons. Ooooh, pretty.

Unlike my old cellphone, which was basically a car phone, I plan to use the new cellphone a lot more, especially this fall. Unlike the last couple semesters, I plan to not be in the dorm as much, and I will keep myself busy. However, I'll still keep my old crotchety opinion of the vast majority of cellphone users. And I won't use it like they do. I'll actually turn it OFF when watching movies or while in class, or at least put it on silent or vibrate and not answer it until after class. Unless it's news that a giant sandworm is heading straight for my dorm room, or my supply of York Peppermint Patties is about to run out. Or if Will actually got out of his chair. Then I'll answer it."

"event","Wow, what a weird time I've had.

Here's a run-down of what I've been up to:

Well, it's pretty obvious that I haven't updated since February. I figured this livejournal thing was just a phase, so I let it slide and busied myself with other things.

Now for the summer. Okay, where to begin...

First off, I have to say that this has been one hot and rainy summer. I took a maymester class; History 400 - The American Civil War in Films. Every single day it rained. I mean EVERY single day. I would be walking to class, in sandals, thinking ""oh, what a beautiful day,"" and suddenly rain fell down from the sky like a monsoon and I would walk into class completely drenched. Fun stuff. At least I got an A in the class. :P

The final day of maymester I had an accident. Apparenly there was a leak in brake fluid for my back brakes, so my car had been riding on the front brakes for a long time, and there was no indicator on my dashboard for the leak. Because of all the stress, my brakes eventually gave out when I was trying to park the car downtown and I ran into a wall. I was fine, the car was fine, the wall wasn't. The insurance company put me at fault until the auto place discovered the leak. As of now, I'm still not sure what's going to happen, but the leak will probably help me out, ironically.

Since then, I've been working at the Seneca Cinemas. I'm trying to raise up a thousand dollars to pay for books, whatever my car payment will be, food and gas for the school year, and also (hopefully) a new computer. To get that much money, I've been working 40 hours a week, and with Spider-Man 2 recently coming out, I'm getting very worn out. The customers are really not with it, either. I'll tell them the movie they want to see is on their right, and they'll go left. I'll tell them the movie is the second theater on the right (the one with their movie sign above it - clear as day), and they'll go on the left, or walk all the way down the hall. They just don't pay attention. Most of the teenagers and senior citizens are really pushy, and rude. They want things done immediately. They don't want to wait for us to clean the movies out after the previous crowd leaves. Hell, they don't even want to wait for the movie to end. They just want to run right in there and spill all their drinks and popcorn on the floor and be done with it. Fine by me, but I'm not taking the blame for it. Working at the theater has made me pretty jaded towards customers. I don't mean it in an angry way, but they really are just like sheep. It's sad, really.

But hey, at least I get to see movies for free, and can take friends and parents for free, too. That's the only benefit, because working for min. wage would take an hour of work to pay to see one movie. It isn't worth that much :P But still, it beats working at the Sizzler, where half of your co-workers are ex-convicts. Yikes.

I took a break from work and went with Artie on a camping trip. We found a place advertised online that was supposedly by the lake. It was called Anderson KOA Kampground. Let me tell you - DON'T GO THERE!! Artie and I got there, were greeted very rudely by the staff, had to buy firewood because the place was supposedly filled with diseased wood (BULL!) and had a camp site no bigger than my bedroom next to the road less than five yards away from a dozen other campsites. Artie and I were the only ones that were actually ""camping"". We had a tent, sleeping bags, hiking backpacks, the works. Everybody else had RVs and gas grills. A group of mexicans camped across from us, and played loud mexican music all night long. Whenever Artie and I laughed about something we were talking about, or even raised our voices, the mexicans would call out ""Please be quiet"" and then would proceed to blast their music and jabber their asses off for hours on end. Hypocrites.

The campsite had a big metal pot that we were supposed to put our firewood in. Only thing was, the wood wouldn't burn, and the kettle suffocated the fire. So we tossed a lot of the ""diseased"" wood and needles surrounding us in there and poured tons of lighter fluid in it to get it to start up. It finally got going and we had a decent meal. We drank some beers to toast my 21st, and had cigars, which were excellent. I love cigars. Anyway, we went to sleep, or at least Artie did. It happened to be the hottest day of the summer, and I couldn't get to sleep until five in the morning. It didn't help that instead of being next to the lake, we were next to the interstate!! Those false advertisers put us right next to the road, and all night loud trucks and some planes roared by, disturbing my sleep. I finally fell asleep, but an hour later, somebody walked up to our tent and stood outside it. We both woke up and the person ran off. We got packed up and left, and didn't even check out. Now I'm trying to get a trip planned with Diana to go to the Barnwell State Park or something close to there. I would like to see her again, and if you're reading this now Diana - get online! :)

I'm thinking of taking my hours down to 30, and actually taking time out to do stuff outside the theater for a change. :P I've hardly been online this summer, for several reasons. One, my home PC died, and my brother replaced it with an upgraded model. The new PC died, too. My parents got rid of Earthlink, and I had no way of getting Earthlink software on my laptop. My brother-in-law visited this week and hooked us up with AllVantage (because my parents are cheap and don't want DSL...). He gave me the software and now I'm finally online again at home. Before, I would stop by my dad's office, trying not to get towed by parking services and only getting online for an hour or so at a time, with no time to get Instant Messenger. Now that'll change.

I turned 21 this June. Unfortunately, nobody was around to celebrate with me. My parents were both out of town. My mom was at my sister's, spending time with her favorite thing in the world - her grandaughter. Then she comes home and leaves less than a week later to go see her mother in the nursing home. Then she comes back and my sister comes to visit, for her birthday, and brings the baby so my mom sees her yet again. In two weeks, my mom will leave to go back to see my sister and her baby. I guess nobody realizes I'm home. Hell, I never had a birthday party, but it really doesn't matter. I don't want one now, since it's pretty much a moot point anyway. I would like it if my mom would lay off the baby for ten minutes and actually cook food for my dad and I, or go shopping or see a movie. It's not like I see her at all during the school year, and with most of my friends spread out across the map, family is all I have right now, and they're ignoring me. Bollocks I say! >:(

I've become obsessed with Trigun. At first I thought it was just a silly show, but I saw the second half and it was phenominal, and very deep. I got the DVD collection (as well as the Berserk collection) on ebay for only $30 (each), and they're import DVDs with both english and japanese dialogue and subtitles. And they're region free! Eat that over-priced American DVD retailers!!

So today, the day after Independence Day, I'm working constantly, obsessed again with anime, have a niece crying her head off all day long, and struggling through dial-up internet. Agh. Time for work. I'll finish this when I get back."

"event","Yeah, I got lazy and didn't update for a while. Oh well.

Lots of stuff has happened, like me walking into Western Civ. II on Tuesday only to discover the test was that day and not Thursday! That sucked. I seriously am beginning to dislike the teacher's obsession with asking questions on the tiniest, most insignificant details from the reading. It would help if we had an actual text book in there, too.

Watched Girl Interrupted and The Ninth Gate this week. Awesome movies. Definately need to watch them again sometime soon.

Also found this very interesting trailer on the net: <a href=""http://202.212.245.207/htmls/movie/trailer_high.html"">Casshern</a>

Be warned, this is a high-quality trailer, so I hope you have something other than a 56K or you'll be waiting a while.

This movie looks awesome. Apparently it's a live-action remake of Kashan (or Cahsan, or Casshern, or Kasharn...there's about twenty billion different spellings for it): The Robot Hunter. I remember seeing the OAV remake on the Sci-Fi channel a few years back, and I thought it was interesting, mostly because I recognized it as the artist who did the Gatchaman remake as well. I'm not sure, but I think the series was originally drawn by Yoshitaka Amano, of Final Fantasy fame. In any case, a lot of people who have seen the trailer think it's badass, especially the second half. I frankly really loved the first half, where it's setting up the world itself. When I saw that it was a superhero/giant robot movie, I thought ""aw, come on!"" but when I found out it was Kashan: Robot Hunter, I thought it might not be too bad. I really want to find the soundtrack to this movie. I love the atmospheric music in the first half of the trailer. Very Silent Hill-ish. :)

Well, I have a statistics test Monday and a Sociology test Thursday. Plus a Map/Image quiz in Western Civ. I on Tuesday. I swear...it's just constant quizzes and exams. No rest for the weary, eh? I'm wondering how I'm ever going to start writing and painting at this rate. I'm having to take one or two exams every week for the next few weeks, and this is <i>after</i> I just took all of the first exams. I like not having all my exams in one week, but having them spaced out a week apart just makes it mind-numbing having an exam every single week. Arrgh!"

"event","It was freezing today. And it's been raining a lot too. They say the roads might ice over night. That would be great if school was cancelled, though I worry about how many accidents will happen on the roads for the poor people who don't get a day off?

Got the Environmental Science exam out of the way. The teacher said it would have a lot of multiple choice and a few short answers. Well, this translated into 20 multiple choice questions and four one-page essays! Holy crap, it was a long exam, but at least it's finished. Two down, three to go!

Wrote my Mentor essay for my dad's sociology class. He's the subject of the essay, so it should be interesting to see how he grades it. I'm not trying to suck up to him, as I would have written it about him regardless of who taught the class, but it's still funny to see what will happen (or he might just give me an F. D'oh!).

Wrote a little more of the history behind the epic story. I think I'm going to write out the plotline of the books I was going to base it off of into the actual history itself, so I can make it a lot easier on myself when I actually write it out!

The hamster bit me yesterday, but it didn't break the skin, or even leave a mark. It was more of a ""let me go so I can go play on my wheel"" kind of bite. I think he's identifying me as his owner, so he's going easier on me. Either that or he just recognizes me as his food-provider ;p

Earlier today I heard somebody knocking on people's doors. I looked outside and my suspicions were confirmed - maintenance people! They were checking the rooms nearby and I took the hamster and hid him in Sean's room, and Sean helped me hide him. The maintenance people came in later and told us they needed to check our overhead light. Apparently Greg's next door neighbor's light fixture snapped loose and swung down against the wall next to his bed. Now to prevent lawsuits, they had to check all the other light fixtures in the building. The hammy's back now.

I'm sure everybody's heard about the Janet Jackson incident at the Super Bowl. Frankly, I'm certain it was staged by Timerlake and her. But anyway, it's kinda funny when something that happened during halftime is talked about more than the actual game itself. Hell, it's even talked about more than the commercials this year! Now, I'm not saying I want to see wanten nudity shown to families across the world, but it is kinda funny if you think about it...well, more ironic than funny...I'll shut up now. BTW, I actually missed the infamous event. My roommate and I decided to play a game of Smash Bros. during the halftime show, and we started playing right when Janet Jackson neared the end of the song. So I missed it by a few seconds. Oh well, I'll live.

Got the Daytona trip almost finished in terms of the planning stages. Still waiting for responses from about 3-4 people. Hopefully we can get at least 2 more so we can get a condo! Whoo hoo! 

Okay, <i>now</i> I'll shut up."

"event","Hmm, quite a crazy Super Bowl this year! The commercials were okay, but the one that really stuck out in my mind was the commercial for Troy. That movie looks awesome. Epic on a Return of the King-scale. I'm so happy that epic movies are making a comeback. There's just something so cool about epics.

Starting working on a historical account of a story I'm working on. I think I might make it Silmarillion or Bible-esque and cover lots of events and people and such. It should be pretty crazy when I finish it, but it will give me a stable background from which to write the story off of.

Got an Environmental Science exam tomorrow. I don't think it's going to be <i>that</i> hard, but you never know with that teacher. Stupid Super Bowl having to be so distracting! :P"

"event","Well the hamster is officially a sadist. He bit Diana on the finger when we were playing with him and drew a LOT of blood. We cleaned her up and slapped a band-aid on her. Later we found blood stains all over the wall. Craziness.

We took pictures of the hamster later, though I was afraid to handle him because of his track record of biting people. Maybe we should call him Nibbler or Biter. In any case,here are some pictures!

We're going to see how he does over the next few days, but frankly I think he's too bloodthirsty to keep. I think we'll return him next week. Hopefully they'll take him back if we don't choose to keep him. Hopefully we won't find any bodies around his cage until then!"

"event","Yesterday we got in the car and hightailed it to Anderson, just barely getting to the pet store in time. We bought a hamster for our room, and he's light brown and white with red eyes. I don't know if he's considered an albino, because he's not completely white, but the red eyes may make him considered one. We haven't named him yet, though on the way back home, Brian was playing with the hamster in the carrying box they gave us, and it bit him! Drew blood, too. We're considering calling him Smeagol for now, since it probably thought Brian had the one ring on ;p
Even bit the same hand and knuckle as in the LOTR.

Well it seems everybody's heading home today, so boredom shall ensue. I have an Environmental Science test monday, and a 2-page essay due tuesday, so I guess I should get started on those. Yay."

"event","Man, it's been a rough day. Had to get up at 7, went to my statistics lab and found out we had a quiz. Wow, that was nice. Apparently the TA thought we already knew we had to take a quiz each week based on the previous week's work. Yeah, I really knew that, considering he never mentioned it, wrote it on the board, or emailed it to us, or put it in the syllabus. Sheesh. Environmental Science also had a quiz, but it was more of a group quiz than anything else. It was fun though, met some new people in class and they were a hoot. Apparently they knew people from my highschool, which doesn't make any sense. (Why does everybody from highschool have to keep popping up in my life? Yeesh! Anyway...) It was funny that the teacher assigned us to groups <i>and</i> assigned us to seats. What is this, kindergarten?

In other news, spring break is getting tricky to plan. So far we have 7 people, including myself, planned to go to Daytona Beach, but we had about 8 others we asked to go and a lot of them are backing out due to money problems. We need 10-12 people to cut down the costs of the rooms, so we need at least 3 more people.

I'm going to start working on a graphic novel of a story I was going to try to write as a book. I just can't get the visuals I see in my head described very well in novel format, so maybe a comic style will help it out. Look for sketched pages soon, so look out for those!

Okay, off to a free stuff giveaway at the apartments. I really have no idea what it is, but some people want me to go and it includes free stuff. Hot damn! I'm there!"

It wasn't too bad, and considering it's my dad, it was full of hilarious answers to the multiple choice questions. People were snickering while taking it. I hope I did well on it, because I crammed like hell for it all last night. I shouldn't give into procrastination next time.

In other news, I'm salivating at the new Metroid game looming on the horizon. Just two weeks, my precioussss.... <b><a href=""http://www.metroid.com/zeromission/launch/index.html"">Metroid Zero Mission</a></b>

Tonight I'm going to try to get some people together and watch <b><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064116/"">Once Upon a Time in the West</a></b> which I've heard is considered one of the best spaghetti westerns ever made, or westerns for that matter. I bought it late last year, but I haven't had a chance to watch it until now (again, procrastination). I think that <b><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0378194/"">Kill Bill Vol. 2</a></b> will be like a spaghetti western, so <b>OUaTitW</b> will really get me amped up for <b>KBV2</b>."

"event","Well, this is my first post on this journal. I've used two journals before, but I got rid of them. I guess I should start off by stating that I switched majors recently. I was a Graphic Communications (Printing) major for three semesters, but I finally realized that I didn't want to be in a business-oriented career. I'm just not cut-throat enough (but I'm a pirate? Agh!).

So I switched to a History major, and I'm very happy. I'm especially happy with the much lighter workload. Where Graphics took up all my time with labs, History takes up no time at all, so I'm free to get back to the fun stuff in life, and I can also finally find time to draw and paint and write again. I knew that I wanted to switch majorswhen I took my first history course in college this semester (Western Civ II) and loved it. I wanted to take it because I wanted to get 15 hours to keep my scholarship, and I also like history in general. Never before had I left a classroom still thinking about the material before. Usually I nod off or forget everything by the time I get back to the dorm, but the history lectures stuck with me, so that's why I felt it was high time I switched majors into something I actually enjoyed.

So now I have more free time to be social and party and make a livejournal to provide commentary to you, my loyal crew! Check by once in a while, as I'll be trying to keep this journal updated as often as possible. And I'll also drop the pirate talk, too. Arrr."

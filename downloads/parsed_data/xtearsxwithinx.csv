"event","I wrote a poem the other day but it's in my notebook and I can't type it up while I'm in fashion class. We're looking up different styles and I chose EMO. Hehe, it will be so cool when I get to dress up my partner, OMG I CAN'T WAIT!!! LOLZ

Yesterday I went to the mall with Brian and he bought me the cutest bracelets. One of them is pink with sad faces on them and the other one is a black one. It's going to totally make me fit in at the next concert. Maybe I'll get some scene points!! :P LOL!

I g2g so my partner, Lizzy can use the comp to find cute emo outfits, hehe!

much <3,

"event","Man, I am so sick of these guys. All they do is walk by me and even EVAN, after all that we've been through. I flashed the smile he always liked and he didn't even hit me like he usually did.

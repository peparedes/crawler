"event","A dog wandered up to our home last week.  It was abused and starved, dehydrated, and done terrible things to that our vet thankfully could undo.  We looked for a home for her, but she's a Pitt Bull, and that's not an easy dog to place.  She made a few dog errors, but we didn't have the heart to scold her, it was all we could do to get her to come in the house.  We had to tempt her with Slim Jims, and even then she would take it and run back to the porch.

It was sad, but endearing.  I guess we have a soft spot for mistreated strays.  Anyway, I was bound and determined not to keep her.  Don't have enough time, don't have the room, don't feel like feeding her, etc.  But, she just kept sitting on the porch (I had to coax her onto the couch, but now she's found a nice bed there), waiting for someone to come by that she could love.  She won't leave the yard, hasn't bothered the neighbors, hasn't torn up the trash, or carried off the Aquarius newspapers sitting on the porch.  All in all, she couldn't be a nicer guest.  And she's ran all those wild cats off, which is a bonus.

So when no one came to get her, I started thinking about taking her to the pound.  I know they will put her down, it's the law.  And I just kept thinking, how could I let that happen, when she's just sitting out there waiting on me to open the door so she can love on me.  

So, I called a family meeting tonight, and we've all decided that if she's stays we're going to have to make a few changes, but we feel that those changes would be for our best and highest good anyway, such as picking up after ourselves, not leaving food dishes laying around, etc.  So, we've decided to call her Miss Celee (whoopie from the color purple) cuz, she had a rough start, but finished off real well.  And she seems quite happy about the decision.

So, we have a new member at the  covenstead, and I guess I'm starting be happy about it."

"event","Well, I think I've finally figured out the hold up.  I am feeling so much less pressure now.  I may actually be able to work on it today...

Time will tell.

Keslevar is/was supposed to do the cover.  I have an idea of what I want, but all I'm getting from him is ""It can't be done that way.""  Well, I would accept that excuse except that's what he always says when I ask him to do something/anything out of the ordinary.  I know if I stick to my guns, I will get what I want, but I'm really getting sick and tired of playing this game.

We did the same thing this weekend.  I ask for something.  He says, ""Can't do it.""  I say, ""Oh, sure you can.  Do it like this.""  He says ""It won't work that way.""  then I say, ""Alright then, I'll do it myself.""  Then he finds a way.  Why?  Because he can't let a girl outdo him?  Or because he was hoping I would change my mind?  I have a really wonderful husband, and I love him dearly, but this is a very stupid game, and I'm tired of playing it.

So, I've been sitting here, not working on my book since we cut the CD this September.  The CD has been sitting here waiting on him to do the cover, and get copies made so we can start selling it.  No wonder I'm not motivated to work on the book.  Why bother, the cover will never get finished anyway.  I guess my subconscious thinks it's a lot easier to be frustrated with myself, than him.

Well, my subconcious can think what it wants, now that this has found its way to my conscious mind I can deal with it.  This game is over...

Hmmmm, Since I figured it out first, does that mean I win? :-)"

"event","I'm so excited.  Christy and Jason, two of my new students, are bringing the concrete for the sweat lodge we are building at the covenstead this year.  We now have all the materials we need to build it (except for maybe a truckload of sand).  We have this really cool tradition of building a womb-like structure for our Imbolg ritual.  We get in and gestate.  We drum, sing, eat and drink decadent, yummy foods, and plan out our goals for the coming year.

But, we are always sad when the womb comes down, and we can't get in it anymore.  It's a really comforting feeling, like you can really connect with the mother energy inside it.  So we decided last year to build a permanent one.  The structure is very similar to a sweat lodge.  I can't wait to get out there and start building."

"event","Here is something of note that you don't see everyday.  We, as in my husband and children, are changing our surname to Teague, which is my maiden name.  It all started with a conversation on numerology, which lead to Keslevar asking about the vibration of our last name.  According to Linda Goodman, Thompson doesn't come up to the best number you could ask for, but Teague on the other hand is very good.

Now, silly witches that we are, this is very pertinent information.  But, not enough reason alone to change our surname.  Yet, there is more.:-)

One of my father's big concerns in the life is to pass on his family name.  He was the only son, and then he had only one son as well, who went on to have 5 daughters and then get the big snip.  Thus no male heir to the Teague Coat-of-Arms.

Keslevar has no connection with his family name, as his mother and father split months after their marriage (they were both 17), and he's never really had any connection with his father, Larry.  Larry also grew up with a different last name from the rest of his family, and never got to know his father.  Keslevar sees this as a pattern he'd rather not perpetuate.

So, in light of all this, we're changing our last name to Teague.  

The interesting thing about it for me is that I remember the internal changes that happened in my life when I changed my last name to Thompson.  At the time, I felt the new vibration was a welcomed change from the extreme lifestyle of my late teens and early twenties.  Now that I'm coming up on 40, I'm ready to shed the quiet, wallflower vibration of Thompson, and get back into the swing of stuff.  

Remembering me from before my marriage, and knowing me now... I think the world may be in for more than it bargained for.  I can't wait to see what the Lady unfolds for me now."

"event","I'm grateful for:

My children storming in with laughs and smiles all excited about getting to pop bubblewrap that had came in the mail.  I think bubblewrap would make a great Yule gifts for my little fairies.

My son's ability to sit beside me and be my 'lucky-charm', so that I can get him over a difficult level on his 'b'ideo game (he's 3).

My sweet husband, Keslevar, for cleaning up the kitchen, taking out the trash, and then bringing me my morning coffee, while I layed in the bed and read the current edition of ""The Mountain Astrology"" this morning.

Morning Coffee

and Figuring out how to use this Live Journal stuff.  That's something I can check off my to-do list."

"event","Good Morning everyone, this is Demeter.  Our dearest Bella has
been so kind, and taken the moment off so that I may express myself this
morning.

I MISS MY BABIES, My Kores!  I miss all your adorable, lovable, sweet faces.
I miss your hugs, and laughter.  I miss your innocent questions, and your
bubbly excitement.

I look forward to seeing you at class tomorrow.  Darn these holidays and
their incessant scheduling complications.  One would think that a Goddess
wouldn't have to compromise with the rest of the pantheon.  I will be much
more content once this infernal cycle of rest has completed it's season, and
I can get on with the business of loving and nurturing my beloved children.

I know that if I were to hold you in my brilliant embrace for the whole of
the year, that my eternal presence would scorch and burn your to death,
robbing you of your right to direct your own course.  Yet, I miss you when
you're resting.  I am proud that you have responsibilities of your own, and
are tending to the many other aspects of your universe.  I see you growing
into me, returning to me, understanding me better through internalizing me,
and it comforts me.

Yet, it is a sending of you, and not YOU.  It is an e-mail, a phone call, an
afterthought to your day, letting me know you miss me too, a bittersweet
reminder that while we are not together today, soon we will be.

Spring will come, I will be renewed as the Venus, reawakening the hot
passion in your blood, and together we will rise again.

But today.  I MISS MY BABIES!

I remain a frustrated Sun Goddess, eclipsed in the depth of dark.

You loving mother,

Demeter"

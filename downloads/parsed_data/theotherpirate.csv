<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v11/bridgetcore/intergalactical/ConorOberst2.jpg""> 3. march/03 teen art project

1. um..the first one is Kelly Osborne, i don't fancy her at all but i really liked the picture. the original copy is a whole like smaller, i graphed that in art class. my shading definetly got better since that last teen art project

2. This looks messed up, well the shading does, its just that i hadn't made it that darl and when i tried scanning it it came out bad so i edited it to make it darker and i know it looks a little funny, i think the real piece looks better. does joey agree? oh and its Conor Oberst.

3. This was the first teen art project i did in about a day. The shading isn't good at all, becasue there isn't much, i just made the contrast higher on the computer, but i think the outline is pretty good. it's Conor Oberst once again.

that's all for now. i really need to start drawing though, other then when i have to for art class"

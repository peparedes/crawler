"event","Here, tell me what you make of this one:

Cereal -- buy one at $4.29, get one free [Walgreeen's on Smithville in Belmont]. A box of Fruit Loops priced at $4.29, and a box of Lucky Charms for $4.29: should be compatible with the sale, correct? WRONG! You forgot the fine print: ""only on 15 oz. boxes."" The Lucky Charms come in 14 oz. boxes. Of course, you only make this realization after you've made the purchase and driven five blocks out of the lot -- the sudden awareness compels you to return immediately and try your damnedest not to create a scene in your stubborn, stoned rage: you've just paid $8.59 for two boxes of cereal. Do not pass go -- do not collect 200 dollars. Will these two fine food products (Fruit Loops and Lucky Charms) ever be available at a discount price together? No: the former is owned by Kellogg's, the latter by General Mills. Although Kellogg's has now patented the Marshmellow Fruit Loops -- another fine product -- they are not available at most locations and must be sought after in supercenters where the self-check-out lane is just as crowded and slow-moving as the one with the pregnant woman whose gift card won't swipe (yes -- we've already tried typing the number in manually). And if the Marshmellow Fruit Loops are not advertised more prominently (or at all, for that matter), how is this expected to be a logical alternative to the staple cereals available at most convenience stores? My point (and I do have one) is this: Why must the rivalry between G&M and Kellogg's stand in the way of satisfied cereal consumers? Why must corporate greed squash yet another American dream -- of being able to stock up on both marshmellow and fruit-based cereals at a reasonable price? And why must I have to live with paying nine bucks for two lousy boxes of cereal (yes, she offered to exchange the one for me -- but who, in their right mind, can surrender an unopened box of Lucky Charms)? It's just so wrong.

I want to go out like Nico--a heart attack while riding my bike in Ibiza. I want to lie dead on a desolate road with a nice view and not be discovered til days later, so my lifeless body can--for a little while--bask beneath the simple pleasures that I only enjoyed in my lost childhood. But I will never be Nico--I will never be anything--I will forever be an incongruent mix of desires, and none will ever be fulfilled. I will always be nothing--there's nothing I'd rather be. Except Nico, perhaps. But it's foolish to think of such nonsense.

I just kept on coughing and coughing and falling and hacking all over myself, and she immediately gave me a spoonful of codeine, a rescue inhaler, an Advair disk, and some gelcap that supposedly numbs your throat so as to soothe the irritation. It took awhile, but the combination eventually fixed it all and now I'm breathing again. I just hope that never, EVER happens again, because it was the most absolutely TERRIBLE experience.

Well, I suppose it's time for someone to say something about good ol' Hunter. For those of you who have not heard the news yet, journalist, druggie, and -- let's face it -- poet Hunter S. Thompson shot himself in the head Sunday night. This had a particularly deep impact on me, since this essentially implicates one of the (few) artists I felt intellectually connected to doing himself in with the method of my choice.

One particularly traumatic event is taking place in the life of a good friend, and it's simply going to have to be confronted and dealt with, in spite of the painful consequences it will trigger. The only traumatic event to happen to me personally, however, was my struggle with Last Life: so Borders told me it was in their inventory -- they should have one copy on the floor -- but they couldn't find it anywhere. Later on I discovered that a staff member must have bought it before it was even officially released, which is just fucking inconvenient, to say the least. So now I'm dealing with the ever-pleasant ordering routine at Borders (I had vowed never to return -- ""we're all victims of our own hypocrisy"" [Michael Corleone in Godfather Part II]). I probably won't get it til monday. But in the meantime, I finally got In the Mood for Love, another one of my favorites that I've been searching for unsuccessfully for about a year now.

"event","- My interjection to two classmates discussing their hunger.

I took four somas last nite and it did absolutely nothing for me -- as if you even needed further proof that there is, indeed, something severely wrong with me. Oh well. A movie I've been willing to kill for in order to see is finally being released today on DVD: it's a Japanese mood piece from last year called Last Life in the Universe, about a suicidal librarian who falls in love with a woman that has to leave town at the end of the week. It looks so desperately romantic, I just know it will wind up on my top whatever list. The only problem is going to be finding a place that carries it in stock (I'm not waiting two days to order it, beyotch). Wow, that just reminded me of someone I haven't thought about in a long time: his name's Bryan Bias. He was ""the fat kid"" of last year's graduating class at our school, and he was one of my few friends -- he and Camron and another really nice kid named Josh Kapsch. Together we had resolved that ""beyotch"" should officially replace the period at the end of every sentence -- everyone would be so much happier if they ended their thoughts with ""beyotch,"" ya know?

Today is a truly beautiful day, and there are few occasions on which I can say that and actually mean it. I stepped out of school listening to Belle & Sebastian and found myself not having to button up my coat or even bundle the scarf around my neck. It was quite nice. I have to work today, but I think I'm up for it -- I'll take another soma and pray that it actually kicks in. In fact, the only thing that's pissed me off in my day so far was that stupid-ass poser bitch Gio trying to argue with me that Kinsey was a good movie. I just flat-out told her I thought it sucked ass -- that I hated movies that just talk about sex; it's pointless and ignorant -- and she got all defensive and shit and was like, ""but no one knew that stuff at the time: he changed the world!"" Fuck you bitch. Just because you have a fascination with not only talking about your own sex life but everyone else's as well, doesn't make that dumb-ass perv prick any more relevant to society. It was a shitty movie by my standards and that's that.

Speaking of movies, I saw Bad Education opening nite last friday (loved it, of course -- Almodovar's one of my favorite directors) but recently learned that the manager of the Neon, Jonathan (who's one of the nicest fucking guys I know, by the way -- and Almodovar IS his favorite director), is going to have to stop running it after this week because it performed so poorly. Stupid fucking MPAA with its stupid fucking NC-17 rating. Anyway, I guess my point is that it's a great fucking movie and you should all see it while you still can.

I have high hopes for the evening (and I mean that quite literally). I'm hopefully getting my hands on a copy of Last Life, then getting my hands on half-an-ounce, and then spending the evening with Matt and Amy. And tomorrow (hopefully) I'll see Danno and the Holy Fucking Spirit (I've decided ""Fucking"" deserves to be capitalized, as well). Perhaps after all the shit I put up with last week the gods are finally cutting me a break. Or perhaps they're just trying to delude me into thinking everything's okay so they can drop the bomb on me when I least expect it. Whatever. Regardless of the circumstances, I'll always have a song to sing and a friend to sing it for. Which reminds me of a Peter Murphy quote (which will bring a quick death to this seeming mammoth of a journal entry):

""What is a Song without a Singer?
And what is a Voice without a Song to be sung?""

But at least this gives me an opportunity to post something other than the words of another to express my anguish. I feel really terrible. I'm starting to shake alot at random times and I find myself often sitting in my room, not knowing what to do, making the fatal error of starting to think about my life, and then buckling under the weight of my own misery and falling onto the floor in a fetal position. John Donne wrote ""no man is an island;"" I beg to differ. I am an island -- an island that is often visited but never inhabited, occasionally put to good use but usually just floating in the ocean and wondering why the fuck it doesn't just give in and sink under the waves. I guess it's just a matter of time. Why the fuck am I still here? What part of me is it that keeps strapping my arms down when I'm determined to end it -- filling me with doubt when every cell in my body tells me this is the way it has to be? Whatever it is, give me the drug I need to numb it. Give me the pill that will kill off that last shred of hope and deliver me from this mess. I'm tired of loving so much only to feel this shitty."

I think part of my problem -- part of the reason why I've been fucking below rock bottom for months now -- is not enough Woody Allen; I honestly don't know what I'd do without the man. I guess the attraction is his insistence on defying God, his determination to make it on his own regardless. And he does. Through his art -- through the expression of his own deep personal anguish -- he has defied everything else and shown (not proven, but shown) that love, or our perception of love, is all that really matters. But that still doesn't hold him from dwelling on the absurdity of life and the horror of death. Whatever. His movies just help me -- the characters and their actions all make perfect sense to me. And beneath every cynically comedic monologue, I sense the same psychological suffering I've endured in my life. So I think I'm going to run through my Woody Allen library tonight. And now I must apologize for yet another perfectly useless anecdote.

I wish I could be happy, but that would be wrong. It got me thinking tonight when I was talking with Amy about Joy Division and New Order -- if Ian Curtis hadn't hanged himself, then Closer wouldn't have turned out to be the suicide note it indeed was. It got me thinking about my own life, and how if I didn't do myself in, everything I've stood for, said, been, and done would have been a lie. ""To be anything more than all I am would be a lie."" And that scares me -- because at a point when I feel I have nothing left to lose, the last thing I need is someone to steal what's left of my dignity from under me. But that's just the way it is... and will always be.

Law & Order can chew my ass for all I care -- but someone needs to say something about this fucking episode they just broadcasted (hey, I was at Amy's, and all her husband does is watch TV -- what else was I to do?), which had absolutely no resolution. They stopped it right before the guy gave the verdict. Now who the fuck does that -- honestly? Who throws a shoe? Well I just stood right up and yelled in their living room, ""that's bullshit! Bullshit's what THAT is!""

Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is a very long movie, I've discovered. Long and tedious. It's okay, I suppose -- interesting visuals; but it's just long, and I couldn't follow the story, and it was all-around rather uninvolving. But whatever. I'm listening to Sandinista! tonight. And thank you Amy Crowley for introducing me to Peter Murphy and the song ""Cuts You Up.""

I really wish I could be with the one I love and be happy and complete and all, but that would be wrong, too. ""Happiness is not for keeping -- happiness is not my goal."" But it is. ""So this is why I'm leaving.""

My dad just told me to go to church tomorrow. Amy gave me a bowl's worth tonight, which I intended to save for my first day of my last semester in high school. But there's no fucking way I'm going to church sober, I'll tell ya that much.

So just bring on The Clash (and yes -- I am wearing the fucking T-shirt, as well).

I was out of pot (although that last bit from wednesday night just kind of reappeared in my bag), out of gas, and out of money, which is essential for both. Yet I somehow managed to scrounge up 8 bucks (which then went straight to $7.01 worth of gas and a 99 cent bag of Doritos) and make it over to Amy Crowley's. She knew in advance how terrible I was feeling and graciously kept me supplied with a cigarette at all times. She then asked if I'd get a bag for her, and told me she'd give me some of it -- an offer I found myself incapable of refusing. On the drive there, I told her more and more details about how fucked up my life was, and she handed me her personal pill bottle and told me I could have whatever. I'd kinda quit Xanax there for awhile (it just depresses me too much), but I was so fucked-up already... what the fuck did it matter? Well, after having gone the previous night without sleep and most of the day without food, pot and Xanax didn't seem all that intent on keeping me alert. I intended on heading home around 10:30, but I ended up passing out on her couch on the way to the door for half-an-hour. I guess she was trying to wake me up the whole time, but I was just plain fucking gone. When I woke up at 11:00, I looked up at Amy's frantic face, took 5 mins. to figure out what exactly happened, called home, and took off only to numb my brain with My Bloody Valentine on the way. And the only reason I actually still know all this is that I spent today piecing together evidence and making phone calls -- otherwise, I would've forgotten it all plain and simple. Now it just kinda feels like ""jamais vu"" or something. I don't know. I really just plain don't know.

"event","I got out of bed this morning in a shitty hotel room with a pretty girl lying next to me, and I was instantly depressed. I knew I had a shitty day laying ahead of me, and there wasn't a single fucking soul in the world who was going to help me through it, and -- most importantly, I assume -- my life was crumbling apart, and I wasn't going to do a single goddamn thing about it. So now I'm writing this in the middle of that particularly shitty day, and remembering getting out of bed, going for a cold, bitter morning drive, and returning only to sit in a lonely hotel chair, cross the right leg over the left, and wait for something to happen [for those of you who haven't been queued in, this is currently my drug-free plan to cope with all future incoming shit -- although I must admit, it's not working all that swell to date]. So being in my insomniac, drugged-up state of mind, I put on some Joni Mitchell via headphones (A Case of You) and started pondering all possible sharp objects to work myself over with. Finding myself lacking the usual luxury of $80 razor-sharp fabric scissors from work, I had to settle for my house key [I'm lame -- ""can't be helped""]. After doing the best I could on my legs, I lay down on the white sheet of the bed, watched as I bled... dreamt I was dead. And listened to Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea [by Polly] while I was at it. ""But now, we float -- take life as it comes.""

So I suppose it's time to choke on what pride I have left and just admit to the world that I was wrong and they were all right. I'm a hopeless fuck-up -- a naive lover -- a chronically depressed lunatic -- a druggie -- a truant -- an asshole. A failure at both life AND death -- because I'm sure the latter will be equally humiliating. In fact, I've said this so many times I'm obliged to vow myself never again after this: I hate myself. This life has only cost me ""money and pain"" (as McCabe would say). In fact, why the fuck am I even writing this? Vanity, vanity -- all is vanity. My mind is whirling in a million directions at the moment, but one focal point seems fairly distinct: I am forever alone, miserable, tired, and too stubborn to do anything about it. I'm starting to consider razor blades instead of pills.

I'm useless. The words bled right out of my veins, but they only collected in a puddle on the floor, which then dried up and was washed away."

I just sat in my car for an hour in the fucking snow in the middle of fucking nowhere waiting for a fucking accident to clear up so I could just get fucking home. And judging by the amount of ""fuck""'s (and/or its derivatives) included in that sentence, it must've been a helluva lot more frustrating than I'd suspected. I guess it really wasn't that bad, but it scared the shit out of me, because I had pot in the car and nothing was moving and I never know what to do in these situations. But it all works somehow in the end. Nix that: the truth is that it can always only get worse, and you should just be happy that it didn't (when it doesn't, that is -- and even then, just remember: you could always run out of cigarettes at the same time, or have to pee really bad and not be able to, or be pregnant and breaking water [well I guess that last one's not all too likely for me, but you get the fucking point]). Because I've slowly learned that you have to bust your fucking ass for anything good to happen -- and if there is a supernatural force out there showing occasional mercy on us, I'd say it's about fucking time we replace it with a younger, hipper, more happy-go-lucky version with some new ideas. Whatever. I just had a shitty afternoon, and I chose NOT to do what I wanted to do tonight (for a change), and I'm semi-proud of myself for making it through it all, but at the same time wishing something good had come along (for a change). I feel trapped by life. And by all this fucking snow. I just wish one fucking person in this entire miserable world would come up to me and say, ""you know, this all sucks ass, but I love you for the mess you are, and we'll get through somehow,"" and then have hot passionate sex with me. That'd be nice.

And whether it ends now or in fifty years (and there's no fuckin' chance of that, I'll tell ya what) it'll still be pointless. I am in so much fucking pain, but I'm so numb at the same time that my mind's processing it all wrong. I'm a fucking zombie. God-fucking-damn it. I was listening to Quadrophenia on the way home from my expedition w/friends today, and when disc one came to a conclusion with ""I've Had Enough"" I burst into tears, but didn't feel anything. I am Tommy. I have no senses. I have no sense. I just want someone to feel me, see me, touch me... heal me. If only I were touched by the one I loved. Probably naive of me to presume it would help, but I've lost all faith in everything else. I feel all the sadness in the world... all at once -- not in fucking waves like these little bitchy EMO pricks. I just feel sadness. All the time. Not around me, but in me. I feel my unwanted yet irrevocable connections to everything else in the world, and I collect all the sadness, and no one will take any of it from me. Please hold me and take some sadness, just for a moment. I promise it won't hurt you near as much as it's hurt me. I used to still have manic moments occasionally, but now I'm pretty much depressive-depressive. I planned on staying 'round til summer, but I keep losing any potential motivation. I just finished watching Lost in Translation -- I'd started it last nite in a daze. I cried again at the ending. It's just so sad... the hopelessness of these relationships that we can't help but live for. Having to walk away through a crowd of faces who can't hear or even see your pain. And then we have the balls to try and comfort ourselves with false hopes. Who the fuck are we fooling? I feel like I've totally wasted your time now. For this I apologize.

I also hate the idea of being just another teen suicide. But most of all, I hate the idea of having to stay alive, of having to deal with my constant sadness day after day after day.

"event","Well, only temporarily, mind you. But still. I've been thinking alot lately about this movie I saw the other week -- it's an early Woody Allen film which was one of the few I hadn't seen yet, called Interiors. The central character, Eve, is an utter perfectionist -- a home decorator who is divorced by her husband (whose career in law she essentially built from the ground up) and falls apart when these little imperfections inevitably creep into her life. There's this very haunting scene at the end of the movie when one of her three daughters -- the one who's always had the burden of being perfect for her parents, of never doing or saying the wrong thing -- finally breaks down and screams in agony at her mother, ""I think you're just too perfect for this world."" The next scene depicts Eve walking through a lonely shore to the water and drowning herself in the waves of the ocean.

I know I don't have much time left, and I want these last few months to be as intense and real as this life should always be, but never is. I am constantly reminded of this part in the book/movie The Hours, when Virginia Woolf's husband questions her about her decision to kill off a character in her new book: ""Why must someone die -- or is that a stupid question?"" ""No, it's not stupid,"" she replies. ""Someone must die... in order that the rest of us should value life more."" The film ends with Virginia Woolf drowning herself in a river.

I really don't know why I'm being so morbid today. I mean, fuck: I'm about to go smoke a joint, so I'm pretty goddamn cheerful. I just keep thinking about the big picture of life -- about the whole tapestry that is all the people in this world, and all their interweaving connections, most of them unseen. I think about my funeral, and wonder how long it will take people to get over the fact that I won't be there anymore -- and what people are REALLY thinking when they think of this is not ""Gustave's gone,"" but ""fuck: if he's gone, I can't be long."" It all comes back to ourselves in the end. Because nothing else matters, really.

I wish I could have loved more. I'm just starting to experience this part of life, and it's been the most wonderful thing. It is, in fact, the only thing in life I haven't found to be over-rated. The only thing that hasn't disappointed me. And I fear seeing the day when it will, and I don't want to.

""Tomorrow will be different -- so this is why I'm leaving.""

Whatever. I apologize for whatever additional morbid thoughts I planted in your head -- but while they're there, I hope you take a moment to sort through them and think about the big picture, too. And if nothing else, I hope I've helped you to value this pointless fucking life just a little more. And I'll forever be grateful to those few people who understood.

And, as it is and will always be, I love you so much.

no matter how loud you shout?
And what if you can't die
no matter how many pills you take?

What the fuck are you going to do then?

"event","If any of you needed comedic relief to escape from all your gloomy thoughts about the goddamn snow, just imagine me, half-baked, shoveling the driveway for my mother in penny loafers and repeatedly slipping on ice and making a perfect ass out of myself. Oh, and I didn't say a word the entire time, either -- that is, until I finally opened up for my great stoner ranting monologue: ""See, this is why Christmas is the holiday of the devil. This is why people kill themselves on Christmas. This is why Christmas fucking sucks.""

I went out and rented a shitload of videos. Afterall, fuck it: if I'm not going anywhere, I sure as hell am not (actually, I feel like inventing a new contraction, so from now on instead of ""am not,"" I'll use the far more, well, southern ""amn't"") about to leave my room.

We've gotta keep telling ourselves that this'll all work out in the end, even though, deep down, we all know that we're all already fucked."

"event","So everyone's just fucking pissed off about the weather. I am no different. I am already beginning to feel very claustrophobic and trapped within the confines of this cold house. I just wanna be with Danno, that's all. That's all I ever really wanted, and it's all I want now. Why the fuck does everything have to be so complicated, when my desire is that fucking simple? ""Oh my fuck."" Yeah, that expletive about says it all. I smoked a shitload yesterday, more than I've ever smoked before (and I wasn't sharing it with anyone, either -- I had no one to fucking share it with because of the goddamn snow!). By the time I sort of passed out (it was more like finding yourself unable to move while lying down in bed with some news channel on mute on the telly), I was just plain fucking retarded and had happily forgotten all this other shit that's bugging me. But now I'm sobering up and I'm pissed off again. Actually, I'm still a little retarded come to think of it, so I'm even MORE pissed off. And because of the goddamn snow, I can't go out and buy anything more to smoke. Goddamn it.

Oh, yeah, and on top of everything else, I'm fucking horny."

"event","I woke up at 3:01 this morning -- that's when I started throwing up. I didn't finish til around 8. I don't know what it was, some bad chili or something (even though I don't eat chili, but you get the point) -- whatever: I just couldn't stop puking. And I'm a terrible barfer. I can't just throw up in one big heave like most people -- no, my vomiting consists of tiny, pained heaves that often leave me in tears. And then, when I ran out of things to throw up, I started dry-heaving, which hurts like hell. Your ribs just feel like they're going to cave in, and there's nothing you can do about it. So I pretty much spent my morning hunched over the toilet in the dark, while everyone else slept peacefully. By the time 8 o'clock came around, I was just sitting on the toilet permanently, because I was getting sick of having to get out of bed every twenty minutes to try and puke again. So there I was, my pants around my ankles, no shirt on because I don't have any shirts that I feel comfortable being sick in. And I felt it coming again. And then the last of it (hopefully) came up, and I collapsed naked on the bathroom tile. I don't know how long I lay there, but it was a long time. I just didn't care anymore; nothing really mattered. All I knew was that I wanted the pain to end."

"event","So I just listened to The Velvet Underground & Nico in its entirety, and then put on some Royksopp. Dammit, I really wish that Quadrophenia and Sandinista! and my PJ Harvey and Doors CD's had all arrived in the mail by now, because I could be listening to them and that would be nice. I'll have to wait til monday. I've been really worried about how things are going to work out lately -- even insignificant shit like school -- and I found some comfort in these words from the Jesus & Mary Chain:

""and the way it all falls together
is the way it all fits.""

Bring on the Nirvana!"

"event","So yeah, there was definitely much more left over in my bowl from last night's joint than I thought, thus now I'm a lot higher than I had expected myself to be tonight. Which is nice. I just listened to two great track 6's off of two great albums -- Us and Them from Dark Side, and April Skies from Jesus & Mary Chain's 21 Singles (Danno, listen to this song RIGHT NOW -- it's so fucking beautiful, and the riff right after the first chorus, right in the middle of the song, is practically orgasmic) --, and am going to continue the evening's soundtrack with some Velvet Underground perhaps, or Bowie or solo Reed (Jesus and God!). And then Hedwig, because I really wanted to listen to Origin of Love at some point last night, but passed out before I had a chance to. So for the time being, things are looking up."

I've looked around eBay and found all the stuff currently up for bid by <i>It's a Wrap</i>.  Find the link <a href=""http://search.ebay.com/_W0QQfrppZ25QQfrtsZ0QQsassZitsawraphollywoodQ2ecom"">here</a>.  I don't know what an ST fan would like, though.  It needs to have a Shatner tie-in (god, don't even ASK).

Would love it if you could point something out to me that would be cool.  Or if you know of any other collectible site that you could point me to, that would be extra cool."

<i>Hi Gang:

The time has come for this message board to join many others in the mb graveyard in cyberspace. It was the first, and at one time, probably the busiest and best - but all good things must come to an end! Since my interest in The West Wing dissipated a very long time ago, the board was kept open only because a) so many people were having fun with it, and b) we had a wonderful group of moderators who agreed to do all the monitoring and the work. All I have done for the past several years is pay our bills. 

So, with many fond wishes, some very fun/funny memories, this serves as a two-week notice that this board will close on September 13, 2004. This should allow all of you enough time to find other places to post about the show, and to trade email addresses with those friends that you might have made here. Although I haven't been around much since the infamous board crash of....what year was that, anyone remember? I still bid you all a fond adieu!

cheers,
TT </i>

It's really the end of an era.  This is more than just a sniffle.  It's a flat-out sob."

"event","Stolen from Em <lj-cut text=""The Alias Meme"">

<b>FIRST, THE REQUIRED QUESTIONS</b>

<b>1. Favorite episode and why:</b>

That's tough.  I'd say it's <i>Phase One</i> because it was the first ep I'd ever seen.  And the kiss still melts me.  But I might have to go with <i>A Dark Turn</i>, since it's so Irina/Jack heavy.  Plus, it's a great ep.  

<b>2. Favorite characters and ships. Plus why:</b>

Favorite characters: I really love Jack.  I love his character arc, and that it wasn't done so quickly.  Plus, Victor Garber is the shit.  

Weiss, of course, is such an under-used character.  They could do so, so much more with him and they haven't.  And that's a real shame.

Favorite ships: I told <lj user=""kelbelle""> once that I go for the easy ships because I'm too lazy to actually put effort forth on a ship that I'm never going to see.  Sigh.  So I'm still a Sydney/Vaughn fan.  I'm waiting to see how season three pans out as far as their relationship goes.  But I loved the looks, the tension, the everything of the first two seasons.  Until I watched <i>Counteragent</i>.  And then I THREW things at my television because I couldn't BELIEVE...you know what?  I can't talk about that episode.  I'll just get angry all over again.

<b>3. When did you start watching?</b>

I fell victim to the whole ABC Superbowl ad campaign for Alias, so I watched Phase One.  But I didn't watch the other episodes until <lj user=""em_meredith""> and I chatted one day and she *made* me go to Alias Media and download the SpySex clip.  And then I was a goner.  She furthered my Alias involvement by sending me CDs of episodes she thought I should watch.  Oh, and fic recommendations.  

<b>4. What's your favorite season and why? What's your least favorite season and why?</b>

Most definitely season two.  The dynamic between Jack/Irina/Sydney was such a good storyline.  I loved how Jack tried to hold on to Sydney during that season, too.  So, so great.  

And the gag reel rocks.

<b>NEXT, A BIG BLOB...</b>

<b>5. What's your demographic info? (A/S/L)</b>

25/S/Austin, TX

<b>6. What channel does Alias air where you live?</b>

Channel 3 on Time Warner Austin.  Hurrah!

<b>7. What do you watch the show for, romance or action?</b>

All of it.  I love the wigs, the costumes, the missions.  But I also loved how Sydney tried to balance her spy life with her friends.  And I loved how Vaughn looked at Sydney.  Dude, if a guy ever looked at me like that again, I'd have a VERY hard time staying single.

<b>8. Is Vaughn worthy of Sydney?</b>

Vaughn.  What a lovesick TOOL.  Seriously, he's probably the character that annoys me the most.  In season two, I was totally on board with Jack in thinking that he had no spine.  It was mostly the Alice thing.  And then he broke up with Alice only after he and Sydney sucked face?  God, you prat.

<b>Is Irina worthy of Jack?</b>

I think Irina still loves Jack and I think Jack, even though he hates it, still loves her.  I think Sydney was right when she said that when Laura died, Jack lost his soul.  

<b>9. Where does Sark fit in? Does he fit in?</b>

Um, he's hot.  Totally and completely hot.  I really don't care about where he fits in as long as I can look at the pretty.

<b>10. What do you think of the whole Rambaldi plotline?</b>

It's pretty stupid, but the Rambaldi juice just did me in.  I think it could have been interesting if they hadn't screwed it up in season three with the Passenger bullshit.  I think that when David Carradine guest starred in season two and gave Sloane that parchment, that could have turned into something interesting.  But alas, we get SpySkipper for no damn good reason.

<b>11. Did you watch X-Files or Buffy? How does Alias compare?</b>

No to both.

<b>NOW, THE SHALLOW...</b>

<b>12. What's your favorite Jennifer Garner awards dress?</b>

I seriously considered switching teams after seeing her in the Oscars dress because she looked so friggin' fantastic.  

<b>13. What Alias cast member movie are you the most excited about?</b>

I absolutely *adore* 13 Going on 30.  Love, love, love it.  But I'm also kind of hyped about Monster in Law, cause the pics of MV on the set are just HOT.

<b>14. Give career advice to a cast member.</b>

Lena!  Trust me when I tell you that coming back to Alias would be a great move for you!  Trillions of reasons why!

<b>15. Will you be buying the S3 DVDs?</b>

God, hell yeah.  If nothing else than for Facade, which is by far my favorite episode of the season.  And the gag reel.  And Regina's commentary for The Two."

"event","Tonight I watched ""Miracle Run"" with Mary Louise Parker.  It's the story of a Corrine Morgan, who raised her twin autistic sons with incredible grace and courage.  The movie was wonderful, but I cried through most of it.

I kept thinking of TonyS, who isn't here to raise his autistic son with his wife, Lisa.  I wonder what his last words to his son were that day last year when he passed away in Iraq.  I'm still angry at this war that took a father away from the son and wife who needed him so much.  And I'm angry that, for some unknown reason, this tri-athlete died suddenly of a heart attack a million miles from home while he selflessly served his country.

I wonder if Tony knows exactly what he meant to the thousands of posters on Testy's board.  I wish there was some way I could tell him how proud I was to have known him, how grateful I was for his kindness and perspective, for his wit and his insight.  He was a good man who died too young.  

The one year anniversary of his death is August 27.  And even though he never made it back to the arms of the ones he loved, we still find him in our hearts.

We miss you, Tony.  You gave the last full measure of devotion.  We thank you."

The weekend was simply great, with the exception of the weather.  Don't know why every time we have guests to Texas (specifically Houston), it rains or is super cloudy.  Anyway, H and M seemed to have had a wonderful time.  Our Oscar party was so much fun; we had cochinita pibil for dinner, along with black beans and rice.  Sus ordered a yummy cake from a wonderful bakery (an ""And the Oscar Goes To..."" cake), and then had champagne when Fran, Phillipa, and Peter won for Best Adapted Screenplay, since that's the only one we figured was a soft category.  Fun times had by all.  We were on such a wonderful LOTRs high that we piled into Sus' car this morning and saw ROTK for the fifth time.  You shaddup.

Anyway, I'm back and ready for another week at work.  I've pretty much given up on Em sending comments/feedback on the fic I sent her, but after reading it again, I'm not going to post it anyway.  So Em, you're off the hook!  :)

Except when I miss out on seeing Tucker and PAUL.  Anyway, he had to come back for this emerging markets meeting today.  But the whole trip was so utterly confusing that, to make a long story short, he had to leave Sao Paulo last night, land in Houston this morning, take a charter plane to Austin, shower in the office, and be ready to present a 5 PowerPoint slides.  Five, y'all.  And for all that, I had to be at the airfield to pick him up at 7.  My boss is the paranoid type and this trip has been a nightmare.  A *nightmare*.  From the planning to the deciding to the private plane to the coordination.  We looked at *everything*.  It SNOWED for the first time in forever when he left for Brazil.  And it was pouring this morning.  And I was so incredibly paranoid that I'd oversleep and not pick him up and something would go wrong that I didn't sleep last night.

At all.  I have not slept.

Which means that I'm slightly delirious.  No, really.  My boss keeps trying to talk to me, asking me questions about the budget and the meeting and I keep saying, ""Hmm?""

Watched the SAG awards last night and was very pleased with most people's dresses.  Didn't get to watch all of the E! coverage, just an hour's worth.

My mother left for Houston yesterday with my dad's set of keys.  Which means that my plan to head straight for Houston this afternoon at around 3:00 is totally trashed, since my dad had to drop me off and take my car to two job sites.  Grr.  So instead of it taking me 2.5 hours to get there, I have to drive thirty miles back to my house and thirty miles back again the exact same way I came.  At that rate, I won't get to H-Town before 8.

1. Summer/Seth:  Okay, I was a huge Seth/Anna fan.  But S/S have so much more chemistry than S/A ever had.  Which is nice.  And the bad sex was quite unfortunate.  But they kept clawing at each other like they'd never seen a member of the opposite sex before.  No wonder it went by so fast.

2. Sandy/Seth Talk: This was, by far, the cutest part of the whole episode.  Not in a million years would I sit down with either one of my parents to talk about sex, but this scene really seemed to work.  I rewatched it this morning.

3. Lady Heather/Luke: As Summer says, ""Eww!""  Gross, man.  However, the Bob Seager kind of made the scene worth it.  I heart ""Night Moves.""  And the video with Joey Tribbiani was great, too.

4. Marissa crying at the table: Okay, here's my problem.  I make it a habit NEVER to cry in front of people.  Ever.  The only time you'll see me cry in front of you is when I'm watching an incredibly moving/sad movie.  Of course, <lj user=""pookha""> actually knows what I sound like when I *sob*, but that's beside the point.  The fact that Fishstick was crying at the table like a LITTLE GIRL just does not win her any points with anyone.  It was stupid and childish and she needs to eat a sandwich.  Or pancakes.  Or both.

5. Princess Sparkles: Dude, My Little Pony!  That *rules*!  Woohoo!

"event","I paid my car note, my cell phone bill, my rent, paid off a credit card, paid down another credit card, my student loan payments, showered my sister with presents for her birthday, and bought a plane ticket to Atlanta.  This is all by way of saying that I, of course, have no money left.  In fact, I checked my bank account and it's a damn good thing tomorrow is payday.  Cause at this moment, I have $13.77 left.  Which translates into knowing that I'll be eating a bag of chips and a bottle of water for lunch.

Believe it or not, I actually have a handle on my finances right now, despite what it looks like.  The paying off of my Discover bill was huge for me.  Since the beginning of 2004, I've paid off two credit cards and have one more to go.  It's such a good feeling to make that final payment and know you'll never get another bill unless you feel like racking up debt again.  And really, who wants that?

Moving on.  I wrote half a S/V fic that is currently in Em's inbox and am going to attempt to work on the rest of the S/W fic I have written exactly one page of.  Trying to figure out what I want to do with it.  Em had great suggestions which included margarita salt and a bathing suit, so I'll more than likely go that route.  I'm grateful you guys are the only ones who will be reading it."

The one drawback is that my VP, who sits right outside my desk, apparently had the same inspiration.  Which means I have to watch what's on my computer monitor.  So now fic writing, which I planned on doing while in an empty office, and no playing music above a faint whisper even though I brought Sgt. Pepper and three Tori CDs.

You don't understand what a big deal this is for me.  It's snowed maybe three times my entire life.  All three times, the snow has completely melted by the time we got out of bed.  This is actually the first time that it's snowed, the snow has stuck to the ground, and it's kept falling.

Here's the thing.  I'd never actually seen snow.  I'm from South Texas, y'all.  We don't see a lot of snow around these parts.  When I moved to Central Texas, we thought we might see it, but like I said before, by the time the sun peeked out, it'd be gone.

So there I was, in the front yard watching my father and sister build a snowman.  A SNOWMAN, y'all.  I've never built a snowman.  Ever.  I just sat there, surrounded by white snow.  Snow.  I put my hands in it and seriously, it was like nothing I'd ever seen or felt before.  We get ice and sleet here.  Never snow.  And it wasn't melted.  It was actually stuck to the ground.  And we had at least two inches of it.  Crazy.  Freaking crazy.

So, I'm no longer a snow virgin.  I've seen snow.  Now all I have to do is actually see the ocean, and I'll be in good shape."

From BigFan:

I read Kristin's chat and she is correct about pretty much everything for once.  They did cut the S&M scene, but you will still see Lauren and Sark plotting together.

As I said before Sloane's motives are revealed REALLY soon. Regarding the stolen Rimbaldi pieces, A bad person in the CIA was instrumental in helping swipe them.

Vaughn and Syd have a great kiss scene coming up in the next few episodes, I'll tell you more when I know more. 

<i>BigFan, do you know if we'll find out more of Vaughn's time over the past two years and - I almost can't believe I am asking this - if we'll learn when/how Lauren became evil?</i>

YES absolutely. Keep in mind what I said about Lauren seeking Vaughn out. As far as I know that is still the plot. I know people mentioned her ""turning evil"" recently, but from all I've heard from my source, she planned the Vaughn met and marry scenerio.

From what I heard, evil Lauren will be a lot more palatable than ""good"" but bland Lauren."

Here's the spoiler information someone posted to TWoP:
I just got a call from Touchstone Television (Alias studio) -- the rep says that Peter is no longer going to play that role. He was on the call sheet for today, set to play Lauren's father, but, according to the studio, scheduling changed and Peter had a conflict and had to back out. So far, no word yet on who'll replace him. That crazy S&M sex scene I told you about was cut. David Anders and Melissa George filmed the scene but the powers that be decided to scrap it - at least for now. Sark has photos of Syd and Vaughn.

Sark and Lauren decide to take over the world (a plot derived while she's in bra and undies, mmm kay) and there will be some serious carnage. Quentin Tarantino is back and we learn he's ""the man in front of the man"" (remember what I told you last week: There is a surprising reveal coming up on the Covenant boss). AND, if that's not enough deliciousness for you, Vaughn of Satan (Lauren) will get some info (ahem, photos) that will lead her to tell Syd to ""STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM MY HUSBAND."" A certain someone asks his good buddy Weiss whether it's possible to be ""in love with two women.""

austin's comments: Y'all, really.  Let's break this down.

1. The S&M scene they've been blathering on about forFREAKINever: Yeah, that was a pipe dream and they knew it.  This is ALIAS, not SATC.  There is no raunchy, steamy sex scene in the works for anything.  Talk about completely not what this show is about.  

2. The Covenant Boss surprise reveal: Yeah, nothing would surprise me anymore.  If it ends up being Irina, Sloane or even Weiss, it's no big surprise.  At this point, the only person who would surprise me as Covenant leader would be me.

3. Vaughn asks Weiss whether it's possible to be in love with two women: My GOD!  Vaughn, you fucking LOVESICK TOOL!  Make up your mind and just PICK ONE!  Grow a spine!  Get a grip.  Make a choice, dump Blondie or Syd and just FUCKING. SHUT. UP."

Y'all, I can't begin to tell you how ready I am for a new Alias episode.  I'm practically foaming at the mouth.  I mean, if this show is going to crash and burn with all the spoiler BS we've been getting, I want to do it sooner rather than later.  Plus, I'm ready to see hot Michael Vartan again.  It's been too long since I've seen his forehead wrinkles.

In other fandom news, I have yet to see last week's WW.  I'll probably watch it right before the new one airs on Wednesday, and I'll tape the OC.  I was too busy with my nose in The DaVinci Code last week to care about anything.

Peter Jackson won the DGA for ROTK and I say it's about bloody time.  Lord.  What's a guy got to do to win an award around here?  Chris Mis won for '25' and I say whatever.  I thought Commencement was a better episode, but that's just me.

I would have more to say about the Grammy's, but I was split between watching that, Pearl Harbor (JG is determined to be on television on Sunday nights, I guess), and chatting with <lj user=""bella_lulu""> while trying to create each other's new resumes and dreaming about a better job.  I did, however, see Olivia Harrison, Yoko Ono (and she's tacked on Lennon to her last name?  Since bloody when?), Ringo, and Paul give their thanks for the President's Award.  And I needed Kleenex.  No, really.

I've also taken to watching the first disc of appendicies for LOTR: FOTR, since I'd never seen it.  Very, very interesting stuff.  Chock full of information.  I love those hobbits.

My parents are at a funeral today in Houston, which means I get to play Mother again for the third straight day.  I love my sister, but sometimes I wish she had a driver's license and her own money.  I'm tired of buying food and gas for that kid."

<i>1) How long have you had a LiveJournal?</i>
Since pretty recently.  Not very long at all.  Maybe six months or so?

<i>Why'd you get an LJ in the first place?</i>
::pointed look at Em:: Because *somebody* bugged me about it until I was insane and almost flew to her house to kill her.  And the icons were pretty cool.

<i>What's the last fictional book you read?</i>
The DaVinci Code, which I can't stop blathering on about.  Am about to start Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason tonight.

<i>4) What's the last movie you a) rented? b) saw in the theatre?</i>
a) Bend it Like Beckham and Uptown Girls.  Gag.
b) Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King on Saturday night.  You shaddup.

<i>5) What's your favourite comfort food you make for yourself?</i>
Does spooning ice cream into a bowl count?

<i>6) Recommend a fic to me that I've probably never heard of. Alias or whatever.</i>
You guys have read all the good ones.  If I had to decide, though, it's not a fic.  Probably Susannah's WW spec script, which was pretty great.

<i>7) Any exciting plans for this weekend?</i>
A trip to a tiny town in the Hill Country for a visit with family, then dim sum on Sunday morning.  Won't watch the Grammy's because music today sucks and Beatles covers and tributes by substandard musicians offend me."

<lj-cut text=""The Big Five"">
1. What would you do if you were forced to live within the constraints of the Witness Protection Program and could not contact your family ever again?

Never.  Never, ever, ever.  That would be the absolute worst thing I could possibly think of.  God, that'd be horrible.

2. What was your first fandom ever and do you still talk to people you met through it? Why or why not?

Technically, Lois and Clark was my first fandom.  But I don't really count that or Dawson's Creek.  I didn't go on any websites, I didn't read any fic.  In fact, I didn't understand the concept of fic until I read WW stuff.  So in that case, West Wing was my first official fandom.  My best friends are gals I met through that fandom, so of course, I still talk to them.

3. How do you feel when books are made into movies? Do they generally disappoint you or satisfy you? Does this encourage you to read the book after seeing the movie or vice versa?

Hmm, this is hard.  They generally disappoint me (see ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone""), but sometimes they can be really fantastic.  I'm super grateful I didn't read LOTRs before I watched the movies, cause the books bored me to TEARS and I doubt I would have wanted to watch it.  This is the one exception to the book rule.  The only movie that stayed true to the book was ""Like Water for Chocolate"", mostly because Alfonso Arau, the director, is married to Laura Esquivel.

4. Name your #1 television boyfriend and why he merits the rating of #1.

That's so hard.  Damn, Christine!  You ask hard questions!  Let's see.  My #1 boyfriend would be Jack Bristow.  There's nothing he won't do for his daughter and he kicks ASS!  And that's #1 in my book any day.

5. If you could live anywhere in the world, where would you choose?

Pemberley.  With Colin Firth.</lj-cut>

THE RULES:
1 - Leave a comment, saying you want to be interviewed.
2 - I will respond; I'll ask you five questions.
3 - You'll update your journal with my five questions, and your five answers.
4 - You'll include this explanation.
5 - You'll ask other people five questions when they want to be interviewed."

Watched a David Wenham movie (can't really to wrong with that), ate fabulous sushi, and went to Austin Diner.  Visited Waterloo Records, BookPeople, and drove around Lamar for awhile.  It was great.  Thought about going to Amy's, but we were full.

Last night, since I haven't been watching television at all lately, I had to finish up movies that I'd rented/Netflixed.  Rented Bend It Like Beckham, which was good.  Liked it.  Also rented Uptown Girls, which is quite possibly one of the WORST movies ever to grace my screen.  Ugh.  Just...ugh.  Strange how <lj user=""em_meredith""> and I watched the same movie this weekend and had the exact same reaction.

Also finished the last three Felicity DVDs (FINALLY!), and plan on returning them to Netflix today so that I can get my Sports Night DVDs.  Lord, I've been waiting for those far too long.

1. Why don't I look good in hats?  Is it because I have tons of hair?  Maybe I could straighten my already straight hair to pretend I'm Donna Moss in hats.

2. Why is it that every time I'm in a seafood restaraunt, I never feel like eating it?  I want chicken instead.

3. Why do I have so many highlighters?  Do I ever use one besides yellow?  Why the pink, green, and orange.

4. My pants are too big.

5. ""Angel"" by Sarah Mc always reminds me of the season one finale of DC.  Sigh.  Those were good times: ""Dawson Leery -- he loves you, Joey.""  Hee!

6. I think I have a hole in the toe of my stocking. And it's making me uncomfortable.

8. My fingers shrink in the winter.

9. Howard Shore won a GG!  Woohoo!

10. Sometimes, I just want a light in my closet.

11. If I bought a BMW as my next car, it'd probably be less in monthly notes than what I'm paying for now.  

12. When is my tax refund coming?

13. Is Charlie Young ever going to get a better storyline?

14. Why did Jennifer Garner decide to wear draperies to the Golden Globes?

15. Is dutch still iced in?

16. Has my eyeliner smeared off?

17. Why does this fax machine spit out blank paper?  Dammit!

18. I've listened to this CD way too many times.

19. Did I leave my red pen in the bathroom?

20. I need a haircut."

sry i have'nt updated this in awhile!

well we got bac from the cruise on thursday, 3 days early. my grandpa died the second day on the cruise. but everything will b fine, eventually. 

our first stop on the cruise was at Nassua, Bahamas. there i went snorkling, with sharks, ya thats right with sharks. then i went s.c.u.b.a. diving, which was a lot of fun once i popped my ears. it was so much fun that i might even get certified with john.

the next day was spent on the boat at sea, which was still awesome considering that they had so much there. but some advise is to make sure u kno if the pools on the boat are regular water, with chlorine, or if they r salt water. ours was salt water and once salt water gets up ur nose it stings 4 atleast 10 minutes! not fun!

after that we went to st. thomas in the u.s.v.i. there i went shipwreck snorkling and on a motorized scooter underwater with a air pocket 4 breathing. it was so much fun!

the next day we went to st. maartens in the dutch and french v.i. there we flew to puerto rico, i've got to say that st. maartens has the worst airport ever!!! u have no idea how bad it was. even the air plane was horrible. they had to move 4 people from the front of the plane to the back because it was unevenly wieghing. so our next stop was san juan puerto rico, there we swiched plane and headed for a 4 and a half hour plane ride to chicago. thank god this plane was nicer!!!

on the plane home i did get to see dirty dancing havana nights, which i got to say wasn't nearly as good as the original. 

so we got home, got paddy which if anyone who got bitten by him while we were gont, sry! and the next day we went to rockford to attend my grandpa's  memorial service and burial. and for once in the longest time all of my cousins from that side of the family was together! that was friday.

saturday we met with my uncle mark and his family for lunch at thier house. it is so funny to watch my cousin Mannie, he is goin into 1st grade and speaks both english and spanish.

and here i am to day trying to enjoy my last day of summer, according to my definition. cause tomorrow starts soccer at 9 a.m., and thats lasts everyday all week! then volleyball starts followed by school. my summer is done :(

it has been so long since i've written anything. its gettin close to vacation, we leave sturday the 7th. we take off sunday the 8th and dont come bac until the 15th! its so exciting, and 1 of the mayngreat aspects is the clothes! i didn't kno this (thats could b cause of my stupidity or the lack expeirience of cruises) but when u go on a cruise u have to get all these new clothes, all different types! i mean new swimsuits, new dresses, skirt, shirt, everything. so thats wut i've mostly been doin over the past 2 weeks, gettin new clothes. 

after the cruise its time for school, 8th grade here i come! and that means that mary leaves for college, as much as i'll miss her i get my own bathroom. well there really isn't much more to say about school so i'll skip to my birthday in september. which i already have a REASONABLE list of things that people can buy me.

to think that in about a year i will b driving, i'm so excited. even though i have already drove. ya thats rite mary john took me to the parkinglot in ur car, sry.

well i'm gonna go to do more shoppin.

Sorry i haven't written in awhile. well this weekend was well okay. if u read my other entries then u kno that i was in staunton (i found out how to spell!) omg all they do on saturday and friday night is hang out on the streets in town to drink and smoke. otherwise it was good and i got a tan.

while i was there i got 2 picture frames, 1 four pictures frame and 1 photo album. so today i filled the stuff with pictures, fun huh? well i know have a picture place in my room with all this stuff up. so anyone who wants to see me as a 5,4, or 3 year old should see these OLD pictures, they r hilareous (cant spell)!

so it wasn't a bad weekend, this week i have soccer camp. everything went well until the end, when i had ride my bike home without the cut through. now that is torture (cant spell!) so i'm workin hard all day long in the hot sun, well half a day anyway, and then i have to ride my bike up to my house, and i have to do it again tomorrow, HELP. okay so my scr crazy friends from last session said they were comin bac but guess wut, they didn't. o well, thats ok. so this time i have my old/new team mates. we were together on the team but this summer the team split up but there is an offer to combine with another team that split up, wish us luck! 

anyone who actually reads this knos that all i like to talk about is the cruise, well here i go again. i can't wait, we leve either the 7 or 8 of august, the boat leaves the 8. it is gonna b so much fun. someone asked me today ""wut if it sinks like the titanic?"" well r rooms r on the top floor so my answer to that is, we will b the first ones on those little safe boats, ha! but really i think we will b ok. anyway anyone who knos me knos that i love ice cream (mint!) they have a ben and jerrys on the boat, how awesome is that? ya really awesome! our room is kinda small but we get to go on the cruise thats all i need. so we r stopping at 3 different places. first one i'm not sure where it is, second is at st.thomas (virgin islands) the second is at st. martins (i think its the french virgin islands?) that place is half french and half dutch. i am so excited!

well thats enough for today ttyl

Okay so today i'm in a mix mood! Happy and excited yet i'm a little frustrated with, well everyone! sry dont mean to afend anyone

the downsides of the day!
well my hair was cut a little shorter than i wanted, but i guess it will never be perfect anyway. tomorrow i have an ortho appt. which my mom made. so for weeks i have been asking my mom wut time it is at and today she has the nerve to ask me when it is and gets upset with me when i dunno! (that is just really annoying!) 

the upsides of the day!
well i did get my hair done, thats always a pluse. i got to eat actuall food, not the stuff wee have at home. today is another day just closer and closer to stauntan, soccer, and the cruise! And best of all i dont have to do anything for the rest of the day. (and no one is goin to be here to tell me to do anything)

So i'm trying to figure this out, if the good things cancell out the bad i'm mostly left with a good day. not to shaby.

well i never really have anything to rite... whoever really takes time to read this doesn't have a life.

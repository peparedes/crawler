White Melburnians, of course! On the  walls are adverts for drummers, rooms for rent, poetry nights and  upcoming Dirty 3 shows. There are only two tables worth sitting at in  Lentil As Anything. There&rsquo;s the large bench out the back with pillows  and cushions, and then there&rsquo;s the table up the front with the world map  stuck to it. This gives Melbourne white people a chance to discuss the  countries they&rsquo;ve been too and the countries they want to go too, all of  which are either in Asia or South America.<br /><br />The food is all  vegetarian and you can <i>pay what you want</i> for your meal. The  owners have succeeded in creating a reasonably successful business using  an artful combination of trust and guilt.

Feels like so much has happened, seen so much. I know this is just the intensity of travel and new people and places but I love it.

In fact we've performed 2 shows and I've seen only 2 others. So much to see so little time. We've been well and truely adopted by our billet hosts, marched in the fringe parade, help set up the tent area and panicked about unexpected and weird tech issues. The sprinklers came on under the tent. The stage was built too small *by one metre on each side*. Our crocodile keeps deflating. But it's been great, it's been so great.

Yesterday my house went on a crazy cleaning binge. First time we've been together in over a month. We've had pantry moths and I had absolutely no idea of the scale of infestation. They were in unopened packages. They were inside supposedly airtight glass jars. They were in paprika. They were in chilli. What kind of animal can live in chilli?!?

Felt guilty as shit for not being there for more of it but I had work, I have work again today.

It didn't get much attention when it came out, which struck me as strange, as it was extremely graphic and those films often get a bit of hohah on release (saw, hostel, wolf creek, irrecoverable, reservoir dogs...).

 It was titled ""39"" and the plot involved this group of young people in a small town trying to cover up some awful crime, and by the end of it there's been (you guessed it) 39 murders as they kill witnesses and those who are getting suspicious, and then when they start getting paranoid they off one another until there is eventually only one person left.

Everyone was young and white and glamorous and very hollywood. The cinematography was fucking pornographic, the detail involved and all that fear and blood.

 They were supposedly killing to cover up this crime but really they were sadistic pricks and enjoyed it, torturing the victims to death in novel and perverse ways.

And as happens in dreams, it was a film, I was watching it, but I was in it too, the victims and the killers too, the camera person shooting overhead and the girl with the knife.

It went on for hours.

I woke up after like 9 people dead or something, reeling from all that blood and the horror of my own mind being the source of it all.

Man, I used to have nightmares like that all the time; should just be grateful they've eased off in terms of frequency."

"event","When I came home, my adorable housemate J was watching the l word. I collapsed onto the couch and she fed me and I watched three or four episodes with her while doing some beading.

It's abysmal! It's so bad! And not in a so-bad-it's-good way. It's just sad and sordid and all L.A. L.A. whackadoo! and just so far from anything I can relate to. Which is what I had always expected but god it was gruesome. Neat though to be able to watch it with someone equally critical and cynical.

And then to wipe my mind back to my own version of reality I listened to PANSY DIVISION. Argh! I love them! What have I been doing with my life that I only just discovered this band??? Joy!

Hmmm so yeah maybe I still feel lonely and all brokedown inside but I know it'll pass. I know nice people and food help me feel safe, help me feel loved. I've gotta not skip my drugs! I crashed into a road blockade thing today, like one of those metal signs with the black and yellow stripes. More embarrassed than hurt, but it was a reminder that sometimes I'm far more fucked up physiologically than I actually feel.

Anyway, anyway, I should go to sleep. The sooner I do, the sooner I'll wake up and be able to listen to more music."

"event","There are places in melbourne where one can go out for a meal alone and feel pretty inconspicuous. The Carlton on bourke st is not one of them. Or maybe it's just my state of mind.

Baby, I forgot to take my meds yesterday. I feel like fucking shit today, but is it the drugs (or lack of) or is it just, you know, within the normal range of human emotion? I don't know, man, I don't know.

So, I went on a big adventure quest to drop off a copy of The Apricot Brandy for submission to MIAF. I wanted to freaking stay in bed and just not move but I figured it'd shit my dad and sister if I missed to deadline for no reason. I just think about it and cringe. Even if I can see logically that it has some flaws but isn't totally awful, I just get so worried about what people will think. Anyway it's handed over now, so hey whatever.

And then I went and bought a lot of things. All things I guess I've been thinking about but woah did I drop a lot of money in one day. Because I was in the docklands, I went to the dfo at spencer st. I bought a second pair of birkenstock footprints boots, but these ones are almost conventionally stylish, black with laces, fucking beautiful. 

I went out to prarahn to get a pair in the right size, so while I was out there I went to a button/bead shop. Bought a bunch of frosted glass seed beads and some fake pandoras. One of the staff members was at IKEA yesterday, when the eftpos was down for the ENTIRE DAY and they were making announcements warning of the queue taking over an hour to get through. It was pretty amazing. Full serve was an absolute riot, we were cacking ourselves. Anyway it was nice to meet someone who, as a customer, had a sense of humour about the experience. 

And I went to a jewelery supply place in the cbd and bought another diamond drill bit for *$32*. Woah. I dunno, they are so, so expensive but the woman working there said that the dentists come to them; there's not some magic way of buying them cheap. I just need to try to be more careful not to snap it I spose.

And I went to missing link and bought a cd by pansy division, and went to jb and got some music by the mighty mighty bosstones. So they're kind of on the argh max list, but I dunno, I tell myself to get over it becuase I was into them before I met her even if I hadn't heard particular songs.

Wow, why am I typing all this when I could be writing emails?"

"event","so, i went to jcar. first time for everything, eh.<br /><br />i stared at the kits a bit. i asked some inane questions. i concluded that to make a set of lights where each light is, like, individually controllable would be too hard. Stupid hard. Like learning to use a processor to control stuff means learning program as well as learning to put it all together. <br /><br />It would, however, be relatively straightforward to make a circuit of lights, with a battery pack and an on/off switch, and sew em into a suit. And simple flash patterns can be done with components without needing a programmed processor. So maybe I&nbsp;should just do that. YEAH.<br /><br />Huh. This is pretty much what I&nbsp;mean.<br /><lj-embed id=""15""/><br /><br /><img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4024/4216227851_83ed168764.jpg"" style=""width: 143px; height: 190px;"" alt="""" /><br /><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicoleaprilbarron/4216227851/"">www.flickr.com/photos/nicoleaprilbarron/4216227851/</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/macetech/3483946654/in/set-72157617579461619/"">www.flickr.com/photos/macetech/3483946654/in/set-72157617579461619/</a><br />"

I&nbsp;think it's ambitious but not beyond me. Possibly prohibitively expensive but we shall see.<br /><br />AND&nbsp;AND&nbsp;AND&nbsp;what I&nbsp;mean is I&nbsp;wanna be able to program it, like say which lights should turn on when, like preprogram a few patterns. Or maybe it's even possible to write software that like makes self generating patterns?&nbsp;Whoah. So yeah complex stuff, not just like strings of blinking christmas lights up each limb.<br /><br />See, we did super duper ultra basic electronic circuits in high school, but I don't really remember it. I&nbsp;DO&nbsp;remember that I&nbsp;understood what we we doing and talking about. I&nbsp;remember that very clearly. Okay, okay so.<br /><br />Okay okay so I&nbsp;can get my head around how an LED&nbsp;works, basically. Electrons come out the battery, go through led diode and drop state, releasing light. Okay. Electrons go in one side and come out the other, okay. To have energy run through a circuit it needs to be a closed loop. A&nbsp;switch is just a spot to open and close the circuit. The components can be in series or parallel....Series = voltage is dispersed (equally) between the components,            meaning less voltage goes to each. Parallel = each component gets the same voltage, means more power is used overall (like battery drains faster). A&nbsp;resistor retards the voltage so only x amount gets through. okay. LEDs need DC&nbsp;power because they only go one way. Orright.<br /><br />And that is about as far as I&nbsp;can go without a text book, I&nbsp;think.<br /><br />So that tutorial is pretty good. It's all like, get your fabric and sew in thread, fix the LEDs in, attach the battery and the switch, all very detailed with pictures. And then just at the end she says, all simple and easy in one sentence or so, now whack in your code, here's mine if you want it. I'm like, WHAT&nbsp;DO&nbsp;YOU&nbsp;MEAN?!? The thing has no keyboard!!! HOW DO&nbsp;I&nbsp;IMPUT&nbsp;TEXT&nbsp;INTO&nbsp;A&nbsp;PHYSICAL&nbsp;OBJECT???&nbsp;DOES&nbsp;IT&nbsp;HAVE&nbsp;<strong>FUCKING&nbsp;BLUETOOTH?</strong>??<br /><br />Anyway, I&nbsp;know it all makes sense, I&nbsp;just have to get it into my own head. Just seems baffling from the outside. I&nbsp;still cannot conceptualise how complex behaviour can come out of the whole binary on/off thing. Like, I get it comes out of multipling it out...like a tree that branches out but can't conceptualise the sheer numbers needed. Gah can't explain it I&nbsp;know what I&nbsp;mean.<br /><br />Okay I'm starting to feel unwell from being awake too much, I&nbsp;should try to go back to sleep eh."

"event","I dreamed I was the leader in a kingdom made up of green hills and lush forests, gold sand and the ocean like sapphire. My people were farming people. We raised animals, told stories, painted our houses bright colours, had festivals.

 We were under attack, and I was trying to lead the armies against the invaders.

I was a bit shit at it.

I kept losing my magic horn. Eventually I made a tool belt to go over my robe/suit thingy so I could carry it around with me.

Again and again we rode out against them, on horses and on dragons, and I loved my people and I fought as best as I could, but I was young and a lousy king. My parents had died and I was in it too early, too ignorant.

 I remember the feeling of releasing an arrow while flying past a target, I remember the feeling of my sword connecting with bone. I remember the wooden box with magic rings, a gift from a healer friend who could not fight. I remember the wind past my ears and the feeling of my dragon under me, that absolute trust. I remember the feeling of looking at the map of the kingdom, with the fallen towns at the north eastern edge. So many people, so many lives.

I woke shouting and crying, desperately fighting for everything I loved, trying and failing to protect my people.

First time I've dreamed of flying in a long time. Certainly the first time I've dreamed about riding a dragon since getting to know max. Strange that my mind could go back to that earlier time."

"event","I think I might be a bit manic. Despite being on the brain drugs. It's been about a week I've felt like this and I only just worked it out. Feeling like I can do anything, feeling super talkative and friendly, feeling unafraid, feeling like I have to shout and sing and MOVE or I will explode violently like a light bulb. The sleeping 3-6 hours a night, instead of 8 or 9. Fascination with visual details and colours, everything sharp and brilliant and glittering. Glass and light. Crash-collide of creative ideas like white machine gun fire. Spray.

Totally...lit. 

Feels like this is my REAL personality and how I feel and think and behave the rest of the time is a watered down or broken version of me.

And that edge, that feeling that things are one snapped second from spinning out of control.

That unexplainable difference between being in a normal human good mood and being totally, absolutely, ludicrously, fucking high. 

So now what? Feel like I should be somehow storing up food reserves for the coming winter, but it does not work that way. All I wanna do is fuck and dance, and if the first is totally out of the question, it's time to go do the latter."

"event","I took some of them out of Trey's drawer. Dad didn't even know he did that. I remember how Dad held them and lit them. 

I know how to do it."

"event","Dad brought home this paper bag and left it on the kitchen table. I peeked and saw bright colors first. I thought it was candy or toys, but then I saw the rockets. My stomach started jumping all around. 

Dad came back in the room and said, ""Ryan, get away from those. They're not for kids.""

I took my hands away, but he wasn't mad. He was smiling. 

""Your mom won those in a poker game,"" he said. ""What do you think of that, huh? Pretty cool?""

""Yeah,"" I said. ""Can we set them off tonight?""

""If you kids behave yourselves,"" he said. ""And hands off. Tell your brother, too."" 

Mom just brought home hot dogs from the corner store and there's a watermelon in the fridge. I can't wait til it gets dark. Trey's excited, too, even if he won't say so. I'm going to be good all day."

"event","Trey hit me, but then he felt bad. 

He invited some of his friends over and we all ate some more brownies. I got the biggest one. It smelled funny, but I ate it all. Trey's friend Trixie was there. She said she was named after a horse. 

What horse, I said.

In some book, she said. 

Shut up, Trey said. 

What horse, I said. Just tell me. 

Trey and Trixie started kissing, and they wouldn't tell me what horse. 

What horse, I said. What horse what horse what horse. What book.

Then Trey hit me again. I couldn't sleep all that night. I couldn't stop thinking about that horse. Trixie never told me."

"event","Trey brought home some brownies in a baggie. He said they were special brownies and I couldn't eat any. I thought maybe he got them from a girl and that was why they were special. 

But Mom and Dad ate all the macaroni and cheese before I got home from Trevor's, and Mom wouldn't make me anything else cause I was late. I was hungry, so I went in Trey's room and I took one brownie. Just half a one, but I ate it all. 

Then I watched cartoons and I couldn't stop laughing, even though Dad said I was acting like a fool. He told me to shut up, and I put my head down on the carpet and laughed without making any sound, and there were tears running down my face.

Trey's going to beat my ass, I bet."

"event","Travis, he lives next door to me, he got a new bike today for his birthday. He says it's brand new and his mom spent $100 on it, but the seat's cracked and there are a lot of scratches on the handlebars, so I don't really believe him. He let us ride it, though, and I was the first one to make the jump off Mike Healy's front porch without falling.

Travis got kind of mad then and took his bike home, so we just sat on the curb in front of Mike Healy's house and shared a Coke. Nicky said he'd steal some cigarettes from his dad and we'd all practice smoking, but I think he's too scared to take anything from his dad -- I would be -- and anyway, I already know how to smoke, mostly. Trey says I don't, because I don't really inhale, but Trey doesn't know everything.

It was still pretty light outside when Mike Healy's mom made him come in for dinner, and I didn't think Mom would be awake yet, so I walked down to T&J Liquor and bought a bag of Cheetos and another Coke, because I was pretty hungry and Travis's mom had let me keep the $5 I was supposed to give Travis for his birthday. It was a dumb gift, but I think Travis was pissed that his mom made him give the money back. I would've been pissed.

Mom was still asleep when I finally got home, even though it was already dark outside again, and not even very hot anymore. But I turned the fan on in her room anyway, and I put a fresh glass of water next to her bed. I hope she remembered to set her alarm, because she's got work tomorrow and Mrs. Henricks, said she'd tell the principal if I was late for school again.

I'm glad Trey doesn't make fun of me anymore when I can't sleep because Dad's not home."

"event","We've been out of milk for almost a week now. 

Before school, I told Mom that I wanted cereal, but she wouldn't get out of bed. She didn't even open her eyes. Trey was in the doorway watching me, and he said, ""Don't be such a baby, Ry.""

I said, ""I'm not a baby.""

""Cereal tastes better without milk anyhow,"" Trey said. He tossed a handful of Fruit Loops in his mouth. ""See? It doesn't get soggy that way."" 

The school nurse told our class that milk has calcium, and we need calcium to grow. 

""Strong bones,"" she said. ""Muscles."" 

But I knew Trey would laugh at me if I told him that, so I just ate my cereal dry. It stuck in my throat going down. 

I'm afraid I'm never going to grow."

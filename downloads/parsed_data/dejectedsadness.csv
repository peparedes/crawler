"event","I haven't wrote in here for ages, for a moment I forgot that I even owned this journal. My summer has been filled with many people and events, and school is waiting for me. I don't want school to come back, and take over my life. As much as I like it, I loathe it as well. 

I haven't seen any of my friends in ages, I'm always at my cottage. I love you all!<3

Anyways, today is a boring day, I've been listening to music, and I'm waiting for my cousin to arrive. I'm so bored that at the moment I'm watching Judge Judy! This show makes me laugh, people really strive for attention. I should be going to La Ronde tomorrow:) 

Thank God I'm not working this week end. I'm fed up of my job, and it is probably my last year working at the horse ranch. I love horses, but it isn't very payful.

That's all for now.

"event","Somebody told me something that hurt me so bad, and now I wish to die. My friends are talking behind my back, and from what I can see, my life is going nowhere.

I'd like to take the time, to thank my friend Amanda. I don't know what I'd do without her, she's my definition of a true friend. If only the world were like her.
God made us meet on purpose. This week, it seems like tears have become my new friend. 

One day, maybe just one day I'll have eternal happiness, but until that day I must stay strong."

I'm so happy, I'm finally going up north, I'm going to see my friends, and I'll work tomorrow. Finally my boredom will be over for some time. I should be back Monday, maybe I'll only write on Tuesday. I'll see, I just hope you won't miss me too much. ^_^

I made 4 new Cd's today, with some Atreyu, Alexisonfire, Armor For Sleep, and Silverstein. I'll have music for the weekend. Oh boy, The Beastie Boys are on television, they're still around? Ah well, I haven't heard about them in a while.

I guess that's all for now, if I don't come back to write, I wish you all a lovely week-end.

"event","I'm in a good mood, for the first time I ever posted in this journal.

I made supper for my parents today, and cooking got me in a good mood. After that I spoke with my friends from up north. Another reason I'm in a good mood, is because I got a new layout. I'd like to thank Marika, for her time and devotion to-wards my layout. Her user name is xdollyx, if you want to check her journal out.

I finished jogging not long ago, I ran 4.30 miles, and I burnt 503 calories in half an hour. I feel good now, and my melancholy just drifted away.

I guess that's all I have to say for now, I might be back later.

Have A Nice Evening!

"event","My boredom has got me to cry.

I can't take this anymore, everything inside of me is collapsing. It feels like I have no friends, and that I'm so lonely. I feel unwanted, and not needed. 

Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to be dead, and how people would react: they probably wouldn't care. Suicide may be the answer, but I'm too scared to do it. I may seem like a happy going person, but I'm not. My family loves me, but yet I still suffer. I have many material items, that most kids don't have, but I'm still not happy.

The computer has becomed my best friend. Enough about my problems.

Bye Bye

"event","I was alone most of the day.

I like to be alone, it allows me to think, without worrying about the people around me. Most of the time I just sat at my computer on reflected on many things. 

I'm listening to music, and for some reason it's giving me a strange feeling inside, and it makes me think of some random people. I get this a lot when I listen to music. I think I'm in love, with a person that doesn't live in the same city as me. I know I shouldn't even try, because it's totally useless if we don't live in the same place. Anyways I hardly know him, so I won't continue thinking about him, and I guess I'll give up on him. Let's just hope I won't see him again, or else I'll really fall in love with him. *sigh*

My day was boring, despite the fact that I went swimming in my pool. I hate it in montreal, it's ALWAYS boring, I like better going up north. Everyone is so different, they all have a different life style, and I find that less selfish. (NO OFFENSE) 

Anyways that's all for now.

"event","I'm back, once again. I haven't done much since my last entry. I'm still sitting here; my hair is tieed back, I have no make-up on, and I'm wearing a t-shirt and shorts. 

At the moment I'm confused, and depressed. I often mix these two emotions together. My depression is cause by many different reasons. Most of the time I cry myself to sleep, wishing I would die. Everything was going so smoothyly for me, and then I hit a bump, and I fucked up so bad. I don't know who my real friends are anymore, and I don't know who to trust. I don't know where my life is going, but I'm sure most people don't know where their lives are going. While I was talking to one of my friends he said something that caught my attention: ""but, when things go badly, it makes you appreciate them more when they go smoothly..."" 

I guess I shouldn't worry about things so much, but I can't help it. I'm a stressed out freak.

"event","I'll try to update this the most I can, but I have quite the busy life, so it may be impossible. 

The day just started and I'm already bored. Sometimes I think there is no pint to live, since boredom shall be one of the only things I'll face in my life. So here I am, sitting at my computer, writing in my journal, my music is blasting in the background, and my parents aren't home. I don't know why I even started this journal, I'm bot the type of person that keeps a journal, but right now I think I have to let my mind go free. All my problems are captured into my brain, and it's slowly killing me. From now on I'll share my life with thousands, and thousands of people. I have a feeling that today is going to be long and boring, but in my life most days are long and boring. Lately of thought a lot about where my life is going, and I can't seem to figure it out. Where will everyone go when they grow up, what will my friends become? The human existence is quite a puzzling thing to unravel.

That's all for now, I'll probably be back later

"event","hellos peoples...not much to say at the moment, but currently not wanting to work or study so here I am looking at journals and thinking...ah...might as well write in mine.  So....what's up?  hmm...it's March...already...darn...this semester is going to go by so fast!  what am i going to do?  ::sniff:: i'll miss berkeley...and all the darn people I know that have decided to stay up here instead of going down south!!  haha...no worries tho...i might not even go down south either...well...within the next few years maybe not.  but it's scary, you know?  the future...even if you do know what you want to do...to be able to take that next step and put youself there.  it's intimidating...haha...i guess that's the thing about me...people are intimidating...they all seem to have done so much more and do so much better...everyone seems so much more capable.  but let the future come when it comes i guess...right now i want to enjoy life as it is.  my immediate future is being decided...haha...not much I can do about it now...and all i really want to do is plan my immediate future...what i'm gonna be doing 5 years from now....hey...it's the same thing everyone else will probably be doing...working...be it in a job they love and care about or a job they hate...or maybe in a job that they don't really care either way.  The next 3-5 years are mine...and i hope to make the best of it.  what i'll ultimately decide to do?  well...only time will tell.  I guess that's what everyone's doing right now...trying to find out who they will be...trying to prepare themselves into what they will be...never entirely sure what the ultimate outcome will be. 

anyways...on a brighter note i guess...i'm going to NY!!  haha...i finally found someone who wants to go there with me...(so sad...none of my friends like me...hehe..).  so it's tentatively planned for this summer...i'm excitied =)  she's a really good friend and it'll be fun to be able to spend more time with her...haha...i don't see her very often, but it's so great that we still talk you know?  She calls me up during breaks and we talk over e-mail and stuff...haha...it's so nice to know you're appreciated when a friend calls you up and ask you to do stuff ;)   hmm...i need more friends like that...hehe...

but yea...all i need now is to find someone to come with me to Europe and my life will be complete!  haha...yea, my friend is going with someone else to europe, so i'm stuck (hehe...doubt she'd want to go twice in a year).  hmm...it's more fun when it's with friends...haha...and i mean girls...i actually do want to spend time with my friends that are girls.  or...maybe a large group...that could be mixed...haha...=)  but yea...::sigh::  that doesn't really look like it's gonna happen anytime soon.  if anyone wants to tho...i'm game! =)  just ask!!  hehe...

oooh...and spring break is coming up.  what's planned?  nothing!  grr...no one wants to do anything either.  haha...people suddenly have something else to do.  eh...i do have an interview during break tho...so i guess i could prepare for that...i guess...haha.  sadly...if i want to do something...it's always up to me to try and plan it...for once, it'd be nice to just be invited to something that someone else plans.  eh...maybe i'll think of something to do...we shall see..

all right...that's it...enough procrastinating on here.  I should study...or at least look like i'm studying...hehe.  Two more midterms next week...and i would prefer not to fail them...so hence the mad studying.  all righty...to anyone who actually reads this...take care and good luck!"

Now, for the Top 10 List. You might be a Haas senior if...
10) You have been called a Haastitute
9) You fell victim to BA10's reverse curve
8) ""Preselected"" gives you butterflies in your stomach
7) You felt a bit guilty when they installed the plasma TV in BofA in the midst of budget cuts
6) You can recollect the now defunct consumption functions
5) You suffered through every semester of Friday discussions
4) You have a separate folder in your email for Dara Ziegelmeier and Barbara Felkins
3) You never understood why accounts were called ""fee none"" rather than ""no fee""
2) You have intermittent nightmares of resume and cover letter writing
1) You realized the ingenuity of the name ""FIFO Cafe"" after taking 102A

hehe...the ""preselected"" thing is pretty accurate...as is the Dara and Barbara separate folders ('cept mine is ""careermail"" and ""haas"")...hehe...and the friday discussions...oh how i have hated those friday discussions.  grr...everyone around me has 3 day weekends...except for us people taking BA classes.  darn.  hehe...anyways...just thought that was funny. 

what's up with me?  hmm...well, not much is going on now.  my classes this semester are okay...not great...haha...but i like my audit and tax class...my OB class...eh.  my team for that class is not very good...wish i could change...i mean...what kind of professor makes the composition of a gorup be 4 GUYS and 1 girl!!  i mean...what the heck...and the guys, well, they're not very serious about the project either...but being that there's 4 of them...not much i can say...darn minority opinion. 

anyways...other than that.  not doing much else.  some happy news...some not so happy...so it all evens out so far.  hehe...we'll see what happens.  oh yea...found a new roommate...after much searching and disappointment...haha...she's nice...i guess.  she just moved in yesterday...and i haven't seen her since, but ish okay...i'm used to having the entire apt now, but now i have to be careful not to take up too much space...haha...should have seen me trying to clean out the fridge.   I'll say more later i guess...i just wanted to put up that list...haha...cuz it's funny...and sadly...true =P  take care people!"

"event","hehe...so long time no updates huh?  A whole semester has gone by without a trace of me :)  Yea...stupid classes are really busy and stuff's been going on lately.  Not many people know what's been going on with my life, but that's ok, I don't feel like explaining it to everyone...hopefully all goes well though...winter break is a much needed respite from it all.  

Anyways, what have i been up to?  not much, sad to say.  Last day of finals today and I took my last final.  Going to go home!!  yay!!  I want my month of vacation already :)  

Classes this semester have been all right.  Finance is stupid and econ is boring, but, hehe, not much I can do about it.  Was really tired of studying for finals.  worried about those two classes, but can't do much about that now.  Accounting has been fun, gotta love the tests...hehe...and marketing...met cool people to work on my projects with.  ::sigh:: kinda sad, i find that i miss writing...you know, essays and stuff.  Haven't done much of that this semester.  I had that competitive strategy report and all those marketing briefs, but that's not really much compared to ""real"" essays where you have to research and write.  hehe...does that make me a nerd? :)  Other than that tho, classes have been cool.  Business classes are not that bad...my favorites so far?  hmm...accounting and marketing were interesting...finance is stupid :)  so no job as an I-banker for me in the future...hehe, it's okay, couldn't handle the stress of that job anyways.  but yea, please dont' ask what i'm going to do with my life just yet...i really don't know...options are forming, but nothing really concrete just yet...i'm setting a path, but i'm not sure what will come of it...we shall see...

hmm...well this year, unfortunately, my birthday had to fall on the same day as 2 of my finals.  hehe...although for theo i think it was 3 finals.  so, couldn't do much to celebrate and everyone else was busy with finals too.  so, my b-day wasn't that grand...but special all the same, cuz, hehe, it's my birthday...and theo's as well! ^_^

okay, i think this is all i'm gonna write for today...mayhaps i'll come back to write later on this break or next semester.  I'll see you all later...have a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!"

so i haven't updated in the longest longest time...but...ah well...ish all okay.  i don't hear anyone complaining just yet ;)  anyways, yay!! finally done with summer school and my internship.  it has been one heck of a summer these past 2 months.  craziness.  let's see if i pass tho...:/  hehe...anyways, yea summer school has been very tedious, yet can't help but say there were some good parts to it.  i found out that my professor lives in the apartment complex next door to me.  wow...he's kinda intimidating...he's the kind of professor that likes to make fun of people and is really cynical.  so yea...but he's a nice person once you get to know him i hear.  I also got to meet more people...and you know me with meeting more people...hehe...it's hard to do.  i can't say that i've made lasting friendships, but I have gotten to know more people in Haas, which is good.  wrote more papers than i would have liked during this summer.  also got some practice in with my resume and cover letter...haha...now all i need is experience.  also did a presentation...wasn't too bad once it was over...hehe...gotta get over this stage fright thing.  oddly enough tho, people were saying that I was really calm when I was speaking...very strange...i was sooooo scared and nervous.  hmm...anyways, work was fun.  honestly, kinda boring, but i did learn alot about computer applications and such.  I'm kinda glad i'm not cs, but i still think it's good to know all this stuff.  at least i can say i have learned it and know it.  cuz i'm really not sure what i want to do in business, but at least i can say i've had experience with a tech firm.  dunno, still thinking about bio...hmm...wonder how to get an internship with a bio firm...hmm...say hospital anyone?  haha...anyways, it was fun and i got to meet more people there too...hehe...this summer was also one of meeting many people.  hopefully we keep in touch and stuff...we have each other's aim and e-mail.  

ok...yea..me at home right now...lovely HOT SoCal...even Irvine is stinking hot.  learning to appreciate the cooler norcal weather...:)  but its good to be home and finally be able to sleep in and stuff.  been waking up at 7 every day this past summer...not fun let me tell you.  its good to relax, even though we aren't doing much.  we went to the getty center yesterday...hehe...it's really pretty...nice artwork and architecture.  

hmm...anyways, not much else to talk about...so i'll leave it at that and continue later...must go find some respite from this heat ;)!!~~!"

There will be many times in life when you lose yourself... your past. Your dreams. Your purpose. The reason why you live. 

And then there will be just as many times that will remind you of those things, and restore within you the faith to continue to tomorrow, as a better person than who you were before. 

Faith is like the wind. You don't see it, but you feel it. And there are times, many of which happen in my darkest moments, when I feel like the greatest dream and purpose in my life is to love, wholeheartedly and unconditionally.

life is a series of choices...don't look back at all the bad choices you made but look forward to the good ones you have yet to make...

we all have regrets...but you have to make the best of it instead of dwelling on the regret...look to the future, not the past...

no matter what it is important to be there for those you care about...keep trying...keep talking...don't give up hope

<b>Hallo...okay so not much to update lately.  guess I'll go back to last thursday i think...the trip to UCLA was fun :)  the only downside was that i had a sore throat that only got worse as the day progressed (hehe...all that fried food probably didn't help either).  well...we went to in-n-out...yummy food...and drove to UCLA...which took lik 1.5 hours...and then parked near wendy's apartment (near shirly's new apartment too!!) then went off to find shirly.  her dorm is actually pretty nice :)  well...i expected it to be...smaller than i thought...but pretty nice...very new and clean :)  i want those swipe cards!!!  darn berkeley and it's keys...hehe...:)  PLUS...they have AIR CONDITIONING!!!  i want air conditioning!  hehe...:)  anyways, shirly and I went to the farmer's market while edward and jeff went around campus.  shirly and I caught up a lot...hehe...lots of fun :)  lots of talking...and sampling fruit!!  oooh...the strawberries!!  suprising how much shirly knows about me tho...hehe...we know each other well...even though we don't see each other much anymore.  but yea...most of our time was spent talking and catching up on people and events.  then we all met up again...and edward and I went to go meet up with wendy.  we went to this chicken and waffles place (Roscoe's) and ate their famous fried chicken and waffles...kinda got lost and was kinda late to the cd release thing...but it was all good.  the food was good and the cd release thing was fun...hehe...my eardrums will never me the same...but it was fun...we got free drinks too...and vip passes!!  hehe...interesting bad...very interesting music :)  then we went to wendy's place and hung around for a while just talking and stuff.  then we went back...got home a little before 12...hehe...long day...but fun.

friday...i took my brother to go see finding nemo with edward, alicia, jon, faye, and jennifer...and i think alicia's sister came too...but she left right after.  omg...sooooo soooo sooo much traffic on the way there...i'm never coming to walnut again during rush hour!!!!!  took me like 1.5 hours to get there...we were almost late for the movie!!  hehe...anyways, the movie was fun...really cute and funny.  a must-see and a must-get movie to watch over and over again :)  we went to costco to get pizza for dinner and then i left to get my brother home and i was tired.  

then it's been this past week.  been mainly driving my brother back from school and taking care of him in the afternoons.  been shopping a lot too...hehe...i have a list of things i need to buy and i'm looking for cheap, yet stylish things to buy :)  hehe...i bought a shirt, a dress, and 2 pants...hehe...trying to find stuff to wear to work...hehe...no jeans and t-shirt :)  oh yea...and watching tv and reading lots of books :)  yea...relaxing life.  hehe...been also learning html from this tutorial thing...html is pretty easy...just gotta remember the terminology.  hehe...like i told lisa...still like scheme better...haha...darn it...she called me a nerd for saying that!!  haha...but...i DO like scheme better...so much cleaner!!  and neater!!  hehe...although it's not graphic based like html...so it's easier to see your results with html and it's a lot more flexible with mistakes.  hehe...but scheme is nicer :)  haha...if that makes me a nerd...ah...so be it...:) me no computer programmer, so doesn't matter much =P

i think that's it for updates for now...more updates laters...have a nice summer and good luck on finals!! </b>

anyways, yea back in Irvine for a few weeks...then back to berkeley to begin my internship (haha...gotta learn those html skills before i go)...and summer school...oh joy...business communications and some society class...eh...BA classes...hope they aren't that hard.  gotta work...hehe...it's nice to think that you're actually making money...makes me feel better financially cuz i know my parents will pay for stuff...but this'll help them out by not having to pay as much (although with the current student fees at berkeley, my wages won't be that much in comparison)

so what have i been doing?  this past weekend...massive moving into my new apartment.  gotta say my room looks nice...well, not nice as in pretty nice but nice as in it's roomy and clean.  hope this next year will be good in the apartment.  melinda is nice and hopefully she'll be a good roommate :)  lots of money spending tho...oiy...just thinking about it...hehe...all this furniture and supplies...really add up.  

hmm...since i've been home i went to see the dentist...he told me my wisdom teeth didn't need to be pulled out just yet...so that's good.  i got my new phone...sony-ericsson!!  hehe...color screen...but no camera :(  and i saw edward that day too...fun at the mall playing mad libs and having orange julius (i haven't had that in soooo long!!!) today i spend like a couple hours in the library reading books...very relaxing...me gonna do that more often these next few weeks...books are the greatest :)  tomorrow i'm gonna go to UCLA!!  hehe...gonna see shirly!!!  gonna see wendy!!  hehe...it's nice to have such friends.  we've known each other for sooo long...and we still keep in touch :)  hehe...wendy and i had a cheezy moment a while back when we both promised that we'd ""always keep in touch"" (even when she's rich and famous and i'll have to borrow money from her ;P)  anyways, yea...looking forward to seeing them...edward's gonna come too cuz wendy wants to meet him.  we're gonna eat chicken and waffles...hehe...wendy's suggestion...we're gonna be brave and eat it too even though waffles aren't my favorite dish.  shirly wants to see farmer's market...hehe...berkeley has that and i've never been to it.  maybe if i see the one in ucla it'll give me more incentive to see the one in berkeley =P  

hmm..oh yea...friday gonna go see Finding Nemo!!  taking my brother with me to see it with peeps from walnut.  i have high hopes for that movie...better not disappoint.  toy story and monster's inc were good so far...so hopefully this will too :)  

i think that's it for updates today...me kinda tired...don't know what else to say...good luck to everyone out there.  i'll shall updates more laters..."

"event","hello...so it's been ever so long since i last updated...mucho stuff to updates on.  not really sure where to start.  well...we shall start with my concerns beginning spring break.  so yea...i had my econ midterm to study for...didn't turn out that bad i guess...still haven't gotten the result back...but i can't say it went great.  ::sigh:: should i really be an econ major?  anyways, yea...i got accepted into HAAS :)  hehe...so after much deliberation, i decided to do a simultaneous major with Haas and Econ...and yes...i do know that it's practically the same thing...but hey, it's two degrees for doing the same thing...hehe...seems worth it...all i have to do is take one extra class for one semester than i would have.  I like both majors and want to explore both :)  housing...yes...the search was on once spring break ended.  I actually met this girl...Melinda...who had found an apartment and wanted a roomate...so I went over to see the place...it was nice...kinda...hehe...but yea...the place was taken once spring break was over so it was like we couldn't take it.  so i asked her if she was interested in looking with me for an apartment since we were both looking for one.  so yea...my new roomate now :)  I got to know cal rentals and craigslist very well...but i found some places that we could look at during the weekend.  we ended up only looking at two apartments on friday (three if you count the studio we looked at).  but the one we saw on oxford...really nice and we were thinking about getting it.  kinda far...but near edward ;)  hehe...so yea it was really really nice compared to the other apartments i've seen.  carpet...nice kitchen...dining room...one room...big livingroom.  seemed really nice.  so yea...the lady there liked us and we told her the next day that we were interested in it.  someone had already taken the other apartment in that complex so we like had to act fast...so before we knew it...we were signing the lease for the apartment.  crazy...so fast...but yea...i have an apartment!!! i'm not homeless!! hehe...:)  craze thing was that melinda turns out to be the girlfriend of the roomate of two of my old hall-mates last year who live in the suite in unit 1.  apparently july knows this guy too...as does charlotte.  strange coincidence huh?  hehe...yea...so...only dillema now is whether or not to take the room.  I think i will take the room...and she takes the living room...but...the living room has a lot more space than the room...but the room is more private...dunno...thinking...do you have any opinions?  

so yea...been studying for my cog sci midterm tomorrow...must study right now too.  it's been busy.  oh yea...i also got an internship for the summer!! hehe...so yea...i shall be in berkeley for the summer (summer school too).  much has been going on...that's the updates so far...probably have more that i don't remember right now...but must go study...to ttfn!!  more updates laters."

"event","hmm...well since it is spring break i guess i shall update once.  let's update now, shall we?  hmm...hehe...saturday...came home around 4.  went to eat chinese breakfast that morning...then went to airport.  We finally got and A bording pass!!  hehe...and we had dinner at sam woo with edward's parents..interesting...but it was nice...lobster was yummy :P  Sunday...hmm...didn't do much...did some grocery shopping with my parents...target...costco...hehe...relaxing.  we went to a seafood restraunt for dinner...yummy fish...hehe...:)  Monday...did my econ problem set.  spent like the whole afternoon on it.  i fried some dumplings and made cinnamon rolls for lunch.  yummy.  Tuesday...wendy was supposed to come over...but she wasn't feeling well so she came on wednesday.  I tried to read my poly sci...not really productive, but yea...watched kate and leopold...nice movie...not as bad as i thought it would be.  hehe...she got to be a duchess!!!  if only we could all be so lucky.  hmm...wednesday...wendy came over...and we went to Irvine Spectrum to see Chicago and go shopping.  we spent like 1 hour in robinsons-may looking at their earrings and trying to convince ourselves to buy one.  the salesguy was like there watching us look and reason with ourselves about buying it.  so wendy decided to buy hers and i was still thinking.  so the guy's like...come on...you spent all this time here you might as well get something.  so i was like...eh...wasn't sure...i was like...maybe if you could give like 50% off on those earrings...he's like...well maybe we can work something out.  i still wasnt' sure...but wendy pointed out the earrings that i wanted and he took them and gave me like 20% off on top off the official 25% off on the earrings.  hehe...was a pretty good deal...so i was like...if wendy can get the 20% off too...then i would buy mine too.  hehe...so yea...i haggled!! haha...can you believe it....well...kinda haggled...interesting experience.  so yea...that's been my week so far.  tomorrow edward's gonna come over.  i'm glad that i got to see some people this week...moving is kind hard...but it's good that i get to see them.  I had been hoping to see other people, but i can see them other times.  it was good to at least see wendy cuz i don't see her often.  anyways...that's all the updates so far...nothing else much has been happening.  gonna go back to berkeley on saturday.  have to finish my reading...oiy...so much reading...must finish....okie...back to my WB...then more reading.  okie...to all my lovely readers...be good and have a great rest of break!"

"event","what is the world to do?  what is the nation to do?  what are the people to do?  if you know me, i don't really like talking about politics.  I realized a while ago that i'm a bit of an idealist when it comes to things like domestic and foreign policy and politics is nothing about idealism but about reality.  We are a democracy, made for the people, by the people and we must live up to these ideals.  life is a fragile thing.  there is nothing more scary to me than the thought of war.  not just cuz i don't believe it is the right thing to do, but also because of the many lives it will affect.  our lives will be irrevocably changed.  i still want to be sheltered.  because i'm scared of what will happen...of dealing with the aftermath...of dealing with the war.  I took american history, i took european history, i'm taking poliical science...i know what war does.  I can't say that there are many instances in history where war solved the great problems of the world.  and yet...is that what we're trying to do?  many people can cite many differnet reasons of why Bush wants war...and these all may be true...but maybe it's just me, but i don't want to risk everything that is good right now to what?  rid the world of iraq?  there will always be terroriests...there will always be hidden nuclear weapons...war is something that is done to (at the very least) solve some sort of problem.  what does this war solve?  i'm not into politics that much...and i've tried my best to stay away from any kind of news about the war...but it eventually reaches me anyways.  so i guess i must take this time to reflect...and not ignore it...(as a good friend has said to do).  it's a scary thing, this war...very ominous for everything.  my econ professor has talked to us about this...and has said some very thought provoking things.  we are all affected by the war in one way or another...whether we like it or not...we are connected.  kinda strange to hear that in a poll 80% of the population feels that we should go to war...hehe...makes me feel really out of the world view here in berkeley.  we feel that everyone around us believes that we shouldn't have war...but the rest of the nation...out beyond the boundaries of our little world in berkeley...a large mass of the population believes in the war.  what in it do they believe?  there must be something that would make them want it.  i'm not sure what we can do here...we can hope and pray...maybe things'll look up...just maybe.  the world might change, our lives might change...but i hope that we and our beliefs do not...i still believe in the idealism that this country was founded upon...and i still have hope for it to shine through.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

hmm...okie...time for other misc. updates...let's see.  Apprently i got into the econ major (yay!!)...hehe...but yea...got rejected from a few other things.  but don't think about that...all of it was a learning experience...yes...and i'll do better next time.  although i think for one of them...this was my last time...i'll find something else to devote my time to i think...dunno...life's strange sometimes.  the things we hope for...turn out differently from what we expect...eh...such is life.  anyways...tired now...i have 2 midterms this week.  so...wish me luck...and good luck to everyone else with midterms/finals this week.  Have fun during spring break...remember to visit me!!! ;)  hehe...k...g'nites"

"event","hmmm...well...haven't updated in a while.  i tend to not write in here anymore...dunno why...just when i think i should, I have nothing to talk about and when i do...i'm too lazy to get up and log on or livejournal is down or something...always against me these people...hehe...:)

anyways...took my cog sci midterm this morning...we shall see how i did...probably will get my econ midterm back tomorrow...hmm...not sure how well i did on that one.  the cog sci wasn't too bad tho...some logic questions...which were fun actually...hehe...and different stuff.  cog sci is interesting i gotta admit...but for some reason it doesn't seem very concrete...like i'm not sure where it's going with it all...i guess it's too broad for me.  i'd rather have something that is more specific.  so therefore...i guess my final decision for a major is econ?  hehe...business maybe...if i get in...dunno...i still might think about bio...although i think i'd just take the pre-med requirements and not actually major in mcb if i do...cuz i don't think i could do it all in time.  

hmm...well...anyways...must get rid of my longstanding bitterness with this school...hehe...specifically against the financial aid offices and the board of regents...;)  well...i guess it's that i feel like they haven't offerered me much.  just cuz my family can probably afford to put me through college doesn't mean that i'm not in financial need...hehe...and yea...my one chance at their real scholarship (ie: regents) and i get alternate...to which i end up ultimately not getting.  and it's like i don't have anything to show for being alternate for regents cuz it's not like i can put that on my resume.  kinda sad that the one school that i choose to go to is the one school that chooses not to give me any kind of financial aid...even ucla was willing to give me something...berkeley...nothing...and we pay a lot for this school...for the services it gives us (not the education mind you...cuz education is like only like 1700) but the services...such as housing and dining...just really aren't worth the amount of money that we pay for it.  kinda makes me feel ripped off by the school.  hehe...anyways...that's my rant...there's more...but you probably don't want to hear me complain anymore...bitterness runs deep...so i tend not to think about it...cuz...i really do like the school...the education and student life that i get out of it is priceless...the decisions we make in life affect what our future will be.  I truely do love the relationships that i have made...although i can't say that i don't look to see what i might have missed had i made a different choice.  i'll say one thing tho...for the sake of those who do care to know...i don't regret going to berkeley or making the choices i did...where i am right now isn't a bad place to be.  I can't look upon the past and regret what i have done cuz it wouldn't be worth the what-if's and anxiety.  i made my choice and i live by it...although i have to say there will always be a slight bitterness against their financial policies...as there is something about my high school that i can't help but dislike...but such is life i guess.  put it behind me...yes i shall try...but constant reminders around me make me think about it even more.  maybe distancing myself from the cause and creating new situations would work...but it's scary...not something i'm used to doing...but perhaps i shall try.  here's looking to a new year next year where i shall try to create my place in this vast world.  

anyways...must sleep...it's late...i shall update more laters...hehe...poli sci paper still not done ;)  but working on it.  good luck to all of you on your finals or midterms...and take cares..."

"event","AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!! hehe...okie...just needed to get that out of my system.  stressfull schoolife is :) very.  hehe...anywyas, yea...lemme updates ya on my stress inducers these past few days/weeks.  so i lost my watch last week (yes...i know...how i can lose my watch i have no idea)...but it was gone from my wrist.  I just went from davis to tolman (on the bus) and back to davis in like 15 minutes...it was on my wrist when i went, but when i came back...poof...vanished!!  erg...i even traced back my steps all the way to tolman again and still didn't find it.  ai...so sad...i liked that watch.  it's from china :(  aww...hehe.  i guess i wanted to get a new one anyways...but it's like...a loss...you know?  i have control over deciding to buy a new one, but to just lose it...::sigh:: :)  so yea...i lost my watch (still hasn't been replaced by the way...so i walk around campus ignorant of the time).  then...we had this chinese new year (eve) potluck thing on friday...wow...lots of food.  i got the quarter in the dumpling (haha...supposed to give me money or good luck or something...haven't seen much of that lately tho).  we played pictionary and such...interesting experience.  the next day went to SF to the Palace of Fine Arts and the Exploratorium...wow...very very very very pretty!!!  such a nice day too!!  took like a gazillion pictures of the same thing.  so later...on the way back we took the BART.  and i had my BART pass going into the turnstyle thing...and then went down the escalators...and sat down.  only MINUTES later...i realize...i'm not holding my ID card wallet thingie that i had my BART pass in...and blah...i lost that too.  went all around the BART station and terrorized the lady at the counter and nothing turned up.  kinda sad eh?  i had deja vu of my watch all over again.  so yea...the monday after that i went to go get a new ID...and was ready to buy someone's AC transit (cuz no way i'm walking for the rest of the semester)...when...yay!!!  someone e-mailed me saying that they found it.  so yea...they mailed it back and now i have TWO ID cards!!! hehe...good ending to this sad story tho i guess.  

so yea...so lately i've been stressing over numerous things.  a few main things of which are housing (cuz i really don't know where i'm going to live...or who with...haha...and the search is on...kinda...sorta...not really...but thinking about it) and major applications.  so...i decided to apply for HAAS...yea..i took all those classes...might as well try right?  and the app for the Econ major is due soon too...so need to fill those out.  the HAAS application is basically applying into college again...transcripts...essays...resume...the works.  so tiring.  so it comes to my attention a few days ago...that i need a transcript from MT SAC for the summer classes i took..but i thought my UC transcript would be fine cuz it has the units from MT SAC on there.  little did i realize that i didn't count...and when i did...the school won't give me the MT SAC transcript until end of next week and the app is due this MONDAY.  so...and MT SAC doesn't give out transcripts online...or on the phone...only in person...and it's not open on saturday or sunday.  i basically had friday to get someone over to mt sac and attempt to get my transcript for me.  hehe...sad to say i don't know that many people in walnut at the time...so yea...had my mom drive from her work during lunch to pick one up for me.  hehe...feel kinda bad for making her drive all the way :(...but i finally managed to get it...now just to recieve it from my parents sometime this weekend...but i think that's the easy part of this whole process.  ah...application...hehe...still need to finish the essays...and resume...hmm...hehe...feel so behind.  shirly told me yesterday...it's not like you to procrastinate like this...:(  am i procrastinating?  hehe...dunno...perhaps...but...i like to think of it as taking my time ;)  haha...yea...i will finish on time tho...don't you worry.    

so anyways...that has been my week...hopefully it doesn't get any worse.  even if it does tho...i don't think it should be that bad.  wish me luck tho...if i survive this semester...i'll be really happy.  many things to be done this semester to decide what i'm going to do in the future.  i hope that it all works out :)  hope...i like that word...and faith..although i'm not religious that much...i think everyone needs it...hope and faith in themselves and in who they want to be.  we all are our own worst enemy...but we shouldn't let it take over us.  anyways...yea...have to get to class now...more updates laters...happier stuff perhaps :)"

"event","okie dokie...so school has finally started...and I have had one heck of a day.  so i discover that i have missed the first lecture of one of my classes cuz they changed the time on me (and i found out after the time was over...cuz it was changed to 8 in the morning)...so yea...woe is me...hehe.  then i also wake up at 7 today to go to my 8 discussion only to discover that there is no discussion that week.  and then i proceed on to my 4.5 hours straight of lecture.  1.5 hour lectures are agonizing.  and i had 3.  so anyways...prof olney seems pretty cool...hehe...hopefully it will be a good econ class.  prof janos...hehe...he's funny...but kinda slow in talking...cuz he's kinda old and has an accent...but poly sci...hehe...i haven't a class like it at berkeley...i'm thinking i should stick it out...plus...omg...the class was so full...people were out sitting in the isles.  mcb...eh...hehe...this is one that i might consider dropping...kinda boring...not as interesting as i thought...or maybe it's cuz i had 3 hours of lecture beforehand and was getting restless...hehe...;) but the class seems to be more trouble than it's worth...dunno...lots of people in it tho.  so yea...i missed the cog sci lecture...so can't say much about it...hopefully i can see how it is on thursday...and see if i want to take it (darn class has also been more trouble than its worth).  so...only cs and psych classes left to audit...then...hehe...major dropping to do.  my cs prof is a lady tho...hehe...maybe she'll be better than garcia...you never know...but...cs scares me to death, not sure if i can take it.  anyways...yea...so the classes i might drop are mcb and cog sci...or mcb and cs...or just mcb...or cog sci and cs...hehe...decisions decisions.

hmm...it's been cold of late here...and it's started raining...very dreary day to start out the new semester, but ah well.  oh yea...bought a new scarf...hehe...actually my secret santa gave it to me...hehe...i chose it tho...haha...cuz it was a gift certificate.  had to pay tax tho...hehe...it's ok.  yea...and bought some of my books yesterday...econ...cog sci...mcb.  poly sci has a reader...psych book i got today...and cs...hehe...i have one of the two.  didn't spend that much money this time...hehe...we shall see which classes i take tho...cuz cs is going to cost some...hehe...we shall see...hopefully by the end of this week ;)

"event","so it's been like this really really really really long time since i've updated...and to keep all of y'all (haha...darn yi-han's e-mail...texan accent even while writing) still reading and to let you know i'm still alive =P i'm gonna write.

to catch up...i'm not sure what i've recently said...but i do recall writing this huge long entry...then having it erased...haha...cuz i didn't log in correctly...and then i decided i didn't want to rewrite it...so here i am now...a few days later...attempting to write a semblance of what i had before.  

first thing's first...HAPPY NEW YEAR and MERRY CHIRSTMAS...i guess it would be better to say HAPPY HOLIDAYS as well.  hope everyone had a great holiday season and have enjoyed their break.  me...hmm...i think it's all right.  last week up until today has been pretty boring (all i've done was stay in the house and read...watch tv....eat...watch my brother...play video games...computer games...typical stuff) and thus have gotten quite bored.  but...rewinding to begining of break...

the Sunday before Christmas...my friend Wendy (all the way from middle school...awww...she's such a nice friend) came over to my house (really nice of her cuz it's like 40 minutes away for her) came over and we went to go eat at CPK and go around the Marketplace and watched ANALYZE THAT.  it was a funny movie..and shopping was fun...finally found a gift for someone ;)  Yea...and we exchanged christmas/b-day gifts (cuz we combine them...of course her b-day is in May..but...haha...mine is in December).  Really cool...i got a new wallet (something that i have actually been wanting to buy), so it was really...how do you say...fortuitous ;)   

the next day...i went to go see LORD OF THE RINGS with Edward...hehe...long but pretty good movie.  very cool characterization of Golum (?)  and that essentially took up the whole afternoon...and i also found out that AMC had raised their prices!!!!!  what the heck!!! hehe...$7...for a STUDENT ticket!!! matinee too!!  hehe...i remember just last year you could buy a ticket for $4.25 (twi-lite)  i was very sad with AMC...hehe...they have lost my business...hehe...i am going to stay with Edwards Theaters now...the only theaters that Irvine has...with it's $6 tickets...hehe...i'm cheap...what can i say?  hehe...;)  and people wonder why i don't see movies in berkeley =P

Wednesday was Christmas...my parents had a bbq/potluck at our house (since we had just moved in and everyone wanted to see it) and about 8 families came with their truckload of kids...hehe...there were probably like 15 kids running around my house.  but overall...it was pretty fun.  and my presents this year weren't too bad...hehe...there were many useful things this year...hehe...i got a bag (haha...perfect match for Wendy's wallet...except for the fact that it doesn't fit too well...so yea...bag is still on my list of things to buy...but the bag i got was really cute...so i'll still use it), scrapbook kit (yay...hehe...i have always wanted to do one), B&N gift certificate (always a good thing...books...necessary things), lotion/spray (hehe...something i don't use much...but what the hey...they were nice), this really really really cute calendar (haha...now i have TWO desktop calendars and one wall calendar) and contact carrying case from you know who =), picture frame and lotion from shirly, a book from Zully =P along with a calendar, haha...and DDR!!! haha..yea...my mom bought that for us :)  i owe everyone a big THANKS for everything...you guys are so kind =)  so yea...food...kids play (me in my room ;P)...presents open...more food...talking...typical home get-together with parent's friends.

the next day...hehe...was probably the college version of the day before...meaning all Walnut people (plus me Irvine person) went over to Edward's house and had a potluck dinner.  we went to go watch ADAPTATION at The Block...haha...not the best movie...not something i would reccomend...unless you're Jon...or Julie...or Emily...hehe...:)  food was really good tho...everyone brought stuff and produced a magnificent feast that we couldnt' finish and Edward has been eating leftovers for days :)  we played mafia and spoons...i was the cop once!! hehe..finally got something good for once...hehe...although everyone was saying i was a bad cop...but hey...all the mafia died eventually!!  hehe...:)  spoons...interesting...had to ask the person who lost a question each time they lost.  lots of questions like ""who do you like...""  ""what qualities in a girl do you like..."" ""have you ever...""  hehe...don't really like asking people questions like that...or answering them for that matter.  sadly...i lost once and had to answer a question...but they were nice to me and it wasn't that bad (haha...thank goodness)  then i left around 10 cuz i had to go home...dropped off zully and shirly at their houses...and drove another 30 minutes to get back home at around 11.  all in all it was a pretty good day...lots of good company :)  

ok...so after that...i guess i went into hibernation...cuz i didn't really leave the house after that.  boring hibernation where i was about to go stir-crazy cuz i had nothing to do.  i was even playing YAHOO! games online with people...hehe...if you want to play with me...IM me!!  today...however...edward came over...and i was really happy...hehe...seeing a familiar face...hehe...so nice :)  hehe...anyways yea...having company around is good...at least you have motivation to do stuff at home rather than sit around doing nothing...hehe...and i didn't have to drive 40 minutes to go visit anyone...always a plus.  but yea..i owe a visit to Walnut now...and i probably will sometime in the next week or so.  

hmmm...let's see...what else...grades?  hmm...they were pretty decent...hehe...better than the previous semesters...so hopefully i can keep it up...haha...with my 21 units!!  so much i have to do for next semester...and the future...kinda scary...sometimes i wonder if i know what i'm doing when i do the things i do.  where i'm going to be 20 years from now...teachers in kindergarten asked us to do that...i always felt that you couldnt know what you would be doing...so why are they asking?...and that opinion is still true now...i don't know what the future holds for me.  but i do hope it holds the same love and friendship that i have today as well as a little luck and success :) hard work i know also figures into that...but hey...i know everyone works hard...we're berkeley students...it's a given :)   i guess all i can do now tho...is deal with things a little bit at a time...cuz...i can't handle it all...the more pressure i put on myself...the more scared i get...and the more uncertain i am about myself and how i do. so...for the new year...hehe...i resolve to work hard...take things slowly...communicate more...become more involved...and find something i really enjoy doing (try new things i guess...haha...within reason...)

that's it i guess...not much else to say...if you have read all the way to this point...hehe...thanks for bearing with me and all my writing.  hopefully i shall update more later...haha...hopefully with a bunch of shopping done!! (palm springs outlet mall...oooh...after CHristmas sales...after New Years sales...oooh.. :P)"

"event","so i'm all packed up and ready to go...i think...hehe...i'm going to be mad if i find that i forgot something...but...yea...oh well.  hmm...kinda sad to leave...yet...i want to go home too...the thing is...my dorm has become familiar to me...it has everything from my old room...funny how we try to make our new rooms similar to the ones we have at home...but now that everything is here...there's not really much familiar about my room at home (especially since i moved to a different house) :(  hehe...it's ok tho...i like my new house and i guess i can get used to my new room.  

so...since i haven't updated in a while...i guess i might.  so i had my finals on thursday and friday.  bio and econ on thursday and astro on friday.  not too bad overall i think.  bio wasn't that hard...but there were many tricky questions or simply things that i didn't remember...cumulative exams are tough...hehe...too much memorization.  the econ exam was essentially straight off the problem sets...hehe...to anyone who wants to take econ 100a...take it with Bhandarhi...he's a really easy teacher :)  still...there were some stuff i wasn't sure about...but i think overall it was all right.  astro...haha...i didn't study for the final 'till thursday night and friday during the day.  the final was all right...there were some stuff i didn't know...cuz you know i didn't study THAT much...but it was only a few questions and for the most part i got it.  so...in conclusion...finals were ok...hehe...we'll see how good when my grades come out.  kinda worried about ba...:(...i want to know my grade for the paper...hehe...i spent a lot of thought in that...and it was fun...hehe...i want to see how i did...tho i probably won't be able to find out.  

so yea...let's see...my birthday was fun :)  hehe...we studied in the morning...went to bio review session at 8 and studied bio 'till around 12 (campbell's original soup does make peter pale - cambrian, ordivician, silurian, devonian, mississippian, pensylvanian (carboniferous), permian; trial by jury in the cretaceous (triassic, jurassic, cretacious)...hehe...yea...interesting mnemonics :)  then we went to jack london's square...wow...very empty place.  but we watched a movie and walked around barnes and noble.  then we went to Taiwan Restraunt to eat...hehe...zully, faye, jon, peter, emily, and julie were there...hehe...interesting suprise...but it was good :)  fun stuff...embarassing birthday song...hehe...but yea...the cakes were cool...and the food was good...and the company was great :)  Thanks!!  hehe...zully and edward got me the same birthday card...is it cuz they know me so well...or because it was the only nice one out f the bunch?  hehe...and i got a baby winnie the pooh (i have always wanted one)...and a calendar...and a book...hehe...oh yea..and earings.  so yea...it was a fun day...considering finals and stuff...hehe...;)

so basically all of finals week i woke up like at 8 every day (this is all for darn review sessions early in the morning and for 8 am finals)...hehe...so yea...spent a lot of the day studying for bio and econ.  perhaps it was worth it and it all wasn't for nothing...hopefully ;)

ok...so i think that's basically caught up.  i'm off to home.  good luck to all who still have finals...i know you'll do great!! :P  promise to visit during vacation all right?  or else i'll be all lonely :(  hehe...so yea...merry christmas to all...it is coming in about 2 weeks...good luck christmas shopping and spending time with family :)  i'll updates later..."

"event","Hello all...so I've got a bunch of stuff to do and what am i doing but procrastinating.  hmm...how time flies huh?  i remember the semester beginning...i remember starting college...all as if it were yesterday...and now another semester is coming to an end.  kinda sad...and scary...hehe...considering that i don't really know where i'm going with all that i'm doing.  everyone says to do what you like...but...what do i like?  hehe...i know...not a question anyone else can answer but me...but...it's not somethign that i know right now.  i wanted to find myself through college and although i have found many things...the real me hasn't really been one of them.  looking back into the past...yes...i've changed...but deep down i'm still the same person.  maybe i'm too scared to try...i don't want to believe that tho...i keep on hoping that there's something out there for me...and yet...i know also that i have to go searching for it and that it will not come to me.  but what is it?  what are my dreams? and will they come true?  right now getting thru this last week of school and finals is already a trial.  I have to try tho huh?  hehe...rejection is so harsh tho...so so harsh...

anyways...yea...holday season is here.  went home for thanksgiving.  home is really nice.  it's good to get home and be with family...hehe...too bad my friends weren't there too.  i went shopping too...oh yea...after thanksgiving shopping...hehe...i got myself 2 jackets..hehe...workable i guess...hehe...but i do still need a thick jacket.  hehe...christmas is coming...not to mention my birthday.  so what should i do for my birthday?  hehe...what about stay in my dorms and study?  i have three finals two days after my birthday...::sigh:: not really sure what i want to do yet...we shall see.  maybe just dinner then or something huh?  hehe...not in the mood to plan anything tho...hehe...too much junk...

hmm...i don't know what i'm saying...anyways...back in berkeley now...with only two weeks of school left...AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!...ready and yet not ready for it to end...hehe...another semester to start after that...::sigh:: time stops for no one even if they don't want it to.  people are going to come back today...hehe...so there will be more people around tonight hopefully...hehe...a bit quiet with so few people around...

anyways...i think that's enough...i shall think about my holiday plans later..hehe...so far i've got christmas...and...ucla...and...hehe...that's about it...staying at home and bumming around...hehe...oh yea...maybe a ""house-warming"" get-together as shirly puts it...hehe...hmm...shirly...where are you...i thought u said you would plan it ;)  hehe...we shall see..."

But the shower was nice...not as nice as last year's tho...and much much later than last year.  hehe...looked at the shower at the base of the big c hill...hehe...cuz me too tired to go up much further.  good thing i didn't have class at 8 this morning tho...i don't think i would have been functioning.  i don't think i'm functioning all that well right now...me want to take nap :)  but i need to do my work!!!  nap..work...nap...work...hmm....such a dilemma.  

FTC was this past weekend...lots of fun camping in the mountains...hehe...nice tho...and i won something!! hehe...huge movie basket...hehe...lots of candy...a calendar...candles...and $10 to hollywood video...fun stuff.  berkeley has a lot of people...much fun :)

"event","Hello all to my devoted and lovely readers!! (hehe...all 0 of you ;P)  I know i haven't updated much this semester.  I could say that i've been really really busy...hehe...and that's kinda true...but honestly...probably just too lazy.  

So what have i been up to?  hmm...this past weekend...not that much.  gave a surprise b-day party to my roomie and andrew...hehe...ice cream cake...yum!!! :P  Went to 99 Ranch...hehe...Cubfest.  Oh yea!  Homecoming.  we won!!!!!  YAY!!!!!!!!!!  hehe...against UCLA too!!! hehe...considering how badly they beat us at their homecoming last year...this is sweet revenge ;) Although it was a pretty close game.  Angels also won...hehe...me a newfound fan of Angels...hehe...just cuz i went to one game during the summer...haha...beat the Giants!! (hehe...maybe i should say that in Berkeley...hehe...giants being from SF and all)

anyways, yea...second set of midterms coming up soon.  ba paper to write (blah...stupid neverending papers...hehe...although...after this...more than halfway there...hehe...) ba module test this friday too...oooh...and i seems kinda hard.  only two more modules to go!!! hehe...i can do it!!  hmm...yea...so bio midterm coming up and then astro and then econ and then ba...all in two weeks...hehe...hopefully i can get through it.  another ba paper that week too.  ba is psyching me out kinda...hehe...scary haas people...sometimes i wonder if i want to be a part of that.  i mean, business is interesting...but do i want to deal with people like that.  although there is a point in that we'll have to deal with people like that anyways, but...hehe...in business you'll be dealing with them constantly.  haas...hmm...hehe...maybe i consider doing econ instead...haha...actually do my intended major when i applied to Cal!! ;)  dunno...then there's also doubling...gosh...wonder if i can do it tho...really is dampening my schedule planning for the next few years.  why am i so indecisive?!?!  hehe...anyways...yea...telebears coming up...must choose classes.  darn cog sci class is giving me trouble.  should i take cs too?!?  hehe...dunno!!!  oooh well...maybe i stick with my 22 units ;)  blah...and kill myself in the process right?!?  hehe...maybe.

hmm...so...yea...construction going on in unit 1.  darn school is only giving us a $50 credit a semester!!  hehe...come on!!  this construction is annoying and putting us out with its darn detours...blah...oh well...hehe.    

not sure what else to write...hmm...we'll see when it comes.  bye ta ta for now!!"

"event","hmm...so i find myself staring at the computer, having no else talking to me, or perhaps no one wanting to talk to me...hehe...dunno...:)  school has become a neverending sequence of reading...hehe...it's a wonder it all gets in my head.  kinda sad that when i get back from class in the beginning of the afternoon i just read and keep on reading until night...and even then...it's still not done.  hehe...okay...so maybe i take small breaks and talk to people online in between, but somehow it feels that i've been doing this all day...hehe...and frankly...i'm tired.  actually..quite bored...hehe...however, if i stop to do something else (not that there's much to do right now), i feel guilty for not doing my homework as i will be getting very behind if i don't.  but, hey, i haven't updated in a while so i have decided to.  hehe...this time, i shall finish.  i've started many entries that i've never finished...sigh...hehe...maybe i just don't want to finish.  but finish i shall!!

unfortunately, i seem to have run out of things to write...some things just seem to be too much for me to put into words right now...perhaps i'm not ready to face it...hehe...not that i don't think it or think about it to myself all the time, but putting things into words is always hard, even writing it down.  not that people read this i don't think...hehe...since i haven't written here in so long people probably think i don't write anymore.  not that i haven't thought about it...but neither the time nor the inspiration has come.  hehe...somehow this is turning out a little depressing.  this is what happens when i think too much...hehe...why is it that i don't think of happy things?  hehe...i guess when i'm by myself i tend to think about the things that i don't want to think about, which is why i like it better when someone's there to talk to.  then again, there's times where i don't feel like talking.  so...i've backed myself into my own little corner...yes...i know it...hehe...but i can't help it.  ::sigh:: sometimes your own worst enemy is yourself...your fears and your thoughts...hehe...

so on to what i've been doing the past few weeks....well...finally finished my first round of midterms.  i guess i can say that i did fairly well on them...with the exception of a few.  the classes that i'm taking aren't that hard...so somehow doing well on it doesn't seem that happy.  but then again, they aren't easy classes, so i should be happy that i did decently, right?  hehe...again...what goes on in my head...::sigh::  all right...so school wise, i guess everything's going all right...hehe...with the exception of the workloads of reading and junk i have to do...but, yea, i know, everyone has to do it too (i know that, you don't have to tell me).  AHH...and deciding on classes for next semester is going to be fun too...

went to the berkeley lab open house this past weekend.  it was fun..hehe...lots of science-y stuff there...hehe...a few things that went WAY over my head, but others that were just cool to look at...hehe...and we got free stuff...which is always a plus.  oooh...and they gave us free ice cream, sorbet, and sugar/rock candy...hehe...yea.  also, the view from the labs was really nice...you could see the whole campus from there.  hehe...if only we could stay to see the sunset and if it was a really clear day...it would have been really nice :)  lots and lots of walking tho...hehe...didn't wear my tennis shoes so my feet were hurting by the end of the day...hehe...::sigh:: and we took the bus too...

oh yea...it's also been really hot as of late...hehe...seriously hot...no like being in my room in the afternoon...really really hot...especially today...and bugs were like flying into our room...blah...i just know i'm going to end up with so many bug bites tonight...hehe...darn bugs...attracted to light.  

hmm...hehe...julie made dumplings from scratch last weekend, i think. hehe...wow...such an accomplishment...hehe...we all pitched in to help...hehe..andrew and his ""novelty"" dunplings.  we ate it all...hehe...however we had leftover meat...so julie got an eggplant and she made it with eggplant...of course, no one else really like eggplant except for us...hehe...but they ate it anyways ;)  who can resist julie's persuasive efforts?  hehe...=P  let's see...what else...hehe...we went to the berkeley botanical gardens for one of our bio labs...hehe...i'm thinking that it would be really nice when it gets cooler...and spring comes...hehe...then all the pretty flowers would be blooming...and birds and butterflies...hehe...maybe my imagination is running away with me.  oh yea...saw the free screening of ""red dragon""...hehe...scary movie...but not too bad overall...hehe...interesting plot and good actors...hehe...a bit gory...but...hehe...that's movies these days for you.  yea...me being bad...hehe...saw it the night before my ba mod 2 test...hehe...bad bad!!  hehe...but hey...i'm telling you...i'm getting bored of all this reading...

all rights...enough for today...hehe...must get back to the exciting world of...sutyding!!!...hehe...i do that a lot lately...can you tell ;)  hehe...all right...more updates laters..."

hmm...went to cheesecake factory saturday...oooh...nice cheesecake.  interesting location.  went shopping in SF...and went to chinatown to the autumn festival.  yummy food...hehe...think we ate too much.  bought a skirt in old navy...hehe...bargain basement...was going to buy a shirt...but sadly...it was too big (and it was a medium too)

so yeah...planning stuff to do for that one week of no work and no school before i go off to berkeley...awww...no matter how much i miss berkeley at times...i know i'll miss friends and family down here.  this summer it seems like not many people have been able to get together to see each other...hehe...hard when everyone is off doing something on their own.  but i guess...yea...we all still keep in touch, so it's still pretty good. i can live with that...hehe...:)  last night i met up with some friends from high school who i haven't seen in a while...it was fun to see them all and catch up on stuff.  we all haven't changed and yet we have...hehe...much fun...hehe...worth driving all the way to walnut i guess...hehe :)

blah...i've gotta figure out my schedule...hehe...currently signed up for 21 units...hehe...way too much...need to drop a few.  don't know what to drop~!  stupid major requirments and pre-requisites...blah...

"event","hehe...do you ever wonder what people are thinking when they read what you write?  how what one person writes in their journal can somehow make you feel bad or left out?  or happy because they mentioned you?  hehe...kinda makes me realize how many people i haven't seen or talked to in a REALLY, really long time.  Not that i haven't wanted to, but there never seems to be a chance to these days.  sometimes these days, i don't even know what to say.  hehe...we'll see though...

so going to be moving next weekend.  anyone who wants to see my new house...hehe...feel free to visit ;P  not that it's anything much, but it'd be nice to have people come see.  I'll take you around to see the ""sights and sounds"" of Irvine...haha...which will take all of 10 minutes i think ;)

two more weeks of school...=P  can't wait for it all to end and be able to relax that last week before i head back to berkeley.  finally be able to do stuff that i've been wanting to do, but haven't had the time to do...hehe...we'll see if any of that happens tho ;)  these next two weeks might be a little hectic tho...with moving and finals and all...but hopefully it'll work out.  too much stuff...too little time...haha...reminds me that i should probably start packing huh?  kinda excited about moving to a new house...hehe...it's a new house and all...but sad to leave walnut.  ::sigh:: it's been my home for so long :(  the longest time i've ever lived in one place.  leaving all the people i've gotten to know and cherish that live nearby...awww...bye bye Walnut...i shall miss you. ::sniff::  not that i'll be living there that much, but still, you know?  hehe...vacations won't be the same :)

ah well...such is life...waiting for these next three weeks to pass...then no more work, no more school...looking forward to it :)  get to sleep ;)  hehe...i think i do too much of that already tho...shouldn't do too much of it.  be productive...yes...haha...spy on my new neighbors ;)  do some stuff...we shall see...maybe i'll be bored...hehe...but shouldn't be that bad.  exploring Irvine shall be my new past-time.  hehe...:)"

"event","bleh...so three weeks of summer school officially over. yay!!! hehe...halfway there!!!  4 more weeks 'till i'm done with everything though (work and school and moving)...sigh...a month could never be so long, but i think it'll go by relatively fast.

so today...friday...i have no school, but i start work at 2 (hehe...cuz he thinks i have school) so i had the morning free.  but could i sleep in (even though i really, really wanted too?) NOOOO!!!  hehe...i had to go drop my brother off at school...and in order to do that, i had to wake at 7:45.  better than my usual 6:15 i guess, but still...come on...hehe...i want my sleep ;)  i came back...took a 45 minute nap (one that i did not want to wake up from) and then went to go meet Shirly so we could go to Cal Poly and reseach stuff for our Art History paper.  Me researching Degas and she researching van Gogh.  Stayed there making copies and such 'till like 11.  Then i went off to meet Wendy to see this Korean actor that was supposed to come to this one place...hehe...apparently he didn't show up...but i got to go eat lunch with Wendy, so it wasn't all a loss. :)

so yes...productive morning i guess...but by the time 2:00 rolled by...i was really, really tired.  hehe..not good when you have to drive and take care of kids.  i guess i wasnt' that bad though...but i was a bit lazier and less inclined to do things than usual...hehe. that's what being tired does to you i guess =P

anyways, that's about it.  nothing much else...still a month to go...hehe...kinda sad that i'm looking forward to school starting...but i guess with going to school, it's easier to see your friends and get together and do stuff since you're all in the same place...haha...and of course...school is fun too ;) hmm...oh well...i'll live :)  

oh yeah...hehe...got my first jury duty summons ever.  thanx to those that helped me thru my anxiety attack about it ;)  hehe...what can i say...i worry alot :)  can't go on jury duty...hehe...hopefully i shall be excused...well...i have to be excused...it's not my fault!!!  i didn't do anything wrong!!! :(  then why am i worried!!!  stuff i guess...

hmm...more updates laters me thinks...cuz me tired..."

"event","So i haven't really written in here for a long time.  somehow though i really can't find much to say.  A lot of things have been going on lately.  I can't say that i haven't been worried, or upset, or have blown things out of proportion.  I simply haven't had much time and some are things that i would rather not think about.  the more i dwell on something, the more it bothers me...and sometimes there isn't much i can do about it if it bothers me, so i don't want it to bother me even more.  Not that i've been feeling this recently...i have dealt with most of it...but something i read a while ago prompted me to think about a few things again.  we all have our problems and we all deal with them differently.  we may not all have the same problems, but we all have problems and worries.  somehow its comforting to see that we're not alone, but kinda sad in that we don't confide in each other as much as our own public journal postings.  hopefully a real person would be more comforting...hehe...but who am i to talk?  not like i talk to people much either...but i do talk eventually, to those people who are patient and understanding enough to listen.  not that i don't love all my friends, but some are just harder to talk to than others...and sometimes...the opportunity never seems to present itself as a time to talk...::sigh::

so summer is passing by before my eyes...before i know it i'll be going back to berkeley.  hopefully things will work out.  a few things are up in the air for me, but we'll see how they land i guess.  hehe...i can't say that MT SAC is fun...but it is nice to see some old friends again there.  to be able to sit down and talk to a person every day that i haven't sat down and talked with for the past school year is comforting...as if some things never change :)  but the classes are all right too i guess...hopefully not that hard...haven't taken the first test in one of my classes yet (so hoping that it isn't that bad) and my art history class, though boring, hehe...isn't that hard.  work...sigh...hehe...so so so so so hot...hehe...cleaning up in the evening is so torturous...haha...so hot.  the kids are annoying as well...but there are those moments that make up for it...when the parents thank you...when the kids look up at you and smile...when they call your name and ask for help...when they hold you and won't let go...when us secretaries get together and talk about things that only we would understand :)  It's an experience that i don't regret having, though i do complain about it.  it's interesting...i'll give it that...i don't love it as others do their job, but it is nice at times :)

what have i been doing lately?  hmmm...went to the Long Beach Aquarium and to see MIB II...went to the Norton Simon Museum of Art with Shirly (for our art history class)...went to re-highlight my hair...went to see fireworks...hmmm...that's about all that i can remember...hehe...not much i guess...but some of it was fun nonetheless.  most of my time lately has been with school and work...and ""occassionally"" talking to a few special people =P  

that's about it...pretty long update...hehe...been meaning to write one for a long time...so i'll updates laters...have to study and stuff...AHHH!! STILL so HOT!!!! hehe :)"

anyways...interesting week...three months, yup...it's been more than i could have imagined =P  went to go see ""Bad Company""...funny movie...don't know why it's called that though...eh...oh well...it was fun to watch...ate at Olive Garden (oooh...mints...hehe) Had a somewhat ""alcoholic"" dish...haha...oh well...we were asked whether we wanted to order wine or not...wow..hehe...do i look that old?  hmm...we also went to Marie Callanders another day with berkeley and SD people...as well as WHS people and Shirly...big table...hehe...expensive meal.  haven't been there since NHS banquet like two years ago...hehe...it was fun...got to catch up with Shirly and spend time with everyone else (haha...shirly is a fast driver :P)  we also went bowling after that.  yay for the fact that the girls won...haha =P  i bowled an 83...hehe...higher than my first time i think...but i beat a few of the guys...so i can't say that i bowled that badly right?  :)  I got paid too!! hehe...minimum wage...ah well...it's money i guess.  My boss also treated us to dinner yesterday...wow...nice...hehe...expensive...seafood...lobster, fish, mussles, tofu, vegetables...""us"" meaning the other secretaries (of them only 3 of us came), but it was interesting.  also, i found out that one of the other secretaries is getting married!! wow!!!  hehe...she's older than me, but, it's still wow....hehe...very nice ring (and the guy's not so bad either ;P)  she's getting married next month...hehe...congrats to her.  haha...i guess...looking back...i ate a lot of big meals this week...wow...hehe  ::sigh:: can you believe it?  i have to go to work at 8 in the morning next week...all day...ai...hehe...it's cuz their summer session is starting so they need more people there to help, but still...hehe...glad mt sac is starting, so i won't have to stay all day after next week...

well...that's about what's been happening this past week.  been talking to a few old friends...ah...nice to hear their voices every once in a while.  haven't had much time to get together, but knowing they're there i guess...hehe...still...would rather spend time with them, but you take what you can get i guess.  kinda bored right now...should probably find something to do...so i'll write later..."

Probably the greatest Jedi Knight of all. Like Obi Wan, you are wise and keep your feet on the ground at all times. You will not be outsmarted by anyone. You are always faithful to your friends. Be careful though, danger lurks around every corner - you could even be betrayed by those closest to you.<br><br>"

"event","All righty...maybe not long time no update, but i guess long time no update on important stuff.  perhaps i'm just too busy to stop and think about life and how this past year has changed me and how things are going to be for the next 3 years of college.  I've gotta say...the first year passed by so fast...yet so slowly...hehe...perspective wise right now it seemed to go by really fast and yet when i was in the middle of it...i was wondering when it would end.  As i look back on my first year at college...gosh...the memories...the pain...the suffering...the stress...the tears...the anger...the happiness...the laughter...the smiles...and the joy...it was a year of mixed emotions for me...a year of discoveries...of realizations...of testing my limits...of hardships...of friendship.  it was a hard time for me...i have to admit.  being away from my parents and from close proximity with my closest friends there were times where i felt so alone.  and i struggled a lot with my classes...both academically and in choosing them.  the pressure from my parents to do well didn't help either.  and...there's also living up to everyone's expectations...everyone says...oh, you'll do well, you're zhimin...as if that's the answer to my problems...but it isn't...what causes me to stress out more is that they have more confidence in my abilities than i do myself and it puts more pressure on me to do as well as they believe i can do...and when i don't...i feel as if i'm letting everyone else down, not just myself...and it's stressful...letting myself down is already hard enough...but letting down my friends and family...it's something else entirely.  but i guess i shouldn't complain...the fact that they believe in me must mean something...but sometimes i think that they have too much confidence in me without really listening or understanding my situation.  but with the hardships, the pressure, the stress, the loneliness...there was also the happier times of ""laughter and love""  the memories of the good times shared with old friends and new (and newly found old friends)...the memory of the occasional good grade...the spark of interest that lights up when a new topic is discussed in class...the long conversations that sometimes end in tears...the heart-to-heart talks that don't happen often enough...the voicing of worries...the pats of reassurance...laying in the sun on those wonderful berkeley days...the accidental meetings with friends...the dinners shared...the class time spent with friends...the joking around...the late night talks...catching up with an old friend...exploring your feelings...helping the community...being there for someone...

a friend of mine sent me a letter recently...and it almost made me cry at the end..i'm not sure why...i miss her i guess...but it's more than that.  i look back on the past year with fondness but also sadness.  from now on things are so much more different...people are changing...i am changing...people are no longer who i thought they were.  in a sense i guess that we're all growing up...becoming the person we are meant to be...but to all my friends...i hope you never lose the special qualities that you all have that make me hold you close to my heart.  perhaps our paths will not cross again in the ways it has before...but as my friend said...i believe that every person we meet in life, we were meant to meet, that that person was meant to come into my life at that moment and change me forever...i thank my friends for coming into my life and making me the person i am...i carry a part of you with me always...and hopefully i have done the same for you...

it's been an enriching experience...my first year in college...and i hope for the best in the years to come.  here's to the hope that i cling to constantly and the faith i hold in my friends and in myself.  perhaps it won't be what i expect...because there is a suprise around every corner...but i'm hoping for the best.

k...enough contemplation...worked all week this week...hehe...it's been tiring...but interesting...the kids are cute and fun to talk to at times (other times...they're just annoying mosters) and there are times where i enjoy it.  it's a decent enough job i guess...even tho i probably complain a lot about it.  hehe...seen edward a few times this week too, he's going back to berkeley next week...awww...so sad...hehe...but the other UC's are getting out so other friends will be coming in to take up some time :)  still tho...;P  hmmm...that's about it for now...i've spent too much time on this already...i shall update more later then..."

(hehe...j/k :P)  finals and junk...i know how it feels...i went through it too...oooh...and moving out ::sigh:: much trouble in that field...just glad that my roommates were already gone by then (but that also means that i had to clean up after them when they left...erg...) so i had a unit 1 single for like one day...interesting feeling...SOOOOO much space...oooh...so looking forward to having a whole closet to myself next year ::sigh:: such luxuries that all the rest of you have (darn people with doubles or unit 3 triples) :)  anyways...no i'm not bitter...i'll have that next year so i'm happy enough  ::sigh:: thinking about next year...hehe...i have like 6 classes in mind to take next semester...i can only choose like 4-5 without risking killing myself and going over the max number of units per semester...so...must choose...but choose what?  ai...decisions decisions...cs or not cs?  econ? psychology? what if i don't get into cog sci?  hehe...the only classes that i'm sure about is bio and ba10...perhaps psychology too...but cs?  erg...that class has burned me way too much...but it's not like a don't like the subject...just sometimes i feel that i'm not that good at the subject (i'm not bad...but not great at it either)  then there's econ...do i want to take it?  it shouldn't be too hard...so maybe i could take it and drop only one class...but which one?  if i take cs...i should only take 4 classes i think...but to sacrifice the other classes?  ai..hehe...decisions...i could take the class later...but it's not like i have that much time left to explore...only two more semesters.  hehe...jon was commenting yesterday how i was trying to do business and every other major at the same time...hehe...he said that he liked the idea...but...hey...hehe...it's hard...and sometimes i wonder what the heck i'm doing...too many decisions...and i'll have to settle on a major at one point...the most i feel i could do is double and perhaps i have to be realistic as well as ambitious...cuz...i do have to qualify to get into the major right?  and my gpa isn't THAT great...no arguments people...ahhh!!! i'm just hoping that i'll find something that catches my attention next year...something that i'll find that i love to do or at least and really interested in learning more about and something that i actually have a chance at doing well in...you have no idea how jealous i am of you people who know what you're going to and are just straightforwardly going for it...how can you be so sure that it's what you want?  hehe...maybe i'm just unsure of myself...but i'm going to continue this taking classes from all over the place for next year and see where it takes me...i'll definitely decide by next year...haha...look i become an mcb major (god forbid!!)  hehe...no offense to all the future M.D's out there...eh...my gpa's not good enough for that anyways...and darn MCAT's...and darn organic chemistry and physics...nah...hehe...we shall see what the future holds...only time will tell huh?  hehe...

all righty...on to other stuff today...kinda hungry...maybe i cook meself something...french toast? fried rice? late breakfast or early lunch?  hehe...brunch!!  hehe...maybe...i'll write again laters..."

"event","hello...so yes...summer has officially started for me (haha to all the other UC people!!!  j/k :P)  can i say that perhaps i am a little bored?  hehe...but yea...i'll take boredom over stressing out over finals any day...hehe...rest and relaxation...suuure...hehe...i have stuff to do..just not up to doing them at the moment...so therefore i am here writing and not out there doing something productive (or if not productive then at least fun and interesting -- not likely to happen very often...but...umm...hoping it will)

so yea...four out of five of my finals grades are out...well...the fourth one i know but it isn't on bear facts yet...the other three are up and stupid classics still has yet to put it up (and mail me my paper darn it!!!)  cs...hmm...hehe...i can live with that grade...i'm glad with what i got...hehe...considering the mean to the final was a 40/90...hehe...saved me and my grade from disaster...haha...=P  stat and econ were pretty good...i so totally studied for econ...and stat...well...i prepared pretty well for that too...so the grades i got were relieving...hehe...  PE...yay...i passed...yay for me!!  hehe...it'd be sad if i didn't pass tho...so sad...hehe... All that's left is classics...hurry up and read those papers!!!  hehe...we'll see how that one turns out.  that class is so...sooo...i don't know...unconcrete i guess...it's like i don't know what i'll get cuz everything is based on like the final and the paper...and that isn't graded until like now...so it's like i'm so unsure as to what i'll get cuz i don't know...ahhh!!! don't like uncertainty...hehe...

hmmm...k...interesting conversations with random people lately...we'll see what happens when it happens...looking too far ahead into the future is scary...one thing at a time is all i can handle right now...hehe...just waiting for the fallout...blah...as i said about introspective thinking...

k...i'm gonna go now...nap sounds good...hehe...although shopping is nice too..."

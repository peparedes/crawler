I'm still trying to catch my breath/self/life from slipping away. But that's okay. I'm sure it'll work itself out. Right now i have bigger things to worry about then petty little things.


New places are nice....Fuzzy, kind of warm and squishy....School starts in Janurary. well at least my semester does. Which is cool. There will be snow on the ground. I like snow. There will be lots of snow on the ground......

I just spent a whole bunch of money on new clothes, that I probably wont get a chance to wear before i have to go away again. ::Shrugs:: oh well. At least I am very greatful to have new clothes.

Worthless are those who injure others vengefully,
While those who stoically endure are like stored gold.

The gratification of the vengeful lasts only for a day,
But the glory of the forbearing lasts until the end of time.

Though unjustly aggrieved, it is best to suffer the suffering
And refrain from unrighteous retaliation.

Wha? So i get dressed and like 45 minuets later Marilyn was knocking on my door. 


So we went out and hung out Met up with Justine and Chad and them. 

We were at Bar-B-Que Bar. and who do i run into? Micheal from Kismet with his grilfriend. Drunk as piss. It was weird to say the least. You know? I was like umm hi. And he remembered my name. He was like HI LIZ!! i was like oh boy. And he was saying how he hadnt seen me in a while and stuff and i should really stop by the store sometime and say hi and how he really loved the song that was playing. I clung to Ryan (Marilyn's gay boyfriend) I was like save me! 


Yeah it was weird. 


Anyways, I have to go puke in a trash can right now. So yeah whatever."

No water nothing. So stop freaking out and thinking your life is so bad because you have to pay $3.00 a gallon for gas. At least you have a road to drive on. At least you have food and clean water and Air conditioning. Have you been to Mississippi or Lousianna? It's hot as fucking piss. Especially in September. So get the fuck over it chill the fuck out, and dont freak out that there isnt going to be any gas. Maybe if you not buy SUV's and the what-not. This would not be a problem.....Just a thought a though. 



And on this same thought, my dad shocked the living piss out of me last night. Seriously? He never talks politics ever. And last night my Brother was freaking out about gas and what we are going to do and etc. Race track didnt have any gas etc. Whatever. And My mother told him that the President said we would have gas. And My dad seriously looks up from the Salad he was making and goes ""He said there was Weapons of Mass descrution also, and i still havent seen those fucking things!"" And my mother goes, well we are still looking. My dad rolled his eyes and without missing a beat goes. Where are they hiding them RAE!?!? Where in their fucking turbans!?!?! 


I was like ummm yeah i'm going to go over there in the other room because you are scaring me, greatly. Yeah thanks.

Like Telly has a show saturday night. It starts at 10 and there are like 6 bands. If i get out at like 11:20 i can make it. But I'm not sure I want to go. A) Annie and T will probably be there, and B) I just dont feel like going out. I want people to leave me alone. 


I'm a little on the depressed side. Eh what can you do. My food intake has dropped dramatically. ::shrugs:: I'm not ever very hungry and i'm never in the mood to eat. I think that if i had some nice things i would be okay. ::Shrugs::

Thank you to Service department manager for promising me it was only going to be an hour and it ended up being like three. 

Thanks to the service people who didnt want to help me and made me wait half an hour to even acknowledge me even though I had an appointment and i was even ten minuets early. 

Thanks to the fuck head who kept rolling his eyes at me as I explained four times that i had an appointment and that it was to fix my stereo. 

Thanks to the nice lady who finally stepped in and spoke with me breiefly and did all my paperwork. 

Thanks to the fucking 80 year old man who doesnt know what fucking day it is and didnt want to move my car until i called my father and started screaming for him to get down here. 

Thank you to the morons who take three hours to install a Cd player in a car! 

Thanks you to the fucking Asswipe of a G.M. who thought i was joking until Monty called to straighten everything out. 

Thanks to the fucking bookkeeper who tried to charge me $600 for a stereo that is not worth $600 and is still under warranty. And who continued to not listen to me as i tried to not so calmly explian to her that it is under warranty and that i refuse to pay for it. And if she insisted on charging me for it thos motherfuckers take their fucking piece of shit car and shove it up their ass'. (Today has not made me popular at Classic let me tell you) 

Thank you Daniel at Starbucks for listening to me bitch for an hour after the car was finally finished. You are so sweet I adore you!

"event","Yeah, so this is the deal. Tomorrow they are hopefully fixing my car, and washing and waxing it, even though that is already a free service. Fucking Classic. Anyways, but they called to ask about my visit last night I have to call them back, for i was at work. 


I took my first political survey last night. So those people who wonder where they get the statistics on who's happy with what. They actually do call your house and ask for the youngest person over 18 with the birthday that is next. It's weird. and they ask you a bunch of randomly weird questions and you are supposed to feel like you've done your civic duty anwsering these questions. So yeah. I did my civic duty and now i dont have to show up for Jury duty EVER!! If it were only that simple. 



Anyways, I realized my birthday is coming up. Yes I said it My birthday. Am I excited, No not really. It's another day another year older. Eh what can i say? We are going to Tampa later that week though! YAY!! ::yawn:: So what do i want you ask? Hmmmmmm... That is a tough one. Because the things i want are so random and obsecure that it's rediculous. But here are some suggestions. 

A cruise on over to WWW.Interpunk.com 
Search under Lagwagon, Or Me first and the Gimme Gimmes. 
I have one lagwagon shirt, It's called Dogma, it has a cross on it. Dont buy that one. I already did. 

You may also go to WWW.Sleater-Kinney.Com and buy a shirt for me there. I <3 Sleater-Kinney. 


Or WWW.Fatwreck.com and look up Me first and Lagwagon. Or the Epoxies. And may find something there. 


Or you can donate money to the Liz wants another tattoo fund and call it even. Yeah your call. 


It is best to not all buy the Hoodies. Because i dont want Six of the same thing. As Leon has already mentioned that he was buying the two hoodies. (Me First and Lagwagon) as an FYI.


Happy shopping."

Cd player doesnt work, It's under warranty, so i shall have them replace it, and that will be that. 



Ohhhh No. Things in the universe for Liz do not work this way. It is not cut and dry. it is a matter of calling and asking if it is okay for me to bother them, with my business. They will call me back and tell me, yeah that's okay. Come and fucking bother us at this point! Then I have to go in, they have to remove my stereo Get a part number. Order the part. Send me home with my broken ass fucking stereo. And when they get the part sometime in the next two weeks they will give me a call and tell me when it is convienet for them to waste a full fucking day of my life to replace a shit ass part to begin with!!

I seriously wanted to bash someone's skull in. I called Jill in tears. I was so angry/frustrated. But my dad said that if they give me a problem next time. That Monty will go in with me (My dad's company's lawyer) and he'll take care of it. Because at this point I'm fucking done with it. I'm about to send my brand new fucking car off a hill and buy a fucking Bike. This is rediculous!"

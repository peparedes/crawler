"event","This weekend I sat down and did something I never do &mdash; I wrote out New Year's Resolutions.

I've never been the resolution-y type.  I'd occasionally make a list, and it would be a vague list &mdash; write more, exercise more.

This time, I sat down and asked myself, ""What am I trying to accomplish?  What do I want to do?  What will make my life measurably better?""

I came up with some ideas.  I wrote them down.  I came up with some more ideas.  I wrote those down, too.  I typed them up.  I reordered them.  I rewrote a few.  Then I formatted the list for printing, picking some suitably appropriate fonts.

Here's the list:

<blockquote>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Write 1,000 words per day.&nbsp; <b>Note: </b>Things that do not count: work writing, blog posts, forum posts, e-mails.
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make at least 3 blog posts per week.&nbsp; <b>Note:</b> Link Round-Ups do not count, nor do Tweet compilations.
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave the cubicle every day for lunch.&nbsp; Do not eat lunch at the desk.&nbsp; Do not work through lunch.&nbsp; Take a book to read.&nbsp; Write in a notebook.
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave work at work.&nbsp; If deadlines are missed, deadlines are missed.
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eat breakfast daily.
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pack a lunch each workday.
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walk three days a week, no matter the weather, no matter the time, unless there is snow on the ground.
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the alarm clock for 6 o&#39;clock every morning.&nbsp; Saturday and Sunday are exceptions.
9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make the bed every morning.
10.&nbsp;&nbsp;Shave thrice weekly.
11.&nbsp;&nbsp;Submit one job application or resume each week.
12.&nbsp;&nbsp;Develop a podcast to launch in the spring.
13.&nbsp;&nbsp;Code new front page for website by April.
14.&nbsp;&nbsp;Resume and complete <i>The Misadventures Project</i>.
15.&nbsp;&nbsp;Work through the <i>One Minute Gaelic</i> podcast, and continue with <i>Teach Yourself Gaelic</i>.
16.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reread <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> and the Lankhmar series, for possible blog series.
17.&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to <i>The Lost Lennon Tapes</i> episodes, also for possible blog series.</blockquote>

I'm going to print out three copies.  One I will hang in the office at home.  One I will hang in my kitchen.  And one I will hang in my cubicle at work.  The idea is that they'll always be somewhere where I can see them, read them, think about them, and internalize them.

Some of these may seem like lifehacks.  I don't eat breakfast every day.  I don't usually make my bed; as someone who lives alone, I don't usually see the point.  I don't shave because I don't deal with the public anymore; why be presentable?  I want to implement and reinforce better behavior on my part.

Toward the end, I name some specific things that I want to complete or embark upon.  Some are projects that I began and then lost interest in.  Some are things that I've wanted to do but have never started.  I wrote them down to keep myself accountable.

Yes, I really do want to learn Scots Gaelic.  I got far enough into the <i>One Minute Gaelic</i> podcast that I can understand a little of the Gaelic used in Starz's <i>Outlander</i>.

Tomorrow after work, I'll stop at Target or Office Max and pick up a daily planner where I can track my progress on these.  And, if more ideas occur to me as the year wears on, I can write them down.

That's the plan.

If you have any questions on any of these, please ask."

"event","Last week was... not the best.

I should clarify. It wasn&#39;t <i>bad</i>. It was simply stressful. And hectic. And tense. And all of the things that a week that where the catalog and orders go to press usually is.

Thankfully, the week ended with the Nerd Prom &mdash; the Employee Appreciation Party (or the Christmas Party) &mdash; and after the week that had been, the Nerd Prom was muchly needed.

Last week, the Christmas tree in the office lobby was put up, and it was decorated, as it always is, with stockings for the Salvation Army&#39;s Angel Tree program.

I did the Angel Tree for the first time three years ago &mdash; <a href=""http://www.allyngibson.com/?p=6757"">and enjoyed it</a> &mdash; but for various reasons, mainly not checking the tree at the right time, I didn&#39;t the last two years.

As I walked past the tree Wednesday afternoon &mdash; or was it Tuesday? &mdash; I looked at the stockings on the tree, saw one for a &quot;Boy Age 7,&quot; and took it. My week had been overwhelming to some extent, and the thought of helping someone who needed help I saw as a way of balancing the karmic scales.

(Yes, <a href=""https://libcom.org/library/starvation-army-twelve-reasons-reject-salvation-army"">the Salvation Army sucks</a>, and there are sound reasons for never, ever associating with them, but there&#39;s also a seven year-old boy who needs something for Christmas. I can overlook the Salvation Army&#39;s problematic aspects if I can use them to help a person.)

Unlike three years ago, where I had a hang tag that had a short want list and clothing sizes, all I had to go on this year was &quot;Boy Age 7.&quot; I then got some clarification from Human Resources about whether or not I had to use the stocking; after all, <a href=""http://www.allyngibson.com/?p=6757"">three years ago I didn&#39;t</a>. I was told that I could put anything in whatever I wanted; the little bit to identify the recipient was all that was necessary, and it needed to be visible. I could work with that.<lj-cut>

Clothing was out &mdash; I had no idea what size to buy for, and I didn&#39;t want to take a chance of buying the wrong size. &quot;A gift receipt!&quot; you&#39;re thinking, and I considered that, but then I thought through the problem &mdash; would this child have an adult who able and willing to go to the store I bought the clothing from to exchange it? I sadly realized that wasn&#39;t an assumption I could make.

I settled on following the gameplan from three years ago &mdash; buy a bunch of small, inexpensive stuff, wrap it individually, then box it in a Diamond shipping box and wrap that.

Let&#39;s see what I did.

<img alt=""20151208_195057"" class=""aligncenter size-overhang wp-image-29656"" src=""http://www.allyngibson.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/20151208_195057-720x540.jpg"" />

That&#39;s the stuff, except for three things that I left on my coffee table, pre-wrapping.

<img alt=""20151208_195339"" class=""aligncenter size-overhang wp-image-29657"" src=""http://www.allyngibson.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/20151208_195339-720x540.jpg"" />

I decided early on that I wanted to get my Angel Tree recipient some coloring books. And I did &mdash; I found two at Ollie&#39;s Bargain Outlet that I thought would work. One was a Spider-Man coloring book, the other was a <i>Star Wars Rebels</i> coloring book. Coloring books require crayons, so I picked up a box of crayons at Big Lots Saturday night before the Nerd Prom.

<img alt=""20151208_200002"" class=""aligncenter size-overhang wp-image-29658"" src=""http://www.allyngibson.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/20151208_200002-720x540.jpg"" />

Also picked up at Big Lots on Saturday night, this set of <i>Batman</i>-themed Hot Wheels cars!

<img alt=""20151208_200951"" class=""aligncenter size-overhang wp-image-29659"" src=""http://www.allyngibson.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/20151208_200951-720x540.jpg"" />

Friday morning I stopped at Target before work to buy Coldplay&#39;s newest (and possibly final) album, <i>A Head Full of Dreams</i>. I saw this LEGO set and picked it up at the same time. (It also almost got put back when I couldn&#39;t find the Coldplay album. I <i>eventually</i> located it; even though it was release day, it had been banished to the back of an endcap. Thank you, Coldplay, for being there!)

<img alt=""20151208_202035"" class=""aligncenter size-overhang wp-image-29661"" src=""http://www.allyngibson.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/20151208_202035-720x540.jpg"" />

I thought my recipient needed puzzles. I bought three. One was a lenticular <i>Avengers</i> puzzle, and then I bought these two <i>Star Wars</i> puzzles.

<img alt=""20151208_202806"" class=""aligncenter size-overhang wp-image-29662"" src=""http://www.allyngibson.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/20151208_202806-720x540.jpg"" />

I wanted to give him a book of some sort, but I had no idea what to give him. (For Christmas when I was seven, my parents gave me a copy of Carl Sagan&#39;s <i>Cosmos</i>. The year before, so when I was six, or it may actually have been the year before, they gave me <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i>. These weren&#39;t helpful touchpoints.)

I saw this book, <i>The Peter Yarrow Songbook: Favorite Folk Songs</i>, at Ollie&#39;s, and I was instantly taken by it. It&#39;s a picture book, and two dozen classic folk songs are printed and illustrated. Plus, there&#39;s a CD of Peter Yarrow (the Peter of Peter, Paul, and Mary) performing the song. It, too, was the sort of thing my parents would have given me at that age.

Not pictured, I also bought a book on the Smurfs at Ollies. It was a cute introduction to the characters.

<img alt=""20151208_201723"" class=""aligncenter size-overhang wp-image-29660"" src=""http://www.allyngibson.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/20151208_201723-720x540.jpg"" />

This I pulled from my personal collection. Patrick Mconnell&#39;s <i>Mutts</i>, which chronicles the adventures of the cat Mooch and the dog Earl, is one of my favorite comic strips, and it would be the right speed for a seven year-old.

Not pictured, there was also a <i>Transformers</i> calendar that I bought at Dollar Tree. Also not pictured (and not wrapped, because there was no good way to wrap it) was the first issue of Titan Magazines&#39; <i>Star Wars Rebels</i> magazine; this was left on the giveaway table at the office a few weeks ago, and I decided to pass it on.

<img alt=""20151208_210057"" class=""aligncenter size-overhang wp-image-29663"" src=""http://www.allyngibson.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/20151208_210057-720x540.jpg"" />

And here&#39;s the resulting wrapped packages.

I then sat down and wrote out by hand a short letter from Santa Claus to the little boy about the important things in life. Then I discovered that I no longer have any idea how to write the word &quot;Santa&quot; in cursive. (I can do my signature. Otherwise, I&#39;ve forgotten cursive altogether.)

<img alt=""20151208_210323"" class=""aligncenter size-overhang wp-image-29664"" src=""http://www.allyngibson.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/20151208_210323-720x540.jpg"" />

I didn&#39;t have a lot of room left over, and I couldn&#39;t have fit anything else into the box even if I&#39;d wanted to.

<img alt=""20151208_211621"" class=""aligncenter size-overhang wp-image-29667"" src=""http://www.allyngibson.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/20151208_211621-720x540.jpg"" />

I taped up the box then wrapped it in <i>A Charlie Brown Christmas</i> paper that I <i>also</i> bought at Big Lots on Saturday night.

This morning I took the box into work, taped the necessary identifying materials to one side, and turned the package over to Human Resources.

There&#39;s stuff there that I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll enjoy. :)

I can&#39;t fix the world. Sometimes, in my darker moments, I&#39;m not even sure I can fix myself. I can make things better for one person, though, at least for one day. I&#39;ll count that as a win.

Merry Christmas, little boy. :)</lj-cut>"

"event","On Thursday, I took a vacation day and went to Washington, DC.  The Washington Nationals were having Pet Day &mdash; with a special ticket, you received a 2015 calendar of the Nationals players and their pets, you could participate in a pre-game petting zoo, and part of the cost of the ticket went to the local humane society.

""Why not?"" i said.  Why not, indeed, and last week I bought the special ticket.<lj-cut>

I left home the same time I would leave for work in the morning, a little past eight, and I stopped at the Barnes & Noble in Pikesville.  What I wanted was a copy of Andy Weir's <i>The Martian</i> (I could remember the title, but not the author, and had to walk around the Science Fiction section until I found it), and I also bought a copy of Doris Kearns Goodwin's <i>The Bully Pulpit</i>, her history of the relationship between Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft, off the bargain table.

While looking at the bargain racks, this is a conversation I had with myself when I saw that Barnes & Noble had published a <a href=""http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/le-morte-darthur-malory-sir-thomas/1122098122?ean=9781435145405"">leatherbound edition of Sir Thomas Malory's <i>Le Morte d'Arthur</i></a>.  As it was shrinkwrapped, I could handle it, but I couldn't look at it.

""I want it!""

""Why?  You have three copies of Malory at home.  One is the paperback you bought and read in college.  The second is an illustrated hardcover edition you bought ten years ago.  The third is the Oxford abridgement of the Winchester manuscript you bought last summer.  You don't need this.""

""It's leatherbound!  I want it!""

""No, you don't.""

""It might be illustrated!""

""It might not.  You don't need it.  You aren't buying it.""

""Look!  <a href=""http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/doctor-who-dan-abnett/1122310125?ean=9781849909808"">A leatherbound edition of two <i>Doctor Who</i> novels</a>!  <i>The Silent Stars Go By</i> and <i>Touched by an Angel</i>!  I want it!""

""Why?  You already own both boooks.  You already have two copies of <i>Touched by an Angel</i>.  <a href=""http://www.allyngibson.com/?page_id=5973"">You didn't even like it</a>.""

""But I want it.""

""You don't <i>need</i> it.  At best you'll clear space on the bookshelf for it, then wonder what you were thinking when you bought it the next time you move and have to either pack it or give it away.  You are not buying it.""

""You're no fun.""

Yes, I really do have conversations like this.

I took the Green Line into DC from the Greenbelt station (and I think this is the first time I ever had to pay to park at Greenbelt, but that's mainly a function of usually going to DC on the weekends or holidays), and hopped off at the Navy Archives stop.  It's a good stop; it puts you in the city behind the National Mall, and two blocks you're there.  It's also the site of the Navy Memorial and the Navy Museum.  And since it was my late grandfather's birthday, it was an appropriate place to be.

From there I went to the National Gallery of Art which, in recent years, has become my favorite of the Smithsonian museums.  I don't know how many times I've gone through the Dutch and Flemish collection over the last hemidecade, yet I make a point of walking through it every time I go.  There are paintings by Rembrandt and Van Dyke, and many of them are of people I remember from my college history classes.  For instance, this painting of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Stuart,_Duke_of_Gloucester"">Henry, Duke of Gloucester</a>, the youngest son of King Charles I.

There was an exhibition of homegoods from the Revolutionary and Early Nation periods.  I was particularly taken by this wall clock that featured an image of Perry's victory over the British on Lake Erie:

The museum's main exhibition was of the work of Gustave Caillebotte, one of the minor Impressionists.  That exhibition was rather cramped and the galleries were packed.

From there I went to the Museum of American History.  Though there hasn't been anything new displays there in what seems like a few years (one wing of the museum is under reconstruction), there was something interesting going on &mdash; <a href=""http://www.usafband.af.mil/ensembles/BandEnsembleBio.asp?EnsembleID=61"">Max Impact</a>, the Air Force's official rock band, was performing as part of a summer concert series at the museum.

I thought about going to Air & Space, but I didn't feel like waiting in the security line.  Instead, I walked about the Mall, much of which is under construction as they're resodding the grass and making other improvements.

From there I went down Pennsylvania Avenue in the direction of Congressional Cemetery.  I have ancestors that are buried there, and it's an interesting place to visit and explore.

This time I took a look at burial slabs (because I'm not sure what else to call them) from the 1810s to 1830s.  These slabs, basically, are like tombstones but placed horizontally across the grave instead of horizontally.  There are two things of note about these slabs.  The first is that while some rested directly on the ground, others were set atop pillars.  The second is that these slabs were inscribed with long, carved messages (which ran the entire length of the slab, usually about six feet) and, surprisingly given the age of the slabs, these messages were still readable.  (Headstones of a few decades later are usually weathered and worn to the point where they're no longer readable.)

I also did the usual things I do there &mdash; visit my great-great-grandfather's unmarked grave, visit John Philip Sousa's grave, visit the burial vaults, take a look at the cenotaphs designed by Benjamin Latrobe, that sort of thing.

<img src=""http://www.allyngibson.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/20150827_153807-1140x855.jpg"" alt=""20150827_153807"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto;"" class=""aligncenter size-full-width wp-image-29191"" alt=""20150827_153807"" />

The day was wearing on, and the gates for the petting zoo opened at 4:30, two and a half hours before the game.  Rather than make my way to Nationals Park directly, I went west along G Street which took me past <a href=""http://washingtonparish.org/"">Christ Episcopal Church</a>, an historic church which John Adams and Thomas Jefferson attended and of which John Philip Sousa was a member.  I also suspect, but could not prove, that my great-great-grandfather attended there; he and his family lived in the area and, despite its name, Congressional Cemetery was and still is affiliated with this church, which could be why he's buried there.

Unfortunately, the petting zoo was cancelled.

I had <i>so</i> been looking forward to the Pet Day Petting Zoo.  That, more than the Pet Day Calendar (which is nice, and I didn't notice anyone else with one), was why I bought the special Pet Day ticket for the game and took off a day from work to come down to DC.  A ""mental health day,"" I called it.

I live in an apartment complex that doesn't allow pets.  (I could move, but I'd leave Pennsylvania -- and my job -- entirely if I did.  A little move isn't worth it to me to just have a cat.)  The thought of baby goats and sheep and kittens and puppies made me happy.  And <a href=""http://www.allyngibson.com/?p=29179"">the previous forty-eight hours (Tuesday and Wednesday) were unsettling</a>; my old high school in West Virginia witnessed an armed hostage situation (which, thankfully, ended with no bloodshed) on Tuesday, and I don't need to mention what happened near Roanoke on Wednesday.  By Wednesday night, I felt the weight of psychic distress bearing down on me, and the petting zoo I was certain would be a welcome release.

Sadly, it wasn't to be.  The deejay in center field was not as exciting.

Things happen and plans fall through.  Let me be clear, I'm not blaming the Nationals for this <i>at all</i>; the reasons were almost certainly outside their control.  The best-laid plans sometimes just don't happen.  I know that.

That doesn't mean I didn't feel crushed.

Still, there was a baseball game to enjoy &mdash; the Nationals and the San Diego Padres.

I tried the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dc-sports-bog/wp/2015/04/01/nationals-park-will-feature-a-stadium-exclusive-sam-adams-anniversary-ipa/"">Samuel Adams Nats Anniversary IPA</a>.  I have to be honest, I wasn't a fan.  I don't enjoy IPAs a lot.  Give me a stout or a porter any day.  I also had a frozen margarita tube, so by the time of first pitch I wasn't feeling a lot of pain. ;)

<img src=""http://www.allyngibson.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/20150827_191426-1140x855.jpg"" alt=""20150827_191426"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto;"" class=""aligncenter size-full-width wp-image-29195"" alt=""20150827_191426"" />

As the game started, I took notes as I do.  I don't know how to fill out a scorecard, so I have a different notetaking system that works for me, which breaks the game down pitch by pitch.

The crowd continued to arrive into the third inning, and then around the seventh inning the crowd started to leave.  By the end of the game, there weren't many people left in my section; the last people in my row left in the top of the 8th.

<img src=""http://www.allyngibson.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/20150827_194107-1140x855.jpg"" alt=""20150827_194107"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto;"" class=""aligncenter size-full-width wp-image-29197"" alt=""20150827_194107"" />

The game was notable for the various defensive shifts the Nationals had to make due to injury.  Yunel Escobar was hit by a pitch and left the game, which shifted Anthony Rendon to third and brought in Danny Espinosa to play second.  Then when Michael Taylor ran into the outfield wall and banged his knee, Taylor was replaced by Bryce Harper in center, Jayson Werth moved from left to right, Epinosa moved to left, and Trea Turner came in to play second.

The Nationals won, 4-2.  Jonathan Papelbon came in for the save with a three run lead, walked the first batter, balked him to second, and gave up a ground ball single to bring in a run.  Then he got the final out, and it was time for Happy Handshakes!

After that, there's nothing to tell.  A short walk to the Navy Yards Metro station, a drive from Greenbelt back to York, and then to bed.

A good day was had.  It was a lovely day in the District, not too hot, not too humid.  I walked a lot, and I have lovely tan lines at my ankles.  I should do more days like this."

"event","I feel like I've cracked the problem of <i>Sherlock</i>'s ""His Last Vow.""

I wrote this at TrekBBS earlier.  And we have to go back about a decade, to another television series about a brilliant, drug-addicted man who could discern things simply from observation...

<lj-cut><i>House</i> pulled the trick at least twice of having what appeared to be an ordinary episode turn out to be the fevered hallucination of House.  I'm thinking in particular season 2's ""No Reason"" (the Moriarty episode) and season 5's ""Both Sides"" (House hallucinates that he slept with Cuddy while on a Vicodin high).

Could some (or all) of ""His Last Vow"" have been a hallucination on Sherlock's part?

Is it noteworthy that Sherlock was shot?  ""No Reason"" had House in a state of hallucination after he was shot, and given the derivation of House that might be significant.

Could everything after Mary shoots him be imagined?  Especially since Sherlock uses his mental powers to keep himself conscious?  (Is that what he told himself so that his perception of the narrative would continue?) Did Sherlock have to destroy an imagined enemy in his dreams, just as House did? (Which makes sense of why Sherlock was the one to pull the trigger; it's his hallucination, and he needs to be the one to take action to escape it.)  And are the final reveals actually Sherlock ""waking up"" from his hallucination?</lj-cut>

It's not perfect, but this would make sense of the situation.  And it would be Moffat paying tribute to the modern day series that paved the way for <i>Sherlock</i>.

Thoughts?  Yes?  No?  Maybe so?"

"event","Last night, either out of boredom or madness, I rewatched the pilot of <i>Reign</i> on The CW.  And it didn't irk me as much as it had on Thursday night, probably because I knew what to expect with the wild tonal shifts from costume drama to teen soap, sometimes in the same scene.

Mind you, I'm still not saying that it's <i>good</i>.  It's still undoubtedly aneurysm-causing for the historically sensitive among us.  And I'd have a difficult time recommending the series as it exists after one episode.

Idly, I found myself wondering if there were a multiyear plan for the series.  I went looking for my copy of Antonia Fraser's biography of Mary Queen of Scots and, unable to find it (I wonder if I got rid of it when I moved, since I culled my library by about a third), I turned to Will Durant's <i>The Story of Civilization</i>, specifically <i>The Age of Reason Begins</i>, to check some dates.  Given where the series starts, Mary and Francis will wed in a year, King Henry will die in two years, and Francis will die in three.  There you have it, the season finales for the the next three years.

A fourth season, set in Scotland, would be fascinating.  Mary would be nineteen, widowed, living in a country she hasn't see since she was five, thinking of herself as French and not Scottish, having to deal with John Knox and the Scottish Reformation, and caught up in the various dynastic plots on both sides of the English border.

I don't think <i>Reign</i> will get that far, though."

"event","<i>Reign</i>.  That was an unholy mess, wasn't it?

I expected something about as historically accurate as <i>The Tudors</i>, which is to say ""Not historically accurate at all.""  It was sumptuous to look at and slickly made, though it occasionally felt claustrophobic in terms of sets and cast, due no doubt to budgetary limitations.  And for the twenty minutes of the episode that played like a PG-13 <i>Tudors</i>, it held my interest and I thought it generally worked and had potential.

Those other twenty minutes?  Boy-crazy handmaidens?  A plucky heroine who defies the conventions of the times to assert her independence?  A broody and indecisive male lead?  An alt-rock soundtrack that has nothing to do with the era and everything to do with pushing emotional buttons?  In no sane world do those twenty minutes belong in the same program as the machinations of Catherine de Medici.

The tonal shifts would give an MPD sufferer whiplash.  I can imagine the elevator pitch for <i>Reign</i> -- ""A <i>Tudors</i>-esque historical drama for the CW audience"" -- and that's certainly what the first episode delivers.  The twenty minutes that had me going ""Whiskey tango foxtrot?!?"" hit that demographic square on the head, while the twenty minutes that I enjoyed no doubt baffled the CW demo.

I don't even want to imagine what my old history professor at Richmond, John Rilling, would think of <i>Reign</i>.  Probably give the man an aneurysm.

I'll stick with it for a few episodes.  Give me something to watch before <i>Elementary</i>.<p><br><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/link"">m.livejournal.com</a>.</i></span></p>"

I've been in a state of disbelief all day, for several reasons.

First, I really like that area of DC, and not just because the Nationals play there.  It's has a nice vibe, and if I could live there, I totally would.  (Yes, I'd even pick the Navy Yard neighborhood over Wrigleyville.)  The area used to be a dump, but it's gentrified nicely.

Second, my (late) best friend's father occasionally worked in the Navy offices there.  Interestingly enough, on 9-11 he was in meetings there when the plane struck the Pentagon &mdash; and his office was one of those struck by the plane.

Third, my great-grandfather was born in that neighborhood.  The family moved to Georgetown when he was a few months old, and his father is buried in Congressional Cemetery a few blocks away from the Navy Yard.  So I feel a familial connection to the area, even though all of these people died long before I was born.

In short, for various reasons, all of them somewhat distant when looked at dispassionately, I'm feeling somewhat stunned by today's events."

Over on TrekBBS, there was some discussion last night and today about <a href=""http://www.trekbbs.com/showthread.php?t=222295"">John Hurt&#8217;s tenure as the Doctor</a>.  A poster by the handle of Newspaper Taxi kicked it off:

<blockquote>I don&#8217;t really see a lot of people talk about the Hurt serials that ran from &#8217;01 to &#8217;05.  I really felt that the show took on a much darker tone during this period and I&#8217;m really shocked at some of the things that the guy we&#8217;re supposed to call &#8220;The Doctor&#8221; did. I mean &#8212; the Time War?  It made for one hell of a season finale and my favorite regeneration scene ever, but wow.  I had a hard time looking at him the same way afterwards.</blockquote>

I&#8217;m going to riff of some of what I wrote there.

As much as I love Paul McGann and Matt Smith, and even though it was the Bakers and Davison that I grew up watching, it&#8217;s John Hurt that is my Doctor.  There&#8217;s no shame in saying that.  I&#8217;ve always admired Hurt as an actor, and I&#8217;m sure that has something to do with it, but I think it&#8217;s more that Hurt&#8217;s era as the Doctor spoke to me.  His four years in the role were a serious attempt at grappling with and saying something about the present in a way that <i>Doctor Who</i> had never really done before.

In the late-90s, when I really started to get into online <i>Doctor Who</i> fandom, I didn&#8217;t think anything could be more controversial than Sylvester McCoy&#8217;s era.  That was probably the thing that shocked me the most about my early ventures into rec.arts.drwho; there were people out there, <i>Doctor Who</i> fans all, who absolutely, positively, no doubt about it, <i>hated</i> significant chunks of the show they claimed to love.  As much as McCoy&#8217;s era was slagged in retrospect, Hurt&#8217;s era was <i>reviled</i> in its time.  That wasn&#8217;t unique to <i>Doctor Who</i>; <i>Star Trek</i> fandom had the same thing at the same time with the online backlash to <i>Star Trek: Enterprise</i>.  My theory then, my theory now, is that the rise of the Internet and its widespread adoption in the first few years of the 21st-century helped give rise to what I call &#8220;hatedom.&#8221;  Fans who hated what they claimed to love were always there, but they had been marginalized over the years.  The Internet gave them a platform, USEnet and bulletin boards and blogs gave them a platform and a megaphone, and people saw that it was acceptible to not just dislike the program but actively <i>hate</i> it.  Hurt&#8217;s era had the misfortune of coming along at precisely that moment in time.

What I usually say to people who say that those four years &#8220;are&#8217;t <i>Doctor Who</i>&#8221; is this.

You need to look at John Hurt&#8217;s four years in the context of the times.  Look at what was going on in the world in early 2001 when McGann&#8217;s departure was announced as John Hurt was cast.  The world was at peace.  The economy had taken a dip after Bush&#8217;s election but it was starting to rebound.  Frankly, early 2001 was a good time to be alive and it looked like things were going to be mellow.  The first half of John Hurt&#8217;s first season, which would have been planned and written during the summer months of 2001, reflected that reality.

Unfortunately, Hurt made his debut as the Doctor on September 13th.  The world changed rather dramatically two days before.  And, midway through Hurt&#8217;s first season, <i>Doctor Who</i> began to reflect that.

It wasn&#8217;t until &#8220;The Sontaran Gambit&#8221;/&#8221;Sentinel of the Daleks&#8221; two-parter in February 2002 that we really began to see how <i>dark</i> <i>Doctor Who</i> could go.  Ironically, it wasn&#8217;t even Hurt&#8217;s Doctor that was dark.  It was what the Thals were doing in that two-parter that was so jaw-droppingly insane, and as appalled as the audience was by the revelations at the end, it was clear the Doctor was right there with them in their shock.  Clearly, it was a story written in reaction to the Afghanistan mission, but it really opened the door for where Hurt&#8217;s era would go with the Daleks taking the Sontaran clone banks for themselves and the revelation about the Dalek time machines.  <i>Doctor Who</i> was in new territory.  Midway through his first season, <i>Doctor Who</i> did something that it had never really done before &mdash; it became a series that, like <i>Star Trek</i> did back in the 1960s, reflected the present world and its concerns through sci-fi metaphors.  The Last Great Time War, a science fiction idea that should have been a natural for a time traveling series like <i>Doctor Who</i>, was a metaphor for the threat of terrorism; the Time Lords could no more guard themselves against an enemy who could travel through time than we could guard ourselves against a dedicated terrorist cell determined to destroy us.  The fanaticism of the Daleks, once a metaphor for Naziism, became the fanaticism of the Islamic jihadists.  What was so surprising about Hurt&#8217;s era in that regard is that, unlike <i>Star Trek</i>&#8216;s attempts at subtlety, <i>Doctor Who</i> foregrounded the metaphors and made them impossible to ignore.  Hurt&#8217;s <i>Who</i> was very much of its time, but that also made the series difficult for so many to love because it was such a break with the past.

Yet, Hurt&#8217;s era was not without its charms.  I loved the two-parter with Jamie McCrimmon set in Revolutionary-era, British-occupied New York.  Yes, it was clearly inspired by the New Adventures, with the Doctor and his former companion at odds with one another, but I didn&#8217;t mind because it was done very well and it had a spin on the concept that those NAs didn&#8217;t have.  As an old school <i>Doctor Who</i> fan, I kept hoping that Jamie would remember something, <i>anything</i> about his travels with the Doctor.  I liked that they didn&#8217;t go that way, though, and that Jamie never remembered, not even as he lay dying after taking a bullet to save his daughter and the Doctor from a mob, not that he would have recognized Hurt.

That story, of course, gave us Claire McCrimmon, one of the most delightful companions of recent memory.  Yes, she could have been a Victoria redux, but instead they treated her with more psychological depth than the series was capable of pre-1980s.  I liked the way her relationship with the Doctor developed, especially as she drew out the Doctor and came to understand who her father had been as a young man.  And who can forget the tragic consequences when she was captured by the Daleks and brought before the Emperor?  Her screams as she&#8217;s led off to the conversion chamber still haunt me.  That was another moment that, in my opinion, really broke this Doctor.

The other charming moment came early in Hurt&#8217;s first season, before the series changed direction in &#8220;The Sontaran Gambit.&#8221;  I&#8217;m still amazed that they did a Hartnell-esque pure historical.  Not even RTD or Moffat have had the testicular fortitude to do that.  The only word to describe &#8220;The Vinlanders&#8221; is &#8220;vintage.&#8221;  You look at that episode now, and you have to think they got lucky in their timing.  It hit screens right before <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> hit, so there was already this medievalist buzz in the air, and when FOX repeated it that summer they recut the trailer to be more <i>Lord of the Rings</i>-esque.  I won&#8217;t say that &#8220;The Vinlanders&#8221; is completely successful, but it was fun in a way that <i>Doctor Who</i> hadn&#8217;t been for a few years and wouldn&#8217;t be again until &#8220;Smith &#038; Jones.&#8221;

Ultimately, I view Hurt&#8217;s era as a reaction to the Bush/Blair failure in Iraq, and I see Hurt&#8217;s Doctor as a tragic hero.  Obviously, the writers in 2001, 2002, 2003 had no idea that Iraq would end in ashes, and the early stages of The Last Great Time War, especially in Hurt&#8217;s second season (2002-3), are unfailingly optimistic about the Time Lords&#8217; inevitable victory over the Daleks.  But as Iraq turned sour, and it was obvious by late 2003 that it had, the initiative shifted in The Last Great Time War and there was nothing inevitable about the triumph of the Time Lords.  You can see in Hurt&#8217;s Doctor the arc from true believer in the righteous cause to disillusioned warrior who has lost faith in his leaders.  You can see it most clearly in &#8220;The Tears of the Ten Thousand&#8221; when the Doctor confronts Romana and demands to know how many more worlds must burn because of a mistake, and Romana&#8217;s chilling response &#8212; &#8220;The mistake would be in not burning more&#8221; &#8212; is the point where the Doctor loses all faith in his cause.

Hurt&#8217;s era is uncomfortable viewing, because they were trying so hard to make something relevant to the era.  But Hurt&#8217;s era is also, in retrospect, difficult to watch simply because it hasn&#8217;t aged well.  The ambitions of the era didn&#8217;t match the budget, so these galaxy-spanning battles were as realistic as the Dalek army in &#8220;Planet of the Daleks.&#8221;  Even <i>Babylon 5</i>, with its budget issues, looked better than Hurt&#8217;s era.  The era that followed with Eccleston and Tennant also hasn&#8217;t aged particularly well &#8212; Eccleston&#8217;s season in particular is grounded firmly in 2005 pop culture, and its references have dated badly &#8212; but Hurt&#8217;s era looks cheap by comparison and its political undercurrents are no longer meaningful.

Hurt himself was great.  He brought the gravitas that you would expect from an actor of his calibre.  His four seasons, however, are very much of their time.  They lack timelessness.  Say what you will about Steven Moffat as writer, but as a producer he&#8217;s made his era timeless.

I would hope that in this 50th-anniversary year fandom can reevaluate John Hurt&#8217;s four years as the Last of the Time Lords.  I hope that Steven Moffat does Hurt&#8217;s Doctor justice in the anniversary special.  I suspect, though, that we&#8217;re still a decade away from the reevaluation and reappreciation of the era.  Another decade, and the children who watched Hurt&#8217;s Doctor every week will be adults, breaking into prose and television, some of them even working on <i>Doctor Who</i> in a professional capacity.  That&#8217;s what it will take, someone saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to do Hurt right.&#8221;

I&#8217;m glad to see John Hurt back this November.  He was my Doctor.<p><br><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/link"">m.livejournal.com</a>.</i></span></p>"

I am not a Nationals blogger.  Don't think of myself that way at all.  But I was also thrilled that someone else would think of me in that way.  Nationals blogger.

I have, however, made some fanposts at <a href=""http://www.federalbaseball.com/"">Federal Baseball</a>, the SB Nation website devoted to the Nationals this year.  Of those posts, two were promoted as ""Recommended Posts,"" and one more was promoted to the main story stream.  So, in regard, maybe I am a Nationals blogger.

My posts have been mainly about the Harrisburg Senators, the Nationals' AA minor league team in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

Yesterday I was distracted and unfocused, and I managed to get a fair bit done at the office.  Hopefully, today will be similar.

I say ""hopefully"" because, as I said, I'm running on fumes.

I woke up at 3 o'clock this morning and was unable to get back to sleep.

Then at 4, the baby upstairs started to scream.

"event","I have always been fascinated by World War I.

World War II has more things going for it &mdash; tank battles, bombing campaigns, the Normandy invasions, the Pacific theater &mdash; but World War I interests me more.  Perhaps it's the trenches.  Perhaps the poetry.  It may even be the futility and the waste.  I have no personal connection to World War I, though the barber in the town where I grew up was a drumboy in Pershing's army, yet I'm interested in the war all the same.

Several years ago, I learned that Paul Gross of <i>Due South</i> had written, directed, and starred a film about the war titled <i>Passchendaele</i> about the Canadian experience in the war.  If the film ever saw release in the United States, I never saw it, and though I looked occasionally online to price the DVD, it was never at a price that made sense for a blind buy.

Then on Saturday, at Wal-Mart, I found a collection of war films for five dollars, and among those films was <i>Passchendaele</i>.

<img src=""http://www.allyngibson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/passchendaele-small.jpg"" alt=""passchendaele-small"" align=""right"" width=""250"" height=""350"" />Gross stars as Sargeant Michael Dunne.  Following a harrowing attack by his squad on a German machine gun nest, Dunne is invalided home to Calgary where he is tended to by an attractive nurse, Sarah Mann (Caroline Dhavernas), and assigned to a recruiting detail headed up by a Boer War veteran who believes that Dunne, who has been diagnosed with neurasthenia due to his experiences in France, is a coward.  As Dunne readjusts to life on the homefront, he also develops a relationship with Sarah.  Meanwhile, Sarah's brother David, an eighteen year-old asthmatic, wants to enlist to impress his girlfriend's father, the town doctor, but when Dunne refuses to take him on medical reasons, Dunne's superior takes him anyway, and Dunne reenlists under a false name so he can be sent to France and look after David.  There, Dunne's fake identity is blown and he and David take part in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Passchendaele"">the Third Battle of Ypres</a>.

I liked the film.  It was visually impressive and directed well.  The battle at Passchendaele (the last half hour of the film, roughly) compares favorably with the opening half hour of <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>.  There were strong performances from Gross and Dhavernas.  There are haunting images, and the ending is powerful and moving.

However, the film is not perfect, and it has a number of flaws.

Spoilers, naturally.

<i>Passchendaele</i> is basically two films.  There's a romance.  And then there's a war movie.  The links between these two movies depend a lot on coincidence.  I know that for artistic reasons all the plots are going to converge at Passchendaele because it would be a cheat to the audience if they didn't.  However, it's entirely too coincidental that the major characters all arrive in that place through their different paths.

Plus, there are narrative threads that lead nowhere.  Some even defy all logic.

Take, for instance, Dunne's invaliding home.  That's not quite accurate.  Dunne was injured in the attack on the machine gun nest, yes.  He was awarded a distinguished valor medal for it, yes.  But he also went AWOL, and when we see him in Calgary he's been sent there to recuperate following his capture while the Army decides where he's going to be executed for desertion.  Instead, the Army assigns him to recruitment detail.  The whole desertion angle is an unnecessary plot complication because it doesn't affect anything.  Dunne's superior in Calgary would still think that Dunne was a coward whether or not he had deserted; other scenes make it clear that his experiences in the Boer War simply have no analogue in the trenches of the Western Front that Dunne has experienced.

Next, Nurse Sarah Mann is a morphine addict, and she steals morphine from the Army hospital in Calgary.  I'm not sure why this was necessary, except that it then gave us a detox sequence later in the film when Dunne helps her break the habit, because it doesn't lead to anything.  It shows us that Sarah is broken, but she tells Dunne that she's broken, and we learn another reason for her brokenness, a reason that her brother shares.

Which leads us to Sarah and David's father.  We learn that he was a soldier in the Canadian Corps and died in the fighting at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimy_ridge"">Vimy Ridge</a>.  David feels that he can't live up to his father's example because of his asthma, Sarah turns to morphine to deal with the pain.  But then we learn that their father isn't dead at all.  Instead, he was an immigrant from Austria, he defected to the German lines during the battle, and British Intelligence has learned that he's serving in the Kaiser's army.  Again, this is a plot complication that has no pay-off, unless the nameless German officer at the end of the film is meant to be Sarah and David's father, but if that's so then it's also not <i>clear</i>.

Finally, I don't understand why the recruiting officer pursued Dunne to France, unless it was so he could die a horrible death in a war he didn't understand.  (Which he does.)

I think you could edit these problems out and the film would be tighter and stronger for it.  <i>Passchendaele</i> doesn't need the desertion plot, it doesn't need the morphine plot.  The film could be stripped down to 95 minutes or so, and what you'd end up with would be a really good <i>Hallmark Hall of Fame</i> movie.  That's what <i>Passchendaele</i> feels like now, just with a little flab.

All of that said, I have no trouble recommending <i>Passchendaele</i>.  It's not perfect, but no film is.  You can tell that Paul Gross put a lot of passion into this film, and what he made is something that's engaging, entertaining, and ultimately moving.  <i>Passchendaele</i> is as much about the people who caught up in World War I as it is about the pointlessness and waste of the war.

"event","After last night's <i>Doctor Who</i>, the clamor for a spin-off series starring Madame Vastra, Jenny, and Strax the Sontaran has resumed.

We met these characters in the sixth season in ""A Good Man Goes to War.""  Vastra is a Silurian who was awoken from her aeons-long slumber in Victorian London and set herself up a consulting detective agency.  Jenny is Vastra's maid and lover.  Strax comes from the future where he was punished by the Doctor for the crimes of his clone batch and forced to give up his warrior ways and become a nurse.  Vastra is prim and formal.  Jenny is snarky and a badass with a sword.  Strax is dogmatically loyal but dim.  (He claims it's brain damage from being revived from death.  However, it appears that he's really just dim.)  Together, from their base of operations on Paternoster Row, they fight crime in the 1890s.

Last night's episode, ""The Crimson Horror,"" marked their third appearance on screen, and I believe that we're going to see them again in two weeks.  (I say ""on screen"" deliberately; there are several YouTube shorts with one or all of the characters, and there is also Justin Richards' novella <i><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Who-Devil-Smoke-ebook/dp/B00APKG5LI"">Devil in the Smoke</a></i> about them and their adventures.)

Fans have seen these characters multiple times.  Dan Starkey as Strax is a riot.  (Strax's interpretation of <a href=""https://t.co/5faxleyQ"">Christmas carols</a> is awesome, and Strax's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nZxShriR0Y"">Q&A with schoolchildren</a> is hilarious.)  Vastra and Jenny are an intriguing team.  So, spin-off?

Five years ago, the <i>Doctor Who</i> family had three shows on the air &mdash; the mothership <i>Doctor Who</i>, the adult-oriented <i>Torchwood</i>, and the kid-friendly <i>The Sarah Jane Adventures</i>.  Today, there's only <i>Doctor Who</i>.  <i>Torchwood</i> ran aground on American cable, and the Lis Sladen passed away.  It seems like there's a gap, that the audience can and will support more <i>Doctor Who</i> product.

But what to fill that gap?

One possibility that both Alex Kingston (River Song) and John Barrowman (Captain Jack Harkness) have brought up is <a href=""http://www.digitalspy.com/british-tv/s7/doctor-who/news/a476433/doctor-who-john-barrowman-wants-captain-jack-river-song-spinoff.html"">a River Song/Captain Jack spin-off</a>.  I don't know if it's viable for a <i>series</i> &mdash; both actors are in demand and are working constantly &mdash; but a series of occasional one-off films would be fab.  I do know that I would watch the <i>hell</i> out of that. :)

Another possibility, this one mooted by fandom rather than by the actors or anyone connected to the series, as I mentioned at the top, is a Madame Vastra series.

Would it work?  Is it viable?

I'm not sure.

I'm not <i>opposed</i> to a spin-off with the Paternoster gang, but I don't see the point, and I think a lot of it would depend on the audience it was aimed at.  The BBC would have hard questions for <i>Madame Vastra</i>.  How does this enhance the <i>Doctor Who</i> brand?  How does this fit with the rest of the BBC?  How does this appeal to the mainstream audience?  For that matter, <i>who</i> is this series' audience?  Is it aimed at the <i>Sarah Jane</i> audience?  Or is it aimed at the <i>Torchwood</i> audience?  What audience does it serve that isn't being served <i>now</i>?  How you answer those questions will determine what kind of series you'll get and whether or not it will work.  With Strax you can go younger and goofy.  With Vastra and Jenny you can go older and darker.  But you have to decide, and because there's not actually a series on the table we can only make vague guesses and assumptions about what <i>Madame Vastra Investigates</i> would be.

From a fannish perspective, I can think of a half-dozen things that could be done with the concept.  Here's a big one &mdash; is the Torchwood of the era aware of Madame Vastra's activities?  Does the Captain Jack of that era ever cross paths with the Paternoster Gang?  (If you want to get <i>really</i> fannish, there's an amnesiac eighth Doctor living in that era, too.  What if <i>that</i> Doctor was the Doctor who saved Vastra originally?  Hmm, there's an idea...)  The problem is, once I get through the fannish ideas, what I'm left with is Sherlock Holmes or Sexton Blake but with different characters in <i>Doctor Who</i>-like stories, and my interest in the idea flags somewhat.  To some extent, that's down to the characters themselves; I like them, but I like them as supporting characters, though I will say that Justin Richards did good work in making them stand alone in <i>The Devil in the Smoke</i>.  But also, one of the problems I have with <i>Doctor Who</i> spin-offs is that they often feel like <i>Doctor Who</i> stories written without the Doctor.  <i>Torchwood</i> and <i>Sarah Jane</i> were at their best when they were doing things that <i>Doctor Who</i> couldn't do.  <i>Madame Vastra Investigates</i> would need to find those things as well, otherwise it's just <i>Doctor Who</i> in the 1890s without the Doctor.

The production issues are actually easier to solve than the narrative issues.  For a period piece, it could be done fairly economically.  For one thing, it could be filmed in Dublin on <i>Ripper Street</i>'s sets; the backlot exists, the wardrobe exists, so the BBC could use them and get more mileage out of the <i>Ripper Street</i> investment.  For another thing, I think BBC America would be far more interested in <i>Madame Vastra</i> than BBC1 would be; it's a niche idea aimed at <i>Doctor Who</i> fans that would also fit their ""Supernatural Saturdays,"" so they might be interested in financing some of the series through a coproduction deal.  But then you run into another problem &mdash; who would run this series?  Moffat would have to hand it off to someone else; he simply doesn't have the time, and his fandoms would be in open revolt if he tried and his other two series (<i>Doctor Who</i>, <i>Sherlock</i>) had longer hiatuses as a result of his workload on this new series.  Mark Gatiss would be a good choice (see his novel, <i>The Vesuvius Club</i>), but does he have the time and would he want to?  Since Moffat can't and if Gatiss won't, then who?  No, I don't know either.

Through all of this, I've been raising objections to the idea of <i>Madame Vastra Investigates</i>.  Unfortunately, I don't have any good arguments <i>for</i> the series.  The characters are cool, yes.  Done well it would be fun, yes.  There's room for more <i>Doctor Who</i>-esque product in the market, yes.  But those three <i>for</i> arguments aren't enough to greenlight a series.

To sum up, <i>Madame Vastra Investigates</i> could be done, but there are a lot of hurdles that need to be crossed and a lot of questions that need to be answered before it would ever happen.

I'm sure that we'll have another <i>Doctor Who</i> spin-off on our televisions.  It may be Madame Vastra.  It may be something we've never, ever considered.  The audience can support multiple series.  There simply needs to be the will on the part of the producers and the BBC for it to happen."

"event","The story of the 2 year-old girl in Kentucky, who was shot and killed by her 5 year-old brother with a rifle he was given as a present, has been preying on my mind much of the week. &nbsp;I think about the little girl, I imagine that just a few days ago she was a giggling, happy child who liked flowers and dresses and dolls and ice cream and now she's dead, and I get teary and I get angry and I get teary again and I cannot imagine how we can live in a world that thinks a five year-old boy, who probably still needs his mom to tie his shoes before he goes to kindergarten, is old enough and mature enough and responsible enough to have a gun.

Gun manufacturers are immune from negligence and wrongful death lawsuits. &nbsp;In 2005, the NRA, sensing that the gun industry would be the next Big Tobacco, prodded Congress to pass a law giving gun manufacturers immunity from lawsuits arising from the use and misuse of their products.

The two year-old girl's parents could be prosecuted, I suppose, for child endangerment. &nbsp;I don't know what value would come from that, to be honest. &nbsp;They had a two year-old daughter in their lives. &nbsp;She laughed at things. &nbsp;She doesn't laugh any more.

Mitt Romney said ""Corporations are people, my friend."" &nbsp;The Supreme Court said over a century ago that corporations are also people.

If corporations are people, then perhaps it's time we start to criminally prosecute the gun manufacturers for reckless endangerment, depraved indifference, accessory to murder, and so forth, when their products are used to make little girls not laugh any more. &nbsp;A gun manufacturer recklessly endangered a little girl's life. &nbsp;A gun manufacturer was indifferent to how their product would end a little girl's life. &nbsp;A gun manufacturer was an accessory to ending that little girl's life.

I don't know that it would make a difference. &nbsp;If these felony laws didn't codify that they referred to living, breathing human beings and not conceptual people as corporations are, they would be quickly changed if there were any chance, any chance at <i>all</i>, that a prosecution of a gun manufacturer for reckless endangerment would come close to succeeding.

A two year-old girl laughed at things. &nbsp;She doesn't laugh any more.

For her sake, I hope someone tries.

"event","Saturday, the <a href=""http://www.yorkrevolution.com/"">York Revolution</a> held their annual Fan Fest.

The York Revolution are the local professional baseball team, part of the Atlantic League, an independent league outside of organized baseball.  Players in the Atlantic League have, for want of a better term, ""washed out"" of the major leagues or their farm systems.  Some players may be looking for a shot to prove to scouts that they still have ""the stuff""; for these players, the Atlantic League is what NPR's Neal Conan called ""the last chance league"" in his book on the league, <i>Play By Play</i>.  Other players simply want to continue playing the game because they feel the competitive spirit.

The Fan Fest was a day where fans could meet and interact with the players and where the team could put on a party and an exhibition game for the community.

Since tickets were cheap &mdash; just five dollars for a day of baseball &mdash; I bought a ticket and went.

The day began with a concert by country music artist <a href=""http://maggierosemusic.com/"">Maggie Rose</a> in Brooks Robinson Plaza.  Country music is not my thing, as anyone who knows me knows, but she put on a nice show, the audience was certainly receptive, and she did a lovely job on the Star-Spangled Banner.

<img src=""http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/526491_10151604965915482_838317237_n.jpg"" style=""width: 60%; height: auto;"" border=""1"" class=""alignleft"" align=""left"" />There was a good crowd for the game, over three thousand people, according to Sunday's newspaper.

It was an enthusiastic crowd.  The ballplayers mingled with the crowd, having their pictures taken and signing autographs.  Inside the stadium's concourse there were vendors and auctions.  I tried the pretzel dogs from one of the vendors (very good), then went to the team store where I bought a baseball cap for myself (it's yellow) and a plush of the team's mascot Downtown for my niece.  Then I settled in to watch the game.

The game, by the way, was no ordinary game.  The York Revolution would be playing this day the Atlantic League Alumni All-Stars.  This was a team comprised of former Atlantic League players.  Not necessarily for York, there were players representing almost every team in the league's history.  These were players who were, in some cases, several years removed from the last professional game of their careers, and they were invited back for this one game.  Their skills were rusty, the easy teamwork wasn't always there, but they gave it their best.

Their best was... okay.

I'm hesitant to criticize the play of the Atlantic League Alumni All-Stars because it would be churlish to do so.  <a href=""http://yorkdispatch.mycapture.com/mycapture/enlarge.asp?image=46779887&event=1638440&CategoryID=77538"">This team of fourteen</a> may not have been at the pinnacle of their careers, but even rusty they were far better ballplayers than I would ever have been.

The second inning was the roughest for the All-Stars' starting pitcher, Wayne Franklin.  He had some difficulty finding the plate, he walked the bases full, he gave up a grand slam.  At one point I noted that York had scored 8 runs on only 3 hits; in addition to the walks Franklin gave up, the fielders behind him had committed three errors.

<img src=""http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/59709_10151604968355482_1274570780_n.jpg"" style=""width: 60%; height: auto;"" border=""1"" class=""alignright"" align=""right"" />Eventually, they simply ended the second inning.  The Revolution had plated seven runs in the inning, they had runners on second and third, and there was only one out on the board.  York's manager, Mike Mason, came out, talked to the umpire, and the inning was over.  On to the third we went.

After that, the game settled down.  York scored runs here and there.  The All-Stars warmed up pitchers, subbed in a few players, let other players try out different positions in the field.  Around the sixth inning, I went for a walk around the ballpark.  I wanted to see more of Sovereign Bank Stadium.  There was a playground area beyond the center field wall, and I walked behind the Arch Nemesis, the wall in left field that is six inches taller than the Green Monster in Fenway Park.

Going in to the top of the ninth, the score was 12-2.  The All-Stars sent three men to the plate.  Three quick outs were recorded.  The victory cannon fired.  The crowd began to leave.

And then.

York sent a man up to the plate to bat in the bottom of the ninth.  And the All-Stars ran out to take the field once more even though, by rights, York had the game won.

I realized what they'd done.  And I thought it was a lovely gesture.

For the purposes of this game, they treated the ninth inning as though the All-Stars were up by one or two runs, not down by ten. York batted last as if they were down, even though by rights they had the game won.  And the All-Stars, when the last out was recorded, celebrated on the field as if they had won.

I don't think the fans who stayed to the end quite understood.  There was a boy who sat behind me who asked one of the adults he was with why I was applauding for the Atlantic League Alumni All-Stars, and the adult replied, ""Well, maybe he's here for the other team.""  I wasn't, any more than I was there for the Revs; I don't know these players, I didn't live and die with them, but even this team of All-Stars needed someone to clap for them when they made a good play, when they struck out a batter, when they drove in a run.  It was respect as much as it was appreciation.  And an acknowledgement of their dreams.

One last moment of glory, one last moment in the sun for a group of ballplayers who had big dreams of playing baseball and whose pursuit of those dreams led them to, as Neal Conan put it in <i>Play By Play</i>, this ""last chance league.""

Good on them.

"event","The news has broken on casting for November's <i>Doctor Who</i> anniversary special &mdash; in addition to John Hurt, <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21980892"">the special will also guest star David Tennant and Billie Piper</a>.

Fandom, naturally, is sharply divided.

There is wailing that there's no Eccleston from the new series.  Classic <i>Doctor Who</i> fans are wailing that the pre-new series Doctors aren't represented.  ""<i>Doctor Who</i> is fifty years old!  Why is the special limiting itself to the last ten?""

There is wailing that it's Tennant.  ""We'll be treated to hyperactive gurning!""

There is wailing that it's Piper.  ""We'll be inflicted with wubby dubby Wose!""

And I can't entirely say that any of these wailings are wrong.  My immediate reaction to the news this morning was, ""Really?  No, really?  Really?""

You have to remember, I didn't really want a multi-Doctor story for the anniversary.  But if we had to have one, I wanted <a href=""http://www.allyngibson.net/?p=6714"">something that broke the mold</a>.

That said, I'm not opposed to David Tennant and Billie Piper in the anniversary special.  And if that's all the kisses to the past that appear, I believe there will be a reason for it.

Tennant in the special doesn't bother me.

First, in Steven Moffat's four scripts for the tenth Doctor (five if you count ""Time Crash""), he never wrote Tennant's Doctor aS the hyperactive caricature of fan memory.

Second, in the anniversary special, Tennant wouldn't be the lead Doctor, and he would have a new aspect of his character to play &mdash; how does he react to his future self?  How does he react when he confronted by a situation when he's not the smartest guy in the room?  ""Silence in the Library"" actually gives us a clue; the tenth Doctor is stupidly thick when it comes to River Song.

Nor does Piper in the special bother me.

First, I don't think Moffat will make the same mistake Russell T. Davies made in the fourth season where Davies thought that the emotional climax of the season rested with Rose, not Donna.  I don't expect that the climax of the Anniversary Special will revolve around Rose, basically.

Second, look at ""The Girl in the Fireplace.""  Moffat had no interest in writing the wubby dubby Wose.  Hell, it's even arguable that, based on ""The Empty Child"" and ""The Doctor Dances,"" Moffat had no interest in writing for Rose at all.

Thus, I'm not expecting a tenth Doctor/Rose-centric story for the Anniversary Special.  They will be in it.  They will do things.  But sixty minutes is not a lot of time, and he'll have to keep the incumbent Doctor central.

Moffat's not stupid.  He knows that 2006 is not where the series is today, and the audience today doesn't want to see a lost episode from that era to replace ""Fear Her.""

No, let's speculate on John Hurt.

Could he be Borusa?  The Doctor's father?  A pre-Hartnell Doctor?

Or maybe he's someone that the Doctor saved as a child from a [Insert Monster Here] in London 1963, and the Doctor has periodically checked in on the child as he grew into adulthood and old age.  Though that might be too derivative of Paul Cornell's short story, ""The Hopes and Fears of All the Years,"" a charming little story of the tenth Doctor and a boy named Tom.

Enough about the future!  There's new <i>Doctor Who</i> tonight.  Let's focus on that, and stop worrying about a special that's still eight months away. <img src=""http://www.allyngibson.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_dontpanic.gif"" alt="":h2g2:"" class=""wp-smiley"" /><p><br><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/link"">m.livejournal.com</a>.</i></span></p>"

Serious question time. Would Antonin Scalia's written decisions in the Prop 8 case and the DOMA case be eligible for the Hugo and Nebula Awards? These decisions will be so divorced from reality that they would be fantasy fiction, after all. And there would be a lot of worldbuilding in these decisions as Scalia tries to communicate to the world what's inside his mind. So could the science fiction community vote to put these on the ballot for their major awards? Could the science fiction community say, ""Hey, here's what we think of your so-called 'decision' -- it's such a piece of fantasy that we couldn't not nominate it so we could mock it""? These are thing things I wonder...

Yes, I would feel bad for the serious novelist whose work was left off the ballot so that Scalia's decision could be remembered forever as a Nebula Award nominee. But at the same time, Scalia's decision would be remembered forever as a Nebula Award nominee.<p><br><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/link"">m.livejournal.com</a>.</i></span></p>"

"event","The tenth anniversary of the Iraq War has been on the minds of many in the past two weeks.  Some who supported the war at the time have said that they were deeply wrong.  Some who supported the war at the time fail to recognize that it was a collosal, world historical mistake.

Last week I wrote an e-mail to <a href=""http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/"">Andrew Sullivan</a>.  He was one of those who supported the war in 2002 and 2003, and who turned against the war when it dragged on and the reasons for the war were shown to be nothing more than smoke and mirrors.

<a href="" 
http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2013/03/22/flies-collecting-on-a-wound/"">Sullian wrote</a>: ""In the summer of 2000, when I foolishly found myself wanting Al Gore to lose (Excelsior!), it was not a strong emotion. In the campaign, Gore was the advocate for a larger defense budget and [George W.] Bush was all about being a 'humble' nation. I figured there wasn't much difference between them (and I still think Gore would have launched the Iraq War as well).""

I have to ask.  What would the <i>causus belli</i> have been for Gore in this alternate history?
 
That's not an idle question.  I've seen others make the same argument -- that there would have been an Iraq War under President Gore (as I recall, <i>The American Prospect</i> ran an article on the very thing at the time) -- but no one ever stops to explain how they get from Point A (President Gore) to Point Z (Iraq War).  It's simply accepted.
 
But it's unlikely.
 
True, it's difficult to argue the counter-factual, Niall Ferguson's attempts to argue history by counter-factual be damned.  But there is evidence in the behaviors of the early Bush administration that led us to Iraq in 2003 that simply wouldn't have been present in a Gore administration.
 
Gore wouldn't have been surrounded at the highest levels of his administration with the Cheney/Rumsfeld/Wolfowitz cabal.  These players would have been at the same level as they were in the late Clinton administration when they sent Clinton a letter demanding military action in Iraq.  In other words, they would have been nothing more than pundits looking for an outlet for their aggressions.
 
Gore wouldn't have dismissed the plans developed by Clinton to retaliate against al-Qaeda after the USS Cole bombing.  Clinton had a plan drawn up.  The plan was given to the incoming Bush administration because Clinton did not want to gift his successor an ongoing military operation in the same way that he had been ""gifted"" Somalia by his predecessor.  The plan was subsequently dismissed by the Bush administration and never implemented.
 
Gore wouldn't have shifted the national security focus in early 2001 from terrorism to the Russians as Bush did.  Richard Clarke wouldn't have been shoved to the side as he was in the Bush administration, where counter-terrorism efforts were shunted aside in favor of nuclear missile defense and repudiating the ABM treaty.
 
Gore, if given a Presidential Daily Briefing titled ""Bin Laden determined to strike in US,"" would not have been likely to then tell his briefer that he had ""covered [his] ass.""  Gore had been through the first World Trade Center bombing as part of the Clinton administration.  Gore had first-hand knowledge that terrorism was the threat facing the country.
 
In short, Gore would have made vastly different decisions in the crucial months of early 2001.  I don't think it's too far to argue that a strike on al-Qaeda in early 2001 in retaliation for the Cole would have rattled the leadership.
 
I would even argue that 9/11 wouldn't have happened in a Gore administration.  I'm on shakier ground here, I admit, but a Gore administration would have kept the pressure on al-Qaeda instead of giving al-Qaeda room to breathe in those early months of 2001.
 
In my mind, <i>Bush v. Gore</i> proves Leibniz wrong.  We don't live in the best of all possible worlds.  A world without 9/11, a world with Afghanistan and Iraq is a better world, a far preferable world than this one.
 
I wonder if the five justices who installed Bush in the Oval Office with <i>Bush v. Gore</i>, especially Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy, have ever recognized that they have the blood of the last decade on their hands.
 
Somehow, I doubt it.<p><br><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/link"">m.livejournal.com</a>.</i></span></p>"

"event","To get to Shamrock Fest, I had to navigate a phalanx of Bible-thumpers.

<a href=""http://shamrockfest.com/"">Shamrock Fest</a> is an Irish and Celtic music festival held annually at RFK Stadium, and the organizers recommend that people take the DC Metro to reach the music festival.  You take the Blue or Orange line, disembark at the Stadium-Armory stop, climb the steps, and walk about two blocks to reach Shamrock Fest.  The past years, as you stepped off the Metro stairs and onto the street, you would be assaulted by street vendors hocking t-shirts, hats, sunglasses, all sorts of stuff St. Patrick's Day related.  My first year I bought a Dropkick Murphys t-shirt from the street vendors for about ten dollars.

This year, the street vendors were joined by a church.

There were people reading from the Bible.  There were people handing out tracts.  There were people preaching the evils of drinking and fornication.  Every few feet, you would be assailed on one side by a street vendor and his St. Patrick's Day wares, and on the other side by ""Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God.""

The dichotomy was amazing.  And amusing.  My probability of drinking was 100% (even at the brutal alcohol prices of Shamrock Fest), my probability of fornication, like my probability of buying anything from the street vendors, was 0%.

Of course, to reach the point of running the gauntlet I had to get to RFK.  And the trick there was in deciding what to wear.

It was snowing in Pennsylvania when I woke.  I checked the weather forecast for DC, and they were calling for mid-50s and a 70% chance of rain.  I would want something rainproof, then.  I opted for something heavier, a ski jacket I had picked up on clearance at Wal-Mart last month, because my other rainproof jacket isn't at all warm.

And, of course, I went as the Batman of Ireland.

<img src=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BFe4ls_CIAAKwE0.jpg"" style=""width: 100%; max-width: 100%; height: auto;"" border=""1"" />

Well, no, not really.  There isn't a Batman of Ireland in the Batmen of Many Nations and Batman, Inc.

Graphitti Designs sold a ""Celtic Batman Symbol"" t-shirt a few years ago.  And for inexplicable reasons (because I really don't need more t-shirts), I bought it.  The shirt seemed appropriate; I don't own anything green, and my only St. Patrick's Day-specific apparel are my St. Patrick's Day Chicago Cubs and Washington Nationals baseball caps.

Thus, I was outfitted.

I made better time than I thought I would, and I was through the gate at 1:30.

There were four bands I wanted to see.  In order, they were:
<ol><li><a href=""http://www.carbonleaf.com/"">Carbon Leaf</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.murderthestout.com/"">Murder the Stout</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.barleyjuice.com/"">Barleyjuice</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://themahones.ca/home.php"">The Mahones</a></li></ol>

Plus, I wanted to catch several other acts, like Baltimore's <a href=""http://gaelicmishap.com/"">Gaelic Mishap</a>.  But those were the main four.  However, Murder the Stout and Barleyjuice overlapped by half an hour, and The Mahones were closing out the festival and whether or not I saw them was going to depend on the weather and how I was feeling.

The band schedule didn't seem as packed as previous years, with several local-ish bands not on the schedule.

I caught bits of most of the Irish music sets, even though that meant a lot of walking from the Guinness Irish Village stage to the Miller Lite/Angry Orchard stages.  I saw none of the alt rock sets on the GoCity and Marathon stages.

The sun came out about two o'clock, and I'd say it reached the low 60s.  I took the jacket off and tied the arms around my waist.  It wasn't the <i>prettiest</i> looking way of wearing it, but it was easier than carrying it.  And when it started raining later and the temperature dropped, I put the jacket back on and didn't take it off.

The two sets I saw all of were Murder the Stout and Carbon Leaf.

I'm not sure when or how I heard of Murder the Stout, but I bought their self-titled 2006 CD (physical) and their new EP (digital) last year, and I was looking forward to seeing them.  I decided to skip most of the Barleyjuice set (since I've seen them several times now) to catch all of the Murder the Stout set, and I was glad I did.  At their merchandise table, they were selling a set of the new EP and frontman Hugh Morrison's CD, <i>Robbie Burns Rocks</i>, for ten dollars, so I picked up both.  The thing was, I wasn't sure if the EP I bought yesterday was the same thing as the EP I bought digitally last year.  I didn't know until I got home last night and was able to compare.  A little while later, after the Carbon Leaf set, Murder the Stout was hanging out at their merchandise table, and the entire band autographed the CD slipcase for me.

<img src=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BFkcXi8CEAASScy.jpg"" style=""width: 100%; max-width: 100%; height: auto;"" border=""1"" />

Silly me should have asked Hugh to autograph <i>Robbie Burns Rocks</i>.  Ah, hindsight.

After Murder the Stout, I went down to the Miller Lite/Angry Orchard stages and caught the end of the Barleyjuice set and found a good place for the Carbon Leaf set.  (These two stages were adjacent so that while one back was performing, another band could set up for their set on the other stage.  And one didn't really need to move to see both stages.)

Carbon Leaf is a band that I've followed since I was a student at the University of Richmond; they played a Kappa Alpha party in the autumn of 1997 (where I bought their first album, <i>Meander</i>), and they played the Cellar, the Richmond campus bar, about once a month (where their lead singer, Barry, gave me a copy of their second album, <i>Shadows in the Banquet Hall</i>, because I enthusiastically applauded their cover of John Denver's ""Country Roads"").  After I left Richmond, I didn't see them live again I moved to Raleigh and they played a free concert downtown after the release of their fifth studio album, <i>Indian Summer</i>.

Carbon Leaf's set was weighted toward their new album, <i>Ghost Dragon Attacks Castle</i>, plus they played old favorites like ""Life Less Ordinary"" from <i>Indian Summer</i>, ""Shine,"" ""The Boxer,"" and ""Desperation song"" from <i>Echo Echo</i> and ""Home"" and ""American Tale"" from <i>Ether-Electrified Porch Music</i>.  It was a tight and energetic set, and the audience was enthusiastic.  The sky clouded over during the set and it started to rain during ""Desperation Song"" (which was ironic, because there's a line in the song about ""will you stay through the pouring rain"").  There was crowd surfing and there was slam dancing in the crowd, two things that until I saw them last year I never, ever would have expected at a Carbon Leaf gig.

As I did last year, I bought a soundboard recording of the set on a USB stick from the band's merchandise table.  The sound mix could have been better balanced (the vocals are mixed down, while the drums and bass are mixed up), but it's a nice artifact to have. :)

After a beer, I wandered back down to the Miller Lite/Angry Orchard area, and I saw that the band was signing autographs.  While I didn't need any Carbon Leaf CDs, not even <i>Ghost Dragon</i> (I have one of the autographed limited editions the band sold through their website), I did ask them if they would autograph <i>Celtic Pink Ribbon II</i>, a compilation of Celtic-inspired music and bands that raises money for breast cancer awareness and cure.  And they did.  I high-fived guitarist Terry Clark.  I shook singer Barry Privett's hand.  It was a fun little moment.

<img src=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BFkc8KxCQAAmEz3.jpg"" style=""width: 100%; max-width: 100%; height: auto;"" border=""1"" />

And then I had my third and final beer of Shamrock Fest.  As I've mentioned in years past, at Shamrock Fest you buy beer tickets.  The first year I attended, beer tickets for four for twenty.  Last year and this year, they were three for twenty.  Yes, nearly seven dollars for a beer in a plastic cup.  On the plus side, that limits consumption; no one is going to want to spend forty dollars for six beers.  On the minus side, that also limits consumption; maybe I wanted four beers and not three.

Last year there were beer lines.  (That is, lines to get beer.)  This year, I didn't notice any.

Actually, this year I would say that attendence was down significantly from last year and the year before.  The weather didn't keep people away last year.  I don't know if the lack of a ""name"" band like Dropkick Murphys this year was a determining factor.  Or it could be the prices; prices on tickets ratchet up as the festival approaches, so what someone might do at $25 dollars will be out of their price range at $40.  Honestly, though, I don't know why attendence was down.  It just felt like a noticeably smaller crowd this year.

I watched a little of the next few acts &mdash; the <a href=""http://www.thescreamingorphans.com/"">Screaming Orphans</a> (an Irish four-piece who remind me of The Corrs), <a href=""http://www.celkilt.com/"">Celkilt</a> (a French band), and the <a href=""http://thefightingjamesons.com/"">Fighting Jamesons</a> (a Virginia-based Celtic rock band).

The sun went down during the Celkilt set.

<img src=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BFkdK55CEAAOtjx.jpg"" style=""width: 100%; max-width: 100%; height: auto;"" border=""1"" />

I did not, however, stay for the Mahones.

The rain stopped shortly after the Carbon Leaf set.  However, after the rain came high winds and plunging temperatures.  Even in the heavier ski jacket, I was <i>cold</i> and my feet and lower back hurt.  The sun had gone down, and I left at 7:30.

Like last year, I snagged the commemorative cup as I left.  People who buy the higher-priced VIP ticket receive a special plastic commemorative cup.  As the crowd thinned out, people left them behind.  Maybe they dropped them on the ground and didn't bother picking them up.  Maybe they tossed them in the garbage.  Maybe they got stomped on by the crowd in front of the stages.  In any case, they were there for the picking.  I only intended to pick up one.  I ended up taking home three.  And yes, I washed them thoroughly when I got home; total strangers had used two of them to drink.  (The second one I picked up, frankly, appeared not to have been used at all.)

I had a fun time.  I felt a little sunburned.

I'll go again next year. :)<p><br><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/link"">m.livejournal.com</a>.</i></span></p>"

"event","Sometime around three o'clock last night, thanks to a wellspring of activity from my upstairs neighbors, I woke in the middle of an utterly insane dream.

I was either watching or was a part of a David E. Kelley legal drama.

It starred Camryn Manheim, formerly of <i>The Practice</i>.  She had a much younger female associate who I really only remember as having long hair.  And Jimmy Smits was an opposing attorney.

The case that Manheim and her associate were involved with involved the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Prepuce"">Holy Prepuce</a>.  (Please.  Click that link.  It will blow your mind that there is/was such a thing.  Or that anyone <i>cared</i>.)

Basically, their client was being sued for fraud by Smits because the Holy Prepuce that he had apparently sold to someone was not the genuine article.

Their defense was mindblowing.

Of course the Holy Prepuce that was sold wasn't genuine, because everyone knows that the real Holy Prepuce ascended into the skies and became Saturn's rings.  They actually called a theologian to the stand to make that very argument &mdash; Saturn's rings come from the Holy Prepuce.  And Smits brought on an astronomer to testify that, no, Saturn's rings are ancient and have nothing to do with the relics of Jesus.

So then it became this whole astronomy-versus-theology thing.

And, of course, being a David E. Kelley series, Camryn Manheim and her associate successfully convinced a jury that no, there was no fraud involved in the sale of the Holy Prepuce.

Where do these ideas come from?  The story's fairly logical, when you stop to think about it, but why would I be dreaming about <i>that</i>?<p><br><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/link"">m.livejournal.com</a>.</i></span></p>"

"event","It's been too long since Carbon Leaf's last album.

How do you count their last album?  Their last release was 2011's <i>Live, Acoustic, and In Cinemascope!</i>, which, as you can tell from the title, is an acoustic live album.  <i>How the West Was One</i> and <i>Christmas Child</i>, both 2010, were longer than EPs but shorter than LPs.  I guess that makes 2009's <i>Nothing Rhymes With Woman</i> the last full length album.

Well, this week they released <i>Ghost Dragon Attacks Castle</i>.  They had announced another title for the album, ""The Lord of the Rings of the Trees,"" but this new album is that.

And it's very, very good.  I love it.

<i>Ghost Dragon</i> hearkens back to their earlier sound.  On Twitter I've seen it compared to their third album, <i>Ether-Electified Porch Music</i>, but I'm reminded far more of 2001's <i>Echo Echo</i>.  Either way, the album has more of a Celtic/folky feel and less of the alt-indie feel that recent albums have had.

Also this week, the band released <a href=""http://www.noisetrade.com/carbonleaf/the-noisetrade-sampler"">a free sampler</a> through NoiseTrade.  <i>The NoiseTrade Sampler</i> has 18 tracks &mdash; two from <i>Ghost Dragon</i>, <i>Echo Echo</i>'s ""The Boxer,"" a couple of tracks from <i>How the West Was One</i>, and a veritable slew of live tracks ranging from <i>Live, Acoustic</i> to rare, unreleased live cuts.  And it's free.

Did I mention that it's free? :)

Carbon Leaf is a band that's been a part of my life since college, quite literally.  The first time I saw them was at a KA party at the University of Richmond.  I bought their first album there, and the band actually gave me the second during a gig at The Cellar, Richmond's on campus bar.  In the last decade I've only seen them live three times (soon to be four &mdash; they're performing at Shamrock Fest next month).  I love the music.

And if you want to know where my short story ""Make-Believe"" came from, download the sampler &mdash; Carbon Leaf's song ""November (Make Believe)"" was an influence.

Give the sampler a try.  It's free, and you're sure to like it. :)

I'd argue that it's not; <i>Sherlock</i> gave CBS proof that the concept of ""Sherlock Holmes in the present day"" works, they tried to buy the concept from Steven Moffat, but CBS had also commissioned several scripts for a ""Sherlock Holmes in the present day"" series in the past decade that never made it to pilot.

Lucy Liu?  She plays an interesting character who happens to be named Watson and was a doctor, but otherwise she's not very Watsonesque.  The character is interesting, however.  There's backstory there, and I hope the series explores it.

New York City?  Sherlock Holmes always loved America.  Something like a quarter of the stories in the Canon have an American connection.

Sherlock Holmes himself?  I find Jonny Lee Miller's character recognizeable as Holmes.  The personality traits of Arthur Conan Doyle's character are there in Miller's portrayal.  He veers more toward the eccentric side of the character (like Robert Downey Jr.'s version in the Guy Ritchie films) and has better social skills than Benedict Cumberbatch's Holmes or Hugh Laurie's House.  Miller's Holmes is still an insensitive jerk, but in his default state he's not an outright asshole.

All of that said, I'm not going to get into a <i>Sherlock</i> vs. <i>Elementary</i> fight.  Such a fight honestly doesn't interest me. :)

However, the last few episodes of <i>Elementary</i> planted an interesting idea in my head.

It will never, ever happen, but I would <b>love</b> to see <i>Sherlock</i> and <i>Elementary</i> do a script swap.

Back in the 50s and 60s, American television was filled with westerns.  It wasn't unusual for a script for one series to be recycled and shot, largely unchanged, for an entirely different series.  Names would be changed, settings would be updated, the script would be made to fit the new series.  I don't know why westerns did this.  Maybe it was because the premises were similar.  Maybe it was for economic reasons, maybe it was cheaper to rewritng an existing script than to write a new script from the ground up.  Whatever the reason, I've always thought it was interesting that television scripts were swapped around in this way.

<i>Sherlock</i> and <i>Elementary</i> have similar premises &mdash; Sherlock Holmes is alive and active in the present day.  Their scripts would be ""swappable.""  The cities would have to be changed, obviously.  A <i>Sherlock</i> script would lose Lestrade and add Gregson as it made the trans-Atlantic crossing to <i>Elementary</i> and vice versa.  Some things wouldn't carry over, like Joan Watson's sober companion routine, and Lestrade's associates would be compressed down into Detective Bell most likely.  Scripts were swapped, they weren't <i>unchanged</i>.

Suffice it to say, I'd love to see Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman tackle, say, ""The Red Team"" on <i>Sherlock</i> or Jonny Lee Miller deal with ""A Scandal in Belgravia"" on <i>Elementary</i>.  Okay, maybe ""Belgravia"" wouldn't work on <i>Elementary</i> because the two series have divergent views on Irene Adler, but as I said, the scripts wouldn't be shot for the other series unchanged.  Cumberbatch would be able to play the character work that Miller is getting on <i>Elementary</i>, Liu would find new facets to Watson that she's not getting currently as a sober companion.

It won't happen, I know.  It's a silly idea, I freely admit it.

But my, wouldn't it be fun? :)<p><br><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/link"">m.livejournal.com</a>.</i></span></p>"

"event","Last night we started with Bates walking out of prison and ended with Robert, Matthew, and Tom walking into the sunset.  And in the two hours in between, there were headscratching moments, there were funny moments, there were touching moments, and there were stupid moments.  Sometimes all at the same time!  That's the way of <i>Downton Abbey</i>, it's a schizophrenic show.

Take Robert.  On the one hand, he's a fuddy-duddy stuck in the 1890s.  He wants the estate run in the same way that it's always been run (even though Murray and Matthew both point out that the estate has flirted with bankruptcy multiple times -- and would have been bankrupt again had Reggie Swire not conveniently died).  He thinks that Edith has nothing important she can (or should) contribute to society.  He's mocking of Tom's Catholicism.  And yet!  He's not only tolerant but outright accepting of Thomas' homosexuality.  One of these things is not like the others.  This season just hasn't been good for the Earl.  He's been hopelessly out of his depth ever since the start of the war.

And then there's Bates.  For the longest time this year, I was ready for Bates to swing from the gallows; the prison plotline was interminable.  I'm glad he's out of prison, but his sudden softening toward Thomas is uncharacteristic.  I could almost chalk it up to his odd sense of honor.  <i>Almost</i>.

The first hour is something of a blur in my memory.  Violet being a busybody.  Matthew trying to convince Robert of his course of action.  The christening shenanigans.  (Though I loved that final shot -- the clear look of distaste on the faces of the Earl and the Dowager Countess at having their picture taken with the Catholic priest was priceless.)  Alfred's misguided attempts at wooing Ivy.  It made no lasting impression.

The second hour was slightly more memorable, mainly because they added a new character -- the new cousin Rose -- but the plotting was frivolous.

An hour was built around the village cricket match.  Let me repeat that.  An hour was built around the village cricket match.  I think I speak for millions of Americans when I say that cricket is the most nonsensical sport ever created.  That's not to say that an hour built around the village cricket match can't work.  But for it to work it needs to feel <i>important</i>.  The world needs to hang on it.  Empires need to rise and fall on the swing of the wicket.  Instead, the cricket match seems to exist solely for the joke about Molesley, who talks up a big game, whiffing when his turn at bat comes up.  Wow, we wasted an hour for <i>that</i>.

But what else happened?  Matthew and Mary both went to see a fertility doctor in London.  It was obvious something was up with Matthew when he was vague about what he was going to do in London.  It was obvious something was up with Mary when she had a civil conversation with Edith about trying to keep Matthew from a particular train.  And then when Matthew asked the London doctor about whether or not his wife was a patient there, it became pretty obvious that, ohmigosh, Matthew and Mary are about to run into one another and discover that, oh!, they've been keeping secrets from each other.

That said, the meeting in the doctor's office then led to the one thing that this season has lacked -- quality Matthew/Mary time.  They are the heart of the series, and this season hasn't had them together enough in any quality way.  Yes, it's cute to see them in bed each episode telling each other how they feel, but I'm missing the fiery scenes of years past where they simply talk about stuff for long minutes.  <i>Downton</i> has lost that this year.  I hope it gets it back.

Then there's Rose.  I don't know what to make of this flighty firecracker of a flapper from Scotland (who doesn't sound at all Scottish).  Her best scene was by far the scene with Matthew where he told her how it was going to be -- married men who want affairs with younger women <i>always</i> have horrid wives, if she plays by the rules they'll keep her secret, she breaks the rules and all hell will break loose.

I thought about this scene near the end of the episode, when Edith went back to London to talk to her editor.  (By the way, I like Edith's moxy in taking steps to find out things about her editor.)  The editor tells her about his wife, the madwoman and the lunatic, and all I could think about was Matthew telling Rose that married men who want affairs always have horrid wives.  I fear that Edith is treading a familiar road to heartbreak.  I hope she doesn't get hurt.

Tom has grown up.  He took charge with his ne'er-do-well brother Kieran.  He offered advice on the management of the estate.  And he convinced Lord Grantham of the soundness of Matthew's plans for the estate better than Matthew could.

I hope we're finally done with Ethel.  I like the actress well enough -- I have a soft spot for redheads -- but her plotline this year has been appallingly boring.  Really, the best thing about it was its finale, with Violet forcing a solution to the problem and finally washing it away.

One more episode and then we have the wait of another year.  Next week, I'll have some thoughts on the season as a whole.

But rather than abolish the Electoral College to ensure that the national popular vote winner takes the presidency (or using the National Popular Vote compact to do the same without the laborious process of a Constitutional amendment), the reform that's in the air would all but guarantee that the national popular vote runner up would take the White House.

<a href=""http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2013/01/15/16527252-rnc-backs-radical-electoral-vote-schemes?lite"">More here</a>:

<blockquote>Republicans in a variety of states -- including Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Ohio -- have raised the prospect of changing the way their states' electoral votes are allocated in presidential elections. Instead of winner-take-all contests in which the candidate who wins the most votes in the state then wins that state's electoral haul, some in the GOP want district-by-district races.

That way, in a state like Wisconsin, President Obama can beat Mitt Romney by over 200,000 popular votes, but when it came time for the electoral college, Obama and Romney would split Wisconsin's electoral votes, five to five. Expand this to the national level and Obama would have finished 2012 with 5 million more popular votes than Romney, but Obama still would have lost the election thanks to gerrymandered districts.</blockquote>

<a href=""http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2013/01/gop_embraces_nuclear_gerrymandering.php"">And here</a>:

<blockquote>It wasn't so long ago, coming off a bruising presidential election, that Republicans were looking at ways to increase vote percentages among younger and minority voters to remain a contender in national elections.  But it appears professional Republicans have decided that's either impossible, unnecessary or perhaps just too hard. Because now they're going for another possibility: rig the electoral college to insure Republican presidential victories with a decreasing voter base.

In other words, nuclear gerrymandering. 

The plan is to game the electoral college to rig the system for Republicans. It works like this.  Because of big victories in the 2010 midterm -- and defending majorities in 2012 -- Republicans now enjoy complete control of a number of midwestern states that usually vote Democratic in national (and increasingly in senatorial) elections.  It may be temporary control but for now it's total. Use that unified control in states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania to change the system of electoral vote allocation from winner-take-all to proportional allotment.</blockquote>

People may not like the Electoral College, but they understand the rules -- win the state, win the state's Electoral votes.  This scheme would be rigging the rules in favor of the minority party, and I suspect that it would change the complexion of the 2016 race in ways that I'm not sure the GOP would be prepared for.
 
Let's suppose that the GOP rig the Electoral College so that even if Democrats win Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia it's a net negative for the Democratic candidate in the Electoral Collge because the Republican candidate will net out more Electoral votes from that state due to gerrymandering.
 
This means that the Democrats will <b>have</b> to make a play for states that they've written off since the turn of the century.  That means going hard for Texas, the south, the high plains, and the Rocky Mountains.
 
No, this strategy won't win 2016 for them; these areas are still very Red.  But it will lay the groundwork for the Democrats to win them in 2020 by building the local Democratic machinery and infusing these areas with Democratic ideas.  That's a long term thing -- and it may also cause states that were on the fence about the National Popular Vote compact to pass it.
 
If the GOP gain the presidency by losing the popular vote nationwide and specifically losing the popular vote in states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin while also winning a plurality of those states' Electoral votes, there would be a widespread sense that the GOP didn't play by the rules.  Even in 2000, there was a sense that Bush had won, albeit on a technicality.  This situation, however, would strike many as cheating, and the elected President would be seen by many as illegitimate.

As I pointed out <a href=""http://www.allyngibson.net/?p=1293"">here</a>, five years ago, this concept isn't bad, so long as every state does it and apportionment is done not by congressional district but by percentages so that the Electoral vote apportionment reflects the actual vote within the state.  But to implement this system only in states that have voted for the Democratic candidate and to apportion the votes along the partisan lines of the Congressional districts will invite electoral chaos and outrage."

I have two credit cards.  They are purely for emergency purposes, and I pay them off &mdash; when I have a balance on them &mdash; within two billing cycles if I don't pay them off immediately.  Either I pay in cash, or I do without &mdash; that's my philosophy.

"event","Last night <i>Downton Abbey</i> returned to PBS for a two hour season premiere.

Damn, I love that show.  It can be incredibly cheesy at times, it's not high drama, it wears its soap opera-ness on its sleeve; how to explain Matthew inheriting an insane fortune at the exact moment that Robert is ruined by bankruptcy?  Still, it's fun and it's addictive and I gobble it up like nothing else.

It's the characters.  I love the characters.

I adore Matthew, even if he's mind-bogglingly stupid at times.  Of <i>course</i> he can't accept that inheritance, because it would mean violating his own personal code of honor and he feels he must atone for breaking poor Livinia Swire's heart.  At the same time, he's unabashedly romantic, and I totally understand when he says that he'll never be happy with anyone else so long as Mary walks the Earth because my heart tells me that there's one person on this Earth for me.  Of course, we know that Matthew <i>will</i> take the inheritance, that he'll find a way to square the money with his morality, and it will probably take the Dowager Countess smacking him upside the head for it to happen.

Edith!  I <i>so</i> root for Edith's happiness, even though I know she's borderline pathetic and any happiness she has will be fleeting and/or tragic.  I cheer that she's found love and has become secretly engaged to Sir Anthony, but I know it won't last.  It never lasts for Edith.  Maybe she should take the advice Robert gave Mary last year &mdash; go to America, find a cowboy, and bring him back to Downton to shake things up.  No, what am I saying?  That's not Edith.

As for Bates, I feel like he's hiding something from Anna.  It's just a hunch.

"event","I have on my desk a composition book.

It dates to 2001.  There are things in it like notes from that year's Shore Leave, directions to my friend Jason's house in Arlington, notes from the Electronics Boutique vendor show in Las Vegas that year.  Random stuff.

It also has the first few pages of a <i>Star Trek</i> short story I wrote for the <i>Strange New Worlds</i> contest that year.  I remember the story, but I don't have the final draft any longer; it was lost thanks to a computer virus and I didn't have a back-up.

Here's how the first draft began:

<hr width=""70%"" />
""Memories of Tomorrow""

Looking out from his darkened cabin across the saucer, Jean-Luc Picard decided solitude suited him.  In the week since the <i>Enterprise</i>'s destruction on Veridian III and his crew's rescue by the <i>Farragut</i> Picard had remained secluded in his cabin save for one brief visit by Deanna Troi and Beverly Crusher which ended with him ordering them to leave after they had tried unsuccessfully to assess his mental state.  He had spent the five days since that obtrusive visit reading his antique edition of Shakespeare or studying the warp-smeared stars as they streaked past the <i>Farragut</i>, pondering the fate that lay in store for him, somewhere ahead, on Earth.

His reverie was broken by the unwelcome call of the door chime.  He ignored it, continuing his survey of the stars, his heads neatly clasped behind his back.  Twenty seconds later the door chimed again, and again Picard ignored its call, hoping that his visitor would realize Picard had no interest in receiving visitors and leave.  This hope, however, proved incorrect as the door chimed a third time, and with a sigh of resignation Picard said, ""Come.""

Picard did not turn from the window as he heard the doors swish open, his visitor enter, and the closing of the doors.  The room stayed silent for several moments, until Picard broke the silence by saying, ""Guina.""

Guinan came up beside him.  ""How did you know?""

He shrugged.  ""Any of the rest of the crew would have said something.""

""What about Data?"" she asked.  ""Surely he could have stood by, saying nothing.""

Picard shook his head.  ""His emotion chip gives him a propensity towards babbling.  He paused.  ""Only you could be content in silence.""

Guinan looked about the room.  ""Why keep the cabin so dark?""

Picard nodded towards the windows.  ""It makes it easier to see the stars.  To see what lies ahead.""

""For yourself?  Or for this ship?""

""For both.""  He paused, then continued when Guinan didn't press for an explanation.  ""Life is about moving forward, meeting one's destiny, and confronting it.  That destiny always lies ahead, for everyone.""

""Maybe,"" Guinan said.  ""But that assumes that life is a linear progression, from one point to the next.  You have personal experience that it's not.""

Picard turned to look at Guinan, the first time since she had entered his cabin.  ""You mean the Nexus?""

""What happened to you there?"" she asked, answering his question with a question.

""Don't you know?  You were there.""

Guinan nodded.  ""Partly.  But I am also here, much more real than that shadow-self that you encountered within the Nexus.  While that self may have been real to you, to me it exists more as a dream, and at best I get impressions of the Nexus from my other-self, not full-fledged experiences.""

""So,"" Picard said, ""you don't know about our encounter in the Nexus?""

Guinan shook her head.  ""I know it happened.  It know it was, for you, a decisive moment.  Beyond that, I have only fragmentary images, like shards of glass.  In time I might recall more, but even then those memories would be tinged with my own perspective, seen from the world I inhabited within the Nexus and not the world you created.""

""How can that be?  You were there, in my mansion, in my vision.  You were there.""

""No, you saw me there because that's where you were.  Not because I was there.""

Picard scowled.  ""But I saw Kirk's cabin, I saw his uncle's farm.  I didn't -- couldn't have -- imagined those.  They were his visions in the Nexus, not mine.""

""Jean-Luc,"" said Guinan, ""I don't understand the Nexus, perhaps I never will.  It's one of those things that should just be accepted.""  She paused and studied Picard's face for a moment.  ""You've given this some thought, haven't you?""

Picard nodded slowly.  ""I've wondered if all this --"" he gestured expansively ""--might only be another vision within the Nexus.  That I imagined you, that I imagined James Kirk, that I imagined leaving the Nexus and returning to Veridian III.  That everything I've experienced since entering the Nexus might be nothing more than another vision.""

""And if it is?""

""Then how can I ever be sure of anything?  Descartes' ancient dilemma of distinguishing dream from reality takes on new meaning, and if matters within the Nexus are merely dream within nested dream, the nothing is real.  Nothing can be real!""

<hr width=""70%"" />

Some of this sets my teeth on edge, and I had to fight my urge to fiddle with the text as I typed it up.  In my defense, this is a twelve-year-old handwritten draft.  I'm a vastly different writer now than I was then.  Notice I said <i>different</i>, I didn't say ""better."". ;)

Based on where this is in the composition book, I think it was written on the National Mall in mid-July 2001.  After Shore Leave I went to DC for a few days to visit with friends, one of whom was having a birthday.  My friend Jason and I went to see <i>Shrek</i> on that trip.  I also spent a day at the Smithsonian, and I remember sitting on a bench near the Castle watching the world and writing.

These six handwritten pages did not lead into the phildickian territory suggested by the final paragraphs.  Rather, it played out like the excretable <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i> episode ""Suspicions"" &mdash; Guinan quizzes Picard about what happened in the Nexus and on Veridian III, specifically why Picard decided to leave the Nexus to go back to Veridian III, and Picard reveals a secret, that due to ""All Good Things..."" he has memories of his future and he was trying to prevent Kirk's death.  But as a result of his attempt to change the events he ""remembered,"" Kirk died in a different way and the <i>Enterprise</i> was destroyed.  The idea, basically, was to offer some reasons why the future of ""All Good Things..."" didn't come to pass.

Obviously, ""Memories of Tomorrow"" didn't sell.  I never sold a story to <i>Strange New Worlds</i>.  Just as well. :)"

<blockquote>Won't happen, but I wish Bernard Cornwell would write a Doctor Who/Sharpe novel, preferably starring the eighth Doctor</blockquote>

In truth, the tweet wasn't <i>that</i> random; my commute read this week has been Cornwell's <i>Sharpe's Gold</i>.  Nor was it that odd; I like Cornwell's prose and find it very readable, except for some odd POV things that he occasionally does.

And while I wish that C.S. Forester were alive to write a <i>Doctor Who</i> meets Horatio Hornblower novel &mdash; or Patrick O'Brian a <i>Doctor Who</i> meets Jack Aubrey novel &mdash; I could be very happy with a novel with the Doctor and Richard Sharpe.

Why the eighth Doctor, though?  Ah, that one's easy.

While it's Sean Bean that most people think of when they think of Sharpe, assuming they've not read the novels, of course, Bean was not the actor originally cast as Sharpe.  No, that was Paul McGann, who unfortunately injured himself shortly after filming began.  Rather than hold up filming, the role was recast with Bean.

On that level, it would be a neat thing to have McGann in a Sharpe story. :)

Preferably without monsters.  <i>Doctor who</i> can do the pure historical.  Really, it can.<p><br><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/link"">m.livejournal.com</a>.</i></span></p>"

IDW Publishing
Written by Scott & David Tipton
Pencils by Gordon Purcell
Watercolors by J.K. Woodward

<img src=""http://www.allyngibson.net/graphics/stdw8.jpg"" height=""360"" width=""237"" class=""alignright"" align=""right"" />Ten months ago, IDW Publishing announced the comic book I'd waited most of my life to read &mdash; a <a href=""http://www.allyngibson.net/?p=6324""><i>Star Trek</i>/<i>Doctor Who</i> crossover</a>.  Yesterday, I read the eighth and final issue.

The best thing I can say?  The damn thing is over.

Oh, you're expecting me to say more than that.  I was hoping that would have sufficed.

When last we left our heroes, a Cyberfleet was en route to the Borg's space in the Delta Quadrant.  With the <i>Enterprise</i>-D in pursuit, a small group traveled to the Cybership in the Doctor's TARDIS.  There, Amy and Rory joined a security detail lead by Worf, who showed them how to use phasers, while the Doctor, joined by Picard and Data, went in search of the Cyberleader.  But the separate teams found themselves endangered by armies of Cybermen!

Which brings me to the final issue.

It's not very good.

It suffers from a frequent <i>Doctor Who</i> finale problem &mdash; the conclusion is achieved in the least interesting way possible, and everything you expect to happen does.  You expect the Doctor to confront the Cyberleader and outwit him.  You expect the Borg Conduit to turn on his seeming allies.  You expect a quiet denouement as the heroes say their farewells and return to their respective continuities.

But you also expect to be <i>surprised</i>.  And that's the thing that this issue &mdash; and <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>/<i>Doctor Who</i> &mdash; never achieved.  I never felt surprised.

Instead I felt disappointed.

The series did not end <i>exactly</i> <a href=""http://www.allyngibson.net/?p=6722"">the way I thought it would</a> six weeks ago, but I was pretty close in my guess.  The story tied into <i>Star Trek: First Contact</i>, but not in the way I expected it to.  And the Doctor had a different choice from the <i>Enterprise</i> crew for a possible TARDIS traveler than I guessed.  Still, it ended largely as I thought it would, and the previous issues had given me no reason to expect otherwise.

Yes, this is going to turn into more of a generalized litany of woe lodged against the series rather than a specific takedown of the final issue.  But if you're reading this, chances are you aren't interested in the final issue on its own, you really want to know what the story as a whole was like.

Which brings me back to, ""It's not very good.""

It's easy to guess what the elevator pitch for this series was &mdash; ""The TARDIS lands on the <i>Enterprise</i>, and the Doctor and Picard team up to fight their deadliest enemies!""  Conceptually, that should have worked.

The execution left much to be desired.

I don't know if the rumors of behind-the-scenes turmoil are true.  Personally, I doubt that Tony Lee's departure after issue #4 affected the series in any significant way as there would have been an outline that CBS and the BBC would have signed off on in the development process.  Plus, the series was already mediocre to that point, as I explained at length in <a href=""http://www.allyngibson.net/?p=6613"">my review of issue #4</a>.  In short, while there may have been lines of dialogue in the latter half that would have been written differently with Lee's input, I feel confident that we read the story that IDW set out to tell eight months ago.

The thing I I <i>do</i> know is that Scott and David Tipton had no grasp of what <i>Doctor Who</i> was or how its storytelling worked.  They treated the Doctor as if he were simply a guest star in a <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i> story, with Amy and Rory as unimportant associates.

<i>Doctor Who</i> is capable of being a <i>lot</i> of things.  The TARDIS and the <i>Enterprise</i> could easily have ended up at the same planet and the two casts could have been involved in the same adventure, much as we saw in the flashback sequence in issue #3.  However, it occurs to me the simplest way of handling the crossover (from a <i>Doctor Who</i> perspective) would be as a ""base under siege"" story, albeit one where the base (in this case, the <i>Enterprise</i>), is a mobile weapons and exploration platform.

However the merging of the two franchises was done for the purposes of the story, the Tiptons needed to find a way of integrating Amy and Rory into the story.  What they failed to recognize is that, in modern <i>Doctor Who</i>, the companions are as important as the Doctor.  They are expository characters, yes, but they're also characters that have emotional and narrative arcs that as just as significant as the Doctor's.  In this story, however, they had no role at all, much to its detriment.  Perhaps they could have been endangered as a catalyst for the Doctor's involvement.  (I thought early on that the Borg would have captured and assimilated Rory, and I was disappointed when it didn't happen.)  Or, there could have been a moment where Rory needed to use his medical skills; perhaps if the <i>Enterprise</i> were attacked Rory would have to assist in Sickbay as casualties came in, perhaps even bonding with an injured child aboard the ship.  But Amy needed to have a role as well.  Perhaps her natural tourist instincts, which got Team TARDIS in trouble in episodes like ""The Beast Below"" or ""The Vampires of Venice,"" would endanger the Doctor or the <i>Enterprise</i>.  Or perhaps she simply needed to be the Doctor's conscience and hold him back from a devastating decision.  But these things didn't happen.  Instead, Amy and Rory were nothing more than window dressing.  AS I said a long time ago, ""If this were the episode 'Sarek,' then Amy and Rory are as useful as Ki Mendrossen.""

However, the Tiptons' treatment of <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i> was no better.  They have the reputation of being IDW's ""good"" <i>Star Trek</i> writers, and based on things like <i>Klingons: Blood Will Tell</i> and <i>Mirror Images</i>, it's not an undeserved reputation.  Those are good series, and I recommend them both; the former is a look at <i>Star Trek</i> (in particular, several episodes of the original series) through Klingon eyes, while the latter is a story about the Kirk and Pike of the Mirror Universe.  When this series was announced, I wrote in a comment <a href=""http://www.allyngibson.net/?p=6324"">to a blog post I made</a> that ""Based on the Tiptons' previous <i>Star Trek</i> work, I have a hunch that this story could tread on some interesting psychological territory.""  It didn't.

That was the least of their <i>Star Trek</i> problems.  Psychological depth is nice, but more important is getting the characterizations right, which they consistently failed to do.  For a story that was ostensibly set during the fifth season of <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>, the characters behaved more like their older and more cynical movie-era counterparts, particularly Picard.  But throughout the series there were moments where the <i>Star Trek</i> regulars spoke or behaved oddly.  (A scene of Crusher and Troi with Amy and Rory midway through the series is perhaps the most egregious example.)  The Tiptons seemed not to ""get"" Picard and his crew.

Assuming that the Tiptons had been able to deal with all of this &mdash; better integration of the two universes, roles for Amy and Rory, characterization &mdash; they still needed to execute a good story.  They didn't.

First, I have no doubt that the eight issues will read well in a single sitting, and when IDW publishes a single-volume hardcover of the series next year I'll add it to my collection.  In single issues, however, this was a dire read.  It wasn't just that the pacing was languid.  It was that they failed to understand that an eight-part story needs seven cliffhangers.  At the end of every issue, the reader needed to say, ""Damn, what's going to happen next?""  There needed to be rising action, increasing tension, and unbelievable plot twists.  Instead, we got limp endings to most issues.  Putting the Doctor on the verge of meeting Guinan at the end of issue #3 is not a gripping cliffhanger.  Heck, it wouldn't even have sufficed for a commercial break.  This story &mdash; really, <i>any</i> multi-part story arc &mdash; needed to work as eight individual issues, and it didn't.

Second, just because <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i> was frequently a dull, talky television series, the comic book didn't need to be.  The story felt drawn out and stretched to no good effect.  In Bilbo Baggins' words, it was like too little butter spread across too much bread.  In the pages of <i>Doctor Who Magazine</i>, this story could have been told in a four-part comic strip of eight pages each.  More happens in ""The Iron Legion"" or ""The Flood"" than happens in <i>Assimilation2</i>.  Heck, I'd even argue that more happens in the single issue stories ""The Time of My Life"" or ""The Professor, the Queen, and the Bookshop"" than happened here.  <i>Assimilation2</i> was the Parkinson Principle applied to comic book writing &mdash; the narrative expanded to fill the space allotted.

Third, too much of the story relied upon exposition.  Even in the final issue, we had important points made through expository dialogue.  If it's not the Cyberleader explaining his plan or Riker talking about the best friend we never knew he had, it's the Doctor explaining how the TARDIS works or what will happen when the TARDIS leaves the <i>Star Trek</i> universe.  The problem is these characters are <i>do</i>ers.  They have ships, they go out and find information.  It shouldn't simply be handed to them.

Fourth, the story lacked a sense of jeopardy throughout.  The Borg-Cybermen alliance was never anything more than a conceptual threat, even in the final issue when the Doctor and Picard confront the oddly chatty Cyberleader.  I didn't feel like the characters were ever in danger or that they would have to sacrifice something to achieve victory.

<i>Star Trek: The Next Generation/Doctor Who: Assimilation<sup>2</sup></i> suffered from two failures &mdash; a conceptual failure and an execution failure.  I wanted to read this story for a long time.  I couldn't have imagined ten months ago that it would be so crushingly disappointing.  This story could have gone places and done amazing things.  Instead, it treated its concept &mdash; the union of two of the most famous science-fiction franchises into a single story &mdash; as a sufficient reason to be.  A disappointing series ended on a mediocre note, and I voted for <i>Assimilation2</i> in <a href=""http://www.bleedingcool.com/2012/12/16/most-disappointing-in-a-bad-way-comic-for-2012/"">Bleeding Cool's Most Disappointing (In A Bad Way) Comic For 2012 poll</a>.

The best thing I can say is that it's over.  That there should have been another way.  And that I sincerely hope nothing like this ever happens again."

"event","I mentioned a few days ago that I was putting together an Angel Tree package at the office.  I talked about that <a href=""http://www.allyngibson.net/?p=6752"">here</a>.

Tonight I finished wrapping the thing, and tomorrow I'm going to take it to the office.  MY work will be done.

The tag I picked off the tree was for a seven year-old boy.  He wanted LEGO, cars, and wrestling men.  The tag also indicated his clothing sizes.

I set myself a budget &mdash; 40 dollars.  I came in under that budget.

The hardest thing to find turned out to be the first thing I settled upon.  He wanted LEGO and cars, and I thought that Hasbro's KRE-O <i>Transformers Optimus Prime</i> (small size, not the big size) would be pretty cool.  It's knock-off LEGO, true, but it's also really well made.  I should know, I have one at the office; Optimus has teamed up with the Cybermen to oversee their conversion complex.  Anyway, it took some hunting to find this, which surprised me because it used to be everywhere.

<img src=""http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/479965_10151357047545482_2070350499_n.jpg"" style=""width: 400px; height: auto;"" />

I bought some more knock-off LEGO.  These Best-Lock car sets were two dollars each at Rite Aid.

<img src=""http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/300040_10151357047535482_82559804_n.jpg"" style=""width: 400px; height: auto;"" />

However, don't think he wasn't getting some real LEGO!  Target offered this LEGO <i>Batmobile</i> set for four dollars, and I picked up a Batman action figure, too.  Kids like Batman. :)

<img src=""http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/483436_10151357047655482_1552169443_n.jpg"" style=""width: 400px; height: auto;"" />

I also picked up some <i>Spider-Man</i> stuff &mdash; a puzzle and some flying discs &mdash; at Dollar Tree:

<img src=""http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/21652_10151357047730482_958999421_n.jpg"" style=""width: 400px; height: auto;"" />

He could use clothes, so I picked up two shirts at Target.  I don't know what colors work for him.  I picked colors I would wear.

<img src=""http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/320544_10151357047705482_642665397_n.jpg"" style=""width:400px; height: auto;"" />

And he could use some reading material, too!  I had two copies of this book for some reason.  I suspect I received one at the office for some reason or another.  In any event, he can give it a good home.  It's LEGO, it has a minifig, and it's vibrant and colorful.

<img src=""http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/68478_10151357047775482_2088691355_n.jpg"" style=""width: 400px; height: auto;"" />

I wrote a letter to the little boy from Julenissen, Norway's Christmas Gnome.  We know him as Santa Claus, of course.  It was fun to write, and Julenissen talks about a lot of things.  He doesn't live at the North Pole &mdash; there's nothing there but ice &mdash; but he and his Elves, Dwarves, and Gnomes do live in a mighty castle (Slott Julenissen) north of the Arctic Circle in northern Norway.  Julenissen had a lot to say, five pages worth!

Here's the pile of wrapped packages:

The package has been repacked:

There it is.  All wrapped and ready to go to the office tomorrow:

On Christmas morning, he'll unwrap the big box, open it, and discover lots of other things inside.

That's going to be awesome.  I hope he has a great Christmas.  And if he has little brothers and sisters, I hope he shares.  (Julenissen in his letter tells him he needs to share.)

There you have it &mdash; my first-ever Angel Tree package. :)"

"event","Every Christmas at work, the company puts up an Angel Tree.

This year, I took a tag off the tree.  It was the first time I had done so, as therein hangs a tale.

This is the first year that the company put an Angel Tree in ths sixth floor lobby.  In years previous, the Angel Tree went in the third floor lobby.  People who work on the sixth floor generally don't have to visit the third floor and vice versa.  While I was interested in doing the Angel Tree in years past, invariably by the time I knew the tree was up all the Angels had been taken.

This year they put Angel Trees on both the third <i>and</i> sixth floors.

Tally-ho!

I am shopping for a seven year-old boy.  The tag has his clothing sizes, and it tells me that he wants ""wrestling men"" and ""Legos"" (<i>sic</i>).

I considered putting it back last week when I found out that my housing situation is going to change <i>very</i> soon now, but then I thought about it and realized I was being selfish.

I've given this a lot of thought.

He's going to get a shirt.  I'm not sure what kind of shirt.  He's a kid.  Kids can use clothes.

He's going to get a book.  Don't worry, it's age appropriate.

He's going to get some LEGO-type stuff.  I hunted for the <i>KRE-O Transformers: Optimus Prime</i> set.  No, not the big one.  The one that goes for about ten dollars.  I have this myself (there are pictures of it on Facebook; Optimus Prime is working with the Cybermen), and it's a really nice set.  It's not LEGO, but it's just as good.  He's also going to get a LEGO Batmobile set I saw at Target.  It was about five dollars, it comes in a plastic bag.  Kids like Batman.

And he's going to get a letter from Santa Claus.

One of my favorite Tolkien books is <i>The Father Christmas Letters</i>.  It's a collection of the letters that Tolkien, writing as Father Christmas, sent to his children in the 1920s and 1930s.

I'm writing something in imitation of that.  I can't draw for toffee, so it's unlikely to be illustrated, but I did start writing it yesterday.  What I have isn't great &mdash; the idea is right, but the execution of the idea right now isn't there &mdash; but there's time to make it so.

The idea is this.  Every year, children write Santa Claus letters.  And every year, Santa writes a few special children letters in return.  This particular year, the Angel is receiving a letter.

I've had fun playing around with this.

I have to turn the package in on Thursday.  I plan to wrap each item individually, then put them all inside another box, then wrap that and slap the label on it.

That's the idea.

I'd best take another crack at that letter from Santa Claus.  Or, rather, Julenissen.  My Santa Claus is Norse and lives in Lapland. :)"

"event","This afternoon I went through a stack of fundraising appeals I've received in the mail in the last month.  When I go through my mail, if it's obviously a fundraiser from someone that I've not given money to in the past, the envelope goes unopened in a pile until the pile is twenty pieces high or so.

Today was ""clean up the pile"" day.

By that, I mean that I open the envelope, take a quick look to see who it's from and what they want (usually, the first paragraph of the letter is all the read it gets), and if there's something in the envelope &mdash; cards, notepads, nickels, mailing labels &mdash; that goes in a separate pile.  If the appeal interests me, it goes in one pile.  If it doesn't interest me at all, it goes in another pile of papers to be recycled.

I think I have enough mailing labels now to last the next five years.  I also have some interesting Christmas cards to use if I'm so inclined.

The only appeal that caught my interest?  It came from the Alzheimer's Association, Greater Maryland Chapter.

""Dear Mr. Gibson,"" the letter began, ""Can you imagine how emotionally difficult the holidays can be for people with Alzheimer's disease, and their families?""

The comma was unnecessary.  The whole letter is a grammatical nightmare.

But, yes, Cass Naugle, I can imagine.  I can imagine indeed what the holidays are like for those who suffer from dementia and whose who love and care for them.  And, to be frank, I really needed the rest of this letter seven years ago.  It would have been... helpful.

They're not asking for a lot, and I'll see about sending them a little spare money this week.

The rest of the fundraising appeals, however, are getting recycled.  Sorry, just the way it works."

Not because it returned me to Peter Jackson's version of Middle-Earth is awesomely spectacular fashion, but because there was something about the film and its narrative style that Jackson had managed to keep under wraps.

The film was a narratively nested puzzle box in a very meta way.

On the first level, there was the actuality of Bilbo Baggins' journey with Thorin Oakenshield's Company of Dwarves.

On the second level, there was the story that Bilbo told Frodo, both verbally and in the Red Book of Westmarch which differed slightly from the first level.

On the third level, there was a charming sequence with J.R.R. Tolkien telling the story to his children as a bedtime story which put the story in terms that children in the early 1930s would understand.

On the fourth level, there was a sequence with a group of teenagers playing a pen-and-paper role-playing game that riffed on <i>The Hobbit</i> which put the story in a more high-fantasy setting.

And on the fifth and final level, there was <i>The Hobbit</i> done as a 16-bit SNES-style RPG, and what we saw on screen actually morphed into a pixelated fantasy and then pulled back to show us someone playing the game on a television in their living room.

It was an incredibly brave film, I thought.  It was as much about the journey to Lonely Mountain as it was about the nature of storytelling and how it adapts to the teller, the listener, and the times in which they live.

It was a nice dream.  A much better dream than I had Thursday night about a friend who was having a nervous breakdown.

Of course, I know that the film won't be anything like that dream.  Well, I don't <i>actually</i> know &mdash; there's an outside chance that Jackson could do something like that &mdash; but it seems unlikely.  Peter Jackson doesn't make Charlie Kaufman films. :)"

"event","Were it not for Talking Points Memo, I wouldn't have known that <a href=""http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/11/fox-news-scariest-christmas-ever.php"">FOX News' war on the War on Christmas had begun</a>.  I guess if Black Friday can creep into Thursday, then the War on Christmas can creep into mid-November.

And what did I learn?

Atheists are attacking <i>A Charlie Brown Christmas</i> in an elementary school in Little Rock, Arkansas!

Several Google searches brought up <a href=""http://www.christianpost.com/news/merry-christmas-charlie-brown-at-center-of-elementary-school-controversy-85394/"">this article</a> which goes over the situation: ""an atheist group has complained about an elementary school's plans to take its students to see the production of 'Merry Christmas Charlie Brown' at a local church.""

<i>A Charlie Brown Christmas</i> isn't under attack at all.  Heck, a spokesman for the Arkansas Society of Freethinkers doesn't see any real problem with the production; he just thinks that if the school is going to have a field trip like that, then they should also teach the kids about other religions' holidays.  Even the mother who doesn't want her child to attend doesn't have a problem with <i>A Charlie Brown Christmas</i>; she just doesn't want her child singled out for taunting by classmates because the child won't attend.  In short, it's all just dumb.

This isn't a volley in the War on Christmas.  This is a volley in FOX's endless War on Common Sense.

The common sense solution is to allow the field trip, and then also have a field trip to a mosque or a syngogue in Little Rock in connection with some other religion's holiday.

The real victim in this situation?  <a href=""http://agape-church.org/"">Agape Church</a> of Little Rock.

Why are they the victim?  Because FOX News has alerted <i>Peanuts</i> Worldwide that their copyrights are being violated.

They don't license out <i>A Charlie Brown Christmas</i> for theatrical production.  From the <a href=""http://www.peanuts.com/faqs/"">FAQ page on Peanuts.com</a>, in answer to the question ""My theatre group would like to do <i>A Charlie Brown Christmas</i> this year. How can I go about obtaining the rights?"" they are vey specific: ""<b>We understand the interest in the community for <i>A Charlie Brown Christmas</i>, however at this time it is an animated special only; live theatrical rights are not available</b>.""

Have people staged <i>A Charlie Brown Christmas</i>?  Absolutely, a quick Google search will turn up church webpages, YouTube videos, and full scripts.  At a guess, these have all flown under the radar.

But now FOX News has held up Agape Church as a copyright violator.  In their zeal to fight the War on the War on Christmas, a church in Little Rock is in danger from lawyers and restraining orders thanks to FOX News' friendly fire.  FOX News has fragged one of their own.

Agape Church is the real victim here.

And I feel bad for them.

Good work, FOX News.

Now pardon me &mdash; this atheist needs to listen to the music from <i>A Charlie Brown Christmas</i>..."

"event","I stopped at Dollar Tree this afternoon.  I'd gone out to run some errands and to have my head shorn (which didn't happen &mdash; I didn't feel like waiting at any place I went &mdash; so I am still unshorn), and I paid a visit to Dollar Tree, which is usually a cheap place to pick up animal crackers.

They had a display of books at the front, and sometimes you can find interesting things there.  For example, they had a copy of J.R.R. Tolkien's <i>The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun</i>, which is the kind of thing you'd never expect to see at Dollar Tree.

They also had a copy of Levi Johnston's <i>Deer in the Headlights</i>.  Yes, the autobiography of Sarah Palin's former-almost-son-in-law.

True story.

I approached Johnston's then-attorney (who was also acting as his agent) about ghost-writing the book.

I had put together what I thought was a nice proposal.  I knew that people would be interested in the book because they wanted the dirt on Palin, but I thought there was a much more interesting angle to take &mdash; what's it like to be a small town kid in rural America from a broken home with a parent who can barely make ends meet who suddenly bursts onto the national stage in an unexpected and unwanted way?

They never got back to me, so I have no idea if they looked at any of the material I sent them.  Nor have I read the book, so I don't know what approach Johnston's ghostwriter took with the material.

No, I didn't pick up the book at Dollar Tree.  I truly don't care. :)"

"event","<b>Charlie Brown's Christmas Stocking</b>
Fantagraphics Books
Written and Illustrated by Charles Schulz

<img src=""http://www.allyngibson.net/graphics/stocking.jpg"" width=""250"" height=""254"" align=""right"" class=""alignright"" alt=""Charlie Brown's Christmas Stocking"" />While BOOM! Studios publishes new stories of the <i>Peanuts</i> gang in a monthly comic book and occasional graphic novel, Fantagraphics Books is reprinting Charles Schulz's classic comic strip in their <i>Complete Peanuts</i> hardcover collections.  This month, Fantagraphics released something unusual, a reprint of two things that I'd never even heard of before &mdash; <i>Charlie Brown's Christmas Stocking</i>.

<i>Charlie Brown's Christmas Stocking</i> is a slim, square, little book, running maybe 40 pages.  It reprints two stories published in magazines in the 1960s &mdash; ""Charlie Brown's Christmas Stocking"" (<i>Good Housekeeping</i>, December 1963) and ""A Christmas Story"" (<i>Woman's Day</i>, December 1968).

""Charlie Brown's Christmas Stocking"" is told in words and pictures &mdash; there's a page with a Schulz illustration, and on the opposite page there's a piece of untagged dialogue.  (In every case, it's obvious who is speaking on pages with multiple characters.)  Charlie Brown and his friends are trying to figure out where to put their Christmas stockings.  However, for Charlie Brown and Sally, it's especially difficult because their house has no chimney, nor anyplace obvious to hang a stocking.  Says Charlie Brown at one point, ""It's almost midnight&hellip;  Good grief!  I feel like the chairman of the board during an industrial crisis!""  That's an odd simile, even by <i>Peanuts</i>' standards.  Ultimately, the crisis is averted, and Christmas arrives.

The second story, ""A Christmas Story,"" reads more like the <i>Peanuts</i> comic strip.  Snoopy is lectured by Linus and Lucy about the true meaning of Christmas, and after hearing two stories he gives a literate punchline to the whole thing.  Though ""Charlie Brown's Christmas Story"" was created before <i>A Charlie Brown Christmas</i>, ""A Christmas Story"" was created after, and the story reflects moments from that animated special &mash; Linus reads to Snoopy from <i>Luke</i> while Lucy talks about Santa Claus and presents.

The artwork for these stories is vintage 1960s Schulz.  In addition to the characters mentioned above, we also have appearances by Schroeder, Frieda, Violet, and Shermy.  On a trivial note, Charlie Brown is wearing his red striped shirt instead of his yellow striped shirt.

It's a charming little piece of <i>Peanuts</i> ephemera, and Fantagraphics gives it a nice little presentation.  Though I think that calling these stories ""<i>Peanuts</i> holiday classics"" on the back cover <i>really</i> stretches the meaning of the word ""classics,"" it's a pleasant, if inessential, addition to a <i>Peanuts</i> library.  For the <i>Peanuts</i> fan in your life, <i>Charlie Brown's Christmas Stocking</i> will make a nice stocking stuffer this Christmas."

"event","My last panel at Philcon this weekend was on 50 years of <i>Doctor Who</i>.  It was a very good panel &mdash; it was mainly about why the series has lasted as long as it has, and there was also some good questions from the large audience.  (It was the best attended panel I experienced all weekend.)

At the end of the panel, a young woman up front asked a question of the five panelists &mdash; What did each of us want to see for the 50th-anniversary?

And I laid out my vision.

I want a multi-Doctor episode.  But I want one that breaks the mold, not one that brings back David Tennant and Colin Baker (in a girdle and a wig).

I want something smaller scale.

I want something that brings <i>Doctor Who</i> back to its beginnings.

I want to see the current Doctor meet the first Doctor.  Before ""An Unearthly Child.""  Before he even left Gallifrey.

And the actor that I could best see as a young first Doctor?

Benedict Cumberbatch.

I think a good story could be built from this premise.  Something in the present forces the Doctor to return to his beginnings.  And it avoids the fannish aspects that a multi-Doctor reunion special would entail.

It's what I want for the 50th-anniversary.

Hildy Silverman, one of the copanelists, then said that she had an idea (the Time War) but she really really wanted mine.

Will it happen?  Of course not.  It's what I want, however.

I want to see the Doctor meet his original self.  On Gallifrey.  Before his escape/exile.

I think it would be brilliant.

It's what I want."

"event","Tuesday's Election Day.

Thank goodness.  I feel a bit like <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/10/31/164030712/dear-little-girl-sorry-we-made-you-cry-about-bronco-bamma-and-mitt-romney"">Abigael Evans</a>; I, too, am ready for Bronco Bamma and Mitt Romney to go away.

I did not early vote.  The early voting locations and times weren't convenient to me.  I'll vote after work on Tuesday.  The subway train will get back at 7 o'clock, I drive past the polling place (which closes at 8 o'clock).  All will be good.

I have my sample ballot here.  Let's walk through it.

<b>President</b>
There are four choices &mdash; Obama (Democratic), Romney (Republican), Gary Johnson (Libertarian), and Jill Stein (Green).  There's also a list of roughly 20 write-in candidates I can choose from, including Virgil Goode (Constitution), Rocky Anderson (Justice), and that old standby, Santa Claus (Independent).

I'm leaning toward Jill Stein or Rocky Anderson.  I live in a non-battleground state, and two weeks ago Lawrence O'Donnell made <a href=""http://tv.msnbc.com/2012/10/24/candidates-talk-drugs-climate-indefinite-detention-at-third-party-debate/"">an impassioned plea for non-battlegrounders to vote their conscience</a>.  Maryland will safely cast its Electoral votes in favor of President Obama in December, so I can vote for whomever I wish, knowing that the realistic candidate I would rather see in the Oval Office will win the state.

Why not Gary Johnson?  If he ran on a platform of single payer universal health care, I'd consider him.  If he ran on a platform to end forced mediation in contract disputes, I'd consider him.  And if <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-25/the-presidential-candidate-who-would-destroy-the-economy.html"">he didn't want to nuke the economy</a>, I'd consider him.

<b>Senator</b>
There are four choices here, but in functional terms Ben Cardin is running unopposed.

<b>Representative</b>
There are three choices here, but in functional terms Dutch Ruppersberger is running unopposed.

<b>Judges</b>
I have no idea on these.  However, all three are running unopposed.

<b>Question 1</b>
Requires judges of the Orphans' Court for Prince George's County to be admitted to practice law in this State and be a member in good standing of the Maryland Bar.

I have no opinion on this.

<b>Question 2</b>
Requires judges of the Orphans' Court for Baltimore County to be admitted to practice law in this State and be a member in good standing of the Maryland Bar.

I have no opinion on this.

<b>Question 3</b>
Changes the point at which an elected official charged with certain crimes in automatically suspended or removed from office.

I'm for this.  Under current law, a convincted official can remain in office until all the appeals are final.

<b>Question 4</b>
The Maryland DREAM Act.

I'm for this.

<b>Question 5</b>
Establishes the boundaries for the State's eight United States Congressional districts based on recent census figures.

I really don't care on this one.  This ballot question is aimed at overturning the redistricting after the last census for a redo.  <a href=""http://www.capitalgazette.com/news/election/question-focuses-on-democratic-control-of-maryland/article_4c0cdacc-e579-5e0d-8445-7f7231264816.html"">Here's an analysis of what's at stake</a>, and while I understand it, I can't muster much enthusiasm.  Ideally, the state would redistrict on a non-partisan basis, but that's not how it's done, and overturning the map seems, to me anyway, like a pointless second whack at the apple.

<b>Question 6</b>
Same-sex marriage.

I'm voting in favor of this.

Here's a commercial that's playing a lot on television.  I like it:

<lj-embed id=""251""/>

<b>Question 7</b>
Authorize table games at Maryland's slots parlors, and allow the construction of a new casino in Prince George's County.

I'm voting against this.

Firstly, I voted against the original slots parlor question four years ago.  I'm simply being consistent.

Secondly, the pro-Question 7 advertising has decided to slam West Virginia, as seen in this commercial:

<lj-embed id=""252""/>

And I don't think you care about the three pages of bond ordinances.  I surely don't. :)

I was on a conference call with Obama for America on Friday, and they believe the signs favor them.  They even think that North Carolina is in play, and <a href=""http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/11/03/2460583/27-million.html"">early voting turnout there</a> definitely favors them.

I wonder if there are any election night parties going on I could attend.

It's been a long campaign.  When Wednesday comes, I'll be glad to see it done."

My schedule for next weekend looks like this...

<b>Friday, November 9</b>

<b><i>The Eye of Argon</i> Reading</b>
<i>Crystal Ballroom Three, 11:59pm</i>
<b>Panelists:</b> Oz Fontecchio (mod), Keith R.A. DeCandido, Allyn Gibson, Marvin Kaye, Kimberly Ann Kindya, Hildy Silverman
The audience competes with the panelists in Philcon's version of the reading of this <b>ahem</b> ""classic"" work of fantasy
<b>Notes:</b>  I've always wanted to do an <i>Eye of Argon</i> reading.  It's a bad piece of writing, on par with <i>Eragon</i>, come to think of it.

<b>Saturday, November 10</b>

<b><i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i> at 25</b>
<i>Crystal Ballroom Two, Noon</i>
<b>Panelists</b> Keith R.A. DeCandido (mod), Allyn Gibson, Glenn Hauman, Kimberly Ann Kindya
In 1987, Paramount Studios took the chance on creating a sequel to the original <i>Star Trek</i>, with a completely new cast, and distributing it as a syndicated show (something unheard of at the time).  Since then, it went on to become the most successful of the <i>Star Trek</i> shows.  We look back at <i>TNG</i>, and how it changed TV SF

<b>52 Shades of DC Comics &mdash; One Year Later</b>
<i>Plaza III, 6pm</i>
<b>Panelists:</b> F. Michael Yates (mod), Allyn Gibson, James Chambers, Glenn Hauman
Just over a year ago, DC comics rebooted their entire comic book line with ""The New 52."" Barbara Gordon is out of her wheelchair, Catwoman and Batman have a <b>ahem</b> more-than-professional relationship, and Earth-2 is back&hellip; again. Has it been a Boom or Bust? Or maybe a little bit of both.
 
<b>Has the Commercial Impact of Tolkien Harmed Fantasy?</b>
<i>Plaza V, 7pm</i>
<b>Panelists:</b> Ellen Asher (mod), Daniel Grotta, Michael Swanwick, Allyn Gibson, Sarah Hunter
You can not blame Tolkien for his imitators, but they are there, in endless ""McTrilogies"". Imitiation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but is this stifling the development of fantasy?

<b>Sunday, November 11</b>

<b>Extreme Alternate History</b>
<i>Plaza III, 11am</i>
<b>Panelists:</b> Allyn Gibson (mod), Michael F. Flynn, Sarah Hunter, Evelyn Leeper, Brian Thomas
Go beyond ""a different outcome for famous battles"" to other ways that history could have played out. Think how the world would really be different if something small and innocuous had occurred.
<b>Notes:</b>  I feel really unqualified to moderate this panel, yet I'll give it my best shot.  It occurs to me that things like the Beatles not breaking up or recording another album (which I blogged about <a href=""http://www.allyngibson.net/?p=1509"">here</a>) or the Beatles making a <i>Lord of the Rings</i> movie (which I blogged about <a href=""http://www.allyngibson.net/?p=5599"">here</a>) might count.
 
<b>50 Years of the Doctor</b>
<i>Crystal Ballroom Two, Noon</i>
<b>Panelists:</b> Patricia M. Cryan (mod), John Drew, Allyn Gibson, Hildy Silverman, Susan Toker, Andre Lieven
<i>Doctor Who</i> is the longest running and one of the most popular science fiction show on TV. Come explore 50 years of <i>Doctor Who</i> and its upcoming 50th anniversary in 2013.

There you have it, my Philcon 2012 schedule.

"event","Well, this is interesting.

<a href=""http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s7/doctor-who/news/a434488/doctor-who-star-matt-smith-open-to-sherlock-crossover.html"">Matt Smith is expressing an interest in a <i>Doctor Who</i>/<i>Sherlock</i> crossover</a>.

Though I'd much rather see John Munch turn up in an episode of <i>Doctor Who</i>, I have to admit that the idea of the Doctor and Sherlock Holmes crossing paths isn't a bad one.  With the Canonical Holmes, there's Patricia Bow's ""<a href=""http://home.golden.net/~thebows/story14.htm"">The Captive Sleuths</a>,"" Andy Lane's <i>All-Consuming Fire</i>, and probably more fanfic that you can shake a stick at.  And for <i>Sherlock</i>, there's probably <i>way</i> more fanfic than anyone could read in a lifetime.

And, Matt Smith himself says, ""I think Mark and Steven kind of hate the idea of <i>Doctor Who</i> and <i>Sherlock</i> ever meeting.""  <i>Doctor Who</i> inhabits a world where Daleks invade Earth every June or November, and really bad things happen every Chrsitmas Day.  <i>Sherlock</i> inhabits a world of ratiocinative powers.  The two worlds don't easily coexist.

Yet, if I were the one in charge of a <i>Doctor Who</i>/<i>Sherlock</i> crossover, I'd play up the vast differences, in an unexpected way.

I'd do two episodes, one <i>Who</i>, one <i>Sherlock</i>.

These separate episodes would overlap to some extent but never have the protagonists of each quite meet.  The Doctor would be involved in an adventure in modern day London with a guest cast in his episode, Sherlock would be involved in a mystery with the same guest cast in his episode, and if you watched them together you'd get the entire story, but if you watched them separately they would work entirely as <i>Sherlock</i> or <i>Doctor Who</i> stories.

Maybe the closest the protagonists come to meeting is when the TARDIS departs -- at the end of the <i>Doctor Who</i> episode, we see the TARDIS dematerialize and then Sherlock rounds a corner to see nothing, while the <i>Sherlock</i> episode gives us the same thing from Sherlock's perspective (because maybe he's tracking the Doctor's mysterious footprint of something).

I could see that kind of story appealing to Moffat -- it would be a puzzle, and Moffat loves his puzzles -- though it wouldn't satisfy the fans who want to see Smith and Benedict Cumberbatch chewing scenery together.

The puzzle thing doesn't mean I expect it to happen, though. :)

And I still want Munch on <i>Who</i>, dammit!"

Yes, when Maryland's governor asked people to stay off the roads &mdash; his exact words yesterday were ""We are urging all citizens to hunker down at home and stay off the roads tomorrow"" &mdash; I went to work.

I didn't have a choice.  The office didn't close today.

The drive home?  Also not terrible.  But not an experience I want to repeat any time soon.

Almost ten years ago I drove into Hurricane Isabel's stormfront.  (There were reasons for that.  I was flying back from Vegas, and the airline dumped me and my coworkers in Charlotte.  So we got a van, and I got to drive.)  That was <i>really</i> bad.

This was also really bad.

I get to repeat this tomorrow.  The office will be opening tomorrow morning.  At least, that's the plan.  I'm curious, though, because the eye of Hurricane Sandy is supposed to pass maybe twenty miles to the north of the office, so maybe it won't happen.

Time for another beer.

Yes, I too would like to know what Galileo said to the Elves.  The cosmology of Middle-Earth is fascinating.  Did making the world round when Numenor fell also cause the universe beyond Earth to come into being?  That's an argument you can make, because until the fall of Numenor the universe wasn't just geocentric.  Middle-Earth was all there <i>was</i>.  Even Venus didn't come into being until the end of the First Age, and even then Venus wasn't a planet.  It was Earendil and his Silmaril riding through the skies.

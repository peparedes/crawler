and the way it spoke to me
and the days it felt like
and ocean lived inside of me
the opposing tides
that formed a part of me
that roared and crashed
til I felt sure
my chest would burst
I miss the thrill
of diving in head first
of being swallowed whole
pushed and pulled
and weightless
caressed
by waves
standing up to an indomitable force
and looking over
the vast and endless
I miss feeling endless
unassailable and at peace
and the sting
of sun dried lips
and salt licked skin


I seem to be seriously lacking in productivity these past few days. The above was the best I could come up with as I was trying to write for a video I'm supposed to produce for class.

"event","&nbsp;here is an article I enjoyed more than I thought I would:<br /><br /><strong>J. CREW GETS ARTSIER</strong> By Roberta Smith<br />You never know when contemporary art is going to insinuate itself into a normally art-free zone. Last summer the blissfully mindless sanctuary of the J. Crew catalog was breached by photographs of the tall, suave painter Alex Katz in his studio, modeling J. Crew clothes.<br />Now the October J. Crew catalog has gone even further. Its menswear section includes pictures of seven New York artists wearing J. Crew shirts, sweaters and jackets and occasionally entire outfits, also in their studios, nearly all looking fabulously relaxed and rumpled.<br />Several generations are represented. At the young, relatively unknown end of the spectrum are the abstract painters Julien Smith and Chris Dorland. The mid-career slot is occupied by Ryan McGinness and Glenn Ligon. For artists of a certain age, we have the photographer Stephen Shore, the painter Billy Sullivan and the Conceptual pioneer Vito Acconci.<br />The biggest surprise is Mr. Acconci, a poet who became one of the stars of the late 1960s- early '70s Post-Minimalist underground, a generation that is generally revered in part because - except for Richard Serra and Brice Marden - most of them supposedly didn't make much money.<br />The irony is that much of Mr. Acconci's early work consists of dark, furtive photographs of him doing one weird, intensely personal thing or another, say, burning the hair off his chest and tucking his penis between his legs in an attempt to become a woman. In his famous 1971 performance titled &quot;Seedbed,&quot; he spent hours masturbating under the floor at the Sonnabend Gallery in Soho.<br />Now Mr. Acconci, looking unusually scrubbed and combed, is shown in jeans and a mini-check shirt, crouched down by a table, squinting at a macquette as if he were imagining the siting of the full scale sculpture.<br />There's always a weird rush when you see people you know from one context suddenly pop up in another, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. And it is becoming increasingly natural. All kinds of visual artists have appeared in Gap ads over the years. Artists have modeled clothes in magazine fashion spreads. Jasper Johns has played the Cowardly Lion in a reenactment of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; in Vogue. Furthermore, the last leader of the intact U.S.S.R. has lent his presence, comfortably cosseted in the back of a limousine, to ads for Louis Vuitton. After that, nothing should surprise.<br />Clearly we've come a long way since the early 1990s, when an emerging artist named Matthew Barney was excoriated for, among other things, having a J. Crew connection in his past. As a young nobody in the late 1980s, he had helped put himself through Yale working as a J. Crew model.<br />Artists are more a part of society than they were even in Mr. Barney's youth, and this is generally a good thing, especially for society. They are increasingly accepted as semi-ordinary people with potentially extraordinary contributions to make to our lives. Such acceptance has minor side effects, including appearances in J. Crew catalogs - not for money, but for fun, and probably a little publicity.<br />It would really be something if the creative types making these appearances weren't only men. To depart from the anonymous, impossibly thin, female ing&eacute;nues who populate J. Crew catalogs might help change more than just the way we see artists.<em>_NYTimes</em><br /><br /><br />My life is kind of complicated right now, it's the little things I enjoy.<br />oh! here is an assignment for the digital imaging class:<br /><a href=""http://www.idajoglar.com/SVA/animation.html"">www.idajoglar.com/SVA/animation.html</a><br />It's a dumb little animation excercise, but I had fun with it.<br /><br type=""_moz"" />"

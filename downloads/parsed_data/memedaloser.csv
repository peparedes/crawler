"event","LttlKoolKt:  :-D 
 MeMeBeanie:  :-) mones better 
 LttlKoolKt:  instead of saying weird now, im going to start calling ppl odd. becasue i have proven myself to be the only ""weird"" person in the world. and unless i say so, it wont change. 
 LttlKoolKt:  yes i have to admit that yours is better than mine 
 MeMeBeanie:  lol    
 LttlKoolKt:  only cuz u have darn blasted aol 
 MeMeBeanie:  hardie har    
 LttlKoolKt:  yesh yesh. you have your ONE moment of victory, but only one 
 LttlKoolKt:  the rest are mine 
 MeMeBeanie:  hmmm O:-) 
 LttlKoolKt:  O:-) 
 MeMeBeanie:  yesh but mine is the only one worth being right about    
 LttlKoolKt:  yesh i do have to admit. that is true 
 LttlKoolKt:  unfortunately 
 MeMeBeanie:  therefor i am more important and the one i am right about cancles out urs    
 MeMeBeanie:  lol    
 MeMeBeanie:  i luv how we r making up stupid things to be right about somthing and using big words to try to show up each other    
 LttlKoolKt:  yesh it does. but only for a while. cause see whiel you were enjoying your time in the spotlight and i was in the darkness. [but see you only thought i was in te darkness] i was running to the maintenece room to turn off your spot light and turn on mine. 
 LttlKoolKt:  yesh me too 
 LttlKoolKt:  its quite fun 
 LttlKoolKt:  it makes me feel smart 
 MeMeBeanie:  lol    
 MeMeBeanie:  but if ur in the maitnece room no one will see ur spotlight    
 LttlKoolKt:  lol ywesh 
 MeMeBeanie:  or u wont be in it    
 MeMeBeanie:  lol    
 LttlKoolKt:  but see my spot light is special and it only turns on when i have returned to the stage to enjoy it. while yours is stupid and retarded [quite like yourself] will not turn on and you have to go fix it which takes hours. unless by some miraculous happening mr. horsley, and his ""actually i invented the spotlights"" decides to drop by and see how wonderfully you are failing and helps you with your spotlight 
 MeMeBeanie:  but u just contridicted urslef    
 LttlKoolKt:  therefore AGAIN i have proven myself to bwe the best and the rightest about spotlights 
 LttlKoolKt:  how?? 
 MeMeBeanie:  cuz my spotlight was already on    
 LttlKoolKt:  but i turned it off and broke it 
 MeMeBeanie:  ah i see   
 LttlKoolKt:  yesh yesh 
 LttlKoolKt:  if you would kindly return to or earlier conversations of the spotlights you would see that i broke it somehow 
 MeMeBeanie:  well if some one of such low inteligence as urslef could break it then some as inteligent as mysle fcould fix it in half the time it took u to break it    
 MeMeBeanie:  i win    
 LttlKoolKt:  no give me some time to think about this one 
 MeMeBeanie:  ok    
 LttlKoolKt:  ill come back with something 
 LttlKoolKt:  well yesh that might be true if only you had half the intelligence of myself, because you see the only reason it got fixed is because i did not break it well enough because i was in a hurry 
 LttlKoolKt:  haha 
 LttlKoolKt:  i have returned 
 MeMeBeanie:  OK    
 LttlKoolKt:  yesh so you admit that i am the greatest in achieving being the rightest when it comes to spotlights 
 MeMeBeanie:  so then mine was fixed and im in the spot;ight and since mine was just maitneced its brighter    
 LttlKoolKt:  yes hyours migt just be brighter, but mine is multi-colored, which is so much better than being ""brighter"" 
 LttlKoolKt:  and it moves around and flashes all the colors all over the place which dazzles the crowds 
 MeMeBeanie:  well if yours is mutli colerd u can see me better cuz u look blue    
 MeMeBeanie:  and if it moves then its not only pn u    
 MeMeBeanie:  on u    
 MeMeBeanie:  therefore ppl like the spotlight more than u    
 MeMeBeanie:  and since its roatating it shines on me wich is when the crowd dgoes wild cuz i am under 2 spotlights    
 MeMeBeanie:  and i glow    
 LttlKoolKt:  yesh but thas the whole point of the thing. see i get your ppl intruiged by my spotlight, and then that lures them over to my part of the stage and then the spotlight stops and turns on its brightest lights on no one else but ME 
 MeMeBeanie:  however when it shines so bright on u u get to hot and start to not be able to see and walk off stage by accident and fall and get knocked out and they have no choice but to show it on me cuz the show must go on 
 MeMeBeanie:  see and now ur speechless cuz u knoe i win    
 LttlKoolKt:  yesh. they must go on with the show, but see i am soo superior and beautiful and wonderful and oh far too many great things that surpass you. and so therefore they just place me up on the stage under TWO count 'em TWO spotlights, because i am so great and far to special for only one spotlight. unlike yourself 
 LttlKoolKt:  and far to great and awesome to be left on the floor 
 MeMeBeanie:  but scince u r so great they would not want u to be hurt so as soon as u fall off the immediately call an abulance wich speeds u off to the hospital    
 MeMeBeanie:  so i am there to entertain the audiance    
 MeMeBeanie:  i win    
 LttlKoolKt:  but yesh they took me to the hospital because they didnt want me to be hurt. but by the time that i get out into the ambulance i have awoken and feel better than ever. so i return to entertain the people and they are so delighted when i re- enter the room that thety run from you and come join my in rejoicing of my return. 
 LttlKoolKt:  and no. you do not win 
 LttlKoolKt:  not yet 
 LttlKoolKt:  at least 
 MeMeBeanie:  but they wouldnt have let u leave the hospital w/o u getting a cat skan and scince u didnt they come back to get u and it takes hours for them to finish and by the time u get back the show is over and i was the one who finished it and being the nice person i am i give u a boquet of red roses that were given to me be an audiance member  
 LttlKoolKt:  oh no you have gotten it all wrong. i shall tell you the real way it went when i return, so ill brb. 
 MeMeBeanie:  okay    
 Auto response from LttlKoolKt:  melea dont think you have won yet. i shall be back. i jsut have to weasel and get something to drink to refresh my voice and and help me to move far more better than you. so therefore the ppl will be more delighted with my performance than with yours. 
 LttlKoolKt:  okay i have returned to show you up
 Auto response from MeMeBeanie:	caitlin dont think u won yet because of my absence to respond i just had to go walk (not wesal) my way downstairs to get me some food wich will rechage my brain making me once again smarter and whittier than you so when i get back i will win!  
 LttlKoolKt:  oh thats what you think, but your mind is weird and twisted and works in ways that are not allowable, maybe they should send you to a asylum 
 LttlKoolKt:  hah 
 LttlKoolKt:  are you done walking (not weasaling) downstairs yet. i would very much like to show you up now 
 MeMeBeanie:  lol    
 LttlKoolKt:  yesh so where were we? 
 MeMeBeanie:  idk    
 LttlKoolKt:  well lets see 
 LttlKoolKt:  i was just about to prove you wrong and become the greatest and rightest entertainer ever  
 MeMeBeanie:  thats debateable    
 LttlKoolKt:  no i dont htink so 
 MeMeBeanie:  everything is debateable except pure fact and since urs isnt cuz its pure opinion it is    
 MeMeBeanie:  debateable    
 LttlKoolKt:  its only an opinion of yours that my fact is not opinion. 
 MeMeBeanie:  a fact has to be proven and has to have some evidence to surport it    
 MeMeBeanie:  and since ur the only one who seems to think it    
 MeMeBeanie:  u lose    
 LttlKoolKt:  no 
 MeMeBeanie:  yes   
 LttlKoolKt:  i do not!!!! 
 MeMeBeanie:  you do to    
 LttlKoolKt:  no i dont. that is an opinion. not a fact 
 LttlKoolKt:  so hah 
 MeMeBeanie:  no because i proved you wrong and have to convo to surport it i do win and u do lose    
 LttlKoolKt:  yesh that MIGHT be true but only in this cas 
 LttlKoolKt:  case* 
 MeMeBeanie:  no it is true    
 LttlKoolKt:  in this story, but only this one. 
 MeMeBeanie:  okay w/e i still win    
 LttlKoolKt:  yesh but you just wait till next time

I know he was joking, but it just threw it in my face. I'm going to go to an AA meeting. Probably tonight. I want to be better. I haven't cried in so long, and now I'm crying all the time.

"event","holy shit its been almost a year since ive been on here. WELL. i moved in with jared...then fell out of love with him and started to like this guy john at work. added bonus: he's my neighbor. so i broke up with jared (after cheating on him with john just ONE night... :/ ) and kicked him out...now im seeing john everynight and having really good sex...every night. haha. for like the past three weeks. oh and i got promoted to pet care lead and then to support manager and now im supposed to be promoted to pet care manager. fucking awesome. im gonna be rakin in the dough. lol anyways the reason i wanted to come on here is i just HAD to record my current weight. once i got promoted to support manager i was so stressed i couldnt eat and i think my stomach just shrank...i was only eating fruit salads from publix. well i didnt weigh myself until recently and i was worried because johns been feeding me delicious home cooked meals lol. but i did it anyway last week....with my clothes and shoes on...and.......109.5! i was fucking ecstatic. i mean ive been doing my little ten minute workouts in the mornings but i havent been running or anything. i mean i smoke a pack a day. i can't do the cardio lol. then YESTERDAY i weighed myself again. now ive been eating johns food, had skipped a couple of days of working out and had just eaten a grilled cheese. you want to know how LITTLE i weigh?? just take a guess. no? ok. fucking 107.4!! i havent been below 110 let alone 109 probably since i was a freshman and didn't have any boobs. how fucking awesome is that. its like i dont have to try anymore. not that im going to stop trying lol. but yeah. things are really turning around. jared's gone, work is awesome, i'm not bingeing and purging too much (maybe once every two weeks if i have a bad day), and i weigh 107.4 and im gonna try to stop drinking (wine) starting today because i can't afford it anymore lol. but that should help too. and maybe ill try to cut back with the cigs and start running again. i just feel really good. it also helps -in a sick way- that people are telling me im too thin and that i need to put on five pounds lol. its awful but i love it anyway. but alright i think thats it..just wanted to put down that im happy for once as opposed to all the depressing suicidal shit on here. so yay for me! :)"

""I thought you were dead. In the whole world there was nothing beautiful.""


it's march 3, 2010, and jared and i have been dating again for almost five and a half months. i'm scared that i've settled for him again because i was so lonely. but i do love him. i love him so much and i know that i would be nothing without him. if he left me there is no doubt in my mind that i would kill myself. immediately. there would be nothing left to hope for. nothing to live for. so, maybe it is ""true love?"" or am i really that fucking messed up?"

i wish i was there
to pull your hair
make you scream
but its only in my dream
i would bend you over
and fuck you like rover

and your pussy is so tight
pulling your hair

"event","so i hung out with jared last night. he came over at 745 and we watched tv and talked. he talked a lot about the army. i told him i was scared for him and that i wished he wouldn't go. we went to the movies at 915 and saw district 9. at one point during the movie his hand was on his knee and i kept wishing he would put his hand on my leg. so i put my hand on my knee. he pulled his hand back. i almost started crying. i couldn't really pay attention to the rest of the movie. we left and everything was fine. as i was turning onto my street, i told him i had something to talk to him about. he said i was scaring him. he asked if i had a boyfriend. i said no and quickly blurted out what i had to tell him - about me realizing that night at his house that i still had feelings for him. that i missed him. that i was incredibly jealous of all the girls he'd been with and that it was driving me crazy. and most importantly, that i couldn't be his friend anymore. that it hurt too much. that's the only part he heard. he had tears in his eyes and said ill get my stuff and go. i told him to stop. he asked me, i can't see you anymore? i can't talk to you anymore? fine. i'll leave you alone. i didn't know what to say. we got out of the car and went to my room. as he was grabbing his stuff i said, ""do you understand what i'm trying to tell you?"" and he said no and came really close to me. i covered my face with my hands and said i still have feelings for you. i feel like i'm going crazy and i don't know what to do. i told you when we were dating that i was going to fuck it up. i told you not to let me fuck it up. he didn't really say anything. he asked if we could go outside so he could smoke. ok so there was a lot said the rest of the night and i don't really feel like writing it all but i'll try my best. so i was telling him how much i regret breaking up with him and its all my fault and all that. i was shaking and he was trying to comfort me. he asked me how this happened and i told him that when we broke up, i needed time for myself and after months of being completely self-absorbed i decided to change and thats when i started missing him. at one point he says what if i tell you something. i was so scared and of course i asked if he was with someone. he laughed and said its funny that its the first thing we ask eachother and i say well its the worst thing. and he was quiet and then he said, what if i told you that i still had feelings for you? and i couldn't really say anything so i kept shaking my head and i thought i was going to cry and i said i don't know what the fuck to do. he said something like now you know why i want to see you as much as i can before i have to leave. and he was trying to make the conversation lighter by making jokes and saying things like we have the worst timing when it comes to our relationship. i said why did you have to join the army? and he says its just something i have to do. i nodded. i told him that it actually hurts to know that he's with other girls, that i have panic attacks when i think about it. he said that he's always making me upset. he also said that it drove him crazy too to think about it. we went inside. i said i obviously still wanted to see him. he gave me a hug, but not just the one-armed crap hugs we've been giving eachother. a real hug. the first of many that night, lol. he sighed and said i missed your hugs. i love the sound of his heart. i kept saying what do we do. and he said just take it slow? hang out? he laughed and said your dad is going to kill me. he said sleep on it. it's late (it was like 12:30 now) walk me out. so we go down and frankie had to go to the bathroom so now we're both outside. we must've hugged like five more times lol. i told him that i was going to see a psychiatrist next week. he said maybe you should make it twice a week. ha fuck you. i said i needed to go running before i freaked out. usually when i was hugging him, i wrapped my arms around his waist. but the last hug, i put my arms around his neck without thinking and i think he was going to kiss me. i couldn't look up. my heart was beating so fast. i moved my hands down to his chest and closed my eyes, resting my forehead on his chest. he said, kara. are you okay? i nodded against him and moved away. after talking a bit more he seemed pretty smiley and happy lol. i told him that i tried to talk to megan about it and that she thought i was crazy. at that point he asked me are your feelings for me real? that same exact question has been floating through my mind 24/7. i looked him right in the eyes and said yes. at that point i just wanted to be with him. i said, believe me, i've been thinking about this for a while. and he said ok, ok. he told me to call him tomorrow and he left. i'm waiting until tonight to call him, but i can't stop thinking about this weekend. he's going to rays birthday party and he's going to get wasted. what does this mean now? ughh fuck. my parents are going to be gone mon-fri for their anniversary and i want him to stay over. is that bad? probably. but i want to sleep with him. in both ways lol. i'm in so much trouble."

a while ago megan and i went to jareds house when his mom was out of town. we thought it would be funny to see the guys, though it only ended up being us, jared, ray, lavoris, another black guy lol, and erik. SO. we drank before we left the house. i had several beers there. all was good. we were all having a good time. then i took 3 shots. BAD IDEA. i sat on the couch and was very very fucked up. jared came and sat next to me and was asking if i was ok and all that. then he asked me why i couldn't have been like this when we were dating. for some reason my drunk mind took all this as him fucking with me. i went to the bathroom to puke and proceeded to throw up and cry for several hours. (mind you, this is all very very blurry to me) megan was in there with me seeing what was wrong and i do know that i told her i was confused about jared. she told him this, and several times he tried to come in and talk to me. i remember one instance where he was saying i didn't know you felt that way still and all that. i told him to get out. he was walking around punching things and shit. of course. i'm pretty sure i passed out. i woke up at like three in the morning to hear jared yelling at the top of his lungs at someone to get the fuck out of his house. megan runs into the bathroom crying and i sobered up (almost) very quickly. apparently she had called him a big pussy hahah because he ""made"" me cry and was hitting stuff. so i grab her and say we're leaving. it was humiliating because they're all in the kitchen with there heads down and...UGH. so embarrassing. so i'm driving home extremely drunk and had to stop at one point to let megan puke..eventually we made it home and passed out. the next morning it all hits me and i'm so confused. i left my phone at his house so i go there to get it and he explains some of what happened. i tell him that its so ridiculous and that i really don't have feelings for him, etc. i leave. i feel really weird. almost panicky. oh god. i think this happened BEFORE i tried to kill myself. oh shit yeah it did. wow. ok well anyways, i'm panicking and shit. jared says the same thing - really anxious. i feel like i don't know myself and i don't know what to do. i can't breathe, etc, etc. so now im really confused. do i actually feel that way? i try to put it out of my mind. jareds mom goes away again. he starts having parties every night. inviting a lot of girls. i'm jealous out of my mind and going absolutely crazy. the shittiest thing was when my brother goes there and parties with him and I have to pick him up at jareds. i thought i was going to lose my mind. he stopped talking to me the whole time his mom was gone and he was partying with his friends. so i'm real pissed. i ignore him altogether when he starts calling and texting again. he finally gets the hint and then he gets mad. so i call him and i'm telling him that i don't think i can be friends with him anymore. that makes him angrier and we're both yelling and we start talking about his parties and he says something along the lines of did you want to be invited? and i say no! blah blah and he's like ok kara you want the truth? i had girls over and that would've been awkward. YEAH i fucking knew that asshole thanks for fucking rubbing it in my face. real fucking nice. so whatever we talk more and i say that maybe we just need some space, all that. i hang up and start crying hysterically. what the fuck is wrong with me? so i start thinking, holy shit, i'm not over him. fast forward a bit (oh, this fight happened the day before my birthday) we talk a lot less, i'm trying to be social on facebook (honestly to make him jealous) and i go to st. augustine. i've been thinking about him every day. but i'm trying to tell myself that it's just because i'm lonely and want a boyfriend so of course i think of him. he would be the easiest thing. and THAT MIGHT BE TRUE. but i still don't know. so i'm drunk, i'm in st. augustine, and at 3 in the morning i text him and say ""so i'm probably going to be really pissed in the morning but i have something to confess. i miss you. or i miss the way you were. don't hold it against me"" HAHA. and then i pass out. ok so he texts back in the morning ""were you drinking last night"" haha. ""lol yes look i'm sorry about that. apparently its my new thing to do stuff like that when i'm drunk"" ""it's fine but can i confess something"" now i'm fucking scared. ""um i guess? but hey if you're just going to tell me that you have a girlfriend or something i get it you don't have to explain anything"" ""no not at all i want to see you more before i go"" OH COME ON what does that mean?! ""yeah me too"" ""ok when do you get back"" ""either tonight or tomorrow i haven't decided yet"" ""ok well let me know"" and then we just talked quickly today but i had to study so he said he'd talk to me tomorrow. and last night he went to a party at christian's house and kyle was there and i think kyle knows that i still might have a thing for him so i asked him if jared was with anyone and he said no that he was spooning with dino all night haha and that he was reallyy fucked up, drunk since like 3:00 that afternoon. so tomorrow i'm going to ask if he wants to do something this weekend, and if i can muster up the balls, i'm going to basically tell him how i feel. i'm sure he knows what i'm going to say. but i need to fucking tell him. i don't know what to expect. he could tell me that i'm gross (believable) and that he has absolutely no feelings for me anymore which is honestly what i'm expecting. i'm pretty sure that that's going to break me. but yeah. it's my fucking fault in the first place. all i can think about is how much i regret breaking up with him in the first place and how he never would've fucked all these other girls and we would still be together. plus the way i did it was so shitty.  i just want to make it up to him. UGH IM LOSING MY FUCKING MIND. everyone and i mean everyone will think im fucking crazy. OH GOD. and here's the other thing: HE JOINED THE FUCKING ARMY. he leaves in january for like 4 months of training and then he's here and then he's in the army as a calvary scout for 3 years. he could go to fucking iraq. if we had stayed together, i would've begged him not to go. even if he would be willing to take me back (doubtful) he's just going to leave. what the fuck do i do. so this all leads up to my insane fucking dream last night. we're in my house in new york (obv) and i tell jared that i made a mistake and that i want to be with him again. he gets so mad and goes crazy and hits me and shit saying how could i put him through all that just to get back with him. and then he rapes me (i know!!) and is saying that i belong to him and all this shit. im crying and begging him to stop cause nows hes like beating the crap out of me haha and like smacking me around. and this is all happening in my parents bedroom. so im begging him to get out of the room because my mom is coming so we go out and she sees him and freaks out and wants to get him out of the house but im trying to save him and push him up to my room. so we get up there and my moms really mad and i close the door and he starts hitting me again and i think for a while im running from him but then i don't care that he hits me. i still want to be with him and i want to protect him. then it like skips around and i wake up in a bed and look over and see jared sitting with his head in his hands. he looks miserable but i can tell that our relationship is different now, happier, more like it was before. but he's still sad. i think i wake up a bit after that. but you know i always feel really weird and can have the strangest feelings after i wake up from such vivid dreams like that. so i'm laying in bed and all i can think about is how much i want him and how i would do anything to make him happy as long as he takes me back. i start crying when i think about him going in the army and how absolutely crushed i would be if he cheated on me after i devoted myself to him again (he told me a while ago that theres no way he'd ever stay faithful to one girl again). so yeah now im crying over him again. and just dying to talk to him. so oh my god thats so fucking long. but seriously, i can't stop thinking about him. i'm insane. i know this. lol. 

side notes: i've lost some weight again. my belt is in between the 2nd and 3rd hole (i can get it to the third, but i think my belt has just stretched). my jeans from a couple months ago are baggy and i can wear tight tshirts. i can go without a sweatshirt, although i do tend to hide my scars and my arms are still chubby. i have an appointment with a psychiatrist on the 18th. im scared. i'm convinced i'm going to get better. and all i had to do was tell myself to stop feeling sorry for myself and do something about it. ok i have a huge test tomorrow and i havent' gotten past the first couple pages so im gonna go. i'll probably have more to add later or tomorrow. night."

"event","last night i tried to kill myself. i was drinking by myself and i was asking myself why haven't you done it already? stop fucking saying you're going to and actually fucking do it. so i grabbed all the sleeping pills i could find and poured a nice glass of rum. there were about fourty pills. then i layed back and begged for it to work. i remember getting pretty sad though and i wrote a note saying that i was sorry and that i loved them. 





i woke up at 1:00 this afternoon covered in my own vomit. i couldn't move either. i had vomit on my face, all over shirt and pants, all over the pillows and the sheets. there was also some on the floor next to the bed. the bed was soaked also, i'm assuming from all the alcohol that must've come out. it was in my hair, and my hair was so matted together it looked like it was only a few inches long. i had to pee so i tried getting up and my legs were giving out under me. i couldn't stand up for very long because i would get so dizzy and sick. my shirt was still covered in vomit, which was blue-green, from the mixture of rum and orange juice and lots of little blue pills. i got into the shower and sat down. i couldn't put my hand into my hair so i covered it in conditioner and grabbed a comb. it must've taken my twenty minutes to finally get it straight again, and by then a lot of it had ripped out. i got out of the shower once because i remember i had left the door unlocked with my note sitting on a chair in front of the door. what would my family do if they walked in and saw that and i was still alive? i sat in the shower for a while longer. it felt like my senses were hyperaware. my pupils were so dilated. everything was so loud. i got out of the shower and didn't have the energy to dry myself off. so i layed down wet in a towel and curled up into a ball on a clean corner of the bed. i puked several more times, all bile, and with a lot of dry heaving. there was a bunch of puke on the bathroom floor also, along with another shirt covered in vomit, which i'm assuming i changed out of at one point in the night. the vomit was still all over my bed, but i didn't want to bring vomit covered sheets down in front of my parents. after throwing up a few more times i felt better and put clean clothes on. i also took all of the sheets off the bed and threw them in a pile.  i was really nervous because you could actually see some of the blue pills and i thought that frankie might eat them. i think i fell asleep on the mattress. i can't really remember actually. i was unbelievably dehydrated so i did see my parents once when i went down to get a glass of water. it tasted awful. when they left i tried to clean up. the room stills smells terrible though. i have the windows open and i went crazy with the febreeze. now i just have to wash the pillows and the room should be pretty good. 


i feel like i'm never going to be the same after this. i actually fucking did it. and it didn't even work. i remember my first thought upon waking up with my face in a puddle of vomit was ""i wasn't supposed to wake up today."" how can i come back from this? the other fucked up thing was that i was grateful for throwing up, because i looked thinner today. i should've died last night. i had two shots. the pills and the opportunity to choke on my own vomit in my sleep. i don't feel like the same person anymore. today was quite possibly the worst day of my life. i don't know what to do. i should've just stuck with cutting my wrists. i'm such a fucking mess. what the fuck do i do?"

NOTHING. this won't change anything. i won't talk about it. i won't see a fucking shrink. fuck you all. all this has done is made me so much more upset and taken away one of the only things i could do only for myself. fuck you. FUCK YOU"

"event","the absolute worst thing happened today. i'm fucking freaking out. kyle and i were driving to get groceries and i was wearing short sleeves cause its so hot and i figured kyle's already seen my arms anyway. i started scratching one of the scars mindlessly and kyle says what the fuck is that!? and freaks out saying you cut yourself!? and why?! i'm going to tell someone.. i just texted kevin i have to tell someone and i'm telling him fuck you if you do one thing for me ever just don't tell anyone it's not a big deal i havent done it in a while blah blah.. he's really quiet and he keeps texting someone and we're not talking at all. then we get home and i'm upstairs and i see that both kyle and my mom are gone. my first thought: fuck. i wait and they come back together and my mom won't look at me. so i wait at the top of the stairs and look at kyle and say fuck you. he says what? i was in the exercise room i wouldn't tell her. of course he fucking did because she comes upstairs a few minutes later and says is there something you need to tell me? have you been hurting yourself? can i see your arms? fuck me. i'm saying no i'm not talking about there's nothing to talk about. she asks me if i've been drinking a lot too. i say some nights. she says i need to see someone because this isn't good. i tell her again i'm not talking about theres nothing to worry about. drop it. just drop it. she walks out. FUCK this is my fucking nightmare. UGHHHH i can't believe kyle did this  to me i thought i would be able to trust him with something like this.

"event","i had to go to mcc today to get my mcc id card and parking decal. i was dreading the picture because i know i'm gross. anyways there's two chicks in the office and she tells me to stand on the white line. she takes the picture so quickly i wasn't ready. or maybe that's just an excuse. either way the picture is terrible. i'm sitting there waiting for her to print everything out and she turns to the other chick and says, ""hey"" and the other girl starts bursting out laughing. but at this point who really knows if that even happened,it could have just been my paranoid self-conscious, but the picture is the worst i've taken my entire life -- no exaggeration. my eyes are half-shut, i have 3 chins, i look like i weigh 200 lbs, my mouth is in this weird crooked smile that shows how fat my cheeks are and my hair is a frizzy limp mess. i mean i knew it would be bad but JESUS. all i kept thinking on my way home was this is what i look like on the inside. this is what the horrible part of me looks like. this is what my soul must look like - a fat disgusting sad mess. and the thing is, you'd think seeing that would make me want to stop eating altogether and jump on a treadmill. but the more i thought about it, and how the girl was laughing hysterically, the sadder i got and the more i just wanted to eat. then i figured out that the thing i wanted to do most is drive my car off a bridge. SO much easier than losing the weight. it's just so bizarre to me that i can think i'm having a good day and have everything fall apart. i don't know how i've ever believed that i was attractive, that i could be desirable. it just doesn't connect for me- i can look okay in the mirror and then i see a picture of myself and i'm the ugliest piece of shit. my appearance reflects my unhappy, mean, undeserving, self-centered mind. i constantly am telling myself to just finally accept the fact that you're not pretty, not thin; no one will ever want you. stop looking at boys like you think they like you. i'm watching garden state and i just thought that for once i'd like someone to look at me and say to themselves, she's a good person. no one in my fucking family even sees that. it's like i hate everything i've done in this life so far - i hate everything that i am, and i just want to change. but my appearance has always come first. always i think i have to change how i look to others before i can be a better person. i want to be beautiful on the inside."

"event","do you have any idea how lonely it all is when you're drunk? it fucking sucks. you think too much. my parents just came home. what is it. 12:30? i went out there and asked why they were home so late. my dad looked at my mom and she said, ""well we ended up staying at gary's mom's until it was 10:00. bear in mind that i called both of them at 10:45 and only my dad answered, saying that they were at 15 south, and that they were okay. i had called because i was worried -- every time they had stayed out that late -- past 11:00 (they're usually home at exactly 10, [well it used to be exactly 11, but my mom fell again so its now 10]) something has happened to one of them. mainly my mom - she has had her nose broken once, her teeth gone through her lip twice, hospital for stitches twice, my dad makimg fun of the whole situation, twice). HAHA  kyle just came to the door and said that they both just went to bed and that the first thing he heard my mom say to my dad was, haha, ""you're fat, get over it"". hahah. well what do you expect? you're like 200 lbs. you're only 5'8 and you look like a pregnant woman. last night i was brushing my teeth and i heard this crash from the kitchen. so i run out there and i see my dad laying on the floor, holding his wrist, with the barstool on the floor next to him. i yell, ""dad!"" and  he looks around, trying to find the source of the sound, and sees me, upstairs. i ask him what the fuck happened, and he says that his leg fell asleep and when he tried to stand up it gave out, and he grabbed the chair trying to hold himself up. whatever. fuck that. you're a fucking drunk and i can't believe i gave a shit about you. i ran out there scared that you were fucking hurt and the next day, i walk out talking to my mom, asking if she knew about what happened that night, and HE fucking laughs about it, saying ""and i grabbed the chair but it just fell with me HAHAHAHA"". FUCK YOU. you asshole. you make me scared about someone i don't even care about for some dumb fuck drunkin' reason. i had some messages i left in my phone to remember.. hold on... OH! take some diet pills before you go to sleep!!! i'll put them out right now....  there. done. right down the pipe. and you know what? it tasted delicious. god, it takes forever to type when you're drunk. you know what? i deserve to be up all night puking with how fat i've gotten lately. I'M FUCKING ASHAMED TO GO OUTSIDE, TO GO FOOD SHOPPING, TO DO ANYTHING!!! hahahahha, you think alcoholism is genetic? HAHA. well maybe it's passed on to me. GOD it's so hot in here. OK to my texts. it says: do you ever notice that when you're drunk, you're body tingles and moves without consent?  
mind you i feeling disgusting. i'm so ashamed of myself i should just kill myself
OH haha also, i've dreamed about this: dum dum dum.... my parents ask why i've  been drinking and i say, ""i've learned from the best! where else can i have learned that drinking is the only thing that will make my problems bearable!"" and you know what just sprung to mind? my scars. how the FUCK do i talk to kyle about cutting. the kid is already into self-mutilation. he knows that they're there and he knows that they're from cutting. but how the fuck do i actually say it out loud!? when i say it out loud i sound like a fucking mental paitent. i wanted to be a role model to my little brother, and now i'm this fuck-up, just showing what to do wrong. do you have any idea how much of a bastard i would be if i confessed everything to my brother? he doesn't deserve any of this shit. how the FUCK would he react if i told him that i want i want to die? that i want to kill myself???!?!? fuckkk, god fuck you this is terrible. fuck you for making me this way and therefore making kyle deal with all this shit! i was watching this movie babylon a.d. and this girl is named aurora. god that's a beautiful name -- my favorite names: evangeline, angeline, emeline, ameline, aurora. Haha yeah well you get it. anything with -ine as the ending. anyways. i just texted jared as i always do. fuck thank god for this autosaving. ok yeah. in the movie she said, looking at the northern lights, that's where i got my name. and i thought about my name, and about killing myself, and about my brothers naming one of their daughter's after me. fuck, i thought. that would just be a curse. kyle asked me to draw at nazi swastyk tattoo on him today, after the guy in american history x. i've been drunk so manyu nights lately that i don't remember the endings of the movies that i've watched. and i know i've said this before but people only post shit on here because they want other people to feel bad about them. fuck that."

"event","so last night i got drunk (which has been an everyday occurence lately..) and i left myself a note to write about a thanksgiving years ago, im assuming because i dont want to ever forget about it.

i was maybe 12 or 13, and my whole family was together for thanksgiving. it was a beautiful day, nice and cool. i was wearing a sweater and jeans. john ryan took kyle and i to the dog park with his dog, charlie. we went in the afternoon so the sun was setting and it was incredibly beautiful. the leaves were changing, and the setting sun cast an orange glow over everything. we let charlie play with the other dogs and we walked him around the park, following the trails through the trees and the fields. 

i will always remember this as one of the best days of my life. i could breathe out there in that park. i spent the day with  my family, the people i love. and after we left the park we went home to the rest of our family and we ate and laughed and talked about silly things. and the miracle of that is that at the age of 12, i didn't give a shit about food or my weight and i had no idea of all the shitty things wrong with my family. i didn't realize that my parents were getting drunk during thanksgiving dinner. i can't even remember them going out to legends after dinner, though i'm sure they did. 

which just made me remember another thing -- the day of my confirmation. we went out to a nice dinner at mt. fuji, and then my parents dropped me off at home and went the the bar. i was so mad that i ran upstairs and when they tried to give me my present a few hours later i refused to accept it. it was the same diamond cross that my mom always wore. she had bought it years ago when she got hers and planned to give it to me on my confirmation day. it was such a shitty day. it ended up that they yelled at me until finally i came downstairs and she just told me to take it. i grudgingly accepted it and went upstairs. 

but enough about the shitty stuff. i mostly wanted to remember that one memory. so there it is."

it made me feel inadequate as always. he deserves her.i know she will make him happy.
so i got drunk. i am currently drunk, on my way to getting very drunk.
and yet, it has not changed anything.
i am still incredibly lonely. i cut today. it was a very good cut. so much so that i am thinkingw of doing it again. nver cut drunk before. i am guessing that it will be a really good one because i don't think i'll feel it right away.
we'll see. at the moment i'm putting the razor on my nightstand so i don't forget. you know what i like about cutting... the scars fade. i can walk around without a long sleeve shirt or bandaids and people don't notice my scars. only i know that they're there. for some reason i take some pride in that. i've started exercising regularly again and i think its because the other day, i had this memory of me hugging my self, wearing that AE pink shirt and jean capris. i remember holding my stomach and feeling hunger and flatness. i wasn't fat. i fit into those size 2 jeans and that shirt that was my ""fat shirt"" that i can't even wear anymore. i want to be there. if i have to replace food with alcohol or pills or coke i'll do it. i'm disgusting.  i know that. the last thing i would want people to think is that i actually think i look good. believe me, i know that i'm gross. i've been feeling so much better lately but this shit with matt has brought be back to square one. i hate myself so much. i wish i could go back to the beginning and change everything. please please let me go back. i would change so many things. please. the other night i asked my friends if they would change anything, and they said yes but that they were happy at how things turned out. not me. i stayed silent. my life has gotten progessively worse. i need to change things. but that will never happen. i've fucked everything up. fate is bullshit. i was not supposed to be here. i was supposed to be in new york. i should've given him a chance. i shouldn't of been so scared. god fuck. please give me another chance. please. i've realized that i was a mean person and i will change. please let me have him. at this point i can't remember what line of thought i was on. despite having my friends and jared, i am still incredibly lonely. i am empty. i have nothing meaningful. i am only acting on things i feel i am supposed to do. the only thing i have to do at this point is get more drunk and listen to music."

"event","the fucking landscapers drove me insane this morning at 11:00 with the goddamn blower. i finally fell back asleep and at up at 3 to shower and get dressed so i could pick kyle up and then get megan's birthday present. i got her a grinder at rocketman..i'm sure she'll like it. didn't feel like exercising so i ate and played games on the computer. then amy called and she came over. it's weird - amy used to be the only one i could talk to and it always seemed like she wanted to know. now its like she doesnt give a shit and just wants to talk about herself. which is fine. i can listen. i'm trying to be a better listener. it's also part of the reason that i'm going to start writing in the journal again. obviously my life doesn't matter to anyone but myself haha so at least i'll feel better if i can get it down in here. plus, my memory is so terrible nowadays that i just want to know how i felt in the past. i wish i had kept a journal while i was at fairfield. today i don't feel so sad. i feel chubby, but having friends really does help. the lonliness for four months was overwhelming. something's going on with my parents - the whole time my mom was in new york my dad was saying how much he loved her and missed her and how great a person she is. then last night they're whispering about what's wrong with her and what happened in new york and she's saying that he misread everything. it's funny that it reminded me of alex and myself when i got home from new york that summer years ago. although i doubt my mom was running around kissng every man and woman she could. :) . she probably just saw how happy she would have and still would be if we hadn't moved to florida. i've been thinking about that too, recently. i wish i could go back and change so many things. i would be nicer. i would make more friends. i would kiss matt and tell him i love him. i would never leave new york and i would get good grades and go to a good school. but, alas, such will never be. whatever. amy megan and i were talking about the past and stuff the other day and both of them said that they are really happy with how things have turned out. i just sat there. i am not happy with where i am. i am an emotional mess. haha. i think too much. i'm a loser. megan's birthday is tomorrow so that should be fun. i hope olivia isn't there. she's so gorgeous now and so so so thin. she must weigh at most 90 pounds. and yet, what am i going to do when i get off of the computer? eat and eat and watch tv. because i've been wanting to do it for a few hours now and it will make me happy. UGH. im just so FUCKING tired of this goddamn cycle. im tired of waking up and feeling like shit every fucking day. whatever. i'm alive, right?"

"event","it seems last time i posted i was still in fairfield but had broken up with jared already. to update: i went to fairfield. my mom has breast cancer. i was dating jared and i loved him a lot and i was going crazy being without him. i didn't let myself enjoy anything. before i left, i spent about $12,000 on clothes jewelry and shoes by using the company card. it would have worked out had sandy not told my parents. they also gave me a credit card and put about $5,000 on it for school. i think it was supposed to last at least the semester. i ended up using the money to fly back and forth to florida about every two weeks to see jared without my parents knowledge. on my last secret vacation, i spent two weeks with jared at ray's house. after that trip, i didn't have enough money to come back anymore. i thought i was happy during those two weeks but i realize now that i was just escaping from all of my responsibilites. i returned to connecticut with new motivation to get my shit life in order. i talked to my teachers and counselour and started to make up the work. for about a week i worked nonstop trying to catch up. i got a job working at the dining hall. naturally, after working my ass off for about a week and a half, i gave up. let me also add that i hadn't been throwing up because we had a community bathroom with five stalls. when i tried to fix things, i stopped eating, but once i ate again everything caved in. i stopped going to class. i slept until three in the afternoon and then went to work at night. i loved working because of the people there. i should also add that i really loved the friends i made there, more specifically my roommate britt, megha, and mary. being with them was the most fun i'd had in such a long time. so at this point, i'm bingeing almost every day, puking it all up again (because i learned that at dinner time, almost no one came into the bathroom; although there were several instances there were people there so i'm sure it got around that i throw up my food), i went to work and stayed up a lot at night by myself. now, at this point i'm going out with my friends on the weekends to parties and to the city. this is pissing jared off because he can't trust me or whatever. we're fighting every day, every phone call actually, and he tends to remind me that he'll kill himself if i ever break up with him. i had also been talking to bobby a lot at this point, the 22 year old guy i worked with. we had ""hung out"" a few times but they felt a lot like dates. the new attention from guys at work and at parties, and from being around so many beautiful girls all the time made me slowly start to eat less. oh yeah, and i broke my foot at a party. as it healed, i was eating so much less, taking diet pills, and i would run three-four miles a night in freezing weather - but i felt amazing. it was the thinnest i've been in so long. i actually liked how i looked naked. then jared came to fairfield for five days or something. once he got here i started eating again and i stopped running. he could tell something wasn't right with us. we had sex the night he came and i was crying because it felt so wrong and he didn't even notice. he was crying the next day saying how scared he was that we would break up. at that point, i already knew that i was going to break up with him but i was scared and didn't know how or when to do it. then he found a text in my phone to megha from myself that said ""its bobby tell her its ok to kiss me"" bobby had sent it to her one night when we were hanging out because he wanted to convince me to kiss him when i still didn't want to cheat on jared. neverless, we were in his bed cuddling while jared thought i was in my dorm. we kissed a few tims but nothing more. so jared finds the text, flips a shit, and i tell him some bullshit story about bobby wanting britt, not me. so jared is pacified, still upset, but whatever. he leaves the next day and i get my boot off. this is right before thanksgiving. i go home for thanksgiving and know it has to be now. at the time i thought i really like bobby. i broke up with him the day after thanksgiving. it was awful. he was so upset and crying and yelling. he asked for one last day to be with me and i said that it was fine. he held on to me and kissed me and cried. i was scared of being alone but i know that it was the right thing to do. i went back to fairfield, failing all my classes, looking forward to parties, and thinking of bobby. bobby and i finally decided to get together. i think he was nervous because he wouldn't make the first move so i ended up stradling him and getting things started. long story short - he couldn't get it up. all of a sudden, all my feelings for him went right out the window and i was so turned off. he was so embarrassed and asked me not to tell anyone. i told him it was alright but maybe a week later i just told him that i wanted to be friends but that i was over the whole hooking up thing. he was really mad and work was a little awkward. christmas was coming soon and this was the time that i saw the movie twilight online and then read the series. i fell in love with it and it really made me realize that i was completely right for breaking up with jared because it was not true love. the books showed me what love should be like, although to me it confirmed that there was a huge possibility i would never find it. the last couple of weeks before everyone left for christmas, i rarely got out of bed. when i was the last one left in the dorms, all i had to eat were apples and easy mac, followed by 12 diet pills. i was still pretty thin at this time and i remember coming home and kyle asking if i had lost weight. during winter break, jared and i were still hanging out. that was when i found out that i would not be going back to fairfield. i got kicked out and i felt like shit. i thought my parents would kill me. i had planned on making things better again, but i was not given the chance. when it came time to tell my parents, they were more understanding than i thought they would be, probably because they thought i was depressed or something. well time went by and i never left the house. it's been months. i am relatively sure that this is the lowest i've been in my entire life. although i may have cried more in years past, i have never in my life been more able to finally kill myself. for a while i was numb. i avoided everyone and everything. then relatives started coming down to see my mom and i woke up a bit. then i started cutting. i felt even more alive then. then my parents went away and kyle and i had to deal with the whole party situation that was a complete disaster. the only good thing that came out of that was that it completely shook me up and woke me up out of this hole. it was my nightmare come true but it showed me that i cant escape from the world. i stopped cutting as much but i still do occasionally. by the way, i am the heaviest i've ever been in my life. its disgusting really. at first i just ate nonstop. then i started taking tons of pills. they don't really work anymore but i've been trying to eat less and exercise. im still fat though. my friends came home last week so its been good to see them. its also a wake up call to realize that amy is more attractive than i am. lets see. other odd facts. im in love with robert pattinson..but more in love with edward. frankie is obsessed with me now. jared has been ignoring my attempts to reach him for over a week. im beyond horny all the time now and i have sex dreams every night. kyle is one of my best friends and he's one of the reasons i didn't kill myself that night after writing my suicide notes. my parents seem to be worse alcoholics and my dad is a fucking asshole. i read fanfiction stories based on twilight all the time. besides that, i watch tv and movies constantly. my sleep schedule is from 5am - 4pm. i still hate myself. i think i should get help but i dont want to fucking talk to someone about it. i don't want to be probed and weighed. im going to mcc this summer and in the fall. i have 6913 songs on itunes. i want to fall in love. real love. i want to be thin. i want to be envied. fuck. all this time and i haven't made it past square one. go figure."

i want to be happy - especially happy with someone else. but how can i possibly be happy when i hate myself so fucking much

i've been loved. whatever i've had that. but i want to be able to be in love with someone just as much as they're in love with me. i know it doesn't sound so terrible. but why the fuck is it so hard for me? why is it so hard to find someone who i can just love unconditionally.. someone that can make me happy and want to live everyday?"

"event","I was so much looking forward to getting away from all the hustle and bustle of work that on Friday I was so excited when my husband and I had embarked on a trip to Normandy Farms with four other friends for the weekend. Breathing the outdoors for three days was simply blissful and just being able to practice ""mindfulness"" was great. What I mean by being mindfulness is simply enjoying being in the moment listening to conversations, watching what they were saying and just enjoying each other's company. It was definitely ""Supersize Weekend"" as Joey had bought a king size air mattress for our tent. We could not fit the air mattress in our tent without having some extra hands to bend the air mattress in half! Oh boy. Jennifer, I will never forget your Super-size pasta that we tried so hard to eat all of it, but could not!!!!! We sure had some funny moments such as the trees talking to me and David's signing whale the opposite way (shaking my head). I hope his sperm goes the right way when he knocks Dawn up, grins! Oh and how I loved the jacuzzi, sauna, swimming, sharing stories by the campfire, having Smores all weekend in the moonlight and the coziness of snuggling up with my hubby in the crisp night. Am definitely looking forward to the aspect of going back and renting a cabin in the wintertime! What an adventure that will be! If you haven't been to Normandy Farms and you ever are out East and want to go camping check out http://www.normandyfarms.com :-)"

"event","I kept thinking of my cousin Jason who lives in New Orleans with his wife of ten months and their young son. Finally I got through to my mom today and was relieved to find that Jason, his wife and son were all reunited in California with his wife's relatives. The house they had is completely under water, everything is gone. Every time I watched the news, I thought of them and my family was just there ten months ago when they got married and seeing the people sleeping on the main way into town is just so strange. I wondered what would I have done in their situation? I would probably feel displaced and overwhelmed with grief. It just makes you wonder what matters the most and what you take for granted. What matters the most to you? What do you think that you take for granted? -Coteriegirl"

"event","Just before our trip out to Arizona, the gas prices was about $2.35 in Massachusetts. Just today I pulled over for gas and could not believe the sign with the numbers at the gas station. I actually said ""WHAT you must be out of your mind""!!!! I could not believe that the gas prices was about $3.45 per gallon. In my dream, I would love it if the government told us they would pay to install diesel motors in every car in the United States. Imagine, how much we would save money on diesel. I was watching a very interesting show some months ago about this man who went to restaurants to ask for vegetable oil (I believe) and he had a process where it was cleaned and saved in barrels before pumping his vehicle (a cheaper effective way). I do also wonder how good diesel does for the environment. Nature disasters, politics, the economy and human beings, who could actually imagine how all this intertwines together and affect us so deeply.-A troubled citizen"

"event","The rubric catches my eye
Unlike a closed book
The pages starts to open 
Pulling me in
All the things
I have forgotten
Unfolds

Why do you haunt my heart sometimes
That goes like a merry-go-round
A maraud is what it feels like
There are loots awaiting
Around the corner

I pray that my shadow keeps me
Safe
For sometimes the memeories 
Leaves me afflicited
With pieces 
Inanition is seeked
For my soul wants to forget"

"event","For the past year I've been living in New Bedford, Massachusetts. It's funny how I pass streets everyday and see the New Bedford Harbor. The harbor is at the mouth of the Acushent River which flows into the Buzzard Bay as well as the Atlantic Ocean. I love the ocean and I believe in my other past life if I was an animal, I was a dolphin or something! There are alot of boats and New Bedford Harbor is one of the nation's major fishing ports. There are also ferry services that goes to the Cuttyhunk Island, Martha's Vineyard and to the other islands. From the ocean, the bay, the river and back to the streets, as I was driving home today from work, I came to a stop light and realized that I have never really paid attention to a particular street called Mill Avenue! My mouth just dropped! The reason for this is because recently I went to Arizona and there's a street called Mill Avenue, too! Not only that, I pass that street everyday when I go home! 

I do believe this is a huge sign and why would I not notice that street name for about a year until now?!? On Saturday night, another sign had popped up. Joey and I were getting ready to go out to another friend's to hang out and play cards, I had wanted to bring other game cards and I found ""Phase Ten"" in our closet. I was shocked! I was like how did this get here and was this given to us by someone? Because we never played ""Phase Ten"" until TJ and Sean introduced us one Saturday night! Like TJ's comment about believing this is a sign, I definetly have to agree with him since he bumped into Emily Petty at the hospital interpreting for Christie. Emily and I have known each other since we were both young girls. Bumping into Allison at the play who used to be a student at ""Explore Your Future"" when TJ and I worked that Summer in 2000 is another sign! I wonder if TJ will meet someone that doesn't knows me from when I was very young or in my twenties, but perhaps in my teens soon.

As long as I can remember, there has been signs ever since I got married. The funny part is that TJ and Sean had came to our wedding and right after that I have been seeing things that reminds me of Arizona. Sometimes when I go to work, I see vehicles with plates from Arizona and wonder what made them drive all the way here? Sometimes I may see a vehicle with the brand name ""Sedona"". Another time, someone handed me candies and they were made from Arizona. There are many things that have been calling me to Arizona. When I saw those vehicles, I knew it was a sign and had to go to Arizona. Now that Joey and I have been to Arizona, I truly believe that it is definietly a sign because we are just so drawn to Arizona. Why? At this moment, I am not sure. Perhaps sooner or later, that question will be answered. Perhaps an interpretation will be revealed. It's surely amazing what an intuition can really lead a person to or to do something! Perhaps the Phoenix bird knows. - Coteriegirl"

"event","To my coterie guy! 

I'm so glad you introduced me to this website. It's nice to be able to type and share about what's going on in our lives. I hope Sean was there for you after the difficulty of us leaving. It was kinda hard for me. Yesterday morning, I was sad when I woke up and Joey knew I was missing you and Arizona. I wonder how men react in situations like this. I haven't gotten my ticket for D.C. and wonder what is my heart and mind trying to tell me? At the moment, I am surely making plans for the future. On our flight back, we had looked at the rental guide and also how long it would take us to drive and whom we would stay with if we move to Arizona. I have never seen Joey do this quickly. He has always been more reculant to situations like this and tend to take things more slowly. So you can imagine my surprise! 
 Yesterday I went on a home visit to see a new client and they seem to prefer that their guests take their shoes off in their homes. I was not in the mood to really work and my mind was miles away. They had given me slippers and when I saw the drawings on the slippers, I smiled. On the drawings were horses, adobe houses and catcus plants. It warmed me up on a cold, gray and raining day and took me back to the south mountains, the palm trees and the warm sun on my back. This must be a calling because we had a wonderful time with you guys and we just can't get Arizona out of our heads. I truly hope we all age like good wine and become better like aged wine in our friendship in the years to come near or far away. One more cheer to life long friends and a toast to my dearest friend and a great tour guide! 
Yours Truly,
Coterie Gal and a potiential mover to Arizona"

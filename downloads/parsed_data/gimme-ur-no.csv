Hey hey, Takkun~ TAKKUN~! I found a Christmas tree! I'm bringing it home. Get all the lights ready!

<i>[vespa engine starting and steadily running]</i>

~HM~ Maybe I should learn some Christmas songs since it looks like I'll be here for it! Or maybe I should just dig up a Charlie Brown's Christmas and let all the little kiddies see the Great Manora.

Oh, Co~mman~der~ Have I been doing anything <i>suspicious</i> lately? Tell me tell me!

There were so many letters yesterday, but I didn't get one~ I bet if I did, it would've been ""A"" for ~awesome~ It was like Wheel of Fortune, guessing all the letters! I bet if I'd gotten enough people together, we could've played in the square.

So he's not here. The only kind of response I've gotten was from Canti, but that seems to be from a curse that day. Shame. I was so <i>close</i> I guess I'll get to have fun here until I can leave~ Takkun's here, and so is Canti. That girl and the commander are here too. Hmm~ I wonder if I can make things less ~boring~ around here.</font>

You know, even with Turkey Day gone, there's still a lot of family oriented holidays coming. I wonder what kinds of fights people'll get into. Like in that one Denis Leary movie when the entire family just starts fighting and he just gives up his original plan until the very end. 

~I~ really need should get some maintance done to the Vespa. But I can't buy the things I ~need~ without this world's money. What a <i>shame</i>.  I should ask ~Tak~kun~ if he has any ideas~ Or maybe I can just use this network to advertise. I'm sure SOMEONE out there could use my expertise~

Hmmmmm. So, ~Halloween~ is it~? The day the souls return to the dead. Pets come back  to life, and black guys who aren't really black sing and dance with zombies. Little kids go door to door begging for treats, but never get any tricks. So ~sad~
 
What's sadder is Takkun is siiiiiick. But who cares right now? It's HALLOWEEN. Ya snooze, ya lose, kiddos!

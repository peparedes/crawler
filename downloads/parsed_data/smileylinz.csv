Dear You,

Don't try and ""crack"" me if you don't intend to stay to catch the pieces when they fall.  You may have been right, but I know when I'm exposed and I will not let myself fall apart for people who are just going to run.  Your instincts were right; but you're going to have leave it there.

"event","It has been ridiculously long since I last updated.  Well, folks, I made it through my first year of grad school unscathed!  And even though I lost my soul to the library during finals week, it's an amazing feeling to be totally in love with what I'm doing.  I love theology.  And the longer I stay here, the longer my program gets...I'm going to add on a MA in Biblical Studies/Bibilical Languages to my MDiv, and then right now I'm leaning towards putting ordination on hold to get a PhD.  We'll see how it all goes :-)  I'm taking Biblical Greek right now, and it turns out Greek was my hidden talent.  Who knew?  Otherwise, I've been doing quite wonderfully--surrounded by good friends in a wonderful city, with frequent visits and chats with my dearest and most wonderful friends in the world (yaaaay Oles!).  So much has happened that there's really too much to say in one entry, so the following are just some random stream of consciousness musings of mine that probably won't make too much sense, but hey, that's really not my problem because this is MY journal ;) 

Musings as of Late:

1) I'm learning that the life I can predict for myself is not necessarily the life I want to live.  I'm done with the most logical path.  I'm realizing that I don't WANT my life to look exactly how I imagine it to look, because really?  That doesn't leave room for God to act.  And God has a better imagination than I do.
2) I still have little to no tolerance for people who take out their frustrations on other people.  NOT OKAY.
3) I think I may be a student forever.
4) Some things don't get easier with time.  And I'm going to stop making myself feel guilty about that.
5) My faith life may have been deconstructed this year, but it has come back in full force...having been given close to every reason why I shouldn't believe in God, I'm happy to say that I still do.  I'm glad I made it through this first year.
6) How the heck did I ever live in Minnesota?  (answer: the people :-) )
7) Berkeley is NOT the place I'm going to live for the rest of my life.
8) I am not a person who likes ambiguity.  Sadly, ""ambiguity"" seems to be the name of the game for those of us right out of college...and have I mentioned that it feels REALLY good to have made it through this year? 
9) Amazing communities pop up where you least expect them, and you can't compare them to your idea of what you think they should be; you'll miss out on how beautiful they actually are.  Again, God has a better imagination than we do.
10) After a year in Berkeley, I still find liturgical dance truly obnoxious.
11) I think everyone needs a place they can go to that reminds them of how big life is.
12) I'm not upset that people don't ask me the questions I need to be asked anymore -- because I can't read people's minds either."

"event","7 years ago today I was diagnosed with epilepsy.  I really, truly don't mean for that to sound morbid--I honestly forgot about the significance of ""March 8th"" in my life until a dear friend brought it up a couple days ago.  Today I find myself really reflective, as anyone would be on a day like today.  I find that as time goes on, March 8th has become one of those milestones in the year much like New Year's or birthdays, a day where we take some time to think about where you've been and where you're going.  What really struck me this year, initially, was not how devastating an experience becoming epileptic was, but how LONG 7 years is.  I mean, 7 years!  A lot has happened in 7 years.  And 7 years is a long, long time to have a disease that they told me I didn't even have in the first place.  I find that I'm healing--the wound is not as fresh, and it will never heal completely; but I'm not crushed in the same way I used to be.  I think about how young I must've been then; I feel so extraordinarily young now, and even as the person who lived through the event I can't imagine what it was like for my 7-years-younger-self to go through it.  It's so funny that people always marvel at how old I was when I first starting having seizures, because while 16 years old may be ancient in the epilepsy world, as a human being I was still a little girl.  I've grown up a lot since then, but I'm still a little girl in a lot of ways.  

Sometimes, I hate how much my life is defined by my health.  On particulary frustrating days, I wish I could just throw out my pills and any other remnants of epilepsy from my life--I wish I would forget the words seizures, epilepsy, MRI, neurologist, etc.  But attached to this tragedy in my life are some of my greatest joys.  I learned a few years ago that denying the role my health has played in my identity, my friendships, and faith would not make it any less present or profound.  And I learned that it was okay to be shaped by my life experiences, even negative ones.  Because owning it and growing from it is what turns it from a destructive experience to a constructive experience.

This is not to say, of course, that I think of it all as sunshine and roses, even on a day like today.  Tears do burn at my eyes when I remember the day that I woke up to find that my whole life would never be the same.  I'm still scared about medication, the frequency of my seizures, and my still contested MRI's.  As much as I may be healing, I still grieve this.  Especially on a day like today.  

It was fitting that today in my synoptic gospels class we were talking about the essential qualities for biblical interpretation, one of which is being honest with and embracing not only our social location but the meaning we project onto the text because of who we are and what we've seen.  I have learned to embrace the fact that my theology is almost entirely health-based.  7 years ago today my life stopped making sense.  So 7 years ago today I started to worship a God who, in his divine senselessness and absurdity, gave my life meaning.  7 years ago I was hospitalized and completely ill; and yet today I am preparing to become a chaplain in that same setting, only this time not as the sick one.  Absurdity does have its own meaning.

7 years ago today I thought my life had ended.  Yet as I reflect on all of this, I realize that it was 7 years ago today that my life actually began."

"event","Okay, so I'm still studying like mad for the big finals (woot for Old Testament/New Testament Archaeology and History!), but I just had to update again because I find myself (once again) feeling sublimely happy.  Even though I not only am having seizures, but also seem to be getting bronchitis.  Why am I feeling so chipper?  Because I have awesome, awesome friends.  My roommates, for one, are the most lovely, hotttt, fun, encouraging, sincere women I've ever had the pleasure of living with (tied with my podmates senior year, of course :-) ).  Second, my PSR friends--all of them are amazing, but it's wonderful to realize that I'm part of community that's going to catch me if I fall.  And when I have fallen (whether it be due to seizures or something else), they've already come through in ways that literally move me to tears.  What a life it is when you don't doubt that you're loved; a life that everyone I know deserves."

"event","Although finals are looming on the very near horizon, I felt moved to update simply by virtue of the fact that I'm feeling...well, just happy :-) Not that this is an unusual thing, but have you ever had one of those moments where you look around and think ""Life is good""? Well, bingo babycakes--that's where I am. And it's intersting--I didn't just look around at my present surroundings and circumstances, but I've also been taking some good long looks into my past and into my future.&nbsp; The good news is that I like what I see. And I guess I feel morally obligated to write his journal entry and record the fact that I feel this way so that I will have hard evidence of this feeling when, inevitably, I start to question my life and feel pouty about something or another :-)&nbsp; So for now, I think I'm just going to do a lame little list of the things that make me happy right now:

It's the Simple Things, Folks: A list of things that make your friend Linz happy

1) Okay, so this is a dumb one, but the soundtrack to LOST; there's something so poignant about that instrumental ditty they bring up in dramatic moments
2) Starbucks.  Starbucks is my haven.  There is NOTHING like a tall cup of the Christmas blend to get my day started.
3) My roommates...what would I do if I didn't have two of my best friends to come home to everyday?  
4) PSR--it's grown on me :-)  
5) Performing.  Oh my gosh, I love performing.  I love to sing, but honestly I love it most when I'm in a group.  And thank the Lord in heaven, I still have opportunities to do that :-)  So yippee hurray for singing!
6) Having a schedule where I'm pulling my hair out because I'm so busy.  Honestly, that sort of thing makes me happy :-)  
7) Finally learning how to really, truly open up and be myself in relationships
8) Having friends who teach me how to do it everyday
9) Tyler's current/NiNi's old couch in the Ellingson apartment.  You know, the one that has some sort of magic spell on it that makes it the perfect nap couch.  True story: if I'm having trouble sleeping at night, I imagine I'm on that couch instead of my bed...it works like a charm.
10) My Old Testament class--I love scribbling notes at a lightning pace for 3 hours during Mary's lectures and thinking my hand is going to fall off.  Because now, as I'm studying for the final, I'm realizing ""woah!  I learned a lot!""
11) Not studying for finals and updating my livejournal instead
14) Being torn about what to study in the future because I feel passionate about so many things; current options are chaplaincy/pastoral care, music and religion, and philosophical theology.  Where oh where will she go? :-)
15) Getting to that stage in new friendships where the relationship starts to become real 
16) Getting to that stage in old friendships where any possible lingering insecurities or doubts have melted away completely, and you just love each other with all of your hearts 
17) The days when I just KNOW I look hott :-)
18) Having a lot of people to hug, and be hugged by
19) Realizing how much I've changed in half a year, and really really liking what I see

Alright, that be all for now :-)  Back to that studying thing...love and hugs to everyone!"

"event","So we just finished up the first season of Lost, and I am an emotional WRECK.  For the love, that show is INTENSE (quick shout out to my boys: /\).  Anyway, I don't know if I'm going to go to sleep anytime soon, thus I'm here :-)  Not much has been going on as of late that's terribly exciting...I had a really bad seizure week, coupled with what may have been a toxic reaction to Tegretol.  Woo-frickin-hoo.  Everything is still up in the air as far as that goes (still waiting for test results and such), but I'm taking it all one step at a time and, honestly, feeling okay about it all.  I have such an amazing support system here in Berkeley, in MN, and of course San Diego, I feel like I can take on anything life throws my way right now.  Carrie and I went on a retreat with the Presbys this last weekend in the Santa Cruz mountains which was GORGEOUS...but we kind of ended up at a Jesus Resort.  Much conservative theology was heard, but we did manage to meet some pretty awesome new people who, I hope, will turn into good friends.  And on a whole, I don't feel like the conservative-ish stuff was representative of the Presby church community we're in; it was just the leanings of the speakers we had.  What else has happened...I'm seriously behind in work, but what can you do? :-)  I had a very weird conversation with a friend, and have re-adopted my zero tolerance stance on moodiness.  Not that I expect everyone to perky all the time, because that would be yucky; but I just don't like it when people take out there bad moods on their friends, you know?  End rant :-)

And now, I have to share the lyics to a song that completely speaks my soul; at least, it speaks to some recent developments.  You should all definitely download Matt Caplan, he's a rockstar.

""Favorite Puppet"" by Matt Caplan

Are we back at the beginning? 
Haven't we been here before? 
I'm exhausted, you're a little more. 
I want something you don't have. 
I'm a little worried but I know it still goes on without you here. 
I know it still goes on without you here. 

I am through, 
cause I waited for this all my life and then another day. 
Oh, now that you have found another way 
to use your favorite puppet, 
I will dance to please the puppeteer and say, 
Make it so.

Little whisper, secret answers, 
to the core of my dismay. 
Echo in the prayers I never said. 
I am shattered, you are whole. 
It's a little scary how it all can still go on without you here. 
I know it still goes on without you here. 

But I'm sick of telling this story, 
to those who cannot understand. 
Always a step below glory 
In your hands. 

Now we're back at the beginning, 
I know we've been here before. 
Everyone's afraid of what's in store. 
I know something you don't know. 
I know, I know, I know it still goes on without you here. 
Oh I know it still goes on without you here."

"event","I have no idea how do describe this week back at Olaf...it was just so amazing.  And not for any of the reasons I thought it would be; it was such a heartwarming ""homecoming,"" so to speak, in ways I hadn't predicted.  First of all, it WAS a little weird to be at Olaf, but to not be part of the school anymore--I felt a little bit like a ghost sometimes.  Monday night while I was waiting for NiNi to be done with a meeting, I stood out on the Buntrock Plaza all by myself, just looking around and soaking it all in; it was very surreal.  But this feeling of not really belonging at Olaf wasn't devastating to me at all; in fact, it was encouraging, because it made me feel so grateful not only for where I've been but for where I AM.  I was so concerned that I'd go back and never want to leave; but I do have a really wonderful life in Berkeley to come back to.

Here's one thing I never realized about Olaf until now: just how GORGEOUS the student body is!  Seriously!  The ""real world,"" if you will, does not nearly match up to Olaf attractivness.  I honestly felt like I was walking around in a living, interactive JCrew ad (in a fantastic way :-) ).  And, no one exemplified this beauty more than my corridor girls!!  It was so wonderful to spend time with my girls who have all grown up into fantastic, beautiful, confident young women.  Not that they weren't that way before, but it's amazing how much changes over 2 years...they all looked so grown up!  I am seriously in awe that I get to say I was a part of their lives in some way.  

So anyway, this was an amazing visit.  Funny thing is I never got the results to the test I flew out there to have: Dr. Fiol ended up getting sick and had to cancel the follow up appointment on me.  Damn it!  But still, I'll get the results over the phone next week, and this vacation was soooooo worth it.  I got to hear Cantorei sing, and they sounded FANTASTIC.  I got to see Tyler N, Biz, Amy, and Dux.  I, of course, got to have my reunion with NiNi, T-Dubs and Zane, and I nearly cried when I saw them for the first time.  I got to hug people who I've missed hugging everyday.  And I felt so warmly received---I was worried about looking like this random alum who didn't really belong, but everyone was so welcoming and made me feel right at home again!!  I got to marvel at my first-years who are now the next generation in Res. Life (and I am so proud of all of them!!).  I got to go to Perkins and eat at the Cage!  I got to stay at Tyler's apartment in Ell, and not only laugh about how it used to be my Thursday night sanctuary, but also about who I was when I lived in Ell first year and how I couldn't believe that Tyler lived there now.  I got to stay up nearly all night talking with my dear, dear friends who I've missed every second.  And when I burst into tears at the airport today, it wasn't because I was too sad to leave--it was because I was completely overwhelmed with how blessed I am to have that place and those people in my life, whether they're part of my past or my present."

"event","There comes a day where you wake up and decide it's time to stop being who you think everyone wants you to be and start being you are.  For me, that day was today.  

Let me explain.

I've been a bit ambivalent as of late about what I think of PSR.  I've had some great (even unrivaled) experiences there for sure, but there are other things that have just left me doubting my choice in schools.  PSR has an unoffical reputation for being a certain type of divinity school, and I just plain didn't know about it before I got there.  The culture of the school, at times, can be annoying: the younger students are so concerned about being ""cool"" even though they're theology nerds that they become Frat Boys for God, and the older students are so angry at the church to begin with that their vision of Christianity is really, well, angry.  There's a level of immaturity that I didn't expect in a divinity school; but I do know this isn't unique to PSR.  After talking to other people who've been to other schools (including other schools I seriously considering going to), I've learned that the same sort of cultures emerge.  I also had a really, really, ridiculoulsy discouraging meeting with a field-ed woman a week or so ago where she basically told me that my dreams of being a chaplain were  screwed because I wasn't raised in a denomination.  No fun.  I also didn't realize how Christ-phobic senminary could be.  So many people at this school have had such negative experiences at uber-conservative churches that ""Jesus"" seems like a four letter word at my school.  It seems like the general population at PSR is so concerned with being progressive Christians that they forget that ""Christ"" is an integral part of that...otherwise, they'd just be progressive something-or-others.

But anyway, onto why this day was important.  I had an over-the-top amazing meeting with a Presbyterian pastor here in Berkeley, and I've decided to become Presbyterian.  The pastor I met with was just phenomenal; not only did he not flinch when I told him I didn't have a denomination but still wanted to be a Christian leader (gasp), but he also told me that he thought I'd be GREAT pastor and would even sponsor me through the process!  It was so beyond affirming to have someone from within the church meet with me and evaluate me and in the end come to the same conclusions that I have: I'm meant to be a Christian leader in some respect.  While having my friends and family affirm that was beyond helpful, it makes a big difference getting approval from a pastor!  And I'm so, so, so excited about the Presbyterian church.  I'm not a member yet, so there's still time to change my mind, but I'm really thrilled by what I've learned and observed thus far.  It there's anything I've learned at PSR so far it's that I'm not as ""liberal"" as I thought I was when it comes to matters of my own faith.  In my faith, for example, the trinity is important to me, and the figure of Christ as human Savior is absolutely essential to my spiritual experience.  I'm not saying it has to be that way for everyone, but it is for me.  Before I came to PSR, I would have probably chosen a more literal church where they don't affirm the figure of Christ as essential (like at PSR, where they don't reference God or Christ in communion).  But now, I'm learning that my Christology is more unwavering than I ever thought it was; and christ is at the heart of my faith.

At first, these realizations were really scary: Presbyterians at PSR are generally frowned upon as too conservative (all that Jesus talk tends to make people nervous).  I've been under a lot of pressure to join the UCC, or the Unitarian Universalists, who are wonderful in their own right (especially in their tradition of open and accepting ministries and work for social justice).  But back to the theme of today: at some point you just wake up and STOP trying to be who other people want you to be and start being who you actually ARE.  And the ideals of the Presbyterian church come much closer to what I am than any of the other ""progressive Christian"" churches.  

So anyway.  Sorry to get bogged down in theological stuff!!!  Otherwise, my life is fantastic.  For all of my frustrations with PSR, I'd so much rather be there than at an uber-conservative school; overall, it's better to have my limits challenged by being too liberal for my taste than the other way around.  I continue to love the people I'm meeting there, and I'm starting to see some wonderful, meaningful friendships emerge.  I'm going to Vegas on Friday, which is getting me through the week.  Oh, and I love my amazing roommates more than life itself :-)  Yeah #9 Action St.!!

Oh, and on a final note, I'm going to be in MN from the 24th-28th!  Woooohoo!

P.S. I found out, in the end, that my dreams of being a chaplain are certainly possible; I will most likely have to be ordained, which wasn't part of my original plan, but now I'm starting to look forward to the idea :-)"

Things at Div School are going above and beyond my expectations (which isn't all that incredible, I guess, because my expectations were pretty low :-) ).  But seriously, I know I've only been there three days, but I just love it.  It is the most progressive, diverse, and nurturing environments I've ever been in.  I definitely don't expect it to be that way forever, but man...I'll treasure it right now.  I'm in a list mood right now, so I'll just go with it:

-I believe in God
-I believe that I was called to work in the field of ministry (believe me, this is a HUGE step...I definitely wasn't feeling it a week ago)
-I believe that sunny days mean something special
-I believe that ""Here I am, Lord"" is the most beautiful hymn I've ever heard
-I believe in the power of board games...they are the best way to make new friends
-I believe that I should really never worry ever again about my ability to make new friends
-I believe that religion can be a beautiful, beautiful thing
-I believe that religion, when misunderstood and used incorrectly, can be one of our world's greatest problems
-I believe that I am seeing religion being misunderstood all around me
-I believe that PSR will teach me how to change that
-I believe that St. Olaf was the most divine place I've ever been in my life
-I believe that I spent too much time dissing the St. Olaf caf
-I believe I should say a prayer for my safety every time I try to eat the food at the PSR caf
-I believe that every college/university should be wireless enabled
-I believe that it was really freakin convenient to have wireless access AND computers wherever you turned in Rolvaag library
-I believe that the GTU library realllllly needs to learn from Rolvaag
-I believe I've come to expect certain amenities because of all the perks St. Olaf provided us
-I believe it's a kick in the ass to realize in the real world you have to pay for gyms, crappy food, and libraries where you can't sign on to the internet whenever you want
-I believe that the people I'm going to grad school with will be some of the bravest people I've ever encountered
-I believe that making friends takes time when you don't have JC's around to help the process along ;-)
-I believe that I can't think of anything more fun to do on a Thursday night than go to a gay/lesbian club in Oakland with my fellow first year MDiv students
-I believe that over the next 3 years my whole life is going to change a lot
-I believe it won't always be easy
-I believe that it won't be better
-I believe that it won't be worse
-I believe that I will miss St. Olaf every step of the way
-I believe that God has decided it's time for my life to be different

So yeah...sorry for the psedo-poetics, it was unintentional.  I just needed to vent all the things that I'm feeling.  Miss you and love you all!!!"

"event","Greetings from Berkeley!  My transition here has been fabulous thus far...gosh, it's good to be back in California again.  Anyway, Carrie and I have spent the last week and a half setting up our fantastic new apartment and exploring our new stomping grounds.  First off, our apartment is phenomenal--it's right in the heart of the city, an area locals call the ""Gourmet Ghetto"" because there are so many 5 star, hole-in-the-wall restaurants around.  Not bad, eh? :-)  The apartment itself is a really nice size and is really bright and sunny with gorgeous views of the Berkeley hills.  And after FIVE (yes, five) trips to IKEA, Carrie and I have set up quite a comfy, homey place to live.  I really adore it!!!  I'm even loving cooking for myself; Carrie and I are pretty skilled in the kitchen, and when Kristina comes I know we're going to be quite a cooking team.  Outside of the apartment, though, there is always something going on in Berkeley and Carrie and I have taken full advantage of that.  This weekend we went salsa dancing and totally had a blast!  After dancing for three straight hours, I was pretty sure my knees were going to give out...but that's what happens when you go dancing at a club where THERE ARE MORE GUYS THAN GIRLS!  Carrie and I couldn't believe it, we're so used to the 60/40 female to male ratio :-)  We also managed to spend a couple hours strolling around a farmer's market (where I had the best Thai food I've ever had in my life), and took the 20 minute BART ride into San Fransisco for some shopping and exploring.  We've been having so much exploring, I'm sad to be starting school this Monday!  But sadly, I need to learn about being divine, and Carrie has to do the job thing...thank goodness for weekends :-)

As long as I'm here writing, though, I've really felt the need to rant about something.  It's really not a huge deal, but something came up with someone the other day that really irked me.  I think some people assume that I'm a constant in their life, when really?  I'm not.  If you treat me like shit, if you insult me, if you demean me with egotistical comments aimed at making yourself feel better and impressing others, I'm not going to stick around.  I am not a doormat.  I won't always be the first one to call, or e-mail, or send notes and gifts.  And I will CERTAINLY not settle for only being treated like a real friend when it's convenient for you.  Don't be fooled by my quirkyness, or the ditzy act I sometimes put on--I'm no airhead, and if you treat me like one or act like you're doing me a ""favor"" by being friends with me, you've got another thing coming.  I know what I'm worth, and while I certainly don't want to lose a dear, dear friendship over this, I won't keep putting myself and my dignity on the line.

And another thing: just because I don't talk about my health as much anymore, it doesn't mean the same scary, sad things aren't still happening.  How much does it seriously take from you to just ask about it, or feign interest when I bring it up?

Okay, rant over!!  And guys, I can promise you that this rant isn't directed to any of you reading this...all of these frustrations are a) things I will promptly let go, and b) geared towards someone who doesn't even know I have this journal.  

So the moral of the story: my life is awesome, I'm not a doormat, and I can't wait to see how my life in Berkeley unfolds :-)  Love to everyone, and I miss all of you Oles!!!"

"event","I love Huggles.  We just got back from a fabulous mini-vacation to Tahoe; it just rocked.  First of all, I've never been up to Tahoe, and I was blown away by how beautiful it was.  Crystal clear lake, clean air, gorgeous mountains and cliffs and covered with trees...I wanted to send the entire state of Minnesota a memo that said: ""THIS is how you do lakes.""  And there were no bugs! :-)  We were only there for a night (my dad had to fly out to speak at a conference), but we manged to cram in tons of fun.  After tossing our bags into our rooms (I stayed in room 666! Ha!), we booked it down to the casino floor where I won $1,000 on a slot machine.  Sweet!  And because we're such dedicated gamblers, we got a comped dinner at the ritzy steakhouse (depressing to think about how much we gambled to get there, I know).  My dad is so awesome; we had a fantastic long dinner together and then hit the floor one more time to try out our luck some more.

And then, the true highlight of the trip was this morning: I got to see TYSON!!  I cannot tell you how much I love that guy!!  We made it down to the beach he works at pretty early, and just had a fantastic time tanning, talking, and seeing the local sights.  That kid has quite a command for that beach, let me tell you.  AND he took me rock diving, which I've always wanted to do!!!  No one can tell me my neurologist, though ;-)  Poor Tyson had to get a crash course, though, in my utter lack of rock climbing ability; these short, stubby legs were just not created to maximize rock scaling skills.  Anyway, with his help, we made it up the rocks and managed to get several awesome, tandem dives into the icy water below :-)  It was such an incredible day!  Not only was the scenery GORGEOUS, but I got to see one of my favorite Oles.  Thumbs up all around!  I definitely want to go back to Tahoe as soon as I can.

Also, I don't want to speak too soon, but I think I'm starting to actually feel a little excited about Div. school.  Of course, there are still nerves, but as I start to think about the classes and the community and the amazing location, I find more and more reasons to look forward to this new chapter of my life.  Let's hope the feeling stays!"

"event","Tyler left to go back to MN today...good-byes are just hard :-(  I love that guy so much; we have had so much fun these last four years.  I felt like college officialy ended today.  No more wreaking havoc in San Diego with Tyler--it's time for the ""real world,"" whatever that may be.  Well, at least, it will be time for the real world a month from now.  I made it home safely from MN, by the way!  Tyler and I had a fantastic last couple days in San Diego--kayaking, golfing, and of course, eating phenomenal food :-)  I feel like we definitely took a gourmet tour of my hometown.  I'm starting to get more and more nervous about going to Berkeley...I've been having second thoughts recently about my choice in divinity schools.  I really have no idea what to expect, and that FREAKS me out.  Talking to my other buddies, though, has really helped me out; as the summer begins to wind down, it seems like everything is getting nervous about their ""after Olaf"" plans, and understandably so.  For the last three years, we've known exactly what to expect come September, and now it's all different.  

There is a lot to look forward to yet this summer, though!  Outfitting my new apartment is going to AWESOME, and I'm looking forward to spending some quality time with Jody and Huggles in various San Diego casinos :-)  And also, I just found out that I get to see TYSON!!!  Huggles and I are making it up for a little vacation in South Lake Tahoe next week, which is wonderfully close to my former p.o. box mate.  I can't wait to see that guy!

That's pretty much it for me right now!  Doing good, but missing my au pair (aka T-dubs :-) ).  Love and hugs to everyone out there!"

"event","Wow, it's been forever since I last updated!  Anyway kids, sit back and relax as I update you on the finer details on my life :-)

I actually graduated.  By some miracle (and the help of many friends and family), I plowed my way through my 4 years at St. Olaf and graduated on time.  I'm kind of in shock looking back on everything that happened the last couple years, especially...I still remember my meeting with Dean McKelvey this year where, after hearing about my seizures, suggested I take 2nd semester off and make it up next year.  Ha! :-)  Not necessary, apparently.  Anyway, graduation was beautiful, the first sunny day we had in what felt like weeks.  After a the ceremony and dinner with the pod, it was time to pack up my life and go; wow.  It was super hard saying good-bye to everyone, especially some people who I know for sure I won't see for at least another year.  I spent most of the morning after graduation in tears...I felt like I was watching pieces of my heart get up and walk away.  Everyone I met at Olaf shaped me, and watching them leave was just tough.  The day I left St. Olaf was beautiful, too--I will never forget how gorgeous it was.  Everything was sunny and green and breezy and peaceful.  It was a perfect ending to the best four years of my life.

Leaving with Tyler certainly softened the blow a lot, of course.  I spent two weeks at his house, and then we flew out to San Diego and proceeded to have the most rocking summer ever!  The is awesome--not only do we have a ton of fun together, but he also drives me every where :-)  We've kept ourselves pretty busy by going to Vegas, SeaWorld and Disneyland, lounging at the beach and by the pool, baking up a storm, and of course having West Wing marathons.  I'm going to miss him so much when he leaves!!  I don't know what's going to happen when I'm not with another Ole.

Some good news, though: I got an apartment!!!  It'a fantastic 3 bedroom/2 bath exactly where we wanted it to be in Berkeley.  So come visit Kristina, Carrie and I!

Right now, I'm in MN for a little while to see my neurologist and visit my grandmother for her 85th.  It's so weird to back in MN as a visitor!!  But it's just good to be back.  Things have been interesting with my health recently, so it was good to get caught up with my neurologist.  In June, I FINALLY had the big test I'd been waiting for since Feb.  A week after the test, they called me and told me it had been successful: they found scar tissue in my left temporal lobe.  They told me to set up an appointment with my neurologist, and we'd start planning for brain surgery.  The story does not end there, however: a week later, my neurologist called back and said that he'd decided they read the test wrong, and there was no scar tissue on my brain at all.  GAH!  So today, I got the full story from my doctor.  A panel of 20 doctors looked over the test, and they were split right down the middle: 10 thought I had a scar, 10 didn't.  My neurologist was one of the doctor's who thought there was nothing, so we're going with him.  Basically, at this point I get to choose if I want to pursue surgery or not.  My doctor said I should definitely consider it somewhere down the line, but it's at least a 3 month process.  My seizures aren't too bad now, though, so I've decided to wait.  I don't want to put divinity school on hold.

Anyway, that's pretty much my life as of late!  I miss everyone at Olaf--I can't believe how fast 4 years go.  I'm really going to miss that place, but I feel so blessed to have the memories I do.  I think Missy Higgins sums it up best:

""The time has changed nothing at all-
you're still the only one that feels like home."""

"event","So I'm sitting on the 5th floor of the library in my favorite study spot, and I'm thinking about time.  I should be thinking about Gnostic Christology, but what can you do?  Anyway, I was sitting here thinking how, just a week and half ago, I was sitting in this exact same spot writing a different massive paper, and feeling like it would never be over...and it is.  And it feels like forever ago and just a blink away all at the same time.  But what's funny is that ALL of college feels that way to me right now.  I can't really see past this current paper right now, but I know that 6 days from now I'll be walking across a stage to accept my diploma from St. Olaf, and I'll be dying to be back here, on the 5th floor of the library, working on a paper I should've started way earlier.  As with every senior, I'm sure, the last week has been really reflective.  I find myself getting teary eyed and random points in the day...when I'm walking from one building to another, when I watch underclassmen packing up and leaving, when I sit in the corner booth of the Cage drinking coffee.  This place holds my memories.  I know I will die with missing my friends next year, but I really think I'm going to miss the actual physical place of St. Olaf a lot, too.  I can associate every nook and cranny of this campus with some moment of my life, and none of those moments are benign...they were all formative in some way or another.  That, coupled with this community of friends, is what makes St. Olaf my home, just as much as San Diego is.  I'm trying to take this whole experience as it comes; I don't want to deny and repress, even if it means feeling sad sometimes.  Leaving St. Olaf will be just as much a part of my Olaf experience as anything else.

Okay, so that's my reflective moment...otherwise, things in my life are AWESOME.  I have been up to a lot of crazy, fun things recently with crazy, fun friends :-)  Senior week will be fantastic once I finish this god forsaken paper.  And Tour Da Homes is so close on the horizon, I can taste it :-)  So life is good, friends!!  Love to everyone."

"event","Things are really interesting in my world right now.  Have you ever had one of those weeks where you just feel off?  I'm kind of there right now.  There are a lot of amazing things happening, though!  I went to Berkeley on Tuesday and had a really intense/incredible day at GTU.  It's an incredible, progressive, intensely God-centered school; basically everything I wanted in a Divinity school.  But it was really hard being there knowing that it was where I was going to be next year...and it really sunk in that I was leaving Olaf.  GTU is not Olaf AT ALL.  The people are fantastic there, and it's a really vibrant community, but it's just not Olaf.  I know that this isn't bad at all, and I'm not looking to replace Olaf.  But man, I'm going to miss this place.  The next three years are going to be really challenging for me, but I know overall that they're going to be incredible so I welcome whatever challenges are in store for me.

Aside from these cool developments, there's this anxiety that I can't seem to shake.  I had a really weird/emotional conversation with someone I really care about last night, and I don't know...we just never really got the closure we needed on some of the heavy stuff we were talking about.  We had to end the conversation for very understandable reasons (meetings and such), but left on the ""we'll pick this up later"" note.  But do people ever pick up those kinds of conversations?  Or do they use the break to act like the conversation never happened and go back to lighter interactions?  I don't want to let this go...but it takes two people to hold a conversation.  So it's in their court, not mine.  And I guess right now I'm just worried that I've shared the most uncensored contents of my heart with someone only to have them left behind."

I can't wipe this stupid grin off of my face :-)  Now, I'm still going to Berkeley next year, but wow...I just feel so blessed to have the options that I've been given.  I am so lucky, there's nothing I could've done to deserve any of this.  So seriously, God is amazing.  I owe all of this to Him, and the amazing people he's placed in my life to help me get here.  And man, I really especially owe this to NiNi--that woman wrote more recommendations for me than any one person should ever have to cover. 

In keeping with this happiness, I had an awesome weekend on Cantorei tour.  Even though the location was less than exciting (woooooo South Dakota), I had a blast with my fellow Cantorites.  We sound so good this year, and even better we have so much FUN together!  I'm going to miss everyone in choir so much next year...but I trust people like Lex, Elsa, and Julia to carry on the legacy :-)  There are no weak links in Cantorei, everyone just rocks.

So that's about all for today!  I hope everyone is hanging in there; whoever's reading this, rest assured that I'm probably thinking of you and sending you hugs :-)  Later!

P.S. Cantorei concert tonight at 7:30 in Boe...could be fun! :-)"

"event","So wow, it's been an insanely long time since I've updated this thing.  Life got way out of control (in a fantastic way) this year, so I've just been running around like crazy.  Where do I even begin?  We're going to have to go with a list (lame, I know), but it's the only way I know how to work this :-)

1) This is #1 for a reason: I'm officially going to Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley, CA to get my MDiv. next year.  I am so UNBELIEVABLY excited about this!!  Not only am I thrilled to be pursuing something that's been a dream of mine for the last 4 years, but it's such a relieving feeling in a way to know I'll be back in CA next year.  I miss that state so much, and I'm way excited to be closer to my brother, parents, and the ocean!  So in 3 years, if all goes according to plan, I should be ordained...scary though, huh? :-)   

2) I was an interim RA in Larson, which absolutely rocked my socks off.  It made me really regret not going back into Res. life this year.  The month was incredible, though, and I really miss doing it. Shout out to Larson 5th and 6th! :-) 

3) I almost put Divinity School on the back burner to go into Res. Life as an Area Coordinator next year...and I almost got hired.  I went to a Res. Life job fair, did 11 interviews in two days (craziness!!!), and Peace College in Raleigh invited me for an on-campus interview.  A week before the interview, though, I decided that I wanted to go to divinity school for sure and cancelled the interview.  But the experience of applying for jobs in Res. Life was amazing, and I know a part of me will always be sad I didn't do it professionally...but divinity school is just so right for me, I couldn't put it on hold.

4) I went to Hawaii for spring break!!  I went with my parents and the amazing Emily Strand, and I seriously had the most incredible vacation of my life.  I miss Hawaii so much!! :-(

5) I spent a week in the hospital for the same test I'd done three times before and HATED.  This one wasn't as bad as the previous ones, and we actually got a ton of new information to work with.  We're still doing tests and are seriously exploring brain surgery as my next treatment option, but we're doing it a pretty relaxed pace.  Seizures have levelled out at a very tolerable level, so I'm hanging in pretty well.  

So really, I think those are the main things that have gone on in my little life...aside from all of this, I'm doing everything I can to cherish my very last semester at Olaf.  I'm having the time of my life with my buddies -- I love you guys so much :-)  But now, it's daylight savings time, and I think I'd better get to sleep to compensate for that hour I'm losing.

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""A review of 2004!""> </P>
<P>1. Did u do anything new in 2004?<BR>Thank goodness the answer to this is yes...I've done SO many new things.&nbsp; I was a JC which rocked my world and brought on a whole boat load of new experiences.&nbsp; I'm a senior in college now, and I'm filling out grad school apps for the first time.&nbsp; I posed nude in an art project.&nbsp; I was in a dance performance.&nbsp; I ran for hall president and won!&nbsp; I took a musical theater class and loved it.&nbsp; I had my first legal drink.&nbsp; I participated in a lot of drunken shenanigans... hahaha :-)&nbsp; My gosh, there's just too much to list.&nbsp; So YES, I did a lot of new things in 2004.<BR><BR>2.

What was your biggest failure?<BR>As usual, I put too much on my plate so I'm not always able to be the best friend I can be to my friends in MN and CA...no matter what my interests are, they should always come first<BR><BR>10. Did you suffer illness or injury?</P>
<P>Holy crap, YES.&nbsp; Such is the nature of my life.&nbsp; There's no way to talk about my health without sounding morbid, but let's just say I'm not getting better, and things are pretty surreal right now.<BR><BR>11.

What do you wish you'd done more of?<BR>Haha, homework!!!&nbsp; I never study enough!<BR><BR>19. What do you wish you'd done less of?<BR>Worry, and waste time with certain people<BR><BR>20.

What was the best book you read?<BR>""Lies and the Lying Liars who Tell them"" and ""The Sprial Staircase""...oh, and ""Under the Banner of Heaven""<BR><BR>27. What was your greatest musical discovery?<BR>This may sound really corny, but my voice!!&nbsp; I really learned how to sing the way I've always wanted to this year.&nbsp; <BR><BR>28.

What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?<BR>I don't think you could ever know for sure...but I imagine if I didn't have seizures, things would've been a lot easier<BR><BR>33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2004?<BR>Hahaha this is such a dorky question...but I would say preppy, as usual.<BR><BR>34. What kept you sane?<BR>Having friends who really, truly, understand me</P>
<P><BR>35. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most?<BR>Ummmmm....dahh.......I really have no idea.<BR><BR>36.

Who was the best new person(s) you met?<BR>NINI, Rachel T. and Rachel V., Katie, the hall presidents and my acting for the lyric stage class<BR><BR>39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2004?<BR>I learned that life goes on after the one thing you thought would destroy you happens.&nbsp; I learned what it feels like to really love someone with all of your heart.&nbsp; I learned that all I have and all that ANY of us have is the present moment, so you've got to live it with all of your heart.&nbsp; I always knew it, but this year really confirmed for me that feeling hurt yourself is NEVER an excuse for hurting others...we are always affect the people around us.&nbsp; I learned that even in the midst of what doctors would describe as dying, there is still life.</P>
<P><BR>40. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year.<BR>""Something has changed within me; something is not the same.&nbsp; I'm through with playing by the rules of someone else's game.&nbsp; Too late for second guessing, too late to go back to sleep...it's time to trust my instincts, close my eyes, and LEAP.""&nbsp; Defying Gravity<BR></P>"

Not that my friends aren't allowed to have problems, of course...my goodness, stuff happens and you have to deal with it.  BUT I'm not going to waste my last year around the most amazing people I've ever met in my life on stupid crap.  End of story :-)

This being my last night at home, I thought I was going to make this a very reflective entry, but I'm finding I really don't have much to say.  This summer had a heart breaking beginning that I'm still processing, but in the end it was truly peaceful and wonderful.  I know I still have a lot to accept and work through, but it will come with time.  The scary realities of my life will never overcome all the GOOD in it, and that offers an amazing sense of security.  Really, it's hard to put into words what happened with my health and what it means...but that's okay.  I think it's fine if it just stays there, unspoken.

So here's to an amazing year, friends!  See y'all in Minnesota :-)"

Me: Mom, what are you doing?
Mom: Rubbing salt on my cut lip.
Me: OH MY GOD, why are you doing that?!?
Mom: To help heal it faster...you know the old saying, ""Salt heals all wounds.""
Me: Actually, that saying is ""Don't rub salt in open wounds.""
Mom: CRAP!

I love my mom :-)  Needless to say, life remains interesing here in San Diego!  I'm still feeling pretty sick from the medication increase, but by now I know all the tricks to help deal with easily.  The only foods I can eat without throwing up (and I mean ONLY...a stray wheat thin could ruin my day) are tuna sandwiches and boneless buffalo wings, which is SO odd.  But really, why mess with what works? :-)  Oh, and let us not forget the healing powers of diet coke.  Diet coke is my cure all.

Anyway, that's about all for now!  Really, all is well in my world, and I hope it's the same for everyone else.  Have a great day!"

To all of my Oles: you're AWESOME, I miss you TERRIBLY, and be prepared to be showered with love on September 6th :-) I can't believe it's been three months!!

Something that's going to make the wait a little easier is going to the cabin in Brainerd with my family and Brigit on the 2nd!  Before Brigit decided to come along, I was sure a couple days in MN not spent at Olaf was going to drive me NUTS...but Brigit will be wonderful to help me get through the wait.  AND, with her there, I don't have to spend much time with my relatives (thank goodness!).

Today was a very Ole themed day...talked to Sunny, T-dubs, and Brigit each for a couple hours, which was fabulous.  I started thinking about packing, which basically consisted of me opening my closet, grimacing at how much I have to pack, declaring that it's just not fair for Ytt. to have such tiny closets, and then closing the door.  Good enough for me :-)  The last couple of days have been a little rough because of the increase in my meds...I really haven't been able to eat since Thursday, and the double vision started today...but I'm sure I'll be fine by the time school starts.  2 weeks is more than enough time for me to get adjusted to the new levels.

Anyway, that's about it for me these days!  Hope everyone is doing splendidly :-)"

"event","Today was a really odd day.  It ended up good, but there were odd components...since I'm not feeling clever on organization, I'll just have to list them:

1) I'm increasing my medication again, which is both good and bad.  So apparantley, my tegretol levels in my bloodstream just spontaneously dropped from near toxic to way below normal, which thankfully explains all the random seizures I've been having recently.  It's easy to fix; we just increase the meds back to the max again.  And it's really nice to be having seizures and not be like ""duhhhh....don't know what to do about that.""  Easy, obvious solutions RULE.  It always weirds me out, though, when my levels just drop like that, because it's happened a few times before.  The real life equivalent would be if you filled up your gas tank, drove home, and the next time you started your car the gage would say you were almost empty.  You'd probably go ""What the...?"" too :-)  The only real danger from these random drops happening is that my levels would drop from normal to inactive levels, like it did in November.  Anyway.  That's weirdness number one for the day: the continued mystery of epilepsy and its treatment.

2) Crap, I already forgot weirdness 2...OH!  I remember.  So I went to see my trainer this afternoon.  In case I haven't told you guys about my trainer before, he is HILARIOUS.  He's a total caricature of the typical jock: rednecked, beer-drinking, dove hunting (which I give him hell about), politically incorrect, chauvanist jock.  We got along famously, though, because we're both fascinated with each other...I definitely don't let him get away with his gruff, macho tendencies, and he honestly doesn't understand why I'm so perky all the time :-)  Anyway!  So today I walked in complaining about my T-dubs, who had given me the ""results"" of the olympics I had yet to see tonight :-)  He told me they were fake, but i was still pissed off from the scare (and by pissed off, I mean not pissed off at all), so I was joking with Jason that I needed to kill one of my buddies back at Olaf.  We laughed at the image of me trying to take on Tyler for a bit, and then Jason turns all serious.  He leans in and goes ""Seriously...do you want to learn how to kill him?""  I think he's joking and laugh a little...and Jason says again ""No, seriously.""  Uh, no Jason.  Not up for killing any of my friends today.  Tyler insists I should've said yes, but I think I'm cool not knowing.  So that's weirdness number 2.

3) Weirdness number 3 is my parents, or perhaps adults in general.  So my parents got in this HUUUUUUUUUUUGE fight tonight (which, if you know my parents, is weird in itself) and somehow I got shoved in the middle of it as their mediator.  The weirdness moment happened when I realized, that as much as I wish it wasn't true, adults really don't completely outgrow petty arguments and childish behavior.  I know I still have my moments, but my parents were just being RIDICULOUS, making all these stupid junior high-esque jabs at each other, going for what hurt most rather than what would be most productive.  I pretty much knew this before, but it was a bit of an eye opener to see that even the most loving couples can act like prideful, idiotic kids sometimes...and how really, adults aren't a different, magical race of human being; they're just kids who've been on the playground a little longer than us.

4) Weirdness 4 isn't all the weird, but I thought it was really cool that Paul Hamm came back from last place to win the gold in the Men's All Around gymnastics tonight :-)  Go USA! 

Anyway, that was my weird day.  I hope everyone is doing wonderfully, wherever you may be!"

I can't WAIT to see all of my pod girls, and to have everyone (with the exception of my Res. Life friends) living in Ytterboe.  I can't wait to see my 4S girls!  I can't wait to see NiNi, and Heather, and even Pamela.  I miss my Olaf family, and just want to be back on the Hill with the Caf, Cantorei, the Commons, and even classes.  I am determined to make next year an AMAZING year.  I once declared a day of glory... next year is going to be the YEAR of Glory :-)

I think talking to T-dubs, Emily S., Mikey, and SUNNY! offset all of this yearning for Olaf.  And definitely seeing Brigit and K-nana in person.  Remind me never to take what I have in my Ole community for granted, okay?  All of you who may be reading this are nothing short of a gift from God.  

On a completely random note, if y'all want to see a scary movie, check out Open Water.  HOLY CRAP!  That is the most suspensful movie I've EVER seen.  And I can't wait to see it again! :-)

I would LOVE to live there (especially since I wouldn't need a car there), but it really all depends on whether or not I get into Union Theological.  Cross your fingers and say a few prayers, everyone!

Otherwise, live is going great.  I'm exhausted from the trip, it was the most active I've been all summer...up at 8 am and in bed by 2 am.  Not a typical Linz schedule :-)  My seizures have been the same (aka not letting up) so I'm definitely taking this week off to CHILL.  While I am getting so excited to go back to Olaf soon (I seriously can't wait to be back with my buddies), I'm also really nervous about how my health will hold up when I'm back to my school-year pace (which seems like a marathon pace sometimes).  I'm hoping my attitude that I have now towards my health and my seizures, a basically accepting, non-stressed approach, will keep up when I'm back to classes and insane schedules.  I hope my seizures won't get too bad, either.  I do know that this always works out somehow.  Thinking back to previous vacations and breaks, there were several where I really wasn't physically 100% ready to go back to school, but I did.  Namely beginning of junior year...I had 12 days to recover from video telematry, go through tegretol withdrawal, and adjust to a hot off the presses drug for which they barely knew the side effects before I had to be at Olaf for JC training.  And hey!  We all know how amazingly that worked out...I made it, and I had a great time.

Anyway, I always liked this girl, and we really didn't end on bad terms; I just stopped e-mailing her because I was so busy when college began.  I'm sure this hurt her feelings, and I've always felt bad for that.

My question is: do you think it was unfair for me to send her a super brief note just to let her know I had been thinking of her and hoped she was well?  My inner dialogue goes something like this: 

A) You should always tell people when you're thinking of them or that you care about them; we can't expect people to read our minds, and it's always such a surprise how many people DO actually think of you.

or

B) It's unfair of me to dredge up old friendships and memories that she might have put aside for good reasons; maybe hearing from me will have a negative effect on her.

"event","The coolest thing happened to me today...for 30 seconds, I was a licensed driver.  Let me explain:

So, my mom and I made the trek to the DMV today to FINALLY get me a California ID.  I've been lugging my passport around with me wherever I go and not only has that become a pain in the butt because it's not something you can just slip in your pocket, but it's also kind of nerve-wracking bringing your ONLY form of id with you wherever you go, be it airports or sleazy bars in Dundas.  Since epilepsy has obviously ruled out the possibility of a driver's license, we decided the CA id was the way to go.  Anyway, we make it to the DMV and start the process.  We had to go through a bunch of rigamarole assuring everyone and their brother that I am NOT applying for driver's license, I don't have any driver's licenses in another state, and I don't plan on getting any in the next year.  Basically my name comes up on the computer with a huge flashing ""NO NO NO NO!!!!  SHE HAS SEIZURES!!!"" (or something to that degree) :-)  So we finally make it through the process and I go over to get my picture taken.  The woman there snaps my picture, prints something out, staples it to my receipt, and hands it all over to me.  This is when it gets interesting....

Woman:  Here you go.  Congratulations!
Me: Um, thanks...?
Woman:  Was the test hard for you?
Me: Test?
Woman: You know, the test.
Me: (nervous) Oh my gosh, was I supposed to take a test to get a california id?
Woman:  (silence) wait...you're not here for a driver's license?

So then she turns totally white, rips the receipt out of my hands, tears off the little sheet she stapled to it, tears it up, and then just looks away, looking all uncomfortable and embarrassed.  I was totally confused and weirded out so I just left...and THEN realized she had given me a license by mistake.

There is only one word for that, my friends: HARDCORE! :-)  I had a driver's license for 30 seconds! :-)  If only I hadn't said anything, could you imagine the possibilities?  Nothing like beating the system to make your day, friends."

"event","Wow, I have a lot to update on!  So, let's see, it's been an AMAZING week and a half, largely due to the amazing friends I have in my life.  I think the best way to organize this is to just refer to said friends, so here we go :-)

Kristina-na: Kristina spent the last five days at my house, and it was AWESOME.  AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME.  That girl is a CA girl if I've ever seen one.  We had the best time chillaxing around my house, the beach, everywhere we went.  Highlights include our amazing (if slightly tipsy) jacuzzi conversations about life, God, friends, etc., our 7 hour trip to fascist valley that left a considerable dent in my credit card (""american express, meet fascist valley; fascist valley, meet my american express""), walks on the beach and breakfast at the potato shack, baking fests, and our HARDCORE day at Sea World (especially because our dear Kristina managed to offend not one, but TWO families of religious fundamentalists while we were there) :-)  I felt like I was on vacation at my own house, it was incredible!  So yeah, Kristina gets much love and adoration from CA (where she belongs, gosh darn it)

Sarah (Doobie): Okay, so we all know that Sarah has been like my sister for my whole life.  But this summer, she has been the most awesome, giving friend EVER, and not only because she drives me everywhere.  Our resident Kimmy Gibler (yeah Full House references!) joined me and Kristina for many of our ventures, and just brought her delightful sense of humor to every situation.  She screamed at Children of the Corn with me, mixed some killer drinks, drove us down to Fascist, drove us to frickin Sea World, and added to the ultimate HARDCORE!-ness of the whole trip.  Sarah is the only friend who will cry at the Shamu show with me, and we have the EXACT same sense of humor which is just awesome (Jesus surfs without a board, dude).  

Amber and Kristi: I LOVE THESE GIRLS!!  They are so distinctive and different, but compliment each other so well.  I love that they are there for me at every turn, and that we spent a whole day just baking and watching Will and Grace at my house.  Friends that you can unwind in front of are the absolute best.  They are the most giving, selfless, and understanding people I know, and they make my life both fun and meaningful.  I LOVE THEM!

Ashley and Sarah V.: So last night, I had the most fun, unexpected visit ever!  I can't believe that I haven't seen these girls for 2 years, because we had the most amazing time last night.  It was like we didn't stop laughing hysterically for 6 hours.  Watching old choir videos and pigging out at Applebee's ROCKS my socks off!

So yeah, that's been my life as of late.  Aside from that, I got offered a job, figured out the whole divinity school thing (things are looking up!), and while I continue to have seizures, well...sometimes it's okay in light of all the other cool stuff going on :-)  And by the way, to the friends I haven't seen recently: I MISS YOU ALL.  EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU!  Believe that.  Maressa, I hope we get to see each other sometime soon, and my Oles, I can't wait to get back in a little under a month!  Take care, guys :-)"

"event","Hokay. So.  I'm kind of pissed off at Divinity schools across the U.S. right now.  I've been spending a lot of time researching schools online, looking at programs and applications and what not.  I've narrowed things down to some pretty incredible schools that I'm really excited to apply to....BUT, I'm coming across this stumbling block in almost every application: the recommendations.  All but one school (my dream school, Union Theological, which also happens to be one the most competitive divinity schools in the country) requires at least one recommendation from a pastor or church leader who knows you very well.  

This makes me want to cry.  I'm sure it's not absolutely required (I've sent out some e-mails just to check), but if it turns out I'm at a disadvantage because I didn't grow up going to church, I am going to be so upset.  Not at my parents or God, because I LOVE how my faith came about.  I love that I discovered it (or that God led me to it) on my own in a really unique way, and I love that it has become the entirety of my heart and my life.  What upsets me is that institutions that are supposed to be paving the way for open-minded, educated, loving representatives and leaders seem to be automatically weeding out people who weren't ""called"" in the traditional way.  Yeah, my faith is young in comparison to some.  Yeah, I don't have the background of Sunday school, youth group, etc.  But sometimes, God's ambassadors aren't called by being born and bred in a traditional environment; my faith wasn't fostered by church leaders, but by friends, family, and ultimately God.  And I think the result is arguably the same as someone who has a pastor who can write them a letter of recommendation.

Argh, I'm so upset right now!  All I want to do is study religion.  I've known that for so long...it's so obvious to me.  Religion is just like breathing to me, it's what I DO.  It's the first thing I think about when I wake up and the last thing I think about when I go to bed.  I love both the academic and personal approaches to faith, and I want nothing more than to pursue those interests in graduate school.  But right now, it just feels like right off the bat I don't meet the requirements, and I hate that feeling.  

Anyway...that's my rant for tonight.  Otherwise, things in life are good; seizures have been kind of bad, but I'm still loving San Diego.  I know this little, tiny annoyance will work itself out...afterall, I have faith."

"event","I woke up on the wrong side of the bed today.  I had a kind of stressful day yesterday (stressed out for ridiculous reasons, really...just by a crowd of people in my house) and I just felt kind of foul and crabby today.  Have you ever noticed that when you feel the least bit stressed out, you take that opportunity to dwell on EVERYTHING potentially worrisome in your life?   After the crowd left my house, I got all stressed about what the hell I'm going to do with myself after I graduate, then I got upset about my health and how I have to plan my whole future around mass transit, and the last straw was that I baked muffins that tasted BEYOND bad.  However, that mood has since passed, and I'm now going to list all of the happy thoughts that led to the timely demise of my pouty phase.

HAPPY THOUGHTS:
1) An awesome trip to San Fransisco last weekend!  Highlights include an incredible visit with Steph Walker and shop, shop, shopping galore.
2) Kristina-na coming to San Diego next week!!!!!
3) Me going to New York in August to see Brigit!!
4) Talking to T-dubs tonight for what seemed like 5 minutes but was really two hours; have I mentioned how much I love that guy?
5) The brand new Jack Daniel's zippo lighter in my purse...ten bucks I'll be the only kid in divinity school with one of those :-)
6) Good advice from my father and T-dubs about what to do with my future
7) One seizure free day!!!!
8) Going gambling tomorrow
9) Having two really killer workouts three days in a row
10) Reality tv
11) Learning how to make my own Manhattans
12) And finally, my favorite happy thought memory; the memory that always cheers me up no matter what mood I'm in: sophomore year at Olaf, beautiful spring day, Wellstock, walking back from Old Main having turned in my final GCon paper listening to live music and watching everyone tossing frisbees to each other and being happy, and wearing the cutest little eyelet white skirt with a sparkly pink top and matching sparkly pink shoes :-)  It's the little things in life, friends."

Not because we hate the U.S., not because we're adamantly pro-gun control, but because we see an interesting problem underlying American politics.  Watching that movie, I was most strongly struck not by the fact that people can own semi-automatics (even though that's disturbing) or that the US has close to 20 times the amount of gun deaths a year compared to the paltry 65 in Canada (even though that's REALLY disturbing)...what struck me the most was how the movie revealed the internalized culture of fear in America.  At first, this seemed a moot point to me...people are murdered, planes crash into buildings, why WOULDN'T I be scared?  The world is a scary place, right?  Maybe not entirely.  But how come we don't get to see the rest?  How come I don't know another way to respond to national tragedies except with fear? I am going to ask a big what if question here: what if violence, namely militaristic violence, weren't an accepted norm in society?  What affect would that have?  What if pacifism were enforced in American government?  Not to say that the US has refused efforts to be peaceful in the past...but it is documented and shown that the US has funded and initiated unnecessary military violence, too.  If violence, war, weren't a part of my country's history and projected future, if it weren't my national means of security, would I be scared?  And would there be a reason to be scared?  Moving on, if people weren't scared, would they feel so compelled to defend themselves by keeping semi-automatics at the ready in their homes?

What I'm basically saying here is that, perhaps, I think the world is a scary place because I've internalized the ideals of violence and war that are inherent in my society, a society that is, of course, shaped profoundly by the acts of my government.  The possibility of a pacifist nation is worth considering.  

Obviously, one can tell I have EXTREMELY pacifist leanings :-)  If anyone who reads this is offended or disagrees, PLEASE COMMENT!  I am just beginning to solidify my own political opinions, and I would LOVE LOVE LOVE to hear arguments from the other side.  I won't be offended at all.

And even if, in the end, I decide Michael Moore is just a propagandist or just full of it...well, he made me think, and that's something, right?"

"event","An exchange between me and my cousin Bobby at a 4th of July party...

Bobby: This is an awesome party.  So, when do we get to light up some fireworks?
Me: We don't.
Bobby: Ohh...isn't that a big American thing to do on the 4th?
Me: It's illegal in California to use fireworks in private homes...we can have big displays downtown, but we can't have little fireworks at home.
Bobby:  Why not?
Me: Well, you know, it's dangerous...things exploding, fire, people could get hurt.
Bobby:  Okay, let me get this straight...you can't legally have fireworks because they're too dangerous, but you can get a liscence to own a semi-automatic in your home?
Me: (silence) Um, yeah.  That's right.

The wonders of American government as revealed to me by my cousin.

"event","What I thought would be an unwelcome invasion by relatives (my aunt and my cousin) has turned into a really wonderful visit.  My aunt and cousin from Japan are here visiting to look at colleges in CA.  I'm not particularly close to any of my extended family at all, but with this branch living in Japan makes it even harder to stay in touch.  Spending time with my extended family feels more like spending time with strangers.  But anyway.  My aunt Eri is fully Japanese (she married my dad's brother 35 years ago), and I realize how much I've taken this cultural diversity in my family for granted.  It was so amazing to talk with her today about her family's history, how they are in the line of Samurai's, and how they've lived in the same town with the same trade for 300 years.  I mean, that's longer than the US has even EXISTED.  It makes me want to take advantage of this opportunity and experience that lies within my own family.  My cousin, Bobby, is 17 now and he has grown up into an amazing young guy.  I haven't seen him since he was 13 and, well...he was a 13 year old boy.  Now, though, he's really easy to relate to; he feels like a friend.  I'm so impressed by everything he's accomplished in his life so far.  He's been going to an international school since he was a kid, so he's fully bilingual but he has the awesome dual-cultural perspective on everything that is really enlightening.  He's super excited about coming to college in the states.  He's certainly had a lot of battles to overcome, though...when he was 15, he was hardcore addicted to drugs and had to go to some serious rehab in Japan.  Now, though, he's on his way to graduating from highschool with amazing grades, and he had a very powerful conversion experience.  Another unexpected Christian popping up in my family!  He can play the guitar amazingly well, so we've spent the last two days singing praise songs together, working out our own songs, and talking about faith.  Neither of us are used to having another family member's faith to relate to, so it's been fun.  It's even been a blessing!

Anyway, happy 4th of July to everyone!  And by the way, I'm still looking for opinions on Faranheit 9/11...so let me know if you saw it :-)

P.S.  Many thanks to T-dubs for drunk-dialing me ;-)"

"event","I saw two really intense movies today: The Good Girl with Jennifer Aniston and Jake Gyllenhal, and Touching the Void, a documentary about mountain climbing.  Yeesh.  I watched both of these on a whole bunch of ativan, and I feel pretty loopy right now.  Twas a fun day :-)

I got to talk to my Brigman finally, so that definitely picked things up!  We talked about getting tattoos at the beginning of this school year, and I'm SO excited for that.  I still want to put some thought into it, but it's definitely not anything I have a problem with.  It seems like it would be an incredible thing to do together as friends.  I can't believe how quickly this summer is flying by!  I know the next couple months waiting to go back to Olaf might crawl, but the first part has gone by quickly at least.  So quickly I'm very behind in seeing the friends I need to in SD...Maressa, Amber, Kristi, and Sarah V., I will got on top of that (or on top of YOU ;-) ).

Seizures were pretty bad this week, so my apologies for lack of correspondence with anyone who may be reading this.  Like I've said in previous entries, though, when I have seizures at home it's not quite as devastating or frustrating as it at school.  At home, I can be on Ativan and having seizures, but I can do it lying by the pool getting tan :-)  It's all about multi-tasking.

Well, I'm going to put this very un-interesting entry to an end.  Life is good, friends; I hope it's the same for all of you!"

"event","I'm feeling pretty contemplative tonight, so I thought I'd take the opportunity to update.  Just to update, things continue to go wonderfully here in San Diego.  I'm still having a blast with my amazing family and friends.  There was a point last week where I was begging my mom to let me get a job just so I could feel like I was making some sort of contribution, but she stayed firm in light of my doctors request for me not to work this summer.  That said, I'm still happy to have the opportunity to just rest.

I've had a lot of time to think, of course, and that I've been doing in abundance about all sorts of things...I have a feeling that months from now, I'll look back on this period in my life, this summer, and remember it as one of the most peaceful times of my life.  It's too soon to put a lot of what I'm thinking into words, or to uncover a lot of what's going on in my heart right now, but I have confidence that whatever it is is closely linked to my relationship with God and my faith.  I feel like I'm changing; not necessarily becoming better, just becoming different.  This last semester and the medical events of late have really shifted my perspective; this, I think, is understandable.  I feel like I'm approaching life from a different angle now.  I spent 5 years living one way as a result of my health, whether or not I chose to ackowledge it...now that God has freed me from the medical track I was on, though, I think he's bringing me into a new stage of my life.  I mean, my health hasn't really changed.  I'm still having seizures.  They're about the same in severity and frequency.  It's amazing, though, how much the results of the PET scan and the doctor's prognosis has changed how I DEAL with them.  Right now, my life is full of a peace that can only be divine in its origin.  God is so real to me right now, and I'm so grateful that my faith has been made so present to me in a time that I think I may potentially look back on as a turning point in my young life.

One wonders if any of that makes sense... but hey, I'm not going for any awards here, just a little piece of what my reality is :-)  I hope everyone is doing wonderfully out there in the world...whoever is reading this, you completely rock because you make my life more full and more rich than I could ever deserve.  You're loved; don't forget it :-)

P.S. has anyone else seen Faranheit 9/11???  I saw it once, gonna see it again tomorrow, and I was beyond touched by it.  Let me know what you thought!"

"event","....unless you choose to write about it in your journal, of course :-)  So I just got back from a rocking weekend in an adult's DisneyWorld.  We were seriously only there for like 38 hours, but that's really all I can ever handle in Vegas.  That place boasts the very finest in instant gratitification, debauchery, and EXCESS....it even gets a little much for ME sometimes.  We stayed right on the strip as usual, and basically gambled and partied away.  It was awesome having my buddy Sarah with us this time, because while life is always fun with my parents, they definitely move at a different speed.  So Sarah and I partied like rock stars all weekend...have you ever done Jello shots at 11 am on a Saturday with your parents and family doctor?  Yes, friends, that is Vegas :-)

I have to say my favorite part about every Vegas trip, though, are the flights to and from Vegas.  Since Southwest offers 60 dollar round trip tickets to the blessed town, tons of San Diegans take weekend getaways there.  And believe me, the Friday night flight is HILARIOUS.  There isn't a kid to be seen on board the plane (which is basically a greyhound bus in the sky), and the party literally begins as soon as you take off.  I swear, everyone gets drunk before the 45 minute flight is over...it's like an airborne frat house.  Hilarious.  But the best part is the Sunday afternoon flight home to San Diego.  Picture this if you will: 100 or so adults who've been drinking and partying (and probably not sleeping) non stop for the last 2 days, all boarding a plane together on Sunday.  I like to play ""guess who has the worst hangover?"" on the Sunday afternoon flight :-)  THere a literally people slumped in the aisle even after the plane has landed.  So if you'd like to have some good ol' fashioned fun, I recommend a weekend getaway to Vegas (if only for the flights alone).

Other highlights from said vacation include going to an AWESOME comedy club last night with some amazing comedians.  Gambling, of course, was a blast, although I lost money overall.  Last night, Sarah and I stayed up as late as possible to fulfill our goal of being the most hungover people on the flight home...sadly (thankfully?) this goal was not reached.  Instead, we had an incredible time chilling in the lounges of various casinos, playing the tables at 3 am, and drunk-dialing our friends ;-)

Even amidst this decadence, though, you would be surprised at the places God shows up.  I sat down at this one table towards the end of the weekend, and there was only this one other college kid there.  Anyway, after initial introductions, me, the dealer, and said college kid launch into this INCREDIBLE discussion about religion; not just the theoretical stuff, but more our lived faiths.  I have to admit, I did feel pretty guilty sitting there gambling and talking about God...but the dealer especially was an incredible person to meet.  He's going to seminary and to pay his way through he's become a dealer...he figured, in that profession, he'd be able to meet some of the people who might need the most spiritual counsel.  Amazing.  I love just stumbling along cool people like that; it reminds me of how huge God's creation is and how rich the world can be.

Anyway, that's enough rambling for now...my bed is calling me.  Viva Las Vegas!"

"event","I haven't updated in awhile, so hey!  Here I am!  Things are going well here in San Diego; my summer has been AMAZING so far (knock on wood!).  I never characterized myself as surfer chick type when I was in high school, but lately I haven't been able to stay away from the beach.  I've been living in my tankini, shorts and flip flops, and almost had a transcendental crisis when I had to put on real-ish clothes to go out with my mom the other day.  I love California :-)  This quality CA time has made me realize that while I LOVE Olaf, I am so so so so so ready for city living again.  So graduate school will definitely be located on one of the coasts; we're saying bye-bye to the midwest after next year.

All of this time on the beach has given me quality time to think over everything that's happened health-wise.  And you know what?  I feel great.  In the long run, I know I've received some really bad news; maybe not bad, uncomfortable.  It's uncomfortable to be out of medical treatments when I'm still having uncontrolled seizures.  However, the fact that my doctors are out of treatment methods for me means that they are FINALLY off of my back!  For the first time in 5 years, I'm not being fiddled with!  It took me that long to go through every nook and cranny of the realm of neurological treatment, and even though we didn't come out with the results we had wanted, I am DONE (for now).  Do you know how freeing that is??  I know my situation will change in the future, but at least I'm not in limbo right now.  Right now, I know I live with uncontrolled seizures; right now, I know I can't predict ANYTHING about my health in the future; as my doctor so eloquently said over the phone, ""your future is a void, Lindsey; there is absolutely only way you can live: in the present.""  But, really, who CAN predict their future?  I don't want to demean the significance of what I'm going through, but when it comes down to it, nobody's life is predictable.  I just have a medical report authorizing that fact.

In light of that, the oddest thing happened: for the first time in years, I actually started thinking about my future.  I often told my friends that I couldn't think about my future because of my seizures and my medication; I couldn't think about it because I was so scared that someday we would run out of options for treatment and I'd be lost.  Well, I'm there now.  We've run out of treatment options, but I'm NOT lost.  I figure I have two options: I can mope about the fact that other people can make plans for themselves grounded in traditional concepts, or I can dream about the rest of my life, keeping in mind that nothing is for sure.  The latter is much more fun, isn't it? :-)

Anyway, that's what I'm thinking about these days.  Hope it's not just the sun getting to my head :-)"

"event","As most of you know by now, we got the results of my PET scan...sadly, they didn't find anything on the scan.  This was the bad news. So, I won't be having brain surgery this summer, and at this point we're out of options for a cure or treatment if my condition changes at all.  The implications of this are, of course, pretty dramatic, but not something that's really appropriate to write about...y'all know what it means.  

In light of all this, though, I can HONESTLY say that I'm doing okay; great, in fact.  This is entirely due to the fact that I am surrounded by the most amazing group of friends EVER.  I'm talking in the history of mankind here :-)  The phone calls, the letters, the messages, the hugs, the dinners, the shopping trips...seriously, it's the difference between my feeling totally discouraged and being able to pull myself up by the bootstraps and move along with my life.  To quote LOTR III: ""You looked into my future and saw death.  BUT THERE IS ALSO LIFE.""  I hate to quote movies, but yeah, I just went there :-)

Anyway.  Back to why you all rock.  Thank you to every single one of my friends, those who are reading this and those who aren't, because I am so blessed to know each and every one you.  Words just aren't enough, so we're gonna have to leave it this: I LOVE YOU :-)

Times like this in my life also do wonders to crystallize my faith.  I never ask God ""why?"" in these situations, but I often ask ""how?""  I feel more secure in my faith and relationship with God than ever, which is something I'm SO grateful for.  Yay God!

Anyway, that's all for tonight folks."

I gave her a gift (that had absolutely nothing to do with the celebration of the day of her birth, of course ;-) ): tickets to see the Ryan Seacrest show in L.A.  She is in LOVE with Ryan Seacrest, as I am as a die-hard AI fanatic, so she was super excited.  Yay anything having to do with AI!! :-)  After that, I cooked her a killer dinner with the help of Huggles, and life was good.

I started Olaf-izing my rooms today, FINALLY.  Since this is my first summer home since first year, I really don't have many pictures or knick knacks around my rooms today that have much to do with Olaf.  I mean, I still had pictures from my freshman and sophomore year of high school hanging with people I haven't even seen since my graduation- GAH!  It was so time for a change.  Now my study is thoroughly UM YA YA-ed out, so it's on to my bedroom.  Rock.

P.S. I have the best dentist in the world.  Seriously.  I actually ENJOYED having fillings done today.  They drug the bejeezus out of you and play soft, soothing music throughout the whole thing, and have pictures of flowers flashing on a computer screen above your head.  I don't think many people can say going to the dentist was relaxing, but oh yes, I can :-)  Also, I had therapy again for my busted arm, and I had the hottest physical therapist EVER.

This evening, my brother and I went to see ""Super Size Me"" which was definitely entertaining, but really lacked the intelligent analysis I was hoping for.

It's appropriate in a weird, sort of transcendental way, because I always do feel like I'm in a duel with my doctors (even though this one is AWESOME).  So yeah...I'm feeling a little bummed out right now.  The last week has been amazing, I realize, because for the first time in awhile I've been totally separated from the medical realm.  I left MN thinking ""okay, I've done everything I can at this point, the rest is up to you guys.""  Now, it's time for me to get back in the loop and start taking some big steps in controlling my own wayward health.  On a side note, I know this is good in the long run...I know this is what I need to do, and I will do it.  But this week was just so amazing!  I mean, I still had seizures, but it didn't feel like every seizure was a strike against me, or like there was some transcendent clock ticking the whole time.  I just lived, with seizures, and for a week it felt like I wasn't on the downhill.  I know that wasn't meant to last forever, because it certainly wouldn't have...but man, it was nice.  In the long run I want to be informed about my health, and I really do want to be proactive and involved with getting better, but it was such a treat to be separated from my doctors for a bit.

"event","1,000 points to last night for rocking tremendously.  10,000 points for all of the people there who made it rock just that much :-)  Amber, Kristi, and Ryan and I met up at an awesome Irish pub in Escondido for some quality bonding last night, and man, was it quality.  I've missed those guys!  It was so fun to knock back a few drinks with my girls and giggle about our high school days, reminiscing about high school drinking days which usually involved watching our peers make jerks of themselves and try to fly (amongst other things).  Can I say how much I love those girls?  Because seriously, Amber and Kristi have stuck by me since I was a little 14 year old, through musicals and horrendous theater classes, through my very first seizure, through my moving to a cornfield in MN and sucking at keeping in touch...but even after all this time, sitting down next to them last night felt like we'd never been apart.  I LOVE that about them.  I love how beautiful and spiritual and hilarious and intellectual they both are, and both in very distinctive ways.  Man, rock on to Kristi and Amber! :-)

So yeah, it was a good night last night.  I've decided that pubs are totally my venue of choice; they're just so jolly :-)  And after the pub adventure, it was awesome to meet some of Amber's friends and go hang at their apartment.  We even got in a killer religious discussion!  Seriously, last night was awesome.

I did enjoy today, as well.  I went and saw my grandmother's new apartment (she just move to San Diego), and then had my first physical therapy appointment to fix my busted shoulder.  OW OW OW OW OW; I do know the pain will be worth it, though.  I finally got all the boxes I shipped to myself from Olaf today, so now I have TONS more unpacking to do.  Oh well, I have to admit I enjoy going through all the stuff I've accumulated in a year...it's kind of like closure on the year, in a strange way.

So that's about all of my random ramblings for now.  I hope everyone else is doing wonderfully! :-)"

"event","A conversation tonight....

Me: So Adam, what did you think of that movie?
Adam: I liked Independence Day better when it had aliens.
Me: We just saw ""The Day After Tomorrow""...
Adam: Oh. Same thing.

That basically sums up my take on the lovely smorgasbord of a disaster flick we just saw.  It was all good fun, but yep.  It definitely would've been more fun with aliens.  

p.s. I miss everyone in Minnesota.  I'd forgotten what it felt like to miss you folks with all of my heart!  I'm so not used to being apart from the Ole crew anymore.  Let it be known: you guys are loved :-)  
p.p.s. I'm SO excited to catch up with SD buddies I'm far too used to being apart from.  Here's to Wednesday, Amber!! :-)"

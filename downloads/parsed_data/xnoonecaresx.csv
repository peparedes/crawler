"event","another boring day.  sat at home, listened to music, played nintendo.  the usual.

this friday is going to be a lot of fun.  american nightmare and black cross at krome.  although, i would rather go see fanshen, kill crush destroy, and for all time at steves basement. but it's way too far away.

i still cant believe how good the show was yesterday."

"event","hmm..today in general was pretty uneventful.  i spent alot of time on the computer, playing guitar, and playing super mario kart.  im getting pretty good at mario kart.  im on 150cc, which is like impossible.

im supposed to be reading ""the catcher in the rye"" in american studies.  but i have decided that i am not going to read it.  i know you are probably all saying ""you dumbass, that book is so good, read it.""  im sure it is a good book, and im sure ill read it someday, but theres just something about being told how many pages to read, then writing a summary on what i read, then making group questions based on the reading that pisses me off.  so therefore, i wont be reading.  i bought cliffnotes, i'll be reading those.

i think im a little too excited for saturday."

"event","first entry, not much to talk about.  today was pretty shitty, nothing special happened.  except in chemistry we had a fire drill which wasted like 15 minutes of class time.  sweet!

tomorrow i think im hanging out with joe, im not sure what we are doing yet, he mentioned something about a party.

ENSIGN AND MODERN LIFE IS WAR ON SATURDAY
i can't wait.  that show is going to ruuuuuuuuule.  and it's at the westfield church.  how often do you get to see ensign in a church?  thats what i thought.

yeah, i'll update later."

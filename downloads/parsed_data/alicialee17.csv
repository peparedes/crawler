"event","Its been a long time coming..almost 5 years in the making...actually...more.  The one morning that changed my life forever.  When my mom first met him in the 8th grade, she said, ""You should marry him, Alicia Lee.""

It started out like our previous trip to Brian's uncle's beach house on the private beaches of bethany.  I head over to Brian's house Saturday morning around 5am.  We pile everything into the cars.  Brian's family jumps into their van and he and I get into my car.  I remember the car ride in a different light knowing the outcome.  It was so comfortable w/him, driving for 9 hours: sing, being goofy, so free to be myself.

We got to the beach house late in the afternoon.  After everyone brought their stuff in, the lot of us head to the beach.  It was just as beautiful and peaceful as I remembered it.  I was wondering what morning I would go down with Brian to see the sunrise.  He walks down every morning to see it rise.  He always asks everyone the night before if they want to go down.  I was exhausted from the drive down.  I went to bed around the same time as some of the other people -  and now that its apparent, I don't remember Brian asking about the sunrise for the next morning.

Around 5:30am Sunday morning I feel a gentle shake and hear Brian saying, ""Lish, c'mon lets go see the sunrise on the beach.""  Now work w/me here... I got up the previous day at 5am to drive for the better part of 8 hours.  I was tired!!  .. and in a state of goofy-grumpy.  So I tell him how tired I am and that I will go see the sunrise on a different day.  He keeps saying, ""Oh c'mon."" and ""You'll thank me for it later.""  me: ""I will not thank you for it later!""  So he rips the covers off of me.  OMG I was FREEZING!!   They had cranked the air conditioner to like -40 degrees that night.  I give in and tell him to go get me one of his shirts to put on.  

So we start to walk down to the water w/his brother and his girlfriend (now fiancee).  As we're going down there I say, ""As soon as I take some pictures, I'm leaving and going back to bed.""  He says, ""Oh, you won't be able to go back to bed!""  I say in a half hysterical voice, ""Oh yes I will!""

We get there moments before it rises.  I must say it was the most beautiful sunrise I ever saw.  So after we snap some photos, Brian says, ""Do you want to take a walk down the beach?""  WHAT?!  ""ummm..NO -  I'm going back to bed!""..and then I start to walk w/him..lol

We walk down closer to the water.  I was very beautiful and peaceful with no one else around.  The sand felt nice and cool on my feet.  THen we got too close to the water and I got wet and it was cold so I wasn't happy! lol

We walk a bit more and he says, ""Hey, how would this do for a promise ring?""  He's holding a dollar bill that he folded into a ring.  The number one is on top to mock the diamond.  I just give a nervous laugh and say ""no"" through my giggle.  He really caught me off guard!!  I remember lookin away from himto the ocean and thinking, ""wait til I tell Mom he tried to give me a dollar bill for a promise ring!""  But then he says, ""Well, then how would this do?""  I turn to find him holding a diamond ring in his fingers.

I froze.  I kept repeating, ""Is this real?"" and brian kep saying, ""yes this is real!""  Then he takes my hand and steps in front of me.  Then he gets down on one knee and proposes, ""Alicia Standish, will you marry me?""  I stand there in complete shock and repeat again, ""Is this real?"".  I look at him and he tilts his head as if to say ""well?""  His eyes were glossed over and complete joy filled.  I said in my hysterical voice, ""Will I marry you?! Of course I'll marry you!!""  He puts the ring on my finger and stands up and we embrace and he spins me in the air and we kiss.

I loved everyone's reaction to our news when we got back.  From my parents to everyone at soccer to everyone at work  and the PTI people.  THe plans are most certainly in full swing.  I have my dress ordered and I've picked out the bridesmaids dresses.  The party is fully planned.  THe hall, church, caterer, and photographer is booked.  We've got our share of engagement gifts and cards =). I have my color picked out and my hairdresser is booked.  The honeymoon has been chosen and we LOVE it!  Im so glad its not the beach or a hotel..everyone does that and its so bored and tired.  We are geting our own chalet..weeeeee!!!  We've picked our song and I picked the song for my dad and I.  When he listened to it he started crying and so did my gram.  I remember that perfectly too.  I had the song on my iPod and let my gram listen to it.  She started crying and said my dad was going to cry.  I, and the rest of my family, doubted it.  My dad the biker and truck technician who is always in a hurry and never has time.  He came in my grams the next morning and I asked him to listen to the song I picked out.  I expected him to tell me he didn't have time.  But he came in and sat down.  After the first few lines I looked over at my gram and she had started to tear up.  I smiled and said ""oh dont"" under my breath.  Then she looked at dad again and I did and I saw it...my dad's tears over the song and all that it means.  I hug him and he starts sobbing a bit and I start to tear up.

So, as you can tell, I've been busy. So I apologize for not updating.  I have left a lot out of here, but dont think my life has been all wedding.  True its a big portion of it..but Ive been having the time of my life as well.

So there you have it.  everyone waits for that person that they can call the one.  most of the time its empty.  GIrls write Sue and Bob always and forever...but by the next year they are no longer together..or they constantly fight and break up.  This has never been the case with me and brian.  Now I can write everywhere..Alicia and Brian always..its no longer a dream in the waiting...

our future is in the present tense..

"event","On June 21, 2005, I lost my grandfather, Eli Standish.  A grandfather that I was incredibly close to.  I didn't call him 'grandpa'.  He wanted my sister and me to call him 'Popop', so we did.  For the past 7 years, he was stricken with alzheimers disease.  No its not oldtimers disease.  Its a very serious disease.  At the beginning of this month, Popop was in the hospital for pnuemonia and congestive heart failure.  He pulled through and was realeased after a weeks stay at Uniontown Hospital.  Then, the next week, he was re-omitted because the anitbotic they gave him for pnuemonia caused an infection which caused diahhrea which caused severe dehydration.  This, sadly, takes a hard toll on a man of 86 years.  God, I'm starting to cry already.  But I need to tell my story as I remember it now.   And now the story of last week begins...

<b>Monday, June 20, 2005: A Missed Chance</b>
I didn't have work today because I had training at the omni william penn hotel downtown.  I truly enjoyed myself.  I LOVED walking around downtown and everything.  Its so nice (where I was).  Even if guys hit on you, its just a nice place.  
After work, I met Kati, Bill, and Dan at station square.  We had free tickets to the Pirates game.  As Im walking to meet them, Sam calls.  She asked what I was doing and I told her.  She said that the hospital called in the family for Popop.  I stopped in the middle of the sidewalk and turned back towards my car.  I tell her I'm coming home and mom gets on the phone.  She tells me that Popop isn't that bad, and that he would rather me stay and watch the game.  This, I know is true, my grandpa was an true Pittsburgh fan, and would have wanted me to see the game.  Furthermore, he wouldn't have known I was there, for the past couple of years, he has basically forgotten most of those in this time.  His mind wanders through time and stops in whatever year it can.  However, he would every once in a while, ask me where i was staying and how my car was running.  It would be the same questions and I gave the most recent answer, knowing within five minutes it wouldn't matter because his mind just wasn't strong enough to hold on to it.  In any case, I tell my mom I would come home tomorrow (tuesday) after work to see him.  I was going home wednesday as well for the soccer draft.  As the game goes on I keep thinking about my grandpap.  He's been in the hospital before, but this time I just couldn't stop thinking about how he was doing.  Brian was on vacation and called and I told him.
This was to be my grandfather's last full day of life..

<b>Tuesday, June 21, 2005: A Day Too Late</b>
I looked forward to being able to walk around downtown again bc I had orientation again.  The training started at 9 and our first break was at 10:15am.  About 9:45 the receptionist comes into the room.  Our instructor, Elizabeth, asked if the receptionist needed anything.  As the receptionist walks to the front of the room she says, ""I have a message for one of the guests.""  Immediately my heart stops and I sit straight up and hold my breath.  My first thought was that it was my mom calling to tell me my grandfather passed away.  The receptionist says, ""Its for Alicia Standish.  Her boss, Karen Sturgeon wants her to call her ASAP.""  I look at my co-worker and we both just laughed.  I felt better, but didn't call right away.  I was going to wait until our break.  We were finishing up a lesson so I thought I would just run out and call her real quick.  I called her and she answered the phone.  I said, ""Oh Karen, you gave me a scare there.  Last night they called the family in for my grandfather bc hes in the hospital and I thought you were my mom calling to say he passed away.""  She was quiet for a moment and then said, ""Alicia, you're mom did call this morning.  I'm so sorry, he passed away this morning.""  I put my head and my hands and started to cry.  She said, ""Alicia, I'm so sorry.  Go ahead and leave training.  GO to your apartment and get your clothes and whatever you need.  Don't rush home bc there's nothing you can do now.  If you need to release anything do it at ur apartment.  Whenever you find out about the services, let me know.""  I hang up the phone and go back in to collect my stuff.  the instructor rushes over asking if I had to leave.  She saw me crying and asked if everything was OK.  I choke out, ""grandfather..passed away""  She told me I could retake the class and I left.  Walking out on the streets that I loved walking yesterday.  Today Im crying uncontrollably.  I call home and tell them Im coming.  I call Brian and tell him.  I call my cousin Ryan and tell him.  I called Kati to let her know I wouldn't be meeting her for lunch today. She's at the apartment and gives me a hug.  I get clothes together for the service and am on my way.  

Once I get home mom gives me a big hug.  Sam has isolated herself.  I go in her room and shes crying under her blankets.  The TV and the radio were on, but I doubt she was paying attention to either.  She was at the hospital earlier but couldn't bring herself to go back in his room.  She just wanted to be alone.  Bubs (my gram) told me that they got the call to hurry to the hospital at 8:30.  Bubs called dad and they rushed up there.  Bubs said on the way she was crying out, ""Dont leave yet Eli! We're on our way! Just wait a little longer!""  As they headed towards his room a nurse came out and said he took his last breath a minute ago.  They had just missed him.

Brian got home after midnight and came right over to bubs house and stayed there w/me until 6:30 Wed. morning.

<b>Wednesday, June 22, 2005: Preparation</b>
The funeral plans were made: Viewings: Thursday 7-9pm, Friday 2-4 and 7-9pm with church services at 11am on saturday.  My grandfather had two sisters from outta state that i barely know.  He also has a good for nothing daughter who didn't even have the decency to even want to know if her father died.  To her, I FUCKING HATE YOU.  You are a worthless piece of shit who didn't deserve him as a father.  Get over yourself and the past.

Me and bubs went to buy the clothes popop would be buried in.  Brian was with me every moment he wasn't working.  It really helped too.  The food started coming in today, and we started keeping track of that.  My cousin Patty came in and we stayed at bubs house every night.  I went to walmart w/patty and printed out pictures that I wanted to place in the casket to be buried with popop.  As the night faded, I started to fear tomorrow.  

<b>Thursday, June 23, 2005: The First Viewing</b>
My cousin Ryan and his parents came over today before the viewing.  So did my uncle albert.  There were so many people that it made it impossible to think about the upcoming viewing. There was a private viewing only for the family at 6:30.  When only ryan and his parents were left, it started to hit me hard.  My eyes kept welling up and I had to keep blinking.  Patty noticed and asked me if i was getting nervous.  All I could do was shake my head, ""yeah"".


At 6:30 we pulled into the funeral home parking lot.  As we were walking up the ramp to go in, my eyes were burning from trying to fight back tears.  We walk through the rooms that seemed endless.  Then we entered the room I knew he was in.  He was around the corner.  My dad and bubs went up first.  The sound of my dad crying like that, the sight of it, is something you'll never forget.  I turned the corner and as soon as I got that glimpse of him from the side I started crying.  There he was.  My grandfather.  The man I had always thought of as unbreakable, strong, and loving.  Lying cold and motionless in a casket surrounded by flowers that said, ""husband"", ""pap"", and ""popop"".  I started to place the photos I had brought in his casket and had a hard time putting them in straight.  My dad whimpered that he needed his baseball caps he was notorious for wearing. It reminded me of the funeral scene in ""My Girl"" where Vada says that Thomas J needs his glasses, ""He cant see without his glasses!"" Sam didn't even make it to the casket.  She went two rooms over and cried in a chair. She wanted to be alone.  As each of the plentiful guests poured in to pay their respect, I cried even more as each got to the casket.  Sam came in and out, never once making it to the casket before going away crying.  We were both very close to him, but she was his baby.  I went up to my grandfather again by myself and just couldn't stop crying.  It was so odd to see him there.  Him, MY popop!  My grandfather that I had dreams about dancing w/at my wedding.  The guy who taught me to wrap coins and kola.  The guy who helped me steal the show at a wedding when I was not even 7 years old by dancing with me.  I kept looking at him and telling him how much I missed him and I loved him and that I was so sorry for not coming Monday night.  Telling him and praying to God that I was heard.  

Three of my co-workers came that night, Stacey, Chuck, and Jo.  It helped so much to see them.  I was crying when they found me.  They met me with sympathetic hugs and warming smiles.  I introduced them to my family.  It helped to have them there.  We talked about other things than the current situation and it helped to get my mind off of it.

After everyone had left (close to 9:15).  We all went up one by one to say our goodbyes.  Dad choked out that he would bring him his caps.  We all left the room and thats when sam came in.  I watched from around the corner as she made her way up to the casket and cried.  She cried and cried and then went and sat in the chair and cried some more.  

<b>Friday, June 24, 2005: The Last Viewing at the Funeral Home</b>
The sessions today weren't as bad as yesterday.  Megan Smiley came to visit me and I appreciated it so much.  She was the only one from AG that came.  Amber called me and sent her apologies.  My boss, Karen and Monika came as well.  It helped to see more people I know, to take my mind off of tomorrow-the burial.

I got through both viewings with only a few sobs.  Afterwards, just as the night before, a ton of people went to bubs house to eat.  Both nights I was up until at least 1:30am only to get up at 8:30am the next day.  Brian was with me yet again.  Once in bed, the harsh realization of what Saturday held came to me.  The last time I would ever see my grandfather again.  The last time I could feel like what I said actually went through.  I cried myself to sleep.

<b>Saturday, June 25, 2005: The Final Farewell</b>
Brian met us at the church at 11am and sat with us in the first pew of the church.  Bubs started crying as soon as she saw popop.  I looked at him once and felt my eyes tear up and my throat ached in pain.  I purposefully postioned myself to not look at him.  I just couldn't take that feeling.  I kept my mind preoccupied by deliberately NOT thinking of what would happen in about an hour.  I sat there, waiting for the church to fill up (and it did) just looking at the icons and beauty I had missed of that church.  Then it was time for the services...

They went on as most church services do, blessing of everything, singing, praying.  Then they read his eulogy and the words broke the barrier I had worked so hard to put up for the past hour and a half.  And it read, ""Eli survived by his wife Marcella. ...  His son Eli and his wife Tammy brought great joy to his life when they gave him two granddaughters, Alicia and Samantha.""  With those words, ""brought great joy to his life when they game him two granddaughters..""  I burst open.    He's gone and I won't get to see him again after this afternoon.  Brian grabbed my shoulders and tried to comfort me.  Then it was time to pay last respects.  When father said, ""and give him his last kiss..""  I knew it was it.  We got to go last.  I went first and just cried so hard.  I grabbed a hold of my grandfather's stiff, cold arm and squeezed.  Like if I squeezed hard enough he would come back and this pain could cease.  I couldn't see my eyes were so filled.  My throat throbbed so bad I thought it was bleeding.  It seemed like no matter how hard I cried the more I still felt that deep pain.  The pain of knowing that he's not coming back.  I gave him one last kiss that was full of tears and love.  I had to move to the side so that the rest of my family could see him.  As I went back to the pew, Brian stood up and held me so tight.  I cried and cried on his shoulder.  Then after my gram gave her last kiss, everyone stood.  The funeral director came over and began to close the casket.  I was so torn between not wanting to watch because it was too hard and then wanting to look to keep him burned in my mind.  Then we all left the church to walk over to the cemetary.

I drove in the car with bubs, brian, sam and patty.  We followed the hearse over and pulled right behind it. I could see the American flag spread out across his casket in the back of the hearse.  There were chairs set up next to the casket.  The flowers that were from all of us husband, pap, and popop were placed right next to the casket.  My mom, dad, sam, and bubs and popops two sisters sat in the chairs.  I stood behind bubs and sam and held on to their shoulders. Brian was right behind me holding on to mine.  We were all crying during the prayers from Father and the salutes from the amvets (veterans, my grandfather served in WW2, so he had a military service).  When Father placed the three scoops of dirt on top of his casket I started crying.  I kept staring at the flag covered casket, wishing that if I stared hard enough, my eyes could burn through and see him again.  I knew he was lying there, inside, but I couldn't do anything.  

The veterans folded the flag into a triangle.  One got on his knee and presented it to my grandmother.  I thought that was the end and I got a little upset that he didn't get the 21 gun salute or the taps.  I knew it would be sad, but he deserved it.  Then I looked over my shoulder and saw them raise there guns.  I turned back around and heard the 3 rounds of each gun go off.  Then the taps started playing.  I started crying even harder and squeezed sam and bubs shoulders a bit.  Brian grabbed me because I was crying so hard.  I had used all of my tissues and just couldnt stop.  Taps now have a new meaning to me.  I won't ever be able to listen to them again without crying.  They are so emotional.  I stared at the casket through tear filled eyes and tried to keep my cries quiet even though the pain was so immense I wanted to collapse.  Then we all went up to put the flowers on the casket.  My dad barely got out, ""I love you Pap.""  As I placed mine on the casket I cried out, ""I love you Popop.""  My sister and I were the last ones to leave.  Sam went in the car and I stayed a bit longer, just crying.  They didn't lower the casket until after we left.  

Seeing someone you love that much, that you think that highly of, that is so close to you in that state does something to you.  You wish you had the impossible powers to turn back time and hope that things turn out differently.  Wish that you would have went home that Monday to see him, but the guilt will always be there.  I know being there wouldn't have changed anything for his condition, but at least I could have seen him, told him while he was living the things I said when he wasn't.  I know he knew how much I loved him, I always told him and always gave him hugs and kisses everytime i saw him.  I know it will get better, my pain that is, but right now it is incredibly intense.  I cried while writing most of this.  That overwhelming pain is still there.  My comfort lies in knowing that his suffering has come to an end (I'm told it was horrible for him at the end) and that he is in a much better place.

I thank everyone who sent their condolences, it means a lot.  And I thank Brian so incredibly much for never leaving my side during the whole thing.

Two extremely good things have happened since Tuesday: 1. Wednesday morning, bubs got a phone call there her liver biopsy came back good.  She said my Popop did that for her.  and 2.  when I came back to work on Monday I had a letter in my mail box.  I have been placed into the <b>Who's Who in the Metropolitan Area of Pitsburgh, PA</b>!!  How about that, lil ol' lisha lee from collier, PA has made a name for herself in Pittsburgh, PA. I was approved on May 27, but didn't receive the letter until this monday.  I thank Him for that, giving me and my family something to smile about after such a horrible week.

There were a few funny things that happened during last week, and they did help.  One was Brian walking in on bubs while she was using the bathroom.  and while running out he ripped the door frame off..LOL.  Luckily for the both of them she stopped him before he saw anything.  

I have to go to bed now..im extremely tired and it is now 10:10pm.  I need to catch up on my sleep i lost from last week.  Im off friday and monday for the holiday.  Sams graduation party is saturday and our first soccer game is on sunday at 4pm.

goodnight all.


RIP Popop.

so im not going to talk much about much bc theres too much to catch up on..i had a great time in florida w/dani..the airplane and disney and driving back up and the numerous hotels..LOL!!  oh and mating trucks, yes.

But i do have to give this update about brian just bc he never fails to amaze me even after 4 years.  So last thursday brian came to pitt. to take me to the airport.  well see, even to this day, when he leaves to go home, i cry sometimes. I just hate being away from him and i miss him so much.  Well, you can only imagine what it was like at the airport. OMG! every 5 minutes I was running into the bathroom to cry..i mean really cry!  My eyes were so red and i just seriously thought I wasn't going to be able to stand there and watch him walk away.  Everytime I visioned it i started crying harder.  My chest hurt so bad I couldn't believe it.  I kept thinking, ""Ok, pull it together"" and id go out into the corridor and start crying again. lol.  So when he left he had the keys to my apartment bc he had to go get my hamsters and take them to my mom.  Well, he ended up going to the store and buying me the mega cute stuffed animal (so soft!!) and then printing out pictures of me and him from his camera, bought a frame and put the pictures in the frame.  So when I came in and opened the door into my room, a stuffed animal was sitting on my bed w/a picture frame w/a pic of me and my bb in it.  HE IS INCREDIBLE!! i just LOVE him to bits!!

IM SO GLAD DANI IS BACK!!!!

So much has happened between then and now that i dont even know where to start.  I had an extremely important phone call one sunday.  after that conversation was done, my life changed forever.  The lives of everyone around me have changed forever.  For those of you who know..thank u for helping me with it.  Dani-ur the first person to know..and if this was something different, u and brian would have been the only ppl to know.  Thank u so much for helping during all of this..

So now on to this weekend which is basically what i wish to speak of:
<b>Thursday</b>
I picked up brians dad from work at mellon bank downtown and we drove to dave and busters to meet brian and the rest of his family.  I hit the jackpot two times that night! it was SWEET! lol i love that place.  still trying to get RYAN (IRON) ORR to come! lol  anyway, after that we went to olive garden in green tree to eat.  oh yum! hehe.  



<b>Friday</b>
Background info: This is the day of Sams prom.  For ALL of her formals, i have been there to do her makeup.  I wasn't there for her senior pictures and she cried her eyes out.  I asked sam what time her date was picking her up and i never got an answer until friday morning.  I get up for work between 6 and 6:15am.  So at 6:50am sams txts me and tells me the time he'll be there.  I look at the crap and 'ah shit'. Late for sure.  I can hear it raining and I really dont feel like rushing to get up or anything.  I call my boss and tell her im going to be late.  She tells me to take my time bc the weather is bad.  Kati knocks on my door to make sure im up and to tell me its raining.  so I get in the shower and get ready.  Kati sends me a msg askin to grab her ipod.  I finish packing my makeup for sam and everything.  I was taking a half a day today but even then..its cutting it close to get to her in time.  

As Im trying to pile my crap in my car in the rain Karen calls and tells me not to bother coming in.  Because im a workaholic i tell her im coming anyway and that i had to bring kati her ipod so its ok.  I get to work right as Dawn is pulling in.   both late, how great is that! lol  

So i get to my desk and turn my computer on.  I wanted to change into my stilettos now that i was out of the mud and rain.  I had left them under my desk the day before and they happened to be back in the corner.  So i swivel in my chair and dip under sideways to get the shoes.  But the chair swiveled too fast for me and BOOM i cracked my head off of my computer tower that sits on the floor. NICE! geeze.  Kati asked what the hell that was.  I told her i got pissed at my computer and decided to head butt the tower on the floor. lol.  so i had to tell my boss i was in.  She sees me holding my head so i tell her what happened.  She gave me a can of cold mt. dew to keep it from swelling and what not, yay!

So noon time rolls around and i head out.  I talk to matty on the way home bc he sent me a msg.  So im cutting the time pretty close and i was really worried about making it to see sam.  I was going down 51 and decided to hit the toll road for some speeding.  no lie, i made it to I70 in like 15 minutes.  I FLEW.  sams calls me half way through, ""PLEASE TELL ME YOUR CLOSE!!"" shes crying and this rips my heart open and makes me want to cry.  Its almost one and hes coming soon.  I get her to calm down and walk her through putting on the basics until i get there.  i tell her im much closer and to wait another 20 min.

I pull in to collier and i think i left tire marks everywhere.  i grab my bag and sprinted to the house and up the steps and did whatever needed to be done.  So got that all done and started taking pictures.  Sam looked absolutely stunning.  When doesn't she, but that night was timeless.

We go to the grand march and i see so many people from school..and i knew a lot of ppl going to the prom.  I saw melissa white and we chatted for a while. her lil darling niece gave me a hug..how cute!  i saw amber, matt lewellyn, kt berish, alicia ellsworth, and janna.  Then, for those in the prom who all looked oh so perty: Jeremy budinsky :), megan jensen (my soccer sucessor), matt coffman, brad davis, (matt and brad all dressed up, not in cleats..awww!), my cousins krystal tanner and sonya miller, tiffany prah, larry budinsky, jenn tressler, jenna brooks, and pat pishko.  If i forgot someone im SO sorry, but im really tired!  Anyway, everyone looked so nice and i hope they all had a great time.

(leave some comments, k?)

So me and mom and bubs go to morgantown to eat and then get a movie and head to my cousins house to see her new baby.  Around 9pm we head home.  We noticed that leslie hadn't dropped off sams shirt for the post prom.  (Sam bought a shirt to match her dates for the post prom.  The sales clerk left the security tag on it and the thing didnt go off.  Leslie was suposed to take it back that night and get it taken care of for sam).  The mall closes at 9 so mom panicks.  She calls leslie and tells leslie that sam needed the shirt for tonight.  Mom calls the store and explains the story.  The woman offers to keep the store open until 9:30 to remove the tag. Mom calls leslie and tells her to run the shirt over.  We wait outside, car started and ready to go.  Leslie drops off the shirt and we make it to the mall in 5 minutes. I think I stopped a total of 3 times from my house to the mall.  We got it back in time for sam.



<b>Saturday</b>
Me, sam, leslie, and mom run to walmart. sam dropped off her photos and i saw justine and we talked for a while.  Mostly about her wanting to buy a digital camera and how she wants to get married and how i should be working toward that type of commitment.  HAH!  <b>no one</b> is ever going to marry me and i'll leave it at that.

Anyway, I wait for brian to call me so we can go out.  We go get some chinese and then go to walmart because i wanted to buy one of those frisbee things that are flexible w/the hole in the center.  Brian hit it on the nose when he said, ""why, bc they're easier to throw?""  BINGO! him, al, mike, jeremy, nick, sean, ben, and deemer know perfectly well how bad i throw a frisbee..i just cant do it! lol  anyway, walmart doesnt have any so we leave and go mud-putting (I CALL IT MUD-PUTTING OK! LOL) or put-putting for the rest of u normal ppl. lol  my feet were killing me afterwards bc i was in stilettos..ouch. hey, who else do u know who can kick ass in golf in those kind of shoes?! lol  then we went to get a cyclone at twin kiss and then back to his house.  his mom saw these push pins that were shoes and had to get them for me..HOW SWEET! I LOVED THEM! why wouldnt i? they had shoes on them! lol


<b>Sunday</b>
I got up bc pepper wouldn't stop knocking EVERYTHING off of the dresser.  So i got up and got bubs paper for her.  I see these pair of shoes in the sales paper for value city and immediately call my mom to tell her we were going there.  I ended up finding a better pair of shoes..TWO actually :)  I can do some damage but man do they look good!  After like 2 and a half hours and 3 visits to the dressing room for me and 2 for her, we leave.  We ate at the beanery.  When i got home i did a few things for bubs, took some pics of my dads car and then went out the door.

Im Sooooo excited about going to see dani in a couple of weeks!!!  I have to put in this convo w/her that im having:
lisha standish17: hey where am i sleeping when i come down

"event","I've learned so much this weekend..

I had relatives come up from Georgia.  My cousin Danielle which has been the closest thing I've ever had to a big sister, her husband John, and they're cute lil tikes, Jacob (4) and Savannah (2).  Truly two of the smartest youngins around.
Here is what I've learned from them this weekend:
1. You can hide behind something smaller then you and not be seen.
2. You dont have to read a book to be smart
3. Being a good parent also means saying NO.
4. Being a good parent-loving ur kids above all else-can mean hurting inside to see their happiness.
5. Hamsters can survive even after being dropped, kicked, and spun in a ball a million times.
6. There are some guys that are afraid of hamsters.
7. People remember, even if they are tiny kids, they remember.
8. The sound of Savannah crying when she can't find me rips my heart apart.
9. Being called Shasha (my family nickname) is the greatest feeling.
10. A two year old can eat more than my dad..LOL
11. Kids are mocking birds..LOL
12. I learn a lot when my cousin is drunk.
13. Corona, Cranberry in Absolute, and Coke is nasty.
14. I don't know downtown utown very well...and shouldnt drive there at night.
15. I'm a lightweight.
16. Wilma will eat everything.
17. So will Savannah. =)
18. A house is very empty when little loved ones leave. =(

This is what I learned from the 16 yr olds that live by me:
Me: Are you guys drunk? (u have to know the story of what they were doing..lol)
Guys: No, but we wish we were.  Could you get us some beer?  Nevermind, You'll get in trouble bc we're underage.
Me: Well so am I!
Guys: WHAT?!?! How old are you?!?!
Me: 20
Guys: We thought you were like 40 or something!!  Its not like it was bad bc ur hott and stuff.  But if you were 40 I'd still date ya!
Me: ..ohman..goodnight boys
hmmm..yeah i learned a lot...pfft! lol

What I learned from my grandparents this weekend (my ill bubs and my alzheimer stricken popop):
1. Unconditional love doesn't show at the beginning, but near the end.
2. My bubs has had a rough life.
3. I hope I find someone to love me the way she does him.
4. Cures are something needed, more than movie stars and salons.  People should give more money to charities and donate to finding cures.   
5. If I keep spending time wishing I was back in HS (and sometimes PTI), I'll miss everything going on now.  So in conclusion, I'll miss life...

What I learned from Brian, my love for him..and where it could end.
 This could end at any time.  Your love for someone, no matter how absolute, can only be pushed so far.  I cant put this in numbers...bc a lot goes through my mind about him.  I do love him, but you know, he does piss me off.  Like about these journals..I know he reads them sometimes.  So he sees the things I write about him.  And it breaks my heart to never get one damned thank you.  People comment about our relationship and even orr has said how lucky brian is to have me..if these people comment, couldn't my boyfriend of almost four years?!  I ask him to, but I never get one.  Dont get me wrong, I love when ppl comment, but I just feel like he should be among them..but .. he never is.. =(

Sometimes I scare myself.  My mind gets lost in thoughts that should never have been conceived.  I worry that I'm all Brian will ever know.  And I would never want to do that to someone.  If there is someone out there better for him, then I want him to have it.  I know its not me, and I dont want him to ""settle"" on me.  It seems that a lot lately the terms ""break up/split up"" have come up between me and him.  It worries me.  I've become so comfortable with him that I cant imagine leaving him and actually having something else with someone else.  It worries me because Im afraid to be alone, and I dont want to be.  I can't imagine someone else actually wanting to be w/me like he does, let alone put up w/me like he does..=(

I dont even know what Im thinking right now, its split in two sides.  The other day I watched School of Life on the family channel.  Damn good movie (and i love ryan reynolds).  After the movie was over I cried.  So hard that as I was walking to get a tissue I fell to the ground and cried harder.  I cant explain too much more without giving it away..just watch the movie..and the notebook-ull cry..male or female.


Tomorrow at work is going to suck..for those of u that know why...pray for me.

Thanks brent for ur msg from no where: ""romine 520: love ya lisha lee, have a good one :-)!"" It means a lot.
 
The same goes for my Dani girl.  I miss her sooooo much and I cant wait til she comes home!! 

Jesse u crack me up lol

I saw Walinda today..lol..my favorite line from our conversation, ""Nothing's changed!!""  as she speaks about the fun we have! lol  

I called Shawna. I miss her soo much!  She got a puppy!  How cute!.... *sigh* who am I kidding..I kinda felt like I was bothering her tho. 

I spoke w/Orr today.  I really like talking to him.  He really understands what I say.  I really hope he gets the job change hes hoping for bc he deserves it.  I really hope I get to hang w/him soon.  I know I'm not one of the first persons hed actually want to hang with, but I do miss him and want to see him.  So hopefully an arrangement can be made.

Everyone wish kt ""get well"" so she can come back!! 

I think I should leave the whole social scene for a while..I mean..tonight was a big kick in the ass for me..i called shawna and orr and i felt like neither cared too much to talk to me. I think I bother ppl.  man that sucks.  Im sorry if i do, i really dont mean to.  but <i>ive taken the hint.</i>

 I know my birthday is approaching and I dont care that its a big one..it should probably be spent alone. 
=(

Well guys I believe I've made myself more depressed w/this entry.  I wish everyone a good night.  I leave you w/my forever lingering lyrics:
<i>""Take me away
then take me further.
Surround me now
and hold, hold, hold me like Holy Water.

She wants someone to call her angel.
Someone to put the light back in her eyes.
She needs someone to hear her when she cries.

She just needs a little help
To wash away the pain she's felt
She wants to feel the healing hands
Of someone who understands"" </i>

<i>""How do you get that lonely, how do you hurt that bad 
To make you make the call, that havin' no life at all 
Is better than the life that you had 
How do you feel so empty, you want to let it all go 
<b>How do you get that lonely... and nobody know""</b></i>


Its late and I need sleep.  So much is going through my head right now..but i just dont know how to let it out.  right now im afraid to.  goodnight-i wont say anymore.

**Update: I just read something that just basically ... *sigh* didnt make me feel good at all.."

in a nutshell...sundays game just rocked..i LOVED playing steves team.  
Jess: ""I fell off the treadmill!!""
Me: ""HEY EVERYBODY!! DID I TELL YOU THAT JESSICA FELL OFF OF THE TREADMILL?!"" lol

and how great was it when steve tried to kick over brad?!?! yeah right!!  nearly impossible to kick over someone who bursts past 6 ft when ur a few ft from him! lol!  and matt ""running out of fuel"" and brads sweet goal...and MY SWEET GOAL! i've always wanted to do that! so freaking awesome!  and me yelling at brent to run to the other side to cheer for the other team..LOL

then i went to eat w/bb and his family..then i got harassed by jeremy and ben for the next 4 hours.  it was really sweet of them to drive from far away to see my game!  jeremy washed my car and ben put gas in my car..how nice! lol.

brian as usual made vday even better.  bought me the beach bag i LOVE w/flip flops all over it! LOVE SHOES! and the ever so sweet heart locket w/""I Love You"" on the front and two pics of me and him on the inside.  I wanted to cry...his heart is so big and beautiful.  and even more..ive been living a fairy tale valentines day for the past almost 4 years..  <3 u always bb

so i talked w/my dani this weekend...i miss her so much and i cant wait til she gets back.  i talked to her for a while on sunday night on my drive back..i had some things to rant about and she listened as she always did.  i miss our talks from a year ago, and our 'adventures' lol. and she sent me a touching card in the mail..shes great.  and she sent me a get well card through email.  awwww!! 
thanks to everyone who sent me get well wishes, i need them, i still feel oh so icky!  one of my fav msgs was from meg:
""smile cupcake: ok lish...if u got me sick, imma be mad!  i'm getting a sore throat again!!! i've been sick twice this winter already and both times they started as a sore throat!  i think its fishy that we always seem to be sick at around the same times!  i guess we shouldn't make out so much!!! :-[   feel better tho!""  
damn her for telling! lol

i have to get this out, bc its pissing me off.  this goes out to certain someone who thinks hes God's gift to me-fuck that..ive already got that gift and his name is BRIAN!  I dont care that u think that after only talking to me for 10 min u think that i should b w/u and that i should be single so u can be w/me.  that would NEVER happen u egotistical little shit.  i ask for something simple so all of a sudden i gotta put on a skimpy outfit and take a picture JUST for you?!?!  FUCK THAT!  WHO THE FUCK DO U THINK U ARE?!  And then u get completely pissed when I dont keep my promise?!?! well holy shit! what nerve i have to NOT take a special porno-like picture for someone that is NOT brian.  (take a number sweetiepie, u can get at the end of the line and stay there-bc ill keep pushing u back there)  oh this pisses me off sooo bad!  tell me how this makes sense:  u give me a stupid code u find on ur bottle cap and then i get all ""dolled up and put on a sexy outfit"" to take a picture just for u?!?  ill take a pic just for u, it'll be a close up of my middle finger.  kiss it jackass and keep dreaming..

ok now..im starting to cool off..that jsut really pisses me off-anyways, i really wanna feel better bc im so tired and my throat is swollen and my nose is stuffed...ahhh.  i hate this..second time this winter already...damn this!  grrr.. 

by the way, my bubs came out of the hospital last thursday, thanks for everyone who kept asking, it means a lot.

well im barely awake right now bc of my illness so i need to get..goodnight all"

"event","Dear Phil,
Thank you so much for proving a standard point-Americans will constantly search for something to believe in, something to give them some ""certain-ty"" on any aspect, some gimmic to base something in their life off of.  Thank you for being that bastard, because America loves you.  So much so that we've based an entire day on it.  Dear Phil, you suck and I can't wait til someone runs over your face.  Not me, because my beautiful car is too good for that, but hopefully some smart kid on a tricycle or something.  yeah..that would rock!  See most people hate valentines day, not me, i HATE groundhog day.  And exactly whose nonbright idea was it to make a groundhog ""Ruler of the Weather""  HEY GENIUS! If you look at the damn calendar, WINTER IS OVER IN LIKE SIX WEEKS ANYWAY!! But no!!!!! We cant just let the changing of the moons tell us when winter is over...oooh HELL NO! that would be wayyyy too smart for americans!  We gotta have roadkill Phil come out of his mansion of a tree stump, look at a million drunk ppl and some fattys in top hats and run away!
I seriously wish that one day fat bastard phil would come out of his ""tree stump"" and look at the camera and just DIE!  What would that mean?  ""OH NO! Phil predicted armaggedon!!!""  The hell w/nostradomas, we've got Phil the f'in groundhog!! my God I hate STUPID ppl!! @#^&!#&@#

And you know what else bothers me, ppl who dont like valentines day.  Here let me describe them: when this day comes around ""I hate vday its soo stupid, i mean whats the point"" (WHAT THE FUCK IS THE POINT OF THE RODENT TELLING US WHEN THE WHITE STUFF WILL STOP FALLING?!)  You know, ive had MORE THAN MY SHARE of bad experiences w/guys, but i have NEVER hated valentines day!  I LOVE this day-its so perty! =)  I do feel bad for the ppl who hate it, i mean i feel bad for all of the bitter ppl consumed w/anger at the opposite sex.  Wonder why their still single?  Holy shit im a genius! maybe i should predict the weather, build me a damn mansion that looks like a tree stump and ill pop out ONCE a year!

Ok i dont want to rant anymore lol

I would like to thank matt and brent for getting me bottle caps:
fearlessPaz15: hey lish i have a bottle cap for u
Lisha Standish17: MATT I LOVE YOU!!
Lisha Standish17: OH MAN IM SO EXCITED NOW!!
fearlessPaz15: lol.  its no biggie.  anything for my buddy lish
Lisha Standish17: oh man u rock!!! matt i would give u a million hugs right now if i could!!!!!!!

I also have to say that Elzer HAS returned! weeeeeeeeeeeee! =)  And is also already stated that he will be on my summer team hooray! This guy...he just rocks so much.
elzerer: liiiish

Benjamin, my honeybee, so persistent to see to my happiness.  Your such a good friend ben.  I hope u never forget that!

OH MI!  How could I forget that Im expected to have a fan club at one of my games on sunday?  My fan club consists of Jeremy, Nick, Mick, Sean James(u cant just say his first name *s*), Ben, RYAN ORR!!, Jesse, and Kati.  I felt so loved.  They were planning on coming in shirtless (well not kati lol shes not drunk lol jk!) w/my name spelled out on their chests.  I had to explain why it wouldnt be kewl to do that in the rec center! lol but the fact that these guys would come from all over the area to see me...makes me feel so special..and loved.  Sean James texted me at 130am for directions..lol!!  I told Jeremy that they would freeze and he said, and I quote, ""We dont care, we're doing this for you.""  Yeah i almost cried..If you guys didnt know it already, you rock, and i love you!

Speaking of sundays, Boy voyage and good luck in VA!  Im gonna miss u bunches but i wish u all the luck!  also, as if no one knew this already, megan smiley is just THEE best.  I really think ppl should say it more!  You know, she's not mia hamm, but she is completely and totally dedicated and determined.  People may say that they ""love soccer or play soccer""..but you can tell, in her, the determination in each play she makes.  She tries so much and she'll b at the games when no one else will.  Im so glad that she's on my team.  And i LOVE talking to her on sundays (and having my butt poked..LOL) because it starts to feel like old times, when I had my best friend and other half with me.  I truly believe that she was the best friend that I ever lost.  I was telling brent the other day that i missed me and her being close.  sadly i guess things do happen..=(

brians cousin holly gave me hamsters..so now i am the owner of Chubaca (Chewy for short) and kitty.  Yes, kitty.  They're incredibly cute, even when me and kati had to scramble beneath my bed to catch them the other day because they got out! lol

Speaking of brian...i miss him..incredibly. 
No one told me
I was going to find you
Unexpected
What you did to my heart
When I lost hope
You were there to remind me
This is the start
I knew there was somebody somewhere
Like me alone in the dark
Now I know my dream will live on
I've been waiting so long
Nothing's gonna tear us apart
Brian has all of my beginnings..and hopefully..he holds all of my endings.  You just gotta realize that no matter how many times you get hurt, its all part of your journey..if you get off now, you'll never make it.  We're going on four years in april, each day I keep thinking-this could really be it.  Previous relationship go bad after a year or so...but four years and we laugh and talk like we've known each other forever but refreshes each day.  Tell me whose relationship does that?  (besides cody and shawna lol).  If you ask me how many times brian has made me cry, or wish i wasn't with him bc hes an ass, i would stand up to you face to face, look you in the eye, and tell you, ""never. Now ask me how many times hes made me smile, made me laugh, brighten my day, done something little to show his feelings, tells me how much he loves me or misses me..needs me.""  Id tell u, ""everyday""  So dont stand there and tell me good men dont exist, bc im dating one and hopefully, one day, more.  ""I look forward to coming home to you..""  yes, hes told me that...*sigh*
Brent: ""You have one of the few almost nonexistant good guys""
Jesse: ""Realize you have what we all want""
^this constantly runs through my mind
and other comments from jus and meg-i do appreciate what u say..thank u.

well all, i had to do this bc jeremy told me im two weeks overdue w/an update..lol.  
night all

"event","I really loved this weekend:

Friday:
Stacey showed me a different way to 51 since the stupid flood is laughing at all of Pitts. right now.  I dont see any damn countries sending us money!! (insert bad words&#@$*(@#$)  Anyway, I saw one of the houses that the mudslide hit..it looked very crippled.  So sad.  Well I finally make it to Uniontown Mall where me and brian where meeting for dinner at the beanery.  We were standing there waiting for our thingy to go off and this guy comes up to us and just stands there.  I just look at the ground, waiting for him to ask Brian what the time is or something...but he just stands there.  I look up after a few seconds and no one says anything, he just stares at me.  Then I'm like, ""OMG, MARK!!"" *laughs*  Wow! I really didn't recognize him!  Neither did brian-wow.  So we chat for a while, I tell him my line of work and he bows down to me..lol.  So we chat a bit longer and then he is on his way.

Our movie was at 730 at the laurel mall and it was now 630.  I tell Brian to go in and take our name off bc there would be no way we'd make it.  So we settle for Rosa Pizza..which is quite yummy.  We then make our way to the movies.  I see Jess there and we say our ""hi""s and give our hugs.  Then the previews start.  I must say there are a lot of movies coming out w/the same special fx.  Not saying they are bad, they are quite good, and look awesome!  But anyway, the movie of choice that night was White Noise..freaking scared the crap out of me!! Most of you who know me are just laughing and saying ""anything scares u..and now u'll sleep w/the light on..""  All I have to say to that is..yeah, so? lol

After the movie I had to call Kati bc I was so excited/scared or something and I tell her about the movie. lol.  Then we head back to brians house for a while.  Me and brian beat the crap out of each other..well he didnt really beat me up..but i left marks on him.. sorry!  that guy is a saint! =)  Putting up w/me like he does! =)  I end up leaving and getting home around quarter til 1.



Then on Saturday I went to see Popop in the home w/bubs.  I havent seen him since before Christmas because I was sick.  I think he knew who I was for about a minute and a half..*sigh* ....
Then me and bubs headed to see my baby at work.  We stopped at CVS and I chatted w/brian while bubs looked around.  Then we walked over to Dollar General and I said hi to Kyle bc he was working as well.  Then I had a few things for Brian that I had to run back over to him.  

Then we headed back into Uniontown to eat at ENP.  We were gonna go to Ponderosa but I had to remind bubs that she was using that cane to get around and it would be very complicated to do the whole buffet thing.  So we ate at eat n park.  I must say, I did enjoy there chicken soup-but ima sucka for soup =)  Then we stopped at mcdonalds for some sandwhiches for my mom and dad.  We dropped them off at my house and then headed up to bubs for the night.  I gave pepper a bath..which was completely funny bc..well..u just have to know this cat.

Pepper has this thing where she likes to shove her head into the tissue box and run..very weird..HILARIOUS to see! LOL  Well the tissue box happened to be on the edge of the coffee stand.  She was walking across and noticed it.  She walked over to it, pushed her head in and ran right off of the stand..sooo funny! lol

I then got a call from brian and i talked to him until a little after midnight.



Then on sunday i went to my game.  we were doing soo well, but things happen and we lost.  But it was a great game.  In any case..I happen to have a very humorous group for my team..lol  
<blockquote>
Me: ""You make me wanna LaLa!"" 
Pat: ""I think that was better than Ashlee Simpson""

Pat:""His name is MatagascarAfricanamy""
Jess:""His name is Pancho?""
Me:""yes, just call him rain guard..""

Jess:""Take a lot of shots..""
Meg: ""..a lot of shots.."" *makes motion like shes taking a shot (alcohol)*

Me to Luke: ""I want u to go in for Brian""
Luke: ""Are you sure?  cuz, hes doing really good out there..""
^luke w/no belief in himself..lol

Steve:""Yeah we're doing really good this year..we just beat a team like 11-2""
Me: ""yeah yeah, talk up ur team""
Steve: ""but this green team beat us like 8-0 the other day!  Ive never been shut out!""
^poor cheese!  thats what u get for taking players away from me..lol
</blockquote>

I also chatted w/elzer for a bit bc i havent seen him since summer league.

After the game I realized Jess left w/o me getting to stop her.  So I called her and headed over her place since she lives right over the hill.  We exchanged presents, she got me the cutest sweater and camisole set!  She also got me this vanilla spray from B&B that smells oooh so delicous! She seemed to like what I got her and got kinda choked up at the picture I made.  Her mom really did and told me that I was a good friend to Jess.  I try to be, but shes such a great friend to begin with!  She really is the best!  Then he dad asked me if she was carrying her weight.  I said that she very much so was, bc I know she catches a lot of unnecessary flack about that.  She keeps up w/most of the guys in the league, let alone carry her own weight!

Then I head home to change and shower and back over to brians.  He beats me in ping pong and bc hes so mean he makes it so I always have 12 points before he really creams me!  booo!  But I won the gamecube game so yay for me!  Its like the first game ive won w/him in the whole time ive been w/him! lol!!

So before I leave I take a pic w/his family in front of their christmas tree and head out.  Then I head back up here to use my jewelry cleaner brians mom got me for christmas and update this thingy!

Thanks to Bodnar who is pretty much one of the only few who remembered to tell me Merry Christmas on the 7th.  Thanks, that does mean a lot to me.

And thanks to Orr who sent me a msg in hopes that I was feeling better!  You're so nice! =)

Brian also got me this kewl candle lighter w/the pivoting lighter thing..I LIKE TO READ DIRECTIONS! Im a manual reader, I'll read it cover to cover just bc i like doing it!  but brian and his dad made fun of me for reading directions for a lighter..LOL 

Well i really miss my baby and i cant stop thinking about him..just felt like letting all know that.  I miss u brian and i love u tons!!! *mwah!*xoxo!!!!!!

I need to head to bed now..goodnight all!"

"event","oh man..i typed in the subject and i really dont feel like updating...hmmm.


However..i now must move on to my convos on AIM as of a few moments ago.
First off..ryan...most people of pittsburgh will kill you but I have to publish this:
<blockquote>Wimbly7: how bout them shitty steelers?
Wimbly7: i hope they lose in the 1st round :-D
Lisha Standish17: r u serious
Wimbly7: yes
Wimbly7: i don't like them
Wimbly7: besides...the patriots are going to win the superbowl 
Wimbly7: i think big ben gets too much credit and he's not that good
Wimbly7: and i'm tired of ppl saying how much better the steelers are than the patriots....but i guarantee if the patriots play the steelers again (and this time corey dillon and ty law both play) that the steelers are finished...they won't beat them again
Lisha Standish17: u know u could die in this town for saying that
Wimbly7: seriously...how else could the steelers beat the patriots?  could it be because the patriots were without their starting runningback and one of the best shutdown corner's in the league?....i believe so
Wimbly7: whenever i saw roethlisberger get injured...it brought a smile to my face and a YES! from my voice
</blockquote>

And my whole conversation w/justine could go in here..lol..because its full of my laughin at myself and her basically saying, ""ur stupid"" lol. well she didnt say that but i know thats what she was thinking!
<blockquote>
xthree3: oh oh and cows
xthree3: do they eat meat?!
xthree3: i'm so freaked out!
Lisha Standish17: i dont think so...i'd stay away from those certain cows if i were u....
xthree3: lol for real
xthree3: they probably have herpes or something
Lisha Standish17: watch for foaming at the mouth
Lisha Standish17: and red eyes
xthree3: that's the sign of herpes?
xthree3: oh man
xthree3: i might have them
Lisha Standish17: u foam at the mouth?
Lisha Standish17: thats rabies
xthree3: oh sweet!
xthree3: haha
</blockquote>

Next I have to pray for my dearest of buddies ryan orr.  He's so nice and deserves so much wonderful-ness.  I hope he realizes that now is so hard to grasp because its so real..but so much more is going to come.  No its not going to come right away and maybe it wont be explosive..but this isnt the end.  My best advice? Keep breathing, and if u need me to, I'll be the light until tomorrow's new blessing. That pretty much goes for everyone..but right now..its pointed to Orr.

Right now I'm thinking about this morning.  I was kinda worried about something about work..nothing big, but if you REALLY know me, then u know that I blow everything up when its something negative about me.  With this, I mean that I excessively worry about everything...<b>EVERYTHING</b>.  Being the complete sweetheart that he is, he called me early this morning to remind me NOT to worry.  It was comforting, as it always is, but Im the ultimate worrywart. Then when work was done he called me just to check to make sure there was nothing for me to worrying about..heh.  God, I dont think I could have ever asked for someone better.  I think Justine, in the sweetest comment, said it best, <i>""Be greatful for your man, because that's just so sweet! I shed a tear in happiness for you that you have such a great person to be with who is perfect for you.""</i>


Earlier I was feeling a little friend-deprived..but ive read through my past entries..i love you guys..u guys who comment and tell me what i NEED to hear..not just what i want to..i truly love u guys..for not being fake..for being so true and genuinely good people. for not being afraid to express urself about my journal and what u read..u guys keep me going!! Brian, jd, <b> kt, ur the best</b>, ORR, danielle!,jeremy, jesse, justine, seanjames-just to name the ppl that actually care enough to comment... and all my other friends..i love u too!  KATI RAYMOND I LOVE U! =)

Its almost the bedtime for ill lil chickies so I must sign off..ohh..doesn't that sick icon from the last entry look gross?  Its puking poop! eww! 

night all
heart ya!"

"event","I am pretty sick of being sick.  i got sick on christmas eve and was pretty much dead the entire break.  So what did that mean?  It meant not being able to socialize at all.  Man I hate being sick, because my body has built up a deep immunity to pretty much all medicines on the account that about 85% of my life has been spent being intolerably sick.  This time was pretty bad though because I almost went to the ER about two or three times.  I even missed a soccer game...*sigh*

Throughout this time of being sick-my boyfriend has not let his sweet tendencies come to a halt.  In between my many naps and cough/choke attacks, he calls me to let me know he is outside my house w/some chicken soup from panera bread.  With just enough time to eat the soup and watch about five minues of tv, i start to lose my ability to keep my eyes open.  He pulls my legs straight so that Im layin on the couch, he tucks me in w/my blanket and pulls down the blinds.  He then kisses me on the forhead and says, ""im going to go now baby, u get some rest."" and leaves.  If I wasn't half dead, I could have cried at this..

On to another account of my hero in action.  He brings me over some wendys chicken strips and fries.  And, alas!, he has even gotten me ranch dressing-which he always jokes taht he would never touch the stuff-and brings a movie for us to watch.

I tell ya, now that im half able to recall this break, he truly is something else.

Thank you to benjamin, who MAILED me my christmas present!  what a great guy!  ive just been too toxicated/sleep/dead to call and thank him.

To continue, my new years was spent sleeping.  I watched some of the funny commercials, got a call at midnight from brian, then i fell back asleep just to wake up choking.  Ladies and gentlemen, I kid you not, I was sick.  

Im growing very tired-im surprised ive made it this far-ive got so much more to say, but it will have to wait, as im not back to my full writing abilities and am starting to fall asleep and I have work in the morning.

I hope everyone enjoyed their holidays.
xoxo
Your one and only
Lisha Lee =)

"event","So it snowed the other night and i was so freaking excited i went outside and danced in my santa hat.  i know u care, and it was fun.

KATI CAME BACK TODAY! so now i could talk to something other than myself! =)  im so excited.  we didnt do too much the whole night.  well thats a lie.  i actually made food! edible food that is! and then we played some ddr-yeah we rock at that..pfft. LOL.  

But we decorated today!  yeah! the apartment has so many lights!  we seriously dont have to turn on the regular lights bc we have so many christmas lights! its so awesome! and our christmas tree is this fake tree...like big plant non pine tree christmas tree. LOL.  but it looks nice bc we decorated it! lol seriously, u should stop on over and check it out! 

im so happy right now!!

woah i couldnt sleep last night-yes, as i said w/orr-the darkness scares me.  but i had my stuffed attack dogs. lol.  and of course the trailer for the movie ""darkness"" had to come on a million times!! grrrr! so anyways..i woke up at 1pm!!! i NEVER do that! never!! .. never!! yikes!

well sean james totally blew me away today.  i must say that i completely appreciate his compliments toward me.  im sorry that my previous journal entry bothered him-but im glad he spoke to me about it.  hes so sweet. =)

so tonight's chat session rocked! lol.  it consisted of me, kati, sean james, jesse, and bodnar.  this..was awesome.. LOL.  needless to say we got off of the topic completely and on to the soon to be parties at 723 (me and kati's apartment)  sean james and jesse are quite looking forward to it..and being our cameramen and lighting directors..LOL

so i got to talk to brian for a bit today.  and i loved it and laughed a whole lot. but for some reason i was getting frustrated talking to him.  i dont know why..  im so weird.  i just thank my lucky stars that he chooses to stay w/me through everything i know i put him through.  

oh man, i so have to go to bed!! ahhh! im so tired too! im so not gonna be able to get up tomorrow! waaaa! lol

DECEMBER 19th @ 1pm = first indoor game woo!

"event","<i>""You get to be the dreamer...but all I'll ever be is the dream...""</i>
This quote really makes you think..
Everyone (allow me to be more general..most people) dream, fantasize of a life of the walgreens commercials.  Everything is perfect-mass amounts of money, expensive cars, theme park size house, having people adore your every move, the perfect significant other-and above most-be beautiful.  So many people want to be the picture perfect stunning image of themselves.  Its so hard to get not get caught up in the many models and tv shows and cover pictures-so much doctoring on this stuff..  Its so hard to think that these people aren't all that we crack them up to.  Its sad to admit that I am one of these people, as much as I try not to be, I am.  It just seems so unfair for them to always be smiling and never seem to have a bad moment.  But I know its not that way...once I sit down and look at it.

I dont have the type of appearance that people flock to, but I do have other things...that match up just as much.  I am the dreamer..and I do dream of a lot.  I have a career in my field of choice w/many benefits..right out of college...not many i know have that.  My boss told me i have management abilities and that ive a very professional person-one of the best she's worked w/in her 15 yrs of working in a higher position.  and one of the deans openly complimented my work to the ENTIRE carlow community (shes not one to compliment as im told)..  

i still play soccer, its nothing like my ""glory days"" but its still something, and i could still put u in ur place at the drop of a hat if i wanted.  i still have all of my beautiful and wonderful friends and my loving family.  and above most else, i have brian

Just tonight i told him, ""the only thing i like about me is you""  and while its the truth, he told me that he wishes i didnt feel the way i do about myself, bc its not true.  To have a boyfriend that thinks the world of u-not too many have.

While i'll probably always be insecure about my appearance, i'll still have those hidden things about myself.  So no, not everyone will know all of those things about me-but its kewl, bc i dont need them to.  all i need...is what i have.


Wow, im never up this late anymore...well that may be a lie, bc i cant sleep sometimes/alot.  lol
Its so weird, so many ppl want nothing than to be out of high school or college.. they want to be on their own.  i just hope they realize what all comes w/it.  Dont take me wrong, i love where im at...but i miss everyone i went to school with.  Yeah i still talk to a good bit of them .  but still, its not like seeing them everyday.  I cant really complain however, bc i have the BEST roommate eva! =)  kt rox and its so awesome livin in this apartment.  ""Look! Its steven lynch and ur balls!""  =)  Kati is currently working on a site for us..LOL  We have to *behave* in max -n- ermas....LOL...""do u need help?""  ..LOL!!  =)

Well everyone at carlow already has plans for me for my 21st bday party and its not for a few months yet!  its kinda funny-everyone wants to celebrate it. LOL.  hey its ok...my thoughts are this:  my 21st bday is on a thursday-so i'll take off work on friday and use the rest of the weekend for the rest of my festivities! 
ohman im probably bluffing..but who knows! lol.  ;p"

THANK YOU JEREMY CERULLO!!  I owe my internet usage to him, bc he helped me set it up! =)  Thank you too Brian Cerullo.  :)
^hey! i love him! =P

I dont even know where to begin-

Lets see, I just moved into a new apartment with the infamous Kati Raymond.  Kati, ""Is it illegal to say 'ur hott' to a cop??""   ....LOL  We just moved into a two bedroom apartment.  So I have my own room..and for the first time ever..my own bathroom..Holy property!!  =)

Hmm..I recall a certain halloween party at a previous apt w/kati.... ;)
i remember someone getting drunk-and sliding across the pavement after I hit him w/my car.  Trying to play tennis in complete darkness.  Jeremy jumping up and knocking a bee hive off a tree, just to sprain/break/crack/injure/wound/cause extreme pain to his ankle.  So he procedes to sit on someones steps and moan..and moan..and groan..but it didn't sound like pain.  LOL  Me putting al's makeup on while orr got dressed outside while some guy kept talking to him about beer. lol.  Jeremy throwing his cup at sean james head like 50 times...so stupid but so funny.  Sean James friend ...pfft! LOL  My ...falling out...stupid halloween costume-yes jeremy-im surprised I wore it too!  lol..

Thanksgiving was awesome!  Wilma somehow managed to take a full pumpkin pie past the dining room full of people, to the outside and devour it.  Man I love my dog! =)  The best part was most def spending almost every minute w/my baby.  Over 3 and 1/2 years...*sigh* im so in love w/that boy...

Working at Carlow if f'in awesome.  I truly love it *knock on wood*  I get into a rubber band fight (and actually win) on a regular basis.  As well as the occasional picture and phrases on my white board or the pictures of stacey...lol! jenny's noises when she hears a rubber band. i really do like it..the closest to my age there is 30 and im 20...id never thought id get along so well w/these people.  They're truly great.  damn jagged edge! lol!!!!  

Well, im pretty tired, not feeling so well.  I actually just wanted to come home and crash, but ive still got like 6 boxes to unpack and my room is already full! ahhh lol.

All along, never fully knowing these things are those that I've felt, experienced.  Felt the warm hugs, and the piercing lash, but I always sat and smiled....

<i>I'll next comment and say that I know ""michelle,"" orr.  and i love you and all that you have ever amounted to be or become.</i>

For all that could only ponder as to what could possibly harbor inside...get a comfy chair, bc this will take forever..and for the first time...im not holding anything back...

<b>From 9th grade to 11th...my untold story in its entirety:
9th grade:</b>  Beautiful, wonderful. I started varsity for soccer-and i loved my team.  My grandparents were in much better shape (for the most part) and my family was just a very lovely group to call home.  As always, i was on top of the books, w/o ever having to open them.  Honors Writing, English, and Biology w/the best of friends.  I was chased by multiple boys, which, for any girl, makes her feel on top of the world.  I felt alive and wanted and beautiful and lucky.

<b>The beginning of Josh:</b>
He pursued me.  After a messy breakup w/his previous, Laura, he was after me..needless to say i was speechless.  I never went out of my way for him...then.  Made him come to me.  At this time and even b4, me and Laura were on shifty terms anyway...this just pushed it over.  Him and her both played for the middle school and i had moved up to play high school ball.  one day they had a game..and on the bus i found out that they hooked up and even shared a kiss or two.  I thank my friends once again, espeically my guys, for looking out for my safe-being.  I dont think Adam could have gotten to me sooner..he felt so bad for me.  Me?  i was upset that once again i let myself believe more bs.

<b>Coming back pt 1:</b>
one day after lunch he runs up to jillian (my one of my best at the time) and i hear him saying, ""is she mad...do u think she'll forgive me...i feel really bad..i messed up..""  i hear jill tell him to tell me instead.  so he does and as hes saying that he messed up i stop, look at him and say, ""i know"" and keep going.  so he keep pursueing and eventually i fall.  For the first 1 it was great.  I was over peanut and him seeing me w/someone else and being happy was just great.  I couldnt see through what would happen, but who could, he was what a girl wants..or at least what she thinks she wants at 14/15.

<b>The continual fall:</b>
I was afraid that the transition into high school would change him, and of course he promised, and of course i believed, and of course, i was right.  He started acting macho in front of new friends..and i felt small and used.  His friend would even tell him in front of me that he should stop being a jackass bc the last guy that lost me is still sulking and if he lost me i would find someone..but he would never find anyone to match me.  go figure..look at the foreshadowing. as i was slowly allowing him to take over me, i was slipping into depression.  My mom wanted to know why i never smiled...friends stopped coming around bc i was always gloomy..and me and my best friend started argueing .. REAL BAD.  We were never the same and to this day i consider her the best friend i ever had and lost.  Josh would tell me that if i ever hit him that he would hit me right back and i quote, ""Do you really think you're pretty?!  Do you really think anyone wants you?!  You're just fat.  You dont honestly think you're better than me in soccer?!  .. Hey I need this homework done by tomorrow.""  Yeah, i did it.  *sigh*  I watched him walk away from me to walk other girls to class while i just stood there and watched him go and still loved him.  

<b>Breakup #1:</b>
By this time, a certain someone stepped in and tried to take me away.  Me and josh broke up and i was finally starting to move on..until that call.  Josh called and told me that i was just another girl to this guy and that i meant nothing..that i would never be happy w/him and id just be used.  He would write me notes and follow me into class and not leave until i read them.  he cried and apologized and bc im so gullable i accepted and went back with him.  hoping that things would get better..but they never did.

<b>Trying to find my ground:</b>
the pain and the tears on my part kept coming as well as the breakups and i would beg him to go back with me.  i couldnt accept that he didnt want me and the more it seemed he turned cold, the more i loved him.  i was hung up on and yelled at countless times.  Guys stopped trying to steal me away bc i was hooked.  he was my drug.  He would always tell me that i had to get my mom to pick him up and take us to the mall or to go eat and if i didnt ask my mom or if my mom said no he would get pissed at me and hang up.  *ring ring* idiot calling. yeah i did...called him back everytime. Ppl just got used to seeing my eyes red and watery and no one could help me bc i was too far gone.  Josh would even make fun of my best friend jd.  jd and i had every class together and were always walking to classes.  jd was there to wipe up the tears and let me cry on his shoulder.  josh would get upset when hed see us together and call jd my ""puppy dog"" bc he ""followed me""...*shakes head*

<b>Josh Budinsky:</b>
the one that broke thru..for a while.  after one of our more major breakups..i stopped going back..Josh Budinsky and I had gotten real close and it was apparent the feelings were there.  I started going w/businsky and fisher (josh1) didnt like this at all.  He was always making fun of him and saying mean things about me and him.  but then fisher said he wanted me back..and all of a sudden i felt like i didnt want to be w/budinsky...not that he did anything wrong, he was a great guy..which is probably why i went away to fisher.  and not like anything better happened...it was good for like 3 days...then it went right back to bad.

<b>The final breakaway:</b>
this was our final breakup:  we were sitting in history class..and he said something or whatever but one of us was like, well fine then we're not together anymore.  and the other said, ""ok thats fine.""  and that was it.  that was the last few weeks of school in 10th grade.  and that was the last few weeks of us.  We were together 1 yr 8 mo.  but those 8mo were nothing but constant breakups and tears and the fall of me...w/no rise in viewable future.

<b>11th grade, a new girl in school:</b>
i had a new crush and it was pretty much over the school that me and josh were through and that i had a new someone in my dreams.  josh knew, and didnt like it, he would come up to me and rub my sides or try to grab my hand.  Id pull away and keep walking.  
Josh: ""so i hear u like cerullo now...??""
Me: ""yeah, i do""
Josh: ""pfft..u think that will amount to anything??""
Me: ""im not sure, but i hope it does.""
Josh never knew that since 9th grade i had a crush on brian.  and he was just mad at the fact that i was going after someone else.  someone brilliant and top at everything he did.  suddenly i started smiling again and laughing again..i was around brian alot and all of my friends again i felt alive..resurrected.  i got plenty of awards my jr year and actually had friends tell me, ""you know, i stopped talking to u when u were w/fisher. u just weren't urself and u were always crying and sad.  ..but now..ur soo happy and vibrant""-justin campbell.  i seriously felt on top of the world.  yeah i had problems but i just lived the 10th grade that i had..bring it on!  and when these fat girls at school tried me beat me up one day everyone at school...my cousin (who was in the ""in"" crowd) and all his friends bitched out these girls day after day for doing this and the principal put a threat of harrassment charges on these girls too..  i loved it! =) have the nerve to call me ugly! lol

<b>Jill and Josh:</b>
so u remember that girl from back when..?  yeah..up there^^.  Well her and josh ended up hooking up.  yeah i was w/brian and so that was fine..but i thought there was an unspoken rule that friends dont date ex's of other friends.  yeah i was told i had no right to be mad.  but how was i suposed to hang around her?? me and josh just never really talked and it was soo weird.  well when things went haywire w/her he broke down and called me and at first it was him saying he really liked her.  and i felt bad for him.  but then as weeks went by and their relationship was almost buried, he was telling me i was the best thing he ever had, he was sorry for the way he treated me, he wished he could turn back time.  but he also said he was happy for me..me too.  bc it didnt bother me at all. the same thing happened when he dated rachael.  he came over my house uninvited and got upset about her and felt i was the only one he could talk to.  so i let him talk and when he brought up me and brian, i just smiled and said that we're doing great.  i just sat and smiled...

<b>Class and Prom:</b>
Me and Josh (and jill) had photography together..and josh always tried to get me alone in the dark room and got mad when i wouldnt let it happen..and even more mad when hed see brian meet me after that class.  oh well! lol.  then for prom he started calling saying that we were suposed to go togeth and blah blah blah.  me?  i had my date...*ahem* my escort as i was on court...which would have never happened if i never broke out of the caccoon he...I built.

So thats it, thats my story...of course some stuff isnt there bc i have forgotten some.  This does not in any way capture hurt and pain that i felt during this time..but it is my summary.  Dont get me wrong, i did have my share of good times w/josh, just not w/him. lol.  its funny to look back at my yrbook and see all the ""DO NOT EVER DATE JOSH FISHER"" comments.  its crazy how love can make u so blind..but then i have to ask..if it makes u blind so that all u see is lies..how is it good??  when i think back to 10th grade, i cant think of anything but darkness, misery, and depression...too many tears for one young girl to cry on her own.  11th grade is the biggest contrast to that..i think of everything bright and cheery..and the beginning of the rest of my life..with my brian richard.  i love you boy.

breaking away from josh def wasnt easy, and i know it seems like im a big bitch bc i had to splurge this all over here...well maybe this is the first time i was able to get this out..bc no matter how many times someone says they'll listen, it never fails, it always happens..ill b in the middle of spilling myself and the person will interupt me and tell me about his/her bad experience.  How is this YOU listening??

so i thank u, whoever u may be..for listening to my story of years ago..of what i can remember of it..and see where at least some of my low self esteem comes from.  either way, i cant hold a grudge, yeah i get upset, but as mentioned above, i'll help anyone.  i'll help u clean up the blood after u slit my throat.  morbid but true..if thats even possible..lol.  im not one to openly be mean..i cant.

So i deeply apologize to anyone that has seen me on my bad days.  i feel REALLY bad and i dont ever want anyone to see me upset.  but once again..orr..time after time i will tell u how great i truly think u r.  and ill always mean it. 

and brian, i dont think i could have ever dreamed that me and u would be where we are.  never thought that any love could be this true and real.  thank u. and i love u more than anything.  i love u baby."

"event","yes...very.  very everything right now..very thoughtful and happy and content..very..clear..and i love this song that im listening to..the one mentioned above or below..however ihave this customized.  ""i wont forget all the ones i love""  it should be the understatement of the year.  ppl take this too lightly..too lightly in deed.  

thus, ive had a weekend to blow urs out of the weekend.  only bc of the ppl i was with..too bad bb was in bethany tho =(  anyways,  friday was the day to chill and rent movies w/bubs.  this being the funniest and most annoying thing ever.  why?  bc bubs hates movies, but she ALWAYS wants to rent them!  i love her, but this is what goes on when bubs watches, er, something, movies...:
1. Shes VERY hard of hearing, and refuses to wear any of the hearing aids shes splurged muchos dollares on.  So after something happens, i have to scream over the already blaring tv to tell her what just went on.  2. Its very known that pretty much everything is fake, and bubs just cant let it be like that.  she has to contstantly say, ""thats fake! oh bull shit!!""  yes gram, its fake, and watch ur language..lol yeah right.  Bc i got to fairchance pharmacy late, all the good movies were taken, so i got mona lisa smile (brillant even if i didnt like the ending) and ella enchanted..ella go jump in a river..lol.  ella enchanted is a fairy tale...knowing this bubs still finds it suitable to tell me how phony it is during the whole movie.  yay.  but she ordered pizza..so no argument there.

Saturday was beautiful.  took bubs to see popop in the nursing home, dropped mom off at the hospital and visited gram star there, went to cvs and dollar store and spent about 67$ in both places..yeah..we can spend that much in the dollar store..absolutley LOVE that place.  then we went to beanery (LOVE IT) and then to walmart.  as soon as we get into walmart, jd calls and says hes at the wedding at CVFD so i tell him if he doesnt mind waiting that we'll be there in a bit.  saw a bunch of ppl including t.c. and her babies...soo pretty.. she just had one on wed. yeah. wow.  but they really are beautiful.  

so i call jd and tell him im on my way and as soon as i get there he walks over and helps me unload all of bubs bags.  His reaction to our stuff: ""HOLY JEEZ!! Im surprised you weren't dragging ass coming around the corner!!"" LOL  so anyway, i decide to take him for a ride on the rhino...yeah, its my second time driving it. lol.  i think he enjoyed himself! LOL especially when the dog was chasing us and scared the piss out of me. haha.  and then my bubs poor plant..lol..i turned it upside down and drug the pot half way across the yard..lol well i couldnt see!! it was dark!!!  jd is laughing so hard and im like ""dad, i made an uh oh!"" dad gets scared bc he thought i ran into something. lol!!  and i showed him and hes like,...""oh...""  and by this time jd is dieing bc hes laughing so hard.  so then we decide its best to put it away and sit and chat for a while.  

we start talking about our cars and run-ins w/the police..lol poor boy! and then i was like, lets go for a ride.  dad was like, ""have fun, dont run over flower pots""  so we go and i show him my ipod equipped w/iTrip and he loves it.  so josh budinsky goes by a few times and asks me if ill be out around 11 bc he had to go to krystals so i told him alright.  jd leaves around 10:15.  i went outside at 11.  it was cold so i only stayed out til 11:15. lol i think i heard josh (and his kewl horn) go by but i was inside where the blankies were! lol.

but today is beautiful outside.  i loved driving today.  it was like the right temp outside.  simply awesome.  ahhhh.   well..off to chill and do something..i want to play raquetball..but im minus a ball .. haha.

well all..have a pleasant week.  i try to update during the week but me and kt usually go somewhere or beat the hell out of each other..lol.  its fun..and only leaves us both to ponder, ""so this is what its like to have a REAL roommate...?? wow"""

"event","So this inspiration is from a song that im listening to..heres a few lyrics to let u in...

She thinks I walk on water
she thinks i hung the moon
she tells me every morning
they just dont make men like u
she thinks i got it together
she swears im as tough as nails

she dont know how much i need her
she dont know id fall apart
w/o her kiss, w/o her touch
w/o her faithful loving arms
She dont know its all about her
she dont know i cant live w/o her
shes my world
shes my everything
and she thinks she needs me

how ironic for us both to feel the same about the song...for me to know that i need him..for him to think he needs me...  So he didnt hang the moon, or the sun and the stars...but he did for me.  Once upon a time years ago they were taken away from me, and all I was left w/was darkness.  With the grace of my friends and my will to keep going-i pursued a new person, going agaist the stereotype of how a relationship should start. 

I do need him..more than him..or anyone knows.  I think the only thing at this point that could make me happier is to be living w/him.  I had another dream about us getting married..so this makes like dream # 4 of the Brian and Alicia wedding series. lol  

I think I have my soulmate-found the person that everyone searches for.  I think Jesse put it best when he said, ""realize u have what we all want.""  just let that sink in....*breathe*








*keep breathing*  ur in love....no...ur living it.

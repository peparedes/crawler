thoughts running through my head
memories of the past
keep coming back
wishing they would fade
wishing i would die
wishing you were here
to sit by my side

Looking out the window
looking at the stars
wishing things werent this hard
my eyes are red and filled with tears
as i hear the echo in my ears
telling me to cut
telling me to die
telling me many many lies

The echo fades as i look down
and see the blood on the ground
blood and tears there are no more
because i am dead on the floor"

It may be sad but its definitely true.
I love you with all my heart,
I will never let us part.
In your arms is where I want to be,
forever and for all eternity.
My love for you will always stay,
and it gets stronger by the day.
You are perfect in my eyes,
our love will never die.
You mean the world to me,
I hope you see because together we will always be.

"event","Have you ever felt that no matter what you do or say that your life will never go as you would like and things are just going to keep getting worse until they cant possibly get any worse.Well I'm feeling that way right now.I often find myself sitting here wondering where my life is headed and rather or not i will ever be on the right track.Things are going so wrong right now that I dont see them ever getting any better. I sit here and cry,you may not always be able to see the tears but thats because Im crying on the inside. I just recently moved to georgia to be with my bf.I love him to death but he can be really mean and hurtful alot of the times. We argue almost constantly,but I just cant seem to leave.He was my first love.We dated for a year and then brokeup for 2 and then got back together.
I always find myself sitting here and dwelling on the past.When will the pain subside and when will the memories disappear. Im not sure how much more I can take.I feel so worthless and like I dont belong anywhere and it doesnt help that some of the people that i love have made me feel that way.I find myself getting more and more depressed each day.I thought it was all going away but that was just me dreaming.Sometimes I want to give up on everything and other times i want to work everything out and solve all my problems.I dont know what to do but im tired of feeling sorry for myself so im going to wrap this up.Maybe just maybe everything will get better but im not counting on it."

Moving away from home was a very difficult thing to do.I have never been on my own before and dont know the first thing about it.Im a lil scared but hes helping me through it.I miss my mother and my friends.Im living 8 hours away from home.I never thought id move out of my damn house let alone move to another state lol but im sure i can get through this with the help of my loving boyfriend.Hes in the navy and Im home by myself quite a bit but thats alright.Well I guess thats about all I have to say.Ill update more later."

then you walked into my life to stop my pain.
You told me you loved me and I believed it to be true,
I only hope that one day I can actually meet you.
You have the most gorgeous eyes I've ever seen,
so mysterious yet so full of gleam.
You make me smile on a daily basis,
and stop my tears when in a bad situation.
I know we live many miles apart,
but you have already stolen my heart.
I care about you a whole bunch,
I don't think you'll ever realize exactly how much.
Maybe one day our dreams will come true,
and we can meet and be together and live happily ever after."

Im feeling no pain,
only the feeling of blood running down my arm as the memories escape me.
The memories leave me like someones soul leaving their body as they die.
I have no worries and i have no fears as I look down at this huge gash on my arm.
Blood Blood running down my arm and dripping onto the floor.
I notice it but I cant feel it.
My arm goes completely numb but I dont care.
All I care about is getting the painful memories to leave my messed up mind.
All this is, is another Razorblade Romance."

The way you played with my hair.
The way you held me and told me you loved me.
You meant the world to me and I'll always remember you.
The way your gentle lips touched mine ever so lightly,
Oh I can still feel your sweet gentle kiss.
The way your hands roamed over my curvacious body,
Oh the way it felt to have your soft hands caress my sweet cheeks.
The way you ran your tongue across my stomach,
Oh that felt so great.

No one to help me understand that I'm not as worthless or simple-minded as I seem to believe.
I have no one to hold me,cuddle me, and tell me everything will be alright.

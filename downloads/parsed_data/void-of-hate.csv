"event","This 9/11 crap really needs to stop being on tv, especially all day long til 12am the next day.  They replay the same video clips, the same phone calls, they say the same things they said for the past 5 years.  There really isn't anything new that can be added as the years go on.  Have a memorial show for about an hour, honor people who died, and leave it at that.  The media has a serious problem with dragging something out and just never letting it die down.  I don't think people who lost someone that day wants to turn on the TV and see nothing but that AAAALLLL DDDDAAAYYY LLLOOONNNGGG....We really don't need 24 hours of televised video clips of the towers falling down.  That doesn't make people, ""never forget what happened"", that just makes people upset/pissed off."

I'd like to thank Brian, Taso and Maria for coming out to dinner with me tonight and making me feel nice on my birthday and for Zach for calling me at 12 and continuously thoughout the day wishing me a happy birthday and for everyone else who left messages on my lj and myspace.  I'd also like to thank Taso and Maria for being there for me both nights I celebrated and staying with me for about the whole day, each day.  And then there's a thanks for that certain person who felt the need to not see me not one but both days.  You had more than enough of an excuse to not see me today, but there really was no excuse to not see me yesterday when you knew we were celebrating since I knew we weren't gonna have alot of time to do it tonight.  So thanks for that.  So next year, are you perhaps considering going for a 3rd shot at missing my birthday in a row?  Cause last year didn't bother me as much, we weren't that close.  But just to let you know, this year, it hurt.  I guess getting high with your friends yesterday must of been more important than a friends birthday.  Pretty funny since going out to dinner was your idea and you weren't there for either.


Once again, to everyone else who actually made the effort to see me on my birthday...thanks.  It's good to know you actually give a fuck.

And yes...this time has proven to me that you ARE a stupid person...


edit: and btw...why the fuck should I care about you when obviously you don't care one fucking bit about what your ""best friends"" think, but seem to care what scumbag thinks?  I'm done with giving a shit about what happens to you.  If you're stupid enough to wanna stick around for someone who's ""depressed"" just cause he hasn't seen you one day and isn't just happy at the fact that he has you, then that's what you deserve. I tried showing you you deserved so much better and I thought maybe you were starting to see that, but I guess you must think pretty low of yourself if you think this is what you deserve.

"event","Well this week kinda stinks.  First off my computer has crapped out due to a virus I have no idea how I got.  There was orignally 3, Norton got rid of 2 of them and there's still one in there that I think attached to an important file.  Sometimes my computer will turn on, sometimes it goes to that blue screen.  I'm hoping that at least one more time it'll go back to Windows so I can at least save whatever I can, like my pictures and music, before my brother will most likely have to wipe out Windows and reinstall it.  And Secondly, I found out from my dad, that one of my aunts has a cancerous tumor behind her ribcage and they've been doing tests to see what they came do.  Other than that, things have been going their usual self.  Lol I got my first credit card which can be good or bad.  I'm just hoping my report card comes soon cause I have a feeling I did decently well and if I did, that means I can take it to the insurance company and get my insurance knocked down alittle more. Woo."

With the exception of Maria, because she knows why, don't go out of your way to make plans with someone, then, oh wow.  No phone call for the rest of the night, or let's make plans to hangout with someone after school and then it's almost 4:30 and no one's called yet.  Stop making people wait around for you to finally decide you wanna call someone, especially since, hmmm, Idk...not like any of you really have cars to drive yourself over somewhere, so I WONDER who would have to come pick you up..oh yea..me.  Don't waste my time waiting around for you to finally decide to hangout or to not even have the fucking respect to call and let someone know you're not gonna hangout or something came up.  Don't wanna give me that respect? Then don't call me, IM me, or ask me to hangout, because the answer will be no.  Don't waste my time, I have better things to do with it than waste it waiting for someone who doesn't even fucking care.  Signing off.  Suck my DICK.

PS- Oh and an added bonus I've always loved is when then someone can find the time for someone else the next day, or even that day."

"event","Fuck you all.  Don't make me feel bad for not driving people to somewhere no matter what the circumstances are.  FUCK YOU, I'M NOT YOUR FUCKING TAXI.  I drive you people around and most of the time I never see a fucking dime.  Especially from those of you who have a job and can well afford throwing 5 stinkin bucks my way for gas since I can bring you here, there and everywhere.  The only people I expect nothing from is Brian and Mike bc they drive me in their car.  I'm too nice of a person to ever ask any of you for money, but it never runs across anyones mind to say ""Hey gee, maybe since Melissa is bringing me somewhere, maybe I should throw a few bucks her way, especially since she's out of a job"" Now I'm getting the fucking guilty trip, THE FUCKING GUILTY TRIP from my best friend and I'm left to feel fucking bad for not wanting to drive, cause it's not like I don't drive all the fucking time with you guys, why bc those of you who are 18 or old enough don't have a license?  Why the FUCK should I have to go out of my way bc you're all too fucking lazy to get one?  Me driving you guys is a privlage, not a chore.  At least it shouldn't be, but it feels like lately that's all it is.  I get to feel bad, enough that I'm crying now that's how much like shit I feel bc my best friend gives me the sarcastic ""Thanks alot"" and my bf doesn't say anything bc he has to ""stay out of it"", while he was too fucking lazy a yr ago to get one, and by 18 only has his permit still?  Don't sit there and make me feel bad for not driving people somewhere when it's not my responsibility to.  You are not my fucking children, I am not your mommy or daddy, I do NOT have to bring you anywhere, but I do bc I love you guys, but lately all I've been feeling is USED.  Like all I am is a fucking taxi to you guys.  I AM NOT YOUR FUCKING CHAUFFEUR.  Why should I have to jump when one of you needs a ride somewhere or need to get dropped off at someone elses house or school or work.  Don't make me feel bad for not wanting to be responsible for someone's brother in my car either.  It's my car, making me responsible for the people in it.  God forbid something happen, it's my fault.  Remember a year ago, I already got into an accident and I was responsible for the 3 other people in that car that night, and it would of been my fault if something worse would of happened that night.  It's bad enough I have to drive you guys around and be responsible for you, but I don't need everyone in their brother and sister and cousins in my car, I don't need the added responsiblity.  And bc of that, since I won't drive them somewhere, don't give me the guilty trip bc they don't have a fucking ride there.  IT IS NOT MY RESPONSIBILTY TO DRIVE ANYONE ANWHERE.  Maybe when you guys start to realize that and I stop feeling like I'm nothing but a cab to you guys, then the rides will start happening again, til then, you can all walk.  I'm tired of being your fucking taxi ride, I'm your friend, not your fucking bitch."

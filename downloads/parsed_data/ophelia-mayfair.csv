I'm having fun at the party so far! It's still early in evening and everyone is showing up. Obviously Quinn is there already, Louis and Nicolas have just arrived as well. I wonder who else will make an apperance tonight. Gotta go, we're deciding on music and party games!"

The girls on the forum are having a slumber party and invited me! *giggles* I hope I dressed right and brought the right things for it...I've never been to a slumber party before. Scarlett and Meisha promise games and fun though so I shouldn't be worried....but I am. I'll put more here later, after the party. Gotta go!"

"event","Fair enough that I pick a song for myself and let everyone comment on the suitability of of it. The first that comes to mind is ""Do You See Me Now"" by Angtoria off their first album 'God Has A Plan For Us All'. It's so new that I couldn't find any lyrics for it online yet. But I did find a link to the full song on their official website that I'm linking here so everyone can listen to it. http://www.angtoria.com/sounds/AngtoriaDoYou_full.mp3 You can also listen to it and download it on their official myspace site at http://www.myspace.com/AngtoriaOfficial as well as listen to and download other tracks from their first album.

The other song I can think of at the moment that would suit me is ""Unwritten"" by Natasha Bedingfield. I managed to find the lyrics to this one.

""Unwritten""
Artist: Natasha Bedingfield

I am unwritten, can't read my mind, I'm undefined
Im just beginning, the pen's in my hand, ending unplanned

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you can not find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten

I break tradition, sometimes my tries, are outside the lines
We've been conditioned to not make mistakes, but I can't live that way

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you can not find

Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
But the rest is still unwritten

The rest is still unwritten
The rest is still unwritten"

"event","He is the one who made me. If any of you have been keeping up with the forum I'm on then you will know that he and I are currently ""butting heads"". I think that perhaps I remind him a bit too much of his younger self and that I'm just a bit too much like him for him to ever be fully comfortable with me around. The song I've chosen to represent how I currently feel about him is ""The Perfect Drug"" by Nine Inch Nails.

The Perfect Drug

I got my head but my head is unraveling
cant keep control can't keep track of where it's traveling
I got my heart but my heart's no good
you're the only one that's understood

I come along but I don't know where you're taking me
I shouldn't go but you're wrenching dragging shaking me
turn off the sun pull the stars from the sky
the more I give to you the more I die

and I want you

you are the perfect drug
the perfect drug
the perfect drug
the perfect drug

you make me hard when i'm all soft inside
I see the truth when i'm all stupid-eyed
the arrow goes straight through my heart
without you everything just falls apart

my blood just wants to say hello to you
my fear is warm to get inside of you
my soul is so afraid to realize
how every little bit is left of me

take me with you
without you everything just falls apart
it's not as much fun to pick up the pieces"

"event","Just because it seems like something fun to do I will try and find songs that I think fit other members of our undying coven. When possible I will also include  full lyrics, as well as my own thoughts as to why I think the song fits with who I picked it for. Hopefully it will give all of you a deeper insight into my thoughts on the other vampires I share my nights with. I'll place each song in it's own separate posting, please feel free to share your own thoughts on them."

"event","Well I have finally been convinced to make a foray into the wonderful world of blogging. Here is where all of you can read my thoughts on anything and everything. I'll try to keep to the things I don't post in other places. Please feel free to ask me things here, it will give me something to talk about beyond my normal nightlife. *laughs* As if any of us have anything close to what most would consider a ""normal nightlife"". And here I go running out of things to say at the moment....Yep, my pen has run dry, so to speak. So that's all for now."

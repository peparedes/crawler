Join us in standing up for reproductive health and education. Planned Parenthood, the organization that delivers reproductive health care, sex education and information to millions of people worldwide, has come under fire in the U.S. lately, with many politicians on both state and federal level seeking to end funding (and in a few cases succeeding).

During the month of May, you can send a specially designed Planned Parenthood vgift to your friends to help support this cause. (And if you need someone to send it to, <lj user=""frank"" /> is always happy to receive gifts!) There are three variations ($1, $5 and $10) for you to choose from, but they&#39;d all look good on your profile when your friends know that you stand by something so important.

Mississippi is voting on November 8th on whether to pass Amendment 26, the &quot;Personhood Amendment&quot;. This amendment would grant fertilized eggs and fetuses personhood status.

Putting aside the contentious issue of abortion, this would effectively outlaw birth control and criminalize women who have miscarriages. This is not a good thing.

<a href=""http://www.jacksonwomenshealth.com/"">Jackson Women&#39;s Health Organization</a> is the only place women can get abortions in the <i>entire</i> state, and they are trying to launch a grassroots movement against this amendment. This doesn&#39;t just apply to Mississippi, though, as Personhood USA, the group that introduced this amendment, is trying to introduce identical amendments in <i>all 50 states</i>.

What&#39;s more, in Mississippi, this amendment is expected to pass. It even has Mississippi Democrats, including the Attorney General, Jim Hood, backing it.

The reason I&#39;m posting this here is because I made a meager donation to the Jackson Women&#39;s Health Organization this morning, and I received a personal email back hours later - on a Sunday - thanking me and noting that I&#39;m one of the first &quot;outside&quot; people to contribute.

So if you sometimes pass on political action because you figure that enough other people will do something to make a difference, make an exception on this one. My RSS reader is near silent on this amendment. I only found out about it through a feminist blog. The mainstream media is not reporting on it.

If there is ever a time to donate or send a letter in protest, this would be it.

What to do?

- Read up on it. <a href=""http://www.wakeupmississippi.org/"">Wake Up, Mississippi</a> is the home of the grassroots effort to fight this amendment. <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/10/07/1023558/-Occupy-My-Uterus-My-Ass!-Fertilized-Eggs-Are-NOT-People!"">Daily Kos</a> also has a thorough story on it.

- If you can afford it, you can donate at the site&#39;s link.

- You can <a href=""http://www.democrats.org/contact"">contact the Democratic National Committee</a> to see why more of our representatives aren&#39;t speaking out against this.

- Like <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/WakeUpMississippiorg/237684486281516"">this Facebook page</a> to help spread awareness.

I have been notified that it was originally posted by <lj user=""suricattus""/> in her journal <a href=""http://suricattus.livejournal.com/1352599.html"">post</a>.  The story and words are hers, but I do believe that it needs to go viral and that as many people as possible need to get their stories out there.  Only by making a noise about this can we make a change in our society.)<br /><br />There is a move afoot in the nation -driven by the GOP - to repeal the new health care laws, to protect corporate interests, to defend against fear-mongering (and stupid) cries of &quot;socialism!&quot;, and to ensure that people are forced to choose between keeping a roof over their heads or getting necessary health care.<br /><br />This movement is killing people.<br /><br />Think I'm overstating the fact?<br /><br />Ask the friends and family of writer/reviewer Melissa Mia Hall, who died of a heart attack last week because she was so terrified of medical bills, she didn't go see a doctor who could have saved her life.<br /><br />From another writer friend: One person. Not the only one. That could have been me. Yeah, I have access to insurance -- I live in New York City, which is freelancer-friendly, and have access to freelancer advocacy groups. Through them, I can pay over $400/month ($5,760/year) as a single, healthy woman, so that if I go to the hospital I'm not driven to bankruptcy. But a doctor's appointment - a routine physical - can still cost me several hundred dollars each visit. So unless something's terribly wrong? I won't go.<br /><br />My husband worked for the government for 30 years. We have government employee (retired) insurance. It is the only thing of value he took away from that job. His pension is pitiful. He still works part time. My writing income has diminished drastically. Our combined income is now less than what it was before T retired fifteen years ago. Inflation has diminished it further. In the last 30 days I have racked up over $8000 in medical bills for tests and the beginning of treatment. Our co-pay is 20% after the deductible. And there is more to come. Our savings are already gone. I have the gold standard of insurance and I still can't pay all the medical bills.<br /><br />Another friend lost her insurance when her husband lost his job. She couldn't afford medication and ended up bed ridden for three months at the end of over a year of no job and therefore no insurance until he found work again.<br /><br />It's our responsibility. All of us, together. As a nation.<br /><br />EtA: Nobody is trying to put insurance companies out of business. They will always be able to offer a better plan for a premium. We simply want to ensure that every citizen - from infant to senior citizen - doesn't have to choose between medical care, and keeping a roof over their heads, or having enough to eat.<br /><br /><b>We're trying to get this to go viral. Pass it along</b>.<br /><br /><form action=""http://www.livejournal.com/update.bml"" method=""GET""><input type=""hidden"" name=""repost"" value=""http://ladyqkat.livejournal.com/509507.html"" /><input type=""submit"" value=""Post this to your journal"" /></form><br /><br />See my previous post for my opinion on this subject.</div>"

"event","&nbsp;My counterpart in the Seattle office quit last week. &nbsp;What this might mean for you? &nbsp;A full-time job with benefits. &nbsp;The pay isn't fantastic but it isn't horrible either and it is a foot in the door with the feds. &nbsp;The job would be in the federal building downtown on second in the Insolvency office (Insolvency=Bankruptcy) for the IRS. &nbsp;<br /><br />One of the truly awesome benefits is that once you've been there &nbsp;a year they will pay for you to take a class a quarter, including books and fees. &nbsp;The job provides lots of opportunities to study and you are on the inside track to lots of federal jobs. &nbsp;The health benefits are really nice and the premiums are deducted BEFORE tax.<br /><br />The job itself is what you make of it. &nbsp; It's a secretarial position but not necessarily a traditional one.&nbsp;<br /><br />Please apply for this job as soon as it pops up on USAJobs.gov!!!&nbsp;<br type=""_moz"" />"

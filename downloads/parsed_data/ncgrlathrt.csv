"event","wow another update in less then a month... i'm on a roll.

"event","SO its been about 10 months since I last updated.  Wow have things sure have changed since the last time I wrote in this thing.  One, I did end up quitting Sears, got anew job in December and quit just last week due to the fact that I got married, am starting to pack up my things because my new husband is going to Korea for a year and I cant go, so I am moving back in with my parents.  Yup that about sums up the past year or so... oh with a lot in between.  Maybe I'll start updating regularly, or maybe I'll update again in another 10 months... only time will tell"

"event","So my family came and went.  They arrived on the 6th and half of them left the 13th and my parents, brother and 2 cousins stayed an extra day adn left the 7th.  I miss my mom sooo much.  It was soo good to have her here and everyone for that matter.  My family met Davids family so that was good.  I was extremely anxious about it, but everyone got along great.  Everyone got really drunk that Saturday night and Sunday we had a big bbq.  Davids mom made awesome food and everyone hung out.  Davids parents left on Monday but Mrs. B ended up coming back on Wednesday and stayed the rest of the week.  We had a lot of fun, it consisted of us drinking about every night.  I hurt my foot (not my bad one) but it still hurts now.  And NO I wasn't drinking when I did it.  Haha.  David also made staff!  YEA!!  I am so extrely proud of him.  It was really sad to see my parents leave, I miss them a lot.  I am not going to see them again till the holidays.  Its hard not being able to just drive over there whenever I want.  I guess its all a part of growing up.  
Other then that I've been working a bunch.  I had off today so I took the opportunity to do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.  I finished Harry Potter which made me ball like a baby and I watched Gidget, which David bought me yesterday.  I love that movie.  It reminds me of hanging out with the girls in highschool.  I miss those days.  
Labor day weekend we're going to Havelock.  I am hoping it will be fun because it will probably be the last fun thing I do for awhile.  Well actually I take that back David and I are going to try and go to Havelock for the seafood festival which I've never been too.  We'll see though.  Oh and I'm trying to find another job.  My asshole boss quit the other day, he walked out in the middle of his shift, but I still want to quit as well.  I hate the job and I realize more and more each day that I'm getting screwed working there.  Its a long story though.  
Hmmm I guess that pretty much sums up whats going on with me. I know boring life I lead...
Oh well. Bye."

"event","So vacation has gone and past.  I started back to work yesterday.  I think I'm going to get fired from American Eagle though.  I am now full time at Sears and AE left me a couple of messages asking why I haven't showed up to work there.  Oh well.  Not to much has changed at Sears we're still trying to get rid of the fat ass Larry.  I hate that asshole.  GRrrrr

Anyway, Vacation was so wonderful.  (Besides the part where my car broke TWICE)  We started off at Jericas house on the first night getting really trashed off of Peach Ever Clear.  It was sooo tasty.  Too bad when I flew to PA the next day I felt worse then I ever have from the hangover.  I smelled like a big peach even though I had showered.  4th of July was a blast as usual.  It was good to see Elysha, Andrea, Christina, Corinna and Kari again.  There weren't any boys there so there wasn't any drama.  Yea for us!!  The drama took place in my sisters group of friends... Hopefully we passed along the tradition to them and we won't have any more.  The rest ofthe time I was home I just hung around.  None of my work people hung out with me :-(  I don't think they love me anymore... oh well.  I also went to Allentown for one night and hung out with Corinna, Jared, Dan and some girl named Ellen.  It was pretty fun, we went to 3 different bars and I only spent 11 dollars.  I'm good like that, thats why!  Haha, too bad my friends just love me and paid for all my drinks!  I was also supposed to go to AC one night but I didn't have the money...  I hate being an adult!  I did go to the beach one day with Julie, Christina and my sister.  I got a nice base for my tan and we ate yummy pizza on the boardwalk.  I miss laughing at Christina all the time...  That girl is hilarious (Free breakfast... I'm too tired... My belly buttons deeper!!) Hahaha  good times.  Then I came back to NC, I was sad to leave my parents again but I sure did miss David.  It was the first time we had been apart for more then 2 days in like 5 months.  But Havelock was fun for the most part.  Thursday was pretty boring, but Friday I hung out with Jeannie all day.  We went to the beach, had lunch, did some shopping and that night us David and Kenny went to dinner then got nice and drunk at Fast Freddies.  I miss hanging out with Jeannie.  We used to be best friends, and I am glad its getting back to the way things used to be!  FF was a blast though, our girls night ended up happening that night.  Saturday night we were supposed to have another, but Jeannie and I were pretty hung over, even though the beach helped.  We were supposed to go see the Chip and Dales dancers.  Noelle is good friends with one of them, but by the time we got there we missed the whole show.  We took a pic with them and some nasty sweaty stripper grabbed my arm and slapped it on his ass.  That was sooo not HOT YUCK!!  But Jeannie and I ended up leaving because Jerica got really drunk and Noelle wanted to hang out with the nasty gay strippers so we both went home and went to bed.  Sunday we went to the beach and then went to see The Wedding Crashers.  I loved that movie, everyone should go see it, it's soo damn funny!  Then David and I made the 5 hour trip back to SC.  BOOOO I want to be on vacation still.

Soo, vacation was great, I got the tan I wanted, got to see almost everyone I wanted to see and had a ton of fun.  Now I am looking forward to my parents coming down in the beginning of August, and Labor day in Sept.  I can't believe how fast those 2 things are approaching.  Summer is rapidly coming to an end even though I feel like it just began!  Oh well, hopefully theres good times to come!
Thats it for now

"event","Wow, I haven't updated in almost 2 months... I guess I've been too busy and nothing really interesting has happened.  All I do is work, every day from morning till night.  This 2 jobs thing is wearing me out.  It seems like I rarely get to see David and we live together.  But that will hopefully change because in July I am going home to Pennsylvania for about a week and a half and then after I get back I am going to go full time at Sears and quit American Eagle or maybe work one day a week.  And I know what everyones probably thinking... I'm going full time at Sears and I'm still working in the auto center... well to be perfectly honest, I am thourghly enjoying it there.  I am learning so much and its something I can carry with me for the rest of my life.  Everyone says I am catching on quickly and a lot of people seem to be amused that I'm some prissy girl selling tires and stuff.  Ahhh well, I guess if I put my mind to something, I can accomplish it.  
But other then that nothing much else is going on.  I haven't seen any of my friends in forever.  We couldn't make it to Nelsons actual graduation because David and I both had to work.    I really want to go back to school.  I don't know when I'll financially be able to do it but I hope to go back sometime in the next year or 2.  Wish me luck on that, I gotta start looking into it.  
Hmmm, Reggie is doing good.  Hes still a ferocious little puppy always trying to chew everything into pieces.  But hes doing well.  After we get back we might get him a little sister.  We're not sure yet but we're going to look into it.  
I cant wait to go to PA and see my family.  I havent seen them since I left.  Thats why I'm going back for more then a few days. Davids only staying a couple and then hes driving back to go hang out in Havelock.  
Alright well I guess thats it for anohter 2 months..."

"event","So my 22nd birthday came and went.  It was this past Tuesday.  Nothing too eventful happened.  We went and picked up our puppy from Davids parents and had lunch with them.  (They watched him while we were in Georgia).  Then I came home and relaxed and had a lazy day.  The best kind ;-)

Sooo last weekend we went to Georgia to see Nelson.  Susanna and Colin met David and I here at our house at about 4 or so, and at about 4:30 we left for Georgia.  It was QUITE the interesting trip.  On the way down we stopped at a gas station to pee and some lady threatened to call the cops on us because we wouldn't pick up all the trash around the trashcan ourside of the store which included a HUGE cup of dip spit spilled over... its a long story but in the end the cops werent called and we got their customrer service number to give them a scare.  We got down there at like 10:30 or 11 at night and checked into our hotel.  Then we were off to search for something to eat.  We made a wrong turn and ended up in Alabama... It was hilarious, we were there for exactly 2 miles, one mile in, and one mile out.  We ended up with Taco Bell and then went back to get some sleep.  Kenny and Jeannie ended up thei rin the middle of the night.  Saturday morning we had to get up early since Nelsons ceremony started at 9:30.  We got there and met up with Nelsons parents and Marie and Sam.  It was so cute watching Nelson marching around.  It was weird to see him all proper and everything.  After the ceremony we met up with him and everyone went to the liquor store to stock up and then we went to the cabin on the lake where Nelsons parents were staying.  It was really fun out there, Nelsons mom and aunt cooked us a fantastic lunch and then we rented canoes and went canoeing.  The girls kicked ass by the way!!  Yea for us!!!  There was also this sign that said something about not feeding the alligators which we thought was a load of crap, until we actually saw a HUGE alligator just hanging out in the middle of the water right off our dock.  It was crazy.  Everyone hopped ito the canoes and sped after it except me and jeannie.  THey left us on the dock to hang out with our furry cattipillar friend... (haha you'd have to be there to understand!)  Anyways, that night everyone came back to our hotel room and drank.  We had a lot of fun.  Susanna, Jeannie, Marie and I had some good quality girl time.  Jeannie and Susanna ended up jumping into the pool by the end of the night... it was awesome.  Sunday we hung out with Nelson a littl bit more and then made the long trip back.  Over all it was such a great weekend.  I am glad that us girls got along so much.  I was very happy to have them there, I can't wait till we can do it again.  We're suppsoed to go down in May for Nelsons graduation but David might have to work so we dont know if we can make it or not.  I hoep we can though because this time we're supposed to stay in one of the cabins on the lake.  Hmmm we'll see. 

Other then that nothing else is really going on.  I started working for American Eagle this past monday and I already hate it.  I can't stand my store manager.  She's an ignorant bitch.  I also went and peed in the cup and so now I can start training at Sears on Thursday.  I am going to work in the auto department selling tires and stuff so that should be quite the experience.  Its something different then typical retail though so I am looking foward to it.  
Ahhh but I guess thats it for now, till next time...

"event","So the past 4 days have been rather interesting... Wednesday morning David woke me up with a new little puppy.  His name is Reggie and hes a black lab/golden retriever mix.  Hes all black except for about 10 hairs on his chest... he is the cutest thing EvEr!!!  Hes sound asleep right now, but unfortunately it wont last the entire night.  We have to let him out about twice in the middle of the night so he won't go in the house... *Knock on Wood* hes actually doing alright, right now.  
Other then the puppy, I am exhausted.  We spent all day in the yard cleaning up.  Doesn't sound like much but when your sitting on almost 2 acres of land and they haven't been raked since November... that equals a lot of freaken raking and a few blisters to go with it.  Blah, oh well.  This is the first weekend we've been home in awhile.  Its nice.  Its weird because even though I am living here, we go away so much, I'm still having a hard time getting adjusted.  
Hopefully by the end of next week I will have a job.  I am supposed to find out about the American Eagle thing and I also have an interview with Sears.  I'm not to crazy about working there, but I am going to take what I can get.  
Next weekend we are going to Georgia to see Nelson.  Hopefully everything will run smoothly and we will all have a good time.  It will be David and I, Susanna and Colin, and Jeannie and Kenny.  I also think his sister and maybe brother are going down but I'm not sure.  We're going to leave early Friday afternoon and head back on Sunday some time.  
Last weekend we were supposed to go to Myrtle Beach and last minute we didn't end up doing it.  Instead we went to Havelock and hung out with Will and Kristen almost the whole weekend because Will left Tuesday for Korea for a year.  Crazy that 2 people from Havelock are going to be in Korea at the same time... what are the odds!?!?  We had fun though.  The most interesting thing we did was go to the Newport Mudbog with Jeannie and Kenny.  It was a whole other world in itself.  A lot of fun but definately strange.  We got drunk out there.  You drink beer and stand there watching big trucks race through the mud.  Some girl was super trashed when we first got out there and she showed me her ""cool"" bottle opener... Needless to say I ended up with Beer all down the front of my pants.  It was not cool at all but really messy and an annoyance since it was chilly out there and it added to me being cold.  Oh well I just got drunk and forgot about it.  
Hmmm well I guess thats it for now.  I know my life is pretty uneventful except for drunk girls spilling beer all over me.  
Oh well."

"event","Well I have my car here in South Carolina now!  It was a bitch getting it here though.  We had to drive a whole bunch.  Last weekend we went to Havelock so I could get my car.  But first Friday at 3pm I had an interview with Bath and Body Works.  Now it was for a leadership position, but the whole thing is kinda shady so I am going to pass on that... 

But anyhow, we went to Havelock and Friday night we went to BJ's with Kenny and Will and hung out.  I was DD and the everyone got pretty drunk, except me.  Thats ok though because I was very tired.  Saturday we went with those 2 again to Green Springs to take pictures to send to Nelson.  I had never been so that was pretty interesting.  Then later that night Michelle and I headed over to Tishias house to see the new baby.  She's pretty cute, and extremely happy.  She didn't fuss one time.  After that I went back to Davids and we went with Kenny, Jeannie, and Will to Ruby Tuesdays to eat a late dinner and have a drink.  After that we went back to Davids parents house and sat around.  Jeannie and I spent a while reminiscing (or however you spell it) about highschool.  It was fun, I missed her all these years.  Sunday was Easter.  I was a little sad becasue I didn't get to spend it with my family this year.  ITs the first time ever for me.  BUt I didnt have time to dwell on it because we went to Davids sisters house for dinner.  Now since I had to bring my car back I had to follow David in his truck and his parents had a different vehicle.  So we drove almost 3 hours there and then after dinner David and I had to drive both our cars almost 4 hours back home.  So thats what I meant by all the driving.  But we had a really nice dinner.  I enjoyed hanging out with his older sister and brother in law.  I had only met them one other time.  

Sooo anyways this week I have been enjoying being able to go to the grocery store in my own car instead of taking Davids big old truck which I can barely drive.  I went to a differnt mall last night with him and I have an interview with American Eagle next week.  I hope this one works out because I love there clothes and would love to have a discount.  Today I layed out and I am starting to get some sun... actually I am a little bit burnt.  Especially my face... Oh well it'll be worth it in the end!  Hmmm but other then all of that, this weekend we're going back to Myrtle Beach with Kenny, Jeannie, Will, and Kristen.  We're spending the whole weekend there and its Wills last one before he heads to Korea for a year.  So hopefully this weekend will be just as fun as the last time we went.  
Alright I guess thats it for now...

"event","Sooo Elysha came and went.  Her and Keith got here at 5:30 in the morning 2 saturdays ago.  We didn't do much but I had fun.  David had to work all weekend which completely sucked but we made do.  Saturday night Keith, Elysha, me, and Keiths friend Shawn went out to eat and then we came back here and drank some beer and played cards.  Sunday Elysha and I layed out, but we didnt get tan :(  BOOOOO that night we ate pizza and watched movies that didn't make sense.  Monday Elysha and I made a FABULOUS dinner for Keith and David.  We did damn good.  (we made chicken parmesan)  Then we watched more movies that didn't make sense.  Tuesday they left.  It was really good to see Elysha though, I haven't really hung out with her in such a long time.  

This past weekend was kind of crazy.  Friday we arrived in Havelock at 6:30 in the morning.  I took a nap because I hadn't slept since the day before, and David ran some errands.  Then I got up about 11 and it was time to car hunt.  We called a million people and we finally found this 95 Grand am that we were going to buy and we had an appointment with the guy at 4:30.  So we went back to Davids house and started to takea  nap when about 3:00 the guy calls and says that his wife sold the car.  So we got up and started the hunt all over again.  We drove all over Havelock and test drove a Jetta.  Well that car wasn't worth 5 dollars.  The sunroof didnt work the locks were broken off, the radio didn't even turn on and to top it off the spedometer didnt move, not eve a little bit!  So we headed to Newport and Morehead.  We didn't find anything in Morehead, so on the way back we stopped off at this car dealership in Newport.  Right away a guy targeted us.  He somehow suckered us into to getting a credit check and we bought my car.  I turned out to be very happy with this, but it all happened so fast.  Those guys really get you.  Anyway, its a 2001 Ford Focus.  Its red, and is better then the other stuff we were looking at so I am happy.  I didn't really care what I drove but now that its this it makes me feel safer then driving a really old car.  

So anyway, after the car searching was over we went to dinner with Will, Kristen, Amanda, and Kenny.  It was the first time I had seen Kristen and Will since the summer after graduation.  We had a fun time at Texas Steak house even though the food wasn't that great.  Saturday was a lot of fun.  David and I went to a concert with his friend John and Johns friend DJ.  We saw New Found Glory and Reggie and the Full Affect.  It was such a good show. It was at the House of Blues and we ate dinner there before it started.  After that about 12, we headed back to the hotel where we met up with DJ's friend Sarah.  We all took a cab to Broad Street or whatever and went to some dance club where Sarah bought us all drinks and shots.  This girl was the epitome of Andrea.  She acted exactly like her.  It made me miss her.  Since we were only at that club for about 40 minutes before it closed we decided to go to a strip club.  We went and bought a couple of cases of beer and headed over there with our crazy cab driver Marie.  It was mine and Davids first time.  It was quite hte interesting experience.  It was a full nude place and I was not expecting that.  Oh well we had a blast.  About 4 we headed back to the hotel again and drank a few more beers and passed out. Sunday we came home.  

It was a very good weekend.  Probably the most eventful one I have had in a very long time.  This coming weekend we are going back to Havelock to pick up my car and then on Sunday we are having Easter dinner at Davids sisters house.  I am going ot start job hunting soon, so everyone wish me luck!!!

I guess thats it for now..."

"event","So I have been living here for one month and 4 days.  I still don't have a car which sucks, but hopefully that will be solved within the next 2 weeks.  Since I've been here David and I have been to Havelock 2 or 3 times.  We hung out with Jeannie and Kenny a little bit and the one weekend we hugn out with Sean and Maria and we went to Tryon Palace.  That was a lot of fun.  There will be pictures up soon.  Last weekend I was supposed to get a car but it ended up falling through.  The good thing about that is, that the budget for my car went up.  But last weekend we hugn out with Sean, Colin, and Susanna, we had a really good time.  I love them they are 3 of my favorite people.  I'm going to miss Sean.  It sucks we couldnt go home this weekend, Davids actually at work right now.  At least Elysha is still coming to visit.  So I wont be here all by myself while theres a murderer on the loose.  Today I drove Davids big ass truck to Food Lion by myself.  It doesnt sound like much but I am not used to driving anything that big.  Well I guess this is a very boring entry.  I dont have much going on. Next weekend we are going to Myrtle Beach.  I am excited.  Hopefully it will be nice weather and stuff.

I have kind of settled into the same routine every day.  I have yet to get a job.  Hopefully that will all change very shortly.  I am supposed to get a car this weekend... I can't wait.  Aftet that is settled it will be much easier to find a job since I will be able to get myself too and from every day.  
Other then that, I really miss my family.  It's hard being this far away from my mom.  I miss her so much.  I miss everyone else as well.  I have talked to quite a few people since I've been here.  I have talked to a bunch of old work people and I have talked to Christina and Elysha several times.  They are both supposed to venture down though, so I am really looking forward to that.  I just hope they can handle the being in the middle of nowhere...  we'll see though!
ALright well this is short but I'll update more later, now that our internet works!

"event","So, I think it's actually starting to hit me that I am moving in a week.  I was sitting here writing out my checks for my bills and I have to put in my change of address on all of them.  I still can't get over how quickly it all happened.  Last week (Mon-Thurs) we spent our time cleaning out my store.  We weren't open or anything, we had to ship stuff out, have stores pick stuff up stuff and we had to rent a moving truck 2 days in a row and order 2 dumpsters to throw stuff away.  It was a lot of physical work and we were all pretty sore by day 4.  But us 3 managers and our keyholder were the last 4 in the store.  It was really sad, I wanted to cry which sounds stupid, but I have been working there for 3 and a half years.  It was so utterly empty and depressing, our sign wasnt even above the store on the outside.

Anyways, enough about that...  Friday I went to Allentown one last time.  I haven't been there in over a year, so it was kind of weird going up there.  Friday night Corinna, Jared and I went to the bar which was a lot of fun.  I got soo drunk.  So Saturday I was hungover all day long.  Saturday night though Corinna and I went to dinner then us 2 Jared and her older brother his girlfriend and his daughter all went bowling which was really fun.  They had kareoke and Kari was trashed and sang like 8 songs.  It was hilarious.  I didn't really get that drunk so there was no way in hell I was going to sing.  After that we went to Corinnas house where her 2 older brothers got in a huge fight.  It was bad and made me and Jared really uncomfortable.  Oh well what ya gonna do?  Other then that Sunday we spent the day watching MTV and then I came home.  I was in bed by 10 last night and I slept till 10 today.  It was some very much needed sleep.  

So today I should really start packing, I really have to get to it, I have a lot to do and I know this week is going to go by fast.  Saturday is my going away party and Sunday is the superbowl.  Monday morning I am headed out.  Its definately going to be a major change for me.  I just hope that I'm up to it.  I am actually kind of scared.  Its going to be weird living 10 hours from my parents and starting over completely.  I just hope everythign works out between David and myself.  Only time will tell though...

Well I guess thats it, the next time I update I could be living in my new home... wish me luck!

"event","Today I almost punched a lady in the face.  It was 25 minutes after my store had opened for the day.  It was a grand time, I had not been that angry in a loong loonnnngggg time.  I would explain, but enless you work in retail you would have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about.  To make a long story short, she tried to scam her way into winning the situation, but I of course won because she was a dumb bitch who needs to burn in hell... 

Ok enough venting about a customer whos name I dont even remember...  I can't believe this time in a month I'll be living in South Carolina.  Things are moving sooo quickly.  I mean David was pushing for me to move in February anyway, but I told him there wasn't anyway I could possibly do it.  Then I find out that the store is getting shut down.  It seems as though fate like made it happen that way.  I know a lot of people don't believe in that kind of stuff but I do.  I mean why else would I be out of a job at the end of January.  Especially since it works out that David was taking leave the first week of February anyway so it only makes sense to move down then.  I guess it truly is time for me to be a ""big girl now"".  Its going to be sooo different being so far away from my parents and its going to be really weird living with a boy.  Even if it is David and the closest person to me.  Hmmm, I am just going to take things one day at a time, thats all I can do.

Other then that, nothing much else has been going on.  I had my work holiday party this past Sunday night.  All I have to say about that is, I am staying away from Vodka for awhile.  I was so sick the whole next day.  Oh well everyone told me I was there entertainment.  

Well I guess thats it for now.  I have a busy few weeks ahead of me.  My store is getting emptier and emptier, and it seems that more and more people are shopping every day... figures since we're closing.  I also have to start packing up some stuff this weekend.  Blah, so much to do and I don't know how to get started... 
Wish Me Luck!!!  (I'm gonna need it)"

"event","Sooo it's been a long time since I've had the internet.  So much has happened... I guess I'll highlight the important parts.  David came here for Thanksgiving.  It was the first time I've seen him since the beginning of October so it was great.  We decided I would move in April.  THEN... the holiday season wasn't as busy as expected at my store.   So Christmas comes and goes, it wasn't that fabulous, I was actually kind of depressed about the whole thing.  Then I have plane tickets to go to NC on the 29th of December.  The 28th, I am at work and low and behold our district manager shows up... not bearing good news let me add.  He informs us that they're shutting down our store and none of us will have jobs after January 31st.  To make a long story short, after discussing this with David, my parents, and his parents I am moving to South Carolina the first week of February.  Everything seems to be moving so fast, and I just hope that I can handle it.  Well its time to get ready for work where EVERYTHING will be on sale...  

When I have more time I'll fill in some details..."

I was in Kutztown this past weekend.  It was a lot of fun.  I miss CHristina a lot.  I am going to really miss her once I move away.  We hung out with the bonner hall rats all weekend.  Curly, Travis, and Jenkins.  They're really good guys.  As much as they try to be womanizers they are just to sweet for their own good.  Haha me and Christina were showing our new freshman friend the way.  We told him hes a good boy just like David and Tim and not to change into the the jerks like the rest of Kutztown.  AHHH too bad the ditchers becamse the ditchees this weekend, serves us right after all this time of being such bitches to people...  HAHAHA oh well no sweat off our backs.

"event","So it looks like things might ACTUALLY be falling into place for me right now.  I have hope for the first time in a very very long time.  This is why...  it looks like I am going to be able to actually set a date for moving down to South Carolina, so I can finally be with David.  He is moving away from his room-mate Joe, and is moving into our future house on the 15th of this month.  Since hes going out on his own, this means he wont be in another lease with someone else till the end of next year.  SOOO the plan is to be out of here by hopefully late spring early summer.  Which is about 7 months sooner then I thought originally.  It is an awesome deal that he got, the house is 3 bedrooms, only one bath but thats ok, and it sits on 2 and a half acres of land.  It has a two car garage attached to the house.  Our (neighbor) is a guy that he works with and is actually the one who got him in with the owners to get the house.  I am sooo ecstatic about this right now... I finally think that things are falling into place.  I just hope that things keep going according to plan, so that someday soon, I will be back to my happy self again."

Tomorrow is my second and Thursday is the third one.  My driving guy named Fred, who is about 60 years old told me he would schedule the test for me so I could drive in his car since I would be used to it.  Hes so nice.  Hes been doing this for 25 years.  I just hope that I can get through this so I can finally join the human race and I'll be able to drive like most 21 year olds my age.  Sooo wish me luck!

Other then that, I have been working NONSTOP.  I am just glad the holidays are coming up so we will FINALLY be busy.  I cant stand the slowness.  I guess all of us at good ol' Eddie Bauer are planning a baby shower for Bev.  Yea she surprisingly had a baby the other night.  She went in because she got some broken ribs and is coming out with a child.  CRAZINESS, she never even knew.  Never skipped a period or anything.  If anything that scares the HELL out of me!  I dont know what I would do.  

Hmmm, I wanted to go down to North Carolina for the weekend of Nov 12-14 but it looks like I cant now.  I think I am going to try and head up to good ol' KU one more time before the holidays.  I miss Christina, its hard hanging out with her every day... I miss you Christina my love!!

Alright well I guess thats it for now, my life is pretty boring.  Actually I am going to go out on Halloween night with Alyssa and a bunch of other people I work with.  We're going to go see Staceys band play.  It should be fun.  We all have to dress up and I have no idea what I am going to be so if anyone has suggestions, comment to me where it says ""Comments"" to give me some ideas!!  Thanks!

This weekend was so much fun.  It went by entirely too fast.  Each and every single time I am here I realize more and more how much I need to be here.  It's like I transform into this entirely different person.  I don't look at the world so negatively and I actually enjoy myself.  I feel for the first time in a few years that I am truely happy and where I belong.  It is getting harder and harder to go back to Philadelphia.  When I am there I just go through the motions.  I dont feel like I have a place there, I pretty much have no friends and the people I can actually CALL my friends don't even live near me.  I am alone all the time.  But, all in all, in the end I know I have to be patient.  I can only hope for the day that I can wake up and truely be content where I'm at."

"event","Sooo, I am sitting in Christinas room right now watching TV.  I got here on Friday around 6:15.  I am going home in a few hours though :(  I really miss it up here.  Friday Christina and I drank like a handle of vodka and then went out.  Needless to say we were trashed.  My phone somehow broke.  I have the WORST LUCK!!  Oh well, it was time for a new one  anyways, and plus I need to switch my plan.  I fucken hate sprint!!  They are the worst, but I need the company because of the sprint to sprint calling.  Its the only way David and I can communicate.  Last night, we made an appearance at Double Deckers.  I got a free cup because the muffin loves me.  Yea for jungle juice!  They Christina and I left and headed to Mommas but then we got a call to go down to the old crow house to hang out with the Matts and stuff but we got there and the cops were there.  So we ate pizza in Camillos and I had the worst long island iced I have ever drank.  So we left headed over to say Hi to the boys and there were all these drunk freshman sluts.  Blah, and we just headed back.  

Its so weird being back.  The short time that they have been back here, and I haven't been being here makes me feel sooooo old.  Like we're at these parties and I see these drunk girls hanging all over every boy around, and I just know how dumb they are.  I really feel like I've grown up in that sense.  I have the most awesome boyfriend in the world and I am so passed feeling like I constantly need someone paying attention to me if I am out.  David is the only person I ever want or need.  He is the absolute best thing that has ever happened to me, and being here this weekend has made me realize that even more so then I thought before.  I love him and thats all I need.

Alright well I guess thats it for now.  It was so great hanging out with Christina this weekend.  She is my best friend and it was so refreshing ot hang out with her again.  I just hope that everything works out for her and she gets the CA job because she doesnt deserve the room-mate she has now.  I mean who wants to live with a black lesbian?  Thats rough, and with her work load she needs the time to herself. Well thats it for now...
Till next time...

Not a whole lot has been going on, I pretty much work every day and if I'm not working I seem to have stuff to do.  The only big thing that happened was last Friday, David and Nelson came up to visit me.  It was a lot of fun.  Friday we went out to eat and stuff then that night we drank at my house for awhile, then went to the bar with Emily and Kenny.  Nelson hit on random girls but got majorly cock-blocked... hahaha it was hilarious.  Saturday we were supposed to go into the city but we were a little hungover and Christina came down anyways.  So instead Nelson, David, and I went to the mall while Christina slept.  Nelson bought a jacket from Eddie Bauer, and we convinced him to open a credit. Hahaha, oddly enough, he was approved.  So of course I told him to rip it up immediately.  That night, my dad made us some good bbq chicken and we played 4 hours of asshole with my parents.  Everyone got wasted and I got to spend some bonding time with Christina.  We haven't had that in awhile.  I miss her sooo much.  Sunday we ordered pizza and finally went into the city.  Sunday night my parents made us a huge dinner and then we rented movies from blockbuster.  Monday everyone left.  
Thats when I started getting sad again...  I hate living so far away from David and now that I am not at school, I dont even have Christina or anyone else for that matter close to me anymore.  I hate feeling like I'm alone all the time, but thats how it is.  I know I have at least another whole year of this ahead of me and I am just hoping that I can some how make it through."

In NC, I got to see everybody, and I saw a whole bunch of people I havent seen since graduation.  It was great catching up with everyone.  We went to Seans graduation at Western.  It was a lot of fun hanging out at Colins apartment, and then camping on Saturday night.  Let me just say this, if you want to meet the most back woods rednecks, go camping in the mountains of NC.  The people we were camping down from had a crystal meth lab (so we all think) in their humble little campsight and had been living there for 2 months, so they say.  CrAzInEsS!!  Despite the little bit of drama with Ryan, everything went well and we didnt get eaten by a grizzly bear or shot by a toothless redneck.  I'm just glad Carey was there, we bonded being the only 2 girls.  That Sunday we went on the ropeswing in the lake.  Well I should say, I ""TRIED"" to go on the rope swing... I wasnt too successful.  Oh well at least I gave it a shot.  Other then that, I spent my time hanging out at the beach the first week and then drinking beer at our hurricane parties and our tropical depression parties.  Yea, so I am there for 2 weeks and we get hit by 2 hurricans and a tropical storm.  How ironic is that, I went there to go to the beach and I couldn't even go the last week I was there because it rained every day.  

Other then that... I got home on Monday afternoon.  I was hysterically crying saying bye to David at 7:00 that morning and I ran into 2 of my old friends dads.  WEIRD  One of the girls I knew since 8th grade now lives in KOP and is married.  Damn we're getting old.  But now its back to work and back to just talking to David on the phone.  I came home and everything was soooo different at work.  A million things have changed in the 2 weeks I was gone.  I am no longer going to be an associate manager, and instead I am going to go straight to the assistant.  Whatever, so long as its more money.  Last night we went bowling with Eddie Bauer.  It was fun until the end of the night when Andrea had to start her theatrics, and completely ruin it for me.  I am done with her, shes not worth my time or energy any more.  All she ever does is make me feel down about myself anyways.  Oh well, ya win some ya lose some.

Alright well thats pretty much it for the updates, now I must get ready for work, when all I really want to do is go back to sleep.  I haven't been able to sleep since I've been home.  I think it has to do with the fact that Davids not next to me every night.  I miss him sooo much.
Alright well thats it.  
Till next time..."

Last night and today are taking forever to go by though.  I was supposed to go to Tommys baketball game last night but it got cancelled from the rain so that left me with an extra hour and a half of time to pack.  I successfully got everything into one suitcase though.  Hahaha, for the first time in my life...

The time is going sooo slowly.  I just got off the phone with Michelle, I miss her so much.  We were supposed to hang out during my layover tonight but instead my 2nd flight got cancelled and they put me on an earlier flight.  So that means I have to haul ass across the airport to get to my next flight.  Oh well at least I am arriving in New Bern 2 hours earlier.

I got a job promotion.  Eddie Bauer asked me to be associate manager.  It means more money and more hours so at least if I am not going to school, I will actually be making some money.  I am nervous though.  I am sure things will work out for the best in the end.  

I had my ""annual womens doctor appointment"" today.  Good times... or NOT!!  Blah its tough being a girl sometimes.  At least I dont have to deal with that for at least another 365 days.  

On a lighter note... this time in 4 days I will be sitting on a plane getting ready to take off for Charlotte.  I can't wait.  Michelle and Laura are going to hang out with me while I have to wait in Charlotte for my connecting flight to New Bern.  I will arive at 11:15 Saturday night.  I am sure half of my friends will be drunk picking me up.  I can't wait.  Hahaha... I cant wait to actually move down there someday, I sure do miss it.  Its going to take some time though, more then I would like to admit.

4th of July was a blast.  The only 2 things that sucked were, that Christina couldnt participate in the all day drinking festivities because of her teeth (FEEL BETTER MY LOVE!!) and David and I got in the stupidest argument ever.  Don't worry things were resolved after a little bit of drunken bantering.  I guess thats what 10 hours of drinking will do to you.  A lot of people came though.  David, Andrea, Elysha, Jackie, Christina, Corinna, Keith (Elyshas boyfriend), Miller, and Jared all showed up.  Everyone stayed the night, It was wall to wall bodies.  I just hope everyone had fun.  

Other then that, the rest of my weeks till I head to NC will be spent working.  I have nothing else to look forward to but that.  I can't wait, we might go to warp tour and then we are going to see Sean graduate from Western.  We might even go to Bush Gardens.  Of course theres the beach as well.

We gave the dog a bath, took a nap, ate dinner then baked 7 dozen cookies and a batch of brownies.  Andrea came over right after that and we dyed and cut my hair and decorated for my sisters graduation party saturday.  We ended up getting really drunk and I flipped out on the phone with David but now everything is ok.  Saturday we had to run a bunch of errands and then everyone showed up and started drinking.  We drank all day, Christina, Andrea and Corinna were here of my friends.  I got pictures of the whole family including my grandmother doing jello shots!  Hahaha... good times!!  That night was the only dramatic part.  The neighbor whos wife was here also tried to feel up on all of my friend and I and my little sister.  Things took a turn for the worst and the cops came and everything else.  My dad literally tried to kill the guy but in the end he luckily didn't.  He would have gone to jail for sure if me and my sisters friend didn't hold him back.  But anyways... besides that part of it, everything else was a really fun day.  Sunday Christina and I spent the day watching movies and the Real World marathon.  All and all it was a really fun weekend and I can't wait for the 4th of July.  I just hope its even as half as fun as last year because last year was the best.  (oh and hopefully David will be here then too)

(Obviously I still feel bitter about that)  Anyway we spent most of the weekend at Ramons beach condo.  It was awesome.  I miss all of them so much.  I felt like I was home again.  I also visited Mr. B my old band instructor.  Lyn (my actual instructor for colorguard) wasnt there though.  I miss highschool also.  Blah I am really starting to feel really old.  

Other then that... I had the greatest time spending 9 days with David.  I could not be happier since I've been with him.  He means the world to me.  

Alright well I am off to bed, I didn't sleep well last night, but I guess thats what 14 hours of being stuck on a bus next to strangers does to you.

Night night, Sweet dreams everyone!"

Anyways... all I have been doing the past week is working.  It's going I guess.  Its as boring as ever but oh well its a job.

Tonight is my sisters senior prom... I feel old.  On top of that I found out that Matt and Amanda are going to have a baby.  WOW we are all growing up so fast (well some of us anyways) and it seems like just yesterday I was at my senior prom.

Well I guess thats it for now..."

"event","Today is mine and David's 4 month!!  YEA!  Haha I am a dork, and I don't care.  
Other then that Summer is completely boring.  The most excitement I have had was Elysha and I went to Andreas softball game.  Good times let me tell ya.  Then that night we ordered food and hung out with Andreas drunk little sister and her ""softball boys"".  They are ummm interesting to say the least.  NOTHING like the boys of last summer.  Actually these boys are complete dorks compared to the ones from last summer.  It's amazing how much things have changed from one year to the next.  All I know is I don't know how I am going to survive the summer without Elysha.  I better just pray I get to work a lot so I can avoid that bad situation.  Things are bad at Andreas... and I am getting to the point where I don't really want anything to do with it.  
Eddie Bauer is the EXACT SAME.  It hasn't changed in the last almost 3 years I have worked there.  I am sooo bored with it, with good reason considering no one even shops there in the summer, and if they do its old bitchy people.  I get along with everyone on staff, but everyone I was close too, even the employees from this past Christmast are gone.  BOOOO I dont know what I am going to do...
I am not satisfied with anything lately.  Well I take that back, I am satisfied with the relationship I am in.  At least I have that going for me.  Lets just hope I don't fuck it up."

"event","So I have been home for 6 days now.  Today will be my 2nd day back at Eddie Bauer.  I don't know how I feel about it.  I think I am bored with the job, but oh well.  Susannah the 3rd assistant manager is leaving and moving to Georgia.  I think she is nice, in a way I dont want her to leave because I dont know what other asshole they'll get to fill the position.  Probably some bitch.  Every other manager they have found has sucked, and even Susannah in the beginning until they had to have a talk with her.  Actually I take that back, Sarah was awesome.  I wish she would come back.  

Anyway... I hung out with Andrea and some boys she plays softball with the other night.  They were all nice boys.  Andrea is still spiraling downward though.  I don't know what to do... I dont think I will be hanging out with her that much this summer, I can't let her drag me down.  Plus I hope to just work a lot and I am going to SC and NC this summer.  

Well thats pretty much it for now..."

"event","Wow 2 years down.  I am waiting for my parents to arrive so I can leave for summer.  Its hard to believe that I won't be returning to Schuylkill next year.  I have lived in the same room for 2 years.  Next year I will be in Bonner.  Hopefully that works out alright, even if the rooms are smaller.  This year had a lot of ups and downs.  The downs weren't so great, but the ups were definately what made this year worthwhile.  Thanks to everyone who contributed in making this year have its many fun times and crazy adventures.  I will miss everyone, and I hope everyone keeps in touch.  

Don't forget about a few things...
1.  Many many times partying it up in 214 schuylkill and 305 bonner
2.  Superbowl party YAY!!!
3.  Crazy adventures to many different houses
4.  ALWAYS finding a way to get free beer, oh yea thats right!
5.  The assholes (even though that wasn't so great)
6.  Christina and I almost getting arrested for physically trying to kick some ass!
7.  The Best party in KU by far... YAY for Beer-B-Q's!!!
8.  My 21st and everyone that made it sooooo awesome
9.  *DAVID*!!! (come on every one knows I was going to at least mention him once)
10. Many many more good times that happened and many many more to come!
 
I LOVE YOU GUYS!!

"event","Sooo I should be writing my literature paper but since I have been sitting here for like 3 and a half hours I have decided to take a little break.  I am sick of school and I am sick of studying but I find myself in a really sad mood all of a sudden.  I am thinking about this past school year and how things were so different from my freshman year and how much things have just changed from one semester to the next.  I know I have done a lot of complaining and have said many times how much I hate it here but I do truly value my friends.  If it weren't for Christina this past year I probably wouldn't have made it.  She sees me in a way that no one else sees me.  We have an understanding between each other and even though we sometimes piss each other off, we are always there for each other in the end.  She is such a good friend to me, shes one of the best friends I have and I am grateful for that.  I think I have changed as a person, and she stuck by me through even my worst times.  I stuck by her too, because like I said we have an understanding of each other.  I am not excluding anyone and I am not saying that I don't value all the friendships that I made this past year or my friendships from before, I am just simply saying that she made an impact on me and I am so glad that we're going to be room-mates next year and that I can call her my friend.  

Another person who has made a major difference in me this semester is David.  I know everyone must get sick of reading about him in here, but he makes me so happy.  More happy then I have been in a very very long time.  He also understands me.  He knows my past and now we are starting a future together.  He is the only other one who understands me on that different level.  Even though he lives so far away he has been here as much for me as Christina has.  I am thankful to the both of them...

Alright well now that I am all teary, I must get back to my paper..."

"event","So I had my first final today.  It was good ol' Philosophy.  I think I did alright but we'll see.  This past weekend was the last weekend here in KU.  It was actually pretty fun.  Thursday night we had a nice little power hour.  It was Christina, Aileen, Heather, Calli, Julie, and myself.  It was a good time until we tried to organize to leave and everyone started flipping out.  Hahaha, good thing everything worked out though, right Christina *wink*wink*  Friday night was the lacrosse formal.  It was really good times.  It took us forever to do our hair but once we got that disaster straightened out, we pregamed with some bankers club while running down mainstreet to not miss the bus.  Luckily for us though there wasn't enough room on the 3rd one for everyone so a couple of people were left behind.  So we drank at Double Deckers till the bus got there.  Then we drank massive amounts of beer and liquor in the middle of nowhere, good thing the CRAZY bus driver didn't kill us, and had a lot of fun.  I fell on the dancefloor because it was slippery OOPS, and then after we left we went to Mommas for food and I walked home by myself.  I fell down on mainstreet and I woke up Saturday morning with bruises all over my body and a huge scratch down my leg.  Oh the amount of alcohol I consume in a short time.  Anyway, Saturday night was random.  We drank some beer in Christinas room, then proceeded to the blue house where we drank some more.  Then we went to 321 and I bought Christina and I 40's, Colt 45 double malt is the only way to go :D  We left Aileen passed out on the couch and went to get food, then went back for Aileen finally woke her up and walked back.  So it was a pretty good weekend all in all.  

Now I am just anxiously awaiting this week to be over so I can go home.  David will be here Memorial Day weekend, and I think I am headed back to South Carolina with him for the first week in June.  Then I am definately going to North Carolina the first week in June.  YEA hopefully everything will work out and this summer will be awesome.  Ok wish me luck on the 5 finals I have left boooooo :(

"event","This past weekend was the best weekend I have had in a very very long time!!  David arrived on Thursday at 7:15 in the morning.  We didn't do much because we couldnt go anywhere since the building has stupid rules about not letting people stay over during the week even though I am 21 years old and should be able to have whoever I want whenever I want stay.  Anyway... Friday I didn't go to any of my classes.  Later in the day David and I went to walmart to buy Desperado since I hadn't seen it and he said I had to watch that before I watched Once upon a time in Mexico (which he brought).  So we did that and then we went to Applebees and had dinner.  We stayed in and watched movies all night.  Saturday we were lazy all day, (sorry for ditching you Christina, hope ya understand!!) but we did end up going to Crystal Cave.  It was like we were in school again, it felt like a field trip.  It was so pretty though.  Then we oredered food in and watched movies again.  That was pretty much the basis of my weekend, getting to spend some good ol' QT time with David and watching movies.  He left at like 10 last night.  I am a very very sad girl.  

So thats pretty much it.  Only 10 more classes to go and 5 more shifts of work till Finals week, then I have 6 finals then its FINALLY time to start summer.

Ok must do homework!!"

"event","I can't believe my 21st birthday came and went.  It was one of the best birthdays I have ever had though.  I went to class and to work then waited for Corinna and Andrea to show up. We went to the bar at 4:30 so I could have my first legal round of shots.  Then we headed back to my dorm where Christina suprised me with a birthday brownie cake and she had decorated my room earlier before that with 20 balloons she blew up and a ""Its a boy"", and ""Briday Shower"" balloon.  She also ""layed"" me.  HAHAHA  That girl cracks me up.  The 4 of us preceeded to go to Applebees (Christina was our designated driver) and we ate good food and Corinna, Andrea, and I had a few drinks.  Then I bought my first case of girly drinks (no beer for us that night) and we went to 30 for a little while.  After that Corinna and Andrea left and I went over to Craigs for a drink before we headed to the bar.  Craig and I went to shorty's and Don and Sanley met us there.  We drank there for awhile and then went to the Pub.  Well we ended up ending the night at 2 am.  The bar tender gave me some free drinks since it was my birthday.  It was good times.  Not only did I have fun with all of them but a lot of people called me on my birthday and stuff also.  Here at school Calli, Jimmy, Julie, and John are helping me to get to David this summer!  That was one of the greatest presents I could get.  A bunch of people from NC called me.  Michelle, Jessica, Jeannie, and Seth all called.  I was really touched that Seth called me.  I would have been most upset if he hadn't called since we were together for so long.  Hmmm lets see my aunt bought me a computer!  I couldn't believe it.  She bought it for me for next year.  Its sitting at my house right now, I am just waiting for my dad to bring it to me for the last week or so of school.  So that pretty much sums up my birthday.  It was soooo great and I really appreciate everyone that could celebrate it with me and for everyone that called me and or imed me.  

So the rest of the week dragged on.  Thats because David got here yesterday morning at 7:15.  He came by himself this time.  I am so glad he is here.  I missed him sooooooo much!!!  Yesterday he slept while I was at class and work and then yesterday evening we went to a Pudding slide.  It was quite interesting.  Then we ordered Chinese in and watched movies for the rest of the night.  Sigh... I like him so much.  Hmmm well I dont know what we're going to do the rest of the weekend.  We might go out or we might stay in, it all depends on what he wants to do.  But either way I will get to be with him so no matter what it will be great.  

Well I guess thats pretty much whats been going on with me lately.  Thanks again for everyone making my birthday great!

Ok more David time!"

"event","Awww my last weekend as being underage was a blast!!!  I saw a bunch of people I havent seen in a very long time.  Thursday night we went to Rugby, and I havent hung out with those guys since last year.  I didn't really drink though since I had an exam the next day.  Friday night Christina, Aileen and I had good times drinking, dancing, and playing card games.  Can we say YEA FOR BANKERS CLUB!!!  Too bad Jason was a dick to me when Aileen after we walked our asses all the way from 30, to his house in the cliffs.  Grrrr that was the downfall to this weekend.  Yesterday was probably the funnest party I have been to in Kutztown this year.  Adam had his birthday party and it was a bbq.  We all started drinking real early and partied it up outside in the beautiful weather.  I saw all my 24 nobles boys there from last year.  I hadn't see them in forever either.  The assholes were there which I thought could have been bad, but they all apologized to me again and we called truce.  So now I wont be stressed everytime I go out and they're at the same party as me.  I woke up at 4:45 this morning still wearing my same clothes I went out in.  I hadn't even taken off my flip-flops... hahaha oh well.  Then I talked to David till about 5:45 in the morning and then tried to get some more sleep but was unsuccessful.  Today I ate brunch, cleaned and laid out for a good 2 hours.  I am in love with the weather!!!  I cant believe I will be 21 in 10 hours.  Its crazy to think about.  Its going to be nice to be able to go out and not have to worry about getting an underage.  

Hmmm... so I know I was in a terrible mood my last few entries but I think its because I had a rough week last week.  I had 2 exams, then I had to make my schedule, and work schedule for next year which is damn near impossible. Its so frusterating that I have to work so much.  

Alright well I guess thats all for now, I think I am going take a nap.  I am tired.

Oh by the way today is David and my 3 month.  I cant believe its already been that long.  And I am ever so smitten :D"

I have my schedule for my classes next semester and now I am trying to add work in the mix.  Of course though, both jobs want me to work fucked up hours which require me to wake up for 8 am every day and end at midnight every night.  There is NO WAY IN HELL i am doing that.  Fuck them and there stupid minimum wage.  I don't need it.  When in college the whole thing is that ""school work comes first"".  Yea well thats easy for people to say when someone else is paying their tuition bill.  I on the other hand make a bunch of money and put every penny of it towards tuition, books and who knows what else this stupid school needs.  I am so sick of everything.  I just want to disappear for awhile.  But since it looks like thats not going to happen, I will continue to complain in this stupid thing."

(that was pure sarcasm.)  I got back around 1:30 yesterday afternoon.  Easter break was pretty good.  I mainly stayed home and relaxed which I needed.  I did go prom dress shopping with my sister on Saturday and I talked to Mike (my manager from Eddie Bauer).  He was extremely weird though... looks like I have to start looking for another job.  I knew it would come to that eventually.  

I can't wait for this week to be over.  I have a test Thursday and Friday.  Then I have the weekend to get through before I turn 21... FINALLY!!!  I don't even know if I am going to be doing anything but at least I will be legal, thats something.  In 9 days David will be back.  I can't wait.  I hate being long distance but I know we're going to be alright because someday I will be right back where I belong.  (NOT HERE)

This has been such a long day for me already.  I didn't get to sleep last night until about 1:30 and then I woke up about 6:15 6:30 today.  Then I wanted to come back and take a nap but could I... OF COURSE NOT!!!  I am getting irrated and its worse as the semester progresses.  Those of you who keep up with me on a daily basis know what I am referring to.  At least theres only 4 weeks and a day left of the semester.  

Hmmmm not much else is really going on.  I have a bunch of stuff to look forward to.  This weekend is easter, next weekend is the last weekend before I turn 21, my 21st is on Monday the 19th, the following Thursday David, Josh, and Nelson are supposed to come for the entire weekend, and the weekend after that is our last one in Kutztown.  THEN its finally summer.  It hasn't felt very much like summer though.  Yesterday was a tease, it reached about 60 degrees or so.  Today its rainy, cold, and miserable.  Yuck!!  Well I suppose thats it for now.

At least I got to see David, even though I felt bad that he had to drive all that way for such a short time.  So yesterday we spent the day laying around.  Christina came in with her crazy antics and her and chris hit it off pretty much.  We weren't sure who she was going for, for awhile it seemed as though she wanted Chris and Nelson.  But Chris somehow ""magically"" ended up staying in her room.  Hahaha like we didn't see that coming.  I kicked out my room-mate for awhile, oops!  Hahaha good thing she doesn't mind.  Then today we slept until like 12 and then I made everyone hot pockets and they left.  I was sad.  David says he is going to try and come up the weekend after my birthday though and if he does it will be for like 3 nights so that will be exciting.  I don't know though we will have to see, I am not getting my hopes up.  

Well I guess thats all,  I am sooooooo happy I got to see David, even though it was just for a little while.  I like him more and more as each day goes by.  (I am such a sap!)  

Now I am off to shower and go to sleep, I am exhausted.

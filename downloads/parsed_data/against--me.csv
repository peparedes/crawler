"event","damn it's been awhile...between surfing three times a week and vacations i barely have time to sit on my ass.  What happened to the good ol days when i could play with my toys and no one needed me and i could be by myself....well fuuuuuuuuck that.  It seems like i'm needed every 10 damn minutes just to tie a fucking shoe.  There haven't been many changes in my life so far.  Me and Chancey are still dating and goin well i guess.  I never know how things are goin.  Me and relationships go together like shit.  Just can't keep em'.  Well HELL it's been a long holiday..I hope yall enjoyed yalls as much as i did.  Between having the shits from Banzaii Japenese Steakhouse and pissing every three minutes from beer, i've had a lot of reflection time in the lavatory.  Gifts were good.  New board and new wetsuit so my balls can keep a pulse while submerged in water.  Well..it's about time for another beer.  Alabama is gay except for that.  Drink with your family.  Never happens in Camden.  Peace queers.....and Happy Holidays"

"event","so what is there to talk about?...what is there to talk about?...why am i talking, no one listens...this town has got me goin crazy: the people, the drama, everything i want but can't have.  I'm ready to let go.  This life is slowly pointing to pointless.  In the last month I've fucked, drunk, and smoked more than i have in a year.  I'm not a bad person but damn this stuff has me thinking.  They say high school is the best years of your life, but is this it?...i guess it's just all down from here..............................................somebody save me"

"event","ah maaaan....what a week.  it's hard to believe i can't find a fuckin job in this town...it's surprising because i don't know one person who isn't hard-working in this damn town...everyone is lazy...i love it.  i went to the blue and white game on tuesday...thanks LV..you are awesome and i had a REALLY great time with you.
The surf is been pretty decent this week but the fluidgroove.net boys need to get their asses back from Indonesia so i can get a fuckin decent surf report...look for me on the beach this weekend....i'll be the guy with the retro cooler, a sleeping bag, a couple boards, and no babes...see you there"

"event","it's amazing how a nice crowd surfing can lift your spirits....haha...I got to be with Senses Fail the other night...haha to you Roxanne.  Those guys kick some major ass.  MAJOR ass.  Rufio was there too.  They are really good except for their lyrics...allllllll they sing about is broken hearts and relationships...i thought Backstreet Boys did all of that stuff.




Is there a gesture i could use to clearly express that I'm at a bitter loss for words?"

"event","what it is.....another day of unridable surf went by, AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH....the beach is beginning to be a place i have come to fear the most (dashboard) because of the surf lately....i got a good tan though, but my ass can still light up a dark room....school's out in twenty days and that marks our halfway mark until graduating since the beginning of high school...people say that high school is some of the best years of our lives...if that is true, what else do we have to look foward too...i try to stay positive though because little things make me happy...if i go to a drive thru and i have the exact change, that makes me happy for an hour or two...i'm easy to please

"event","Well my friends, I regret to inform you that the next few days will not be pretty for me.  NO, i am NOT goin on my period.....one of my best friends in the whole world will be taken from this world in the next month.  My ever loyal friend Maggie is extremely ill at the old age of fifteen.  My DOG Maggie has been with me through thick and thin.  I got Maggie May Almond Dobbs when i was born.  She has been with me through every birthday, christmas, halloween, thanksgiving, new years,...you name it, she's been there.  I never realized how much i will miss her until i've seen her lately.  Ladies and gentleman, my best friend does not even have the strength to hold up her own head to look at me.  I just hope she's not suffering......

GOD BLESS MAGGIE AND I THANK THE WONDERFUL LORD FOR BRINGING MAGGIE INTO MY LIFE."

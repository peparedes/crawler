"event","well as all who actually know me know i havent writen for a long time. since i have nothing interesting 2 blaber about ill talk about ow fun this weeks been. on tuesday i brought a bottle of vodka to school and shared it wiTh some friends. some of whom got pretty messed up. on wensday me and this kid derin drank the other half of the bottle. he drank allitle 2 much and bit some girls ass for food. then we all slaped it for fun. we dont even no who it was. that day i skiped all of 4th period  and snuck up to all the lunch periods. i did the same thing on thursday but its just not as fun when your all messed up. and finally teres friday. I did my usual friday trip to the bowling alley were i lost horribly and brought a 2litre 2 drink. but i didnt really go for the bowling this week. i was more thyere for the food. lots and lots and lots of food.i bought 20 breadsticks a large order of fries and a large drink. but instead of eating all the breadsticks i broiught one box back 2 school for me and my friends to pig out on during math like we always do. when i got back to school i went straight to the lunch room and got a frozen goat from the smoothy guy whos been given them to me for free lately.well i drank that and went to my foods class were we cooked pizza. i didnt eat that cuase i was stuffed like a elephant. so i saved it for my math class like everything else. finally when my math class came up i took everything out of my backpack which i usualy never carry around. and started 2 eat with my friends. and here i am now outa things 2 talk about."

"event","my fridays are usualy always the same. i wake up late like always. then i got to school on my bus. were i sit around for 45 min talking to friends waiting to go to first period.  when i finaly goto my classes i usually do the same rutine thing on friday. sleep during first, read/watch sufff about books we are/have read during second. take gay ""stolen"" notes on DNA and why its so important during third. here is were the day gets good starting at 4th.  I go bowling at the lanes for $2 for as many games as we can fit in for an hour. during my 5th period i cook food usualy this week will be a free cook.were i will be cookin with my group frozen pizzas and drinking mountain dew(lots and lots of mountain dew). next for 6th period i sleep again cuase ive given up on algebra 1. next year will be my third year taking it so fuck it. after that i ride the bus home and stay up till the early mornin or really late at night. but this chain has been broken this week. i will not be able to stay up due to a thing called a water gun which i got SOS for. for all you people who dont know what SOS stands for it means...Saturday Opportunity Shool. this is considered a detention at my school cuase they have nothing better to do except make us wake up so we can go to school at 8 in the morning on a saturday. well since my fridays so perfect i would have any homework to do during saturday so im probly gonna serve half of it then go home becuase ill be out of things to do. were i will serve another SOS the next week. this will continue in a continous chain that will never be broken, until next year wear i will have classes that probly will give homework...  :("

"event","what a fucked up day. it all started by wakeing up and doing my usual rutine of being slow as hell. i did my usual sprinting up the hill so i could get to the stop befor the bus. so i finaly rode my bus to school. when i got to school i had a detention were i just sat and listen 2 a bunch of seniors talk about peanut and crack sandwitches. after finaly getting out of my detention i had to run to my locker to put my shit away and grab my binder. as i ran to first period i became late and got another detention. as i waited to take a easy joke of a test which i just guessed on, i started to feel sick from all the runnin. so i finally make it through first and 2nd period were we just watched a fucked up movie..The Odyssey and filled out surveys on how we thought the school year was so far, which i put dont know for all the answers.my 3rd perios teacher made us take 2 quizes 2day becuase shes a bich and never misses a day of teaching us biology.4th period i listen to a girl call herself a bitch and say sum other stuff in spanish over and over again for like an hour straight. after lunch i went to my food class to take an insanely hard test (thank god i had half the study guide or else i would of done really bad).  when i got 2 math mrs. fettehof wouldnt shut up and she made us take note like always.  now that the day was over i have another 2 shitty days to look forward to.well mayb one fridays are never bad days for me. unless in called to the office during 4th period, which would piss the hell out of me cuase my class would b at the bowling alley without me.but that wouldnt happen now unless i brought another water gun to school."

"event","i dont like 2 thing...ive never given much thought about anything i've ever done.  thats why everything i ever do looks like crap and is half assed or bootleged. i guess since im out of thought on that ill start 2 bqbble on about evil thought ive had 2day(most are directed to family). the first 1 was in the car when we were talkin bout jason changeing to my school. it happened when my mom and dad told me 2 shut up be4 i get grounded 4 ""budding in on a coversation that doesnt involve me"".the next was when i asked 2 go 2 a concert,  where my mom started 2 yell at me saying how she has raised me 4 15 years and she doesnt want 2 loose me in a car accident.....meatless meat sounds funny and smells like shit(i mean shit, not as an exspession). it tastes good though if its fryed in a taco.....school suxs and my math teachers gonna b fired cuase she suxs and cant teach worth shit. she actually had the nerve 2 take my mp3 player away finaly...howmany days have i listened 2 it in her class and she newe i was .... probly round 50 or 60. enough  thought its startin 2 hurt my simkple little mind which is loaded up on caffine...."

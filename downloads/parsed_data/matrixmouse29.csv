"event","I wish to be talked about, no matter what the context.  I ask to be famous or infamous, either shall work.  Right now I walk here as an invisible man, not on whose vices run wild, for if that were true, I would certainly be infamous.  I am more of a thin and clear veil stretched across a doorway.  The breath exerted by the faintest whisper of a fairy into a child's tiny ear moves through me with the force of a maelstrom.  As people pass through this door I flutter away, falling back in place in time to brush their back.  They turn to look for what has touched them so gently, but see only the vacant space in which I reside.

Even now with the dancing lights passing by I resemble a thin sheet of paper through which the lights shine, and my stature crumbles in the wind they cause.  When my four friends look back they see past my image, and it is only when they are at the precise angle that a hint and glimmer of a figure can be seen chasing behind.  That figure struggles against their prestige, fighting against the hurricane that blows between them.  I then write upon my thin processed wood pulp being about these journeys, noting very descriptively  about the forces against me.  It is clear that I cannot win the battle of the winds as is, but I also cannot lose.  At this time and place I shall always be a sheet of glass, slowly cracking and chipping but never fully shattering.

The only escape is action, but the only action leads me to the glory or hatred I want, and this is what I fear.  This is what keeps me hidden.  I yearn for some praise, in any type, but these talents will vanish once I have taken a step forward, and I shall truly miss this intentional pain.  In order to follow my passion, I must have a looming pain.  My pain this life is to force neglect upon myself from the people I truly wish to grow closer too.  

Further and further I stray from the group, as they strain their eyes searching for that glimmer of a parcel following close behind, but just barely out of site."

"event","""A night for change"" was all he thought, as the boy ran from the group in great haste.  Their separation was so sudden, so simple, so easy, and all could not end on such a note.  Her beauty turned away, and yet her smile lingered in the air.  One fluid step, as if she moved in slow motion, and she disappeared from view.  My eyelids had slammed shut to censor the pain of her departure.  When they opened again, there was no sight of her.  I looked all around, amazed at her disappearance.  Searching and searching, I gaze again to where she had just stood, and in the distance, illuminated by artificial light, a figure darts away, quickly nearing night's end.  

A perfect evening was quickly ending.  Fainter and fainter the dancing lights grew, slowing in pace as his movements grew swifter.

The friends had already disregarded his absence, and continued on their eternal walk, drinking still the spirits of gas stations.  A maniacal laughter emanated from the distance, but was quickly overpowered by nonsensical rambling and jesting.  Their thoughts became fixated once again on the present, forgetting all that had happened tonight instead of embracing.  The bliss of flavored liquid ignorance.

Clouds rolled into the horizon.  The celestial lights who had watched my every move were now cast away.  Time to conclude your broadcasting day!  Around me still, Main streets darkness grew colder, the only illumination being the street lights.  The lights of main street still danced, but grew lighter by the moment.  This whole night it had felt like rain, and once the celestial eyes had turned away from their entertainment, the drops of water could finally roll off of grace.  I am wet and cold, but still run full force to what may be only chance at happiness.

She grabs the door knob, and the sound of the metal turning reverberates off every building surrounding me.  I clasp my ears, nearly falling from the noise harshness.  So desperate to reach you!  I push forward still, exhausted and knowing full well she had retreated inside into a realm I could not reach.  I had spoken too late and it was her time to awake from tonights ventures.  

But maybe, and only maybe, if I were to reach her quickly, a miracle may occur, allowing the night to remain a constant.  A truly never-ending love.

As I run, water flies into the air from my long strides and hard steps.  A battle erupts between the puddles of water rising against the falling rain.  The rain always wins, and her street is now in sight.  While I have never been here, the sign glows golden, pointing the way.  The night is truly on my side.

I slip however, upon reaching the sign, and fall headlong into the street.  Natures water slide is much harder than plastic, and gives much worse than a brush burn if one is not careful.  I ache, I pant, I dream of all the hell and heaven tonight has produced.  The faceless figures, my flight from home, the ghosts of mansions past, and plays of a life I wish to forget.  The only comfort I can find in myself resides in the thought that her smile alone conquers all that has happened this confounded evening.  I branch from Main street for the second time tonight, this time into areas inhabited.  A limp and a step, limp and step, repeat numerous times, with pain residing in both.  

I continue walking, further and quicker, until the ache is unbearable, and finally slower, passing identical houses the entire way.  The sidewalk continues as far as I can see; but my eyes grow weary and the sight line grows continuously shorter.  Either her home must be close, or may have been past.  

I look further and further, pacing up and down particular stretches, but the fight against exhaustion is always a losing battle.  I soon sit upon the water logged ground, clutching my hurt leg, and looking to the sky for any type of answer.  

When I was trapped in my room once, a young boy grounded for reasons unknown, I wished upon a star through an open window.  In that wish, I requested an escape from all that hurt and all that ached.  I pleaded towards the sky for hours, alone, until finally my body collapsed upon the bed.  As I dreamed that night, my wish was granted, in form of a vision.  I saw my future self, gazing into the eyes of a stranger.  We laughed and hugged, talked and walked, laying in yards and once again wishing upon stars.  Wishing that we should never leave that night, and never grow older.  I remember waking, and feeling confused as to what I dreamt.  The concept of romance was foreign to me, while I had seen such things on TV and movies at that age, I never could imagine such an experience myself.  How did my subconscious produce such thoughts?

And here I sit, underneath the night sky, soaked to the bone, filled with pain, and wishing once again upon the covered stars that I may have that wish I wished so long ago."

"event","In the past two weeks, my dreams have been filled with violence.  Not ridiculous violence where one lives without heads, or acts normally while blood squirts from a leg that was just severed right in front of my eyes.  The violence I see is true to life to the point where I wake wishing to never sleep again.  

The first started two weeks ago when I dreamt of my brother being electrocuted.  He insisted on working upon this open circuit within a fictitious rendering of my grandmother's house.  I knew he had no knowledge of electrical circuits, and insisted he not work upon it, but he chose not to listen.  I walked away, as my mother watched him work, assuring me that he truly knew what he was doing.  The two of them made jokes that if I was afraid I should stand by the main breaker in case something happened.  I went downstairs, for all of this took place in a 2nd floor bedroom, and stood waiting in case anything should happen.  Very soon, I distinctly heard my brother screaming in pain, something that I still hear as I write this, and my mother screaming for me to help.  I ran to the circuit breaker, hearing both screaming bodies my entire way.  Images from the room of my brother burning alive filled the room as I ran.  A very loud scream about his eyes came to my ears as if he were standing right next to me.  I could see his eyes popping, exploding, eyelids melting shut, pupils burning off, all of these horrible images at once.  MY mother still screamed as I reached the switch, and then pitch blackness.  I didn't have to move before I knew that he was dead.  I hadn't reached the switch in time...  

How can one wake from that and wish to sleep again?  I'd close my eyes and immediately see his burning flesh.  Even when I was awake all I could hear was him screaming.  Since the hour was still early, my eyes soon fell closed, and again I was left in a state of slumber, of which I was not disturbed.  And as I awoke the next morning, this dream was all I could think of.  I spent all day replaying it over and over, hoping that it should change.  

My next dream came 3 nights ago, where Kristine and myself lay at a park similar to Delaware park.  As the tranquility was about to take me away on a day dream, I looked to my sides and Kristine was missing.  I turned around and saw her laying in the street, crouched in a state of panic similar to a 50's nuclear bomb drill.  Flying down the street, towards her were police cars in pursuit of a blue-green SUV, I'm almost positive it was an old bronco.  I ran to her side and pushed both of us aside as to not be hit by the oncoming traffic.  As we lay there, the SUV turned onto the grass and parked near where we were sitting earlier.  Then a jump in time, as we lay in the same place, in the same position, only now the police had exited their vehicles, as did the 3 men in the SUV, wearing regular blue jeans and white shirts.  Then the shoot-off began, as the police nearest us, which was literally 3-4 feet away, began firing with the rest of the people.  We lay there waiting for it to end, but we were not fearful.  Bullets rattled off the cars, and finally we got up and began to run along the median that lined the street.  If anyone knows the layout of the street right alongside the rose garden of Delaware park, that is exactly how it was.   We ran along this median, away from the fire, while simultaneously the men entered their SUV, none of them injured, and began driving through the maze of police cars, heading in the same direction as we ran.  While they drove, they continued to shoot at the forces of authority, and I dove for cover, losing track of Kristine.  When most of the police had left, to follow the SUV again, I arose worried about Kristine, and looking all about the street.  Right behind me she lay with a single bullet hole exiting out through her face, it was perfectly round.  

Again I awoke from this dream in a state of panic, wishing once more to elude sleep for the rest of the night.  What made this dream less terrifying was the lack of sound, and the lack of imagery that was present in my first dream, but then last night my own life came under the lucid chopping block.  

It was the first of these violent dreams where someone I cared about didn't die, but someone did die in this dream.  Also it was a continuation of a dream that all I can remember was the end, unless the end was all I dreamt.  This current dream went as such, I was with my assistant manager from work and myself lounging around a room with another person of whom I've never met, nor can describe.  The room was his however, and he had been drinking a lot while we were there.  He pulled a gun from basically thin air, and was waving it around.  This was when my current dream took the same course as my old dream, and I essentially re-dreamt my old dream until a certain point where my new dream kicked back in.  After he had pulled his gun, he became very angered by one of my comments.  I was then thrown upon a bed within the room, it should be noted that the room was comprised of wood paneling on the walls with a door in the downstage right corner if one were looking at this from an audience.  Pat was seated upstage right at a table with a window layed into the wall.  The bed was stage left center.  The man was standing downstage of me, pointing the gun right at my face.  I was terrified, and began to push his arm away from me.  I even resorted to reaching for any items I could grab, to hit him with, once reaching a footstool that had appeared out of non-existence, and I hit his hand with it.  Once all of this had failed, and I soon tired, I made one last attempt to move his arm, as his finger began to pull the trigger.  I had succeeded in moving his arm, however he shoot my leg instead.  It seared.  No other way to describe it.  He then began to replace the gun this time closer to my face.  I could feel the spot between my eyes where the sight had been placed.  I prepared for the worst when someone in an FBI jacket broke through the door and shot my assailant dead.  His corpse fell on top of me. I then flew away from this scene and landed in the next day, which happened to be 2 days before thanksgiving.  I was at school on crutches, my leg bandaged from the wound, and I was talking about the pain it caused.  Then I awoke, the time being 7 30, and myself not wanting to sleep once more.

The worst part of this dream was not the injury as much as it was the fear of impending death.  I cried and pleaded, and tried my hardest to escape death, and soon I was saved, but one cannot always be saved.  What happens when I am not saved?  What happens when I end up like my brother and Kristine?  The recurring theme of trying to save someone and not being able too.  Maybe my dreams are trying to say that I cannot be the sole difference.  I tried to interfere with both of the people in my dreams, feeling I knew what was best, and I lost both of them possibly because I interfered.  Had I trusted John, he might have lived in the dream instead of making a mistake and dying.  Had I realized Kristine moved away on her own, and left her there, she might not have been shot.  And then there was the dream where I stabbed a man, killing him in cold blood, feeling as if I had not other choice, and having no regrets.  That possibly saved my parents lives.  So in four dreams I have been terrified by the death of two people very close to me, but also been terrified by my own acts to save two other people extremely dear to me.  And was saved by an anonymous force, when my own life was at risk.  Psych majors, go nuts!"

"event","More should be explained of this colossus we now faced.  Windows lined each floor in an evenly spaced pattern, the panes of floors two and three missing.  The entrance way was open, with the door lying inside the house, propped up by the knob.  The hinges were missing, as well as any house numbers and knocker.  We would find those brass numbers later, bent and tortured by the forceful shattering of many windows.  Through the gateway, I could see the state of the interior, much worse than the exterior.  Paint peeling and floor boards missing, all are drawn towards the mysteries of destruction.  No escaping the intrigue, urban exploration was our next track.  While most saw merely an abandoned home, all I could see were holograms of faceless memories running from room to room, in what was once a pathway of my own youth  

Step; a scream emanates from within0 the house.  It was not one of terror, but one meant to bring people nearer.  Step; my mind replies to the scream, as I clutch my ear drums and fall to one knee.  The friends pick me up, but I am deaf to their words of kindness and helping.  My mind is set upon answers, veiled to all the rest.  Step now upon the front stoop, my mind paints subtle memories within the hall before us.  I step again, my friends do not, and I am within the house.  The scream comes again, as my mind replies, yet this time I am able to bear the sound.  So much of myself is within this home, and yet I cannot remember how.  I frantically search my mind for any glimmer of remembrance, standing still on the brink of entrance, but again nothing could be found.  I wish to cry, to tear through walls looking for clues, and plead for the friends of my past to return, but the impracticality of it all stops me.  I must be gentle, and suffer through the intrigue, before anything shall be answered.  

As I stepped within first, my foot breaks through the rotten wood.  Maggots and worms lay in piles beneath the floor board.  A breeze against my back nudges me forward, as my foot breaks free.  Not the first, nor the last time tonight my legs should be trapped within solid objects.  Illusionary chimes ring out through the neighborhood, as everything once again stands still on this evening of treachery.  I regain my composure using steady beams for support, now facing straight down another path of infinity.  The infinite contained within the infinite.  Am I beginning at the beginning or has it ended, and I am moving in reverse?  The list of questions has grown larger yet again."

"event","*I needed to write something, whether it was good or bad.  I don't care how this ends up, it is just the result of no revision, and no editing.  I wrote until I stopped and posted what I had.  I feel better now.  If only I could continue on my original story, though.

Alone in a room, plain as youth, I sit and stare at blank white screens.  A haunting melody flows from surrounding speakers, while there I attempt to concentrate by ignoring the sound.  Images of myself and four friends, who shall never be forgotten, walk down a fictional street while my fingers rest upon the home row, awaiting instruction.  The constant night of this street matches the real world on most occasions.  

The images lurk behind me, as I send them perpetually walking down a street, which shall only be  called Main Street.  The backgrounds repeat, like those of an old animated chase scene, but in my head certain buildings, and streets are reached without explanation as to how the loop ceases.  A magical street this is, for you may walk forever and never reach your destination, but always it is leading somewhere.  

Words begin to flow in front of me, as I drift off into the other world, leaving my body as an empty shell for punching poetry.  The four friends are faced to me, but faceless to those who read, for all have these four people in their life.  And all have made, will make, or are making this particular stroll down the common street that leads to the infinite.  

And while I sit here, creating words from passion, I wish not to be typing, nor dreaming.  I wish to be outside, I wish to be walking down the real main street of my home town, gazing at the lights of buildings, and enjoying the night air.  Life is different at night, it is clearer.  We discover ourselves during the night, and make our best and worst choices as well.  We all are no strangers to the night, for we dream in darkness, with stars glowing above our heads.  The late train to NYC glides smoothly along the track.  I wish I were on it.

The music of a dead artist now vibrates my ear drum.  I picture the stab wounds, his heart pierced.  One with true courage, who used it in his music, changing lives with beauty; but also wasting it on the end of his own life.  To my right, a window is open, allowing the music to escape into the night, into my paradise.  An apple tree stands far away, with the forbidden fruit ripening.  I must seek it and eat from the wisdom this tree contains, both on Main Street and in real life.  Once I have seen the truth, and am banished from a world of true paradise, into a world of pain and torture, then I shall be finished.  Then shall I indulge in all that has been suppressed.  Without true ignorance, this character never exists, and these stories disappear.  Without the loss of the four real friends, I have no inspiration for a second meeting.  Without an urge to fulfill all the actions in the upcoming stories, I all but uncommon.  And now for the story that has consumed my final years of higher schooling, including both the non and fictional parts."

"event","I was flipping around today and found Kenmore West Hockey on channel 13, which is apparently the Time warner Cable channel.  I heard what sounded like Rob Ray's voice and paused to see if I was mistaken, which I wasn't.  I kept watching out of nostalgia, and soon enough they cut to the audience.  I saw many familiar faces including Mackenzie Doolittle, with a group of 5 or 6 people shirtless and the letters to ""Go West!"" painted on their chests.  I laughed to myself, and then a bit of commentary caught my attention.  Rob Ray was talking about the aforementioned students, commenting on their physique.  He said, at least to this affect, ""I know those kids are young and I'm an old man, but even I wouldn't feel too bad with my shirt off with them.  I think Ken-West has to work on their phys ed department!""  

Which brings us to Mr. Haynes!"

"event","My chinese lunch this afternoon came with a fortune cookie, which truly boosted my belief in a fateful force guiding us to particular events in life.  After eating, I was sitting in my kitchen staring out the window and commenting to myself what a beautiful day it is.  If you do not live in the buffalo area, the sky is fairly clear, the sun is shining unobstructed and the thermometer in my kitchen read 45 degrees, meaning it feels like 60.  It is quite the drastic change from our below zero wind chills and freak blizzards lately.  I pulled out the fortune cookie, cracked it open, and to my surprise read the fortune ""You find beauty in ordinary things, do not lose this ability.""  I haven't stopped smiling since."

"event","A mad world ran down the streets, weapons firing and swinging wildly through the gray air of a clouded grim day.  Chaos was what I hid from, as true fear took over the town.  It was the fear of life's end that led to this event.  What transpired in places outside of this setting are completely unknown, but surely this vision was spread throughout.  

The streets were clear, and I walked from my house, nervous of a surprise resurgence.  The exact amount of time I had stayed indoors was very unclear, but the air's refreshing taste informed me that it had been a long while since my last excursion outside.  My home was the safe haven, if you will, for people trying to escape.  If you were not with the mob, you were ultimately against the mob.  For now my family were the only ones who resided within, but soon a larger group would seek neutral grounds.  

Moving forward; the comotion had cleared on the street of kenton and I stepped from the doorway to breath fresh air.  I searched the grounds deserted, looking at cars once driven, once loved...  Hands grip my chin, and the top of my skull, and the pressure of a twisting motion takes a toll on my neck.  I cry, pleading for life.  I ask for no harm to fall upon me, knowing that it is to no avail.  The pressure begins to alleviate, and the immediate conclusion is that my assailants dirty deed is accomplished.  I am now laying on the ground, probably lifeless, the cold air chilling my face, as the skin tone becomes paler and paler.   

Yet my eyes burst open, and a dark shadow recedes towards the house.  My back slowly arches lifting my head up to see the attacker.  He now stands upon my roof, black pants, black shoes, black sleeveless shirt.  His yellow complexion ccould not be forgotten, along with the narrow eyes and black spiked hair that defined his nature.  He moved towards a window, his intentions obvious.  ""Don't!"" I immediately react.  He turns to me, with a look of pity across his face.  ""We wish no harm, and will allow anything to have that.  Please follow me in, take what you want, and leave.""  A plea of desparation, out of love for my family.  He showed mercy once, maybe he shall show it again.

A leap and a landing were all it took before we walked to the side door.  In we went, up the 3 steps and into the kitchen, where my parents stood awaiting my return.  The initial sight of the man startled both people, but my explanation to the situation aroused a consensual agreement.  Heirlooms, and electronics, were nothing to us now.  Safety was all we wished for.  The guest stood in the kitchen as I spoke, awaiting an ok from all parties, for his safety was as much at jeopardy as anyone elses.  After the three of us were in agreement, my dad pulled the guest closer, telling him what there was to take in hopes that he would possibly move on without much.  

Now the kitchen was a solid rectangle with the door to the outside in the bottom left corner.  Counters lined both the right and left walls, as well as the rest of the bottom wall, and a table dominated the upper nook.  My mom sat at the table, my dad leaned against the right counter, while I leaned in the bottom right counter, a knife block conveniently hidden behind me.  As the guest moved to talk to my dad he stood between us, his back to me.  And I in desparation, discreetly began to draw a knife.  Twas a butcher's knife, the one seen in so many horror movies.  At first it made no noise as I unsheethed it, but as the last half emerged, the blade slicing against the wood made an undistinguishable sound.  He turned hastily, only to see the blade falling down into his right shoulder.  In haste I aimed for the heart, mistaking which side that major artery was caged within.  His screams broke through every room, and still he stood blood falling down his arm.  I realized my mistake and pulled the knife quickly, the blade coated a mixture of red and silver, the liquiding dripping to the ground.  Another plunge and the knife sinks into the opposite side, his own skin tone immediately paling as the blood retreats from his chest, instead of carrying through his body.  

The weight of the knife becomes unbearable as his limp body, his dead weight are now upon my wrist.  The knife is extracted and the guest falls to the ground.  The blood pools, my hand falls to my side.  No blood has stained my skin, nor my clothing, but the knife still drips upon the floor.  We stare at each other, and agree that it had to be done.  The body is left upon the floor, the door locked.  

I killed him.  No question as to whom, because it was me; and no question as to how for I admit that I stabbed him.  The world does not look down upon me for it, and I see nothing wrong with my actions.  No sirens are blaring in this general direction, nor is any blame being assigned.  A judge has not ultimately assigned me to guilt.  The only prison bars that surround me are the windows of my house. And all the while, this action was not a reaction in self defense completely, but instead a mixture of that, primal instinct, and hatred."

"event","I wish to turn back, and deny all that I have faced this summer's night.  I wish to jog in the street main and face the lights head on.  Lock myself in my room again and ignore the problems as they come at me.  Just sit there and read, or listen to music, or do something that will push through all the pain that surrounds me.  

My friends have been gracious but I have suddenly become frightened.  The change so drastic, so sudden, so impulsive.   Where did it come from?  Why did it take hours for my mind to realize this.  

It's easier to lie, I catch myself repeating.  I would sleep, wake up, fake normality, and none would suspect ay problems.  Too most I was invisible, and such suited me.  Everything is worng now, and it is so much easier to lie.  But I've also gone to far, and to lie at this point would fail.  Even these friends I keep mentioning, they have no importance in my life, for they are merely people who know nothing of me, and allowed me to tag along out of common courtesy.  Still I call them friends though, because it is so much easier to lie, and feign acceptance in a group. 
Where did I go wrong? 

Where is my true passion?  I search every crevice of my wandering mind, and tear through every nook, to no avail.  My eyes comb every block hoping that a physical representation will manifest suddenly and that I shall stumble upon the impossible.  It seems that a passion so true at nights beginning has been lost among the many blocks we traversed.  Those tedious blocks, whose stores fronts are exact mirrors of one another.  Had it not been for the street signs, one could easily think they were constantly walking along one block, stuck in an odd realm.  Trapped in a dream, wandering and wondering about the key to escape.  

Yet wait, the street signs are scarcely visible now, and I have not paid attention to them all night.  What if I am stuck in that realm, meant to persistently walk along main street, under the night's glowing eyes, and waiting for the rain of rejuvenation to begin?  What if we are all stuck on main street?  Except instead of main street, it is our home town, or our home country, or even the world.  Can we break free?  Can we utilize the remains of the box, and burst through the bonds holding us here.

I'm stuck forever.  I escaped one cell to be trapped within another.  Again I am frightened.  I've lost sight of our destination now, and still hope that I shall awaken in a bed and life shall remain as it was.  The hell of ignorance is nothing compared to the path of truth.  How ignorance seems like such bliss now.  My hope fades away, and I silently continue to follow the friends, the spirits that are guiding me to myself.  

All aboard.  The train on main is departing now.  Five passengers are on board, with room for many more.  Our destination is unknown but as long as there is track, there is travel.  The light from the train joins the dancing beams on main street.  The elegant motion of the lights calms me down.  The horn of the train sounds.  It's distinctive noise paints pictures in my mind.  Images of people waiting for a trains arrival.  The reunity of love and the joy of new settings.  How it seems that a plane is used for business or leisure, but it is a train which is most synonomous with journeys based on true emotion.  

A glance of laughter from the passengers surrounding me provides an exit from the dreamscape.  On this mystery train, unmarked, and nonexistant we move swiftly to death or to life.  However, we do not know which we shall meet for it is whichever we stumble across first that we shall remain with.  And I...I sit idly in the back envying the conductors, and those who have made this journey prior.

May we be as lucky as they..."

"event","And we walked further down Main Street, now in silence as the dizzying toxics took over.  Too much spirit had caused my mind to drift to times before this night, as I sit in my room, lights off, music playing, and rage pouring through every wall.  Not my own rage; that of the ones who raised me, and showed false love to each other in the prescence of all but themselves.  Those who lied about our family, and were quick to reassure me that their problems reflected upon me in no way, shape, and form.  

My refuge for a year was all I could think of, and the many pain-staking nights I spent in that cell, pleading for an answer.  Yelling for intervention.  I screamed at life, at god, at the spirits and angels who were supposed to help, but my screams could not be heard above the war that continued all around.

My mind filtered through the past thoughts and soon focused on one particular night.  During a night similar, when the rain had not stalled, and it fell fiercely in a blistering gale, blackness was all anyone could see, except for when the lightning struck.  How I wished that night to be below the lightning's piercing strike.  How I wished that night, like all the rest, to end this feud which continues still today.  As the bolts struck, the darkened room would briefly illuminate, showing still no escape from the problems.  

Brooding I sat, waiting for the hope left in the box to make it's way into my room.  And as morning lightened my sordid spirit, I rose dismissing all.  No answer could be found I bellowed through the empty house, my parents having left their fighting in favor of their daily jobs.  I began my morning preparations for a new day of school and false attitudes of joy to all those who surrounded me.  

As I rejected hope for relief, I soon found that I was as bad as the parents who had caused this dismal situation, and that my falsities were what truly denied me any type of answer, any type of closure.  

I returned to the street, where my legs still moved in unison to the others, and I realized the truth that was now settling down upon my poisoned mind.  while it would still take months to truly answer the questions I had posed during my escape, a seed was planted and tis that which is the most important."

"event","A sound of thunder fills the night sky, and the streetlights burn through their nightly glow.  They retreat into darkness, taking with them the mysteries of the night.  The streak of headlights remains constant, as thunder sounds again.  So soon, a droplet falls.  I rush to its side, and kneel down closer, watching as it withers away upon the hot ground.  Another droplet plunges, leaving the same mark as the first.  I slowly move to where the sound was made, and there exists no mark.  I was too late.  Drop, Drop, Drop, Drop.  Four more have fallen, and a rain of cleansing is about to begin.  It falls upon the tall buildings first, then upon the houses, then the streetlights, then the awnings, and finally upon myself and the ground.  A flash lit this dim night, turning it to days missed, and showing me opportunities past.  The friends of this angst ridden night are none to be found, and the grounds have shifted.  I felt it.  The lightning had illuminated something.  Yes, Mystery still illudes me, but it was a night where that did not matter.  It was a night to be someone other than yourself, a night to drink, smoke, curse, frollick, and do all the things one cannot do in a cell.  And now my journey was over; I had done all that I was restricted of.  

A sound of thunder fills the night sky, and the streetlights burn through their nightly glow.  And still, the constant streak of headlights on main street danced through the air as a glimpse of morning light breaks through the clouds."

"event","On my way to the sink, to wash my hands after eating, I ran into a spider.  She stood at the top of my stairs, six feet high, two feet wide, and seven feet long.  All black, yet not hairy as a tarantula she stood there gazing down the stairs, a black and white swirl lining her abdomin.  With a white spot at the end of seven of the eight legs, she stared in my general direction for what seemed like hours (at least I thought it was my general direction, however she did have eight eyes and could have been looking almost anywhere).  I, ultimately frightened, froze upon seeing this menacing beast blocking my path.  I fell, my knees giving way, and shook violently as the colossus took it's first step downwards.  I could not move, I was petrified, stupified, mezmorized by such a rarity of being, yet ghastly monstrosity of life.  Further it transcended, soon stepping from the steps onto the surrounding wall, crawling closer still towards myself, and climbing as well towards the ceiling.  As the creature neared, and my heart began racing, she had finally reached the ceiling's flats and we homing in still.  There I sat, frozen in what was basically a corner, unable to move as my phobia crawled closer and closer, ultimately bringing my death.  Helpless to defend, helpless to yell, helpless to all.  As she reached the ceiling spot, directly above my now accepted grave, she froze.  As if she was hovering, above me stood the spider, larger than proportion should allow, breaking my spirit through it's movement alone.  To horrified to even close my eyes, all I could do was lie there with an expression of terror plastered to my face.  As we glared at each other, the spider suddenly began to continue across the ceiling, nearing a path towards lands below.  She moved down this wall, closing in on my body cemented to the floor.  

As she shuffled closer to the ground, she shrank to a size normal for the universe as known by myself.  Gradually she grew smaller and smaller and still I could not break free of fears tight grip, for she still crept towards me.  As she reached my foot, I attempted, with all will power invested, to move my leg, to kick her off, to do something.  No response.  She climbed up my leg and hopped onto my arm, laying next to my body, which was srunched into a ball.  She drew herself further up my arm, past the neck, and straights towards my ear.  And there she stopped, whispering ""You fear me by my size and by my look, and I have yet to do anything to harm you.  You show me your disgust by cursing my existence.  You fear irrationally, and you exhibit no sentiments to change, good-day to you!""  And then she bit me behind the ear, not lethal of course.  She crawled through my hair down to the ground, and walked beneath the radiator, into a hole leading along the pipes towards the spring breeze outside.  I stayed upon the ground for hours, occasionally scratching at where she bit, wondering if any mark existed to prove this experience.  And soon I pushed against my home for the past hour and a half, and returned to my standing posture.  I went towards the front door, then out onto my porch, looking upon the ground for any spiders.  Crawling by was an ant, and a bird perched upon the porch rafters flew away from fright, but no spider could be seen.  

I walked back inside with hopes that an explanation would manifest from dormant thoughts or even suppressed psychotic episodes, but no conclusions could be drawn.  And then I lay down in my bed, only to awake in my room, bright with the morning sunlight.  I leaped from my bed, feeling as if insects were crawling on me, and walked towards the window.  Out of it I saw a blue morning sky, with clouds casually floating by.  I walked outside, to retrieve the mail and soon was distressed by an insect crawling across my porch.  There walked a spider, so similar to my dream that I leaped in astonishment.  My foot out of reflex raised in sudden fright and then, since every action has an equal and opposite reaction, my foot began to move down upon the spider.  The walls were closing in upon her quickly, and even faster she scuttled across the wood beneath us, but then, I stopped.  A force came over me, and I retracted my foot away from the spider's body.  She hurried away towards the stairs, leading to grounds natural."

"event","Burst forth bright sound, 
through walls thin, yet tall all around. 
Ram ablaze, go straight and true
Through until no resistance is met.

Open the gates with keys rusted,
Allow these senile dreams to walk forth upon soiled land.
Their lives are short, none longer than yours or mine,
Yet fragile are they greater than porcelain
Babies cradled within the mind.

Out, out, from chains freshly released
Into the sunlight, from the images on the walls.
The puppet master has fled to paradise found.

The red rocket bursts with unnoticed glory,
Lovers walk in lanes dark and stormy.
Angst of man spirals around all.
The dreams, stand hunched, gasping for life."

I needed open spaces and noise to clear my head. The vast eternities that we cannot comprehend, and the celestial lights that seem so small. I needed reckless teenagers parading around me, experiencing joy, drinking out of paper bags, and being themselves. I needed infinity. And, all of this neediness was soon obliged. For while it felt like rain, the sky was clear and the night's eyes shone brighter than ever. Street lights went out to accomodate my sights. Soon enough, kids who were 20 dollars poorer came from a gas station 20 dollars richer, bags and spirits both in hand. No words needed to be exchanged, I knew to follow, and they knew to accept me.

The constant streak of headlights on Main street danced through the air."

"event","I walk through this town looking for that tiny bit of beauty, lost among the ruins of industrial promise and polluted shores.  And every day, I seem not only to find that tiny spec I'm searching for, but an over-abundance of nature's glory, man's compassion, and a view from a ninth floor window, which I gaze at in awe daily.  It is strange, because from that window, I see the silhouetted skyline of nothingness, centralized into 1 tower, reaching towards the heavens and crying for help.  Still I marvel at the sight, with central terminal looming in the distance; ghostly visions flood from it's depths, people with futures, beginning their lives in this new urban america, still sitting in their recliner, looking upon this towns better days.  The hopeless generation remains prevelant on the streets, and in the buses they stand, riding to the unemployment office, then to a bar or a video game store, keeping their minds intoxicated with fantasy.  A unique quality to all forms of life exists here, that scares an outsider, yet draws the citizens together and ensnares them within the city.  And there they stay for all of eternity, until the genes align in an order very distinct, and a child says that comfort is not the answer, rebelling to another city, where he falls into a similar trap, and plays ignorance to it in similar fasion.  How fitting an end to us all, trapped within a money pit city, whose problems grow worse with the passing seconds, and with no future within near sight.  For those plants, converging on the outskirts, attempting to take over, shall never be filled with these citizens.  Beer and comfort, in this desolate land, are luxuries to most.  

And through all this, when the air stands still, and the clouds in the sky are just right, beauty can be seen in every corner of this town.  The leaves swarming in the air, flying in unison down a city street, heading to the west.  The people's generosity, shining through in the darkest ghetto, guiding us as a ship towards fairer destinations.  The light in the darkness, as cliche as it sounds.  If beauty is to form in an urban wasteland like this, then the world cannot be pure evil, just partly.  There must still be some driving force, keeping those very few who actually stop and look for beauty from losing hope.  There must be something keeping us going, and maybe it's an urge to be artistic, or a faint hope that I'm bettering the world, but there has to be something.  

Everyone should stop at least once a day, and look around them, for if they did they would realize that the world is still a gorgeous place, filled with hopes and aspirations.  Dreams floating in the sky, waiting to be plucked like the string of a violin.  If we don't do something soon, the hopeless generation will win out, and our brethren will take us further and further into the duldrums, to a land so disturbing that the morning shall lose it's glory, and the evening hawk will call no more.  To a place where beauteous sights are a rarity, as we stand surrounded by green.  It might be dramatic, for that is what writing is, it is drama, but still these prospects scare me, and melodrama seems a valid course as of now.  Let's do something with our generation, let's create beauty from nothingness, and create serenity from beauty.  Never come out."

"event","Most of our dreams are aspirations leading to a life of fame, fortune, glory, or even cult-followings.  And when we see our inspirations, the people whose lives we wish to lead, we sometimes think of how selfish their careers are.  To be a sports star is one of the most selfish careers one could think of; you give nothing back to the population through the work that you do unless you are charitable or have conquered some kind of illness or severe injury.  Most sports stars known in the public eye are not famous for their abilites, but infamous for their greed, their mental instability, their short-comings.  They live a life of vanity.  

The same can be said for actors, always in the public eye, and always concious of their reputation.  They live their lives only for themselves, pursuing charitable causes for their own personal benefit.  

This is true for many dream careers one can pursue, of which I mean stage acting, screen acting, professional sports, musician, director, certain writers, and artists.  Even doctors and lawyers fall in because many people aspire to take on the challenges of these careers for the benefit of the large paycheck.  And yet, the point of this article.  When given the chance to pursue this career, to live that dream that we criticize as being so utterly selfish, rarely would we say no.  The stage is yours, you are now a lead on broadway, and the lines ""No Thank You!"" aren't written in the script.  And well, I shouldn't really say there is a point to this article, because all I'm saying is it's kinda funny.  I'm not going to say people should turn down their dreams at every moment for that would make me a hypocrit.  If given the chance to be a musician, to be an actor, to be a writer, or any of those careers, at no time would I say no, and neither would you.  And it's normal, it's not horrible, it's not monstrous, or unjustified, it's just plain normal.  

To play ignorant is one of our strong suits as a human, and I'll be damned if I don't abuse that ability when given the chance of a lifetime."

"event","We were jealous, that is all.  We spent 4 years complaining about the state of music, and it all adds up to jealousy.  That simple.  The Simple Plan's and Good Charlotte's, the Mest's and Fall Out Boy's, might have been bad music in our opinion, but why was it that we had to express ourselves so verbally, and so negatively, about these so called ""teeny-bopper bitch bands?""  Jealousy.  They were famous, and we weren't.  They know nothing of music, nothing of chord structure, only how to finger 5 power chords, 3 bass lines, and the sing melodies in tune.  And yet, they are famous.  Fuck!  Why not me was what we were really saying.  Why did these ""bitch ass losers"" become famous, and not me, someone who knows theory, someone whose a virtuoso, a poet, a skilled musician?  That was what we were really saying.  

We couldn't stand the fact that other people were famous, and thusly, we criticized them.  We tore them apart, word by word, note by note.  Anything that band did right, we made people believe it was wrong; and anything they did wrong, we turned into a travesty.  In reality, we did actually hate the music, we didn't like it at all, but the reason we made such a big deal about it was because we wanted to be where they were.  Jealousy.  The reason we change the radio station, everytime something ""bad"" comes on.  It's really that simple.

Had we made it, had our dreams really come true, none of this would matter.  I should really be saying had you made it, actually.  Had you made it, complaining wouldn't seem important.  Rating bands would be trivial.  A band would be a band, would be a band, and for all we cared there could be 50 Mest's.  It wouldn't matter, since we made it."

"event","It's tough, these past few days as well as these upcoming weeks, because everything is changing.  So many people are leaving their homes for a rather long period of time, without the accompaniment of friends or family, and it's a difficult adjustment.  Commuter's to college and dormer's alike are longing to go back to the safety that home and high school provided.  All at once, this gust of unhappiness picks us up and carry's us further and further from our comfort zone.  And the howling of the wind becomes the voices of the past, yearning for our return, pleading for us to give up.  And yet, at the same time there's a voice whispering in the very back of our minds, somehow projecting through this colossal mass.  And just as it seems that the past was so glamorous, and our futures shall never be equal, this lone idea bellows through our body, and urges us to trudge on.  No turning back, no being scared away, and especially no giving up.  As much as we long for the past, and the security it provides, we have to move on and become independent.  Wherever we are, we are for some reason.  Whether it's destiny or free will does not matter because either way there's a purpose, and if there's a purpose for beginning, there must be a purpose for ending as well.  Here's to finding that purpose."

Stop all the Clocks
by W.H. Auden

Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,
Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,
Silence the pianos and with muffled drum 
Bring out the offin, let the mourners come.

Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead
Scribbling on the sky the message He Is Dead,
Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves,
Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.

He was my North, my South, my East and West,
My working week and my Sunday rest,
My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;
I thought that love would last for ever: I was wrong.

The stars are not wanted now: put out every one;
Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun;
Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood,
For nothing now can ever come to any good.  ~ W.H. Auden"

"event","Since many people are posting the obligatory, ""High school is over and I miss it and I had a great time, and I'll always remember it"" posts, I figured I shall do the same. 

So obviously I should start as thus: 

""High school is finally over, the 4 years have ended.""

However, I don't feel like starting it that way, so here we go.

We've been taught so much, these past four years, but what have we actually learned?  I've been playing with this question for a while now.  There is a big difference between knowledge and wisdom, and while I know for a fact that I have gained knowledge, how much wiser am I because of it?  It's a tough question, especially for me, because wisdom comes from experience and for certain moral reasons I have experienced very little compared to those who surrounded me.  However maybe it's fate what just happened while I was writing.  I went to bed last night listening to a mix of songs I call my sleeping mix, and it ran all night playing on shuffle.  Just one minute ago, ""We are the Champions"" began playing.  And yes, for those of you who think Queen is odd sleeping music, Fuck you!  Seriously, don't mock it til you try it.  But anyways, how much wisdom have I gained?  I cannot tell you for sure, not to smoke, I cannot tell you with certainty that drinking will make you drunk and give you a hang over.  I can only provide wisdom from second hand accounts.  And thusly, I am second handedly wise.  

But is this what these past four years have come to?  Me determining that my wisdom not my own?  I guess not, because I still had a good time and I still smile when I think of it.  Many people cried on Friday, and while I thought that I would be among those people, I wasn't.  I felt like Andrew Largeman.  Even if I had sat there and tried to cry about it, I couldn't have.  And now, why?  I should be sad, I had a legacy, I had a name, a persona, and everything and it all collapsed into each other at exactly 2:45 PM Eastern Standard Time, on Friday, June 9th.  Vanished, imploded, exploded, demolished, whatever adjective you wish to choose.  As St. Elmo's Fire says, ""we were the best I think we'll ever be.""  How can I not be upset by this?  

I've thought about this for 2 days, well 1 1/2 if you count friday as a half day.  And it's because of the yearbook.  I wrote a extremely heartfelt good-bye on the yearbook page, except it is hard to read as well as see due to a bad choice of text color.  Here's what it said, for those who haven't read it.  It explains why I cannot be upset.  I hope everyone likes it, it's dedicated to everyone who has changed my life somehow in high by either talking to me only once or by being a friend 4 years through.

A Note from a Co-Editor in Chief

""When you are old and grey and full of sleep,
And nodding by the fire, take down this book,
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep"" ~ William Butler Yeats

I've spent three years inserting memories into these pages of time.  I've spent three years tracking history, creating history, and predicting history.  I've spent three years reading quotes, laughing at tuxedos, and innocently wondering of the time when I would be immortalized in black, white, and color; and here is that time.  I joined the yearbook freshman year because it had a lounge and there were computers to play games on.  When I look back at this example of impulsive thinking, I realize the stress was unbearable; the fun, unmatched; the friends, irreplaceable; and the memories, unforgettable.  I never could have made a better decision on how to spend my free time during these past four years of high school.  (I'm gonna skip this part, it's shout-outs to people who worked on the yearbook with me.  Here's what I really wanted to share with people) 

I believe Mike Laski, Class of 2003, said it best with this legacy quote.  ""Procrastination is key.""  This simple statement embodies everything at Kenmore West, including Kenitorial.  That is why I am writing this statement literally an hour before our final deadline.  Lastly, Laski said ""The purpose of the yearbook is to make a record of the past, and I will look back, quite fondly, at these pages, knowing that I helped create this; I helped make the memories.""  Nothing could be written that is more perfect than that one statement, and for this I end my salutation.  May you all venture into the joys that life has to offer, and never regret the sorrows that might come of it, for those are what the heart is made of.  It is a mix tape containing every genre of music, good and bad.  It is the greatest compilation of all, and is played for the rest of eternity. 

""When you are old and grey and full of sleep,
And nodding by the fire, take down this book,
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look

Good-bye friends that I've known so long, I know we shall see each other again but not like we did these past four years.  That is why I must say, good-bye, it was fun, we did a lot, and we have the memories to prove it.  For all my junior friends, have a great senior year.  It goes fast, don't let it pass you by.  I'll see you guys and girls around as well.  Soon to be Graduates, have fun wherever you are going, and don't forget those times where you walked the halls of Kenmore West proud to say that you were a senior.  As Mr. George Feeny once said: 

Mr. George Feeny: I love you all,
[pauses]
Mr. George Feeny: class dismissed."

"event","Where the Sidewalk Ends
by Shel Silverstein

There is a place where the sidewalk ends
And before the street begins, 
And there the grass grows soft and white, 
And there the sun burns crimson bright,
And there the moon-bird rests from his flight
To cool in the peppermint wind.

Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black
And the dart street winds and bends.
Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow
We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow, 
And watch where the chalk-white arrows go
To the place where the sidewalk ends.

Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,
For the children, they mark, and the children, they know
The place where the sidewalk ends."

"event","Thunderstorm.  Perpetual flashes bounce off the foggy windows, as the angering gods swell above.  Crash, someone was struck by their wrath, and all are suffering for that one person's mistake.  You cower into a corner as the waterfall continues to pour, with no signs of slowing nor stopping.  Another explosion erupts from the sky, and the dark night becomes day for a split second.  You get to higher grounds, the water rises.  The room is flooding and there you stand on top of your desk, with a broom for protection.  A broom, to brush all the water out of the room.  A broom to use as a paddle when you find a boat.  A broom that is as useless as your cowering.  Crash, the ceiling caves in, the room is completely flooded, your left in the middle of a lake, just you and a broom.  Houses can be seen underneath the liquid crystal and people are adrift like yourself, stuck in an ever rising tidal wave.  You swim towards buildings taller, yet they are enveloped just like the rest.  The wave grows, people are constantly joining the hopeless, continuing forward, decimating more towns, bigger towns, taller towns, until nothing is left except the water, the people, and their broomsticks.  The world is gone, the tidal wave still grows, and grows, and shows no sign of slowing.  Above you is a sky, flashing with rage, black, cold, vengeful.  Around you are people, no boats.  Behind you is a massive wave, that is now coming crashing down on all who are left.  Water surges down onto you, so forceful, so powerful.  You go under, down deeper and deeper because of the force, through the hole in your roof, down the stairs, back into your kitchen, where this all began.  You regain consciousness, move towards the sink, turn the faucet, and the wave stops.  The water drains, the people float back to their homes.  Life is saved.  Will you ever leave your faucet running again while it's not attended?  I didn't think so!

"event","I have 2 things to write about tongiht that I am completely and totally ecstatic about.  Both involve art in some way so bare with me if you are not that kinda person.  1.) The piano solo I have been composing for about 2 years is actually developing, ever since I borrowed a portion of a piano solo by Burt McKraken of The Used.  When is he ever gonna play it?  I was just playing it two minutes ago, and I have found the absolute perfect closing chord to ride out on fading until the end.  Tis quite beautiful if I say so myself.  And now for the more exciting of the two things.  2.) I've decided that for the rest of the school year, once a week I am bringing in my video camera, and making a movie/documentary of the closing months of high school.  I'm really excited about this because it gives me a chance to make a real movie instead of just filming random crap and keeping it on my computer for nostalgia purposes.  Next week is going to be the first week that I bring my camera in, I'm not sure of the date, but I might also bring in a tripod and film parts of the choir dance if I plan it right.  This will go on until the last week of school, where I will have it every day, especially the last day of school where it shall be running every period that I am not taking an exam.  Choir seems like it will have the biggest part in my plan because the bond between everyone is so much greater than in any other class I'm in, and thus if you wish to not be filmed (nor interview, more on that later) I'll respect that.  I'm really excited about trying this.  idk, maybe I'm just weird.  Whatever, comments would be appreciated, no matter what the opinion."

"event","Once upon a time there was a group of people, all of different origins and cliques, who shared a moment that went down into the history of Kenmore West High School.  Our tale begins on March 24th, at 10:55 PM.  The lights were off within the gymnasium, and the ballad blared with a force insurmountable.  Couples grouped together, and cheek to cheek they swayed in an elegant form, very mocking of formal dance; however, in the center of the ballroom a couple came together unlike any before.  For this couple consisted of 30 people, all different, yet all sharing one common bond, if not more.  Everyone who formed this colossal group was a part of the senior class, the valiant class whose reputation, being smeared by individuals with lower ambition, was at this moment redeemed.    

At this moment in time and space, the universe did not revolve around the sun; it revolved around this rare colossus of the earth, for they were the source of all the happiness in the world.  Nobody could touch them, not man, nor beast, nor god; and nobody would, for darkness in its purest form looked upon this group with tears of happiness.  For a moment, no sadness could be felt within the cosmos, not a cell died in all the earth, nor was anyone harmed.  A supernatural force surrounded all, not just those within the ballroom.  It extended outside of Kenmore West, outside of Buffalo, outside of New York, and even outside of the U.S, outside of reality.  Huck Finn was not waiting for the light to shine, Pip returned to Joe and lived happily again, King Hamlet returned from the grave and tragedy became an illusion.  But all fairy tales must end, and as the last words passed through the speaker, scarcely audible, the forces disheveled by this phenomenon were released, and the ways of the universe returned to normal.  Sorrow and rage again prevailed in this world of ours, and the couples surrounding disbanded with precision equal to their character.  Fate, in all it's glory, began to pull at our heroes with little avail, for there they fought and stood strong against their division.  The puppeteer pulled them away with all his force, but soon the strings broke and forward they moved, hands raised in triumph.  And there, surrounded by cold brick and the spirits of past success, they chanted the noble name they were proud to bear, ""Senior.""  The End."

Now that the musical is over, and I'm reminiscing about how the fuck I got here, I decided to post this quote because it is partially the reason why I'm here.  In every way shape and form did this apply to the musical for me, and I have never been happier because I took the risk.  Everyone was absolutely amazing.   I will never forget the many good times and stories that come of it, as well as everyone involved because you all were so amazing.  Honestly for the first time I felt like I was part of something, I felt like I belonged and that nothing could hurt this high that I was feeling.  I know that there are still 3 months of school left, but I'm going to miss spending all this time with everyone.  You were all wonderful, never forget that.

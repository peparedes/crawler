"event","NAIL IN THE FENCE 

Make sure you read all the way down to the last sentence. 

(Most importantly the last sentence) 

There once was a little boy who had a bad 

Temper. His Father gave him a bag of nails 

And told him that every time he lost his 

Temper, he must hammer a nail into the back 

Of the fence. The first day the boy had 

Driven 37 nails into the fence. Over the next 

Few weeks, as he learned to control his 

Anger, the number of nails hammered daily 

Gradually dwindled down. He discovered 

It was easier to hold his temper than to 

Drive those nails into the fence. 

Finally the day came when the boy didn't 

Lose his temper at all. He told his father 

About it and the father suggested that the 

Boy now pull out one nail for each day that 

He was able to hold his temper. 

The days passed and the young boy was finally 

Able to tell his father that all the nails 

Were gone. The father took his son by the 

Hand and led him to the fence He said, ""You 
Have done well, my son, but look at the 

Holes in the fence. The fence will never be 

The same. When you say things in anger, 

They leave a scar just like this one. You 

Can put a knife in a man and draw it out. 

It won't matter how many times you say I'm 

Sorry, the wound is still there. "" A verbal 

Wound is as bad as a physical one. 

Friends are very rare jewels, indeed. They 

Make you smile and encourage you to succeed. 

They lend an ear, they share words of praise 

And they always want to open their hearts to us."" 

It's National Friendship Week. Show your 

Friends how much you care. Send this to 

Everyone you consider a FRIEND, even if 

It means sending it back to the person who 

Sent it to you. If it comes back to you, 

Then you'll know you have a circle of friends. 

YOU ARE MY FRIEND AND I AM HONORED! 

Now send this to every friend you have!! 
And to your family. 

Please forgive me if I have ever left a hole. 


I found that on someone's page and thought it was nice,so I thought I would share it..."

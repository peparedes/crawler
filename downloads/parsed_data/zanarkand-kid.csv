Of course, right when she gets back, they take Taichi... doesn't seem very fair, that I seem to keep losing people just to get others back. It's probably just coincidence, but it's still a big pain.

At least I got away from those orders before she got back."

<b>Name</b>: May
<b>Livejournal Username</b>: <lj user=""synard"">
<b>E-mail</b>: oxmaychanxo@hotmail.com
<b>AIM/MSN</b>: skeeeeeith
<b>Current Characters at Luceti:</b> Meryl Stryfe, Lute, Haseo, Badou Nails, Shinpachi Nagakura, Alphonse Elric

<b><u>Character</b></u>

<b>Name</b>: Tidus
<b>Fandom</b>: Final Fantasy X
<b>Gender</b>: Male
<b>Age</b>: 17
<b>Time Period</b>: The base of Mt. Gagazet, after the Ronso's acceptance of Yuna and Co.
<b>Wing Color</b>: Light Aqua
<b>History</b>:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidus
<b>Personality</b>:  
Tidus is notably cheerful and optimistic. He likes to look to the bright side or believe in the better outcome, if not for his own reassurance, for the reassurance of others. Yuna, especially, he tries to keep an optimism around, going as far as hiding things he knows she should know, but would hurt her, such as hiding the truth about Sin from her. He makes a point to put effort into cheering up the others, though sometimes his methods are a bit strange.

He's an energetic and playful type, though it's calmed over the course of the pilgrimage. In the beginning, we see him hop about the ship traveling to their first tournament in the game, stealing binoculars from one of the passengers, generally enjoying himself until the binoculars were stolen back.

Despite these large aspects of his personality, he is outspoken, opinionated and sometimes quick to anger. He's the first to speak his mind and question things he doesn't agree with. Respect is not something he generally carries, especially for elders, stemming from his relationship with his mother and father. He has no qualms against insulting people of status, religions, or anything he feels is wrong. 

This trait stems from his self-confidence. Where one would think his father's treatment of him, disappearance, and his mother's death would be means to quash his spirit, they merely fueled it. Tidus has, besides the bravery of a hero, a personal bravery and rebelliousness against authority that comes with his childhood and age. He has his own ideas of morality and truth. Where the new world around him discriminates against difference, he stands out as someone who reads people before he judges them. Tidus judges on actions and intent, lacking the prejudice imprinted in many of the characters we meet.

Also, Tidus is picky about who he does and does not confide in. Although he generally is a happy sort, he has inner conflict as much as the others. He's a little less jaded than the other guardians in the beginning, but the increasing pressures and tragedies of the pilgrimage, along with constant new revelations, weigh down on him. Auron, being his most familiar in the group, tends to be the one he turns to. Otherwise, the majority of the time, Tidus will hide what's bothering him until bursting.

<small><b>Strengths:</b></small>  
<u>Physical:</u> Tidus is very athletic. He's strong and agile from being a professional Blitzball player, which takes a lot of physical training. <small>(The boy can breach water like a whale. That's some skill.)</small> He can hold his breath for an incredibly long amount of time and is an excellent swimmer, also stemming from the sport. He's also skilled with a sword and has no trouble in battle, so much so that he tends to enjoy himself while fighting monsters. Tidus also has a number of spells specified for a Time Mage.

<u>Mental:</u> His main mental strength is the ability to hold onto optimism, even in the bleakest setting. Spira is a world that is falling to pieces, yet Tidus can still hold onto hope that things will work out. He doesn't often doubt himself and believes that solutions can be found without losing those close to him. And, though they take a while to develop, around this time in the game, he begins to exhibit many leadership skills, which Rikku comments on at a later time.

<u>Emotional:</u> Despite everything that's happened and is happening to himself and those around him, Tidus can still smile with a genuine happiness. Though the road ahead seems to end in nothing but tragedy at this point, he manages to keep his spirits up, and that is his emotional strength, as others draw from it. He is strong enough of a person to maintain his emotions and still help the others along with their own.

<small><b>Weaknesses</b></small>: 

<u>Physical:</u> Tidus, though a bit familiar with a sword, is not specifically accustomed to one. He's a Blitzball player, not a soldier, and it takes him a bit to adjust to fighting at all. At first, he can't even lift his sword nor use proper strategy. Though he's progressed, Tidus can only fight in close range battles. He has no skills for long range and would be near-useless in a completely long range battle. His only magic skills are time magic.

<u>Mental:</u> Tidus is not the brains of the operation. He's not stupid, but not always the brightest bulb about things. He is mentally his age, as well, which, at times, adds to the immaturity of his thinking. The harsh realities of life in Spira don't come to him easily and there are reoccurring occasions where he does not understand how things there work.

<u>Emotional:</u> Though a happy individual, on the outside, there's  anger and hurt that peeks out of him, more than just what would classify as teen angst. His past with his father and his mother's death are two things he cannot seem to move on from. He has a tendency to work himself up when his father is discussed, sometimes lashing out. He has piling conflicts stacking up inside his head, and there's times when it overwhelms him. 

<b><u>Samples</b></u> (ALL samples must be set in Luceti-verse.)

<b>First Person</b>:  
<small>Ah... my head...</small>

Ugh, what happened? Where the hell did the mountain go? This doesn't even look like the Calm Lands, either! I don't remember backtracking...

Wait, where is everyone? And where are my clothes? Auugh, did the Ronso trick us and sell us out? After all of <i>that</i>? I mean, they can't hate us <i>that</i> much, can they? But, the place outside doesn't look familiar at all.

... Whatever. I need to find the others. We have to get back to that mountain. <small>We were so close.. and why am I so sore?</small> 

<b>Third Person</b>:  
He wasn't expecting to be asleep at all. He could slowly feel the world open up and he found himself staring at a sky edged with tree tops. There was a careful breeze and it was chilly but not the kind of chill he expected. The blond was expecting frigid cold, ice, and snow. He was expecting the sound of others breathing, a tent, something.

But, with a further strain of drowsy attention, he found that it was just himself, the sky and the trees.

It took seconds for things to click in fully. There was pain, there was a sense of being alone, and everything felt dreamy and unrealistic.

This was not where he'd last been. The mountain was gone. The Ronso were gone. The Guardians were gone.

Yuna was gone.

His fingers curled and he let all the pieces of the puzzle lay down together until it set off all the mechanisms. He threw himself upright and swayed a bit, cringing. Something foreign was stuck to his back, and the more he tried to shake it off, the more it aches. Why did he keep ending up in these situations, anyway?

He shook away his questions, hopping up onto his feet. He didn't care where he was or why. He didn't care about his clothes or his back or where his sword had gone (which he was sure Wakka would properly clobber him for it later). What he cared about was the others, was Yuna. She was the biggest blasphemer of all in the eyes of the followers and she was more in need of her guardians now than ever.

It was just a matter of locating everyone. He'd done it once, in the desert, and he could do it again.

He did the first thing that came to mind. Pressing two fingers between his lips, he took a deep breath and let out a long, loud whistle.

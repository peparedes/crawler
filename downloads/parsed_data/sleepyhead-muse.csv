"event","<p>i forgot my log-in details after going by 2009 with only&nbsp;2 journal&nbsp;entries. twitter has been my regular venting tool despite the restricted characters enabled for each tweet. it felt oddly comforting not to spill out my emo&nbsp;and stressful rants&nbsp;- but then every now and then, sometimes, i do get that urge to write, write, write (just that i didn't have time or my procrastinating self opted to sleep instead).<br /><br />while 2009 has been a year of challenges, it was a very fulfilling year - i was jumping for joy and deliriously happy at the stroke of midnight last dec 31 my mind screaming, &quot;i did it!&quot;. i survived my foray into independence! while for some it's very&nbsp;easy to just hop on a plane and work abroad, to me it was something i really felt like&nbsp;i HAD to do,&nbsp;but recognizably&nbsp;difficult for&nbsp;someone who is very&nbsp;dependent, emotional and submissive.<br /><br />and sure enough,&nbsp;it was crazy reality&nbsp;-&nbsp;and very&nbsp;different from the comfortable cocoon i was&nbsp;used to being&nbsp;in.&nbsp;<br /><br />i've had my moments of lunacy and WTFs moments&nbsp;like&nbsp;leaving the office at 2am in the morning, sleepy, disoriented&nbsp;and tired but still able&nbsp;to walk home to my apartment (thank god for the low crime rate) , getting blasted through emails consistently (even being told that i need email&nbsp;/ formatting lessons...yes, that degrading) or nearly missing my plane because i was doing overtime work (as always).&nbsp;but it was during those occasions when you realize just how blessed you are for being entrusted with&nbsp;these ordeals so that this experience would be as enriching as i hoped it would be. <br /><br />moreover, He blessed me with a wonderful support group here and in manila, who were there for me whenever i wanted to give&nbsp;up completely. i feel awfully humbled by His wisdom, giving and surrounding me with&nbsp;these amazing&nbsp;people to love and share my life with as i go through this chosen path. each one of them patched up my bruised self-esteem and literally helped me get through each day. <br /><br />my definition of love expanded to real, recognizable lessons on compromise, thoughtfulness, sacrifice,&nbsp;and optimism. it was very overwhelming, and i am still learning and embracing the lessons i get each day :)<br /><br /><br />i feel very, very blessed for this experience, very grateful,&nbsp;inlove with His infinite wisdom.<br />may He grant you your heart's deepest desires, and light up your life, as&nbsp;He did with mine.<br /><br />happy 2010 everyone! 11 more months and we will all be another year wiser and happier :)</p><br />"

"event","i haven't written anything here in a year. i have been lurking every 2 weeks to check on anything new and there were countless attempts to write something down but i never got around to putting down more than two sentences. so this is actually quite a feat. (3 sentences so far...keep going). <br /><br />considering the changes that happened over the year (which are quite a lot i must say), i can only surmise that&nbsp; my reason for not updating as often as i want to would be because i... <br />1) am still acclimatizing (should actually be a reason for me to update no?) <br />2) am&nbsp;too lazy to update <br />3) am too busy <br />4) have nothing to say <br /><br />...in which case #4 would be a lie if anyone&nbsp;saw my twitter page. *toink* <br /><br />okay so this coming-back-to-blogging post is obviously not making as much sense as i want it too. maybe i am just trying to make my comeback a little less stressful than the last few entries i posted (okay i browsed through my archives and ohmyeffingass lah..it was really filled with kinda&nbsp;embarassing emotional notes. looks like my early 2008 was full of high strung drama. bleh.) my only excuse for that is...i am but human (hahahahahah).&nbsp; i guess&nbsp;emotions are such powerful, creative influencers. <br /><br />nevertheless, i am quite happy to note that&nbsp;so far things&nbsp;are looking&nbsp;pretty rosy.&nbsp;though my work-life is far from perfect, i am quite thankful&nbsp;for so many things that have been instrumental in bringing a smile to my face every now and then... <br /><br />1) a closer bond with my rents and my family (and i am getting a new pamangkin this year yahoo!) <br />2) my angels <br />3) ashby <br />4) pinoy sg mafia's quirks and drunken stupor (0 record for me this year so far hah!) <br />5) bobhoover :) <br /><br />the year of the ox is bringing me good tidings. maybe it's the singapore air, im not really sure. though i cave in to loneliness and homesickness at times, the rational part of me still says that i am quite fortunate to be where i am now. thank you god for cheap calls to the philippines and singtel kababayan which have been instrumental in helping me keep my sanity. <br /><br />ooppps i remembered that i still owe&nbsp;<lj user=""the_chemist"">&nbsp; an entry (i answered one of her entries which means i am considered tag -- well, i asked for it naman haha). will try to do that after i work on another slide of my report. <br /><br />:)&nbsp;"

"event","i usually don't understand why people get stressed when the christmas season arrives. a haggard-looking mom out christmas shopping with kids in tow would probably give me an earful and altho i emphathize, i find christmas shopping to be fun even if it means jostling a bunch of shoppers in malls and elbowing my way to the prized gift items.&nbsp;i don't even mind 'burning' hard-earned money hehe, masaya kasi talaga mag shop for other people :D&nbsp; 

this year was different, like christmas suprised me na lang bigla. i feel unprepared and very un-christmassy. not really a grouch but i can't feel anything. 

maka shop nga para ma-feel ko ulit yung christmas adrenalin rush hehe."

"event","<p dir=""ltr"" style=""MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"">yet. nothing yet. hehehe. i'll enjoy this blissful moment at work which will probably translate to boredom in the next....hmmm...30 mins or so? hehehe.<br /><br />it's my third day here at <strong><em>rival T </em></strong>and so far i think i'm doing pretty good. i've been on three presentations (egad!)&nbsp;for the categegories&nbsp;(uh-huh! categories!! and not just brands!!!) that i'll be handling. it's all good, i mean, i'd take food categories any day over telecoms (aka @*&amp;#^@)_!!!), herbal products and financial services any day! hahahaha. i love my categories, i'll be handling chocolates and noodles mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm i can't wait for december when my clients give gift packs hahahaha. shet.<br /><br />i've been taking advantage of my gym membership too the last couple of weeks. for the month of february, nasulit ko na yung monthly na binabayad ko hahahaha yay!!! my resolution and sheer fervor&nbsp;to lose the weight i've gained last year coincided with my skin allergy attacks (with causes still unknown). i've been to the allergologist last week and they've done blood tests to screen out any food i might be allergic to (in addition to pork). the doctor has given me a prescription and a 7 day diet to follow that will allow me to only eat food that will <em>possibly </em>not cause any allergic reaction and they are the following:<br /><br />&gt; rice, freshly baked bread<br />&gt; peaches, pears, apples, banana, atis,melon, chico, grapes<br />&gt; beef, lamb<br />&gt; tilapia, bangus, dalagang bukid,<br />&gt; fresh veggies only<br />&gt; sugar, salt, pepper, white vinegar, honey (2 tbsp a day max only)<br />&gt; water, buko juice, melon juice<br />&gt; vegetable oil, olive oil, margarine, without coloring<br /><br />so...everything that you don't see here, i can't eat / drink. that includes&nbsp;chicken, catsup, soy sauce, bbq sauce, mayonnaise, cheese, ham, tocino, milk, corned beef, seafood (shrimp, oysters, crabs, clams, tuna, etc),&nbsp;eggs and any product made with eggs, wheat bread, cakes, citrus fruits including oranges, mangoes,strawberries,etc. .......and the list goes on. it even prohibits me to wear / use/ apply make up and&nbsp;lotion. <br /><br />i thought it was a piece of cake and since i was trying to lose weight anyway, i'd be better of following this na lang. so far.... i failed on my third day hehehe. ang hirap naman kasi eh!&nbsp;<br /><br />the true test of the&nbsp;level of difficulty emerged&nbsp;when im eating out. case in point:&nbsp;&nbsp;i&nbsp;had dinner at&nbsp;next door / north park&nbsp;and&nbsp;after&nbsp;carefully&nbsp;making note of what i can't eat,&nbsp;ordered congee with sliced beef. i was feeling pretty pleased with myself until i saw that it also comes with clams and egg. so&nbsp;i asked the waitress to remove the egg and clams, explaining that im allergic to them. i felt bothered kasi feeling ko nalugi na ako kasi technically lugaw na lang yun with beef&nbsp;so i decided to order something else. i scanned the noodles list and excitedly ordered the beef noodles / mami. until i realized that i can't eat the noodles pala and that the soup (sabaw)&nbsp;is loaded with MSG. i opted to go back to the congee with a heavy heart. when my order came, it was disguised so well (you know the usual congee presentations, crunchy things on top with spring onions and leeks) that i felt my spirits rising when i looked at it. i was so hungry until i tasted it...walang lasa&nbsp; eww hehehe!!!&nbsp;<br /><br />siyempre, sa mga nakakakilala sa akin, you know&nbsp;i put soy sauce or&nbsp;seasoning&nbsp;on my&nbsp;food whenever i can and that's exactly what i was thinking at that time while i reached for the soy sauce. kaya lang bawal din pala ang soy sauce so...i asked the same waitress to get me salt instead. i swear, i must've looked really pitiful while salting my congee.&nbsp;<br /><br />consuelo: masarap naman siya. kaya lang siguro dapat nag goodah na lang ako para mas mura.<br /><br />i have difficulty rin trying to stay up because the medicines&nbsp;i have to take are like sleeping pills which i have to take during bedtime because they really make you sleepy. that's why it's so difficult to get out of bed every morning and i can't drink coffee rin kasi bawal. so puro water lang. oh well. at least sabi ng boss ko pumayat ako since the last time she saw me which was my interview last jan. uuy! :D<br /><br />it's been an uneventful week. i'm happy though :D the challenges are blessings in disguise. tara, samahan niyo naman ako kumain sometimes! (once i find out officially what's causing my allergies then we can perhaps celebrate with buffet :D!)<br /><br />advance TGIF you guys! :D<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>"

"event","after weeks of overtime (yep...hindi lang days...weeks!!!!) trying to familiarize myself with the new responsibilities that came my way, i reached a definite conclusion:

GUSTO KO NA MAGPAKA-HOUSEWIFE!

my teammate and i were walking back to the office after a team lunch out and we were talking about how much we wanted to just take care of kids the rest of our lives coz we were so tired of what we were doing (she's been with the company for 5 months pa lang and yet she feels this way already!). initially, being a housewife wasnt something id want for myself a few years back...i was happy with what im doing. the endless thirst for knowledge in the field im in was always there, it was fun to be updated with products i eat, i use while bathing, i take to relieve myself of any physical ailment. i felt like i had the upperhand and an insider scoop on how a certain product or an ad came to be and i could rationalize why certain products appealed to different age groups. in short, i felt like i knew A LOT and that was something i was afraid of losing.

but now i feel like putting a sign in my cube that says INFORMATION OVERLOAD! things to do just keep coming in, clients would call for answers im still trying to understand myself and keeping them happy is taking its toll on what i used to see as a reason for staying. plus, we dont get OT pay huhu. dammit. 

late last year, 3 of my officemates have turned in their resignation, two of them stating ""workload overload"" as their primary reason for leaving (the other one had ""irreconcilable differences"" with her immediate boss as a reason...hanep parang showbiz couple but that's a different story hehe) but nevertheless i guess the feeling of having too much work is not an isolated case here. so now that i've tasted how corporate life is, i think i can honestly say that this isn't something i would subject myself to for the most part of my life. i wouldnt even want to subject my future family to this, i don't think i can stomach the fact that i have to go home to a sleeping family who tried to wait up for me. that's just sad. 

o sige back to work na...im on ot again today. sh*t! if only walang bills to pay."

Never mind that I'm sick for three days now, nothing can stop me from going out and seeing the sights (*ubo*ubo*shopping*ubo*). partner in crime <lj user=""greenarcher96"" />&nbsp; has been so kind to me, driving me wherever i want to go and showing me around. i've been here for a week already and i feel like i dont want to go home anymore huhuhu. (that's what i get for checking office mail while i'm on vacation. darn it). i hate reading mails that say i've deadlines on jan. 10...my god that's like my first day back in the office and i've deadlines already. obviously i need to work my lazy ass off as soon as i step back to reality and the thought of it makes me want to extend my stay here even more hehehe. ang tamad ko. </P>
<P>------------------------ </P>
<P><STRONG>dec. 21</STRONG> - departed bloomington, illinois for baltimore (supposedly at 6am but because of heavy fog we were delayed by 4 hours waaaah!) so i missed all my connecting flights for baltimore in atlanta and if that wasn't worse enough, when i finally landed in baltimore my suitcase was nowhere to be seen. my balat ata ako hehe. it was nice seeing my niece and nephews though, i forgot i was supposed to be pissed off. </P>
<P><STRONG>dec. 22</STRONG> - woke up early to go to new york and new jersey to visit my uncle and meet up with cousins. (oh yeah, naiwan ako ng bus sa terminal so i had to take another bus going to new york (may balat talaga ako hehehe) i was actually dreading the bus ride but it wasnt so bad, i felt so independent going there on my own (i've to check my wallet every now and then though in fear of being mugged..that's what i see on tv eh hahaha) just kidding but my uncle was really nice enough to show me around and let me experience how commuting in new york was like. new jersey andaming filipino and we even had our meals in filipino restos and bakeries hehehe. my uncle made my trip worth it by giving me cool gifts the next day before i left for baltimore, a digicam and an ipod nano :D </P>
<P><STRONG>dec. 24</STRONG> - stayed at the home and helped ate sally prepare the santa gifts for the kids. uploaded mp3s sa nano and let kuya use it first hehe. </P>
<P><STRONG>dec. 25</STRONG> - ate sally, kuya raymund and katrina gave me a great christmas gift....a les miserables ticket! the show was for that day and after my initial tour with ate sally, katrina and i went to the national theatre in washington dc to watch it. the actor who portrayed jean valjean was soo good i think im inlove with him already despite the fact that he's about sean connery's age hehehe. after the show, katrina and i milled outside the theatre acting like regular turistas by taking each other's pictures beside the poster (huhu last showing na daw ito ng les mis..buti nakanood pako before they ceased production of the show completely) and trying to wait for the cast members to come out to uh..get their autograph and make pa-picture (di naman ako taga rito eh bakit ba hehe) :D </P>
<P><STRONG>dec. 26</STRONG> - went to kuya marco's (ate sally and katrina's brother) house in baltimore for their annual christmas party. i barely knew most of the people there but they were all so nice and welcoming i felt like a part of their side officially hehehe. they even have gifts for me! wow sarap hehehe. kuya marco has this neat studio and we basically jammed the whole afternoon. had karaoke contest too, and wow the food! i took a picture of the fondue before we attacked so my pics will have to follow hehehe. </P>
<P><STRONG>dec. 27</STRONG> - katrina suggested&nbsp;movie marathon so off we went to muvicom, this cineplex in arundel where they have 12 theatres. movies here cost a lot, $7!! but katrina taught me how to get my money's worth. i wont mention the details here but the bottomline is we were able to watch 3 movies for the price of one. and oh, ganda ng narnia!!! </P>
<P><STRONG>dec. 28</STRONG> - got karma from watching 3 movies that i was burning up with fever and my allergies attacked that morning. cathy hovered over me asking me to get well so we can push through with our planned trip to the baltimore national aquarium. after lunch i was well enough to leave, heavily layered with clothes hehehe. we watched the dolphin show which lasted 16 freakin mins only. okay lang buti na lang cute sila. </P>
<P><STRONG>dec. 29</STRONG> - road trip to rehoboth beach in delaware to shop at outlet malls na walang tax. not even thundershowers can prevent us from enjoying our trip. pure heaven pag walang tax! ayan nawalan na tuloy ako ng money hehehe. </P>
<P><STRONG>dec. 30</STRONG> - home sick. hahahahaha. okay lang, we'll be going around parin later coz i wanna buy rollerblades! katrina will take me to a store where she bought hers on sale, originally costs more than $100 but she was able to get it for $7 only!!! </P>
<P>bottomline, ang tigas ng ulo ko :D even with me coughing and blowing my nose every now and then coupled with pill popping at odd hours, im having a blast here! ayoko na umuwi hahahaha. the thought of going back to work makes me want to crawl under the blankets and sleep nanaman under the influence of benadryl anti-histamine. i've been taking that for my allergies and it did wonders for my sleeping habits (pampaantok din kasi hehe). i never got around to telling you guys that despite my 2 wk stay here, ive been unable to get used to the sleeping hours. i'd&nbsp;wake up early in the morning around 2am and then going back to sleep. nakakdiretso lang ako ng sleep when i take my allergy medication hehehe.&nbsp;di ko na nga pipilitin sarili ko by adjusting eh, malapit nanaman ako umuwi. </P>

<P>ive been wanting to update my journal soon as i got here but there is just so many things to see around here (i can almost hear <lj user=""sleek_operator"" />&nbsp; laughing at&nbsp;what i just wrote).&nbsp; soon as i got here, they've been&nbsp;hounding him on his sightseeing plans for me and when&nbsp;he mentioned&nbsp;touring this city as a given, they all said ""that'll only take an hour. what else have you got planned?"". hehe well...the town sure is a sleepy one. but i really like it,&nbsp;compared to&nbsp;chicago, i prefer the suburbs to the bustling city life (check on me after a few days and lets see if this thought changed hahaha).&nbsp;but&nbsp;yeah, contrary to what he thinks (and what most of his friends think as well)&nbsp;i think&nbsp;bloomington is just perfect. sure, the nightlife here could use some help (the bar closes at 1am) and the only shop open&nbsp;for 24 hours (aside from the gasoline station) is&nbsp;krispy kreme&nbsp;but still, its very nice. people here are very friendly, and its nice to walk around seeing little children and infants bundled up in thick coats with just their eyes showing (think mini-michellin man). i've met most of&nbsp; <lj user=""sleek_operator"" />'s friends&nbsp;and they're very nice.&nbsp;btw,&nbsp;ive taken note of the&nbsp;single men&nbsp;here and for anyone of you interested&nbsp;daming good catch haha :D pictures to follow. id have to take a picture of them without my guardian watching hehehe. </P>
<P>&nbsp;i was holed up this morning with a hangover. my gosh the people here sure make up for the lack of gimmick places by downing drinks that would put kanto boys to shame. gimmick place happened to be the apartment of a friend who just left this morning and as an initiation, they made me drink a shot of tequila. its not pretty bad but it's been awhile since i last drank and my stomach's not used to drinking anymore so my tummy acted up. so as not to make them persuade me to drink another shot, i compromised by drinking margarita the entire night instead. sarap their margarita! i should've taken a hint that i was drunk already&nbsp;when&nbsp;i went out with my guardian to get the foil for the hookah from his apartment and i didnt feel the need to&nbsp;put my jacket on. and it was -2 degrees&nbsp;last&nbsp;night. egad.</P>
<P>so here i am with a splitting headache, thank god for angels,&nbsp; <lj user=""sleek_operator"" />&nbsp;made me lunch, baked chicken and vegetables yummmy :) i could get used to this hehehe sans the headache&nbsp;of course.</P>"

<P>1) simbang gabi - nothing like the feeling of waking up to attend dawn mass...while also&nbsp;trying not to doze off during the homily. i keep myself awake by counting the number of people dozing off and how many of them kilala ko&nbsp;hehehe.&nbsp;then again,&nbsp;my sister can attest to the fact that i dont attend simbang gabi as religiously as she does but still, i'll miss the feeling of attending at least..uh...3 of 'em. i usually go on the first and second day and on my birthday. if i have enough reason and willpower (read: my dad&nbsp;bribes me with&nbsp;puto bumbong or bibingka or when i was a freakin' teenager kasi&nbsp;andun kasi&nbsp;crush ko) then i go on another day hehehe. walang ganyan sa states!</P>
<P>2) <EM>""meri krismas po!""</EM> - coupled with <EM>""bumalik na lang kayo sa pasko!""</EM> wow what a scrooge. where's the christmas spirit in that? oh wait...that's me&nbsp;nga pala&nbsp;shouting&nbsp;from our house to the kids who&nbsp;rattle on our gates after halfheartedly singing ""sa may bahay"" as early as the last week of november. hehehe...oops.</P>
<P>3) villagemates - those i dont usually see (this will include my neighbor whom i haven't seen in hmm...10 months? not bad for someone who live a house away from me). childhood friends&nbsp;usually reappear on christmas eve during the christmas eve mass. awww. ill miss the reunion this year. regalo ko ha. pakibigay na lang kay mia (teehee)</P>
<P>4) neighbor na may sinturon ni hudas - enough said. god forbid they make enough noise for all the houses in our street combined.</P>
<P>oops gotta go to practice na (wow i never fail to amaze myself..what...dedication!) hahahaha&nbsp; &lt;-------&nbsp;sucker.</P>
<P>to be continued :D</P>

"event","<P>its sunday and im still here in the office...its 6:30pm.</P>
<P>such a loser.</P>
<P>its called ""throwing-yourself-at-work-to-escape-harsh-realities""... which may have been caused by parent drama, currently happening at home. hmm. home is not ""sweet home"" as of the moment. </P>
<P><EM>buti na lang andito si manong guard..nakakatakot pala mag-stay dito ng sunday pag gabi. at least may kasama ako...maya nako uwi.</EM></P>
<P>------------------------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>i went to mass awhile ago. left the office at 2:30pm hoping to get a good seat inside the well-ventilated greenbelt church for the 3pm mass (honest, malamig sa loob if you guys wanna check it out). but alas, every mallrat seemed to have the same thing in mind. i had to resort to standing inside one of the bridges connecting the greenbelt island church dome to the park and by the time homily started, i was sweating like crazy and my legs were being peppered by mosquitos. glancing inside the church i saw a lady get out of the confessional box and no one else followed suit. hmm..ive been wanting to go to confession for quite sometime <EM>kasi matagal na ko di nakaka communion</EM> so i ambled over to the confessional box. i wasn't really planning on going inside but when i was there na, what the heck i went in na lang <EM>(baka malamig sa loob eh)</EM>&nbsp;while the choir started playing the offertory song. </P>
<P>the a/c felt sooo good because it was sweltering hot outside. i welcomed the full blast of chilly air and sank gratefully to my knees and prepared my rehearsed speech and mental list of ""sins"" (you know the usual stuff and generic childlike sins that you do not have any plans of elaborating to the priest). needless to say, i got more than what i bargained for. would not go into the itty-bitty details of what i said (you guys wish hehehe) but i found myself saying and confessing&nbsp;a lot and having philosophical discussions with the priest who was kind and patient enough to answer every query and debate challenge i threw at him. when i went out of that confessional box, i was in tears but i was happy, i felt drained but light-hearted. i listened to the last strains of the communion song that the choir was singing (yep, i was in that booth for quite some time) and for the first time that day i smiled.</P>
<P>few things i've learned:<BR>-god does not put you in a bad situation. you do.<BR>-everyone has a second chance. all you have to do is ask for it...through prayer.<BR>-a sin, no matter how small it is is still a sin.<BR>-everyone has freewill which gives them an argument to say that they can live their life the way they want to...""pikit ka muna god ha"" and its true. just don't go running back to god when things get messed up because he has no hand in that. you did. again, freewill, remember?</P>
<P>i could go on and on but those are the few thigns that i was mulling about while heading back to the office. <EM>ang hirap naman mamuhay ng masaya pero tama</EM>... being <EM>""tao lang""</EM> is not an excuse.</P>
<P>well after today, this workaholic will certainly try. </P>"

"event","<P>yahoo i have work again! (wait a minute, let me clarify that)..</P>
<P>i have a new project! after weeks of unproductivity, i'm finally working on something again. im sure you my friends,&nbsp;have noticed my recent <EM>kasipagan </EM>when it comes to updating my journal (teehee). not that i mind though, but then again there is that itty-bitty thing called ""revenue"" that i'm slightly worried about. we're due for our evaluation this coming june and i have nothing to show my superiors except my perfect attendance <EM>(kunwari i didn't go to boracay)</EM>&nbsp;and typing skills (which i honed through ym and livejournal hehehe). if only surfing the net was included in the evaluation then maybe i could get an ""Above Target"" score this June. </P>
<P>-----------------------------------------</P>
<P>update on my recent interview:</P>
<P>after waiting for 2 hours (not kidding on this one) i was finally interviewed by the hr manager. i think my hesitation to go through with this interviewed showed because i found myself forcing answers to some topics i'd normally breeze through. good thing the hr manager still found me fit for the position she wanted me in. i had a hard time trying to keep a straight face when she told me she was endorsing me to a department&nbsp; (that i am sooo familiar with) because she thinks i'm highly qualified for the job. <EM>yun nga lang, </EM>that position would allow me to be the clients of the company / agency im working for now.</P>
<P><EM>ayos.</EM></P>
<P>i'l be working with the people i'm thinking of leaving. <EM>at least..ako client nila :)</EM></P>
<P>yihee.</P>
<P>so for now, i'm still waiting for my next and final interview. hay, bahala na. i'm letting the lord decide&nbsp;where to take me on this one :)</P>

Your birth on the 19th day of the month adds a tone of independence and extra energy to your life path. 

But at the same time, it poses a number of obstacles to overcome before you are able to be as independent as you would like. The number 1 energy suggests more executive ability and leadership qualities than your path may have indicated. 



A birthday on the 19th of any month gives greater will power and self-confidence, and very often a rather original approach. However, a somewhat self-centered approach to life that may be in conflict with some of the other influences in your life. 

This 1 energy may diminish your ability and desire to handle details, preferring instead to paint with a broad brush. 



You are sensitive, but your feeling stay somewhat repressed. 

You have a compelling manner that can be dominating in many situations. 

You do not tend to follow convention or take advice very well. 



Consequently, you tend to learn through experience; sometimes hard experiences. 

The 19/1 is a loner number and you may experience feelings of being alone even if you are married. 

You may take on a tendency to be nervous and angry.</td>

<P><EM>this is all i...wanna feel tonight</EM></P>
<P><EM>i feel so aliiiiiiiiive!</EM></P>
<P><EM>tonight and the rest of my liiiife</EM></P>
<P><EM>- Nina Gordon ""Tonight And The Rest Of My Life""</EM></P>
<P>-------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>woke up with a heady feeling, arms feeling like lead, head throbbing, eyes swelling. i thought ""this is worse than a drunken hangover"". of course it didn't help that i slept at 2am and then woke up at 630am to go to work. hehehe. welcome to the after-effects of a hookah session :)</P>
<P>of course i've only myself to blame. i was the one who insisted on rebelling that night. my friends <lj user=""the_chemist"" />&nbsp; and <lj user=""m_a_y_f_i_e_l_d"" />&nbsp; originally planned on having dinner only at rufus (where i watched encantadia for the first time hehehe) and when we passed by ziggurat on our way to kalayaan, i felt a ""hookah-force"" so forceful (?!?!) that&nbsp;i knew i had to try it.&nbsp;--&gt; <EM>side note: how redundant can i get?? haha. </EM></P>
<P>ok back to the story (obviously the grape/apple-flavored hookah still had smoke remnants embedded in my brain). so we passed by ziggurat on our way to rufus and i cajoled them into having a hookah session after having dinner. and so we did...(to <lj user=""the_chemist"" />&nbsp;and <lj user=""m_a_y_f_i_e_l_d"" />&nbsp; , <EM>di naman super obvious na i really wanted to go through with&nbsp;it nung tanong ako ng tanong if u guys want to nung nasa rufus pa tayo diba? hehehe).&nbsp; </EM>so there we were in ziggurat..<EM>naka-indian sit&nbsp;</EM>sa carpet (mayfield had to sit with her legs neatly tucked underneath her,&nbsp;side by side&nbsp;because she was wearing a skirt =D ...ooohlala!) and after ordering&nbsp;drinks and deciding on grape-flavored tobacco, the chemist&nbsp;demonstrated the proper way of using the shishah / hookah. it was so much fun! i initially choked on most of the grape-flavored smoke i attempted to blow through my mouth but eventually learned how to blow the smoke ""smoothly"" out of my mouth. seems like i have the talent for it hehehe.</P>
<P>it felt exhilarating. there was this one point wherein i felt so giddy by my failed attempts to look like a smoker that i couldn't stop laughing and crying at the same time. my companions were looking at me as if i had lost my mind and i couldn't care less coz i was having&nbsp;so much fun laughing at my pathetic efforts not to choke&nbsp;(and feeling lightheaded already at the same time&nbsp;=D). i'd probably get their own reaction about my behavior last night after posting this hehehe.</P>
<P><lj user=""sleek_operator"" /></SPAN class=ljuser style=""WHITE-SPACE: nowrap"">do not worry,&nbsp;rest assured that the smoke i inhaled last night is not the <EM>nakaka-high </EM>type --- </SPAN><SPAN class=ljuser style=""WHITE-SPACE: nowrap"">despite the fact that it may seem like it is based on the randomness of this post ;)</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ljuser style=""WHITE-SPACE: nowrap"">going back, obviously, we got hooked on the shishah&nbsp;(no pun intended hehe). we ordered another round </SPAN><SPAN class=ljuser style=""WHITE-SPACE: nowrap"">of hookah, this time, apple flavor <EM>naman.</EM> we took turns taking pictures of one another inhaling </SPAN><SPAN class=ljuser style=""WHITE-SPACE: nowrap"">through the pipe and we were laughing crazily amongst ourselves by our failed attempts to capture </SPAN><SPAN class=ljuser style=""WHITE-SPACE: nowrap"">the smoke blowing from our mouths in most of the pictures. oh well..<EM>di naman aalis ang ziggurat </EM></SPAN><SPAN class=ljuser style=""WHITE-SPACE: nowrap""><EM>eh, try ulit natin next time hahahaha =D</EM></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ljuser style=""WHITE-SPACE: nowrap"">we left ziggurat at around 1am. (so much for my promise to my dad to go home by 1230 hehehe). </SPAN><SPAN class=ljuser style=""WHITE-SPACE: nowrap"">with mayfield <SPAN class=ljuser style=""WHITE-SPACE: nowrap"">driving, (with her driving putting&nbsp;cab drivers to shame) i was home in no time. </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=ljuser style=""WHITE-SPACE: nowrap""><SPAN class=ljuser style=""WHITE-SPACE: nowrap"">gave my dad a huge grin when he opened the door with a scowl on his face and said <EM>""sino </EM></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=ljuser style=""WHITE-SPACE: nowrap""><SPAN class=ljuser style=""WHITE-SPACE: nowrap""><EM>naghatid sayo at bakit ang ingay ng kotse niya parang pang-karera?! bakit lalaki?""</EM> i could </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=ljuser style=""WHITE-SPACE: nowrap""><SPAN class=ljuser style=""WHITE-SPACE: nowrap"">only laugh </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=ljuser style=""WHITE-SPACE: nowrap""><SPAN class=ljuser style=""WHITE-SPACE: nowrap"">at him and explain how ""my driver"" can hardly be considered a drag-racer...much less,</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=ljuser style=""WHITE-SPACE: nowrap""><SPAN class=ljuser style=""WHITE-SPACE: nowrap"">a guy hehehe.</SPAN></SPAN></P>

<P>while the voice of our trainor drones on, here i am updating my journal.&nbsp;good thing she's blabbering away&nbsp;somewhere in asia so she can't really see how delinquent her participants&nbsp;are (think&nbsp;web / teleconference in a more advanced scheme).&nbsp;i love technology...it makes people rely on its ""high-techness""&nbsp;so&nbsp;much that they forget that itty-bitty&nbsp;thing such as having the need to see what you participants in the other side of the continent are up to (nothing a&nbsp;lowly webcam couldn't fix). </P>
<P>---------------------------------------</P>
<P>i treated my dad to breakfast this morning when he drove me to ortigas (and it was worth every greasy fry that i hurriedly chomped down while explaining to my dad my investment plans). he liked my idea of buying a condo unit in makati&nbsp;and renting it out eventually.&nbsp;i was suprised how open he was to the idea and&nbsp;he's going with me to see the unit again on saturday with the broker!&nbsp;yahoo! even if nothing is final yet, the mere fact that i was&nbsp;able to talk to him about&nbsp;it without him having to scoff&nbsp;at the idea from the beginning was a huge breakthrough.&nbsp;we were able to see eye to eye on things and that&nbsp;was enough for me. (*tear*) hehehe,&nbsp;kidding aside,&nbsp;another great thing about this is that i actually have ""prospective&nbsp;tennants"" asking about it already. hopefully everything goes well =D</P>
<P>---------------------------------------</P>
<P>oops must answer my accreditation exam now (yep..this is a certification program hehehe..i am so bad).&nbsp;i love how my&nbsp;bosses are encouraging us to&nbsp;""share our knowledge"" on this one =P&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

i can still remember my last post, which was way back in january (hehehe). forgive my absence, i've only my work to blame. ahh the joys of management conferences, it gives us lowly execs the chance to kick back and relax (aka watch dvds in the conference room, play the sims all day, hang out in greenbelt during work hours, extend..erm..over extend lunch breaks and nap all day in our desks) while the higher beings pretend to participate in their conference in shanghai, at the same time, secretly comparing bargain prices and shopping places in china (market research is dominated by women).

but we're not that bad. really.

i'll enjoy this reprieve while it lasts. oh, and did i mention that im on leave tomorrow?

hehehe..such a good mood =D"

"event","so..i've been to what, 3 despedidas within the last 2 months? first my manager joyce moves to singapore, secondly tita meding, the former field supervisor leaves to try her hand in the family business, then ning, our retail director resigns to become a full-fledged housewife...just as she's been promising her husband for 4 years now.

i guess its inevitable that these things happen, i mean last year's re-org brought about by the resignation of our two..uh.. #@*#*$!%$!! heads almost threw us off track..nearly causing us to forego our projects because we were all dazed by what happened..and what was about to happen. The higher ups frantically changes the organizational structure and gave us neverending pep talks to boost our morale. It did little to help us, we were all walking around like zombies as colleagues handed in their resignation. fortunately for me and my team, we were one of the blessed ones who were able to retain their groups when the re-org was announced. i couldn't have thanked god profusely for this.

i used to question the feelings of these people who (and are about to) resign. i would wonder what gave them that push to just make up their minds and leave...of course reasons are something that u cant really argue with. i could never really understand these thoughts until i started having them this week. i dont know if my mom's fervent prayer for me to live her lifelong dream is suddenly working but i'm seriously considering about leaving and pursuing other er..fields. and its scares me..because i just started thinking about them and as weird as it may sounds, suddenly its as if something is really pushing me into that direction. an opening comes up, with qualifications that uncannily resembles my background, so on and so forth. it reminded me of that line in paulo coelho's ""the alchemist"" that goes soemthing like, ""when you want something, the whole universe conspires for you to get it"". hehehe hope got that right.

all in all, as my officemates and i schedule yet another despedida for another colleague who is leaving next month, i cant help but wonder when mine will ever be. hehehe anyway its just a thought ;p im leaving everything to god so he can give me a nudge in the right direction."

During what women believe to be the start of a budding romance, certainty about where the relationship is going is never questioned. To us, ""it's in the bag"" without necessarily saying this out loud. ""He calls, he tells me he misses me, asks me out often, is relentlessly sweet and thoughtful. I am always on cloud nine and apologetically unable to wipe the grin off my face. I am in love with him and although he hasn't said so yet, I am sure he loves me too."" 
Herein lies the tragedy. 

Until a man asks you to be his girlfriend, you are not on safe ground. No matter how few the minutes are between his text messages or his phone calls, even if he has tried to hold your hand, carefully pick off the eyelash from under your eye, and wipe the crumb perched on your upper lip, assume that he just wants to be friends. Assume otherwise and you'll be in for great big heartbreak. 

Men are almost formulaic - especially those who have remained single after 25. When faced with the same given in the same situation, no matter where they come from, they will all do the same thing. Enter the questions women love to ask: 1. Why hasn't he called me in the past few days; 2. If he likes being with so much, why doesn't he leave his girlfriend/wife for me? As much as we would like to fall back into thinking men are idiots and need a little shove off into the right direction, it's better to keep your hands where they are. Do not text, call or make a bigger fool of yourself. There's just one answer to all the questions: He doesn't love you enough. 

Let's take each situation one at a time. He hasn't called you in the past few days. Women will immediately assume that there's something wrong. His cellphone is off, he is sick, he got into an accident, he's upset with me, etc. We say to ourselves, ""It's okay for me to text him, at least he'll think that I care about him and that I'm thoughtful. Plus once lang naman to eh. After this I'll never initiate texting. 

More brazen women could come right out at the guy and ask, ""Why haven't you called me?"" Whenever my women friends tell me they did this, I visibly cringe and have to stop myself from hitting them on the head. You see, a man's initial feelings for a woman are not usually carved in stone. 

How he feels about you is very much like writing on the sand. You have to be careful so that he won't change his mind about you. My guy friends who confide in me (voluntarily) have the same facial statement when they tell me about the girl who asked them the question, ""Why haven't you called me?"" They look like they have the heebie-jeebies. They freak out and start complaining about this. They haven't called you because they don't feel like it. They might feel like it later but at the moment they don't so they won't. They are aware that you exist and don't need you to remind them about it. Do you want that? I don't think so. They also tell me that men are entitled to change their mind the way women do. They are also flaky and ""not sure"" all the time. 

Sometimes men are looking for icing on the cake in the form of a woman friend who plugs in all the gaps that his better half cannot fill. She is usually somebody with slightly different qualities than his mate. He enjoys being with her, calls her all the time, consults with her about life-altering decisions but does not really come out and make a decision about who he wants to be with simply because he is in a ""safe place."" He has the best of both worlds and doesn't need to make a choice. If he hasn't left his girlfriend for you yet, chances are, he won't. 

Telltale signs: She is still his priority. When she calls and asks him to pick her up, he hurriedly finishes his meal and tells you he has to go. When you ask him out on days when he has to take her home, he'll say he can't. You notice that you are only together when his schedule permits it and when seeing you does not conflict with his time with his girlfriend. You get the crumbs. This kind of arrangement only tells you that he doesn't love you enough for him to forsake his girlfriend for you. If he takes a chance by leaving her for you, you're sure that he loves you. Most men would stay with the safe, the tried and tested over risking everything. 

Obviously, you don't want to be second best. Find someone who will make you his only priority. Although they pretend and seem otherwise, men are not idiots when it comes to matters of the heart. They know fully well what they want out of the relationship. They do not need to be rescued by you. They don't need hints, carefully crafted text messages or highway billboards that promise them a bed of roses with you. If he really likes you, he will do anything to get you to like him back. You just have to sit there and wait for your nails to dry. Trust me. I can get enough signatures from the creeps to validate this.

okay so my first post isn't exactly short hehehe.. =P

i dont exactly know how to react to this article. i guess its safe to say that i do agree with one thing...do not assume anything. the living premise on this one basically connotes or reinforces a girl's mantra which she desperately wants to follow...but just can't seem to because of that darn, persistent guy (who seem to just have that uncanny ability of getting under our skin by striking where we are most vulnerable). okay, so it doesn't help at all that he just has to be really, really cute... (hehehe)

it helps to have friends who pinches you once in awhile to bring you back to reality. (thanks guys) although at the end of the day.. it's really all up to you to decide on what to do. afterwards, it's a great comfort to bitch about these experiences over ice monster concoctions with your angels (hehehe =P)"

I plan on trying to be more active with the updating soon. If you want to be added as a friend, just let me know.</p><p>Things about me that are (possibly) interesting:</p><p><b>Occupation:</b> grad student studying environmental health, fiance to a wonderful dude in the Navy, mentor for undergraduate student athletes, and research assistant trying to discover how to make potatoes more colorful.<br /><br /><b>Interests:</b> science, cats, reading books, building gundam models, video games, cooking, tea and healthy living.<br /><br /><b>People of interest: </b>if I ever get around to updating my lj, people who might feature:</p><p><u>Vivian:</u> my awesome roommate. She&#39;s Chinese, and living with her is more like having a wife/little sister than just a roommate.<br /><u>Geoff:</u> the lovely guy I will be marrying soon. We are in an LDR, but plan on closing the distance in 2013.<br /><u>Mok and Jaz:</u> My fluff-babies. I&#39;ve had them for 4 years already.

 BeLLaDoNNa<<your time has come>>  says:

 BeLLaDoNNa<<your time has come>>  says:

!MoEy! says:
ohh well why dont you explain to him why you think you didnt do anything wrong then find out why he is mad at you..
 BeLLaDoNNa<<your time has come>>  says:
i would but....
 BeLLaDoNNa<<your time has come>>  says:

 BeLLaDoNNa<<your time has come>>  says:

 BeLLaDoNNa<<your time has come>>  says:
and neither will tom
!MoEy! says:
then have someone else say it
!MoEy! says:
 
 BeLLaDoNNa<<your time has come>>  says:
and mitch isnt gonna be at school tomorrow
 BeLLaDoNNa<<your time has come>>  says:

 BeLLaDoNNa<<your time has come>>  says:

!MoEy! says:

 BeLLaDoNNa<<your time has come>>  says:

!MoEy! says:
he will care when schools done
 BeLLaDoNNa<<your time has come>>  says:
to late then though
!MoEy! says:
well if you dont have a messenger then time is the only thing that is gonna solve it
 BeLLaDoNNa<<your time has come>>  says:
huh?
!MoEy! says:
just wait until things run a lil bit more smoothly..give him time to think about why you arent gonna do anything cuz maybe he expects you to do sumttin
 BeLLaDoNNa<<your time has come>>  says:
hhm.
 BeLLaDoNNa<<your time has come>>  says:
i dunno
 BeLLaDoNNa<<your time has come>>  says:
i never did anything before
!MoEy! says:
you DONT wanna talk to him while he is mad or else things will get worse
 BeLLaDoNNa<<your time has come>>  says:
i almost have the feeling he wants me to do sumthing
!MoEy! says:
there you go
 BeLLaDoNNa<<your time has come>>  says:
almost!
!MoEy! says:
just let him go for a while..you have been bossing him around a bit. im sorry but..telling him to go to chior isnt your choice its his choice to do stuff. and he will learn from not being there at times.
 BeLLaDoNNa<<your time has come>>  says:
i told him to go to choir?
!MoEy! says:
i dunno
!MoEy! says:
i think thats what you said but thats not the point
!MoEy! says:
dont let mitch get to you.
 BeLLaDoNNa<<your time has come>>  says:
i cant hellppp it!
!MoEy! says:
its his own problem to deal with
!MoEy! says:
if you did nuttin then dont beg him saying that you didnt do anything..
 BeLLaDoNNa<<your time has come>>  says:
huh?
!MoEy! says:
he would hafto relaize if you didnt anything or if you did..
 BeLLaDoNNa<<your time has come>>  says:
well ok heres what happened
!MoEy! says:
let mitch solve this..not you
!MoEy! says:
k
 BeLLaDoNNa<<your time has come>>  says:
breanna told me about some guy  she kissed a while ago, but she didnt want mitch or tom to know because tom gets jealous at that kind of stuff. they saw her telling me, and then they were buggin us cuz they wanted to know the secret. neither of us would tell them, so they got mad. thomas said ""mitch is mad becuz you dont trust him and you keep secrets from him and he would never do that to you''
 BeLLaDoNNa<<your time has come>>  says:
and now tom is mad at breanna too, because she was sticking up for me, and wouldnt tell him the secret and tom thinks breanna doesnt trust him either
!MoEy! says:
TOM AND MITCH ARE GUILTY!
 BeLLaDoNNa<<your time has come>>  says:
they dont understand the idea of trust
!MoEy! says:
well then tell them
 BeLLaDoNNa<<your time has come>>  says:
me and bre arent really that good of friends
 BeLLaDoNNa<<your time has come>>  says:
we just trust each other alot
 BeLLaDoNNa<<your time has come>>  says:
and they dont understand that i would not tell bre's secrets for anything
 BeLLaDoNNa<<your time has come>>  says:
they just dont understand!!!!!!

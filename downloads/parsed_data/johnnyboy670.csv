"event","ok a office supply manager is paying bills right and he wants to keep all his papers together but he doesn't want to use a stapler.  so he decides to use a paper clip but he realizes that there isn't a single paper clip in his whole entire house.  so he goes crazy looking for one. he goes through his entire house knocking everything over because he really wants to keep his bills together(he is one of those neat freaks). so then he has to clean up the mess he made as he does that his wife comes home(also a neat freak) and they look for a paper clip.  eventually they give up.  the next day he goes to work. when he gets to work he gets a call from his wife and she says that he has car has 20 pounds of paper clips in the trunk of his car.

"event","kinda bored but not that bad. 
also i started to think about my plan to take over the world and that it might not work.
i don't think i could get that many mechanical pencils.
also where am i going to get a virus that no one has a cure for?
plus how whould i get anyone to buy the mechanical pencils from me?
and how would i get the people over in europe to buy my pencils?
also one might get open and infect the closest person then every one would know that the mechanical pencils were infected with a virus.
then no one would buy it and i would lose a lot of money buying the pencils.
i might even get arrested for selling infected pencils to people.
i would be called a terroist for the rest of my life.
i don't think that kind of publicty would be good for me.

so inconcluision 

I GIVE UP ONE THAT PLAN!!!!!!




More Palns Will Come I Haven't Given Up Yet"

"event","Plan ""M""(My plan to take over the world):
I am going to sell mechanical pencils. Not a normal mechanical pencils but ones with a virus in it. Then the  virus in the mechanical pencils will infect the people when they take off the eraser to put more led in it. Before that I will have created a antidote for the virus and lock my self in a bomb shelter. Then I will sell it on eBay. To get it will have to give me all of the money in the world or you die from the virus. Then I will just buy my way into all the different offices of the world and become ruler. Do you think it could work?"

Bryan, Sam, Dustin, Kayla and I all were at the movies watching Hot Fuzz&nbsp;and i managed to get into a fist fight with the guy in front of me...</p><p>So you know how movie theaters dont have much leg room... and im really tall... so i was accidently bumping his chair... after like an hour the guy turned around and was like, ""dude quit kicking my fucking chair"" so i was like, ""dude its an accident there isnt much room"" and his g/f started cusing me out... so i was like, ""shut the fuck up slut"" and she threw a pop at me... so i caught it and threw it in her face and the dude jumped up and started trying to hit me and then bryan and sam jumped in and pulled us apart after i got a few good hits on his head since he had chairs between us and i was about 2 feet higher than he was so i was at a huge advantage... and then him and his g/f stormed off...</p><p>good times =)))</p>"

"event","You know what i hate?&nbsp; how people say Lord of the RIngs is the greatest fantasy series ever and talk about how great of writer Tolkien was.&nbsp; I will admit the fact that Lord of the Rings was a good series, but it definatly wasnt great.&nbsp; It was slow paced and boring throughout the majority of the books.&nbsp; Also people talk about how Tolkien described things with minimal detail.&nbsp; To those people i say go back and READ Lord of the Rings because Tolkien definatly wastes pages on description.&nbsp; Also if your going to write a review of the book DONT REFERENCE THE MOVIES!&nbsp; good god people the movies were mostly terrible and dont even come close to the actual books.&nbsp; In my opinion there are much better fantasy novels and series out there.&nbsp; I wont flat out say skip Lord of the Rings but there are plenty of other, better, books to read out there.

Also i hate how people say Nirvana is the best grunge band ever, because there were quite a few better grunge bands than Nirvana, Alice In Chains and Soundgarden to name a few.&nbsp; As Grant Kimura once said, ""Theres more to grunge than Kurt Cobain.""

In conclusion, although Lord of the Rings was the first popular fantasy series its definatly not the best.&nbsp; And although Nirvana was the first mainstream grunge band it also is not the best.

Thank you for tuning in

"event","<p>so yeah... school... im pretty sure ive taken school for granted pretty much my entire life... all through elementry school, junior high and highschool i havent had to put forth much effort at all... i mean i litteraly coasted through highschool with my 3.6 and didnt even really try... i suppose i have gotten so used to the fact that i didnt have to study that i cant even bring myself to study for classes i know i should study for in college...&nbsp; every time i sit down to study i think to myself, ""why should you study, you didnt have to study in highschool"" and of course i answer myself with the typical moral boosting responce of, ""maybe you arnt as smart as you thought you were."" the thing here is i am so used to things being easy that the thought of having to put forth effort scares me... not just in school but in life too... if something prooves difficult i dont do it, or i just ignore it.&nbsp; because lets face it, i am smart, its not like ive gotten less smart since highschool... the only thing thats changed is that classes have gotten harder and im still putting forth my minimal effort... if i dont understand something i bitch and complain about not understanding it but i really cant be bothered to look it up in a book... and im to arrogant to ask for help from friends or a TA because i feel that if i ask for help that somehow makes me less intelligent than the person im asking for help from and i cant stand that feeling... so here i am in college to stuck up to ask for help and to lazy to study... and barley passing my classes... i suppose i could blame this on my highschool or something for ""not preparing me for college"" but really the only person i can blame here is myself because i am to lazy to try... maybe after im done with physics i wont have to worry about this anymore and ill be able to just coast through classes like i used to be able to... but then again... maybe i wont... and you know whats sad... i bought a $150 physics text book at the beginning of the quarter and i havent even opened it... ITS STILL IN ITS FREEKING PLASTIC WRAP!!! god i piss myself off... oh well</p>"

in that order

the nine black alps were pretty good, eagles of death metal were amazing, wolfmother was amazing, mars volta was alright... the lead singer is pretty cool though cuz he cused out the kids who were moshing, and then walked off stage after some kid threw a cup of piss at him, but before he left he offered $10000, unlimited tickets to all their future shows and a whole bunch of other things for the person who brought that persons head to him... i liked him... and then yeah... Red Hot Chili Peppers were just fucking amazing... like OMG WOW!!! and flea is totaly rad... BEST BASS PLAYER EVER!!! after Duff McKagan of course...

but yeah... it was sweet... Ashlyn got thrown out though cuz she tried to sneek into the pit durring red hot chili peppers and then got caught and cused out the security gaurds... =(

"event","ASo about an hour ago to two hours ago i had at least 8 loaded guns pointed at me, and at least 2 of which were M16s and 1 was some kinds shotgun.  I was aslo forced to the ground, handcuffed and put into the back of a police SUV.  Here is that story.

So Bryan, Dustin and I, after watching ""You Only Live Twice"" desided we should leave my house so Sam could get some sleep since he has to work early.  After leaving my house we desided we should make a movie with the fake guns they brought over.  First we went to the gas station though so Dustin could get gas.  After that we drove down to the buisness park near Canyon Park to use the streat lamps for light in our movie, because lets face it, its dark outside at 11pm. APPARENTLY someone saw us with the guns though and called the police.  So at 11:30pm 4 cop cars pull in with lights flashing and a cop SUV comes in as well.  All the doors fly open and cops jump out with guns and start yelling at us to put our hands on our heads.  They told us to keep our hands out of out pockets and to put them on our heads, but Bryan being the genious he is, thought they told us to empty our pockets so he put his hands back in.  At which point they started yelling and every single one of them drew a gun and pointed it at us.  Well at that point they had us come forward one a time and handcuffed us, and put us into seperate cars.  They then started asking me about the guns so i told them they were fake and that we were filming a moive.  They then searched our cars and found the guns, which were 2 fake 6 shooters, an airsoft handgun that looks almost real, and a paintball gun. Once they determined it was all a misunderstanding they sat us down on the curb took off our handcuffs and talked to us about being stupid.  And then they let us go.  All in all it was pretty enertaining since the only one of us who was really that scared was Bryan.  He was FREAKING out.  While Dustin and I for the most part just realised it was a misunderstanding and managed to remain mostly calm.

Interesting start to the day if i do say so myself."

So REALLY early thursday morning(like 12:30am) grant imed me telling me about a beach party at golden gardens the next day at 3... and then he told me i should come... so i decided i would go... so at like 2:30 the next day i picked ashlyn up and we headed to golden gardens... when we got there only 3 of the people had shown up and grant wasnt among them so we just chilled with igor and joe and some other dude i didnt know for a while... then we made hamburgers... right as we were finishing eating grant and melissa(i think thats her name... either that or marissa) and some other dude showed up... so they made burgers... and yeah... it was cool... after a while breanna showed up so we were all just chillin... we also put up some weird tent thing because it had started to rain but it stoped so we took it down after a while... then we went and had a fire in one of the fire pits... i think Igor had way to much fun with the lighter fluid at this point because he used like the rest of the can... then we just chilled around the fire till it was almost out... and then we all parted ways... there are lots of pictures on <a href=""http://washington.facebook.com/profile.php?id=10723081"">Igors facebook</a> for those of you who have facebook... after that ashlyn and i went back to her dorm where i ended up crashing for the night..

Friday
I woke up at like 10:30 or w/e smelling like a campfire and decided i should prolly head home so i said goodbye to ashlyn and left... upon arriving home i took a shower and started reading... after reading for like 2 hours i got up and took ANOTHER shower because i still smelled like a campfire... at about 6 i picked ashlyn up at the YMCA and drove to jordans for his party... we ended up chilling there till like 12 playing kickball and watching movies... while we were playing kickball sam was foolishly tossed over a barbed wire fence into a mass of blackberry bushes in order to retreave the ball, which he did... and ended up not being hurt at all... which was pretty amazing...

Sunday
Well today i woke up early and took my car to the shop to get an oilchange and to get the radiator looked at cuz something is up with it... and after that i just chilled at my house talking with my grandma and reading untill like 5:30 or 6 or so when ashlyn called me... at that point i went and picked her up... then we went back to my house for my cousin andrea's college graduation party... which was fun, cuz i found out two of my moms cousins had been arrested for robbing banks... i have an awesome family... then we just talked to my uncle matt for a while about engineering and such untill 9 when i took ashlyn to the airport =(... shes gone for like 10 days or so visiting her family... after that i came back home and chilled and talked to my cousin and aunt and dad for a while till my uncle matt, aunt judy, and andrea left... so now here i am updating this for the last few days of my life...

so yeah, peace kids"

seriously though ashlyn is an awesome g/f... ive never actually met someone who decided that they would kill me without a second thought given the chance... its pretty sweet... taking over the world just got a ton more interesting =)"

"event","Friday:
So i woke up and went to school... same as everyother day lol... but i decided to see if ashlyn wanted to come over and chill after school so i called her and she was like sure ill come over after i turn in some job applications...  then i went home... at home i promptly realised bryan was at my house... so i went inside and demanded that we go see X3 that night... and bryan being the smart man that he is, readily agreed... we decided to go see the 9:40 showing so since it was like 4 we had some time to kill... i started working on my programming homework and finished my HuffmanTree class which means i have like 85% of the assignment left to do lol... then ashlyn called me to tell me she was at cascadia so i went and picked her up... after arriving back at mu house we all just chillaxed and messed around with my dads digital camera.  then my dad decided we all needed to go to this pizza restraunt in Clearview so we packed into 2 cars and drove down there... on the way i took mass cool pictures of us while we were inside the car... plus a buch of really cool AirGuitar pictures lol... once we arrived there the guy was like SORRY GUYS but we close in like 20min... but since your cool ill make you pizza and you can take them home... so me, ashlyn, sam and bryan piled back into the car we took and drove back home where we just chillaxed till the food arived... after that we ate the pizza and left to go see X3... at this point is when i grabbed my awesome blue hat that i used to wear all the time (I FOUND IT!!!! <3 <3 <3) and ashlyn grabbed the purple imitation blue hat... once arriving in woodinville we proceeded to try and protect our hats from sam and bryan who wanted to destroy them... X3 was a very good movie so you should all go see it... watch all the credits too cuz theres a cool little extra sceen after them... after the movie we just went back to my house and chilled till like 3 when we all just crashed...

Saturday:
Ashlyn and I were supposed to go to the folklife festival with shayleen and sara and a bunch of their friends but they decided not to go because it was raining hardcore... so ashlyn and i went and rented Old School, Waynes World, and The Fugitive... SHE HAD NEVER SEEN OLD SCHOOL OR WAYNES WORLD!!! CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT!!! but yeah so we watched the first two movies and then ate dinner... after dinner we sat down to watch the fugitive and yeah... I TOTALY DIDNT REALISE THAT WRONGFULLY ACCUSED WAS A PARRODY OF THE FUGITIVE!!! so needless to say my dad laughed at me allot... after watching all the movies i took ashlyn home... once getting back to my house sam and i chilled and played odyssey for a while and then went to bed...

Sunday:
Well ashlyn and i decided that if sunday was better outside that saturday was we were gonna go to folklife... and so since it was better outside we decided to go... folklife was pretty cool... saw a bunch of cool bands and i decided on a whole bunch of new insturments that i need in my band when i make it... so yeah... my bands not gonna make any money cuz theres gonna be like 100 people in it lol... after folklife we tried calling jordan to see if he wanted to hang out but he wasnt answering his phone... so we called bryan and sam... but they were going to cams to play D&D so ashlyn and i just went back to my house and chilled... we talked to my parents a whole bunch and then went and chilled in my living room and beat eachother to death with pillows...  at like 4 sam got home so we chilled with him till like 5 when we all went to sleep...

Monday:
isnt over yet moron.. but i woke up at like 1 and chilled with ashlyn and sam till like 3 or 4 when i took ashlyn home... and now here i am doing this... talking on aim... and doing anything else i can think of to put off doing my programming homework... so yeah...  peace kids"

well last monday was stevens birthday so i told him i would go to his house for that... and then they decided they were gonna go out in his boat and he wanted me to skip all my classes to go out with him... but i didnt cuz im a good kid... durring lunch i went and hung out with ashlyn at her dorm and we got the concert tickets for The (International) Noice Conspiracy concert... and she told me that apparently steven wanted us to meet him at log boom so we could get out in the boat with him... so after our last class we went to wait for the bus but ashlyn WAS 20 SECONDS LATE so we had to wait for the next bus... we eventually ended up out on the boat though so that was fun... afterwords we just went and chilled at stevens house where they decided it would be great fun to tickle me... cuz they are bastards... and so we watched some movies and tv and ended up getting in the hot tub... it was a pretty good day

tuesday and wednesday nothing terribly exciting happened except that on tuesday i failed a math midterm and on wednesday i failed a chem mid term... so yeah...

thursday i skiped math cuz i didnt feel like going and then should have skiped chemistry cuz it was a lab lecture but i didnt cuz i had to wait for steven and ashlyn to get out of class anyways... then after school we went and picked up alex and went out in stevens boat... first off launching the boat proved difficult cuz there was this werid yellow floaty thing on the water that was in our way... but we managed to avoid that... then stevens boat wouldnt start... so he spent like 20 min trying to fix it untill it started... then we went and chilled in his boat by juanita beach for like an hour... then alex decided he wanted to go intertubing... but the boat wouldnt start... so steven spent like an hour trying to get it to work untill it eventually did... after that steven and i decided to teach me to learn to pull skiers and wakeboarders so we spent the next 30 or so min teaching me to pull people... after that steven decided to start trying to throw people off the boat... i didnt help alex when steven decided to throw him over so he decided that i had to be taught a lesson... so he shot me with steven water gun thing... after we got back we chilled in the hot tub untill steven kicked us out of his house cuz he had to leave...

friday i went to school and chilled till i had to go home... then at like 6 i left to go pick up ashlyn for the concert but it took me like an hour to get there since i misjudged trafic... and then it took us forever to find the club it was at cuz it was hidden away in a back corner thats about impossible to find... but the concert was amazing... of the two opening bands The Divorce were freaking amazing and The Feaver were ok... and then The (International) Noice Conspiracy were just awesome... it was pretty freaking awesome... after that we went back to my house and chillaxed with sam and watched better off dead... which is a great movie btw... and then we just chrashed here...

yesterday we just hung out around my house till about 1 or so when we went and rented 3 movies... Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure, Kung-Pow, and Spiders 2... we tryed to watch Kung-Pow but it didnt work so we watched Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure... which is ANOTHER great movie... bryan showed up about halfway threw that movie and afterwords we went out for lunch at qdoba... then we came back to my house and watched Spiders 2... which is an AMAZINGLY horrible horror film about spiders that was HILARIOUS cuz of how retarted everyone was... so yeah... go rent that movie cuz its awesome... then we just sat around my house chilling and trying to figure out what to do... we ate dinner with my family and then decided to go see Mission Impossible 3 at 10:20... and i must say... that movie was pretty good... then we just chillaxed here till about 2 when bryan left and i took ashlyn home...

today ive just been chilling doing nothing and reading and its been fun... so yeah... peace"

"event","Well friday was pretty cool... i woke up, took a shower, went to school and all that good stuff... which is mostly boring... BUT AFTER SCHOOL i went over to stevens to chill with him and alex but i had to leave at 5:30 to help my dad with something but after that i went back over to stevens to chill with him and ashlyn... We mostly just hung out and watched tv till 5 when we just went to bed... the only thing i ate the whole day though was one of the packets of crackers in a salteen cracker box... which was like 50% of my daily sodium...

Today we all got up at like 12 and chilled at stevens till he had to leave at 1... so then i was gonna drive ashlyn home so she could go looking for a job, and then i got the great idea i should go with her... so we walked around seattle from 1:30 till like 7 or so looking for places she could get applications... we got really lost too since neither of us know seattle that well... the only sad thing is i forgot about dinner with shayleen and grant so i wasnt able to see them like i had planned which was sad... but after i got home at like 8 i just chilled with bryan and wached the Great Excape so that was pretty cool... 

i also found out bryan cant go the the snow patrol concert with us because hes gonna be in florida and sam doesnt want to go anymore since its on a thursday durring his fianls week... and ashlyn might be out of town... so yeah... this is gonna suck if i have to go by myself... oh well

"event","so friday night i went to a rave with steven, ashlyn, lacey, skyler and bryson(sp)? and i know what all of you are thinking right now... Ron? Rave? WTF? and yes i know... for the first 3 or so hours the rave was pretty tight, i just chilled and bounced and people kept pushing me... after that though i was HELLA tired so i just sat down to chill and people kept stepping on me... but then ashlyn got tired too and sat down with me and we just talked for a while and then chilled... but seriously... im pretty sure there were at least 500 people there all packed into this small building... im pretty sure that of that 500 at least 400 were on X... and that of that 500 at least 200 were stoned... PLUS im pretty sure that 95& of the girls there were only wearing underwear or less... plus this rave was a good 8 hours long and didnt end till 4am

so yeah not only was i ridiculously tired after the rave then steven decided we needed to go to some after party... at that after party everyone was smoking and nothing was going on and steven was like dude were gonna be here till noon and i was like FUCK THAT so i called bryan... but bryan like any normal human being didnt answer his phone at 5am... i concidered calling sam but was like naw ill let him sleep so i called my dad... so then my dad showed up at 5:30 and ashlyn decided she wanted a ride home too so we dropped her off at the UW... then my dad dropped me off at stevens so i could get my car... and let me tell you driving home at 6am when your are so tired you can barly see isnt as fun as it sounds... but i made it home alright... i didnt end up going to bed till like 7am either... and then i could hardly sleep so i just mostly listened to music till like 1pm or so... and then got up...

i dont think im prolly gonna go to a rave again unless someone is REALLY good at convincing me..."

"event","when you examine my life you will find many interesting ideas that if properly put into action could probably save the world tons of money, keep little kids occupied and make the world a more peaceful place.  It really is to bad no one takes the time to properly think about my ideas and put them in the right contex.  Oh well, thats why one day i will rule the world and you will all be my slaves.

anyways i havent REALLY talked about anything in here for a long time and i figure now is a good of time as any for a halfway decent post about my life, expecially since i cant sleep cuz im thinking way to much.  I always find it facinating when for the first half of the day i struggle to stay awake and after 7 i would do anything to go to sleep. Oh well, sucks to be me i guess.

So first things first im gonna talk about my day.  Today was a pretty good day.  I got enough sleep last night so i wasnt AS tired as i normally am.  I managed to stay awake threw all of my classes.  I ACTUALLY sat outside today at school and enjoyed it, which doesnt happen very much.  Of course that only lasted till steven saw me and came over and started talking to me.  I mean i like steven but DAMN sometimes he has the worst timing.  Well after he got there it wasnt peaceful and quiet anymore so it kinda defeated the purpose of being outside but i dealt with it.  Then he called ashlyn and so we just chilled outside till we had to go to class.  After that i went home and tried to chill with sam but he was snappy so i gave up on that and just went upstairs and talked to my dad about all the things i should have done in highschool.  Then at like 7 i went over and chilled with steven and ashlyn at stevens house.  Then sara came over and they started making out on the couch i was sitting on so i was like screw that and went to get wheatthins.  To bad they were weird tomato ones so i about died when i ate them.  After a while my neck started to hurt so i took some ibuprofin(sp?) and then managed to secure the couch when steven and sara got up to get something to eat.  So we watched tv mostly and talked and steven and i got in a sandle fight with ashlyns sandles which was pretty fun. And then i went home at like 1 or so, so here i am.  And on reflection of my day i think overall it was a good day.

I am also pretty happy with the way my life is going right now, I have a bunch of good friends and people i can trust without worring about things.  School is great for the most part, although chemistry can be a bitch.  I feel good for the most part none of that emotional crap i was going threw last year and so everything seems pretty damn good to me.  Although it would be more fun if like neal and andrew came home more often, and if they called me when they did. Plus i picked out new glasses yesterday so i should be getting those soon, which means first off that i will have sunglasses since this pare comes with sunglass attachments, and second off means taht i wont have to wear contacts all the time anymore which i might actually miss since ive started getting used to them.  AND (this prolly being the most important message in this entire post) I MIGHT GET A HAIR CUT! ive been thinking about it and now im about 50/50 with the idea.  plus im not sure how short i would get it cut.  but if i do you guys can change your =( faces to =) and that will make me =) which is a good thing.

So i started writing a book / story as well, although its not going to well.  It lacks any sence of plot and the characters arnt very good but at least im writing again, which i like allot so it doesnt matter how lame my stories are cuz i figure i can get better.  Plus people seem to lik the stories i wrote back in like 8th grade even though they sucked so i figure thats a plus for me right?

I guess that means that there is only one part of my life that actualy isnt perfect.  And that would be girls.  But of course at this point you all say, ""But Ron isnt that the only part of your life that usually isnt pefect"" and then i would reply, ""Well yeah but if i thought about it that way you all wouldnt have anything to read in my journal"" and then you guys would be like, ""yeah... Ron... we only read your journal cuz we are bored and its 2am what else are we gonna do"" and then im like ""STFU N00BS!"" and then thats teh end of that conversation. But seriously i mean i think its alright cuz theres this girl i like and we seem to be getting along which is good.  So i guess even this part of my life isnt that bad.

NOW for one of the most IMPORTANT parts of this entry. and by important i of course mean not any more special than anything else in here.  But this summer i think bryan and i will FIANLY take our trip to colorado to see kenny that we have been talking about SINCE he moved there two years ago.  Although we figure its gonna cost us about $400 worth of gas to drive there and back, which is a bummer, but it is cheaper than flying or taking the bus.  Flying costs $370 apiece and the bus costs about $250 apiece so we figure its worth it.

Which brings me to the close of this post.  My life is good i <3 (yes <3 is a verb) all you guys and thanks for being around for me. Thank you"

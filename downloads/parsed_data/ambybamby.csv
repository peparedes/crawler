huge Karl Wolf news came to me today, I couldn't be more excited. It's big dealing now :) I laugh at those who have disbelieved the dreams I am truly living. At times I WILL raise my nose up a lil in the air and admit I'm bring a total bitch, but I have ever right. Those who have been by my side and true to me are all that matter in my past. Others...well FU. :)"

"event","I took the skytrain out to meet Alastair yesterday, hopped on the bus across Granville bridge and got off at Broadway. The trip didn't take that long at all and if I left from work, which is right by scott road, it would have been far shorter. I called him when I got off the bus and he began to walk down the street to meet me. I knew where he lived although I thought it would be better to meet, it's only a few blocks walk.

As I was walking up the small hill I saw a body walking towards me that looked familiar, my flutterbugs were in full rage by then. As he got closer and I could make out his features I realised he was far more amazing looking than I thought a few days ago. About 30 feel away now I find it hard to contain a smile that's pushing my cheeks up so high my eyes are almost shut. I try with everything I have in me to calm that smile down even to the point of putting my hands on my cheeks and smooshing them. By then we reached eachother and I started giggling. He asked if I was laughing at him, I told him no but at myself cause the smile wouldn't go away and I was trying to calm it down. 

He still wasn't feeling that well so we went back to his place and then desided on Boston Pizza for dinner. After that we headed back and watched some TV...yay for Family Guy!!! He scored points by his great dvd collection as well. I had to be awake for work by 4ish so we passed out early. I kept thinking before I could fall asleep though. I told him i was kinda shocked I even went over there, normally if I like someone and know that they might like me as well I run. If they live far away, or I know nothing is going to come of my attraction I feel safer falling for them. 
Strange I know but safe...and I'm used to safe. 

As I left in the morning I text msg'ed him saying how unexpected it has been to meet someone so amazing, that I normally run but from him I don't want to. It's even shocking that I am telling him how I feel, I need to let down this wall a little bit. Perhaps this weekend...since it's my last off work forsure. Tested for my Xbox training tomorrow and then will be taking calls. Time to get studying now..."

Got my BSB tickets today, I'm super happy :) 

I'm a lil nervous right now, I haven't had this feeling in ages. I'm heading to Alastair's place as soon as I get ready. I find myself holding off on getting ready although I want to hurry down there...I haven't seen him since Sunday although we've talked. I'll be staying the night there tonight and leaving for work early, makes it easier than coming home and not getting a good sleep. 
This will be the first time seeing him after the weekend tho, after the 2 evenings we spent together with other people around for the most part. Now it's just going to be me and him *bites nails* Not that we weren't alone before but for some reason I'm nervous hahahaha"

"event","So many things have happend since my birthday so I'm gonna do this update in short form:

-PVD was awesome, one of my better nights.
-Friday of my bday weekend was a wreck, some emotional stuff happened then I had to do my dinner when I would have rather just crawled under a rock....turned out well in the end.
-Saturday I worked in the day then it was off to Toyko Lounge where I was treated like a Birthday Princess. Met for drinks first then over to Vibes then to TL...SO MUCH FUN!!!
-Sunday I slept through most of, I was worried about how monday was going to go
-Monday was my birthday and it turned out PERFECT. Someone came back to town and we had a nice quiet night in, thai food, family guy and wine...bubble bath and well just a wonderful night :) best bday yet

What's gone on since:

-Sonic City (Rod's band) opened for Everclear last friday, Gin Blossoms and Holly McNarland on Saturday and Whitecaps game on sunday. I made it to all three shows. Crazy hectic weekend but was well worth it. The band is getting so much better together on stage, each show I can see a lil more. 

-Not only am I Rod's publicist I am now the bands :) Have a lot of plans 
-Sonic City has left on tour opening for Honeymoon Suite in western canada...I am excited to hear how things are going. Their second show is tonight...I hope i get an update early this week, the suspense is killing me. 

-I have a new full time job, with wanting to take off for a bit at the end of Sept I needed to stash some cash away and fast. I am now working for Xbox call center, no one really knows too much as we're just training and the first class to go through it. However if someone calls Xbox support line they could very well be getting my help hahaha I know too many people with Xbox!!! My hours right now are 6-2pm it's a lil rough but i'm making do. 

-Worked at Boy George on the weekend, crazy guy he is...or girl...or ummm whatever lol I met an AMAZING person there though. Ended up going out with him Saturday night as well, we didn't want the night to end so we were together until very late sunday afternoon. He's stunning, I couldn't take my eyes off him before we even talked. He stayed with me the whole night on friday while i was working and I really enjoyed his company. I'm a lil nervous because I normally guard my feelings but there's just something about him. Maybe the fact that he's being really open with his feelings and saying he wants to get to know me and such.

I sooooooooo gotta get off here and go call him...oh I have the flutterbugs!!!"

I had planned to meet up with a bunch of the fans in the chatroom, which we did...not many people use it so it was nice to see some people chatting :)

As the radio session started I enjoyed my Maple Cream Ale and cracked up seeing GranVILLE on the bottle...yes Darude's name is Ville. He introduced himself as the music started playing and said something like ""If anyone is having a birthday haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaappy birthday""  he knows I was listening, he knows it was the kick off to my bday weekend...he knows how much such a simple little thing would melt me. I truly am blessed to have a friend like him, they are hard to come by!!! 

He also played my all time fave electronica song in his set :) Now time to get ready for PVD woohoo this is gonna be one crazy weekend"

Featuring Danny Sveinson and Rod Burn

The ""featuring"" part will remain on mainly in Vancouver so people who have heard the names will clue in that it's now the band. Many people have heard about Danny because of his amazing skills and past media coverage. Of course people have heard about Rod, I always get a kick out of talking to yet another local band or bandFANs and they say ""OH hey I know Rod""...oh yes everyone ""knows"" him right? HAHA Difference of knowing and knowing of...but it's all good...far too used to that by now."

"event","Ever since the first time Carly took me to see The Burn Project oh so long ago I saw a talent in Rod that made me believe. Very few people move me in that way and doing it on first impression is VERY impressive. I saw him perform with the old band many times and each time impressed me more yet worried me that they would be just another local band. When Rod asked me to come down to Media Club for his first solo show at the start of this year I did, right then I knew he was going towards that shinning spotlight and on the right track. 
He blew me away, reminded me of when I first met another person I worked with way back. Someone I put ALL my energy into, no regrets...live and learn from that situation. Maybe this happened for a reason, seems everyone I've worked with like this has happened this way.
Rod named me publicist/promoter yesterday, I couldn't be happier!!!

6 more days until my bday AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

I was at the mall today and saw so many Carebears, this all started as a joke but now I see them everywhere and can't help but go look at them. I must see which new ones they have out, what their names are and today I even saw one in Walmart that gives hugs and makes a kissy noise!!!"

Heading out to see Rod's band open for State Of Shock tomorrow evening as well at Media Club, haven't been there in a while so kinda looking forward to it. Mario and I will hit up Toyko Lounge after that since Jeremie and Amaan have a 3 hour set.

"event","I am not sure how to feel right now and due to the nature of the situation I can hardly say much. I moved to this house in 1992, across the street were 2 guys a couple years older than me and their younger sister who is now 19. For two summers (I think I was in 14&15) at the time I looked after her everyday. She'd come to my house as our parents went off to work. Often times I'd still be sleeping and she'd crawl into my bed and we'd watch TV or she'd make me breakfast. We ALWAYS had things planned out, we'd go for long walks, take the bus to the mall, go for coffee...ok so it was really italian sodas but still we were together nonstop (funny it's the coffee shop my family owns now!!!)
One of our greatest adventures was saving our money for a couple weeks and heading down to Science World, we got bored pretty fast there so bussed it to Playland not knowing how much it would cost to go in. We got off the bus and sat in the grass counting our money, we had enough...so we called home and said we were already there and begged for a ride home at night hahaha 

She was a good kid back then, always listened to me however could get away with anything at home. She was the baby, the only girl and heck her brothers got away with even more...but that was just how it was there. We didn't talk as much over the last few years but the odd time would run into eachother and I'd ask her what was going on. She knew she could get away with anything and get everything she wanted.

Her mom came over today to give us some news, I didn't come out of my office but listened and talked to my parents about it later. Not going into details (some are in todays Province on page a4) she was in a really bad car wreck. Herself and another guy very badly hurt and one dead. She has broken ribs, pelvis and major swelling/brusing. She has been strapped to a board so she can't move as she has something lodged in her back about 40%, if she moves before the operation she could very easily cause a lot of damage and never walk again. 

Part of me feels guilty for not being around, part of me feels anger towards her parents and of course towards the people she's been involved with as of late. 
I don't know when I will see her, I don't really want to go to the hospital for personal reasons but I do know I need to talk to her in due time. 

Poor girl is going to have a long road to recovery, not to mention the emotional trama and major lawsuits she'll have to face. Maybe she needs her ""big sister"" back."

"event","This week has been a strange one, not working seemed to make it fly by...was soooo busy! Found out my boss (basically the one who desided I was only getting half my raise but didn't tell me) got fired. Actually they told the rest of the staff there would be some ""changes"" or some bullshit to make it sound better than the reality of it. 
Although nothing really against him personally besides the fact I feel he's very 2-faced he is not fit to be in charge of the Vancouver office, sorry but I could manage staff better than that! 
I worked my first shift at the coffee shop since last Aug, it was strange but went by fast. Since the fire the whole store is slightly different...ice machine lower, space where there was little before but I managed to not screw anything up.

Friday night I went out with Rachel :) We headed to a pub my friend is a cook at and downed some beer and wings...YUM. Miss that girlie...actually had a good night...although sleeping after drinking rum wasn't a good idea. Came back to my house thinking I'd be able to sleep but wasn't feeling that great. I had to drive my friend back home to Port Moody once he woke up and I must say it's pretty nice up there!!! He lives on this big hill with a bunch of new houses, I'd never been up there and was really impressed.

"event","I quit my day job.
I have many reasons why but some of the major ones are
-After I was told about my raise when payday rolled around only half of it was given to me. You can NOT tell someone they are making suchNsuch an hour and then cut it back without notice. I looked at my stub and was fuming, my manager pulled me into the back office and explained that the one person above her thought that a buck an hour was too much right away and would review it again in one month. I explained to her that was totally unfair to not tell me about it, they had 2 weeks....2 freaking weeks and not a word, they don't have the guts in that place to confront ANYONE when there are problems. 
My manager agreed with me and said she was going to add bonus' to my cheques to equal out to as much as my raise would be. Next payday...NO BONUS. This friday came around and again nothing was added!!!

-When customers call in to complain very often things are left undone, or they take their time to respond making people very upset and them taking it out on whoever happens to answer the phone. I'm the type of person who can laugh it off, so are others in the office but if we talk/laugh about it we are called ""negitive"". Whatever!

-I was there just over 6 months, I have seen about 6 new faces come and go in the office. I can't even count how many others anymore. In the last 2 weeks about 5/6 people have left the company...lets just say others are looking for jobs as well.

I could go on but I won't...it wasn't all bad but the whole money thing was really starting to get to me. Also when so many of the phone calls were coming to my phone first so I was getting dinged and lower sales %'s I was getting VERY mad. I went in yesterday for 6 hours on the stat, I wonder if they will remember to even pay me stat pay OR my bonus' I'm owed. If not then I'll take it from there...I'll know in about 2 weeks. 

FINALLY I can hammer down and do my thing now.

Karl shot the video for the first single today, I can't wait to find out how it went. Signed a deal with a major distribution as well...yes major major major :) Butterflies will be out on the radio SOON!"

"event","Laying alone thinking to myself wondering what to say
I wish it was as clear as the brightness is to day
Simple words clouded in thought when ever you're around
Lost by the look in your eyes and the silence of your sound
Sometimes I want to ask you if you know how I feel?
Pulling back before I do questioning if it is real
Sometimes I want to tell you that I really truly care
Pulling back I don't 'cause right now I can't promise I'll always be there
Sometimes I want to say I love when you are near
Pulling back tho I am silented by the things that I most fear
Sometimes I worry you'll think my feelings are more than I have shown
Pulling back because I'm used to living and dreaming on my own
I guess the words were simple and my silence now has a sound
Wishing I could have said this to you when you were around
But I had this on my mind and it couldn't wait another day
Thank you for listening and I hope you understand what I had to say


I hate when people read into me saying ""I care"" or ""I like you"" too much...it doesn't mean I am any where ready to start a relationship on the next level, but it also doesn't mean I'm 100% not ready. Tonight I wrote that, sure it's a lil cheesy but it's how I felt at the time. Phrasing is off but I'll correct it when I get around to it. Rod called when I was writing it, I couldn't help but giggle...shy giggle I'm sure. At the end of our fast abnormally long phone call...wow i think it was almost 5 mins...I said I'd email him something. I'm sure he's sleeping, I'm sure it will be on my mind until I either talk to him or see him tomorrow wondering if he is laughing or something :) 
Felt good, now I can try and sleep."

"event","Kinda felt like crap all weekend and have no idea why. 
Velvet Revolver was fukken GREAT! We met up with some people down there and then went to our seats. Right across from the stage, looking directly forward...perfect! A song or so into their set I had to go pee again so I went but never came back. Naw I didn't leave Rod there, but I got him to come over to my new found seats...right beside the stage. Was great being able to watch from front row, those guys rocked it hard. At the end a drum stick got tossed at me and we got a couple guitar pics, always good memories to add to my collection :)

Friday I left early and met up with Joshua, sat and chatted at his office for a while then headed for coffee with the girls then home. I haven't done anything else this weekend but work and ummm work from home. Oh I did just move my room around, I have no idea why.

A couple of my friends met Rod and then when I talked to them after they told me how much they liked him. I dunno but stuff like that kind of makes me pull back. I'm not used to being in situations like this and knowing the fact that he's going to be off on tour and such makes me guard my feelings. I didn't think this would carry on this long...I'm not saying it's a bad thing but at times when I think about it I kinda wonder what I am doing. Love chilling with him, looooooove the other things we do ;) ;) and find I don't have that total shy side about me around him, he does bring out the real me. Strange how since friday morning i've kinda pulled back tho. 
FUKKED!"

The stress of the store has gotten to everyone but atleast it's open now. Then the crack head driving under his truck trailer in LA didn't help...people need to deal with shit in better ways. YES bad things happen, they happen to everyone...it doesn't mean take it out on ME!

I'm up early so I could drive mom to work, I have 2 hours to get fully ready for work and then heading straight to Rod's...YAY concert tonight!!! Funny I was thinking about perfect date ideas while filling out an email quiz and concert was one of them...duh this is me we're talking about haha.

Last night I couldn't take it anymore at work, I knew the lady that got hired after me had gotten a raise a couple weeks ago. However I'm the one they always count on to do more things. I now do a lot of the dispatch, I'm left alone in the office to handle stuff and I bust my ass coming in at 7am to help make the office run more smoothly. I knew about a week ago this happened and I have been boiling mad about it ever since. Last night after finding a bunch of things misfiled by someone who is making more money then me, and clearly shouldn't be due to the fact she can't do the job right I had had enough. My boss came to pick me up and drive me to the skytrain, I told her about the misfiles and showed her a new system I put in to maybe help out...even though it's just carelessness. After that she asked if there was anything more I wanted to say, she knew something has been bothering me. I didn't wanna say anything as someone from head office is here, I was going to wait until after next week because I'll be proving I am a team player by being the only other person in the office for 7 days when we clearly need atleast 3. 
I gave in and said something tho, I told her I knew and didn't know why that had happened...I asked if I wasn't doing a good enough job, I felt like it was a slap in the face and that they were using me because I will do work that's tossed at me without bitching. 

I got a raise :) 

Time to head off and get ready, didn't sleep much again last night...I got a lil giddy after Rod called hahaha what the heck is going on with this situation!?!?!"

Yes OH yes...Fleetwood Esquires is back in biz after a long hard 9 weeks. I can't wait to go there tomorrow and have a skinny chai tea made by meeeeeeeeeeeeeee. Oh how I want a hot chocolate, oh how I want a fruit smoothie, a vanilla bean steamer, a chocolate SINsation frappe...ahhhhhhhhh finally if I want it I CAN HAVE IT. No having to suffer with other places saying ""No, sorry we can't make our drinks like that"" let me behind that counter, I wanna make things the way I like them to taste and damnit low fat/sugar free too!!!

Besides that, the new girl at work quit today...sucks cause I'm gonna have to work crazy hours while we are hiring new staff and another girl is away. I wish I could work less hours there, take a shift or two at the coffee shop and focus more on music. With Karl finishing up producing in Vegas that's the way it will be in a few weeks!!! Can't wait!!! Plus a bunch of other things are still in the works with other people...waiting sucks sometimes. 

I still can't sleep. I was at Rod's place last night tossing and turning for 3 hours, I tried to nap after work but only got 10 mins in. Atleast I don't have to wake up early tomorrow, although I'm sure I will...I've forgot how to sleep!!! I was about to call Rod tonight before I first tried to pass out when BAM he called me. I answered laughing, he was reading my mind. We're going to Velvet Revolver on Thursday, I can't wait :)"

"event","So much for a long weekend, oh well it's not like I have family or anything else to do but work. 
I was off work by 6pm on Thursday night and finally got home a lil after 7ish, I was pretty tired but thought what the hell ""predrinking while getting ready dancing around my room for hours"" before hand. We said hi to everyone and went and grabbed a drink...couple mins later my phone was ringing...Rod! He had just got home and asked what I was up to. I knew I wouldn't be dancing around so finished my drink and headed to the skytrain just in time for the last one. 
It seemed to take forever, I really had to pee!!! I wanted to get off and go somewhere but at that time of night and all alone I just suffered and crossed my legs. It didnt help when he called me saying he had to go too but was waiting for me at the skytrain station hahaha He's a smart cookie though, Timmy's is right there...phew I made it before a puddle formed under my seat. 
We headed up to his place and during the short walk I asked if he would come to the U2 concert with me. I've had tickets, I've mentioned it before but wasn't sure yet what was going on. I thought I'd ask him for real this time...YAY April 30th will be a great night. 
We sat around and drank a big ol' bottle of wine, chatted and well before I knew it the sun was coming up!!! Caught a couple hours of sleep and then headed home...he was heading off to the studio or to write or *shrugs* something like that hahaha but then again isn't he always? :) RodStar hahaha

I met Steve for lunch at Metrotown...mmm Thai!!! We shopped around a bit and he bought some toys...it was pretty funny. I got home and crashed, was so drained oh well had to be up at 5am for work. 
I wanted to go out Saturday night but plans for all jumbled, was gonna go downtown to see Rod after he was done his stuff but him losing his cell phone didn't help any hahaha poor guy!! I would be lost without mine, atleast he got it back. 

Now it's Easter sunday and the bunny popped by my house and left me some chocolate which I can't bare to eat. I went for breakie with Sarah and I am still stuffed...yay for no family dinner!!! 
After talking to Rod this morning about what he went through last night I was thinking I wouldn't see him until we go see Velvet Revolver on thursday. He called me this afternoon again though asking if I wanted to do something tonight. I have to admit that kinda made my weekend!!! He's out with his family right now and we'll meet up later tonight. With all the stress around my house with the store and crap, plus trying to not get down that I can't have a big ol' family holiday gathering it will be nice to spend time with him. 

This is too strange, I didn't want to admit that I did like him...I've never really said anything to him either. Well until the last time I was there...drunk, stressed and balling my eyes out hahaha Hot eh? Feels good though, trying not to be scared and run off like I've done in the past."

The Danny S Band have a show @ Roxy starting at 8pm sharp (no worried won't be a late night). 
If you haven't heard of Danny Sveinson you are missing out, he's 11 years old and rocks a guitar far beyond his years. 
Danny has been everywhere lately. Closed out the Whistler Ski/Snowboarding Championships, is the youngest to play at the Commodore Ballroom, and was featured on the front page of the Georgia Straight! He's also played the Apollo Theater and the Iridium Jazz Club (with Les Paul) in NY!!!
Danny has been seen opening for artists such as Colin James, Wide Mouth Mason, 54-40 and The Northern Pikes. You may have caught a glimps of him on the countless TV shows and articles he's done as well. 

Along with Rod Burn (vocals), Matt Grose (bass) and Dean Richards (drum) Danny will be amazing crowds all over the place this summer. So come out and enjoy some good music and heck some good ol' quality time with yours truly :) I've been far too busy to see a lot of you and with the hectic schedule that's coming up ya never know when the next time will be.

For more info check out www.rockandrollkid.com (Site is being updated so check back often)

Please respond letting me know if you can make it and how many will be with you :) 
Thanks and hope to see you there!!!

Cheers,
Amber

PS- I'm sure some of you were smart enough to realize who the vocals of the band is...yes it's the same person whose solo shows I've invited you out to before as well as a band in the past ;) So now ya know just how good the show is gonna be!!!"

"event","After a stressful work week I didn't do much on friday night. Messed around doing some work at home and passed out early, or atleast tried to. TV was up way too high and I couldn't breathe under my pillow to well. I tossed and turned all night, I think there was just too much on my mind as well. 
There is crap going on at work that I am not happy with, I normally just let it slide but when it's to do with lack of money I get annoyed. Woke up far too early on Saturday and put in a 9.5 hour shift, was not happy about that but was super grateful Steve came to pick me up.
I was given an iPOD Shuffle and some cash from my boss for looking after his dogs while he/family went to California. I played around with the iPOD a bit and raced to get ready. 

I picked up Steve and we changed plans around and headed straight down to Toyko Lounge. I love this place on a Saturday night, I want to try and get more people coming out there. It's always so chill and great music. Seany was playing although we didn't get to stay for his set, heard it went well though. 

I drove Steve over to Onyx to meet up with some girls and was off for the night. Some crap happened on my drive back downtown and was so happy to cuddle up in Rod's arms. Some creepy guy was following me from BBY back to Vancouver, he was in front of me...stopped & pulled over. Then he got behind me, would basically do circles around me in his car while driving down Kingsway. I got to Main St and once heading downtown took back streets and handled the situation with cops in the end. Rod had phoned during all this and said he was tired and maybe I should come over, I quickly said ""I'm on my way, be there very soon"" and hung up. When I told him what happened he said he noticed I was short with him, I felt bad but he totally understood. We went straight to his room to lay down, cuddled up and had a great night :) Although I did have a hard time falling asleep again, I kept seeing that car with the creep! 

I woke up and left around 9am as I knew I was gonna get in shit for having the car out all night. I raced to the mall and got Barb's baby shower gifts and came home to help mom set up. A bunch of the girls came over and we played games, opened gifts and ate. Was a chill afternoon. I'm getting a little excited for the baby to come :) 

I've messed around on my computer since everyone left, been having probs with it so needed to do some cleaning. I'm pretty sleepy tonight so I'm sure I'll turn in early. I've been working on a lot of lyrics lately, I wish I knew how to play guitar better (I need to find someone with one sitting around so i can borrow it for a while, I had to sell mine when I was moving to the UK) Rod's inspired me lately...opening up and having these emotions I've eased into but am often scared of has done strange things to me."

"event","I awoke Thursday morning cuddled up to someone I've found myself getting a lil closer to over time. There has never been any expectations between us, well none from my end anyway. I never really thought it would carry on this long, although I won't deny I'm glad it has. 
When he came to visit me a few times while I was house sitting we'd actually sit and talk...over a lil wine of course and always end with a good time :) And oh how those good times seem to be getting better and better. I don't know how but I'm not questioning it!!!
The  more we talk the more I'm finding I enjoy letting him see sides of me MANY don't. Thoughts and emotions I protect behind my self built walls...it's the way I've lived my life for the last few years and the way I like it. 
Ville was the first I opened up to, why? Perhaps because he lives so far away and it just didn't matter...I didn't know a friendship like his could continue but gosh am I grateful for it. When I headed home on Thursday afternoon I couldn't help but think back to the conversations from the night before. It was as though I didn't have to hold myself back from saying anything, I could let my guard down and go beyond the first layer of my thoughts and into the deeper more personal side of things. 
We haven't talked so much since, but of course that's because we both have odd working scedules and don't ever sit on the phone. I can't help myself but wonder ""did I let him in too much?""...it's not that I would ever hide anything from him it's just I've been hurt in the past and close up the deeper side. 
He's been opening up as well, we talk a lot about family and our passion for music. I love how family is so important to him because even though I don't really have one that is how I know my own little one will be in the future. 

A couple of my friends know about this wonderful guy, although very few have met him. Carly said the other night while we were out for dinner and I started talking about him she saw the happiness in me again. She also told me not to mess it up hahaha good friend :) It's all go with the flow and complex if you involve our careers and pasts...but it's nothing I want to run from :)"

"event","Ok...I have a moment. Really I have been here, I check this site a couple times a day when I am around but I just haven't had the time to sit.

Where I last left off...
I met up with Scott who had some Aussie friends in town, I met them at Vibes and hung out a lil bit. We all desided to meet up again the next night at Toyko Lounge then later move over to the Red Room. Freaking GOOD TIMES!!! Bradley and Brett were awesome, but then again I don't think I've met an Aussie I don't like. Bradley and I got along well, I miss him a tad now. We all ended up at Scott's place partying until the late morning when Brad and I headed back to the hotel for some rest. We slept a bit but our bodies were still awake, I hate trying to sleep like that. We took a jot out to my place to pick up more clothes and he wanted some BC Salmon. We hung out that night again and I spent the night at the hotel before going to work monday morning. That was a great weekend, although it was about a month ago I remember it well :)

Rod was on tour, it went very well. He went into the studio as well and everything is official, he is lead vocals for the Danny S. Band!!! new website coming up soon but there are some new demos and pics on there www.rockandrollkid.com

I was house sitting for my boss for 10 days, I got SUPER sick and have spent 3 weeks fighting it. Living out in the boonies of Langley was alright, I kept to myself mostly and Rod came to visit me a few nights. It was great...cracked some wine and talked, listened to music and had some good ol' alone time. 

I've been meeting A LOT of great people lately. It seems that artists that I used to work with in the past are spreading my name around as well...I keep getting emails from others wondering what I'm able to do and just networking away :) I'm enjoying that greatly. 

I went to Victoria last Wed and Seattle last Sat with Darude/Ville...GREAT time. It was nice to be able to spend some time alone with him and talk, seems like it's been a while since we've done that. I guess it has, close to a year.

I'm running a lil late for work but seeing as I have tomorrow off I'm sure I can swing back here and update more. I'm shocked people actually do read what's going on here. I promise it will get more interesting. 

huge news I dont want to wait and spill... KARL WOLF's ALBUM IS DONE!!! He's in LA writing/producing right now. Huge talks and offers coming in, shopping the album all over right now and it's amazing who's hearing it. The buzz has started...his site has been updated a lil and we're working on some wicked stuff for it. Lemme know what u think

""Westlife - Flying Without Wings""

For some reason I thought...what if something were to happen to me, would anyone know how I'd like my final farewell to be? Would they know how to contact a few very important people in my life that only I know how to get in contact with? (Strange but some of my most fondest friends are the hardest to reach and have to be reached in strange ways) Would they know what I want done with my body, my presious belongings I want with me? 
Would they know how important a few songs are to me that I would want them played? That's what got me thinking...music is SO important to me...how could some random songs be played at my final shabang? I don't want Amazing Grace streaming threw on bag pipes (although I love that, it can't be done for me) electric guitar...Steve Vai style. I couldn't have some sappy sad songs as people entered...I'd need ""Calm Before The Storm"" by Darude...because believe me once I am outta here the storm will really begin! 

Makes me wonder what (who knows if it would be my parents or someone else) someone would do if I left nothing written. Even though I did write my will at age 13 life just isn't the same anymore...maybe I'll type something out and lock it in the safe. 
This isn't really a downer thought...it's reality. I've left my mark on this world doing so many other things there is no way I am not saying goodbye my way :)"

As I sat here talking to Karl, hearing about how his album only has one more song that needs to be mastered, the insert is done and it's almost press time I couldn't help but think back to my earlier entry today. Ok so Karl Wolf is releasing the album!!! WHOA...this is something we've been waiting for, he's been working so hard on it and I have to admit even if I wasn't working with him I'd be a huge fan. Already have the first single picked, get his name out there...then the second single is gonna come out with a BANG!!! I am in love with so many of his songs but the second single is gonna catch everyone off guard. I have NO doubt it will be huge. Everything is going to be mastered before next monday, I can't believe I am going to have the copy of the album in my hand so soon...I WILL CRY!

Darude's album is also coming out soon, I'm really trying to book him for a show in Vancouver. He will be in Seattle again next month but a Friday night in Van is what I want. I set that as one of my goals a lil while ago and really want it to work out. After speaking to someone on the weekend I know it will, it's just a matter of when. I'm gonna help with some of the promo on the album as well, I feel that his last one didn't get nearly if any promotions at all. I mean so many people don't even know he released one in 2003!!! DaArmy will be a side project of mine, I couldn't be happier to give him a lil help. 

Rod also just called, he leaves for Colorado on wed!!! YES this Wednesday!!! I believe he's gone for 10 days, not sure how long he'll be back for after that but then he mentioned he'll be heading to NY for the Tonight Show or something *gasp* WHOA!!! I couldn't be more happy for him, he's worked hard and seeing him on stage with Danny and the rest of the band last night worked so well. They had only had 2 practices before their first show and it seems so natural on stage, would have thought they had been playing together for a long time. Part of me actually thinks I am gonna miss him a lil, although our phone calls are short it's nice to hear a ""hi, how was your day?"" or ""You have tomorrow off why don't you come over and watch a movie?"". At times I'll try and tell myself I don't like him...well not really ""don't like"" but not like him much more than a friend. Then I'll show up at his place, he'll come to the door to get me and I'll feel that great comfort feeling I do get around him. The last time I was at his place and we were laying around kissin' I litterly had to pull back...he took my breath away!!! I couldn't breathe, whoa I never knew that could actually happen...I laughed thinking about the song. 

My life revolves around music, always has...always will. There's nothing I can do to change that, I believe it's what I was born to do. It's what makes me happiest, it's what keeps me going strong and keeps my head on my shoulders. It's also what drives me crazy, keeps me overly busy but something I will never ever give up on."

I'm so involved in my work and even though I do take time for myself I wonder if it's enough? The other day I went to the mall, I said I'd be there for under an hour...I'm not a big mall rat, in - out and done. I ended up wondering around for almost 3 hours!!!

It's nice going over there, laying on the bed with my head often on his chest or tummy just watching a movie and forgetting about the rest of the world. I love how we are both ""go with the flow""...I won't deny that I do have feelings for him but they are also not something I think about much. It's nothing we talk about, it just IS what it IS :)
I got there around 1am, didn't want to drive or I'd have to leave before 6am *yuck* it was a great feeling being able to sleep in a lil although I tossed and turned, so not used to sleeping after 6:30am. I met up with my old bestfriend from when I was with my ex...Christina and I had lunch. I caught her up on the ""life of amber"" and she did the same. It's amazing how we can go for so long without seeing eachother but it's as though our friendship has never changed. 
A fast coffee with Neal and hopped on the skytrain home around 2pm. I went down to the mall, whoa sales!!! I bought a couple cute shirts, sexy tank tops (gosh I love spring, bring on the tanks!!!) and a cute lil skirt. I was shocked that the skirt was a lil big on me and only size 3...but it was the last one left and buying that allowed me to get a hoodie FREE! Yes I left a happy shopped. I'd like to know when I could fit into a small at off the wall though...or x-small in some other stores. I am so confused. I have put on a bit, I had to...I'm mushy now but healthier. TONE TIME, my mind is back to where it was, without all the over obsessed diet craze going on. I'll look great this summer :) 

I can't wait for this weekend, actually for tomorrow. Rod is on the radio at 8am, damn I hope I can catch it!!! Rock101 I think...
Everyone is meeting at my coffee shop tonight to sit on the patio, kinda feels like it's some vigal or something. The coffee shop is DEAD, although being rebuilt...everyone misses it. I guess I better go show my face."

"event","Make way for Tuesday!!! I was shocked at how fast the day went. Being the last day of the month phones were very busy at work, people don't realise they need to book appointments BEFORE the day they want them. Of course all the inbound calls messes up my %ing, but oh well...nothing I can do about it at atleast the managers know as well. 

I'm excited for the weekend already!!! Rod has two shows *details posted below* I hope a lot of my friends come out to these, would mean a lot to me. He's great, I've been so impressed with the songs I've heard so far...super glad that he's still doing a couple of the songs he did with The Burn Project. 
Lets just hope this week goes fast...staff meeting tomorrow but atleast we get sushi :)

"event","Last friday I indeed went to Ozone, was a great time! Got back to Steve's place and called Rod, Steve was a dear and ended up driving me out to his place around 3am :) 
Saturday: Jesse and I went to see Tall Paul, he was impressive. We met up with Harris (guy from the UK) before hand and hung out the whole night. Jesse wasn't having a good time so left early, I ended up staying out with Harris the whole night...it was fun. I was hella over tired though!!! Atleast I got my Paul Frank DJ purse signed by Tall Paul at the end of the night.

I came home late sunday afternoon, mom said ""meet me at the store I'll give u a ride home"" I thought that was strange, normally I ask her to pick me up there. I walked to the store from the bus and noticed a window boarded up...and then another one...got in view of the front door and noticed people carrying stuff out. I walked inside and saw mom standing there, the stench of smoke hit me hard ""what the fuck happened?"" I was shocked, my store, the family coffee shop...the place I am so proud of was set on fire!!! I've gone over it a million times and right now I don't feel like going over the details again. 
Shock is over, it's anger and hate I feel now...pretty much having a 100% idea on who did it is the worst part. Insurance is good, but our law doesn't always do enough in my eyes.

Monday Steve and I went down to Roxy, worlds largest jager bomb drop... 400 to be exact, was pretty rad! On Wed I went down to see Rod, was actually really nice to see him after the start of the week I had. Just watched a movie and slept for a while.

My work week was slack, one of the girls got fired...I have a lot of hours now *shrugs* lets hope I can keep up with my music/promo stuff or I'm gonna have to figure somethings out. My %'s were pretty high this week, I guess I am not too bad at this phone stuff. 

This friday Steve and I did the Ozone thing again, I realised how much I needed to release tension. I was outside on the phone and started balling my eyes out. I don't normally do this, I was being a ""dumb over emotional girl"". I will admit I was kinda drunk and that didn't help anything...I was really worried that the conversation I had would have changed things with the person. He said to call him when I got home, I left the club right away and called...talked for a few mins but that was it. I needed to leave the house, I went over to a friends place but on the way there I called the other person to say sorry. He said there was no need to be sorry, I still felt awful though.

Didn't sleep at all and went straight to work Saturday morning, was a slow day and I have A LOT on my mind. I wanted to phone and say sorry again but knew I had said enough. I just left it. Twisted my knee after work and am now on crutches for a couple days...went to sleep most of Sat evening...just wanted to sleep everything away, not that I could do much :(

Today I still haven't been able to do much...was about to go lay down when my phone rang. It was the person I talked to on Friday night!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Lets just say I had a good laugh for being worried, guess when my emotions get the best of me it scared/worried me more than it should have. I worry what others think, I let my guard down friday night and let someone see/hear sides of me VERY few do. I didn't know how he would react after...ALL IS GOOD THO :) I love my friends :)"

Found out a couple of my friends at now part owners of the Ozone, this could mean trouble!!! Trouble in a good way though. I ran into them while out for dinner with Steve the other night, looks like I'm gonna have to pop in there soon. Rod's still doing family stuff this weekend as his mom is in town so Steve and I were thinking about hitting up the ol'Hoe for some drinks. 
Jesse called last night again to ask when the next party was...guess he wants to get away from wifey for the night *shrugs* I told him Tall Paul is playing at Plush on Saturday and he said he'd buy my ticket if I wanted to go. I really do want to go, I have a feeling I'll stay the night downtown if I end up hitting the gig first.

Well time to start another day...I hope the rain holds off."

"event","Headed down to Roxy last night to catch Doug's band, I was impressed. He rocked the show, will deff go check them out again. Rod was there doing his thing for XtremeTV as well as a bunch of the people I met the weekend of his birthday show. I headed down there with Steve and met with Crystal. It was a woot when a couple Ontario guys started saying ""Open bar for you ladies""...had a few drinks and then Crystal was gonna head home. I was left to fend for myself, it was obvious I wasn't interested in these guys, I turned down the drinks a number of times and made it clear I was leaving with my friends. Just as Crystal left Rod asked if I wanted to come over after...we raced to call Crystal so Steve could catch a ride home with her. I was happy, plus I didn't want her to drive home alone :(
We hung out at the club a lil longer, danced to a couple songs then headed back to his place. Good times as always!!! I'm feeling pretty good about it all, last night was the first night I'd been out at the same place as him. I am not one of those girls that needs to be side by side with the guy she's interested in...it was nice when he would come by the table and chill for a bit. We're both there for our reasons but left together...works for me :)
I mentinoed something to him last night because I am NOT used to getting close to people, laying there cuddling all night and such and having the feeling of ""yes I do wanna get to know ya"" ...go with the flow :)

Its early...and I'm sick...back to my room I go to lay down and continue some writing."

"event","I had a great time on thursday night, didn't get back home until about 5am. It was nice seeing him again, I'm not sure how he feels or where anything is going but at this point I'm just ""go with da flow yo"". A friend of mine thinks we will end up together, she likes him and just has that feeling when she saw us together. I started talking about that on friday night and it kinda freaked me out. I don't know why...guess I'm freaked about things I'm not overly used to these days. 
I stayed home on friday night and wrote, poured out a lot of emotion on paper...it was a good release. Oddly enough i got a phone call from a guy whom I've gotten very close to. He could tell right away something was wrong, he seems to make things better...nice to know he really cares about me. 

Saturday I had to work, I actually didn't mind. I was pretty much alone most of my shift so it's a nice change of pace. Steve and I made plans to go out but then the snow started. We ran everywhere to find Nepoleon and finally someone let us buy a rental copy...saved money and as good as new!!! Went back to his place, started drinking and ate pizza. Around midnight we desided to hit up a small rave/party. It was his first hahaha Ran into Jeremie and a few others, nice to see everyone!!! Got home around 6am and almost went to Nanaimo to see the crew on Sunday. 

I have a gig to go to at Roxy tonight so thought it would be best if I didnt kill myself over in Nanaimo...i'm sure i would have partied a lot harder than I have been lately and it wouldn't be the right time. Jen and I did hit up the sex show though...good prices and interesting stuff :) 

It was a pretty calm weekend, but I'm glad I did get out to hear some good music...even if I was just chilling there. For some reason I don't like getting all messed up and partying that way. Maybe I am different, but I like the way I do things. More Enjoyable...music IS life!"

Seeing as it's my night off I should be out doing something, although I've been up since 5am and normally would rather just a night at home. I guess he was wondering if I would be crashing at his place if I was drinking downtown, seeing as I did that 2x last weekend maybe it would have been a great idea!!!
I said I wasn't partying, damn I'm too old hahaha 
But now I'm heading to his house as soon as mom gets the car back here, I pretty much had to beg for it hahaha she hates me driving in this cold icey weather and downtown *shrugs* OH WELL :D

"event","For some reason this week has gone rather fast. I'm happy about getting tomorrow off however must go in for 4 hours on Saturday. I don't really have any huge plans for the weekend yet except get caught up on booking work. I've been pretty tired so crashing early, atleast I'm taking better care of myself. As far as I know tomorrow I'm going out with the guy from last weekend :) He's called a couple more times this week, always very short convos but it's cute and makes me smile. Seems as though he just wants to make sure I'm still free on friday. It's strange because I have kinda known him for a while although not really on a personal level and only ran into eachother a handful of times. I'm still really caught off guard by all this and having him call me shocks me...maybe he really IS interested. I don't feel all ""highschool crush"" as I did with Jeremie, I figured out where all that came from. He really was the first guy I allowed myself to like as I was pulling back from Thierry. Don't get me wrong Jer is a wonderful guy but it's not in our cards to be together...not now anyway...and come on I don't plan the future so I don't think about that. I still talk to him and all is cool...heck I'm his booking agent lol it better be cool :)
Still talk to Thierry as well, pretty much everyday...he knows what's going on in my life, says he's happy for me however I know he wouldn't say anything less than that. He would never want to show he overly cares for me, although his friends always tell me I'm the only one he's let into his life like this and for so long, how he acts different around me and all that stuff. MEH whatever...I'm not waiting on anything. I'm SO happy right now and content with my life...it's strange though I think my walls are crumbling...not just for this guy but I've noticed I DO have more feelings for people and DO let them in closer to me. Guess it's a good thing *shrugs*"

"event","I had no idea he looked at me that way!!! I had no idea he wanted to ask me out sometime but didn't know how to!!! We've kinda known eachother a while through his old band, never really see eachother unless I showed up to see a friend that happened to be in the band as well. Haven't seen him since early Oct. The band has since broke up and he's gone solo. He did happen to call about a month ago to let me know about his first solo performance which was on Friday. A couple fast phone calls the day of and prior to the show and I didn't let the snow trap me in Surrey!!!
My friend and I took transit downtown with a mini cake and all, it was also his bday. It was a great evening, a few times I had to turn to my friend to confirm there was some difference in the way he was acting towards me. Honestly I didn't want to read into it too much, I was a tad confused. We sat on the couch watching the last singer and he then invited me back to his place after the club closed as everyone was going back for drinks. 
My friend and I stayed the night, he wanted to sing for me however everyone kinda followed us up to his room. Later on we enjoyed eachother company until we passed out around ohhhhhhh 8am pretty much *lol* 
We left mid-afternoon so I could come home and get ready to head downtown again. He was going to the studio all night but we had planned to meet up after and spend another night together :) He called a couple times during the evening, bonus points!!! MAJOR!!! I went to his house alone Sat night after some drinks at Vibes...grrrrrrrrrrrreat night!
I really enjoy his company, I've always found him interesting and am really glad to be getting to know him. He's older than most of the guys, actually all of the guys I've ever been involved with and I find it a lil more intreging. I know he's pretty busy with work and studio stuff so I was gonna give him a call in a couple days to see what his weekend plans were BUT shortly after 2pm today as I walked outta the office he had called :) He ""wanted"" to tell me he listened to the cd I had left with him but then he asked what my work schedule looked like this week...how freaking cute!!! HAHA He asked if I wanted to do something, well of course!!! It's just kinda hard to go downtown and come home when I wake up at 5am...maybe I'll stay over *shrugs* makes things easy and it's the same amount of time to work...I'll leave that up to him. 

Damn I'm tired now though...staff meeting tomorrow night so I best be getting to bed NOW! I have a feeling I'm gonna have sweet dreams *teehee*"

"event","Well it was an eventful weekend to say the least. Headed down to Seattle on the 6pm ChooChoo train, long ride but wanted something different. Jimmy picked me up at the station with a hug and kiss :) Nice to see him again. Still has those blue eyes I can get lost it *giggles*
We drove around a bit to find a place to have a drink, had a few then went back to his place for an early night. He had to work in the morning so I woke up, did a bit of work, got ready and made my way downtown. We met up for lunch @ the Fox Sports Network, pretty good place...very nice inside and my smoked salmon chowder was great! 
It was a sunny thursday in Sea-Town...Da Crew got in early but needed some nap time. I needed some shopping time :) Didn't really buy much but wanted a few hours of my mini vacation to myself. I wondered all over downtown, it's really not like Vancouver at all. I found people looking oddly at me and commenting (not rudely though) on my hair. I went to Pike Place Market, wondered Pine and shopped in all the stores we don't have in Canada. 
I was in need of some drinks, I wanted to get my party started! I found a net cafe and had a few 5% coolers...need a lot of those to get ya started hahaha I got talking to a couple people on CV Seattle and one of them met me at the hotel for a drink. Always nice to meet new people :) 
I made my way over to Element shortly after to meet up with Ville/Darude, Dan and the rest of them. Kept on drinking and had a great night. Sat and talked a lil biz with Ville which was nice, glad he's giving me the okay to help out in the promo area :) Love how everything is going to be official...it's been five years since Sandstorm came out and sure it's an amazing track but I want people to see him for more than that now! The new album is coming out very soon and I can't wait to help make an impact.

Kinda chilled on friday at the hotel for a while and left after they all went to sound check....YAH we won't get into that, really there was no sound check cause there was no equipment. I met up with Hollie and Heather who had just flown in from Vegas and hung out the 24th floor of their hotel sipping wine and getting ready. Once Joshua and Andy arrived we headed to the venue. 

KAOS!!! Tickets couldn't be found...we got in 15 mins before the countdown. Danced to the end of BT's set as 2005 came in and kissed a few random people ;) Ville and crew stormed passed us, then we were brought into the back. Still no equipment...tension was high and because of other events that happened prior to the day starting I was pretty upset. I was able to give Ville his card/poem, that ment a lot cause I wanted something to start '05 off right. Finally he was gonna go on stage, he was also told he wouldn't be getting paid as the promoter had fucked off...yah that's a situation that is still on going!!! It's not always about the money but come on these artists are doing a job, many people didn't get paid. Got over to the stage and found no mixer...WTF?? Ok why don't u just tell him to play with no electricity as well? *SILENCE* then they hurried to find a mixer. He had the choice to not go on stage, but one look at the crowd and he said ""I have to"" ...CLASS ACT!!!

Great set, some of my faves were played. I mainly watched from behind or on the back of the stage as I smashed my knee at the start of the set, it looks real bad now :( We stayed for a bit of John""00""Flemings set and then headed off. Grabbed out things from the girls hotel and said our byes...drove over to say bye to Ville. We chatted for a bit in the lobby before...this one was kind of a sad goodbye. I knew he was upset, he felt bad even for me coming down there and not being able to see what I wanted. DAMN him, like it was his fault!!! Even with all the shit that happened no one can take away spending NYE with good friends :) 

Joshua, Andy and I drove back and slept a lil on the way...were just far too tired. I was still pretty pissed off and upset about the whole situation and spent most of the next two days monitoring a msg forum that had many reviews. Ville has since come on there and said his side of things, and I know next time in seattle it's gonna be crazier than any other club show we've been there for!!!

I haven't been able to go to work all week either...I had something embedded into my eye ball. Woke up monday morning and it was all red. Got drops, did nothing...went back to the doc the next day and they found out what was wrong. I couldn't see for 2 days, it was not fun...actually scared the shit out of me.I'm on the mend now and going back to work tomorrow."

I am heading down to seattle on the train right after work today. I am OH SO excited!!! Not sure when I will come back, either Saturday or Sunday...but it will not be any time this year ;)

2004 was a whirlwind forsure...but I'd say it was the best year of my life. Most importantly I learned to love and believe in myself, I know I did that on my own however a few guiding words from Ville helped as well. Makes me all the more excited to be spending the last days of 2004 with him and the crew and bringing in 2005 on a high note!!!

I walked there, I swam there I enjoyed their culture...I know many of those buildings could not have survived a quake, exspecially one of that size...not to mention the waves after. 
I started reading more of the news on CNN later in the day and I couldn't help but shed a tear. Thierry was being an insensitive heartless asshole about it as well. I gave him the link to read it and he just brushed it off. I thought maybe he would care a little bit as we were both there. I don't expect him to sit there and be upset or anything but damnit have a bit of a heart. I'm mad at him right now, or maybe a lil disipointed, I don't even want to talk to him. 

I went to the mall yesterday around 3pm, what a JOKE!!! I know boxing day is busy but this was beyond busy, I will go back this morning as soon as the doors open :) I hung out with Danny for the first time last night as well, went to his place and chilled for a bit. We ordered chinese and watched 'Almost Famous'...when I was getting into my writing everyone said I reminded them of that kid hahaha kinda true. I'm so much about the music these days and will do anything to make sure that the artists TRUE words are heard by the public. 
Started on Darudes ""Da Army"" promo team...will get a proposal drawn up with a bunch of ideas and give it to him on thursday. 

well off to the mall I go...

"event","I've tried and tried to get into the christmas spirit but it just isn't happening. I hate hearing people bitch about having family gatherings...I don't know what it's like to have one. I don't care if Aunt so and so is pestering when I'd finally be getting hitched or if Uncle so and so got so drunk he's making rude remarks to everyone around. 
I want to experiance it!!! People have invited me in the past but honestly it's not the same...this is something that I have to live with until either I have a family of my own OR marry into a big ol' family. I told mom that's why I was feeling the christmas blues, she doesn't think it's a big deal...maybe because she DID have those family gatherings when she was young. So did dad, they don't know what it's like to be an only child. 

I just feel as though I'm waiting for Christmas to be over, although I am a lil excited for tomorrow morning. I couldn't find much for my parents so I got them a couple lil things and will make a card saying I'll take them out for brunch and a movie in Jan :) A family day...

I can't believe I'm thinking this but last night as I laid in bed I was wondering what it would be like to have a boyfriend again LOL Yes an official boyfriend, not someone I'm seeing, not someone who lives miles and miles away. I wonder but do I want right now? hmmmm"

"event","I look back at old pictures and notice there is a huge change in me. YES I am happy now but I'm human and at times there are downs. Sure I can cover up those downtimes pretty damn good, used to doing so my whole life...but sometimes I just need a release. 
Saturday night was one of those times...I actually MISSED people...I missed my friends that I know I'll be seeing very soon. I cried, not just lil tears either...uncontrolable sobs of weakness. I felt better in the morning and kinda giggled at what started the tears. My name came up in a conversation between two people whom I never get to see, I didn't know they both had known they knew me...parts of the conversation were in my email when i came home drunk and it was some of the sweetest stuff ever LOL Guess I just realised how much this one person does care hahaha *awwwwwwwww*

Last night had the girls over from Esquires for gift exchange, drinks and food. YES the dreaded food!!! Everyone says ""It's christmas eat who cares!"" Ok I DO eat, I may have strange eatting habits but I do know my body more than anyone else and know what I have to do to keep healthy. I stayed at 110 for months...dropped to 105 and even questioned myself. After a bit I dropped to 103...that's when I started seeing there might be more of a problem again. I am now sitting around 107 and hating it!!! FUCKING HATING IT! Last night it was a battle forsure. I don't think many can understand this...and the only reason why I am writing it here is because I need to release these words. 

I wasn't feeling well so went upstairs while the girls still chatted, I looked in the mirror and really didn't like what I saw. I wanted to throw up everything I had eatten. I didn't care how bad that was and how I said I would never do that again...but I over ate and felt gross. I thought about the 2 people who have not been afraid to talk to me about this...one mentioned it last March. Ville, he hardly sees me so when he does he notices differences. He was actually the first to bring it up to me ever...said he was worried. OH NO don't tell me that, i dont want people worrying about me. That sat with me for a while and at times when I get to a low point like last night I think about that conversation. 
So last night hovering over the can wanting to get rid of everything I ate, I thought ahead to NYE and knew I couldn't look him in the eyes and tell him I was ""a'ok"" if I was going to make myself puke right then. I was tired but not tired enough to sleep...I popped a sleeping pill and laid down. 

I think this whole battle thing plays on me being a gemini as well. At times I'll see there is a problem...like last night...but later I'll use it to my advantage and push me to meet my goals and not become that person I used to be. 

Now it's off to the mall...haven't started my shopping yet but only buying for mom and dad. A couple small things for others will have to come after seattle. I'd like to get something for Ville as well but that's a hard one!!! It will have to be one of those gifts u walk by and KNOW it's for the person."

I dyed my hair this crazy ass red color.  I considered making the carpets match the drapes just cuz that would be cool, but I was worried that I might hurt myself.  

I got some unwanted attention at a bar Friday night, but my cousin told the guys that she and I were together, so that got rid of them...kind of.

Also, you know that your career in alcoholism has ended when you discover that a mere two Michelob Ultra Lights gives you a hangover even after you eat at Shari's.  That sucks.

It was good to see you the other night, Dougie.  Let's hang out more often.  How about the Rogue this Thursday, say around 10?"

I'm working on my literary treasure hunt right now.  It's coming along nicely.  Even though it may very well be the biggest pain in the ass of my life!  

I had a good weekend.  The girlfriend came to see me, and we had fun.  

I miss you bellinghammers, and it makes me feel loved when you call me at one in the morning even if I don't pick up the phone.  

Kelly, I'm going to call you soon, and we are going to have an in depth convo.  Yeah.  Thanks for the drunk message by the way.  I would have answered the phone, but I was........busy."

School sucks, I want to drop out or change programs.
Living alone is cool, I get to walk around naked and shower with the door open.
Being able to mooch off of my parents is awesome.
Hearing about my cousin's constant disfunctional sexcapades gets old.
Missing my Bellingham friends is no fun.

So apparently I'm missing like two credits and I didn't get my bachelor's degree.  Doesn't that suck?  All that fuss, and it looks like I'll have to go take a stupid two credit class for my diploma.  Can you believe it?   Well don't because I'm lying! lies, lies, lies.  

So is it wrong that I'm disappointed in G Love and the Special Sauce for doing a coke comercial?  I'm sorry but it seems a little sell outish.  I liked that they weren't totally mainstream.  Maybe I just expect too much, but probably not. Like I would ever expect too much.

The wedding this Saturday will be nice, but my participation will have nothing to do with the niceness.  Let's put it this way:  Me in that dress is a lot like fat man in little coat (Translation- Chris Farley in David Spade's jacket for those who have not seen tommy boy).  I mean, it's not the most hideous thing ever, but it's probably pretty gosh darn close.  And the worst part is the bride refuses to let me leave my car running at the side of the house during the ceremony in case she changes her mind.  I mean, I'm trying to cover her ass, and she spits in my eye!  Whats with that?  Bunch o' crap if you ask me.  

So I understand two of my buddies have birthdays rapidly approaching, and The P has not forgotten.  So watch your backs, suckas!  I might be giving you birthday spankings! Oh YEAH!

"event","Okay, I got like no sleep last night.  First off, as soon as I began drifting off into blissful slumber, my cell phone goes off.  It was my neighbor Kelly.  I thought she might have something important to say because of some events that occurred earlier, so I thought I'd better pick up.  Then she slapped me in the face with a moral dilemma:  To leave the porn, or not to leave the porn.  It was so hard, (I mean the decision you sickos!)  but ultimately my roommate and I decided to take the high road.  Which was a little difficult considering that we'd started out on the lowest road possible!  Hehehe, oh well, I haven't laughed that hard in a long time.  VIVA LA RETALIATION!

And I'm excited about tomorrow night, July and I get to corrupt another unsuspecting soul.  Let's just say that the night better have these two events: Erin double fisting it, and Erin getting the double X's.  I'm also keeping my fingers crossed that she will make out with at least three random guys.  But Shhhh, don't tell her that.  She may resist, and I planned on making some money off of her.  

...Anyways...I've been quoted in this week's edition of the A.S. Review, in the article about the movie Kinsey. I pretty much sound like the most intelligent person that has ever lived.  You'll want to check it out, for your own good.  

I think I may have changed my mind about being a buddhist.  After reading Julian of Norwich, I'm seriously considering becoming and anchoress.  You know, shutting myself in a small, dark room for the rest of my life praying and writing stuff down.  I really think it is my calling.  Plus, it's not like I have anything better to do.  I mean, let's be honest.

8. Your Alias infatuation
7. Your tendency to get hammered and smack my ass
6. Your habit of molesting my bed
5. The great deals you give me for ""moisture"" on discount
4. The Christmas present your mom bought me
3. The fact that you attended the Sara Mclachlan concert with me and we slept together that night (Even though we didn't ""sleep together"" in the sexual sense, you still tried to feel me up in the middle of the night.  And you thought I was asleep!)
2. The difficulty you have with bending over and touching your toes.

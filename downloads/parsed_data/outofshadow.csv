First just by the mere fact that we get along (since we didn't used to) and the smile that stuck on my face for hours after he lingered by my car that day at Metrotown...then by his note that he liked me...then realizing how strangely similar we are, yet different...and now by our crazy chats and emails. Despite the fact that he still has the ability to completely tick me off, I am feeling myself drawn into his world, and I like it. Huh."

"event","The clouds have parted, the sun shines bright and warmly. All ends have been dead so far, but I have this odd sense of peace. I feel content, and yet restless in the unknowing. I write steadily, I pray, I enjoy fellowship with my two best friends...and I wait. I wait in this necessary dark wondering when and if I will know what's to come before it arrives. I'm beginning, though, to wonder why I fret over seeing, when this odd sense of unseeing seems to have triggered peace, hope, perseverence, and desire. If I knew, would I not be impatient? Would I not miss the journey's wake out of longing for its end? I would. I would miss. Therefore I embrace this blindness openly, as I wrap myself up in this cloak of waiting. I feel all other senses awaken as I breathe in the necessity of unknowing, and open my eyes to the blinding light."

"event","It is a strange place to be. I feel the current of time, destiny, belief, love washing over me quickly, then slowly, then quickly...a river and a tide. So often I can't decipher what I feel. I know only that I do feel and I feel immensely. I am home. Here in this city of blinding lights, dirt, sin, etc...in a place where there's nothing to call my own. My heart tells me I am home. 

My heart told me I was in love, that he was the one...despite argument and circumstance I wanted him. I wanted it all...his kids, our house, Rome. And I had it, I had him...but the tide reached out and grasped him, tugging him back into the grand sea. Now he is not mine. Now I have only myself. My heart was sad, it told me all kinds of lies about the inconsistency of God, and self, and men, and dreams. I feared. I hated. I cried. But then...my heart told me it was okay. My heart said 'love is love'...he was one, but not the. He was the first. So let go now. 

My heart saw and I believe.

Therefore...in all things I must trust my heart, to lead and guide where the river flows, and to know that at any point something may be snatched from me...but that's okay. My heart knows because it is linked to God's heart. It cannot betray me if I listen to it's pangs. 

My desire, my greatest desire is not love of man, but love of (and for) God. The one thing that brings me to gut-wrenching tears even more than those I wept for loss of love...is my dream. The grand story that haunts me more than anything else. The story that lives in my heart. 

Therefore, I know...I will not fail. I cannot. Whether I stay here in my 'home' where I am homeless, or take another journey elsewhere. Someday it will be. It has to because it is written on the one place that can never wash away: my heart. So long as it beats, I will dream and I will fight for the realization of my dream. I have to because you can never escape your heart and live to tell the tale."

My biggest fear is failure and fear is the biggest contributor to failure that I know. You will inevitably fail if you do not step out the door and try to succeed. Here I am. I want to succeed. I am in this town of people, many not so nice as me trying also to succeed at their dream and I feel very small and silly and Canadian. BUT...I do know that I am supposed to be here right now. I just need to convince myself to stop the mantra of disbelief and replace it always, constantly with ""I will"" not ""if""...I can move...I must. Why else did I fly the miles down here but to move and move confidently. I know I have talent...but what I need now is persistence or luck...Lord the luck part is where you come in. Although then I guess it's not luck. Then it's divine providence. Oh help. He does. All the time...if I really knew how often I'd probably feel like a puppet but a very loved one. I'm rambling. Yes. I am here. Still here, breathing and awake and battling my demons and soon battling quite simply and insanely, Hollywood. Unbar the door!!!!!!!!!!"

Meeting someone once, waiting two years, meeting them again and realizing this person you once really disliked, is now...intriguing, even nice, someone who's brain you'd like to explore a bit...even if they do talk on for hours without taking a breather for you to comment, really. Hmm.

What's also interesting is waking up one day and realizing you've spent all this time convincing yourself that you're not desirable to anyone and then realizing, hey you ARE likeable and desirable. Imagine that!

<b>Lyrics to ""If I Believed"" by Jeni Varnadeau</b> 

<i>There's a place in the night where it's just you and me
There's no where to go but here with my dreams
The shadows close in, the doubts start to flow
There's nowhere to look but deep in my soul
You are whispering secrets I'm longing to hear
I want to receive it but I cannot get near
Can I really let go or am I holding on to fear?

If I believed with a holy passion
I'd throw hesitation to the wind
If I would love you with abandon
My trust in you would never end
If I believed, If I believed, If I believed

Lord, hear my prayer, show me what to do
I want to be closer and closer to you
I try to move forward but I'm stuck in my tracks
I long for the day when I'm not holding back
What should I keep? What should I lose?
Give me the wisdom to know what to choose
Whatever You want, Lord, that's what I want to do

I believe, help me with my unbelief
I believe, help me with my unbelief
Help me believe
But if I really believed every word You've spoken
Surrendered my little hopes and dreams
If I believed I can't imagine
Just what my life would really mean
If I really believed with reckless passion
I would live so differently
I would have no hesitation
In giving you every part of me
If I believed, If I believed, If I believed..."

A little child with dreams of being a woman, warrior, leader, light. Lord I need your help. I need your power to give me the strength and courage to break through this glass cage. I need you to come in here and re-shape my crooked heart. I want so much and I am my worst enemy. Lord, help. Please. I pray this next year you will use me as never before, that the power I felt pulse through me the other week would be something I could feel every day, even when things go wrong. Even when I am blind, deaf, dumb to the world, the future, you and myself. Let me feel you. Let me trust you, trust me. God I can't do this. I am tired of this. Let me break through, really truly. I don't want to just be a dreamer. I want to believe. I want to make a difference and see my dreams come through and be happy with the uncinematic, crazy way that they do. Please...help me be better. I give this year to you."

"event","I had one of my panic days. I made good progress on some stuff, but also had this freak out of ""what the heck am I doing with my self?"" I hate being a dissapointment, making people angry, etc. But it's been so long since I actually listened to the still small voice. I've spent so much time trying to do the 'right' thing so that people will like me instead of the really right thing that God wants for me.

I know I make mistakes and I will keep making mistakes. I just hate when those mistakes cause people I love to be hurt or angry. I have no answer for how to mend things. Maybe I should be more reasonable and practical...but I'm so afraid of giving up my dreams, or worse - myself, for someone. To please someone. I just hate that I let go of a commitment, even if it was something where there was somewhat of a get out of jail free card attached, sorta. Even if I did discover that my reasons for running in the past had been about fear, not just running, and that sometimes walking away is necessary. I'm just sorry that my friend is suffering. And now I am making a leap somewhere different, somewhere where it doesn't make much sense. Following my heart even if my heart betrays me. Except I know that my heart knows my dreams...so how can it ever really betray? Gah! 

I'm just sorry. This has been a torrential time, this Christmas. So much has happened in one month. I knew this particular storm would come. In fact, I was expecting it sooner, but right now I want to make things better and I can't without sacrificing the decision I already made, which inspite of everything I still feel was the right one. I guess we just have to ride the wave and see what's to come. It's not like I could ever offer more than myself and all my flaws...whether or not this particular situation arose. Something like it would have come. We all dissapoint eachother at times. It just sucks. Being human is bizarre. God what on earth were you thinking??!!

Breathe in. Breathe out..."

"event","What is it about me and heroes? I want to be one...this summer I got obsessed with Joss Whedon's 'Fray' comics, and I had strips on my desktop all the time. Then I kinda got out of that. I think my inner heroine got a little quashed for a bit there. But she's suddenly returned! And she's stronger than ever! It's very cool. I wonder if there'll ever be a time in my life when I'll be able to be fully me, fully this hero-type-self, AND in good loving relationship with a guy. Hmm. I hope so. Part of it I know is going with my gut, believing what's true and pushing the lies aside without giving them a second glance. Must hold on to the truth...to what's been promised me and what's to come though I cannot predict how, it will be whatever it will, whenever it wants.

<b>Time for Flight</b>

These wings have weighed 
too long on my back
(heavy, guarded, and unclean)
patiently waiting their freedom 
while I've wrestled, fought, and prayed for mine. 
Tonight the silence broods.
My flesh aches,
as these tears I have wept now flow
and the wind in my spirit blows 
The feathers rustle under my cloak
causing the hair on my neck to stand.
An earthquake begins beneath and inside
I dive for cover but there's nowhere to hide.
I wait.
I pray for the tremors to cease.
They are relentless,
and something tells me to stand.
The dirt cracks and falls off
hitting the ground with an enormous thud.
My breath caught I quiver, 
now cold from the ceaseless wind
but as I try to move I feel my wings
They have lost their patient weight.
They move. 
'Help!' I yell,
but there's no one to hear,
not one but a man I did not see
sitting, watching quietly near.
He stands, approaches.
I turn away.
'What's wrong?' He asks.
I do not speak.
He gazes at me with wide kind eyes.
With one hand he lifts my chin and
our eyes meet. 
'Do not fear.' The man says
'I know your pain.'
I can't help it, I stare.
'It will cease.'
I don't believe him.
I tear away.
How can this be? 
Who is he to tell me such things?
And yet...he seems honest.
I turn back and
he kisses me.
My wings burst free.
The skin tears.
I bleed. 
It's agonizing.
I stumble toward the man
and he catches me
'It hurts' I say.
He smiles,
'It does,' he says simply,
gives one last kiss
then takes his leave.
I stand silent,
broken and whole,
my newly sprung wings flapping in the night.
I spin, I twirl, I dance.
Each movement more crisp,
'til I am strong.
I run to the edge. 
I leap.
It is time, after all
for me to master flight."

"event","What whispers in the dark, in the silence where there waits a glint of hope and light. If not belief? What then? Just silence, just darkness and grey? I cannot imagine a world without belief, a world without magic. 

My father is a man who has little hope, and no belief, or at least no trace that is visible. I cannot imagine living life like that. What of the heart, its dreams, it's passions if there is nothing but this plane of existence? First of all, how boring, then mundane, then...how sad!

I know that I am a woman who needs, and thrives on, my passions and dreams, and therefore though at times I stumble into places that are less than good for me, sometimes out right bad, I have very few regrets. My heart recently has been broken and repaired, twisted, turned, and renewed. Every step of the journey seems to echo this longing for more. I do worry sometimes that I will never be able to 'settle down' because I'll be restlessly searching for more and better and new...but then I think, no. Not when it's right. Not when my heart finds its match. But it's true. I am constantly searching to better myself. I don't want the basic, I want the best...of me, of my love, of my Lord. I want it all, I really do. 

I'm going to LA in January. It's been a year since I was there. It's a wierd thing, walking those streets and gazing up at the few visible stars and smiling there. When I left, I cried. I never cry over places but I cried when I left LA listening to 'May It Be' from Fellowship of the Ring, and I loathed this city where I grew up. I wanted to leave. And yet I asked the Lord to find me a church and he did. Not long thereafter I worked on a play, had my first standing ovation, fell in love, stage managed a different play, and finished a feature film that's being shopped around Hollywood. And that's just the nutshell. Good things have happened, are happening, will happen. So now I'm returning to LA in just a few weeks. It's all very cyclical. I keep hearing in my head this line from season 3 (I think) of X-Files ""come full circle to find the truth"". Hmm. 

I have no idea where anything is leading, but I do know, as they said in the <i>Polar Express</i> film, that what's most important is 'choosing to get on the train'. The funny thing is I know my Dad wouldn't. This makes me sad, and thankful that my mother is a woman of dreams and that I got those genes above and beyond the others.

We, all human beings--beautiful souls-- are dancing on the edge of a platform waiting for our next time to fall, praying we won't. Even the iniquitous ones have brief moments where they tap into the possibility of staying on top.  Some fall too often, some stay down. But, most of us are hoping beyond all hope that our plastic costume wings will be transformed into the real thing. So that when we pray and seek direction from the ultimate Creator, we may fall less often, and instead, perhaps one day...fly.

God, I want to fly!

Today is a day to reflect. Maybe it's because I didn't get much sleep last night...maybe it's because I have nothing specific to do and the sun is shining and I'm listening to Caedmon's Call...nonetheless I am reflecting.

"event","I've become very fascinated by Celtic Christianity lately. I bought a new Bible, English Standard Version. It's green leatherbound with a celtic cross design on the cover. I love it. I started to wonder, why on earth am I feeling so drawn to my Celtic roots, and what does this have to do with my faith?

Well, let's start here, according to one website:

""Celtic Christianity was characterised by extreme holiness, a love of God and man, and wanderlust from the need to bring the light of Christ to the world. Also, many of the issues that the Celtic Christians dealt with are amazingly contemporary - things like the position of women in the Church, nature and our environmental surroundings, and dealing with others of different customs and beliefs (both pagan and Christian). Much of its attraction comes from how it dealt with these problems, taking the best from older traditions while still standing firm in the truth.""

Then I found this essay...which includes stuff about Lord of the Rings (yay!). This comes from <a href=""http://www.heartoscotland.com/Categories/CelticChristianity.htm"">Heart of Scotland.com</a> 

----------

<b>""My Druid is Christ, the son of God...""</b>
St. Columba

Celtic christianity and spirituality are irrevocably bound to the early Celtic Christian saints of Ireland and Scotland. 

I looked up the word ""peregrine"" in my handy Webster's Collegiate, since the Irish evangelist monks referred to themselves as ""Peregrinari Pro Christ"" (pilgrims for Christ). The meaning was short and sweet: ""having a tendency to wander.""

My mind then wandered through various notions about journeying and the word peregrine (I always think of soaring falcons), but soon landed on a much more prosaic Peregrine, better known as ""Pippin"" Took, companion of Frodo Baggins on his journey to destroy the Ring.

Now Frodo did not want to leave his home; the Shire was green, the ale was strong, the food was plenteous, and to sit by the fire, reading and studying, made for a very pleasant life. But he had to go. Just as St. Patrick was called to return to the place of his slavery, St. Ninian called to evangelize the Scots of Galloway, and St. Brendan called to cast off in his small boat and end up in Iceland bringing the light of Christ to the Norse. St. Columba, too, was forced to move by evil circumstance, leaving the monasteries he had established in northern Ireland for a rocky, yew-covered isle we call Iona.

The Celtic monks called their peregrinations the ""White Martyrdom"". White, because their blood was not shed (though that could and did happen), and martyrdom, because they had to leave their beloved home. Their belief was that the spiritual journey of our lives demands both outward and inward wandering, often not knowing where God will lead. The Celts had wandered all across Europe before landing on its western fringes. They knew what it meant to pick up your feet and go. It is said that St. Aidan progressed around his diocese on foot, never on horseback except in case of emergency. When you travel afoot, you see the land, the sky, the water, and the people. 

Knowing the dangers that awaited, Frodo had planned to travel alone. But that is not the Celtic way, for we are not meant to travel alone but in companionship and in community. Everyone requires a special friend, what the Irish and Scots called a ""soul friend"" or anam cara, to help us in our spiritual journey. In ancient times, it was not necessary or even usual for the anam cara to be a priest or someone ""more spiritual"" than oneself. Rather, this was a relationship in which spiritual insights, growth, and difficulties were shared with honesty and good advice both taken and given. Sometimes, a soul friend is required to take harsh action to keep us on the true path. We know what Sam Gamgee endured for Frodo and we know the pain it caused him. We also know what he ultimately gained. St. Brigid reputedly said, ""a person without a soul friend is like a body without a head.""

Since the ties of kinship and community are very strong among the Gaels, not much happens in their close-knit agricultural communities that is not seen (and commented upon!) by other eyes. When someone's in trouble or needs help, family is right there. Frodo and Sam are soon joined by cousins, Pippin and Merry. And what an apt name Merry is! For Celtic Christians are no prigs, and felt the pleasures the good Lord has given to us should be enjoyed freely and often. Here is a great sentiment attributed to St. Brigid that well expresses the Gaelic view of God's provision:


I would like to have the men of Heaven in my own house:
With vats of good cheer laid out for them.
I would like to have the three Marys, their fame is so great.
I would like people from every corner of Heaven.
I would like them to be cheerful in their drinking,
I would like to have Jesus too here amongst them.
I would like a great lake of beer for the King of Kings,
I would like to be watching Heaven's family, drinking it through all eternity.


Eventually, Frodo and Sam are joined in their fellowship by seven companions, making nine in all. Each of them highlights in their own ways the best (and sometimes worst) of Celtic culture. In addition to his anam cara and his kin, Frodo is joined by mighty, fearsome warriors, Aragorn and Boromir. Both are great men, noble and fine, but only one stays the course. St. Columba is an example of a warrior monk, admired not only for his spiritual leadership, but his physical vigor. Irish and Scots monasteries were communities (townships) which had to defend themselves and sometimes even warred amongst themselves. Courage and phsyical prowess have always been highly prized among the Celts.

Gimli the dwarf and his ilk exemplify the incomparable achievements of Celtic art and metalworking, the reverence with which the Celtic Christians created beauty to glorify God. Old Bilbo did not go on the journey; rather, he stayed secluded and completed his book. Love for learning and a meticulous recording of both Irish myth and the classic Greek and Latin texts have given the Irish/Scots the well-deserved accolade of ""saviors of civilization"" during the so-called Dark Ages (the golden age of Celtic Christianity). The Book of Kells and the Lindisfarne Gospels are the prime examples of this achievement.

When the druid religion gave way before Christianity, many elements of druid belief were incorporated into the Celtic Christian worldview. One of the most significant is the belief in the Otherworld - the place where our spirit flies and the place where the faeries live. For the druids, the line between worlds was thin and the Otherworld was as real as the one we physically inhabit. 

This notion was incorporated into Celtic Christianity in a very beautiful way. As we've said, community is vital to the Gaels. But community doesn't begin or end with those who are presently living amongst us. Rather, our relationships span all time and space, making the saints who've gone before completely accessible to us -- willing to care, to share and to guide in a very real and personal way. Legolas the Elf joins Frodo's band, bringing with him the druidic love for and deep understanding of nature and her ways. He and Gimli become soul friends, each finding their mirror in one another and, eventually, sharing the journey to the Otherworld.

Throughout Frodo's travels, he is guided and counseled by the immortal elves, particularly Galadriel. In Celtic spirituality we are never alone in our journey, but have everpresent and immanent support from angels and saints, and most especially from Mary, Mother of God. Celtic culture has always respected the wisdom of women. It is said that St. Brigid counseled kings and ruled as abbess over men and women both. While many monks and nuns chose celibacy, it was not required and many priests married (at least prior to Roman ascendancy). Also, many laymen and laywomen lived in monastic communities, their dedication and spiritual contributions recognized and respected.

Frodo had one final companion when he set off with the ring - a druid named Gandalf the Grey. There are likely dozens of people who've written books and articles dealing with the symbolism of Gandalf, but I'll share my own observations, based not on scholarship, but on my many readings of the books and my own heart. 

Gandalf walked the dusty roads of Middle Earth, protecting, healing, teaching. He was a peregrinari of the first order. He was a wizard and performed miracles. He knew the dangers and possibilities of true sight and sought not the gift for his own benefit. He flew on eagle's wings, just as ancient druids saw through the eyes of birds. He endured the fire and was recast as Gandalf the White. He was powerful, wise and mighty. He was the servant of good. He was the agent through which the will of the Word was made manifest to Frodo. Yet, he was not the bearer of the Ring.

The Celtic peoples live on the fringes of the world, just as the Shire lay on the fringes of Middle Earth. In the early centuries of the first millenium the western world was awash in war and chaos and civilization seemed to retreat to the distant environs of Byzantium far, far away. Yet, a small trickle of simply robed men appeared, first two Britons, Ninian going to Galloway in southern Scotland, and then Patrick returning to northern Ireland. From Ireland the trickle grew, sending men like Columba, Aidan, Brendan, Columban, and many more. With dusty feet and a few companions, these men walked the paths of Scotland, northern England, France, Switzerland, Germany, Italy, and as far away as Iceland, ministering to the poor, establishing monasteries, spreading education, preserving knowledge, and being Christ in this world.

Most did not know where they were headed when their journey began, nor what hardships they might endure along the way. They traveled light, trusting in providence to provide for their needs and trusting God to take them where they were to go. It is the pilgrimage itself that defines who we are; the journey is the purifying fire. God alone determines where, when, and how that journey ends. What we offer to God is our willingness to step out onto the path and start walking. Or, as Frodo said, ""I will take the Ring, though I do not know the way.""

So yes...I got to the end of that essay and I thought, wow. No wonder! That's ME..the whole art, journey, light thing? Yes!! The last paragraph in particular is perfect for me and my life right now! Again I say, wow..."

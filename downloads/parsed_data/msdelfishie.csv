Now, maybe this is my own lack of understanding of military policy, and general war strategy.. but if you were Iraq, and you had in fact been making chemical weapons and general weapons of mass destruction, why would you want to go and destroy them just before a war starts? If you were building them, isn't a war exactly the thing you'd been building them for? That'd be like if you were cooking a ham for easter incase anyone showed up, but then pitching the ham into the backyard dumpster the second you heard your family was coming for sure.

In other news, I feel highly pleased that all I did this long weekend was attend a lot of parties, and none of them had a damned thing to do with eggs, easter, or jesus."

"event","My horoscope per astrology.yahoo.com: Some vivid, inspiring, and intense dreams or visions could come your way today, dear Cancer. They might involve paranormal figures such as angels. Make sure you keep a record of them, as your Higher Self is trying to tell you something. Make a list of all the images you can remember and analyze what these images symbolize to you. You could come up with some profound insights, both about the world and about yourself.

Wow. I get to see the pretty angels. I'm kind of relieved it's going to happen finally. Me and My Higher Self have been at odds for awhile.

I almost feel angry at this horoscope person. Like what a lame sad way to manipulate people. The only people who're going to read this and then later find it to be true are the highly influencable ones who probably shouldn't be allowed to read this stuff anyway. And then they'll go out, buy the book/get a subscription to something related/annoy me/etc.

Everything only really comes down to when people annoy me.

So where have I been, perhaps you are wondering? (assuming you don't all resent me for my massive disapearance and have deleted me from your friends lists)

I have been at home. At work. At the grocery store. Although I do feel like I go grocery shopping less finally, thank god and all the fucking angels. I have quit smoking, quit drinking soda and caffeine (although I am having a slight lunch-related relapse as I type this.)

Things are going pretty okay. Tomorrow or Saturday I am going to pick up my bicycle and use it to make friends. And that will be good.

I guess now that I don't talk about any personal stuff here, I feel like I haven't much to say."

"event","So I have a new obsession. You will all be so disapointed in me. (Cause I'm sure that you all still respect my tastes now that you know I'm a Buffy nut.) Anyway.

I am all over this Michael Jackson media coverage like flies on.. well.. shit. I can't get enough. I'm going to watch the Fox special on Thursday and I can't fucking wait. I happened to catch the last 20 minutes of the Living With Michael Jackson rerun on VH1 on Saturday, and now I'm so hooked. I'm thinking about organizing a march to stop Michael Jackson or something. Take his kids away. 
Plus then think of how much more tv I could watch about it. I'm completely captivated by it. It's like a free freak show.

Look, I'm trying to convert others now! It can be my religion. I can be a ""Stop Michael Jackson but watch him on TV a lot"" zealot.

In other news, the most recent Bright Eyes album is really good. My personal life is chaotic (but I am unable to discuss it here. So much compartmentalizing although I suppose this is just a human tendency in general. Do emotions have tendencies, or is it just a common environmental thing?)

Um, hrm. Have a good day. Bye."

"event","So. Buffy. I'm a huge fan. Some of you may know that, and those of you who don't know it now.
But I think that next season they won't call the show ""Buffy"", but instead ""Skinny."" 
You know, first I watched it was like, ""wow. Sarah Michelle Gellar is so tiny."" But then it was, ""Wow. I can't believe that Michelle Tratchenberg (formerly of Pete and Pete fame) is even tinier."" And now with the new slayer-maybe (ironically enough named Amanda) we are introduced to new levels of skinny. The running joke at my house is that if you put a wooden cap on her head, you could just use her to stake many vampires at once.
haha, Buffy humor.
They killed off Tara, the only girl who looked like she wasn't starving, although certainly she wasn't a large girl or anything. And no, she didn't die of a heart attack. So now I watch it and I just want to visit Sunnydale and cook them all big meal. Maybe they look at me and just want to take me to the gym. But still, so much of the skinny.

On a semi-related note, I saw Chicago this weekend, and felt it was really good. Sort of. Some of the costumes and women incited terrified gasps out of my sister and I when they would do a chest/torso zoom in. There was a decided lack of breasts in the movie. I have decided that if your ribs protrude further than your breasts, it is not a good sign. I guess for me the intersting part was the variety of body types. Queen Latifah had a pretty sexy song and dance number, and Catherine Zeta Jones (whom I do not find attractive nor do I think is ""bigger"" had a lot of ""sexy"" parts. She's built kind of broad, but definitely is thin. Sadly compared next to Renne Zelleweger she looked like Marilyn Monroe. Zelleweger had a tragically adolescent boy looking body.), but also the skeleton girls were prominently featured. And a lot of people inbetween. Which I guess is cool and much better than only skeleton girls.

I dunno. I'm tired and kinda sick. Spent the weekend at my mother's house. It was mostly uneventful. I want it to be tomorrow so I can buy new pants. I need them.

With desperation.

Much love to all of you kids. Hope things're good."

"event","I think that David Lynch is probably a premature ejaculator. Lofty claim, I know. But he seems that way to me. I was watching Fire Walk With Me on Sunday (seeing it after you've watched all of Twin Peaks is much more useful than watching it prior) and realized that there's a 10 second part where he blows his wad about the end of the series. Just had to try to explain further what already seemed so obvious. I guess it's just incase you didn't know or something.

Tights are might better than nylons. Warmer, stretchier, comfier.

I just had a very depressing phone conversation with my mother. My mood has now shifted an entire 360 degrees from when I started my lunch. She makes me so sad. I think that my special relationship with Jesus is connected directly to my relationship with her. You know.. Jesus all martyr-ie, and my mom all self-made martyr-ie. Suffer suffer wallow. It's the formula. 
Don't get me wrong. I do love her and stuff. I actually think that her basic goodness is pretty big. She's just also really shitty sometimes.
---
I'm sick of people getting annoyed with other people for habits specific to that individual. It's like people forget that they have those habits too. Like who doesn't fucking have some neurosis or annoying or deluded thing they're doing sometimes? I haven't yet met the person. 
So if you're one of the many people walking around thinking that you're better or smarter or whatever than someone else, fucking cut it out. That behavior is in and of itself testament to the fact that you are deluded in your thinking.
Sad thing is that probably anyone who might actually benefit from that outburst will read it and assume I'm referring to anyone but them.
So if you just read that and thought, ""that's not me"" or even, ""fuck you."" then fucking read it and think about it again.

That was lovely. I've been having my period for too many days now. I do not know when or if it will stop or ever be right. It being all fucked up has some weird quality to it. I keep imagining my uterus all broken or beaten up or something. 
This one time I met someone who liked to penetrate cervixes. First there is fisting, and then you stick one or two of your fingers into the cervix with your entire hand in the vaginal canal.
Sounds like creepy alien experimentation type torture to me. But anyway, I guess I imagine my uterus like that. All ouch and with a finger blocking what should be open.

I love Pete and Pete. Do you love Pete&Pete? Come on, you know you do. Best show ever. I also find that I am enjoying Clone High on MTV. Pretty funny.

Today after work I am buying new shoes. I love shoes. I have to do some less fun things tonight like do laundry and take care of crappy money things so my family will leave me alone and just stop calling.
I am begining to feel like I never want to see them again. Like I did when I first went away to college.
Sigh.
I feel like my patience is gone and everything irritates me. 
---
On more a pleasant note, I do believe in the basic good of all humans. Just today I am bitchy. Broken uterus acting out, maybe.

"event","So today for lunch I have brought this little cup of Dole jello and fruit which was not really mine to take but I did it anyway. And jello is scary stuff. I bet it's like cockroaches. Could withstand nuclear war, you know? It'd been in the fridge for a long time and so I checked the experiation date before I threw it in my bag. You will be reassured to know that the tiny cup of jello with slices of real tangerine in the bottom will not expire until July of 2007. It's real fruit. The only thing I can figure is that since it's all jello-y maybe no oxygen gets in.
But don't you think science should look to jello for advancements? Wouldn't that be way cheaper than cryogenically freezing sick people? Like if there's some kind of uber jello, we could stick them in it, vaccum seal the lid, and let them sit for 10 or 20 years. And then no one would have to stress about how to thaw them out without killing them. Just peel the top off their jello bed and rinse them.

So everyone here has this food on paper plates. It does not smell at all like my tuna sammich (which is actually tasting pretty good right now)and it looks like potatoes and corn and green beans and some weird meat. I am only interested in the former at the moment. But where is this food coming from? I've seen crock pots in a couple of different offices, but surely I am not just to walk in and help myself to various people's crockpots. No one tells the temps anything. Fucking temps (see above (the other day I spilled coffee all over my crotch and it appeared that I had pissed myself)).

So since Sunday, after about 9-10 months of smoking cloves, I have decided to rejoin the world of non-smokers. I'm not like miserable or feinding or anything. Mostly I have not noticed. I was pretty sick of the smoking at the end.
But the funny thing is that any latent nicotine cravings I am having are manifesting in sleep. For the past two nights I've had dreams all about smoking and the trouble that comes from my smoking in inappropriate places etc.
--
I guess that's it. My bra is making me hurt something awful. But I cannot show the office my nipples. Ugh.
There's lots of weirdness going on in my life right now. But none I can talk about. Online journals are not so anonymous really. Confidences and other people must be protected.
I always wonder how other people feel comfortable toting that line more brashly than I do.
I mean, do you ever worry about these things, or am I just overly much paranoid?

*So I like Courtney Love. I know, it's dirty and filthy and vile and she's kind of stupid and completely insane, but I do. It's been going on for years, my secret like of her. I'm not a huge fan or anything, but you know. I have appreciation. I think sometimes that perhaps it was spawned by the fact that she was the partner in the first sex dream I ever had. She was going down on me at some posh party we were both at.

And is it just me, or do you feel like you're reliving the same traumatic experience with David Lynch every time you watch one of his movies? I just feel like ugh.. get some new tricks.
Or some new imagery.
Or something.
Please.
I mean, good and evil is one of the most common themes in everything everywhere. But he uses pairing like James Conrad- you know, 2 per page-like it's going out of style or something.
If I see one more David Lynch bit about a blonde and a burnette girl, one good and one evil (although which is which varies sometimes even in the same movie) I'm going to track him down, slap him, and tell him to find some new material.
It's gotten so bad that Mulholland Drive was just boring. The most exciting/intense part of the film was realizing that perhaps Billy Ray Cirus has a cameo, mullet and all. It was not scary or creepy or a departure from oh.. say.. ANY film he's done in the past.
I mean, I think that Twin Peaks may have been his best work, and that was a collaboration.
Whew. Now that my David Lynch rant is over...

How is everyone? How were holidays? Mine were okay. I am okay. I start a new job January 2nd. Yay. My car is being fully fixed on Sunday (hopefully with no further hitches). And um.. I guess that's kind of it. I've been feeling kind of depressed and negative lately. Hopefully someone out there is being my normal positive optimistic self so as to pick up my slack.

I dreamt last night that I was Jesus. I dreamt that I was a god in a group of gods, and my role was to be Jesus through his rise in decline. So in the first lifetime I was Jesus the man, and then incarnations of Jesus via other prominient christianity-spreaders, and then for his decilne I was the spirit of Santa Claus.
Too much turkey?

So mayhaps you are wondering what Del is up to these days?
If not, you're hearing it anyway.

I guess the biggest news thing is that I am moving again in the very near future. In with my boyfriend and his girlfriend temporarily.
Which I know sounds crazy, but I assure you it's not. I think it might be really good.
I will have my own room. Just to clear up any curiosity per that point.

But I would like to elaborate a little bit on this crazy polyamory thing I'm doing.

<b>I AM NOT A SWINGER.</b>

A conversation I had with a random internet person the other day:

him: so do you swap?
me: No, there's no swapping. It's not about casual sex.
him: are you both bi?
me: I don't see how that's important.
him: bi oral is only okay in group situations of 5 or more.
me: Thanks for the tip.
him: so it doesn't matter what happens at the party as long as you go home together at the end fo the night?
me: There are no sex parties. If I go to a party with someone on a date then I am spending time and leaving with them. I am not fucking random others in the interim.
me: This is not about getting laid frequently by strangers.

Yeah, I'm not a swinger. I just thought I'd clear all that up.
Basically when I say I'm polyamorous it means that I believe that people are capable of having more than one equal and meaningful relationship at a time.
I don't mean all people.. just some of them.
I am not down on monogamy, and I do not feel that everyone should run out and be polyamorous. I just think that maybe I can.

And since I'm bitching about sexual misconceptions.. let me just touch on the fact once again that if you are a man with a closeup picture of only your erect penis, WOMEN DO NOT WANT TO SEE THIS UNSOLICITED. If some crazy girl asks you for it, she is not lying.
But no one else wants to see.
Please stop sending them.

Anyway.. really I'm doing pretty well lately. I am happy. Isn't that queer?

I also find that this winter I really like the snow and the cold. It is the first winter this has happened.

Much love to all of you."

Yes, without a doubt, aliens exist. I mean, if you just consider the number of other galaxies and space in space.. they just have to. Probability is on that side.
However
I do not believe that aliens repeatedly visit earth to abduct farmer bob.
I mean, let's look at this as logically as we can. If there really are superior beings flying around in saucers, why are they all coming to earth all the time? Don't they have other places to be? And especially why are they all coming to earth to abduct our local farmers and hicks? I mean, if these great smart beings have the technology to fly here in a saucer, how many times do they need to abduct our locals to conduct elaborate experiments on our idiots? I mean, how many semen samples/anal probes need to happen before a creature smart enough to fly here in a saucer can understand a human body? 
Although I guess that at the very least if these claims have any validity, the aliens do have enough integrity to take only the lame people and spare the great leaders and great minds.

I think it will actually be really fun. It seems kind and mellow and warm and friendly and these things are so important to me right now.
I really am doing an outstanding job of eradicating the badness/chaos from my life.

In other news, my father's in the hospital having some massive 4 hour heart surgery right now. I think he's going to be just fine. But it's kind of funny.. like he keeps having these heart attacks and not realizing it.

Also, I find it funny that upon my return today (I missed work yesterday) I find out that everyone here is really really mad at me for having missed work to attend a concert in Cleveland.
Uh-huh.
Granted, I was not doing the excuse that I gave for missing work yesterday, but I never left state bounds.
Crazy rumor spreading mother fuckers. I step on your heads!!!!
So you know what I think is cool? Victor/Victoria. Julie Andrews. You know? And older movie with Julie Andrews as a Drag King (sorta) with lots of gay men and stuff not protrayed too negatively. I mean, it's certainly no testament to political correctness, but it's nice. Considering the time period and everything. IT WAS AHEAD OF ITS TIME!!!
(I'm a little weird today. No sleep for two days and lots of caffine has me half out of my mind.)
But speaking of movies.. (incase anyone here is going to be bored this week)...
     Really good movies I have seen lately: 
-The Price of Milk (Austrialian and twisted and bizarre and oh so good.
-The Cream Will Rise (A documentary on fucking Sophie B. Hawkins. Would never except it to be really good. But it was so good.)
-Song Catcher (It was fucking awesome. I was watching it and my 15 year old little sister came and watched it too. Afterwards we couldn't really decide what about the movie we liked exactly, or why/when/how it had sucked us in completely, but it did. And we did concurr that it was really good.)
     Decent movies I have seen lately:
Girl Fight- (Don't worry, I couldn't believe I liked it either. Fucking boxing, right?)
Happiness- (Todd Solodnz movie. It was really fucked up and disturbing. I tend to really really like that. Not intended for the weak of heart or stomach.)
The Tao of Steve- (Barely a decent movie. Interesting to see. It kind of pussies out at the end. Only thing I didn't like about it.)
     Horrible and Irredeemable movies I have seen lately:
If You Only Knew- (I'm embarassed to admit that I sat through it.)

.end of movie list.

So in case you couldn't tell, I've been watching a lot of cable lately. Way too much cable. I think my brain my be rotting.
But the good news is that I am watching the cable as a background to... creative activies!
No, I am not masturbating with oddly shaped objects while watching G-String Divas! (Although some of them *are* really really hot and I have masturbated after watching it, but not with any oddly shaped objects or anything. But I have digressed!)
I am working on a myriad of creative projects. As of late the most consuming one is the character designs for the web comic I am making. It will be funny. I think. You might not.
Fuck you!
Anyway. Working on web comic. It will be good. I'll let you kids know the where when the when happens.
Have been writing also, and practicing reading poetry. I read at my first poetry reading on Sunday.
I did pretty okay. I was not satisfied with my performance, but I didn't hate myself afterwards or anything.
The funniest part is that I was shaking so hard I probalby appeared to be vibrating from a distance.
But still, I did okay. Plan to do it again sometime soon.
And so!
In other news, I have a new plan.
I'm getting a new job, and am going to move in with a stranger. So then I can move into an apartment very very quickly and not need to save any money at all.
I have an interview with a department of the State of Michigan on Monday.
The money is less than great, but it's certainly livable.
And then I just have to find the right stranger to move in with. It'll be easy! I can have an apartment and everyone can come visit and hang out!
But definitely, the leaving Hi-Tech part is important.
I am on a mission to cut the chaos out of my life completely.
Or at least as completely as one is able.
Anyway.. I think I've carried on far too long. Wish me luck with the job/apartment-fast thing.

I will not be tuning in to any patriotic bullshit.
But I do have a confession to make.
...maybe I've been a bit ridiculous. A bit over-zealous. A bit anti-war obsessed.
I think I've been overlooking the fact that people died. Well, you know, that American people died.
I was listening to the barrage of radio broadcasts on the way to work today, and for the first time, I felt completely wrecked about the whole thing. Before I was channeling my energies into anger at our American Blood Lust and Blood Debt (which really I am still utterly disgusted and angry about. The appropriate response in this is not to lash out and start blowing people up. It's not to invade other countries. It's not to send out the troops and kill hundreds cause we think one man might be responsible. Come on America, where is your responsibility to yourself? All life is of value. I could go on at length, but I tend to get nauseaus.. and melodramatic.) and so never really felt much grief at American loss.
I think that what it is.. is that these lives.. the people who died because of the attacks on the trade center, are being treated like real people and not just numbers.
We tend to break down war tactics as numbers in America. So that everything is safe and clean and just some statistic or a colored statistic and not actual people who had lives ahead of them.
And I've been kind of angry at ""we will not forget.""
Like okay mother fuckers, that's funny. Cause when it's anyone but you, all you do is forget.
Like as long as we're remembering shit, let's take it all the way and remember the poeple that America has killed. Let's remember that the  Afghani citizens who hate us only do so because we put so many fucking land mines in their country. Let's remember how many native Americans we killed.  How many people died in a Rawandan genocide when Clinton ok'd withdrawing UN troops and the world looked on.
But anyway. I'm all pissed off.
What I mean is just that I guess I've kind of overlooked the American loss. I've been too angry to feel sad about our end of it directly.
The situation as whole makes me feel completely despairing.
So I just wanted to post this and say that um.. yeah. That sucks for America a lot too.
I'm still not watching any patriotic bullshit tonight. And I'm still incrediblely pissed off at every single fucking American who supports the war.
But yes, our loss counts too.
Lives are lives kids. Here or overseas.

I also understand how hard it can be for a large person to find cool clothes. But those shirts have got to go. Also; being a big person does not merit, require, or even justify swimming in your t-shirts. If your shirt could double as a moo-moo if you lose the pants, you may want to consider getting a smaller shirt.

So does anyone else remember when you used to be able to put a program on a floppy disk?* ICQ used to fit on a floppy. Winzip won't even go on a floppy anymore. Like what the fuck? What makes these people think I want all these weird fucking features. No, I do not want a decrompession program to do my dishes, dust my monitor, and sort my underpants in its spare time. No, if I am downloading a music satelite I do not want it to also have some program with which it can ""helpfully"" memorize my form information to fill them out for me any time it deems fit! I do not want a web browser that comes with a seperate e-mail client and also a web page editor.

In other news.. I had this dream last night about being a world famous porn star, actress, model, and spy. I was in the spy phase of my life. I was kicking a lot of bad guy ass.
*but*!!...
All this got me to thinking.
What the fuck is up with James Bond, anyway? I mean how effective could the guy actually be if he's that sexy, that rich, and that famous? Wouldn't that be a little inconspicuous? That's like if a flock of armed guard are walking down the street in uniform, the public will be more likely to behave till they pass.

Last night I had this dream that I went to this weird uncomfortable lunch with this girl and I screwed the whole thing up because I couldn't stop telling way too much of the truth. Not like the offensive kind of ""truth"" where it's hurtful or anything, but just like where you start talking and pretty soon you're talking about the athelete's foot you once had and your innermost feelings about the things your grandfather did to you and your love of Oscar the Grouch because his name always reminded you of Crotch.
And this other person just wants to drink their tea and eat their fucking sandwich and your mouth is racing out of control and you cannot make it say something light and cheery and of no consquence.
So the other person just kind of stares at you like you're nuts *and* obnoxious.
Your mouth has become possessed by the spirits of all the things you never say casually let alone at all!
It was like that. 
I think it's because I lack such a balance in my life where lies and truth are concerned. And lately there's this whole thing about truth vs. integrity so now we have truth, integrity, lying, and technically honest.
Oi.
Too many tenses of a situation for me to even want to sort out.
It seems like complication where there needn't be any. You know? But then I guess that carrying on at the speed of light about all things true and personal or not so much adds complication also.
I don't know where the balance is in there. Can't see her. Any way stated seems like just picking sides or picking an excuse or picking nothing at all.
And anyway, I'm sleepy.
Why must I be at Hi-Tech today? Why does R keep screaming at me like everything I do is wrong? One of these days probably I'm going to freak out and scream. Why is it only 11am?
My mom has a job interview today. Some restaurant managerial position at the Hyatt Regency.
Rock, right? If she works there, I can stay at any Hyatt across the country any time half-price.
She used to work there.
There's the fact that she'll be making way more money than the present none, and perhaps I will not have to contribute so much financially to my household.
Plus, if she takes this job she'll be working till midnight a lot of times and that would just be awesome. She won't be at home to freak out and worry so much.
She can do that at work.
She told me the other day that she thinks one of my sister's friends brought a roll for everyone at a party she had. 
Like some little 8th grade kid can afford enough E for 15 kids? Right. I'm sure.
Cause 8th graders don't discuss sex of their own accord. Only when under the influence of ecstacy do they discuss sex.
I think I'm carrying on about nothing at all at this point.
I want to have sex.
Um.
That's it for today, I guess."

How was yours?
Mine was okay. Had a really high-point, but the rest was just much too long.
So my 15 year old sister. You know, those younger siblings. One day they're telling you they aren't having sex with their boyfriend, and the very next day they're on the phone calling to ask you if you can provide a space for themselves and their boyfriend to have sex. Because he ""wants some"" and ""mom is home so we can't do it here.""
I try to be the cool older sister. I'll buy her cigarettes. I'll tell her and her boyfriend how to use a condom even though I do not approve of the activities neccesary to initiate one. I'll tell her and her boyfriend any time they're in trouble in any kind of serious way, they can call me and I'll do whatever I can to bail them out.
But they may not call me if they're horny.
I'm just not that fucking cool. Maybe in a couple years.
But right now I'm just another prude or something, I guess.
The prude thing is kind of funny. There have been a few times as of late when I've felt all conservative. Like there are a couple people in my life right now whom I feel very reserved and unexperienced next to. Kind of funny, you know? Like I've always viewed myself as liberal straightforward about uncomfortable stuff girl.
And yes, okay. Maybe ""The Hurricane"" is a little over zealous.
---
The man of my dreams will come to me someday, and he will say ""heretofore"" frequently and well.
Sometimes, in the throws of the deepest of passion, he will not call out my name. He will instead scream, ""heretofore!"" And this will be the man I will marry. He will be the man whose babies I eject.
--
I don't suppose that made any sense at all, but I am sick of qualifying my humor. So fuck you! Laugh mother fucker!
--
Yes. I guess I'm angry. Yes. I guess I'm sort of premenstral. And yes, I am aware that my sense of humor is at present making no sense to anyone. Least of all me.
Yesterday I wanted to make a comic of my family in the backyard and have everyone blank expressioned and saying ""Oh Honey."" And then have my mom saying, ""Oh Sweetie. Here you go.""
I didn't make it of course, but I thought that would be hysterical. And I could be sitting at the table with my jug of wine, open mouthed, but not saying anything at all.
--
So this kind of day at Hi-Tech is the very best kind. Everyone is out of the office. It's just me, livejournal, and whatever music I decide to lsiten to.
--
Okay, the goodness of the afternoon is officially over. I have spent the past half an hour running up and down the stairs begging for money where my manager did not want to.
Yes kids, it's not so great being the bitch sometimes.
--
All I want to do is drink soda. I heart Code Red. Ees so good to me.
--
In other exciting news, I am considering a change of career.
Wouldn't it be really cool if I gave people tattoos and got paid for it?
So I'm going to start working on all that, I think.
Does anyone out there in the know have any idea how to break into it? I mean, I know that I need to convince someone to aprentince me. I am persuasive and good, so this should not be impossible. 
--
In other news, Alex love, you should get a journal. I think it would be fun. I'd give you an lj code, but I don't have any.

On a completely unrelated note.. Friday's webcomics have helped to make me feel a tad bit better about being here today.

So to refer back to Jack and Meg.. I was watching the MTV Music awards last night. I know I know. I'm a sell out. I'm a pop culture slut. Whatever. Fine.
Anyway.
So I'm watching. And it's cool that like little rock bands are kinda becoming the cool thing again. It's such a nice departure from all the girl and boy groups, you know?
But so I'm watching this performance where um.. The Hives and then The Vines play. And it was cool.
It was like the spirit of Kurt Cobain had taken over Radio City.
If for whatever reason your head and mouth aren't making the words that are your lyrics, just make noises that sound vaguely like words. Scream. Whine. Grumble. Moan. Yell. Doesn't matter. If it sounds even slightly similar to the lyrics, the audience doesn't care if you're making words or not.
Fantastic.
Skinny little pretty indie rock boys jumping around on their wirey frames. 
Not so tremendous a departure from when Nirvana ruled MTV, yes?
Now I am a happy kitten cause I'll get to eat lunch today. R. has actually given us our checks at a reasonable time.
So!
Every Thursday R goes to see a girlfriend/prostutite. (D insists it's a girlfriend. Del says prostitute.) But anyway he leaves for a few hours every Thursday afternoon and makes up some ridiculous excuse. Almost every time I've been here he's said he's going to Granger's.
Yesterday he was having a heart attack and had to rush immediately to the ""hospital"". He came back a few hours later making no mention of any heart attack, sex, or hospital.
I thought it was kind of funny. Like how when everyone was saying Clinton's hand gestures during his ""I am not a bad guy"" commercials actually were signals to Monica Lewinski or whatever.
Like maybe ""I""m having a heart attack and have to go to the hospital immediately"" is code.
Where ""heart attack"" = erection, and ""hospital immediately"" = go see the prostitute.
Heh.
So I guess that's it.

"event","So as my first act of supreme ruler of all the lands, I am going to enforce some new rules.
While I realize that Queens do not have to work 40 hour work weeks at jobs that enslave them, my first act is to help the rest of you peons with your commute to work.
So best case scenario is to create a public transportation system that spans the entire country and is just really good.
But this will take awhile to create.
So, in the meantime:
1. Enforce speed limits. And I don't mean that cops should crack down harder on those who speed. I mean that those who don't go fast enough should be punished. I mean, christ. If I can't drive 65 in a 45mph zone, why should someone be able to do 15mph on the same road?
2. Big trucks need their own roads to travel on. When you're late for work and some idiot in their semi who doesn't know how to turn right is holding up all of traffic it um.. only makes you more late.
So no more of that!

But really, these are not the only changes.
-Also, no one is allowed to freak out and scream at me like they're drowning when only they are asking for their appointment time.
-George W. Bush will receive the public barbeque he so wholely deserves:one wherein he is the guy in the fire with the apple in his mouth. The only pig I will ever gladly cook and eat.
-All Americans who are in favor of this war will be sent to a cult deprogrammer immediately. They will then attend a series of seminars held by those who do not support our attacks against ""the axis of evil"" and will come to their fucking senses. The bottom line: Hurt pride and feeling threatened does not justify invading other countries and blowing up their civilians in a crazy hunt for one man. Disagree? I'm Queen. So fuck you and pack your bags for your stay with the deprogrammer.
-All people held without attourney or charges pressed in Cuba will be immediately freed.
-Our prisons will be cleared out and we'll stop trying to fix adults by grounding them or sending them to a corner. A better system of help/rehabilitation will be created. It probably needn't be stated, but the death penalty will also then be abolished.
-Abortions for anyone without parental consent. No more trying to regulate, restrict, or abolish them.
-Drugs aren't illegal.
-Cloves are way less expensive.
I guess there's way more stuff that I'd change than I feel like listing here.
Oh, right. Professional sports fans would have to shut the fuck up and stay out of my face.
Poetry would become the new exciting national past time.
And um.. Allen Ginsberg would be ressurected, heterosexual, and would promptly marry me.

Hey. Do you do Judo when they surround you? A little mental yoga-will they disapear? It's grim but never dubious.
Thunder wishes it could be the snow.

"event","Fucking work and getting up early.
I think my dream job is just some night job where I can wear what I want and look however I'd like. And most importantly, it will be at night. I will be going to bed at 7:00 a.m. Not getting up then.
But speaking of getting up at 7:00 a.m., I would like to tell you about my new morning annoyance.
Before it was this: My father used to tell me on a regular basis that I needed to get up earlier every day so that in case some fluke in schedule arose (I get up and generaly have 10-15 minutes to shower, dress, and make it out the door on time.) I would still be able to leave on time. I of course, not wanting to give up 15 minutes of sleep, disagreed wholeheartedly. So my dad started waiting until he heard me coming down the stairs, and then he'd go into the bathroom and shit.
I mean, maybe this was all some big coincidence, but it didn't seem so. These things had never happened until we started arguing about this, and once I gave in and started getting up earlier to accomodate his new bathroom schedule, the new bathroom schedule ended. But this running into the bathroom as soon as I got up every morning for 15 minutes really messed up my schedule.
But I digress.
The new morning annoyance relates to my mother's husband.
You see, the man is almost as brain dead as our collie.
I cannot even begin to explain to you how nearly brain dead he is.
But one example is the new thing that drives me nuts every morning.
So the husband likes to ask stupid questions. Like, ""What's your name? Who are you? Where are you going? What are you doing?""
And sometimes he'll change it up.
""What's your name? For the Championship of the World, what IS your name?""
Okay.
Fair enough. It's even kind of funny the first 3,000,000 times.
But when you're walking out of your bedroom, awake for 30 seconds, sleep crust still in your eyes, and someone is getting in your face asking you what your name is and where you're going, you find that you have suddenly forgotten where you put your sense of humor.
You hope that you stub your toe on it so that you can pick it up, and club the offender over the head with your rock hard 7a.m. sense of humor.
On a sad note, they have fired my only friend here at Hi-Tech. Now it's just me and the boringly insane."

We now interrupt your regularly scheduled bitch-fest for a brief lesson in history.
(yes, kids. You've heard correctly. Del takes up history lessons.)
So how many of you have heard of Kristin Hersh or Tanya Donnely? Somewhere other than my journal of course.
Okay.
Brief recap of their place in music history:
Two best friends from middle school whose divorced parents get married. You get step-sisters. You get a band.
That band went on to be known as Throwing Muses. Big college band. You know. Artsy before REM was really cool. 
Tanya leaves the band goes on to get with Kim Deal and form...
The Breeders.
Kristin continues her career with Throwing Muses, but begins a side solo project. Her first album, entitled Hips and Makers, features a kick ass duet with the one and only Michael Stipe. It'll slay you. Go hear it. Ees called, ""Your Ghost.""
She went on to make 3-4 other albums, the number a bit subjective as one was an internet only release.
Tanya leaves the Breeders and goes to play bass for L7 for awhile.
Breaks from L7 after only one album,and forms her own band. Belly.
You know, cute little Feed The Tree song. The album is actually really really cool. It's called Star.
Tanya leaves Belly after two albums to pursue a solo career.
Tanya's two solo albums to date are Love Songs for Underdogs and Beauty Sleep. The former is a kickass album.
Kristin Hersh's most recent release, Sunny Border Blue, is also really incredible. PJ Harvey even endorses it. Heh.
--
Anyway, what sparked all this history and other such nonsense is that I was thinking about this summer as a whole.
Now that it's nearing it's end and stuff.
And I was kind of like mentally trying to think of what the ""record of the summer"" would be. And while certainly it is not new, Love Songs for Underdogs has been most played or me this summer.
Also this summer I fell really hard in love, and um.. successfully averted getting a tan. Except for the one arm that looks sort of healthy.
--
In other news, on the too much personal information front, I shaved my pubic hair and now I have like the itchiest cunt ever. Gah. I kind of would like to try waxing it off, but that just sounds too painful for me to handle myself. And I can't imagine going into some hair salon and sticking my cunt in some girls face only to ask her to get right in there and pull all the hairs out.
So I guess I'm being pretty melodramatic. Certainly it's not the itchiest ever. This isn't too bad as far as regrowing pubic hair is concerned.
See? Ms Del Fishie is on live journal. She is also an attention-slut.
And so are you.

On a related note, the night after I broke the big move-out news to my dad, my father, 15 year old sister and I, all went to get pizza. My dad and I were talking about the Anna Nicole Smith show and he was saying how it's an abomination and I was talking about how I think it's really cool and entertaining in that gruesome car wreck kinda way.
Whereupon my little sister suddenly interjects (!) stopping us both in our steads: I don't know. I think she's totally hot.
Which was really awesome because that's another reason I like the show (I know. I have a thing for trashy women. It's weird. Don't ask.) but certainly nothing I had intended to discuss with my father.
She's getting some balls. Turning into a really cool kid and stuff.

I just fell for a ploy. AIM told it would tell me my ""seduction style"" and I assumed it would be at the very least a mildly interesting quiz.

I know that if a partner of mine wanted to spend all afternoon brushing my hair and scratching my back I""d feel more weirded out than I would like fucking.
But um.. I am not a middle aged woman. 
Oh, so much to look forward to as I age.
Perhaps I shall take up reading Cosmo for their oh so vital sex secrets and the like.

Perhaps I am turning cynical in my old age. Perhaps I just want to collapse into bed.
Perhaps um.. I don't know. Please let it be 4:30 on Friday. These things are so important.
I guess on a plus note it is a Wednesday.
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays are my favorite days.
Web comics rule my life.

Just to recap today thus far:

8:05 I punch in. I come into the shop, and everything's fine. Everyone's in a good mood and smiling.
8:15 One of our big accounts calls to talk to the owner, (who will be known as R.) R freaks out, screams at the top of his lungs, and then slams the phone on our customer.
8:17 R, still freaking out, begins to scream in gibberish at both myself and the manager (who will be known as D.). After much of the hysterical screaming gibberish, he runs through the office, and then still screaming, runs out into the shop to terrorize the workers.
8:19 Customer calls back and insists he must speak further with R. We try to warn him that he doesn't really want to do that. But no, the customer insists.
8:20 R comes screaming back into the office. We tell him that he has a phone call.
It's kind of funny really. He's all crazy and flailing and his hair is in a mess all over his head and flapping around in the breeze. He's all red and looks like he's constipated or something.
8:25 R storms into my office and tells me to call someone to come into a job interview.
8:27 R and D begin to scream at eachother at the top of their lungs. D saying that he's sick of R screaming, and R saying that it's not his fault if he gets ""the paranoia and has to talk loud.""
8:35 I am waiting for them to finish so that I can make the phone call and not have the possible future employee freaked out already by the screaming.
8:40 Manda gets sick of waiting and closes her door to make the phone call.
9:00 R comes screaming into my office again, telling me to call A-1 to have them bring a check and pick their truck up at noon.
But A-1 is the company that's fixing one of our trucks, I try to tell R. NO NO he screams, A-1 IS THE TRUCK OWNER. JUST CALL THEM, AMANDA.
9:05 I call A-1. They are very confused. We're not repairing their truck. They're putting a new transmission into one of ours.
9:10 I try to figure out who the A-1 that R was talking about were. No clue. Also need to figure out to find the estimate to tell them how much to bring.
9:12 DID YOU CALL THE GUY AT A-1?-R
I explain that A-1 is fixing our truck, and he starts to yell at me about how I already started the invoice on it, and I should know right where it is.
9:20 Figure out that he's actually talking about Rent-A-Center (I guess the A in the middle threw him off.)
9:50 Customer whom R hung up on shows up with two boxes of donuts. I am afraid to eat them after my Krispy Kreme experience this morning. Also, as the customer is immensely pissed off and so I am afraid that the donuts must be poisoned or old or moldy or something.
I mean, angry people don't bring you donuts because they're being kind, do they?
10:15 Everything has evened back out to slight screaming and a lot of whining.
The sad thing is that my hope is that this is how the rest of the day will go.
---
On a lighter note, the owner's wife was telling me yesterday about how she grew up in communist Poland. And she said something to me like, ""Europeans don't all have good work ethics either. I used to work in an office all day doing 3 hours worth of work. So we'd all sit around and drink coffee and chat all day. Because there was nothing to do. The government was paying everyone to drink coffee and chat! Of course that makes the economy bad! Why they didn't see that one coming, I will never know.""
I thought it was very funny.
---
So let's talk for a moment about The White Stripes.
Good Detroit band. I like it when good bands come from Detroit. We need to export a lot of goodness to make up for Kid Rock and Eminem.
Anyway, as a word of advice, I think that White Blood Cells is a really good album. But previous albums are a lot better. I prefer De Stijil, personally. Or however they're spelling that.
Anyway, that's what I have to say about the White Stripes.
---
I like bidis. The vanilla kind are my favorite. Oddly enough, the cherry are pretty good too.
---
haha. R just came in here frantic and gibberishing at me and he's pulled the collar up on his shirt in the back so that he looks like Dracula or something. Or at the very least, like he thinks he might be Bela Legosi.
---
I guess that's it.
I feel like I should be letting you all know something pertinent about my or my emotional state or my life.
I will just say that I'm the happiest I've been in years, and am working on the me part.
And leave it at that.

""soft hair and a velvet tongue
wanna give you what you give to me.
and every breath that is in your lungs
is a tiny little gift to me.""

"event","So 7:45 this morning and I'm putting gas in my BRAVA-DAH!! and eating some Krispy Kreme donut which is actually quite disgusting. Whilte I do realize that no donut is healthy, I think that eating a krispy kreme is similar to pouring a bag of sugar and a cup of grease down your throat.
Worst donut ever.
Anyway, so I'm putting the gas into my car and am not doing my part to prevent global warming when all of a sudden I hear an atomic bomb go off (or at the very least something equally loud.) Being human and all, I am naturally irritated by loud noises, so I turn to see what has exploded.
It was a motorcycle.
Well, a modded out motorcycle just being really loud. No explosions.
So I'm thinking like, ""okay mother fucker. You have a motorcycle, yes. I'm sure your parents are very proud of you. I notice. We all notice. You've done your part in starting my daily headache, so can't you go and fucking make it quieter now?""
But you know, then I realized I was staring at this red shiney bike, so I started to actually look at it.
And christ. You know, it was one of those giant things. Like a honda or something maybe? You know, like a luxury yuppie motorcycle? And I'm sorry, but if your motorcycle is built like a love seat (pussy point #1), I can't take you seriously. I keep eyeing this giant monstrosity, to see that this guy has hung fringe (pussy point #2) along the bottom of the square back of the bike. So like there's fringe along the bottom of the loveseat around the tire and just barely missing the ground.
Whew. It's almost too much for me to not start jeering at him.
Not of course that he'd be able to hear me.
So then (and here's my favorite part) the guy on the bike is wearing nikes (pussy point #3), beige khaki pleated shorts (pussy point #4), and a plaid button down preppy shirt (pussy point #5). 
And now, my question for you, live journal readers, is that if you're that big of a pussy and are riding around on something that stupid and clothes like those, why in the hell would you want your bike to be the loudest bike I've ever heard to draw attention to yourself?
Clearly you are not a badass or even like tough or something.
Clearly you are just sad."

The event of killing co-workers and bosses and getting rid of buildings?
Perhaps that event.
But on a softer more cuddlely note, this is the first day of the rest of your life.
So in lieu of this fact, I think we should all cheer right up.
[insert applause here]
Yeah, am feeling pretty fucking cynical today.
I'm not sure why exactly. Perhaps it's that I'm premenstral. Perhaps it's that I'm overtired and feel like a bratty 8 year old who hasn't had her nap. Perhaps it's that Captain Optimism is off napping, leaving me bitchy instead of obnixously hopeful.
Perhaps it's that it's only Wednesday and I need Friday to happen.
Big weekend this weekend. Get to breathe. Am going to City Club on Saturday. And I may even read at an open mic poetry reading on Sunday.
So I have met my future roommate. She is small and gray and quite furry.
Funny my priorities.
Pick cat out now. Apartment next month.
It was more an accident, happening upon the cat.
Well, an accident sort of. Kate was very deliberate about assigning me the cat.
So yesterday was my birthday.
Funny things, birthdays.
This was kind of like the first really good birthday I've had in years**. 
So here is my funny birthday-anecdote for you (do not worry, ess brief): 
My father, his girlfriend, Kate, and myself sit down to have birthday cake, and my father's girlfriend divulges that she'd bought candles, but they were for a 20th birthday and so we couldn't use them this year. I asked her what was wrong with them, and she told me that they were for last year.
After a minute we all pieced together that my father had my year of birth off by 1. He thought I was turning 21 this year.
Funny guy, that my father. 

AnD sO nOw I aM tHiNkInG; wOuLdN't It Be GrEaT iF i TyPeD lIkE tHiS aLl ThE tImE???????

I'm sure you'd all be thrilled.

Anyway.. back to the invoice making I go. Hope everyone's life is going well.
Aside from my cynical bitching, mine really is.

*This is a reference to the fact that it's the best birthday I can remember. I may have been Princess of Romainia for my birthday four years ago. I simply cannot recall any birthdays that happened before last year. I'm pretty sure though that even if I could, this one would still have kicked the most ass. 

*The second astrix was to note that I have stolen this use of astrixes in livejournal from the one and only Owen. I am unsure of how to insert the link to his journal, but he's cluthu on my friends page. And yes, I stole his astrix. I do so hope he doesn't mind."

What as formerly super sized, is now only large.
There is a new larger more super size that is super size.
What's up with us Americans, anyway? We consistantly need to restrict our own civil liberties (see the RIAA) and then simeltaneously need to increase our soda and fry consumption with our already horrible for you burger/fried chicken. It's completely bizarre.

I fucking hate hockey.
We were at Denny's the other night during a Red Wings game and I was telling Kate that I wanted to put all the hockey fans in the cold cold water near sthe icecaps, and then explode the icecaps so they melt and fucking drown them all.
And then when the water comes and floods my state, I will die a happy happy girl.
Before I moved away in the first place, I used to root for the Wings to lose. Just so that the fucking hockey season would end more quickly.
I think that my next move should be to a state with no good sports teams at all. Maybe AZ. Or SD. Or um.. Canada.
Although Canada is sports crazy too.
Oy.

Sometimes I look at people and think, ""You've considered a career in the stripping industry, haven't you?""

I have a new tattoo. A fishie named Athena. She is good, but needs reinked now.

I also am at present craving to repeirce my nipples. What a funny craving is that? Let's put holes back into the skin.

I think next time someone asks me how I am, I'm going to make up a funny story about how I'm addicted to some drug.
And then I'll pause dramatically to see if they get the joke or extend sympathy. Although the two are not mutually exclusive.

I have stuff to do now.

"event","So in today's episode, highly insightful, sophisticated and qualified music critic, One Miss Del Fishie, will be lecturing on Canadian music.
I am sure you are riveted.
-----
I find as of late that when listening to the radio, I cannot escape a multitude of HORRIBLE canadian bands.
And yet somehow simeltaneously my Winamp playlist of the moment is dominated by Canadian artists.
How can this be?
I was thinking about that today at work and wondering whether Canadia, musically speaking, is more of a bane or more of a blessing on my life.
So really, let's explore that.

Banes:
-I have but one wish in life. That is that I would someday wake up to a world where THE BARE NAKED LADIES do not exist.
-Nickleback. I might be okay with that one song if the refrain was not, ""Are we having fun yet?"" Because you know, christ. Where are that guy's friends? If he was my friend and ask me what I thought of his lyrics, I would say, ""That's pretty good. But christ. Please take out the 'are we having fun yet?'. That's just stupid.""
-Nelly Furtado. I hate I AM LIKE A BIRD kind of tremendously. 
-Alanis Morrisette. Yes. Her too. She's had her rmoments. I liked her first album all right. And that song Uninvited is kind of cool. But the radio is so oversaturated with songs like, ""Hand in My Pocket"", ""Hands Clean"", and ""Head Over Feet"" that she is definitely absolutely more of a bane.
-Shania Twain.  Funny joke about her. HAHA! But that aside, she's a pain in my ass. Not too long ago she was everywhere you went. Now it's not so bad. But still. A bane.
-Celine Dion. The radio/tv/movies aren't too over-saturated with her right now, but my father's girlfriend plays her CDs all the time. Makes me suicidal.
-Rush.
-Sarah McLachlan. Kind of okay. But mostly a pain in my ass.
-Crash Test Dummies. Haven't been around for a while. But god. I hate them.
-Our Lady Peace. Please, just save yourselves the embarassment of another album and break up.

Blessings:
-Leonard Cohen. Probably one of my very very very favorite musicians.
-Sloan. Yay Sloan! So much fun.
-Tragically Hip. Okay, the vocalist is sort of weird but you know, it's good weird. And the music is really good.
-Hayden. This broody little guy is too endearing to be obnoxious. Check out ""Bad As It Seems"" if you're interested in hearing a Hayden song.
-THE NEW PORNOGRAPHERS. They are so good. Buy, steal, listen to their album. It is so good. Probably the best new band I've run into in quite awhile.

And that's it. Let's tally, yes?
Hrm. 10 banes and 5 blessings.
Do you hear that Canada? Go drink more beer and try again! 2/3 of your bands suck!
*coughs* I guess that I'm being biased in listing American bands that I hate versus those that I love. America needs to start trying again.
But England on the other hand, England does okay."

"event","Ocassionally people will ask me how my day was and I sometimes feel that ""good,"" ""horrible,"" ""mediocre"" or ""I'm too apathetic to even rate my day"" just do not suffice.
So as follows, I will explain my day for you in excrutiating detail.
Also, be warned. Much bitching follows.

5a.m: Wake up to the dog's howls. The parents are making him bark in order to receive his breakfast.
5:05a.m.: Contemplate suicide and decide that homocide is perhaps the better solution.
5:15a.m.: Try to go to back to sleep. 
5:30a.m.: Wake up to much laughter and commotion downstairs.
6:00a.m.: Ruminate upon the fucking ridiculousness of the situation. (For those of you who do not know, my father's girlfriend has thrown several tantrums lately about how I make too much noise after 10p.m. when she's gone to bed. So the following rules have been imposed: After 10 p.m. there can be no talking on the telephone, watching TV, listening to the radio, bathing, or laundry. Also cannot have any friends spend the night.) Okay, fine. Fuck you. You know, you want to get up at 5a.m. to chat and laugh, that's okay. But make the dog fucking bark and howl for his share of toast? Fuck you, assholes.
6:15 a.m.: Get up and shower to leave again.
7:15a.m.: Get into the car, and when dad asks why I'm grumpy, I say, ""I'm actually feelin sort of upset because I have to be so overly curteous of Elaine's bedtime and you guys were making the dog bark for table scraps at 5:00 this morning.""
My father's response: ""GOT DAMMNIT! YOU THINK YOU'RE JUST GOING TO FUCKING MOVE IN HERE AND RUN MY LIFE! WELL YOU HAVE ANOTHER GOD DAMNED THING COMING. NO ONE TELLS ME WHAT TO DO. NO ONE! ITS MY HOUSE AND MY RULES AND WE'LL MAKE AS MUCH GOD DAMNED NOISE IN THE MORNING AS WE WANT!!!!""
My response: Why do you get so upset and freak out like that? I asked you nicely. You don't need to get so mad. Maybe I'll just start throwing tantrums too. And then you guys will have to walk on eggshells to be silent and I can be as noisey as I want.
My father: blip blip blip NO ONE TELLS ME WHAT TO DO! blip blip blip blip GODDAMNIT!!! IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, GO LIVE WIHT YOUR MOTHER. IF YOU WANT TO LIVE HERE ON MY MONEY, YOU CAN PUT UP WITH WHATEVER NOISE WE MAKE.
Me: <crying> I don't see why you have to get so upset and be so mean. I really don't understand. I don't want to run your life. I don't care what you do. I just wish that in exchange for my silence you could at least not have the dog bark.
My father: YOU JUST CAN'T GET ALONG WITH ANYONE! NO ONE CAN FUCKING STAND YOU. YOU AND ELAINE ARE LIKE TWO CATS. YOU MAKE ME SICK.
Me: What do I do that's catty to Elaine?
My father: I didn't want to say anything because I""m not sure if you or your sister did it. But someone ate 4 of her cheese sticks the other day!!!
Me: Four of her cheese sticks? That's the most ridiculous thing I've yet heard. This is my being catty? I go out of my way to be nice to her all the time. I try to be friendly and kind and offer to help her with anything she's doing. She kind of hates me and I'm sorry for that, but I didn't eat any chese sticks.
My father: BLIP BLIP BLIP BLIP BLIP!!!!!
....have a good day at work.
7:30 a.m.: I get out of the car and stand there hoping that I'll stop crying before the mechanics with mullets show up for work.
7:45 a.m.: I realize that I'm due to start ragging any day now, and this is probably why I was so easily upset and still hysterical.
7:46a.m.: I laugh a lot at myself and stop crying. 
7:50a.m.: I get let in the building. I fix my hair, and start to work.
8:15a.m.: The manger comes in and starts to complain about the owner.
8:20a.m.: Some employee who was scheduled to start today calls in and says they won't be able to start until tomorrow.
9:30a.m.: The crazy owner comes in running and screaming aobut repairing buses versus repairing trucks.
9:45a.m.: I approach him calmly post-rant, and deliver message about said new employee. He blanches, is silent for a moment, and tells me to call this man back to tell him that we haven't any openings afterall and that he's very sorry. I call and do so, and the man is very angry because he quit his other job to start this one. I tell the owner who then blows it off.
10:00 a.m.: I am sent illegally to buy some squirt bottles from K-mart. The owner, whose english is not very good, calls them squeegee bottles and gets very upset when I don't understand what he's talking about.
Buy the squeegee bottles!
You mean brushes, like for car windows?
No, like to clean glass!
You want windex?
No, squeegee bottles!
He then goes on another mad crazy run around the autoshop to find said ""squeegee bottle"". It's actually a squirt bottle like you use to water flowers or wet hair.
Okay, off to K-mart I go.
10:05a.m. Can only find small squeegee bottles. None are the size that the owner had asked me to buy.
10:30a.m. I finally find one and head back to the store.
10:45a.m.: due to ineffeciancy and lack of communication, I become suddenly overly busy and work through lunch.
1:00p.m.: The owner says he's going out to buy 2 gals of oil, and does not return until 4. He also turns his cell phone off. Mysterious, ne?
2:00p.m.: You know, I don't really remember and am kind of bored of this.
Anyway, that was my night.
I have a coat now that I love.
I have a friend who does not understand that just because we're in different area codes it does not mean that calling me is long distance.  It is not long distance, or even toll.
I am afraid that I've turned into one of those girls who only bitches all the time.
My sincere condolences if I have."

First of all, happy birthday to <a href=""http://project2501.diaryland.com"">Ed</a>. His birthday was on the 19th. I sort of missed it. I apologized for having missed it on the day that his birthday actually was. Heh. My brain jumped the gun on my having felt I'd forgotten it.
So anyway.
Happy birthday Ed!

On other notes, hrm. I'm not too depressed yet. A little, but not too badly. Things are going okay. Tomorrow I start a job. Yes kids, a job. It actually sounds a little cool.
Some trucking company has, via Snelling Temporary Staffing, decided to make me their secretary. It's a temp to hire <coughs>position. It pays pretty decently.
But the cool part is that they don't care what I wear. Which means that they're probably also lax about the facial peircings/hair color.
Additionally, it's a ""loud"" environment, and so perhaps they'll allow me to play some music.

I miss my Chicago friends. Not that you were in over abundance or anything, or that I saw you all that regularly (with the exception of Sue) but really, I miss you. Which probably seems fishy to you all as I haven't been around to talk much, but really, I haven't felt much like talking.

Things are weird in Michigan. My father is trying to make my life as difficult as possible, think. But you know, fuck him. He'll learn to adjust to not being in charge of me, I think.

Otherwise, there's not a lot of news. I've met a couple cool new people. One of them is a cool person from before. Sort of. Hadn't seen them in a couple years and never much even when I did see them.

My good friend is supposed to be moving closer to me at the end of the month.

Yeah, things are okay. My dad's girlfriend keeps baking. Homemade bread, cake, cookies, candy, bread, cake, it's fucking amazing. I can't believe any one person has it in them to cook from scratch so often. I think she might be an alien. 

I'm going out to see a movie tonight. I'm looking forward to this. 

So on the note of the Joys of Sex. The cool new old friend reccomended I read Dune, and since he reminded me of my previous desire to read it, I went on a great hunt for it in my father's book collection downstairs. I found quite a few things that I wasn't expecting. The Story of O. A Nietchze translation. Zolar. Anne McAffrey. And yes, The Joys of Sex.
So you know, of course, me being me, I read it immediately.
I kind of liked it. For it was it's great. But certainly not without major flaw.
So here is my rundown of what's good and bad about it.
Good:
Everyone's a hippie and they out right stress the importance of body hair and body odor. They suggest that women do not shave, and that neither male nor female wear deodorant or use any fragranced soaps of any kind. At one point they suggest rubbing your fingers in your cunt, and then rubbing them behind your ears especially if you're about to go out dancing.  They're pretty uninhibted. They want you to try fucking your partner's armpits, and to use the big toe as an ""extra"" penis. It's all about accepting kinks and weird sex stuff. Don't freak out on your partner, try to find a middle road and indulge them.
Bad:
In several places they call homosexuality a ""hangup"".  Excuse me. You want me to let my partner fuck my armpit and put their toe into my twat, but it's not cool if I want to fuck people of the same gender? Hrm. Strange logic you kids have.
It's a pretty sexist book. It's like the Naomi Wolf brand of pseudo-feminism.  It asserts that.. well. I'm not going to go into the every instance because it'd be huge. But basically it depicts the woman as the happy and passive reciever with the complex incomrephensible sexuality who should work on instead please her mate visually by dressing however he wants, and also by losing weight if he so desires it (no, I don't think this is bitter fat-girl talk. I'm pretty sure that it's ridiculous to think the women needs to be the only weight-losing party.) It makes no mention that a man should alter his appearance or sexual perogative for a woman except to accept her ""kinks"". Also asserts that the good sex comes from a truely loving heterosexual union. And only there.
So yeah. The Joys of Sex. Very cool for what it was as far as ground breaking things go, but honestly. Not quite so cool as I would have hoped.
And on that note, I will leave you for tonight."

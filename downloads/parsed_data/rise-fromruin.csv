"event","Along the staircase,
I dream to hear you,
In a whisper quiet room,
Space for thinking,
Space to scream to,
But the echoes sound like you,
Not the stars at night,
In a pitch black sky,
I don't know just wants to see you
But the time is right and it only flies

"event","school sucked today. i think im changing to AP english or whatever the next level from honors is because my honors class is lame. and maybe move up to AP physics too. i just really need a challenge this year and the honors curiculum is basically the same as CP classes. so enough about school. amanda got the mustang today! finally she has a car she can call her own. she deserves it too. tomorrow mother is taking me shopping for shoes and bags. now im just waiting for tom to call and i have to do homework. ily baby<3

"event","honestly i didnt think id be this anxious about school starting tomorrow. i guess leaving a school for 2 years and then coming back is more nerve racking then i thought it would be. i was just wishing this weekend with tom would last forever. i love that boy and it sucks being so far away from him. but it sucks more that theres this other boy who likes me and i sorta have feelings for him too. so i have no idea what to do about this other kid.
either way school sucks, i have to wake up at 615, and im going to be shy as fuck this whole week."

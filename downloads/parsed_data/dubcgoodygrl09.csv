"event","I had a great time at a baby shower today. I went to my cuzin Julie's shower and I had a pretty good time. I won a candle, it smells like linen, and some hand wash from Bath & Body Works. They both smell real good. We played a game that is played by everyone starting off wit a baby diaper pin and if you say the word baby then someone who hears it gets your pin the one wit the most wins a prize and thats wat I won. We played other games but I don't want to talk bout them right now. My aunt and uncle have the best dog in the world, a HUSKEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's name was Thunder but it mostly lives outside and it was totally muddy, I didnt care though cause I'm an outside grl, I luv to camp, I camp bout 12 times a year, then we have a big trip that we plan in the summer. But I also had on good clothes so I didnt get to say Hi :(. I've been online for THE LONGEST TIME EVA!!!!!! 11 hours. Talkin to a boy that I luv. Jeremy!!! I dont know if i should break up wit my real boyfriend though. My brain right now has a light switch. On, off, on, off. But I think I'll make the right choice. We always talk bout our first kisses but, of course, i haven't eva had a first kiss cause I'm so fuckin shy. I hate being shy it turns my life around. I hate being me!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wish someone would help me get ova my shyness. But, he said once I have that first kiss I'll be fine. I wish! I think he's right though. He always is. He's perfect! Well tomorrow I don't have sckool, I'm so happy!!! FYI, I prob will be on the comp. all day talkin to Jeremy, a.k.a. Germy.......
                                Well i Luv All of Ya,
                                           Kelsey

"event","today was somewhat of a boring day except when i talked to this really cute guy i know, jeremy. hes so funny at school but sometimes when he gets online hes corney, but tats ok i still like him even though ialready have a boyfriend, andy. i went outside to breath fresh air once when i went down to my x sometin boyfriends granmas house, he still likes me but i dont like him, he gets really annoying sometimes. we played around outside down there played in the snow, played tag, but we usually play basketball, i love that sport, slamball is the koolest i wonder who won? riders or the m.o.b.. i've been tired not tired. i had cake, a cup cake, and lots of other sweets. like i said to jeremy i eat when i am bored so im never bored always up and out of my seat. ive been online for about 12 hours today and my fingers are almost numb from typing so much. wrigley, got in the trash can again. she came running down the hallway wit a paper cup in her mouth thinking i would'nt see it but shes dumb. she talks to me shes half tiger and horse and cat. she is the weirdest dog i've ever had. i got a bracelet at our school dance the other night from my boyfriend we had one dance cayuse the stupid dj's only played one slow song, that was mean. my friend summer was getting her groove on dancing all ova the place like she was drunk. but at the end some people were cring i have no clue y though. yesterday some of our friends and i were talkin bout how this slut grl ""michelle"" gets everything that she wants and that some rumor was that she was pregenant, from her boyfriend jon, like shes had sickness in the morn and she wasnt at school that other day. i hate her. every one hates her. she gets it all from her older cuz ashley. but ashley is cooler shes really great at basketball.

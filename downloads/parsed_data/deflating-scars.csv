"event","<font size=""-2"">Uncle Steve and his 'girlfriend' Anna are in jail.
This leaves all their rat pack in foster care unless
Mark, Sharon, Steve and I take them in.

I hate Uncle Steve.  I hate Anna.  I love...their kids.
::chokes back the tears::  One in particular.  Ashley.
She is so far the only girl in the pack, and she's the
oldest.  I love her to death.  And she could be mine
for awhile.  Her chance to stay IN SCHOOL.  Her chance
to be something and maybe I can teach her something
with her stay with me... 

Room?  We don't have a lot of room, but we do have a
couch and an inflatable mattress.  I do have food for them
and I do want this except I KNOW without a shadow of
a doubt that they will come to get them when they get out
and I'll miss Ashley.  Oi.  I'll take two babies and Ashley.
XD

I told Steve that I get dibs on Ashley.  She is the sweetest girl.

We might not though.  Steve's against it.  Cause he thinks
it's a waste of money and they'll get the kids back anyway.
I think this is Ashley's chance for something.


<b>Update</b><br>
March 15th 2009
She's mine.  We go to court on Monday March 16th 2009 for her parents to lose her for good.  She's my baby girl. ^_^

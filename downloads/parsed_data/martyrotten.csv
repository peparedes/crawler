"event","This will be my last LiveJournal entry for a while.  I may continue on this later on or find a new place to express myself but since nobody reads this anymore (and who can blame them?) I will close it down for now and leave my entries as they stand, chronicalling five years of my decline and fall, when I thought maybe I had some great things to say but realized that I don't know how to say them.  I can't go on about my problems and negativity forever.

I will close with lyrics of my favorite Leonard Cohen song.  I dedicate this to my friend Kathy whom I lost to cancer in 2003, who introduced me to Little Egypt and also to Leonard Cohen's work.



Come over to the window, my little darling,
I'd like to try to read your palm.
I used to think I was some kind of Gypsy boy
before I let you take me home.

Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began
to laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again.

Well you know that I love to live with you,
but you make me forget so very much.
I forget to pray for the angels
and then the angels forget to pray for us.

Oh so long, Marianne, it's time that we began
to laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again.

We met when we were almost young
deep in the green lilac park.
You held on to me like I was a crucifix,
as we went kneeling through the dark.

Oh so long, Marianne, it's time that we began
to laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again.

Your letters they all say that you're beside me now.
Then why do I feel alone?
I'm standing on a ledge and your fine spider web
is fastening my ankle to a stone.

Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began
to laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again.

For now I need your hidden love.
I'm cold as a new razor blade.
You left when I told you I was curious,
I never said that I was brave.

Oh so long, Marianne, it's time that we began
to laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again.


Oh, you are really such a pretty one.
I see you've gone and changed your name again.
And just when I climbed this whole mountainside,
to wash my eyelids in the rain!

Oh so long, Marianne, it's time that we began
to laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again."

"event","Till Victory (recorded by the Patti Smith Group, lyrics by Patti Smith)

Raise the sky. 
We got to fly over the land, over the sea. 
Fate unwinds and if we die, souls arise. 
God, do not seize me please, till victory. 

Take arms. Take aim. Be without shame 
No one to bow to, to vow to, to blame. 
Legions of light, virtuous flight. Ignite, excite. 

And you will see us coming, V formation, through the sky. 
Film survives. Eyes cry. 
On the hill, hear us call through a realm of sound. 
Oh, oh-oh. Down and down. 
Down and round, oh, down and round. 
Round and round, oh, round and round. 

Rend the veil and we shall sail. 
The nail, the grail: That's all behind thee. 
In deed, in creed, the curve of our speed. 
And we believe that we will raise the sky. 
We got to fly over the land, over the sea. 
Fate unwinds and if we die, souls arise. 
God, do not seize me please, till victory. 

Victory. Till victory. [repeat]"

"event","And I still feel the emptiness left by the loss of my Little Egypt.  Everybody has been really kind to me offering me support and encouragement.  But I feel alone, not alone exactly but that there's a big emptiness inside of me.  (How could that be when she was such a little cat?  She never got above ten pounds at most)  I know I did everything I could, and that there was no way I could have known there was something wrong at first, but I still have to guard against feelings of guilt, that I should have known sooner and acted sooner.  I hate myself anyway, more than usual, and I shouldn't hate myself at all.

I feel like I'll never be happy again."

"event","Little Egypt passed away this morning with the aid of the emergency vet. She was 17 years old.

I was with her at the end.  She ended up staying overnight at the hospital and around 6 p.m. she started having seizures.  By the time I had arrived at about 7 she'd had two.  I spend time with her petting and stroking her and talking to her and even though she was doped out from the valium they gave her, I think she knew I was there.  I could hear her purring after a while.

This morning I was going to take her to my regular vet but as it turned out, the vet told me there was no hope of recovery and I decided that I didn't want her to suffer anymore.  I had discussed this with the doctor on duty last night and somehow I knew that it would come to this.  They're still not sure what happened, whether the FIP virus she was carrying finally struck or if it was an undiagnosed brain tumor.  It was so sudden.

I hope the 17 years I spent with her were as happy for her as they were for me.  I always tried my best to care for her and loved her more than anything.  She was a very affectionate cat, with a decided mischievous streak that she never grew out of.   At the age of 17 she was almost as much a kitten as she was at three months when I first brought her home.  Through the good times and bad, I could not have asked for a truer more loving companion.  I will miss her very much."

"event","Little Egypt had to back to the emergency pet hospital today.  She went to the vet yesterday for a routine checkup and to have one of her glands cleaned out.  When I got her home she was walking kind of wobbly, which I first put down to the procedure.  As the day went on she was more listless and wobbly and had no appetite.  Early this morning I called the emergency pet hosptial and they told me I should bring here in.  They're not sure what happened but they think she had some kind of stroke or something since the legs on her left side are unsteady.  The doctor said it might have been stress from the procedure or any number of things.  (She's a 17 year old kitty.)  They're keeping her there today and I""m picking her up (hopefully) sometime tonight.  She'll be getting fluids and injections to try to turn it around.  

I should have taken her back to the vet yesterday when I first noticed it but I (stupidly) didn't think it was that serious at the time.  She usually sulks all day when I bring her home from the vet and it wasn't until the evening that I realized something was probably wrong.  Even then, I'd hoped that she'd recover on her own, but she's not as resiliant as she used to be and I never expected anything like this.

I will keep you posted on how she is."

"event","Not much to add today.  Still fighting negativity and feeling lonely.  <sigh>  Well I can't expect everyone to stop their lives for me.  I can't be needy and clingy because I've had people be that way with me and it's draining for both sides.  It's hard to make new friends, I often find out too late that they weren't really friends at all.  I try not to be cynical but...

And work? Well I""m learning new software so they can have more people helping to pay the bills.  It's really complicated but if I get more chance to practice it should go all right.  What I hate is getting up an hour early ugh.  I was going to have a vacation this year but I cancelled it for the training.  It was all my idea since I didn't want to be behind when I came back.  That happened to me once already and I hate feeling out of the loop.  I need to spend my spare time more constructively anyway.  Try more drawing and writing and less feeling down and hating myself.  

And eventually find a way to move out of L.A., or at least find a better and bigger place to live.  So much I want to change and it's not happening quickly enough.  I hate being patient but I have to be. <sigh>"

"event","Today I'm focusing on live albums.  Good live albums give a snapshot of a time and place and give the sense of what a group or performer can do live and onstage.  The problem with a lot of live albums is that they're usually thrown hurredly together to satisfy a contractual obligation, or to cover for a lack of new material (such as with the Rolling Stones or the Grateful Dead) or are postumous recordings showcasing a dead artist's most embarassing moments in order to make a quick buck from his or her name.  I like these because they flow well, have a minimum of overdubbing and have had them for a long time. (well most of them anyway).

Yardbirds-Live Yardbirds (at the end of their career, with Jimmy Page)
Elvis Costello-Live at El Mocambo (also worth finding, the Live at Hollywood High e.p. three songs but worth it for Watching the Detectives alone)

"event","Since I've been nothing but negative I thought maybe I'd be better off just posting about things I like (which is why I won't post anything about Los Angeles).  Since I love music, but can't play anything, I thought I'd share with whoever is still reading this, my top 100 favorite albums.  This may not be as interesting as when Rolling Stone did it a few years back but it might give some of you some ideas as to what to look for when shopping for CDs, or something to download.  As a rule I've left off compilation albums, ""Greatest Hits"" collections (with the exception of Dame Darcy) and live albums.  I will probably post a second list of live albums since I usually have nothing better to do, but that will be for another time.  Here I am including works by primarily individual artists or groups.  Also, I made a cutoff time.  No albums released within the last two years are eligible.  This gives the newer stuff time to ferment.  :)

In order to do that I'll have to change my life (of course).  As I mentioned before, I don't really think of January as the New Year since the solar cycle isn't really complete until March, as is the pagan practice.  I see this mostly as the beginning of the end of the old year and a time to change what needs to be changed, improve what needs to be improved and discard what needs to be discarded.

Hopefully I'll be more active here in the future.  And if it is your custom to start the year now....Happy New Year!!!!"

"event","Well things are a little better now.  I shouldn't get like that but I do.  The Holidays are when I get especially lonely.  The people I want to hear from I rarely do and the ones I don't want to deal with are the ones I end up dealing with almost every day.   I miss everybody. <sigh> well on to positive things.

Last Thursday was the Winter Solstice (and it was actually cold this year!) which is what Christmas was originally based upon.

I went with my two neighbors (my friend next door and the other guy who I can't stand) to the Knitting Factory on Hollywood Blvd. to see Sky Saxon and the Seeds.  The Seeds were the biggest band in L.A. during the mid 60s but never made it too big nationally.  They were on a small label (GNP Crescendo) that was primarily a jazz label and didn't seem to know how to manage or promote a rock and roll act.  Their only nationwide hit was ""Pushin' Too Hard"" but they had some local hits with ""Mr. Farmer"" and ""Can't Seem to Make you Mine""  Sky Saxon was their lead singer and principal songwriter and it's only recently that I've come to realize how influential he was.  I do believe that the Doors took a lot of their sound from the Seeds. (Jim Morrison sings a lot like Sky Saxon) and they also had a major influence over what was later known as punk rock. (Punk Rock was a term that originally applied to the 60s garage bands like the Seeds and the Electric Prunes and other bands who were part of the mid 70s ""Nuggets"" compilation...but that's another story.)  I even think that current groups like White Stripes, the Strokes and the Vines have elements of the Seeds in their sound.   The original Seeds broke up after recording six albums and Sky Saxon went to Hawaii for a few years before returning to L.A. and Playing with various bands, including new versions of the Seeds.

It was a great show.  Sky is a bit more spacy these days but still an excellent performer.  He mostly did his older stuff (which is disappointing. I know that's what most of the audience came to hear but I'd heard his last two albums, ""Red Planet"" and ""Transparency"" and they had some really good stuff on them.)  He had people coming up on stage and dancing with him and banging tambourines and stuff while he and the band did their thing.   We all went dressd up in sixties type clothes, very colorful ones (Sky Saxon said his major contribution was to bring color into music).  I had on a multi colored jacket and a headband with stars and moons on it, along with love beads purchased from Maya on Melrose.  (ahh L.A. lol)

There were a lot of youner people there which was encouraging.  I know there's a lot of younger kids into the Beatles (yeaaay!) and I guess, like with me, that many of them go from there to explore other sounds from the 60s as well.  (My obnoxious neighbot started haranguing some of them about how much he hates rap, which I thought was pretty bogus.  Who says you can't like rap too?  I like a lot of stuff.  True I get tired of hearing nothing but rap wherever I go but still.....)   This is also good since many forgotten talents, like Sky Saxon, will finally get the recognition they deserve.  

If you haven't done so. I recommend you check the Seeds out.  Their music is upbeat and positive and very condusive to the good feelings one likes to associate with the 60s counter culture.  Their albums WEB OF SOUND and FUTURE (their ""psychedelic"" album"") are good places to start.  Or if you want to download first start with ""Pushing Too Hard' ""Mr Farmer"" and ""Can't Seem to Make You Mine"" then go on to ""Evil Hoodoo"" ""Flower Lady and Her Assistant"" ""Travel With Your Mind"" and the epic ""Up in Her Room"" (and the other epic ""900 Million People Daily, All Making Love"" where Sky decides to show Morrison and crew how it's really done.)"

I almost miss the old days when crooks actually had to look you in the eye when they robbed you.  Hell who needs to take the risks of sticking someone up when you can use some high tech gadget to rob someone's account when they're not even there.  I wonder if they caught the guy who did it.  I hope they hold him for me I'd like to give him just one good punch in the stomach and a few good kicks in the groin and....

Somehow this WORTHLESS WASTE OF SPACE (WHO IS GOING TO DIE HORRIBLY ONCE I GET MY HANDS ON HIM!!!) managed to get ahold of my pin number and make or obtain a counterfeit ATM card and use it to DRAIN MY BANK ACCOUNT!!

FOUR BOGUS TRANSACTIONS TOTALLING  $836.00 (INCLUDING SERVICE CHARGES) all various Bank of America locations (two in West L.A., One in Sun Valley and one in Canyon Plaza, wherever that is.)  So now the bank's deactivated my ATM card and sending me a new one while investigating how this could have happened. But now I have NO MONEY because some ASSHOLE DECIDED TO RIP OFF OTHERS INSTEAD OF EARNING HIS OWN GODDAMN MONEY!!!  I had some coins in a jar for the weekend and an overtime check coming soon but I also have three more bills I have to pay this month and am still not sure how safe my money is.  I'd like to know how this ASSHOLE WHO'S GOING TO DIE HORRIBLY!!!! got my ATM card.  I've heard that some of these WORTHLESS SCUMBAGS attach these reading devices to ATM machines that look normal but steal your information so they can rip you off.  Beware of ATM machines.

"event","A week and a half ago I travelled by bus, one warm Friday evening, to the Forum in Inglewood California to see Mr. Bob Dylan!!!!!! 

Wow! What a kick ass show that was!! He started off with a radically altered blues arrangement of Maggie's Farm and went into It's All Right Ma, I'm Only Bleeding.  Whenever he does his classic stuff he always reworks it to redefine it for himself and his audience.  A lot of people dont' like this but Dylan has always wanted his audiences to meet him half way any how.  Besides, he's never wanted to be a nostalgia act (and anyone who doesn't like that should spend 500 bucks and go see the Rolling Stones)

Anyway, he was in fine voice (for him) that night and spent all night at the keyboards, I don't think he even touched a guitar all night but no matter, he had a kick ass band behind him.  I think it's the same guys who played on his latest album Modern Times (which I recommend highly.)  And speaking of which, he did about four or five songs off of his new album, to the great enthusiasm of the audience, which I think was enhanced by the smoke that was floating around the Forum (I myself stuck to beer that night.)  including my favorite, the Chuck Berry esque THUNDER ON THE MOUNTAIN.  He finished with LIKE A ROLLING STONE and the lights came on for the audience during the chorus.   A wonderful show all around.  (Oh, and the opening act the Kings of Leon rocked too.)  I bought three t shirts, one pyschedelic looking one from the official souvenier venders and two bootleg ones in the parking lot (I know, shame on me.  But Ten bucks a piece is a good deal after paying 30 bucks for one inside).  There was a very diverse crowd too, People from the 60s were there with kids whose parents probably weren't born when Dylan first made his recording debut.  

During the show, I couldn't help thinking of my late friend Kathy since she was really into Dylan (and Jackson Browne too btw) and I almost felt like she was with me for the show.  Maybe in some way she was. 

It took me all night to get home.  I got a bus to Downtown and rode the train to Hollywood.  I was exhausted by the time I got home but had all day Saturday to rest.

Overall, a fantastic evening."

"event","Well after years of vaguely promising myself this, I fingally got a new mattress for my bed. Since we got a nice bonus from the Union (retractive pay raise from last year) I thought I'd spend the money and get a real good one.  It's similar to the Sealy ones although it's the house brand from Mattress Gallery (didn't want to spend TOO much you know) with a firm but plush pillow top.  Bit higher than my old one (which was about as comfortable as a lumpy tortilla) but really comfortable.

"event","Last night I went to see Vashti Bunyan play at the Echo, a small nightclub/bar on Sunset Blvd. in the middle of Echo Park,not very far from where I'd lived when I first moved back to L.A. on my own, 20 years ago! The neighborhood hasn't changed much, still predominantly Mexican with a touch of bohemianism to it, pretty much like I remember although gentrification has been making inroads into it.

But back to Vashti Bunyan.  First some background: Ms. Bunyan started off in the early to mid 60s as one of hundreds of ""girl singers"" of the time.  She was managed by Rolling Stones' manager Andrew Loog Oldham who had her record her minor hit ""Somethings Just Stick In Your Mind"" (which was originally intended for Marianne Faithful)  This is when she developed her wispy breathless singing style that she became known for.   Shortly after this she recorded a few more singles, becoming increasingly folk oriented.  A heartbreaking affair inspired three songs including the beautiful ""Winter is Blue"" (She said at the show last night that she'd recently met the guy who broke her heart and saw what a lucky escape she'd made.  I know how that feels lol.)  She met another and fell in love during the late 60s and had decided to leave London at the time.  This leads to a fascinating part of the story as she and her boyfriend (and two dogs) spent a year and a half trekking across the countryside of England and Scotland to the Outer Hebrides in a horse drawn brightly painted Gypsy wagon.  I remember reading an interview with her a few months ago where she talks about this and it sounds like such a fascinating adventure.  Along the way she stayed at some land owned by her grandfather, returned briefly to London and recorded the album JUST ANOTHER DIAMOND DAY, which was based on the first half of the journey.   The album didn't do very well at first but has recently gained attention since then.  (Several UK magazines have included it on their ""Top 100"" albums lists)  I personally recommend the album greatly. (The album also features playing by Dave Swarbick and SImon Nicol from one of my all time favorite bands, Fairport Convention)
This year she released her follow up album, LOOKOAFTERING,36 years later after her children had grown up and left home, giving her a flash of inspiration.  She has seperated from the man she traveled with since then and lives in the city again (London I think, I'm not sure.  One of her children lives in Los ANgeles I know.) 

She did a great show.  The years have been very kind to her as well as she is probably lovlier now than she was in her younger mod/hippie days.  She had a great band with her too, guitarist banjo, a girl on keyboards and flute (and African finger piano) a cellist a fiddler and Ms. Bunyan herself on guitar and singing.  She did a good selection of her two albums and sounded great.  The place was packed too (I'm sure she's surprised that she had so many fans in the U.S.) There were a lot of hippie types there and it was a pretty mellow crowd.  (One girl showed up carrying a guitar on her back and brought her dog with her! Such a sweet doggie too and very well behaved considering the crowd.  He did bark once during the set to the amusement of Vashti and the crowd)  Shes touring the U.S. and parts of Canada and is worth seeing if you get a chance to.

The opening act, Nobody and the Mystic Chords of Memory were pretty good too.  They played this kind of psychelic folk rock with some really spacy effects.  I'm going to look for their CD at Amoeba. (They had it for sale at the show but I'd already bought Vashti's latest CD there and wanted to save my money for beer. lol sorry guys!)

Well that was actually a good weekend for once.  ANd speaking of concerts, I'm going to have to try and get my ticket for Bob Dylan at the Forum next month.  (it's a long bus ride from Hollywood I know, but it's BOB DYLAN!) and also the Damned at the House of Blues in November so I'll have some more concerts to write about later on. 

(So far this year: Faun Fables at the Troubadour last April, Acid Mothers Temple at Knitting Factory last May, Nina Hagen at House of Blues last July and Vashti Bunyan at the Echo last night.)"

"event","All right so it turns out that the biggest mistake was going back there in the first place.  I don't even know what I was thinking by returning to that room.  Maybe that things have changed?  Maybe that everybody would take my side?  Maybe I felt responsible somehow and that I had to fix it? I can't fix it. It's beyond my control.  I've done all I can for Denise and she's not interested in being my friend anyway anymore.  I was telling my therapist that being forgiving doens't mean inviting negativity (or something like that) but that's exactly what I did, what I've been doing all my life and bringing users and parasites into my life. 

If Denise or anyone else wants to talk they know my Email address and I'll be glad to answer any questions that they might have.  I will not answer accusations though or put up with abuse.  I've put up with more than enough in my life.

As for the accusation? It doesn't worry me.  I know I've done nothing wrong and anybody who knows that, and is truly my friend, would know that too.  Therefore, I have no need to prove myself to people who were obviously never my friends to begin with.  I'd rather spend time with my real friends, who I've been sorely neglecting, and things and people that I care about.

I wash my hands of Denise and all the rest of them.  There is no room for users or parasites in my life anymore.

"event","SO being in a somewhat forgiving mood lately I thought I'd drop in on the chat room where my ""friend"" who accused me of being the same as the snert hung out.  I was wondering about the other players that I'd gotten to know and how they were doing.  Well I know sooner get there then I get suspended. Why? Ask Denise! was the answer (that was my ""friend's"" name.) so it turns out that almost the entire staff of that room and God knows who else believes that b.s. that she told them.  So now at least I know how I stand with them.  But I'm feeling all angry and hateful all over again. I knew most of these people, including the room's founder longer than I'd known Denise and you'd think maybe one of them would stick up for me or at least convince her of her mistake.  But NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!  

I mean to be accused of something so vile and disgusting as to pretend to be someone's friend just to harrass them.  And have so many others believe that I'd do something like that.  These are the kind of ""friends"" we meet online?

Well fuck all of them!

Why do I do stuff like that anyway?  <sigh> I'm such an idiot.

At least I still have one or two friends that I can count on.  I need to put this whole mess behind me now."

I kept getting these annoying pop ups and windows indicators about my computer not being protected.  I ended up stupidly downloading a ""spyware protector"" that turned out to be bogus and led to more pop up ads.  My Spy Sweeper kept showing the ""trojan-conhook"" and I couldn't find any way to get rid of it. So Friday Night I stayed up most of the night doing a System Restore and reinstalling all my software.

This has happened before but this was one time too many.  One thing that has occured to me is that I'm really really tired of spending all this time on the Internet and online.  I never feel like I have much of a life at all.  I have met a few good people but have also met some that were really terrible.  Much of what's on the web is junk unless there's something in particular you're looking for.  And even then it's become more of a chore to find it.  I'm going to spend a lot less time online in the future.  I will check in to read and answer whatever email I get and will keep in touch with the people who mean something to me.  But I've been without a life and need to get one and not have the computer be my only contact with the world."

"event","I went to Tower Records to meet one of my favorite groups from my teen years, The New York Dolls, there are only two of the original members left alive now, David Johansson (who, during the 80s was also known as Buster Poindexter) and Sylvain Sylvain.  The New York Dolls were a ragged glam band from New York (of course) who wore trashy drag and played rough sounding bluesy Rolling Stones inspired songs.  They only did two albums and then broke up (I have both albums plus a Japanese ""Greatest Hits"" collection)  Two of them, Johnny Thunders and Jerry Nolan formed the Heartbreakers, (not to be confused with Tom Petty's band) both of them later died of drug related problems during the 90s.  Arthur Kane rejoined the other two original Dolls two years ago when they did a reunion show at the behest of MOrrisey before he passed away from leukemia.   The New York Dolls were a major influence over the development of what was to be known as punk rock.  Groups such as the Ramones, The Sex Pistols, The Clash and other bands too numerous to mention have named the Dolls as an influnces (another band that was influenced by them was Hard Rock veterans Aerosmith.)  So this was  a once in a lifetime opportunity.  I got there by seven last Friday, (Tower Records being ""there"") and bought their new CD and lined up for the show.  They did mostly their newer stuff.  They did finish their set with Looking For a Kiss and Personality Crisis from their 1973 debut album.  Afterward we all had to go back outside and line up for the autographs.  After waiting hours (ugh!) I finally got my autographs.  Most of the band signed the CD but I also brought along my Japanese album just for David and Sylvain to sign.  They were surprised to see that one, I don't thiknk they'd ever seen it before, or maybe they didn't think anybody in Japan had ever heard of them. I don't know.  But there were really cool (a lot of people had bootlegs and unauthorized albums that they didnt' get paid for but they signed them anyway.)  I listened to their new album the next day at work (Someday It Will Please Us to Remember Even This is the title) and I think that most of it's classic stuff.  Iggy Pop and REM's Michael Stipe guested on two songs but the big surprise was the bonus track Seventeen which featured guest guitarist Bo Diddley himself. (!)  I hope the Dolls tour the U.S. or at least do a show out here because I'd love to see them do a full concert!! 

The only thing I dind't like was Tower.  I don't think I'll go to anymore events there again.  It took us way too long to get our autographs and they basically treated us like a bunch of sheep.  Elitisit Hollywood attitude.  The Dolls were cool but the Tower Records staff bugged me.  I've been to performacnces and signings at Amoeba and they were much quicked and went much smoother.  Still it was a kick overall seeing the New York Dolls and getting their autographs."

I'm taking Ibuprofin and Amoxicaillin as well as two blasts of nasal spray twice a day to fight off a sinus infection.  Taking the amoxicillin made me a bit nervous because that was what I gave Little Egypt about a year ago that made her so incredibly sick that day.  I guess it didn't effect me all that much.

I'm pissed off though!  I get a nice little letter from my union with a ""Strike AUthorization Vote"" ballot inside.  I returned it with a no vote.  First of all, I can't afford to go on strike and it would be too much of a disruption to my life.  Second, Governer Schwartenegger is just the type to emulate that other talentless hambone actor who turned to politics because his movies sucked and fire everybody on strike just to show his corporate overlords what a tough guy he is, and this especially plays well during an election year.  I've gone through too much to get this job to lose it all on some stupid strike.

We've been a year without a contract and, as the Union tells us, in the rare occasions that one of them actually visits the worksite, the Governor wants to increase our employee contributions to our health plans, not give us a raise and take away two or our holidays.  Of course I'm sick of the GOvernor's b.s. in regards to blaming state workers for the state's financial woes but I'm also pissed that the Union seems to be champing at the bit to go on strike without trying to find some other alternatvie through this. (Hello!!!! Binding Arbitration?!!!  Legal action?!!! Come on! What's a strike gonna do? We're not coal miners!!!!!)  Of course I didn't know we'd been without a contract for a year until two months ago when a union rep graced us with her presence, gave a canned speech and half assed answers to the members' questions and concerns.  

I have always been supportive of unions and labor organizations.  However, I'm beginning to doubt whether or not the one I'm a member of (yeah, I always pick the winners) even knows or cares about how their decisions effect is members.

So things are REALLY looking up now!  Next winter I'll hope that new year is evern WORSE than its predecessor.  That way I won't be disappointed."

I have a lot of trouble making friends.  I always manage to say or do the wrong thing that leads people to think I""m mental or something.  I don't like myself very much either so it's hard for me to get anyone else to like me.  I told someone earlier this week that I felt like this was a new start and a new beginning and I think, at least at the start, that I'd like to be alone for a while.  If I try to make friends too quickly and desperately, then I end up with users and people who just want me to be a stooge.  I don't need that.  I need to feel better about myself and start doing the things I've been wanting to do.  It's hard to do it alone but I have no other choice.  I'll still keep in contact with my online friends and also Mike and Hiromi of course.    To the few of you who read this.  I'm not going to cut myself off entirely.  If you write me I will answer.

Some people at my work get it in their Outlook and some do not.  I think it depends on who and where some of their email comes from.  Our Internet access is severely restricted.  I do get a lot of it at home of course, even with AOL's ""Spam Filter""  Most of it is ""Refinance Your Home"" (I rent) or ""Live College Girls Dorm Room Cam!"" (Yeah, I want to watch a bunch of girls in ratty bathrobes with their hair in curlers put cold cream on their acne and clip their toenails while studying for their midterms.) But nothing too exciting.  Lately at work, however, I""ve been getting some really bizarre emails in my Spam folder.  It's not so much the subject (I never open any of them). The sender names are what makes them really bizarre.  They seem like something out of Monty Python or Mad Magazine.  Either these senders are from another planet or they have a very strange sense of humor.

Here is a list of the best ones that I have so far:

Dastardly V. Constituent
Cassava C. Customs
Phelan Singleton

"event","My friend has finally showed me her ""inciminating proof"".  It turns out that somebody posted a hateful message on her website's guest book and his IP Address matched mine.   She was saying that this guy was using the same computer as me so therefore he's me!  I only left one message on that board, and a congratulatory one which I signed my own name to.  This guy didn't even have the guts to put his own name just ""You Know Who I Am"".

As far as I can figure, an IP Address reflects the computer hub you dial when you sign on.  I think maybe it has to do with access numbers but I'm not sure.  My post and the other guy's are a month apart and I did change my Access number during that time.  I don't know, my knowlege of computers in limited.

I really shouldn't have to prove myself to someone who's been a longtime friend though.  Even if I do forgive her, things between us will never be the same again.  I feel like I've lost another friend and it's hardest when that person is still around but lost to me just the same.  I don't know why things like this have to happen."

"event","I hope some day I'll have some positive things to talk about.

I can forgive just about anything except betrayal.  If I trust someone and they betray me then I can never trust them again.  I've trusted people in the past and been betrayed too many times for me to forgive.  So you can imagine how much it hurts to be accused of betrayal by someone who's called me her ""best friend"". Especially when that accusation is wrong.

I've shared a lot with this person, and often listened to her troubles and tried to help as best as I could.  I always thought we'd be there for one another.  Wednesday night I got the shock of my life when I logged on and was getting the cold shoulder and then proceeds to as much as tell me that everything I've said and done has been nothing but a lie to her.

We met in an AOL trivia chat room.  Unfortunately there was this other guy who used to come in there and cause trouble, a real sicko who for some reason or another started stalking this ""friend"" of mine and harrassing her.  He finally got banned from the room and continued stalking her.  No matter how many times she'd change screen names and report him to AOL he would always find her and bug her.  AOL of course did little or nothing about it. 

Okay, so Wednesday, after a particularily frosty greeting, she tells me that she's somehow come across some evidence that this guy is using my computer(!)  Not only that but, and this is after a dozen sarcastic comments, she tells me that she thinks this stalker and me are one and the same person! WHAT!! If I have a problem with someone I tell them straight out and if I dont' like someone I don't talk to them, and that's all.  I see no reason to continually harrass someone.  Of course, being a true and loyal friend, upon seeing this ""evidence"" she automatically assumes the worst, throwing away nearly two years of friendship.  I asked to see this evidence and she tells me that she's got legal advice not to show it to me.  Legal advice?!! What the F.........?!!!! 

Well I signed off shortly after that, before I said something we'd both regret.

So what lesson have we learned today? Never help anyone! Think only of yourself!!! Selfishness gets a bad rap but it's pretty much a survival skill in this day and age.

Okay, maybe that's a bit harsh.  I will help any of my friends, my true friends, whenever and however I can.  I don't expect them to fall on their knees and be grateful to me but on the other hand I don't expect or appreciate being stabbed in the back when I offer my friendship to someone.

That, in itself, is betrayal."

I really do try to be strong but it's so hard sometimes when everything seems to be against me and against people I care about.

"event","Okay, so where does this leave me?  I've seen three people die from serious illnesses, Kathy from cancer and also the mother of a close friend of mine, who also died of cancer and most recently the brother of my friend Steve, who died himself unexpectedly last year, who finally lost his battle with Cystic Fibrosis.    What does this have to do with me? (Why is it always about me anyway?)

People have told me to learn the lessons that these people taught me. But what have I learned? These people faced their lives and passings with dignity and courage that should have been an inspiration to me that honored their lives and their memories.  But instead I throw childish tantrums over some of the most petty and ridiculous things and go through life with this over inflated sense of entitlement that I find repulsive in others.  And so I find it repulsive in myself.  I don't think I've realized this before.

I never grieved for Steve or Kathy or anybody, not really.  A few tears here and there and increasing depression after that.  Mostly it was in terms of how i effected me.  I'd wish misfortune on people I hated because I thought it was unfair that people I loved were dying.  Kathy always looked for the best in everybody and Steve always tried to see the positive side of everything.  What have I learned about life from them? Nothing! How have I celebrated their lives.  I haven't.  I've been petty and selfish, self pitying, self centered self involved and utterly spiteful.  I've allowed my love to turn to hate.  I've dishonored them by some cheap wanting for revenge.  Like somehow their deaths need to be balanced somehow.  It cheapens life.  

That's the main reason I hate myself.  I came to realize that recently last week.  I don't deserve to feel good about myself or about anything.  I want to change  I don't know how to change.  I need to get serious about it.  I need help.

I want to stop being hateful to myself and to others."

"event","I recently heard from the parents of my late friend, Steve, that his brother, Andy has recently passed away as well.  Andy had spent forty years valiantly struggling agains cystric fibrosis, an hereditary illness that attacks the lungs and makes breathing next to impossible sometimes.  It can be quite painful and people who have it aren't usually expected to live very long.  Thanks to his tenacity and courage, as well as new advances in treatment, Andy managaed to live way past everybody's epectations.  He finally succumbed to complications from a lung infection that resulted in pneumonia.

I didn't know him as well as I'd liked.  Mostly I knew him through his brother, Steve, who I was close friends with for many many years.  (Steve was adopted so he didnt' inherit CS).  They were very close brothers, and Steve was often very proud of Andy's achievements.  I remember also, that Andy, like Steve, had a good sense of humor.  He was also an accomplished artist as well, having painted since he was a child. (He was selected to paint a mural at the Santa Monica Municipal Airport when he was a teenager, which was up for many years before it was finally painted over.) He was also into computers (Macs especially) before any of the rest of us.  I always envied the closeness he and Steve had and wished I could have had that with my brother, who I was never very close to.

I will call his mom tomorrow sometime.  I feel especially sad for his parents, losing both their sons little over a year apart.  It's always a tragedy for parents to outlive their children.  I feel the loss myself as he was very much part of my life as well.

And, this is kind of silly, I can imagine Andy and Steve riding around Heaven in a Rambler Metropolitan (Steve was really into cars) together again as brothers should be.

I will miss both of you."

"event","Okay, that last post was way too negative.  It just seems like everything's going wrong for me and most everyone I care about.  I had such high hopes for this year and the first month everything seems to go to Hell.  My two therapist appointments that I had set for January were cancelled and the third one wasn't that great.  I have one next week so I hope that works out better.  I need to be more open with her, there's stuff I haven't mentioned at all. <sigh>  

Also, my two Saturdays in which I planned to work overtime had to be cancelled. Once because of construction in that horrible building that we've been stuck in for a year and this Saturday I helped my friend by keeping his kids occupied while his band played at this Japanese community center. (that was actually kind of fun so that wasn't so bad.  Those kids are a handful though, especially the youngest.  Thye love their ""Uncle Marty"" though.) and last Friday I just found out that they're only going to have two nights of overtime from now one, along with Saturday.

Of course if I wasn't so stupid, I'd have money left over from all the overtime and work I put in last year. I'm terrible at saving money.  I'm determined at least to have more by this time next year.

Otherwise, <sigh> I hate myself. I hate the world and dont' want to deal with it anymore.  That sucks I know.  I dont' want to feel this way and I don't want to be so negative everytime I write in here or talk to people.  No wonder hardly anyone ever wants to talk to me."

One of my biggest problems is that I put things off and end up not getting anything done and falling back into my old rut and my old habits.  Then I get frustrated, depressed and really really down on myself.  That will need to change.

I've alreday started, in a way, when I went to get treatment for my depression last fall.  However, my appointments with the therapist have been few and far between (that's the HMO system for you).  I""ll keep seeing the one I""m going to now, I really like her, but if I can't do it more frequently I may have to look elsewhere.

Also, I need to start doing what I like and not what other think they'd like for me to do.  I""m the only one who really should have any say in my life.  I""m open to suggestions of course, but the decisions are ultimately mine.  I need to be patient and not expect things to change overnight. Changing your life is often difficult and takes a lot of hard work sometimes.  

I am trying to be hopeful.  I know that none of my friends would have wanted me to be depressed and despondant all the time and that's pretty much how I""ve felt.  I need to like myself and not tear myself to bits when I do make mistakes, because I am going to make mistakes.  A friend once wrote about facing the future with open arms and an open heart and while I may not be quite ready to do that yet, I do try to keep that in mind.

"event","Well my Thanksgiving weekend has been going really well so far, surprisingly.  Yesterday I spent most of the day sleeping since I didn't really have anywhere to go.  My friend Mike took his wife Hiromi and two kids to Japan to visit his in laws so I didn't have dinner with them like I usually do.  But that's okay because I was just where I wanted to be yesterday.  I slept until three, getting up only once or twice to go to the bathroom and feed Little Egypt.  At three I drank some coffee, ate leftover spaghetti and watched a Bonanza rerun. fun fun fun.  Last night I saw the new Harry Potter movie, which I enjoyed as well.

Today was busy.  I went to see the MASTERS OF AMERICAN COMIC ART exhibits at the Hammer Museum in Westwood where I saw reproductions and original art of famous newspaper cartoonists.  Featured were:
WIndsor McKay-A pioneer in animation and comic strip art whose comic strips seemed to be mostly preoccupied with dreams.  He's most famous for his landmark strip LITTLE NEMO IN SLUMBERLAND and for his masterful illustration.
I forgret what his name was but he drew KINDER KIDS and WEE WILLIE WINKIE two rather surreal fantasy/humor strips that I'd love to see more of.
One of my favorites was featured as well George Herriman's KRAZY KAT which had a relatively simple premise, the mouse throws bricks at the cat out of malice but the cat intreprets the bricks as love, the dog, also a policeman, arrests the mouse for throwing the bricks because he's in love with the cat.   The way he wrote and drew, especially on the full page Sunday strips is what really makes the strip appealing.  
The first three were from around the turn of the century up through the 20s and 30s and are amazaingly similiar with the Dada and Surrealist movements that were developing at the time in Europe.

Also featured was E.C. Segar's POPEYE, which is way different from the cartoons that most people grew up watching, at least when Segar was drawing it..  Look for reprints of these strips at the library or bookstore sometime.  Also there was Miton Caniff's TERRY AND THE PIRATES and STEVE CANYON who I never really got into all that much, too military for my tastes, Chester Gould's DICK TRACY one of the first strips to bring realistic crime to the comics page coupled with a unique expressionistic style that has won him international acclaim. (later strips stayed with the crime drama format but added some elements of Science Fiction as well.) Frank King's GASOLINE ALLEY was also included (one of the few in which the characters aged in real time instead of staying the same age for fifty plus years) and finally, for the Hammer show anyway, Charles Schulz's PEANUTS one of the first of the modern strips that brought minimalistic art to the comics page as well as lonliness and alienation. (Franz Kafka would have identified greatly with Charlie Brown.)  Part two, the comic book artists, was all the way downtown at the Museuam of COntemporary Art, good thing the busses were running and that, miraculouisly, traffic on Wilshire wasn't so bad.

So I got downtown by 2.30 for the MOCA show. which mostly concentrated on comic books.  First off was Will Eisner's THE SPIRIT.  The Spirit was a masked crimefighter who wore only a mask, along with a regular suit and tie and had no real secret identity.  ALso rare was that he ran in the newspapers but not as a regular comic strip. He had his own section in the papers where Eisner were draw and write 8 page stories that alternated between grim crime drama and humorous satire and parody.  Eisner later pioneered what became known as the ""Graphic Novel"" with books about life among Jewish Urban dwellers in the 30s and 40s.
Jack Kirby was featured also, another great favorite of mine.  He was one of the most influential comic artists of his day, especially for his work in the 60s for Marvel, where he created and develeoped FANTASTIC FOUR, CAPTAIN AMERICA (which he originalted in the 40s to fight the Nazis). THOR and the HULK among others.  His work was very dynamic and brought an epic sweep to comics that many have tried to match but haven't quite made it.
Harvey Kurtzman was featured also, even though he was more of a writer. He's best known for creating MAD (later known as MAD MAGAZINE) whiere with the help of artitsts such as Bill Elder, Wally Wood and Jack Davis he savagely parodied popular comic strips and later movies, tv shows and aspects of everyday modern life.  His work was a primary influence over many underground cartoonists of the 60s most notably Robert Crumb who was also featured.  SO much has been written about Crumb, analyzing the psychological aspects of his dark humored violent fantasies and praising his great illustrative skills.  All I can say is that he's one of my all time favorite comic artists (along with Schulz and Kirby) and it was really a kick seeing his original art boards of stories I'd been reading since I was 16 (the same is true for pretty much all of them. I'd seen a lot of the strips and stories by these guys reprinted many times but seeing them in their original form was really something else.) There was also Chris Ware, a newer artist famous for THE ADVENTURES OF JIMMY CORRIGAN and Gary Panter, an L.A. Punk cartoonist who's crudely original JIMBO has also won high acclaim.  The last exhibit I looked at was by Art Speigelman. Speigelman during the 60s and 70-s did strips that played around with the very format of the comic strip, using paste ups and cut outs in what I call ""visual sampling"".  He's best known for his straightforward narrative graphic novel MAUS,  MAUS was an expansion of an earlier story he did based on his father's experiences as a Jew in Nazi Germany.  The Jews are depicted as mice and the Nazis as cats.  The two volumes that comprise MAUS have caused many to rethink the idea of comics as ""kids' stuff"".  His most recent work was IN THE SHADOW OF NO TOWERS about living in New York after 9/11.

It was a pretty interesting afternoon, however I do have a few complaints, mostly the glaring omisssions.  I know that not everybody can be included but I think it could have been expanded a bit.  Neither Hal Foster's PRINCE VALIANT or Alex Raymond's FLASH GORDON were in evidence.  Foster and Raymond's work brought a fine art sensiblility to comics and set the tone for thousands of comic strip and comic book adventure strips.

Also missing was R.F. Outcault's work.  Outcault was probably the very first comic strip artist who basically got the ball rolling as far as comics were concerned.  His YELLOW KID and BUSTER BROWN strips from the turn of the century set off the whole genre.

Also missing were samples of Walt Kelly's POGO and Al Capp's LI'L ABNER which brought satire and social commentary to comics and set the tone for strips such as DOONESBURY, BLOOM COUNTY and BOONDOCKS.

Bill Watterson's CALVIN AND HOBBES would not have been out of place either.

In the comic book exhibit we could have done with some samples of Jack Cole and his excellent humorous hero strip PLASTIC MAN.  He drew with a manic intensity that has never been matched by anyone else who has revived the character.

Steve Dtiko was also absent.  His work on SPIDER-MAN and DR. STRANGE would be worthy of any museum.

Alternative comics artists such as Chris Ware and Gary Panter were included but not the works of Jaime and Gilbert Hernandez.  Their LOVE AND ROCKETS comic touched off the whole alternative comics boom of the 80s and 90s.  Also misisng was Peter Bagge's NEAT STUFF and HATE comics which were drawn in a manic impressionistic style and Daniel Clowes who brought a new literary sensibility to comics in the pages of his magazine EIGHTBALL.  Another glaring omission, and a highly influential one was Carl Barks best known for drawing (and writing) the comic book versions of Disney's DONALD DUCK.  Barks developed Huey Dewey and Louie and created Uncle Scrooge, Gyro Gearloose, Gladstone Gander as well as many other characters that populated Duckburg.  A first rate illustrator as well.

I also would have liked to have seen some art by Dame Darcy because I really like her comics writing and cds.(plus I""m really hung up on her lol).

My other complaint that it seemed mostly to focus on the art of comics.  Most of the best comics had some excellent writing as well and the writers tended to get short shrift as a result (which is why there was no Alan Moore or Harvey Pekar).  Although the art is often first rate focusing on that seems like having a film retrospective and just focusing on the photography.  

But you know, I'm never satisfied with anything these days.  hee hee  It was mostly a very enjoyable day.  I should do more stuff like that.  (Well tomorrow I'm going to the Silent Movie to see Harold Lloyd.)

Hope you're all having a great weekend too."

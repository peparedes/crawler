"event","I have had an insanely busy and complicated week...

Aside from being sick with a nasty cold, probally due to the crazy hot/cold/hot weather New York is having Valentine's Day was yesterday.

I was never much one for Valentine's Day or anything like that, but seeing all those people with flowers, couples all lovely, it is enough to put a sense of longing...

I have been thinking too much about the past...about someone in particular...she was such a big part of my life for so long...but now we don't even talk any more at all.
Sometimes I think I should just pick up the phone...

I doubt she would want to talk to me ever again though...or do I really want to talk to her?  It has been so long...too long.  Two years can seem like an eternity...

I am going to go read...sorry for the lack of posting to this thing...I will try to do so more often."

"event","My friends,
Oh Explode! You know
Because this is a new one
A chance to glance
A glance at how we've [been] doin.
We'll evolve,
We will solve
In our palms, on the sores of our world
We'll open doors

What is broken we'll fix
What is different we'll mix
We will dissolve the cliques
We'll scratch the itch.

Cross-Pollination is not a holiday
It's a smalla day
But we still celebrate
It brings new ears after new year's
And now that you're here
Let's bring the tunes near.
Welcome to Cross-Pollination"

"event","Fashion is elastic, it pulls me tight or propells me repuked.  I'm transforming, but I want to shed a coustume.  So confused.  Like an electron constantly spinning but able and ready to jump or combine and take on a while new entity.  AHHH, everything.  What is my problem?  Why can't I just be satisfied.  Just do one thing and do it well?

I want to be exceptional.  I want to be remembered.  (That takes a lot to admit.)  I want to create create create.  I have a horrible relationship with the phrase ""have to"".  I say it everyday.  I want it abolished.

I really have to be super human to do all that I want to.  But superselfish at the same time.  I am most happy when I let got but my desire for experience, creation, community, knowledge, is an addiction.  Perhaps by some this is called ambition and is held in high esteem, but I feel like it is dark.  A ruze, tempting me to devour my hope for happiness in a frantic attempt to admit it.  I'm excited to go back and organize my life, but I am afraid it will destroy my creative mind."

"event","Went to a bar with Claire Friday night...I drank way too much and stumbled back to my apartment.  I don't even fully remember how I got there.

Went to bed alone, cold empty bed.  The apartment is a mess.  Worse than a mess, a disaster.  What is my problem?

I always have these ""have to""s.  I am never satisfied.  All I want to do is something worthwhile.  I want to create.  That is all I want to do.  I wish I didn't have to worry about people, and girls, and everything else.  I wish I could just lock myself up in my apartment and not have to face thMyue world.

But I can't do that.

I don't even know if anyone is reading this...I don't even know why I started this journal.  Just to vent I guess.

I am going to go write now... my best pieces come when my mind is swimming like this."

"event","<font color=""#ff0000"">Red Ink Cannot be seen in red light.
A more of dust is seen by a mite.
The first is physics The second is purely height.
But i see, sometimes we see just
what we like.

And it seems to me
That seems between
What is and seems are bursting
Divining cause
Like designer flaws
Are too expensive and leave us thirsting.

So take what is
What is is this
Like champage fizz
Rising higher

Cross-Pol's here
So pure it's nearly clear
Filling ears and beers up
to your desire.

"event","I want to start the East Village Salon.
I only want to do that which is creative.
My Apartment must be completely Overhauled.
There is no need for a TV or a couch anymore.
A podium is necessary for reading while eating.
I want to write a ltter a week.
I want to research.
I want to produce creatuis of substance.

<b>I will not settle.</b>

Time is more valueable than money.
Love is worth more than time.
Do not be selfish about time.

This is my livejournal.  I have no friends on here yet, I need to make some.  This is just me, and my writings.  I am just a boy out there in New York.  This is me."

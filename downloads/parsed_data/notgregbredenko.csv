on friday i double lunched with harry and between lunches we hid in the bushes by nott street. there wre cinder blocks,a folding chair and most of all a BEAN BAG CHAIR!!During gym class i told Dave Gunn and he was all""fuck you, youre a liar .!)and shit .So in class there was a fire drill so we went to get it.We got about 30-40 feet and coach bennet was all ""hey ,get back here.what do you think youre doing ?""So we said ""hey theres a bean bag chair in those bushes!! (point to shrubbery)Then some stoner yelled""looooooossserz"".
After class we casually sahsaed out of the school,across the football feild and got the chair,with no problems!(security etc.)then we saw bennet and said ""see there was a bean bag in the bushes!""he was all yeaha you guiyes"" in that gay bennet way.
After school i ""guarded"" the chair for Dave until he came back from whatever DAVE GUNN thing he was doing.

Besides that a black girl said my mohawk reminde her of P.DIDDY!!!!!

then i found a rusty knife in marys yard.So ....i decided to cut some branches and leaves with it. But i didnt stop and cut this really huge branch . I was like ""ohh shit "" and ran away.....it was fun!
 There was a shopping cart ,so i pushed it down a hill and it flipped over and hit a concrete bridge support.I was at the train tracks and the lights for the train were on but it didnt come...when i walked away it came ...(fuckin asshole train it should fucking DIE!!!)"

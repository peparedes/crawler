You are a beautiful person, in a wistful kind of way.  If you could, you would spend all your time daydreaming and writing poetry.  You are a tragic beauty.<p>

You are sensitive and caring, and you don't take insults well.  You don't smile much, but when you do, you really mean it.<p>

People like to be around you because you are a calming influence.  You have an appreciation for all things beautiful, and you probably have some potted plants.  You also most likely own a cat.<p>

You like Sundays and hot tea.  You will spend your entire life yearning for quiet beauty, which is a rarity in this world, so you read a lot.<p>

Everyone you know thinks you're ""nice.""<p>

No reports yet on Woodward or Warped Tour.
Well I don't have time so Woodward= Fun, hot guys, funny times, drunk guys, nice cars, squealing tires, porta potties, frozen coke, coney island, me almost dying from choking on pita bread and more. It was just altogether great. I got to spend it with April and Jessica, wooo.

Warped Tour: Meeting people from Something Corporate, *The Starting Line*, Good Charlotte, many little bands that are yet to be famous, taking pictures with my 2 heros who saved me from the pit. And getting a black eye from getting kicked and almost breaking my nose during MxPx were the highlight of my day. Oh also paying fucking $3.00 for a can of pop was great too. But I had fun with Stacey and Kristina. Woo.

School rocks. I love it.
And I love you."

So today Jessica and I went running around town. We went to the mall freakin' 2 times. We somehow wind up getting a pyschic reading!! We're going up the escalator and this girl turns around and asks us if we want to get a pyschic reading and get our palms read..She said she felt a ""vibe"" between us or something...It was like $10 for both of us so we thought what the hell why not. It was crazy. Hahahahahaha...But she hit it all on the dot. The only thing is I mean she could tell anyone this and the person could prolly somehow relate to it but I don't know...
She told me that I was in a relationship that I was really really hurt in, that I got scarred really bad and I thought he was the one and everything. That was exactly right since Chris cheated on me that was definitely right, I took that hard. Also she said I come from a wealthy, respectable family and not to down my mom or dad's name which is true cuz I sometimes am not real respectable. She also said there is someone in life who is a friend figure but is real respectable and someone I could bring home to the parents..which is true.   She also said that I'm afraid to commit to someone because I don't want to get hurt because I'm afraid of it since my last relationship which is right on. It was crazy. she read my palm and told me that I was gonna have 2 boys, a girl and live a healthy life. LoL. Crayzeeeeeeee shizz eh?

April is coming over early tomorrow. Woooooo. I'm gonna get up early and wash my car and make it all pretty for the cruise. We're gonna head up there later...I'm sooo getting a camera so we can take pictures!!!!! It's gonna be a mudda fuddin blast! :):) April's gonna get it...

OrigiAlternaRock: i hope i have lice then sleep with you, and then you get it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    :-D

I'm gonna put my feet all over her. :) :) Muahahahhaha.

"event","Jessica and I went to go see XXX last night. Whoa. Vin Diesel is a fucking hottie and a half. He's got the nices body. Ever since The Fast And The Furious I've been like obsessed with him. He's the ultimate 'bad boy.' That movie was quite gooooooooooooood. Vin's tattoo's looked hella hot too.

After the movie we did our usual Coney Island run at 12 and Main. We were sitting there talking ya know and these 4 older guys sit down on the other side of us so like they could peek over and see our table. This one guy sitting closest to me goes ""Hey girls how's it going?"" And you could tell he was soooooooo drunk. I was eating this yummy chicken lemon rice soup and here's the convo between me and drunky:

drunky: What the hell is that oatmeal?
me: No dude it's chicken lemon rice soup.
drunky: It looks like oatmeal!!!!!
me: It's really good.
drunky: Let me try some then so I know if I want to order it.
me: Alright but get your own spoon or fork.
drunky: Mmm that soup is good.
me: Told ya.

Then we were back minding out own business and I look over at the TV and he goes ""What are you looking at cutie?"" I was like THE TV!! Then I was looking at Jessica's Cedar Point keychain that you look inside of and there's a pic of her, Sheryl, Shelley, Adam, Josh, Mike and Sherry. He goes..""What's that?"" And so I told him and he's like let me see is it a naked picture of her and I was like no and he's like well that's no fun! Then he looks in it and goes..""Well nice rack though."" HAHAHA Jessica didn't get it so I told her and she's like omigosh. He was crayzee. Then I was done with my soup and I asked him if he wanted it and he's like sure hand it over...Then it was cold and he said it tasted like shit and asked if I spit in it! LoL. He said it looked like something they eat on Fear Factor and said if it was he would win the whole show. lol! Then he kept asking us questions...Where we were going yada yada and then he asked what school we went to and I'm like umm Warren Mott and he asked if we graduated and I was like not yet we'll be seniors!! He goes whoa I can't be eating their soup! LOL!!!! Then they parted from us and we finished drinking our pop and made our way out too. We took the usual way home too.....Woodward to 18 Mile. Then we see these 3 guys in a car and here goes the convo between me and the fag....

fag: Hey baby what's up?
me: Nothing.
fag: Where you guys going?
me: Home.
fag: Why?
me: Nowhere else to go.
fag: You have to home at 2 am don't you?
me: No there's just nowhere else to go.
fag: Whatever!
**Then Jessica goes light up a cigarettes maybe they'll be turned off. LoL so we do it....**
fag: Smoke that baby.

AHH it didn't work. Oh well. What a night.

I might go see Mike's gay ass at the skatepark tonight.
I have Senior Pics tomorrow...damnit.

I hope I don't work tomorrow and April can come over woooo!!!

"event","So I sit here being so fucking pissed off but I can't help but laugh cuz of yesterday. Another fun day out in Algonac. So April asks me if I can come out at like 3:30 or 4 because Stacey was going to drop James off while she worked until 7 and she had no idea what to do with him alone. So I came over and met Jamesy Poo. He's real hot. He's real cool. I'm real happy for Stacey. I want a guy just like him. Hey say maybe one if his friends?! LOL.  But anyways so he took Stacey's car to the skatepark and me and April went to Marine City for a slurpee. As we pull up..This guy comes like running up to my window and goes ""Do you girls want to make some extra money?"" I was thinking OH MY FUCKING GOD. And I go ""How?"" And he goes on about how he needs a ride to the airport or to a hotel because he was a fucking carnie who got fired. He kept pulling out his wad of money and reassuring us that he wasn't a psycho. I was so scared..He was carrying this duffle bag with who knows what in it! We should have just put that sucker in reverse and get the hell out of there but we just sat there stupid making up excuses like April said she had to be to work at 5..hahahaha. So we go inside and this worker goes outside and I guess starts talking to that guy and when we come outside he's gone. We drive both ways and see he's not fucking walking. Where the fuck would he go with no car? What a fucking scam!!! He was going to rape and kill us. AHHHHHHHHHH.

So if that wasn't enough excitement...It gets better...
We go watch James at the Skatepark and all the other hot skaters and then we go see Stacey at work and she gives me a free shake wooo. Then we head off to Marine City when she gets off to see Pooch. April had to see Herbie cuz she's in love! They did a good show. Then we go driving around and get all woo woo if you know what I mean. We're laughing our asses off and go get April's pictures developed at Meijer's. Then these 2 black guys ask if they can ""ride with us."" What's with people asking to get a ride with us?!?!?! AHHH. But anyways so then we're just driving listening to music and I must have been in a trance cuz I didn't even notice there is flashing lights behind us!!!!!!!!!! The look on April's face was priceless. She goes omg I dunno what to do! She throws her purse in the back to James and I toss back the cigarettes to him. The cop was a prick and kept hounding us asking if we know why we're getting stopped if we have anything illegal in the car if he searched it he wouldnt find anything if those cigarettes were james's how old we were where we were at where we were coming from how her driving record was. AHHH. It was scary! Then he's like do you know why you're getting stopped and she goes ""I think because I was going a little fast."" And he's like any other reason and she's like ""Well I was kind of going into the other side of the road on that curve"" HAHAHAHAAHHA He's like is there any reason why you were? And she's all showing him these hand movements saying it's kind of a sharp curve and all. LOL!!!!! Then he sits there for like 5 minutes and goes...........""Slow Down."" We were sooooooo lucky!!!!!! Then we just laughed the whole way home cuz it was hilarious. We always think the cops are following us and we get so paranoid. And that's why!!

So we get to April's and eat popcorn, bagels, pretzels, and fruit. Mmmmmmm. :) :) Then we watched Freaks And Geeks and went to bed.

We woke up and her lovely mommy made us pancakes and we watched TV and then I went home. We're gonna hang out this week fo sho.

Ahh another memorable moment in Algonac.

:-P

My parents suck and I'm so pissed off right now. Damnit."

He goes ""Linda you can go in our bed now I'm gonna be out here"" Except the only thing is it's April on the couch!!!!! LOL!!!!! So he keeps saying it and saying it! LOL! Then he comes in my room and wakes me up and I thought he told me that mom was on the couch and to tell her to come in my room only that he told me he thought April was mom and said I should tell her to come in my room since he was gonna be out there. Hahahaha it was funny so when she left he goes to her...""Bye Linda!"" HAHAHA!! :) :)"

"event","Whoa.
Exciting few days!!
Let's start I think Tuesday night me and Jessica went to go see Austin Powers in Goldmember and it was fucking hilarious. I so enjoy that humor and I personally think that this was the best out of the 3 movies, I don't care what anyone else says. Then Wednesday we hit up Royal Oak ya heard. We went to Coney Island and just drove around. It was fun, I miss my Jessica..We barely ever hang out anymore. At least I talk to her a lot. I finally got my Warped Tour ticket woo. 

Thursday April came into town. We had such a blast. We tried the new blue pepsi..its eh alright. We went over to Lakeside and saw the big KB Toy guy and he was following us. Then we get food and come to my house. My brother is acting so fucking wacko and asking if he can have sex with April saying he likes having sex with my friends, telling us how much he loves sluts and asking me about my sex life and trying to share like sex stories with me! UGH! It's my fucking brother man. Then he's all pulling his boxer shorts down so his bare ass is showing and he's rubbing all up against April and putting his ""bum bum"" on me..then he's talking to his girl on the phone and he's sitting there crossing his legs like a fucking queer. We're just laughing our asses off at him. He gets off the phone telling us how he's gonna get 5 girls and have one each day of the week then he's like no I would never do that, he pulls out some condoms throws them on the table and says to give them to my mom!!! So we got our kicks..

Then we're home alone. We're just listening to music and April is petting my dog Cocoa and all of a sudden she growls at her! LOL!! April was so scared!!! I fell out of my chair laughing so hard. Then she calls her a him and I think she called me Cocoa? LoL but anyways so I chase after her and beat her down. :-P  I get rug burn on my arm and we are just sooo fucking laughy and goofy. Then we start singing Rufio and we are singing ""I tried to read your thoughts..."" in like this weird ass voice....It sounds so effed up. 

Then we decide to go to Kmart at like 12:30 and April brings her camera so we can take random pics of people. We want to just buy some freakin underwear and there's a line a mile long. Would you expect a line at 1 in the morning at Kmart? So we're like the only girls behind all these drunk guys. We finally get out of there and just go drive around. We see this nasty old man standing in front of this Semi Truck at this gas station so we pull in and drive by she snaps a pic of him and i peel out! It was so funny lol! Then we are driving and there is this mom next to us in a car with her 2 boys. She goes ""Do you guys want some lovin'? My boys need some lovin!"" HHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAA. Then she's like how about you suck their dicks.....Ahhhhhhhh. Then she's asking where Livernois is cuz she's lost. Then April takes her picture!! She's like if my picture ends up on the internet I get props. LOL! So then daddy calls at 2am and says you need to come home. Blah and he ruins all our fun.

Except when we get home I see my lovely brother and his Claire-Bear at our door. I get out of my car and I drop my fucking phone! The case goes everywhere and my keys fall and someone steps on them and my alarm is going off at 2:30 fucking am. My brother finally turns it off and Claire tries to help me fix my phone. It didn't work too well. Prolly cuz she was drunk. Then my brother starts being protective telling me if he sees me bringing home any boys he's gonna beat the shit out of them. Then his friend Jeremy pulls up and I ask him to help with me my phone and he asks me if I'm drunk!!!!! Then my brother tells his friend that he needs to kick my ass cuz I turned into a little slut? Hmm. Then my brother brings Claire in the house and they're all loud and my parents are trying to sleep! I guarantee my parents were awake. So my brother leaves and my dad says girls it's time for bed! AHHH! So we watch TV and all of a sudden I hear April snoring I was like ahh I will never get to sleep so I went in my bed. :) Then we woke up and went to the mall to get my phone fixed and then she went home. Now I'm being all lazy and tired. I'm gonna go take a shower and go out to eat with my mom. Woo.

Going to see Pooch tomorrow with April, Stacey, and James.

Later biotches.

Me and April went to Canada!! LoL!!! She got honked at because she turned on a red light, it was so fucking funny. I was laughing my ass off as we were both screaming. I got my Rook pierced at Need A New Hole..Woo..That's my new home, I always find my way back there. Here's my plan to tell my mom...
""Mom..I want to tell you/show you something but you have to promise not to get mad. I got a piercing in my right ear because you know since I have my left ear pierced with my Industrial and how I have always been saying I need something in my right ear to balance it and then I'd be satisfied..Well now I'm satisfied. Mom I understand if you hate me and don't love me but I hope in a few years you'll take me back and love me again. I'm a good kid and am respectable, I work, I get good grades, if this is the worst thing I do then there's no need to worry. ""

Sound good?!?! :) Hehe...That plan will go I think Monday..When I get the balls to do it.

So Heather got a promotion!! She's now Lead Brand Rep. She got a raise and all, bia. I sold over $700 today and I got a person to open a Limited Too Charge Card, fuck yeah go Stephanie.  Laura Hamood came up today!! I miss her. She needs to call me. Laura......fair warning....CALL ME OR I KICK YOUR LITTLE ASS!!!!!!!!!!!

I picked Mike up from this new skatepark the other day, it's pretty rawkin. And he was all sweaty and his eyes were on fire, ugh.

So yeah Lillian hates me. :-/ 

I think I'm hanging out with April this week. I have to work everyday until Wednesday. OHh!!! I got a $20 mall gift certificate for having the most people come to Friends And Family Day at my work. Hell yeah. 

Oh yeah and fuck boys. Seriously, fuck them all. Is there any decent guys out there? I have yet to find out. I'm done with them for a while.

"event","So the last few days have been fun. Stayed the night at April's. Her and Stacey tried to pierce my belly button!! LOL!! Ouch!!!! They tried this sewing needle or something and I guess it wasn't sharp enough and wouldn't go through but at least it was all numb after like 10 ice cubes. hahahahaha..we're stupid. :) But so then I made it to the Weezer/Dashboard concert and it rawked. I won't even say what went on in our little circle but boy oh boy was it great!!! Then we went to Taco Bell and chowed down. Mmm. Hehehe. 

Saturday up bright and early to get an early start up north. Jessica Wyman came up with me and it was a terrific time. Besides getting tossed off the tubes and getting bruises and rope-burn it was great!! Haha..We got a little color, went swimming, got our bonding girl talks in, listened to music, and say a MOTHERLOAD of Amish people!! LoL...It was fun. 

So work tomorrow..Woo. 

Sign Off. J'ai fini.

Well April stayed the night last time. It was fun. We went around everywhere. K-Mart. LoL. Meijer. Hehehehehe..I love her to death..

So it finally came..My good friend Jessica Wyman is lonely. :( I feel so bad and I know what she's going through. I wish we both didn't know how it feels to be heartbroken. But she's coming up north with me Saturday and we're going to have fun. It's going to be girl talk and deep talks. We're going to talk, we're going to eat ice cream, we're going to go swimming, we're going to get tan, we're going to see Amish people, we're going to go tubing, we're going to go boating, we're going to talk, we're giong to bond,we're going to have a hella good time.

Up north this weekend was nice..short..but nice. Went up Saturday after work at like 10 and came home Monday at like noon. I saw Josh again after like a year..What a hella hottie. I only see him once a year though lol. The fireworks were good on the lake..only like an hour late but good!! I didn't really get too tan..But I didn't get burned either which is good. Ouch.

Oh man all I could do was kidn of laugh and say ""Naw I don't.""

The fireworks were good though. Saw Brian who I haven't seen in ages.

Stopped by Kevin's. Hope he doesn't get in trouble. Ima see him Monday when I get home.

It was funny I liked it. Next time me and Kevin are going to the movies without Jessica..muhahahaha. So if I don't have to work today me and Kevin are going to hang out and I really hope I don't have to work. I have towork tomorrow, blah that's good enough!

It should be a fun time, it always is with her. :) :) 

I've been staying up hella late. But it's fun. I feed Mike my nigger jokes. And he works on his page. And I talk to Kevin. And I talk to Lillian. It's fun. :) Summer is fun. :)

Today I had to be up at mutha fuckin' 8am. We had a meeting at work/baby shower for Lisa. It was actually not as bad as I thought it would have been. It was enjoyable, just a little bit. 

So my dad and I went to Guitar Center and got hooked up with a new snare drum, a new Zildjian Cymbal and stand, a new seat and new drum sticks and a mentronome. Fuzuck yeah. I hope to soon be getting a double bass pedal....ahhhhhh.....

I really need to start writing lyrics. I want to write like Chris Conley or Jordan Pundik..I wanna do that. I'm <u>going</u> to do that. 

I think it's funny when people think they're going to be hooking up with their exes when I know stuff that they don't, muahahhaha. And I miss Jessica Wyman out in New Baltimore..I need to drive my ass out there to see her. 

Well some friends can just sit on it. Fuck you, fuck them, fuck him, fuck her, fuck this and fuck that.

I got my ACT scores. Oh man. Ok so without Reading added...I would have had a 21...but then when you add Reading...I got a mutha fucking 19. I know I'm smarter than that. But I guess it doesn't really matter since I'm only going to Macomb CC or OCC for the first 2 years then transfering to MSU..It doesn't matter what I get on the ACT's. I could take them over but what's the point?

So I crimped my hair today..It looks hella tight yo. Holla.


I wanna go up north. I'm withdrawaling from tubing and the boat. I need to get away from the city life. July 12-14...Ahh July 12-14.

Wednesday Mike is coming over, then I think I'm going to meet my dad at work and then go out to Great Lakes Crossing, that mall is pretty cool. 

So I went to Kohl's today to get a picture frame..I had gotten this one that was like an 18x11 and it was hard trying to squeeze a shirt into that because I had to fold it all up and it just didn't work. So I got a mother fucking 22x28!!! The whole back of the shirt will be framed and it's gonna look really cool!!! I'm going to decorate around the edges with NFG shiznit. I only have Cyrus, Ian, and Steve's signatures...It'd be nice to have Jordan's and Chad's but hey that's the way it goes.. at least we got 3. :) :) Then what I'm gonna do with the other frame, instead of wasting it I'm prolly going to either print up or write out some of my favorite NFG lyrics..or just any band's lyrics..I haven't decided that yet and make it look all cool and frame it..gay idea? Yes I know but fuck you and your mom ok.

So today Brian and I realized how fucking cool Chris Conley and his lyrics are..He's a bit on the weird side, but still cool as fuck.

""Could you tell me the next time that you're choking, 'cause I'll run right over to shove some dirt right down your throat."" 
""Let me take this awkward saw and run it against your thighs, cut some flesh away.""
""The next time you see Nick, yeah tell him I'm gonna stick some needles in his face""
""My gut is burning. Won't you find me some water?Hey, just forget it can you bring me gasoline.""
""And my spleen is dripping from my pants.""
""If this sky's going to eat us then I'd like to be digested into a million pieces with you. I'd love to be scattered to hell with you.""

Ahh, the beautiful work of Chris Conley. All hail Chris Conley.


I need to go to a concert. I'm withdrawaling from concerts. Help. 

So I need to learn to drum, skateboard, and golf. Why can't I just be naturally good!?!?!? Geezus.

"event","Wow. Where do I start for today? Today was interesting. First..I'll start with last night..Oh man. So I go out and pick up Stacey in Algonac. We go to Ross's house, which I haven't hung out with him in AGES...And I miss how much of a goofball he is. He not only got naked in my car, mooned April, stuck out the window like a dog, fake-fell in Wendy's, dropped his water, made a big scene, but we go outside after Wendy's and find wacko Ross in the fucking tree eating a leaf with ketchup!!!!! HAHAHAHA. I thought I almost pissed my shorts like a million times yesterday.  Then we go to his house and he brings out all his toys: skateboard, scooters, his hose, and golf clubs. Then we go for a ride in the duster...or shadow? They both look the same...But anyways we had that mo fo bumping yo. His car is pretty pimp, you know this. Word.  So after all that madness we get slurpees, mmmmm...and then come home for the night.  Stacey and I weren't tired <u>AT</u> all so we decide to go jumping on the trampoline at 3 am. Then after jumping for about 30 mins, we just chill and were talking laying there until I notice a weird figure..I'm like hmmmm..And about 5 houses down around the corner this weirdo arab dude is sitting in a chair looking out his window with his lights on at us. Oh my lord, we ran our asses as fast as we could into the house!! And what didn't help was the NFG lyrics on the hidden track of Sticks And Stones...<i>""There's someone in your house"" ""Do you think you're safe""</i> So we sat there scared shitless, and then we come to our senses..and we watch some old dance videos. :)Then we're still wide awake so we just gibber gabbered. We had plans to do a 7-11 run at 5am..But considering we didn't get to bed till 4:15 that didn't work out!!! Oh I also forgot to mention that Stacey brought over the stuff to make a cool bead NFG bracelet like she has so I got to have one just like her, yay friendship bracelets. :) So when we wake up we decide we want donuts Mmmmmmmmmmmm so we go to 7-11 and this foreign fuck is working there and they don't have the kind of donuts that I want so as we're walking out the habeeshi is all like ""Were you looking for something?"" And I'm like <s>""Umm no dumbass we just walked in here for no apparent reason faggot.""</s> ""We were looking for donuts but you don't have the kind that we want."" So we go to another 7-11 and they don't have the kind she wants!! So we get the ones for me and go back to the other one for the Long John's for Stacey..And we go to pay and the guy is all like ""What is happening?"" And we look at each other and are like what the fuck, does he mean why are we back or like what's going on? So I go ""Hello."" And he's like ""That's better."" And we are straining ourselves from laughing and it was quite hard trust me. So he's like do you have 2 small donuts or big ones? And we're like huh!? He was one weird foreign dude....Yeesh.  So on to today. We go out to Algonac and I get to meet Stacey's Jeff. He's a pretty cool guy, pretty goofy, a lot like Ross. Then we all go to the beach.....Oh my god..I laughed so fucking hard..We all did, April thought she pee peed her bathing suit. :) There was this <s>big, ugly, gumpy</s> hot, sexy guy there in the water. It looked like he had no bathing suit on but he really did, he had boobies bigger than all of ours combined and he was all touching up on himself. HAHAHA. His ass crack was showing so much...It was so fucking hilarious. Then his ""buddy"" that he was with had these short ass shorts on and we thought at any moment his winky would come shooting out from the side of his shorts. He kept bending over and putting his fingers up his butthole? And like whiping sand on his butt, then going in the water and pulling down his shorts and shit. LoL, oh man funny shit. The this <s>little</s> <u>BIG</u> girl had a mondo weggie. It was quite funny too. Then this old guy with short cutoff jeans on went walking by with his dog and goes ""Hey girls"" and we're like ""Hi"" then BOOM! His leg slipped and he almost fell over off the grass into the sand, hahahahaha. He's like ""Look what you girls made me do!"" LoL!!!! God, funny days man.  The fun must end sometime..So we all go to April's then Stacey takes me to her house, I get my car and head back to Sterling Heights. I think I'm gonna move to Algonac if we can talk my mom into it....Holla. Those 2 girls are hella cool yo. I'm so glad we found them. We shall all be hanging out next week again..Maybe Saturday..Word. I gotta work tomorrow prolly....fuzzuck. Well time for me to separate yo. Goodnight everyone from me and JiziggaBooBoo Peanut Paul Fo Sho. :) :)"

It only took me like a fucking hour to figure all this shit out and actually get it all to work!! So I've been thinking lately, I wanna just be a bum and do nothing. It feels so good moping around the house in my pj's and my hair all greasy and not having to worry, ah that's the life.

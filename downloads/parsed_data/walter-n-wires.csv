There was something about traveling over six decades that was rather draining at times. But he'd had a bloody fine time, and he was back. Had it been two weeks?

So. The door was open and he was sprawled on his bed alternately dozing and playing with Pup. More dozing than playing.

"event","Not sleeping was getting old. It was getting very old. 

Walter had snagged a couple of catnaps since Monday, but that was it. He'd been glad of the distraction that had come from doing things like being ""it"" in Nadia's running game in SERF, but when the distractions were gone, he was left with his thoughts. 

Those who knew him, knew he brooded extremely well. 

So, he was on the front porch, smoking and <s>brooding</s> thinking. 

<lj-cut text=""Cut for said brooding"">What the brooding came down to was the fact that he needed to be two people at once if he was going to be able to satisfy the two people he loved. Or was it three people? Did Vlad count as two people when Alucard was waiting for him in 1947? 

When it came down to it, Nadia gave him something Vlad couldn't - her very human self. Not ""normal"" perhaps, but human and smart and funny and beautiful and occasionally nicely ruthless and whether it spoke good or ill of him, he thrived when he was with her and when he could take care of her. 

The dream of a future in which they were together and had found a way to balance both their lives enough to have Bailey warmed him. 

At the same time, there was Vlad. And Alucard. To have a future with Nadia in which that happened, was to abandon Alucard and Hellsing in the past and Vlad in this present. Vlad had more than fifty more years of memories of the two of them together, and without those? How could he leave Alucard with nothing? He had <i>nothing.</i> Everything he was belonged to Hellsing. 

Walter <s>usually</s> respected Arthur and he believed in Hellsing's mission with all his heart, but his treatment of Alucard was that of an owner. 

After a fashion, he reconciled that as Alucard's prison term for past crimes. If he figured it properly, Vlad had served more than a hundred year sentence and now he was free. 

So, Nadia, whom he loved in all her human frailty and destiny-touched madness and compassion and humor and beauty. 

And Alucard, whom he loved in all his inhuman madness and bloodthirstiness and intelligence and humor and beauty. 

And Vlad, whom he loved for all the same reasons and who was free and who had waited seven years to steal just a little more time with him. 

He wanted to be Bailey's father and Alucard's companion during his servitude and Vlad's companion in a long and empty freedom. 

And somewhere he'd chosen at least two of those things, hadn't/wouldn't he? Bailey existed, so he chose Nadia. Vlad remembered half a century of the two of them together, so he'd chosen Alucard and Hellsing. If he'd chosen two things, why couldn't he figure out a third? 

And how did the first two choices work? 

The same way he'd been Brian Slade? 

Add that in. Somewhere, he was a 70s glam pop star. 

And somewhere he'd died in the Blitz. And somewhere he'd burned out and died when his metabolism had eaten him alive? And somewhere else he'd probably been killed by a vampire in his first foray into the world of vampire hunting. 

He sensed an answer in there. Maybe he didn't need to sit back and say, ""Somewhere I'm Bailey's father."" Maybe he needed to <i>make</i> it happen.... 

By the same token, maybe he didn't need to feel so helpless about Alucard and Vlad. 

Maybe... 

Maybe he didn't have to leave his lover alone in the past <i>or</i> the future....</lj-cut>

Run off with Vlad. 
Run off with Nadia. 
Go home and tell Arthur he'd send pictures of him in bed with Alucard in female form to the Queen if he tried to send him away again. 
Try to find Fandom and find the Nadia he'd left and apologize.

Buy himself a chastity belt and throw away the key. 

His talk with Vlad had... not gone well <s>or would not have gone well once it was done being played out</s>. The vampire was hurt, insulted, and angry. 

And it had been such a <i>good</i> weekend otherwise.

He could have backed out. Told Nadia that he wasn't going to do it. That he'd chosen Vlad over her.

"event","Walter moved around his room methodically unpacking his suitcases. He stacked pictures under the corkboard that conveniently happened to be over one of the two desks in the room. They'd go up soon enough. Clothes were shaken out, ironed as needed, and hung up. 

""You aren't going to need a heating pad here for a while,"" he murmured to Pup, who was following him around the room as though Walter had bacon in his pocket. 

If Pup ate anything like bacon. 

Which reminded him - he was going to need to find a way to feed his pet that didn't involve opening a vein every day or two. That got a bit messy. 

Work was always something to keep his mind occupied. 

<lj-cut text=""Cut because the butler boy broods and refuses to simplify his life"">Unfortunately he worked fast, which meant that soon enough, he was out of ways to keep his mind on other things. Scooping up Pup, he opened the window and sat on the sill with the hellpuppy cradled in his arms while he looked out at the lush green surroundings. This was not England. He was 60 years and 4,000 miles separated from home and Alucard. 

And Pippi, Pip, and Nadia were here. 

Nadia.... 

One of the pictures in the stack to be put up on the corkboard was of a very, very dirty <a href=""http://daddysmessygirl.livejournal.com/profile"">little girl</a> hugging Nadia. Several others were of Nadia alone or with their friends. 

Many more were of Alucard.

He'd had two years at home with Alucard. Time in which to clear up their ""misunderstandings."" Time in which to grow much closer and use the word ""love"" without question. And it had hurt terribly when Arthur had separated them again to send Walter to this school. 

He certainly didn't want to throw things to the wind within moments of arriving in a new place. 

But he hadn't lied when he told Nadia he loved her years ago in Fandom. He hadn't even <i>wanted</i> to tell her he loved her when they both knew that she wouldn't be the only one in his heart. 

But done was done, and after those words were said, he didn't want to undo it. And in two years in his own time and place, he still loved her. 

So what the hell was he supposed to <i>do?</i> It had hurt them both when he'd left Fandom and all he could ever do was hurt her by leaving because he <i>had</i> to go home to Hellsing and to Alucard.

But Bailey had to have her parents. 

Walter silently cursed Arthur and lit a cigarette. If his employer had <i>known</i> Nadia was here and hoped she would come between him and Alucard, he was going to hire the man the most diseased whore in London. 

Walter sat and thought and smoked until the familiar sounds of a <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/milieux_village/47009.html"">guitar</a> drifted up to him. Two years weren't enough time to change- it hadn't been two years for her. Of course she hadn't changed, it had only been a month. 

He muttered a curse and set Pup down. 

All he knew for the moment was that he was stuck here for the next year or two, and his friends were here and running away wasn't going to help him at all. 

Time to go see Nadia.</lj-cut>

Tonight. 

Great. 

Open next to the envelope was a suitcase into which Walter was packing his clothes and some gifts he'd intended to send home and now didn't have to trust the trans-temporal post with. 

This was going to be interesting.

Walter was woken by something... wet... on the foot that was sticking out of the covers and hanging over the side of the bed. 

""Stop it, Pup,"" he mumbled and wiggled his foot to try to get the hellpuppy to stop licking his toes. 

Pup perked up and stood up from his place on the pillow next to Walter's head. 

""I said stop it,"" he muttered more loudly and jerked his foot back under the blanket. 

Now Pup was confused. The best thing to do was to get a better vantage to see what was going on. Standing on Walter's head would do nicely. 

""Stooooppp..."" Walter pulled the hellpuppy off his head and grumbled about pets as alarm clocks. ""And stop gnawing on my...."" 

Wait a minute. If Pup was on his head, what was gnawing on his toes? 

Walter sat up and tossed his blanket aside.

"event","As was not an unusual sight, Walter had pieces of something that had been Pip's M-16 spread out on his bed. 

What was an unusual sight was the fact that barring the magazine, without which this was just a big club, it was fully repaired. The magazine was in the weapon's locker and the rest of the big club was still disassembled. 

He pulled the barrel out of Pup's jaws after the hellpuppy jumped up on the bed with a devilish gleam in his many red eyes. Apparently the barrel looked an awful lot like a pike to the wee hellhound. 

Given the way the gleam was directed at Mr. Neilson, who was sitting on Walter's head, Walter had to assume that jealousy was rearing its little black and fuzzy head. 

""Go on,"" he admonished Pup. ""Go play ball with Vyvyan."" 

With a multi-tonal whine, Pup directed one last glare at Mr. Neilson before jumping off the bed to find a ball to throw at the violent. 

Walter sighed and began to attempt to un-monkey his head. He would be glad when the suite's female occupants were back."

Walter was considering just what sort of protective item he wanted to make for DAMM. Something multi-purpose would be good, since you never knew what to expect here."

Pup was enjoying the new living space, which meant that he was sniffing <i>everything</i> he could get his nose into. Vyvyan was sitting on a window sill waving its little club arms around in its standard violent manner, and Walter was doing something involving something that was very, very close to being a gun. So much so that it wouldn't be long at all before the something would be a gun and would be in the weapons locker where it belonged. 

And about time, too. Pip had best be happy.

"event","Say hi to Walter. Walter has a couple of visible quirks I don't want to have to describe repeatedly in interactions. 

Walter is 15, from <s>1944 is so last year</s> 1945 London, improbably tall (thank you canon filled with improbably tall people) and almost always wearing formal trousers, waistcoat and tie, and the shiniest shoes you're likely to see anywhere but on Alfred Pennyworth's feet. 

He will also always be wearing a ring on every finger. If he isn't, he's probably either been hurt recently, or something very, very bad has happened. He gets really cranky about those rings. 

I've been using Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as  his real person representation, but will also mix that with art, because Walter's from an anime/manga canon. 

Walter's a good guy, mainly because the bad guys didn't get to him <s>yet</s> first. That whole ""respect for human life"" thing? He doesn't get it. It's us/them, and it's really for the best if you're ""us."" 

There we go. Welcome to the new people. Hi again to the old people. And for those who arrived with my boy, can you believe we've been at it a whole year?"

No more revision! For that he was deeply grateful. 

His reading material was not particularly light, but it was for personal interest, so no one was allowed to give him grief for his research on metallurgy. 

The door sat open <s>as did the post.</s>

When he heard Hawkeye's announcement, he rolled his eyes and wondered just how many people were going to be driven mad by biting mistletoe."

But prophecy just didn't want to stay in his head. So he was reading his notes and one of his books for the <i>nth</i> time and wondering just how much it mattered if he didn't pull off high marks. 

Pup was playing ball with Vyvyan. The violent had been a bit droopy with the cooling weather, but he'd figured out a way for Pup and the plant to share the heating pad and it had perked its little clubs right up.

<b>Brown Rice Gratin</b>

2 cups broccoli florets
3 cups cooked brown rice
1 cup (8 oz.) shredded Swiss or Jarlsberg cheese <i>(although I always use at least twice that and prefer Jarlsberg)</i>
3/4 cup regular-strength chicken broth <i>(you can substitute vegetable broth for a vegetarian, but not vegan, friendly recipe)</i>
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup chopped green onion
1/4 cup minced fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 cup fine dry bread crumbs mixed with 2 teaspoons melted butter or margerine

In a wok or 4- to 5-quart pan, place broccoli on a rack above 1 inch of boiling water. Cover and steam until florets are just tender when pierced, about 9 minutes. 

In a large bowl, mix broccoli, rice, cheese, broth, sour cream, onion, cilantro, mustard, and pepper. Spread evenly in a 9- by 13-inch oval or rectangular casserole. Sprinkle with bread crumbs. 

Bake in a 350 degree oven until casserole is hot in center and crumbs are browned, 15 to 20 minutes."

"event","Walter was curled on his bed with the pillow over his head and Pup lying against the back of his neck whining fretfully. The headache had returned with an utter vengeance and even the last few pills he'd brought back after going to Poland weren't touching it. 

He should probably call someone. 

After a while, he stuck out a hand to feel around for his phone with no success. He was going to have to come out of hiding from the light. 

Getting up to get his phone, the tunnel vision that narrowed to nothingness was almost a relief because he didn't feel anything, not even his head hitting the floor when he fell. 

After a moment of silence in the room, Pup jumped off the bed to nudge Walter with his nose and lick his face, but his person wasn't waking up.

<small>[ooc: Up very early because my employer, crazily enough, thinks that I should work while I'm on their dime. Post is locked to a couple of people who know who they are.]"

"event","Walter had gone out earlier when his shadow was elsewhere and picked up some takeout. Now he was sitting on his bed and trying to read. Which actually meant tapping his foot on the floor, eating, and throwing paper balls for Pup. 

Sometimes life is just so bloody exciting.

"event","Walter headed back to his room, having actually shed his shadow for the moment. He assumed he'd be seeing her again later and thought he might want to warn Al. 

Getting back to his room, Al wasn't around. And his stuff had been mucked about with. He could hear something moving around in his desk drawer. When he pulled it open he found that his secretary bot had covered the inside of the drawer with ""Let me out!"" 

Needless to say, he was perplexed. 

His laptop also wasn't where it had been before. He pulled it out and started it up to see if anything else had been done. 

And it wouldn't start up."

"event","Walter opened his eyes and closed them again just as quickly. If he had to take a wild guess, he'd say that this was a migraine that had kept him out of action since Thursday. Not that he'd ever had one before, but he knew what to watch for. That was something he was going to have to worry about later.

Today he had enough presence of mind to open his bedside drawer and pull out the bottle of pills he'd had since he came back from Poland. After dry-swallowing a couple, he left the open bottle on the table and pulled his pillow over his head.

Perhaps the <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/fandomhigh/1040175.html?thread=57573167#t57573167"">school assembly</a> on Friday with Pip had been practice.

At least Teh Emoo could explain the unfortunate <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/fandomhighdorms/829964.html?thread=64329228#t64329228"">tarot reading</a> he'd gotten from Nadia in the common room after watching <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/fandomhighdorms/829964.html?thread=64307212#t64307212"">The Bracelet</a> with Blair and Billy. And possibly how Blair had upset Lana enough to make her ill? 

It was as good an explanation as any, he supposed, and very Fandom.

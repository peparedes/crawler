"event","yesterday and today have been truly horrible and i have like no one to comfort me or even listen to me bitch. i feel kinda alone and unwanted like the smelly kid in class. things in my life are going really bad for me, this includes classes and work and my social life and just my life. i've tried like everything to make it better but each problem just hinders the next. today all i wanted was a hug and i couldn't even get that. sometimes i feel like i'm not even in control of my life and i'm just going through the phases. something needs to happen. maybe it's just me though maybe my lifestyle isn't what others want it to be or maybe people are just getting bored of me. whatever the case is, it doesn't feel good. is it bad that today at work i seriously almost bawled my eyes out cuz i felt so alone? i just want a hug and for some one to tell me everything will be fine, but not just like a fake hug i want like a genuine ""i'm concerned"" hug. i think that would make me feel a whole lot better, knowing that someone else is concerned about my life and not just me."

"event","well let's see today i had a LONG day at work, which consisted of staring at a computer screen, helping customers, dealing with credit cards, and blah blah blah then i WANTED to go to class but i went to snuggle instead. i think that was the highlight of my day. took a refreshing shower, then went to coach. traffic is horrible and i hate other drivers cuz i'm the best driver in the world..... coaching was good then i came home and started to clean my room for laura cuz my messy room stresses her out. so now it's clean and i made my bed and my desk, and i made a TV stand. then i watched Alias which is always good. but then it turns out laura doesn't want to come over again...so now i'm just kinda...SOL.



anyway that's my day hopefully tomorrow will be better. 



good day"

"event","i can't sleep right now, it may have to do alot with getting hit in the face when i try to sleep or that insesent sound i keep hearing. but either way i don't mind it. anyway big race tomorrow, or this morning. hope i do well trying to break an out of shape 20 minutes. then my mom is coming up and it should be a fun day. laura took me out to dinner tonight with her family, but i knew what was going on cuz i'm sweet. it was alot of fun i really like her family alot, they're really nice people and i really feel welcome and comfortable around them. that's always a plus. DEFINATELY NEED TO CLEAN MY ROOM it's a mess and a half. i think i should try to find out what time the race starts....that would be good. and hopefully i'll be able to go to sunday school prior to the race to get some worship in. who writes entries at 4:23 in the morning anyway?? THIS GUY. still trying to stick with the plan."

"event","joking about things that are black, or even purple for that matter is not a fun thing. it may be fun to you but not the recipient. DEFINATELY NOT. especially when i'm sitting in my apt, studying.

"event","so today was kinda weird it started out kinda bad, kinda hard to explain. i just saw something and it triggered a bad thought and it made me upset and sad. but i did got to ALL of my classes today. but i also did horribly bad on my math exam. but then i saw a roller blader fall. so that made me smile alot, and then laura left me an ""I love you"" message so that was another plus. and i made new friends in my IAH class, and i didn't really have to work today. i understand my econ class and my resssssssssssitation didn't last very long. then i volunteered, we baked a cake, saw some old friends. made people smile. so today was a good day overall. just not the beginning."

"event","i really hate it when i aim to be mad at laura, and then i can't. it's not fair how that happens, if i could be mad at her for a day i'd be suprised. i always somehow feel like it's my fault in the end. probably from my childhood, but who's keeping track? i don't even know why i'm writing this cuz i know only you are going to read it and i might as well tell you via the phone. this live journal thing is NOT ADDICTING.

i hate this"

"event","so now i know of more people that will read, this so i might as well use it. had the weirdest dream about kelsey's printer randomly printing out the message ""Help Me!!"" and then i realized it was a true story and i got a phone call from laura telling me about it. how random is that?"

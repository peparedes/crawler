"event","Ok so last night. Where to begin. Well I went to ""the site"" with Brittany, Krystal, and Jackie to have a small party type thing. None of the people who said they'd come did, but Phill & Nick came and later on so did Eric & AJ. Phill and Nick left after they drank with us for a while. Me and AJ made (SP?)crokay(SP?hahaha) thingys out of the chair that Jackie broke, then a swing (unsucessful), then a sea-saw. That was some random funny shit right there. I have some pictures but I'm not going to post them until later in the week when I have more. The end.

Oh and one more thing, Jackie & Krystal ended up going home. Me, AJ, Britt, and Eric stayed up all night and me and Britt went to Erics house at 5am and slept in his car until around 7:30."

Anywho, my dad is back from Canada. He got me 3 shirts and some other stuff from the races. AAANNDD I get my camera back now since he is done using it. I am supposed to hang out with Mander sometime soon. I miss her too, I haven't seen her since the Prouty vs Leicester game on Thanksgiving. That was quite a while ago.

Last night I got to hang out with Eric. We went to Andy's for a little while, then to his moms and watched some dumb movie, then to some kids house
(no idea what his name was). Then he brought me home and I went to my cousins, then the party. The end.

HOLLER.

So yesterday me, Jay, and Andy went to Kelsie's for a while. We just hung around in that aweful heat cause no one would bring me to get a slip n' slide =( I really wanted one haha. So we just ended up having a fire with Eric and everyone. Then it started pouring so we all went home.

I'm not sure what's up for today/tonight yet. Eric wants to hang out but I have to wait for my mom to stop by and shit and Kelsie wants to hang out later on. We'll see what happens.

Well that's all for now.

Later.

"event","Well no more Leicester high for me. Why you ask? Maybe because I got expelled. The reason leading back to those stupid bitches. Yeah fuck you all. So Spencer schools for me next year. Excited? I'd say not.

In other news. Weekend was alright. I went to Newport with Kelsie for most of it. It wasn't so fun there. I have loads of pictures but I will have to post them some other time because I am leaving soon.

And I guess that's all for now.

Later fools.

"event","Ok this is to all of the people who for some odd reason think I am a slut.

1) Not one person who is talking about me has ever had a real conversation with me therefor they don't know anything about me.

2) If I did sleep with a lot of guys, which I didn't, then it is my business not the whole town of Leicesters.

3) I don't talk badly about any one of these people leaving them no reason to talk badly about me.

4) If you are going to put words in my mouth you may want to make it atleast seem like something I would say rather than telling people I said something that would never come out of my mouth under any circumstances.

5) If one person and I have a problem there is no reason to blow it way out of proportion and turn everyone onto a side and cause everyone to dislike eachother.

6) Do not ever IM me and just yell and accuse me of things. I if you want to talk about something then act like a civilized person and actually try to work things out.

7) I am not as immature as people are saying because if I was I wouldn't have the decency to accept appologys, which I appearently do.

Now read those closely and think before the next time you open your mouth about me."

Second period in spanish me and Kev were singing songs frpm ""We Sing In Sillyvill."" which was the best kids movie ever and still is! Me and Kaylin are going to rent it and watch it sometime. I want to buy it but they don't sell it anymore because they don't make it anymore =(.

I really need a job because when I lived with my dad he gave me money for everything and my mom doesn't give me shit. =/. Anyone want to go job hunting with me?

Ticky wanted me to write about him in my last entry but it was too late when he told me so I will now. Um. I love Ticky. He is the sexiest brazilian alive. The end.

<P>Good part:&nbsp;Friday night was good me &nbsp;Laura, and Kelsey M went to a show in some far town. I saw my Ticky for the first time in how long? I don't even know. Then we went back to Kelsie's for a party type thing. We had a fire and a tent and everyone was smoking pot(yuck). </P>
<P>Bad part: <STRONG>Someone </STRONG>fucked up real bad and when I found out what they did it was like a punch in the face. Oh well, I'll get over it eventually. </P>

"event","<P>Ok. Last night Brandon called me up and was stuck at the highschool because drivers ed got out early so I picked him up and we went back to his house and hung out for a while. I watched a little bit of Kill Bill with britt while she told me about her ""robo trip"" haha. After that Brandon and I were talking about how we could fix things and whatnot and somewhere in that convorsation I heard ""I want to be with you but I can't."" What the fuck does that mean? Heh. Then we got into a fight about how he made alot of people hate me by talking shit and making shit up about me. That one pissed me off for a little while. Later on everything was ok again. A little while before I went home he said ""what if I said yes?"" and I acted as if I didn't know what he was talking about because I am too afraid to get hurt. Fuck this. I want someone new. Someone who wont hurt me. Someone who will treat me better. Someone who will care and not just pretend to. I want to forget the past. I want to start over new.</P>
<P>Well that was more than enough rambling about Brandon and I.</P>
<P>So on to today. School was ok. My Hooly wasn't there again. I hope she gets better soon, and I hope her surgery goes well. I am going to see her every day while she is in the hospital. I told her<EM>&nbsp;</EM>I am going to be her #1 visitor. =). But back to school today, in spanish class me &amp; Ben colored altoids with dry erase markers (nasty smell/taste) and told people they were candy so when they ate them their mouths were all colored and tasted aweful. Hehe. Kevin ate the brown one we said was mint chocolate and his whole mouth was icky colored brown. Haha. Oh oh I drew one Hawt Hawt picture too =) you can look at it with the rest of my pics from today. The sophmores has MCAS today and classes got all fucked up so Dani and I just went to 2 lunches and Irwins cooking class. Today was a breeze.<BR><BR>Well im sure noone wants to read anymore so I'm all done now but there is still the pictures. =)<BR><BR></P>

When I got home I just sat around and talked to people on this peice of shit and then was on the phone with Seamus until about 1. Now I'm way too tired for my own good.

School now."

So tonight there are three partys I could go to but I'm not sure what one I want to go to. There is Kylas where I don't get along with most of the people because they're all stuck up and whatnot. Then there is the one with Seamus which I want to go to since people are'nt assholes there and I'd get to see him. Then there's Britt's which I'd also like to go to since all of my old friends will be there who I miss SO much. So I guess I will decide when I go to Kelsie's house.

I was in first period for LESS than a half hour until I got kicked out for ""giving Mrs. Parker and attitude"" when I DIDN'T.
So when I was in the office I got written up for talking to Santa when I DIDN't. So now I am home for the day because I am suspended when I didn't even do anything. Gotta love Leicester for that one. My dad is pissed, but not at me, at the stupid school and he said I don't have to go there next year if I don't want to so I am guessing I might be going back to SPM if they let me. We'll see.

Other than that everything else is going downhill too. People have been pissing me off like it's going out of style. Everyday I just get closer and closer to snapping and I am just about there. Even my ""bestfriend"" is going around running her mouth as if there was something to be talking about when all she is doing is making shit up. Oh how I am so sick of being treated like I dont mean a thing to anyone. This is aweful.

I must seem like a complainer because of the things I've been writing but they were all getting to me so I just had to get them off my chest somehow.

Well I am done complaining and bitching for now."

My mom dismissed me a little early today and we went to the Solomon Pond mall. I bought her dinner and a some clothes for mothers day. I got myself some new shorts and some perfume from Abercrombie that smells WICKED good. =).

When we left I had her drop me off at Rochdale park where Jackie and Holly SAID they would be but weren't so I had to walk all the way home in this icky heat. Yuck.

After the show we all went back to Kelsie's and me, Eric, Nikki and Kels drove around for a little while to see if there was a party at South or the park. Well, there wasn't so we just went back to Kelsie's and hung out until we fell asleep.

This week has gone by pretty slow. Hopefully this comming week will be a little better.

Oh yeah I forgot to mension how much I absolutly HATE when people are hipocritical. Like when they say they don't like someone I don't like and then go and hang out with them, not only because I don't like the person but because I absolutly fucking HATE them and can't stand them for the life of me AND because they obviously lied to me about not liking them. Yeah, you know who you are and I just want you to know I CAN'T FUCKING STAND THAT SHIT AND I CAN'T FUCKING STAND YOU EITHER. Fuck off, seriously.

Well now that I have that off my chest. I saw one of the hottest kids I've seen in a while last night. I met him once or twice before through Hooly but I don't know him too well. Kels and I might go hang out with him and his friends tonight if I'm up for it. But right now I'm not up for anything but sitting alone in my room.

Wow, I'm in a rambling kind of mood huh? Sorry to bore anyone with this if people are even reading it.

Yesterday after school I hung out with Sean, Vinny, Ralph, and Kyle for a good hour and a half. I kind of got sucked into it, all I wanted was a ride. So then they brought me to Kelsies. The second I got there we went to the park to watch my loser play baseball. Later on me, Kelsie, my loser, and Jay all hung out at Kelsies for a little while and had a ""water fight."" I got soaked because Kels filled up a pan with water and flung it at me and JEREMY! After our water fight we walked to the dollar store and perrys. We got alot of pointless shit like bubbles, candy, and lais. It took us a good 2 hours to do all of that walking. When we got back my loser JEREMY and Jay left and me and Kelsie sat around pranking people. Kelsie was saying the DUMBEST shit. Haha. This morning I walked Kelsie to her bus stop at 6:30 and Ray picked me up around 7 and brought me to school.

School today was rather boring. I had Mrs.Rice first and all we did was type some lame ass papers on Romeo and Juliet. I slept during all of my other classes.

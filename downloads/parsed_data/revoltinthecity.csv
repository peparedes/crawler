"event","I don't. But it is most certainly nice to think I do. I feel sick for some odd reason.

I went to my uncles house today and visited my cousins Logan and Shenaye (5 and 6). I had my hair tyed up so I took it out and Logan goes ""You look like a mummy! You look like my Mum!!"" I went to leave and he came up to me and said ""I want to go with you!!"" and hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. So cute!

On Palace I was talking to random people as I do, and met someone that likes NoFX so we think we're going to have a baby called Fat Mike now. -Waves- HI DREW!!

Dylan dyed his hair black today, he bitched at me when I did mine. But meh, me and his GF helped him, and she was all freaked cause she got some on her Paul Frank shirt. I woulda given her an old shirt if she asked.. but they went to the movies and saw Scary Movie 3. I haven't been to the movies for ages. I need money. Wait - I need a job.

Counting down - 17 days until my 17th

Love the Hoopla Prunk

Too many nights going to bed at 2am and waking at 10.30. I got the coolest DVD for christmas! It has Rancid, NOFX, Goldfinger, Pennywise and the Dropkick Murphys on it - videos and all and it fuckin' owns. Yes. Anyhow, cheers to Nellie (piratepunk.org) for coding my LJ for me, I'm clueless as to how you do it.

Loverz always

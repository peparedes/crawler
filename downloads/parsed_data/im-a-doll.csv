"event","so like i said... i'm going through a rough patch.  

 when i took the job at ahrc, i felt revived and renewed.  i knew that this position would lead me to bigger and better things.  finally a 'job' that will help me on my path with my career.  i knew it wasn't going to be easy.  this week in particular was probably the most difficult to date.  it wasn't the usual kicked/scratched/hit/spit or vomited on, this week we lost one of our guys.  not just any one, but the one i was probably closest to, and one i loved very dearly.  we found out on monday and my heart is still full of shock and disbelief and ache.  

in addition to that... between the new job and the new year i really have been thinking about the future (probably for the first time in my life).  i want to make a plan.  i want to be out of debt, out of new york, and on my way to my masters in three to four years time.  (i have a lot of debt so... this may be a bit of a stretch.)  there is only one thing i had ever KNOWN i wanted in life and that is to be a mom.  more than anything really.  so all of this leads me to questioning my relationship and where it really is going.  and all of the questioning leads to problems.  i've been on and off with this relationship for six years now.  i know he loves me, and cares about me, but i've really been wondering if we want the same things in life.  i feel like lately everything i do, everything i want, is 'stupid' or 'lame' (because he's told me so), and while i try and let those negative comments roll of my back, it has been becoming harder and harder to.  and of course this all comes to a head with the holidays.  to him it is just another day... nothing special.  and while i may not celebrate these days in their traditional or religious contexts i recognize them as celebrations of life and love.  i feel that this is one of our major disconnects.  

i love him.  i do.  and i know that he is a caring and loving individual.  he is an intelligent, funny, attractive man, with a good heart.  i see all this potential in him that i know he doesn't see in himself.  i want for him to be happy.  happy with himself, and his life.  i want for him to grow as a person and follow his path.  and while i'd like for our paths to follow the same directions... i honestly don't know if they do.  and i don't want to drag him along mine... it isn't fair to either of us.  

there is so much more... but i'm tired now and it is... just too cold in here.  

while this may seem like a huge downer of an entry, i really am ok.  honest.  all in all it is a good thing.  i'm trying to shape my life into something meaningful and something that makes me happy, and of course there are going to be difficult things to deal with along the way... and this is just one of them."

"event","the childhood hero i had seen in him died some time ago.  it took about six years for the rest of him to catch up.  i had been telling eric the story of his fall from my grace merely hours before i got the call from my father that my cousin was in the hospital, and was driving home with george from his house when i picked up to hear he was gone.  the feeling is a mixture of incredible guilt, anger, and surprisingly more sadness than i can explain; but yet, i'm somehow numb.  

i missed the call from chris, his brother, last week to 'personally' invite me to the barbeque at chris and darren's.  it's not in chris' character to hold a family party, and let alone to call for personal invitations.  i found out sunday afternoon that he had called four times while i was away to let me know he wanted me to come.  the universe bends in some strange ways.  

i didn't make it home in time to go to the barbeque and instead opted to go to see george on his birthday.  i am almost, relieved.  bill passed surrounded by his family, the thing he always said mattered most to him."

"event","at approximately one pm yesterday, thursday, the twentyfifth of may, i walked across the stage of radiocity music hall to recieve my b.f.a. in art therapy, summa cum laude.  it hit me about half an hour into commencement, when i turned to kaja and said, ""we are graduating.  we're really through.""  we have said this to each countless times in the past few months, but it wasn't until just then that the words took on any real meaning to me.  kaja has had the twentyseventh of may circled on her calender for months now, with words in red, ""real life starts"".  this fact, has yet to hit me. 

honestly, in the face of this excitement and accomplishment, i have spent the last few days in a low, and have yet to shake it.  i can't quite pin what it is thats been keeping me up at night, and dragging me down during the day.  maybe, it's just one of those things...  and i know that it will pass.
 
during the ceremony, when we were asked to give thanks and applaud those loved ones, friends, and family members who have supported us, i felt i clapped the loudest and hardest of anyone there.  i thought of <i>each and every</i> one of you, and hoped with all my being that at that moment, where ever you were, you all felt somewhere inside of you a sense of love and warmth and incredible thanks from me.  

to my friends here, i love you.  whether i have known you for years, or have had the great pleasure of meeting you recently, or even haven't actually met you at all, yet, know that you are an important part of my life, and will always be.  

i had read once (perhaps here, it may have been one of you that wrote it...) about the misuse of the word awesome.  i myself am guilty of this.  the word was originally meant to be used for something more; that which inspires great beauty, admiration, wonder, and might.  you are all truly <i>awesome</i>.  and i thank you for all of your support, love, kindness, warm thoughts, and encouragment through out our times together and apart.
  

with all of my love,

(my favorite part was that my dad couldn't guess what i was talking about when i said that to him on the phone...)  so.  i'll be getting my b.f.a. on may twentyfifth.  slow and steady wins the race, right?

+ i picked up a little art show type thing at a cafe called <i>the spoon</i> in lindenhurst.  that starts on april twentysixth... but i think we're going to go crash their friday night party on the twentyeighth and have a little opening gathering of our own.  if you'll be on long island, in new york, or hell, in the tri state area, you should come by... they have some awesome desserts and quite a menu of yummy veggie foods.  some of the stuff is up on <a href=""http://life-is-my-art.deviantart.com"">my devart page</a>, but the colors are pretty off, something about scanning them in... or atleast on my screen they are.  

- student loans want me to start paying them.  um... yeah.  the first one was due on the seventeenth of this month.  

- aunt lucille is still in the hospital.  her condition only gets worse, but they seem to think it's time to move her into some sort of physical rehabilitation facility.  (dad just called actually, they'll be moving her today.)  the hospital can't do any more for her... so they're going to try to make her stronger before surgery on her hip.  the chances of her waking up from the surgery are something like ten percent.  what a frighteningly little number ten is.  

+ i found a dress that i would like for christina's wedding.  <a href=""http://www.jasminebridal.com/html/web1/belsoie_2_photo1.asp?id=121"">this dress</a>, in a sage, or lavender... i'm going to go check it out at the location in massapequa as the color chart on the web just... doesn't seem right.  i think it suits me.  you think?  so, now i would like to fit in a smaller size is all.

+ i joined the gym.  and, i've been going.  imagine that.  weight loss to date: eleven pounds.  i was thinking about making some sort of chart with my size, and weight and measurements and all that, and posting it... cause the thought of all of the world being able to read that information would embarrass me into a much, much smaller size.  we'll see.  

- my little sister asked me how my ""stasis"" was going the other day. she meant thesis.  but, it's really funny that she thought it was called a stasis.  (any of you that i talk to on a regular basis know exactly why this would be amusing.  mainly you, seth.)"

on a warm day in the second or third grade, i had put my head down to the desk top to cool my face on the surface.  my hair was long then and i wore it down all the time (this was more my mother's decision than my own).  my hair spread out onto the desk and over to micheal palmeri's.  
""can't you feel that?""
""feel what?""
""that.""
i lifted my head and tried to turn it in his direction but realized he had pinned my hair to his desk with his palm.  
""i can now.""  
""but you can't when your heads down?""
""no.""
""oh.""
he pinched his own hair, which was rather short.  
""but i can feel it.""
he tried my hair again, by this time i had sat up.  he looked at me for some sort of response, but got nothing.
after a puzzled moment he let the issue, and my hair, drop.

"event","the trees dropped their leaves last night under cover of a thick fog... maybe they hoped no one would notice they were naked in the morning.

i did though.  

my bird died last week... i was really upset about it.  there was no warning... he was eating well, he was drinking bottled water, he was very clean and he seemed healthy.  dad said he was out of his cage all day playing, and when he left for nj, rio was back in his cage on his perch looking out the window.  when i got home from work, he wasn't.  we'd only had him for a month or so... he was my sister's before then and she had given him to us because he and her rats didn't seem to get along.  we read the lovebird hand book and did everything it said too... i just don't understand.  

i'm almost done with my internship... only another twenty hours to go.  which is good, as i can use that time to work on thesis and hey, catch up with my printmaking class as i haven't really done anything for it in a month.  or wait... how about grad school things... yeah.  yeah that would be a REALLY good idea.  

my aunt (and father) had a... discussion... with me a month ago, about how i'm obviously having doubts about grad school, and art therapy, and i guess... everything.  which isn't true.  after this internship, i know that art therapy with adolescents is exactly what i want to do.  i WANT to go to grad school... i have to.  WHERE i want to go to grad school is a whole different issue.  most of you know my hesitations about this... but you know... there must be something else that i'm not seeing cause they're right, i haven't really done anything about it.  
my aunt then launched an attack on how i'm going to be twentyfour, and i'm still very much dependent on my father.  this, is a sore spot for me.  the guilt i feel about HOW dependent i am is something i fight with all the time, but can't seem to find a fix for at this point.  i work when i'm not in school, i don't spend money on things that aren't school related.  and coffee.  yes... i do buy coffee kinda often.

so.  i need a plan.  i've needed a plan for ages... i know.  i just keep putting it off."

no seriously.  this could be fun.

it can involve other body parts, ie. hand, foot (if you can manage).  but a representation of yourself.  take that as you will.  don't be too obnoxious...

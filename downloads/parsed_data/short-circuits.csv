                           God grant me the serenity 
                      to accept the things I cannot change; 
                       courage to change the things I can;
                        and wisdom to know the difference. 

                           Living one day at a time; 
                         Enjoying one moment at a time; 
                  Accepting hardships as the pathway to peace; 
                      Taking, as He did, this sinful world
                        as it is, not as I would have it; 
                   Trusting that He will make all things right
                         if I surrender to His Will;
                   That I may be reasonably happy in this life 
                         and supremely happy with Him
                             Forever in the next.
                                     Amen."

"event","Everyday I realize that this might be the last day of my life
Walking down the street 
I find that I'm coming closer and closer to losing my mind
'Cause when it rains, it pours
Isn't life worth more? I don't even know what I'm hustlin' for
You've gotta do what you gotta do just to make it through
All the hard times that's going to face you 

This is the life, trying to survive
This is the life, trying to survive 

Living will always be a struggle looking for someone to love you
Looking back at single horrors, this madness makes me want to hide
Slowly, internally, I'm dying
Pillow case is wet from all my crying
There is nothing more for me to live for
Take me away, I can't live that life no more 

This is the life, trying to survive
This is the life, trying to survive 


I'm just trying to get over

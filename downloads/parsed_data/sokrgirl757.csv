"event","The List 
It's the caffeine, the nicotine, the milligrams of tar. It's my habitat, it needs to be cleaned, it's my car. It's the fast talk they use to abuse and feed my brain. It's the cat box it needs to be changed, it's the pain. It's women, it's the plight for power it's government. It's the way your given knowledge slow with thought control and subtle hints. It's rubbing it, itching it, It's applying cream. It's the foreigners sight seeing with high beams, It's in my dreams. It's the monsters that I conjure, It's the marijuana. It's the embarassment, displacement, It's where I wander. It's my genre, It's Madonna's videos. It's game shows, its cheap liquor,blunts, its bumper stickers with rainbows. It's angels, demons, gods, it's the white devils. It's the monitor, the soundman, it's the motherfucking mic levels. It's gas fumes, fast food, Tommy Hil, mommy's pill. Columbia House music club, designer drugs and rhyming thugs. It's bloods, cripts, fives, six, It's stick up kids, It's christian conservative terrorists, it's porno flicks. It's the east coast, no it's the west coast. It's public schools, it's asbestos. It's metholated, It's techno. It's sleep, life, and death. It's speed, coke, and meth. It's hay fever, pain relievers, oral sex, and smokers breath. It stretches for as far as the eye can see. It's reality, fuck it , it's everything but me.

On and on and on and on
The list goes on and on and on and on
The list goes on and on and on and on
The list goes on and on and on and on

It's in the water, it's in the air, it's in the meat. It's indirect, indiscrete, it's inconsistent, incomplete. It's in the streets, every city everywhere you go. In every man it's the insanity, the fantasys, the casualties. It's the health care system, it's welfare victims. It's assault weapons, it's television religion, and it's false lessons. It's cops, police, pigs with badges guns and sticks. It's harassment and a complex you carry when you're running shit. It's wondering, if you get to eat, it's the heat, It's the winter, the weather. It's herpes, and it's forever. It's the virus that takes the lives of the weak and the strong. It's the drama that keeps on between me and my seed's mom. It's that need to speek long, It's the hunger for attention. It's the wack , who attack songs of redemption
It's prevention, It's the first solution. It's loose its out for retribution, it's mental pollution, and public execution. It's the nails that keep my hands and feet to these boards. It's the part time job that governs what you can afford. It's the fear, It's the fake. It's clear it can make time stop and leave you stranded in the year of the snake. It's the dollar, yen, pound, it's all denominations. It's hourly wages for your professional observations. It's on your face and it's in your eyes everything you be. cuz it ain't me mother fucker, cuz it ain't me.

"event","The pain there it just moves a little

Falling apart, but looking so sane.

No-one knows, no-one really cares. Why me? Nothing to do and scream. And scream. And scream. But only in my head. Can't scream out loud. Draws too much attention. Be strong, be stoic, just be. Want to run away so much it hurts. Hurt so much want to run away. So tired of pretending that everything is alright. I don't even remember what it is to be alright. Just want to be happy, to laugh, to feel whole inside. My dreams are simple, but still dreams. Never good enough. Can't feel right inside. Know it's not meant to feel like this, but can't figure out what it is meant to be. Twisted belief and broken will. Must keep up pretence. Forget why. Body cut and bleeding, reflections of inside. Pain flows out with blood. Unholy cleansing. Darkness comes closer, red keeps it away. Pain comes from within, not from the blade cutting flesh. Voices sing out in dark harmony. Try to accept, nearly manage it. What would happen if I shut down? Blunt words bruise and damage. No-one understands. Too many holes to fill. Tattered remnants inside. Don't mind though. I'm special. Held too many things close. Mistake. Always pay for it. Hurts too much to cry. `

I want to step through the mirror. Or smash into the mirror.
 
Either will do."

i put everything i have into soccer and even though im not one of the best pkayers on the team the coach recognized my contributions to the team and that makes me feel good
I love soccer so much and this has been an awesome season even though i went through alot of crap during it and i ended up being a mess at couple practices and warm ups crying for no reason the team didnt treat me like a nut case even though they probly should have.  Mainly i just wanna thank all you guys for being really cool people and team ates i really do hope that we continue to tlak even though the season is over and good luck to all of you who will be on the team next year.

The rise of the early morning sun. Watching it as it plays a silent silouette, of beauty. Soft flicker of a burning candle, which brings forth it's elegance, truly. Listening to the sound of mystical melody the rain plays. ""You R These Things To Me"" The bright glow from the moon, which brings forth strength of light. Stillness in the darkness silent, yet
powerful, that springs forth night. All the stars fulfilling wishes of the galaxies. ""You R These Things To Me"""

Hold Fast To Dreams 

Hold fast your dreams,
they shelter you through lonely nights,
gently they become the pillow,
that puts destination in your sights.

Hold tight the memories,
the heart ach that burns,
for the one who wins,
is the one who remembers and learns.

Nurture the moments,
handle with care,
for destiny states,
for each heart there`s a pair.

Cast off the anger,
and its deep rooted seed,
remember t'was anger ,
that caused your heart to bleed,

Snuggle each memory,
a warm blanket held tight,
bringing you vision,
guidance, sunlight.

Push away despair, nurture the hope,
so impossible it seems,
but the only way out,
is to hold fast to dreams.  


so i wrote alot today and yesterday and i wrote a couple things for a couple really really special people and if i get up the courage one day you will get to read them"

"event","So soccer has been seriously disapointing this year and my mom and i started talking about it and now i dont know if im going to play anymore

I dont know if thats what I want but i think its what's more realistic and better in the long run?

I mean Mike cant keep paying and im not good enough to spend so much time and money doing it when im sucking at school right now

Im not even good enough for varsity and next year thats all i can play and at OL there will already be 3 returners and at kellam there will be 2 returners and a current sophomore. Senior year there wouild be 2 at kellam and like 4 at OL so i dont know if there is any point to switching schools next year or if i should wait till senior year or if i should go at all, I dont have a clue what im doing with that and then in select i play classic which is basically used for developing players for swoosh and nike and they just took 4 field players up and 2 players went beach fc including my back up goalie so now im the only goalie so i wont play any field at all and the swoosh team for my age only has one goalie so really they could have pulled either me or sara up but the coach only wants to carry one goalie but if that goalie gets hurt he expects one of the goalies from my team to be willing to move up at the drop of dime (so that means me sense im the only one left)but i dont know if i even want to basically soccer just has me pulled in about 50 different directions right now and i dont know which one i should go in but yeah i just had to put that all down in writing and thats not all of it but thats enough ok so goodbye kathryn and kelly and Marissa and Joe and Ally and Sara and this is gonna suck but yeah so much for Shock

Too scared to pull the trigger,
Too weak to draw the blade.
The tears announce my failure
In an endless dark parade.

The ultimate of cowards, 
Trapped in basic need,
Unable to release oneself,
From suffering's grasp be freed.

Dear child, can't you hear me call,
A tiny, shaking voice,
A gentle tug upon your arm.
It's I that made this choice.

True valor is not found in blood
But in your will to live
And that you trust the promises
Of all you have to give.

My courage kept your hands from harm
And not you lack of will.
Your life is proof of bravery,
And that, you'll never kill.

"event","Have u ever cut yourself to see how much it would bleed?
To let all the pain escape, it is oh such a beautiful creed.
The pain from the cuts dissolves all the pain and angst inside,
Making everything disappear, including every last tear that you've ever cried.

You shed them so often, those never-ending tears,
Each one so miniscule, carrying a dark load of overwhelming fears,
Those fears that hold you back from advancing farther in life,
Just because your afraid to face your fears, and help ease the strife.

Your only true friend in life happens to be the sharp and bloody blade,
The one and only thing that is always by your side to help serenade.
Serenade your screaming soul, help erase all the pain,
Control you racing thoughts, retaining you from suicide and dieing in vain.

Too bad no ones there to lend a shoulder for those tears,
Their abandonment feels like one million sharp, penetrating spears.
A spear to the heart leaves you with an empty soul deep within,
Your mind being played over and over, like and extensively used violin.

Racing heart and speeding mind, you're inevitably going insane,
Knees buckling, you fall to the ground, feeling as though you've been hit by an oncoming train.
My body's just not cut out for this, nor is my mind,
And I'm afraid it's my life, that I'll have to leave behind.




I dont uderstand feelings anymore.. I would love to just be numb  i know im not alone but im to afraid to give it all up to one person i have to be stronger then that i am stronger then that i shouldnt need peopole but i do im so weak and thats what scares em the most if i become dependent on someone then what happens when they leave cause they will they never stick around it doesnt work that way it will turn out bad and i cant take that cause im to weak  i dont think any of that made sense to anone but me but i needed to say it so now im done"

"event","As my world falls down around me
     My grievances know no bounds.
     The best friend in my life commits suicide,
     Her blood spilled on the ground.
     My world now falls to shame.

     The echoes of a silenced cry
     Ring steadily through my mind,
     Only to be brought to a halt
     Because of the imminent time.
     Her blood flowed red
     To stain the rug.
     And painfully,
     For her cries proved it so.
     I never understood her need
     For the ever constant pain.
     Was it possibly the drugs
     That compelled her to end her life?
     Or was it just her crazy friends
     Who's echoes have long since been dead?

     The echoes of an eternal cry
     Are now bound for life.
     Promises of a Hell-sent queen
     Silence the shouts of angst and doubt.
     Clouding the mind with dark lies
     Of seemingly innocent denials
     That twist and abuse the soul
     Until dark is light
     And light is dark.
     None can reverse that which has occurred
     And as hard as any may attempt at it
     No one who has tried has been able
     To fully reverse the effects there-in.
     And she has been taken.
     And thrust into a world of lies
     Where black is white
     And white is now black.
     What is there to say to she
     Who cannot tell what is truth
     And believes all lies are reality?
     Her echoes are no longer heard,
     For they have been silenced by
     The Hell-sent queen.

     Her echoes have slowly faded
     Back against the constant wail.
     The few clear words were Heaven sent,
     But Heaven is no more.
     It has left us to the mercy
     Of the fates and tortured souls.
     And there is no salvation
     With no chance of survival.
     Her wavering howls diminished,
     They reflect the world's angst
     Showing of true pain and worship
     For those not of the gods' send.
     Grimacing from the torture
     And aching from the speed
     Of consistant battering
     Her cries die down -
     No longer as sharply heard.


     The echoes of a tortured spirit
     Bring about incredulous results
     Of disbelief and denied shame.
     Her moans are soft,
     But still remain
     For her denial quiets the volume
     Only to her ears.
     Her hearing almost deaf,
     Family means nothing more to her
     Friends mean even less.
     They are an ambushing group
     Of blood-related peoples
     And others of mental kin,
     Wanting to see her reduced
     To a silent cooperative lamb.

     But her echoes are still heard,
     Though soft, but filled with need.
     And as the people tend to say,
     ""The quietest voice
     Is always heard."""

"event","i want to fall from the tallest building
for once maybe i could fly
i could spread my arms open
and close my eyes
i could scream good-bye to this cruel world
while the deadly wind blows against me
head first, i would hit the welcoming asphalt 
i want to take a bottle of sleeping pills
and guzzle them down with sweet death
i could enter eternal sleep
and never have to turn off my fire-engine alarm clock 
oh, sweet coma
please let me lie within your cool sheets forever 
i have wondered what it feels like
to have a tight rope snuggled around my neck
i do not think i would want to try that
knowing that my survival could reign instead of my death 
do i want to die by the gun
pointing at this thing one would call a brain?
it would be an instant death
but i think watching myself suffer would be best 
hand me the bottle of aspirin
i want to paint my wrists red
i will laugh at the puddles of blood at my ankles
i could laugh until i was dead
but for now i will stare at the knife which i use
because it reminds me of your tongue 
i hate myself
i hurt everyone who matters
the ones who do not matter hurt me
i go to bed at night wishing i could be a naive child
who thinks that if you smile the world will smile back"

"event","The Urge

Do you know what it's like
To hold a gun to your head
Or get some pills to overdose
And wish that you were dead?
Have you ever broken glass
To slice open your arm
Or tried to find something
That could cause yourself some harm?
And if for some strange reason
You got the urge to die
Do you think that on a busy street
You'd watch the cars drive by?
Sure, if you had a reason
It would be the thing to do
But what if for no reason
The thought came over you?
Of course you wouldn't understand
How I could think that way
But it's something I must go through
As I struggle through each day. 




Life has taken 
A turn for the worse.
I wanna give up,
My heart hurts.

I'm sick of pain,
And I no longer care.
What you do to me
Just isn't fair.

Goodbye mom,
Goodbye dad,
Goodbye all the friends I had.
I'm going off
To a better place.
I don't wanna hurt no more.
Nothing matters anymore.

Who will care
When I'm gone?
You're absolutely right
When you say ""no one"".

I embrace the cold
And dark of Death.
Please take me now,
This is my last breath.

Goodbye mom,
Goodbye dad,
Goodbye all the friends I had.
I'm going off
To a better place.
I don't wanna hurt no more.
Nothing matters anymore.

So goodbye mom,
And goodbye dad,
I won't miss all the friends I had.
I'm going off
To a better place
Where I won't hurt no more.
Nothing matters anymore."

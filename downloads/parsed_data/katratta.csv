"event","And I always get a little down when it's late. All alone and at night I'm left with my thoughts and I realize the weakness of my coping ability. During the day I keep myself too occupied and cheery to really let in anything serious. Now that I sit here however, I am reminded of a particularly disturbing dream I had a couple nights ago. This one involved my brother. Often after some of the dreams involving him are had, I write them down, mostly because they are a nice reminder of who he was, and they leave me very reflective. This last one however, was had and then forgotten, that is until about the middle of the next day. I was sitting by myself and suddenly remembered the horrible details. The dream involved my brother getting in a vehicle and then proceeding to drive down an icy road, he then crashed the car. For the most part he appeared fine, but on closer inspection he had crushed his face and pieces of skull and brain were protruding from his head. The most disturbing part is that he was walking around like that as if nothing had happened, and that I was an outside spectator for the whole ordeal, not saying anything and not doing anything, even though there was a feeling that I knew what was going to happen. Dreams like that are not uncommon for me. Earlier this summer I dreamed that I had been severed in two, and that my indifference and my parents indifference were the most disturbing parts. Anyway, I guess I'm back to the depressing journal posts."

"event","Ever come to the conclusion that you hate who you are? Well that's slowly the conclusion I have slowly come to. Due to the past events of 2005, I have never wanted to be somewhere else so badly. Being alone is once again becoming a very attractive concept. I'm not just talking about never dating, but in general I'm starting to think that being completely closed off is the route for me. In the past the more unemotional I was, the happier I was. I think this is just what holidays do to me. Sitting around with mom and dad and brother, pretending that we have a normal family still just proves to depress the hell out of me, and I grow resentful, on top of that there was talk on my moms behalf that she wanted to try and get back together with my dad. If that happened, I don't know if I would ever go home again. The things I once thought I had gotten over were shoved in my face, the anger, bitterness and hatred, the things I will never really forgive my parents for and in specific my mom. I'm not liking this new feeling of depression, its slowly getting worse as the new semester rolls in, with the thought of parties and feelings of helplessness that come along with drinking and the complete loss of emotional control that also comes along with that lifestyle. There was a time when nobody ever saw me cry or saw any strong emotion. I have always liked to think that I am a master of my emotions, no one can affect them and I can turn them off with no problem, lately that's becoming harder. Life's just weighing me down, and I just want to get out, I need to leave and go somewhere else where I don't need to care about anyone or anything. Anyway I'm tired."

"event","So it turns out that I am not as awkward as I used to be, thank god I grew out of that. Anyway, I have once again realized that the BBC Radio 1 is the best thing ever, you can listen online to any genre of music you want to, even live concerts sometimes. So I think I am going to ramble. School is almost over and I cannot wait, but it sucks cause this week is going soooooo slow, soon freedom will come, also I think I may have found a home for next semester, we are going to go look at it tomorrow, this guy have three, three bedroom apartments, with a good price too. I am once again looking forward to living with my good friends next semester. Damn I love british pop/alternative rock, it kicks ass. Ahh off to snack........ooo Gay Bar.......... Wow anyway, good study break, back to rambling. So I saw this guitarist on friday I believe, anyway he was from boulder his name is Trace Bundy and he is pure sex on guitar, a genius I haven't heard anything like it, check it out. Also if you ever are in the nee for some interesting reading there is the autobiography of this Japanese rock/pop idol named Gackt, he has lived through alot and he wrote it all down, his music may not be that spectacular but his views on life are quite interesting and he is quite inspiring as well here's the link: http://fiyaa.com/gackt/info/bio.php
Also check out Lisa Rands, she's a climber and she mostly boulders. crazy shit. She is phenomenal and at least you can appreciate the muscle tone, she is completely ripped: www.lisarands.com
More random crap; My brother is getting an apartment with his girlfriend, which I guess isn't that strange, except she has a five year old, so noe there is a kid involved if it doesn't work out, I guess I'm not too worried usually my brother has things really figured out and he's pretty damn sure about this, he usually doesn't get over emotional over girls especially recently, he's kept a pretty good head on his shoulders. I do like his girlfriend and her family is so much like ours that it's scary. 
Also I would suggest to anyone to check out some asian culture, it's totally cool. Check out Japan they are something else, of course they have their faults just like anyone else but their culture is unlike anything else, the whole country is like one big family, I wonder what it's like to be in a country that isolated, think about it really no where else speaks Japanese, they have a language all to themselves. I guess I'm just excited I'm attempting to learn Japanese next semester, should be interesting, but what I really want to do is eventually study in Japan ideally in Okinawa, which I guess you could say isn't really Japan, they consider themselves on their own, completely different culture and even differences in the language.  Well I think that's it. Goodbye"

"event","So here it is, another bad entry, sorry I just don't feel like writing when I'm happy. So here's the story; my mom calls me last night, to see if I wanted to go see a movie, I declined. I could tell she was somewhat pissed off because she didn't say bye, little did I know the storm that would be unleashed. Anyway fast forward to today, my dad and her were planning on going out to lunch, don't know why, but just before my dad meets her, she shows up at the front door, packing heat. She demands to know the underlying reason why I didn't feel like going out with her, I am in utter shock by now, I mean I knew my mom was mad, but holy crap, this was old school, so my dad hears the argument, and this being his house and all decides he is not liking the conversation. At this point my mom is in to the whole conspiracy of my dad turning me against her, and that he should be making me spend time with her, even though I'm 20. It would be easy to argue with her, except for the fact that she brings up the past, in this topic I hold my tongue, there is major potential to unleash some bombs on my behalf, but my dad and her start getting into a fight about the divorce and who's fault it was, and how I must hate her because I don't spend anytime with her. Anyway that was the eventful morning, she basically threatened to cut off our relationship, because I'm selfish and I screw up relationships, cause you see she does nothing wrong. So now I'm kind of freaking out, even though she always does this, this was especially bad, and I know she is completely capable of cutting our relationship, she did it with her mom, and her brothers. So we shall see."

"event","Is it bad that I have no idea what I want to do with my life, really it's mostly the fact that there are so many things i wish to do, and no time to do them, also this thing called school is getting in the way. And all of these things I want to do well, I don't want to half ass anything even though there is a part of me that doesn't think I will ever be good enough in anything. Wow I always seem to be bitching when I post, oh well, anyway, I need more time, life is going way too fast and there are so many things I have not done, I hate the prospect of being an adult especially getting married and being tied down in one spot, that has to wait till I'm in my thirties, so I guess I'm not too worried, considering my dating status. But that also scares me, I am now and probably forever will be the dateless wonder, I'll be that old lady that lives in the woods and smokes pipes while I take care of my many cats, seriously, I'm psyching myself up for it. Nothing is happening the way I want it too. Turns out I won't be able to do my UDQE (upper division qualifying exam) for flute next semester, because my professor sucks at advising and neglected to tell me that i needed to have Music History done with, or at least enrolled in. I was waiting to do music history till my junior year. If Sylvia actually cared about her students I might have known this, instead of thinking that for once in my flute student career that I was getting ahead, well it looks like it's back to mediocrity for me. I really am just temped to switch schools, but probably won't due to the fact that I plan on going to grad school, which won't be in Greeley, and the fact that it is cheap. I just hope that our next flute professor cares about our academic careers enough to give good advice, and actually be available as an adviser.  Anyway, I think I am going to make a list of all the things I wish to do and study as well as all the places I wish to go in my lifetime.

"event","So I was thinking today, well just now, that I am slowly distancing everyone from myself. Or at least I think I am. It just seems like that I don't have anywhere where I belong, I float between groups of people, but at the end of the day I really mostly hang out by myself, or with my family. It seems to me that everyone I know would rather hang out with someone else besides me, kind of like I'm their second choice, when no one else is around. I don't know maybe I'm just being neurotic, maybe I'm just hungry, but it seems that I don't really serve any purpose as a friend. I really am just ranting. Another thing,. I really don't think I listen to my emotions at all. I guess that can be good, but it seems whenever I am mad or depressed or frustrated I never think it has to do with any outside influences, and that it's just me being stupid, so I never think I have an excuse to be any of those things, so they end up adding up and eventually I'll just break, as usual, for no good reason. Maybe something happened to me when I was younger that made me not want to share emotions or get close to people, maybe I'm just crazy, well most likely I am just crazy, I'll wake up in the morning and everything will be fine and how it should be, and i'll read this post and think, holy shit, I was freaking out for no good reason. I have nothing to be sad or angry about, and if I do it could be worse. Anyway, back to theory."

But now I find myself hating all of the new freshmen, and it's for absolutely no reason, they are just too good, and it's pissing me off soo much. Ahh but I will have to deal. There will always be people better than me, not if I have anything to do with it. I'm actually a very competitive person, contrary to popular belief."

     Now on the the interesting part of my day. I was leaving to go to the grocery store via sliding glass door, meaning I usually turn sideways in order to close it and there is a step down. Anywho as I exit mi casa, I go to place my foot down on my deck, low and behold, my ankle had other plans. Upon landing, my ankle, and foot in general, twisted so it was completely parallel with the deck, thus producing an extreme amount of pain, causing me to lift my weight off and to swear. I get back in my house and am now lying on the floor holding my foot, and begining to cry. I'm not sure what i did, all I know is that I heard a crack (but then again what's new) in my ankle and my poor little pinky toe went numb. But never you mind, it ended in hysteria, as I laughed off the pain."

My last day of work is tomorrow, and I am actually sad about it, I really enjoyed working there and they liked me too, which is a bonus. I will most likely be working there over winter break. Yay!! Anyway that is all for now.
 More things that rule:
-Malice Mizer - a band that resembles anime characters, plus they sound cool, which is always good.
- Klaha - lead singer of Malice Mizer, once again my fascination with men that wear makeup will never cease to be.
- Tiger Army
- Twist & Shout

- Tropicals

"event","So I decided to update, figured I haven't said much to many people in a while. Well I started working about a month ago, trained for a couple of days, and now I am roaring off on my own. You know you're sad when you have basically every annual and perennial sku memorized. Ah well makes for some fast typing. The one thing that has sucked is that I lost ten dollars the other day, that's what I get for not counting out change out loud, oh well turns out it wasn't a big deal. I officially work full time and my weekend is wednesday and thursday, woohoo!! (Not really) I get alot of nothing done on those days, shopping and I went climbing. What is interesting about working at the Evergreen Nursery, is that I run into alot of people I know, my old Kindergarten teacher, Mrs. Andrade, and my flute teacher. What is also cool is I have gotten to know some people from high school better, I work with Sierra Braschear and Emily Tutuer (however you spell there names). Being a Cashier has been the hardest thing I have ever had to do, since I hate talking to people and all, but my gift for always being in a good mood no matter what has paid off, there are some royal jerks that come in. 

That's all as far as work goes, social life; not much, saw the Harry Potter movie, sat through it wondering what would ever possess someone to bring their three year old to it, and then laughing because they won't be getting much sleep in the next few days, then I left the theater rather disenchanted, not really ever wanting to see another Harry Potter film in the theater again, seriously it was a waste of my time and money.

"event","and despairing to a point, that as long as I can remember, I have always tried my hardest to make others happy, and just recently I figured out that I get absolutely nothing in return. I tend to let people walk all over me to some extent, and I guess it has to with my extreme will to make everyone get along and and avoid confrontation as much as possible. The majority of friends that I have ever had tend to end up making me feel like shit, so I just stopped being friends with them, I never believed in staying in abusive relationships, and usually loose respect for the human being and cut off all ties to them. I have lost many a friend because they didn't give me the respect I deserved.

"event","Finally school is over and I can enjoy two marvelous weeks of doing nothing. Lt's see here after graduation I ventured home, when I got there my dad had apparently already found a car, so he swept me away as soon as i got home to go look at it. Long story short I have a car; it's a '95 Subaru impreza coupe, and the new love of my life. It's also green, yay! Let's see I had a job interview Sunday, and I start work on saturday the 30th, I get to train on probably the busiest weekend of the year; by the way I will be working the cash register at Evergreen Nursery. On that same day I talked to my mom twice, once was when I told her about the job and the second time she blew up at me for not having time for Mother's Day, even though we had just planned on doing it later on in the week, when things are less hectic, so we didn't talk for a day, but she ended up showing to go get the car with dad and I, so that is good, and everything is fine. Other than that not much has been happening I still need to unpack, but seriously who wants to do that. As nice as it would be to walk around in my room, it would involve cleaning and I just can't make that kind of commitment fight now. Ooo funny story. So it seem that my cat Dusty disappeared for a few days, he did return but when he returned he was covered in oil, so today I agreed to help my mom clean him. Considering I did not raise a pacifist for a cat, I stopped by Kingsoopers to pick up some Catnip in hopes of getting him in a more amiable mood. So I arrived dressed in my worst prepared for a battle. Turns out it wasn't much of a battle, Dusty strained most of the time and tried to escape the rest of the time, seems he gives up fighting against two people, so we got him mostly clean, we tried to dry him off, but mostly he just walked around (""coming down"") looking rather silly (he wasn't completely wet, just his feet and stomach, but the rest of his hair just sticks up in all directions)and shaking his feet around like something was stuck to them. So whenever you need some entertainment, get you cat wet, it will keep you laughing for days.
That is all"

"event","Well I was really looking forward to spring break, especially because I was going to see AFI on the 19th, well I was just at their site and low and behold the tour is canceled. Ah well such is life.

I do have good news however, I am moving. It will be official, everyone from Conifer will be on the second floor. Pathetic huh? Anyway, my new roommate is a girl from Littleton called Emily, she seems really nice, but quiet. I think it will work out, we are however without a mini fridge. There's always something.

Well that's the news for now, more to come soon."

"event","Yeah for breaking down in front of my flute professor. Finally everything that has been bothering me came to a head today. So I walked into my lesson ready to talk about school choices and why my jaw is sticking, and I lost it. She of course thought I was on the verge of passing out and told me to sit down and drink some water (she tends to over-react). We then had a long heart to heart about dealing with difficult people, and just difficult situations in general. It was a very good lesson, and I understand Sylvia alot more now."

"event","I did the unthinkable last night, and actually expressed my desire to sleep and that Tasha being on the computer is why (after all she is always complaining on how I never tell her what's wrong). So I did, and what does she do? She gets mad, saying that she's talking to her mother online, so I offer the somewhat obvious answer; to call her. Then the rest is a blur, she said something about how this is her room and she can do whatever she wants, so then I reply it's my fucking room too, and I should be able to fucking sleep at night. So, as you may have gathered we're yelling now (I don't think I have ever been that mad or yelled that loud, apology to neighbors). 

I then had a revelation when she said something along the lines of ""Why don't you move out already!!!!"" Which of course I retaliated and said ""I'm not moving anytime soon"" (a lie). But the revelation was that this is officially not my room anymore, and that maybe, for the past week, she has been trying to get me to move faster. So as much as I want to spite her and stay, I'll probably end up moving. 

So you win Tasha, you get the fucking room to yourself, you inconsiderate bitch!!!!"

"event","Yes, yes it has, and here are the latest updates. A couple of weeks ago I went home and got to see my puppy and my kitty(dog: Buddy, cat: Dusty) It was mass happiness to see them, I miss them everyday. They are both well in case you were wondering, and they say hi to everyone. Anyway, I haven't been home since. Oh well hopefully next weekend. 

Moving on, I got some interesting news from my dad telling me that a certain Justin would like to talk to me. So I called the cell provided, and we had a good conversation, we wanted to invite me to a party at he and Ryan's house, me having no car said I couldn't, and him having no car said that if he did he would gladly pick me up. Weird huh??

Also I am contemplating my current degree path. I was originally set as a Bachelor of Music, but then after a discussion with my flute professor, and rekindled interest in anthropology, I may want to double major and then do doctoral work on ethnomusicology. Anyway I have time to decide, and what it boils down to is that I don't need a BM to perform anyway, and that it's alot easier, and I can take more cooler classes if I am just a BA.

Also, I may be moving out of this God forsaken room. My roommate and I met with Josh, our RA, and I basically told what was bothering, it took about 45 minutes, so this is still the trial week for us to start working things out, which has not been happening so I may be out of here.

Well I think that is just about it. Of course I will post if anything interesting comes up."

I find out that there is a lizard loose in it. Fucking shit, how stupid do you have to be. I am really close to telling my R.A. I can't handle it anymore, It is one thing after another, It's bad enough having to deal with her keeping her fucking bike in here(Don't see the point, it's a piece of walmart shit anyway), now I have to deal with the idea that I may step on a lizard or the idea that I will find it rotting in the room at the end of the year. Either way I'm getting her fucked, this was the last fucking straw."

"event","Not much going on now but last wednesday was our band trip. It was so much fun, I actually met people in my band. Seems reasonable, I've only known them for a semester. Oh well better late than never. Anyway it was awesome hanging out with people who genuinely like music, you know jazz, classical just good music, and that also like band. My section is also really close now, we're like a clan. There is one thing that will always set me apart from them and that is that most of them hate Sylvia, my flute professor, and I like her, she's actually nice to me and the sad thing is it's probably because I'm a performance major, so certain conversations are hard to listen to. Basically I can't stand it when people complain but I grin and bare it most of the time. Anyway the trip was awesome and I am glad that I have met the people I have met. So much for getting away from band kids.

After I got back from the trip on Friday, I hung out with my friends in the basement of Wilson, we had sort of a party, because Andrea's friend was visiting. Afterward we helped Andrea's drunk friend back to his dorm and then tried to find a party. OK, this is how lame Greeley is; even when you're looking for a party you can't find them, there is officially nothing to do after 12 in Greeley, and if there were any parties they were not loud enough, and therefore not a good party in any respect. It was fun looking anyhow, minus the mind numbing cold."

"event","Now that school has begun, the true reality of what I am doing here has been realized. As a music performance major, I have to realize that it's not supposed to be easy, and that there are going to be some days when I will want to quit, but I don't. music just means too much to me. Quite frankly I cannot picture my life without flute. I need to look ahead but yet at the same time take it one day at a time. Music should not be a burden and I can't let opinions turn it into one. Flute is sometimes not going to be fun and I won't always want to do it, but in the long run it will be worth it. Life is just one big learning experience folks, and there isn't enough time to get held back by the negative ones. 

Wow how preachy was that. Anyway with that all said and done I still hate my roommate, and I need to talk to my RA about switching rooms, because I cannot rely on her switching. But remember learning experience."

Apparently when she left for Christmas vacation she was in a hurry, and trashed the room. I wasn't even expecting her to come back this coming semester. Oh well time to grin and bear it, at least until I am angry enough to kill someone, preferably her. I wasn't really looking forward to Greeley, and now I would rather die than go back to that hell hole.

Anyway it was quite interesting, we rode the light rail into Downtown Denver, which was a first for me, and then we waited for about two hours to get a table at the Cheesecake Factory.

"event","Christmas is a pointless holiday for me. I didn't look forward to it at all. Everything that Christmas used to stand for and what it meant to me has lost all meaning. I used to think it was about the presents, but this year as I waited for this holiday to arrive I realized that I really didn't want anything for Christmas. All I wanted was to be home. Anyway that ended when my mom informed me that she wanted to spend Christmas as a family (my parents are divorced), so sure enough Christmas morning the whole family gets together to open presents. Except that your parents don't really get anything for each other, and it is painfully awkward. To top it all off, my brother's girlfriend called, and was apparently freaking out because she has a family situation, similar to why my parents got divorced. So we started talking about it and realized I should probably watch what I was saying around my mother, so that was mass weirdness. On a happier note I got to see my other family member and I met my brother's girlfriend's family."

"event","So computer illiterate. I so wrote something interesting, but then I turned into a genius and deleted it all. CRAP!!!!  Oh well, I'll sum up what I said, I don't have a car, so I basically walk everywhere. So I decided to walk to the mall today(about 20 minutes), quite an adventure considering that people have no idea how to treat pedestrians. So I almost got hit by someone making a right turn when I had a walk signal. 

And I thoroughly depressed myself when I went to the pet store. The people who sell puppies in those stores have got to be the most heartless human beings on the planet. 
The top price I will ever pay for one of those dogs is fifty bucks. When I pay $500 for a dog I am not just paying to the animal, I am paying for how it was raised and how healthy it is not how healthy it was born!!!!!!  Shit like that pisses me off."

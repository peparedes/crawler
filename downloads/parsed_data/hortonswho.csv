Nothing very cool band aids couldn't help and a few princess stickers! Short post today. I'm trying to do three things at once. Have a great day everyone!"

"event","Yesterday I was complaining about too much time alone. Today, Kait and John both were home. They both had the stomach flu. I will never&nbsp; complain again!!! Today, I decided to embrace the whole stay at home mom thing and spent all afternoon making dinner. I bought fresh peas still in the pod, shucked them or whatever you&nbsp; do to get the peas out of the pod. Then, I simmered the fresh peas, fresh mushrooms, fresh celery and a chopped up garlic clove in olive oil. I&nbsp;added some red and yellow bell peppers. It was a work of art! It smelled so good! I should have stopped there, but I wanted to turn it into a tuna noodle casserole, so I&nbsp;added cream of celery soup. Big mistake, so I &quot;fixed it&quot; by adding sharp and mild cheddar cheese and two can's of tuna. I added&nbsp; the noodles and put a cracker and butter topping. It looks pretty, is palatable, and I'll never make it again! Dinner from scratch 0 - frozen corn dogs 1."

"event","I've been away for awhile. I've been in a real slump. I retired from work a year ago and that has thrown me into a tailspin. I'm going to be using this space to try to figure out what's next in my life. I'm 47 and that's too young to say it's all over. I have my family, but I need to be doing something else. Any feedback from what's left of my livejournal friends during this period will be greatly appreciated.

"event","It's raining in Virginia.&nbsp; It's different here when it rains.&nbsp; In Illinois, the storms charged through. Violent and destructive. High winds, loud thunderclaps, intense lightening. In Virginia, you're really not sure if it raining or if the air is wet. I walked a 1/2 mile to Kait's school to pick her up, waited outside for her for 15 minutes and we walked the 1/2 mile home. It was &quot;raining&quot;. If I were driving I would have used my wipers, but all I had was a fine mist on my hair!! Virginia is certainly a gentle state."

Work has been so insane!&nbsp; Last year we served 1,068 homeless kids.&nbsp; In the first 2 months of this school year we have already served 458.&nbsp; It's frightening how bad the economy is getting.&nbsp; All the shelters have waiting lists and the one overnight shelter-that lets anyone in- has 18 kids there every night.&nbsp; They sleep in the same room as the druggies, alcoholics and prostitutes.&nbsp; Winter is coming and it's going to be a long cold one I think.&nbsp; I&nbsp;hope we see some changes in this town quickly or many families are going to be out in the cold.

I let my friend cut my hair for me last night.&nbsp; Not a good idea!&nbsp; She cut it so short!&nbsp; I think it's about 1/2 inch long all the way around!&nbsp; I can't complain, though, I told her to cut it as short as she could and she did! OY. Well, exhaustion is setting in.&nbsp; Good night all and have a great weekend!"

I would work hard until the day I left.  Instead, I find myself not wanting to do much but the fun stuff.  I've worked with homeless kids for 20 years and I wonder what it will be like to not change lives everyday.  I feel like I'm somehow shirking my duty as a member of the human race by taking some time off and caring for my family and myself.  One of my tutors said I was changing Rachel, Kaitlin and John's lives by being available to them.  I guess I could buy that.  She also reminded me that even Jesus took time off to regroup.  I hoping Rach and the kids will be here in a couple of weeks.  I am so excited by all that is happening, but slightly terrified, too.  Well, I'm off to fight a velociraptor!!!"

"event","Ginger's funeral was last Saturday.&nbsp; Visitation was from 11-1 and the family had to arrive at 10am.&nbsp; Kaitlin went and looked a Grandma in the casket and then came and whispered to me, ""How come they won't let us see&nbsp;Gramma's feet""?&nbsp; I told her I didn't know,&nbsp;but they always keep the bottom half of the casket closed.&nbsp; Apparently that didn't satisfy her, so she approached the&nbsp;funeral director and&nbsp;asked her why she couldn't see her Gramma's face.&nbsp; So, in the middle of the visitation, the funeral director opened the casket up all the way and moved all the satin covering to show Kaitlin Gramma's feet!&nbsp;&nbsp;She then went on to answer every single question Kait had about how the body was treated and how they made Gramma look so good after being so sick.&nbsp; Kaitlin then told me that Gramma died on her side, so they had to mush her face back into shape!&nbsp; OOOOOOOWWWWWWW, more information than I&nbsp;REALLY wanted to know!

During the funeral, northern Illinois was hit with an ice storm so we ended up having to spend another night at Ginger's house.&nbsp; The boys then took the stuff they wanted and we were all off by Sunday morning.&nbsp; We missed the worst of the ice, but because we&nbsp;weren't home to shovel our driveway is a sheet of ice.&nbsp; Winter has definitely arrived in Rockford!&nbsp; Today the wind chill was -14F.&nbsp; For those of you in the warm parts of the world-that is freakin cold!!!!&nbsp; It&nbsp;snowed 6"" yesterday and we're supposed to get another 4"" tomorrow.&nbsp; I'll never get&nbsp;the driveway cleared at this point.&nbsp; Ordinarily, this wouldn't be a problem, but we're having company over on Saturday and they won't be able to walk up the driveway without sliding back&nbsp;down! LOL.

Tomorrow is Donuts with Dad at Kait's school.&nbsp; They have to be there&nbsp;at 7:15 am.&nbsp; It's good to be the Mom this time.&nbsp; This Sunday we make another trip to Ottawa to help the family empty out the rest of Ginger's house so we can put it on the market.&nbsp; 17 days until I get to hug my grandbabies.&nbsp; I'm so excited if I had a tail it&nbsp;would fall off from wagging!&nbsp;"

On the work front for me, I had a former client bring in a bunch of winter coats for other families and she was so proud she was showing each one to me.&nbsp; As she did that, a roach came flying out of the box.&nbsp; As soon as she left the custodian came and made the box and&nbsp; coats disappear&nbsp; for me.&nbsp; I haven't been able to find the rogue roach, though.
After that, another woman came in to get clothes for her daughters.&nbsp; She had just come home from the hospital 3 days ago after having her ovaries removed.&nbsp; She has ovarian cancer and they think it's gone into her lymphatic system.&nbsp; Anyway, she did too much and started vomiting into the trash can.&nbsp; I called the custodian again and he came and took care of it.&nbsp; Meanwhile,&nbsp; someone brought in 5 frozen turkeys that began to defrost all over the floor before the families could come and get them.&nbsp; So I&nbsp; called the custodian and he came and mopped up the turkey goop!&nbsp;&nbsp;

On the other hand, I got to spend an hour rocking a 3 day old baby boy and that makes everything else bearable!&nbsp; There's nothing more inspirational than new life.&nbsp; My job is really weird."

Oh and a really wonderful thing happened today.&nbsp; I sent out a district-wide email asking if any of the schools would be willing to do a coat and mitten drive for the homeless program and I received over 50 responses from the Superintendent on down to indiviual teachers wanting to help.&nbsp; Some of these schools&nbsp;have 90% of the student body living below the poverty level, yet the kids will dig up coats to donate and hats and mittens.&nbsp; I'm always amazed at the capacity of the human heart!

Our Bunnies, Snuggle Bunny and Cuddle Bunny (Kaitlin was 4 when she named them)&nbsp; have recently turned 4years old.&nbsp; I didn't know bunnies could live that long.&nbsp; I guess they can live from 8-10 years!&nbsp; Happy Birthday Bunnies!"

Life is good!

Kaitlin and her friends found a kitten in the backyard and made him a bed on the loveseat on the sunporch.&nbsp; They went to the neighbors and got cat food and gave him a bowl of milk.&nbsp; I think we have a cat now.&nbsp; It will have to live outside, because I'm very allergic to cats.&nbsp; It has a flee collar on so we are going to try to find it's home tomorrow.&nbsp; Meanwhile it will be safe for the night.&nbsp; I know nothing about cats!!!! I am definitely a dog person.

Kaitlin is doing well in school.&nbsp; She decided to be a Mummy for Halloween, so we took a green sheet, died it in tea water and tore it into strips.&nbsp; We then proceeded to wrap her up for the party at school.&nbsp; The wraps started to fall off so we glued them to her tights and pinned them to her shirt.&nbsp; It was a riot.&nbsp; She was glued, pinned and duck taped together and still started to shed her ""skin""&nbsp; in the middle of the Monster Mash.&nbsp; When we got home we discovered we had glued the tights to her.&nbsp; After cutting the costume off of her and washing off the glue and make up we were all laughing so hard our sides hurt!&nbsp; She decided she wanted to be a ghost for the trick or treating part!&nbsp; Smart kid.

So much more has happened but in the interest of preserving online friendships, I'll feed it out a little at a time.&nbsp; Meanwhile,&nbsp; thanks for hanging in there with me."

"event","<p>&nbsp;After a very long dry spell, I have my own laptop again.&nbsp; You may or may not remember that my old laptop went poof right in the middle of a Sudoku game.&nbsp; After 5 years of faithful service, it finally could do no more Sudoku.&nbsp; (a moment of silence, please).&nbsp; OK, that's enough.&nbsp; We had another laptop in the bottom of the closet, because my husband forgot the password to get windows to start up.&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; So we bought a new copy of Windows and here I am!!!!<br /><br />There is so much to catch up on.&nbsp;<br /><br />Kaitlin's play is next week, so most of our time is spent driving her to and from play practice.&nbsp; She's really doing well.&nbsp; She's had practice until 8 pm every night this week and has still been able to keep her homework up and hasn't gotten whiney from lack of sleep.&nbsp;<br /><br />John is still&nbsp;teaching at a local business college.&nbsp; He has an interview on Tuesday for a cope editor job with the Rockford Register Star.&nbsp; It would mean enough money to pay our bills, but the&nbsp;hours will be from 5 pm - 1 am&nbsp; which would include one weekend day&nbsp;a week.&nbsp; It will be a job he will enjoy, though.&nbsp; He started out as a journalist, became a Metro Editor (hated it), went back to journalism, then&nbsp;went back to school to get his Masters.&nbsp; He says this&nbsp;job is everything he has liked&nbsp;about journalism minus the things he&nbsp;hated.&nbsp; He's very much an introvert and having to interview someone who has just experienced a tragedy, so he can write a story that ""will sell papers""&nbsp; is just NOT his thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />After a very, very long month, I have a&nbsp;new assistant.&nbsp; He' wonderful.&nbsp; We've known each other for 11 years and have worked together on common cases before.&nbsp; He has a great sense of humor, which you all know is critical for me.&nbsp; If you can't laugh and be silly, what's the sense in living!!!&nbsp; We have had&nbsp;over 400 kids become homeless since July 1st.&nbsp; You have to be able to laugh and be silly or you would die from the tragedy of it all.&nbsp; Oh, Oh speaking of that, on Oct 8th on the CW channel at 3 there will be a&nbsp;documentary called ""Amazing&nbsp;Invisible Children"".&nbsp; They filmed some of it here in Rockford with my program!!!!&nbsp; I'm not sure how much of it will be on the show, but 2 clips are in the trailer.&nbsp; If you get a chance to watch it let me know what you think!<br /><br />I have missed you all sooooo much, I feel like I've come home after being away for a very long time!!&nbsp; I didn't realize how important you are in my life.&nbsp; Thank you to all of you for being out there!!!!!&nbsp;</p>"

"event","&nbsp;Just a quick ""Hello, I'm still alive""&nbsp; I've been very negligent in my posts and responses, but I have been keeping up with&nbsp; you&nbsp; all.&nbsp; I'm very sorry.&nbsp; I get my laptop back soon, then I'll be back on board.&nbsp; I've been using my dh's puter which is set up for a lefty.&nbsp; I get a neck ache if I type or look at the screen too long.&nbsp; Hopefully, I'll be back on board next week.

Miss you all!!"

"event","So I went out last night with her and this kid I went to high school with. A bunch of people from work were also out... it was an ok night. I guess I am just not the going out to a bar type. I like dancing and clubbing but no bars. 

I was grinding up on all my guy friends it was great.  I must say I looked very cute. I treated myself to a new outfit. It was warranted since I never buy myself anything. 

So I am off today and tomorrow, I have no clue what I am going to do ... I kinda want to take a small road trip with her and the baby. We will see ... I have no clue where to go though. WOW am I boring today ... sorry to who ever reads this.

Well, I am on my way to her house to watch a movie ... night.

Talk to you soon,

"event","OK so I guess I should start where I left off last... So she is now on her own when it comes to the baby because the father says he needs to figure himself out and learn to take care of himself before he can take can of a baby. Ya well my feeling is that he should have thought of that when he was sleeping with her. But then again who am I to say, right? So of course I hate the fact that the father can't even take care of the child he created and she has to do it all herself. So I am trying to help her the best that I can. I mean I make a decent living and could afford a place for her to live easy but is that really something I want to dive into right now? So I am taking it one day at a time and seeing where the future brings. Am I afraid that I will risk everything again and she will cheat and say she needs time apart again, absolutely. But I guess there are risks you should take when you care for someone so much. And consequences you need to figure out in order to live life. I am definitely not a ""what if"" kind of girl. If I want something I take the risk and go after it. I don't ever want to sit back in five years and wonder ""what if"". What if she was/ is the one for me. What if we could have had a life of happiness and love? So I will eventually take the risk but I have to be certain of a couples things yet. 

Well, this is going to have to be it for now ... I have to go to work. 1-10 Yippee!

"event","Well, this is my first entry and I guess I need to let you all know what and who I am about. I am 23 going to be 24 in September. I work full time at a clothing store as a manager. 

I live a typical american life ... I live at home with mom and dad , who are still married. The only thing that is not typical is that I like girls hehe. 

My life is a roller coaster in a half. The person I am in love with has a child with a guy who is gay hmmmm follow me so far? Her and I were together for a year when she decides to tell me she does not have the same feelings for me as she used to. hmmmm wonder why? Because she is falling back for the father of the baby who in turn decides he is not gay anymore and wants to be with her. WOW following me still? So for a year I busted my ass to save up money to support her and the baby, and treat her like gold, she in turn cheats on me and wants to take time apart. Good for me right? Better that I know now instead of supporting her and the baby, right? Ya well now she is in love with me again and of course I fell for her all over again. And the father of the baby ... ya well he is back to being gay in love with a guy and wants nothing to do with her or the baby. So that is the short version of my roller coaster and if you find that entertaining then please check back I should have some more entertainment for you all!

Talk you,

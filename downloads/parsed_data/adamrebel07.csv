"event","life is full of decisions whether we like it or not. its nothing something we can avoid or ignore..its just something that has to happen. we decide to get outa the bed in the morning, we decide to take showers(hopefully) and we decide what we need to do in the day and if we are actually gonna do it. now if your like me u procrastinate alot of the stuff that you should do for the stuff that youd rather be doing. but even procrastination has to end at some point and u gotta man up and do what has to be done. ive been putting off something for along time that needs to be done..ive kept trying to hold on to someone that i should of let go along time ago cause its apparent to me that she let me go. its not the easiest thing in the world to do, but i have a wonderful girl now that i love very much. and while i have realized that it is possible to love 2 people at once, its not fair to either of them. so with that said i now publicly renounce any and all feelings i had for this female and pray that i can manage to salvage the shards of my heart she left so that i may fix it, and give it to this girl if she proves worthy(im sure she will). so to that era of my life..goodbye and welcome to this new one....

"event","ive been home for about a month, month and a half. so far, ive have no job, my friendships that i still have are becoming strained, and im learning that there really arent that many people left in this town that i have much in common with.i can feel myself changing, because i know that i look at things differently now than i used to. i can feel my standards and beliefs shifting.i havent figured out if its for the best or not.but i guess theres not much i can do about it, just deal with it and try to figure out what to do.i still have my few loyal, so ill will take those on this new journey, and see who is still standing at the end. i wonder who will fall, one by one."

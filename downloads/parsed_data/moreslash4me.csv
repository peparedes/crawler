Just in case some of you wonder: the first verse is in frensh, the second in german. (And the guy singing the song is my younger brother *is so proud*)"

"event","In german we have a phrase for it... translated it would be ""ear worm"". Don't know it that one exists in english or not, even google wasn't so sure. ;-) But I found an old song from Journey - which I like very much - in a new form, sung by Nick Pitera. If anyone hasn't heard from him... just give it a try and listen, you might be surprised. ;) He has a very ""special"" singing voice. Now I can't get this song out of my head.

"event","Supernatural...

I know, I know, it's not exactly a new show. But it's kind of like me to jump onto a ship well after it set sail. Was like this with the Harry Potter books (and really, if my computer monitor hadn't died on me on a freaking weekend I probably wouldn't have read the first one till now...). Jumped onto Merlin when the first season was (almost) over. Ok, since I'm not from Great Britain I'm kind of behind their television shows anyway - and with my job I hardly have the time - but damn this one hit me hard. 
Now though we have to wait for a second season and I bridge the waiting time with fanfics. ;)

This week though I've had more free time on my hands - and the whole house for myself pretty much (my brother's still here but since we have a lot of similar tasts it's not that hard to find something to watch together) and what's best: the bigger TV! And so I was mulling over what we could watch when I remembered that I bought but never watched Supernatural season 2. Well, I even bought the french DVD set because it had the german dub but after hearing Dean in german for like 60 seconds (it took me that long to get over the shock, my jaw back from the floor and my frantic fingers to cooperate with the remote control) we watched it in english anyway. So... every evening for the last week we watched some episodes of SN... The season is over now - and I'm hooked. Boy I should have seen this coming. Never was much of a Sam-fangirl but Dean's whole ""insecure-brotherloving-I'd sacrifice anything for him-selfdoupting-kicked puppy"" moments... I want to grab him and hug him till he runs screaming - which he would probably do in under a minute flat. XD Not the cuddling type, or maybe a secret cuddler, who know. Anyway, me wants season 3 NOW! I'm so screwed (as Dean would say), I really didn't need another fandom. *big sigh*"

But it really was great, he was in good form, made jokes, sang many of the songs I know (and love) from his CD, made jokes, told about his life and got the entire Royal Albert Hall to say ""shite"" on  his command (he coudln't stop giggling about that one). I was even  at the Stage door, but when John finally came out he was rather knackered and quite a bit drunk on Champagne so no autographs. :-/

It's funny really, I'm normally not a friend of those *big* cities but with London it's different. Don't know why.

We're going to see John Barrowman live in the Royal Albert Hall (I can't wait!!!) and I'm trying to get my nerves up to go the stage door for a photo... We'll also go to a cabaret called La Clique, I think this will be quite entertaining and a bit... different. ;) If I'm up to it I'd love to see a musical... preferable ""Wicked"". 

We'll do a bit of sightseeing when we're there of course... Like the Tower or St. Pauls Cathedral. Of course we'll also go shopping. :D
Any other ideas of what's worth seeing/doing in London?

Oh, and by the way: I'm a big tea fan and was devasted last time I was in London that it's (almost) impossible to get a real ""Tea Time"" anymore. I even asked at the reception of our hotel but no one could help me there. :( 
Only a in few restaurants (like the Tea Room&nbsp; in Harrods or the Ritz) will serve a Tea Time - and it will probably cost enough to feed a family Or you'll need a reservation like 3 month before going there. Does anyone know of a good location where one can get a tea tima (with scones and stuff) for a ""normal"" price? I'd be eternally grateful.

I'll be back on Friday the 5th, so from tomorrow on I won't be able to answer any mails of stuff till then."

"event","I went to see the musical ""dance of the vampires"" today with my brother and it was fantastic!!! It was actually the second time I watched this cause some friends of mine gave me a ticket for my birthday last year and I immediatly fell in love with this musical. It's just... perfect! You've got great music (Jim Steinman, that's the guy who wrote some/most of the songs for Meat Loaf and Bonnie Tyler - actually most songs in the musical are variations of the greatest songs of those singers (like ""total eclipse of the heart"" or ""objects in the rear view mirror"")), a fantastic stage design, great singers and a very very sexy vampire count. ;)

I have the CD from the vienna cast but I also found some great clips from the Hamburg cast with Kevin Tarte as vampire count - and his singing but especially his acting were... wow! I like his image of the count far better than the original Vienna one, he really gave his role so much personality. The count is far more sexy than in Vienna, but above all, he's not so one-dimensional. He's after the girl (Sarah), but not only for her blood but even more so for her love and her liveliness, he desires her but is afraid that it will destroy her... but he can't resist. 

The musical is played in Oberhausen now (well, since last November), and that's not so far away from my hometown. When I read on their homepage that Kevin Tarte also plays the count here (as an alternative count on the weekend) I soooooo wanted to see him live! And today I did! *squeeeeees*

Sorry for this long post, I feel like a total fangirl here but I'm soooo happy right now! The musical was great, the singers were in really good form and I'm humming the songs since we left the theater. :D"

But now I'm the proud owner of a dslr camera, namely the Nikon D80. And, after quite a bit of nudging from my best friends, I got myself a flickr account too. 

So, here are the first test pictures. I think they came out quite well. :) I uploaded some pics that were made with my old camera too cause I liked them. Motives are mostly flowers and sunsets for now. Hope you like them.

I'm thinking of creating a PayPal account - for ebay (only did bank transfers up till now) and other transactions. What kept me from doing this before were some bad reviews I read about PayPal... about accounts locked without reason and members not getting their money back.

What do you think? Do you have a PayPal account? Do you use it? How do you use it? (with your Giro account or your credit card?) What would you advise me to do?"

Ranting afterward is plain stupid and I will delete those posts.<br /><br /><div text=""Severus Snape"" class=""ljcut"">Sooooooooo. I'm a spoiler slut. Especially for the HP books. So much in fact that I read the spoilers for book 6 and decided than, not to read it until I know how JKR decides to end book 7. Makes no sense? Look at it from a Snape-fan's point of view. He came off very bad, with killing our ""beloved"" headmaster and all (though I always thought he was a manipulative git and was quite angry at him for shunning Harry in book 5 but anyhow...). I immediately thought if had to be a ruse, a plan from Dumbledore to get Snape back into Voldies good grace but... you never know with JKR. After the first books she said in an interview once that she didn't like the character Snape... but on the other hand he came off in the movies far better than the books (movie 3 anyone? Where in the books did Snape protect the kids from the werewolf? He was unconscious at the time Lupin shifted)<br /><br />Now I have a problem. I read some spoilers for book 7 and JKR has done it again. She did do a 180 degree turn on the Snape character and made him one of the good guys (even with his many flaws) BUT she immediately killed him off afterwards. GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH! What am I to do now? Do I read the books (starting with 6 since it's been sitting on my shelf untouched for more than a year) and get into denial about his death afterward or do I simply ignore the facts that his death is planned by this evil woman and live with my fanfics? *rips out hair*<br /><br />*goes off to read some snarry and setlle her nerves*</div>"

So here's a short notice.<br /><br />1) I'm still alive - <strike>barely</strike> apperently. <br /><br />2) Work's hell - more so than ever. 3 collegues quit in the span of 2 weeks (mostly the fault of our head physician) so we have to compensate. But since we were 8 to begin with... well you can imagine what would happen if more than a third of your collegues quit. Now imagine a hospital that can't just lay low for a few weeks/month. And 24hours shifts... and coding and writing discharge letters... Just for july I'm planned for 5 24 hours-shifts in the span of 2 weeks. Yep, nice isn't it. It's like monday 24-h-s, tuesday ""day after"" where you can/should leave at 9:30 (cause hey, you're up and about for 25,5 hours already - which isn't allowed by the way (by the law)) but first you have to finish your ward round and take all the blood samples for the day. Wednesday it's 24-h-s again and so on... <br /><br />3) It won't get any better anytime soon. We may have a new collegue (ONE) at july 1st, but he won't be able to do 24-h-s for about 3 month. And when/if we get more - no idea.<br /><br />I won't be online as often as I want but I promise I'll drop a note once in a while. Don't abandon me... *snif*<br /><br />4) Didn't get the holidays I wanted and now I'll even shorten my 2 weeks to 1 cause I'm pretty sure I'll need some time-outs in the months to come and that way I have some more days left. Sad but true. It's not as if these days are much of a holiday anyway - it's more like catching up on missed sleep and recharging your batteries.<br /><br />5) A positive note... well... kind of... hm... not sure... ^_^;;<br />Watched the first episode of Prison break... I know Jenny wanted to show me the series when I visited her but since we had so much to talk and other shows to watch <strike>I could resist</strike> we never got around to do it. Now I made the mistake... damn... must resist... argh... @_@<br /><br />Oh, the note did get longer than expected. *sigh* Should be in bed, guess what, tomorrow is 24-h-s again. Now isn't THAT a coincidence."

I really really don't want to think about resorting all my drawers... lots and lots a loose papers and bits and pieces I always think I need to store for I'll need them someday but then never look at again. *takes breath*
Nope, no more for today... I cleaned my bathroom too so that's enough already.

Afterwards I played Gothic 3. Yeah, I admit, I've fallen for this game. I usually am no fried of ""I'm running around and slay everything that isn't on the trees on the count of 3"" games and I was surprised when I tried it out... it's really more like the adventures I like where you get a quest but to fulfill it you have to carry out tasks for other people and run around (and there is certainly a lot of running around in this one!). Of course there are lots of Orks to kill, but at first you have to pretend to be friendly towards them to gain their trust (sneaky, eh?) but in the end you slay everyone and free the city. Yeah for the hero. *heavy irony*
What's good is that this game is that it isn't over in about 20 hours like the last adventure I played. What's bad: the bugs... lots and lots of them. Often you can rescue your game by saving and reloading but I had my bouts of random crashes too (I tend to save rather often now). Well, nothing for it than stay up to date with the last patches and hope for the best.

Tomorrow I have 24 hours shift again. The joy. :(  I can hardly wait. Let's see how it goes... wether I get some hours of sleep - if any. If I have another of those ""patients"" who think he can come into the emergency ward because he has the cough for 3 weeks and just NOW is bothered about it - about 2 a*fucking*m in the morning - I garantee for nothing!"

"event","My new (ok, not so new but vastly improved) computer is getting done bit by bit.

I got:
new <strong>mainboard</strong>
<strong>CPU </strong>(Intel Core2Duo 6300 - <em>yeah I now <lj user=""eviljy"">&nbsp; doe</em><i>sn't like Intel, but it runs and runs and runs... :))
</i>2 GB DDR2 <strong>RAM</strong>
Graphics Card (Geforce 7600 GT)

Came home, installed the mainbord with the help of my brother (at least they are good for something, the little pins for the front LEDs and USB were quite tricky)... and then the shock: where's the second IDE slot??? Nope, not on the new boards - or so the guy in the shop informed me the next day. 2 SATA but only 1 IDE. Yippie... I got 2 IDE hard disks and 2 IDE DVD devices. O.o

So I only installed 1 hard disks and my trusty DVD burner. Not perfect to say at least, but it worked. That was at the beginning of November I think.

When I bought my fathers christmas present last week in the same shop I discussed with the clerk how to solve my problem. I had read on the internet about solutions of course (I NEVER go into a discussion unprepared - I just don't trust these guys not to try to get the better of me). In the end I bought an IDE Controler Card. The guy didn't know if it would work or if I had to reinstall Windows anyway... oh the joy of computers...

Well, that was last week. I just got my nerves up and installed the IDE controler card, put all my hard disks on it and both DVD devices on the IDE slot of the mainboard and pushed the ""ON"" button... AND HERE I AM. It worked like magic. All hard disks are there, no problem during the booting whatsoever. *is happy*

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAND I got a new Logitech keyboard/mouse for Christmas (the MX3000 again, my old (or not so old) one was broken after just 2 weeks). I bought it on Amazon cause Logitech had some delivery trouble with my computer shop and with Amazon I knew it would be here on time. When the packet arived I went to my Mom, asked her ""You wanted to know what I want for Christmas?"" and when she nodded I gave her the parcel and told her that I wanted to at least have to unwrap it under the Christmas tree. *ggg*

Sooooooooooo... did I mention that I'm happy?"

Btw Jenny, completely your fault: I'm addicted to this series now. But shockingly, no slash pairing. Nope sorry, het for this one. Yes I know, the world is gonna stop spinning any minute now. No matter, can't help it. Big softie here. But the vid, guh.

Edit: Found another one, can't decide which one is funnier... Hm, if I had to vote, I'd say the second one, mainly because of the lyrics.

"event","Got my new glasses last week. Yeah. I like them a lot and they have special glasses that darken in the sun (transitions glasses) so I can use them as sunglasses too.

Got some contacts too (wanted to test if I tolerate them for a long time) and I'm using them right now. I get better at putting them in but I find it harder to get them out. -.- Well, I'll keep on trying. On the negative, my optician told me to wear them no longer than 8 hours... On a regula work day I must put them in around 6:30 and would have to take them out around 14:30 - only I work until 18:00 most of the days - sometimes longer. :-/

My family got back from St. Peterburg yesterday (they were on a concert tour with the choir academy of Kempen)... Boy are they all tired... Apperently at this time of the year it never gets really dark in Russia. They walked the streets until 3:00 one night cause at 1:30 all the bridges on the Newa are pulled up and they wanted to watch the spectacle. They all said they had a good time there but are happy to be back too."

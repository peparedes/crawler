Today tons of stuff went wrong Chance Spilling red raspberry grape juice concentrate ALL over the kitchen walls, cabinets, floors, fridge and stove. After cleaning all that up Very shortly after I had to deal with the after effects of him stealing juice concentrate.... it was on the bed the floor then he stepped in it so there was a trail all the way to the bathroom all over the toilet seat and EVERYWHERE... I gave him a bath and cleaned it all up! Yet even through all of that I was still ok! I think I managed to keep my temper very well and I was proud of myself for the way I handled the situation!
 I think that I am happy because I finally embraced my singleness... I'm not LOOKING for someone to fill Williams void... And every day more and more I'm learning to let go! Tomorrow will be a huge test for me because I'm going to have to see him and spend some time with him to get some things done. Shopping, post office etc... I'm going to try my best to keep up my walls and mot buy into him spill on how much he loves me... He had his Chance MANY Chances and he hurt me many times... I refuse to be completely rejected once I open up to him and tell him that I love him to to watch him back out quicker than Ice melting in a blaze of fire.
 I want to be over him I NEED to be over him It's time to move on with my life! I have been happy with my choice to reprioritize my needs I think it's really going to work out! I decided that I need to stop trying so desperately to make everyone else happy I can't save the world... I can only try to save my kids, my close friends, and myself! We'll see for sure tomorrow"

"event","Ok this is just lazy... but I wanted something positive on here for once so I'm just going to past from my blog!!! haha

I think that I had a smile on my face for about 75% of the day! That's a LOT for me!!! That's a C+ :D Which is a HUGE difference from an approximate average of 3%

WOW I just realized how nerdy that sounds! hahaha *makes fun of self* Damn math freak

Anyway back to my original point. I have a relatively good day today... Woke up with a happy baby who was giggling instead of the usual scream, Had a bit of time to myself when he laid back down. When Chance got up I made him oatmeal with out tons of whining... then I gave myself a facial after a nice shower... Played with chance and spent some time trying to catch the mouse/rat ... no I didn't get him! Then I talked to friends online and just had an overall pretty good day. I Got a little crappy news at the very end of the day but I'm not going to let it bring me down!!! *deep breath* Your better than that! Don't worry just keep your chin up and it will be ok!!! Promise!
... yeah I was talking to myself sue me! heehee
Well this whole thing is me talking to myself really... now I'm debating with myself time to go..... night self!"

"event","I have been running a question through my mind repeatedly... Why? <br /><br />It has been hurting me for quite a while so I need to get it out... <br /><br />Someone that I care about very deeply said some pretty horrible lies about me and I over heard it...(lets call this person Sam) I couldn't believe my ears! I really had trusted Sam and was ready and willing to do anything and everything that I could to help out and make Sam happy. I was always honest, and upfront as I try to be with everyone... I believe that pure honesty is always the only path to follow! So I don't understand why some people Twist the truth so much that it becomes a sickening lie! <br /><br />For example turning someone<strong> trying to share</strong> their deepest secrets, feelings, and thoughts... <strong>into</strong> them being <strong>emotionally Abusive</strong>!!! Someone saying that they feel like their sanity is going to expire once there all alone again into ""I'm going to kill myself if you leave me""... ~_~ NOT even close to the same thing! <br /><br />Or the worst one, that gets to me the most! Turing a <strong>consensual sex</strong>ual relationship between two adults <strong>into</strong> The aggressor of the encounters being groped and <strong>molested</strong> against their will 0.o I just don't understand how someone could make such hideous lies about a person they call a friend!!! <br /><br /><br /><br />I would NEVER harm anyone like that!!! EVER <br /><br />And if Sam really felt that way about the situation... that I was going to far or was making them uncomftorable at any point (even though I was ASKED to do most of what I did) All they had to do was tell me and I would have never done it again! <br /><br />But thanks to Sam I come off across as someone who is Lazy, controlling, anal, and abusive, both sexually and mentally... And only god knows just how many people herd this warped side of the story!!! <br /><br />*tear* I don't understand WHY? What did I do to make Sam think this way of me? I can't figure it out for the life of me! The only answer that I ever got was that Sam was just mad about something and venting... sounds awfully selfish to make yourself out to be such a victim, at the expense of others, to me <br /><br />I don't know WHY sam did it but I do know that I'm not that shallow to just drop people out of my life for their mistakes... I still want to be Sams friend i just don't think that I can trust Sam with the same pure open heart again... only time will tell but Sam will definitely have to earn my trust back right now i can't help but to feel used =/<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","wow I actually got a decent amount of sleep! I think that I only woke up like once or twice in the middle of the night to check my computer to see if Daniel was online :P 
although I'm getting really sick with the whole scratchy voice, cough, lightheadedness... boo. So I still feel tired
well Guess I'm going to try to lay back down for now! Then I gotta clean the whole in tire house from top to bottom because the CPS worker came here again yesterday. I was like ""hold on I'm not dressed"" *clean clean clean* ""I'll be right there"" *clean clean clean* all while actually getting dressed because ..it twas hot and I lika de nakedness! ha 

Hm what else? Oh yeah so yesterday I found out that Pierce has the same Allergy to Cinnamon that Chance does! I'm such a dumb ass I should have checked! I figured that it was rare enough for one kid to have an allergy to it yet alone two kids... but not considering, hello there blood brothers you freaking retard! Well now I know and I can do my best to avoid it with either of them...

Well I'm going to go get my screaming infant now and try to lay down with him... Ciao"

"event","well here we go back to my normal life...
Back to being alone and having no one to talk to.

 The peace and quiet is nice but so damn hollow! Once I have something to say and realize that there is no one around to talk to my little bubble of happiness bursts and the lingering residue stings my eyes and fills them with tears..."

"event","I'm So excited I get to get out and feel like a real person for a little bit! I won two tickets to the Flyleaf concert here in the house of blues san Diego! I'm taking me friend kristine and I couldn't be more excited! She is going to spend the night here and I can't wait! I have not had any one stay ove since My Aunt did when Pierce was just a tiny baby just born! Before that it was when my cousin came to visit before I was ever even pregnant and Chance was a year old...Friends wise I have never had anyone over! YAY! *happy dance*
There is a lot of other crap behind it that I don't really want to get into but it's retarded because she is a really good person with good intentions and I know that. She has EVERY right to come too! Once again *happy dance* I have a friend comming over like I'm a real damn person!"

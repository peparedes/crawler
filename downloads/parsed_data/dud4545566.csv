"event","Wednesday was a half day, then thursday, we went and saw NATIONAL treasure! GREAT MOVIE! and the movie is PG! who knew you could have a GREAT movie, with out a sex scene? obviously NOT the people who made James bond! Then we had a good dinner, watched some pretty BORING movies on the hallmark channel (that explains it) and then on FRIdAY!.... My dad and I went to the 6:00 sale at Fry's electronics, and He got me 3 GBA games for christmas! HTe reason he got me 3, is it was this 3 for the price of 1 deal! and they are VINTAGE NES games! YAY! (I know what those presents are for christmas, but at least that means that I get what I want! ;) and then after we FINALLY got out of Fry's, we went to, the BEST STORE! TARGET! :D where I told my dad what games I want for christmas, and then he got 2 of the games I asked for, and this other one for christine, (who through TRICKERY and DECEPTION, recieved my old gameboy...) but I dont know which 2 he got me! but that means that once again.... he got me something that I wanted! yay! okay, nice talking to you people! :D have a good weekend! Also at FRYS, we got Oceans 11, what do you people think of that movie? has lots of well known actors! Even brad pitt was good in it! (And I dont really like him that much, since he is usually in stupid movies, but this one was GOOD!) Anyone seen oceans 11, and think it was good? or bad? tell me! thanks for listening! bye bye people! :D"

"event","Just to clear up something about yesterday's entry, the person I was saying used to be my friend, but is DEFINETLY NOT now, is NOT KILEY BATEMAN! there you go folks, the truth, plain and simple. Today was EASY! like 3 different subs, and in mrs. Wight's class, Chelsea was sniffing rubber cement, and she was like WOOOO! this is FUNNN! In science, we had this sub who was like looking for a job in the yellow pages, and DID NOT TALK AT ALL! :P any ways, nothing new, will mocked me in Math class, whats new, that is all really! not really any good times."

"event","Soooo I have not been on live journal, but maybe people online will listen to me, since my friends in person dont really talk to me! :D but ya, people that are your friends, but only when you are around certain other people, or are only your friend if you just told a funny joke, and everyone is laughing, but unless the ""Cool"" (cool meaning GAY, self centered, egotistical, in essence, cory the F*** McCAY) kids laugh at the joke, this person doesnt laugh either. Or just friends that are your friend, you think they are your friend, They say they are your friend, but they dont talk to you even half as much as they used to, and it all changed so suddenly, they are ALL PSEUDO FRIENDS! (Pseudo meaning fake) Nice talking to all of you that are still watching to see if I EVER get on live journal again, but I have an excuse, I wasnt on live journal, to keep up my 4.0 but I AM STILL FRIENDS WITH PEOPLE WHO DONT HAVE 4.0s like this NICE GIRL Ki- WHO IS VERY COOL, and I am talking about her, but since I am talking about her nicely, isnt it like broadcasting? which is good? anyways... ;) but lauren, you and I really need to work on our grades! not 1.00 is NOT acceptable! I think those chemicals in science today had some effect on me.... *Twitch* *twitch* Nice talking to all of you who know me, or maybe dont know me, but have heard of me in myth, legend, folklore, song, etc. Nice to talk to you too! My mood is Rejected, since I think being not loved by a ""friend"" counts as being REJECTED! :( talk to you people later... hopefully..."

"event","No homework as the title may suggest, but there arent any really good shows on on thursday, wait! Drew Carey's Green screen is on on WB! 22, cable 10! yay, but anyways, things in my life arent AS crazy right now, but things are still hectic, since EVERY choice I make has a reaction at school, like me not doing one assignment might drop my grade below A or B, and then I wouldnt be able to go on the China trip, and my parents would start monitoring me EVERY SECOND, to see if I am doing my homework, I can deal with the homework, it is not hard, just tedious! And sometimes I remember what school was like in 7th and 8th grade (ahhhhh *sigh* the good old days) Of me not caring what assignment was due, since I wasnt going to turn it in anyways, and some days I just feeling like blowing off homework and taking a nap, or just writing poetry, or some trivial thing that will not benefit my life one iota, but I just to want to ""Slow down, you move too fast, got to make the morning last!"" O well, things are going better in the Love department of my life, my friend who is bi (Not lesbian, I checked with her on it) that I found out recently about (Which isnt some great feet, since JoJo knew since half way through last year) but I digress, I talked to her, and she said I could tell people she was bi, and that she knew I wouldnt like post it on internet chat boards, or scream it at the top of my lungs (I am not going to say her name on my journal for the very reason i promised her) And sheis having some issues having any time with her girlfriend, since the other girl's mom is (supposedly) ok with her daughter with another girl, but My friend says she treats her like she is evil or something. But anyways, My other buddy, she is SERIOUSLY falling head over heels in love with this guy, hope things go good for her. Hope rabitoy doesnt find some way to blame the water bottle thrown at the trash truck my fault, but he has somehow found a way to get me in trouble for things I am NOT EVEN ASSOCIATED WITH! Lastly, I hope this weekend the dance, the mormon dance,(Mormons and non members are GREAT to have come... that means you lauren! ;) I hope the dance is way cool, since the last one wasnt that great, but it was good fun anyways, since we have a new dj now (instead of the one who played the BAD songs) some songs the new guy plays are just not up to snuff with some of the stuff the other Dj played, but I will deal with it! talk to you later people! hope you enjoyed reading this lengthy discourse on my trials and tribulations! Peace out people!"

"event","My dumb classes: these are classes that are boring, and I dont have like ANY friends in, and KILEY is not in them! :( Period 1:Mrs. King-She may be nice and all, but she is a bit ditzy, and didnt even know how to use the projector that was attached to her laptop, to show us a powerpoint! she is a great teacher, but since she is new, she makes lots of mistakes. Next is MR. Ramirez (I have NO IDEA how to spell his name) He is WAY BORING, I only heard him laugh when he talked to The librarian (I cant remember her name!) and then, he laughed like HA ha! and then his smile disappeared so fast, you wonder if it was there in the first place, and it takes him like 10-30 minutes to DO THE WARMUP! and when we get done with that, even though the homework is on the board, he tells us to read a page on Exponents, and you might think that since you have forgotten exponents over the summer, you should read teh page, but looking at the homework, you think (this is RAMEREZ! why would I think I EVER need to learn new things?) the homework was like write this in exponent form (2x2x2x2)
Dont people know how to do exponents? we are in integrated one from GOSH SAKES! The last of my stupid classes is Fitness (I usually like it, but with like 90% of the class being guys, and I have like 2 whole friends in the entire class, and none of the girls look good, or even TALK TO ME it is dumb) Bye bye, gotta help with dinner! talk to you people later! comment on this please!"

"event","I went and saw the Bourne Supremacy (I cant spell, so sue me!) it was good! not tons of fighting, but when there was fighting, it was long, and the car chase was sweet, and it had killing, and sometimes I just wanna watch an action movie, and someone asked if I had seen kill bill, and I thought, I like movies with a PLOT! :D she told me kill bill was dumb, but it is R and I dont watch R rated movies anyway! so I guess by not watching kill bill, I saved money and saved my moral integrity at the same time! WOW! talk about multi tasking! and I am not going to bumbershoot! :( which SUX MY LEFT NUT. and loneliness, it is sad and good at the same time! I am happy that I dont have to talk to someone all the time, but I feel lonely, and happy when I am with someone, but then when you and the person are apart, then you feel bad again! I am CONFUSED! and I will finish this soon, since SOMEONE, wants me to write an update, and one other thing, if a girl/guy meets someone (hopefully)  of the opposite sex, and thinks they are GREAT does that give them the right to blab on about this person? like they are gods gift to the (hopefully) opposite gender? even if this person is enthused with meeting this person, shouldnt they not like RUB IT IN, that they met someone and you have no one? that is just my theory... :D thanx for listening to this dissertation on how my life is today! :D thanx!"

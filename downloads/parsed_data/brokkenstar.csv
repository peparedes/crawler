"event","Ok, I've been really busy lately and have had to put up with too much unecessary drama.  Not my fault, but my problem to deal with.  From quitting a job to almost clashing heads with my neighbor to having cops knock on my door, my week has just been full of fun and surprises.  I've also had a virus in my computer which is the reason for why it has taken me to take so long to make an entry.  Everything else in life is just the same as any other day.  Nothing too exciting lately with big parties or anything.  Well, don't expect another entry for at least a week because I have my midterms this week and I can't be screwing around with anything else.
Later,

"event","Today I woke up from wonderful sleep since I spent my first night last night in a real bed since I moved down here.  Unfortunately, I woke up sick as hell.  I made it to my first class and barely got through.  It is also pouring rain and I with no money means no umbrella to buy.  Sooooo, I'm soaking wet this morning sitting in class sick with the chills and feeling like crap.  I even have that feeling where you are soooo hungry but you just don't feel like eating anything.  So in any case, I don't have any homework to hand in for the rest of my classes today, and none of them are taking attendance today...I think I'm going to stay home and get ""un-sick"" and possibly work from 4-7 tonight.  But that might not happen either.  We'll have to see how I feel.
     OMG, I went to a huge frat Toga party!  It was awesome.  But it sucked that they had only Budweiser Kegs.  Budweiser makes me throw up.  No matter how much I drink, eventually, its coming out, and not from where it is suppose to.  But I was almost raped by a girl about 5 times, and one of my friend's girlfriend was hitting on me pretty hard.  I stayed away to avoid a screwed up situation.  It must have been that Zanex that everyone was taking.  Those girls cut a little to loose.  Kind of put me out of my comfort zone a little bit seeing that the beer wasn't letting me feel to good.  
Gotta go, need rest!

I would have failed if I didn't go, so I'm glad I went.  I also got a B on my Spanish, so that was good too.  Other than that its been work and sleep.  I'm trying to cut back on the eating.  I'm just under the 200 pound mark and may face is starting to get fat.  So a little less on the munchies would be good.  Also a month without exercise could also be my problem.  I've just been real busy.  I'll find time for basketball soon.  I get paid this friday!!!...and it all goes to the maxed out credit card!!!....Joy.....I'm broke.....But who cares!

If you haven't heard of Trash Can punch its a wonderful drink made of Everclear mixed with tropical punch kool-aid, sugar, and orange juice.  You can't taste the alcohol at all.  It is good.  So anyways there was a party last night that I went to and I've been in recovery all day today.  I had a bit too much fun, but was also the only person there of the 150 people that didn't hurl.  All those vulnerable freshman that just don't know that they need to be big kinds and know what there own limit is.  I had a slammin little asian girl on me for a while after she finished two keg stands.  It was all good and fun until she brings up age and I find out she is 17.  I was carrying her at the time, and me being goofy drunk, the guys could overhear the conversation I was having with the girl so right after she said 17 I dropped her on the floor like a sandbag.  Haha, that's what she gets.  Well, I'm going.  I need to catch up on sleep so I'm going to go to bed right now.

"event","To bad my boss put me on all weekend to work.  OK, let me explain quick.  My job is being a cook for a food service called Aramark at the Texas Women's College.  I work upstairs for one boss in what is called The Garden Room during the weekdays, and then ONE day of the weekend, I work for another boss downstairs in the schools actual cafeteria.  My downstairs boss (Sohail) put me one the schedule for the whole weekend after we already had the conversation that the situation is not possible for me with getting school work done as well.  He agreed that I only work one weekend day each weekend.  That is not happening, and its kicking the crap out of me.  Well there is also Tess, my upstairs boss.  She is giving me some shit too.  I started into my Physics lab and also my spanish lab which I found out I have to hit the foreign language study room for a half an hour during the week on my own time, while also attending the class' required lab.  I told Tess the situation would come after a couple weeks that my availability would shift a little bit due to the labs.  Well now after saying she was willing to work with my school schedule easily that is no longer the case.  Now the case, is that I have a set schedule and I can't get rid of three of those hours each week on one of my nights to do my lab work.  The problem mainly comes from the fact that when ever I don't have class I am at work.  And I am at work until after all my labs close.  Doesn't that suck!?  Well each of my bosses are trying to walk on my because I've shown that I am a very productive worker and now they are pushing me for all I am worth.  I would flat out quit on them right now and get another job.  But I have to have this money for a while to pay my bills and catch up on my credit card.  After talking with Tess she gave me minus half an hour on one day from what I usually work.  I felt so dumb hearing and seeing someone DO something so dumb.  Well all I know is, this ""walking all over Dan"" crap ain't happening.  I know to stop it when it starts so I don't have to deal with another finishline senario starring me and Gary Nageldinger (the boss).  
     Besides that crap all else is good.  Class is ok, but I'm staying up to late doing it with work and all.  I had company last night again which was awesome fun.  Haha, and I found out I got a neighbor besides Troy now.  ""THUMP THUMP THUMP!!!""
     Speaking of Troy.  He kind of shat on me at work today.  My car was parked in ten minute parking and as I parked a guy in a campus security car said that I'm in ten minute parking and that if I'm there more than ten minutes that I'm going to get a ticket.  I asked why he was just pulling up to tell me that and he said my work uniform told him I was going to be there for a while.  So anyways I ran into work to clock in quick so I wasn't late and then looked for Troy to tell him I needed 5 minutes to go park my car again.  I couldn't find him right away and I knew he wouldn't mind with the situation, so I just went out quick and moved it to the street next to campus.  I come back and he was giving me the angry face silent treatment.  He got pretty bitchy to people and I was just thinking, ""How could something so simple piss him off so bad?""  Well after an hour he pulled me aside and had me sign a write-up of for leaving without permission.  He said I was trying to ""play"" him and that I was taking him for an idiot.  I didn't even bother trying to explain myself because all that was coming out of his mouth was dumbness.  I could tell by his attitude and his tone that he was extremely pissed about something even before I went to go move my car.  He also tried to blame my 5 minutes of absence as the cause for us opening up 20 minutes late this morning.  Haha buddy, I work in the damn dish room, I don't cook the downstairs food, so it wasn't my fault.  But somehow in his mind it was.  I didn't care about the write-up I signed it before even reading it.  He was really trying to intimidate me and was saying ""I'm not your neighbor at work"" and everything else he was assuming that I was think.  Shit, I was thinking anyone would understand my situation.  By the end of the day things were ok again, but him taking out other anger on me and trying to put words in my mouth and stuff about what I thinking is not something I'm going to forget.  Everyone has a flaw.  I definitely just found his.  It's called the ""I'm always right"" syndrome.  All that does is make you out to be an asshole.

"event","It's been a couple days since my last entry, but it's not like I've been waisting my time.  I'm starting to meet a lot of people.  All of them I like.  I found that there is definitely a huge difference in genre between New York and Texas.  What I mean is that the ""Southern hospitality"" really out-does that of New York.  Nobody is stingy down here (at least not that I have met) unlike the typical New Yorker.  That's just from my opinion though, I mean who knows, New York is way more expensive than Texas so maybe that has something to do with it.
     So anyways, I usually don't do this sort of thing on school nights, but I partied just about every day the past 5 days.  I missed one somewhere in there, but I had a lot of homework, it wasn't like there was no party.  Last night everyone came back to my place and that got to be a little bit too fun.  I'm tellin ya, Buddy is a chick magnet.  He loves girls and plays the ""I'm so cute and innocent"" role when girls are around.  So Buddy decided to join the company last night and just chilled nearby everyone.  I didn't think that my house was going to turn into a club however.  It was awesome, with my system and all the different crazy lights I have, my dining room area turned into a dance floor (well...Carpet) and everyone was having a great time.  I should have taken pictures, but I'll remember a week from tomorrow.  THE BIG PARTY is coming at one of the guys houses.  Actually 3 guys I know are all roommates in an actual house, and they throw parties that pull 100+ people.  Won't that be fun.  Their place is awesome too.  I never saw a hooka in real life before.  I hope that doesn't mean I'm deprived because I don't even know if I spelled it right.  One of my friends is Turkish and his dad lives in Turkey.  His dad got him the hooka as a gift and he smokes turkish tobacco out of it.  Since it was a gift from his dad, he follows the rules of ""For tobacco use only"" though everyone who was there was drueling at the thought of using it for you know what.  
     Of the friends I met, I found that they definitely party at a different level than I did at home.  Some people are trying to convince me to go to my first rave.  Would it be nerdy to say I'm scared?  I've seen pictures and I know what goes on at those events, but I never actually went and hung at one before.  Well enough of the party stuff for now.  I don't want to over expose you to my wild side of fun too much.  But at least I'm not jumping over cars or nothing.
     School is still ok.  It's of course HARD, but you can't have fun without paying for it somehow.  I'm still waiting on my first real paycheck.  I can pay my utilities and save some for the credit card bill once I get some money.  And yes of course spend some on fun as well.
     Time to go for now.  Party tonight, and I don't have to pay a dime!

"event","I had my first ""get together"" we'll say at my place.  It was fun, but the whole apartment smells like ciggi-smoke since people were coming in and out and the smoke spot happened to be right outside my apartment door.  It was kind of a double party thing going on because right across from me as I said before is Troy's apartment and we just kind of used both our places.  I found 24 bottle cartons of Miller Genuine Draft beer for $13.  Even better, they were 16oz bottles not 12oz'ers.  So we had a blast.  It was fun and the smell is almost gone.
     Good news...my grandma down here is giving me her old bed.  Frame and mattresses.  She's getting a new one this coming weekend and offered me her old one since I'm sleeping on an air mattress still.  Well I kind of alternate between that and the futon mattress.  But an actual bed would be awesome.  So that's the good news.  I got the day off from classes today for Labor Day and my homework is almost finished for Tuesday and Wednesday.  So I'm on track to get through this week comfortably.  The only thing I have to worry about in the upcoming weeks now is paying of my text books and the rest of my increasing credit card bill.  I just need a paycheck already."

I already was a week into the semester as of yesterday, so I had to take it and I HAD to pass it.  Otherwise my fulltime schedule would no longer be full time.

I've got a few friends from where I work and neighbors too so, we're gonna have a fun time at my place.  Nobody lives in the apartment below me right now, and my neighbor Troy from next door will be at the party, so the PA can play with no complaints.  And we're gonna hop the fence to get into the pool tonight since the athorities don't ever seem to care in previous times I've done it already.  I've got my whole house clean already too.  I'm sure a few of you already know that my mom would let me throw parties in Victor because she knew she'd come home to a clean house.  Since I began doing that, making the house clean for parties before and after have become a habit.  Plus, I haven't done my dishes in like a week so it got me to take care of those before the roaches started to attack.  Nothing more to say here.  My company is about to come, so I'm out.

But when you work at a Women's College, it's all that is on their mind.  Just as guys talk about the size od girls breasts, girls talk about the size of men's ""junk"".  I just want to clarify that with the guys because it made my day to hear some chit chat about that kind of stuff today from girls.  Not to mention, girls are coming back looking for me.  Of course, sometimes they are super hot and are really trying to talk to me when I just can't because I'm so busy cooking for the next 10 people in line.  So it sucks, but its awesome.  Because none of them feel like they are being blown off.  They just say they'll catch me tomorrow.  I don't know if I bumped my head or what, but my head is definitely starting to swell a little.  Can't help it though.  Feels good to be fresh meat (HAHA).  Anywho, nothing else important.  Today was pretty much a waste of a a day.

"event","Well I had a Math quiz already today.  I couldn't do the homework and the notes the teacher gave sucked and didn't explain anything, so I went into the test knowing nothing of this insane algebra we were doing.  I'm telling you this was no ordinary algebra and besides that, I haven't taken Math since freshman year college.  But you know what, right before I just handed in the quiz blank since we get our lowest quiz grade dropped and I was going to use that privalege right away, I knew what to do.  I just sat there staring at the quiz going, ""your kinding me, your kidding me.""  No I think I passed my math quiz, and with a good grade too.  But you never know.  It could be the other way around.  Maybe I'll just get my test back with a note on it from the teacher next to the red zero saying, ""You need to start giving an effort in this class to pass"", when that is not at all the case.
     Work was ok.  I made it through my three hours of work and closing without screwing up.  I didn't mess anyone's food up and I kept pretty quick also.  I met three different girls today.  One freshman, one junior, and one senior.  They all got talking to me to the extent where I knew they had some interest in who I was.  All of them said they would see me tomorrow too.  So, I might have a date soon, because each of them had the solid curve and the pretty face with the silky hair.  ALl had a nice personality too.  Sorry I'm getting dreamy here thinking about it.  So nevermind.
     Spanish was better today.  The stoner kid I told you about yersterday was the ""ass"" today.  And when I got called on to answer a question, I don't really know for sure what I said, but I got it right with a small pronounciation correction.  
     I had my film class again today.  We watched a movie called Ed Wood, directed by Tim Burton.  Now to add to that list of why I think my professor is gay:
7) He chose a movie with a lead character who is a transvestite for us to view and then critique about race, gender, and sexuality.  On Wednesdays for the last 45 minutes of each three hour class we break into 4 small groups from the 150 students in the class.  One group stays with the Professor Harry Burshoff, and the other three groups join with TA's.  Guess who I'm with :/
     I'm still having a shit of a time still with my math class.  I'm being forced to pass a placement test in order to stay in the class or else they are going to put me in ""cheezeball"" math.  The lady at the math office was a real bitch to me today.  Funny however, I didn't let her know it like I would do normally.  Again, I was caught it a good mood and all I gave was a dramatic pause of ""awe"" before I got back to getting an answer of why my MCC Math class won't transfer when its harder than the beginner math class.  
     Enough for now, I got to go do my homework.  No time for spell check so I hope my typing was alright.

"event","I will be quick about this.  I HATE Spanish.  I didn't want to have to take this crap in the first place.  I wanted to take sign language, but there are only three classes for sign language in a 40,000+ student university.  So I couldn't get in.  But there's plenty of Spanish so you can learn the lingo of the Mexicans.
     My Spanish teacher is retarded.  The first day of class she said that every following class for the rest of the semester we will only speak Spanish in class.  Well fuuuuuck that.  Today was a perfect example of how dumb that idea is.  She starts rambling off in Spanish as soon as class starts.  Great.  Ok.  Well then after two minutes of that everyone starts talking to eachother.  I figured she said get to know your neighbor or something while she gets her books out and stuff.  Well...no, it was make Dan look like an ass idea.  Aparently everyone was practicing something out of a page of the text book she said to do.  The only word I understood out of her mouth was ""Hola"".  Well I look to my left at the only other kid that wasn't saying anything.  I figured I was going to at least try to look like I was doing what everyone else was doing.  I tried saying, ""Hey I'm Dan, what's your name"".  That didn't work.  ""You any good at Spanish?"", I asked.  He turns to me like a demonic person, only turning his head and not his shoulders.  The just looks at me, pauses for a second, then says, ""huh?""  I don't think he was stoned though because he didn't have warmer clothes on and his eyes weren't real red.  I think he was just an idiot.  So I wasn't going anywhere with that kid.  I turned to my teacher and said, ""Excuse me"".  
She comes over to me and says, ""Que(What)""?  
""Yeah um, I'm sorry but I didn't understand anything you just said up there, could you explain to me what I'm suppose to be doing.""
""No comprende.""
""Yeah...""
""No comprende.""
     At this point attention is on my from the whole class because they are done with what they had to do.  Now I'm on the spot to either say something really appropriately funny to kill the moment and turn her away, or just make an idiot of myself.
""ummmm...No Understande?""  ...Good-job-Dan
""No, no comprende!""
""What does no comprende mean?
Now she says with a smile rather than the evil teacher look, ""No comprende.""
     Never answering my question of what I was suppose to do, she walks back to the front of the class...and continues rambling Spanish.  Apparently that's where my participation points came from today, because she never called on me for anything the whole rest of the class.  I don't know if that's a good or bad thing.  This is suppose to be the lowest level of Spanish taught and I gotta take four semesters of it.  Now how the hell am I suppose to do that when I can't even understand enough to even follow directions?  Oh yea, and Math sucks too because I haven't taken serious math in so long that I forgot all the formulas and order of operations and stuff.  
     Ok, Jackie for you, you want to hear about the gay film teacher.  Well I have to say that I don't know for a FACT that he is, but let me give you some hints as to why I've made this assumption.
1) (As the stereotype) he has the lisp.  But not all the time, only when he talks excitedly.
2)  He is co-writer of a book called ""Sexuality in Horror Movies...Monsters in the Closet"".
He mentioned Queer Eye for the Straight Guy at three different times in a two hour period.
3)  Tight clothing.
4) He hoped around like a little girl while explaining stereotypes of male dominance in a movie as the usual hero as he played the role of the heros ""Woman"" after he saves her.  (His example was Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and how everyone including the blonde jumped around like little girls at the end of the movie.  I must say though it was quite humorous to see a guy do something so ""Flame""boyant.  Haha, sorry that joke was probably gayer than he was.
5)HE DOES THE HAND THING!!!  Either that or he broke his wrists more than a dozen times.

So after seeing these few things from him, I find my assumption to be correct.  But you can beg to differ.  It's ok.
     Also, work doesn't really suck that bad.  I delt with it and now today I was making subs, making pizzas, and working the Mexican food spot.  Lets just say I did great and now the supervisor of the mexican spot is letting me be in charge there as the cook tomorrow for the last three hours its open.  I take that as a compliment because I've only worked with him a second day today and I'm already being given that opportunity.  Oh yea, and my pizzas kicked ass.  The subs though I'll leave to Hussion, because I don't meet the criteria for the term ""Sandwich Artist"" the same way he did.  Way to go Zach.  Berney should have let you give out those slushy things for free.  They were too expensive.  So anyways, I've already promoted myself and now I work with a girl who speaks Spanish as a first language.  She already offered to help me practice if I ever need it when I never even told her about my class experience I had today.  She's cool.  And three guys I work with are roommates at a frathouse and I got the ""in"" to some upcoming parties already.  
     Ok leter, I got to go read my film book.  That reminds me, I forgot to metion that my Film professor also teaches out of the book he co-wrote.  At least once on every page the term ""homosexual male"" is written.  That would make 6 reasons.

"event","My God...yesterday was the first day back at work.  I got the best job.  I got to wash dishes for nine hours.  And it sucked!  But you know, I somehow got through it.  But let me tell you, about an old man named Willie.
...a 55 year old black man with a scruffy white beard and has no teeth, all dentures and everytime you look up, there he is giving you the look of death!  The guy seriously scares the hell out of me.  He hates everyone.  I I'm finding that nobody seems to be too fond of him either.  
     I was washing dishes  from the cafeteria on one of those assembly line belts that take your lunch trays.  For all you guys that go to college, you know what I'm talking about.  The place where you put your trays after you've got syrup all over your tray and you spilled your milk on the tray, and you used a ton of napkins and they're all covered in vomit from the powdered eggs you just ate.  Well in front of where I stand there is a shelf right at my eye level where we put the dirty trays we have to wash.  Well Willie decides that ""I am not working fast enough"", when shit all I heard was ""mmff errr ebla elbla neee rah!""  Or something like that.  His dentures are in the way of his English apparently.  Well anyways Willie was grabbing the trays and just tossing them up on the shelf in front of my face.  Well I can't forget to mention that those trays were not staying on the shelf.  In fact that were crashing off the front of the shelf and slamming ON MY FACE!  I remained pretty chill however which is very unusal, and I managed to tell him to stop rather nicely.  I don't remember how, but I didn't swear.  So it must have been an ok way.
     Listen I got homework from class today that I gotta do so I'm gonna go now.  Its a shame I don't have time to tell you about my apparently gay film teacher, but if you really want to know how that class was today.  Just ask and I'll find time to tell.  Later"

"event","Well, today was my last day to just relax and do nothing before I start headstrong into the normal life routine again tomorrow.  Thats right, back to work.  And then class starts Monday.  Work is going to be fun just for the fact that I'm going to have money again.  I'm also excited for class to start now that I'm finally going to take film classes.  Sucks that my books cost me $550 for only four classes.
     I slept until about 2pm today, and all I did productive for the day was some laundry.  I was thinking about watching Donny Darko and rip apart all the bad work in the movie, but then decided I didn't have the energy to.  I start writing things down and getting frustrated at seeing such stupidity.  I gotta tell you, the storyline for the movie was great through the whole movie.  I was so excited to see such a great twist of an ending.  It's one of those pyschological thrillers so they always have a great ending.  Well, I found that to be wrong once the end of this movie came.  It was a writers way of taking the easy way out when writing a script.  I mean come on, if you've seen the movie you'll know what I mean when I say...what was the reason for him going through what he did in the movie, when it had nothing to do with changing anything.  You'd figure he would go back and fix things since he remembered what just happened to him.  Sure that would then force the movie to change its name to The Butterfly Effect, but it would have still made a better ending than what the movie offered.
     If you haven't seen the movie, don't see it.  Go rent a hitchcock movie instead, even if you've already seen the movie ten times.  Well fudge, its getting late and I need to get to bed.  After not working for over a month, eight hours at work tomorrow is going to seem like forever.  Damn."

"event","Today was kind of a bummer.  Not to say I didn't do anything fun...well, ok so I didn't do much of anything fun.  My boy ""D"" needed to go to Dallas with his girl to go ""get her hair did"".  He invited me along since I have not been IN Dallas yet, but only in the edge of Dallas.  Last night D said to get to his house at 9:30AM to go.  Well it was already after 1 in the morning at that time, so I didn't have much time to sleep till then, after Buddy decided he wanted to play until 2 in the morning.  Well, I struggled to get out of bed this morning and managed after actually flinging myself off the bed mattress to the floor to wake myself up. Got ready and everything and was at D's place by 9:30AM.  Well, D was still snoring and my early sunshine wasn't worth it.  He ended up knocking on my door at about 1 in the afternoon.  We went to Dallas though eventually and I got to see some sights.  I found the American Airlines stadium where the Dallas Mavericks play.  I also was shown all the hot clubs and bars to go to as well.  Then I met D's family and hung out while D's girl got her hair done.  ""I'll be done by 5"", she said.  Well, turns out when we get there to pick her up she says, ""6:15"".  We go eat some chicken at some place D knows and then got back to the Salon at 6:15.  Well we never got out of there until nearly 6:45, and I had a damn tall fake tree that kept falling on me in the Salon where I was sitting.  It was in the corner and everytime the air shaft came on by it, it would blow in over on me.  Eventually I moved, but it was just another thing to irritate me.  Oh, I forgot to mention, I ended up having to drive.  But all in all I didn't care too much.  I finally got to see Dallas, and D and his girl bought me a 12 pack of bottled Miller High Life for driving.   So I got pretty shit-face tonight.  It was fun though.  We sat and watched Fear Factor on TV.  Let me tell you since I forgot to mention...The part of Dallas I went to today to meet D's family, I was the only white kid there.  But I gotta tell you, his cousins and ""brotha's"" were real cool.  
     Now that I read through what I typed to make sure I corrected my drunk spelling, I'm going to say goodnight....because I'm about to hit that pillow hard.
     Come on, I had to party hard one last night for my last day off until I start school and work."

"event","Ok, so I chose to start one of these cheesy journals just so anyone who has any interest from home can keep up with what's going on in my life since I moved.  Nothing interesting has happened in the first month unless you want to hear about the fun of finding a job and taking a month to do it, registering for college which is just soooooo exciting, or you want to find out what its like to move into your own place.  That's interesting...especially if you want to hear about my first encounter with a cockroach.  Hohoho-boy, that's something I won't be forgetting anytime soon.  So if you want to hear about any of those ""exciting"" adventures, just ask and I'll tell.  Until then, I'll be working on the journal page to get it to look the way I want.
     The first thing I'll tell you about is what happened yesterday.  I'll tell you now, that BUDDY (my pet ferret) is perfectly fine, but he gave me a little scare yesterday.  My apartment is not exactly ferret proof in the kitchen so I have the entrance way blocked off with some big boxes so Buddy can't get in.  I also have heavy objects holding the boxes so he can't crawl between them or seperate them from the walls to squeeze through.  My concern is that he'll get under the stove and get inside of it or something, or decide to go behind the fridge and not come out.  But some danger that was completely unpredictable came into effect.  There is a tall cabinet in my kitchen where I keep all my dry foods.  Its the height of a door but only a foot and a half wide, and it has a space at the bottom just like a door on hinges would.  Well, Buddy was trying to get into the kitchen past the boxes and I have watched him a few times before and found his efforts to be unsuccessful.  So, when I heard him scratching at them I didn't think anything of it and just let him be.  Well after about 20 minutes I realized that it was quiet and Buddy wasn't getting into anything.  It got me right out of my seat (not a good feeling).  The first place I went to check was the kitchen and there he was.  But he was sprawled out on his belly with his feet behind him...he wasn't moving.  My heart stopped.  The boxes were in the way so I literally hurdled over the counter onto the floor to find that Buddy's head was stuck in the space under the door.  When I touched him he started moving again.  He wasn't dead like I first thought when I saw him.  But he couldn't breathe.  His nose was no longer pink, but white and saliva was all over his face and on the floor where his head was.  I couldn't pull him out so I stabbed my foot under the door to pry it upward and pulled up on the door as hard as I could.  I was then able to get his head out but then he just flopped backwards and layed still.  He was having trouble breathing and had a big mark on the back of his neck where his head was caught.  I splashed some water onto his nose and mouth to get it wet and then just started rubbing him up and down his back trying to comfort him and give him some sort of help breathing.  I wrapped him in a blanket and sat with him on my lap for about 3 hours.  It was horrible because I don't know of any vets for him here yet and I din't know if he hurt himself internally or not.  Even worse, he was gasping and making unusal noises a lot.  After the 3 hours he started to move around a little and chose he wanted to go sleep in his cage.  I checked on him at least every five minutes and didn't sleep half the night because I was worried, but when I woke up this morning he was back to being Buddy and everything seems fine.  Turns out, when the cabinet door in the kitchen is closed, there is more space between the floor and bottom of the door than when its open.  Just by a tad bit.  When Buddy got his head in there, I assume when he tried to pull it out the door kept opening on him until it got so small it started to choke him also coause him to not be able to get his head back out.  He could have been trapped there as long as ten minutes, but at least he's ok.  Just like having a kid, you can never be to careful with your pets."

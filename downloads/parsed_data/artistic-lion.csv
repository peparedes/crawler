"event","I went and visited Lavender and got to meet Nate. He was such a nice little thing, that really likes my hair....it was kind of bad thouhg. Nate kept getting tangled in it. I'll ask my mom about you coming over Lavender. Hopefully she will be up for it, considering that you actually <i>WANT</i> to see the demons living at my house.

Neville showed up over at Hogsmeade! It was nice to finally chat with him, seemed as though it had been a while. Missed talking to everyone now that summer has arrived.

What has everyone else been up to though?"

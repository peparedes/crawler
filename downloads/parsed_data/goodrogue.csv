"event","I find its more and more easy to be who I ""really am"" when I am happy and to be completely strange and off of myself when I sad. I suppose the only self I will accept as me is the one that makes everyone around me happy. 
It may seem a poor idea to not accept every part of yourself in a loving manner but at the same time I may only want that one aspect of me to be visible to the rest of the world. 

Im going to point at you now, smile, wink, and say something clever. That is the person I want to be at all times. 

...its a shame it so often requires external involvement to get me in such a state."

"event","The psychological diseases of today are truly a window into what we fear. It seems though that the things we fear are a farce unto themselves. The profession and science that was once psychology is now only a mockery science.
If it was once a soft-science, it is now jello.
The terms that we use today to describe conditions that bothered no one of the past lurk at every corner today. Attention Deficit Disorder is simply ridiculous. The inability to concentrate on a single thing at any one time... how can we blame it on a weakness of the mind when there is so much more in the world that is so fantastic and unbelievable then there was before.
Sex on every corner, words in the sky, TV, radio, internet, Movies, no one cares if you can fly to the moon but they care so much about who is marrying who. We are now expected to focus on one single thing at a time with a hundred billion more things to look at and to hear. And if we cant... diseased.
Bipolar disorder, the disease where we get sad or happy for no reason. Because if we cant see the reason, if the event that makes us sad didnt just happen to us a moment ago, then it shouldnt be making us sad. 

What is insanity? 
For a long time I thought it was the inability to discern between reality and fiction. There is no straightforwardness in politics, little left in religion, maybe not so much even in a human mind. We can change our minds on anything we want. If no one else experienced an event, we can just tell everyone how we wanted it to happen and thats how it sticks. 
I am a crazy person, but until the world changes its defining that word, I will stay that way. Until then I will remain bonded to this label. 

Help me untie myself and look at the world where you can. Dont just look at it, but reach out and fix the things that dont make sense. Because people like me cant do it all alone.
Thank you."

There is being to cold
To hot
To bold
To not with but yourself again.

And that is in the panting
The breathing of the breath that isnt your air anymore

It is the our breath
It is the our sweat
It is the our taste
It is no longer the me and the you
It is the us

Dali on my tongue
Escher in my body
Hopper in the victory circle

Never hoping to finish

"event","I have seen a great many people around me deny that there is a god, or in fact any sort of divinity that is greater than that of the divine nature of mankind. It seems to be, though, to be a bit of a cop out to simply hate the thought of a god and to put down all those who do believe in such things. 
Not only that, though, but they will also tell stories that show of religion as a whole as a bad thing because of a few of the followers who have misrepresented the rest. Takes a few to spoil the whole bunch comes to mind. 

So my thoughts on this is that I dont have a divinity to believe in; to compound myself with others who share the same thoughts and ideals as myself because of that divine presence. 
But wait, there are people who share my morality as a common thread, so why then can I simply not be in relation with them because of that thread? Well there is something there. How do you judge a persons morality except on their actions and their words and what they do in the world?

So if we are judging a whole group of people based on a group, a religion that they belong, than arent we just furthering a misguided tradition of ignorance? Well for a very long time now, people have lumped others into categories of club, cliques, and cathederals; so how now do we put an end to this? 

Well I suppose what we would have to do is to lump people together, not on what they believe, but what they do. Their actions should be the defining principal of definition here, not their acclaimed religious beliefs or the acclaimed beliefs of their peers. 

It must be actions to show morality in this world. Words alone are no longer suitable. I say that we must put an end to categorizing people based on religious claims. We must hold them to what they do, and not just for religion, but for all things. 

Actions speak louder than words, well let them shout fiercly now more than ever. Let what we do with our lives show the world what we mean to do with our god."

"event","So I have started the dating thing. I asked a girl out in class, she rejected me. I asked a different one out in the same class, she said yes. So...I decided to take her out for some thai food cause she is a vegan.
We went out, had a fun time, I gave her a little date trinket, then we went to a party at her co-op. A haloween in the springtime where everyone dressed in costume. It was a fun thing. When the party got a little too steamy, that is to say to many dancers at once, me and her went to my place a couple blocks away and talked a bit. 
Turns out she is a stripper at a local club. Not a prostitute mind you, but a dancer of the exotic variety. We went back to the party a while later and hung there a bit more before I walked her back up to her room. I got a little kiss on the cheek, it was quite nice. 
The next day I went to a rocky horror show at the Bijou. I met up with that girl there, her name's Justine. The show was great, many of my friends were in it. After the show we all went to the cast party driven by Justine's friend Sam. When I got to the party I quickly realized that her friend was actually her boyfriend. So to take my mind and eyes off of watching them make out constantly, I did my own fair share with the various people around. 
Tonight I went to a movie party that my lesbian friend invited me to. We watched terribly wonderful artistic japenese horror films and gruesome anime. Everyone around me got stoned, I played magic cards, and now I smell of cigarettes; but I did get invited to go to a camping trip in a couple of weeks with a possibility of hot springs.
Boy, my life sure is boring, maybe tomorrow ill win the lottery with raina."

"event","Its hard to say whats right and wrong these days, but let me throw down a scenario for you all.
I was, for as far as I know, in love with someone. Still am, I suppose. She has been my friend for a good long time and for a while ive been fine with that. She doenst have any feelings for me that way, but she remains my friend. For the first couple of months I pursued her, upon my realization that wouldnt win her, I halted.
I tried then, to simply be her friend and not have those feelings for her. And yes, for a short month and a half, I seemed to be able to convince myself that I wasnt consumed by her, that I was just a friend to her.
Over the past few weeks, I have re-discovered, though, that I am, in fact, still wanting her. 
I have gone over all of my defining the word love. Here's all that I know about that word: 
-Care more about her well being than I do my own.
-Want her to be happy
-More than just a physical attraction
-Empathetic to her needs
-Wont try and hurt her
-Keep her from other's harming her
-Not on again off again. (a constant never-changing feeling)
For a while I wanted her to be as happy as possible. I thought that if it couldnt be with me, I would just try and be happy if she was with someone else. I saw first hand last night, though, that I am incapable of it. I saw her with someone and I actually vomitted because of it. I do know, as well as I did know, that it meant nothing for her as she was passed out and non caring about her situation. Though it still remains that all I had to do was catch a glimpse of her with somone else, and I could not handle it. 

It came down to this; I could not be merely a friend to her. Not anymore. I had to be with her or I couldnt even be aroud her anymore, it hurt to much. I want her more than Ive wanted anything in my life, but I coulnt have her, so I left. I told her I couldnt be her friend anymore and left. I told her why. I told her I loved her. I told her goodbye.

I told the girl that I loved and was friends with that I couldnt be friends with her anymore because I loved her so much that it hurt being so close to heaven and never being allowed to enter. (Sexual connotations aside)

I hurt her by leaving, I know. But it would hurt me to stay. Am I wrong in leaving?"

With more words from people who arent there

I wonder where I am.

The harvest was always up, and the rains fell softly upon the land. There hardly was a cloud in the sky and never a complaint among the peoples. And all around the village was a dark forest that the boy would never venture.
There were only two things about this great kingdom that were amiss. There were no mirrors so that the boy could never know his own face. That, and there were no villagers so the boy could not know his own kind.
He knew no tongue, for he had no reason to speak. He knew emotions as someone who had lived an entire life alone would know. 
One day, a beautiful maiden wandered into the kingdom from out of the forest. The boy saw her coming and did not know what to do. He had never encountered as beautiful a creature as she.
She approached the boy slowly, him eyeing her with great anticipation for this new creature. She made the most wonderful sounds that he had ever heard and then was quiet. She stared at him for a long time like a deer trapt in a hunters gaze. He watched her and waited for the pretty sounds to return. A few more briefly escaped her lips. 
The young boy never understood why she never got up after that. He never understood what it was that made those pretty sounds or forced those pretty colors from her lips. He never knew what was in that forest beyond the border of his domain, and he might still never. 
What lies beyond that forest border might be heaven or hell to that boy. The maiden will never again make a pretty sound and now the boy is the king again. If only a word could be said, the world would be saved."

Walking through the dark one starless night, I found that there was no knowing which way to go or which way to step for there was no light in which to guide me. So without that burning ball of empty helium in which to set my motion about, what was I to use? So I stepped forward, not knowing where I was or where I was going. Not knowing if it was ground or the very starless sky that lay under foot. I strode over time and space with a new greater joy with each furtherment of my mind. I see that with eyes left behind me I have found in seeing a greater joy in the new and the dark than in anything else. I have wrapped myself inside of a nothingness complete and found myself in bliss. A light renewed, and I find now that I know more than I ever wanted to. Woe is my new forte.

I asked the little girl if she were lost.
""Lost? I was going somewhere, but I am here now and I forget why. Where am I to go from here?""
An odd question for a stranger, I would think. So I gave her the only reasonable answer I could think of, ""That depends a great deal on where you want to go.""
""I dont much care where.""
""Then it doesnt really much matter where you go.""
""...so long as I get somewhere.""

The number one thing I think is that if you are going to believe in something, whatever it may be, you should show it by your actions. There is something to say about there being a certain amount of doing in saying, talking, and explaining...but I think that the biggest part of really believing and understanding something comes from being able to show it to the world.
Be it love, hate, war, death....whatever the concept, do what you believe. Act on your feelings and be the person that you should be. 

I will think of you based on your actions, I hope you will do the same. I am not saying to act impulsively or without thought. I have said previously that there IS a certain amount of doing in saying and such.

There are terrible and wonderful things in the world to be seen, heard, felt; whatever. It is up to every single person on this planet to enjoy what you can of their work, and create as much as you can of your own."

I dont know if its to anyone that I give these thanks, but if anyone is out there to claim them, then there you go."

"event","I didnt go outside today. Yesterday was my birthday. Im 20 now and I can no longer fantasize about living forever. I had breakfast with a cousin whos name I still dont know. My ipod is dying fast. I keep getting new things, but the same amount of room in which to put them. Im never hungry but I keep eating. 
Im dirty now from my own paste and sweat.
I have to find a way to cleanse myself, and soon. If I dont I fear insanity or sanity might be my only future. I cant decide which side Im on now anyway."

"event","It seems that some passion has escaped my life. I know why, and for some reason, Im okay with that. Im getting some things done that I knew I had to own up to eventually. Im not worrying as much anymore. Im not sleeping very well, though. And its a shame because I could really use some good dreams now, I havent had any in a long while. 
Im not depressed. I guess I am just feeling the absense of what I had before. I dont know if bipolar can be used as an adjective, but I had a lot of ups and downs. And now in my state of perpetual non-feeling, it leaves me with a sense of longing for that real feeling. 
Anyway. I have been meeting new people lately, which is a definate plus. I am trying some new things and re-aquainting myself with some people I have been neglecting otherwise. Rachel and heath, you guys still need to come dancing over here sometime. My bday is coming up soon. The 22nd. Its a monday, but I am going to try and be with my friends for most of the weekend. I will be 20 and I dont think that really means anything.
I guess if I find something to make me happy again, I will try and keep it that way. Hopefully all is well with you."

"event","A blood moon washes the forest in nothing
And the smoke of the world comes over the little dying creatures
The fire eats itself to starvation
Night grows darker and the moon grins a tear

Lightning of the wrong color shoots across the sky
but makes no sound
The moon is hiding now

On top of a mountain
There is but one boy
Who stands naked upon the top of the dying world
Cursing god and himself
He knows not the difference at this point

The reach of the mountains stretch far in all directions
Where there once was the sight of a valley below
Now there is smoke and fog of no color and no light
The birds within know not up or down
As they have lost their wings and their feet

The building on top of the restaraunt
Serves the drunk and the gluttons
Who fear nothing and know even less of the world outside the glass

Occasionally, one will venture outside
Smell the air of a dead world
And piss on the grave
Then return to their meal of maggots and luxury

The sun lies in pieces on the floor of dirt
And the bodies of the ugly angels writhe in joy
Magic and science have killed each other in a battle no one saw
The automotans have spat out their last gear

The night sheds no more of its face
And the mobius clock has reached its end"

"event","In a flash, another norman rockwell christmas has passed. 
My sister came over on the 24th with her husband. As did some friends of my parents. We all sat around telling stories, laughing, and drinking wine. We started eating dinner around 430pm, finished around 6. We talked some more, drank more wine, then began to open presents. Candy, movies, Espresso machine; and a lot of laughs later, we finished. More wine and laughs and stories later, the guests left and we gathered around to watch Sky High.
The next day I woke up late, took a shower, and dressed for my grandparents house. My grandpa is a minister, as are all of his wifes children. Not my grandmothers grandchildren, but my grandpa's wife. So we ate all day long, many homemade foods and sweets. I talked with my cousins about their lives and such. That night, we gathered around the piano to sing chrismas carols and songs about Yeshua. All the cousings got out their instrument of choice and put it to use. A piano, tamborine, two violins, a fiddle, and a guitar. We all sang along when we could. I was the three french hens part.
When me, my mom, and my dad got home that night; we all watched Elf and had chocolates. After that, we all went to bed as sugurplums danced in our heads. 
This morning, I woke up late, went shopping for syrups for my new espresso maker, bought my first bag of coffee, and drove home. 
Here I am now, wishing for more conflict in my life. How strange a man Norman Rockwell must have been."

"event","Be it the prophets, the gifts, or your own personal reasons; there is a reason to celebrate at this time of the year.
I dont call it Christmas, or Chanunukah, or Kwanza, or anything else for that matter. I celebrate the Xmas. For it is just that, the X holiday. The X season. It is a variable that means the different thing to almost every single person. For each person, there is a decision to be made. That decision is of what is important to them at this time of year. Be it divine, the people you know well, or the strangers who need your help; it is your decision to make. 
Consider carefully what you want to celebrate this season, this season.

Then celebrate well and have a happy Xmas.
Party on dudes."

"event","I had two dreams last night. A dual intertwine concerning me and one other. I cannot say yet if this person was this person or merely representing a deeper ideal. 

Dream 1: I am trying to find my friend. This person is nowhere to be found, but the moment that hope seems at a loss, they appear. They are surrounded by their friends and swimming in joy. She quickly passes me and leaves me behind. I try and follow her to her home, but after she enters, the door is locked. I plead to come inside but to no avail. Through the window I can see friendship and warmth among all who reside within. I wake at this point, angry. I dont know if it at her or not, but I was still very upset.

Dream 2: I am on a walk through the world. I find myself passing ways with the same person from the first dream. I have now not seen her in a great while. We talk of past times and our lives and become better friends in those few minutes then we ever were in our past lives. We share in a brief closeness that made the dream worth remembering, nothing sexual, just a closeness of friendship. We hugged for a warming moment and went our separate ways, knowing full well that the friendship would always be there, even if we never saw each other again. I woke at this point. I had some joy from the dream but some sadness because it was only a dream.

I dont know if this person is the focus of my attention, or if she merely represents an ideal that is a point to consider within my own life. But I suppose I am more content now for having the dreams, so there is something gained in there."

"event","Bored at work after 10 hours of selling stuff that people could really do without. About 2k worth of it at an electronics store...lets call it madiomack. I dont have anyone but my roomies to go home to, but at least they know how to have some fun insidoors. Im hoping someone will let me stay with them for new years so I have something to do, otherwise its back home drinking appletinis with my mom and her friend peggy. I could really go for a backrub from a friend right now, any human contact would be great. I donated some money to a woman today because I had it. I think Im going to call her later and see if I can volunteer some work. Seems like a good cause with no religious affilation, makes it even better in my book. Still on the hunt for a girlfriend, cuddly friends, purposes in life, plot, and just good people in general in which to learn from. I am now going to LCC and am taking some cool classes and some required classes. UO wont even let me touch their classes, the bastards. And they call themselves teachers. What I really need to do now is spend as much time surrounding myself with things and people that make me happy and a better person. 

I guess, for now, Im in the same boat as everyone else."

"event","When a person would ruin a life of another person.
Showing the victim the absolute worst aspects of hummanity.
Completly killing off the victims sense of good and bad in the world.
All for a single bit of physical pleasure.

I would like to believe that the evil can be made into the good.
I find, though, that for each person to change...they must see a consequence.
Something must happen to them that is so large that they cannot help but change.
If that something never comes along though...
I dont think that monster inside them is really gone.

Monsters dont just starve for lack of evil deeds.
They live on until killed completely.
And I just dont see that happening a little at a time.
It takes a long time, but it also takes a big something to start it.

If you know someone that has hurt someone else,
and you think they have changed.
Ask yourself...why would they?

If you dont know the reason, or just make one up to make yourself feel better
please be careful.

Be wary of the charming and the kind,
If its too good to be true, it probably is."

I cant say that I know who I am yet. I think I see a glimmer of this part of me or that part of me sometimes and figure that is the part of me that is most prevalant and should just stick with it. I learn later, though, that part of me is only a fraction of what I will one day become. I suppose that over time, we either gradually develop into the people that we will be. Or we will choose to be the people we become out of necessity. 

I want to rush things. I want to become the man I am going to be, and I want it to be a good man. Confidence, intelligence, caring and comprehension. All those corny things people put in want ads. I want to be able to warm the heart. I need to change me, and I need to start now. If I dont, I will be less then I am now. 

If you are reading this, help me in any way you can, please."

I can see in front of me
The bare and exposed limb of a tree
The bark has peeled back for a moment
I take a new breath

I am aroused to the state of aware
The meadow before me, complacent and common
It is all that is between me and the tree
I must clear through

With each heavy step, the weeds ensnarl
The grass consumes my footsteps
Now I see my prize as clear as the moon
It is alone on a mountain of obstacles

With each step further the limbs call to me
The skin beneath the bark sings
The hill is beneath me now
And there is the tree, a fence of metal and pain around it

On will and blood, I pass through the fence
My life is short and my time is nigh
No fruit is on the limb
The leaves are fading quickly

With each step closer the tree fades and grays
I am within reach, the skin underneath burns with life
I place my hand upon that skin
That smooth richness that my life has never known
Pushing all want and desire into a single touch

I prayed for blossoms
A hope that I could save that tree that gave me life
That gave me purpose
I woke before that touch
I woke surrounded by weeds pulling me under

I cannot make it to the tree of perfect beauty
I will let the weeds take me now"

"event","Lastnite I talked to someone I havent talked to in a really really long time. It was great to hear from them, actually when they had IMed me I figured it was just another fu im, but it wasnt it was to really talk, and now I know how that person feels, and I'm glad I do. I felt better after my nite of hanging out w/ teddy (sorry it was boring) but yeah then Chris IMed me and i felt like depessed again, I have told him that I dont want to talk to him anymore but i dont enforce so does that mean that i dont want him to stop talking to me? Another thing I am worried about is that he will get in college and think about nothing but this and not do well. I want him to go places, I want him to do well and whatever he wants to do. I dont even know if he goes to work anymore. I thought him working was great for him. I really did!!! I mean come on no one can sit in there house all day. No one not even him. 
so for right now I have a lot on my mind and im scared for college to start but all at the same time I am really excited! 
So I guess I will talk to you all later.... 

Im out
Love you
Dani"

"event","I dont really know what to title this... as you can see the one i have is weak. But anyway.  My grandmother wont talk to me since Chris came to get his stuff lastnite. And when she met Dan she was kinda mean. I dont really expect her to be open armed happy about the fact that I am seeing anything guy but I guess I thought she would back me up on. I never thought that one of our biggest fights would be over a boy. And if it was going to be over a boy I would have thought that it was going to be I liked him and she hated him, not that I hate chris, It's just she wants me to be with him and right now I cant be what he wants me to be so therefore it's going to be hard. I'm sure when she comes home and Joe & Joe are here she will be even more mad. I feel like she is my family and she should have my back no matter what I did. If I got in trouble would she dis-own me? Im not in trouble but if she is this mad at me for not being with Chris then I dont know what to think. I feel like for the past 18 years  haven't seen the real person, like this whole time I didn't know who she was. I knew what she was like when she got mad b/c I have seen her mad at Trav, and my mom and I remember one nite my Mom was home and all 3 of us (my gram, me , and my mom) were in the kitchen and we were all yelling at each other. it always ends in 1 person walking away and cring b.c the cant stand yelling anymore. 
I dont know I am sick of all the bull shit! Cant wait to get my new car!!!! Hell yeaz! 

I love all of you!

"event","I have had so many bad things happen to me in july that i think this month hates me. Ya'll thinking wow this girl is crazy...but no it reallly has to hate me. I dont know if anyone has read the past jounals but lets me re-cap for you. 
1st I am driving to get Aja and I fish tail and go off the road i poped a beed so therefore my tire is now flat. so i go and call aaa and all that bull house cow poop! and they tell me that they cant help me b/c guess we didn't pay my bill well whatever my grandfather comes out and helps me. So I go to Aja's finally then not even a week later I am at Aja's again (hehe i love that gurl) and I get robbed, yes that's right robbed. Someone robbed my car, my $$$ my cd player and what good is that with out the CDS.... so now i have nothing.... but if that wasn't bad enough I yesterday I go to the shop b4 I go to work and get $5 from gram b/c I was hungry and i need food so i can eat while the baby is asleep, so I go to wendy's and get some really  great food. Now for all you who know where the E.G diner is will know where I am talking about. I am driving along no radio seat bealt on.... and I TOTALED MY CAR! IT'S GONE I HAVE NO TRANSPORTATION! NONE NOTHING! I AM BACK TO I NEED A RIDE OR CAN I USE THE CAR!!! WHAT THE HELL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! okay so this is what happened. 
I am driving speed limit, (go figure when i do drive the way i should LOOK WHAT HAPPEND!!!!) 40 that is... and i am behind this HUGE ass van so i cant see if she is going slow or if the person behind her is going slow we are crusin ago and all of a sudden this women's break lights go on... and i break but i realize that she's like stopped in the middle of the road....there was a car infront of here that didn't blinker and desided to turn into the E.G. diner. well at this point i hear my breaks squealling and i think shit i am going to be MAD close to this women's bumper.... next thing i know i am under in.... and it totaled my car. i was mad scared i sat there and cried, and cried, and cried... i had a lot of people to help me out My Aunt Sue M. came down to see me and 2 kinds on dirt bikes stopped to see if i was okay.... and my gram amd pops were there... I had a really nice cop, it was all just really scary, so now I need to find a car, I think my pops talked to a guy last nite about one. I dont know all i can tell you is that my whole body hurts today and i am really hungry i just dont wanna eat i dont wanna do anything. 
and thank god for my angel in my car that saved my life.

I think I am haning out with Dan today but I gotta wait until he gets out of work... and I dont know when that will be. It's only 11:30 I bet I wont see him until like 4:00- 4:30 and that sux!

"event","Wow! I haven't up dated in here in a really long time. So let me start with before Graduation. I told Chris that I needed space, b/c i did. I wasn't lying I really need to figure out who I am and what I want to be. I mean I know that I want to be a teacher but who i want to be in the world do I want to be?!?!
But anyway I'll move on, so Chris and I are having space a breake, we broke up, and I am taking it okay, I mean I was the one who made the decision but still he thinks that I should have taken it harded then I am. I'm sorry. 
Then the whole thing with Mo's cuzin Jesse mad cool kid mad cool, i took him to meet my dad and all that and he even meet tara. Then my grandparents found out where I was going when I didn't come home until 10:30 and that he was 20 and all this other stuff, got mad at me and told me that I couldn't see him anymore. i dont even know if I shoudl call him. I feel bad. I really do. I dont think mo or him thinks i feel bad, and I think he thinks i stopped hanging out with him b/c of chris and that wasn't it at all. 
Now for this week chris and I have talked and he isn't taking our break up well at all. And i have started to hang out with Josh and his friends only now josh is mad at me b/c I go places with Dan. Okay I can understand him being a little upset but not to call me a ducebag. So I guess I wont be talking to Josh for a lil while. I dont know what to say to him, i dont even really know if its my fault... but anyhow, I mean how do I go about telling the kid I dated for 2 years that i dont feel anything anymore, Im sorry. I feel eh, blah, i feel like the color white. Im sorry. 
But then on to my week, um I got f-in ROBBED! yeah thats right... a white girl went to the GETHO Albany and then went into my car took all my money and my cd player and my CDS i mean what good is the player with out the cds! I was pisted! I didn't know what to do.... So I went to Dans' where josh was and I got him out of band practice and I told him we all went to the cops and they carnt do anything at all, so guess what I just lost 300.00. so now this gurl is lookin for a JOB if anyone knows of any pls! tell me! PLS!!!!! 

Its kinda late and I cant wait to hang out tomorrow.... sometimes i think i am falling to fast that i go going nuts but then i think im realy not going fast and in fact or very slow. And I like it, alot i like that i can hang out with dan and not fell werid... OH and for all teh new lebanoners that think its dan hammon its not... This Dan lives in EG!!!!! 
I think I have issuses when guys say nice things to me it makes me wanna throw up. 
I am sooooo going to bed! I had a really busy day! I told my brother to a skate park thing it was his b-day yesterday, my baby bro turned 13. I cant beleive it.....

"event","For all of you that are reading this I want you to tell me the truth, even if you think I am going to get mad @ you. Im not gunna lie, and i know chris is going to read this. I was really really confussed for a realy long time.(chris thats why i've been acting werid) It wasn't b/c of Trevor, and it wasn't b/c of any other boy it was b/c I could handle you making fun of me anymore, or the comments that just wouldn't be funny it got realy annoying, and I didn't even know how you were going to react so I didn't even tell you. Yes I do talk to other boys beside you, and yes I may flirt with them, but it doesn't mean that I don' t want to be with you! it's just that we're 18 years old and it doesnt seem like we are having fun. The fact that next year i have to pay bills scares me! alot! and right now im in this I wanna have fun and not care about the aftermath.
 not only this but lastnite killed me. I cant think about anything else... I know that I talked to trev about all this but Katie, if there is one thing you need to know, its that I dont wanna break you two up. I have so much going on and I dont wanna do that, I mean honestly... you should know, if I were to break up with Chris and wanted to go after one of the fab 5 you know who it would be. Everyone does. Im really sorry if you think that's what I am tring to do really I am. But I dont know what else to say, I really dont. 
tell me honestly, is it me?"

"event","<FONT color=#9999ff>Lately i've been thinking about Chris, It's funny how we act toward our friends when they are here with us. Like we have a life time to hang out with them, or to talk to them, and then one day you hear that they were in a really bad accident and that he's in the ICU and you flip out, you need something to tell you that he's okay, that your going to have that life time left with him to joke around and talk. It's like when there gone and you know that you should have talked more, or said the one last thing and you really cant anymore. You can't all you can do i look up and know he's there watchin us, makein sure we dont do anything too stuipd. I only wish he were still here to say to me while he's laughin ""punk what were you thinkin..."" he meant so much to me and no one knew. I dont even know if he knew. he does now though, and all I can ask for is that he stays happy up there where he belongs b/c he was an angel here and hes certainly an angel there. The great thing about Chris was that he knew just want to say at the right moment. He knew how to make us all feel better no matter what the circumstance was. he was one of the best people I will ever know. I will always love him and I will never forget the grestest memories I have of him. Like the first time I met him, and the games of bad bitten, math homework while Josh would work on his bike. No one in this world could ever take his place and I dont want them too. He touched so many people's lives and still is. To be that is a great person. Chris <FONT color=#33ff33>I will always remeber you!</FONT> Sometimes I think the only way I can get through this all is to call josh and sometimes I do but alot of the time I dont. I dont know who to talk to they dont know how it feels to lose someone that close and your age. I mean when you hear someone thats 87 who died you know they had a good life time, you know if they wanted they could have done anything they wanted too, but chris was just shy of 17. I still own him his sweet 16 kisses. and the first thing that im gunna do when I see him again is give him his sweet sixteen kisses. <BR>Chris I love you, and somedays I dsont even wanna think about what I should have said to you and I cant stand the fact that i didn't, then the others Im gald you are in a better place, where you can be happy and never worry. I love you punk-in and I know your doing great so stop stressin right? I'll try! *Kiss* baby boy! </FONT>"

"event","<P>Happy Easter Everyone! <BR>&nbsp;Well we had Easter @ my house today. It was good food, fun time, and some excitment, not all good! I went to my Dad's yesterday for Easter dinner, had mad fun! Then got up this morning, went to church was really tired, came home got on the shower, put my clothes on and went back to bed. Then Dan called and woke me up... but it's mmmk... And then our family got here and we had a nice dinner, I got to talk to my Aunt about College, Mer got her tooth knocked out.... lol and then my poor baby cuz 3 yrs. old. wanted to go home so bad and he feel down the stairs, we were all sooooooo scared! It was horriable! I hope to God that he'll be okay! <BR>Then we went to Brain and Beth's... I drove, I dont knwo why I bother I shoudl just let them drive not only do ppl have to say things like your a brat b/c you got a car for graduation, okay why dont you shut up thanx! Dont think I asked for your imput! Nope didn't thanx. <BR>Then I was talking and I had rememered that Chris hasn't even met a big part of my life, I mean we've been together a while why hasn't he met these ppl, so I tel him that it would be nice if he went with me. But anyone that knows anything about Chris and shoudl know that the answer was no. <BR>I'm not even sure why i am going to write this, but im not gunna be shy and im gunna say it! I love chris to death! I do! But latey I have been seeing the light. Liek hello! I want someone that is going to love my family as much as I do all 4 sides. My Mom, My Dad, My Gram, and My Pops! I love them. All of them have been a big influance in my life, if it was to do something or not they still tought me something! I want someone that loves kids, I want someone that doesn't care if ppl just stop by unannounced. I want all of that, I want someone like me that gets along with everyone, not b/c they are ez going but b/c they are all of them in one person. I don't know, maybe I am asking for too much. Then maybe in the end I will marry Chris and none of that will matter. But shoudln't it? Shouldn't I want all of that for myslef. Who wouldn't?! I dont know maybe I have just gone crazy today! I love all of you and hope that your Easter was great! </P>"

And you certainly cant by what they say to you, I couldn't count on 2 hands how many times I have been lied too, or even used, but they all tell you that they love you. why what is the point of that??? why cant you just tell us the truth, or why do you feel the need to make comments??? Really b.c when you aren't around other dicks your the sweetest people, thats why we love you. thats why we stay with you, but when it comes down to it do we really? Do we really know what we want? sometimes we get confused sometimes we dont know what we want. Or maybe we do and we just dont know if its the right move, life it like checkers if you move the wrong way you get jumped and die, if you just stay where you are nothing happens to you. that way you may not be happy but you are safe, Its like you dont run into a wall b/c you know it will hurt, you dont touch fire b/c you know you will get burnt. Why would anyone want to do that to themself? so instead of asking us to do things that will do that to us just wait for us, in the end everything ends up how it should be. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000 size=2>For a long time I thought that life suxed I mean everything was falling apart at once I had no one to lean on b/c no one understood that I had lost my best friend, no one understood that the person that took be out with her died of cancer when she shouldn't have, no one understood that and they still dont. *Chris, Vanessa I will always remember you and love you * </FONT></P>"

Oceans apart day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain
If I see you next to never
How can we say forever
Wherever you go
Whatever you do

I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted, all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now
Oh, can't you see it baby
You've got me goin' crazy
Wherever you go
Whatever you do

I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I wonder how we can survive
This romance
But in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance

Oh can't you see it baby
You've got me goin' crazy
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you
Waiting for you"

Not stressin enough b/c I have LSI prom in less then a month and I dont have my dress yet, but you ask one of your realy good friends to sit w/ you @ prom b/c his gf's friends hate him.. I mean really here is that a big deal... no but some people think that it was... well whatever. So this happens really eaily in the A.M. but no one at all says anything to me. But when someone asked me a question and then flips out when I talk to her... that is. We are in High School here people. High School. Yea whatever on TV you see all the f` in drama why do we have to do it to? Really isn't it enough that we have to go through our long day in hell (NLS). well the end of the day comes around and don't ya know 2 people walk up to be one that I have never talked to in my life and tells me that she hates me... wow like I care, but this is what I do care about they walked away as they did it, can you say IM 5!!!!!!!!!!!! So when I get home one of the 3 wants to talk to me, yea okay well @ the end of the convo I guess I just didn't care anymore. Until I asked why this one girl did hate me... B/c a boy wont go out with her. Its not my fault he doesn't like her as a gf. Really! Its not! I dont sit on his shoulder goin dont date her!!! i mean i care who he dates but I am not going to say dont date her. He is a big boy he can do whatever he wants!!!!! Then I talk to one of my really good friends and i flip out on her sorry baby!!!

Tuesday: A litle scared for my life.... one of the girls said they wanted to hit me... shes bigger then me

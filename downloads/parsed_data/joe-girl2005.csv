I was your little girl at age five,
My world went to hell when you left my side,
Maybe I'll see you twice a year,
I never was enough to keep you near,
I love you still to this day,
Every night I still pray.

I did not mean to be a bad little girl,
I want you here with me in this world,
Your my daddy my hero,
But you left me because I'm not still little,
I'm truly sorry and I still love you so.

You blamed me for a lot to take Erin's side, 
I try my best to still have pride,
I have not many friends and not much family, 
But you will still always be my daddy!

"event","Sorry that I haven't been around much lately. Things have been kind of crazy here, more than normal. I'm in the process of moving to a new camp, and I'm going through all sorts of new training. I'm learning so many new things, and it's weird, but I don't really feel like myself. It must be that acupressure therapy they gave me on my knees - all those years of amateur football take a toll, dude. Not to mention countless hours spent crouched in the woods hunting with my father. 

That reminds me: Must ask Pete to send me some Ted Nugent CDs in the next shipment. Eve and Styles are cool and all (Dude, I cannot stop singing that friggin' ""I get high high high"" song.), but every once and a while I need some good ol' Americana rock-n-roll.

Anyway, they're doing this weirdass massage treatment (Whatever, dude, the chick that does it is this hot brunette with big tits!), and I usually end up falling asleep anyway. It's kind of funny, because I end up waking up back in my bunk most of the time, like I was so relaxed that I slept through them carting me back. And why wouldn't they just wake me up and make me walk my sorry ass home? I don't get it.

Oh, also cool, this morning I made 5s on all of my physical exams. It surprised me, somewhat, because I suck at the over-walls. I don't know why, I normally just can't get my arms and legs to work together in the right way, but today, I just threw down and wrecked that shit. My bunkmate started giving me shit, asking if I was hopped up or sneaking Creatine or something, but the sargeant scoring us gave him five miles of running for speaking out of line. Good. He's a prick, that little nancy-ass Yankee frat boy. Yeah, it was the same one who fucking wouldn't let anyone else look at his Maxim, even after he had read it three fucking times! I always share my titty mags. 

Well, not the one with Tori Spelling on the cover. Shut the fuck up! I was young when 90210 was on the air, and hers were the first pair of fun bags I had ever seen. Okay?! Dammit, now I'm embarassed.

I gotta bounce. It's late, and even though I'm not tired, I should hit the sack. It's weird, because I'm having an easier time typing tonight. Maybe it's just from practice. I never kept a journal before. Whatever. I think I'm going to read a little before bed. This dude from my new camp gave me a book, said I would like it. It's got Harrison Ford on the cover, I guess it was a movie. Something with a bug in the title, I don't know. Whatever, it's Harrison Ford, yo. He's a hard bastard. Even the hardest bastard I know (Wassup, Pete, my brutha!) thinks Harrison can kick some ass when properly motivated.

I'm out."

"event","just returned from night patrol of some sand dude somewhere in the middle of nowhere asscrackistan. i was on a three man patrole and one of the dudes was such a fucking asshat. i mean, kept sititng on his ass pulling out a magazine (maxim, that bastard, and he wouldn't share) and ocmplaining abot everything and everyoen. hes only got three months left and he thinks he can complane to me? fucker.

so, the other dude on my patrol, man, i feel sorry for that bastard. he's married to some crazy bitch back home. she's one of thos emartha stuart types who decorates the house iwth furtniture hes not allowed to sit on and some shit. i guess he met her right before he went on a six-month tour of duty and she roped him into getting hitched before he left. she was a good lay, so he didtn care at the time, and plus, according to him, all the dudes here cheat on their chicks with the enlisted skanks. not me, dudde. i mean, some of the chicks over here are hot, but most of em are bitchs. and htey dont smell good like lanna. shes a maniupulative btich, but at least she smells nice.

anyway, this dude, he's telling me abot his wife and i guess shes totally crayz. like, follows him aoround the house saying that she knows hes cheating n her and why does he do this to her, blah balh balh. and i gues aftert they got married she got fat and shit so he was pissed about that too. fuck, man, i aint ever getting mrried. can you iamgine someone like lana gaining 40 pounds. ha! it owuld be like humping a beached whale or osme shit.

oh, a shout out to my man pete, the biggie smalls of smallville. he hooked me up with some crayzy shit. i got yer back, man, even if your obsessed with luthor.

i would.

anyway, things are cool here. still sucks, no shit. but lana finally sent me a letter. no nudy pics inside, though. stupid bitch. i dont know how more obvious i have to be. 'lana, i am fine. hope you are good. send naked pictures of yourself. love, whit.' she's so fuckiing frigid that bitch. i heard a new one today, something about chicks back home being members of the 'frigerati'. it made me think of fridgerator perry, and thinking of that fat fuck and my girlfriend in the same thought made me want to hurl. fucking gross, man.

anyway, i'll be around. don't send out any fucking crazy recon planes for me. i've heard what those mother fuckers do out there, shooint up shit. whatever.

"event","That fucking show drives me crazy. I mean, it's friggen funny when Homer burps or Bart shows his ass, but I don't give a crap about Lisa and her friggin' saxaphon. and whats with that baby who never grows up? i mean, come on, all that shit they do can't fit into one school year.

anyway, ""american idol"" is on tonight. whatever, dude, the chicks are friggin hot. i'm pissed, though, because some pansy ass teenyboppers voted off the hot skanky looking chick with the dudes name. i don't care what she wants to call herself, as long as i can look at her ta-tas. you know what i'm saying? so tonight, i have to sit in a friggin' jury-rigged tent with 20 other horny dudes and watch that hot chick with the big mouth belt one out. for the first time in my life, i don't want a chick to shut up. not like lana, when you get that bitch talking...well, there's only one way to shut her up then. heh heh.

we got the air conditioned humvee today, which made life in ass-crack-is-stan a little better. i mean, it gets fucking hot here. i got in truble with the sargent, though, because i guess i drive too fast. he said something about me not being in kansas anymore, like he thinks i think i'm fucking dorthy in the wizard of oz. that movie was so fucked up, anyway. poppies? what the hell is a poppy? some dude here toldme that you can get high if ya smoke em and that the natives here used to grow that shit like grass. we haven't foudn any yet, but when i do.....oooh, yeah. i'm going to smoke some of that shit, drink that bottle of bean i won from that pansy assed yankee douche bag officer from boston, and find myself some enlisted chick to bone behind the R&H tents. fucking a. not like i would get any at home. 

lana hsn't even bothered to right me back. i know she's blowing that kent bastrd. and what gets me, is he's so fuckin gay. he totally takes it up the ass, or at least thinks about it. he fuking used to check me out all the time, and i had to beat the crap out of him a cople of tiemes. what did he think, i was fucking gay or something? i'm fucking whitney fordman! all americanfootball and all state quarterback. he can go kiss that faggoty rich boy leck's ass. he totally loves it up the poop shoot. fuck, i can't even talk about it anymore, my stomach is turning.

so this dude back home, pete ross, frosh on the football team, sent me a letter with a bunch of torch's included, so i could see what was happenig on the homefront. he's al ittle crazy, talking about the ghetto and some shit. i mean, i'm with him all the way on the fact that smallville is a shithole, but damn, what i wouldn't give to be sitting on my porch with a 40 of mad dog in my hand watching the fine ass bitches that my mom has come clean the house. they don't speak a lot of english an don't get mad when i grab their asses. man, i miss that shit.

i'm getting some crap from my XO. gotta git offline so he can check out his fave porn site. i bet you he's fucking gay, too. maybe i can set him up with kent when i get out of this fucking hell hole. then maebe he'll leave my womin alone."

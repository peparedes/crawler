i'm definitely in at the Art Institute of New England, 42 days until I move in. Yes, I'm counting down. i cant wait. 

i'm also in the process of moving houses. i am moving into the attic at the new house so ive been busy trying to turn it into the coolest room. i'll be moved in tomorrow hopefully. i'm the last one living at this old dump, my family is all staying at the new house. it's only a couple of streets away.

tonight i saw bridget jones: edge of reason and if you're into bridget jones, you HAVE to see this movie. it is totally awesome. i'm not gonna give it away but i'll just say that it had me laughing the whole way through. i feel like i am her most of the time. haha.

on monday i'll be getting DSL which is just totally fucking cool. cant wait for that.

anyway i'm gonna get going because my fingers are freezing and theres no heat in this shithole. i'll talk to you soon."

"event","Just writing to say all is well.

I went to my interview in Boston today. Amber came along with me and she showed me around the dorms and the school. They both were everything I expected, which is a good thing by the way. My interview went very well and I'm excited for the results. I have to make another trip back to Boston next week to meet with my advisor and the financial aid department. Fun stuff.

Other than all that, nothing else is new at all. I have to work at 8am so I'm gonna hop into bed now. Just wanted to make a sign of life. Talk to ya later."

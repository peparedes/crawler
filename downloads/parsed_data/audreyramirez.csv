<i> Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt?
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts?
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in

In their styes with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking

Everywhere there's lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon

[One more time...] </i> 

WUUU!!! Wasn't that FUNNNN???? Yes. Yes it was. And what's even MORE funnier than the lyrics is the tune. xD Everytime I hear this song I can imagine GIR running into a field in slow mo, playing with his piggies. xD I dunno. I'm insane."

Besides...I don't want to get in trouble with my parents. I don't even want to get in trouble with Chi. And I hate knifes or scissors!!! I hate anything sharp! I hate to bleed...and I hate pain. Especially in the heart...yet alone skin itself. 

I'm not a suicidal girl. Though people hate me, I don't care anymore. I shouldn't care. I should only care about the ones that love me.

<i> Forget it...just get out of my life. Please. </i> -Havana/Tinkerbell

My Dad always said...that...when we fall in love with people...it is not our fault. We didn't decide to fall in love with them. Fate chose us to. When somebody can't forgive you for your actions, it is almost as if life was blind in the first place. I feel as if I've discovered that...I've been living lies of actions of what we humans chose and to. We can't control what our human minds command us to. 

I've not only lost a loved one for my chosen actions, but now a best friend...to even just a friend. I guess this means Havana and me are enemies now. I only wish that she'd know that this wasn't suppose to happen. But I can't lie. I am in love with Jasmine. I'm not sorry for that.

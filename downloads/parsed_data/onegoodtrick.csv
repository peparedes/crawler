i really can't handle a whole weekend of doing nothing, even though it's only a couple days.
kristen spent the night with me last night and we basically ate all night long.
well, i did.
i also made an elephant out of clay and he looks awesome. i named him ebner.

i came to several realizations while coming home today.
i feel a lot better.
but kind of surprised at the same time.

:)

and i finally got a new phone! i still have the same number though.

hmm. nice.

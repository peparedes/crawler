My reasons, I can think faster than I can type, and despite there being many times I wish it were not the case, I have a very good memory, and have no need for material reminders of my thoughts, I had typed out several paragraphs for this, but then I got stumped, and well, I just don't think well in this way, so this is useless to me, with that, I close this journal, and wish for myself that I look upon it no more."

"event","Your entry is as follows:

Today was really great.
I got out of bed really early because I had terrible stomach cramps.

I feel unusual because my antidepressants are making me hairy.

I'm so sad. My kitten got run over this afternoon. I found him when I was coming home from school. His head was all squished. I took some photos. I'll miss him. Poor kitty.

Last night I had to shave my entire body. Apparently, the lice that I caught from Amanda's friend are really hard to get rid of. I look quite strange with no hair and eyebrows. I'd post pictures, but my webcam is broken.

I want to tell the world that my girlfriend Amy is the bomb! She made pizza last night, and even though I burnt my lips on the cheese, it was awesome!!!

I am really annoyed with those assholes at _are_you_hotter_than_us_?, because I am so much cuter than them, and those photos don't do me justice. They can't reject me, so I'm starting my own rating community. Click here to join (the first five applicants are automatically accepted).

Today, I got a digital camera! Yes! Here's ten thousand photographs of my cat.

I want to say thanks to the world for absolutely fucking nothing! You all suck. I feel so alone, no one ever reads this journal, or even comments to let me know that I'm not suffering alone. It's cold here, and I want to die, but I cannot figure out how many of you to take with me when I go.

I went to the doctor yesterday, and he said I have a terrible skin disease which prevents me from coming into contact with other human beings. And bipolar disorder.

You should all do this quiz! It's amazingly accurate. You just put in your name and birthday, and it will tell you what your favourite sexual position is.

That's enough for now. But I'll leave you with some naked photos of myself. (Not safe for work - teehee).

"event","It has been an eternity since I updated this. Since my last update, well, I had my birthday, it was awesome, got money and stuff, went to tournament last weekend and placed 9th, a lot higher than expected. It is my first day off for spring break which has me imensely happy. No prison for a while, I really need to pick things up when I get back though and I have a chunk of stuff i have to get done over the break but that is the furthest thing from my mind right now. 

Tomorrow is Friday, Lisa is coming over at 10:30 and we are hanging out for a bit before heading out to Chinatown EC and the Q. I need to pick back up on the getting AAs thing, it has been a while since I have gotten a nice bunch. Many of my friends are going away for spring break so I am likely going to end up spending a bit of time with people I otherwise tend to neglect. I am looking forward to going out with some of my friends I haven't done anything with in a while.

Saturday I plan to get off my ass and go find a job. I need work and I am planing on droping out of martial arts so, I will have lots of time. I really need the money, I want to get my grubby little paws on some stuff but my current finances do not support what I want. I don't just get handed money from my parents left, right, and center, some people will get like $30 a week out of their parents which is rediculous, if you need money get off your ass and do something.

I am on pretty good terms with everyone right now, though I am sure not everyone is on good terms with me but whatever, their loss, no use being angry at someone unless they have done something, which I haven't so yay. The best way to let someone get over themselves is to talk to them only when needed and be nothing but nice eh, Lisa ;)

Well, I think I am gonna find something to do, don't know what. Maybe I'll go ask my mom if she wants to go out for a bit. I love being on good terms with people, it takes such stress off your shoulders. I just wish more people would learn how to tolerate others. Our world would be a much better place. . ."

"event","Well, yesterday was awesome, I missed most of the week due to illness, and now I have a whole Saturday ahead of me. :) I don't know what I will do with it but whatever, it don't matter, I am in pretty good mood. It is also my birthday next week. My family is coming over tomorrow to celebrate, and next weekend I have no school on Friday and it will be awesome weekend of turning 17. Many friends, many a fun time. Yay."

"event","<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gah, today seemed to go on forever, school was remarkably boring, except for that I got to make chocolate pudding in Foods class. After school, I went to Lisa's house and played some DDR Max and Max2 and enjoyed a platter of cheeses. Then after that I had Hap Ki Do/martial arts. It was really fun today, we were working on Judo style fighting today and I took down one of the black belts that has taken down the instructor before, so I felt good. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow is gonna be interesting, I am going to the Birthday party of a friend at school with most of my other school friends. It will be entertaining, but honestly, I'd rather be out playing DDR and hanging with my non-school friends. I guess you can't always have it your way, but I get to go out on Sunday so it isn't a biggie, I will also finally have the energy to go to martial arts Saturday morning. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am kinda annoyed at school right now, it feels more useless than ever, I haven't done a single thing all week and to be frank, I don't care, my only goal is to pass my classes, which thankfully is not hard, I know I am very capable of getting 90s but I can not find a care in the world to motivate me to do anything at school. It seems excessively useless and over rated to me. I can't wait to finally get out of school. Well, the sooner I go to bed the sooner the weekend will begin so I think I will now retire for the night.</P>"

"event","Wow, I had forgotten I had made this, probably because I am not the kind of person who rights down my thoughts very often, I usually think them through on my own, only ever telling others when I am unsure of what to do. I guess in that way I am self-sustaining. 
   Anyways, on to other things, today was an interesting day, for the last 4 or so days I have been rousing from my slumber with little trouble, which is often not the case. I went to school, unfortunately, thank God I had a spare. Stupid Calm class first thing in the morning, what a retarded class, I get more homework in it then I do in Social. I had my spare after that, of which I spent upstairs, I played a game of Ping-Pong and got pwned, then proceeded to spend the next hour talking with a fellow Matt. He was talking to me about the people he has met and heard stuff about at his work, which is in a warehouse for Canadian Tire. The most interesting person he mentioned was this Japanese guy. He is a Samurai, he has trained all of his life and has adopted that as his lifestyle, he had sick almost inhuman abilities apparently, his mindset was so altered that it is scary, he is incapable of picking something up if he does not think of it as a weapon. He is only 5 feet tall but has a vertical of at least that. It seems far-fetched when you first think about it, but when you realize it, if someone trains there mind from a young age to be a certain way, almost anything is possible. I just wish I had been enrolled in something useful when I was young, stupid parents. . . I always feel like I am capable of so much but I lack one thing: Motivation. Anyways, the rest of the day was pretty much nap time. I had a temper tantrum in Physics and broke my pen over my desk. .lol. Then after school I walked home, listening to my awesome set of 3 techno/trance CDs I made on sunday, apparently I chose the right time to do it cause as of monday they are cracking down on people. Once I got home, I went on to my PS2, played some DDR Max2, I now have every song except stupid MaxX Unlimited AAd and down to withing 5 million of maximum score. Now I am sitting here.
   This weekend is going to be interesting, I am going to a friends birthday party on friday, where there will be much gaming and goodness. Then Saturday I dunno what I will do. Sunday is my planned day for DDR outing. I am somewhat unconcerned at the moment with getting AAs, they seem to happen easily without me trying, I am eying all the songs I haven't passed yet for the most part. I am really hoping to take down Max 300 and Paranoia Survivor this weekend, I guess we'll see. Maybe I will go see a movie on Saturday, get rid of the gift certificates I have.
   Wow, this is a lot longer than I was expecting to make it, oh well. I think I am gonna go do something useful, or that I pretend is useful anyways. I guess I should let some people know this exists so it will get read."

"event","<P><FONT color=#6633ff>Today is Monday. I have never met a person who actually liked Mondays. Well, except when there is a holiday. Speaking of Holidays, Thursday is Thanksgiving and I am totally excited. I am going home on Wednesday night. Tonight I am not going to my class off campus. I have to take Megan to the airport&nbsp;early in the morning. I told her I would do it. I have to get up somewhere around 3 am. I really dont mind. I called her annoying last night.&nbsp; I should not have been a jerk about it but she was being kind of annoying. I still should not have said it to her though. Sometimes I really am a bad friend. One of my many faults. I am a loser without a cause. What can I say?</FONT></P>

"event","I have not written in a while. I have soooooo much homework to do this weekend and I have to go to Kohls and work tommorrow.  I found out that the only day I will be going home for Thanksgiving weekend is Thanksgiving. That sucks. I wanted some time to see my family but I have seen them for the past month so it's not all that bad. I still have not registered for classes yet I have not had time to see my advisor. So I really dont know what to do.  I have really considered about moving back home. I still think about it. But then I feel like I would be trapped and not have the freedom to do whatever.

I enjoy my job but sometimes I dont like it. I guess that is the same with any kind of job. I have only been there three weeks and it is going to take some time getting used to. I have to work for what I want. The only reason I really took the job was because of the insurance. I really need it. If not, I could do work study and work at Kohls and set really any hours that I want. Next semester I am adding another class. I really dont have time to do it all but I will have to do what it takes. In the summer I am not sure how everything is going to work out because of when my summer classes are. We will have to see how it goes. I have to get off of here because I need to do something before I go back to work.

"event","Today is Sunday and I went to church, two different ones. One was on the westside where I live and one was in Newburgh, a 40 minute drive. I liked the one there. They said they have a Sunday nigh Bible Study at my favorite Coffeehouse with College Students, I might just go there next week to check it out. The church was really neat, but I dont want to have to drive 40 minutes. That takes too long I am still checking everything out before I make a decision.

This week has been really difficult on me....A good friend of mine is having some personal problems and wont talk to me about it. That hurts me because in some way I think I have failed her. That is not what friendship is about, when one person is hurting, she tell her friend, and she helps her. That is what is all about. Personally, I think she is frustrated and has a lot of stuff bottled up and I am not there everyday like I used to be. I think that she thinks since I am 5 hours away now, I dont care. It's not true. I am never more than a phone call away. EVER.  But when she wants to talk, I will listen.....

I am to the point where I am ready to be in a relationship. Okay, I have this guy who lives near here who is interested in me, but I am not really all that interested in him. He is a youth minister (with a degree in the ministry) but I am not attracted to him and we aren't really compatible for each other. We get along but I am not into him like that. He works way too much as well. He helps out with the youth in his church but works at the Toyota factory here. He makes deccent money, but I am not materialistic.  

There are a lot of things I am trying to get straigt in my life and school just isnt one of them. I am about *this* close to dropping out and just working full time. I dont want to go to class. I dont want to do homework I dont want to have to learn. I am sick of it. I want my degree and be done with it. I dont want to dissapoint me or my family in the future though. I just want to get married and start a family. I want a purpose. This weekend I think I have never felt this lonely. I just cried Friday and Saturday, I am even a little teary now. I talked to my family and saw a couple of my friends. I just dont know what to do any more. I think I will talk to Holly, she has been where I am.

There is so much mroe I want to say but I am so tired right now. I have orientation for my new job right in the morning. I best be getting on to it....

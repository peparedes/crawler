"event","There have been many great battles in the history of America. The Colonials vs. The British; North vs. South; a handful of Super Bowls. There are numerous ones that have defined the essence of being American. Today, one such battle was fought: Man vs. Machine. In this case, particularly, it was Myself (the underdog, good-looker) up against <b>The Feminist Opressor</b> itself, the sewing machine. Yes, I fought the sewing machine and after a two hour struggle of threading, cutting, and the act of sewing itself, I emerged victorious. About as victorious as one can get after altering a shirt from a size of medium [what was I thinking?] to the size of youth large [what was I thinking?]. At least it was just a 'practice run', you know...I say that so I can pretend that none of it really mattered.

In other fascinating points of my ""snowed-in"" day, I started to draw [finally]. Thankfully I had an EE-PIF-UH-NEE and I now know how I want my characters to look. This doesn't mean so much to me (aside from it allowing me to move past phase one) so much as it means absolutely nothing to you...yet. Just wait...my life will soon contend with some of the best drama you have yet to hear.

Speaking of drama [""hey...did you hear?""], I've gone back to the whole 'making-shirts-by-writing-on-them-with-permanent-marker' phase for at least one day after I thought of a hilarious little slogan/paragraph that captured how I felt about ""public couples"". It's as follows:

<font size=""+1"">ATTENTION!
P.D.A. is <u>NOT COOL!</u>
Stop making out.
It's really gross.</font>

Oh yeah; the ugly/fat kids are gonna love that one. Now I won't even have to yell at them when they display their disgusting attempts at combating lonlieness as I'm walking to my next class...

...my next class where I read and/or write. God Bless the American Schooling System. Don't you love it/me?"

"event","Usually when someone goes off to college there's the idea that they'll actually learn something from it. Be it on the educational level, social level, or just something random. The point is: they learn something. Unless they go to a religious college in Canada and drop out after one semester. The person that accomplished this feat? None other than a good friend of mine: Andy Kile. Following in his brother's footsteps, Andy went to a college in Canada, did...nothing, and has now returned home and is making his living (thus far) as a janitor (also like his brother). If this were a depressing movie aimed at teens to get their life in gear, the story would end right now. OH NO! 

Oh no indeed. This is right where the story picks up. It's a dismal, cloudy Sunday. Snow should be on the way and I'm sitting on my bed with a stack of damp pants because I tried to become a multi-tasker and wash practically all of my dirtied clothes at once [touche` dryer, you win this round]. That's when ol` Andy Kile snakes into the room. Sure, the meeting was arranged, but the timing is a bit off. Needless to say, I tossed some clothes back in the dryer, took a shower, played some Sega Soccer Slam (the NBA JAM of soccer) with Andy and we hit the road. Our destination? Kid Christ's house.

We pick him up, yadda yadda yadda, we get on our way. Sure enough, I ask him why he gave up so fast (aside from the obvious: he's Andy Kile) and he gave some sort of response. I know that it involved words and a story about a pooping contest of sorts...I wasn't paying attention so much as I was trying to navigate the tracks of a damaged taty CD. Eventually he gets onto the topic that piques both KC's and my interest: He's going into the 'Underground Beta Fish Fighting' ring. Yes, the...well, what I just said. Odds are you don't find this as funny as me and you weren't in the car with us to hear how Andy described it, but regardless...it's fucking hilarious.

Training Beta Fishes to fight each other (of which they would gamble and whatnot). What a great idea. By day he would be a mild-mannered school janitor and at night he would be the ringleader of Underground Beta Fish Fighting. The only problem? Lack of a Beta Fish. Easily solved though. One quick stop at a Petco and 15 minutes later he walks out with what hopefully will be his prizefighter, Little Jerry (for all the Seinfeld fans). The big fight goes down this upcoming Friday. For all of those in the general area of Monticello, MN, I highly suggest you stop by...unless you're a cop.

"event","Oh man. What a great show. Easily the best concert I've been to <i>all year</i>.

Just so I don't forget, some things to remember that went down:

They started off with 'I was born (a unicorn)'
They thanked the audience; first we were st.paul, then arkansas, and finally missouri (but it changed throughout the night)
The std song came next [The Clap]. it was intertwined with that Kylie Minogue song and then 50 Cent's 'P-I-M-P'. I'm a mothafuckin p-i-m-p.
They played some more music. 
They're really funny. 
Eventually they brought up a homeless guy onstage and they tried to buy deoderant from him; eventually they did. 
More music. All good. 
Some guy in the audience made a shirt. Nick met him. Then he introduced him to Alden. They had already met. Alden politely refused to wear his shirt (because they were dressed up really nice). 
The homeless guy came on again, unexpectedly this time. He said that 'them kids know how to rock' and he gave a shout-out to 'boobs and beer'. 
The Unics [as I lovingly call them] realize how much this town knows how to party.
Somebody brought up politics. In the end we all decided that 'The Predator' should be President in...05 (apparently). 
Yes.
A ghost story followed. Tea, biscuits, and gravy.
More laffing.
SUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAY!
They were told that wrestling was going on at the Target Center (it was actually basketball, but that's not as funny).
The Unicorns used to wrestle. 
Inside jokes.
More music.
Thank you.
Last song.
Clapping.


The Unicorns > You. Unless you = jesus. Big ups to J-man."

"event","Friday nights with nothing to do are always fun. I get a good nite's sleep, at the least. Albeit a boring one. Sitting. Thinking. Knowing that I <i>could</i> be doing something, but I'd much rather not. I can wait for the good stuff to happen (and it will). Today at school = one big day of reading my book. School, I've decided, has become the place where I shall actually dream up and put into reality my dreams/thoughts; home is where I need to continue this. Oh well...that'll happen eventually. Eventually...

I'm just glad the semester is over; however, I think my grades aren't going to be nearly as high as I'd like them to be. That's pretty meaningless though, considering I have all of my credits. Oh well. What isn't meaningless these days?

"event","Well...the year isn't over just yet, so I'm changing my top ten list of cds. Not that it matters anyway. More or less I'm just doing this for me so I can look back on it in a couple <strike>years</strike> months and see if/how my tastes have changed. Yes. Fun all around. Getting to the point though; here is my [revised] list:

1) Cursive - The Ugly Organ
2) TV on the Radio - Young Liars [EP]
3) Thursday - War All the Time
4) Yeah Yeah Yeahs - Fever to Tell
5) Ted Leo and The Pharmacists - Hearts of Oak
6) The Shins - Chutes Too Narrow
7) The Wrens - The Meadowlands
8) Grandaddy - Sumday
9) Pretty Girls Make Graves - The New Romance
10) The Blood Brothers - Burn Piano Island, Burn!

As you can see, not a <i>whole lot</i> changed. Just some rearranging and substituting. And yet, I feel that there was so much good music released this year. Then again, what do I know about music? Probably more than I/you/<lj user=""travelandlisten""> think. Hmmm....so here's some more CDs I think you should listen to (that came out this year). Oh, let the music go:

11) Broken Social Scene - You Forgot It In People
12) The Books - Lemon of Pink
13) Radiohead - Hail to the Thief
14) Coheed & Cambria - In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3
15) The Rapture - Echoes
16) My Morning Jacket - It Still Moves
17) The White Stripes - Elephant
18) The Mars Volta - De-loused in the Comatorium
19) ZWAN - Mary/Star of the Sea
20) Rob Dougan - Furious Angels


Okay. Now that that's out of the way and all, it's time to move on? Sure...


Kill Bill is an awesome movie. I'm sure you already knew that though...


Hell, what don't you know?"

I bought CDs (more). Then I chatted it up with the man that was behind the counter. Seemingly 50 he acted more like I. Both conversing in music. It was good times. I left the store with <b>!!! - Me and Giuliani...[single], The Books - Lemons of Pink, The Microphones - The Glow, Pt.2, Broken Social Scene - You Forgot It In People.</b> I've only listened to !!! (in the car no less so I was not abled to get my dance on, regretfully) and The Books. Both find me feeling fine.

If that wasn't good enough [and is it ever, really?], we* then mosied on over to a store to buy clothes. Well, I bought clothes. Lots and lots of them. Two pairs of pants and two shirts. Plus a black hoodie. For when I'm feeling emo. Speaking of, there's an Emo, Ontario. That's one of my shirts says. It's from Canada [^_^]. Hurray for Canadia[n shirts].

Hurray for you.

I know that in the back of my mind I will somehow be fucked over for this when I go out shopping (despite the fact I already know what I <strike>have to</strike> need to buy. Weee. Nothing more fun than Christmas Eve shopping, followed by (w)rapping, followed by Church. 

Speaking of Church, despite the fact that 89% of my ideas/views on the whole religion thing differ greatly on what the Catholics preach, I still miss the old church we used to go to in Arizona. That, looking back, was actually fun compared to the mindless drone that is Minnesota churches. God damnit people, put some emotion into it when you sing! Hold hands! Smile! Etc...

It's depressing. And it makes me wish for The Apocalypse/Armageddon. Yes. That should be a fun time. I think the whole world could use a makeover though. 

Now for a complete 180. The trees outside are crystal white. Lovely. The sun is out and all is shiny/shining.

Electric Fetus = best store ever. They had everything I wanted and more. Alas, the bastard that is money held me back and I had to refrain from purchasing many worthwhile muscial offerings. That's not to say I came away empty handed, oh no! I picked up a foursome of fun! Well...okay, fuck...I'll just tell you what I bought:

TV on the Radio - Young Liars EP
The Mars Volta - Live EP (OMG IT'S ONLY SOLD IN INDIE STORES LIKE W-T-F!?)
The Wrens - The Meadowlands
The Shins - Chutes Too Narrow

Well; would you look at that? They all start with the letter ""T"". Ha ha ha ha ha. They're all also really good. Especially TV on the Radio. They need to release their LP now. And then tour. Here. But, I'm sure it'll be 21+. Damn. Anyway...if you don't already own it (I'm looking at you, everybody) then go buy it. Now. Or give me a CD-R. No...just go buy it. Trust me. [One of the] best cd(s) out this year. And it's only an EP. Sad.

Speaking of music and the fact that I'm a somewhat elitist/fan of all of it, I finally came to the conclusion for the inclusion as to what will be on my (drumroll) <font size=""+1"">TOP TEN CDs OF 2003</font>
10)  The Rapture - Echoes
9) Pretty Girls Make Graves - The New Romance
8) The Blood Brothers - Burn Piano Island, Burn!
7) The Shins - Chutes Too Narrow
6) The Wrens - The Meadowlands
5) Yeah Yeah Yeahs - Fever to Tell
4) Ted Leo and The Pharmacists - Hearts of Oak
3) Thursday - War All the Time
2) TV on the Radio - Young Liars [EP]
1) Cursive - The Ugly Organ

Yup. Agree. Disagree. Whatever; I don't care what you think. I know I'm right, baby. Unless you're Dylan. Ooooooh Dylan *Swoon*. Anywho. Back on track now. Speaking of music...went to The Jayhawks show. They were okay, but I was tired and the opening band, The Melismatics, rocked my socks (yo)! What's even better is that those guys [Mels] are playing January 3rd (w/ Superhopper and TBA) at Triple Rock. So...who's coming with me? It'll be a good, if somewhat cold, time. We can chat it up and talk about how we only really hang out at concerts. You know how we do. 

Speaking of concerts. Bright Eyes and Jim James (of My Morning Jacket) are coming in concert. *Squeel* Feb. 20th. Pantages Theatre. Should the price be right, I'll be there for surely. Uh huh. Yup yup. And then...the day after...is Senses Fail. Heh. And then...sometime in March/April...Thursday/Cocoa/AFI <b>better fucking come here</b>. Oh...now I'm just rambling about concerts. Especially when I have nooooo money. Damn you, Christmas. I'll find someway to pin this all on Jesus. He never gets blamed enough. 

What else, kiddos? Oh. School = why? Tomorrow will be so meaningless aside from the fact that it will allow me to turn in an already late project. Ha ha! Damn, my grades are so good so it feels weird when I have to actually do work for a class. Yikes. I need to start concentrating on things that matter...like buying a guitar. [zach, you're rambling again...] Oh. Fuck. Kcuf! Ku-Kuff. That's my new word. Damnit...there I go again...

More shopping. More buying. More selling. More lieing (okay, I only said that because it ryhmed).

I only said it to impress <i>you</i>..."

A warm fire is stirring in the fireplace as hot cocoa is waiting to be drunk. Not in the kitchen though. We are laying down in the softest bed imagineable. Curled and cuddled up ever so tightly. Eureka's Castle is on TV (as is every great Nick Jr. and Nickelodean show that was watched during adolescence), but it's not being watched. We're staring into each other's eyes and loosing track of time. Lips lock and kisses fade into eternity. The sun hides behind the clouds again and a white mist washes over the night. Only for it to be repeated once more and everlong."

I was dead tired/sick for most of school today, so I didn't really do much of anything. It sucked; majorly. Like, totally yeah I know.

I also found out some news about concerts and stuff because that's pretty much all I do for the first two hours of the day (sit on a computer and look up concerts and stuff, that is). Apparently The Desparacidioaseaodsiod (Conor's side band) aren't going to be on the Plea for Peace tour. I wonder if another, better band will instead take their place. Hmmm? Speaking of better bands, CoCoa is going to go on tour with AFI and Thursday. This is like...orgasm. They better fucking come here. Or I'll kill God. You're God.

I played me a little Sigur-Ros and Pretty Girls Make Graves in the art room today. The teacher, who's a stupid, ignorant bitch (trust me, this is a well-established point), seems to think that my acrylic painting right now (which is similar to the Sigur Ros 'Agaeits Byjurn' cover) is obscene. Mainly because of the FUCKING UMBILICAL CORD coming out of its stomach. Not the crotch area; therefore: not phallic. Ugh...perverts.

I also don't feel like getting RotK tickets today...blah blah blah, blah blah, blah blah.

"event","I woke up at 7:30 so I would be able to let my friend's girlfriend inside my house. Then we layed in my warm bed for a good hour trying to sleep/listening to Sigur-Ros/watching shitty, Saturday morning cartoons. Eventually we got around to shopping (for Christmas of course). Lo and behold I only bought one thing, and it was for me. Well...there's always <i>next</i> weekend. That's when all the shopping really counts. 

Anyway, to get to the main story (which you're all dying to hear). The night began around four o`clock in which we (myself, Snook, his girly and a mutual friend) made way to the Yellowcard show (in my mind, however, it was the Matchbook Romance/Motion City Soundtrack show). We got side-tracked at a ticketmaster selling place only for me to realize that they stop selling tickets once doors open. So, we trecked to the venue and ended up saving money anyway. We got there late though, so Snook freaked out and thought he'd missed MR. Not the case! As is with every show, they were late to set up, blah blah blah, they started playing 20 minutes after we got there. It was pretty decent. I mean, we're not talking any high-quality bands here; just some, ""Hey, let's go to a concert tonight"" type of shit. Point being, it was a good release of what little energy I had left. I was able to sneak in my cam-uh-ra (more on this later) and I took, well, tried to take some pictures. This is the only one that really came out:
<img src=http://pic1.picturetrail.com:80/VOL111/1708099/3281505/40234459.jpg>

Next up was Motion City Soundtrack. I'd been meaning to see them (what with the fact that they're from here and all) and now I finally did. They were swell. I took pictures of them too:
<img src=http://pic1.picturetrail.com:80/VOL111/1708099/3281505/40234473.jpg>
<img src=http://pic1.picturetrail.com:80/VOL111/1708099/3281505/40234467.jpg>
This is about the time that I got a *tap, tap, tap* on my shoulder only to see a securtiy guy point at me; eventually pull me, and confiscate my cam-uh-rah. Boo hoo. Oh well, I needed a reason to get out of there (there being 2nd/3rd row) and getting wa-wa. So I handed the camera over, blah blah blah, hung out with my friends the rest of the show. 

There was a lame/disappointing interlude between MCS and YC in which some morons tried to win a snowboard. The fat kid won.

Then everybody got sleepy and we decided to leave; but I, of course, needed to retrieve my camera. I found the guy, asked for it back, and he ended up walking me all around the [R&B] club until we finally got near the exit (all without my friend's knowledge), handed me the camera and had two, big black guys escort me out. The funny thing is that on my way out, the lead singer guy from MR was coming back into the club so I shook his hand and smiled while they [big black guys] were shouting that I was not allowed back in. He [lead singer guy] laughed. We all laughed. Then I sat and waited and eventually my friends wandered out. Then we left...

Yes, it was a good way to kill a Saturday night. All I have on my agenda now is to pick up LotR: RotK tickets. Bladdy bladdy blah!

"event","I originally came on here to start writing, maybe thinking that I had been inspired by some events that transpired earlier on in the day. What do I do instead? I read. Ironic. Well, at least the ball is rolling. Now I don't know what to talk about. I've come to the conclusion that nothing ever changes. Not recently at the least; over time, yes. Change happens. All the time. It just doesn't seem to be doing so right now. At night, I fantasize about going to school the next morning and jumping on top of the table and announcing to the rest of the school that today they should do something different. I never do though; I'm not <i>that</i> different either.

Every day though. I figure that these are, indeed, the doldrums of high-school life. One final year. Instead of changing or growing, we instead move back. Movie after movie; meaningless overheard projection followed with similar notes; all for 'the hardest test of the class thus far'. Hardly. I suppose I shouldn't/couldn't be surprised. To prepare you for the world where you have control over everything you do, you must first decide if you care about what high school classes you take. Which, in reality, boils down to: really fucking hard OR really fucking in between. No middle. Middle doesn't exist in the real world. Middle = failure. Everybody needs their AP classes to teach you how to bitch about something that nobody could care less about. 

That's not to say that <i>I</i> don't care about it. It's just ridiculous is all. I haven't had to write ONE paper all year so far. One. So yes, for the slow, that means I haven't written a single paper all year. It almost feels as if the school superiors (yes, they're out there somewhere) want everyone's GPA to drop down into the 2.0 range so they can receive funding for the more ignorant kids that have yet to be. Just a vicious cycle that, in the end, really only ends up pissing me off. Pissing you off. If you're a student; hell, just get pissed off anyway. Just another problem that society needs to learn to deal with. That's a whole nother topic that could be spoken of, but this is neither the time nor place.

Back on track of not being on track; the world, as a whole, is getting unconsciously more ignorant. Two years ago already feel like another life just based on how I was taught (to learn). Or wasn't taught, being the issue at hand. What is it that makes me want to learn more, yet a majority of the rest of the population is content with what they already have now (pursuing more would just be a waste, of course). Go to college, get a degree, get a job, get a spouse, get a family, pay taxes, die. Rinse and repeat. No inbetween; that would require too much thinking. That doesn't even begin to get me started on the kids that <i>think</i> they're thinking for themselves (Hot Topic shoppers, I'm looking at you). Or the ones that think that somehow they'll make a decent, if not excellent, living...they just don't know exactly what from.

-Time Out-

So, in my departure I happened to watch South Park. They did the perfect depiction of a 'Goth' kid. One I've made many times. This is just added in here to solidify that what I do think is meaningful. Maybe not to you, but for other people...surely. 

Surely.

I was at work today, standing around, zoning out; the standard fare. When my co-workers got into a heated debate about the next 'console war'. It makes me feel bad. For them? Or for what they're talking about? Or...because that is, in general, where the main concerns are. In simplistic, meaningless tug-o-wars. Like arguing over music for example; or being so damn sure of yourself. Is that a flaw? 

Hmmm...I've gone completely off my subject matter. It's all a learning process though. Depressing one though.
Everything is these days. Too concerned with trying to not feel pain; when you should be more concerned about finding happiness.
Moving on to the subject at hand. So, everyday, in and out...it all feels so similar. So much so, that I get the feeling that something is going to happen. That something is going to happen. The fictitious anime that I've watched over the years has slowly warped my mind (or, at the very least, taught me something).  I'm just waiting for the meteor to strike/a dark enemy to appear and try to conquer the lands/a time warp to occur.
Speaking of dark lords...

...seven days = hurray.

Might as well end it on that note."

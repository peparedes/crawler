ok...well in the begining i randomly put a 7/11 red slurpee on gerald from my chemical romances porch...wtf? and then i magically appeared in his room? and he had pinkish red carpet. then it started to rain and we went to highschool. and it was like a mix of my highschool, and my old middle school. and a bunch of people who are famous now were in it, but they were around my age. and rachelle was with me. and then we saw sully from godsmack playing ""running blind"" acustic and i threw a rock at him and told him he sucked and needed to die...im so mean..but whered i get the rock?and we were still with gerald..who was also wet from being rained on earlier. and we all went into the girls bathroom and blow dried out hair..hahahaha, even him. then we went back to gerald house with a bunch of cheerleaders....im not exactly why. and it just ended. 

i have to have the most random mind ever...i dont know why i thought about any of that while i was sleeping."

"event","the perks of being the best friend

the perks of being the best friend are usually great nothingness, staying up till 3 am painting sporks that will later crack and break. finding the spork after months of not seeing it brings back the memories of laughing and being an add toaster oven. its things like that that make you feel better in a disagreement. like one persons being pissy, and offends you so your pissy back, but them you remember the spork painting, or the late  night kung-fu, or the rednecks down the street riding their lawnmowers, or the same rednecks putting on small banjo shows on their backporch, making fun of them was great. turning out the lights when getting ready for bed, but actually just returning from the sleepy state and talking for an hour about meaningless stuff is usually one of my favorites. being the best friend is way more than what it seems. there are no words that i can think of more than pure love. if i can find a longer word for it id like to know. but for now best friend = love and thats all im going to say about that <3.


"" i loved it all, i loved the girl, i loved my friend""

rachelle, i know your the only person that reads this thing anyway, but i heard that lyric for thr 1000 time today in english and all i could think about was u, and how i couldnt wait till i got home to talk to u. and even though out convo wasnt great im hoping itll get better before u leave for the night <3"

 my father don't know me
 my mother ignores me
 my brother adores me
 mom's ex boyfriend abused me, but she'll never know 
 cause she don't give a shit anymore...

` being knocked around
 gives me hope that one day it could be better
 (could be better)

 step dad hates me
 mom doesnt care anymore
 my brother left me

 this needle in my wrist gives me temporary relief and says
 ""everything will be ok, okay?""
 (be okayyyyy)

`being doped up gives
 me hope, that one day it could be better..
(could be bettteeerrr)

 the noose is getting tighter
 im drifting away
 now maybe my father will finally know
 just who i am, my mother will care,
 my brother wont dare to come home
 my step dad will be happy,
 maybe my abuser will read that i did this because of him...

 being dead
 will give them hope,
 that it'll all be okay on day..
 ( be okkk, one dayyy)

Im a Soldier74: ok so theres more people like me sry i cant help that
AnRcHyPuNk714: u dont just go out and tell ppl their ugly, which shes not. its not right
AnRcHyPuNk714: what in gods name possessed u to say that
Im a Soldier74: um it was a question that i wanted answered and she went and got pissed so it never really got answered

"event","wow, today was magnifico. i almost feel bad that i feel soooo good and rachelle doesnt. i feel so bad for her. but here is what happened today and yesterday.

YESTERDAY: 
well most of yesterday blew, but i was gonna hang out with my friend chris at the park. so i did, and on my way there a guy honked at me and my foot got lodged in a moldy,algae infested puddle. after cursing and kicking muck off my foot i continued. when i got there he was all huddled up on the bleachers so i joined him. after awhile of catching each other on fire...dont ask, we went to the swings and talked for and hour or so. then my mom picked me up and he went home.

TODAY:well i went to second period and told everyone about hanging out w/ him and they all called me a fucking dumbass for not making a move.i know i prob should have, but im shy and i havent made out in 2 freakin yrs so its not my fault.but then after second period he gave me a note and told me not to show anybody. so i took it to homeroom and read...heres what was said:
rachael,
   whats goin on?well hey, you looked reallly hott yesterday on the swings. i kinda wanted to kiss you...a lot.what would you have done if i did actually do it?well im sittin here in mrs. wears class. how gay? VERY.well, im gonna go,write back if u want.
later,
chris.

after making myself calm down i grinned and it was great.i wrote him back saying id prob kiss him back..and that britney called me a dumbass for not making a move.

then after third he grabbed my back pocket and put something in it and told me to go to 4th lol. so when i got there,i read this note lol
hey,i didnt have any paper so i wrote on this ( a pic) it`s dark so i cant see.well hey i think i want you to make a move.so why dont you?it wouldnt bother me much.jk,i think itd be pretty cool if you did make a move well i have to go later.......oh how he makes my heart beat weird.i cant stop thinking about him and he`s not even that pretty lol. his personality is like woah though..and i reeeaaalllly like him.well im gonna go for now. i cant wait till this weekend me and rachelle are gonna have a blast."

"event","havnt posted in a while, sorry yall. well the girl i like has gone back to mississippi now. i miss her already, and shes only been gone for a lil while... lol. i dont kno if we are gonna try hookin up or not, i guess it depends on how much she can come back to visit. ya, i ruined my chanced with that other girl, because i like krista and i wouldnt be able to have a relationship with some1 and not be 100% in it, ya kno? so basically i told her i want to give things a shot with krista and she kinda got mad. oops. but were still friends, i think, lol. neways, i still havnt got to solo, and its really getting on my nerves. o ya, the 4th of july was pretty cool. i got to work the inflatable games at the park for my church. it was fun. ummm, ya so im outta things to say, so ill update later."

"event","life.. can it get any more confusing? the situation.. 2 girls. one really likes me.. the other used to, dont kno if she still does. both live a good distance away from me. the girl that really likes me is really nice, and really sweet.. but the truth is i really really like the other girl. she is perfect for me. we all know how picky i am, lol, so not too many girls meet what im looking for. the girl that really likes me is all for long distance relationships, but the girl i really like doesnt kno about it. i honestly think that we should go for it and just see what happens. if things work out, great... but if things dont work out.. then i am fine with just being friends. so everyone reading this.. tell me your opinions. if 2 people liked each other enough, she they at least TRY to make things work, and see where they go? i wanna kno what other people think. and.. its not like we wouldnt be friends if we broke up.. we are already pretty good friends."

      <p>I don't quite get it. I am smarter, fitter, and bolder than my potbellied brother ever could hope to be, yet he gets all the fame, fortune, and glory, not to mention Peach's heart. If only I was the first player in Super Mario Bros... things could have been different. Maybe I can make a comeback, now that I finally have my own game.. but probably not. After all, I'm just Luigi.</p>

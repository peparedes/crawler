wow,

well then.

what's knew with me you ask? (besides the NEW phone *squeel*)
not a whole hell of a lot. 
I am now a manager at sears. I run the Lands' End department. It's good money and my associates aren't COMPLETELY useless but it's definitely more stress.
I am still with julio and things are going well on that front.
I don't get to see my friends enough (the bitch of being management) but I still play pool every wednesday like clockwork.
I've gained like ten pounds *pout* but plan on actually joining the YWCA with all that new money
I am going to go see my chris, who sadly decided to go to school out of state, in about three weeks.
I don't get the chance to paint often enough
I'm still a cumpulsive reader.
and last but not least (actually it really kinda is least now that I think about it)I've become addicted to the TV series House...but I still don't watch TV, so I've only seen the first two seasons because they are out on DVD.

so, I miss you guys, and I have tuesdays off so give the spiffy (my new phone if you missed that post) a call and I'll do a little dance to under pressure by david bowie and freddy mercury and call you back...promise!"

<p align=""center""><font face=""Verdana"">The Hanged Man is perhaps the most fascinating card in the deck. It reflects the story of Odin who offered himself as a sacrifice in order to gain knowledge. Hanging from the world tree, wounded by a spear, given no bread or mead, he hung for nine days. On the last day, he saw on the ground runes that had fallen from the tree, understood their meaning, and, coming down, scooped them up for his own. All knowledge is to be found in these runes. </font></p>
<p align=""center""><font face=""Verdana"">The Hanged Man, in similar fashion, is a card about suspension, not life or death.&nbsp;It&nbsp;signifies&nbsp;selflessness, sacrifice&nbsp;and prophecy.

woke up on black friday to snow.....made shane drive me into work at quarter to seven. the vice pres. got in around 9:30.

my day went as well as it possibly could. only had to work two five hour shifts instead  of an eight and a five and i got to grab some dinner with my jenni.

meh, i need to go and sleep.

for those of you wondering about the possible shindig. it's going to be happening around seven pm. on sunday, but there will be no cooking dinner, there will just be haning out, so if you want to come and hang out with me let me know."

<lj-cut text=""cut to spite brent""> okay, i haven't updated in over a month and i havn't had the ability to get out much, and so the answer is this is going to be a gigantic post full of a few things you'd like to know and vastly more that you couldn't care less about. have fun sifting through:
maybe this should be devided into catagories or something, cause every one knows i suck at timelines



food: well, my boy took me out to dinner while he was home, that was lovely in and of itself, there were several all night card games at perkins, which is always of the good. i learned a new card game, it's the latest craze, i'm sure a large part of my friends list has already been initiated into the wonders of scotch bridge. my brain is however lacking for some food, i've been totally devoid of good books or the desire to re-read classics, ah well, perhapse the cold will help to stimulate that portion, nothing like a good book and some chai.
  oh man, also the wonders of ghetto mac and cheese and super kool-aid

shelter: oh man the house is a mess...M.E.S.S. but there is now a working estrogin lounge, and that is the best thing ever. also i love my roomates, dearly and deeply and the bonding of the last month has made me very happy. also in a general complex sense, thank go for town homes and the lovely snow shoveling/salt laying maitenence staff that comes with them. and my dear friend bonnie in whose wedding i am going to be a bridesmaid this spring, may be moving into the complex with her fiance' in the near future (much excitement there)

water: i should prolly drink more of this, and get back into exersizing, i would be much happier if i had regular access to a lap swim pool. and of the frozen variety: there will soon be ice skating for me and my jenni (and whomever else may wish to join)

comunication: paying my phone bill sucks and keeps me poor, but it also alows me to talk to my sweetie every day, and for that i make the sacrifice. i have rarely seen any one with whom i do not share quarters, and whereas that's all well and good, i miss my friends so, if you can read this post and haven't hung out with me.....fix it!

money: work is going well, i am poor as shit, but have begun to rectefy that by getting a second job, which doesn't lend a helping hand to the paragraph above, but well, it's needed. also, torrid is going well, but i now have proof that there will never be any form of advancement, good thing that my second job (at sears of all places) looks to lead to a full time position in the visual department, maybe in a bigger working environment i will have more of an oportunity to shine, we shall see.

love: fantastic, absolutely fantastic. i am in love and well, it is good. i miss him though, oh and how.

sanity: not so much of the good, with all these planets in retrograde and the seasons changing, the various incedents and the holidays approaching, i am nucking futs more often then not.</lj-cut>

so, i'm thinking of throwing some sort of orphans holiday get together sometime this weekend, let me know if any one is interested 

love you all"

all except for the begining anyway, i was awakened by a bad dream, but after that things picked up, here's the 50 cent tour:

had a nice lazy morning sitting outside and reading, went into work, worked a short shift (four hours), heather came to pick me up and we got coffee and meandered before heading over to marks house for much time with corwin and bonding (man heather and i were giggling, it was obnoxious for others i'm sure but i loved every minute). had an absolutely fantastic meal then went out to rocky. the show was...interesting....then because every one from my house was still wired we went to hang out. it was actually rather nice, i danced my very first pole dance, don't worry i was fully clothed. i stayed up untill oh i don't know...8 o'clock, for those of you paying attention, that's 24 hours, sometimes i like it when my days are actually chronographic DAYS.



and i have to be up at five o'clock monday, so i'm done for now."

"event","ummmm, ooops, i really and truelly thought that i had to be at work ass early tomorrow, good thing i checked my schedual huh? i totally don't work 'till noon, score!

by the by, i LOVED today, it was amazing and happy and full of life and stillness, companionship and pleasure. I was awake and refreshed by nine, off to work by ten thirty, the walk was exillerating with the wind and sunshine. i love this time of year, not the fall mind you, i can't actually abide the fall, no i mean the last days of summer when it looks like june and smells like december.

i realized after working a perfectly timed and useful hour and a half that the feeling i get sitting outside on a sun warmed piece of sidewalk smoking a cigarette and reading a novel is pure forbidden comtentment. it feels exactly like a ditch day from back in highschool when i would walk out through the courtyard, strolling with my nose in a book and wander the hills of highland park looking for a comfy patch of moss to sit and just breathe.

beyond that i got to go to a coffee house with lizzery, commune with jenni, talk to julio (three times *grin*), sway with justin and chill with jet. dinner was at a nice little resteraunt called rissaminnis on it's last night of buisseness, where i have spent many a night post ice skateing doing crossword puzzles and sipping orangeina. i'll miss that place.

If any of my readers out there consider themselves intellectuals, i recommend that they begin reading Foucault's Pendulum (Umberto Eco), it's good for humility, begin this book, but do not finish it, i have a feeling that finishing it would only add to the ego.

some words i've had to look up so far:
-contretemps
-equitation
-tetrapyloctomy
-alembic
-archons
-archeopterix
-chassis

"event","ladies and gentlemen, i'd like to take this moment to welcome my live journal back to, well, life.

so a brief recap. for those of you not in the know, my brother was married last week, the wedding went very well, i cried, of course. i was over dressed for the rehersal dinner, but it was fine because it put me on the recieving end of some very satisfying reactions from my brothers best friends from college (their last memory of me having been a tom-boyish tween tagging along puppy worshiping  my brother). for the wedding i wore a whole bunch of pink (and a fantastic southern bell hat complete with feathers) and played cannon in d for the processional.

it managed to rain only during the transit time from the church to the conjoined back yards that held the reception. made it through 6 hours of that before going batty and stealing off with my dates (charlie and jenni) in tow.

bunch of random stuff for the next few days while i didn't work and therefore had no motivation for anything else...blah blah...

began my work week on tuesday. so far i've been up at six in the morning every day. Like the ever wonderful motastic it appears i am a morning person.

wednesday i fell on my knee (karmic debt, don't ask) and borrowed my rather foxy roomate's cane for pool (with said roomate and mo in addition to my usual partner in crime) and thursday's work shift.

my knee is now mostly better, just a bit sore...i have no doubt that when the bruise begins to show it'll be pretty.

ummmm.....ah yes, and i am poor but fashionable

two weeks from now i hope to be not as poor"

that's all there is to it!


so, the last couple days have been pretty good all things considered. On friday I paid bills and outstanding loans, and so i am poor. P-O-O-R, like quit smoking/crackers for dinner poor. but it's alright, because the toga party was fun (please note that all toga parties should have a bonfire AND a slave auction) my jenni loves me,nates still knows how to eat his stylish shoe laces and works been giving me hella hours.

also! i was a very good girl yeasterday and memorized 15 measures of pachabel for the wedding. May get the chance to practice some more today, but had some keys/money/phone forgetfulness that make that less of a likelyhood.

i feel all healthy though because i walked both to and from work (may have been better if i'd eaten anything today, but i'm working on it)

tomorrow i work 'til seven, then hopefully i'll have pool followed by practicing, crashing at mama's house, going home, working then my nephew's birthday on friday.....from there it just gets scary, welcome to my stores busiest time of year.

any one wanna come shoping with me on thursday?"

not only was it <i>irish</i> night.....But we won!!!!!!!!!!!!!

we were down by two from the fourth inning, then we'd inch up, and they'd pull ahead, but after the seventh inning streach, the players took the field and womped series booty.

also, there was a great tenor, from ireland, who had been in phantom of the opera on broadway this last run, he sang both the irish national anthem and the american, and also.....MUSIC OF THE NIGHT! *swoon*

it was good times....unfortunately due to Ham Solo i now have a horrid craving for pork chops, ah well."

Irony of the week:
     so, a woman comes into my store, i offer a greating, don't get a response, but hey, it's the end of the night, that's not really that unusual. later, i see her looking at something up on the wall, in the midst of offering to help her get it down, i realize she's deaf. this isn't the first time that this has happened and so i pull on my ever ready supply of hand gestures and we figure things out. she tries a few things on, and when she's ready to check out, i'm at the register. I ring her up, and as i'm trying to figure out exactly how to tell her what her total is, she hands me a SONY visa. maybe this doesn't tickle any body else, but i had a time with it."

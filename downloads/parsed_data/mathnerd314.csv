"event","I think I'm only doing this since <a href=""http://mathnerd314.livejournal.com/2015/01/01/"">last year's list</a> was so wildly...um...different from reality. But, what the heck. Definitely not resolutions. Not really goals. Just stuff I don't want to get lost in the pursuit of other stuff.
1. Host Chemgal again, or visit her (or both)
2. Crochet a tallis or a table-runner (depending on whether I'm ready to wear a tallis...). 
3. Perfect my giardiniera recipe
4. Take an improv class at the comedy theater Around! The! Corner!
5. See more plays, hear more live music
6. Find a yoga class, at least once in a while
7. Find people to run with (Literally)
8. Keep adding to the people I run with (Figuratively)
9. Make it through the full scroll on <a href=""http://tipplingthroughthetorah.wordpress.com/"">Tippling Through The Torah</a>
10. Visit Muse and the BoM and the New Girl 
11. Write a SAS paper

For giggles, an update on last year's list: 
1. Set up the guestroom, including buying a rolltop desk if I can find the right one. (Yeah. No. I bought an air conditioner. That's it.)
2. Hang up the gallery wall (Nope. But have some new ideas for that.)
3. Read a little Megillat Esther again. Maybe the same portion, maybe different. (I did, one verse in the community production.)
4. Crochet a rug for the sunroom. (nope. But I did crochet a kippah on a steel hook. And lots of other things, but the kippah was on the skills to learn list.)
5. Consider learning all of the Torah readings for Hanukkah (only applies if all 8 are as alike as the 4th, 5th, and 6th appear to be--I read the 4th this year and realized I could sightread the next two from the chumash). (Hahahahaha. I did read the new moon aliyah during Hanukkah, and I hope to get to do this for many Rosh Chodeshim to come.) 
6. Achieve some of the goals I have for my new leadership role (there's no way to do everything that needs to be done, which luckily everyone realizes) (some of them.)
7. PR in My Favorite Race (Nope. Mostly due to training lapses with the unexpected Shul Drama in First Months of New Job. But the first two miles of deluge didn't help.)
8. Re-learn how to turn while swimming laps, in pursuit of actually swimming laps (forgot this was a goal, even as I tried to relearn for the failed attempt at signing up for a triathlon)
9. Take a solo trip, no matter how short (Detroit? Memphis? Nashville? Austin?) (Whoops. Must re-start in 2016.)
10. Try new challah recipes (Vegan challah is now neighborhood canon.)
11. Experiment with lacework (I'm actually good at this!)
12. Keep on picklin' (And how.) 
Of course I also started a booze blog, basically joined a start-up, got back in the conference game...."

"event","I walked out, a few verses in to the Rosh Hashanah haftorah. (Dear Old-Line Urban Shul, why are we reading that in English, among all of our insane high-church affectations?) Penina mocks Chana for her childlessness, reduces her for her childlessness, tells her to keep her mouth shut during shul education discussions because of her childlessness--okay, maybe not that last one exactly but this Chana decided not to listen to it any more.     

(Also, don't go looking for answers about what happened next, between the two of them. You just can't reconcile it for yourself.)
   
So I walked out, and without guilt chatted until I was sure the reading had passed. And it was so lovely that I also found reason to slip out when the sermon was dull, or the essay by a congregant was insulting (an error in logic and an error in grammar rendered Reform Judaism the equivalent of Mussolini and Hitler, and a high percentage of my friends ""not Jewish""). 

It's not that I'm a stranger to running away, as we all know. But somehow I've finally learned to ask myself, ""why am I engaging in this?"" Sometimes there is a good fight worth fighting, but sometimes there's only a battle because you escalate a skirmish. 

I mean, not that I usually stop fighting, but I'm sometimes recognizing the futility in the fight. It feels like progress. It feels like a sort of freedom."

"event","The MusicNerd has been living here for the summer, along with the Canine Niece. Just during the week, really, as Muse is enrolled full-time at a school down the street (and two hours from her current place, during rush hour). I keep saying it's the first time I've had a roommate since college, and then I catch myself (Is it good or bad that I've completely erased a seven-year relationship from my personal history?). 

Obviously it is fantastic to have the world's most fantastic dog for the summer, and really have no responsibility for her. Obviously living with Muse is really nothing like having a random roommate. If I thought this would be less than okay, we wouldn't be doing it, but I've been surprised at just how pleasant it is to come home to someone I like hanging out with. (Bonus perk: I've completely shamed myself into giving up the bear-with-furniture habits I've picked up over the years. The dishes are done, the laundry is clean, there's some semblance of meals and the trash is taken out. There's fur all over the floor, but we sweep twice a day, I swear.) I'm sure this is all not quite as pleasant for Muse, who dislikes the city (but concedes that ""College Green sucks less than the rest of it"") and is living out of a suitcase in the weeks before moving to the Great North to rejoin the BoM. (We'll talk about that some other day), but it's basically pleasant and companionable.

So. I can be around other people, on a regular basis. And an interesting fact of life in College Green is that I am surrounded by people not unlike me; my friends have partnerships that support and sustain them, while maintaining full lives in which they are, separately, themselves. I've had few models of this.

The Neighbor Kids, for all their worry about my life choices (read: lunchbox contents), seem to have decided that I am in fact a responsible grownup (""Well, at dinnertime you're a kid, because you don't have to sit with your husband. But other times you're a really good grownup"") and mostly one whose reminders to get in line are worth heeding. Somehow I have learned to speak as College Green Grownups do, enforcing responsibility for one's actions and tolerance and kindness (would that the College Green Grownups remembered to treat one another that way), all while having the freedom and the body type to engage in wild physical play. 

""MathNerd is really good with kids,"" I overhear at a dinner party. I am surprised by this trust, even though there is one toddler on my back and another clinging to my right leg, both giggling. I am not supposed to be this person. 

Or so I was told. 

I made the right choices, then, or let the right choices happen to me might be more accurate. But I also allowed myself to be told...nay, to believe...that I couldn't be fully present with another person, that for the good of everyone around me, and everyone I might bring around me, I should stay separate.

I don't know that this changes anything. I don't know that I want it to. And maybe I'm wrong now and they were right all along and, in fact, I can't; certainly I know that, if I don't, it's all still quite good. 

But I think maybe I could. And I'm not sure what I'll do with that thought."

"event","I don't recognize this body.

I mean, it's fine. A little chubblier than I'd like, this time of year, but I'm behind on the running and the training and all of that for many good reasons. It wears suits well, and pretty dresses with coordinating jackets, these lovely clothes that are also unfamiliar but necessary in my fancy new life. It looks fine, and it more or less works, but the weight on my thighs and legs and bum is unfamiliar, and uncomfortable. I don't know how this body moves, it's not strong in the places I'm used to bearing weight. I'm slower than I used to be, lack of training and lack of motivation (and, oh, the exhaustion) but also just an inability to move in this. 

Marco will fix the hair soon, which is too long for good reasons (Shavuot followed by half-marathon) and that is fine. But Marco will also need to fix the strange-colored roots that I've never noticed before. Maybe it's just the scourge of fluorescent lighting. Maybe it's the need of a good shampoo. Or maybe it is, in fact, the last six months caught up to me.  

I say the thing I cannot reconcile myself to is the ear that is blocked and will never stop ringing, and at some level it is okay to be shaken off-balance by such a change. I'm left-eared now, lucky to have scored a desk with my bad ear toward the noise and my good ear toward the phone. Listening to recorded music is not the pleasure it once was; summer concert season is about to begin and I don't know if I'll have to adjust or how I will adjust. The hearing loss is minor, as is the pain, but at some level I've seized on this change as the one I'm allowed to rail against, focusing all this anger at this body that is not mine.

It's fine, this body, even lovely and certainly capable of doing the things it needs to do. It's just not one I recognize at mine, in a life I'm not sure I recognize as my own, and I don't know how to learn to live in it."

"event","I had a plan, to keep it all together and to get it all done. It was held together by a thread and I knew one more crisis would cause it all to fall apart. 

And I knew the crisis was coming. 

And then it did. And for some reason, of all the things that fell apart, it's the lack of running that makes me angry and crazy. Four weeks until my Favorite Race, and my 8.5 miles are slow and staggery. With the wind and the wet and the wind, I had to accept a few minutes standing alongside the trail, watching the lake pound against the shore. The jewel tones and the anger and the push-pull of the waves and the shore, the receding cold and the exhilaration and the immenseness and the immediacy of it all. And when I turned around, the wind was at my back, pushing me faster into the wet and the cold and the passion of those waves. 

I don't understand some of the choices I'm making, but I don't feel wrong about them. This is not what I want, but this is where I am, and right here-right now is so fiercely right.

I hope.

This year, in all its shattered glory."

One of the members of The Band once asked me what did motivate me, professionally, if money wasn't a strong inducement. It took me a minute to describe it in big-girl words. ""Earned respect. Loyalty. Opportunities to learn.""  

Fact: I am a sucker. It's just that I'm just a sucker for weird things."

"event","Actually, it started in January. (Actually, it started in October, but we don't need to delve into ancient history.) I had a hole in my ear, and somewhere in the ringing and the buzzing and the silence the Best Boss Ever announced that he was leaving, and they fired The Mentor, and something was very off in the reports concerning The New Ringleader. Also, I needed new running shoes and a new phone. Then the toilet started leaking, and I burst into tears. 

(Mind you, I knew why the toilet was leaking, and it was nothing a quart container couldn't deal with in the short-to-mid run. But there was a lot I couldn't deal with, and I needed to depend on my plumbing.)

I told ChemGal about these things, as I do, after returning from the frigid shopping trip for the phone and the shoes, and she replied back with love and support and her own stories (as she does), culminating in an inspiring yoga photo, on facebook, reminding me that I was in the right place. Of course, at the same moment, I was opening my work email, finding a quick note from the Best Boss Ever. ""Hey Math, hope things are going well, but you'd mentioned you might be interested in talking about [new company, which we shall call The Hospital]. Now's a good time to discuss, if you'd still like to have that conversation.""  ""You sure about that 'right place' business?"" I asked ChemGal, who knows when the universe is enjoying a cosmic joke.

We had that conversation, and damned if BBE did not have the exact kind of job I wanted, in discipline that I love, in a type of company that made a great deal of sense for a ten-year-plan I was beginning to flesh out. Oh, and in a building that was an acceptable commute* away. I decided that we should talk some more. Meanwhile, The New Ringleader had joined us. At least in theory. He had not yet spoken to any of us, or looked anyone in the eye. 

I called a plumber, and lo and behold the first appointment was the same day as I'd scheduled the phone interview. I took the day off to deal with the plumbing. The New Ringleader hadn't said anything yet, so I felt pretty secure that there would be no questions about this. Then The Mentor texted--the exiled gang was getting together for drinks that afternoon, and I should come out. I did. And while I tried to focus on being a friend and a sounding board for her, it also came to pass that she knew about BBE's plans**, and she and Former Awesome-Enough Boss encouraged me to actively re-imagine my future, to seek out whatever it was I wanted. And I walked away that night knowing that they all believed in me. And the next day, The New Ringleader tried to address The Band, and failed miserably, and I rage-shopped for new suits for the interview with BBE, and any other interview I could get. They are amazing suits. I was afraid to buy them, but I remembered that Mentor believed in me, and BBE believed in me, and FA-EB believed in me. And also that I looked fucking amazing.

That next morning, I had a talk with myself; under what circumstances would I take a pay cut, what did I truly make now, and what did I really need to keep going. And then I was right about the plumbing issue, which was easily resolved, and the phone interview went beautifully. Then it snowed 20 inches in a single day; it was February.

And right after my disastrous ""introduction"" to The New Ringleader, within minutes I mean, I left the office for an afternoon at The Hospital. Everyone was used to me wearing fancy suits for meetings, and for leaving the office to take those meetings. I suppose I could have gotten away without taking the time off, if I'd felt like being sneaky. But I wanted to remain the sort of person they all believed in. The sidewalks were clear enough for high-heeled boots. The interview was good, and I left in a freak snowstorm, on my way to a crazy-awesome volunteer event with a wacky crowd from College Green. (I changed clothes in the bathroom of a coffee shop.) 

There were bits of drama along the way but it was always clear that BBE and I wanted the same outcome, and fast. One day, I had to approach First Boss and ask for a recommendation. He said all the right things, and as always was too honest, and so I remembered that First Boss believed in me, too, and always had, and that was why all this was possible. As things got more awful with The New Ringleader, I would chant that under my breath: the Mentor believed in me and First Boss believed in me and FA-EB believed in me and BBE did, too. I could do this. They all had my back. And The Band had each other's backs, as we always have, banding together to survive the insanity that has so nearly consumed us. Do not discount The Band in this story, though they never knew what I was doing and how I needed them every step of the way.

Eventually BBE and I got what we wanted (I got more than I wanted, as a matter of fact, and I'm more than a little surprised at that). The Band reacted to my news with universal delight, of the sort you expect from your friends but are warmed and sustained by nonetheless. And I have a strange little mantra of support, and that is how I lived through February. 

*OK, in theory I hop on a bus three blocks away, and exit said bus in front of the building. In reality, I do not think I can trust rush hour traffic. But with a 4-6 block walk, I have a very nice commute, which will be pleasant in good weather. 
**There are hints that this was Mentor's idea; certainly she encouraged the idea (she and BBE were ""work spouses""). She will never tell, I will never know, but I do love the thought."

"event","In a moment of intense holiday-shopping fail (combined with December over-scheduling dilemmas), I announced, ""FINE. Everyone who is impossible to shop for is getting a damn book."" 

It occurred to me that the DadNerd was probably totally cool with this, but neither of the GrandNerds so punished was known to really read much, or anyway read much that I was willing to buy. But let us recap: 
1. I don't care. One set of GrandNerds does not buy gifts, the other GrandNerd does not seem to enjoy receiving them. 
2. One set of GrandNerds is appreciative of grocery gift cards, and honestly does kind of need the help. But I am fully okay with helping outside of holiday gifts. The other GrandNerd does not need financial help and proudly showed me his two-year-old Applebee's giftcard (which, yes, could be interpreted as an asshole move). 

In a stroke of genius, I did search cafepress and found a t-shirt ""from"" an important site in the DadNerd's favorite scifi series. No new books in that series, alas, but I made a trip to the Famous Museum and found a Nerd Hacks book that I thought might serve up an amusing project or two. I scoured Amazon for 1)A book about one GrandNerd's ancestral hometown and 2) a coffee-table type book about a certain type of car that the other GrandNerd had once amateur raced. (Yeah, I should have shopped locally, but would have struck out on book #1 for sure. Also, the only bookstores with such wares in CollegeGreen are secondhand, which would have disturbed both.) I couldn't quite find a picture-rich book about the specific cars I wanted (I've never seen said GrandNerd read more than glorified advertising copy), so settled for a more general tome about the heyday of hot rods. Whatever. Done. (and, in large part, shipped to the NerdRents' house). 

In the past four days, the DadNerd has not shut up about dozens of the 200+ projects in his <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Big-Book-Hacks-Amazing-Projects/dp/1616283998/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1419798546&sr=8-1&keywords=big+book+of+hacks'> book</a>. (He's getting quite serious about building a rock-climbing wall on the garage. Sorry, MomNerd, but I bet he'll make you those pill-bottle sparklers, too.)  I actually feel a little guilty about this one, as Muse and the BoM got him an awesome toy that he has not opened (they did forget the batteries, but DadNerd could have grabbed some at work on Friday). 

GrandNerd opened his hometown history right before an unexpected hiatus in gift-opening, and did not bitch during the 15 minute wait while he thumbed through the text and identified pictures (side bonus--the other half of these GrandNerds has always claimed she was hidden in the grease pit of a garage while gangsters raged through the town. No one believes this story...but the history book clearly chronicles an incident with appropriate dates and includes mention of a garage where GreatGrandNerd was known to work. Different gangsters than she claimed, but still notorious...this really may have happened). Win for the whole family!

We don't have a structured gift-giving time with the other GrandNerd, so I slipped over to give him his present while most of the others were distracted. As I handed it too him, he responded with a very grumpy-sounding, ""It feels like a BOOK."" I bit my tongue, because seriously? When he finally managed the paper, he remembered his manners: ""Well, hey! The Art of the Hot Rod!"" Blessedly, he opened the book and found of picture of a finely restored 30-something something-or-other ""That's almost like the '36 something-else I had!"" ""When did you drive that?"" That followed with a story about the time he was kicked out of a stock-car race for being underage...and we flipped through the whole book together, interspersed with some stories about the 1950's small town race circuit and a couple of slams on some great-uncles. I'm pretty sure we've never had a conversation that long, or that positive. When we'd finally exhausted the pictures (and he'd noted, with glee, several of the restorers named in essays accompanying the photos--""I guess I'll be able to turn off the teevee and read something for a change!""), he forced the BoM and several uncles to page through the highlights (yet another reason for uncle Judgypants to be annoyed with me, but whatevs). 

I'm sure there's a powerful lesson in here about accepting good enough, and reaping the rewards. I'm happy just to remember this as the holiday I actually talked to all of the GrandNerds...and the one where I learned how to reduce my travel weight, by shipping the gifts!"

Begin with <a href=http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2014/07/easiest-fridge-dill-pickles/>this recipe</a>. Recall that the vinegar will not cover the veg slices. Because any thinly sliced vegetable is fantastic in this recipe, and also green or yellow or purple beans. 

-Do actually get the pickling cucumbers at the farmer's market
-you can totally make these in quart ziplocs, if you're taking them to someone's house, because no one else understands that glass jars are sacred.
-Add garlic to the above recipe. And also a little honey because it's kind of harsh. And use about half of the salt because other people thought it was overboard, too. Use big flowers of dill when you can get them, in addition to chopped, because pretty. 
-Radishes would be fantastic. Try that next year.
-to one of the jars, add hot pepper flakes and cracked black pepper
-Green or Yellow or Purple beans with onion, red pepper, and garlic
-Yellow squash, green beans, red pepper, garlic
-zucchini with garlic and slices of hot pepper
-Beets with garlic chives and fresh oregano
-Beet with oregano and onion and thyme. And garlic. Use more honey.
-Kohlrabi with chives and sage and a lot of garlic and some thinly sliced white onion.
-At Pesach, beg someone who owes you favors to pick up bottles of as many kinds of kosher vinegar as possible. (There are several such people, at least inasmuch as grabbing a few things that you'll pay them back for or even front them cash for is concerned.) Although you can do a lot with Heinz and a little honey and some onion and garlic powder.
-If you come into a bounty of scapes again, make a jar of just scape pickles
-You also wanted to try jalapenos. Add garlic. 


Also, call Mom for the red onion, garlic, olive oil, fancy vinegar  and salt pickle that goes on the watermelon-avocado salad."

"event","I had groceries delivered yesterday. And it was beautiful, not waiting for a bus on perhaps not the safest corner all loaded down with too much stuff, not hauling the groceries the blocks to the bus and from the bus, being able to just buy stuff without that weird calculus of how many cans and how much bulk and oh, crap, eggs. I only ordered heavy things and bulky things and breaky things and leaky things (and a few indulgent things which were all out of stock or just too weird for the shopper, I suppose), and they were all carried to my door and now I have enough to last several weeks (all hail free delivery!), assuming I buy produce around the corner and make just one run for yogurt and almond milk and dried frust. 

There's something that's not working out with my time, of late. My commutes are shorter, and fewer; the gym is not daily (which is another thing that's not working); and yet it seems like there's never enough time. A look at the calendar makes it all clear, of course; there's the board and the craft circle and the faraway minyan and the evenings with friends. But that still doesn't answer why I struggle to wake up at the pre-ass-crack of dawn, and why I'm not tired late into the night (okay, the latter is a lifelong condition, but the first one is a new and disturbing development). 

I tried to make myself find a housecleaner, because that is supposedly the answer to all issues. But a housecleaner won't put my clothes in the hamper or put the books back on the shelf or wash my dishes (well, not all the time) and anyway I can do all of that in the wee hours of the night. It's the groceries, the big staples of which need to be bought in full daylight and can only be purchased in the quantities I can carry, that were complicating the schedule. (Also the cold. Housework, lord love my radiators, is very not cold.) And yet I feel odd about this decision in a way I don't feel strange about a housecleaner, in a way that I think is beyond giving up the agency of selecting my food. It seems to be the feel of having the wrong answer work better than the right one, and I'm not okay with that line of thought."

"event","So today I got outed as the freak with no plans for Thanksgiving. 

And by no plans, I do mean no plans. I could have gone back to the 'Burg, of course, but none of the Cousins of Awesomeness will be around (and it's not clear that Muse and the BoM were ever planning to, either) and car troubles have stranded R in the Western Gateway (and, fine, I am that horrible person who's unwilling to travel on the craziest Amtrak day of the year to see a bunch of relatives that I don't really grok) (I am such a terrible person). At one point, I started counting my options...I could have proposed a Friendsgiving here (kosher vegetarian Thanksgiving? Even I think that sounds disastrous), and I stopped counting after five families I could have horned in on, and three sets of friends who would have taken me as their perky third wheel. (My personal favorite, ""The Other Kind of Indian"" with Muse and the BoM, is off the table since he has parents and all.) And I knew I was cool with my decision to abstain.

I briefly considered a pair of friends who are so not American, and thought of suggesting that we pack up to the Other Side and go out for Indian, as an in-joke. But I've promised to attend the College Green Interfaith Love-In and Protest Song Drum Circle with Optional Interpretative Dance (I exaggerate slightly), and I hate scheduling complications. And...well...I'm not quite ready for Thanksgiving.

I should like Thanksgiving. I do like Thanksgiving, in concept. Yaaay 'Murica and all of that, and of course it's the one holiday I can celebrate with anyone, without guilt. It's about making too much food, which is one of my favorite things ever, and socially acceptable to have as many desserts as guests (well, not unacceptable, anyway). But Thanksgiving was important a long time ago, in my old life, only it never turned out the way anyone wanted it to. And that got angry and that got blaming and that somehow seemed to become my fault because I'd grown up differently and trashily (or because I'd immersed others in it, as in <a href=http://mathnerd314.livejournal.com/2007/11/25/>this incident</a>). And then there was a second family outing on Friday night, and an angry brunch on Sunday morning...and I hate that this still gets to me, but there you go*. 

(I had what I hope will be my last migraine ever in the aftermath of one of those Thanksgivings. I am thankful every day that I'm not reliving that.) 

I've starting going home at Christmastime, thanks to the cousin presence, and I can generally enjoy it. I've catapulted myself into the Best.Pesachs.Ever. But I still can't even at New Year's, and Thanksgiving still makes me nervous. Last year I did a three-way lie to cover my tracks (sorry, JQ. Or did I not lie to you and just tell my sister that I was going to be at your house?), but now I live where I know people and it's too likely I'd get caught. If I was invited somewhere, I decided to accept, but I wasn't going to seek an invitation. 

So when the aforementioned friends asked me when I was leaving for my Thanksgiving cooking extravaganza (they'd mixed it up with my Passover Exodus), I corrected them and admitted to my lack of plans. ""Oh no!"" they replied, ""we were going to ask you over but thought you would be in Philadelphia!"" And in my absence they'd accepted plans with a second set of mutual friends, where I will also be welcomed. And if that's how it works out, that's fine with me...at least four children will be overjoyed to have their chief piggyback-rider in residence, and I bet they'll let me make the <a href=http://mathnerd314.livejournal.com/2005/11/24/>MomNerd's pies</a>, which I think can be done in pareve margarine. But a tiny bit of me wishes I'd been strong enough to say, ""I'm going to College Green Interfaith Love-In and Protest Song Drum Circle with Optional Interpretative Dance, then heading home to wrap up in a blanket and drink moonshine while watching a marathon of Thanksgiving episodes of Roseanne."" 

*(Unrelated. I taught a friend's tween to play Scrabble a few weeks ago, in the process accidentally creating my perfect opponent--we both value a good joke over a good score, and will chatter obnoxiously about the [often quasi-dirty] words we could have created if only' we'd had this one letter. I put out the list of 2 letter words and words containing X, Q, and Z, because I didn't think it fair that a newbie had to compete with my memorization. When he asked, I didn't know how to tell a twelve-year-old that I forced myself to get competitive at Scrabble in a hurry because it was the only thing my ex-out-laws enjoyed and didn't fight about. Mostly because I'd never quite realized that motivation myself.)"

I have stock answers that I pick from (community, simplicity, the similarity to the People's Republic, the pink Queen Anne duplex across the street) and they are true and they usually satisfy. 

But it's more complicated than that. I get off the train in College Green and after a few steps I can feel myself begin to relax, no matter what has happened (and, believe me, it's been a month where much has transpired). I still smile when I remember that, oh yeah, I live here. And of course I can feel that way because College Green is magic, but I also know that, for now at least, College Green is the place where bad things haven't happened.* 

That is not a thing we say, and that is not a thing that lasts forever. I try, in so many things that I do, to make College Green a place that will support me when the bad things come, and to support those in College Green who are facing the bad. But I will not know if that is enough until things are bad, and of course that requires that the going get tough.

"event","There's a Torah portion, that happened a few weeks ago, that basically consists of the HOBBH telling the Jews, ""these are all the ways I can screw you over. Don't f it up."" And by all the ways, I mean columns and columns of really awful crap. You sorta begin to wonder why we'd put our trust in someone with such an evil imagination, and it's tedious to listen to even if your Hebrew is terrible. I'd like to pretend that this makes us empathetic to those who are beaten down and get smacked down again, every time they try to get up...but you've probably listened to five minutes of international news this summer and yeah, not really a Jewish emotion. 

Anyway. So, every week, members of the community come forward, read blessings over the Torah, and then stand as the reader chants the portion or maybe sometimes chant it themselves (in some communities it is considered tacky to mix these responsibilities, which might embarrass those who do not have the skills to read. In some communities, there are not enough adults to separate the tasks. And, in some communities, people don't overanalyze every action). It's also traditional to end each portion with a positive statement.  So, if there are two-and-a-half columns of unrelenting curses, someone stands there for two-and-a-half columns. Someone takes those curses on behalf of the community. 

Yeah, that's right. Someone just stands there and takes vitriol (in this case being read by a tiny, steely, 70-something total badass). Traditionally, that person should be a leader in the community, publicly generally well-behaved, and not embroiled in any immediately obvious sadnesses (lest anyone interpret the curses as deserved for indiscretion, or causing further hurt, and of course said person needs to be able to weather any troubles acquired from said experience). In College Green, we also consider how that person needs to be able to stand unassisted for a length of time, to have the upper body strength to roll the Torah as the columns pass, and ideally understand Torah reading well enough to know when those column rolls should come. (Oh, and be able to remain on the bimah, without needing to attend to children, for several minutes.) It's not the biggest intersection in our little Venn diagram, but I was still surprised to find myself called up for (as said badass Torah reader noted, while I was reciting the blessings) ""the Big Curse."" 

It's an honor, I was reminded afterward, and I understand it as such. It's not really so unpleasant when one is able-bodied and gets a kick out of rolling the scroll, especially when one it is a beginning Torah reader who can learn from the repetitive language of the curses. And of course you get to ruminate on what it feels like to be constantly cut down and mistrusted by authority, though probably I'm the only person who thinks about that during Torah readings. 

But it really makes you think a lot of thought when that steely badass, whose life has put her through several circles of modern-female hell (and whose life, you recently have come to appreciate, might have closely approximated your life had you been born a generation earlier), when this woman you admire and frankly hope to become at least a faint shadow of says to you, alongside the reminder of the honor of taking the curses, ""Oh, it's a good thing you're strong."" 

(Yeah, okay, she at least three-quarters meant, ""Because I cannot roll the Torah scroll myself, since it weighs more than I do and oh yeah, I'm busy freaking READING all of those words."" Still.)"

2a. Politely but firmly insisted that I knew the basis of my plumbing problem, and refused to budge until said plumber investigated the situation. (I was right, and the root cause was purely bizarre.)

Comic book store guy moves in with Leonard and/or takes over Penny's apartment when Penny moves in with Leonard. Every episode contains a moment when you want to kick him in the nuts.

Leonard dates someone ridiculous. (Oh, if only this meant Sara Gilbert would show back up!)

Season 10: If wedding in season 9, Amy gets pregnant on wedding night. (See Season 7 of Gilmore Girls, Lane and Zack, to complete story.) Else, Shamy wedding.

Or rather, I do ruminate, but I do it while jogging double-digit numbers of miles and so do not write it down. 

But recent circumstances may have lead me to realize this: I'm not comfortable, and indeed occasionally somewhat hostile, in Modern Orthodox worship, possibly in part because Orthodox Judaism does not have to recognize my identity as a Jew. (I accept this, and understand the measures I could take to change that. Someday I should talk about why I have not made that choice.) But I am generally socially very comfortable in what my friend ThePrideOfCollegeGreen calls ""Orthodox Feminist Circles."" I am entirely in my element in a modern but tradition-hewing Conservative service (read: no instruments, lots of Sephardi melodies, no hugging of the neighbor, full Torah reading every week) but often lonely in any social situation designed for those who identify as Conservative Jews. 

I don't know what to do with this knowledge. I don't even know if I've identified the pattern. But I do wonder.

It shouldn't kill me this much, because it's a stupid past-its-prime TV show dealing with the fallout of a totally unbelievable plot twist. It's not really about the number of brilliant scientists of deep religious faith who I know and admire and respect, or the number of brilliant scientists who have none of that faith or a simpler version of that faith. It's not the part where seriously, a hospital called Seattle fucking GRACE is totally at some level a faith-related institution, so I really don't get how there is exactly one Christian in the entire place. 

It is entirely because, once again, a show about educated people totally assumes that the only normative and accepted lifestyle is an upper-middle-class standard where physical labor is outsourced, small expenditures are not tabulated, and the money just magically works. And while I will concede that apparently is normal and I am apparently ass-backward, I will never get it and I cannot get past how April not getting it is worth one five second exchange where she is told to revel in her shame with leftover lasagna, and we are all supposed to recognize her shaming and pity her for the shaming and her simple farm upbringing, rather than respect her for not piddling away someone else's trust fund. 

Also, leftover lasagna is fucking delicious and should not be associated with shame. And this is why I need to start reviewing Roseanne.

Dear Chemgal [actually, I forgot a salutation],

So I was out at Crossdressing* Diner's Drag Queen Bingo with the girls last night (The New Girl's last night at bingo...yes, my primary Bad Idea Friend is moving to the Frozen North and I'm trying not to dwell on it...) and it comes up that Grunger has lately been reminiscing about forking lawns**, and The New Girl has never done that. And we're all like, ""What the fork is up with you?"" and ""it's so forking hilarious,we can't even forking explain."" I tried to convince all assembled to see if the liquor store accross the street had plastic forks, so we could fork the median that forking instant. (And, no, not more than one drink had been consumed apiece.) They were all, no,it's late, but we totally will soon, even though I personally thought that, for forkssake, we should take care of this gigantic forking hole in The New Girl's life experience. I'm like, ""Y'all can just fork off"" and then we went home.
 
Which was all hilarious.
 
Then today, I'm sitting in my cube, talking to my neighbor (who's also leaving at the end of the week, also sad) and some random that I've never seen before comes over to his desk and is all ""what's up buddy yadda yadda."" And then he's like ""I'm just looking for a fork, they didn't send enough to our lunch meeting."" What the fork is that? Like anyone on this floor gives a fork. I mean, forking get over yourself, it's not a big forking deal if you have to use a spoon to eat some forking pasta.
 
So. What the fork is up with you?

Love, Math

Dear MathNerd [huh, she also forgot a salutation],

As usual, we are living a permutation of the same forking life.

This morning, I went up to ChemGuy's office to ask him a couple of forking questions, one of which was for this forking poster I'm making for him to use to recruit prospective chemistry graduate students at their visit this forking weekend.  As I was walking through his office door to leave (it's around a corner from where his forking desk is positioned), I called out ""OK! Thanks, Guy!"" and continued walking, to which I heard him reply ""Fork YOU, Gal!"" with very cheerful expression.  I turned around and went back in and explained I had heard an upbeat ""Fork YOU!"" and if that's how he forking felt about it, then he could take his forking poster and fork it up himself because I was forking done with it.  I don't forking get paid enough to have to tolerate that and if anyone forking needed me, I'd be on my yoga mat.

He was all ""Um, I said ""THANK YOU, Gal""  I don't have time to make a new poster this year.  But I guess people hear what they want......so. fine. FORK YOU!""

No. No one else was in ear-shot of said exchange. Everyone else keeps their doors closed because the forking undergrads can't read room numbers and just walk in anywhere and everywhere.  I had two guys follow me into the bathroom this morning.  Looking for their classroom.  The semester began 5 weeks ago...I believe the children are our future.

Love, Gal

But I'm supposed to say yes. I promised myself. Also, I'm supposed to move to College Green, and don't I want to meet the neighbors who like to chant esoteric Hebrew texts? Who are at least Jewish chicks for sure, and might maybe be near my age and single? Plus maybe I should think about how J (who was in my trope class) might be reaching out for a little support, and I'd be a crappy friend if I wasn't there for her.

I don't know if I can do this well. I don't know how much I can do. But, what the hell. Purim's a holiday about risk, if you read it right. Might as well get into the spirit of the thing."

So I switched over to <a href=http://www.songwords.net/waiguo/darwilliams/007.htm>""Iowa""</a>, which is of course perfectly suited to my voice. Not that anyone is surprised. 

<i>So, in googling for the links, I learned that: 
1.""February"" is followed by ""Iowa"" on <u>Mortal City</u>
2. I have never heard the definite article in the first verse of ""February,"" which changes the meaning quite a bit.
3. ""Iowa"" is about bisexuality.

"event","I was wrong about a lot of things that happen in real jobs. Some of them make me cringe (bullet points rather than complete sentences), some of them make me chortle with glee (in fact, only losers put clip art on PowerPoints). I thought an annual review, face-to-face, sounded like a very stressful thing, and indeed I have friends who put on their best suits and prepare their talking points...but this is my third review, and it's the first one I've had more than five minutes' warning for (actually, the first one happened in a three-minute call on my cell phone, while crouched in the corridor of our Southern State office. Old Boss had been delinquent in performing reviews, and had to turn them in by 5, even though WB and I had been shipped off to do Very Important Work at a Not Insignificant Price). 

So I have no idea how to plan for these things, I've never been rewarded for planning for these things, and I have no model for how they're ""supposed"" to be, anyway. But I'll end up with...more than 20 hours, I think, to prepare for this one, and part of me wants to say one of those things that I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to say in a real job:

""So, parts of this really are not working out. And some of it is you.""

Part of it is my talent for cheerfully diving into shitstorms. And I'm good at shitstorms, and in a weird way like the challenge of dodging the...wow, I wish I'd chosen a different crude metaphor. Also, there's been a fan of late and there's...well, you know...and it's just one of those things that's happening that...well, you know...is hitting the fan. And it's not even our fan, really. And that fan is taking up a lot time (but not from me, I have very little fan engagement). 

I can live with all of that. The problem with fans is, they make people all blustery. Their words get all blown around and mixed up and they don't add up to anything. The problem with shitstorms is that the bystanders get covered in poo, and the problem with training a fan on a shitstorm is, when you're maybe trying not to ruffle feathers in one direction, you're maybe not bothering to notice that you're letting your shit blow all over someone else. (And if you are noticing, then you're an asshole.)

I can't talk about shit. But I'm wondering if maybe I should note that I don't need to be left adrift in this storm (especially since, being me and all, I have a few ideas about moorings and harbors and things of that nature). I'm pretty sure it's safest to keep my mouth shut, but maybe that's one of those real-job things I'm wrong about. Maybe I'll risk it."

"event","The local rag runs a financial columnist that I usually more-or-less agree with. I was pleased to see a tag on the front page touting his latest column, I think phrased as ""savings resolutions for a new year."" I chucked aside sports, arts, and two sections of baldly sentimental human-interest stories (Even using my definition of news, rather than Mr. Busse's*, there is very little news in the Sunday Local Rag these days), and opened up Money and Real Estate. 

Bullet point two actually made me gasp. ""Money is for spending, not saving. If you don't have a savings goal, spend the money."" 

NO. Noooo. Nononononononono.

Do I need to explain how wrong this is? I did read the text under the bullet point; the point was not ""If your life is truly uncomfortable and would be improved by spending income you normally squirrel away, spend the money."" The point was not ""Don't feel guilty about the money you spend on indulgence that completely fits within your healthy-savings-percentage budget."" No, the point was, ""once you hit your savings goal, blow the rest."" 

(By the way, I would suggest an attitude adjustment to address part one--unless we're talking about something like needing a winter coat or whatever, and regular recalibrations of the budget to address point two. If it doesn't continue pass the <a href=""http://lesleyscorgie.com/blog/2006/02/review-the-complete-tightwad-gazette-by-amy-dacyczyn/"">Wow Test</a>, would it be better to have the money waiting when you find something that Wows you over? And if you have the money and it passes the Wow Test, what's the problem?)

The bullet suggested that you think of saving as planning for future spending. That's not a bad idea if you need a tangible way of thinking about a long-term goal, but I suspect it's horrible for the type of person who thinks, ""Oh, how will a latte really matter in the scheme of my down payment?"" That $2 prepay really doesn't matter all that much once you have the money saved, but the mindset of considering each latte is the only way most people I know will ever have any chance of achieving their large financial dreams.

I don't have a savings goal right now, in a traditional sense. I have my down payment saved, plus closing costs and moving expenses and a small sum for cosmetic renovations if I so choose (I expect to pay about 250K for a condo that meets my modest desires in College Green. Do the math if you want). Everything else fits very comfortably within my take-home pay (after 401K, transit pass, insurance and all the rest). You might be surprised to know that I have a near-daily coffee habit, which I split between a short walk to goof off with assorted co-workers and sometimes meeting with folks from fancier departments that need an informal chat-up. I usually buy the $1 black coffee (buy 10, get any coffee drink you want free!) because it's the coffee date that meets my Wow test, not the drink itself (since I hate milk, I'm actually not a latte fan). According to guru guy, I should give in to pressure to go to the expensive place on a whim and get bigger fancier drinks? Or maybe quit buying secondhand clothes and buy identical stuff off the rack? 

(OK, yes, I could give more to charity. That wasn't the guru's advice, either. It wasn't even in his thought process. I would have accepted an argument that, if you have more than you need, give the rest away. )

The financial guru's advice is right inasmuch as I don't beat myself up over $250 worth of coffee per year (the connections alone are worth it), which would have been a dangerous indulgence back when I had almost no savings and a subsistence grad-student job (and a twice a week, 50 cent coffee habit that was worth it, too). I could also accept the advice to give up the economies you don't enjoy (though I would still recommend the Wow test, because even luxuries that don't mean that much to you are missed more once you're used to them, and it could happen that you'll need to economize again). But I'm honestly frightened at the suggestion that saving because you've spent to the point of saiety is a poor choice. What exactly are you losing if you stop when you have what you need and what you want? 

One upside: the article has me thinking about my spending, again, which I haven't done since finding myself in a job that pays far more than I need to get by. I'm lucky in that frivolities that truly enrich my life aren't jeopardizing my goals (or, heck, my livelihood) but I absolutely want to be the sort of person who thinks that waste is despicable. So, coffee jaunt with New Dude yes; bad beer at Happy Hour no (good beer at Happy Hour hellz yes, but I think you're getting the picture). I would like to send more to charities this year, and perhaps I'll try to think of my re-Wow-itizing my spending as a budget for increased giving.


*I was forever in trouble in freshman Civics class, because I insisted that scientific developments qualified as ""news."" (Though we agreed that true crime was not news.) I now realize he wanted us to report on politics...but frankly think he, as a Civics teacher, should have been able to elucidate that."

I'm still here, and I don't know why. Or, well, I do know why, what with two actuarial exams in the month before my lease was up, but now that I think of it, it's funny that I never at any point looked for a community in the place where I, y'know, reside.

I'm terrified to leave, but there's no reason to stay. (Except this apartment. I really have a great apartment. I hate giving up this apartment.)  The other day, in the midst of one of the great Facebook goof-offs of my life, someone suggested, ""Hey, let's all move to [College Green] and make [ridiculous things] happen."" We all liked it. We wouldn't all do it, but it was fun to imagine for a moment. I have a lot of little daydreams that take place in College Green; maybe I don't fantasize about the HipHood because I know it too well, but I've never found much scope for imagination here. I'm starting to feel stuck here. It's time to move on, before I get bogged down.

"event","All right, I've cooled off enough to talk about <a href=http://ejewishphilanthropy.com/jewish-attrition-and-the-final-frontier-of-jewish-communal-acceptance/>""that article""</a>. (See my last post for commentary from sunflowerakb and chemgal)

Kidding. I'm kidding. It's just that I've had a Torah portion to practice, and latkes to fry, and a shul board meeting to attend, and a really awkward service (where one of the most open-minded sweet old Jewish men I know stumbled into the ""but you don't look Jewish!"" hole with an acquaintance sitting next to me, and I couldn't pull either one of them out) followed by a really awkward lunch with a completely separate crowd (""It's cool. Toddlers amuse me."" ""Oh, so you have kids of your own!"" ""Nope."" ""So you're looking forward to it."" ""Not gonna happen.""*) that was nevertheless wonderful because of multiple great intellectual conversations with friends who are not at my life stage. I mean, I've also worked and gone to the dentist and gone home for Thanksgiving and run dozens of miles and dumped a clinger for the THIRD frickin' time in five weeks. (Not Jewish. Don't be as rude as the commenters on that article, mmmmkay?) And since I feel some assholishness coming on, I'll summarize: I've been busy being. Which includes being Jewish quite a bit and also includes being me. 

There aren't Jews like me. There just aren't. I mean, okay, there's a few, and there's a few even more out there than me. I have mad crushes on a couple of those, wish a couple more would move to Jerusalem in those people's places, and see a couple more on my Facebook feed but can't seem to make the friendship connection in real life. I don't think there are enough of us to fill a happy hour, much less a congregation. People usually partner off. Partnered people** usually have children, eventually, as do some people who don't partner permanently. It's statistics. It's weird, if by weird you mean ""a deviation or two away from the norm."" 

Look, I don't love it. I'd kill to have a few single Jewish girlfriends near my age. (Dang. I can count on one hand the number of single, non-partnered, near-my-age, Jewish men I know socially. I'm not sure I can think of a woman.) But I know plenty of people who were Jews kind of like me, once (they usually were married and knocked up by my age, but that didn't really kill their essential self). They're not always like me but what's so great about me, exactly? I spend a lot of time with me, it gets a little dull.

I know I'm missing the point. Yeah, I'd like to go an event for grown-ups only that wasn't an event for senior citizens. I'd like to go to a community event where it felt like adults were genuinely engaged in learning and conversation (oh, wait, every once in a while I get that in my community). And, this weekend non-withstanding, most of the time I don't hear too many questions about the choices I've made. The freeze-outs from the women my age hurt, but I'm surprisingly welcome at a table full of women with tween- and teen- age children and a penchant for studying Torah...and at a table of 60-something doctors who like to talk American politics...and at a table full of the Midwestern Harvard Hillel students, who can goof on almost anything (and those goofs very nearly go over my head).

I've already had to learn the lesson that sometimes, Jews will be jackasses, just because you don't quite fit the first version of the mold. I don't wish that lesson on anyone (and I know the version I've learned is far milder than most). It would be nice to take my place in the community for granted, to slip in easily and know which table I belonged at...but it might also be a little bit boring. I think maybe. In the slightly paraphrased word of Kermit the Frog: 

<i>When [the wacky blonde girl who forgot to get married] is all there is to be
It could make you wonder why
But why wonder why wonder
I am [more than a little bit odd], and it'll do fine
It's beautiful, and I think it's what I want to be </i>

*At least I remembered just in time not to announce ""That ship has pretty much sailed"" to a clearly late-forties mother of a toddler. 
**Congratulations to my birth state on making my tortured language less necessary, but of course I'm waiting for the day when no one can marry legally."

"event","I'm catching up on Grey's Anatomy right now, despite being home on Thursday night*. I'd planned on madly cleaning the house and baking in advance of a NerdFamily deluge. The phone has been ringing every night with calls from the College Alumni Phoneathon, which I ignore because, hello, I give faithfully every May. This time I checked when the phone rang; the number was Metropolan, and vaguely familiar. I muted Dr. Torres and took the call.

It was my Torah teacher, a pillar of the Old-Line part of the Old Line Urban Shul. We're both on...shall we call it a committee?...which is currently wrestling with an interesting coincidence of events. (Wait, you probably know about this. We need a new rabbi and American Judaism needs a new direction.**) She wanted to know where I stood on a particular issue, and we had an interesting discussion for about fifteen minutes. Throughout the discussion, you could hear both of us selecting our language carefully, trying to get at just what we found uncomfortable and what we found absolutely objectionable. Our answers weren't the same (though there was overlap) and I think we both came away understanding the situation a little better; we both have a better sense about what parts of our reactions are about our community, and what parts are about ourselves. 

""Thank you for calling,"" I said as we hung up. And then it hit me how much I meant it.

I know I was likely part of a poll and possibly was hoped to offer a little partisanship; I'm not sure I'll like the mixed reactions I'll get to the stand I will likely take (I'll be allied more closely with the likes of Torah Teacher than my generational cohort...otherwise known as the Smug Married Parents). I'm not sure I'll handle it well. But I'll also know that there are people who reach out to me as a member of a community, of this community that I do care about, and who think I might know something about this community and have something to give to it. I'm grateful that someone took a moment to make that clear, whatever other motives came with it. 

We live in interesting times at the OLUS, and I'm thankful to be part of what's making it interesting. I mean...yeah, I'm part of it. Some of it. In my own odd little way.

"event","Back when I met <a href= >Danny Colcannon</a>, I'm pretty sure he leaned over to my friend J and asked some version of, ""who the hell is she?"" (I paraphrase.) I didn't hear the beginning of J's response (so I'm only 50% sure it was about me), but it ended with ""and she's so sweet."" In the event I was actually being spoken of, it marks the first time that phrase has ever been used to describe me...but not the last. And yet I still assume I am immediately perceived as standoffish and cold, inarticulate and aloof (and, oh yeah, a very sloppy dresser who really ought to cut and color her hair just like...wait, I never bought that last part). 

Okay, fine. Maybe I'm more comfortable with 'standoffish bitch' than 'sweet.' I mean, I'm smart, not sweet (well, I'm maybe not so exceptionally smart by College Green standards). And there we have it. Being part of a community means I have to accept that other people will define me. I don't have to accept their definitions, and their definitions might not be right, but those definitions reflect my place in our shared world. The ghosts of the <a href=http://mathnerd314.livejournal.com/316932.html>slights we remember</a> shouldn't always stand in the way of being who I want to be, or at least two parts who I want to be mixed with one part someone who's pleasant and useful and good to have around.

A colleague called me the ""Style Icon of [the Nerd Herd]"" last week. I don't think it's true but I don't mind being thought of like that. I kind of don't mind the thought that I'm sweet. I mean, so long as I can be a bitch sometimes. <a href=>""I like who I am when I'm with you,""</a>, right?

3. Snowshoeing in Wisconsin. 
4. Detroit, downtown, because I'm sure a Renaissance throws a good party.  
5. Memphis. I was there for a week when I was eight, visiting the GrandNerds during their brief sojourn. I'd like to see a grownup version, and it seems like the kind of town that can throw a party.

"event","We've had a parade of...we'll call them Visiting Lecturers...at the Old Line Urban Shul, as the Socially Awkward Rabbi was on sabbatical (and has now retired). By design, the lecturers represented some points of view (points of practice?) that are a bit different from our congregation's (lovably but undeniably) slightly stilted form, but perhaps the Buddist Jew was the farthest from our usual sermon. 

(Yes, we meditated. No, the old guys who leave the sanctuary when someone pulls a Bat Kohen didn't like it.) 

I forget why, now, but the mediation had us clearing our minds, and thinking back to a place we felt safe, felt like home. Immediately, of course, I was in that tiny little apartment in the Nerdborhood, back in the People's Republic. In the pink chair (so much worse for wear, now), next to the built in bookshelf with my cookbooks on the top shelf and the little wooden box for newspaper clippings and scribbled recipes, just at arm height. It was sunny but probably winter. There were dishes in the sink, but not too many (I could see them from my chair, but they didn't worry me at all). 

It's funny, how I know that's not where I want to be but that's my place. Maybe that will always be the place I go back to, even if it's not the place for me, now. 

Then the lecturer lead us to the next phase, where we were joined in that space by the one person we wanted with us. And I couldn't come up with anyone who would complete the tableau. There was room on the blue and pink couch for the Ace Gang, and of course there were many nights when some permutation of the Tams hung out there, but...this was my place. I knew they could come if I wanted them, but I didn't need them beside me. 

I wondered if anyone else felt that way, both that they couldn't conjure up that one person in the safe place...and that they were completely comfortable in inhabiting that space alone. I doubt it, honestly, knowing the crowd that was there (I wonder about one person, truth be told, and someday will find the courage to ask him). 

I'm not sure I ever knew how the whole meditation connected to the Torah portion, or Pesach (this was at the end of March), or whatever the link was supposed to be. It's been months, but I still haven't forgotten how calm it felt to be in that tiny apartment in Iowa, in the quiet and solitude of a Saturday afternoon. I'd like to find out where other people go, when given this exercise, but it feels almost too personal to ask."

(Yes, that Cedar Rapids. No, it's nothing like <a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1477837/>that stupid movie</a>.)

I spent the weekend at The Lake House, and it was a lovely weekend at The Lake House, in spite of the GrandNerd-al drama that has surrounded all of my visits this summer. I miss things like gently rolling hills, backyard gardens and the absence of upstairs neighbors (in my vision of Cedar Rapids, I for some reason live in a townhouse). 

I know Cedar Rapids would grate on me; I can't imagine who my friends would be (besides C, of course) and what my life would resemble. But summer in Cedar Rapids would much more closely resemble The Lake House; summer in Cedar Rapids would be actively outdoors, in lakes and on bikes and with hills.

Here in the Midwestern Metropolis, we don't live our summers indoors per se; we're famous for our neighborhood festivals and it's a rare weekend that I don't fork over five dollars for the privilege of wandering up and down a street-turned-fairground and listening to the same six cover bands (Muse and I have tried to figure out how, logistically, these groups are in every place, every weekend) or, when I'm lucky, a street show by the likes of Those Darlins or Dinosaur Jr. We have beaches and one of the biggest of lakes, and there's a few nature preserves and wildlife refuges and a Japanese garden where I've passed many a Shabbat afternoon.

In Cedar Rapids, though, the outdoor spaces would just be There, spaces open because there's nothing else to fill them. It's the informality of space and the freedom to move through it that I miss, Here, where spaces are delinated and it feels like belonging is split up that way too. I like the rules and the big parks and the big lake (and so many more things) but I wonder sometimes who I would be if I had the freedom to drift.

It's funny to have a full decade on the record.

""You know, I don't regret things that I've done. My list is all things I didn't do, and inaction."" That's not as awesome as it sounds at first pass, of course; there's a lot of inaction that borders on shameful. But I've tried to use that thought to remind myself to go for it, to put it out there.

I'm still doing that, I think, but it's funny how along the way I've intentionally or inadvertently started linking other groups together. 

We argue a lot, here in the Midwestern Metropolis, about what schools are responsible for any how much teachers can be held responsible for. Children spend more time in school than they spend anywhere but home, the argument goes...and the counterargument goes, yup, exactly. As adults, shouldn't we extend that argument to our workplaces? Most of us spend more waking weekday hours with our colleagues than anyone else.

Of late, a group of us have decided to embrace that fact. It turns out that I work with people who aren't terribly into going out to lunch or company picnics, but who are super excited to have a lunch potluck or to drink in the basement bar of the grocery store next door.

"event","There's a loose group of us who go out for lunch on Fridays, sometimes. Somewhere in the middle of March, we ended up at a Panda Express (where I will never eat again...how do they have NO vegetarian entrees?...steamed broccoli with hot sauce is not a lunch). No one announced ""in bed"" after reading their fortune cookie (sigh) but mine read, ""The winds of change will blow into your life next month.""

There was an awkward silence. I changed jobs at the end of March, moving from working alongside Work Bestie and the DysFUNctional Dynamos to a group that does mathematical modeling. It's called an actuarial rotation, but (as Work Bestie knew) it was really a bit of a gerrymandering. I'm unbelievably lucky to have the opportunity, but no one has been sure how it would go down. A lot of alliances have had to reshift, and not all of those shifts were comfortable. 

Not too long after, I had one of those days where I met someone who was...not exactly comfortable for me (but came with really good recommendations). But I'd promised myself that I'd think about reaching out this month, which I guessed meant I had to try moving beyond what was comfortable. And everything was changing, anyway, so why not say yes when I would normally demur? 

You know why I'm afraid of reaching out? Because you don't ask for help unless you can't go on without it, and I don't know the line between reaching out and taking help you don't need. Except that's not really how it is; there is a place that's holding a hand without it being a hand up, the difference between an handshake and a friendly hand-squeeze and holding hands when you cross the street and being pulled out from underneath the crackling ice that used to cover the lake. 

For years and years, I've misheard Dar's <a href=""http://www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/monster-in-law/thebeautyoftherain.htm"">The Beauty of the Rain</a>: ""Feeling helpless if you asked for help/and scared you'd have to change yourself...."" Because I did that once or maybe more than once, held hands and leapt and didn't look down, and it turned out it was all based on the theory that I would change myself without remorse, without any regret. I keep my hands, and indeed as much as possible, to myself. 

I've thrown a little of that caution aside of late, literally and metaphorically dancing until late into the night, chatting with strangers on the train, asking out and accepting invitations. It's not always fun and it's not always prudent (and a few times I've had to say no, a slave as always to the Society of Actuaries, but I'm even sad about it), and sometimes it's downright awkward and it's never very clear what anyone else thinks of my outstretched hand. But, thankfully, so far no one has swatted my hand away or suggested I have no right to offer it. And there have been moments that have made me question so much of what I had assumed. (About what? Too many things. I'm trying to understand it well enough to make it coherent. I'm trying to understand enough to make some of it real.)

As Dar sings in <a href=""http://www.stlyrics.com/songs/d/darwilliams1000/thehudson1037837.html"">The Hudson</a> :
<i>If you're lucky you'll find something that reflects you,
helps you feel your life protects you,
cradles you and connects you to everything.</i> ***

I think I know what those things are; there's more than one, and they don't have to be in conflict as best I can tell. I'm doing my best to connect them, next I have to let them connect me. I don't know how much I'll change, or if in the long run I'll change anything more than my new job. (Which I love, by the way.) But I'm wondering. To spread your wings, I'm realizing, you have to first reach out.

At the crappy pseudoChinese lunch, NewDude broke open his cookie and rolled his eyes. ""You should have this one, Math, 'cause I think you're pretty funny."" <i>Your sense of humor draws people to you*</i>, it read. He's right, it does**. The trick is reaching out to them, once they're there.

*<i>I resisted the urge to announce ""in bed!"" at the end of this fortune. But mostly 'cause I didn't want to get caught in a lie.</i>
**<i>I will neither confirm nor deny reports that NewDude mumbled ""and you're pretty"" at the end of his comment. Poor kid.</i>"

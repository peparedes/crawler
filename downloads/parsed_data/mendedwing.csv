"event","i realized yesterday that i never answer my phone... like ever.  and then when i see who i ve missed i think, ""ill call them in a bit"" and then i forget.  i am so lazy its ridiculous.  i got in trouble yesterday because i use too much gas and i spend almost 1000 dollars a year at starbucks.... its crazy i know.  so i have decided that i can only go there 3 times a week.  i am going to go crazy though.  like absolutely crazy.   i bet it doesnt last... not at all.  if i go 3 times a week that is 11.41 a week if i dont tip.  (my grande iced non fat caramel macchiato is 3.73)  im depressed.  i am going to austin tomorrow.  with my bro which could be fun.  for me anyway i dont imagine that austin will have much fun at all but maybe we can go to a show or something... who knows.  anyway for the rest of today i am supposed to chill with mom who faked...(fook?) sick today so she can get her hair done.  i have SO DONE THAT before.  lol but we are going to go to west villaige which will be the third day in a row for me.  hooray for consistency.  lata cracka foos.

i have found that alot of times being extremely friendly to people at places like starbucks, or jamba juice, can often result in cheap, or even free stuff.  and i think sex is the same way today too.  sad but true.  virginity is the most sacred thing that we can choose what we want to do with.  we can keep it until marraige, or give it to someone who we wont care anything about in 2 years.  its such a waste of such a beautiful thing.  anyway side note."

(spanish for actions) that it makes me sick.  i am not going to sit around and wait for people to get over whatever the hell they are bitching about to make myself happy.  maybe me freaking stepping on some toes will help them (and just so you know if you are reading this there is like a 99 percent chance that you have nothing to do wih this) to get over their stupid problems... that are no longer my problems...

"event","i cant stop thinking about the subject of respect and judgement.  i dont know why everyone assumes that we arent supposed to judge people.  no you are not supposed to ""judge"" them meaning condemn them or think that you are better than them.  but you are supposed to judge them based on character, and habits.  you ahve to decide based on those judgements who you decide to hang around with or what to do.  also... everyone today seems to think that they deserve respect.  respect is not an unalienable right, it is a privelage, it is earned, it is deserved.  i am not called to respect my peers.  (not saying that i dont, but i am not called to.)  i am called to love them.  thats it.  just been on my mind.  peace yall

(thank you thomas hardy...and if you do get that then you are as big an english nerd as i am.)  anyway... back to the cloud thing to make it applicable to me i am going to say that these clouds are gross and polluted and dark and stringy, and that they are lined in bright neon yellow.  i need some neon yellow... i miss austin. and where the hell is a grande non fat iced caramel macchiato when you NEED one?  and no, drive through starbucks, you arent good enough either, just like the rest of us."

"event","but at least i got my little sleeping angel!!! i love that nickname!!! cuz he is my little sleeping angel!!! <3 way to obsessed! YES NARUTO IS THIS SATURDAY! i will feel better then...and when i get a sasuke plush but today i have been listening to sasukes theme over and over again! i love it!!!! but it is a boring day! i wish i took a nap i am so tired. but i would not look adorible like sasuke does! *over obbsessive* but during naruto last weekend when u know in the first comic when sakura sees sasuke u know the illusion what kakashi did of sasuke that made her faint during it *remind u it is teeny in the show* but i cryed! now i am a sakura! although if sasuke was real i would try not to act like her cuz i would want him to like me as a friend! but that episode was awsome! 9\10!!!! but i love how sasuke says names he says it so COOL! eh i just knowticed that...but when his head was poking out that was cute! i loved it also when he shared his food...but it would scare me half to death if kakashi did that to me just pop out of no were like that so angry! yes i am babbling!!! but what would the world be like without babbling!!! babble babble babble!!! but i cant wait untill i have something to do again! and to breath out of my nose. i want that back to. my poor nose. so stuffed up. but i hope that i dont have too much homework and that my mom will come home with it SOON! i am bord and i need something to do although my throut hurts to but my nose is annoying me more!! stupid nose. MY NOSE IS IN NEED WHERE ARE MY PUFFS INDEED? i just have kleenex. i want puffs so that my nose can stop hiding behind my ear. *in the comercial the stupid kids nose hides behing his ear cuz he is afraid of the hard tissues that the  stupid kid has cuz they hurt the nose* and i am hungry.. way hungry. i want to eat now but i am way to lazy!i wonder if sasuke ever got sick??? gosh i think i am almost done. i guess thats my long entry! boy when i get into typing class mrs williams will be proud that i can type with out looking at the keybourd! cuz last year i got dinged for that and i failed my final. at least both me and sasuke failed at something.
well i am finally going off this entry!!!
love ur sick sneezing sasuke carazed person

"event","i do very silly things when i drink if nobody has ever noticed that before 
tuesday night i screamed at danny and threw johns keys on the pavement and broke his keyless entry, and they cost $150 dollars. 
i am broke and i feel horrible for doing that. 
but any whisper, inkling feeling or thought that anybody has thinking i have john kilian ""whipped"" should really  leave the heads of anybody quickly. 
im the one who is closer to being whipped lemme tell ya. 
and last night 
 i locked myself out of my room completely freaking Naked. i know why i was naked but why i left my room, or how i closed the door i do not. 
john would'nt wake up from me knocking on the door for a while, but my clustermates sure did. so  i woke them all up and they came out in the hall.  and i was there. 
naked. drunk. crying. in the hallway. 
im surprised it didnt happen any sooner.  
but nope, in the last 2 weeks of school. 
this is the home stretch.  i will come back after this shit is done, when all the reasons i am stressed out will be gone. Ill be alive again, i won't feel so dead and inadequate. 
next school year won't get like this, because i figured it out.  how to do well in college, without being a bookworm. it's not hard, but it just takes a little bit of responsibility. my grades are awesome right now, that's partly responsible for my so to say dissapearance. rasing a 2.1 to a 3.5 is a very hard task in a semester. first semester made me feel so shitty after i got those back, and that was the same time other problems started to happen. a vivace decrescendo to the best time of my entire life. 
and that's the end of the story. ( with a lot of missing details, and things might never be the same again)
there are so many good things to come though. i cant wait to live with andrea again, i really cant fucking wait. 
 i miss being around her all the time. it's like when your a little kid and you never want to go home from your best friends house because your having fun, except now there's no going home."

Mike Jones - Type Of Nigga U Need Lyrics

[Mike Jones]
MIKE JONES! For the ladies baby!
Who? Mike Jones! [3x]
(Yeeah!)
This here for the ladies man
You know what im sayin 
I know I aint balling right now but
If you stay down with me while im down 
when I come up, Imma prove it to you
(Prove What?)
That im the type of nigga you need!

[Chorus]
[Brighteyes]
I'm not a balla just dreaming of being one
If you with me while i'm broke, when i'm rich it'll be more fun
and, we can cruise i'll show you the
whole world
C'mon be a grown lady instead of a little girl, cause Im all you
need (Im all you need) I think im
all that you need, girl.

[Mike Jones]
Baby girl, I know you tired of that mess 
You're man giving you stress
put that cigarrete down let me put your nerves to rest
See im a man, not a child, with things that'll make you smile
You was here when I was broke so I know you here for awhile
she encouraged me to keep working hard for my dream, even though
my lights were out she stayed on my
team
She helped me, stay focus to get what I need and I told her when
I blow the whole world she gon' see
she gon' be the only one you see me with
Im for real this girl here's legit, I aint got alot of dollars
but she loves the dick, while at the
time me and her loves to get
I'm gon' be there for her like she was there for me, I looked at
her and told her, 'Mike Jones the
type of nigga you need'  I looked at her and told her, 'Mike
Jones the type of nigga you need'.

[Chorus]
[Brighteyes]
I'm not a balla just dreaming of being one
If you with me while i'm broke, when i'm rich it'll be more fun
and, we can cruise i'll show you the
whole world
C'mon be a grown lady instead of a little girl, cause Im all you
need (Im all you need) I think im
all that you need, girl.

[Brigheyes]
I'm feeling that, Im feeling it uh..
The tone in your voice I know what you want and baby you uh,
made the right choice cause the sex is
great
Your love is a pit and im feeling way more qaulified, then them
bustas you be dealin with, come and
get a hit of this
Mama come on and roll with me, Dont worry bout that drama yeah I
keep that .4 with me
Pretty much im down for a one night stand that caddy driving man
wood grain all up in his hands
come on and roll with a G, come on and smoke with a G, and I
know your Dad and your mama dont even
approve of me
but still the girl show me love cause she real, the type of
chick thats down with you with or without
your deal and theres no future bigger then the one I planning
for us
You got me twisted and titled I think im about to bust baby,I
think im about to bust
cause a, cause a, cause I told you im all you need

[Chorus]
[Brighteyes]
I'm not a balla just dreaming of being one
If you with me while i'm broke, when i'm rich it'll be more fun
and, we can cruise i'll show you the
whole world
C'mon be a grown lady instead of a little girl, cause Im all you
need (Im all you need) I think im
all that you need, girl.

[Mike Jones]
Before the fame and change came you were holdin me down when I
need me a rise you would roll me
around, she kept the sunshine and when the rain came around and
from then on I went on 
I told her for being down, 'Im gunna forever be around with her'
cause I aint putting all this time
just to leave her she needs me and I know that I need her, Yeah
Mike Jones, WHO? Mike Jones, Jones,
and Im the type of nigga you need

[Chorus 2x]
[Brighteyes]
I'm not a balla just dreaming of being one
If you with me while i'm broke, when i'm rich it'll be more fun
and, we can cruise i'll show you the
whole world
C'mon be a grown lady instead of a little girl, cause Im all you
need (Im all you need) I think im
all that you need, girl."

3) The Song ""Everyman For Himself""
4) ""I can't think of anything/ That makes me more upset/ People talk all this rhetoric/ Forgive but not forget/ I don't rape, and I don't pillage/ Other people's lives/ I don't practice what you preach/ and I won't see through your eyes"" - ""Real World""
5)""Deep, deep, deep in my eyes/ There's a round, round, round circle of lives/ It's a tame tame tame sort of world/ Where you're caught, bought, taught as it twirls"" - ""Circle One""
6) The Songe ""Tiny Island"" and ""Cradle to the Grave""
7) This record is just so cruical
8) ""Just want to find out what you're nice to me for""

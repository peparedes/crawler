"event","Whew. Sorry I haven't updated or commented lately. I've had shingles. I finally move out to enjoy myself and I'm miserable and broken out and in pain. I haven't wanted to do anything, my skin has been on fire and bleeding. RAAAH! The apartment is a mess. The dishes are stacked a mile high.

I'm going to go pass out. -_-"

The apartment is ok. It's on the small side but I get to call it my own. The first night here everyone came over and basically hot boxed the place. Then they wouldn't go home. I had a lot of fun but I was so tired from moving that I wanted to sleep. I should be done unpacking everything by the end of the week. Then I'll start decorating. It's creepy having all white walls. My Dad is really dissapointed that I left. But I don't care. It's me time now.
I hope that me and Steve will be alright living together. I'm so excited that I get to see him every night. 

More later I have more to do!"

"event","Here I am again. I don't have many interesting things to report. Steve and I went apartment/trailor hunting. We found a few apartments we really like...and they're around here! I'm so excited. I'd love to get the hell out of Delaware not move even farther down into deserted land.
   I need a better layout. Anyone know where I can get a neat one? I'm not too great on making my own stuff (unless I wanted to embarrass myself) so I guess I'll poke around until I find something worthwhile.

Well I better run my Mother is nagging at me. 

I CANNOT WAIT TO GET OUT OF HERE."

"event","It's Friday. I'm just waiting for Steve to get off of work so we can go and get some FOOD. We're going to look at apartments/trailers tomorrow. He wants to move down to Harrington to live closer to his brother. I hate living in hickville as it is and there is <i>nothing</i> to do down there. 
Well this entry sucks but I don't have a lot of time."

"event","I've been thinking about <i>LOST</i> ever since last night's finale.  It's been hard to get out of my mind and I thought about attempting to watch some BSG to get something else going, but no dice.  

<lj-cut text=""spoilers for LOST be here"">
I have to say, I've never liked a show more than I've liked LOST.  Everything about it just worked.  The actors, the sets, the plot, the music (Michael Giacchino, you are a GOD).  Everything.  I know it will go down as being one of the greatest shows to ever be on television.  

I know there are complaints out there like ""they never answered ____ or what about _______.""  The thing is, LOST was never about the food drops or the polar bears.  It was about the characters.  Their relationships.  Their love for one another.  Their redemption in the end.  

I'm not saying I am completely satisfied with the lack of answers, but it just doesn't bug me too much.  Also, it really gets my goat that people on the internet are running around saying that the island was purgatory and that none of it happened, the losties died in the plane crash, blah blah blah.  THAT WASN'T WHAT HAPPENED.  Everything that happened on that island happened the way we saw it.  It was only when they all died, on the island or years later, that they all came to this ""sideways"" world to find each other again and ""move on"".  Geez.  Christian explained that all to Jack.  I really don't understand why people are still saying it was all a dream or whatever.  Idiots.  

So, I spent the whole two and a half hours either teary eyed or full out crying.  Not lying.  I admit, I was never a huge fan of Jack/Kate, but when she kissed him on the cliffs, I cried.  Then, in the purgatory world, when she told him that she had missed him so much, I cried some more. I finally understood it.  

The ""awakening"" that made me lose my shit was Sawyer and Juliet's.  
<lj-embed id=""68""/>

Ok, maybe Charlie/Claire's too.  

I never thought Jack dying would make me cry my eyes out, but it totally did.  Gawd, the music KILLED me.  OMG and then Vincent the dog had to show his cute face.  *jears*

<lj-embed id=""69""/>

The job that I was offered is pretty much amazing.  It's full time, full benefits, 3 weeks personal time and 50 cents more an hour than what I'm making here.  

Best thing of all, it's not just an admin. assistant position.  I'll be speaking with investment firms and learning the process of wealth management.  I'll be busy from 8-5.  I'm really excited about this prospect.

"event","What do Doctor Who and Thom Yorke have in common?  Nothing, but I decided to post about them both today.  

 I have to say I am growing very fond of the 11th Doctor.  He is more alien than 10 was at the end.  He's also more...I guess unhinged.  I like it.  11 is reminding me of classic Who doctors.  Next week's episode has River Song.  Ugh, I do not like that stranger bitch.


Last night, Skye and I went to the Atoms for Peace concert at the Santa Barbara Bowl.  Atoms for Peace is Thom Yorke's (Radiohead frontman) touring band .  It was an out-of-this-world experience.  They played some Radiohead songs, some songs off Thom Yorke's solo album and also some new songs.  There was one song, ""Give up the Ghost"", in which he was constantly layering what he was singing.  He would sing/play something, record it, then play it back and sing some more stuff.  It was truly amazing.  This wasn't from last night, but it's the same song and same technique:

<lj-embed id=""66""/>

Then, he performed a Radiohead song called ""Videotape"".  I don't know why, but almost every time I hear this song, I tear up or start crying.  Maybe because of what the song is about....death, saying goodbye...whatever it is, the tears start rollin'.  When he sat down and started playing the song, I was hoping to keep the tears in my eyes.  Take a listen.

<lj-embed id=""67""/>

Anyway, the whole thing was magical (except maybe all the pot smoking going on around us).  It's great that amazing musicians like Thom exist in this world."

"event","Between Tommy Knight accidentally slashing himself with Captain Jack and the sorority girls clashing with DW fans, it's been a crazy weekend!  


<lj-cut text=""click here for really long and rambly account of Gally.  I&#39;m tired, sorry it&#39;s so rambly.  Wanted to get everything out before I forgot it."">
When we arrived at the con hotel Thursday night, ""Lobbycon"" was in full swing.  It was PACKED.  Skye and I just spent our time watching tv in our room (which thankfully had a balcony view of the pool like last year).  

We got a little bit of a late start on Friday morning, so we decided to eat breakfast at one of the restaurants at the hotel.  Oh boy.  The buffet was 20 bucks and it had minimal selection!  Well, at least they had a lot of bacon.  Eating there at the same time were Georgia Moffett, Graeme Harper, Tommy Knight and Nick Briggs.  

When we finished with our five million dollar breakfast, we went down to the con to pick up our badges then had some time to kill before the festivities began.  Our first item on the agenda was to see the Nicholas Briggs interview.  He talked about how he is usually on set and can't really see what is going on in filming.  He also talked a bit about the different Dalek voices he does.  We had to leave a little early because we had to get tickets for the first autograph session (to get Briggs, Graeme Harper, Tommy Knight, Louise Page and Colin Teague's autograph).  Once we did that, we went up to the Friday Photo Op room with the TARDIS and took our photo with Briggs, Harper, Knight, Page, Moffett and John Pickard.  They were all really lovely; telling every one of us hello and ask us how we were doing.  

After that was done, we kind of wandered into the <i>Torchwood: Children of Earth 4</i> commentary.  It was...a tad boring as we came in pretty late (Ianto was already dying).  We then had to get in line AGAIN to get tickets to the second autograph session.  After that, it was time for the first autograph session.  Colin Teague liked the book I had him sign because he said it had a great picture of him and a quote, lol.  Graeme Harper was very appreciative of the praise I bestowed upon him on behalf of my friend <lj user=""phantomviola"">.  Louise Page signed a spot on my book that had a goofy pic of her in one of the Impossible Planet spacesuits.  She did not enjoy that the pic got into the book, but signed it anyway, lol.  

Urgh, and I was so sad that we weren't able to get Nick Brigg's autograph.  Right as we were getting to him, he decided that he had to go to the bathroom!!!!  Great timing, lol.  

After we did that, we headed up to the main programming room to catch the tail end of the <i>Doctor's Daughter</i> commentary with Georgia Moffett and Alice Troughton.  I am so sad that we didn't go for the whole thing!  They were hilarious!  Apparently, Georgia has a phobia of fishes.  She was also commenting that she was so cold and possibly mesmerized by David's sexiness that in one shot, she looks a bit high.  HAHA.  Also they were saying how, in the ending scene, David's hair did not move!  Freema's was moving all over the place and David's was firmly in place.  I need some of whatever they use on his hair, lol.  

After that we went back down to the autograph room to get Georgia's, Alice's and John Fay's autograph.  John Fay was really digging the pic that <lj user=""phantomviola""> wanted him to sign.  He was a very cool easy going guy with a thick Manchester (I think?!) accent.  Really nice guy.  Alice Troughton was absolutely lovely lovely lovely.  She was sad that my friend couldn't make it, so she signed on her book that she was sorry she couldn't make it and would have loved to have met her.  AWW.  And the lovely Georgia.  Ok now, I was already kinda hating on her because she is dating my celebrity crush, but I have got to say this: she is so adorable.  She totally won me over.  Love her!  

Ok, after that was done, we went into the Tommy Knight interview in the main programming room.  What a cutie pie!  He speaks very well for someone who is only 17.  He is not a huge fan of DW.  He said that Elizabeth Sladen really is like the mom on set and she is just lovely to work with as are all the others on the show.  He also said that David Tennant is so energetic and upbeat and it just gets everyone else caught up in that (NOTE: I have to say that almost every single of of the actors and directors had some kind of praise for DT.  This made me love him more).  Tommy stated that he would like to be in Torchwood, sure.  He said that that if Captain Jack wanted he would ""be there for him"" which caused everyone to snicker and laugh.  He even thought about it for a sec and put his hands to his face, lol.  

Once that was done, we waited in our seats for the opening ceremonies.  All the guests were introduced, then a special video message from The Moff himself was shown (<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/cthulhuattack/4390668545/"">here</a>).  Then, the epic Peter Davison video with cameo from DT was shown.  He was in it for just a few seconds, but it was enough to make everyone in the audience scream and shout.  I hope someone in the audience was able to grab the video of it.  :(  

My hubby and I were STARVING, so we went to <a href=""http://www.pacoscantina.com/"">Paco's Tacos</a> for dinner.  It was decent.  I think what we liked more was the lively ambiance.  It was PACKED.  We got back to the hotel and were too stuffed to get back out of our room to see the live band they had.  I regret it!  Oh well.  

It was raining on Saturday, but we still decided to walk to Carl's Jr. to get food.  No more five million dollar breakfasts!  When we got back, we attended the Director's Roundtable with Graeme Harper, Alice Troughton and Colin Teague.  They moaned a bit about the new HD cameras and talked about how it is good that the new production team is coming in with whole new directors.  Alice said that she's seen some of the new stuff and that we are going to be very pleased with the new Doctor.  This made me very happy and reassured about what's to come.  Also, we now know who is to blame for the really loud music on DW.  It is...ladies and gentlemen...wait for it...Phil Collinson.  Colin Teague was talking about how certain scenes, he wanted to go with little to no music and then Phil would be like ""no, there's going to be music there"".  So, basically he thinks there is sometimes too much and too loud music on DW.  I totally agree with that statement.  Graeme loves to talk, lol.  He is an adorable man.  He was talking about how he almost got sacked on the first episodes he directed because they didn't allow for time on little things like how long it would take a Cyberman to get in and out of costume.  Can you imagine a DW world without Graeme Harper?  Crazy. 

We then attended the Louise Page costume slide show.  She basically talked about a number of costumes that she has worked on since series 2.  She recounted the whole suit-made-from-trousers story that we've all heard about.  Lovely lady.  

We stayed on for the Georgia Moffett interview.  She admitted her desire to play the Master and she doesn't care if they regenerate Jenny if she reappears in DW ""as long as she's hot"".  LOL.  She also said that David Tennant was ""her"" Doctor.  She mentioned that her and her friend got locked out of their adjoining room at the hotel the other night and had a hard time getting the hotel staff to let them back in.  Apparently they thought they were trying to break in or something, haha.  

We took a break from our DW con to attend PaleyFest's LOST panel in Beverly Hills.  It was AMAZING.  Darlton were there, as well as other writers and actors.  It was very informative and just wonderful to get a peek at what's in store as well as what has been in their heads this whole time.  One scene that Damon Lindelof talked about, that has been in my heart since I first saw it, was the raft scene in Exodus Part 1 (end of season 1).  The music and everything was just...gah, words cannot describe what that scene does to me.  When the dog tries to swim to the raft, I lose my shit every time. 

<lj-embed id=""64""/>

That's when I knew I would love this show forever.  

Well, now that we got that out of our system, we went to In-n-Out to get takeout burgers (again, with the starving).  We ate in our room then wandered back down for the late night festivities.  Much to Skye's chagrin, I wanted to go into the Buffy sing-a-long.  SO MUCH FUN!  A room packed with people singing along to the Buffy episode <i>Once More With Feeling</i>.  It's the famous musical episode from Buffy, season 6.  After we got our singing done, we went into the disco.  We danced to a couple of songs, then the music was switched to some hip-hop booty shakin' music and that ain't our style, yo.  So we left and called it a night. 

One other thing, there was an herbalife hispanic conference going on on the same floor Saturday, during the day and then a sorority girl auction thing going on at night.  Ok, it sounds like the start of a bad joke, but it was seriously confusing.  You could tell the hispanic business ppl and the sorority girls in little black dresses and heels were very much confused by whovians in fancy dress.  It was kind of amazing.  

Anyway, woke up this morning, checked out, one last look around the dealer's room and left to come back to SB.

"event","Happy New Year!  Can you believe it is 2010 already?  Time sure is flying.  I realized last week that I graduated high school 10 years ago.  Gah, I can't believe it's been 10 years already.  I feel completely detached from what I used to be 10 years ago and even 4 years ago when I lived in El Paso.  

2009 was an ok year...It wasn't spectacular nor was it horrible.  I entered my late 20s.  I got a new tv and bluray player.  Skye and I celebrated our 10 year anniversary and our 4 year wedding anniversary.  

David Tennant's time ended on Doctor Who.  I'm not going to front, I was a sobbing mess.  I am going to miss Ten so much!  But the great thing about Doctor Who, is that it goes on.  There will be a new Doctor and new adventures.  There's a reason this show has been on for 40+ years!  More exciting times ahead with Eleven, I'm sure.

2010 might be the last full year we spend out here in California.  Skye talked to his prof and it was kind of decided that he could finish in a year and a half.  So June-ish 2011?  Possibly maybe.  They also talked about where he could apply for a post-doc position.  Skye is going to apply at Los Alamos National Lab near Santa Fe, NM; Argonne near Chicago; this place in Germany(!); and the University of Edinburgh(!) in Scotland.  I'm hoping he gets a job at Los Alamos (very likely).  It would be closer to my family and that is a big plus for me.  Although, I would very much like the experience of living abroad for a couple of years.  We shall see where this takes us!  

Anyway, here's to a fabulous new year!  Cheers! *clinks glass*"

I know I'm way behind, but Thanksgiving was really great this year.  Skye and I decided to forgo the usual stress of driving up to his aunt's house and just have a nice dinner at our apartment with some friends (who also weren't going home).  It was Skye and I and five friends.  Skye did the turkey, which came out great.  Everyone brought side dishes and beer/some booze.  We ate, played some games on the Wii (Super Mario Bros!!), and then watched <i>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</i> Christmas Special.  I love that show so much, you don't even know.  Anyway, we had fun!

My bosses had a party last month for their 25th wedding anniversary. It was an insane party and the best part was that they discovered that they had never turned in their marriage license in SB County, so they were never officially married in the first place!  Good times.  They fixed it.  Now they really are married.  :P  

Lately, I've been watching <i>The Office</i>, US version.  I mean, marathon sessions.  I'm, like, really invested in Jim & Pam's relationship.  

Speaking of tv shows, OMG, I cannot WAIT until Christmas!  You know why?  New <i>Doctor Who</i>!  I also hear David Tennant is in LA filming his NBC pilot.  It's hard to be so near LA, but yet so far away at the same time.  Why why whyyyy did Skye have to pick a school one and a half hours away from Los Angeles, lol.  

Have a great week, lovelies.  <3"

I'm almost done with <i>Firefly</i> and then I have to watch the movie.  It's a fun show and each character is likeable in their own weird way.  Too bad it only lasted one season and a movie.

I'm trudging through <i>Heroes</i>.  It's taking me a long time to get through this one because it's...actually really bad.  It's a bad show.  I admit it.  But I can't seem to stop.  It's like a car wreck on the highway, you gotta look.  

This past week, I've *really* gotten addicted to <i>True Blood</i>.  What a hot, hot show.  All the guys are doable (especially Bill and Eric).  I know it's mostly trashy, but I am ADDICTED.  I'm almost through season one.  *fans self*

I've also got <i>Life on Mars</i> UK original version.  So much better than the American remake.  

After I finish <i>Life on Mars</i>, I'm going to start on <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>.  I know, there's a lot to go through and I've seen quite a few episodes but I've never really seen it from start to finish.  That's what I'm going to do.  Phew!  

Anyway for weekend shenanigans, <lj-cut text=""click here"">.

The hubby and I have been going out on Friday nights with his labmates.  It's sort of our thing now.  Last Friday was our first time going to the downtown Santa Barbara bars.  We ended up going to two bars.  At the first bar, three of our friends decided it was a good idea to have a pizza eating contest.  First person to finish a large pizza wins.  Luckily, the bartender said ordering the pizza from Domino's and having it delivered was ok, lol.  One guy finished in 5 fucking minutes!  I think we underestimated him.  Our bet money went into our Las Vegas 2010 fund.  Oh well, at least it was for a good cause.  

At the second bar, our friends were playing darts, but it was so freakin' crowded and by that time, the skanks and hos were starting to roam around the bars and it became suffocating.  The night ended with popped collars, peanut throwing, drunken graduate students and an interesting car ride home with the said drunken graduate students.  No, Skye and I were not drunk.  Not our style, beotches.  

I have really come to enjoy these nights.  It's always a nice end to a workweek.

A couple of weekends ago, Skye and I bought a 46"" flat screen.  We had money saved, so we thought we should just go for it.  It is amazing.  The first night we had it, we watched <i>Blade Runner</i> and holy shit it looked amazing.  Now we have digital cable and a whole bunch of HD channels.  We spend a good few hours on Sunday watching the Planet Earth marathon.  Love that show!  

Skye took me to see <i>Ponyo</i> yesterday.  I really like Miyazaki films (understatement maybe?  I have one of his characters tattooed on my back!), so to finally be able to see one in the theater instead of having to wait until it is on dvd was great.  It was adorable and all the kids in the theater seemed to enjoy it also.  

Yesterday, before we went to see <i>Ponyo</i>, I decided to check my twitter account.  @nineinchnails posted that there were very limited tickets available for the last two concert dates in LA.  I immediately went to the website and was able to purchase two tickets to NIN's very last show at the Wiltern.  Trent Reznor has said that this is the very last tour NIN will ever do, so to be able to be there is beyond words.  I know he'll get bored in two or three years and tour again, but until then, I'm going to pretend that this is absolutely the last tour.  ;)  I'm hoping for something epic to happen.  We'll see!  The only problem is that we might encounter the famous LA traffic on the way there and will be driving back to Santa Barbara at some ungodly hour of the night.  And we have to get up early for work on Friday.  I predict I will be zombie-fied on Friday for sure.  

Woohoo!!!"

<i>
There was a time when all the shadows of these tall buildings
Would throw their cape around each corner of their grassy feet
And one by one, each new shade, would cover the green way back;
Allowing changes that we could not have foreseen

Everybody let us kiss upon the world, we created
Let us rest our eyes up by the great machine, as we wave goodbye
Feel the evening breeze caress your smile, the cities are dying
As we watch it falling to a modern state, a modern time


Remember when we hear the distant sound of human life?
A zillion noises whip our eyes that travel through the sky
And one by one, each little sound, has faded away with time,
Allowing changes that we could not have foreseen

<b>Everybody let us say goodbye to all, our emotions.
'Cause there's nothing left to say that we're humane, when we're left behind
It's to late to think that we can worship hu-man emotions
'Cause we've already evolved into machines, in our minds</b></i>

"event","If <i>Moon</i> is playing in your area, please go see it!  The hubby and I saw it last night and it was really good.  I know it might turn people off because it's labeled as sci-fi, but it's more than that.  Plus it stars Sam Rockwell, who is mighty fine.  He carries the entire movie by himself and it definitely worked.  The movie was intense and a bit of a mind-fuck.  Oh yah, and it was directed by David Bowie's son!  OH, and Clint Mansell did the soundtrack who also did <i>The Fountain</i>'s soundtrack.  Beautiful stuff.  

Here's the trailer:

Now go see it.  ;)


In other news, I got a tattoo yesterday.  It was a long time in the making.  I wanted to make sure I really wanted the design before I put it on my body permanently.  You can see pictures of it on my facebook.  It's on the side of my back, so it hurt like a motherfucker.  It's a weird thing to get a tattoo of, but it has a deeper meaning to me than it being a weird anime character.  It's my second tattoo.  Would I endure the pain again?  Definitely.  

I thought about something Doctor Who related, but then I realized that I didn't want to get a Seal of Rassilon like everyone else gets and I don't a huge Dalek on my ass or anything.  I don't trust anyone quite yet to get the linework down right for a gallifreyan script of some sort so until then, no DW tattoo.  Something music related is next, I think...


Seriously, now go see <i>Moon</i>."

I'm amazed at how great and powerful <i>Torchwood</i> was.  It was the best series I've seen all year (except for LOST, of course).  It truly exceeded any expectations I had.  There were brilliant performances by all the actors, but I have to say Peter Capaldi did a truly exceptional job.  I don't want to spoil anything, but his character has to do something extremely heartbreaking (and a bit cowardly??) and he just nailed it.  

I now fear there won't be much of a series 4, but to tell you the truth if they ended it this way, I would be happy.  

If you get BBC America, please be sure to tune in on July 20th.

But then Skye brought to my attention that I've been eating whole wheat tortillas every weekday for lunch.  See, I have this intolerance to enriched flour but for some reason when I eat whole wheat, I'm ok.  So I thought, ""awesome, I can dump the brown rice tortillas and eat whole wheat.""  Um, NOT.  I guess I can only eat it in moderation.  Also, I haven't really been eating a whole lot.  My appetite is just not there.  Anyway, I have to get myself back on track.  

Then, the trailer for <i>The Time Traveler's Wife</i> was released on Friday.  It made me tear up a bit because I remembered how the book made me cry like a little bitch.  I remember I was at the Phoenix airport and crying while waiting for my connecting plane.  Haha, so embarassing.  Then, I lent it to my friend at work, and she cried too.  But, I think her and I just cry too much at anything because we watched the season 4 finale of Doctor Who during lunch on Friday and we were both sobbing.  She kept saying she hated me for getting her into that show, lol.  Anyway, here's the trailer for <i>The Time Traveler's Wife</i>:

In order to go into the courts, you have to go through a security checkpoint, of course.  My coworker had a freaking BUTTER KNIFE in her bag, LOL.  Who the hell has a butter knife in a purse???  Anyway, the security guys were really amused and took it away.  She also had one of those cuticle pusher-back thingies.  It looks like she could shank somebody with it, so they took that too.  

We waiting for about an hour, then they brought her in.  She was in her blue jail suit and shackled and she looked greasy.  The DA came over to us and introduced himself.  They scheduled another hearing to schedule a hearing.  So dumb and a waste of taxpayer dollars.  Anyway, it was good to see her; kind of cathartic in a way.  She did NOT want to look at us. I don't blame her.  Every time she goes in court, there's someone different from our company watching her.  

All that said, I do not want to see her again until her sentencing day.  We're hoping for 20 years.  She only wants 1 year and then probation.  One year for 21 felony charges?  I don't think so.  

Anyway, we were back at the office before 11:30 a.m....been working since then, am taking a small break to write this.

I also love hot guys.  This was, without a doubt, the hottest looking cast!!  Now I have a strange attraction to a certain Vulcan named Spock...

Now onto LOST.  I'm convinced LOST will go down as one of the greatest and smartest tv shows of all time.  Everything works on that show.  EVERYTHING.  Well, except maybe Kate.  The season finale was superb.  It was both fascinating and heartbreaking.  UGHHHH, this show is so good.  I can't believe we have to wait until 2010 for the final season.

There are some crazy stuff going on in the Doctor Who set.  I can't wait until Christmas/New Years to see how it all comes together.  Although, I'm going to miss my bb David Tennant and his beautiful face.  :(  I guess I'll just have to be content with seeing him on Masterpiece Theatre.

Skye and I are seeing Nine Inch Nails on Thursday.  Holy fuck.  This will be the second time we've seen them in concert and most likely the last.  Trent Reznor has hinted heavily that they will stop touring after this NIN/JA tour finishes.  So, if this is the last time they are going to be touring, you better believe I will be there with my camera (NIN has a lax camera policy for this tour).  The tickets were so expensive, but I don't care.  Small price to pay to see a genius in the flesh."

Crazy conversation of the day (at the office):

Me: ""....it smells...weird in here..."" *sniff sniff*
Office Mother: ""It's this Emergen-C drink.  Doesn't it smell like ass?""
Me: ""YES""
Office Mother: ""Wait, no, you know what it smells like?  Old, musty balls."""

Luckily, we live in Goleta and on the other side of the freeway, so most likely we are not going to be affected, but those poor people who lost their homes are left with next to nothing.  Very sad.

"event","On Saturday, Skye's lab group along with another group from UCLA went on a group hike at Pt. Mugu along the PCH.  It's in Malibu.  Before we left, we all met at UCSB.  When someone said that the first 800 ft were the hardest because it is a steep incline in which you reach the highest you are going to go, I knew I was in trouble.  Let me tell you, that first 800 ft was BRUTAL.  It was so steep and I was having trouble breathing because I had allergies.  It was a hard climb.  

I really should start doing more cardio.

Anyway, it turned out we hiked more than 5 miles.  MORE THAN 5 MILES.  That is the most walking I have ever done.  On the bright side, the scenery was gorgeous.  I didn't get to enjoy it too much, though, because I was really suffering.  I need to upload some pictures to myspace/facebook.  

My legs are sore beyond belief now.  Boo.

After that, we went to some state beach park and grilled some burgers.  The UCLA group was prepared; they had fixin's, plates, cups, condiments, grilling utensils, deserts, etc.  What did we have?  Beer, some meat patties, cheese, few fixins and condiments, and buns.  No grilling utensils or plates.  Guess that shows you our priorities!  ""Grab the beer, leave the utensils!"".  Oh well.  

Yesterday, Skye and I went Mother's Day shopping.  I don't think I've mentioned this too much before, but I have some kind of enriched flour intolerance.  Well, while we were shopping, we decided to grab a bite to eat and I ate a hamburger with the bun.  I don't know why I did that.  BIG MISTAKE.  I was up at 2:00 a.m. in a cold sweat with nausea and an upset stomach with the shakes.  Never again!!  Whole wheat all the way. 

I also was officially diagnosed with acid reflux and gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining).  I have to cut out chocolate, tomatoes, garlic, teas, caffeine of any kind, alcohol, cigarettes, citrus fruits...I'm sure there's more but that's all I can remember at the moment.  Fuckin' A!!!

Oh well, at least I'm eating healthier than I ever have before."

"event","I recently reorganized my cds and I found some that I had forgotten about.  I was listening to The Postal Service cd the other day and remembered how beautiful it was.  It also reminded me how emo I was back in 2003 when I was 21.  I mean, I would just lie on my bed and just listen to this song: 

<lj-embed id=""39""/>




Haha, what a dweeb.  But seriously, have you ever dug up old cds and then listened to them and have old feelings stir up?  Like, you remember what you were feeling at the time you were obsessed with that particular cd or song?  Weird how our brains and memories work.  Like, I can't stand listening to that LEN song, Steal My Sunshine.  Came out in '99, I think.  It reminds me of bad summer times.   Also, Stitches by Orgy makes me feel weird too.  Not bad, just weird.  I guess my junior and senior years of high school were full of angst, lol.

"event","Tonight, Skye and I are hosting a Margarita Night.  Wellll, it's been renamed to ""Man""garita Night because we're celebrating the end of Moustache March.  For some reason, everyone is expecting it to be an epic night.  I have SO much to do.  I have to make enchiladas and tacos (it's now a potluck/margarita party).  Have to vacuum and clean.  Only the parts of the apartment people are likely to see.  Will shove dirt under rug.  

I have some little chocolate liqueur bottles that I can't eat anymore because I can't each chocolate anymore (boohoo).  I'm going to set them out and let everyone eat them.  Poo.  Oh well.  I wish I could.

On Saturday, I have a gig.  Me!  It's for a little dinner party that my bosses are hosting at their house.  I don't have much solo music so I'm just going to wing it.  Haha.  Stretch out some pieces that go fast.  Let's just say Allegro will be Andante.  Easy money, I hope.

Also, I just paid for my Gallifrey 2010 membership.  Skye too.  I have no idea if we'll actually be able to go yet, but I wanted to buy them while they were cheaper.  Yay!!!

"event","For some reason, Doctor Who has been on my mind all weekend.  It might have something to do with recent set pictures...especially from late last week and earlier today.  Crazy stuff!!

I had a mildly traumatizing experience on Friday here at work.  One of the ranch workers came to the office to tell us that one of the goats didn't look very good.  Heidi, who is the ranch manager, wasn't on the property so she asked if I could go up and look at it to make sure it was really sick before sending out a vet.  I didn't feel like looking at a dying goat alone, so I asked my coworker to come with me.  We went up to where they keep the goats and sheep and immediately we saw which one they were talking about.  It had it's back legs stretched out behind him, his front legs were bent and his head was thrown back, looking up at the sky.  It looked very rigid and kinda looked...dead.  We actually thought it had died, but we went inside the pen to take a closer look.  It wasn't dead, but it was breathing hard and it looked like it was in pain.  

We thought it might be a snake bite or something.  Ugh, so traumatizing!  Anyway, it turns out the goat had tetanus, so the vet came the next day to euthanize him.  

I don't think I want to see a dying, rigid goat ever again.

In other news, the bitch that embezzled from the company I work for was remanded into custody last Thursday.  Her bail was set at 517k.  If she wants to post bail, she has to prove that the money is clean.  I don't think she'll be able to post it, tbh.  When this is all said and done, I hope she, at least, gets a year in jail.  We'll see.

It's a pretty day today."

"event","Wendy's is my favorite fast food joint.  I seriously love their food.

Anyway, yesterday I was at Wendy's getting dinner for Skye and I (I had rehearsal so I didn't have time to make dinner) and this convertible silver Audi drives up behind me.  I start mildly freaking out because it is the exact same car that our company's embezzler drove.  But, seriously, this is Santa Barbara and practically everyone drives an Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Volvo or Saab.  But anyway, I look to see who's driving and I swear the person had the same bone structure and her nose.  She had sunglasses on, so I couldn't see totally who it was but it looked a lot like her.  I told my coworker and she said I should have put my car in reverse and rammed into her.  Haha.  I'm not violent, though.  

I got my burger (without the bun) and everything was right with the world.

Last Saturday, Skye and I did something fun.  A colleague of his graduated with her PhD so she had a party on this thing called the <a href=""http://www.out2seesb.com/"">Land Shark</a>.  Funnily enough, when I think of ""Land Shark"", I think of that SNL skit from long ago (""...candygram.."").  But anyway, that's beside the point.  There were two kegs of beer on the darn thing, so you can imagine that everyone was feeling pretty good.  After we took a tour of the harbor, we went up and down Downtown Santa Barbara.  So pretty!  This is when everyone began doing keg stands.  Skye did his first keg stand.  I'm so proud!  *sniff*  After that, we went to El Torito and had a pretty nice Mexican buffet dinner.  There was a scary moment when someone started having a seizure, but overall it was a fun night.  

In less exciting news, I think I'm getting sick again.  I've got a scratchy throat.  Bah!  Hopefully it's just a mild thing that I got because of being out in the cold sea air.  

Lots of work to be done.  I should get back to it now."

"event","Did anyone hear Christian Bale's rant?  That mofo is cuh-razy!!  However, I couldn't stop laughing because of his accent.  I know, I know, it's rude to laugh at the way someone talks, but his Welsh accent kills me.  Especially since it seemed like his real accent was fading away and giving into his American one.

"event","A little before noon, one of my coworkers got off the phone with a customer and asked us, ""Does anyone smell smoke?"".  We all sniffed the air and we answered with no...but then a few seconds later we were, like, um YES.  We looked outside and the air was smoky and it smelled like something was burning close by.  Keep in mind we are enclosed in a canyon about a mile in a half in.  We ran out to see if we could see where the source of the fire was, but all we could see was thick smoke.  

Another coworker called Exxon Mobile because they have a plant in the next canyon over.  They weren't answering which made us go into a slight panic.  My boss's son decided to go drive toward the entrance of the canyon to see if we could get out, but someone in a helicopter told him to turn back.  So now I'm thinking that we're in deep shit because the only way out now is to go deeper into the canyon and all the way around.  

THEN, our phone starts ringing weirdly and it turns out it was a reverse 911 call.  The fire department was calling us to let us know that we might have to evacuate.  I have to say it was kind of exciting, but I was worried that we would have trouble getting out.  So the next few minutes consisted of us grabbing some personal stuff, important documents for the company and some personal photos and things for our bosses (they are out of town).  

We waited anxiously a few minutes more and then the fire marshal called and said the fire was out and we weren't in any danger.  *phew*  It turns out some idiots made a fire on the campgrounds on the beach and I guess it got out of control.  

So be careful with those fires, kids!"

"event","It's almost Friday!  Woohoo!  In celebration, I'm making a list of ""older"" guys that I'd hit.  

1.  <b>David Tennant, 37</b>
Um, yah, I'd hit it with the fury of a thousand suns.  I can't get over how attractive this man is to me.  <lj user=""phantomviola""> and I already decided that if we ever came across him in person, we'd probably kill each other and/or end up in jail for hurting someone...maybe even David Tennant himself in an attempt to jump his bones.

brb, ovaries exploding.  


2.  <b>Hugh Laurie, 49</b>
I know, I know, I'm only 26.  But seriously, he's really attractive.  Maybe I'm just attracted to House?  I dunno.  I heard him say in an interview that women might be attracted to House because he's damaged and someone to ""fix"".  He may be right, but I still totally would.  
Heyyyy there, Hugh.

This show won the jackpot in terms of hot dudes!  In fact, this show probably has the hottest cast on tv.  No joke.

4.  <b>Gary Oldman, 50</b>
Part of what makes him so attractive is his talent.  He is such a talented actor.  I love pretty much love everything I've seen him in.

"event","This post is about to get emo and snarky.  Please leave now if you want to avoid the drama.  I just need a space to shed a virtual tear or two.

Everyone knows the economy is shit right now.  Utter and total shit.  Well, the company I work for is not immune to said shittery.  We were down in sales (like, A LOT) and now we have to cut costs wherever we can.  Some of the changes that were announced last month was the cut of our gas allowance.  I work way the hell out in the middle of the nowhere so the gas allowance was an incentive to get people to work out here.  $150 bucks extra a month.  SWEET!  Now it's gone.  This morning, our controller took us aside and said that they were cutting our workday to 8 - 4 instead of 8 - 5.  Five hours less a week...which means 20 hours less a month...means I'm losing lots of money.  That's not all, folks!  The company used to cover our medical/dental/vision insurance up to $400. This is very unusual as most companies only pay up to 50%.  The way it was here, I wasn't paying ANYTHING for health insurance. Now, they've cut it down to $200.  That means I'll have to pay some money for insurance.  

Basically, that long paragraph means I'm fucked.  Wellll, I'm not totally fucked.  I have managed to save a lot of money over the two+ years I've been here.   I guess I'm worried about my expendable cash.  I can pay my half of the rent and as long as I keep my credit card bill to under $400/month then I'm ok.  I mean, who spends $400 of useless shit a month anyway?  Not me.  Well, most of the time.  

I want to look for another job...see what's out there but honestly, I don't think I'm going to find anything better that pays what I'm being paid at at the moment.  

I am thankful that they did this instead of firing three people, though.  I'm almost positive I would have been one of those people."

I'm going to miss DT's expressiveness, haha.

"event","I hope everyone had a great Christmas/Hanukkah/whatever you celebrate and a happy new year!  

My time in El Paso flew by so fast.  It always does, though. I was able to spend a lot of time with my family which was my main priority.  It was wonderful just to hang out with them and eat, haha.  My stomach got so flabby!!!  Skye and I also got to hang out with his little brother and sister.  It kills me to see them growing up so fast...we miss them so much!  

The only bad thing was that my mysterious stomach ailment was in FULL FORCE practically the entire time I was in EP.  I'm starting to think I have an ulcer.  Ugh, I need to see a specialist.  I am in pain about 50% of the entire day every day.  It could also be attributed to the insane amount of bread and wheat products that I consumed...

Anyway, so onto my presents!  I got lots of clothes, shoes, some dvds, TARDIS usb hub, a clothes steamer (I hate ironing), LOST season 4 (omg, this show has taken over my life), a PostSecret book (thanks Mari!!!) and what else?  Oh yah, a Wii!!!!  Skye and I were also able to get our hands on MarioKart so we are now Wii junkies.  I love it sfm. 

The last day Skye and I were there was my mom's 50th birthday.  We took her out to eat and then we had cake back at home.  She is having major issues about turning 50, but I keep telling her that 50 is not old at all!  It is hardly what it used to be.  Yeesh, mothers.  

I went back to work today.  It was absolutely dead.  I was the only staff member there along with the family members.  I knew I was back when my bosses were talking about black tongues, poop pills and then telling me to ""get the fuck out of"" there when it was 2:30 because it was so dead.  I work in a crazy place.

Ok, reflections on 2008:
<lj-cut text=""follow me into the cut"">

Overall, 2008 was made of suckage.  My aunt died in May and it completely changed my family's situation.  She was suffering so much.  Her death made my family so vulnerable and I regret that I could not be there for them for more than a few days.  Nevertheless, they got through it, thank God.  Then, during the summer I started noticing that my stomach was not right.  I get episodes of cramping, nausea, panic, cold sweating. I went to see the doctor, but all tests came out normal.  wtf stomach?  Now, it's only getting worse...

There was some good stuff, though.  First of all, Skye.  My hubby has been with me through thick and thin for almost 10 years now.  2008 was no different.  He's my partner in crime!  Also, I discovered <i>LOST</i>.  This show is so good.  It's smart and interesting and everything a show should be.  <i>Doctor Who</i> is also my life.  I can't even say how much I love this show!!!  It definitely got better in 2008! 

Also, I'm grateful for the friends I was able to keep another year.  It's not easy with me being all the way out here.  I'm grateful to God for keeping my mommy, aunt and grandma safe for another year (and the rest of my family of course).  

It was a crazy year!  

</lj-cut>

I'm not going to make any new year's resolutions.  I'm not going to pretend to try to stop smoking a cigarette once in a while or biting my nails.  Ain't going to happen.  Oh well.  Bring it on, 2009!!"

"event","I never drink coffee and I do not consume a lot of caffeine.  But this morning, my bosses were going out to get a quick breakfast and asked if any of us wanted anything.  My coworkers and I were being brats and asked for an assorted number of things and I nonchalantly asked for a frappuccino.  Well, I've been sipping it for a past hour or so and I feel like I want to build a house.  WTFFFF???!!!!!

Someone save me from this caffeine induced high."

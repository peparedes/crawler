i need to be better about punctuation and grammar.  i need to think about things more.  last night i was in bed trying to make a definitive decision on my stance on punctuation.  there are more things i need to examine, but i should at least refresh myself with the basics.  what would it hurt?  semicolons and commas and splitting and splicing and so on.

i have a 20 page paper due soon.  sometime this week, not sure when.  i haven't started, haven't even decided a topic.  also a group project i have yet to contribute to is wednesday.  noone's contributed though, just sent emails about contributing.  it is a project i could very easily do alone, would prefer to do alone.  some read/response things.  a final.  that's that, one semester left.  i should start applying for jobs.  i don't feel ready."

"event","been thinking about jealousy, about all the times i was jealous. trying to seperate the irrational jealousies from the rational ones. little tiny things like online girls and phone calls behind my back and relationships untold. because it was taking something of himself and giving it to someone else. maybe it is trivial but obviously he had formed some sort of bond with this person and i was told nothing, it didn't sit right. there's a difference between meaningless online flirtation and having someone know you, your daily ins and outs and thoughts and sharing. it's different, i didn't like it, i didn't like not being told.

and sharing stuff with others that you used to share with me. 

ann and i have talked some about men/women friendships. how to us what crosses the line is when an emotional bond is formed, and to some it only crosses the line with physical/sexual interaction.

anytime i would try to talk about jealousy he would immediately yell. immediately. i wanted so many times to just let him know what i was feeling, when i felt it, how it felt, what i was thinking, but it was never a situation that i could. i always had to go into the defensive. maybe he thought i was confronting him. attacking him. maybe that was how i approached it. afterwards i always strangely felt better for at least getting a little of it out of me even though it seemed to make him hate me little by little.

we should have talked more, he should have let me talk to him about it."

"event","today is the day that schubert died.  if it were 1828 and it were today then today would be the day that schubert would be dying and soon dead.  schubert, 31 year old schubert, lying in his bed possibly, and dying.


<i>an extraordinary climax conveying madness at the realization of rejection and imminent death</i>

friday night i went with ann and her friend laura to a show at the art shack.  i met two dogs and ate two round pieces of chocolate and touched one 1900's thomas hardy edition in laura's beautiful house.  at the gallery, the store, the place, i mostly felt like i was fumbling around touching chairs made from sparkleberry trees and glancing at paintings of chickens and dead trucks and batik fish pillows.  ann and i went to see factotum at the nick.  it was 9 o'clock and we shared a box of popcorn. i thought about the time when it was adam sitting next to me.  i liked when he hit her and i liked when he gave her his shoes in the middle of the sidewalk.  i liked lili taylor's barrel gut and hip bones and matt dillon beautiful even when attempting not to be.  it was slow and it was depressing and it was empty and it was good.  afterward we went to the whig and i liked the whig.  i drank more than i should have and maybe i was a little obnoxious, i don't know, but afterward i felt a little obnoxious. i sat in ann's woven chair, drank pomegranate soda, and ate mixed nuts trying to guess each one by their taste, trying to sober up a little.  the macadamia gives itself away too easily, first off on size alone.

<i>let's face it.  you don't need me, and i don't need you.</i>

sometimes i just sit in the bath and cry and cry.  palms over face.

Gertrude Stein, ""Reflections on the Atomic Bomb"" (1946) 

<i>They asked me what I thought of the atomic bomb. I said I had not been able to take any interest in it.

I like to read detective and mystery stories. I never get enough of them but whenever one of them is or was about death rays and atomic bombs I never could read them. What is the use, if they are really as destructive as all that there is nothing left and if there is nothing there nobody to be interedted and nothing to be interested about. If they are not as destructive as all that then they are just a little more or less destructive than other things and that means that in spite of all destruction there are always lots left on this earth to be interested or to be willing and the thing that destroys is just one of the things that concerns the people inventing it or the people starting it off, but really nobody else can do anything about it so you have to just live along like always, so you see the atomic [bomb] is not at all interesting, not any more interesting than any other machine, and machines are only interesting in being invented or in what they do, so why be interested. I never could take any interest in the atomic bomb, I just couldn't any more than in everybody's secret weapon. That it has to be secret makes it dull and meaningless. Sure it will destroy a lot and kill a lot, but it's the living that are interesting not the way of killing them, because if there were not a lot left living how could there be any interest in destruction. Alright, that is the way I feel about it. They think they are interested about the atomic bomb but they really are not not any more than I am. Really not. They may be a little scared, I am not so scared, there is so much to be scared of so what is the use of bothering to be scared, and if you are not scared the atomic bomb is not interesting. Everybody gets so much information all day long that they lose their common sense. They listen so much that they forget to be natural. This is a nice story.</i>"

"event","today i baked chocolate chip cookies for my new neighbor and put them on her doorstep in an orange gift bag along with a candle and a room spray and a note saying welcome to being my neighbor, etc. she knocked on my door and said thank you and we went through introductions at last.  i also found out why my internet connection hasn't been much of a connection at all.

saturday i cried and then decided not to think about anything so i stopped.  i went to ann's house and we ate at el burrito and had beer and it was still too early so we drove around and then walked up and down gervais looking into the windows of stores and then went to the art bar.  she pointed out a boy with sideburns glancing at me and said i don't know about this rachael i am used to being the cute one and i said i'm not used to it and don't think i am with her halo of golden hair and sad blue eyes next to me, how could i be.  i am oblivious to glances and never know unless it is blatant, but also at this moment i am not caring and don't want to think about it i am far too sad and it is far too soon with my heart still feeling involved.  bald cynical hipster extraordinaire struck up conversation with ann and his name was jon but i don't know i just kept thinking his name was bob because he seemed like a bob, but bob is the name of her ex.  i didn't really want to talk to anyone and he said i was very zen on planet rachael and i just smiled and nodded and stared away while they talked about local galleries and art and over the music i couldnt really hear anyway.  the bartender reminded me of someone i knew the way his smile was all in the corners of his mouth and the guy on the other side of me smelled of body odor and eventually the smoke was burning my eyes.  ann went to the restroom and i felt as if i had to talk in her absence so we meanly made fun of plastic faced girls with botoxed foreheads across the bar.  someone passing ran a cigarette across my back and it burned but i didn't mind, i didn't feel it much, like a sleepy mosquito or a lazy bee.  it was crowded so we got up, the three of us, and listened to the band for a while and the black light showed all the lint on my black dress which i mistook for chips of paint wondering where they came from.  ann and i left and walked to her car in the rain and my hair curled in the back a little.  we ate leftover chips and spinach dip and the rain came down harder when i jumped out of her car and into my own.

i went home and it was empty but i was ok and i went to sleep but adam messaged me and it read 'i miss you' and twice it sent and then i cried, a little."

i don't think i am feeling anything really.  he has not left yet so i have not completely hurt yet.  i mean i am hurting but with him still around it does not quite feel real yet.  there is a feeling of finality stepping out of the bathtub or driving to work, but at night i can still feel his warmth through the quilts and when he sleeps he unknowingly throws an arm over me.

hate sharing laughter and moments, we are still sharing laughter and moments, and suddenly feeling a panic of this is the last and it is ending ending ending.

hate feeling like he still loves me, like there's still too much right to call it all wrong.  hate that when i asked him if there was anything i could say to make him change his mind he said ""i don't know"" instead of ""no.""

I've been sitting around in my bathrobe not sleeping not eating. Just crying. I feel terrible. 

Who else knows me this way? It is a lonely thought.

He says we can still be good friends and stay close. 

I think of him moving on with someone else and I don't think that I can handle knowing it. I am such a jealous one, always. 

I don't know how to switch those emotions off. 

I feel like I should try to talk him into changing his mind and wishing there was some magical thing I could say that would make him not give up.  I hate feeling so desperate. I hate feeling like I'm losing him. Like I've lost him.

I feel helpless.

""umm it was funny""  and ""frat boys...highschool boys......boys""  that's the jist.

jon lovitz at the comedy house.  i didn't realize how painful it is to sit through unfunny opening acts.  not only because the jokes are bad but also because how terrible it is to watch someone in the midst of their failure.  jon was good though.  not crazily good, but good.

then we arcade bowled at state street but it sucked.  sometimes the crowd their really sucks sometimes i hate it.  we drove to rookies and arcade bowled there.  and then we spent the rest of the night bowling against two other guys.  one outback bartender and one manager of chili's.

i don't really know what i want for myself right now.  i mean essentially.  i think i mean essentially.

i liked it when we held hands.

i couldn't bring myself to make a decision over purses so i got them all. 

some days i feel this way some days i feel that.

i have put myself in a situation.

i want to write someone a letter and tell them how stupid i have been but i can't think of anyone who would want it.

i wonder what the mistake would be.

i am in the passenger seat annoyed when he honks at girls standing on the corner of five points. 

i'm going to do a photo dump on flickr.

i am a little uneasy."

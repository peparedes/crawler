"event","I'm absolutely furious at America. I'm tired of how many emails containing untrue information about the current political situation, laws that are attempting to be past, and general shit about the government that are being shoved through the system. I hate seeing people who are in my generation thinking they have any idea what is going on when most of them are too jaded to understand what socialism REALLY is.

They don't read about socialized healthcare but regurgitate what they've been told by their friends. Why don't you go read what the proposal specifies before you villify it and Obama? I'm not saying that everything is going according to plan, but if you consider what a shit pile our economy is in right now after the Bush administration, can you blame the new administration for struggling a bit? And just so you know -- the debt we're in now was inevitable. The Republicans who are making Obama seem like he's just sucking money from the government don't even know how to fix what they've done.

Everyone who says they're not seeing results from the bailout money? Don't blame the Presidential branch: Your local government is currently holding it. For example: Jacksonville is spending it on roads instead of fixing the fucked mass-transit system that we've got right now.

Seriously, to all of the trust fund babies who have parents who will pay your way through all your papercuts and booboos... Your lives are no more valuable than those of your peers in a lower tax bracket. If I hear one more person say socialism doesn't work, I'd like you to go ahead and look at the economy in the following countries:

Sweden
Denmark
Germany
China

I want you to notice something else: We now owe money to SOCIALIST COUNTRIES because we couldn't stabilize ourselves.

Bitches, plz. Suck a fat dick and learn the reality of the situations before you point fingers and cry. This isn't even about me supporting Obama or being a socialist myself, which I am proud to be a socialist... This is about me saying that you need to get your facts straight before you act like children."

I was cheery and chipper and happy. Went to TSI where Veronica was bartending. She was so energetic tonight and she wants to hang out tomorrow... And it feels good to have someone who I really, genuinely like and think is worthwhile want to hang out WITH ME. Felt inexplicably lonely at random when I suddenly realized the impermanence of love and how fleeting every friendship or relationship I've had thus far has been. Felt completely alone in the world (I guess it was some stupid cliche Ayn Rand moment for lack of better description) and how much I just want someone to tell me they'll be my friend or lover forever JUST TO SAY IT.

Just because when we're younger, well, forever is such an easy word to say. It's such a comforting, beautiful thing to say to our best friends or family members or first boyfriends.

Why can't we say that now? Even though we're fully aware at how ambiguous the future truly is, please... Someone just tell me it and even if it is in that moment -- <b>mean it</b>.

I'm sure tomorrow at Mike's party, I'll be overjoyed and manic. Way to go, uterus."

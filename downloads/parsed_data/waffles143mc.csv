"event","<P><STRONG>Love requires four elements: Responsibility, care, respect, and knowledge. The former two elements are independent, as are the latter two. (In actuality they are all independent).</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Responsibility and care: Responsibility in the case of loves refers not to the standard definition of duty, but instead to commitment. When I concern myself with another person's welfare, when I care about them and feel responsibility for them, I thus demonstrate my love for them. In a practical sense, if I were to say that I love flowers, but I am seen&nbsp;to neglect watering the flowers, it would be hard to believe that I love them. On the other hand, by feeling responsible for helping the flower grow and by caring for it, I thus demonstrate my love for the flower. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Respect and knowledge: Respect is not fear and awe. It is based on the latin root ""respicere,"" to look at. By seeing a person for what they are, not for what I want them to be or for what I think they should be, I respect them. This respect comes from knowledge. The more I can know and understand a person, know what motivates them to do what they do and say what they say or know what they feel, the more I am able to respect them.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Erotic love: Contrary to popular belief, erotic love is not based on sexuality. Erotic love, unlike brotherly love, is exclusive. We have brotherly love for all man, and we share motherly love with those who depend on us and those on whom we depend, but erotic love is exclusive between two people only. It is the need for fusion, for union with one other person. It is based on one premise: That I love from the essence of my being, and experience the other person in the essence of their being.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>However, most importantly, love is based on action. By giving care and respect, by seeking knowledge and by commiting ourselves to others do we love them. Love is a mix of action and passion. By giving to one person, the giver is actually giving and the receiver is passively receiving. In order to share love, one must both give (an action) and receive (a passion). Without action there is no passion.</STRONG></P>"

"event","<P><STRONG>The older I get the less I want to be here in this world. What disturbs me is that most people seem to be blissfully ignorant with the fact that just about everything relating to this world is dark and twisted. Is happiness just a frame of mind? I'm interested to see what will happen when and after I die. Nobody can say. That is one unknown that will never be known until you die. I have a strong feeling that there is more than just life in this world. I believe in much higher powers that span space, time and other known and unknown barriers. Will we take memories of our life in this world with us if we continue to exist in some form in the future after we die? Or will we only take with us lessons learned during our existence in this world? Maybe we wont take anything at all with us. But something from our existence in this world will move on after we die. That I truly believe.&nbsp; *Fukai kotoba means ""deep thoughts"" in Japanese.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Humans are simple but desperately want to believe they are complicated and advanced. Really, how different are rats, spiders, ants, elephants, wolves, whales, etc...? &nbsp;We all eat, sleep, make babies, build homes, fight, play and die. Do they exploit others of their kind to the same degree that humans do? Of course not. Animals, insects and the like are not stupid enough to be willing to work for another unless it near equally benefits themselves or the group as a whole. Do they ever gather more than they will ever need, far beyond storing food? Do they kill others of their kind for no reason? It's interesting how they instinctively know how to keep a balance with nature yet humans override their own instinct and create imbalance. Maybe humans are so simple and under-developed that they have not yet learned how to listen to their own instincts as the rest of life on earth has. After all, animals and insects have been around far longer than humans. Humans seem to ignore the idea that 'just because you can does not mean you should.' The sad reality is that animals, insects, fish, etc. often take better care of their kind than humans do. We have a lot to learn from wildlife about loyalty, commitment, work ethic, honesty, family values and teamwork - all of which seem more important than stockpiling more money than one could ever use, attaining 3% more market share, putting a robot on Mars and worrying about what your neighbor is doing. I've never heard a dying person say, ""I wish I spent more time at the office and fighting with people.""</STRONG></P>"

"event","<P><STRONG>I have survived many aspects of domestic violence from an abusive father - verbal, emotional, and physical, plus intimidation and threats. When we left, I was subjected to physical abuse and lived in fear for my life, my family, and friends for a couple of years. Leaving that abusive environment and having the opportunity to heal has been one of the most gratifying things in my life. Moving on means that we regain our self with all of our ideas, thoughts, dreams, desires, and potential to bring true goodness to our families, friends, and everyone around us. Those who supported me have the most sincere gratitude I will ever express to anyone. Domestic violence and abuse is wrong. There is nothing wrong with those of us who have lived it, survived it, and work toward helping to bring societal understanding and change. A survivor has the perspective of undying knowledge on the issue, and is a whole person. I am not going to give you an in depth story about myself. I am&nbsp;a survivor. I was able to get past&nbsp;many tough abusive situations from my father. I kept it private when it was happening. However, if I would have screamed it to anyone who would listen I know in my heart it would have ended much sooner than it did. I also know that I did not deserve any of it! I know all to well hwow horrible it is to be stripped of your pride and self worth, existing day to day with no self esteem and the feeling of being alone to endure such torment. I have probably lived and felt every concievable stage of emotion from sadness to fear to anger... and even denial. There were times when it seemed like there was nothing I could do to make him love me.&nbsp;It was a feeling that, to this day, I will never forget. The pain&nbsp;just drifted&nbsp;over me. The fear of coming home. The fear of what I might see.&nbsp;The pain&nbsp;on my&nbsp;mother's&nbsp;face while she sat back and watched me go through this because there was nothing she could do to help me. It hurt her so much for her to have to endure that kind of pain, watching&nbsp;her child be brutally beaten with whatever object was closest at hand. You don't know what it's like to be screaming at the top of your lungs for help and&nbsp;no one hears you.&nbsp;All the times&nbsp;that the pain was brought to me by his&nbsp;big, rough hands, I survived in my own little happy place but died&nbsp;outside of it. I hated being torn away from my world. It was the only place that I felt at peace.&nbsp;All those times he looked at me,&nbsp;it felt like he was somehow judging me for the little fuck up I was. ""You're a fuck up! That's all you'll ever be! You're not my little girl, you're just some poor little fuck up that I found on the street!"" Fuck you daddy! I don't want to be your little girl! You're nothing to me! I HATE YOU!&nbsp;I&nbsp;hope you rot in hell for all the shit that you put me through! For all the times you hit me! For all the times you let&nbsp;me down! You make me sick! Don't touch me daddy! I don't like it!&nbsp;JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!!&nbsp;I HATE YOU! I SWEAR TO GOD I HATE YOU! HOW THE FUCK COULD YOU DO THIS TO YOUR LITTLE GIRL!! What makes you think it's ok?It's not ok! The pain and resentment was unbearable. But I'm grown up now daddy.&nbsp;Look at what I've become. I'm nothing like you! I'm nothing like you!

"event","<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <STRONG>Individuality is much more valuable than being popular. Believe me, being yourself is much more important than keeping up with trends. If we aren't wourselves, who are we? Who cares if others think you're cool or not? Only you do. So what difference does it make? Be yourself.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone being the same would suck, wouldn't it? Yet, that's what you find in society today. Many people try to keep up with trends, but forget that they are who they are and that that's all they ever need to be. I'm not saying that everyone's like that, but many that I have seen are.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love..... the most questionable thing that I can think of. An interesting thought that someone else brought up to me was that love is most likely different for everyone (even so, love CAN'T be some of the things that I've seen people call it). I'm not really sure how one can define love.... In my opinion, though, love includes, but does not consist of, the following: concern for the other's well-being, a desire to be with that person, and a desire for the other to be happy. Of course, love is used in many ways. Some are deeper than others. Whether you would admit it or not, you love your friends. If not, then it's&nbsp;a safe bet that you're not really their friend. Of course, this isn't the same kind of love that a person might give their family, or possibly their boyfriend/girlfriend..... or even God. The love between boyfriend and girlfriend in high school or earlier tends to just be friendly love, even though it is deeper. True love, as one may call it, could be considered an addition of the desire to spend the rest of one's life with another. As I said before, I'm not sure that I can really define love, but even so, love may just be what truly sets us apart from the animals.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An empty threat means nothing. A fulfilled threat means you're too stupid to come up with something else. Someone asked me, ""Then what should I do if I make a threat?"" My response: ""Why did you have to make a threat in the first place?""</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honesty is the best policy. If this were not so, then why does one not like it when one is lied to?</STRONG></P>"

"event","<P><FONT size=4>I think I'm at a point in my life where I'm beginning to understand what love means. I always used to think that I was incapable of it; that it was something beyond my grasp, beyond any possible comprehension. Because the people I'm supposed to love were always telling me how much I hurt them. But I've realized that I'm very capable of love, it just means something different than I thought it did. Love isn't a duty I have, I can't force myself to love someone just because I'm supposed to. It just so happens that some of the people that I'm ""supposed"" to love have actually earned my love. Or maybe they didn't even do that. Maybe I'm giving love too much credit and it isn't actually as rational as I thought it was. And maybe that's why I've been avoiding it.. I crave control, and perhaps my mind is fully aware of the fact that it has no control over my heart. In a manner of speaking... Still, whether I can control it or not, I find it comforting to know that it's there. I'll probably hurt myself with it, but it's not like you can turn it off. I'm fully prepared to take the bad if it means getting some of the good.</FONT></P>"

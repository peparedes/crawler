"event","There's an Israeli site, called TVNetIL, which allows you to download a lot of Israeli TV Shows. Great, for when you've got neither Yes nor Hot, or you live outside of Israel, and you still want to watch some Israeli series, or shows. I'm not sure how legal the site itself is, but it's a great resource. The site, has the ability to subscribe to various shows, and it will follow new releases of your favorite shows, and will show it on a single page.

I've decided to go a little bit further, and wrote a script that automates the process of downloading from there. <lj-cut text=""Learn more or download..."">The script is written in Python, and wasn't tested on anything other then Debian. The only instructions, are - go to http://www.tvnetil.co.il, register a user, then download the script:

<a href=""http://www.studiosh.com/lj/TVNetIL.tar.gz"">TVNetIL.tar.gz</a>

Or, to get the latest version by SVN, use the following repository:
<code>svn co <a href=""http://nethunter.freedom-prj.org/svn/get_tvnetil/trunk"">nethunter.freedom-prj.org/svn/get_tvnetil/trunk</a> TVNetIL</code>
Untar it wherever you want, then go to the &quot;TVNetIL&quot; folder inside, and edit the CTVNetIL.py file, put in your username/password. The only requirements I know about, are Python (I'm using 2.5), and wget. Any patches or ports to other platforms are welcome. Also, if you think the legality of this script is in question, let me know, and I'll remove it ASAP.

"event","A while ago, I wrote a short tutorial as to how to install the 32-bit Flash on a 64-bit Linux. Well, it's no longer needed, since a couple of days ago, Adobe finally released a 64-bit version of Flash 10 for Linux/Solaris. Available at:

http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplayer10/

This is a prerelease version, so it's a bit slow, and has a bug I've seen with full screen refreshes, but it's much better then before. Yay Adobe.

A Windows version will probably appear sometime soon."

"event","Sometimes in movies, we see how the hero goes to the past, fixes something that's broken in the present, and returns to the present, when everything is suddenly OK.
I don't think any of us would been able to do that. After all, who didn't think about returning to some point in the past, when everything was better and everything was fine, the air was cleaner, and we didn't have the problems we currently have.
It seems natural to me, that given the chance to return to the past to any point they choose, most people will just stay there. They will quickly forget about their mission, about the ""present"", and about the ""time space continuum"" or whatever. They will just stay there, trying to repeat those precious familiar moments that have long ago gone."

And as we know Tim Burton, it will be a darker, more thought provoking version, then the previous Disney versions, which Burton called ""just a series of weird events"". The movie is currently filming, with Mia Wasikowska as Alice, Johnny Depp as The Mad Hatter, and Helena Bonham Carter rumoured as the Red Queen.

"event","Since Adobe nor Macromedia before them, never bothered to release a proper 64-bit release of their Flash player, users of 64-bit operation systems such as Windows XP 64-bit, are stuck without Flash players, unless they use a 32-bit browser. Thankfully, under Linux, there's a workaround.
<lj-cut text=""Read the instructions..."">The following instructions are tested under Debian Lenny x86_64, but should work under Ubuntu x86_64 as well. Here's how it goes:
<strong>Note: This doesn't yet work with Flash Player 10, so make sure you download Flash Player 9.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Become root
$ su</li>
<li>Make sure nspluginwrapper is installed
$ sudo apt-get install nspluginwrapper</li>
<li>Download the Flash player from Adobe's site
http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/current/install_flash_player_9_linux.tar.gz</li>
<li>Go to the downloaded folder, and extract the files
$ tar -zxvf install_flash_player_9_linux.tar.gz</li>
<li>Go to the extracted folder
$ cd install_flash_player_9_linux</li>
<li>Make a folder for your 32-bit plugins
$ mkdir ~/.mozilla/plugins32/</li>
<li>Copy the actual plugin to the new folder
$ cp libflashplayer.so ~/.mozilla/plugins32</li>
<li>Run the nspluginwrapper on it
$ nspluginwrapper -i ~/.mozilla/plugins32/libflashplayer.so</li>
<li>Make sure you pass nspluginwrapper the full path, as it doesn't know how to parse relative paths. (In the above example, the shell expands the ~/ to your home folder by itself)</li>
<li>Restart Iceweasel / Firefox</li>
</ul>
Flash Player 10 has a different set of dependencies, which I wasn't yet able to resolve and so, was unable to get Flash Player 10 to work this way.

<strong>Information for Debian Etch</strong>
In case you're using Etch, you'll need to install the nspluginwrapper package by hand. It's available here:
http://packages.debian.org/etch-backports/amd64/nspluginwrapper/download
First, become root (su) and then:
<ul>
<li>Go to the folder where you downloaded it, and install it
$ dpkg -i nspluginwrapper_0.9.91.5-2~bpo40+1_amd64.deb
</ul>or<ul>
<li>Edit the sources.list file
$ nano /etc/apt/sources.list</li>
<li>Add the Etch-backports repository
Add the line
deb http://www.backports.org/debian etch-backports main contrib
to the sources.list file</li>
<li>Update the deb repository
apt-get update</li>
</ul>And then the above ""apt-get install"" instructions will work for you.</lj-cut>"

"event","I've found this great article, which shows the Top 10 commercials made by movie directors.
Most notable for me, were the Ridley Scott's 1984 commercial, which is amazing in how close, yet how distant it is from the environment depicted in Blade Runner, and the Michael Gondry's Smirnoff commercial, which is very engaging and sweeping you with it. For me, it was news that Gondry used the bullet-time effect only a year before The Matrix was released, with Manex doing bullet-time there. I guess, since The Matrix was in production for 6 years, and Manex showed the effect years before, it isn't clear who was influenced by whom, but it was nice to see another piece of this effect's history showing through.

The clowns happily gives the dog to one of the children. The child, in his torn, plays with the dog, and then it pops, making a large resounding ""boom"" sound. Now consider this:

Once in a while he looks<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; around, stops, takes a couple of deep breaths, and keeps on<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clicking.<br /> <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the camera moves away from him, we see the Sims green<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mark above his head. After a couple of moments, a sims menu<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appears over him, and the option ""Use Computer"" is getting<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clicked, and we understand he is a Sim of a kind in the real<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; world.<br /><br /></div>"

"event","There are those times, when you enter a situation, knowing everything there is to know about it. You have it all figured out. You know where you want to go from here, and you know how you're going to get there. Everything is so obvious, and so correct, and it all goes so well... And then all of a sudden, something changes. A small parameter that you didn't take into account. A tiny boolean fragment of your reality, which changes white into black, good into evil, and your perfect situation and perfect path, into a perfect disaster. And the most unfortunate part of it all, is that you never know if it's really a disaster, because maybe, just maybe, what it morphed into, is what it was supposed to be in the first place?
Or maybe, that change, that tiny little bit change, is a part of somebody elses perfect situation. Somebody's own internal force, in whos reality, the success of your situation, would clash.

I want to call her, and ask her ""I worship you, for being THAT. But I don't want to be a part of it. Have you seen Cabaret?"""

"event","I've been thinking about this idea for a while. I have noticed that anything I plan in my head, doesn't work out.
Down to the point of out of 2 possible ways a single thing can work out, having 2 different plans for when they go wrong, what actually happens is a very very twisted mix of one of them, just so it won't make sense."

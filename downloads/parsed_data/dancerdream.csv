"event","I had to go to the stupis doctors cause my stumach was like totally killing and i told my mum.
I think she knows im bulimic, i wonder if she'll tell my mum.
This pills she gave me for it that i  have to take like 2 times a day and they make me want to vomit.

Im like 99.99 lb now and 45.2kgs .
I had to miss out on ballet im really pissed off.
If my stomach doesent get better they'll have to do all these tests(then they will really find out im bulimic).
I spose i got it from being around my mums friend that lived with us , she was bulimic and a compulsive exerciser.
She's recovered now and found a guy who likes (big women) i just think he's desperate no offence ."

"event","remember when the love song
was a song about love
before it was buried beneath the faces of the world
remember when 
the wind carried kites
and didn't carry away friends
that world is stil there
where the sun shines bright
and all eyes are those of children
to a place where the love song lives
come with me
come with me

"event","6 months till the past is gone
running on the water
o holy is thou that burns to the core
love pulls at our hearts
even without, 
we are loved
we are loved
can you keep the peace still
a ripple in a pond 
disturbance on the surface
so calm in the depths
dive in and breath deep
and live here with me

"event","I'm for the war in Iraq, but only as long as it successfully removes Saddam Hussein from power.  I don't understand why the USA gets more bad press about this war than Hussein did when he paved Kurdish people into the road, gassed his own people (who later died from cancer caused by the gas) and when he came into power, called out the names of everyone in the Iraqi parliament who just might disagree, and had them leave the room to get shot.  I'm sorry, but Hussein is far worse than the USA, and I don't care what the French say.

Anyone who accidentally used his left hand over the right side of his chest when saying the pledge of allegiance is an idiot.  Some of you know what I'm saying, others do not."

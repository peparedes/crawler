"event","The Station
by Robert J. Hastings

Tucked away in our subconscious minds is an idyllic vision. We see ourselves on a long, long trip that almost spans the continent. We're traveling by passenger train, and out the windows we drink in the passing scene of cars on nearby highways, of children waving at a crossing, of cattle grazing on a distant hillside, of smoke pouring from a power plant, of row upon row of corn and wheat, of flatlands and valleys, of mountains and rolling hills, of biting winter and blazing summer and cavorting spring and docile fall.

But uppermost in our minds is the final destination. On a certain day at a certain hour we will pull into the station. There sill be bands playing, and flags waving. And once we get there so many wonderful dreams will come true. So many wishes will be fulfilled and so many pieces of our lives finally will be neatly fitted together like a completed jigsaw puzzle. How restlessly we pace the aisles, damning the minutes for loitering ... waiting, waiting, waiting, for the station.

However, sooner or later we must realize there is no one station, no one place to arrive at once and for all. The true joy of life is the trip. The station is only a dream. It constantly outdistances us.

""When we reach the station, that will be it !"" we cry. Translated it means, ""When I'm 18, that will be it ! When I buy a new 450 SL Mercedes Benz, that will be it ! When I put the last kid through college, that will be it ! When I have paid off the mortgage, that will be it ! When I win a promotion, that will be it ! When I reach the age of retirement, that will be it ! I shall live happily ever after !""

Unfortunately, once we get it, then it disappears. The station somehow hides itself at the end of an endless track.

""Relish the moment"" is a good motto, especially when coupled with Psalm 118:24: ""This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it."" It isn't the burdens of today that drive men mad. Rather, it is regret over yesterday or fear of tomorrow. Regret and fear are twin thieves who would rob us of today.

So, stop pacing the aisles and counting the miles. Instead, climb more mountains, eat more ice cream, go barefoot oftener, swim more rivers, watch more sunsets, laugh more and cry less. Life must be lived as we go along. The station will come soon enough."

I might get fired from my job. haha i know that doesent sound like a good thing but there is a story behind it. there is this other kid that workes there(matt). he's an 18 year old dropout who acts like a 3  year old. so everytime i work with him i have to basically babysit him. its so annying. and he makes drug deals in the parking lot among other stuff. so i wrote a letter to my boss saying its either me or him.  i dont know what will happen but eh i can always find another job i guess.  

i dont know how i can just forget about some stuff like it never happened. well i mean not like that but i just get into a different mode of life and forget about someone that i really was starting to like more than a friend. but ow well i seem to do that a lot. and no brian its not a guy. 

as far as gayness goes i have to do pit orchestra. well like i said i think gayness explains it."

Shayna-  i met her in 9th grade when she sat behind me in mrs. aldrige's class.  its not like we were ever good friends but i  always looked forward to coming to class to talk to her.  mrs. aldrige always got mad at us but ow well.  and...ok you might think im a total dork for telling you this story but anyways.... she  would always put her legs on mine and mess with my hair in class....and back then and now i guess...that was as close as i got to being close to a girl.


Krystal- I never really knew her or talked to her.  the only thing i ever did with her was a 7th grade project for mr anderson's class.  she was the kooles though because she invited us all over to her house to work on it but i couldent go cuz of something that i cant remeber.

Paul, your subconscious mind is driven most by Reserve

You approach the world with reserve because unconsciously, and perhaps consciously, you like to be in control. You keep your emotions to yourself and you may seem mysterious or enigmatic to others.

You're often very cautious about truly expressing yourself. Even people who have known you for some time may find it hard to get close to you.

Your psyche is very deep and rich; the more you learn about it, the more you will understand who you really are."

"event","yay...today was a good day. everything just seemed to go pretty well. it was freekin halarious at lunch peter kim karate chopped a mechanical pencil in half. it was awesome. the whole table couldent stop laughing for like 5 minutes. i guess its probobly one of those things where you had to be there for it to be funny.  my dad adjusted the timing on my car a little so it runs better and it sounds more agressive at idle. im happy about that cuz i took it up to like 4500 rpm and it dident complain like it used to... so yay."

"event","well today was another normal day. except the stupid fire alarm went off like 10 freekin times. that was annoying as hell. well normally it wouldent be but on crutches its a pain in the butt. i dont mean to sound like im complaining but well...i m i guess.  so there was a bad exaust leak in my car and i cant exactly tighten the headers myself cuz i kinda cant do it on crutches. but anyways so my dad took the car today to fix it and when i came home there was a bunch of parts everywhere. i was like ah crap what now. appartenly the exaust leak wasent from the headers being loose but they got to hot and it burned a  hole in them. not good. so he had to go buy new ones.  just incase i havent stated it already...crutches suck. like really bad....as in really bad.    And what makes theese stupid crutches worse is that i wanna ask this girl to homecoming but i cant cuz i cant dance!"

"event","hmm well it seems i havent updated this in about 3 months...ow well. new things:i got to play in a varsity football game, that was great fun and then i broke my leg. my band had a show in las vegas and at the marquee theater. other than that life has been pretty normal.  school is alright this year but its nothing exciting. orchestra is actually fun this year. i was going to ask the one girl from orch to homecoming but then i kinda broke my leg and that killed that. oh yeah speaking of broken legs....they hurt. oh i got a story......( after i broke my leg i had a show with my band that night at the marquee theater and it was a big show so i went. i had to play sitting down cuz well...my leg was broken. so then when i come home one of my friends friends imed me and was like  i quote ""I thought it was so funny when you came on stage with a broken leg and had to play sitting down!"" but i guess she's right i mean its halarious that i cant play football for the rest of the season or even walk. ) ok that was my story. so yeah i guess thats it."

"event","i'v had lots of stuff going on this summer.  First off is football. every weekday 7-9 and then we have passing league on thursdays and tuesdays.  there are a bunch of sophmores in there that are really weak and i look at them and wanna make fun of them but them i remeber that i was that weak when i was that old.  the band is going good.  cept for we played at the this battle of the bands thing and the hardrock caffe. we made it to the finals after like 4 shows and out of 60 bands there were 5 of us left. but the guy who runs it is the biggest slime ball you'll ever meet.  so it was a set up. the had already chosen the band that was going to win.  so that was kind of a screw job.  On friday me and my dad were at a car show and this guy comes up to us asking if we want a new  pair of ceramic headers for 100.  that is a really good price consittering they are 250+ from the store.  so we are going to go out there this weekend to look at them.  oh and i was in my car today...i just picked up my sister from cheer and was coming home and there was this guy in a 5.0 red mustang.  so he jumped forward a few times so i decided to show him who's boss. so we went from about 30 -55 and i beat him by a little more than a car length. so then he wanted to go again. so we were going about 30 again and i went   and was pulling away when he used his nitrous and then caught up and was right next to me untill we let off at 80.  he was kool though. but i would say thats pretty good consittering he used a shot of nitrous. if i had some better gears then i would have won. but ow well we were side by side. but i beat him the first time when he wasent spraying."

"event","is it wrong to be honest with people? i mean i know there are some exceptions like when a pregnant lady asks you if she looks big you say no...but i mean other than that.  cuz if ur not completely honest with someone then well i dunno where im goin with this....but today i had to clean and that was a pain in the butt.  it was a good day i guess...so i kinda did nothing untill like 9 then i went to chili's with kori..and now im here...sitting in the computer chair typing in this journal.  i also realized that you shouldent stop talking to  a person for one of their bad habits...even if they are really bad but knowing that ur probobly never gonna talk to that person again just because of some stupid thing that happened is kinda depressing.  but they probobly think im a crazy weird freak so i guess it just works out the way it is supposed to.  i need a beer."

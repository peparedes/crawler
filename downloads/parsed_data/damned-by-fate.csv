"event","The Dead Faith<br> 

She made a little shadow-hidden grave,<br>
  The day Faith died;<br>
Therein she laid it, heard the clod's sick fall,<br>
  And smiled aside-<br>
""If less I ask,"" tear blind she mocked, ""I may be less denied.""<br>
<br>
She set a rose to blossom in her hair,<br>
  The day Faith died-<br>
""Now glad,"" she said, ""and free at last, I go,<br>
  And life is wide.""<br>
But through long nights she stared into the dark,<br>
  And knew she lied.<br>

"event","so here i am i let the entire summer go by, huge happenings go by and i dont even bother updating my lj, what kinda internet junkie am i? anyways so mike left...long time ago havnt talked to him so i guess its over between me and him, so i was at a party a little while ago and i hooked up with a guy, we went on a date and....to be frank it sucked. the guy was nice we had good convo it shoulda been fun but it wasnt. i didnt feel that attached to mike or even that close to him but he made me happy. i look back at myself the past year or so, all my writings and my few updates and damn im depressing. i dont mean to be such a feel sorry for myself-goth-depressing chick but i cant help it. i really turned into a sensitive little bitch over the last year mostly. i can remember just living to live, not thinking about stuff to much and just living but then i started thinking too much and look what happend! i knew i shoulda never started reading. anyways for some reason tonight i feel different, i feel like my good ole self again and i dont know why. i dont know y i got so depressed, i dont know why i got so goth, i dont know why what happened with mike happened but it did and after the initial shock i think it all turned out for the better. school will be starting soon and lord only knows how im going to make it through another year at freak high without killing someone, but ill have my car so at least i can run away after i commit numerous homicides. maybe ill go to reno, always wanted to live in a four letter word city, i could be a dancing girl and wear ciquens and feathers and shit, thatd be tight. anywas my b-day is fast approaching and if i could go back to the last one i had and do it all over again i would. i wouldnt change anything, even though i cried through most of the year and alienated my friends, family, and my self , even though i hurt myself and others in more than one way, even though i considered killing myself for half the fucking year id do it all again in a heartbeat because while all that was happening i learned how to survive with nothing but myself, i hated myself so intensily and in doing so i learned to love the simple things that i never thought to be gratefull for, like just being myself and having that be good enough.

"event","so where to begin....school ended at the begining of the month, finally! man i was in a bad way for a while there i thought i might actually lose it for real but eh guess not, a month full of sleepig mellowed me out a bit. so then i went to my friends b-day party and met her bf's best friend and hit it off really well,see we were both kinda tag alongs and had no one to talk to so we talked to eachother and it was cool and whatnot but the next day was better, we went bowling and got some icecream and just plain ole hung out.then home and depressed for a week cus i figured id never see him again but suprisingly enough he caught me on the net(go figure) and asked me to hang out wed. but then i also ended up sneaking out of the house to spend a couple of hours with him, that was fun mon. night that was. so then wednesday rolls around and he picked me up at eight cus i wanted out of the house before fat fat woke up and told me he changed his mind and told me i couldnt go. so then we went over to his house and watched tv for like 5 hours. i didnt want to make him spend money but it woulda been more fun to go into to town and do something, less akward. then we watched a dvd, took a nap made supper for his dad me and him, and watched more tv and then i went home. i think by not specifing something to do i ruined anychances we had as making it as a couple, too bad but eh, i kinda had a bad feeling about it from the get go. so now were going to the races tonight with some other ppl and maybe well have lots of fun like the last time, maybe not. i sat out for a long time last night lookin at the stars and trying to read my own horoscope but i gave up around midnight and came online to check it. it said basically what i didnt want to hear but already knew, ""follow ur logical voice even though it often keeps you from fun, blah blah blah, if your logical now the real fun will begin towards the end of the month"" yeah so thats great...not. sigh i dont know i feel just at a loss right now, i feel like it sould all me more to me but what i feel like doing is just sitting it back and riding it out, not my style, im always trying to make what i want to lhave happen happen but im tired of all that shit. its times like these i just want to runaway where no one knows me and be alone. i want to dissappear in a big city somewhere and just be alone for a while, ppl and relationships are just to much and i end up hating them i feel like a freaking slave to everyone, locked up in a cage. bah its not following the rules thats a drag, its having to get up and do chores when all i want to do is sleep, or just shit like that, having to stuff when i dont want to, im such a lazy bum, and i wonder how i gained 50 lbs. bah screw them im going back to bed."

"event","Alone  
  from childhood's hour I have not been 
  As others were-I have not seen
  As others saw- I could not bring 
  My passions from a common spring- 
  From the same source I have not taken
  My sorrow-I could not awaken 
  My heart to joy at the same tone-
  and all I lov'd-I lov'd alone-
  THEN-in my childhood-in the dawn
  Of a most stormy life- was drawn
  From ev'ry depth of good and ill 
  The mystery which binds me still- 
  From the torrent, or the fountain-
  From the red cliff of the mountain-  
  From the sun that round me roll'd 
  In its autumn tint of gold-
  From the lighting of the sky
  From the thunder, and the storm- 
  And the cloud that took the form
  (When the rest of Heaven was blue)
  Of a demon in my view- 
                 
                 Edgar Allan Poe  



fuck friends who needs em, I'm better off without em..pfft yeah right maybe if I keep telling myslef that it'll come ture...yeeeeeeeeeeeeeah sure fat chance...sigh"

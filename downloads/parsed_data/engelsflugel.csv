I am going to be trying to actively change a few things in my life that need changing or working on. I have decided to document some of them on here, because of this, this weblog will be going in a slightly new direction. Rather than use it to update my family on what's going on in my life (I'm horrid at remembering to do so and not sure anyone really reads it) I will now be posting things that I think are worth sharing that I do with my girls. Because the interwebs need yet another mommy blog (insert sarcasm here). Anyway... here goes... (On the next entry, not this one. You may move along now, this one is done. Finished.

"event","...That's right, good bye Oregon and hello again to Idaho. As some of you may know or have caught on by dribbles on Facebook, Stefan, the girls, and I are moving back home. Not just to Idaho, but also back home to Sandpoint. Well Ponderay to be more exact. After visiting there on our way to Montana for the Burrus family reunion, we realized how much we missed it there. It'd been over two years since we'd been back. Things here just seemed to be going wrong left and right and we started having a difficult time getting excited about trying to move to Portland. His new job at the burger joint actually didn't go well, in all honesty they ended up being a little shady. So when we got back home from our trip Stefan shot off a handful of resumes to some places that were hiring up in Sandpoint. We weren't sure if it'd happen right away, figured it would take a few months maybe. Then on the 13th he had a phone interview with the owner of Idaho Stone up in Ponderay and by Tuesday the 17th (our 7th wedding anniversary) they offered him the job. They want him to start this coming week. So this last week has been a whirl wind of Stef quitting his job (and all the problems that ensued with that), giving notice at our current place and so on and so forth. Well we were supposed to pay off rent with his paycheck today and that is where the problems ensued. We are hoping that it is worked out otherwise I'll be trying to get us moved out in the next 72 hours, but doubtful that it will come to that.

Stef left about an hour ago to head up to Sandpoint. I will spend the time he is gone getting the apartment packed up. The girls and I could be joining Stefan as soon as the 29th, but we don't have to be out of this apartment until Aug 15th. It all depends on him finding us a place up there to live and money. Always comes down to money. 

Anways, within the month we'll be back home and that feels really good. I'm so ready to be out of here. I'm tired of being around the city, looking forward to quieter small town. Also Natty will most likely be starting Preschool this year and possibly at Karen's school, she's pretty excited about that. And the place we are thinking about trying to live at is actually right across the street from Idaho Stone, it would be nice to be that close to work so we don't have worry about car juggling. Speaking of which I need to try to find a ride to Silverton on Wednesday 25th at 9:30am for Izzy's doctor appointment.

Looks like I've used up my allotted computer time... Izzy demands my attention. So there is my quick update on our topsy turvy life."

"event","Today I left some dishes dirty, 
The bed got made around 3:30.

The diapers soaked a little longer, 
The odor grew a little stronger.

The crumbs I spilled the day before
Are staring at me from the floor.

The fingerprints there on the wall
Will likely be there still next fall.

The dirty streaks on those windowpanes
Will still be there next time it rains.

Shame on you, you sit and say,
Just what did you do today?

I held a baby till he slept, 
I held a toddler while he wept.

I played a game of hid and seek, 
I squeezed a toy so it would squeak.

I pulled a wagon, sang a song,
Taught a child right from wrong.

What did I do this whole day through?
Not much that shows, I guess that's true.

Unless you think that what I've done 
Might be important to someone, 

With dark brown eyes and soft brown hair.
If that is true... I've done my share.

"event","I figure that I might as well actually get around to doing a life update. A few things have gone down, or rather a few decisions have been made. One of which is that we wont be moving, at least not until after the Burrus family trip at the end of June. We may possibly be staying here even longer than this summer. Rent is being raised and it's another $10 a month on top of that to be able to do month to month but this gives us the ability to move almost right away if something better comes up. The job search is going rather slow but we know that something needs to happen soon. We're already starting to cut into the money that we set aside for the Burrus trip (after already eating away the rest of our savings) but with his hours so low, I'm just glad that we did have a savings because currently only half our bills are able to be covered by his pay checks. Just revamped the resume and hoping that helps. Not giving up hope yet. Not really caring if the transfer goes through cause they probably wont be able to really give him anymore hours than he is getting at this store. Also trying to get set back up with Avon through Cathy but keep getting a hiccup in the process. Anyways like I said we are trying to keep optimistic about everything.

Since we decided to stay here for awhile longer (which makes the office managers at the apartments happy) we have halted packing and are in fact settling in a little more. We're still going through our stuff and purging things but not packing what we are keeping up. Except for books, those will probably stay in the boxes unless we want to get one out, saves space that way. The purging of Nat's room may have to happen at the end of June or start of July when she's staying with Karen. It's difficult to figure things out when she's there. It's bad enough I don't want to make her get rid of her toys but it's just harder when she's there pouting. I'm usually too much of a push over. Looking forward to revamping the place some though. I've also not had as much of a problem with being here. I really do love our apartment that we are in, and honestly we have yet to find another one for this price that has all the same things (eg w/d hook ups, garage, etc). What's been mainly bothering me is that we've been so couped up around here. But now that Izzy is more mobile and the weather is getting warmer that can change. Also the neighbors have been a pain but since we plan on staying around a while longer we'll actually start taking our concerns to the office again and hopefully get them corrected. 

I'd ramble on more but honestly I'm starting to fall asleep and not really sure what I'm saying anymore. So highlights. Not moving for a bit. Still looking for a job and would like prayers on that front. That's about it."

"event","So while wasting time on the internet I stopped by Pinterest and I found this fun looking tutorial for book making. Well it linked to DeviantArt, and I got to thinking that I hadn't signed in to my account there for a long time. I sign in and see that it's been over two years since I've done anything with it, and what do you know? BAM! I suddenly want to try to do all sorts of artistic projects. It's rather annoying that this urge always seems to hit right before I move and am supposed to be packing. Remember how I said it was over two years ago when I last did anything with it? Yah, that was when I was supposed to be packing for our move from Idaho to Oregon. It's a pain because things that I was thinking about getting rid of or tossing suddenly become things that I could up-cycle or re purpose and I can't have that kind of thinking this time. I need to cut down on the just stuff that I have, and ultimately never use no matter how much I say that it could be used for this or that. If I could start living in the sense of I'll get supplies as I need them rather than having stuff for ""just in case"" or ""when I get around to it"" then I'll have a lot less clutter. It's great to have things on hand but that's only for the awesome crafty people who actually use the stuff.

Having a difficult time actually being ruthless with myself. I keep thinking it <i>should</i> be easy but for some reason it's just not happening. I need a good kick in the tush!"

"event","Today we had two apartment showings set up, one at noon the other at 1pm. We left here around 11am, which should have given us about 20 minutes extra time, but we start nearing Wilsonville and traffic starts slamming on the breaks, and a few minutes later emergency response trucks go speeding by. I call the guy for our first showing and let him know that I think there is an accident between us and him, he asks to be kept updated. We inch forward every so often and it's getting to be 11:40, around the time we should have been to Beaverton if we hadn't been slowed up. He calls again and says to give him a call back when we hit the exit we need to get there, by this time we are moving again, albeit slowly. We pass the Wilsonville exit and we find out there wasn't a wreck, but someone's car did catch fire. So we made it about 20 minutes late rather than 20 minutes early. Oh well the guy didn't seem to mind since stayed in contact with him about it. 

The place was nice, older but not bad. Two bedrooms, washer and dryer in unit, wood fireplace. Smaller than what we have and less storage since no garage and same price as we are paying now, but in an area we like so much more. Family owned for the last 20 years, in fact the son (whom I'd been in contact with) was there to show us a unit (not the one we'd be renting since he couldn't get a hold of the gal who's moving out) and his parents showed up to do touch ups on the unit since they'd just rented it out. So we got to meet all of them and they seemed really nice, really liked Natty. They kept telling us the schools around are all really good. In fact it's right across from a Jr. High. They also said that they rarely get openings, most of the tenets have been there for a few years now and they like to keep it that way so they don't raise the rent. The gal moving out of the one we'd be getting has been there for three years. When he asked if we'd like to put in an application we asked him what the fee was and he scoffed at the idea of having one. So since we liked the place, in a good area, and didn't have to take into account an app fee we went ahead and put one in. I'm fairly certain that we both are hoping we get offered this place. 

When we first got there though I got a call from the gal that we had another showing with at 1pm. Her breaks went out on her car and she wasn't able to go anywhere until she could get a hold of her mechanic, so we rescheduled to Saturday, Stefan's next day off. Though if we hear back from the first apartment that we got it before then then I'll cancel. 

After getting food at the store and driving around for a place to eat it (it was rainy and we were having trouble finding a park or something), got a call from another apartment manager that we were set up with to see a place on Saturday. He said that his class he had got over early so if we wanted to stop by today rather than waiting we could. Long story short, nice guy but we weren't able to actually go into any of the units and there were a lot of extra fees and coin-op laundry. So we have the app still but since it's a $40 (each) non refundable app fee we are keeping it around as a ""back up"" in case we aren't able to get a better one. 

Then we drove into Uptown Portland, Stefan wanted to talk to the manager at the Levi's store there. We parked on the other side of the store from last time and we saw that that is where the Portland Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream Shop is. Since it is the only place around here that even has Schweddy Balls ice cream we had to stop in cause Stef has been wanting to try it since it came out. He loved it, the rum flavor was really prominent which he loved. Sadly though since it's limited batch they are almost out of it. Just a little bit more in the big tub and like two dozen, if that, of the ""normal"" store sizes.  At least he was able to finally try some. 

All in all it was a good day, just odd. There ended up being almost 10 traffic accidents that we knew of, so we spent a lot of time sitting around in traffic. It'll be nice when we are somewhere that we can use the public transit, and it's looking like it's not too long a wait anymore."

"event","I'd started working on finishing a sewing project when Izzy was getting pretty upset. I stopped to tend to her and when she fell asleep after nursing I just stayed with her instead of getting back up to work on the sewing project. She's up now and I'm doing this rather than the sewing. Oh well, I needed to get my thoughts down. While I was sitting with Iz I was browsing facebook and saw that Chris had read an article that someone wrote about wanting to ""save"" their daughter from <i>""The Hunger Games.""</i> Confused by the little bit it showed in the link I decided to go ahead and read it. While it was interesting to read, I suppose, that's not what really stuck with me. It was the comments that other facebook users left about it. 

While the most that I can ever hope for with my own writing is that some people might find it an interesting read, these are the types of people that I fear when it comes to my own works. People who have a favorite book (in this instance) or series and compare everything they read to it. I know a lot of people like Harry Potter, and when I finally got around to reading them years after I was done with school I found them to be enjoyable as well. However I still have my reservations about them, I do not compare all other books in the same reading level to them. There were people comparing THG to HP, heck Twilight got brought up by a few people. One person really stood out to me, <i> The Hunger Games has neither the in-depth complications and clever plot-solutions as Harry Potter (for those of you who have read it, just think about the fanfare and resulting announcement that benefitted both of our protagonists - a deus ex machina of devastatingly disappointing laziness), nor the teenage-girl enticing angst and sexuality of Twilight. It is by no means an original or clever book...""</i> Yes Collins didn't spend a lot of time describing different things like what everyone was wearing, what every conversation that happened entailed, the THG were very much plot driven. That doesn't make it any worse or better than books that are more detail oriented.

Harry Potter, Twilight and The Hunger Games are three of the most talked about and widely read YA book series out right now. I personally enjoyed all three of them. They are three different genres, three different writing styles, and even though Twilight and THG are both first person they are also three different writing point of views. The only thing they have in common is that they are newer books, all focus on teenager main characters, and are YA reading level. People are quick to point out in the books they don't like the editorial mistakes; I know all three have them, even if people are blind to them in their favorite books. The main thing the author of the article (and a lot of commenters) seemed to not like the most is the violence of THG. It had me wondering if I read the same HP books other people did. HP is also based in a violent setting. Heck, while it wasn't her strong point, even Twilight had violence. 

Is the series appropriate for pre-teens? I don't know, only the parents of these children can make that call. I will have to make the same calls when my girls get older. I'm already needing to think about it now with Nat since her sponge like memory is soaking up everything she sees and hears these days. 

I guess in my confusing, long winded, and ranting way I just wanted to say I hate how people put things down (books, movies, games, even people) either for mistakes, or just personal preference and compare them to things they do like even if there really isn't a good connecting line. There is a lot of worry in me about my own talents. I know my writing isn't perfect, it's far from. I know that my story line might feel over done. But even if my writing was perfect down to a tee and my story was literally original there would be people that wouldn't like it and what bothers me the most about that is chances are most of the criticisms would boil down to I'm not their favorite author and my story isn't their favorite story. It's just sad that people can't just appreciate things for what they are rather than comparing everything. 

Before anyone jumps on me, I know I do the same thing at times, and abhor it in myself as well. The best I can do is make an effort not to do so."

"event","Good weekend. Very good. I got to spend it with some awesome people. We hadn't seen Heather since we moved away from Idaho two years ago and we haven't seen Kraig since the summer we got married almost seven years ago. It was a long weekend leading up to them getting here one Sunday so Kraig was pretty tired. Still stayed up way too late talking with Heather. The girls both loved seeing them as well. Today (or rather yesterday since it's now Tuesday) we all went up to IKEA since Heather had never been and it meant that we got to spend a little more time with them because they were headed up to Seaside for the night. Hoping that their job interviews go well for them and that they find a place that they like. Can't say that my well wishes aren't completely unselfish, I'd love it if they are able to be closer again. 

The business of this week isn't over either. If they are able to they want to stop by on their way back up to North Idaho on Friday. Then on Saturday we are headed to Lincoln City for the start of wedding fun. (Slight possibility that we might head down on Friday.) Looking forward to Aidan and Tarra's wedding on Sunday. Though there are a few things that I still need to get done before this weekend, one of which is finishing Natty's dress. While it's not important that she has a dress that matches the colors I did promise her that I'd make her a new purple dress. But if worse comes to worse she has two newer dresses, one of which she's never worn, that are really cute. 

There are a few other projects that I want to get done before the wedding on Sunday. I'm also hoping that Isabeau does well for the weekend. She's been fussy lately, between teething and growing pains, I think, she's started to not like falling asleep. I know that Natty should be just fine, there'll be other kids and she always wants to be around other kids.

Trying to decide if I want to take a week off after this weekend and just relax, maybe get some light cleaning done or if I should go full bore right away with trying to get a new place for us lined up. There is a lot of purging and packing that needs to be done before we can move out of here. And if we can manage to do the packing smartly for once it'll make it less of a hassle when June rolls around. We have the family beach trip at the start of the month, then we have our family trip over to Montana (with a stop in Sandpoint area to say hi to people) at the end of the month. Though Karen is wanting to take Natty for an extended amount of time this summer so with her not around to ""help"" (bless her little heart) I might actually get us unpacked fairly quickly.

Stefan and I had a good talk today about our dreams and the different steps that we should take to go about achieving them. I'm excited, well that and I am so ready to get out of Woodburn. Our newer neighbors have been annoying me to no end. I'll missing being so near Laura and Dan but we wont be too far away and we can make time to get the girls over to spend time with them. 

Well I have a busy few months ahead of me and I'm beat so I should probably go get some sleep. It is after one am after all."

"event","Been looking for a place to move to in Portland lately. We'd really like to have it figured out soon, and hopefully able to be moving in early May. I will admit though that I sometimes take breaks from looking at places to rent to look at places to buy. I know it might be a ways off, but lets be honest, I'm a dreamer and I'm really good at daydreaming that something will happen that'll make us owning our own home feasible. Whether it's Stefan's hard work has paid off and he gets an awesome job or perhaps I finish my book and it actually sells (ha!), it doesn't matter how we are able to, just that we are. Having a home just seems really important to me. Well to both Stefan and I actually. 

As for me I went from living 13 years of my life in one home and since then the longest I've been in one place is 2 years. I want to give my girls a real home, somewhere that is theirs. That if they want to paint the walls fun colors they can, where they can have a garden and a dog. Where I'm not worried about hanging pictures on my own walls, and don't have to see plain white walls every day. Somewhere that is mine and I'm not thinking about if I should even bother unpacking boxes in storage because I might just be packing them right back up again. 

I know that Stefan has a lot of his own reasons to want a home of our own. One of them is wanting to be able to have a workshop. Honestly I am looking forward to him being able to have one myself. He has so many great ideas, and he can help me with mine. 

Until we are able to have our home I'm just going to keep dreaming about it. Besides, who knows maybe he'll land that great job soon or by chance I finish my book and someone actually wants to publish it. Hey, a girl can dream can't she?"

"event","Rambling Alert!

Got one little project done (well just need to send it now) and everything that I thought of to start on seemed a bit too big to undertake right now. Need to get a place squared away for our move in about 7 weeks, not to mention the organizing and packing that will need to be done and if I expect to get that done on time with a four year old and a four month old I should be started by now. Then there is Heather and Kraig swinging by in a few days so I need the place at least picked up by then. There are also things that I need to get done for Tarra and Aidan's wedding next week. That's right just 8 days away for that. Then there is wanting to start working out again but finding the opportunity to do so has been interesting. Seems like the main time I'd be able to is at night but I'm so tired and I'm not sure that's the best state to be working out in. But I <i>will</i> do it. Just need to get my act together. Been really scattered lately, feels like more so than normal too. 

There has been quite a few times that I have wanted to work on my story but have stopped myself because I have enough littler projects to do that I can actually finish in a timely manner that I figure that I should do those first. While it makes sense in a way to do the smaller ones first I end up not doing much of anything (aside from hanging out with my girls). Tonight however I let my self crack open my notebook (the first time in a while now actually) and get some work done on my story. While I didn't really get much done, more brainstorming and organizing than anything, it still felt really good to be working on it again. So perhaps rather than trying to push it out of my head and put my writing on the back burner I should let myself embrace it more often. Maybe I'll be in a better mood more often. Or sleep better. Who knows. All I do know is my writing really is like an extension of myself, if I ignore it and don't give into the need then I get cranky. That's not good. No one likes a cranky Callie, especially me. I have to stop treating it as just another hobby and more like one of my base needs, like hunger, thirst, or the need to breath."

"event","So gathering up all the patterns that I think are really cute or would be nifty to be able to do is a good idea. So is gathering up materials. However none of this is going to help me with sewing and projects if I am too worried about messing up that I don't even try to do them. The sewing machine kind of terrifies me actually. I've only tried using it by myself like twice and both times things have gone wrong. I know that I have to keep trying if I'm ever going to be able to make the things I want to, I have to no be worried about being perfect because lets face it without practicing I'm not going to even get good. I'm always so worried about ""wasting"" the materials. I know this is a ludicrous way to think and approach this, or anything for that matter. Right now, as of this very moment, I even have time to be practicing and yet... I'm writing this instead of trying... okay I'm going to go! I'm going to try to sew... cause it's either that or writing and well for some reason at the moment sewing seems to be the more practical hobby for me to have."

"event","A question was posed at the end of a show that I was watching this morning. <b>Is it better to depend on others or be the one depended upon?</b> While I'm sure that isn't the exact wording that they used, I hope you get the point. 

It got me thinking, something that isn't difficult to do these days. I can not say for sure that I know my personal answer to this question. It seems to change on a daily basis. While I do admit that normally I would say I hate depending on others for the sheer fact that it's not in my control, a part of me also feels relieved that I am not the one in control. See I have this hitch in my personality that doesn't mesh well with the rest of, well me and my life. I hate feeling out of control, not knowing what is going on or worse yet, what I should be doing or am going to do. Yet even with wanting all the answers and wanting to know that not only will it work out but how it will work out, I am terrified of having people depend on me. 

I love doing things for people, that is, when I can manage to accomplish them. That control freak in me clashes with the fact that I am a procrastinator that is completely scattered. All those things that I have promised to do (I feel must stress that I want to do them,as well) fall away and become nothing more than good intentions. Most days I feel like I rely on the idea ""it's the thought that counts"" so much that it becomes more like a mantra. People tell me that they understand, that we all get busy, but that isn't always the case for me. Sometimes I just honestly forget, others I'm sad to say I have the loop of ""I'll do it in just a moment"" or ""As soon as I'm done here"" playing in my head. I have projects galore started on my computer, some for family, some for friends, none of which are finished. I have sewing projects started, also not finished. Let us not forget the knitting that I tried picking up. Then there is my writing... Hopefully you get the point because it's starting to really bother me thinking about all of the unfinished things in my life.  

The people that I try my hardest not to fall into this pattern with are my girls and my husband, and yet I see it every day that I do. So many ideas and plans that just fly past me, past us, while I try to at least meet the day to day demands. Daily I am reminded that I barely do that. In case my ramblings haven't painted a clear picture for you, I've been struggling with not getting down on myself the last few weeks. Perhaps it is my lack of consistent sleep or the changing hormones from just having a baby, it might even be that I've not been eating well lately, it's a mystery as to why. 

I'm not even sure why I decided to write this. It could be that I've been up since two in the morning and am just really loopy or maybe even the stack of Christmas/birth announcements sitting on my desk waiting for me to get to the post office and mail them out, late as always.

If you have actually read through this, I applaud you, and want you to know that I really do mean well. If you are reading this and I have ever said that I was going to make something or provide something for you and have not delivered, please know that my heart does ache for letting you down and I hope you can forgive me. It is true, I am a dreamer. So many ideas and plans, ones that I believe to be truly great, and yet no idea how to bring them to fruition. Here's the kicker, I fell in love with and married another dreamer. While his dreams may not be as whimsical as my own, we are both dreamers. So here we stand facing life, want to give our daughters the world and no idea how to do so. One would think that with all the dreams and ideas we come up with we'd think of something or someway to get ourselves to move past the dreaming and on to the doing.

"event","Lets see, today I am 32weeks and 4days along. Not much longer to go and honestly been having a hard time with not freaking out or getting anxious lately. I'm either worried about money, worried about the fact that I'm having a hard time getting anything done, are we going to be ready, am I paying enough attention to Natty, making Natty's Halloween costume, etc. Sore almost all the time. Not the types of aches and pains I need to be worried about, though I am keeping an eye on everything to make sure that it doesn't turn into it, I know that things can go down hill quickly right now. So far everything is going great with little one so I'm trying to take comfort in that. It's so much more different than it was with Natalia, mostly for the better, but I am exhausted. The cooler weather the last few days has been nice, I only hope that it continues. 

We only have two things that we still need to get, and really only one of them is actually needed. That's the car seat. I'm a little worried that if we get the one we want then little one will actually come out as a boy even though we are almost certain she's a girl. You can see the last two things we are thinking about getting <a href=""https://www.walmart.com/giftregistry/gr_detail.do?registry_id=26772301112""> here.</a> Oh I guess that's not true, we are still on the look out for a going home outfit. I went through all of Natty's old baby clothes and we should be just fine clothes wise. Just want something that belongs to just her rather than her big sister, for when she comes home/""first pictures"" (some hospitals do that, I know Gritman did). We found one that we really liked at I want to say the Carter's store at the mall, we'll have to go back to see if it's still there/anything else catches our eye since that was almost a month ago. 

Do still need to get on top of things with the cloth diapering though. Stefan is confident that we can make our own, it's just right now we don't have a good place to set up the sewing machine. Our dining table is still currently one of those cheap card tables, little wobbly for my liking. Mama and Daddy bought us a new dining table though, for Christmas (this year and next)/Birthday/baby gift, and they are bringing it over with them when they visit in November. That'll be after the baby has come though so we wont be able to have it to make any before little one comes. However when we got my clothes from Motherhood, since it was my first time buying from them, within the next month they'll be sending us a box of newborn diapers so that might help. Also if Karen is still willing to lend us Maddy's newborn size CD's that'll help too. 

I keep trying to tell myself that it's alright that my apartment isn't exactly as clean/set up the way I want. It's okay that I'm so scattered. That Natalia really is doing just fine even if I've been more lax on toys being picked up, letting her watch a little more tv than normal. I still try to get in some actual teaching every once in a while and I try to take comfort in that. She's still a really good kid, I still try to read to her every day. Just wish I could be like all the other super moms out there. 

Doesn't help that I'm starting to get nervous about the actual delivery. I've already been through it once, I shouldn't be this jittery about it."

"event","I think the heat may be eating away at my brain. I opened up the box of Natty's old baby clothes today, thinking that I'd get them sorted and start washing them (little musty for being in a box for so long). I got them sorted a bit, but after doing that I just felt exhausted. Never done well with heat, one of the draws of this area... when it's not trying for record highs. Though it could also be that Natty doesn't do well with heat either and suddenly can't sleep when it starts cooling off. She also hasn't been feeling well either. So I've been staying up much much later than I'd like. Stef finally got me to go into the maternity store and get me a few things from their end of summer sale racks. Got some shorts and two tanks. I did really need something since I'm not fitting into anything real well anymore, and the few things that I can fit into aren't really warm weather clothes. Trying to also stay caught up with water consumption. 

At least everything with the pregnancy is going well. I passed my GD test last week. My BP and weight are doing good. She's a very active little one. All this is good, which means I won't be getting another u/s which is a little sad, but in a good way. 

Okay the combined heat from the temperature and computer are getting to me. I think I'll try reading for a bit."

"event","I am 26 and a half weeks along now. Getting close to the final trimester. Haven't done anything to get ready around the apartment for the new little one. I know that there is still three more months to go, but the last six just really flew by, especially the last two. Stefan and I have talked about the things that we <i>need</i> and it really isn't much yet. We don't need a crib yet, Natty barely used hers since she co-slept with us for a long time. We still the pack 'n' play that Cathy gave us when we had natty, that has a little bassinet that attaches to it that we can put next to our bed if we want to try not having this little one in our bed all the time. If indeed she does come out as a little girl we have all of Natty's clothes saved still. I'll have Stefan bring up the box of newborn clothes in a month or so and clean them all again and them them sorted. We did give away Natty's bouncer thing and the swing so I'm wanting to look into getting another one of those, either one or both. I just want to have something to be able to put her down in in the living room/anywhere. We need another car seat and we are wanting to do cloth diapering this time around because it really will be more cost effective for us since we have our own washer and dryer now. Really don't want to nickle and dime away Stefan's pay check on things that we are just going to throw away. Trying to decide if I want to try making our own CDs.I know that our friend Karen is loaning us some newborn ones now that her daughter has grown out of them. 

We have more than enough toys and so don't need anymore. I wouldn't know where to put it. Really if anyone is wanting to get things for the new little one, save the money you would have spent and put it towards helping with car seat and cloth diapers. Not that we have been given anything for the baby or have had anyone express wanting to get her anything. I know Sarah is making her and Natty hats which is nice. 

We're just really praying that Stefan can get a better job soon. He's getting pretty stressed out at his current one. Even though it was just his mid year review they at least did tell him that he is one of their best workers (if not best) and out of over 20 things that they have to mark off on the check list like only three things he was told that he could improve on. And yet again they mentioned that he is high priority for a promotion when one comes up and talking about training him on other jobs (though they said that to him back when he first started there too). I know that boosted his mood a bit, but they are still working him odd hours. Like today he had an 11 hour shift and had one last week too. He's scheduled for just under 40 hours a week which is good but it's also stressful because he is technically a part time worker so the company forbids him to get over time which right now is annoying for the store because people keep quitting and they aren't hiring people fast enough. Money wise we can make it work but the stress of the job is getting to him, which in turn makes it not as nice when he is home. 

Anyways this is a very random post and just felt like rambling. I had been looking at what I need to do to get into cloth diapering and just felt a little overwhelmed by all the different ways to go with it. So I took a break."

"event","Earlier this month my Grandmother passed away. I'd written a short little entry to express how I felt about it. I shared it on facebook in hopes that others from my family might identify with it as well. It wasn't much, a few sentences, a small paragraph. One of my sisters however felt that it should be shared at her funeral last week. I was touched, and a little shocked that someone thought that of something I  had wrote. Then again with the subject being how wonderful my Grandmother was it wasn't difficult to write something that others would want to share. If anything I was slightly worried that I wouldn't be able to do her memory justice. I was happy to allow them to read it, I couldn't go myself but at least I could send my thoughts, my words. 

One of my other sisters read it, she informed me afterwards that she'd cried while she shared it at the funeral. She told me that it was well received and everyone that she'd talked to really liked it. Again it was about a very remarkable woman, whom they were all there to celebrate her life and say a fond farewell to, so it makes sense that they'd like it. It's nice knowing that while I couldn't be there to actually hug my family that my words might have been able to be that metaphorical hug for me. 

I went on about my weekend, my daughter had been whisked away by her other Grandma for a few days and I let myself delve into getting some house work done and having a restful time by myself. Everywhere I read or people I turn to all seem to share the same opinion of you need to find time for yourself when your pregnant otherwise you'll become too stressed. So I let myself have a selfish weekend. I had decided to wait and call my parents after they'd gotten a chance to get home and settled back in, they'd had a long couple of weeks and figured that they could use the quiet. My mother's birthday is coming up on Wednesday and I figured since I'd be calling her then anyways that I would hold off till then. 

However, yesterday she had different thoughts and called me instead. It was nice to hear her in a good mood, she'd sounded really down last I'd heard from her, which is understandable. She had just wanted to call to let me know that they'd made it in safely and and we chatted for a few minutes. Then she talked to me about what I'd written for Grandma. She told me that she was very touched by it and went on about how well written it was. Proceeded to tell me that I should be writing. I replied with I do write, she cut me off saying ""No, I mean you should be actually writing. You are really good at it."" I mumbled something about working on a book I'd stared back in October, and she seemed satisfied by that answer. We said our goodbyes and I was left with what she'd told me in my head for the rest of the day. In fact I've yet to really get over it even a day later. 

Now I feel I must impress something upon you, my dear reader. My mother read a lot of papers and stories that I'd written while I was growing up and in school. I would get the obligatory, ""It sounds good,"" or ""You might want to tweak this."" But for the life of me I can not remember her ever saying that something I'd produced was well written, let alone tell me I should be writing, that I should be a writer. I was blown away and left stunned. 

Granted, when I look back and read things that I'd written back then I cringe at them. The voice, my voice still sounds the same to me, but they seem like first drafts, poorly written first drafts at that. Have I done anything to improve on my writing? Not really. I haven't taken any classes, I haven't picked up one of the writing for dummies books, I haven't even really let people read and critique my work. The people who do read my stuff tend to just tell me its good. Yes, I am one of those people that claims that they are all just biased. (Which these people, they actually are.)  I might be able to attribute it to my reading habits. While I read maybe as much as I did in high school, I have expanded past my comfort zone of one genre, one author. Although even then I didn't expand far with the genre, I went from only really reading murder mystery to reading supernatural books and I still have my few authors that I tend to stick to. So, I don't even know if my reading habits have anything to do with it. Perhaps it's just simply that I've grown. I have more life lived behind me and have experienced emotions and situations that I had only read about in school. 

To me my writing is and has been for the longest time something that I do because I have to. Unlike other hobbies I get twitchy, for lack of a better word, if I go too long without writing anything, even if it's just a journal entry. The one time I thought I might be able to do something with it was in high school when I started writing my first book. I was surrounded by my friends who were all also into writing, so I'm sure that it was a vibe they were projecting. As those friends drifted I stopped having that feeling of I could actually make something out of my desire, my need to write. Life went on around me and I forgot about my book almost altogether. It was years before I picked it back up again thinking I should at least finish it. I reread it to help remind me where I was going with it and I was heart broken at the fact that at one time I thought I could actually do something with that story. I tried rewriting it, but I soon discovered that I couldn't go back to that story, even just to say I finished it. 

I started having ideas for a story, or book, back in October of last year. Figuring that since NaNoWiMo was coming up I'd actually participate in it using my new ideas floating around. Sadly though, November was actually rather hectic and I just couldn't complete the challenge or make much actual progress on the book. Even with all that though I have still held on to my ideas for it. I often fall asleep daydreaming, if you will, about what I see happening in that world. I'll even stay in bed half awake in the mornings sometimes playing out different scenes. The sad thing is I've been having trouble getting what is crammed into my head actually written out. Before you start wondering, yes I do have a lot of excuses as to a possible reason why, but honestly non of them seem to really fit. It's me. I'm blocking myself some how for some reason. 

Now though, I have my mother's words banging around in my head. I know she believes in me to do well at anything that I set my mind and heart to. She is always telling me how great of a mother I am to my daughter. I heard that same tone when she was telling me that I should write, and now I just can't get it out of my head. Something in me keeps whispering that maybe, just maybe it would actually be worth sharing what I write. Maybe."

"event","So I wasn't able to make it back after my last entry. Oh well. Not much is currently going on with us right at this moment in time. We signed our lease so we are at this apartment for at least another year. The couple that sometimes watches Natalia for us told Stefan about a job opening for a buisness manager at a retirement home here in town. She already put in her recomendation for him and we are hoping that will help with getting an interview. From the sounds of it though she is fairly optimistic about the possiblity of him getting the position. I know Stefan is pretty psyched about it too. Time will tell. It really would be a lot better job for him, it would be a full time job with a pay increase. Right now that would be a lot better for the whole family. 

Natty is growing like crazy, she is currently in the middle of a growth spurt. She also loves to talk your ear off. It's been so much fun watching her play these days, she does a lot more with pretending. just the other day she was talking to an imaginary friend, it was really cute. She loves counting and is always ready with a question to either better understand the world around her or to confirm what we've already told her time and time again. 

As for myself I have been trying to work on my writing again. Both my book and my Final Fantasy VIII fanfiction. I have had so many ideas for both bouncing around my head but I seem to be having a difficult time pulling myself out of my daydreaming and getting it all typed or written down before I forget what I was doing. I've also started knitting back up but I've hit a stall on the scarf I was working on when I ran out of yarn and Stefan nor I know how to keep going with a new batch of yarn. I have two video projects that I need to finish still. Lots of things aside from everyday household jobs and parenting duties to keep me busy but I haven't done much with any of of the hobbies. Like I said I get lost in my own world of my stories and time just slips away. 

Well I'm rambling now and while I still have time remaining on the computer I really don't know what to go on about right now that I haven't already. I hope that everyone is doing well. Loves to you all."

"event","Just doing a quick update to kind of explain why we aren't bothering with internet for a while. At the end of the month our rent goes up, and at the end of last month I left my job at Catherine's. A lot of drama with the company was going on (namely that the store is set to close soon and our hours got majorly cut) and it just wasn't worth staying. Stefan is currently looking for a new job, or hoping that his hours stay at roughly full time but are unsure that is going to happen since they are planning on hiring on like 20 new people  to help with the summer ""rush."" 

My time is almost up on the library computer so I'm going to go for now, but I plan on coming back sometime this week and have some other more interesting news that I will delve into when the time is more premitting. I hope that everyone is doing well. Love!"

Need to do laundry and go to the store. I just don't know what to get at the store though. My scarf is getting longer. Though Natty pulled out my needle when I wasn't paying attention last night. Stef is pretty sure he fixed it thankfully. 

My brain is so muddled right now and it's taken me like an hour to to write this cause I keep getting pulled away."

"event","Since my hip has been hurting and keeping me away from my computer more my knitting has improved a lot. Today we got a package in the mail from MIL Karen of a bunch of yarn that was given to her. There's pretty colors and now I don't have to keep unraveling the yarn I'm using to get practice. I'm trying to make a scarf right now. Yes I know they aren't that difficult, but hey have to start somewhere right? 

Natty has been suffering insomnia with me lately. I was really hoping that she didn't inherit that from me but alas she has. Along with night terrors. She had another one right before Thanksgiving, ended up biting Karen hard enough to draw blood. At least it had been almost a year since her last one. 

Since it is so late and she has finally fallen asleep, I'm going to try to get sleep myself."

"event","I FORGOT YESTERDAY! Oh well, at least I did it at the start of the month so I didn't break a long streak. So I will pick myself back up and continue on. We still haven't gotten the Christmas decorations up, or even brought up from the garage. Today I am trying to get some cleaning done and hopefully we'll get them brought up tonight. I don't know if I'll decorate tonight or do it tomorrow since I have the day off. Well I'm on call, but I have yet to be called in for my on calls. Okay that sort of isn't true, I've been asked to come in but not during the times I'm scheduled to be on call. I was asked this morning to come in today, but it was for when Stef had work too and that's too short of notice to get a babysitter for Natty. Would have been nice though, three consecutive weeks with almost 20 hours. Yep that's right, next week I'm scheduled for eighteen hours. Granted I don't know how much of all this has to do with them liking my work and how much of it has to do with everyone but me requesting days off that week. Whichever it is though I'm not turning down the extra hours, that's for sure. 

Really need to go shopping, our kitchen is empty and that's no fun. Another thing that I need to do is get to work on our Christmas card. We're going to do something a little different this year. Since money is so tight this year instead of getting a whole bunch printed off and mailing them out to everyone I am going to be emailing it along with a end of the year letter to everyone that I can email it to. Then I only have a few people to actually mail them out to. I hope no one is offended by this, it's not that we don't care about you, just that printing and stamps add up quickly, sadly. We are trying to save as much money right now to hopefully be able to fix our car soon, still don't know when that's going to be. Thankfully it hasn't been icy here so we are still able to ride our bikes to work. Only sad thing about that is Natty's little legs keep getting longer and she barely fits in the bike seat now. So taking her places is becoming interesting. 

I'm going to get back to cleaning the apartment. Hope everyone is having a great Sunday!"

Don't really have money to get anything anyways. Hate waiting for pay day. Pay day will be nice... until a few seconds later when I have to give it all away. Finally got around to watching the show Lie to Me, really like it. Last night during another bout of insomnia I started In Plain Sight, so far I like it. I have a book that has gotten in off my request list at the library but I'm not sure I'm going to go get it though. While huddling up with a book and a blanket for hours on end sounds nice, I just don't have the time to. I have come to realize I can tolerate Barny more than Dora the Explorer. Dora really bothers me. Super Why and Sid the Science Kid are some of my favorites right now. Fallin... asleeeep...."

"event","I almost forgot to post today. Been really tired as of late, at first I thought it was because of the craziness of last week, but now I'm not so sure. Period came a week early so maybe that's it. Work is going good, already had 12 hours scheduled and picked up another 4 hour shift so next weeks check should be a lot better than the ones I've been getting lately. So I'm happy about that. I hope that Stefan can start getting more hours again, this week and next week he doesn't have many because they over hired on the seasonal workers. 

Last night I had Stef show me how to start knitting, so I'm trying that out as a new hobby. It's going to be either that or sewing cause I never actually got into my sewing though I would like to. 

I am so out of it, I keep zoning out so I'm just going to go."

"event","Got woken up early today because of a headache. It's been a constant one for a while now, feels like a stress headache. Always have more trouble keeping them away this time of year. I think it's because money is always so tight. On Black Friday Stefan and I did use some of our money to buy clothes for work, much needed clothes at that. I have been rotating what little I have so much that they are starting to look a little sad and am thankful that I got a few things to add to the mix. However, doing this means that I will probably have to wait a few more weeks before I can get a phone up for me again. Yes I still have not replaced my phone. I have to wait to pay my cell bill before I can do that and it's looking like mid month. I hope no longer than that anyways. I'm also a little sad that we wont be able to do Christmas presents for the family this year. We spent a little bit on Natalia just so she has something to open from us on Christmas morning, but for the rest of the family? I hope everyone is alright with just getting cards. Now I just have to figure out a way to get a picture for that and get those done. Doing the trip over for Pat and Chan's wedding set us back, but we knew it would and it was so worth it to us to go. 

I have had more hours the last two weeks which is a trend that I am hoping continues but not sure if it will. Stefan has also been getting almost full time constantly (not 40hrs/week but he is only part time) due to the fact that since being hired there he's been either first or second in sales every time he works, and they are talking about training him on other jobs around the store. If you couldn't tell I'm just a little proud and possibly smug about my hubby. He's a hard worker and always gives his all at his job, no matter what it is. It's been nice to see a company finally treat him as a good employee, not just telling him he is one and then taking advantage of that fact. 

This morning I broke out my 101/1001 list and realized I was able to knock nine things off the list and update many others as well. The time is dwindling and I still have a long ways to go, but I'm confidant that I'll have put a pretty big dent in the list by the end of the time and that'll feel good for me. I know it felt good to cross out as much as I did this morning. Some of the things I don't have much control over, like have second child, I can try but that's up to God not me. That's why I don't feel like failing or anything if I don't finish the list. Besides, 101 things is a lot of things to get done, even if you have two and a half years to finish. One of the things on my list though is try a new hobby. I haven't figured one out yet since I don't count doing the PointGirls videos every week. So, if anyone has any suggestions as to something to try, or point out something I started doing in the last two years that is a hobby let me know. Another one I am tackling again is updating this everyday for a month. I've gotten half way twice, lets see if I can make it through December! I think I might also couple this with one of my writing ones, I have down to do two writing exercises a week for a month also.

I think I am going to try laying back down since no one else is up yet and my headache has dulled again. Hope everyone's Wednesday is wonderful and are able to stay warm out there!"

"event","Today is the last day of November. My last post was I believe the first day of November, and I was getting all geared up to do NaNoWriMo. I got to like just under 20k words. I'm glad that I at least tried doing this challenge, but I can honestly say that I will probably not be doing it again. I've learned though this that I don't do well with this sort of deadline. I guess I should have known this already if I just looked back at school. Mrs. Miller can attest (as well as most of my English teachers through the years) that the only reason that my papers didn't get an A is because I always turned them in late. I'd crank them out just after they were due. I don't like deadlines. This is probably another reason that I think I am okay with the fact that I will probably never be published. If by some random fluke I did get published and they wanted to offer me a contract, it's another deadline. When I write I have to be in the mood and I can't be pressured into it. I stall, I find other things to do, and just plain don't do it. I am thankful for Tara trying to give me a push here and there to keep me going, and I hope she knows that she didn't let me down in any way. I didn't finish and that's all on me. Last week I was a little down by the fact that I knew I wasn't going to finish but after talking it over with Stefan, just like games and art, I should only do it when I am having fun with it, if it's not fun don't bother. It's not a required thing so why treat it like it is. 

There are many reasons that I am thankful for at least trying to do it though. One is that when I told Tara that I was going to do it this year I told her she should do it with me and she not only finished early but she was able to find her muse again that she'd lost last year. Another reason that I am thankful, I found my own muse again. While I had been working on that fanfic for FFVIII I was really wanting to write my own characters and let them take me somewhere I haven't been before. I even started writing in a genera that I'd never even attempted before. Am I any good at it? I really don't know but I've been having fun with it and that is all that matters. 

When all is said and done I am still happy at the close of November. I don't think I'll ever do it again, but I don't know maybe I will. Maybe I'll pick some other month to do the challenge in. I know I wouldn't get the nifty winner's badges and the likes but November just seems to be a not good month for me with trying to get projects done. Honestly June, August, or October seem like much better months for me to do something like that in. I have been having fun writing again and not stressing over it like I would in the past, I haven't had this much fun with it since Jr year when I was shirking my math in favor of writing. 

I still have like five hours to try write before it ends officially. Will I be writing in those hours? Yes, I believe I will be. Will I update my word count at the last minute to try to boost my numbers before the end? Probably not, I know I wont get 30k written in that amount of time and the main reason to try to update it is to validate and win. 

Congrats to all of 2010 NaNoWriMo winners! You are all awesome."

"event","I was going to do an entry for the last two nights of October, again doing it on my phone or Stefan's, but I was just too busy or worn out to do so. On Friday night we had Channing's bridal shower and at the end of it we dressed her up in a toilet paper wedding dress and took her over to see Pat at their little get together. The guys were pretty drunk, or at least getting there. Had some fun hanging out with them till almost midnight, then the sisters took Channing over to the bar so that we could get to know our newest addition and unwind. Yes, yours truly did actually drink. While it wasn't the first time that I've tried to drink mixed drinks it was the first time that I liked the mixed drinks that I had. I had two drinks and two shots. Again yes, I did get tipsy, some might say drunk but I know I wasn't that bad and the people around to tell me were pretty gone themselves too. I will go into that at a later date if anyone cares to know about that night but for right now I am just summing up the weekend because I should be doing NaNoWriMo work instead of journaling. 

Saturday I didn't do one because during the day I was too busy spending time with my family and enjoying my brother's wedding. It was awesome and completely in tune with the type of people he and Channing are. They both looked extremely happy and excited, they really are a great match and if they can keep up the relationship that they have now I know there is no separating them. After the wedding we played around in the water park again (we did some on Friday as well). Got video of the guys trying the standing wave and wiping out a bunch of times, epic. We all went to dinner before the kids were going to go trick or treating. Natty however wasn't feeling well and passed out at dinner so she didn't go with the cousins. She had a temp of 100.8 and a runny nose, as the night went on she became really congested. That among a few other things put a grey lining around an amazingly golden day. 

Sunday morning consisted of getting everyone's stuff together. Tara was an angel and drove up to pick us up from Kellogg so we wouldn't have to worry about who was going to give us a ride. Said good bye to everyone and headed out. We got some lunch with Tara and had a great time with her on the way to Spokane. Since she had to be back before it got late we got to the station around 2:30pm and had to say good bye to her as well. From there we busied our selves with random things like napping and cards. I tried to do an update on the phone but I kept falling asleep so it never happened. Oh and of course looking for my phone before finally admitting to ourselves that it was stolen. So we called the phone company and reported it so the service was shut down to it. While I don't really mind losing that phone, I had taken some pretty cute pictures over the weekend that were on it. Sadness there. 

I had a small tickle in the back of my throat on Sunday, and was getting a pretty bad headache right before we boarded the train. All three of us passed out for a while when we first got on the train. When I woke up my head was congested and my throat hurt like crazy, and the headache hadn't lessened. It was still dark, Natty and Stefan were still passed out, so I just kept trying to go back to sleep every time I woke, until the sun started coming up. Stefan got me some Tylenol from the dinning car and I watched the beautiful Gorge pass by. We both made sure to look up at his Grandma Doris' house in Bingin. The ride went just fine. Leann picked us up from the station around 10am I think and brought us home. A few minutes in home and I was sent to bed. 

I feel a bit better, headache mostly gone but I still have a very sore throat that makes talking painful and the rest of my muscles are extremely sore as well. All in all though, I had an amazing weekend but all three of us seem pretty happy to be back home again. I guess we have just gotten used to being in small groups so being around that many people started overwhelming us, even Natty seems to be really happy to be home. Also she's almost completely better with what ever sickiness she had. 

I hope that everyone had a funfilled Halloween weekend!"

We made it in safely to Spokane, and the lovely Karen picked us up and let us crash on her couch for a few hours. We were going to spend some of the day with Heather but it turns out that Deanna left a little early so she is picking us up from Karen's and then we are headed over to Kellogg to meet up with the rest of the family! Hopefully we can do something with Heather on Sunday before we head back to Oregon, I miss my Bunny. I have missed everyone really, and I hope we can make it back over soon so that we can actually spend time with our friends that we left in this part of the world. 

The ride over was a good one, though Natty woke up like an hour after she fell asleep so she was a little bit of a pain towards the end of the trip though. She wanted to get up and play when everyone else was wanting to sleep, so that made her grumpy. Once we got to Karen's we hung out for a bit, gave her her birthday present and about and hour later we all passed out. I got up fairly early though because of the fact that I was still hammering out plans for who was picking us up. That's alright, I can sleep when I get back home right? 

I know it's another short entry but I don't want to hog the computer any longer than I already have. I hope everyone has a happy Friday!"

I use to hate trains when I was little, but I have always loved the sound of them. When I was growing up we lived within earshot of a few different tracks. I always found it to be a soothing noise. Today is my first real trip on one. I was told to make sure that I sit on the right side by a window because the gorge is beautiful. sadly though the sun is going down a lot earlier so it was dark by the time we got there. It still has been very lovely to watch the scenery go by. Natty and Stefan fell asleep around 7:30 and I really feel like I"" not far behind them. The movement of train is doing a grand work of lulling me away to sleepyland... TTFN."

"event","So with true Callie (and even Stefan) fashion it's coming down to the last minute on everything for this weekend and we are still up in the air about almost all of it. This is how it goes for most things in my life. It gets put off till last minute even if I don't want to. Sometimes I'll try to do it early but outside forces make it so I can't normally. On the rare occasion that I am able to get something done early I then feel like I'm forgetting something for the rest of the time. I trust that everything will work out, maybe not to how we want but it'll be fine. I'm sooo looking forward to seeing everyone this weekend! How we are getting there and back seems so little compared to the fact that I get to see my family, as long as I am able to do that I don't care how it happens! 

As for NaNoWriMo, I am really hoping that I am able to figure out a way to have my computer back in commission! Today my monitor finally called it quits. I know I have said that before, but there was always a little spark that if I left it alone for long enough it would come back to life for a while. Well last night I had to restart my computer, it was getting sluggish and had a lot of updates that it had to install. The monitor never even flickered. Sad day. I can get on Stefan's computer to check things but my projects are on mine so I need some way to be able to work off of it. I might hook up my tower to the tv (boo-ya big monitor!) but I am still a little unsure about that one. Since it would let me work on my computer I probably should just go ahead and do it. 

Kiddo hasn't been going to sleep until like midnight this week and that's been interesting on myself. Hopefully that changes soon. I know she is going through a growth spurt, she's cranky and a picky eater, and the new shoes we just bought for her a few weeks ago (we got the bigger size so she could grow into them) are already getting small on her. She's looking more and more like a little kid than a toddler. What happened to my little baby?! 

Anyways that's it for me tonight, I'm very out of it. TTFN."

"event","No I am not hung over, but I almost feel like I might as well be. I had an awesome night last night. Tara and I decided to do another Twilight marathon. This time though instead of talking through text messages we decided to do a video call so we could actually talk to each other, made it so much more fun. Didn't pay much attention to the movies but that's not much of an issue because we've both seen them lots of times before. Had a lot of fun talking with each other, Natty loved being on the video chat with us too. Even Stef was joining in when he got off work. Ah the internet, making long distance friendships easier.

The movies were over just after midnight, Stefan had already gone to bed because he had work today, Natty took a little longer to go to sleep since she was fighting it. As for Tara and I? I'm not entirely sure how late we were up. I do remember that there was a lot of sugar, sleep deprivation, and fun involved. It was very reminiscent of the days back in high school when I'd do a sleep over with friends. It's probably a good thing that Stefan had already gone to bed, might have scared him off, I know that I was worrying Jason with how hyper I was. 

We tried to get on BlogTV together but it just wasn't working. I think I'm thankful for that. From what I can remember well of last night I'm not sure I want video evidence of last night, let alone have it out on the internet for everyone to see. So I'm sore, still rather tired, have a slight sore throat, and a headache today, and I wouldn't trade in any of it because I had a blast last night. It's been a long time since I've laughed that hard and long!

""Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, don't speak. You're injured."""

Also worked on a drabble for Tara since she requested one. I still need to do one for Cathy like I was supposed to months ago, just having a block on what fan fic I should do for her. 

Today went alright. Really didn't want to go to work though. Had a horrid stress headache last night/this morning. Couldn't sleep because of it. I did get my priest up to 68 so she can quest in Northrend now. However my account went down this morning too. Trying to decide when I'm going to bring it back up again. 

I really don't know what to talk about, I'm so out of it. Sorry this is so short, but hey with my other writing I'm doing today I feel like more than makes up for this being so short."

"event","Welcome dear reader to my journal for today. I do not bring a fantastical story of love and heroism, nor do I bring a character study, so that we may get to know the people in my skewed brain. No tidings of joy or tales of woe. Today I bring you the events of my day. ""Oh dear Lord no,"" you say? I am sorry, but this is how it is dear friend. 

After staying up later than that of the ""normal"" person I went to sleep quite quickly in the early AM. I didn't even wake enough to know when my little daughter climbed in and joined us in bed. I had set the alarm on my phone and woke, with only a slight delay. As soon as I came out to the living room though I was ushered back to bed for another hour before the husband had to leave for work. I fell back to sleep rather easily, only to be awoken right away, or rather what I thought was right away and turned out to be almost an hour later. The husband left and this time I was too groggy to get out of bed, so I had the daughter join me again and we passed back out. Some hours later I got up, realizing the time I headed to the shower to get ready for work today. Rather than shaving my legs like I normally do, today I decided to use the Nair again. It does make them really soft, just takes much more time. After my shower it wasn't long before the daughter woke up. She sat with me, not really awake yet, while I ran my two level 80 characters on World of Warcraft, through the Holiday event known as the Headless Horseman. I was saddened that my hunter once again received the flying broom making this the fifth day in a row. I was also not pleased that I have yet to receive anything on my druid. 

Once I got over the sorrow of my Headless Horseman runs, I went and blow dried my hair and got dressed. The daughter followed me around wanting to do everything that her mommy did, because of this she got dressed as well. One last look around the apartment to make sure we didn't forget anything the two of us set out for the mall where the husband and I work. Went into Subway to get the daughter and I something to eat before I had to go clock in at my job. Five o'clock rolls around and the husband gets off work and meets us in front of the store that I work at. We talk for about fifteen minutes and I leave for my shift. 

It was rather slow today at the store, doing only 10% of the daily goal. Not many people were wanting to come in. We used this down time to do a deep clean of the store since our Store Manager wasn't happy with it's appearance. I dusted everywhere I could think to, and then I got to use the vacuum to clean all the edges of the store before doing the normal vacuuming. At about twenty minutes to closing we had a few women come in. While it was nice that they bought our merchandise, everywhere they went in the store they left a disaster. So after they left we had something more to do to fill our time. Ended up getting out of there about fifteen minutes early, which is good because I am told that the past two weeks we have been over our hours. 

I met the husband and the daughter outside after work. The daughter and I rode home while the husband went to the store. The ride was somewhat annoying since it decided to rain. While I maybe used to becoming a drowned rat, the daughter was not happy with these turn of events. She fell asleep right as we got to the garage door, so she is now running around trying not let herself fall asleep again. 

In short, my day was rather boring and tiring. My legs now hurt from the crouching at work and the round trip with a two and a half year old on the back of my bike. I am tired and I am hungry again. So as an ending my dear reader, I do hope that your day was exceptional and well lived."

"event","I've been sitting around for the last few hours trying to decide what to write about for this. Should I try another character sketch or write about my day? Or perhaps I should pick a random topic that I could give my opinion on. Which to choose? I wasn't sure which character was speaking to me tonight, they are actually rather silent sadly. My day? I stayed up too late, into the morning and only got about 3 hours of sleep before getting up to go to work. After that I went to the bank, came home and passed out for a while longer. In other, slightly less words, not much happened. 

My opinion on something. Well I do have a lot of those this is true, and normally I have no problems with going on and on about them. I don't like watching the news, yes I am one of those people who digs a hole and sticks their head in it. Most of the time it's too painful to watch. I cry at movies, characters that aren't real bring on strong emotions. I know that I am not one that could handle the emotions brought on by real people. I pray for them. I let friends tell me about what they've seen, read or watched. I'll pass along a story that I find particularly in need of spreading and prayer. 

It may seem selfish, and I am aware that indeed it is. I feel overwhelmed by my own life most of the time, trying to stay on top of everything and not have it all fall out from under me. And yet stay in touch with my family, which I haven't been as good at the last few months. Looking to the outside world scares me really. Seeing what people are capable of, I know it, but I don't want to be reminded of it. I don't want to have to worry each time I take my daughter somewhere, leave her with people I trust. There are wonderful people out there and I know that the ones I trust are wonderful and that I have placed that trust in the right places. It doesn't change the fact that everywhere you turn now a days you are told about things that have happened to children by the people that they were trusted to. 

And this is really confusing I know so I'm just going to end it now before I ramble anymore... thanks Jason lol."

"event","A flood of worry, mixed with confusion washed over Avalynn. With it came the undercurrent of desire that she always felt when she was around Kyle. These weren't her feelings but his. Ava worked every day to strengthen her shields so that she could block out people's emotions, but she still couldn't keep out sudden ones, or in Kyle's case extremely strong emotions. She pulled her winter cote in closer, not because she was cold, the barn was heated, but to help with visualizing her shield. She needed to block out Kyle's emotions, they were making it difficult to concentrate on her training. 

""You were a foot off that time Ava, you have to focus!"" Kyle's gruff reminder of how poorly she was doing didn't sit well with her and she glared at him. ""Don't look at me like that, you know how important it is to concentrate or you will never be able to control your powers.""

Her fingers twitched, aching to blast him with an icy wind. ""If you could keep your libido in check during practice maybe I would hit the target more often!"" Her green eyes glowed slightly, power welling up inside of her begging to be released. She turned her attention from him to the target, her right hand flying out, with it a bolt of ice. The ice impacted the target dead center, bringing a satisfied smirk to Ava's lips. She turned on her heel to face Kyle, ""I can't have this consent cloud of lust surrounding me, so either tone it down or leave."" Her voice held an edge of the same ice as her powers, like a promise of what she could do if crossed. 

Kyle looked stricken, ""You know it's not lust, Ava. You're my best friend and I've loved you for years. I'm just worried about your safety if you can't learn to use your magic to defend yourself.""

The pain she felt radiating off of him made her regret her harsh words. ""I'm sorry, I know it's not lust. But I don't feel for you that way, you've always been my best friend, my brother. I really wish that you were my protector Kyle, but you're not and I think you need to back off for a while. At least until we can find who ever is my protector. This hovering you've been doing lately is driving me insane. I am safe here, William made sure of that."" She walked over to her friend and took his hand in hers, ""Maybe with some distance from me you'll finally be able to concentrate on finding your caster. They are out there, and they will need your help, if they aren't already in need of it."" She let go of his hand, letting it fall to his side, and walked out of the warm barn into the chill of the winter night. 

Away from Kyle's bombarding emotions she was able to breath easy again. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. The vision flowed through her again, like looking through an old glass window, not quite clear. All she could make out was a snow white wolf with bright blue eyes. In his eyes she saw an intelligence that could only be held by a human. She knew these eyes, she'd been dreaming of them for months, but only now was she certain that her protector was a wolf. Ava smiled to herself, content in finding another piece of the puzzle and headed into the surrounding forest."

"event","A biting chill past through the thin barrier that his jacket gave him; small puffs of white air escaped his mouth with each breath. Michael welcomed the frigid air, a nice change from the heat filled dreams that kept him waking each night. Ice crunched underfoot, threating to throw off his balance as he ran. He paid it no mind, he needed this release. To feel his two legs propelling him forward, hands clinched as he pumped his arms, gaining speed. It was easy to dodge in and out of the tall Aspen trees, easier than it should have been for a normal human. He pushed back that thought by concentrating on another burst of speed. It wasn't long before he could barely feel the chill of the icy air around him, his own body heat warding it off like a protective shield, one better than any jacket could create. His footfalls becoming more panicked the warmer he felt. Michael slowed his pace to a slow jog before coming to a complete stop by one of the old Aspen trees that surrounded him. He stretched his arm out to the tree and leaned against it, catching his breath, trying to calm his heart. When he closed his eyes to take a deep breath the memories hit again. Not real memories, just dreams remembered, of being something he knows he could not be. 

His nostrils flared taking in the scents of the forest around him, bring the dream that he was running from back to the forefront of his mind. Running, why did he think this would help him escape the dreams? In so many of them he is running, chasing, hunting. The feel of the snow crunching under large paws, the thrill of scenting a deer and bolting off after it, all crashed into Michael at once. With his other hand he smashed his fist into the tree. It vibrated under the impact, a dent left behind, speckled with his blood. He turned his back to the tree and sank to the ground. With his legs pulled up he buried his head in his arms and let out a loud scream into the empty night. If it was just the dreams it wouldn't bother him, as far as he could remember back he'd always been a wolf in his dreams. Now though, he felt different when awake too. Constantly needing to go running and his strength increasing faster than he thought possible since he hadn't done any weight training since high school. He swore that his other senses were becoming more heightened as well but he tried to write it off as his over active imagination playing tricks with him. 

Michael leaned his head back against the tree and closed his eyes. There she was, clear as day, the woman who started appearing in his dreams at the same time his physical changes started. She was beautiful, long caramel color hair flowed down to her mid-back. Her eyes, lined with worry, slightly glowed the color of sea green. Those eyes were pleading silently with him, but he never knew what he was supposed to do. Never had the ability to ask since he was always a wolf. He reached out for her but she started fading, ""... Trust your heart Michael, and you'll find me..."" When he opened his eyes again he realized that the sun had started to rise, it's beams glittered off the snow cover ground and trees around him. He sighed and hit the ground with his fist, the action sending a painful reminder that he'd cut open his hand on the tree before."

"event","I miss dancing. True I haven't been in dance since second grade when I ditched tap and ballet to follow in my brother's foot steps with soccer and my sister's with basketball. I quit soccer after I got moved up from micro soccer, just wasn't fun for me. Sorry Pat. I sort of stuck with basket ball. Played it up through Jr. High. Wasn't any good at it though, but they liked me cause I'm tall. My parents would make fun of me because I guess I would run down the court like a dancer would across a stage. Toes pointed and all. I couldn't help it. I always regretted leaving dance. Even when I was little I wished I stayed with it. I really don't know why I never asked to go back. 

Now I dance for myself. Usually by myself too. I dance with Natty, she loves it. I have no rhythm now which is sad but it doesn't stop me. Today I realized that I should probably stop listening to Shakira on the iPod while I'm riding my bike. It is great music for keeping me up beat and going which is nice, but when I hop off my bike to wait at a red light I noticed that I have been dancing. I've been dancing at the red lights for who knows how long now. No wonder people in their cars give me strange looks. 

Is this going to stop me from listening to Shakira or for that matter dancing when I'm listening to dance worthy music? Probably not. I've been doing it this long with out caring why stop now that I realize I am doing it? So if you want to see a chubby chick dance to her own music at red lights you better move to the small town of Woodburn."

"event","I apparently am not very good at making friends. At least not friends that I can see face to face and get together with to do things. Internet friends? People that live in other sates that I probably wont see or at least only see maybe once a year? Those I can make. I don't know why they are easier for me to make either because I don't feel like I do anything different. I try to be open about the type of person I am. True I don't talk much until I get to know the person better and feel more comfortable around them, that's the same on the internet as well. I'm always friendly with at least one or two of my co-workers. I know I can call them up for a favor, ride, borrow something and they do the same with me, but am I going to get an invite to hang out? No. Just never seem to break away from ""she a nice person I know"" to ""she's my friend.""

Sadly there are a few problems with internet/long distance friendships. One of which is the fact that some people aren't completely honest about themselves. It can range from full on different identity to just puffing themselves up a little, changing things that they wish were true. Or you get the people who are extremely emotional. Now I'm a very emotional person too. I guess however that is one of the things that I like to omit from my internet-self. It's more difficult to talk misunderstanding through because they can literally cut off all contact with you and you may never hear from them again. I have had my fair share of these friendships, but they almost all lead to too much drama for me, and sometimes I go with out internet for longish stretches and I can't get back in contact with them again (most of my recent ones have been on the World of Warcraft game). So I haven't really bothered with reaching out to other players on the game for a while now. 

However last month I had another player reach out to me. It was a nice feeling, to have someone going out of their way because they wanted to talk to me. That's when I realized that I was actually getting a little lonely. They have the same night owl hours that I have giving me someone to talk to when Stef and Nat have already gone to bed. We mainly just talk about the game, movies and random what nots. I had forgotten the little bit of a high I get when I make a new friend. 

Now to only figure out how to get people I see out ""IRL"" to want to be my friend as well."

"event","If I could have any psychic power, I would want to be an empath. There is so much miscommunication going on because we hear different tones of inflections in what people say to us. We may hear exactly what they tell us, but the way we perceive their body language and tone often leads us to believe different than what they are saying. What one person may mean as a joke can come off harsh and condescending to the other person. Then if the person becomes offended by it drama can soon follow leading to a possible fight all over some dumb little thing someone thought would be funny to say. These sample situations are not the only reason. I am a skeptic for some reason when it comes to people's sincerity to me. It may stem from growing up and having friends tell me one day that I am their most trusted friend to a few days later being told that we were never really friends, with out really being given a reason for the sudden change. I didn't have a rough childhood, like some who seem to have a reason to be jaded. Was just used one time too many as a pawn in others lives, willing to give my all to protect my friends, but discarded when no longer needed. 

I don't want to read minds. I think one's mind is the most valuable thing a person owns. While I might not like what they are thinking, if they take the time and actually tell me something, I want to know if it's the truth. And also I would like to know if I'm over reacting when I feel like I have been dissed in some way. Or when someone compliments me or some project that I have done, I want to know with certainty that they do believe what they have told me and are not just saying it to make me happy because they care about me. To know that they do care about me and don't feel obligated to care. 

Yeah, it would be nice to be an empath."

"event","The fire in the hearth illuminated the room with flickering light. Rain splattered against the roof and windows, keeping a constant thrumming drifting through the tiny cabin. The rain soaked clothes hanging by the hearth had started to dry. The two occupants of the cabin sat in front of the fire, wrapped in blankets leaning against each other's backs. An almost empty bottle of wine sat next to them, neither bothering with a glass. The woman reached over, grabbed the bottle and took another swig of the wine. She rested her head on her companion's shoulder and sighed contently, letting the warmth of the fire and alcohol chase away any cold lingering in her body. The man leaned his head on her shoulder, their cheeks now resting against each other's. The wind rattled the windows with an eerie howl, bringing the rain pelting down faster. 

""Mmm, I love the rain,"" the woman's voice was groggy. A chuckle answered her, it was a deep rich chuckle that brought a smile tugging at her lips. ""What's so funny?""

""You. I would have never thought to go running out in the woods while it was pouring rain."" He chuckled again, shaking his head slightly. ""You are some kind of crazy. An amazingly beautiful crazy,"" his voice trailed off. 

A rush of heat flooded the woman's cheeks making her internally curse her girlish reactions, hoping that he couldn't feel the difference where his cheek touched her's. She cleared her throat and put the wine bottle back beside them, but before she could withdraw her hand his closed around it. Her heart skipped at the touch and she suddenly couldn't remember how to move. 

With her hand frozen under his, he whispered, ""I love you, more than you'll ever know."" He closed his eyes and took comfort in the feel of her hand in his. Neither said a word, the thrumming of the rain and crackling of the fire filled the silence with a harmony that could only be found in a moment like this."

"event","I have a problem. Not real serious of a problem until I think about the fact that it relates to my desire to participate in NaNoWriMo. My problem? I can write small drabbles like I did yesterday just fine. It was a little difficult to know what to write but as soon as I got the idea it flowed just fine. What I am finding myself not able to do is work on ideas for my story for NaNoWriMo. I tell myself if I just open OneNote and get some of the ideas down it'll give me something to work with and I can move from there, but for some reason I don't. I sit down at the computer and I'll browse the the internet, play WoW, heck even play BeJeweled for longer than I care to admit but I can't get myself to take that first crucial step to help get my story to come to fruition. 

I think it's because I am afraid of what people will think. I want to please people and impress them. While I'd like to just write for myself, Stefan pointed out that even if it's a small part of me, I do want my stories, my ideas seen and read by people. Even if I don't make money at it or anything I want my ideas enjoyed by others. I get lost in my own stories and I want others to be able to do so as well. However, I fear they wont like them, and instead of taking that chance I keep them to myself, trapped in my mind where they are safe. I had such an easy time writing before when I thought that I was an awesome writer, but as I've gotten older and of course read more works by others, not just published, I have come to realize that I'm not all that good. I have gotten better, but I still feel inferior to what I need to be to be able to bring these characters to life in such a way that does justice to them. 

NaNoWriMo is not for other people it is for the writers. To help people get their ideas out. As always it is up to the writer if they want to share what they are working on. So why am I worried about this story? I really don't know. I want to be able to participate and achieve the 50,000 word goal this year. To prove to myself that I can finish something that I start. Then I think about all the other projects that I have started right now that need to be finished and I cringe. If I devote time and energy to this right now I am most likely going to continue to leave those other projects unfinished and how is that going to make me feel? What if I get started come November 1st and a few days later I lose interest? I mentioned it to Tara, telling her that she should do NaNoWriMo with me because I know she has been really wanting to get back into writing. In all honesty I didn't expect her to take off with it as much as she has. She has been more driven with her story and really getting into the whole community of it and I wish that I was able to get myself to do that as well. I have excuses that could fill the oceans but none of them change the fact that I am struggling and it's my fault. 

In the dead of night I make plans. Always planning, but never taking the actions needed to see through my plans. The apartment is still not moved into, I never pushed us to get that done or even started for that matter. I had five days off and I didn't really do anything during that time, my latest excuse being that for the last few days my lower back has been hurting like crazy, making it hard to do much. The video project that I have been wanting to do and planning in my head for over two months isn't done.  The one thing that I seem to be able to do lately is get myself ready and to work on time; there I give my all working as hard as I can. I wish I was able to bring that task oriented mindset back home with me to accomplish my goals and projects at home. I guess I just have to try harder."

"event","It was quiet now. The sun had long since set, taking the tourists back to their hotels and bungalows. The couple sat looking out over the ocean below, only a hairsbreadth of space between them; neither making the small movement needed to close the gap. They hadn't spoken a word since the sun started setting. The beauty of it seemed to make anything either felt like saying inconsequential. The cold ocean air rode the wind now and she shivered, realizing that her thin shirt wasn't enough to keep her warm through the night. This realization saddened her, she didn't want to leave this spot; didn't want to risk losing this moment she had right now. Content filled her as she felt the heat radiating off the person next to her, chasing away the biting chill the wind brought. She sighed, settling into her spot a little more but couldn't help another shiver as the wind blew past them again. Her friend noticed the shiver, it was more abrupt than the first. He took off his jacket and wrapped it around his friend's shoulders. She looked up into his eyes, a single look conveying the question of if he would be fine with out the jacket. A single nod was all she received before he returned his attention to the stars stretching out before them. The space between them however had closed, and she couldn't help but notice. He hadn't left his arm around her shoulders or anything, but he was leaning into her side, resting there. Her heart sped a little as he settled more comfortably by her. Still though, neither said a word. The girl's mind was racing around wondering what all this meant for them, but all that came to a stop when he rested his head on her shoulder. She simply rested her's on top of his and took a deep breath, savoring the cold salty air. The silence continued to stretch beyond the two, out past the ocean to the sparkling stars."

"event","Today Stefan got offered a job at Levi's, sadly it's only part time. So Stef is mulling it over, comparing the pros and cons of it. I just hope that what ever he decides to do it's because he feels that is what God is telling him to and it works out for the best. 

Since it's Monday I had my PointGirls video that I needed to do. While filming it went fine (even with missing questions and talking about NaNoWriMo), the editing really got to me. Tara was nice enough to let me install her editing program that she'd gotten for her birthday and it's been nice to use. It's been great with working on my big project that I have, but today it just decided that it was going to hate me. I'd gotten the editing done aside for one little cut I wanted to make right at the end of it. I thought I had hit the button to make said cut, but instead the program goes wiggy on me. After trying to undo/redo things and having it not help I closed out and tried reopening it. Well I'd lost half of my video and with it the editing I'd done on it. Just to make it worse the program was still acting up. Programs hate me, it's very true. 

Now I know that some of the fault probably lies with me. I didn't save at any point in it so I wasn't able to just go back, or even attempt to. I would say it's because I'm just really out of it today, but honestly how many times does it take saying that you are ""out of it"" to realize that you were really never ""in it."" I am an airhead and often forget to do things, even simple commonsense things. So maybe I am the problem, not the  programs I work with. My webcam sees me sit down for something and it tells the programs, ""She's back! Prepare yourselves!""

I opened a new project and started all over and this time it went just fine. Looking back at it though I realize that I did however forget to save at any point during the whole editing process, and because of this problem I have I will probably always have trouble with computer programs."

"event","Starting today Tara and I are going to write every day for about a month to help us get ready for NaNoWriMo. I've been wanting to participate in this for years now and am really looking forward to this year. I have an idea for a story that has been pinging around in my head for a few weeks now. I want to be getting ready on the story so when November 1st hits I have direction. You can do outlines and character sketches but no actual writing on the book before November. The problem is that's how I normally start a story. I get an idea and write on it. Yes I do an outline but it doesn't come until I've written a scene or two. So I've been having a difficult time getting my thoughts out onto paper or onto my computer. I feel like it could be a fun story but if I can't get it out then I wont know for sure. I've even been hesitant to really tell anyone about my ideas because when I start to it sounds wrong, like I'm not able to convey properly what I see in my mind. 

All this is probably hindered by the fact that lately I've been feeling a touch under the weather. Between that time of the month and people being sick around me it's understandable that I would be. I've been tired a lot lately even though I get between 6-8 hours of sleep, sometimes a little more. We've been having a difficult time getting food shopping done because we have to figure out a way to transport it back home on our bikes, and while that means we can bring home more than if we walked, it's still not much. Looking forward to our car being fixed so that I can do a real shopping trip and have a full kitchen again. Things are still tight for us, Stefan's hours keep getting more and more cut as time goes on. Thankfully though the few hours I'm getting is helping offset it at least a little bit. He had a job interview with Levi's last week and waiting to hear back from the manager (he was out of town for a week at some big meeting). Hopefully he can get another job soon because we can't keep up at this rate. 

Natalia is doing well. Her speech is starting to clear up and she's talking more. Though sadly she has seemed to finally hit the ""terrible twos"" stage. It's still more manageable than some toddlers I've seen but it is a noticeable and annoying change for us. One of the side effects for her of this stage seems to be she now refuses to clean up her toys, or really anything. She was so good with it before but since moving into this apartment she's decided she would rather throw the toys at me than pick them up when I ask. She's been acquainted well with the timeout chair. She still does really well when she is out and about with us which is good because I'm not sure I'm ready for her to be a little terror while we are trying to get things done. 

Anyways I'm feeling a little off right now so I am going to bring this rambling mess to a close."

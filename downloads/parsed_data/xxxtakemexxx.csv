First of all, I want to apologize with all the shit i've done. 


I want to apologize to Tori, because she's amazing and deserves the best things in the world to happen to her. I realized that I really miss her as a friend... I'm going down to California soon and I would love to say hi... But I fucked shit up, so I guess it migh not happen. Anyways, I know Tori won't read this, but I still hope everything is perfect in her life, because she's been through enough of it to hate it.... And she needs some perfection and hapiness. Tori, you're incredible, never forget that. You're so rad. I miss you like hell, girl. I miss being such a dork with you. 

I want to apologize to Myself. Because I've not really been... me. I've been this girl who doesn't give a fuck about anybody's feelings. That's not okay. It's not. 



I want to apologize to Sara...  I hope she finds out who she is soon, because I can't handle her going after other girls anymore. 

I'll keep on going with this... But I need to motivate."

The first thought is to you, miss clark. 


You never really understood, heartbreaker. You, little girl, always were thinking that you had gotten me down. 

The horrible thing is that for a while you were the one who really started to make me not care. And damn it all to hell, for a little while I actually thought you were charming. 

I hope that you understand now. 

Understand why I did what I had to do.

I don't feel that bad. I feel fine until that horrible acidic feeling draws trails of fire along my throat. Is this what ""eating me from the inside out"" is? I feel myself fading. All I want is to be held. To go to sleep with another next to me. So that I know I have something to cling onto if I fade away in the night. Like a shadow, joining that purpetual darkness. Oh, god, I don't want to fade away. I want to be bold. Be here. I am glad that I actually ate something without puking it up today. It was some of my grandmas chicken soup that she made for my mom.

Life is on repeat, make it fucking stop. Trying to gain what you have lost; perceiving the same mistake again. You cannot have back what you tossed away. Why can't anyone see such an atrocity?

This is my mantra...

I am a selfish cunt...

I can't stand this tightness in my throat. I can't stand having this feeling of rejection. I can't stand to see you two being so fucking perfect together. I can't stand it. I can't stand knowing that I hurt you during sex. I can't stand how this is the 4th time that it's been me who didn't make my other's heart race. I can't stand it. I can't. I can't stand knowing that all my friends my age don't understand. I can't stand being here. I can't stand how it's me.I am not enough. 

Here is my game plan: Stop being what people want me to be. Stop this whole ""happy"" thing. Start being myself again. I hate how everyone gets to know me from the ""you have such a good outlook on life and you're so positive!"" level. The truth is, I prefer not talking. I need to get back to my roots. Learn to love myself again."

When you said you thought you were falling in love with me... Was that just a whim? Some sort of grasp for a tender moment? With grubby fingers I still cling onto the idea like a child. I ask these things because if you are jumping from one thing to another, it means Maya may be a forbidden fruit in your mind, nothing more. The grass is greener on the other side... I don't want you to get hurt, nor do I want you to hurt Maya. It's easy to fall, but getting back up is quite the trial. I trust your judgment. I can only be selfless for a good cause. I care about your happiness. Keep in mind that I also need to get my needs known. This means I won't feel all right with anything until I have a good stance on the subject.

It's making me bounce in my chair. I shouldn't be dealing with this so well. It's shocking. I am remembering all the times we spent together. Like that first day we met? JamisonParker and snuggling in the grass. Do you remember making sushi and meeting my Aunt? Jesus, that was all but nerve-racking. I remember being in that silly motor vehicle, looking up at the stars and tracing lines all over your body. Seeing planes of skin and memorizing ever curve... I also remember taking you to that pirate party. I was so happy that night. I wouldn't have felt any of those things if you hadn't been there. I can experience more of them, just not in the same way. That's why I'm not mad at you, it's because you make me feel so happy. I still want to laugh and cry at the same time... All because of you.

There's no place like home

Smash all your mirrors
I promise you, they lie
Could you see what I see
If your eyes were mine?

If your eyes were mine..."

The lines on my face are fading 
Such as these jaded words which nubile fingertips scribble 
So intently onto your back

Don't you breathe
We need to stop time

Eyes are filled with with notions of affections 
I would do anything
oh, anything
To make you love me
Love me

A voice quivers 
A question is asked
Lips pull into a smile 
Words slip across 

Don't you breathe
Oh, don't you dare take a single gulp of air
I need this moment to never end....."

Each and every time your lips met mine... I felt my whole body tingle. I was having trouble breathing because you made me feel so wonderful. So beautiful... You let me have my predatory, dominant ways without a complaint. Whispers in the heat of an oncoming rush... You let me stop and didn't urge me to continue (even though I wanted to desperately... The need to feel my fingers penetrate you deeper was overwhelming). I could say all the things we did together, but you already know. It's been a long time, but now I suddenly feel right. Like I have a purpose. I don't know where I am going, but I do know it will be with you."

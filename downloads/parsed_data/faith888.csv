"event","I'm back again. Back in my stupid funk of depressed confusion. Everything is distracting and breaks my concentration. 

I went to a ""positive thinking"" meeting  earlier today at 8am to 12pm, it was mandatory pretty much, (for my job at albertsons) I got a button that says ""life is terrific""......
yeah..........Thats not exactley how I'm feeling right now, but I'm trying., trying to break my ""glass is half empty"" complex. 

Have you ever been so depressed and tired and blah, that just thinking about how depressed you are makes you break into really loud laughter? Well it just happened to me and I got a dirty look from the colledge student on the computer next to me, because I'm in a library. I got off the bus that took us to the meeting in escondido, Sat in the break room for awhile, got an interesting combination at coldstone (banana ice cream with butterfinger mix in) and then came to the library. I'm trying to kill time because I'm working a double shift but I don't start till four. It's almost 2pm in like 10 minutes....

Okay time to sleep............oh wait I'm in the library..."

"event","Melissa and I went to Mexico again this month and I looked for my baby marcos, and I found him! but they buzzed all of his adoreable hair off!!! But he was still cute and still loved it when I played peek-a-boo with his reflection in the sliding, (mirror) closet door. But again when I had to leave......he started wailing. It made me very upset. I wanted to turn around and get him out of his crib and apologize and hold him, but I couldn't because I did have to leave. everytime I go....I have to leave...I can't stay. And I won't be able to stay next time either. Which is so depressing, but yet I look forward to it evertime.

I havn't written on live-journal for so long, that when I get online tonight. I get  online and read everyone else's enrtys I feel like I've missed something. I miss all my friends, and I hate that I never get to see you. And I hate my job because as soon as everyone else gets off work.....I have to go to work.  Pray for me! love you guys!!! 


      God bless!  :)"

"event","why is it? every time I think I get it, I start to realize I don't-

why is it? when I urgently need my brain to work I realize that it won't-

why is it? that the moment we think life is grand, and we're as light as a feather-

why is it? when we're blissfully happy,that our world comes crashing down altogether-

'I like to think it's God carefully watching, for the moment we get to comfy-

I like to think it's God reminding us we're bound for something far more lovley-

"event","Today Melissa and I went to Encenada in Mexico to the orphange on a one day missions trip thing. I was so uncomfortable when I got there. And I was like wait why did I come I'm not that good with older kids....or am I??? but I didn't have a chance to find out anyways because this guy who ran the place called out that he was taking the first group over the aids/hiv baby house!! So I went I don't know why because I had no intention of touching them but this fourteen year old boy was putting on latex gloves and changing this little boy named ""Marcos""' diaper and  the kid was all could you hold him real quick while I change her(another of the babies)?? and I was like ""no!"" ""I mean....no..."" then I looked at him and I fell in love!! And then I was like ""um yeah...I'll hold him!"", and I barely put him down the whole time we were there! I seriously cannot wait to go back. It's funny, some things you think you would like make you bored out of your mind, and some things you think you're really not going to like, you do. Almost to the point of crying when it was time to go. But anyone would have cried looking in at the confusion in his eye's as to why I, like a few others are leaving him, when he was really starting to like me."

"event","Well I asked for it and I got it. Say hello to Submarina's newest employee!!! My first day is sometime next week. It seems like everythings coming together! Things have been so chaotic for months on end and I was so overwelmed I didn't even want to think about anything! But it seems ""finally"" that ever decision is going in a direction in stead of standing still blocking my vision. 
I realized that the Joshua  Proghram with all the kids there would probably not be a good fit because of my anxiety attacks, because I'd be there for nine months.
But I've still been praying about Romania. More often lately and I know it would be a really good thing for me and I can't help but hope that i get to go. Even with a couple horror stories from melissa....   :)"

"event","I'm tired of life, and I know that sounds bad, but it's true. I'm just done! With the whole dang mess!  In fact to me it's not worth it at all. So many things are all wrong and I definately do not have the energy for them.
also, last night my parents said if I didn't get a job by the first of the month, they would start charging me rent and since I don't have a job they would start taking money out of my savings account. So today i went job hunting yet again. Two of the place's were nice enough to let me fill out an application at least, but every other place said a quick ""thanks but no"".

I've been thinking of moving to arizona in july and working there, and going to ""Arizona state university"", because I know I could get in. thats where my aunt is ""going back to school"" at because they have a great indian proghram down there. ""go to school for free because your indian "" is pretty much the thing. which i have to say is pretty good.  only I would have to have a car and a license.  
A car.....how could I get that?
oh yeah!!!  A job.....oh for pete's sake kill me now..."

So I got up and Lael, Melissa, and I went walking around the track for about two miles. It was fun...except for the part where I fell on my butt in the mud...I was kind of shocked. But Melissa and Lael started laughing which made me laugh. To bad my dave matthews sweatshirt is covered in mud now...
Its my warmest sweater and I wanted to where it tonight but o'well...it was worth the laugh.  :)"

It was still kind of weird playing guitar in front of a group of people. But at least neither one of us had to do it alone. I think I'm getting over my ""performing in public"" weird-out thing. Which is very good news because I was done with it!
well I have a busy day of laundry a head of me.  I waited till I had no clothes left and now there's a pile as big as me.....wait.......I think it's moving....."

"event","yesterday was guitar class......and it was great. I always have fun there even thought I already know a big portion of the songs we go over pretty well. And anyone who would have looked at me yesterday could tell, I was not likeing the song we played because I had never heard it before, and I was seriously not getting the hang of it. So I was inncredibly annoyed at myself, because I usually get songs pretty quickly. And today I know it much, much better but I have to remind myself that everything you want to be good does infact take practise.  And that is so frustrating because things I enjoy to do, I want to do well and sometimes my patience is lacking.

today I'm stressing about giving me testimony at the Abeels house. it's sad for me to admit but I still have no idea what to say? what should i say about my past? and what should i glide over? i used to love to write, still do actually. but when i used to write it was so exciteing. I had a blank canvas to work with where anything and everything could happen. but it's different with this. I'm also struggleing with a problem i thought was finally over, only to see i still have a spark of it. which always turns into a fire and i have no water to put out the fire with except maybe my tears. man that sounds so melodramatic!! And i hate crying about anything, and everything. especially anything to do with me. 
I'm going to go do the mother load of all dishes now. joy."

it's horrible.... but you can always tell the dreaded morning when you wake up and know something is......different. It's crazy that you never know whats differnt in that moment, but you realize the difference. It's kind of like this part in my favorite book that goes.....

""Or you'd just passed by one of those puddles in the street with gasoline rainbows in them. I mean you'd be different in some way-I can't explain what I mean. And if I could, I'm not sure I'd feel like it.""
 
My trip to the dentist went quite well.....except for the fact that I have two very large cavities.
but some good did come of that day. Ever since I became afraid to drive, everyone has asked me why I'm not driving, it didn't bother me. yesterday my sisters ""dental hygenist"" asked me why i wasn't driving yet. All i could do was blankly stare. but that did it....I drove home from Santa Isabel, stopping at the ""Julian pie company"" to see Lael, who was by strange coincidence was NOT there....in fact no member of the Lloyd family was there. o'well I got a great pie. 
Anyways i drove three different times later that night too. And once in the rain...which was fun.
should it be fun or is that a....bad sign??"

People always told me second year was the worst shit no!!! Third year sucks! I have my first practical exam tomorrow so I'm scared!!!! Hate exams let alone practicals. I had my last uni tut last week so that means no more uni classes!!!!!!!!! Yay!

I've heard back from a few jobs for my graduate year. Royal Adelaide, Flinders Medical, St. Andrews and Wakefield have accepted me. I got another call from one more hospital this morning... I'm still waiting on Ashford though. I really want to get into theatre nursing and Wakefield said they could offer me a year of it so that seems like my best option so far.

Michael and I are good. We got together with a few people last wkend to watch the footy and yes port got killed :( The cats also got beaten so I couldn't resist and sent Ben a message... it was an awesome game coz the cats got beaten only by one goal in the last few seconds so I sent Ben this message saying 'Did you see that last goal?' haha.

I have to post some of my 21st pics up here they are so funny.

My sister has moved out with her bf so I'm moving into the bigger room yay!!!

I don't get many things right the first time
In fact, I am told that a lot
Now I know all the wrong turns, the stumbles and falls
Brought me here

And where was I before the day
That I first saw your lovely face?
Now I see it everyday
And I know

That I am
I am, I am
The luckiest

What if I'd been born fifty years before you
In a house on the street where you live?
Maybe I'd be outside as you passed on your bike
Would I know?

And in a wide sea of eyes
I see one pair that I recognize
And I know

That I am
I am, I am
The luckiest

I love you more than I have ever found a way to say to you

Next door there's an old man who lived to his nineties
And one day passed away in his sleep
His wife, she stayed for a couple of days
And passed away

I'm sorry, I know that's a 
strange way to tell you that I know 
we belong
That I know
That I am
I am, I am

I'm not your baby girl 
So I've done ugly things and I have made mistakes 
And I am not as pretty as those girls in magazines

So what if I'm no baby bird hanging upon your every word?

You're not some baby boy 
Why you acting so surprised 
You're sick of all the rules 
Well I'm sick of all the lies 
Now I've held back a wealth of shit I think I'm gonna choke 
I'm standing in the shadows with the words stuck in my throat 
Does it really come as a surprise when I tell you I don't feel good? 
That nothing ever came from nothing man 
Oh man ain't that the truth 

Why do you love me

"event","<b>Virgo Key words - I  Serve</b>

Your restrained, shy and somewhat serious exterior hides a soft and cheerful inner self which people appreciate once they get to know you. Often you are misunderstood on face value but worthy friends and associates see beyond the surface. 

Work and service are most important in your life and will be the prime outlet for your creative impulses. At times your desire to perfect every single details of a project, makes you prone to fastidiousness, overwork and dissipation of valuable resources on irrelevant aspects of work and friendship. 

Some people regard you as highly critical, though your motive stems from an innate ability to analyse, organise and systematically solve problems. Be aware that you must avoid the temptation to unconsciously nit-pick each and every person that comes you way or you may actually have the opposite effect than that desired. 

Your life will only find true meaning in the ideal of helping and serving others, leading a life of self sacrifice and simplicity. Health, hygiene and food or related industries should allow your nature to unfold to its optimum and contribute valuably to the world."

She always belonged to someone else

I've had you so many times but somehow
I want more

Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved

I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
It doesn't matter anymore

It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along
My heart is full and my door's always open
You can come anytime you want

Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls

"event","I had to go into hospital over the wkend. I went to the emergency department of Royal Adelaide Hospital on Sunday afternoon because I was feeling really sick! I had the WORST abdominal pains ever. I was at work and felt really sweaty, hot and had this really uncomfortable pains in my stomach. It went right across and through to my back. The nurses where I work said I looked really pale. I was only at work for about an hour or so and then got sent home. It just came on so fast.

I threw up THREE FUCKING TIMES! Gross I saw what I ate for lunch in there. I swear it has put me off eating hot chips ever again.

So I went to the hospital Sunday night and they gave me Morphine and some other drug. They also put up a drip. They had no idea what really was wrong with me. They thought it could have been my appendix or ovaries but they didn't really know. The doctors and the nurses were really nice. I was in so much fucking pain... it was unbelievable. My Mum said I was probably experiencing what labour is like lol... no I wasn't pregnant! Anyway I got sent home last night THANKGOD I didn't want to stay in hospital over night. They gave me some Panadeine Forte and so far everything has calmed down. I still get this weird feeling every now and then in my abdomen but it isn't at all bad. I was crying and everything. Very bad.

Just thought I'd let you know. The rest of my wkend was good. Lol.

Yum I love that icecream. He had a really nice icecream peanut chocolate swirl or something. I had white chocolate icecream and M&Ms it was okay. Cookies and cream is heaps better though!

I have been writing my ethics essay for uni over the last week. I have finally finished. I will be happy passing. I really don't care. It is only 15%.

The holidays are coming up after Thursday. I'm working about 26 hours a week in the hols though. It will be good money coz I need the money bad..... coz I have to pay for all this stuff for my car very soon.

Justin wants me to go to Oakbank on Monday not sure if I will go! Lol. I've been before and it was pretty boring. He's going away this weekend with his mates up the river to Loxton. I hope they have fun. I know they will coz they will get pissed. I'm going out Saturday night with some of my friends to the city. That will be fun coz I haven't been out since the bus tour which is awhile ago now.

I'm staying at Justin's this Wednesday and Thursday. Thursday night his family and I are going to 'The Red Sea On Rundle'. For anyone who watches My Restaurant Rules will know what I'm talking about! If not then you will have no idea. But we're going there for tea for his Mum's bday. It should be interesting. I've heard its expensive there though :( I think its seafood :) So a plus and a minus lol.

I'm getting my hair cut and dyed on Thursday at Marion Hair and Beauty. I haven't been there before but my friend suggested it. So we will see how that goes!

I think that is about all my news for now. I start my clinical placement when the holidays end!!! Arghhhh! Lol.

We do love our seafood! The view was gorgeous on the balcony. We were sitting there while the sun was setting over the beach. Very nice!

After our meal we went to Marion and saw '50 First Dates'. I really liked it. It was funny. Justin and I both have the same sense of humour so that was good. Then we went back to his place and I drank a few vodka cruisers lol. His parents made me this really nice drink I think it was a mix of- white russian and snapps. It was so yummy. His parents are heaps nice. They have nice food at his place as well which is very important!

Then on Saturday we sat around his house and watched foxtel... haha. It was a good wkend. I came back here Saturday night coz I worked this morning.

I'm one of those annoying channel surfer people. Justin also said I can have a spa at his place sometime, YAY! I finally got an offer. I have been waiting for that for so long!!!! Lol. Anyway today I brought his easter present and its gorgeous. Lindt chocolate is the best!

I must go and have a shower. Then do some bloody readings for uni!

Ciao."

Other then that I was told on Saturday that Pete Murray is all sold out just like <lj user= ""illegal""> said!!!

I need some sleep. I'll talk to you guys when I've recovered."

"event","I watched 'Average Joe' last night- <B>What the fuck was she thinking?</b>

Stupid girl. She picked that LOSER over ADAM! What the hell?? Adam was the biggest sweetie ever. It was so funny when the present he brought her caught on fire... ahaha. His dates were so much fucking better than that other guy (I don't even remember his name). I mean IF I LIVED IN NEW YORK I WOULD GO AFTER ADAM! HE IS HOT!

Anyway, I hope her and that stupid guy break up within a month like they all seem to do from those reality tv shows.

Has anyone got Pete Murray's album? I'm thinking of buying it and I'm thinking of going to his gig at Flinders Uni next Thurs. I think he would be a good performer. I will have to convince Justin to come with me lol.

I confronted my friend just before about her boyfriend and we had a little talk coz he is walking all over her.... she was alright about it. She said she was glad that I cared... and that she was going to talk to him. So we will see what happens!

I'm going out tomorrow night... nothing much happening tonight. Have a nice weekend.

I also lost my earrings that Justin gave me for Valentine's Day. They were really cool ones. They were from Sportsgirl, they were silver, really long and dangly. I lost them BOTH! What the hell? Other than my shoes breaking and losing my earrings Saturday night was really fun. 

I loved it. The stairs on the bus were a bit fucked though. We were on the top level and had to keep walking up and down these really steep stairs. Lol I'm just glad I didn't fall over.

I saw someone from Bilo like I always seem to do when I'm out clubbing! I chatted to him for a little while in Church (we always see eachother there as well!!!). Some guy on the blocks at Church got shitty at me coz I told him I had a boyfriend coz he wanted to dance with me. I'm like GET OVER IT! I wanted to push him off. Lol. 

And everyone who lives in Adelaide <b>FROSTBITES</b> make the nicest slurpies ever. I had a strawberry daiquri. Yum, yum, yum. There were gay guys kissing at Frostbites as well. Lol. Must be where they congregate! I'd never been there before. They played pretty cool music. Can't think of much other gossip from that night it was just heaps of fun.

I think were going out not this wkend but the following for Bec's bday which will be great. Can't wait. This time it will be New Yorks and Shennanigans! Yeah I love both those places. Anyhow, Dr. Phil is on now. Cya."

I can't wait for tomorrow night. So much stuff is gonna happen. It'll be a wicked night. I think I'm gonna wear all of the above stuff that I brought today for tomorrow night. I tried it on before and it looked alright. My sister is doing my hair! Oh what a lovely sister I have she's gonna be using my straightner! Lol.

Anyway, there isn't much more goss. I'll fill you guys in after the wkend. I prob won't update till at least Monday coz I'm staying at Justin's all wkend. Have a nice time everyone!

"event","Okay, my news.... Justin and I are offically going out as of today! Yay!

I had a nice wkend. I went to the fringe with Justin, my sis and her bf and some of his friends. It was good. I saw Lehmo (I think thats the right spelling) at the fringe. He was pretty funny. Went out for tea after that at Glenelg. Then I went back to Justin's place and we watched foxtel... haha I love foxtel.

Sunday I had to work!!!! I started work at 2.30. I got up at like 12!! Fuck what a sleep in. Justin woke me up luckily. Work was alright. That was my second shift. My first was in low care on Saturday which was easy. Today I worked as well and tomorrow I work!!! I'm learning... so that is good! The residents are quite funny at times. I have stories to tell already!

I'm so fucking tired. My bones are aching. I don't know why. I haven't been to the gym since Thursday. Maybe it's all the running around I have to do for my new job. Actually on Saturday we had a big fucking walk as well coz no one could decide where they wanted to eat so we walked around half of adelaide, lol.

Anyway, I really can't wait for this wkend coz it's the BUS TOUR! I have been waiting for this wkend for ages haha. We are going to- Frostbites, Black Cat White Cat, Urban and the Church. It should be good. I've only ever been to the Church. I have heard the others are good. Hopefully they play heaps of rnb.

I went shopping Saturday with Bec. I brought heaps of new work clothes. It's all this sophisticated stuff! Blue pants, plain buttoned up shirts- nothing like I would wear otherwise! It is fun to wear that stuff though for a change. I do feel as though I'm important in my nursing uniform! Haha. Sorry Personal Carer Uniform! Lol.

I brought a top from Valleygirl which I might wear Saturday night. I think Bec and I are going shopping on Friday at Harbour Town and Glenelg. I'm looking for a cute denim skirt to wear out on Saturday night. I also saw this gorgeous pink and white playgirl bunny bag at Glenelg which I may have to purchase..... my money is pretty zilch at the moment though because I haven't been paid for a week since I quit at the supermarket and I won't get paid for another week! Arghhhhhh it's causing me stress!

I must leave now anyhow because Malcolm In The Middle is on. I just want to leave by saying Justin is a sweetie he sends me cute text messages!!!! Haha I'm heaps happy how stuff has worked out. I'm gonna go eat my white chocolate and watch Sex and The City later on if I can stay awake. Cya guys."

I went to the gym today as well and my fucking legs hurt!!! Lol see where exercise gets ya? ;)

I start my new job tomorrow. Well actually it is an orientation day! Fuck I'm still nervous though. It is such a relief that I have that stupid exam out of the way now though. Phewwwwwww, uni starts in 2 weeks!

<h2>Your Stripper Name is <a href=""http://www.quizdiva.com/brandy.html"">Brandy</a>!</h2>
You're the type of girl who got started dancing in clubs...<br>
And realized that you were so hot that you should turn pro.<br>
You're more of a go-go dancer than a stripper - getting down on stage, but not on laps.<br>
Dancing and music are what you're all about, though the cash tips are always a plus!<br>
You tend to stick to topless clubs, but if the pay is right, you'll take it all off.<br>
While you'll never turn porn star, you enjoy being the hottest cage dancer in town.

"event","These questions are from <lj user=""jennnej"">, thanks!

<b>1. What field of nursing are you hoping to get into, and why did you choose it?</b> I'm hoping to get into theatre. I think that area of nursing would be really interesting for me. I choose nursing as a career because I wanted to help people. I wanted to make a difference to someone's life. I wanted a job which I found rewarding. Also something which attracted me to nursing is probably the travelling which can be done with the career. I thought that was exciting.

<b>2. Why did you start a journal on LJ?</b>
I started a journal because I thought it would be fun. It is a good place to vent or just generally to express your emotions and receive the opinions of other people. I generally like receiving comments from people and getting their feedback.

<b>3. If you could only do one thing for the rest of your life, what would it be and why?</b> 
It took me awhile to think about this one but.... I would shop. I love shopping. Buying clothes, shoes and bags. I love the markets. I love shopping malls. I love looking for bargains. It's just fun. I only hate food shopping! haha.

<b>4. Where do you see yourself in 10 years?</b>
In 10 years I would be 29. Hopefully by then I will be successful in my chosen career- nursing. By that time I also hope that I have travelled many times overseas maybe even lived over there for sometime. I also hope to settle down, buy a house, a dog/cat (very important!!) and start a family. <B>Oh, and of course I will have my celica by then!</b>

<b>5. Who's your favorite person in the world and why?</b>
That is a tough one! I don't know if I have one favourite person. There are alot of people who inspire me which I think is important. My family, friends, tutors from uni and people I work with. I think it depends what type of mood your in to answer this question! Lol. Everyone is probably important at some stage in your life.

<b>THE RULES:
1 - Leave a comment, saying you want to be interviewed.
2 - I will respond; I'll ask you five questions.
3 - You'll update your journal with my five questions, and your five answers.
4 - You'll include this explanation.
5 - You'll ask other people five questions when they want to be interviewed.</b>"

I went to the doctors and they took a blood test. He said at the moment they will treat it as Tonsilitis and then just wait till Thursday when I get my results. 

It sucks coz my interview is tomorrow.... I can still go I rang the lady up and talked to her but she isn't going to take me on a tour of the Nursing Home. I wish I was just better for it though!!!

I took today off from work no way am I going in feeling like this and with this fucking rash! Lol.

Anyway, hope you guys feel better than me."

"event","To clarify, a poo bomb is a completely different animal than your standard poopy diaper. It involves copious amount of smelly yellowish muck, almost as if the little guy pooped out about half his own body weight. At least two, sometimes 3 or 4 wipes are needed. Also, while performing the changing procedure, there's a <i>very</i> high possibility that the baby will kick and scream in protest and get poop all over his feet.

Heidi has changes 2 poo bombs. Chris has changed one.

Before evan was born, I kinda figured that boys would be easier to change than girls. You know, no special bits for ook to get stuck in, that sort of thing. <i>This is not the case</i> It's amazing how well a yungun's twig and berries hide tiny deposits of poo inbetween the thigh and the <i>special</i> area. Which means it takes twice as long to wipe up, since you kinda have to gently shift his nads around at get to the hidden icky bits. This, of course, is a <i>wonderful</i> oppurtunity for Evan to experiment with the directional fire capabilities he came equipped with.

I have been <i>pissed on by my own son</i> 3 times. Heidi has experienced this once.

We will continue to keep score."

"event","Last Christmas, when C and I moved from our dark little one-bedroom apartment into a second floor 2 bedroom apartment (same complex), we did it so that I could have an office/study room, so the dogs would have a bit more room, and so that we could have more than one closet in which to actually put stuff away. 

<lj-cut text=""cut cause I was really long-winded"">

Well, it was finals the week(s) we moved, and he hurt his back, and we were generally very tired and freaked out. We were also heading down to Texas for a little over a week the day after I finished my last final. It was not what you would call a well-organized move. So my ""office"" ended up being general ""crap storage""... granted, it was mostly office-type stuff, but it also became the dumping ground of The Laundry Pile The Wouldn't Die, and anything else we didn't know what to do with. Time went by, and the thought of dealing with that room became unbearable. Finally, around May, I cleaned and organized the entry closet and the Big Ass Hall Closet. We had room to put stuff! You could walk into the 6x6 hall closet! Time was ripe to clean out the office. 

Yeah. well. Then the front office decided that we could have our washer and dryer installed, so we had to empty out the damn hall closet again. Guess where it all went? 2 weeks later, and have have a washer/dryer that took up most of the room in that closet. Back to square one... (although, we did manage to tame the Laundry Pile of Death, which helped a lot). 

After a few more weeks of picking at the ""office"", which we knew had to be a nursery soon, C got a totally energy spurt and cleaned out the whole damn room. We bought boxes, filled them, tossed a bunch of stuff, re-organized the hall closet to make room for more stuff.... and soon we had an (almost) empty room. Well, the closet in the nursery is basically storage for us, but I fail to see how a 4 week old baby is going to care. 

All we need was some furniture. You know, like a crib, and a changing table. Maybe a rocker, bookcase, perhaps a dresser. 

Well, last week we were killing time at lunch and came across a changing table on clearance for $27.50. This is an insanely cheap price for one of these, as the one we had wanted was $80. It was white, and we wanted to stay away from white because we just didn't care for it. But the price outweight the white bit, so we decided to go back after work and pick it up. Which we did, and it was on an even better sale - $17.49!!!

Yesterday, we (well, ok, Chris) put the thing together. I went through the baby clothes and things we've managed to pick up so far. We have: a million onesies (0-3mo), 2 sleepers (3-6mo), some cute stuff for 6-9. 9-12. We have 3 stuff toys (all of a fairly large size), a bunch of hand-made blankets from c's mom from when he was little, a changing table, a full set of bedding for a crib, a stroller and carseat, and Baby Snoppy wall stickers over the changing table and where the crib is going to be. I seperated out all the clothing by size, and put the newborn stuff in a basket on shelf on the changing table, as well as things like booties and hats in a small box. The couple packages of diapers are also on a shelf. The rest of the clothes are seperated out by size, and in different boxes. 

The thing is, when you walk by that room and look in, it looks like a baby will soon live there. Unlike a month or so ago, when it looked like a flea market gone wrong. My parents and grandparents are pitching in, and sending a check for the crib and whatever other furniture we can afford out of that money. I'm hoping to pull off the crib, crib mattress, and one of those rocker/gliders. My gram is also going to repaint and donate one of the bookshelves that used to be in my room in her house (they had a fire, and the shelf is fine... she just doesn't want to put it back up there). 

</lj-cut>

I get excited every time I walk past there now, on one of my many, many trips to the bathroom. It looks like the time is coming soon, now, and I'll finally get to meet the little bastard who has so gleefully been using my ribcage as a bongo."

"event","you know, there's a lot of jokes about pregnancy and wild mood swings, etc. i can tell you, it's all true. granted, my mood swings are generally fairly short into the ""crabby as hell"" side, but i tend to swing there fast and violently. chris isn't used to it, and he tends to look at me like i've grown a second head. at least he's stopped taking it personally, for the most part.

the other things i've noticed: i tend to drop things a lot. like, i'm holding something, and suddenly it's on the floor. i'm not picking it up, or moving it, or anything. it just falls out of my hand. my brain seems made of swiss cheese, and my attention span is nill. things go in my head, and straight out... or they kind of drift along and i can't get a lock on one thought long enough to actually, like, do anything with it. 

the final thing, and this is something they don't really mention in any of the books, is that all my internal organs are smashed flat under my ribcage... straight under my boobs, actually. and that's very, very, very uncomfortable. all this pressure, and no way to relieve it other than slouching with my pelivs tipped up and my shoulders back... which is real attractive at work, let me tell you."

"event","over the weekend, when i was awake and lucid, i did a little shopping on ebay for nursery stuff. i think most of the big stuff, like furniture and larger toys, are going to have to be purchased locally.... because even with the great online deals, shipping is crazy. and i'm not paying $50 to ship something when i can go down to my local Target and get it myself. 

anyway. we decided to go with a Baby Snoopy theme for the nursery. cause, you know, it's damn cute, and not quite as overused as Pooh. because we live in an apartment, we can't paint anything on the walls, or put up wallpaper borders (who DOES that anymore, anyway?) or anything like that. so we bought some Baby Snoopy wall clingies. they're essentially removeable stickers for the walls, windows, and whatever else. 

when we stopped by the front office today to drop off rent and our lease renewal stuff (with which we're getting our carpet cleaned for free... thank god!), the wall clings were there already! joy!

when i opened the box, i gasped in cuteness. chris squeeled like a little girl. heh.

now all we need is, like, furniture and we'll have a real nursery. oh, and i suppose a baby to go in it would be helpful, too."

"event","so. people wonder why i don't like being pregnant. in fact, today wendy told me i was basically the anti-poster child for pregnancy. well, here's my last week and a half....

<lj-cut text=""Let the tale of woe begin..."">

<b>saturday</b>
yes, i'm 6.5 months pregnant, but all my friends are going to a water park and i'll be damned if i'm not going too. so i buy a ""normal person"" swimsuit in a size bigger than i usually take and we hop in the car. after walking around all day and going down slides and stuff (yeah, i wasn't supposed to. bite me), i was getting kind of sore. my back, which has been giving me crap since i fell in january, is telling me that it's time to slow down. sure, so i decide to go down one more slide (one that i had been on several times without incident earlier in the day). of course, i sit wrong or something, and my back completely goes out. i sit around until it's time to leave, and i'm almost in tears with pain by the time we get into the car. by the time we get home, i'm tired, sunburnt, and so sore that i have to pull myself up the stairs using mostly upperbody strength (which i have little of to begin with). i fall into bed and asleep almost instantly. 

<b>sunday</b>
so, so very sore. i don't think i get out of bed all day, except to go to the bathroom... which isn't all that often. chris and i are both really red and painfully sunburnt. we spend the day trying to recover.

<b>monday</b>
ok, i'm still so sore i can hardly walk. i call into work, thinking another day of bedrest will help me recover enough that i can get back to life tuesday. by 4, i call c's mom, wondering if she knows anything i can do for my aching back. while on the phone with her, the pain i'm in more than quadruples. i'm sweating and in so much pain i can't stand it. i call c to come get me. he takes me to the ER, where they check the baby, give me a heat pack and some tylenol 3. then they send me home. i'm still in hella pain, and i've been throwing up before the hospital, at the hospital, and still when i get home. i call the ER back, and they tell me juice and crackers to settle my stomach. i manage to get some pills down without throwing them up, and blissfully pass out.

<b>tuesday</b>
i call into work, again, and have c bring me to the regular doctor. she gives me some vicodin and a test for a kidney infection. she also decides that i'm dehydrated, and i get an IV and a liter of fluids. this decision is prolly made because i threw up *again* while in the waiting room. we fill my script, and go home. i spend the rest of the day drugging myself into a stupor. oh, and i'm off work for a week, until my back fixes itself and my body regulates itself.

<b>wednesday</b>
still so much pain. the drugs are taking the edge off, but not really a lot. i have a physical therapy appointment. the PT doesn't do a whole lot for me... recommends i get a back brace, and gives me a couple excersies to do. i go home, take some more drugs, and wait for chris to get home from work. he gets home, and the pain starts up like it did on monday. so bad i can't stand it. i start throwing up again. back to the ER! this time, they give me another IV and 2.5 liters of fluid, and some anti-throwup medicine. after that's done, a pee test shows that i'm only slightly dehydrated still..... it's like 3 am before we get home, but i feel a lot better. 

<b>thursday</b>
i still can't walk, i still can't sit. when i lay on one side for more than 15 minutes, my leg gets a shooting pain in it. c has to help me dress from the waist down, because i can't lift my legs up high enough to do it myself. lovely.

<b>friday</b>
uh-oh, almost out of meds. back to PT, where this crazy lady makes me lay on my back (something i haven't been able to do for several MONTHS) and do all this crazy stuff. then she's all suprised when i can't get up, and c has to basically pull me. we leave, and i'm sore and pissed and sick to my stomach. i got home, take a couple pills, and pass out. again.

<b>saturday</b>
i decide that i need to get the hell out of the house. so we get some lunch and make a quick stop at target. we're gone less than 2 hours. i feel like it's been 2 days. i'm out of pain pills, but try to get some sleep anyway. it doesn't happen, and i don't sleep a wink all night. 

<b>sunday</b>
we're out of food, so we head to the nearest grocery store to make a quick shopping trip. this goes badly for me, and i'm really, really sore by the time we're done. i'm basically limping and leaning on the cart on the way out of the store. i ask c to take me to urgent care so i can get some more pain pills... so we go, and of course the doc gives me crap about ""overusing"" the pain meds (which i wasn't! i was using not only as directed, but i had thrown a bunch of them up during that whole dehydrated thing between tuesday and wednesday!). he gives me 4 more pills. i take 2 that night, and try to sleep. i'm not comfortable. my back isn't really getting any better. something needs to give, because there's no way i can go back to work monday.

<b>monday</b>
still not back at work. still in pain in bed. go back to the PT.. only this time, it's someone else. someone with a clue. and she figures out that the reason i can't sit or walk, or anything is because my damn hip is out of joint. seems my joints are so loose and so screwy that even midl correction to get my left hip into place has thrown my right hip out of place. so she finally gets then both in place, and sticks me in this belt/brace thing. i can walk! wee! i mean, it still hurts and is still sore, but the piercing pain with each step is missing. i get to wear this damn belty bracey thing ALL THE TIME, even when i sleep, until the baby comes. grrr. 

it doesn't take me long to realize that this belt thing cuts into my skin something terrible. it hurts like a bitch, but i'm mobile. ah, choices, choices. 

<b>tuesday</b>
back at work, finally. the first hour goes ok. then i start to get sore. and i can feel things shifting. by 2, i'm ready to leave. by 3, i'm almost begging to leave. c comes and gets me at 4:30, and i take a nice, long nap. now i'm sititng here, typing this. i'm going to have to try to get my hips back into place again, because something's not right again. i'm really rather unpleased about this belt cutting into me... and it makes me have to pee a hell of a lot. but they say there's not a whole lot they can do about it. grrr. 

</lj-cut>

so you see, i've had a bad, bad week and a half. idiot doctors, all of whom assumed that this was a muscle strain, or normal back pain. i have a decent pain tolerance, thank you, and i'm not being a wuss. i think when i start throwing up from pain, that should be a friggin clue, people! but i change insurance on thursday, so i'll get a new doctor. hopefully, this one will have a clue. i'd also really like some more pain meds, even if they're just for use when i go to sleep. cause i used the last 2 last night, and i have no idea how the hell i'm supposed to sleep tonight."

on the slightly longer list: Tristan, Peter, Felix... uhm, I think there's a couple more, but as I can't remember them off the top of my head, they can't be that important.

"event","i have a confession to make. i don't like being pregnant. i really, really don't. 

i know a lot of people are going to gasp in shock and dismay at that. i mean, a lot of women really get off on being pregnant. they glow. they feel wonderful. they walk around in a happy daze, knowing they are making new life.

well, making new life aside (which is neat and all, but not very obvious at this point), being pregnant is not a whole lot of fun. there are bathroom issues and breast issues that, while i'm not describing them in detail, you can rest assured they are not of the fun or even tolerable.

and when i do start to show, i'll have a million assholes that i don't know coming up to me, touching my stomach. i know it's going to happen because it happens to every pregnant woman. i feel like i should prepare a button that says something like ""you can touch my belly if i can rip your arm off and beat you with it, you fucking clod."" but as the type of people who will randomly fondle a stranger's protruding stomach like it's communal property are also most likely illiterate, i'll prolly skip it.

the books claim that i am halfway done with this. only halfway? sweet jesus, it's going to be a long summer. and not in that nice ""woo, it's summertime! i hope it lasts forever!"" kind of way."

"event","yeah, and not the fun kind of chronic, either...

for the past couple of days, along with assorted leg/back problems from falling back in january, i've been extrememly itchy. this is nothing new, as my skin hates me and any change in the weather. it also hates consistancy, as it will occassionally develop an allergy to a product i've been using for years. anyway, i was sucking it up and dealing. 

until yesterday morning, when i woke up after a night of hives with swollen hands and feet, and intense itchiness. i go to work, ignore it, and make it home again. 

by 6 pm, i'm basically covered from head to foot in hives. huge, red, puffy bumps all over. except my face, strangely. anyway, i call the doctor to see what i can take for it, seeing as how i can't take anything more than asprin in case it hurts the baby. an hour later, and i'm taking claritin and benedryl, and it's kind of helping a little. 

when i woke up this morning, most of the splotches were gone or faded, but the itchiness is still there. 

the doctor last night told me this might be CHRONIC for the whole pregnancy, because i've got sensetive skin and my hormones are all out of wack. lovely. that's just what i wanted.. a chronic condition. i'm going into see the docotor this morning, so we'll see...."

"event","yesterday was the third month checkup. no big deal, right? they ask a few questions, i ask a few questions, they listen to the baby's heart beat with the fetal dopplar thinger, and we're done. in and out in less than 30 minutes, right?

nope. for one thing, my little resident is trying to get me to breastfeed. she did, and she thinks it's wonderful. plus all the health benefits for the baby, blah blah. the thing is, i don't think i wanna breastfeed. i mean, maybe for a couple weeks or even a couple months. but once i go back to work, the portable food factory shuts off. so there was a big long conversation about that. 

skip ahead to baby listening time. i hop up on the table, pull down the pants a bit, and have goo spread on my belly. then she starts PUSHING down on my pelvis with this microphone thingy, trying to find the kid to listen to it. after about 10 minutes of pushing really, really hard, she gives up and goes to get a real doctor. he comes in, and proceeds to do the same thing, albeit more carefully and not as ouchy. still nothing. 

he also asks me if i've had any bleeding or cramping, etc, that would have signaled a miscarriage. which i haven't. anyway, i start to flip out a bit. they schedule another ultrasound for next tuesday to make sure the baby is still viable. 

so now i have to wait a week to see if my baby is ok. after reading stuff online and in my copy of ""What to Expect..."", we're more than likely fine. but. man. scary stuff. and here i thought once i passed the 12 week marker, i was out of the woods for the majority of this kind of thing."

"event","Yep, I'm being forced to watch upwards of <i>three</i> episodes of A Baby Story a <i>day</i>. I've learned to tolerate it: since we have like 5 episodes on the TiVo at any given time, we flip through them looking for people who aren't ugly and stupid, watch those episodes, and delete the rest. We watched them all at first, but the horror of watching people who have no business reproducinng (many of whom were from New Jersey, interestingly enough) do just that was too much to bear.

Now, while it's not too hard to find an episode with a couple intelligent and cute enough to watch, it's getting goddamn impossible to find an episode that doesn't feature a fucking water birth, wherin Mommy pops out a kid whilst soaking in the tub. I understand that putting a pregnant belly under water relieves pressure, and that's really great, but stop fronting like you're all fucking progressive and brilliant because you're having a ""natural, drug free-birth"" that's ""less of a shock for the baby."" Fuck you. Sure, the temprature difference between a nice cozy womb and the cold, cruel outside world might be a little jarring, but I'll bet you twenty dollars and a candy bar that by the time kiddo's all swaddled and in mommy's arms, s/he doesn't remember a goddamn thing. Natrual, drug-free births are bullshit, too: there's no reason childbirth should involve such extrordinary suffering! The whole ""drugs are bad"" thing has been beaten into everybody's head so deeply for so long, it's very likely that a good portion of the people who choose severe pain over an epidural or spinal block do it because of a knee-jerk reaction to drugs. Because, you know, thay're bad. And that's really a shame. It's worth noting that the women who have drug-free births are usually too exhausted too enjoy their first moments with their new child. And that's a shame, too.

And to those who elect to have drug-free childbirths because having a baby is ""a wonderful, natrual thing"" and they want to ""really experience it"": know what else is natrual? Cancer and explosive diahrrea. Natrual does not necessarily equal beautiful. Having a baby might be wonderful, sure, but the actual process of childbirth most certainly is <i>not</i>.

And for the love of <i>fuck</i>, will you people quit forcing your goddamn four-year-olds to watch you shitting out another rugrat? Watching Mom hollering in searing agony while a seven-pound human being rips its way out of her twat has <i>got</i> to be pretty psychologically damaging."

yesterday i had to get my bits prodded. i also had to pee in a cup, which i guess is standard procedure every time i go in. joy. anyway, this doc was not exactly kind with my girl bits (in fact, the issue of spotting was brought up because she nailed me too hard while doing the pap). her breast exam technique on my very tender boobies left something to be desired, as well.

also, i don't think there's any excuse for leaving the patient sit around for a total of 1 hour while you get ""sidetracked"". 

i'm hoping that when i'm trying to squeeze out a rugrat, she doesn't wander off for an hour and get sidetracked. grrr. 

remind me to move to a town where they don't have teaching hospitals....

anyway. everything seems fine. i'll be able to hear the baby's heartbeat next month, because she won't be stuck under my pelvic bone anymore. 

in other news, i'm not nearly as miserable anymore. seems that most of the morning sickness has gone away. my body still gets pissed when i don't feed it on time (this must be what it feels like to be jason)"

"event","well, we had the first ultrasound on Monday. why so early? because when you get knocked up while on the pill (and really, none of the doctors so far have been terribly suprised by that), it's hard to tell exactly when you ovulated, and therefore it's hard to predict a due date. 

anyway. Chris and i went to the appointment monday afternoon. they had me change into a gown and a robe. seeing as how it was my first time having this done, i didn't think anything of it at the time. looking back however, i should have realized something was amiss. 

ultrasounds are usually done with a nifty little paddle thing on the top of your stomach. however, the baby is too small before 12 weeks for that whole external business to work. so they have to do it internally. and where's the best place to stick a camera? yeah. there.

the camera was inside a stick/wand thing that was about 2.5 to 3 feet long. FEET LONG people. as in multiple. that needed to go IN THERE. 

turns out that 90% of the thing was handle. of course, the medical imaging tech didn't bother to explain what we were seeing on the little monitor. but i do have pictures (well, a printout of the film, which is why it isn't scanned yet) of the baby. it's about the size of a peanut, and has a 163 beat/minute heartbeat. 

it's hard to believe that something that small is going to grow into a full-blown baby in another 7.5 months or so. it's also hard to believe that something that small can make me feel so very crappy all the time."

then, calling to get a first prenatal appointment at UW Health.. fun, fun there. i'm on hold for like 10 minutes, only to get transferred to the business office. they hooked my old account (ziegler) up with my new last name (cykana) and C's account/insurance info.

And I'm actually starting to warm up to the idea. At first I was alarmed, disquieted, disturbed, aflutter, agitated, jittery, nervous, perturbed, uneasy, anxious, concerned, solicitous, and worried; but now I'm kinda looking forward to being a Dad. 'Cause lord knows I'm mature enough to handle it. Heh.

Really, the fact that I'll be responsible for the health, safety, and well-being of an otherwise helpless human is...well, it's obscene. But hey, it's the damn kid who decided to come about a year earlier than we were planing, so she'll just have to deal. It would have been nice to have been more settled and stable when this all hit, to have had a higher income and a nicer place to bring the kid home to, but we'll figure out a way to get though it.

And hopefully, we'll come out the other end with a daughter who doesn't have <i>too</i> many cracks in the ol' psyche.

Yeah, the ""daughter"" thing is a bit presumptuous, innit? Until we know for sure, though, that's what I'm going to default to, since alternating pronouns or using ""he/she"" is a pain, and referring to the kid as ""it"" is depersonalizing. Which is the last thing I need, since the whole situation is still kinda of abstract and surreal to me.

"event","<center>Too bad, <u>everything</u> you just wrote about me, <big>isn't true</big>.
& trying to ruin my rep. by saying shit about me on the internet..
Yea, <i>real</i> mature, Jeff.
I'm done sticking up for myself & proving you wrong & burning you back so hard you don't even know what hit you most of the time.
Write all you want about me.
Act like a middle scholar.
See if i fucking care what you think about me.

"event","<center><small>So today, was kinda ""blah""
& Raiders was kinda ""ehh"" (a little drama went down involving Mandie, which kinda angered me a little)
But the awards ceremony was <b>PIMP!</b> as hell! Got my Raider shirt, WHICH HAS MY LAST NAME ON THE BACK!! & i gotta drive around the school for a while afterwords (& then home :D), which always makes me ecstatic.


</center><big><u>Ooh & in regards to the comment <b><i>""Someone""</b></i> who left me on my MySpace, this is what i have to say to you</u></big>:
<small>So, dumb ass!
Well, all i basically have to tell you is that you NEVER listen to ANYTHING i EVER tell you.
1st of all-
I SAID I WAS OVER YOU, DUMB SHIT! After the way you walked all over me even after i waited around for you for <b>2 FUCKING MONTHS</b>, the LAST thing i want is to be w/<i>you</i> again. The names you called me.. yeah, you're definitely the biggest piece of shit i've EVER had sex w/.
2nd of all-
The only reason why i'm still trying to talk to you is because, unfortunately,  i'm not the type of person who can tell someone who was in their life for 8 months, to just ""Fuck off"". Sorry i'm not as <b>cold-hearted</b> as you are :D
3rd-
Stop being so fucking mean. It's not ""karma""; it's called being a cold-hearted, selfish, inconsiderate, jackass prick who lied to & used someone for 8 months STRAIGHT. Yeah, that's <b><u>you</b></u>.
& last thing-
<b>I only cheated on you w/David. Curt was over the summer, while we were BOTH on vacation, & if i remember right, YOU broke up w/ME right before we left, in the <i>cruelest</i> way possible.</b>

You meant the WORLD to me, Jeff. Sorry i did what you told me you always wanted from me; sorry i actually <b>cared</b>."

Anyways, Sparky is an annoying kid. I want to ring his neck and then stomp on him....GRRRRR.....he comments on everything...EVERYTHING....sometimes it is not a bad thing but it bugs me...very much!!!!

And then i hit my arm on the desk by accident and it started to bleed and he said again wipe it on someones sleeve...ugh ppl!!!!

I run to the band room put my clarinet away and run to the locker room and put my clothes away....then run around to all the teachers gving them their candy.....UGH!!! But that isn't even close to what happens next......

"event","MAMA WHETSTONE!!!!!! What in the world?????  Mr. Atwood is going down you here me....DOWN!!!! First he calls Mrs. Whetstone Mama Whetstone and now no passes.....you are going down!!!! You and your alligator shoes. YOU HERE ME...YOU & YOUR ALLIGATOR SHOES!! No Mr. Atwood is cool....even though he dosen't give out passes...i guess..lol! 

Anyways, about my day, first of all they had the little student of the month thingy on the tv this morning.  Mallory was really faking that smile! Don't you think? Then in Science Mr. Shotts asked if I had a boyfriend and I said ya in bedford......he laughed at me...... LAUGHED! Again I feel so much love.  But I spelled the elements right on my elements test  in his class so i am happy.  HOORAH!!! 

Oh by the way did any one see what shoes Mr. Atwood wore today cause i didn't......I hope he didn't by new shoes.  I think he needs therapy... Mental and Shoe Addiction Therapy...lol! 
Lunch was quite uneventful today...but the Mac & Cheese was actually good! They didn't use the home - made junk. 

Today in Gym was very interesting.  Josie talked me into playing volleyball with her.  As Shaina knows i am a very bad vollyball player. But I didn't feel that bad after we started playing cause I am playing with the Peanut Gallery!!!!!!!  I even know the concept of hitting the ball over the net...I thought everyone did but obvoiusly not.  I mean a 7th grader was actually laying on the ground so he wouldn't get hit with the ball.... ugh!!! Some would just stand there as the ball was coming down. 10......9....8....7.....6.....5.....4.....3......2.....1.......BANG!!! They would just get hit in the face.
Well g2g byez

"event","Ok well today was a very interesting day.  First of all we had a very intimate discussion over glow in the dark toliets at lunch today. Unfortunly (I can't spell), Peter could not draw a toliet so he decided on drawing a spoon/fork.  Mrs. Whetstone was in one of her moods again today.....as Shaina says, I swear she has a very high daily level of PMS!!! Then in afterschool band practice Emily flicked a sausage at me....don't i feel loved!

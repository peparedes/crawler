a lot of things just dont add up..they really dont...
he shows absolutly no security...i feel like im all alone...
he is never there for me as a husband should be...
now im not sayin that i am perfect but i would be a lot better off if he didnt lie ...and hide...and treat me like im shit under his shoe half the time...
i need a brake i cant beilieve that i had kids and got married...god what the hell was i thinkin??
i love them all with all my heart but it was stupid...
i want to run away all the time...im the only workin..as usuall...and i have to do all the house work...give the kids baths and feed them ...yard work...and work all day long...
i just cant do it no more...i would love a seperation trile...but not to split up..but just to get away or im gonna loose it worse then i all ready have...
if we do a seperation trile ...then i know he will seriously cheat on me..hell just say...well you left and i was alone..
see i dont understand why he keeps draggin me along..if he wants to flirt or talk with other girls and do what he does why keep me here ...in the worst pain of my life...why does he keep draggin me along???i just dont understand why he dont let me go...
i wish he would have never started shcool....i wish he would quit..but i dont...he is the smartest (book smart..that is) that i know..he shouldnt waiste it...
god i love him sooo much it hurts but we arent the same people...i wish that he would PROVE to me that i am the only one in his eyes...he just isnt romantic..he used to be...but he doesnt show me shit...he doestn give me one ounce of security...
i wish he would focus on me once in a while..not himself...i doubt hell read this....
if you do babey...i truelly love you with all my heart n sould but damn...i need some help here..i need a husband and a best friend..i truelly do...and i know you wont care if you loose me you get over it...but i will never ever ever get over you..i love you babey but as you know you are loosin me..but you know me i will never ever go any where...i will stay untill you get rid of me...
but please babey...you need to stop hiding just the littlest stupidest things...i dont care if you talk to people i care if you hide it...true you say ...well you have flipped out on everyone...well take a look at everyone...you didnt tell me of one of them...make sence?

i know mickey is hiding something from me...i can tell by the way he acts...i can tell just like i could tell like before....before i knew as well...
i wish he would give to this marriage...
i wish he would not lie and hide lil stupid things from me...
it really is makin me die...im tired and my heart hurts and i just basically dont want to go on with my life....
its just when i ask him things the way he answers and what he sais....and the way he acts all the time...
i dont know...i wish that he would give love and trust to this marriage...
i love him so much but untill he can start bein TOTALLY honest with me ...then this is just pointless....
i wish that he still had the love for me like when we first met...i wish i could have that man i fell in love with back...
but wishes never come true....
well ill see you all later..."

"event","well i hate the thoughts that i have running threw my head right now...
mickey said he had an interview today that lasted like seven hrs...makes me wonder if hes cheating on me...again....
i hate these thoughts they just kill me an they dont do me any good...
and i think that if i never found out bout ""her"" if they would be meeting or would have met by now...
just the things mickey has done to me and ruined me...i have put things in the past and im tryin to move on...but i need time to feel his comitment..i guess...
hes always been the good type of guy and i truelly love him...
its just hard to trust what hes doin...i do trust him...its just i have all these thougths...the hardest thing is that i and everyone else has bended over backwords just so he can go to school...and he is so inconsiderate bout everything...he feels that he doesnt have comfert and feel loved...he is never there for me...all he can think bout is how im not there for him and how no one is...
he needs to open up his eyes and see what i and everyone else has done for him....most of all he needs to treat me with love an respect and be there for me...
i dont know...i wish he was the man i fell inlove with...he isnt and niether am i...
but i NEVER NEVER NEVER...cheated or betrayed his trust and hurt him over and over ..then think bout myself...
ook....i love you mickey....you just need to learn to be there for your wife and your kids and open up your eyes and see what you have...you are loosing everything..but not apreaciating what you have....i love you and always will...but like ive told you for months and months...i need you help...emotionally...and physically...and with the house and bills...ect....i love you...and i miss you...i miss they way you used to not be soo cold and heartless..i miss you bein lovin and carin...and basically..i miss you be here for me..."

"event","well...ive tried everthing i can to fix this marriage...
i know and mickey knows what is brakin our marriage and he wont get rid of whats brakin us up...
it takes two people to fix a marriage and im the only one who has fixed what i can...
i love him soo much ...but when i tell him he needs to get rid of what is brakin up our marriage..he gets all pissy and dont care...
he has hurt me for months now...he doesnt care....
all that matters is that when he doin what ever hes doin he is happy...as long as hes happy then thats all that matters...
he thinks i want him to get rid of all of his friends and that has nothing to do with it..when i pictured havin a husband i pictured him bien there for my feelings and my needs but hes not...if he feels im not there for him then he shuts me out completely...
he knows im misserable and hurt...and he can do is think bout him self...
i love him soo much but how much can i give to one person...
ive givvin him chances after chances and all my trust and love he ruined those...
i just wish he would stop thinkin bout him self...
like for example...he was hidin talkin to some girl from me like a couple of days ago...i wnet to his school and i asked him if he was talkin to any one and he told me no he wasnt...
then i leave and he looks to see if im gone and hurry right away pops up her box...he told me he didnt even have aim...and he just was all hiding her from me..he told me to get out of his class room so he could get back to school then he pulls up her screen like hes bein dyin to talk to her since i was there...
he explained things to me and took in what he was tellin me...but the true fact is ..is that he was hiding it from me...
god i wish he would work on this marriage and be there for me and his kids...
i wish he would grow up sometimes....
im sorry babey i love you but this is how i feel and i know your gonna get all pissy at me now..but this is how i feel...
any way i must go now cause of my dirty house awaits for ME...hmmm...
i love you babey...but i need your help in this marriage as well...

oh by the by...last night was GREAT....and yes my rug burn HURTS..!!!!!!"

any way mickey was seein some one on the puter...it hurt me sooo fuckin bad..its like he took my heart and soul and just stepped all over it...what hurt the most was all the lien i have never been lied to so much before...i love mickey and always will...
i just cant believe he actually did that to me...
in a way it brought us closer but still he went beyond too farr...
i still think bout it...like what he was sain to her and what he was doin while he was talkin to her and thats what hurts..that and all the lieng...he took my love for him and my heart and just fuckin destoyed it...
i know it's over and i do trust him still..but still he betayed me worse then any of my ex boyfriends and i had some pretty bad one...
i told everyone what had happend and they say i am the stupidest person for stayin with him..they want to know why i dont leave him..i dont leave him cause if i lost mickey my whole world would end..i would die if i didnt have him..i wish he felt the same way in return...i felt like he was my soul mate and i had eternal trust and love for him...but i think it takes time to love some one that much and thats what im gonna give to him is time and be pationt with him...in time i truelly believe that he will feel the eternal love for me that i do for him...
i dont know ...people are just amazed that i stayed...but they dont know me and they dont know mickey...
if i heard this bout some one else i would be the same way too and i would say the same thing they tell me...
but this is mickey ...he is the most amazing person i have ever met..i m still very supprised on his actions you know...
but im not loosin him...
we both have things that we need to work on..
i wish he was here with me tonight since it is my birthday..
i am so depressed..im not a teenager now...from here on life just flys by and the next thing i know were old...
thats another thing bout mickey...i can picture him old..and i love what i see..lol..
but i dont want to be twenty..i really dont..i want to be young forever..i wish i could stop time..i work where 80 % of the customers are ancient..and it scares the crap out of me...

i wish he would work on our marriage ...cause i cant do it alone
i try and comunicate with him..since he sais its the most important thing...well he shuts me out everysingle time...so nothin gets solved....
he is soo cold he not the man i married...i admit i am not the same girl either and we never will be but still...hes soo cold and soo crewl...
i wish that love would be like i alway thought it was supposed to be....
both comited to eachother and there sould touch and all that mushy stuff...well now i know its all a fairytale....
i love him soo much and since all this crap has happend over the puter the girls he talks to put the shit in his head that i dont trust him and that i dont believe a thing he sais..if i didnt trust him then i would tell him....
i cant believe the way he treats me and how he hurts me over and over and he shows not a care in the world...
i dont know...we moved way too fast im only 19 and i have two babeys...now thats crazy....
i just wish that we could just get along...and i wish he would let me be his soul mate...i know that sounds wierd...
i left him and his first words to me when i called was""why arent you at work""...
hes just so cold and i ball my eyes out and all he can do is put my down even more...
ive been in some of the worst relationships...but the way he treats me is the worst of them accept for two guys...but thats another story
i wish we had the love we used to and if i try lately he just shuts me out...
i wish i had some one who could help me or at least just listen to what i have to say ...cause is not here for me...
i tried to talk to him...ive tried to get this workin and he shuts it all down..i tried to get him to go to counceling but he just refuses...
i have givin up im gonna be misserable for the rest of our time together cause he has no care in the world you know...
god i miss bein held and havin some one to hold at night...
i miss laughter most of all with him
he is the most amazing man the most funniest i have ever met
the most creative ..handsom...intresting...
but lately...non of those he cares to show to me...hell show them to other but not to me...

and i have no where to go if i did have the nerve just to get up and leave you know...
i always thought my life was soo hard and i needed this and that...but i was soo wrong...it just made things a million times harder..
true love is not what i expected...i expected love and worshipness from both souls...souls connecting....i was wrong....
my love is stronger then the starrs them selfes but its not enough.. expecially in return...
im more inlove then ever yet im more hurt and lonley then ever...
i just dont know what to do any more....

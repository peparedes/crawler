"event","Last night was the mark of the end of US engagement in the war in Iraq. I recently reread &nbsp;my previous entry from the night before we declared war on this nation and, as i watch our first black president's speech about disengaging troops, i contemplated whether or not it was worthwhile for me, a dumb blogger to comment on such heady state affairs. &nbsp;I felt like, since i once cared, i should care again. But then what with the crippling economy and state of things at home, why bother? Who am i to engage in such a conversation? My interest and adamant stance against the war faltered as the bushies took power and exerted their control. I had hoped, in some perverse way, that the war in Iraq would be a galvanizing issue for my generation, much the same way Vietnam had been for my parent's generation, (albeit not my parents themselves). Alas, we were too distracted by youtube, and shepherd ferry and shepherd smith to actually ever take a stand. So as much as i wanted to commemorate the end of the war, i felt it was an empty gesture (despite the feelings in my heart so many years later).&nbsp;<br /><br />Tonight i went out drinking with an old college chum. A pal i try to only hang out with every 4-6 months, due to our incomprehensive binge drinking. I adore the fellow, but i find myself getting into unnecessary trouble when i'm in his company. Alas, it's been about 4 months, and i could use some friends. So a night on the town it was. We hopped our way through a couple of bars, ending at the new beer garden in town. We waxed philosophical and smoked horrible cigarettes and had a gay old time. Then some nice young ladies joined our smoking section picnic table. We engaged in conversation for a good couple of hours - they were younger, sisters, and phenomenal. I was enamoured. (Also, S, if you're still interested i found a lezzie who identifies as a straight girl and is, basically, exactly your type. She kind of wants your number!) After much chit chat, the conversation turned political and i was suddenly informed that my longtime friend was a fan of G.W. Bush. A shock too horrid to the system to describe, I excused myself to the men's room. When I returned, the conversation was still raging and my friend, inebriated and realizing he was the odd man out, insisted that we adjourn. As we parted, I made sure he crossed the underpass safely and made his way home without running into an oncoming semi. As i was about half way home, it donned on me, &quot;shit, did we pay the check?&quot;<br /><br />A quick text later confirmed, that no, we had in fact dodged the billet. Torn, I turned to go back, but my drunken bladder full, i quickly discarded this plan for the toilet at home. After emptying my kidneys, I was fully aware of our faux pas. We ran up a large tab of 9 drinks and a plate of brat wurst.&nbsp;<br /><br />Being the moral type, i contemplated bed, but the thought sickened me. I had no other choice but to return to the scene of the crime. I played out the scenario in my head, hoping they wouldn't call the police to arrest me. To my surprise, the bartenders were shocked that i returned. When i apologized profusely, and explained that i understood that it would be coming out of the barkeep's wages, they almost fell to the floor with praise and all offered me a free round of drinks. I politely declined, embarrassed that doing the right thing should gain so much attention and promptly settled the tab, for myself and my drunken friend, plus a 40% tip. One of the ladies from earlier in the evening was now sitting at the bar, and so taken by my morals, insisted i give her my phone number. I had transcended from some drunk at her table to a real go to guy pal. &nbsp;The bartender, Mario, shook my hand, almost with tears in his eyes, and said anytime he sees me, he'll remember. I am visibly embarrassed and find my exit. I am also touched as i haven't been in a long time.<br /><p>I return home to my cat and the quiet and think about the war and the last decade and the way it's colored my life. I won't write an entry about it, but I'm glad G.W. is gone and now relegated to a boring, and unpopular topic of conversation. And I'm glad that I can still remember to be a moral man, and do the right thing, even if it's as dumb as paying my tab. Who knows what will come of all this, but it's nice to know things change.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","I realize looking over this journal that it has been some time since last I wrote. I also realize that the majority of my previous entries start in a similar manner. Suffice it to say, I have neither the energy nor wit at the moment (or ever?) to post a proper entry, but I was so moved by the fact that it seems like we're all crawling out of the woodwork and back onto livejournal, be it ever less frequent than before, I felt compelled to write something. I know a lot of us have been on hiatus from this thing, probably for some very good reasons. I mean, who needs to know THAT much about a 20 year old's life. Of course, now that I'm pushing 27, I don't know that I have anything more profound to elaborate on. I would even wager less so.  But my recent bout of bad luck/ good luck/ bobist intervention is making me serendipitously aware of how much I'm longing for a sense of community again. Livejournal was much like a church for me. It was a place to purge my thoughts and exorcise my demons; a consecrated space, where hopefully in the mixing of energies with all the other poor saps out there, some positive insight might be harnessed to shed a little light on my own silly existence. To give meaning to the meaningless. Unfortunately, also like church, I eventually moved on to another place in my life where I thought I didn't need the baggage weighing me down. I guess I always knew it was still out here though, waiting for me when I was ready to claim it. I think enough time has finally passed and enough distance placed between me and my former self that I can honestly say, I'm ready to find that sense of community that has been absent from my life for the last few years. If it takes hoping back on the computer, heck, I won't knock it. A lot of rambling I know, I apologize, but it's 8 a.m. and I have yet to go to bed, so to summarize:  S, you were right (and eloquent), as usual- this IS better than myspace or facebook."

"event","&nbsp;When i was a kid, my family visited these old ghost towns near the&nbsp;colorado copper mines. The mountains were all bright red and orange from the minerals oozing in the earth. My dad took pictures through one of the old mining building's aligned windows. He set his aperature speed just so and the resulting pictures were these bright orange, slightly ragged triangles floating within a perfect blue rectangle of sky. This in turn was all framed&nbsp;by the blackness&nbsp;of the little house's insides. I wonder where those pictures are."

"event","On my walk to work this morning I passed down a street where they were laying new asphalt. The first thing i noticed was how in the area of the block that is community garden you couldn't smell the tar, as opposed to the rest of the street. Plants really are such amazing air purifiers. 

The second thing i noticed was that instead of fixing a giant pothole, the workers were laying the new road over the contours of an existing chasm- basically skim coating it rather than filling it in. I guess it wasn't in their contract. God I love New York."

My mother had sinusitus so bad that she underwent surgery last year to correct the problem, and has been using a daily saline rinse at her doctor's&nbsp;urging ever since. The concept, based&nbsp;on ancient&nbsp;techniques,&nbsp;seemed logical enough, so after doing some research: <br /><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0lr8JKwIzQ"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0lr8JKwIzQ</a>&nbsp;<br /><br />I was sold. A trip to Eckerd and fifteen bucks later, I had my very own <em>neti pot.</em>&nbsp;<br /><br />And man oh man does the sucker work!<br /><br />&nbsp;I've already rinsed twice tonight and I can't begin to tell you how much snot and ooze I've expunged from my noggin. As long as you don't mind choking on your own sick a little bit, it's a healthy alternative to being pumped full of antibiotics, plus you can use it as much as you need it. I'm feeling a little duped by the hefty price tag (it is, after all, just&nbsp;a plastic pot and some little salt packets), but the way&nbsp;I&nbsp;feel right now compared to how I felt&nbsp;four hours ago, I&nbsp;have to say it was worth every penny.&nbsp;<br /><br />So for those sickies out there,&nbsp;this is a&nbsp;fantastic little product. It's also fantastic for all those <em>sickies</em> out there who think snot is funny. And let's face it, I know both types of people&nbsp;in this world,&nbsp;hence&nbsp;I'm passing it on.&nbsp;<br /><br /><img height=""4"" alt="""" width=""4"" src=""http://ec3.images-amazon.com/images/P/B0001ZSF6K.01-A4Q68YVE6O035._SS500_SCLZZZZZZZ_V1080767174_.jpg"" /><br /></p>"

"event","Waking up today was torture. I must have hit snooze 10 times. I tried to go to bed early last night (well, early-ish anyway), but ended up reading instead because i was finding it hard to fall asleep. On top of all this i have come down with a scratchy throat in the last two days which i am certain is going to mutate into a killer strain of bird flu. Decimating the human population would be just my luck. 

I thought i was finally starting to cope with the bizarro walk to work, when just this morning something i've never seen and will probably never see again, happened. As i was passing under a tree i heard a racket. I looked over and saw a squirrel running around on the sidewalk. Being my nature to harass squirrels, i stopped to, well harass it. When suddenly i heard a loud THUD! I turned around to see another squirrel falling out of the tree above my head. ""JESUS CHRIST!"" i screamed, as i dropped my bag, ducked, and covered my head. I regained my composure long enough to ascertain that, in fact, a squirrel <i>had</i> really just fallen out of the sky. Then i looked up and saw another squirrel in the tree THAT HAD PUSHED THE SECOND SQUIRREL OUT OF THE NEST. I don't know if they were playing or fighting or what, but man, what a nose dive. The fatty shook off its stunned look and ran back up the tree when the suddenly ""THUD!""
THe fucker knocked him out of the tree again. I think they were actually laughing at it. What freaks."

"event","Oh my dear lord. I just watched a documentary on PBS entitiled ""The Standard of Perfection: Show Cats."" Think ""Best in Show"" only with cats and real people. It was set in Houston and followed several breeders as they vied for top awards at the Cat Fanciers' Association International Cat Show. Yes, as in Cat Fancy Magazine. The breeders do freaky things like building special ""honeymoon suites"" in their homes, preparing gourmet meat dishes that involve mutiple steps, and perfect complex grooming rituals. The cats have names like Nicole Kidman, Candace Bergan Cat, and Wolf Blitzer. One middle aged white man held up a black cat and said, ""He's Colin Powell; had he been born a girl he would have been Condeleeza Rice."" Incredible. It's the same guy that did the chicken documentary a few years ago. I think it may be one of the most amazing things i've ever seen. Absolutely amazing.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><img height=""225"" alt="""" width=""300"" src=""http://www.daminet.pl/~praca/zdjecia-kotow/male/Cat%20Fancy.jpg"" />"

"event","I'm so grumpy and lonely and sad right now and i have no idea why. Perhaps its my unhappiness in work, perhaps its my unhappiness in life. Perhaps it's my lack of friends, or perhaps its my self-imposed exile. I have a sneaking feeling it has something to do with the fact that i haven't made anything  creative that i've been proud of in months. Or maybe i am resentful of how happily other people are able to manipulate technology in order to present their lives as happier than my own. I have never been one of the ""beautiful people."" This used to be distressing, until i realized the beautiful people only exist in magazines. I discovered  that in real life they tend to be boring, stupid, and/ or ugly. For what it's worth the people i know tend to be far more beautiful and interesting. Unfortunately the ones i want to surround myself with tend to not want to associate with me though, so i suppose i'm back at square one. Then again maybe rainy days just bring out my melodramatic tendencies. who can say. All i know is i need to break out of this slump. I'm looking for those people who are up for anything anytime. I used to know some of them. I need some excitement and adventure. Maybe i just need to meet someone new. I do know that i need to stop drinking alone. I also know that i've had at least one cigarette a day for the last 5 days. And at this rate, being that it is spring and i have a tendency to fall into seasonal patterns, i need to stop this habit or i will be smoking again. I really do love how i feel when my body isn't smoking. But then again, i love the taste of tobacco and coffee on a rainy day. I wish my house wasn't out of wine. (Especially since i have so much gin and whiskey and scotch.) You seem like a much less desperate sort of alcoholic when you're drinking a glass of red wine by yourself. White wine alone makes you an alcoholic housewife in the suburbs, while booze makes you more akin to some sort of miserable genius, not unlike bukowski. Of one thing i am certain, a genius i am not. I bought some wonderful smelling daffodils that are mixing nicely with the wet skunk smell wafting in through my open window. I like the sound of the dripping rain."

"event","I need some friends. I'm drinking alone right now. This is awful. How can i reconcile this? Hmm? The friends i have need to stop being students. I need to hurry up and move. I'm excited for June. (I think). I still need to find a job. Ugh. At the moment I'm wearing the most amazing tie. Its very wide, navy blue with a geometric tartan-ish slash across it with little white crests. As a matter of fact i am entirely color coordinated today- all navy and the like. I wore it to work today and have yet to take it off. I also wore my orange vintage Dior cardigan, for contrast. THe point of this? I AM TOO PRETTY TO BE SITTING AT HOME RIGHT NOW. stop. You know a couple of years ago, i would have rallied the troops at this moment. We would just be getting ready to go out. To dance and drink the night away. What on earth has happened? I need to drink and dance the night away. I need my narcissistic friends back. We just made one another feel soo goood. ugh. WHo can i call? I'll have another beer and figure it out. RIGHT NOW I HATE THAT I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO SMOKE- Mainly because there is a pack in my freezer from a gathering earlier this month and i know i'll be tempted to cheat. I want a martini. I cleaned my house this weekend- spring cleaning, the big stuff, you know. I found all these old rags i used to wear out to the clubs. When did i become a housewife? i asked. hence the tie this mourning. I even tried on my dinner tuxedo- tails and all. With black tie and my more appropriate old thick rimmed black frame glasses, i proceeded to snap a few digi's of myself. I miss dressing for dinner. I miss dressing at all. Why aren't there more debutantes in new england? Socially degenerate. My friend Ebee and i used to talk about Deb balls- always in past tense. She's a real whore, white gloves and all. I love that bitch. I miss her too. Mainly because she'd be up for a drink right now if she were still around. (Not to mention she would scold me for smoking- stains the fingers and teeth, she'd say.) Damnit! and now i want one more than ever. One more drink. A martini is what i really need- but this flat is all vermouth&nbsp; and olives, (i can never seem to hang pm&nbsp;to the gin). What would Zelda do right about now?&nbsp;"

"event","Dear lord today is dragging on forever. I didn't even come in until 11:30. My boss is gone which means i could leave right now, but i feel sort of guilty about it. So instead i'll just piss around on livejournal to make the other people in the office think i'm working for the next fifteen minutes. I can't seem to get rid of this bug i've caught, and i've spent the day being entirely unpleasant, hacking and wheezing and snotting loudly in my corner. People keep looking at me every time i do it, too. Which is funny because you think they'd be used to it by now. I guess i really am that repulsive. Ok. ten minutes left. I think i can probably start to pack up now. It is sooooo time to move far away from Rhode Island. 

PS. i'm obsessed with this folk song call ""Four Strong Winds."" I wanted the Carter Family Sisters version of it, but alas, i had to settle for the itunes alternatives. Bobby Bare was the only one to get the intonation right.
Here are the lyrics:

<i>Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All these things that won't change come what may
But our good times are all gone
And I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way

I might go out to Alberta
Weather's good there in the fall
Got some friends that I can go to working for
Still I wish you'd change your mind
If I asked you one more time
But we've been thru that a hundred times or more

Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All these things that won't change come what may
If I get there before the snow flies
Things are going good
You could join me if I send you down the fare
But if you wait until it's winter
It would do no good
For the wind sure blows cold way out there

Four strong winds that blow lonely

"event","San Francisco is amazing. That sums up all i have to say about it. Amazing food, amazing vintage stores, amazing friends- et. al. We spent an afternoon at the Sutro Baths which was i think my favorite part of the trip- my Harold and Maude moment. the ocean is stunning. The new deyoung museum is impressive- exquisitely detailed and beautiful to behold- spatially, it's a little messy, but as far as non-hierarchical design goes for museums it works really well. If you plan to visit any time soon, go to the observation tower <i>first</i>- it had closed by the time we were done looking around. Tim and I also popped into Nervi's St. Mary's Cathedral. I actually teared up at the beauty of its high modern detailing.  There was a great calder show up at sfmoma, as well as an awe inspiring surrealist photo/ sculpture show. And although I, like many critics before me, derided the Botta architecture, i warmed up to the building as the day went along. It has some really beautiful moments, not to mention the materials are all very high quality. Actually, i was pretty impressed with most of the buildings in the city- i think that the cross pollination of earthquake standards, stringent california building codes, and the shear amount of preserved historic structures in San Francisco has allowed the construction industry there to maintain a level of quality in their craft that modernism stripped away from most american cities. With that said, there is, of course, overpriced crap development everywhere,( not to mention architects often steer clear of its reputation as a city where things tend to get designed by committee). The Mission is one of the most interesting neighborhoods i've been to in the US. We went to a fun little straight/gay/ green-room-ish bar in the castro called The Transfer. We had been out walking around all night and had decided to go home when we heard <i>This must be the place</i> coming out of the bar as we waited for the bus. We knew, indeed, it must be the place and managed to get in right before last call. David Byrne never seems to fail me.  The musee mechanique was awesome. Well worth fighting the crowds at Fisherman's Wharf. Were else can you see a monkey jam band, a nudey nickelodeon, and a mechanical opium den all in one room. There are also neat fortune teller machines a la BIG. The other benefit of this area- IN and OUT BURGER- my new favorite fast food. The other touristy thing we did was go to Alcatraz. You laugh, but it's friggin' amazing. We booked tickets in advance online, which seeing the line for the ferry, was the smart thing to do. Because THE ROCK is now a national park you are free to explore it at your leisure. There are all sorts of ruined buildings and wildlife preserves. The cell block audio tour is included with the ferry ticket. Surprisingly, the quality of life in the prison was much better than i had expected. Part of the tour includes walking into a solitary confinement cell which is not in some dungeon, as i had imagined, but rather the lower level of one of the cell blocks. Walking in one of the units i was overcome with a really bad vibe though- just bad energy in that place. The view from the island however, can't be beat. After Alcatraz we went up to North Beach to City Lights Bookstore, paying our obligatory respects to the beat epicenter. I bought a book of poems called <i>Red is my Favorite Color</i> which has an entire section devoted to love poems about Katie Couric, (how could i go wrong?). Shopping in general was fun. I bought a miniature bust of Chairman Mao at this terrific store called The Apartment. I got some vintage shirts (including one austrian red cross shirt) at this other cool place in the Mission. We also managed to stop by the McSweeney's Pirate Store, (like the Comic Book Hero Store in New York). Very very funny. Tim bought a stuffed bird pillow thing. 
All in all it was great trip and it was great getting to see all of our friends. Now the question becomes, how can i find a place in Bernal Heights for under $500,000?"

"event","I rarely watch more than five minutes of any given reality show at once, and tonight when i accidentally tuned into Top Model, it was no exception. Tyra, like the bitchy high school head cheerleader drama queen she is, decided to <em>shake</em> things up by scaring the girls with Vivienne Westwood stiletto horror stories. ""Girl, her shoes are sooo notorious that even the <em>world's(!!!)</em> most famous supermodel of the day fell(!!!) yes fell(!!!) coming down the runway(!!!) You unknown nobodies don't stand a chance. NOW GO BACKSTAGE AND PUT ON YOUR HEELS!!!"" <br /><br />The lanky eating disorder clinic escapees then proceeded to tumble one by one down the teeny runway. When i tuned back in after some channel surfing they were doing the big reveal: <br /><br />Twiggy (to crying girl): WHen i saw you i said, I JUST KNOW THIS ONE's GONNA TAKE A DIVE! <br />Tyra (serious concerned face): WHy are you crying? Hmmm!? (Hip-tilt-sass). <br />Crying girl: Because i just wanted to do well and i'm a failure! A miserable awful failure! <br />Trya: Well let's see how you're pictures came out. <br />Panel (all together when the photos have been revealed): ABysmal- Horrid-lack of control-Where is the model? YOU NEED TO WORK YOU're THIGHS! <br />Twiggy (in the background): MEDIOCRE! WRETCHED! NEXT! <br /><br />Then they proceeded to coddle some girl on crutches who was next in line, probably fearing she would be sensible and sue the pants off the people responsible. All i could do was scream at the tv: <br />""MY GOD! THEY MADE YOU BREAK YOUR ANKLE FOR DRAMATIC EFFECT! THIS IS THE SICKEST FUCKING THING I'VE EVER SEEN! EEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!"" <br /><br />That Twiggy is a real bitch. <br /><br />In other news: <br />I almost ate a bad mussel this evening at dinner. The shell was steamed open so i figured it was fine. When i put it in mouth it tasted like a clam shack dumpster in a heat wave. I proceeded to stick out my tongue where it wiggled for a bit and then slid into my napkin. I buried it under a pile of discarded shells. Rotten seafood is still preferable to America's Next Top Model. <br /><br /><br /><img height=""236"" width=""300"" alt="""" src=""http://www.jossip.com/gossip/200511-tyrafatsuit.jpg"" />"

I got totally wasted last night and made a drunken asshole out of myself. Which happens. I had almost forgotten why i don't drink much anymore: because i'm a desperate miserable drunk. I just walked out on my friends in the middle of a conversation and meandered home at three in the morning. Then i spent the rest of the night screaming and whining and crying at Tim who should have taken my advice and just left me alone. I have realized that when my brain switch flips from manic to depressed i tend to take it out on others. Hmmm. Well, actually its more about trying to take them down with me. And when i crash, i crash. So in order to prevent the unpleasantness that is certain to follow, i.e. the regretful things i shouldn't say, i've found its best for me to just remove myself from social situations all together to pout and fume through it. It's completely irresponsible, true, but so far it seems to be the most effective mode of damage control i can muster. But then i'm weak of character, so what'd'ya expect? seriously. I've spent the better part of today nursing my hangover and making apology calls. Good lord, i should never drink again. 

So i really want to watch a movie today. I'm thinking about renting Times Square. But that involves money and walking in the rain. Hmm. I'll probably just end up watching harold and maude because its the only thing that can get me out of my funk. ever. period. 

p.s. i don't know if i've mentioned it before, but for future reference, it is my favorite movie of all time. Maybe i'll let you watch it with me sometime."

1. There was, in fact, quite a deliberate strategy in the posts/ topics. Through their accumulation i have actually managed to gain some insight/ personal growth/ space for reflection/ editing. 

2. The recurring themes (in no particular order) are as follows: 
   Boy trouble/ self worth?
   Dude, am i high/ drunk/ fucked up (respectively)
   Food for thought. Well not a lot of thinking as much as detailing meals/ recipes. 
   I've overdrawn my bank account again/ i was really irresponsible when it was my <i>parents</i> money.
   Pop culture/ Mind control- philosophical debates/exegesis with myself (and usually Cat).
   Angry tirades/ comical anecdotes.
   Any combination of the above.

3. I needed to take a year off lj.
   
4. Although seemingly boring and inconsequential at the time, i did a pretty good job capturing tiny moments i would have otherwise forgotten entirely.

5. I am a hater.

6. I am a ham (and only occasionally funny).

7. I can see some growth

8. I'm way more empowered than i realized. (but hey, that's hindsight.) 

9. I actually feel better, not <i>worse</i> about the past.

"event","It's been over a year since I've written in this thing. Many an entry in this journal has begun that way, what with my penchant for hyperbole, but this time it has been, in truth, honest-to-god, more than a year since i've written in this thing. It's not that I haven't wanted to write, the thought of catching up just seemed overwhelming. Fortunately, because it has been so long, the exercise of ""catching up"", as it were, seems somewhat futile bordering on absurd. It is very liberating. <br /><br />Tabula rasa aside, I will attempt to fill in the gaps of the last year. As a friend said the other day, ""if you don't use it, you lose it"" -- hmm. just like a penis. So here I go: <br /><br />I graduated last June. Almost a year ago now. Frightening. Five years of college climaxed with a semester of never-ending work. My degree project ended up being autobiographical. I came up with an urban development strategy for my home town at the scale of individual buildings. I carefully programmed and placed them throughout the town to create a dialogue with one another about small town life in the new millenium. Perhaps I'll elaborate more on this later. For now, suffice it say, I had a decent final review, i felt okay about the work, and i successfully met the requirements for graduation. I have also realized, (with time to reflect), this project is still in its infancy, and i plan to continue working on it. I was planning on writing more in this journal during that period, but while actually living through it, i decided it was better to spend my time engaging with my classmates, most of whom are now gone. In retrospect, i am glad for this opportunity. I bonded with more architecture students in the last three months than maybe during my entire time at school. Don't get me wrong, the department was (and is) still full of assholes, it just turned out not <em>everyone</em> was as asshole. I was surprised too. <br /><br />Immediately after graduation I began work on RISD's solar decathlon house. This project comsumed my life until the end of october. I can't even begin to describe the experience i ganined. Although ""on paper"", we didn't place well among the other competitors (16 out of 18), it was more because the competition isn't fairly structured, as opposed to our entry's merit. Our house's strategy was about using less to be more efficient. Our solar house contest was greeted with a week of rain. None of the teams houses were running at capacity and all teams had to strategize which contests to focus on and which contests to opt out of. We chose to run our house, other teams chose to dump power into their electric cars. We had 16 batteries, other schools had as many as 48. It's like putting a ballet dancer in the ring with a heavyweight champ. In the end, those teams were rewarded with more points because the scoring neglected to take a week of rain into consideration. Honestly though, only our team leader was disappointed. The other teams had million dollar budgets and multiple team members- not to mention full support and backing from their schools. We had a shoe string budget, little support from RISD along the way, and on the final weekend, 5 teammates left to do crowd control for thirty thousand people. We were woefully unprepared for transporting the modules to washington. The freak thunderstorms that plagued us for three weeks were biblical in their magnitude. Our hostel was hostile, with botched reservations and bedbugs, (although being in close proximity to scantily clad taut, toned, tan europeans allowed me to come to terms with these atrocities). In an attempt to cut overspending, the development office eliminated the portion of our budget reserved for meals. Being that we had all exceeded our meagre summer stipends a month earlier and were in fact, working for free, the lack of food money had left my teammates mostly penniless. Delayed transportation had not only left us behind on our construction schedule, but also resulted in damage to crucial components of our design. Despite our abject poverty, starvation, and utter physical exhaustion from working 26 hour days, we managed to pull it together. And on time too. I cannot stress enough how impressed i was with my teammates devotion, work ethic, and overarching ingenuity. I'm also more than a little mesmerized that no one was murdered. Needless to say, it was intense. <br /><br />In the end, our design was well received, even though we didn't place very high. Our innovative strategies to create a ZERO fossil fuel building were highly commended. I returned to Washington a month after the competition when the team was invited to testify before the US House of Representatives Committee on Science. Only three other schools were invited. Represenatives from the department of energy were very interested in our work with phase change materials. We gave a private house tour to various big shots, including the Under Secretary of Energy. We got some decent press, including a spot on ""THIS OLD HOUSE"" starring your's truly, which aired last weekend. There was a documentary on the DIY network, which i still haven't seen, as well as an interview with NPR. USA Today was working on an internet segment about technology, and the New York Times Channel stopped by (although i don't know if anything ever came of that). Recently, our team leader was invited by the DOE to advise on a green health clinic pavillion/ school being presented to China as gift from the US for the Beijing Olympics. I think i'm going to Boston next week to a NESEA (New England Solar Energy Association) Conference risd solar has been invited to participate in, and this summer we have been invited to attend a national conference in Boulder. Unfortunately, we still haven't found a permanant home for the house yet. RISD can't afford to keep it on campus (because they're broke) and at the moment it is in an old airplane hanger. Hopefully we're working out a deal for it to become part of the Save the Bay organization's campus where it will still be accessible by the public. Laurels aside, possibly the best part of the event was just meeting and speaking with the people who came through on the tours. Everyday people are interested in alternative energy, most of them just don't know their options. <br /><br />The House:&nbsp;<br /><img height=""400"" width=""533"" alt="""" src=""http://www.eere.energy.gov/solar_decathlon/images/photo_daily_journal_1007-042-lg.jpg"" /><br /><br />During Construction:<br /><img height=""300"" width=""399"" alt="""" src=""http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y244/kinematix/solar9_13_05.jpg"" /><br /><br />During (Re)Construction in DC:<br /><img height=""300"" width=""399"" alt="""" src=""http://www.eere.energy.gov/solar_decathlon/images/photo_daily_1002-396.jpg"" /><br /><br />The Roof Garden (excuse the poor resolution):<br /><img height=""200"" width=""300"" alt="""" src=""http://www.eere.energy.gov/solar_decathlon/images/photo_gallery_risd-4071.jpg"" />&nbsp;<img height=""200"" width=""150"" alt="""" src=""http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y244/kinematix/DSCN0580.jpg"" />&nbsp;<img height=""200"" width=""299"" alt="""" src=""http://www.eere.energy.gov/solar_decathlon/images/photo_daily_thumb_1012-risd_dinner.jpg"" /><br /><br />Some Interior Shots:<br /><img height=""250"" width=""333"" alt="""" src=""http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y244/kinematix/DSCN0583.jpg"" />&nbsp;<img height=""250"" width=""167"" alt="""" src=""http://www.eere.energy.gov/solar_decathlon/images/photo_gallery_risd-4077.jpg"" />&nbsp;<img height=""250"" width=""167"" alt="""" src=""http://www.eere.energy.gov/solar_decathlon/images/photo_gallery_risd-4058.jpg"" /><br /><br />The crowds:<br /><img height=""155"" width=""233"" alt="""" src=""http://www.archlighting.com/architecturallighting/photos/2005/12/Overview.jpg"" />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />As for me, I've been working since the decathlon ended for a former professor here in providence. At the moment i'm doing full time free-lance. It pays well and i make my own hours. The work is somewhat dry, (I'm a cad monkey) but I am learning a lot. Right now i'm trying to figure out how i'm going to pay my taxes (the downfall of freelance, my wages aren't docked so i think i have more money than i really do). The office i work in is also somewhat dry and bougie, but the people are friendly and genuine. I refuse to buy a car, so i am stuck walking in the ice and snow. Right now i am nursing a bruised shoulder from the fall i took this morning on my way to work. You should have been there -- it was hilarious. At the moment i divide my time between worrying about international politics and fighting to the death in ebay bidding wars for mid century modern furniture. I am currently awaiting a seller response on two eames dcm's i just won, and to be honest, i'm a little nervous. Needless to say, i'm turing into everything i despise. Tim and I are still together, and although we've had our ups and downs, we are, for the most part, happy and in a good place right now. I am planning on relocating as soon as i have the money saved up to do so. I'm pretty deadset on New York, at least for a while, and i think (fingers crossed) i have an offer waiting for a little while. I need to act pretty soon though. I have recently been commisioned by a friend of my parents to throw together a proposal to design a luxury retreat near my hometown- a four storey victorian hunting lodge with a conference center, lounge, restaurant/bar and guest rooms. Although i'm not terribly qualified i'm taking a stab at a proposal anyway. We'll see how this goes. providence is still providence although things have changed. I'm hoping to get my act together pretty soon and redo my portfolio, etc. I am also addicted to renting dvds of that horrible show Queer as Folk. <br /><br />There. Now you're as caught up as i am. (well that is if any of my friends still read this). The next post will be less work. I promise. I'll do something short and witty about kittens or something."

"event","I had a dream about a rotting corpse again. Not that this is terribly unusual for me, seeing as how i was that kid in elementary school who was late for class because my dad was hauling a gurney full of old lady out of an ambulance into the cooler as i sat watching out of the car, alone, and terrified i would miss
lunch count or god forbid, that someone in my class should find out my father sells death. Being raised the son of an undertaker, i was accustomed to having my morning disrupted by the flashing red announcement that Mrs. Jones-or-whoever, had arrived; a stiff lump of her former self draped in a crisp hospital linen or better yet, swaddled in a fuzzy mound of the blue velvet ""slip cover"" bearing the gold embroidered insignia of the funeral home. Imagine ""tea cozy"", only bigger, and with the occasional blood-drained-white-hand-of-death falling out every now and again. A black body bag was a sure sign of something gruesome within- either a sloppy stew of post mortem delivered from the state coroner's office (awaiting reconstruction and a liberal coat of makeup)  or worse: Body bags signal something tragic, most certainly something violent, and more than likely some'thing' accompanied by a police escort. More often than not however, my morbid curiosity was usually focused toward someone old, someone sick; someone who may not necessarily have been ready, but whose demise was not unexpected.

Now it is here, twenty two years later, that i finally begin to question the fucked-up-ed-ness of my  situation. What kind of a sick fuck is my father who can't tell the ambulance driver to wait five minutes while he drives around the corner to drop his kid off at school instead of always putting work first to the point that traumatizing children becomes synonymous with good parenting. ""Builds character,"" they said. ""There's nothing to be afraid of,"" they said. ""Oh, stop crying and go back to sleep. I don't care if all you see are rotting corpses attacking you when you close your eyes."" Well, actually, i never told them about my nightmares. What for? I knew they wouldn't do anything about it. But come to think of it, my obsessive nervousness-- the snapping fingers under scalding water while convulsing and chanting to attain psychological cleanliness after touching 'a bad thing,' the tattered lacoste polo collars chewed and gnawed to stringy fringe above the shard of top button i had bitten in half, the tying of the drapes ritualistically in a ball before going to bed so that they might not ignite from the baseboard heater that was well below them (not to mention turned off because it was summer), etc.-- is sort of beginning to make a little more sense. 

I am trying to come to terms with this stuff. Instead i am haunted in dreams by my childhood- my old house, my father, coffins with rotting zombies tumbling to the ground clumsily- i think the darkness comes not from repressing so much as remembering a little too well. I'm battling my past, but also i'm trying to figure out a future. i also know there are limitations to what i can resolve. Goddamn it."

"event","Before waking up abruptly this morning, i dreamt that global warming pulled a sneak attack, melting the polar ice caps which led to the entire eastern seaboard being engulfed by a giant tidal wave. I watched (maybe, god only knows why, i was in New Jersey for some reason?) as New York City crumbled under the splashing water. The whole thing had a sort of Godzilla-esque cheap model theatrical quality to it, and i remember being both startled and amused with the smash-tastic destruction and gore of it all. With most everyone on the east coast being dead, I, logically, became the most interesting person in the world. Index magazine did a feature on me and I was mentioned <b>3!!!</b> other times throughout that issue!!! I was just getting ready to accept some award for being fabulous or something like that when my body convulsed and i was thrown awake into <i>this</i> (gesturing), where everyone is still alive and well. LA-DEE-DA. 

Anyway, I think this came from my new conspiracy theories about how the Bush administration is actually trying to propagate global warming to further their sadistic corporate causes. I mean seriously, if the east and west coasts go crashing into their respective oceans, suddenly America becomes one giant red state. Well, except for Illinois, but that's really only Chicago, and Lake Michigan will wipe out Chicago. Then, with excess moisture in the air and the rapid evaporative cooling effect caused by the melting ice, weather patterns will go haywire and they will dump a fucking foot of snow two FUCKING WEEKS BEFORE THANKSGIVING,  thus extending the commercialized holiday shopping season, and <i>thus</i> fattening the coffers of the greedy republican swine on the boards of oil front corporations like ""Baby GAP"" and ""Restoration Hardware.""  Far fetched, you say? Well when you're all dead and buried under a thousand feet of Atlantic ice water and I'm gracing the glossy cover of Index magazine, we'll see who's ""crazy."""

"event","Ohio is still on the table. Kerry still has a chance, but it didn't have to come to this.

Because i just accidentally deleted the long political rant that exhausted me, i will paraphrase.

I'm fucking mad. And I'm mad at you America. Especially all you isolated narrow minded uneducated rural bible thumping abortion protesting queer bashing neo-nazi right wing crackers who in your infinite naivete seem to be more concerned with creating constitutional amendments to prevent <b>fagots</b> like me from ""redefining the <i>institution</i> of marriage"" than accepting that <b>your</b> leader has lied, cheated, and made a mockery of a government which i actually hold very dear. Democracy is a privilege and deserves educated voters. 

Why am I so mad? 

Because i'm one of you fucking crackers. I grew up in the same poor town, disadvantaged school system, and geographically isolated context as the rest of you. I watched my friends get knocked up and passed over just like you. I've watched the demonization of our culture. I faced the prejudice, economic and geographical discrimination we all encounter on a daily basis. And you know what, i realized it fucking sucks. But more than that, i realized that it will always fucking suck as long we don't put in the effort to better ourselves and our communities through education and exposure. Its not an easy fight, but it is one which is possible if we allow our tiny worldview to broaden. I am constantly amazed at how narrow and naive rural america's understanding of the larger context really is when it doesn't have to be so. No, it can no longer be so. We should be striving to understand just how connected we are to the world around us. More than that, its possible if only we get off our lazy stubborn asses. This talk of ""moral issues"" informing Bush voters is so disturbing because i know how narrow these moral viewpoints are. Its the same narrowness that makes my father think its acceptable to believe all black people are gang members or the Baptist minister who didn't graduate 8th grade convince an entire congregation that darwin was in league with the devil. It is this assuredness of misinformed opinions developed out of limited exposure that allows for the justification of viewing issues in either black or white. There is no room for nuance in the reactionary mind, no understanding that the world is in fact very gray. This all bothers me because tyranny is what actually hides behind the mask of this so-called moralism. It's these people who are losing their jobs, their natural resources, and their children in a modern crusade, because they think they are taking a moral stance for something different. These are good people who think they are doing the right thing. They are my family, friends and neighbors, and frankly, being a product of this naivete, i am prone to being overprotective and pissy when some pampered egotistical play cowboy comes along saying he's just like them, when in reality his ambitions reinforce the cultural machinery that undermines, demonizes, and demeans.

Come on Ohio, prove that we're better than this.

p.s. May that slimy little weasel exploitation-ist extraordinare Karl Rove be infected with a pox of biblical proportions."

"event","So my mother called me tonight after the debates to tell me our neighbor died. I am saddened by the death of someone i knew somewhat intimately, and likewise not shocked by the news. She was not a particularly healthy woman. Or a particularly kind or happy woman in what you would consider a ""conventional way"" for that matter, either. I always thought of her as an angry woman with Jackie O. Glasses who drank wine from a box and smoked misty's while standing in the shallow end of the pool. 

Rhode Island transplants, the neighbors purchased the house across the street from my parents when their son took a wrong turn on the bike trail that runs below our neighborhood. The house had sat vacant for a year. (The neighbor moved after he drunkenly called my father one night to loudly complain about the construction of my parents house, charging that my father's plans for the garage would block his view of <i>our</i> woods. The next day my father had the excavators triple the size of the foundation and drew up plans for a second floor. They moved before we could put in a giant gate at the end of the drive and we now have a 5000 square foot garage.)The new neighbors, Cindy and Den, decided to head south of new england after he retired from teaching industrial arts at a high school in scituate. It was at their suggestion i investigated risd, and why i am sitting here today. Cindy Driscoll, or Mrs. D. as we called her, was a very angry woman. She felt justified in dispensing her opinion at any given moment, and was outraged if you said anything in return. She would call and force me to come over, where i would sit uncomfortably in her living room where she would grill me, loudly complaining about all the things that i was doing wrong, and all the terrible things youth is capable of, not to mention how ungrateful and nasty my generation is. She would get progressively drunker and louder. I would attempt escape, and eventually she would either let me go home or my youth would piss her off and she would kick me out. 

Since moving to West Virginia, Mrs. D had succeeded in alienating everyone she came in contact with. Whether accusing my mother of spreading rumors she drank scotch or insisting the neighbors put down their guard dog because it ate her poodle (true story. It was Hi-laar-ious), she was not what you would call ""a people person."" Most importantly in her estranged list, was the precious daughter Kirsten, who had stopped talking to her mother some years earlier and whose life her mother secretly obsessed over via the internet, newspaper clippings, and secondhand information from one of her sons. Kirsten's pictures lined walls and photo albums. And i believe she was quite devastated by her daughter's rejection. Unfortunately, she took it out in the form of anger on the form of anyone who was willing to listen, which was usually the form of me. It was the young who suffered the most, actually being transformed <i>into</i> her daughter by the end of one of her inevitable angry tirades. Sitting through it, i too hated Kirsten, but for entirely different reasons. How dare she escape and leave me, a complete stranger, to deal with this woman. I fantasized that, someday by god, that little bitch would come home and get hers so that i could finally watch trading spaces undisturbed. Mrs. D. told me about how she paid for kirsten to get a make over at a salon before prom once. When the rhode island stylist gave her teased hair and blue eyeshadow, her reply was,""You look like a slut."" With the loving grin only a doting mother is capapble of, she concluded the story with: ""And so i washed her face and fixed her hair and made her look presentable."" Who could blame the girl for running away with a mother like that. Her idea of constructive criticism was to use the word slut in reference to her daughter. The woman had the mouth of a sailor. In a recent conversation, my mother was convinced she had mental problems beyond those of other people. I spent a fair amount of time explaining, no, in fact, this is how people from little rhody are. fuckin' CRA-HEE-ZEES.

Long story short, she died in the hospital the other day. Its sad. I feel bad for the husband really. He blames himself for not getting her help to resolve her issues. He's very burly and cuddly and as town building inspector i used to mentor with him in high school. Mom suggested i send a card, which i will.

In other news, and in reference to the heading of this entry, i was informed of another equally tragic death. My sister's rabbit Silky, aka Madame Poops-a-Lot has gone on to meet her maker. For those of you not familiar with Silky, this is the rabbit that got my sister banned from all Walmart stores for life. Let me explain:

Ahem, in her excitement over a little leopard print collar that matched some hot pants she once owned, my sister accidentally put some cosmetics into this little bag she was holding so that she might examine the pet accessories aisle more closely. Long story short, she forgot them, the checkout gal didn't open the bag, and some Walmart security guard by night/ pig farmer in podunk by day had it in for her. 
After being escorted from the premises and issued a series of harrassing letters from Walmart, my parents lawyer made a successful case to the court, which acquitted her of all charges, forced walmart to pay court fees, and led to an honest guy getting demoted from his night watchman post. My sister was outraged, my parents- mortifed. My father was ashamed and my mother had night sweats about how to keep the story out of the newspaper. She surpressed the society page, but there still managed to be a small blip under the magistrate court section. (i clipped it out and gave it to my sister, who didn't think it was a very funny joke.) Anyway, an actual line from her defense testimony in regard to the <i>bunny collar</i> was ""Your Honor, you don't understand, <i>this raabbit is my life</i>."" Sadly, that statement was true at the time. She bought the rabbit on a job hunting trip at my uncle's in North Carolina in order to fill the void left by college graduation and the departure of the love of her life, a Scottish soccer player named D.B. 

Eventually, the rabbit's very existence consumed her. She ordered an enormous cage on wheels that took up half of her bedroom. The creature had free range of the room, immediately shitting and pissing all over the white carpet my mother had so fastidiously chosen. (After three attempts to have it professionally cleaned, my mom has decided to rip up the floor in that bedroom altogether and make part of the family room double height). And just as my golden retriever ate most of the basement bathroom's marble sink, cabinets, and oak baseboard, dear, dear Silky nibbled on the upstairs bath's wood work and tore a neat and tidy hole in the linoleum floor of the laundry room. She preferred alternating her time between hiding behind the toilet, unbeknownst to me, planning a pre-emptive strike at the oportune piss spraying moment, and hiding under my sister's bed, watching lifetime (usually the golden girls or designing women)on the television that my sister had left on for her. Secretly, i would sneak into my sister's room when no one was looking, get down on my hands and knees and make soft cooing noises and penetratingly creepy eye contact. Silky, in return, would respond by stopping whatever it was she was doing and tense up into a quivering furry black ball of terror and jon-hating-ness. Needless to say, i feel a great sense of loss. Here is an excerpt from the e-mail i sent my sister:

<i>""Mom also told me about Silky. I am sorry. For as mean as i was to Madame Poops-a-lot, she was an ok kind of person, for a rabbit i guess.  Did you eat her, or make her into a pair of gloves? Because Christmas is coming up and i would love a new pair of gloves. What? It's a totally appropriate question. I mean, look at what Will Rogers did to Trigger. Ok, this is tasteless. (Not as tasteless as it would have been without editing first, mind you.) What? WHAT?! Oh lighten up for god's sake.""</i>

The extra tasteless part involved a coat that smelled of box chablis, but i found this unneccessarily cruel, and funny only in that-- ""this is so tasteless and shocking my only reaction is to laugh"" --sort of way.

Damn, its 4:00 in the morning and i have to write a philosophy paper for tomorrow."

Boy 1: ""Well, i like america, and that pisses me off when people don't like it. People who don't like America are terrorists.""

Boy 2: ""Its true.""

Girl: ""Well, all i know is that people from Australia are the nicest people in the world.""

Boy 1: (not catching on that Australia, is in fact a continent in the southern hemisphere, not a city in Europe says:) ""ok, ok, i guess there are some nice people in Europe, but how do you know? Have you ever been to Australia?""

            II.
  
 I called my parents tonight. This conversation occurred during a discussion of my mother's recent antique acquisitions while attending some estate auction or another:

Mom: ""So, now i finally have a bread bowl!"" (a handcarved shallow wooden trough-like dish used in olden days for kneading and letting rise bread dough; a highly prized collectable among bougie Americana collecting people like my mother.) ""Its late 1700s, early 1800s, i believe, and American -- not European.""

Me: ""what's the difference?""

Mom:""Well, its made of an American hardwood. Besides that, the European ones are ugly. I'll tell you what, Iowa is the place to get cheap antiques. Those people are chumps. This has already tripled in value just by bringing it back east. Oh, speaking of investments, your father just made one recently.""

Me: ""Yeah, what'd he do?""

Mom: ""Well, he's purchased a gun.""

Me: ""What? why on earth did he purchase another gun?"" (my father, who only hunts via a Ted Nugent endorsed computer game, owns rifles if for no other reason than to take advantage of his constitutional right to bear arms.)

Mom: ""Oh no, this is a very special gun. There are only eleven being made in the world and we'll own number eight.  I'm no fan of guns, but even i have to admit that it's a very pretty one.""

Dad (in the background): ""Its 32k gold and jewelry quality silver inlay scrollwork.""

Mom: """"Its 32k gold and jewelry quality silver inlay scrollwork. A very lovely gun.""

Me: ""But he doesn't hunt, why on earth does he want such a thing? You'll lock the thing up at least i hope.""

Mom: ""Oh no, we're going to hang it over the mantle in the family room i think, or maybe in your father's study.""

Me: ""You're crazy. How much did he pay for it?""

Mom: ""It was only three thousand, and it can only appreciate in value. We can already get five thousand for it.""

Me: ""THREE THOUSAND? DOLLARS? YOU SPENT THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS ON A RIFLE AND YOU WON'T LET ME GO TO TOKYO FOR CHRISTMAS?""

Mom: ""Well, its an investment, an heirloom, to be passed down to one of you kids someday.""

Me:""Well, i want it.""


Some people's parents invest in art. Mine invest in artillery. 


So, when W. gets elected again in November, remember to say thanks to those kids browsing softcore at the mall and my parents and their 32k .22."

I spent today walking in the bright weather around the city of providence. I took a friend to the  places i used to go when i was freshman, old abandoned buildings i'd break into, specifically. These places i knew as secret crumbling temples willingly submitting themselves to the climbing vines, vacant for generations before i discovered them, are now being gutted; blown open and exposed for viewing behind the safe distance of neatly erected chain link fence from the streets below. The filthy margins of my young adulthood are now being renovated into posh hotels, up market offices, and trendy urbanite lofts. I sat by the train station with my friend staring across at the east side where i live, fumbling for the metaphor that lives in all this,  and suddenly found myself remarking about just how old i am. A lot happened between 18 and 22. I'm not exactly sure how, or where, or what even. But it happened somewhere in between there."

1. I am at work so i have to be brief but i couldn't let the day continue without penning some stuff 

2. I'm at work! On time for the second day in a row. Go me.

3. I hate the layout of this studio- everyone keeps walking by, forcing me to minimize.

4. I was on time for work yesterday morning because i went bar-hopping on monday night. To think, all i have to do to be early is go to three bars before nine o'clock so that i am capable of passing out by ten. 

5. Seeing as how well the bar-hopping worked for my waking up problem, i had three beers by myself before i went to bed last night. I was really excited about how clever i thought myself for discovering this brilliant new system for sleep management. Then i realized i've been drinking every night for two weeks. At this rate, i will be an alcoholic by mid-july/ in AA by september. 

6. Fortunately, drinking to induce narcolepsy is not my only option for regularizing my zzz's; i have taken to sleeping backward in bed- head at the foot of the bed, etc. Reversing positions has always seemed to help me. Perhaps it has something to do with my childhood, i don't know. Maybe it's because i like to sleep in reverse when i'm taking naps: therefore the pressure to get a full night's sleep is off, and psychologically i approach it as i would a nap- feeling rested when i wake in the morning. 

7. And the reason i felt compelled to update in the first place: 
I had a sort of murder mystery dream while napping yesterday that involved my parents and close friends being portrayed as utterly untrustworthy psychotic killers. My only guide throughout the dream was a pet monkey. Now this is where it gets good- the monkey could talk. Can you believe that shit. i mean a talking monkey, get out of here. Seriously. Get out of town, that's what i have to say. A talking monkey, ha. Ok, so this wasn't actually that quick, or interesting for that matter, but i find talking dream monkeys amusing, so there. I just wish i didn't wake up before he told who the murderer was."

The guy who cooked for us is cute and my friend has been pushing a setup. Regardless, he's damn fun and so are his friends. Not to mention a.)he's got incredible style and b.)is a really good cook. 

Other attractive people joined us for our little picnic in his yard. One, a hilarious landscape student or ""scraper"" as we like to call them. Quite charming woman. Another of those people was the gorgeous secretary from the architecture office who works with host man. And guess what? Not only did she remember my name, we sat engrossed in conversation because she is actually a fabulous fag hag who hates and loves all the architecture professors i hate and love. Glowing lady. So now the whole big group of us are making plans to have dinner together regularly throughout the summer. I've been saying clam bake for a while now, so those of you interested in a beach trip should speak up so we can get to planning a summer shin-dig.  All in all, it was a really fun evening of funny articulate people. 

The evening just ended with a small group of those dinner guests venturing to my house where i provided stylish haircuts at discount prices. Well for free, actually. It took us about an hour, but we finally convinced the brooding sarcastic Bosnian to allow me to give him a faux-hawk. I was more nervous than he was i think, but somehow he trusted me and i turned him into a fucking superstar. The rest of us sat around the room gasping at how dramatically punk stylish the man became. The sarcasm took on a whole new level of sexy hotness! And the bitch loved it. I also realized i'm fucking fantastic at cutting hair. 

All of this only a night after a fine lady took me out to dinner, meandered on an evening drive and bought me ice cream. This summer is looking up. I've decided that 2004 is the summer of fun Fun FUN! Anyone interested in fun apply within."

"event","I got out of work early today, after i got there three hours late. I came home and took a nap at four in the afternoon only to wake up in time for late night television. I also found myself confronted with a countertop covered in mouse shit. THE FUCKER WON'T DIE. AND i keep finding mouse shit everywhere- in the linen cupboard, behind the refrigerator, under the bathroom sink. There is a giant tasty box of poison the exterminator left sitting under the heater by the garbage can. And does the little poop monster eat it? Of course not. Being that i haven't actually had food in this house for three months, mighty mouse keeps ripping neat little holes in the garbage bags instead. I hear plastic rustle every time i leave the room, often catching a little gray head poking through the milk crates that contain the recycling. I need a trash can with a lid. I also can't leave dishes in my sink overnight as the little bugger now seems to be feasting on crumbs. I spent an hour doing the dishes and scrubbing the counters down with disinfectant. I've tried the humane route, but this creature is far too clever. Being a threat to the pursuit of happiness, the rodent must be destroyed. The creature has frightened me into pissing on the floor/ wall/ myself one too many times."

"event","We'll i can officially add ""They let him out early for good behavior"" to the list of things i never imagined my mother would say, particularly in reference to the father of her grandchild. I finally called my parents back after three weeks of working hell. My mom informed that my sister's white trash live-in ""baby's daddy"" who was in the county jail for ""DUI without a license"" was released the other day. A charmer he is. 

During his stint in the big house, my mother tried to convince my sister to run away with the baby: ""I told her to move somewhere far away. I even offered to drive her myself, your father and i would help her get settled - a fresh start, you know."" 

Unfortunately, my sister politely declined. 

The really funny part of the story is that now he's on house arrest- he has to wear one of those electronic tracking devices around his ankle and everything! 
My sister apparently called my mother in a frenzy because he was coming home a week early and she didn't have enough notice to clean the hovel before the sheriff's department arrived to install the wireless perimeter alarm. ""My house is a mess, how dare they let him out so early. What on earth will they think of this place!"" 

umm, that it appears to be suitable living conditions for a convicted criminal on house arrest, perhaps?

In other related tales, our favorite Misty-smoking-raspy-toned-rhode-island- transplant neighbor (who my mom's best friend refers to simply as ""the bitch across the street"")is mad at my mother. Topping off her glass of box chablis, she told my father my mom started a rumor that she drinks scotch. Tracing the lineage of the gossip, neighbor lady claims Mom told Linda (the town treasurer who works in the office with my neighbor's husband and who rents a house my parents own) who told Mike (one of the garbage men) who told Della (his wife) who told her cousin, a transsexual named Danielle. (I wish i was making this up.) How it got from Danielle back to my neighbor, i do not know. I do know this however: My dad defended my mother's honor, my mother stumbled uncomfortably in using the correct pronouns to describe Danielle, and my neighbor does drink scotch- cases of it. 

My mom laughed, said she wished she had started it because its a good rumor, then proceeded to tell me about how our other neighbors have taken to parking cars on their lawn for spite. 

We continued our conversation with a discussion about poor breeding and ill mannered people, particularly that obtusely rude and crass group known only as ""northerners."" 

Then we swapped summer recipes. 

I love my mom."

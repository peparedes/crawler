I saw Gia the other night.  Very good movie.  I reccomend it if you want to cry.  EJ and I both cried at the end.  Yay!  We have souls!  ^_~;;;  

I have slept great for the past two nights.  MMmmmmmm.....  sleep is good.  *contented smile*  Okay, that's all of my news for now.  This was basically another of my ""I promise I'm still alive"" posts.

"event","So, I worked today.  We were really busy, too.  I was trying to do returns about three o'clock this afternoon, and Kim called me back up to my register to help with the massive back up of the lines.  So, I got there, and was checking out this lady, when the woman behind her puts her stuff on the counter as well.  Kind of annoying, but normal enough, really.  So, I started ringing up the stuff she had on the counter, and noticed that one of the cat toys had a price sticker on it that said $1.99.  I know that toy is about $4.99, so I took the sticker off.  Besides, the sticker gave a description of the toy as a ""rattler whale"" or something like that.  That was not the kind of toy the sticker was supposed to be on.  So, I told her that I saw the sticker, and took it off, but I couldn't give the toy to her at that price because it's wrong.  She very aggressively told me that all the toys like that back there had $1.99 stickers on them.  I told her that some stupid kid probably had done it as a prank, and she asked to speak to my manager because I had a real bad attitude to her.  So, I called Phil, and finished ringing up her items.  When Phil got there, I told him that the lady had an issue with the price of a toy, and showed the toy to him, and showed him the sticker I had pulled off of it.  She told him they were all like that, and he should give it to her for the $1.99 on the sticker because that's false advertising, and because I had had a bad attitude with her.  He went and looked for himself, and said none of the others had stickers on them, and he couldn't change the price for her.  She got all huffy and left.  After the lines went away, Kim told me that the lady she had been ringing up when the psycho woman said I had a bad attitude started laughing, which made Kim laugh.  Phil even asked, ""Did she really say you had a bad attitude?"" then he laughed and walked away.  I was amused that she called my overly-polite tone a bad attitude.  I kind of wonder what a good attitude would be for her.  Wait, that would mean that I gave her the toy for three dollars less than it rings up.  All of that fuss for three dollars.  People are really fucking weird.

Other than that, I had a pretty good day.  We closed early, I had to face the store because we were too busy to face while we were open, but I got it done pretty quickly.  Now, I have peppermint tea, and all the internet time I desire.

So, everyone has started back to school.  Except me, that is.  I'm sure I'll settle into a routine with my friends and boyfriend as far as working around school and work to see each other, but I haven't reached that point yet.  So, I'm going to have my little bout of self-pity and move on.  

I don't have much else to say, really.  And, contrary to what you may think having read the preceeding paragrah, I'm in a pretty good mood.  I don't work until 5 today, so I have until 4 or so to hang out and be a slug.  I might even get to hang out with Keith!  Or Kayla!  ^.^  And even if I see neither of those people, I'll probably still be in a good mood later.  Because I have no errands to run today, and no plans at all until work.  I'm horrid at making plans because, whenever I make them, they fall all apart.  *shrug*  Meh....

"event","Okay, stressful past few days.  I have been a total bitch to those I care about the most (again.  this is a really horrid habit.).  I couldn't register for classes this semester, so the Fox is taking the semester off and will work as much as possible.  I apparently never get to see my best friend again, mostly my own fault for pissing off both her and her boyfriend all in one fell swoop.  *cringe*  Ah well....  I work Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday this week.  Which, of course, means that everyone that I would like to hang out with will be unavailable mornings and all day Tuesday and Sunday.  Maybe not.  Maybe I'm just being overly pessimistic about the entire situation.  Then again, I might have to delve into books until Kayla decides I'm worth her time again.  Which could very well take a while.  As I said, I was a royal bitch Friday.  I didn't mean to be, in fact, after I borrowed Ann's fax machine, I wanted to go back to Keith's.  Keith and I ended up staying at Corrigan's with him and Kayla for most of the rest of the day, though.  Which means that I intruded on their Corrigan-and-Kayla time.  Which then makes me feel worse because I know they'd much rather be just the two of them, than have me and Keith around making it a foursome.  I'm through with my whining for now.  I go watch some History Channel now.

The people I worked with changed somewhat, but the basica atmosphere of the place and the way things are run has not changed one bit.

Seasickness is no fun.  *shakes head*  It should not happen. Ever.  But, I still caught two fish.  Had to throw them back, but I at least made the attempt to have fun.  ^_^;   So, Saturday was a loss.  I was still exhausted from being seasick and out in the sun on the water.  I was too tired to do much of anything.  I did have dinner with my aunt and uncle in Pearland.  The place they took us to was amazing.  I didn't eat, because mom and I had already had dinner, but I did have dessert.  Mmmm.  Very much good.  And Sunday, I got a phone call from Tim.  The guy I haven't spoken to in forever!  But it was good to talk to him.  He's in the Navy, and just broke up with his fiancee.  And he's in a new place, so he's a little lonely, I guess.  That's okay.  And Kevin and I had a talk.  We've agreed that we should just remain friends and not try to have any sort of romantic relationship.  We care for each other, but just not as anything other than a friend.  Which made my telling him about my date with Keith so much easier.  So, my weekend was a pretty good mix of both good and bad.  But, I have to say that I don't feel that my weekend was horrible at all.  I think that I generally had a good time the whole weekend.  Book calls, I shall post laterish.

And I am pretty sure it's there, just not sure in which closet.  Not the closest in my room, but there are two spare bedroom closets and the downstairs hall closet the robe might be hiding in.  And it could, possibly be lurking in the hall closet at my dad's house.  But I'm fairly certain it's at my mom's.

I'm a little over halfway done with <u>The Two Towers</u>, and I just got to the rather boring part with Frodo and Sam and Gollum/Smeagol going to the gates of Mordor.  Not a big fan of Sam.  I like Frodo well enough, but Sam is lacking something.  I'm not sure what, I just don't like him as much as other characters like Frodo and Aragron and Gimli.  Aragorn has the whole ""i've got a tortured past and won't talk about it, i'll just deal with it and love my elven girlfriend"" thing going for him.  Gimli is cool because he gets some of the coolest lines.  In this book, he goes on and on about the caves behind Helmsdeep (there's a name, but I can't think of it at the moment).  That just made him seem not the gruff dwarf; more of a guy who won't show his whole heart so he won't get hurt so much.  And Frodo is cool because he's the Ringbearer.  He's so full of doubt about himself, he just can't bring himself to believe that he will make it back to Rivendell or the Shire.  He pities Gollum because he can see how easy it would be for himself to get to that point because of the Ring.  On the whole, I think I like the book, though.  It doesn't suck.  The plotness is moving, if slow.  It's not for everyone though.  I know that a lot of people won't be able to get into it because it's very dry, and kinda boring in places.  Well, I have to go now.

"event","I saw Chicago today with Alisa and Kat, her neighbor.  SUCH a good movie!  Oh, God, I could go on about it for hours.  The basic response is still Go see it yourself!  If you like musicals like Moulin Rouge, then you'll probably enjoy Chicago.  *goes off and remembers the movie, eagerly anticipating its release to video*  *comes back singing some of the sweet, sweet songs*  I played much DDR today.  Too many songs on Trick and nearly fell on my nose.  :P  The weather was cold and rainy.  It was more like freezing rain, really.  Especially when it was hitting you in the face even though you've got on a hat, a scarf, and the collar of your jacket pulled up.  grarr.... Stupid weather.  Well, I guess that's all of my news for today.  ^_^  Ja!

"event","I feel very unloved.  Not just today, or this week, either.  Just generally unloved.  I've felt this way for a while.  I just can't bring myself to say anything to my friends because they'd get upset.  They don't like it when I start thinking my depressing thoughts and don't tell them.  I usually do, but I just don't think I can this time.  They've all got their lives and I don't.  I'm very unhappy here.  I have no friends and I'm too shy to talk to anyone in my classes.  Except for talking to Morgan in Poli. Sci., and I only talk to him because we were in Theatre together last semester.  And he spoke to me first.  I'm a total clutz around anyone I remotely like, so flirting is completely out of the picture.  All I do is squeak, blush, and run off; just like a jr high schooler!  -_-;  No one ever calls my cell, which is fine.  They've got their own lives to lead, and I need to find mine.  I just haven't.  I don't think I will here.  I always feel like I'm inturding on something when I visit Kristen or Jonathan in Houston or when I talk to Kay on her cell.  Like they tolerate me, but really wish I had chosen a different time.  I trust them and I love them, but I always feel bad when I call them.  I feel like a loser with no life.  Which I am.  *shakes head*  I'm going to read or something now.

"event","""You take that back, Gavirin Escovor!"" a young voice shouted from one end of the stalls.
""Make me, Aidil!"" a boy's voice replied, just as loudly.  There was the sound of a scuffle before two children tumbled out of the stall they were cleaning, pounding on each other.  The dark girl quickly siezed the advantage by kneeing her opponent in the groin and pouncing on him when he doubled up in pain.  She was well on her way to removing his teeth with her fists when the Captal arrived in the stalls.
""What is this nonsense?"" she bellowed, effectively stopping the fight.  Aidil stood, then helped Gavirin to rise before facing the Captal's fury.  ""I come in here to take my horse out for exercise and I find two children not doing their chores but fighting!  What is your explanation Aidil?""
""He said my mother never wanted me, so she abandoned me and Kantor and that's why we're adopted.  She never gave us her Name because she didn't want us,"" Aidil said clearly, looking the Captal in the face. ""I told him to take it back, and he said 'make me' so I did.""
""And you Gavirin?"" the Captal asked. ""What is your account of the events leading to the fight?""
""She's right, Captal.  I said those things about her mother,"" the boy looked at the floor, scuffing his feet in the dirt. ""But I only said them because she called my brother stupid.""
""Both of you have acted stupidly and made poor decisions,"" the Captal said after a moment of thought. ""Aidil, you will have five days of kitchen duty for fighting, and Gavirin, you will have three weeks of stable-cleaning for slander.  But your punishments do not start until you have finished your chores and classes for today.  So get back to cleaning the stables before I decided to increase the punishment!""  
The children dashed back to the stall they had been mucking out before their fight as Cailet led her horse out of its stall, and saddled it. 
<i>I want to know what the fight was really about, Gorsha.</i>  
<i>As do I.  There must be more to it than simple slander.  She and Kantor get stuff like that all the time from new people.</i>
<i>Which makes no sense.  She looks like an Ambrai.</i>
<i>None of the Ambrais here, though.</i>
<i>Hair the same dark brown as her father's.  Blue eyes she and her brother acquired somewhere.  Taller than Sarra and not yet nine; Kantor is going to be taller than Jored when he gets his full growth.  Dusky skin like her father.</i>
<i>Jealous, Caisha?  She's going to be a real beauty.  Possibly enough to rival Imi Gorrst.</i>
<i>Don't tease, Gorsha.  We've a long way to go today, and I don't want to begin this trip with you teasing me about how another Ambrai will be prettier than me.</i>
<i>You're the only Ambrai I love.</i>
<i>You say that because you live in my head.  To change the subject: do you have any ideas about the twins' mother?</i>
<i>Still none.  They favor the Ambrai and Feiran sides in looks, so there really is nothing to go by but those blue eyes.</i>


More to come, but I'm seepy-tired."

"event","I was supposed to do stuff with Jonathan and Cole, but I never got a call saying when and where.  So, Marianne is doing stuff and I'm bored, bored, bored.  Ah well.  I actually DO have stuff planned for this weekend!  Kristen's birthday bash tomorrow and Warped Tour Sunday!!  Rahhhhh!!!!!!!  ^_^  

I have a new fanfic idea.  It's not really a new idea, but it's the first time I've wanted to write on it.  It's an Utena fanfic, Touga x Nanami.  They find out that they're adopted, and that starts a while chain of events ending in them having sex and whatnot.  :P~~  I'll write it tonight or tomorrow and post it on <a href=""http://www.fanfiction.net/"">fanfiction.net</a> tomorrow.  Wuu!!

"event","I went over to Jonathan's this evening.  We watched part of Macross something and part of Robotech.  Much coolness.  Jonathan and I made vanilla cokes and my hands still smell like vanilla!  o_O;;  Eeeeeeeeeeeeee.  I didn't do much else today.  I think Jonathan, Cole, me and some other people are going to do something tomorrow around one-ish.  Wuuu!!  ^_^  ja!

"event","Well, I am officially an asshole.  Something I thought girls could not be.  Well, I am one.  Eddie's game was today, and I told him I'd be tehre.  Then I went and FORGOT about it.  I am such an idiot.  I need to have someone apply a board to the back of my head when I do shit like this.  I'm sorry, Eddie!  I'll call tomorrow and tell you again, but I want everyone to know that I am sorry that I am an idiot and forgot about your game.  *smacks self upside the head*  I'm such a baka!  

I didn't do much today.  Hung out with Jonathan, Kevin, Kay, and Corrigan.  We went to the mall, and watched Jonathan play Onimusha.  Not very exciting.  Kay and I went to this church thing Marianna wanted us to attend.  It was okay, just a little too much for this girly.  I'm at Junners' and I really can't believe that I forgot about Cole's game.  I suppose this gives me even more of a right to call other people idiot.  We can smell our own, you know.  :P~  Well, ja!

"event","Today was pretty cool.  Had lunch with some friends at a thai place I can't seem to remember the name of.  Then a bunch of us went to a bowling alley.  Eddie and I weren't going to bowl, we were just going to laugh at the others.  We left before they started, and we were going to go to the mall, but my clumsy ass prevented that.  I had parked in a puddle, and when I was getting back into my car, I busted my ass.  I'm okay, I just have a scrape on my arm and a few on my back.  And I was soaked with foul-smelling water.  So, Eddie and I come back to my dad's house so I can shower and change, then we called Jonathan.  We went over to Jonathan's for about three hours.  We played video games, and watched anime, and basically had a good time. ^_^    Now, I'm bored out of my mind, and I think I'm going to go to bed shortly.  I hate mondays. 

Junners, Jonathan, this is for you: <b>TAKE MY REVOLUTION!</b> It's antisocial, and I think it might need therapy, I'm just not cut out to own a revolution.  So, take it, would you?

"event","Yesterday was cool.  Kay and I randomly decided to go to Katy Mills, but only David-boi could go with us.  ;__;  Ah well.  We had fun.  Junners played DDR in one of the arcades, I played Tekken 3!  I love the Tekken games.   When w got back, we went to the liberry, but they were closing.  At six!!  

David (different David) and I were talking on AIM last night about his girlfriend, and he wanted to go for a drive, so he asked if we could talk more.  So, he picked me up and we went to Starbucks for a while.  We talked about everything.  His girlfriend kept calling, but she would have been mad that we were talking.  David and I used to date, so that makes her even more protective when I'm around.  He and I are just friends.  We talked at Starbucks for a while, then we came back here and walked around the neighborhood and the elementary school nearby.  We talked until almost midnight.  I'm glad we did that.  We talked about EVERYthing.  It was great to be able to talk to someone I don't see everyday.  I love all of my friends, but a new friendly face is always nice .  

I think Jason and I are going to the Galleria.  I dunno when, but I'd like to take someone.  Ah well.  I shall go bathe.  ja!

"event","Saw Final Fantasy movie last night.  It was great.  I nearlt got sick, but I still had a fucking good time.  My stomach decided it needed to be a pain, so I ran to the bathroom, but I was lucky and didn't see my food. ^_^;;;   

Oh, my god!  The movie was AWSOME!!  I loved it from start to finish.  The animation was fantastic.  All the little things were great.  Freckles, hair, eyes, the little things that make an animated movie great.  

We saw the 10:40 showing, and it let out at twelve thirty.  I had an hour to be home, but I didn't want to go.  This is fairly normal, but I REALLY wanted to go out to, like, Denny's or IHOP.  Meh...   We didn't do anything.  Corrigan drove me and Kay here and we went to bed.  I slept, good, too!   Guess that's all.   Ja!

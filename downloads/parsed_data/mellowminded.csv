She was sent here from heaven and she's Daddy's little girl
As I drop to my knees by her bed at night
She talks to Jesus and I close my eyes
And I thank God for all of the joy in my life
Oh, but most of all for..

Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer
Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair
""Walk beside the pony Daddy, it's my first ride
I know the cake looks funny Daddy but I sure tried""
Oh, with all that I've done wrong, I must have done something right
To deserve a hug every morning and butterfly kisses at night

Sweet sixteen today
And she's lookin' like her mamma a little more every day
One part woman, the other part girl
To perfume and make-up, from ribbons and curls
Trying her wings out in a great big world
But I remember...

Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer
Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair
You know how much I love you Daddy
But if you don't mind I'm only gonna kiss you on the cheek this time
Oh, with all that I've done wrong, I must have done something right
To deserve her love every morning and butterfly kisses at night

Oh the precious times
Oh, like the wind the years go by
Precious butterfly
Spread your wings and fly

She'll change her name today
and she'll make a promise and I'll give her away
Standing in the bride room just staring at her
She asked me what I'm thinking and I said ""I'm not sure,
I just feel like I'm losing my baby girl""
And she leaned over...and gave me...

Butterfly kisses with her mamma there
Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair
""Walk me down the aisle Daddy, it's just about time
Does my wedding gown look pretty Daddy? Daddy don't cry""
Oh, with all that I've done wrong, I must have done something right
To deserve her love every morning and butterfly kisses

I couldn't ask God for more
Man, this is what love is
I know I've gotta let her go, but I'll always remember
Every hug in the morning and butterfly kisses



wow. its fucking hilarious how much i miss my dad.

except.
its not. :)

Saturday was me and Joey's 6th month anniversary. Yay.
It was perfect. Perfect, perfect, perfect. I wouldn't ask for anything more.
He slept over Friday and we just had fun being our goofy selves. It was quite enjoyable.
He went to work the next morning.. then came back afterword.
He brought me lovely red roses. They are beautiful. (And you know, if my camera weren't BROKEN.. I'd show you. The connector thingy doesn't work. whan. )
So... Then... we got ready and he took me to... *drum roll please*...





















THE KART RANCH. YES BITCH. :)

hehe. We played Putt Putt golf and rode the go-carts a few times.
Then we went to Marble Slab and got icecream. YUM.
Then we went to Albertson's and got Jones sodas :) YUMMY.

GOD. It was great. Haha. We came home. Chilled for a bit, then went to Blockbuster.
We rented ""The Passion Of The Jew"" Southpark. :) It was hilarious.
We went to sleep.

Woke up about about 9 this morning. Chilled for a little while.. then we went to the mall.
Loreauville Prom is April 16th. Meaning NEXT SATURDAY. and I don't have a dress. HAHAH.
yay. Didn't find anything at the mall.
Mom's supposed to take me so Carisma (sp?).
Hope we find something. Haha.
If not, we'll go back to Dillards. They have some cute stuff there.

All in all.. this was a magnificent weekend. 
As bad as things can be... Joey, Carisse, and a few other nifty people make my life awesome. :)"

Will someone please call a surgeon
Who can crack my ribs and repair this broken heart
That your're deserting for better company?
I can't accept that it's over...
And I will block the door like a goalie tending the net
In the third quarter of a tied-game rivalry

So just say how to make it right
And I swear I'll do my best to comply

Tell me am I right to think that there could be nothing better
Than making you my bride and slowly growing old together?

I feel must I interject here you're getting carried away feeling sorry for yourself
With these revisions and gaps in history
So let me help you remember.
I've made charts and graphs that should finally make it clear.
I've prepared a lecture on why I have to leave

So please back away and let me go
I can't my darling I love you so...
But oh, oh...

Tell me am I right to think that there could be nothing better
Than making you my bride and slowly growing old together?

Don't you feed me lines about some idealistic future
Your heart won't heal right if you keep tearing out the sutures

I know that I have made mistakes and I swear
I'll never wrong you again
You've got allure I can't deny,
But you've had your chance so say goodbye
Say goodbye

i realized how much i miss her... especially the other day in PE when we had to walk.
i didn't even want to walk with anyone else.. so just kinda walked by myself.
seeing her the other night was cool.. too bad i only see her in little segments of time. :(

i miss fazzio too.
looking back at all those old pics.

fun times...


i feel really bad that i spend every weekend with joey.
i feel like i'm tearing away from my other friends.
but it's like.. with a best friend.. you spend all of your time... ya know?
joey is my bestfriend. its not that i'm choosing him due to gender..
i mean, geena and i were inseparable at one point.
same with kelly.
i want people to realize that.
the time i have with joey i cherish just like i would with any other friend.
gahhh i love him.

this summer should be really good.
i will get to see my other friends alot more.
hope everyone understands.... or whatever....

coin operated boy
sitting on the shelf he is just a toy
but i turn him on and he comes to life
automatic joy
that is why i want a coin operated boy

made of plastic and elastic
he is rugged and long-lasting
who could ever ever ask for more
love without complications galore
many shapes and weights to choose from
i will never leave my bedroom
i will never cry at night again
wrap my arms around him and pretend....

coin operated boy
all the other real ones that i destroy
cannot hold a candle to my new boy and i'll
never let him go and i'll never be alone
not with my coin operated boy......

this bridge was written to make you feel smittener
with my sad picture of girl getting bitterer
can you extract me from my plastic fantasy
i didnt think so but im still convinceable
will you persist even after i bet you
a billion dollars that i'll never love you
will you persist even after i kiss you
goodbye for the last time
will you keep on trying to prove it?
i'm dying to lose it...
i want it
i want you
i want a coin operated boy.

and if i had a star to wish on
for my life i cant imagine
any flesh and blood could be his match
i can even take him in the bath

coin operated boy
he may not be real experienced with girls
but i know he feels like a boy should feel
isnt that the point that is why i want a
coin operated boy
with his pretty coin operated voice
saying that he loves me that hes thinking of me
straight and to the point
that is why i want
a coin operated boy.

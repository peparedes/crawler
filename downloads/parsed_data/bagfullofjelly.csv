 Casinos, pornos, stock shows, where white trash goes to die.

 Through the miles of garbage, 
 Beneath all the junk that we owned.
 Carbon dating beer cans, condoms and twinkie wrappers.

 If you you were worth it, 
 They'd skin you, too, for new tennis shoes,

 Like I'm hunting, calling someone, or buying something.

 Someone famous like Gilbert Gottfried 
 Or the dog from Frasier.

 He was a punk. I knew him in high school.

BTW, www.bagfullofjelly.com is moving to another host...so it'll be back up in about a week. I kinda don't like the new host though...but I'm getting 200x more for half the price. But then my downloads are capped at 56.6kbps. Although I've heard people getting 100kbps, it's nothing compared to the 300kbps I used to get on my old host. :(

I might be looking for another sooner or later (I'm stuck with 1and1.com for 6 months, but it was only 20 bucks). My previous host was www.asmallorange.com, which I just remember seeing it in someone's sig on Neowin. :p I'd love to use Ice9, but the competition is just so much more bang for your buck. :/ Sorry hdrex. I've heard GoDaddy.com is good, but I'd really have to try it. Wish there was some sort of demo site/control panel. 

(BTW: I can't wait for <a href=""http://www.koregraphik.com/home/"">this guy's</a> CMS to be released. :O

Some of you also may know I work at a game store, EBGames.

All of our PS3s are reserved so there are no campers outside. But the Target in the shopping center where I work is getting 10, so there has been a line out there for about 3 days. Well, me and the assistant manager decided it would be fun to take one of your PS3 and Wii display boxes and walk over there to fuck with the people. So we walked over there, I had the Wii, he had the PS3. And we just say, ""Sup guys, we work over at the EBGames, and we already have the systems in...do you want to buy them? $4,000 for the PS3, and $5,000 for the Wii...because it's still 2 days away."" Sadly none of them had $4,000.

I wish we videotaped it because their reactions were hilarious."

- I'm getting my lisensesce this week, Thursday to be exact. I know, it's about damn time. :p

- Quitting my job soon, my boss is leaving for a better job and all my friends are leaving too. Really the only reason I was staying there. There's a few places looking for people around Oakley, so I'm going to apply soon.

- My little brother and sister got kittens. They're fuzzy and cute and now I want one.

- My college situation is currently a little rocky. Found out Academy of Art is $80,000 for the 4 years...so I was debating whether or not to go there or DVC for a few years to get the academic shit out of the way then go to the Academy. But they called me the other day and basically said, ""We know you applied for FAFSA but were denied blah blah blah, but we would really like you to enroll with us, so we're trying to get you a big financial aid sum blah blah blah, we need your infoz."" So I sent them my info and I'm waiting for a response.

- [WoW in 4 sentences] Server transfers opened, Frosted/Alchingon/Faazy (3 guild officers) left Dunemaul/Subversion (joined Conquest), Subversion broke up, Kilinar is no longer on Dunemaul (joined Paradigm on Destromath). There are quite a few girl gamers out there, probably 10% of the WoW population. Just noticed this when a girl speaks on vent or whatever. They aren't as rare as people think it seems.

- Been thinking about a lot of things lately. Looking back into my Livejournal, I could actually see when my personality changed. It's kinda funny.

Well this was probably boring, but hey.

Some game type updates.

- Call of Juarez is a pretty fun game, the demo is out right now. It's a western FPS with full akimbo control and stuff.
- NWN:2 comes out in October. Mike better be ready to play some Co-op!
- Beat Doom 3 for some reason, watched the Doom movie. (It sucked, bad. Thank you for not taking me that one day you guys went :D).
- Warcraft III is fun, Defense of the Ancients is more fun.
- Heroes of Might and Magic V is mega cool, me and Ryan are gonna play it online after he buys it.
- Hitman: Blood Money is not the type of game for me, too impatient to sit around for days and days. I just sorta get a SMG and kill everybody.
- Heh, Soldat.
- Portal looks like a bunch of fun. Episode 2 should be around soon.

The end."

"event","I'm going to be succinct.

To pretend to be the only one feeling used is a fallacy.  Let's go back to Sophomore year, roll camera.

- Mike meets a girl, Derek wants Mike to bring him to CHS to meet some of the girl's friends.  Mike refuses on the grounds of: Only have known these people for about 2 days.  Derek becomes very angry at Mike, doesn't talk to him.  Mike seeks an answer to this anger.  Answer: Mike is not spending enough time with his friends.  Mike breaks up with girl after a while because of pressure to spend more time with friends.  Derek becomes happy.

Now, all throughout Junior year and into Senior year I felt so rejected by you (and Tom).  You guys never called me.  Ever.  You assumed I just wanted to do other things than hang out with my friends, which is completely absurd.  I would rather cut my balls off than not be able to hang out with friends.  Before I even realized that you guys hung out like every weekend, I just thought, ""Well if they wanna hang out, they'll call me and invite me.""  The call never came. 

I have friends that I hang out with, daily.  Sure, it's not direct, but I'm still able to call these people my friends.  Because they are fun to be around, and we have mutual fun together.

Now, before you go on to say, ""Well real-life friends should take importance over 'fake' friends."" Let me say this.

I agree. I totally agree, but how am I supposed to hang out with you guys when you don't let me? I'm not going to call you and say, ""Come pick me up, we're going to hang out."" I feel like such a burden when asking to hang out, and I shouldn't feel like a burden to my friends.  And what Derek said to me earlier tonight just ratifies that. Feeling 'used' because someone who called you a friend wanted to hang out. What is that shit? Who cares if I wanted to hang out at Fry's or the International Women's Rights march. It shouldn't fucking matter because the point of hanging out is to chill with eachother. It shouldn't matter where you go, and that argument is completely ungrounded. If you want, I can put it in a different view. I'm a noob at hanging out, where would be a good place to go?

Throughout senior year I haven't been invited to go anywhere or do anything with you guys.  How do you think that makes me feel? Remember when we stayed at my house and we lit smoke bombs on the street and beat-up little kids at Q-ZAR?

That was quite possibly the most fun I have ever had.

But when did I get asked to go anywhere else and hang out with you guys? Hmm, never. It's not like I lived WITHIN BIKING DISTANCE of Derek's house. To be honest, I'm not even playing WoW that much anymore, it's a bad habit, I'll give it that, and obviously not worth it. But, I'm done appeasing other people.

If they can't accept these facts I have laid out, then they can GTFO. I'm done with other people's shit. If you can't accept that, tough luck. I'm done with it, I've wanted to have been done with it since Junior year. The line should have been drawn earlier.

This took too much time."

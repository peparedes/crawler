"event","Yes, I know that I am a total slacker when it comes to blogging. 
It isn't that I don't like to write, but more that I don't think people really want to read it. 

For those who don't know..it's a boy. His name will be William. 

Anyway, I am 36 weeks pregnant and totally ready to throw in the towel. As I mentioned last time, I've had it pretty easy. These last couple of months have been difficult and I seem to have made up for a lack of morning sickness early in the pregnancy by pissing off my gallbladder. I've managed to only gain 9 pounds but my doc thinks that's too much. 
If he can show me the evidence that I'm going to have a gigantor baby, I'll lay off the sorbet. 

My Husband and parents have decided that I'm not allowed to go out without a chaperone anymore. Not because they're afraid I'll go into labor, but because they're worried I'll get into a fight. My patience with fellow human beings is very, very short at the moment and I have snapped at more than a few people. Mostly they deserved it. However, telling a bank manager to ""suck it"" might come back to haunt me. 

The nursery is ready and I am very grateful to the people who have let me borrow things. All is all I think that materially I'm ready. Mentally, I'm still terrified. I think my two goals are: Not make it dead, and not have him hate me too much when he's in therapy later in life....oh yeah, and not be a sociopathic serial killer."

"event","Okay....so I'm a little more in control of my hormones and sarcasm.
I'm sorry for being a negative nancy. 

In all seriousness, I have been really lucky with the pregnancy so far. Only occasional nausea, but a serious lack of appetite. Depending on whose scale I want to believe (mine is much friendlier) I've only gained a pound or two. I blame that more on appetite than divine intervention. My biggest complaint has been fatigue and general laziness. 

I'll be glad, however, when I look more like a pregnant woman and less like a candidate for ""Biggest Loser"". 

Everything seems to be going well, despite my anxiety (Damn Xanax for being a category D drug, typically on the ""no-no"" list) It's hard to deal with the fact that I only get two ultrasounds and I've already had one that was perfunctory. I got to see the heartbeat for a few seconds but that was about it. I'm trying to resist the urge to get a Doppler so I can hear the heartbeat whenever I want. I really don't want to be one of ""those"" mothers. 

The first question I was asked was, ""did you quit smoking?"" Despite my desire to respond, ""No, I upped it to 2 packs a day and toss down a bottle of gin for good luck"". I am happy to say that yes, I did quit. Cold turkey....not something I recommend. It's do-able, but not comfortable. I got off the Diet Coke as well, thankfully without the caffeine headache. I do splurge on iced tea from time to time...sue me. 

Right now the reality of the situation is settling in. How the hell am I supposed to keep the house clean and take care of a newborn. How am I going to keep the baby from waking hubby up since he gets 2 weeks paternity leave and then has to go back to getting up at 4:30am.

Last but not least...I'm irritated at having to wait to find out what it is. I want to start making a list of thing I want, but it's hard without deciding to make EVERYTHING green and yellow. Granted, if my girl child has to wear a tractor onesie...it's a little early for her to have an identity crisis...besides, I drove a combine harvester when I was little and I still like girlie stuff. 

Thank you for baring with me as I go through this. Some of you may not give a shit, and that's okay. But some of you may find it amusing as I work my way through the Mommy Wars. 
Oh yes....don't be fooled. There is a competition among pregnant women as to who can be the best: Gain the least amount of weight; continue working until her water breaks in the boardroom; keep up the spin class with a side of power aerobics; have speakers wired in so the fetus has a constant line to the classics; swear that that will have a natural, beautiful birthing experience.....whatever. I've already opted for drugs. Lots of them. And, my speakers are playing Danzig and Crystal Method."

For those of you who might be remotely interested..... I'm 9 weeks pregnant.
For all the questions I keep getting, I decided to start a FAQ.

#1. How are you feeling?
As fine as can be expected with a parasite living in my lady parts.

#2. Do you have morning sickness?
I'd like to re-name it, gestational bulimia. 
Bulimics like to keep their vomiting a secret....so do I.

#3. Do you want to find out what it is, or do you want it to be a surprise?
Personally, I'd like to know what to plan for. But, if YOU want to be surprised, don't ask me.

#4. Do things smell funny?
Yes...don't be offended if I wrinkle my nose at that great ""special sauce"" you've got on your sandwich. I can smell it from across the room. Not your fault...not mine either.

#5. When is it due?
January 4th, 2010. But with my luck it will be while I'm at a New Year's eve party, ""So sorry about your carpet.""

#6. This is going to be a life changing experience for you. 
No shit. You mean I can't shove it in a crate like the dogs and go party?

#7. Aren't you excited?
I hate this question. If I say, ""no""...I get the STARE OF DOOM. I have obviously flunked the first ""Stepford Mom"" test. Perhaps I should put on my best cheerleader smile and say, ""like Oh my God, I am like soooo excited!"". 
Frankly, I'm too terrified to be jump up and down, spirit fingers excited. Being pregnant isn't something I consider to be a happy, shiny experience. The end product? very exciting.

#8. Are you boobs tender? (no kidding...)
Touch them and I'll kill you.

I haven't put the ""news"" out on FB yet. I might later on this week. :)"

Havana South is a restaurant here in Buford. It's very good, I highly recommend it.

Trey Dawson is a character in the Sookie Stackhouse novels. He apparently also like to frequent cuban restaurants. Okay, I admit...I stared for a few minutes. Until our waiter showed up.

Holy shit, it was Jasper Cullen. As though someone had plucked him out of my brain. It was very very hard not to stare. Very. And no, he wasn't Cuban. Sandy blonde, not too tall, dancer's build, sweet face, pale complexion with even the slightly bruised under-eyes. It was extremely disconcerting but he was disturbingly pleasant to look at. 

I don't expect anyone to ever live up to my idea of Edward. Pattinson is close, but not quite.
I guess it the same as Lestat. No one has ever looked like Lestat to me.

When did we become a nation so full of people who believe in ""something for nothing""?
When did we become so jealous of what the Jones' have that we think it's perfectly fine to take it from them instead of working for it ourselves? 

A government that is big enough to give you all you want is big enough to take it all away. Don't think it can't happen.

I'm against the ""spread the wealth"" shit. I find it ironic that right after we got our last ""stimulus"" check for $1200, we also got a letter from the IRS saying that we owed them $1200. 

I'm against the Fairness Doctrine.
I'm FOR immigration reform.

Basically, I'm against the government telling me what I should have, how much I should have, and what to do with what I already have. If I wanted to be baby-sat, there are a lot of other countries I could go to. China, for instance. Or England, or France."

"event","I had a lot of fun this weekend. I remember why I don't drink very often....
#1. I get drunk
#2. I get mostly naked
#3. I have no inhibitions or sense of judgment

Which is why swimming in a lake at midnight seemed like SUCH a good idea.
I will admit, however, that I really enjoyed it. Quite liberating in fact. 

We (Meg and I) got to site earlyish on Friday and decided to go grab a bite to eat. We saw a bunch of signs for ""Heavy's BBQ"". Being fans of BBQ, we thought ""Score!"". 

I'm going to do my best to describe this place, but it really won't capture the full creepiness of being watched by a room full of taxidermy.

Heavy's claim to (minimal) fame is that Sweet Home Alabama filmed there. I hope that they were paid well 'cause the food ain't gonna make 'em rich. The outside of the restaurant is all Southern kitsch and props left by the movie people. The inside is more like a scene out of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. We ordered our food at the bar and walked into the dining room, expecting a tasty meal. For $11 a plate, it should have been fuckin' fantastic. The tables are long picnic benches with a bottle of BBQ sauce and a loaf of white bread on them. The bread being the more palatable of the two. In attendance for our meal was a complete compliment of stuffed wildlife in various aggressive poses. Under these animals were plaques that informed us of who did the killin', and when that might have taken place. There were such fine examples as:

Fox
Killed by 2 dogs
1963

Turkey
Killed by Heavy's rifle
1967

I shit you not.

The BBQ was so bad, we couldn't eat it. I equate the flavor with upending a bottle of vinegar into your mouth, swiftly followed by the contents of a pepper mill. 

Picture if you will two grown women trying to sneak their full plates into the garbage without the lady up front seeing us. Had it been any other place, I would have complained. There, I didn't want to get shot and possibly end up in tomorrow's BBQ. After we made our escape...we drove 18 miles to the nearest McD's to get the taste out of our mouths.

The event itself (Legends) was very lightly attended, but a lot of fun in a familial sort of way. I received a nice sushi set as the prize for winning the archery tourney and got to sit at head table, which I'd never done before. The feast was Chinese-themed and extremely tasty. Duchess Deirdre did a wonderful job. Afterward we all walked down to the lake to release lanterns that carried our wishes or prayers on small rolled-up pieces of paper. It was an emotional moment for me. 

Packing up on Sunday with a hangover....not fun.
Pancakes at Cracker Barrel...worth every moment."

"event","Yesterday, I went with my Father to take a drive along Highway 411 into Alabama. They are having a highway-long yard sale this weekend and Dad didn't want to go by himself. It also gave us an excuse to go see family that lives up on Sand Rock.

Part of the fun is the drive itself. I love looking out the window at the scenery and wishing that I had land over there. I want a house where the master bedroom windows open out onto a mountain vista. The kind of place where you can walk around naked in the house and not worry about being arrested. 

If you've ever been to a yard sale, you'll know that while it can be fun....it's also depressing. It is a small vignette into someone else's life. Sometimes the picture isn't very pretty. The area that we were in has a very high percentage of Meth use and production. I have seen more burned out and blown up homes in that one area than anywhere else I've ever been. Their burned carcasses a sobering reminder of how prevalent the production is.  

Things in a yard sale tend to have that unwanted funk. They smell like old people, or must, or some other unpleasant thing. 
There's also the annoying task of having someone think that the junk they have is worth a lot more than it actually is...and telling you a whole bunch of bullshit about how it's a heirloom and they don't really want to get rid of it...The dusty rug-hooked owl is NOT a heirloom, or you wouldn't be getting rid of it and no, I don't want it either. 

I did, however, find one or two things. A very nice, seasoned, cast iron Dutch Oven for Ploppy (he's getting his kit together for camp cooking) and some paperbacks. My Father decided that he couldn't live without a stethoscope. Why? I have no idea. I don't think even he knows. 
I didn't find anything archery related except for a couple of compound bows. 

I had a good time though. :)"

Yesterday I went to see Ghost Town with Meg. It was pretty cute...I laughed a bunch.
Then, last night, a group of us went to Netherworld haunted house. In the grand scheme of things, it's the same as all other haunted houses. The main purpose being to scare you. 

There are some people who go in trying to be all ""bad-ass"" and ""you can't scare me"". If you aren't going to get into the spirit of it, why bother going at all? The people who work there don't give a shit how *quippy* you are, they're probably heard it 50 times already that evening. They don't want to talk costume design or make-up techniques...they're getting paid to make you scream. If they can't, they'll move on to someone they can. 

And yes...I screamed a lot. The animatronics were cool, I enjoyed them...but have someone jump out at me from a dark corner and I will scream like Jamie Lee Curtis.

I'm extremely pleased with the way it turned out. I shot about 15 ends (4 arrows per end) and only 6 or so of those arrows actually pierced the back of the bag. Not only that, but the bag holds the arrows nicely and allows for very easy retrieval without worrying about damaging the arrow when you do. But, I need more plastic bags to be able to finish the rest.

I'm making a new dress for the tavern at Red Tower. It, like all my other sewing projects, is coming along slowly. I need to make Ron 2 more tunics for the kitchen.

I'm spending next weekend with my best friend, which should be fun. She and I always have a good time together. :)  I had to buy Birthday presents yesterday for her, her daughter, and my husband.

I woke up this morning feeling like poo (which became a central theme to my day).
I just can't shake the feeling of exhaustion. I do a little, then I have to sit down. 

I plinked at milk jugs in my backyard for a little while as I was waiting for Irina to show up to pick up some more of her things. While helping her load things into her truck, I felt really nauseous and had to run inside (TMI, I know). The closest bathroom is the one in my sewing room but when I opened the door I realized that I had a much bigger problem than nausea. 

Our septic tank had backed up. Of course, we didn't realize we HAD a septic tank having been paying for sewage since we moved in. Great....just great. I call the rooter people and thankfully they were out within the hour. I apologized to Irina for the issue, and she went back to her sweet-smelling home.

It was the rooter-guy who finally figured out that we had a septic tank...bless his heart.
The rest of my day was spent cleaning up....joy. But, my house smells like bleach now and thank god we own a steam cleaner. I told the rooter-guy that I hoped whatever he did in his spare time smelled like roses and lavender. He thought that was funny. 

Fast forward to dinner. It's Friday, so it must be Taco Mac night. My husband, bless his special soul, proceeds to drink several pints of beer which continues after we get home. If he would just pass out, I wouldn't have as much of a problem with it. However, when he is in his cups (or overflowing it), he becomes very...ummm....determined. ""No"" is roughly translated by his inebriated mind into, ""if you follow me around the house and molest me, I might say yes.""
Thankfully, he's too drunk to be scary-forceful otherwise I'd be a sobbing mess in the corner.

I tell him that he's frightening me, and he thinks it's funny. What the hell am I supposed to do? I've told him that I'm not comfortable with the amount he's drinking, but he doesn't think it's an issue. I don't think he's an alcoholic, but he's definitely a binge drinker and I'm very worried about him. 

So, I'm sitting here at the computer waiting for him to go to sleep so I can remain unmolested.

I'm in a, ""what now?"" dilemma with one of them. She's in a very interesting situation, and I have no idea what should happen next without it sounding cliche. I need to just sit and stare at it until something comes to me. :)

If you're dying to read erotic stories, go back to April 22, 2006 and read ""Shower"". 
What REALLY sucks is that I had some rather nice things written on another blog. I canceled the account having mistakenly thought that I'd saved them.

Of course, once I start posting erotica I'm going to get the, ""How YOU doin'?"" look from the people I see IRL. *laugh*

My mother, at one point or another worked for her and was one of her hair models. (I'm going somewhere with this, bare with me) In my house, dying your hair was a right of passage. I've been doing it since I was 13. My natural hair color is, now, gray and I fully exercise my right to not be pleased about it by covering the crap up. 

Usually, my mother comes up to do it for me since coloring one's own hair is messy and not particularly easy. My mother is in England right now and, well, I don't feel like waiting for her to come back....so I'm doing it myself. 

Ploppy, bless his heart, when asked what color he thought I should dye it told me that it needed ""more red"". Hmmmm....""Okay."", I thought. ""I think I can handle that. At least he didn't say blonde."" 

I headed off to Sally's to buy the bottle of Dye (Much cheaper to mix your own rather than buy the kits). The woman was very helpful. I told her what I normally used, and what I was trying to accomplish so she gave me a handful of the necessary items and away I went.

It was strange trying to sleep while you're hooked up to lots and lots of wires. My biggest fear with this was that I would do something really embarrassing in my sleep. But, I tempered the fear with the knowledge that I didn't have anything to worry about and that the techs had probably seen it all before.

I pull in at 9pm last night and realized that it was just going to be me....and the tech. 
That's it. Nobody else. 

Okay, I can deal with this.

But then I see him. Damnit, he is SERIOUSLY handsome. So, back comes the fear of doing something really embarrassing in my sleep.

Now, of course, Irina says that there's a ""gussied up"" night...so I need something gussy. I can't decide between Italian or Spanish. Realistically, the Italian is easier from a patterning and basic construction standpoint. It's the embellishment that takes the time.

I think that in all, there will be 7-8 layers of ""stuff"" on these things. I should be done sometime next year. :)

When embellishing a garment there can always be ""more cowbell""."

"event","I figured I'd update on the Hildy saga.

After the first ""carving"", I thought that everything was hunky-dory until I took measurements. Nope....still not right.
So, back to the carving knife.

After a few minutes of happily hacking away, it dawned on me. If I take any more mammary foam off of her, she'll have A-cup tits. I have D's. I'm sensing a sports-bra and padding in her future. The problem is in the back measurement (between the shoulder blades) and NOT with the boobs anymore. 

So, I left those alone and took some off of her waist and hips so the measurements were the same there as well, although now it looks like someone Texas Chainsaw Massacre'd all over her ass. I've decided to put away the knife until professional help arrives (AKA Mom). Otherwise, I'm going to end up with the foam equivalent of a Gyro meat skewer.

The Pennsic sewing marathon is still in full-swing. I'm seeing the weeks dwindling away and I'm very afraid that I'm not going to get everything done. And frankly, my sewing room terrifies me. All I seem to be able to concentrate on are the myriad of ways I can fuck-up my projects. But, on a happier note, since I'm not going to D-con this year and Hildy isn't ready...I'll have to postpone my ""Devil's Handmaiden"" black PVC costume-o-rama until next year. And the Can-Can dress. Must do the Can-Can dress."

"event","I'm not sure if I've discussed the Hildy saga with you guys.

Hubby bought Hildy for me as a birthday present. She's an Uniquely You dress form. 
""Very cool"", I thought to myself as I removed her from the box. The first thing that happens to get noticed are the odd torpedo-like shape of the foam boobs. They really are a little disturbing.

Anyway...it comes with a Moulage (a cover that must be altered to fit you like a second skin).
Mom came up here and we spent 4 hours altering the damn thing. Finally, we were ready to ""dress"" Hildy. 

So there my mother and I were, wrestling on the ground with a foam dress dummy, trying like mad to get the moulage to zip up. After much swearing and giggling, it was done. 

We put Hildy right side up again and were shocked. Her boobs sit 4 inches lower than mine do. 
How the hell am I supposed to drape a pattern on a dummy with saggy girls? It just won't work.

After much consideration, and a beer. I got out the electric carving knife and went down to Hildy.
""If the people who made you had ever actually touched a breast, I wouldn't have to do this.""

A few minutes later and some quality control and analysis by my husband, Hildy's girls have been lifted to their correct position. 

I realize that most of you will never understand the trauma that Hildy has had to go through, but I would like to raise awareness by beginning the, ""Dress Form Dummy breast re-adjustment support group"". There must be others, who like Hildy, have suffered terribly simply because no one on the design team had ever copped a feel. 

Thank you for your support. 
With your understanding, Hildy will get through this difficult time."

"event","I can't think of a subject right now. 

A few mental notes for myself:

1. If you only have 1.5 yards of nifty fabric MAKE SURE that any adjustments you've made to pattern pieces, don't also alter OTHER pattern pieces. Digging around through small amounts of scrap to re-do a piece is not amusing. ""Well, Duh!"" I hear some of you saying...hey, this is a learning process for me, so stick it. 

2. Having 1.5 yards of said nifty fabric that also happens to have a nifty pattern on it, means that you probably won't be able to pattern match all your seams. So stop playing two-hours worth of pattern-piece Tetris. If that's the only thing that someone wants to nitpick my clothes about, they too can stick it.  

3. Be aware that nifty patterns in fabric do not look so nifty if they're directly over your boobs. 

4. Sleeves suck

5. Stress caused by a self-imposed deadline is stooooopid. But that probably won't stop me from doing it again in the future. 

6. Mars has 2 moons, the First US Commemorative coin had Christopher Columbus on it. 
Since those were the trivia questions we missed tonight, I felt they were worth noting. :)"

"event","I was going to have a nice quiet weekend...go to Alasais's party, nothing too dramatic.
But then....the bed happened. 
My parents came up Friday morning and didn't leave until this evening. Ron and my Dad decided that this was going to be War Bed weekend. My mom decided that while they were working on the bed, she was going to help me fit all the patterns for the oodles of things i have on my clothing ""wish list"". 

I think it would have been better if I had known they were going to be staying the entire weekend. 
Granted, I got a lot done and I'm much better prepared to make a Pennsic wardrobe now. Yes, I'm actually going to use some of the fabric I've been hiding away for 6 years. 

I learned A LOT about flat patterning (bless my mother) so I don't feel like I wasted the weekend.

But the big thing was the bed. 
Young Ploppy...of the Netherwallop Ploppy's....really outdid himself for his first bed.
I can't wait to set it up at war. 
The pic is a little blurry, but you should get the idea. I need a step stool to get on the damn thing.

For those of you who are in the SCA with me, I have no details to pass on. Please send your prayers to Beau Fort."

The trip was as good as it could have been, under the circumstances. 
I missed everyone very much, and I'm glad to be home. Three months is a long time. 

The biggest change since coming home is getting used to being a stay-at-home type person. 
I'm having to invent things to stress out about :)

I've spent the last week overhauling my sewing/workroom and it should be ready for creative-type things shortly. I'm going to be starting the Mad Hatter costume for D*Con soon and I've spent way too much time trying to find the right materials and accessories. I've decided to make my own corset rather than purchase another piece of crap one or spend $300. Since I already have the material, I can make one for $60 plus labor. 

Husband survived cooking for Mid-Winter. He was exhausted, but very pleased with himself. I'm really proud of him for not only attempting it (it was only his 3rd SCA event) but for the quality of the food and recipes. 

Okay, break over....back to cleaning."

There are about 10 family members coming in from Kent, and Nan is so consumed with having everything perfect for when they get here that she's driving Mum mental. Mum really isn't in the mood to cook, but that's what Nan is having her do. 
I told Mum to let me do it and not to worry herself, but so far she isn't listening to me.

I picked out the flower spray that will be from My husband and I. I had hoped that if I completely refused to do it, it would mean that none of this had happened. 

My Aunt was a councellor and touched many people's lives. One of her patients is particularly fragile. She's a dear soul and my Aunt was very fond of her and tried to protect her as best she could. I certainly don't know the details but I've heard that the things her family did to her as a child would give you nightmares. Anyway, This young woman is distraught over losing her friend and confidante, so Mum told her to keep talking to Margaret as if she was there. Tell her what was going on and how she felt...etc. 

She said that she was in front of her dresser, talking to Margaret about how sad she was and what was going to happen now and she worried about where Margie was...etc.. and a postcard that had been pinned to the wall fell down onto the bed. It was a postcard that had been pinned there for a good year or two and hadn't fallen before. The message on the back said, ""Hi!! I'm in paradise!"". 

My Aunt wasn't a Jesus Freak, but she was a spiritual woman. I firmly believe that she gave this woman some reassurance. 
I just wish that she would give some to my Mom. She needs it.
My Cousins are dealing with things using humor, which tends to come across as uncaring most of the time. My Grandmother, who lost her sister two weeks ago, and will probably lose a brother next week, is pretending that it isn't happening. 

And Mum has lost her best friend. They didn't do anything without running it by the other first. Just to make sure they weren't doing something silly. My Aunt was the strongest one. She made sure that their Brother didn't take advantage of our Nana.  Now there is just Mum left to look after Nan. The other two don't pull their weight. I can see my Mum staying here until my Nan passes away. 

What did I lose? Someone that I admired and wanted to emulate. Someone who was nice and kind even in the worst situations. Someone who's house always had an open door. Someone who would let me sleepover even when my cousins were away. Someone who encouraged my every endeavour, and never criticized my failures. 

Someone who loved me for who I was.
I'll miss you Auntie M.

- Tori"

My Mom is so fragile that it's scary to see her this way.
It doesn't help that she thinks it was her fault.
We're all lost without Margaret. She was everyone's rock. There's definitely a sense of, ""what the hell are we going to do now?"".

"event","Sean and his cousin jack wanted me and jess to sneak out but jess was talking to mikey on the computer so she didn't want to.. so i was like hell i am sneaking out, lol so sean, jack, and me went walking and then we went to seans house and chilled on his trampoline and had a blast just by goofing off. geeze we are easy made happy. lol but it sucked because it started to rain and i was having such a good time just talking with them and joking around.. but yeah it started to rain so they were going to walk me home i told sean that he didn't have to walk me home because it was raining.. so he just gave me a hug and jack said he would walk me home.. well we went into my neighbour hood ( right next to sean just cut through his back yeard and its my neighbor hood) so when we go out of his back yard i told jack he didn't have to walk me home because my house is down the street and that i would run home.. he was like i'll walk you home if you want me to. but i told him i didn't want him to get wet because he hates the ran.. so i hugged him and told him i would see him next year.. and then i rain home.. hahaha it was fun.. but then 10 mins later it stopped raining isn't that gay i wanted to go back outside but then it was like 3:20 so i did but i'll do it again to night YAY!!!

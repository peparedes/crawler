"event","Ah haha I think I just found a faster way of doing this! This is good cuz the long way didnt inspire me to comment. Also this new layout, if new at all, interests me. But any how, I got an apartment up here and Lex will be moving up here in no time flat. In fact 4 March is her arrival date. I am excited. That is all since all my stuff is officially classified at the school house."

"event","Yup, I'm still alive and kickin'. For the most part at least. Just really bored. Really, really bored. I got school, atleast. Am doing well in school. New friend too, she came up from florida only a few weeks ago. Came from kissimmee (spelling), in fact she was going to go to winter park before her mother disowned her. Would have been in a lot of anh's classes! Weird koinkydink! Names Malary, its cool. She and I are the only southern yankies in the school. Anyhow, my other big news is my cats are big now. That is all. Sorry, my life sucks at the moment, all though despite the suckyness Im still kind of happy."

They left the door open and she walked out. I wouldnt be so worried had it not been that Shana is an indoor cat and has never been outside long enough to learn the lay of the land. I dont know what to do..."

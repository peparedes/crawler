well goodness gracious.

what a day!
today was nice, as most thursdays are. 
class for 3 hours, and then no more school.
then the girls and i went shopping, twice. we went once, and then we went AGAIN. (which is the way ""twice"" normally works).

and then, to top it all off...we rented two, count it....1...2... TWO movies. we were outta control today.
then before breaking into our second movie, we watched the end of gothika, well i didn't because i am a pansy ass and can't handle anything, so i just listened to the movie. which was scary enough on its own. shoot. 

i <u>hate</u> scary movies!

oh and plus...here's the <big><b>BIG</b></big> news:

<center><u><b>i bought boat shoes</b></u></center>
<center>(they are amazing)</center>

anyway, tomorrow christina and i are going to see COLIN MOCHRIE.

yay. times a million

we made i &hearts; colin buttons.

oh wait no we didn't. 
because we do not have any sweet button making machines.
so damn.
oh well. we will just have to carry some of his children, that will work just as well.

so i had black hair last night, it was intense. i was so scene.

then we mardi gras'd. and casino'd. if you put a 'd after something it becomes past tense, i swear.
i kept thinking i had so much money but i really just had a bunch of little chips.

i won at blackjack, like a thousand times.
a thousand, honestly.

this morning i woke up at 8:30am, and i had breakfast, there were people there i had never seen before, because they were friday morning breakfasters...weirdos.

then dani ripped her pants, and paul wanted to see it, and will made fun of her, and laughed, which is funny.

---i just looked at the top of this updatey page and saw that it said ""post by phone"" for the paid account. now seriously folks, who is so livejournal inclined that they need to post from their phone? that is ridiculous. oh my gosh.

well, it is time to not do this anymore, because it is a movie day. which means we have to go rent a bunch of em and then get good stuff.

<i>someday somebody's gonna make you wanna turn around and say 'goodbye'
till then baby are you gonna let it hold you down and make you cry?
don't you know things will change, 
if you hold on for one more day things will go your way.</i>


have they ever gone my way. oh man.
such a good week lately.

cannot wait to go back to school.
honestly never thought i would ever say those words, unless they were like ""school to wait back to cannot go""
you know?

i am sad that i missed the lesbians. i am sorry zack. i hope you watched it extra good. is the OC paying you for all the promos? cause shoot. you spread the word, my friend. you are like peanut butter...but not the nutty kind, cause those don't spread well because they are so nutty. judges? true.

let's see, i made fun of iron maiden in the car last night, and i got yelled at because apparently ""it's iron maiden..god! what are you talking about!?!"" so that was kinda funny.

i sing in the car. and i dont like when people turn their lights off when it's really dark already and they say they can see the little road turtle reflector thingies but then when they turn their lights back on we are in the middle of the road...well i do like to be right, but i dont like the darkness and scariness of it. i also like to read this little book at night before i goto bed, but i dont like that i think it is giving me nightmares. (i'd switch over to the history channel, but i am deadly afraid of history) it's this book of whodunits, and after every story you have to figure it out and then you can check your answer, so i love it because i am an undercover detective (shit!), but now i have these terrible nightmares about crazy killers and dogs.

anyway that's enough for now.

well, it's 2005. what a nice round number. i'm almost positive it can be divided evenly by 5, and any number divisible by 5 is alright with me.

we spent the night at dom's last night. i sneeeeeeezed like a billion times, and my nose hurt.

then we ate at norm's (smron) the next morning/afternoon and sherrie, our waitress mocked joey, and i could tell it hurt.
freakin gumbo.

jamers saved $1.80 by making his own lemonade out of his water...but the joke was on him when they refilled the water because now it was like extremely watered down lemonade, and he had to steal mine, because mine was uncontaminated with lemons, cause i am not down with lemons in my water. it makes it all lemony (snicket, ha.)

speakin of the good ol' snicket...we saw that today...and i must say, i didn't like it. which was saddening. but it's just because the books were so much better. and i basically knew there was no way even jim carrey could do it justice, although he was funny.

then we saw life aquatic. it was funnier the second go-round.
so that was awesome.

now i am going to lay in bed and watch love actually, because i am in slacker mode and it is too cold to go outside and do stuff, not to mention that it is a quarter to 11pm, and the street lights are all on...so i'd have to be home anyway. ha.

i always get kinda sad when google doesn't have any fun little pictures around the word ""google""...it's a saddening event, you know?

just got back from san diego, it was fun.
we took the train...it was intense.

i am like almost done with my scarf...i made it too wide so it is taking forever. well, i like it wide, but i think my first scarf should have been like three stitches wide, so that way i would have felt like i accomplished more...my mom started it for me with 20 stitches wide, and now there are 31...i don't know how that happened.

tonight at dinner my dad and i decided that we are going to put k's in front of a lot of words, just cause it will be awesome. cause k's and a lot of consonants (aside from n's, of course) don't mix. not the k's and n's really make any sense. you KNow?

i KNew it all along.

in san diego, i made my parents go movie hopping. now they have a criminal record. we saw the incredibles AND meet the fockers.
my dad was real cool about it...pretending to go to the bathroom between movies, so they wouldn't suspect anything...that's thinking on your toes.

the previews right now are for the next starwars movie....and my mom kept breathing in my ear like darth vader. then  she leaned forward and did it to the lady in front of us...but either the lady didn't hear it or didn't think it was as funny as i did.

it would have been cool if the lady turned around and made a light saber (?) noise like she was gonna fight my mom. that would have been awesome.

i also made the mistake of showing my parents napoleon dynamite on christmas...now my dad keeps saying ""les i need some chapstick cause my lips hurt REAL BAD!""

it's a little funny. ha.    <- that's all the funny it is.

so that is that.
love all.
and if jenny is reading this.
you're funnier than ha.

you're so like a lot of ha's.
i know none of our other suitemates read it so you get the shout out.
felicitaciones..

maybe nadia will read it now.

this is jennie, paul, katie, and dani looking quite seductive

this here is katie molesting jennie, which i have heard is a daily occurrence, and then there is will, and dani laughing at the spectacle, when instead she should most likely be calling 911, or the police or some sort of help for poor jennie's face.

look at me updating...

alright so in the last...errr...month, not much has happened.

i got a new puppy, and i...yep that's it.

so this is why updating is so not a thing that is done by me anymore.

Donna (20) AND Christina (18) both had birthdays today.

so that was exciting.

my mom and i decorated the house, it's all be-yootiful now.

now  we are about to go to nikki's for tacos, and then i guess i will read something, studyworthy.
i guess.

jennie is a wallster, yeah, it's been a long time but you like it.

went to disneyland last night with joey, dave and jamers. it was so pretty, with all the christmas decoration-ness.

on the monorail on the way over there a few of the seats got ""snaked"" and i proceeded to tell some kid how i could hang him out the window by his ears instead of by his shoes cause they are less likely to fall off . 
then he told me that ears don't fall off. 
and i laughed.
i wasn't being mean. 
just go with it.

it was fun to run around the whole night.
dave's routes were always much faster than joey's. but i think dave might have cheated a little bit.
he more than likely set his watch back.

cause i know he would never run through a crowd of people to beat us somewhere.
ha.

then we had an unexpectedly expensive safari at rainforest cafe...blame dave for ordering the cherry coke.

then we mosied on over to the espn zone but did nothing. except ride some horses.
which was fun.

then we came back to the village for dog walkings. and delivering dave to his house.
because that is what the package said to do.

tonight the suiteys and i saw bridget jones numero dos, then we had some hot chocolate with bunny marshmallows, followed by some cards. oh yes. another night of awesome.

did you know that R.S.V.P. stands for something in french? something that sounds like ""recee seee vooo play"". now i will attempt to spell it for the amusement of all: <i>recis si vous ple</i>. 

see? 

now doesn't that look frenchy? 

i always thought it was some stupid american thing that made no sense so they made it into an acronym and just pretended like it was cool, like BYOB, that one is stupid...i don't want to bring your own beverage, you can get yours yourself, i'm gonna drink mine! 

besides, that acronym always makes me think of yacht clubs because there aren't many acronyms with Y in it, and most yacht clubs have a Y in their name. because ""yacht"" just so happens to start with the letter <b>Y</b>. duh.

i thought that RSVP stood for ""respond soon very please""  and it was like one of those spanish trippy things where the words are out of order, but that's because it's in SPANISH. these English speaking people had no excuse.

but now i learn its french...and those french...it's like they have a different word for everything!

okay so we were walking by some porta-potties...and there was a guy in one talking on his cell phone.

what has this world come to?
jeesh.

seriously.
porta-potties, used only if necessary, are for peeing as fast as one possibly can and getting the shootle out of there. 

they are not a place to kick back and have a conversation.

the guy's words, <i>""oh yeah i am just in the head right now...yeah everything went great, we were able to get in there and get everything taken down really quickly. there is just a bit more left...""</i>   now this is where i began to <u>die</u> laughing. the guy was not about to end his conversation, but i was also not about to hear anymore over the sound of my obnoxious laughter.

i thought it was funny how he tried to sweeten the idea of a porta-potty by calling it a ""head"".

""oh my god the cute squirrels""
-sealab

well i really have nothing to say.
i dont know why i bother.

i was on my computer so much last year, and this year i hardly ever use it.
that's crazy.

i went to disneyland and california adventure today.
i had never been to the california park before. it was kinda funny. it seems weird that they would bother making it another park.

we decided that maybe it would have been more affective in like ohio or montana or something.  you know? somewhere that all the attractions weren't already free. (and open past 6pm) ha.

""pickleweasel"" it IS a funny word.

last night was a funny night. 
hippies, mexican kings, and laughter.
melissa, dani and i drove to walmart in westminster. it was silly.
dani walked away and mel and i had no cellphone service in the building and we were a little scared. we are so pathetic.

we ended up buying an array of things there...from white hangers to disposable pink razors to gummi bears to condoms (for melissa, of course), and some new movies for good measure.

we had pizza and then went back to the lb for some sex...and the city, that is.
ha.

oh look my update the journal alarm went off...how cute.

well this week is coming to an end.
see i don't update this because i never have anything to say.
let's see.
i'm in tap dancing in college. this is what i love about college. i am receiving credit for taking a tap dancing class. awesome.

last night dani and i watched 50 first dates. i was crying and she fell asleep. what a girl.

we went to this thing at these guys house at baycrest, and while we were waiting to get in the gates this bum guy starts to come up behind us all talking and whatnot and were all trying to ignore him...because you see i'm used to hb bums...theyve got their own thing...and lb bums are just scary. so we were all freaking out telling these guys to hurry to the door, when this other guy comes up and opens the door for us and starts to talk to the bum so he got distracted and we could get through. that was intense.

almost as intense as when we were in hollywood at 7-11 and i thought i was gonna die. 
freakin bums and their sunchip bags full of BEANS.

do you ever feel like you are doing everything you can to move forward...but all you're doing is going back?
what the cheese?

i have been working all summer to get my stuff together so i can make the move back fast and painless...but it seems like everything i am doing does not need to be done. for instance my mom gave me this thing to put stuff  in and i am trying to use it cause i know exactly where i put it...but the stuff i am putting in it doesn't make any sense. so do i really need to use it??

i don't know. and i know whoever reads this has no idea what i am talking about. so i will just stop.

it's just that this has been one of the most frustrating summers and ends of summers ever.

don't get me wrong i have enjoyed the hell out of it...but my god. i am honestly ready to get back to school so i can slack off a bit.

i almost want to cry (but i think we all know i won't...really if you've seen me cry, you're one in the few), because i can't understand how things are going to work. i like how things have been working out in the past. but who knows how they will now.

<big>i <u>hate</u> not knowing.</big>
i used to tell donna that you just have to wait until things happen. but for once i cannot swallow my own advice. it's just too much.
i know i will make it, but i don't want to JUST make it...i want to do more. but from where i am standing that seems completely impossible. <i>and that is what freaks me out.</i>

i feel a little crazy.
after sunday i am sure i will feel oodles better, but sunday is not today. and you may say...yeah it's one day away...but in this one day i have like 345334059783409709345 things to do...so i want it to be sunday so BAD.


okay that's enough whining.

wow i should really go to sleep but i can't. see now if that  is not some kinda predicament then i dont know what is.


regardless.

tonight i ate raspberry boats and jelly rats with dom, vish and noel at taco bell....well we didn't order them there. they 'em picked up at IKEA. so yay.


anyway i got off work all early and that is always good, unless like you love to be at work for obscene amounts of time...then it's bad. but as long as you don't it's good. and i don't...so i was stoked.

---see the logic at work here? impressive, huh?---

yesterday i was a pasenger in a car. crazy.
i sang. 
that's why i'm not allowed to be a pasenger. 
(i sing a little less loud when i drive.)


JG pancake breakfast for the nephew tomorrow morning, then work. woo. no. well partly woo but then a lot of no.
woo: ...lake park always cool. and my nephew.
no: i have to go to the park before work (8:30am) so that means i have to be there at like 7:30am...wow. which means i have to wake up at 7:15am. yowza.

so it is time to sleep. i guess."

"" i'm depressed. i guess i'm kinda thinking about my old girlfriend...i guess i kinda miss her. and ummm...she's not living anymore....so... i guess i kinda blame myself for her death. we were at a party one night we weren't getting along, we were fighting. she began to drink and she ran out to the car and i followed her out and i guess i didn't realize how much she'd been drinking, she asked me to drive her home. and i refused. we argued a little bit longer, she asked me once again, 'would you please drive me home?' and i didn't want to... so i shot her. with a shot gun. ha ha.""

oh, typing skills are so over rated.

now that's a direct quote. FROM ME.

see right now i should be taking a shower so i can go to class....but first do my homework, but as usual i am not doing what i should.

hmmmm....try that on for size.
what?
i don't know.


""you once told me i was crazy...for being a fool"" -all that's left
well i am a fool.
so that's all there is to it.
i love being a fool. 
i am so good at it.
it is just my default personality.

i wrote a story the other night called ""saturday night streetlights"".
it's good. i wrote it in 9 minutes. it's 3 pages long.
i think i might send it to a magazine.
i would read it.

don't ask to read it...cause i won't let you.

so tonight i found out that dave's cell phone is so much better than mine. he has the <big>SUPER INTER-CONTINENTAL PLAN</big> from sheryl and claudia at verizon or something...oh dave. it was amusing to have a four way...<b><u>conversation</u></b> with dave, dina and jamers ON OUR VARIETY OF CELL PHONES...then we had a five way with brian and then another five way with joey...but i pretended to be dina and whatnot...confusing YET interesting.

anyway...i thought for like 2 minutes that i was really good at nintendo....but then i woke up.

THEN i had a dream that i won big at poker last night with just an ante (?) but then....i woke up. damned freaking state of awakeness.

tomorrow is saturday...well today might be but it doesnt count til i wake up. you know??

i apparently dont need caffeine or any kind of stimulant...since all week people have been telling me i do not need ""caffeine or any kind of stimulant"" whatever.

alright. time for some caffeine...or any kind of stimulant.

so today i had work...BUT that is beside the point.

<big>the point is</big>:  sunday was awesome. (today was awesome...today was sunday) so totally socratic method...but not.

alright, so first after work dina and meera picked me up and we went to lunch...then dom and jamers and dina and i went to see the movie SAVED! which was hilarious.

then AFTER that (<i>as if that wasn't enough for one day</i>) brian came and picked up dina and i and we went to the hyatt. at the hyatt we proceded to have dinner which we ordered off stone tablets....<b>kinda</b>

our reason for visiting the hyatt was to attend a wedding or a ....anything. we got dressed up kinda...well enough to fit in...IN TO ANY SITUATION. we almost registered for a law convention...but it sounded dull.


anyway! after dinner we told the waiter that it was dina's birthday...at first we felt like we were being all sneaky...but then we realized that hers really was yesterday. so we got the most awesomest dessert for FREE.

<u>it was awesome.</u>

<big>i had SO much fun. thanks guys.</big>

we took advantage of all the other NOW free movies (as we often do) and moviehopped to see dirty dancing: havana nights...which was the only movie we hadn't seen, well except for PASSION OF THE CHRIST, and i'm not in to seeing christ movies...especially not like all mel gibson-y...hes like i know what women want...and ahhh! there are chicken and they run, and i guess, a few others...haha

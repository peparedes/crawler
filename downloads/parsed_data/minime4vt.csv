"event","7 weeks of the first semester are down.  35 days of school in the books.  Many memorable moments have already been made.  

Let's start off with band camp.  We get together the wednesday before classes start and make music and get to know each other.  I am fairly certain i met every single rookie and attempted to make small talk with them as well.  On top of meeting some great people, and being more extroverted than i had been the previous two years, espn the magazine came and did a GREAT job with an article about the marching virginians.  If you ever want to see it, let me know, i have a copy or two!  Classes then start and things are great.  

Our first game ws on September 1 against ECU.  It wasn't pretty, but pregame was excellent and we came out on top.  The following thursday, a small band known as the Dave Matthews Band came and gave us some free music.  He brought Phil Vassar, Nas, and John Mayer.  Excellent.  I bought a second ticket for a friend that i hadn't even seen all summer because of this and that, and when i finally got word on getting that second ticket, she was unable to ask off of work.  bummer.  Saturday, september 8.  VT at LSU.  i made 7 layer bean dip, gene made french onion dip, and greg made beef and cheese dip, we had a ton of people over, and we all consoled each other as the hokies got crushed by the tigers.  It's cool though.  

fast forward to after game 6 and we are now 5 and 1, and one game away from being bowl eligible again!  Lots of questions to be asked yet of this football team, but there are several games left down the road that may just answer those questions.  this past weekend i went to clemson with my cousin and two of his friends.  earlier in the semester i stated i would hang out with another good friend of mine, and after committing towards buying the ticket, was reminded that clemson weekend was the same time that friend would be in.  I really apologize to that friend.  It was totally my fault, but i have a feeling they may have done the same if there was a bigger game for their respective school, and just because i was gone for saturday doesn't mean i wasn't available sunday afternoon and monday all day, even for lunch or something.  

back to the trip.  it was great.  brian picked me up at around 730 on saturday morning and the 4 of us crammed in his honda civic and road 5 hours to clemson.  we ended up tailgating with a girl from roanoke who is now at clemson, her parents and friends, and some other hokies too.  Obviously the game was great.  Beamerball was on top of things as we scored 17 in the first quarter, and 31 in the first half...leading up to a total of 41 for the game.  While we were in the nosebleed section, it was the hokie section and we were fortunate enough to be one row directly behind three other college-aged hokie fans (girls!!).  Two go to Tech and the other goes to Radford.  I definitely had a blast during the game being a fan and hanging out with awesome people in my cousin and the girls.  it makes me think more about what i want to do next year.  do i want to be a fan or be in the band?  i can't help but stop and remind myself that I have set goals in marching band that i have not yet achieved.  I want to obtain those goals, and the only way to do so is to stick it out for the last year.  i loved this road trip, but eyes on the prize...

Now my token girl section.
Freshman.  Trumpet/Music Major.  Blonde.  Goofball.  What else can I ask for in a girl?  We clicked from pretty much day one.  Turns out through auditions i sit next to her in wind ensemble too.  I haven't looked too hard for a girl in college, because i haven't cared to date while in college yet.  Then she came along.  I couldn't sit back and watch THIS one get by like i may have in the past.  I jumped on it and asked her for a date.  i kind of got the hint that maybe i was a bit fast in asking about dating, so we agreed that we should hang out with the potential of dating.  At least she knows matt bartley is interested in her.  That was where i stood as of september 14.  The next third of the story goes until october 1.  between the 14th and the 1st we have not hung out ONCE.  turns out i ask people for their time at in-opportune times.  Always when she was too tired or too busy with homework.  Then last week, october 1, someone shared gossip with me.  I hear rumors that she pulled an all nighter with someone, and i don't mean studying.  i don't want to jump on anything too soon but If she goes for a guy that enjoys 40 races and being a big bag of douche, i am ready to drop her like a bad habit.  if she has no morals, there's no way i want to associate myself with her.  i've been told that down the road they figure out what's right and what's not.  until then, if that's the kind of girl she is, i'm not going to give her my time.  the problem is: how do you figure out if that's more than just gossip?  isn't it kind of weird asking someone about that???  i just dont' know...

haha so about every 6 months i write a mile-long journal.  hope you enjoy.  i'm very open for input!!"

"event","Before I start, this is a disclaimer to everyone whose home for the summer was larger than a 60 mile radius of roanoke. I am not pointing fingers at you. You are not included in this. sometimes distance is a separating factor that becomes harder to overcome than even i realized. i deeply apologize to anyone who has already read this and took it differently than i intended, but appreciate and respect her concern, and thank her for the wake up call that required me to write this as a disclaimer.  this was also written, copied and pasted from a few days ago, so since i the summer went by so fast anyways, you guys who graciously slipped in time for me are not included as well.


You know what grinds my gears? When people make commitments and don't follow through with them. For example:
""I will call you this week""
""We will DEFINITELY hang out this week""
""We will hang out as soon as things settle down, I promise""
""we'll get together, I promise""
""I'll give you a call tomorrow""
I believe the point is getting across. If not, then you are totally ignorant. These are all direct quotes from multiple people over the summer time. You'd be surprised at how many people promised they would make time and those who actually followed through with it. A big thanks to Rachel Stidham (for making maggie moo's plans and not backing out on me for a movie) and Sarah Houff (Willy Wonka!!! haha) for that. But here's the deal, if you don't want to hang out, can't find time, don't lead someone on by saying you will! It's not fair to that person. Especially the busy excuse. I apologize that my summer job had a regular schedule and i was available nearly EVERY weeknight this summer, and that after a few times of contact I backed off and gave you space, so as not to be irritating. I think my dad put it best when he said ""you realize who your real friends are by the end of the summer"". well guess what friends? After tonight I have two more nights in vinton. what are you going to do about it? nothing. thanks for being the wonderful loyal friends i've always wanted. i'm glad that high school, and even middle school created lasting memories between us that we can hang out so much while we're home from college. i'm about 2 more sparks from being able to burn the bridges between me and some people so i never have to look back. fortunately i'm a forgiving person, but i can never forget how many times i had been left in the dust this summer.

let me also say that i am NOT mad at anyone, i'm upset with actions. while i'm saying this, i also want to point out i am even less disturbed by the ones who never promised a call or plans to begin with. you have been the most honest. promises are coupled with dependability. if you are not dependable, don't make promises."

"event","in a series/league whatever you want to call it, jeff gordon has really achieved the unattainable.  with the win today, he has passed one of the greatest drivers in nascar, dale earnhardt,  for career wins(77).  nascar in its earlier years was a league that had maybe 3 or 4 drivers that were real competitors.  now the competition has become MUCH more leveled, and there are many more drivers capable of winning week in and week out. Jeff also has more than twice as many wins as anyone else on the circuit (Rusty Wallace, 34), and is second place to Darrell Waltrip (84) in the modern cup era(1972).  love him or hate him, it will be hard to find another driver in the future of nascar as dominant as jeff gordon."

"event","i don't know.  i feel like it happens almost every year.  i just feel like right now, there aren't many people in my life that would truly consider me a friend.  i expected to see and hang out with way more people over break.  not including the bowl trip and the wedding i went to, i hung out with two people more than once and felt like an actual contribution and a reason that hanging out was possible.  how come people are fine with bringing me along with a big group, yet when i mention a one on one or just a few people kinda opportunity, people freeze and never get back to me.  what am i doing (or not doing).  so at home, like i said, it's been two people.  thanks a LOT to those two.  you mean a lot to me and you both always have.  

what about my college friends?  i don't know.  at all.    thanks to the stalking ability of facebook, my ""group"" at college found a weekend to get together at one of their houses and hang out.  everyone that i have dedicated easily at least 95% of my time to was there.  not including peyden and justin, there isn't anyone at tech even CLOSE to these guys.  and it's not that i feel like i am the most disconnected of the group that was there either, because i don't believe that's true at all.  i know i shouldn't complain, and it's not that i'm asking for people to leave me comments saying ""well i love you"", because it's far from it.  i just hope someone will hear me out i guess.  maybe my purpose is that if you see this, i am geniunely bothered and for you guys to know it.  

not saying i'm not friends with you guys and that anything has been hurt because of what you did.  it's a two way thing and i know i haven't held up to my half of many friendships over break either, but i feel like i have worked hard enough and gone enough out of my way in the past year to at least be included on the get together.

maybe i should just get a job and not have time for friends.  that way i can spend all the money i want on my car and maybe pay off a few dollars of the large debts i'll have when i leave college

on the positive side.  this is the first woe is me journal i have posted on livejournal that isn't about the generic girl that i am crazy about that only sees me as a friend.  i still haven't found a girl that i consider ""date-able"" that would give me the time of day, but apparently that should be the least of my worries at the moment anyways"

"event","oh boy...so the past 2 days has been full of marching virginians stuff...trying out, fundamentals, the works...WELL this year there are a TON of trumpets that are gonna get cut!  like 81 or so people and 63 spots.  well the thing IS that 40 of those 80some are freshman...and they will be cut before others would obviosuly, so pretty much half of the freshmen will be cut...they're ALL good here too!! i mean i don't see anything to make me better than the ones on the other side of me, and i can possibly pick out a few things that would hurt me!  so we'll see...i'm just stressed out about it, cuz everyone knows i'm a die-hard hokie and a band kid too, so obviously i've wanted to be in the marching band since i remember!  i know if for some reason i DON'T make it, i can try to be a manager and try out again next year, but that's not cool!! i want to march with my sister again and do all the marching stuff, not stand around and do crap for 330 people...soo i'm hoping when i see the list of cuts tomorrow, i will be on the side of the 63 people...but we'll see...

and if you were wondering i'm having a blast up here...just not when i think about the possibility of being cut...that's all..."

"event","oookay...soo i haven't done one since graduation haha that's always good!  looks like i have a lot to say don't I?

senior week at lake anna-awesome...that's pretty much the main thing about that...it was me, greg, scott, and laura and we had a great time just hanging out, swimming, and wakeboarding (or trying to laura lol)...but i think i made the right decision between it and senior week and i doubt i'd see the lake anna people as much as the ppl that i woulda gone to the beach with after this summer...soo good choice

movies-i've actually only seen two in theater so far (1)Batman and (2)Wedding Crashers
   Batman is a great action movie and is my fav. of all of the batmans, but i haven't really seen the others in a while though, so i don't know
   Wedding Crashers is a funny movie...kinda a meet the parents on steroids and with boobs...but it had a good storyline and was just a fun movie

girls-well yeah i haven't really looked into that too much during the summer...i mean there's a few that i wish i could get closer to, but i think that since i'll be gone in like a month for college, it's not a good idea to get into it too much...but at the same time i feel like i'm missing out on it if i don't...but if i did try, like i'd actually get someone that i was thinking of...and just saying getting close doesn't necessarily mean dating, so i'm not saying that, but i guess i would hope for it to be that...so there's THAT dilemma

lake-haven't been as much as i've wanted...and it doesn't look like i'll be going too many more times this summer either...but i want to get down there and just have some fun...there's gonna be a wakeboarding tournament on aug. 6th at smith mtn lake...a few ppl can go with me if they want and it's pretty much an all day, but you're (whoever) invited

the rest of the summer-pretty much the only concrete thing on my plate for the rest of the summer is that me, brad, and scott are going to miami on the 30th and we get back on the 4th...i don't know what's going on down there, but whatever we do, i'm sure we'll have a blast

yeah but i think i'm done for now...hope that satisfies peoples' need to hear about my ""interesting"" life...don't know when i'll do this again, but here's a good one for right now...later"

"event","Idea of a Friend


In kindergarten your idea of a good friend was the person who let you have the red crayon when all that was left was the ugly black one. 

In first grade your idea of a good friend was the person who went to the bathroom with you and held your hand as you walked through the scary halls. 

In second grade your idea of a good friend was the person who helped you stand up to the class bully. 

In third grade your idea of a good friend was the person who shared their lunch with you when you forgot yours on the bus. 

In fourth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who was willing to switch square dancing partners in gym so you wouldn't have to be stuck do-si-do-ing with Nasty Nicky or Smelly Susan. 

In fifth grade your idea of a friend was the person who saved a seat on the back of the bus for you. 

In sixth grade your idea of a friend was the person who went up to Nick or Susan, your new crush, and asked them to dance with you, so that if they said no you wouldn't have to be embarrassed. 

In seventh grade your idea of a friend was the person who let you copy the social studies homework from the night before that you had. 

In eighth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who helped you pack up your stuffed animals and old baseball cards so that your room would be a ""high schooler's"" room, but didn't laugh at you when you finished and broke out into tears. 

In ninth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who went to that ""cool"" party thrown by a senior so you wouldn't wind up being the only freshman there. 

In tenth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who changed their schedule so you would have someone to sit with at lunch. 

In eleventh grade your idea of a good friend was the person who gave you rides in their new car, convinced your parents that you shouldn't be grounded, consoled you when you broke up with Nick or Susan, and found you a date to the prom. 

In twelfth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who helped you pick out a college, assured you that you would get into that college, helped you deal with your parents who were having a hard time adjusting to the idea of letting you go. 

At graduation your idea of a good friend was the person who was crying on the inside but managed the biggest smile one could give as they congratulated you. 

The summer after twelfth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who helped you clean up the bottles from that party, helped you sneak out of the house when you just couldn't deal with your parents, assured you that now that you and Nick or you and Susan were back together, you could make it through anything, helped you pack up for college and just silently hugged you as you looked through blurry eyes at 18 years of memories you were leaving
behind, and finally on those last days of childhood, went out of their way to come over and send you off with a hug, a lot of memories, reassurance that you would make it in college as well as you had these past 18 years, and most importantly sent you off to college knowing you were loved. 

Now, your idea of a good friend is still the person who gives you the better of the two choices, holds your hand when you're scared, helps you fight off those who try to take advantage of you, thinks of you at times when you are not there, reminds you of what you have forgotten, helps you put the past behind you but understands when you need to hold on to it a little longer, stays with you so that you have confidence, goes out of their way to make time for you, helps you clear up your mistakes, helps you deal with pressure from others, smiles for you when they are sad, helps you become a better person, and most importantly loves you!

so thank you to all of those who have been a friend to me in any stage of my life...like the person i got this from said, people come into your life, make their mark on it, and leave...i want to keep in touch with as many of those people as possible, but i will never forget any of them"

"event","okay well it's been a good while since i've done this thing, so here it goes again...all i really have to talk about is prom and the band trip...other than that i really haven't been up to all that much!

okay well prom was really cool...i went with someone from northside and had a great time...i don't know if i can say the same for her cuz i suck at this kinda thing since i am a shy kid at talking and i'm not that big on dancing...but i still had fun and i just want her to know how thankful i am that she went with me!!

now the band trip was only like 4 days after prom...so already on not enough sleep, we left on wednesday night at 9 and went all the way thru the night
  we ate at burger king on thurs morning and then made it to gainesville and the univ. of florida where we had a music clinic with danny galyen, who used to teach at northside and is the oldest of the 3 galyens...then we ate and hung out there and left for cocoa beach not long after...we made it there and to holiday inn, unpacked and then went to some family fun center with go-carts, putt-putt, rock climbing, and an arcade...that was fun...my dad's cousin who lives in florida came and talked to me and my rents while we were there...then we went back to the hotel and hung out on the beach but it was dark so we just kinda stood there...well everyone left but a few and to make a long story shorter, a chaparone accused me of taking pics of 2 of the chicks topless w/ my digital cam...but i didn't take any pics and they weren't topless...but she told mrs c and my dad and i got my cam taken away for the night and they took the chicks' cams to get them developed soon...that story will be continued later
  now on friday we went to universal studios...chris was my riding partner and we did everything except terminator 3-d so not too bad...but then we went back to the hotel and i decided not to go to the beach that night cuz of what went on the night before
  saturday was a more laid back day and we went to the beach in the morning...during this time my dad took the film to a cvs to get them developed so mrs. c could look at them...but then we went to the florida mall, then medieval times, and then ron jon's surf shop and i was really really excited about that one cuz i've been there before and i bought a lotta stuff from there...but the pics were looked at and nothing came out so my dad talked to the chaparone that accused me of it to get her to apologize since i was hurt about it making it around the band and she's a bitch so she didn't really apologize..she said she tried to keep it quiet but my dad was so loud about it and all this crap and she apologized that it happened the way it did, but she still believes i took bad pics but i didn't and she's just upset to admit she's WRONG HAHAHAHAHAHA what now?!?!
  sunday we left cocoa beach for good and went to islands of adventure...once again chris was my riding buddy...we did mostly everything there too and had a lotta fun...we had on matching ""models wanted"" shirts on and it was fun to see reactions (what do you need models for?-have you gotten any responses yet?-nice shirt! etc.) but yeah i guess that's all of that day...and we went home straight from the park...found a rest stop to change and we were off

now i'm not a big advocate of talking about things/people...but first off i'm glad i'll never have to see that god-awful chaparone lady again!  that was the only hint of drama and it involved a chaparone...how wrong!  but then there were several couples that got together/are much much closer and i have to admit that one makes me a bit jealous but life goes on...i wish you all that got together on a band trip hook-up the best haha...

but now back to school and only 2 more regular days then exams start and i only have to take one exam and i get out early on friday...on fri. night i plan on seeing my buds at lb graduate and then on saturday i'm going to the wakeboarding festival at smith mtn lake...i was gonna be in it but i haven't wakeboarded at all this year so not a good idea haha...but umm i guess that's about it soo i'll be talking to y'all later!!

monday-ehh i don't remember...it was rainy, so i prob slept and stuff...all of the water sometimes floods our basement and this rain was no different, so yeah umm it smells bad now...but we've been letting it air out so i guess it's getting better...

tuesday-ran around the neighborhood and my legs were killing me afterwards...i live on a big hill so i'm either running up or down and not flat so it's as much a workout on my legs as anything else...maybe next time i'll go to the cemetary down the hill...it's flatter and prob better for me at the time...but umm after that i took a shower and went to the mall for a while...bought with honors at fye (good movie, not many have seen it) and a wakeboarding magazine at hollister (it's the april one and like a dollar cheaper so i like getting it from there)...saw some hot chicks so that's always fun!  then i went to best buy and bought a N.E.R.D. cd...lol it's got that song from the video clip w/ bs's old dog lol...but neways yeah then i came home and applied for best buy and circuit city online

today (wednesday)-didn't do much this morning except watch the price is right, then after lunch i mowed the lawn and i had more time so i decided to vacuum my car and mess w/ things inside of it...i re-organized all of the wires for my lights to make it a little easier to stay hidden in there and messed w/ the controls on my amp to make my sub sound better (and it does) then it was dinner time...hung out more and watched the nightly game shows haha..took a shower and practiced trumpet then i got a call from morgan...she said she and kaitlin were coming over so they came and hung out for like 20 minutes...first people that i've been around during the break

i have two things on my mind right now...a job and prom

job-just to let you know i don't need a job for gas money or me money, i'm going to use this and stick it straight in my savings account just to get a few extra bucks for college...i have a few thing that i have found right now and none of them are really sticking out...putt-putt is hiring and they start off at 5.50, only drawback is location but i don't hafta pay for gas and that looks fun..the guy said they are really flexible w/ hours and will give you what you want so that's good.  oh and i want to add that my dad does business with the owner manager guy so that's a plus...then kroger, it's also 5.50...doesn't seem AS fun as putt-putt, but closer.  i want to add that my aunt and the head guy there taught together and were really close so that's also a plus.....then the random way out there ideas include best buy, circuit city (prob wont get a job at either one), chuck e cheese, home depot, and some place called vector...but i don't understand what they do lol so i'm not sure...so that's what i have right now...i'm leaning towards putt putt and i'm gonna call them tomorrow to hopefully set something up

prom-NO idea at all...i guess that famous parking space quote applies to prom dates too (all the good ones are taken) i have no idea, so umm we'll see what goes on with that...i kinda know someone, but i'm too shy to ask and i don't think we know each other well enough neways...my ideal date is still that chick i haven't talked to in a year haha (go figure) and i don't know how to get in touch w/ her...so it saddens me...haha and then someone else that is a WAY OUT THERE idea is some northside chick...from band things, ya kinda get to know other band kids and she's cool...her name is maggie too!!(good name)  but that would be too random, at least i actually hung out w/ shannon

so for the rest of spring break, i only have like 2 plans for the rest of the time and they both go together..tomorrow night i'm rehearsing w/ glenvar's jazz band from 6-8 cuz they need a few trumpets cuz some of them realized they had some conflicts on sat night...then on sat i go to that area again at some church and glenvar's band is doing a spaghetti dinner, from 4-5 i eat and from 5-7 i play...this should be interesting...clue is playing there too and he goes to northside haha but we'll see how all that goes...aight but i'm gonna head on out now...you guys have a good rest of the break!!! talk to y'all later"

"event","just want to add...even though things have happened already...that that person was way better after that one night...it's not that she's always loud an annoying cuz that's not the case, she's really cool...but i tend to take things more personal than most and it annoyed me when it was things that i couldn't help...but she's really cool and don't think badly of her cuz i think a lot of her...aight i'm done"

"event","yeah well what's shakin you guys?  what it's been like a week and a half right?  yeah well these past few weeks have definately been better ones for me...they have been busy, but very fun...we did our first week of easter pageant performance last week (wed-fri all at 7, sat 2 and 7, sun 7) and i had to show up like an hour and a half early for make-up and notes and just hanging out and getting ready and such so not much of an afternoon, but i got to be with some really cool people so not a problem.  well actually yeah a problem.  there's one person in the youth group that's in the easter pageant and thinks it's fun to point out everything i do that's funny to her and laugh about it...usually not a problem, but first you have to hear and see her laugh (VERY loud and VERY dramatic) and then you have to count how many times it happened (a few times a night, a few times too much), then you have to add the parts when it's mentioned and laughed about later (each time i do something she laughs at)...so i didn't appreciate that and it really takes me away from the main reason i'm in the easter pageant so hopefully this won't happen during the last 4 performances we have cuz it's taken all that i have in me not to go off...but neways...

sunday was very busy...had church till 1130 then of course we got out later and ya never get out of the parking lot at 1130 lol but i had to be at calvary baptist (downtown) at 1230 so i had mcdonald's on the way there and rehearsed...then i went straight to youth symphony which started at 2 and lasted till 5 then went straight back to my church for the performance...fun stuff..VERY BUSY...now during all of this i was catching a cold too...so not feeling very good!

monday-tuesday stayed at home, watched lots of tv (Ray is a good movie, so is Out Cold) and on monday on the price is right, both contestants over-bid(ed?) on the final showcase so neither one won...made me mad lol but yeah i went to see doc this morning who told me to keep takin the over-the-counters stuff i've been takin and i'll be good...and came back for physics and statistics...missed the fire yesterday!  then had a dentist appt today at 4 where i got 2 fillings and that wasn't fun...the novocaine needle caught my tongue and numbed that so i had a problem eating dinner...then i just kinda hung out after dinner, played my trumpet for the first time since sunday(never doing that again) and still had problems playing it cuz i can't stop coughing! but it'll get better...i hope...

okay so last night i got this e-mail from va tech and it said they had made a decision on my admission into tech and all and i could visit the website to view the decision...but it wouldn't let me sign in for some reason for a while i just had to keep refreshing and finally i got in and it said i was accepted!!! yay...i got my letter today with all that fun stuff in it...but it's really exciting that i get to go up there where i've wanted to be forever and get to be w/ my sister, sarah davis, leah cassell, justin knicely and all the other ones that are goin too...and sarah houff is going to radford so she won't be far away...so i'm excited about that...but i need to work really hard on these scholarships and do my best to get what i can and what i can earn with a job too so it'll be easier on the rents...gotta know it's hard with one kid, imagine two kids in college!  but i'm sure everything will turn out fine in the end and the way it's supposed to be...as long as i get to be a hokie i'm happy!!

aight i'm done now...reminder-if you are bored, my church is still doing their easter pageant this weekend thurs or fri at 7 and sat at 2 or 7!! we have padded the amt of tickets we give out for those who come w/o them...please come!!"

"event","aight well like i said in the last one, i wrote it all yesterday but then when i clicked update it went to a new page saying it couldn't do it...then cuz of that it lost everything i wrote so i'll try again...

first off i want to say again that what i wrote yesterday doesn't mean that i hate their physical being and want them to die...i actually like them...outside of band...but since they hate band and mrs. c. it's just difficult for me, as a band kid and someone who wants to do this with my life, that they are like that and that's where i'm coming from

aight well anyways...last week/this weekend was fun...my church is right in the heat of the easter pageant rehearsals (still tickets for the 16th, 17th, and 24th call 977-5701) and those always get difficult but it's all good...then on friday we had a mandatory band practice after school that went well, cept it was right during the va tech b-ball game which i didn't really miss much of anyways lol but then that evening my mom and i went to the wynton marsalis concert (he's a freakin awesome trumpet player) and he did jazz stuff...not my favorite music, but there's no denying his skills!

saturday was festival day...got to school and there were TONS of cars there, went inside and to my luck it was a VOLLEYBALL TOURNAMENT!! yeah dude that's right it was a great start to the morning...got on the bus and turned around to see one of those volleyball chicks puking her guts out then my thoughts moved to geez today's gonna be bad...sat with the normal bus buddy (maggie) and had my normal drink on the way up (grape gatorade...the BIG bottles)...we got there and got the SUPERIOR (refer to below entry)...on the way home had some interesting convos...they were pretty weird at times and really really weird at others (that's all i can/have to say about that)...but then we got home and a few people went to denny's but i didn't go cuz i called my rents and they said they had planned for me and were making food soo yeah..went home and i wanted to find something longer to do that evening anyways...but i didn't...so i went home and played video games and looked online and found the best buy site w/ digital cameras and stuff...at 8 at night i asked my rents if i could go to best buy ""to look around"" and they both wanted to go with me (suspicious)...found a camera i liked and the guy gave us a deal on the model before it but exact same camera..only thing was it was on display and didn't come w/ a box, neck strap, or lens cap but i ordered those things for the camera and it's still way cheaper than what it would be w/ the other camera so i'm happy!

sunday-church...youth symphony and it was only me and abby (3rd and 4th chairs) and the jerks that play loud weren't there...mr glazebrook stopped everyone halfway through a song just to say ""this is the best trumpet balance we've had all year""...i wish i had a video cam or something so i could rub it in the faces of those 2 trumpet players!! yeah but oh well

monday-normal day at school...worked on scholarships and messed w/ camera when i got home...then off to church for pageant rehearsal...we did make-up and costumes tonight...i don't like lipstick or eyeliner!! lol (one more reason to come and see our pageant-me in make-up) then i got to use my camera on the ""angels"" who had those glasses w/ the nose and the hair and stuff..it was funny...which reminds me i think i'm gonna start that picture trail thing or whatever it is now that i have my own camera...but i'm done now...later"

just wanna say tho...we got superior woo!! in response to that, there were some people who don't like mrs c. and don't want to give her credit for anything..she made it so perc. couldn't play the ""cool stuff"" until they passed the scales on mallets off...WELL they never did cuz one told me ""they want the sucky players to do it so we suck at festival and make mrs. c. look bad cuz we don't want her to look good"" well three (or four) IN YOUR FACE(s) (bitch(es))...yeah you didn't want her to look good by not playing but instead, we got a superior and you weren't there so you can't get credit and because of the way you guys acted, it makes you look bad!! yeah that's right i said it...and i'm done"

"event","well hmm...i tried to do this last night, but something wasn't right and it wouldn't let me update it for some reason, and because of that, all of my writing got deleted which is not cool cuz it was a pretty long one that i stayed up later than i wanted to write anyways

friday-i was so glad it was finally friday because even though we missed two days from school, it felt way longer and i was just tried because of it all, so i was ready for the weekend...but i talked to justin about going to the car show and that my plans were to go on friday night and i asked him if he wanted to go w/ me, but the best i got out of him was ""i'm not sure""...so i talked to my dad and we went together...i don't know i think my dad was happier w/ what went on anyways lol...good father/son time and he knows more about those older nice cars than i or knicely do so that was kinda cool...saw a car i saw on monster garage and some other sweet cars too!

saturday-had to wake up early and go to easter pageant practice from 9-12..it was fun, but lots of the stuff we are doing this year is the stuff that we did last year, so it kinda gets old, but after all the practice, ya kinda realize what it means after the performances when you get to interact with people and hear how much they liked it, so in the end it's worth it...well i came home and ate lunch and while waiting to go to amber's surprise party, i fell asleep then woke up at about 3:30, so i didn't think it'd be right showing up that late if it ended at 4 lol (not the kinda surprise i'd want) but yeah sry amber..at least i helped by handing out invitations!  but then there was the tech game at 4 and that was good...hokies won and are 4th in the acc (awesome!-thank you to all the uva people who said we wouldn't win one game and we were not going to help contribute to basketball at all...and while i'm at it to the bandwagoners who don't have enough balls to lose a few more games and root for the same team all year round (pet peeve))-and i apologize for that, but for some reason it gets to me when i go to the tech/duke game and all these duke fans cheering and i can shut them up by asking what color shirt they wear during football season...anyways...after the game i wanted something to do and i was gonna call up leah (i love you don't take offense to that bandwagon thing) to hang out, but i called too late to begin with and didn't end up hanging out with her but it's all good cuz we'll make some time while she's in!  instead i went to blockbuster and rented mr 3000 which is a really good movie...if you like baseball just a little bit, you'll prob like this movie! good family time if anything

sunday-church then i had a uth symphony concert at smith mountain lake to expand the area of the symphony and stuff...got there early and was close enough to hit up the best board shop at the lake...got a cool shirt (my wakeboard brand) that i wore today (monday) but then the concert and there's a real idiot in the trumpet section...he's a sopho who made all state last year (didn't this year) and he's only got one dynamic...REALLY loud...did horn pops and stuff during his important parts, played MY cues...sits second chair in the symphony and won't listen to even mr glazebrook (the director) and it pisses us all off...on top of playing too loud and everything during the concert, he hasn't been to the last 5 practices before the concert, and he comes in and tells us what to do...jerk....but i came home and watched basketball, filled out that fafsa thing...that's about it

today was a normal day at school...nothing too exciting...trumpet lessons tonight went well...that's about it

okay well i had my i needa find a prom date story a few days ago...i'm gonna say it one more time...i NEED to find a prom date...my dad doesn't ask me much about girl stuff or push me for things, but on the way home from the car show he asked me if i've found a prom date yet (weird) and then we put our calendars together and he said he wouldn't miss seing me off for the prom for anything...well i don't know i guess i think it'd be kinda weird if i didn't have a date for him to see me off to...just getting stressful and i know i don't have much more time cuz then even the single chicks will start to get taken...i have like 2 ideas, but one goes to a different school and i can't tell if she has a b/f or not...then the other (this will be weird sounding)...there's a chick that went to our school last year and we totally hit it off..she was in a LOOONG distance relationship (california guy) and then she transferred back to where she came from which is still in the valley...i haven't really talked to her since she left, but i still miss her and regret it cuz she was one of the few people i felt really liked me...but i'm gonna have to jump on that and start hanging back out w/ her if i want that to happen..i'm just so nervous about talking to her again...we haven't talked in like a year...what would i say??? but yeah...i'll have something figured out...whatever happens is supposed to happen ya know???

"event","wow...hey you guys...i feel like it's been a while since i put anything on this...well it's always hard to start when you leave so much open so i don't know...i guess i'll start with hopefully my future-last monday i tried out for the music dept. at Va Tech...well on tuesday (i think) i got a letter back from them saying i passed the entry audition...so that's good news...wasn't all that surprising but still good...but the hard part is the wait to see if i made it into the actual college and then i'll be happy...the admissions dept. is more important to me than the music one!! but i don't have worries cuz i know that whatever happens is where i'm led to be for the next year...if i get to go to blacksburg or if i stay here in Roanoke, i'm meant to be wherever and as long as i understand that when i get that letter i'm all good!

well hmm i guess a big part of this journal was chick stuff...two of the ones i liked are happily with someone and i highly support one of them and i still have questions about the other one...i sent her an e-mail asking why all of a sudden things changed and stuff...no reply...still to nervous to even i/m her for some reason (i'm just like that) and i asked around and i was told that she was deciding between me and someone else and she decided the other one...i don't know...i think i woulda felt better with myself if she straight up told me that instead of makin the other excuses especially if one of em was a straight up lie (i don't want a b/f right now) but it's all good...
i'm still in the hunt...not as desperately or painfully or however i went about it last time-but i don't know it always seems like nothing's ever good enough for me and i don't understand why i can't just take someone for who they are and not listen to what other people have to say...i think about my chick situations a lot and i passed up a great person cuz of what i thought my friends would think...but then i look and realize that the ones i thought would say stuff prob talk about me behind my back too so it's not like it's important...but whatever...if the opportunity comes back again i'll do my best to actually take advantage of it but i understand if it doesn't cuz i was a jerk at the time...but whatever...there's plenty of chicks in the valley there's gotta be one that i could hang out w/...
on the same lines i'm lookin for a prom date-any suggestions? you know where to get reach me

aight well today was great...kinda tiring during school but nothing hard, my grade on a stat test was better than i thought it was...came home for a little then we had a band concert tonight and somehow we didn't totally blow it and i don't know how we didn't but it was good!! then the fairly normals went to denny's and chilled out for a while and it was fun there!!  i love camera phones...they provide lots of entertainment lol!! well yeah but i guess that's it for now...later guys!"

"event","alrighty i think it's been awhile since i've done one of these...but that's cool...let's see...first off i am trying out for va tech's music stuff a week from today...not all that nervous about it but i DO needa work on arpeggios...umm also it's obviously valentine's day and that wasn't fun but oh well i got a grand total of 4 cards from four great people (sarah h., bentley, kaley, and kendra) i don't know it's stupid of me, but even those simple little cards made my day, even if i don't believe in valentine's day!  i don't know i guess it just reminds me that there are a few people that will take even the smallest amount of time out of their day to even think of me so i guess that's why...then after school i had to go to the dentist and that wasn't fun cuz i need a filling in a month (apparently it wasn't anything i did/didn't do either so i guess that's good)...and then we met my dad at my favorite place in the world to eat..dj's...for a ""special"" dinner and we haven't had anything that spiffy in a LOOOONG time so i was happy...had some time to kill so i went to staples and looked at digital cameras and found one i like and will consider (http://www.staples.com/Catalog/Browse/Sku.asp?PageType=1&Sku=564921) then i had trumpet lessons which went well...jeff said i was ready for auditions but to play scales w/ arpeggios till my ears can play it which doesn't sound like much fun at all...but yeah that was pretty much my day

this weekend we went on a ski trip...i invited chris gardner to go with me since he likes to snowboard a lot and the group had tons of fun with him...that's what's so cool about him...no matter who you put him with, he's gonna make sure everyone has a fun time...but we left on friday evening and stayed overnight at the jmu bsu then showed up at massanutten early for skiing..we were some of the first on the slopes that day so it was exciting...but i didn't hang out with chris cuz he's way better than me...i hung out with whitney clark and we're about even on board-ability so we had fun together...ride home was mainly checking out the ring tones on snow's cell phone yeah that's right it lasted us like 2 hours!

on sunday i had church then youth symphony then more church and then had to write like 7 pages for a report that had only 3 done before then and was due today...i got it done though and i got plenty of sleep too

well there's a BIG issue on my hands right now...i have a few friends that want me to go with them to senior week and they're awesome and i know i'll love being there...but also the same week there's something that the seniors at our church do...we all go to lake anna and hang out for a week and that's cool too...i am leaning way more towards the lake thing because the two main people going to lake anna thing are going farther away for college...knicely and sarah are going to tech and radford, i'd prob be rooming with knicely and we'd visit sarah a lot so i mean i think we'd have plenty of time with each other anyways...i'm just worried that they're not gonna have anything to do if i don't go with them, cuz splitting the cost would be much tougher...we'll see what goes on in the next week or so but as of now i think i wanna go to lake anna

since it's valentine's day: Love is patient, love is kind.  It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.  It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.  Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.  It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.  (1 Corinth. 13:4-7)

Somewhere Out There from An American Tale
Somewhere out there,
beneath the pale moonlight,
someone's thinking of me and loving me tonight.

Somewhere out there,
someone's saying a prayer,
that we'll find one another in that big somewhere out there.

And even though I know how very far apart we are,
it helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star.

And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby,
it helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky.

Somewhere out there,
if love can see us through,
then we'll be together, somewhere out there,
out where dreams come true."

"event","Aight well if you don't know, there's a guy on the tech football team named Justin Hamilton.  As a sophomore he was a receiver and had some awesome hand, and last year was a running back and did well in the first games until humes and imoh came back and he was thrown from first to third string, and next year he'll be a corner...or safety...not sure which but either way he's switching again and he was interviewed saying it was hard sometimes having to be a back-up and stuff like that...soo just being the stupid tech fan i am and with the time i had, i just said what the hey and sent him my e-mail:

I just wanted to say that I read the article about you on the Bill 
Roth report on hokiesports.com, and it motivated me to send this.  I just want 
to say that as a member of the Hokie Nation, you are a very respectable person and I am proud you represent my team.  I know you guys like to play, but it's 
always good to hear about an athlete of your ability that is also a team 
player.  So to make this e-mail shorter than it could be, I want to wish you 
the best of luck in the upcoming months and during the remainder of your time 
at Virginia Tech.  I hope for you that you will accomplish your goals on and 
off the field, and thanks for representing this great school in the way that 
you do.

well that was sent on January 14...today (Feb 7) he replied...

What's up Matt,

First of all, thanks a lot for the thoughtful e-mail.  This past year was 
definitely a trying time for me but it was also a period of adversity very 
similar to situations that almost all successful athletes must go through.  It 
is great to have the support of so many local people like you; as an athlete I 
can honestly say it is that support that keeps us going.

I apologize for taking so long to reply to you, but please know that your 
e-mail was appreciated and is also a means of motivation and inspiration for 
me.  With the wonderful fan support I've received, I once again have the fire 
burning inside of me that is a necessity for success.

Good luck with your school and athletics if you play sports.  Thanks again for 
the e-mail and go Hokies!

Thanks again,
Justin Hamilton

"event","aight well yeah things this weekend were good and also bad...

good: honor band was this weekend...it was a good thing to get away from the stuff that's been going on and just hang out with laid back people that don't care...got me some nice VT gloves for the ski trip and other random winter things and that was definately good since i didn't have gloves before it...but yeah things in blacksburg were fun...also the snow day on monday was wonderful because i caught up on a lot of sleep

bad:obviously still dwelling on chick things...my audition sucked so i got a lower chair than i wanted but i was still in the high band...
when i came home on sunday i watched the falcons game and that wasn't exactly pretty and then my dad also broke the news that he put our dog to sleep while i was away...he did the same 5 or so years ago with our cat, when i was on a mission trip and i didn't like that too much...

i like the comment the last person (jimmydeansausage) put on my last journal...it is something way different than what i've ever heard and i want to try from that way...no more feeling sorry for myself about girls...more confidence and less whining...more thought anyways and she liked me a long time but i never really did anything about it and that let her get away from me so it's not all her fault...mine too it's all good

another funny story...today i was told that someone and his g/f were busy over the break...well he's in my stat class and i was like ""four times, huh?"" and the teacher asked ""four times what?"" and we both said ""four"" at the exact same time it was hilarious...yet sad that i thought on the same wavelength as him haha but it's all good and it gave us some laughs for a while after it...good times

but anyways i guess that's it...buest of luck to all you kids with significant others...no hard feelings"

"event","okay...well here's another chick update for ya...i'm gonna go for the whole story now...
the date is december 30 and I send one of them an e-mail...i was getting worried about us not talking so i asked her what's going on? and i said that the more this went on the more i realized i like her...well she said she doesn't want a boyfriend right now and that the age difference is a problem...well fast-forward to january 20...i am here talkin to her about the basketball game and she said she wasn't there cuz she was at her boyfriend's game...WRONG?!?  i think so...i mean, i know eventually things go on, but she stopped talking to me a while before it and it was so all of a sudden and it was less than 3 weeks from the time she said that and i'm willing to guess that they have been goin out for a bit now...it's just so annoying and it pisses me off how i get SCREWED OVER time and time again and i cannot stand it so it's killin me and every time i believe things are beginning to go my way, something like this happens...i am very bothered by what happened and i hope she feels like crap for doin that to me...i don't care if i ever like a chick again cuz chances are i'll get led on and then dropped off...so fine whatever good luck and i'm a sore loser"

"event","aight well know my girl issues?  they've kinda solved themselves...well the one i was thinking of aiming for got a boyfriend over the break i'm assuming, well the fact is she's got a boyfriend now and that really isn't a problem because i think the person she's with is a cool person so it's hard to be upset over that...then there was the one i was worried about age and location and such and after i talked with her some, (just as i was getting over the age issue) she was starting to be more uncomfortable by the age thing so yeah and i can't argue about that much either cuz i used to question the same issue with her...just kinda funny how when i'm getting over that she's getting into it...and then i'm not sure about the other..i'm just thinkin that i probably misunderstood her enough that i came through as some kinda ignorant person and i apologize for that
 
the funny thing about that last one was that i was most worried about what my friends would think because i really like them and they hold strong opinions, but over the break, two of them hung out with me or even bothered to call me and one of them goes to a different school and the other one is just laid back enough that it doesn't matter anyways...so basically what i was getting at through all of that was that my break sucked and i didn't know where my friends were and i apologize to that person for how badly i interpret my friends

okay so then i come back to school and all yesterday and it sucks just cuz it's the first day and i got my stat grade and was told i'm two tenths away from a b, exactly like last 9 weeks and that pisses me off cuz i work hard in there and get worse grades than that laid back kid who does nothing and does way better...then obviously the tech game last night where the newspaper but it the best by saying ""all of a sudden the magic was gone"" but hey at least it was a quality team that went through possibly the hardest conference in the ncaa undefeated and we lost by 3 and left at least 10 points on the field so i'm content...at least no cavs can say anything...but then today...grr government makes me soo mad...we have written a ton of papers and i've gotten respectable grades on some, then she hands like 3 back today and they're all d minus or lower and it made me mad cuz i did the same exact stuff on my other papers and it was fine...but i guess all i can do is correct them and hope she gets ""amnesia"" like she said she would...then there was a fire drill and i try to hang out w/ a few people in a circle kinda thing and one of them steps in front of me, cutting me out and i'm not sure if that was intentional or not, but it was cool cuz bentley came over and she's always nice...it's just funny how my day goes cuz one moment i'm happy and hyper and the next i'm not, but i guess that's life...i enjoy walking to my classes and lunch and stuff with knicely...he's a cool guy and i think a lot of him...hopefully i'll make it into tech cuz we agreed that we would room together and i know i wouldn't have a problem with that

sooo i don't know...many questions in my head...some are stupid and some are reasonable and hopefully as things play out, they will turn out stupid...i don't try to hurt peoples feelings or anything like that so nobody please take it that way...i just want to try and say what's goin on inside my head and hope people can understand me better cuz i think one of my problems is that i don't think people understand me...but oh well...that's it for now"

"event","well guys...it's that time of year again...Christmas has finally come...I know i'm not usually the one to express the way I feel, but it's something i heard from my pastor and it was just nifty and i totally agree...i can't say it quite the way he can, but i can hopefully get the point across:

christmas has become soo comercialized that we forget to realize that beyond the presents and the trees and santa, there is a bigger present, the one God sent to us on that clear night...his name was Jesus and he came to save us from our sins...there are two main figures during Christmas...one is Jesus and the other one is Santa...there are lots of things similar between the two, but there are also lots of things different between the similarities

They both keep lists: Santa has his list of people-it's a list that seperates the naughty ones from the nice ones...Jesus also keeps his list and it's called the Lamb's Book of Life...The difference between the two is that Santa wants your name off his and Jesus wants it on his...think about it...Santa's ""making a list, and checking it twice""...he wouldn't want you on it if he had to check it twice.  Jesus, on the other hand, will write your name in his book with blood so you can't be taken off

Both have presents:  Santa keeps his in a bag, and somehow comes down the chimney to give them to you.  Jesus' present was himself.  The difference is that the presents that santa gives sometimes break, and are often not what you wanted...either way they will NEVER last forever...but Jesus' present is for a lifetime and for much longer...to the count of maybe...forever

Both involve trees:  Santa puts his presents under the tree....Jesus' present was on a tree and it was himself.

as you can tell, there are many similarities and many differences between the two and hopefully one may look past the static created by the world and realize what Christmas is REALLY about



now that i'm off of my christmas sermon lol...i just want to shout out to all of you guys that read this...that tends to mean that you care, and that is always a good thing...as I go through the Christmas holiday and enter through a new year, i always think about what i have and the friends that i've been blessed with...i don't mean what i have physically, but what i have emotionally and stuff like that...if i thought about all of the material things i had, i would be very sad because my family wasn't blessed with much, but we know how to look at what counts and it's definately each other that means something...so i just want to thank you all for being friends and caring for me, because you don't have to and it's just a blessing to have each and every one of you in my life...so thank you guys and i really do love all of you"

"event","yeah well i think it's been a while since i've done this and i made an entry that didn't last long on here cuz it was bad and i didn't like it after i read it a few days later and my temper was down...but it's all good now and i am better...soo last week was great, considering it was a 2 and a half day week at school and there was a holiday that you can stuff your face and watch football at the same time and it was good...but yeah on thursday, we watched some of the macy's parade and then went to the roanoker to pick up our turkey cuz we're too lazy to fully cook it so all we do when we get it is heat it up...then later on my sis and i picked up grandma and brought her back to the house and then the rest of the bartley's came...we had fun, ate some, then my cuz and i played some vid games, threw around a football, and then watched the maryland game tape cuz he hadn't seen it...and eventually it was decided upon that he would spend the night and he ended up staying till like 4 on friday...he's a cool kid and it's fun to hang out with him even though all we did was play video games and throw a football all day on friday but that's cool cuz it was fun!  yeah don't think i did anything on friday night..but saturday was GAMEDAY and it was a great game...it's safe to say that the last 2 games of our season are two of the more important games in school history-but if we could only win one of the two, i'm definately happy we beat UVA...seriously, minus the big kick return to begin the game, pearman's run, the eddie royal fumble, and pearman's catch (4 plays) we dominated...and i get to wear my ""Virginia is for Losers"" shirt this year and it just makes me soo happy cuz there's always a bunch of trash talk before the game and i managed to just ignore them this year and the only real stuff i've said about the game is on this and my shirt and that's it...so hopefully the certain uva people will learn by example but chances are they won't...i apologize but i think it's funny how the two teams have switched positions from last year, where uva gets a sucky bowl and we get a really good bowl one way or the other...but in 5 out of the past 6 years, tech has won the commonwealth cup, so since 6th grade, tech has only lost ONCE...isn't that awesome?? aight so i'm done with my tech tangeant...

tomorrow is job shadowing day and i'm going to audiotronics...i don't know why, but i'm nervous and i shouldn't be cuz it's not like they can fire me or anything lol...but yeah it'll definately be fun because i love to do that car stuff....so yeah i'm sure this will be a fun experience

just kiddin, my tech stuff isn't over...saturday is gonna be a great game and regardless of who wins, it's an ex-big east member that wins the acc championship, either by tie or outright and that's GREAT...but go hokies and bring it home...we're all hungry for some sugar in the hokie nation

aight well i believe that's about it for now...no special news and i'm so twisted up on other things that they don't even deserve to be said right now...hope y'all enjoyed"

had fun today-winterized the boat, messed around with the lawnmower, waxed the car, watched the cavs lose, and then went to the game to watch the terriers lose but i drove knicely and sarah houff so that made me happy...but i'm done now"

"event","okay well it's unusual for me to do journals in the middle of the week, but i guess it's good enough for it...today was fun!  we had extra help which made government shorter and then i had band the rest of school until we (me, peyden, justin, and mrs c) left at about 12 to go to tech and it was really fun up there because we got to talk a long time to dave mckee (band director) and we saw the wind ensemble which is really good and i really like their music this year (it's a new guy so it's different-for the better) and then the trumpet lesson guy, a music technology professor, and then we saw the marching virginians practice which was fun...i also got to see stefie, leah, and sarah davis which was also fun...i'm not sure if it helped me know which major i want to do, but it DID help me know that i like tech even more and that i definately want to try to be in the wind ensemble and in the marching virginians cuz it was great!

aight there's lots goin on in my head right now and i'm just not sure how to go about it or how to even deal with it...this week has just been awkward and i'm just more shy about things than i was before because of so many questions and there's just so much right now...i mean i have my mind and everyone else really telling me that i should go for one thing, but there's still the thought about that other one and about what happened last time i led someone on then dropped her off...but now i'm even more confused because this past week i've heard a lot of stuff about the one everyone's pointing me to and that i gotta realize that just cuz someone was nice to me doesn't mean they like me...and i have gotten in trouble with that in the past...i'm just lost and i wish i knew what to do or how to magically fix everything in the world again to make it fit me but it doesn't work that way and i needa get over it...so i just want to apologize to whoever i may hurt in advance cuz i just don't know how things work...haven't dated a person longer than a few weeks since 8th grade and at that age it shouldn't really be considered dating...but whatever...things happen the way they do for a reason and if it's meant to be, i'll know it and figure it out"

"event","Alright..well I am already gonna guess that this is gonna be a pretty long journal so lean back in your chair and enjoy it!  last week was homecoming, and that means there was a lot of stuff that went on at school that was fun and ""spirity"" i guess you could put it...but anyways...yeah monday didn't really feel like it was homecoming week...i mean there was that big old mural down the senior hall that the cheerleaders always do and no one knew about twin day except for two people, so i just thought it was gonna be another regular week and all that....then tuesday happened and we didn't have school which was GREAT...but we had our final powderpuff practice before the big game and then we went to school for reindeer club to decorate the school more and the decorate our lockers in wrapping paper...so that was fun and the school finally looked more like what it should on homecoming week...and on wednesday (gameday), we had lots of fun talkin smack to the juniors about how they were gonna lose and all that good stuff and it was a good day...we had band practice till 5 and had to be back at school at 630, so we just decided to go out to get a bite to eat...bojangles...seems like a good place to eat doesn't it? not too slow and stuff?? yeah i ordered a fixin of dirty rice for dinner and waited there about 20 minutes...sat for another 5 and realized the rest of my group was done eating and i haven't even gotten my food...so i just decided to change to macaroni and cheese instead and i got that in about 15 seconds and downed it so my friends didn't hafta wait for me to eat it...but then at the game, we won 22-13 and it was lots of fun!  then thursday came and went w/ nothing special going on...finally friday rolled in and i was happy more cuz it was the last day of the week...but we had a normal day until about 2, when we had a pep rally and the band played and the whole big deal so that was fun...after school i went to bentley's house like normal and her mom ordered new york pizza which was really good so that was fun for the last game we'll be doing that...came back to school and thought it would be fun to go around and roll up a towel and smack all the guys...one happened to not like that idea and fought it and i ended up popping him in the eye...he resisted me and it woulda been okay if he just bent over and took it (sorry bout that lol i HAD to say it)...and the game had fireworks and all that good stuff and we actually won homecoming this year 28-7! so that was really good...except my bud that plays for lb broke his ankle at the game...yeah and the seniors did their last-ever marching show for the band on friday night, and i got to see a lot of my botetourt buds on fri night, so the game was good...but that was really my week

aight and then saturday didn't feel like there was a dance that night, but i guess that's cuz in the morning i went to the lake with my dad and we worked on the roof of our trailer and we winterized all of the pipes and good stuff there, so the trailer is ready for the winter, which is actually kinda sad, but i'm sure i'll be fine...and then there was the tech game and it really gave me a headache-but it turned out alright cuz vt won and i was happy!

now on to the dance...i got to maggie's house at 5:15 on the dot (which was when i was gonna pick her up) and her rents weren't there cuz they were working on getting her a new car, but her bro was and he took a few pics for us and we were off to staci's house...it's funny cuz i was gonna be a nice guy for her at the beginning of the night and get the door to my car for her, but my door was freakin locked and if you know that door, you know it's ghetto, so that plan screwed up...go figure the only time i was gonna be a really nice person and it blows up in my face, but it's okay...but at staci's house, we hung out for a while and watched some football and all that good stuff and i enjoyed talkin football with alex...once everyone got there, we took some pictures and then ate dinner (steak, chicken cordon bleu-it's french and i can't spell it, corn, mashed potatos, the works) but the best part about that was that the only place that all of us could sit around was the pool table, so they put a table cloth over it and we all ate on the pool table which was GREAT haha...yeah and we went to the dance early cuz one of the couples (i forget who) had pictures before the dance even started and we were there like 40 minutes before the dance, but it's all good cuz it was more hangin out time that i enjoyed and we got our pictures done then instead of later when there would be enormous lines...the actual dance part went by quickly and i was very happy hanging out with maggie and those kids...there was one part where she was dancing with some other guy and one of her friends came up to me and asked where maggie was and i said she was dancing with some guy up there, and she went up to her and stole her from him...but i really didn't care because i'm not much of a dancing person anyways so she needs to have fun and we're not really together anyways so it's not like i can't be jealous about her hanging out with other guys...and if we were i still wouldn't care about it just cuz i don't have issues with people dancing together...yeah but i was really glad that maggie and i went together and it was just a good night...but after the dance, we went to bentley's house and beat bentley there so we hung out in my car for a little but when we did go in i didn't ask my dad about spending the night, so i stayed until as late as i possibly could and then went home (like a minute away from bentley's house) and couldn't convince my dad to let me go back, and didn't argue much because i stayed out way late last week from scare mare and i didn't ask him until 1200 at night which also isn't smart...but o well i definately had a great night and it was by far my best homecoming and one that i will always remember

aight then it was sunday and i had to go to church, but i ran a few errands before then...first i wrote a little note to maggie thanking her for the evening and ran it by bentley's house, since her car was there...then i went to wal-mart to get my pictures developed...did the church thing, ate, ran back to wal-mart to pic up my pics, youth symphony, back to church to sing for choir and then some of us went to DQ and I had lots of fun there because they're people i like to hang out with, but don't get to hang out with them much...then after all that i came home and hung out for a while then went to bed

but yeah all in all this past week was a really good week, and i'm very happy homecoming went well and was stress-free and all that good stuff, but i guess that's it for now...i'll be writin more later on sometime"

"event","Aight well what's up guys?  Nothing really here..it's halloween at 7:18 and i have nothing to do =( oh well there's at least football on tv so that makes me happy...but lets see last week was just a normal week and nothing really special went on...but then friday night came along and then it started...i go out to my car and see the tire is half deflated, so i spend my friday afternoon going all over vinton pumping air and fix-a-flat into my tire and drive it around to make sure it's okay...when i get back to school i have just enough time to inhale a hot dog from the cookout the band boosters gave us and put my uniform on...but hey at least i got to sit next to my bus buddy! so stress level went down on the bus...then at the game we played a few songs with the northside band for pre-game and that was cool...but then at about 5 minutes until halftime mrs c tells us we're going to the home side to watch nortside's show, but we're waiting till 3 minutes to go...half of the band tries to go right after she does that announcement and i'm at the bottom of the steps filling up my water during all this...on my way up, someone is coming down and i stuck my hands up saying ""not yet"" and he tries to drive through me, push me down the steps, and knee me in the crotch...my bud sticks up for me and says ""man why do you hafta be such an ass"" he replies by saying ""i was getting money from my dad""...okay well you coulda said that BEFORE you pushed me down the steps and knee me in the crotch...he talks about quitting and stuff and it would really be pointless to quit NOW anywas cuz it doesn't mean anything...but i wish he never was in band cuz he's a jerk alot...so that brings my pissy level up again...then after halftime the northside band comes up and i talk to the drum major, who i talked to last spring or so and she said she remembered me and she's hot lol...yeah that's kinda a joke between my bud and i but it's still funny...then the game ends and we go home...i wanna do something and try to get people together, but EVERYONE i asked is going straight home and can't and that makes me sad...so i go home and sit here-then the next day we went to the V/A to paint a room and that was fun...my bus buddy was there so i was happy and wanted to convince her to go to scare mare w/ some of us that night, but she's a baby and doesn't like scary stuff so she refuses...but i go get a few more lights for my car and install them until time to leave...we meet at chris g's house at 530 and it's me, him, jj, and justin and we're going to katie's house to pick her up...we get there and her mom won't let her go so they spend like a half hour arguing about that and we get on the road at around 6:20, nearly an hour after we planned on it-because of that chris won't go cuz he's whipped by katie and jj won't go cuz he's whipped by chris so it's just me and knicely...get in lynchburg at 7:15 or so...we stand in line forever and see some kids we know(robin, kim, chris patterson, catherine p) and have them get in line with us...well we wait FOREVER (over 4 and a half hours) and are the next group in...i get a call from my dad calling and saying i need to come home NOW and i was so close...but he made me call him when i got to the car and there was NO way i could go thru...so we had to leave so close...now it's like 12:15 and i get home at around 1...but i was using the excuse i was ignorant about the time change and thought it was right at 12...so i didn't get yelled at too much when i got home, but i'm just sad because every plan i made for fun stuff this weekend fell through and didn't happen so i wasn't happy and i feel bad for knicely cuz he went with me and couldn't go-but we both agree that it's chris and katie's fault cuz they were the ones that held us up and hour and got us an hour behind which translates to a WHOLE lot sooner getting through in the scare mare line-but he seemed as cool with it as anyone i would know...then today our ss class went to cracker barrel and ate then i went to an anglican church and played trumpet...that was WEIRD-it was almost like a catholic church:definately a new experience
    
aight but yeah i have lots of questions about people now and i'm glad me and my bus buddy get along so well...i mean it's like i'm automatically better when i'm around her and all of my problems automatically come back once she leaves or something...it's crazy-but that's depressing too cuz there's only one more bus trip in band and that one's a pep band, but i'm sure she'll go...but oh well...this week is homecoming week and through all of the earlier homecoming controversy, i have a date (go figure-my bus buddy) and this hc isn't gonna suck like i felt like my freshman and sophmore year did (didn't go last year) this is my last chance to make hc good, so i'm hoping it will be!

so i submitted my tech application tonight and now i'm sitting here...there's not much else to talk about and this is a VERY long journal, so enjoy"

"event","Okay well most of you that would read this already know what went on and for those of you who don't, well here it is...I am highly pissed at the moment because of what happened in band today and i disagree with it...

Okay well on friday we're playing combined with Northside...so because of time restrictions we're playing the last two songs, therefore cutting my solo (which wasn't pleasing to me)...it is my senior year and things have happened to cancel this and that during the year and this is a poor excuse to have me play the solo one less time...on top of this, we're running onto the field at the beginning to our first set...well someone else in my section was doodling ""charge"" while it was discussed how we're going to go on...aight you need to remember the doodling part cuz i will go off on that later...but mrs chernault thinks it's cool and tells us to run on after HE plays it...i stood there with a blank look on my face and she said ""what are you too good to let someone else play something""...so that's an ego hit and yes i know i DO have an ego, but i earned what i have gotten and been able to back it up to this very day...as a senior soloist who gets his solo taken away at a place where he has the most competition, this is wrong...i'm in the youth symphony and there's a guy there that brags about HIS band and HIS solo...well it's always nice to be able to come in there and shut him up by playing your solo...but that's right i won't be able to...now back to doodling...there's a policy in our band where doodling before, during, or after practice earns you 5 minutes of extra marching after practice...it is OBVIOUS he was doodling, yet he gets rewarded for it instead of punished which i also disagree with...now the thing that hurts the most is what my band director said to me in front of 80-some people (are you too good to let someone else play something) and having my peers next to me laugh in my face about it...that hurt me deeper than she thinks and i don't care if she was joking, it was WRONG...so yeah i'm done venting, wednesday and thursday needs to be better"

"event","Alright well hey guys!  What's up w/ yall?  Well wow i didn't make one of these last week so it's been a little while since i've made one of these, but that's okay...i'll just try to remember the best i can.  well from the week before, we had a band comp that saturday (the day of the west virginia game) and i was depressed cuz since it was at tech and i have season tickets, i SHOULDA been there to see it live...but since that comp did happen, we went to franklin county and had a decent show, but nothing worth awards...and then after that comp, we came home and i had nothing to do sat night so i went to the fleming/salem game since they played it at byrd and i thought people i knew were gonna be there but i didn't find anyone so i sat on the home side (fleming) but don't worry i found a white person to sit near...and i made a mistake cuz last year there was a chick that came to byrd and we became really good friends and all and then she moved back to fleming in january and i saw her at the game but didn't go see her geez i'm stupid!  but then last week at school was a normal thing and we had band practice and all that good stuff...but on wednesday (i think) there was a powderpuff meeting for hc and i think that a few people want me and one of my buds to be coaches so we signed up...but we'll see if we actually get to be coaches or not...i hope so because it would be way cool to be able to do that!  we would have trick plays and all that fun stuff and it would be lots of fun!  but then there was the game on friday night and we played ANOTHER undefeated team (i think we've played 4 of those and we're 1-5) and lost by 7 or less for the 3rd time this season wow there are so many what if's this season that have gone on...but we open up district play on friday against alleghany so hopefully we'll do good in the district cuz if we do, the rest of the record won't really matter neways. and then there was fifth quarter which gets more lame each time i go...i mean all of the people i would hang out with there now either don't go or are whipped by their current g/f and i was just frustrated by people then so i left at like 1125 or so which is abnormal for me cuz i just don't leave things early like that, but hey i could go home and get ready for sat's in the morning...so i did the whole sat deal and i had fun there and you wouldn't think you could talk a lot, but during the breaks and stuff i felt like i really fit in more than i have in a long time anywhere and it made me happy cuz it's someone i don't hang out with much and i'm just glad there's cool people like that...math was easy but verbal was hard like normal but that's aight...so then we got out at 1205 and the tech/wake forest game was goin on and i went and got lunch and came back to school where there was a little party to watch the game and it was fun...but at halftime some of us went out to the parking lot where there are lines that mark a football field on there and we had a 2 hand touch game (it woulda been tackle if it weren't for the concrete and broken glass) and i was happy cuz i caught the ball like for a 5 yard pass and then ran it for another 20 or so and we scored just after that and it was hard to score so that made me happy...but then we had to get ready for our band comp and we rode up and it was fun cuz i like the people i was with and we played and since i'm pres i get to go w/ the leaders to get awards and it was fun cuz we got 2nd in drum major, marching, music, general effect, and overall and we also got superior and lost to northside by REAL close so it's all good i'm content...then one bust went home early and the other 2 stayed to watch the bigger band and they were awesome we saw some really good bands and that was fun... then the ride home and all that was good too so there's my update on stuff
    aight so i'm questioning a LOT of stuff right now and this is just frustrating and i want it to stop...cuz hc is coming up and i'm planning on asking someone who's really cool and likes me back, but then there's another person that wants me to go w/ her and not the other person and we've been buds since preschool, but i'm still definately thinking the first person...and then there's another chick that i liked last spring and i have a feeling has said some bad stuff about me to that chick that i like/want to bring to hc and it's frustrating cuz i thought she was over me by now and she needs to back out of my personal life...and i'm also worried cuz we do that 5th quarter, which is a dance type thing after every home game and i just haven't had fun this year at them so far and that worries me cuz hc is just another dance, except you have to wear a tie to that one!  and i've also had bad luck in the past hc's-my freshman year i took my g/f and she broke up w/ me like a week after, and then 10th grade i took someone who liked someone else and went out w/ him a week after and i don't want ANOTHER hc experience like that and i really like this chick and everything, but i'm getting those worries that what if i don't have fun and she thinks it's her fault or what if she doesn't have fun and we don't go anywhere from there??  so i definately don't want that...so to shorten what i just said...i REALLY wanna take this girl but i'm worried that it won't be fun for her or something like that...that's just the way i think so hopefully nothing like that will happen if we do go (and chances are we will)...soo those are my thought up to this very second...hope ya enjoy!! later guys"

"event","Hey guys!! Well what's hangin' with all y'all?  Nothing here...there's definately stuff on my mind though, so i'm gonna do my best to let it all out.
  well first off i'll get you updated on everything i've been up to since last time...this week has just really been a weird week, cuz monday there was a football game against salem, and on wednesday, we had an early dismissal...other than that, nothing too exciting...band practice...all that fun stuff...aight then friday was a bit different too...after school i had senior pictures, and i got some good pics i think!  they let me get a pic w/ my car, but the hard part was getting it in the breezeway, but it was my idea to put some 2x4's up next to the curb and we drove on the 2x4's and that made it easier to get it up the curb...then after that some of my buds got together, ate chinese, and watched the terriers lose and casey stafford (one of our best players) get taken away in an ambulance...and ya can't forget what happened yesterday...the tech v. nc state game...all i have to say is WOW...there were good points (defense) and bad points (offense and special teams) but i don't think that we shoulda lost by just 1 point looking at the stats and all but i'll take it and i'm still a proud hokie! then i got home and one of my buds said they were getting people together for a movie and then laser tag, but when i called her, she said the plans fell thru and nothing was happening...i decided to watch football then fell asleep on my couch, woke up at 930 then went to bed...then today the normal deal with church and youth symphony
   well the first thing on my mind...i don't know what's up with one of my friends right now...i know i used to like her and all, but geez i haven't talked to her about that in FOREVER! then she said she was goin to the tech game and i told her to come visit me and she agreed...well guess who didn't come see me??  yeah it made me kinda sad..then at church today she didn't say ONE thing to me and that made me sadder...soo what did i do?? i don't know but i want to fix whatever
    the next is that someone said they like me tonight and i think VERY highly of her and i think it'd be great to hang out with her and maybe go out, but there's one drawback, she's a freshman...but hey i'm thinkin that if i like someone and they like me back it shouldn't matter that the age is...and besides everything's ""legal"" in high school lol! soo yah if anyone has any comments on that please share!  but i know she's prob gonna read this and sry about it, but you know i'm thinkin about that and you prob are too...hopefully whatever happens is cuz that's the way it's supposed to be!
   aight the last thing on my mind is sleep so i'm gonna head on out...hope y'all enjoyed my journal!! later guys"

"event","yeah well this weekend has been pretty good i guess...the hurricane that never came got us out early from school on friday which was cool but it sucked that the football game and the preview my senior year was cancelled...but hey at least there was still the tech game...yeah so on friday, gardner came over and we had a big old movie day or something...we watched starsky and hutch, dickie roberts or whatever it is, and then 3 others (JJ, Justin, and BS) came over and we decided to go to JJs house to watch our feature, the girl next door! yay haha i watched it like last week or some time a while back and i wanted to see it again so it was just as good the second time and with people!  but yeah then on saturday, we went to the tech game and it was weird cuz i usually go w/ my aunt, her friend, and her friend's husband...but the husband couldn't go so neither did the friend so my rents and aunt went with me...it was good!  i got to see sarah davis and leah and of course, stefie...and after the game we went and ate at my fav restaraunt in blacksburg, bogen's! mmm i always get the radford arsenal (cheeseburger w/ jalapenos) so then we came home and i went to bed not long after...today was the normal go to church (i got to sit next to whit!!) and youth symphony day...i'm really gonna like this youth symphony deal better than last year...the trumpets talk to me more and there's this BANGIN' harp player that sits in front of me!  i think she goes to Jeff. Forest...but yeah haha then on my way home i washed the prix at the quarter car wash and went to church again for the evening stuff...now i'm here...

so i am really confused about stuff recently and i just don't know what to do...i mean i think i like someone, but i also STILL like HER and it's annoying cuz the one that i like and may like me back is young (freshy) and goes to another school and i still don't think i'd ever get a chance w/ that one that i've liked forever...i met the one girl that i've liked forever the summer before my freshman year and i can hold it in more now, but the fact is i still have feelings for her and i don't get it...and i haven't dated anyone since robin and i went out when i was a sopho (and that lasted a week) and before that it was leah when i was a freshman in the fall and she knew that i kinda liked that one chick...it's awful cuz it's just a big carousel that involves a few random people and then every once in a while someone else gets on but then gets off...but those few just STAY there that i have feelings for and it's annoying...you could say i need help..."

"event","yeah hey you guys!  i always start this thing and then stop it and start again...but i'm starting again!  a lot has gone on since last time i've updated...some of my buds have gone off to college, a friend died, and so much other stuff happened over the summer...but now school is in full swing again and i'm missing my buds that have left...leah i/med me tonight saying she misses me and i miss her too and i know she's just 45 minutes away but it's a WHOLE lot longer than just 10...and i wanted to say something to make us both feel better, but it's just so hard cuz i still miss her!  but yeah...and then school is going alright...the only two real tough classes that i think i'm gonna have this year are government and statistics and possibly physics, but it looks like stat isn't gonna be all that tough...that's another thing about those guys that graduated....i always liked being able to talk to someone and ask them about what a teacher wants and stuff, but now it's harder and i still miss them...so yeah that's been not good
     yeah and just in case you were wondering since most of you didn't know, my youth group had someone very close to them die...he was gary epperly and everyone that was at least in 10th grade was in his sunday school class...he ALWAYS had 3 different flavors of gum to give out to ANYONE that wanted it...and i always had my own gum, but even though he knew that, he offered it to me...just to make sure i didn't forget mine or something...he was a great pal to the youth group and he was a forty-some year old man who never grew up past 14 or so...i remember the last time he was with us...we were playing volleyball in the parking lot and he did really good...but we went on our mission trip and he went on vacation to the beach...he was with his son in the ocean when the undertoe caught him...he managed to get ben on the shore but couldn't save himself and he was gone...we came home early from our mission trip so we could see his funeral and he was buried with gum in his hands...everyone in the youth group loved gary because gary loved everyone in the youth group-no matter who it was
   but yeah...soo other things went on in my summer and i have more going on in my life right now...but this is a start...so hopefully i'll keep up with it this time...talk to y'all later"

"event","aight well there's that chick that i like and she's really cool!  well we are starting to talk more about the idea of goin out and today she gave me a note...i am really unsure about what she's trying to say here...but if anyone could help it'd be awesome!

aight well first she said she likes me...and then another guy-that one is a senior and she's goin to prom w/ him and all
then later on she said ""I never want us to become less than what our friendship is now.  What I am looking for isn't a commitment, more like someone I can go anywhere with and have a great time and have fun.  High school isn't a time for being exclusive, it's a time for fun.""  

aight so i mean i guess it's sayin just that..she just wants a friendship...i don't know though, if it IS just a friendship, i want it to be much more than it is right now.  She's the only person that I have met that I just smile everytime i look at her...blah blah blah how sweet...but it's true and i'm so glad that we've had the pageant to get to know each other!  we are both worried about what's gonna happen after it, but if we both feel that way, we should be able to get through it! yeah so like i take it, for now friends, but hopefully later on i'll get my shot!"

"event","aight...well i don't remember the last time i made one of these i'm thinkin somewhere along the lines of sunday night when i was talkin about that chick that i hung out w/ but she really likes someone different...this week has been REALLY crazy-had its ups and downs...but i'll start w/ the ups since they're always better...the car show inspired me to get a sub and stuff for my car and i did and it's really cool!  i have a semi-down that comes w/ that and it's i hafta wait until spring break to install it...until then i have to make a box for it and figure out how the crap i'm gonna wire it...but it'll be fun i can't wait till it's in and works right!  also tonight we had a band festival thing and i hung out w/ the coolest kids b/c they aren't into all the drama and it made me feel better and had me actually know that some people are still cool
  i DO have some downs though...well it's one major down...my best friend is still really bothering me in her decision making and i just think that some of the stuff going on is just so avoidable, but honestly, the people i hung out with tonight are way better and don't tell me who i needa be...so it just gets me down that all this is going on and there's nothing really that i CAN do or actually want to do...she's starting to go a different way than i am, and that's cool go do it, but we're not gonna be as close...
   as usual i have a girl section...i just keep goin from girl to girl...it used to be just cuz i liked them but now it's cuz i liked them and i've realized who doesn't like me...soo yeah i want to say that one of the chicks i hung out w/ tonight i like...but i'm really not sure if she likes me...and we were together in 8th grade-that all ended badly...things are different and we are buds and i think i want to talk to her about it but i've never been good at all that...soo i really don't know...but i DO know that we have a lot in common and we used to be together...we'll see...ya never know..."

"event","well this has been a good weekend! until tonight after i got home...aight well anyways the past week i had been talking w/ this chick and we haven't talked in like over a year but she randomly decides to talk to me and we hit it off again like we did then...the week goes on and i ask if she wants to hang out this weekend and she said sure...sooo last night (fri night) i picked her up from lb at around 730 and we went to her house and hung out...her friends came over near 9 and it wasn't as good then cuz she and 2 other girls that are as close as those 3 are and then a random boy just don't work right lol!  but yeah that was fun...at least i got to hang out w/ a chick right?  today was okay too...i watched the tech b-ball game, fixed a light switch, went to see my g-ma, ate at villa sorento, and went to the CAR SHOW!! ahh my 2 dream cars were there...there was an orange 1978(close to that year) firebird trans am w/ the bird on the hood and a new gto! i woulda changed the orange color, but that's me...aight soo that was all good..then i get on the net tonight..
  i start talking to the chick that i hung out w/ last night and  that i was starting to like...BUT she mentions that she likes someone and he likes her, but he likes someone else to and i had to act normal and give her the right stuff to say in that situation...it really sucks man...i always like the right chicks at the wrong time...she used to like me back like a year and a half ago...but i was too stupid liking someone else to realize it...ohh well she can still make a good friend and hopefully something miraculous will happen that she'll start liking me haha...well you never know it MAY happen...so that's my fri-sat.."

"event","what's up guys?  well it's been a while...i don't know my last one though but i'll start w/ thurs night...we had a b-ball game against my big rivalry and our guys pulled it out w/ a buzzer-beating shot to win it instead of goin into OT...i kinda hoped to talk to katie some, but she cheers for jv and went home after that...gotta love when things don't work right
  well then friday morning me and 5 other ppl from the band went to va tech and did honor band...it was real fun...we took a good group up there and we had a good time...the weather forecast made us have our concert sat night instead of sunday afternoon...then we all decided to go out and eat where we planned on and it was fun too...i ate crawfish and sucked on one of their bodies...ooo and alligator tail too..but it didn't have much taste
  aight then it snowed and i've really sat here the rest of the time!  i talked w/ corri some and told her i still liked her and she said she still isn't sure if she wants to have a b/f or not and who she likes...so that worries me cuz i've kinda been wondering about her and some guy and it would figure cuz this guy liked another chick that i liked 2 yrs ago...and then my fam and i watched bruce almighty...good movie...kinda makes you think about a LOT of stuff..but yeah i guess that's it for today...we don't have school again tomorrow but i still needa do all my hw...and i have a lot...but take care you guys...have a good day off!"

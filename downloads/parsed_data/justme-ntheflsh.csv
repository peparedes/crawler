"event","Oh Oh Oh! today's been absolutly crazy! well when i got my Automatic stearing pump fixed the guys that did it messed up somehow cause now i have a leak and my car is smoking and sounds like a whale..haha i know right...then me and crystal were on nolan river and and this guy in a black bronco desided he was going to make his way across the road oh' say when i was about 5' feet away, i just keep thinking that if i hadn't hesitated to fix my rear view mirror i wouln't have slammed on my breaks in time and our cars would both be totalled and concidering i was headed right towards his door, the guy probally would have died, so going through joshua me and crystal were both in a daze still obviously shocked from what had happened and well i wasn't paying attention to the speed and a cop came along right about that time and even though we tried to hurry up and pull into chicken express they still caught us..damit is all i have to say..i guess it's really not that big of a deal , tickets can be payed for, i'll just have to request a payment plan or some crap, cause theres no way i can do it in one payment, not paying for the bird...but what the best timing i might add...here i am almost 2months pregnant trying to save up for the baby that will be arriving in feb. and my car is falling apart and i get a speeding ticket...wow...how i've loved these last couple of weeks...all i can say is how much i love that in the worst of time's those true friends have stuck beside me, it's nice to know, ya know. i love you, you know who you are, all of you. i think ultimatly paul and crystal have been the best. pauls ultimatly excited, definatly more than i expected he would be, he get's this silly grin on his face every once in a while and just points at the two little onesies my mom got for us. i guess we're both just really excited. aight well it's time for me and paul's ""movie time"" so i'll get back to ya later...peace love and all that other stuff..chow"

"event","""i was hesitant to ask you at first, not sure how you'd react, but knowing now that your alright with this i'll procede. how did you feel when he first touched you? Maybe like a sex goddess, a secret sex goddess? How about just sexy or romantic? Wrong? Right? tell me Milissa.""

 hiting me like a big bat, her words left me competly dumbfounded. Who exactly thought to ask such things? And who ever said i was alright with such questions! I-I-

""It's alright Milissa, perfectly natural, tell me Milissa, are you close to god?""

of course i'm close to god! why would i not be close to god? do i look like i'm not close to god? Why should i have to talk about god?

""yes"" i was reluctant to give her anything more than she deserved at this point.

""how often would you say you attend church Milissa?""

well concidering i havn't ""attended"" church in over a year i would say about not often.

""i study my bible"" my very brief answer left a sweet but anoyed look on her face. i liked this look, it was a look for success.

""tell me Dr., how did you feel when you walked in on your husband having sex with your best friend marcy? did you want to dig one of your new kitchen knifes into his skin maybe rip her hair out and punch her till her blood covered the walls? what went through your mind as you drove up and her car was parked outside? that maybe they were played checkers or catching up on weekly buisness? After all she could have just been waiting for you, maybe she had something important to tell you. But that wasn't it was it. No exuse in the world could save you from seeing your perfect husband drive himself into your best friend of 15 years, could it Doc. So slowly closing the door you walked out to drive 300 miles in your convertable with the top down letting the rain beat any sain  instinct out of you. And when you reached your destination at 1612 Luna st. your sister answered the door and called you nieve after hearing your story.""

Staring hard into cold eyes i witnesses a single tear role down her cheek.

""you were weak Dr., weak"" then walking out i headed home.

I'm three months pregnant and my mother has forced me to start ""appointments"" with a psychiatrist down town. she said it would further my knowlegde and help me cope with the pregnancy. Most of all i think she's just trying to break me down untill i agree to an abortion. I'm not sure what in the hell kind of psychiatrist asks you if you ""felt like a sex goddess when he touched you"" but it's definatly not one im wasting time on.

~

Another day has come and gone and i've recently started spending my ""appointments"" at the mall. i use my mom's ""psychiatrist"" payments to buy cute baby cloths and booties and splurge on french fries and gravy. i must say It beats listening to psycho bable bullshit from a woman who spent a whole year in the looney bin and from what i've heard she re-admitted herself back in the day after our confrontation. serves her right trying to solve someone elses problems with perversion, i hate using my gift in not so good situations but sometimes people just dont understand. Me and Chris have been dating for three years and how i feel when he touches me is my own damn buisness and i never at any point ever said that i was alright with that kind of snooping.

Mr. and Mrs. Chris Appleton. Milissa Appleton. Mrs. Appleton. Mrs. Milissa A. Appleton. ~Sounds perfect doesn't it. In two hours i will officially be Milissa Appleton the wife of Chris Appleton and the mother of James Christian Appleton. James has finnally reached 2 months and has descovered his hand. cute i know. i cant wait for his third, forth and of course crawling, his very first step into toddler hood and his first word which will be ""mama"" i'm sure. i finally managed to get a job as a reseptionist in a dental office about three blocks from the house, i would say a perfect catch not to mention free dental of course and a pay rate of $18.00 an hour just to sit behind a desk and answer a phone, who knew right?

~

I've desided to quit using my gift, i figure it spoils the fun of being surprised by james (first') when i can see when they will actually happen. i like the surprise."

"event","So many things can happen in the blink of an eye. houses catch fire, cars wreck, buisness's make deals. these are the catagories of different top stories told on the news, the real deal. but what does a person really do during the thousand blinks a day?  breath, watch tv, work or learn about politics and how to make the perfect eggs. a person i knew often got angry with me because i was so buisy trying to live my life, i forgot about the important things like family time and love. but while a persons daily routines are mindlessly played out,the real sight is lost, the ""burnt out"" feeling imurges,along with it's sidekick ""anger"". we become lifeless bodies wondering the streets of manhattan, just trying to remember if we left the lights on or not and hopeing someone will break the lonliness in a short phone call.  those around us suddenly become annoying and we get cranky about it, only wishing a day without them.and soon are problems build into massive bags of bricks till it all breaks down on us like the sudden crack in a board; and we loose it, all of it. we start questioning ourselves, and the people around us. we live endless day's of sarrow and worry. depriveing oursevles of fo sleep and happyness, dwellin on how depressed we are and why. then of course things get even more screwed up. everthing goes wrong, and just when you say ""hey, i want out of this"" it get's worse; untill you learn your lesson or do what's really on your mind, your taunted day and night, night and day. and when you finally do one of the two, you survive. the real humor in this insight is that no matter how many times we play this out, we always come back for more."

"event","i could feel the rage cirulating through my fingers, but all i could here was dave telling me it was going to be all right. ""there are some shity people in the world kristy"". The words played in my mind over and over. ""there are some shitty people in the world"". ""there are some shitty people in the world"". my question was, how it that i always manage to find them. this question however had lingered like a bad habbit now for five months, and the only answer i've gotton is more shitty people. so of course, my brain began chanting ""it's you, it's you"". and if so, what had i done wrong? i'd cared just like any other friend, tried to be there. though i've tried to tell myself to go on, still, only half of me believes it. so while half of me bargin's it's god's lesson, the other slithers words of self-involvment, backstabber and bitch. but could this really be me? i've never believed myself to be anything less than great, this theory however only feeds me large doses of guilt. no person should think so highly of themselves. so, in judging myself, i find myself not worthy of friendship, or love for that fact. and that is my greatest sickness; over anylization.
    Hi. my name is Katylynne Mallin, and since i was six years old i've worried; about my mother mostly. worried if she world be ok, if she would be there when i got home; if she still loved me. I strived to make sure i knew the answers to these questions; she has always been there though. right there through the fights, make ups, heartbreaks and every trouble along the way. i never did like the answers she provided to my problems. mostly because she never provided the ones i wanted to hear. i loved her though. the kind of love that makes you cry on the spot at the thought of loosing such a thing. the kind of thought that makes it possible for an actor to cry so passionatly during a movie. i always thought i'd make a good actress. i've always been able to act through moments of life. when i was a kid, and knew i was about to get busted, i'd practice in my head the exact way to lie. the way that would prevent them from realizing you were lieing. the confidence in that is that i managed to get away with 90% of the time. one time my sister and i were fighting about something(we were young) and i knocked the ashtray over out of anger, and when my mother asked me why i did it, i acted completly dumb founded and my sister got punished. that you might say is devious, and i agree. i've always been devious. i cant deside if i am today or not. i go through a new set of friends every month. but i'm not sure if it's because i dont like to get close or if i'm scared, or if i just dont know how to be a friend. i possitive it's all three. but how to handle it? i've never discovered that.  i've never kept a friend longer than three months. so obviously with every new friend i search for down points and freak out when things change such as the sudden decrease in phone calls or intrest in someone new. i think, ""that person is so much cooler than me, why would they wanna hang out with me"" and then convince myself it's over. and i panic, become more talkative, stuff like that."

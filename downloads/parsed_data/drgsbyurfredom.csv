"event","When you think about everything that happens, and what happens because of them...what's the point in making personal decisions?

As human beings on this planet we proceed to make our lives easier, and better. And in turn making our species more lazy, and more prone to disease. But above all of these things, all we have accomplished is destroying the planet, making humans less healthy, deaths, and insane domination freaks.

With the way everything is going, there is no point to human life.
Why were we put on this earth?
Most likely to punish us.
For we were first created with no technology, and life as a hell hole.
Then, we developed, and life became better.
But following that the planet is becoming destroyed.
It'll be long after my generation, but I laugh at the idiots who continue to kill everything around them only to cause great suffering to later people.

Went on zero gravity twice...the giant circle that spins and you stick to the side, tons of fun...
and the ""rock & roll"" thing twice, where it goes in circles really fast...also fun.
and multiple other rides...but the ship swinging thing sucked because I almost fell out, the bar was crushing my ""manly parts"" and people kept screaming...so John michael yelled SHUT UP and when they didnt i yelled SHUT THE FUCK UP but they kept screaming and it was sort of annoying.

I had to go to my step-brothers wedding yesterday.
Getting dressed up sucked, a lot.
My mom said it'd be maybe 3-4 hours...which i guess wasn't bad...but it turns out I was stuck there for about seven and a half hours.
D:
The food sucked, also...the salad was SHIT and the chicken crap sucked, I had to hold my mouth shut so i wouldn't throw up.
I ended up sitting in the car listening to my cd player for the last like 1-2hours...
:/
It would've been better if I could've brought a friend or something so I had someone to talk to, maybe then it wouldn't have been as bad.
I would've asked ______ but she'd have said no anyway.
And the music sucked...they played one good song by ACDC and then the rest was love crap which always reminds me of an awkward dance at the school...cause i was nervous and she probably didn't want to be there. Lol. SO hearing that music sucked. (And I think they played the actuall song)

Cuz you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things
About me cuz you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only cuz you're
Just really jealous of me
Cuz I'm what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
Cuz it's too easy to see
You're just a really big weenie, big weenie

Alright listen, I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
I'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment
Now I need you to open your mind-your eyes close them
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next four and a half minutes
We are going to explore into your mind
To find out why you're so fuckin' jealous
Now why did they make Yoo-Hoo?
Hippity ga-ga boo-boo
Psych, I'm kidding
I just wanted to see if you're still listenin'
Ok, now I need your undivided attention
Sir I have a question
Why do I always sense this undeniable tension
From the moment that I enter into the room
It gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever theres conversation, why am I always mentioned?
I've been dying to ask, it's been itchin' at me
Is it just because

You are just jealous of me

Alright now I, I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what it was, I fucked up
Psych, I'm kidding again you idiot, no I didn't
That's just what you wanted to hear from me
Is that I fucked up ain't it?
But I can bust one take without lookin' at no paper
It doesn't take a bunch of takes
Or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth, ok?
You're droolin, you have tooth decay
Your mouth is open, you're disgusting
What the fuck you eat for lunch
A bunch of sweets or something, what?
You munch a bunch of Crunch 'N Munch?
Your tooth is rotten to the gum
Your breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?
Yes I do sir, what am I on?
You sir are on truth syrum
Marshall I'm so jealous of you
Please say you won't tell nobody
I'd be so embarrassed, I'm just absolutely terrified
That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying
All these terrible, evil and awful mean things
It's my own insecurity!

You are just jealous of me
Cuz you, you just can't do what I do

Alright now we, we're going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
Cuz that's exactly what your eyes look like, want to check to see?
Here's a mirror, notice the resemblence here?
Wait, let me put these sun glasses on
Now look in this mirror, how about now?
What do you have in common?
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em
You look like I sound like singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
This is between me and you, I know you're not happy
I know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying
Curled up in a ball tweeked out of my mind dying
There is no denying that my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
Why you even doing this to yourself, it's pointless
Why do we have to keep on going through this, this is tortuous
My point is this
That if you say mean things, weenie will shrink
Now I fogot what the chorus is, your just is...

You are just jealous of me

I was supposed to get some for someone for her birthday a while ago, which I didn't since the person I got mine from is in jail.

But if I do somehow get any for her, I'm sad to say, but she aint gonna get it because I won't be able to give it away since I havn't had any in such a long time.

I thought stopping would be good since it fucks you up so bad, but it's just made everything worse....

SO basicly...to make it simple, summer completely sucks and I have no idea why I'm typing this instead of wasting away my life and mind infront of the television like I have been doing since no one wants to hang out or anything.

Yay for me, I just wasted like 15min typing all this bullshit that no one cares about.
Or atleast that's the vibe I get since no one comments.

I'm still waiting to see Lord of Dogtown...it isn't playing anywhere that I know of though, which sucks.

Michael Jackson's court case was just live on TV.
He's innocent of all charges.

I know this will most-likely bring about discussion, but I am happy that he was cleared of the charges.
Michael Jackson was the most influencial people in music twenty years ago, and continues to influence people today. Without his music, we wouldn't be anywhere near where we are today.
And also, just as an added tidbit, I don't think he did it. So fuck all you bastards who think he did, like my step-dad.

The second he was cleared (my step-dad was watching it aswell, but downstairs), he comes charging up the stairs and yells and yells saying horrible things about the man, and then he looks at me with a REALLy pissed off look on his face, and he's like ""CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?!"" and, as not to show that I was in favor of him, I said ""what?"" and he just yelled ""YOU HAVE LESS RIGHTS THAN A BLACK PERSON!"" and stormed off downstairs.

I fuckin' hate that fatass racist / sexist motherfucker.
I wish that before (when I took a knife to his throat) I fuckin moved it an inch to the left. So I wouldn't have to deal with his bullshit anymore.
If him and his family dropped dead I wouldn't be sad. Everything about him sucks, he doesn't have one good quality and he's a complete jackass.
I fuckin' hate him."

I'm just a kid, I know that its not fair
Nobody cares, cause I'm alone and the world is

Staring at these 4 walls again
I'll try to think about the last time, I had a good time
Everyone's got somewhere to go
And they're gonna leave me here on my own and here it goes

We rented the movie 'Grind' (very good)
And his sister and her friend rented Honey and 50 First dates (yea, we watched those aswell)

HIGHLITE OF THE DAY:
We went outside to play basket ball after dinner, and the second we get out there these little kids from across the road (who were using my ball and jm's hoop) run over and tell us there were black people in a ford escalade (sp?) chasing them with guns and knives.

My first thought: Bullshit.
But john michael had to be a retarded and go to the boat lauch (where the kids said the ""bad people"" went)
And, behold, there were just a few people on a boat, which weren't black.
Never would've guessed.

It was funny though because JM/Wesley/Me kept making jokes about it and all the little kids kept getting pissed off."

The school of champions.

The gym teachers can't do physical activities, the health teacher's over weight (and screams instead of talking), the math teachers respond to questions with more questions, there's a fat lady sitting at a table who yells at you when you try to cook, the graphics teacher is a full-blown moronic hippy, the journalism teacher wouldn't know a good story if it smacked her in the face, the economics teacher is an alcoholic and drinks on school grounds, you can learn more about computers in an hour than the computer teacher, and the english teacher's favorite word is ""Buck-up"" (one of the only words that aren't assigned for vocabulary).

the mental blade cut through flesh and bone
though my mind's at peace, the world out of order
missing the inner heat, life gets colder
oh yes, I have to find my path
no less, walk on earth, water, and fire
the elements compose a magnum opus
my modus is operandi is amalgam
steel packed tight in microchip
on my arm a sign of all-pro
the ultimate reward is honor, not awards
at odds with the times in wars with no lords

a freelancer, 
a battle cry of a hawk make a dove fly and a tear dry
wonder why a lone wolf don't run with a klan
only trust your instincts and be one with the plan

some days, some nights
some live, some die
in the way of the samurai
some fight, some bleed
sun up to sun down
the sons of a battlecry

some days, some nights
some live, some die
in the way of the samurai
some fight, some bleed
sun up to sun down
the sons of a battlecry

look, just the air around him
an aura surrounding the heir apparent
he might be a peasant but shine like grand royalty
he to the people and land, loyalty
we witness above all to hear this,
sea sickness in the ocean of wickedness
set sail to the sun set no second guessing

far east style with the spirit of wild west
the ""quote-unquote"" code stands the test of
time for the chosen ones to find the best of
noble minds that ever graced the face of
a hemisphere with no fear, fly over

the blue yonder where
the sky meets the sea
and eye meets no eye
and boy meets world
and became a man to serve the world
to save the day, the night, and the girl too"

"event","Cultivate your hunger before you idealize.
Motivate your anger to make them all realize.
Climbing the mountain, never coming down.
Break into the contents, never falling down.

My knee is still shaking, like I was twelve,
Sneaking out of the classroom, by the back door.
A man railed at me twice though, but I didn't care.
Waiting is wasting for people like me.

Don't try to live so wise.
Don't cry 'cause you're so right.
Don't dry with fakes or fears,
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end."

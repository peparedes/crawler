"event","Spider-Man that is...word was yesterday that Spidey was soundly defeated by Doctor Octopus, don't know if that's true or not, could have just been spin from J. Jonah Jameson, but whatever happened he certainly brought Octavius down tonight! The security sentrys stationed outside the Fort Lee Atomic Facility had gone to investigate some noise inside and there was Dr. Octavius all tied up in the webline Spider-Man uses.

Amazing stuff!

I'm sure Harry was watching the TV in his room and can now rest easy. :-)

He didn't actually call me, but in his latest LJ update he told me he was back at the Mansion and he was sorry about the mess he left the Guest Room in (you should be! Kidding!), I told him not to worry and he said he'd be by tomorrow to clean up.

I was thinking about the big problem with the Swimming Carnival, it means I can't sit with Harry because our homerooms are different, we actually got in trouble Freshman year when we did. The Captain of my house actually came over and told me off for fraternising with the enemy! It was one of the weirdest speeches I've head (and Mr. Jameson is often a guest to dinner here)! Seriously, though, how ridiculous is that, fratenising with the enemy...please.

Anyway, I got so absorbed in the whole Dr. Octavius situation I haven't done my homework so I better go do it now!

"event","When I got home this afternoon after doing some more work on my extra-credit project for Politics and swimming in the Carnival...at least for one heat (I think just about everyone ended up having to swim in it anyway) I was surprised to see that Harry was nowhere around. I assumed he went and visited his father directly after school, but afternoon visiting hour finishes at four so he really should be home. I tried calling him on his mobile, but the battery's flat (again, I swear, Harry, you never plugbit in) and I got a little nervous, wondering if perhaps something terrible had happened to Mr. Osborn and that's why Harry wasn't back. So I actually called the hospital (a little overreaction maybe) and asked after Mr. Osborn and they told me the most amazing thing!

Apparently, Mr. Osborn has checked himself out! He only woke up from the coma five days ago! I can't believe he'd be on his feet all ready. But the nurse just said he had a right to check himself out and he did.

That been the case I guessed he and Harry went back to the mansion...and having just checked my Friend's Page I see that's the case (but Harry's not on AIM and the landline is still disconnected at the Osborn Mansion).

Well if you read this Harry, most of your clothes are still here! Not to mention some school books...I'm surprised you haven't called or didn't stop by to ge them... I guess you and your father are catching up on things. I know yoou said your father's been acting strange ever since he woke up, but that was probably the hospital atmosphere more than anything. I'm sure things are much better now.

In other news, Doctor Octopus is still at large...Harry's been freaking out about it, I think he took last year's Science section on Nuclear energy to heart. I tried to tell him that the Atomic Research Facility doesn't have an nuclear bombs and it's extremely unlikely it'll blow up, but I don't think he got much comfort from that.

The <i>Fantastic Four</i> have sent the Human Torch down to see what he can do (the rest of them are in the middle of a case), as far as I know the Torch's powers aren't working at the moment, but things may have changed today, so I'm going to check CNN now and see what's going on.

Life in New York is never dull I can say that much!

"event","I'm just taking a break watching CNN to type this up, but it looks like the explosion Dr. Octavius was in caused terrible brain damage! He was always a responsible man, but now he's gone on a rampage and is holed up in the Atomic Research Facility in Fort Lee planning God know what!

Dad seems to think that everything will turn out for the best, but Dad's very optomistic...It's true superheros show up a lot here in New York, but I can't help thinking that they don't always win...

I just can't believe it of Dr. Octavius though... I hope he doesn't do anything crazy.

Well, anything <b>crazier</b> that is...

Right, I'm getting back downstairs to see how the rest of the story unfolds!

"event","I'm sure everyone else will be posting about how the Junior Co-ordinator is a total bitch (I'm not actually going to make that statment since you can't really tell after only an hour and a half...she could just be having a bad day), but I'm thinking more about what subjects I'm going to take. I've even compiled a little list:

<i>Health/Gym</i>- Everyone has to take this
<i>English</i>- You have to do this too, I think I'll be in Advanced Placement.
<i>Chemistry</i>- I've been looking forward to this since coming to High School!
<i>Politics- Birth of Democracy</i>- Hey, it sounds interesting!
<i>Geography</i>
<i>Trignometry</i>
<i>French Honours</i>- Harry, you may bitch about French like it's the worst thing ever, but some of us actually like it, thank you!

You only need to take six subjects...but we Stacys never do things by halves! Of course, Harry's bummed that we probably won't be in the same Chemistry class because I'm getting an A and he's getting a C...But don't worry Harry, I'll still help you out! :-) And maybe one day I can be on the Board of <i>Osborn Industries</i>! Expanding into Genetic Science would be something!

That's it, we need to discuss a business plan...as soon as you get home from visiting your father. Don't stand me up, now. ;-)

"event","Mr. Osborn's come out of his medically induced coma! Harry will be able to visit him tomorrow afternoon!

This is <b>such</b> great news! Poor Harry hasn't seen his father in a month, I shudder to think of what I'd be like if that happened to me!

I don't think you're going to concentrate at <b>all</b> at school tomorrow are you, Harry? :-) Oh well, we've got that special Grade assembly with the Junior Co-ordinator to discuss what will happen next year. Everyone's looking forward to it because we're getting out of French/Italian/Spanish...honestly...Languages aren't <b>that</b> bad.

Anyway, after Harry and I danced around like idiots after hearing the news, I asked Harry if he'd done his homework...I told him a while ago he should do it as soon as possible, but he never listens to me (do you, Harry?) and of course he hasn't so I've offered to help him out, because what are friends for? (Although, not tonight because it's far too late...)

Heh, I don't really have much more to say, but I felt like spreading the joy about Harry's father, I guess he won't need that <i>Get Well</i> book after all!

"event","This morning at breakfast, Harry brought in the paper and made a big production about opening it (apparently he really likes the peeling off the plastic) and announced. ""Hey, it's not about Spider-Man for a change...""

He then showed me the front page...a big headline about Dr. Octavius (who, if you don't know is an extremely important Nuclear Scientist who works in the Nuclear Reasearch Centre just out of the city), he's been in an awful accident! A radiation explosion! I don't want to think how he might end up...

I did a project on Dr. Octavius in Grade Seven, I still have a lot of the articles I used to write it and for a while I wanted to be a Nuclear Scientist...fear sof Chenolybl and Three Mile Island and China White aside, nuclear science is making leaps and bounds in medicine and other such things. But, I think I'd rather be a genetist, and it's an article like this that brings it home. Not that genetics isn't without it's own problems...morals for example.

Which is why this icon is so great! Harry made it for me, I have no idea how he does it, seriously! But I like to call it my <b>real</b> misson statement!

Still, science, like the law...like anything, I suppose, can be dangerous,which brings me back to Dr. Octavius...I wonder if they'll be a Book of Well-Wishes set up? They did that last year when Prof. Burroughs (a chemist) was badly injured. I hope so.

Which makes me wonder, does <i>Osborn Industries</i> have a book like that for Mr. Osborn? They should! I'm sure he was working on something for his company when the accident happened. Harry, you should ask them! And while you're at it, ask them if they called you yesterday. If not if those other guys happen to call you again you can tell 'em you're onto 'em and you're going to the cops. }:-)

Well...so concludes my second entry...I doubt it was as interesting for you as it was for me... :-P

"event","Welcome to my Journal...which I didn't even set up! It was all my best friend, Harry's, doing! He even set up all this pink...not that I don't like pink, it's my favourite colour actually (I know, so girly-girl!) and even made this icon for me, so unlike his friend, Evan he's not tossing me in the deep-end I suppose.<br><br>But just what am I meant to use this for? Isn't the whole point of a journal is that it's PRIVATE, I sure don't want the whole world knowing my private thoughts and feelings...I write those down...um...well...never mind.

But, I couldn't exactly say no to Harry, who hasn't been having the best time of it lately...what am I saying, it's been AWFUL for him, his father's in hospital (I'm sure all of the US knows that) and Harry hasn't been able to see him for nearly a month. Plus the house he lives in was trashed by the accident so he can't live there. He's been staying with me and Dad and if wasn't for the circumstances that'd be pretty cool. Being an only child is a bit lonely sometimes, so it's fun having someone down the hall. And to add to that he hurt his back during Gym, so I would have felt like a total jerk telling him to forget it. Sigh!

Um...so...I can't believe I just wrote that, I guess this silly thing really does make you write about things...I guess it won't be so bad then. Still, don't expect me to update all the time like Harry does. Because unlike Harry, I do my homework at a reasonable hour every night."

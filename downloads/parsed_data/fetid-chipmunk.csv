I am very frustrated; the human abiding in this house was bringing strangers around...  Showing them everything...  And from watching all of the other humans in the box; this can only mean one thing.  Mya...  He's going to leave.
Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't mind him leaving- but I know I wont have the place to myself; there'll just be more humans moving in.  And who knows what they'll be like?  Will they tolerate my presence if they happen to discover my hiding places?  Will they own a computer like this one?  Will they have...  Cats...?
Gah!  I hate thinking about it.
What if they remodel the place????  siohgdoihcnvidofhgoifdhshvsoihvoishgdoihshv
One would think dancing on the keyboard would help.  Oh well.  I guess I can only hope for the best."

I suppose I just felt like being random.  In any case, instead of updating on this cursed machine, I am going to drown myself in some clay!
The attempt at making a few characters from ""Bubble Bobble"" should keep me busy for a little while.  Mya."

"event","Well, it's been a long month.  It doesn't quite suffice to say that I am very irritated with the weather.  Mya!  I've been sick all week due to the random drafts of frigid air that still manage to creep through my fur each night.
Oh well, nothing can be done about it.  And I can't keep typing because I can hear someone coming.


However!  I'd like to say hello to my random internet stalker!  Yay Mr./Mrs. Anonyminity!
Well, if that is even a human word.  :O"

"event","Okay, here is the update...
The human living in this environment container decided it was time for spring cleaning...  And I have no clue where to start.  He sprayed all kinds of poisonous gas and powder all over the place!  I had to live outside for most of this time.  It's okay, though, none of the other chipmunks took over my burrow under the garage.
In any case, on a few of my routine inspections of the place, I noticed the human pushing around this strange black box...  It makes a lot of noise and anything that goes near it disapears.
I wonder what this thing is?
It's quite a chore to try to stay away from the monster, too.  It has some kind of tentacle that the human sweeps under the cabinets and in the small areas where I try to hide.  How frightful it is to almost get sucked into that tube of death!  Mya!
Anyhow, that is the whole reason I haven't been able to reach this touchpad for a long while.  I'm sure nobody missed me anyhow.  What importance is there in an angry chipmunk's ranting?
Guah, you would think all of this running around and away from the locals would have gotten my legs in shape.  *sigh*  I suppose I'll be going now."

"event","<h5 align=""center"">Today is the first day I will be recording the chipmunky goodness of my days!  My paws are small and it takes me vast amounts of time to type even a sentance, but that's okay.  I have nothing better to do now that I found my way into this human-structure.

Since human-laws do not apply to me, I have found a random journal to stalk and harrass.  I am still very angry at the human-animals for experimenting on me in the first place.  If it wasn't for them I'd still be traipsing around in my once ignorant bliss; unawares of the evils around me.  Hell, and now they're doing it to mice.  I'm sure all of you human-animals have heard of it in your human-news stations.  Mya!  Who would have thought injecting human DNA into us defenseless animals would bring such ""monstrosities""?  I think I did very well to escape.  Your gas chambers will never get to me!!!

I was reading up on this fellow ""Hitler"" with my newfound abilities...  The white-coat people remind me much of him and his own white-coat people.  Experiments and torture and gas chambers.  Ch!  It makes me sad to think that just because my kind are not human-animal, we suffer the same fate they put each other through.  Mya.  Sad day.

I suppose I am done now.  My legs hurt.</h3>"

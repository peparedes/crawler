"event","UGH, I'm PISSED...apparently the tablet was a sSERIAL tablet, so it doesn't plug into my freggin laptop....okay! no problem, I'll go buy an adapter!<br /><br />I drive over to fry's during rush hour btw, and realize that I don't have my freggin wallet, so okay, I'll just see if they have it and then leave it somewhere and come back. I find a 9prong male to 9 prong male and I'm satisfied and drive back to get my wallet. I drive back over there and purchased the item and drove back home. Then I pull the adapter out and stick it on the tablet and realize that my laptop's ISN'T&nbsp;A&nbsp;9 PRONG, IT WAS&nbsp;RHE&nbsp;HD&nbsp;15 PRONG&nbsp;ONE. SHIT. So I drive back and return what I bought for store credit and decided to do the SMART&nbsp;THING&nbsp;and ask a store associate about it. He finds me one that attaches as a usb, and I'll like PERFECT. I buy the item and leave AGAIN. I attach it together and YES it's been detected! <br /><br />So I download the intuos2 driver (cuz vista sucks and doesnt believe in cds) and try to set it up. It doesn't work, then pen and mouse DON'T&nbsp;WORK, so I download the other version, same result, and then I download the last version and read the inscription and it says that it's for serial tablet and ADAPTERS&nbsp;HAVE&nbsp;UNEXPECTED&nbsp;RESULTS, so BASICALLY, it DOENS'T&nbsp;WORK EVER UNLESS&nbsp;YOU&nbsp;HAVE&nbsp;AN&nbsp;OLD&nbsp;ASS&nbsp;COMPUTER!<br /><br />okay..<span style=""font-size: x-large;"">FINE!</span> I'll use my MOM's computer cuz it has the serial plug, so I plug it in and set it up, it works! yaaaay! Not for long...<br /><br />I open photoshop and try to open a picture to start photoshopping. ERROR, your scratch disks are full! and I'm like SHIT WTF. I mean I used to have this problem ALL the time cuz I like to use up all my space on C:/ and then I just transfer and burn stuff off when that happens. NO PROBLEM, I'll just transfer files or delete them. I open My Computer and there's a bunch of drives, each have about 8 gig and I check all of the drives to see how much free space each one has and all of them are free except C:/ which has like 24 MB left...- - <br /><br />so I open that drive and check out what I can delete. ALL&nbsp;OF&nbsp;THEM&nbsp;ARE&nbsp;FREGGIN&nbsp;PROGRAM&nbsp;FILES, I can't delete any of them cuz I either don't know if they're important and 2 most of them really didn't take up that much space, like 100 MB-ish or less. I argue with my uncle about what the hell is going on and he tells me that all chinese windows softwares work like this, they take ur hdd and split the space into like 3-4 drives in which C:/ is for XP and program files. <br /><br />While we are having trouble communicating (cuz of the language), I try to explain to him that C:/ ran out of space and I can't open any programs cuz there's probably not enough RAM (which I cant figure out how much there is cuz the properties wont show me). His solution is to uninstall all the programs not needed and reinstall them later when I'm done. That's utter nonsense, who wants to spend hours resetting up all the programs, I didn't even like doing them in the first place! <br /><br />I also tried asking him if we could add space or transfer space around, or when we set up windows, can we customize how many gig we want in each drive. He either has no idea or it's a no. The only solution I can think up is 1). Set AMERICAN&nbsp;XP back on 2). Get a bigger internal and reset up the chinese one 3). Maybe see if my theories would work to customize the space values.&nbsp; Problem with 1 is that my mom needs chinese, if I set up the english one, she'll freak and ask me to fix everything and make stuff chinese. Problem with 2 is I don't understand chinese so my uncle would have to do it, which will probably make him mad to change my mom's windows AGAIN. Problem with 3 is that it's just a theory and it's most likely NOT likely.<br /><br />I'm really in angst about this stupid tablet and I'm stuck with solutions...I'm outta time to get a new tablet or change it or anything. I don't have any other computers to use except maybe my friend's but I only really do things at night and I think there's only one person's computer I can use if it even has the 9 prong serial port.<br /><br />My solutions with the tablet is 1). resell it on ebay and find a new one 2). try to get a return and pay for the shipping and find a new one 3). see if the computers in savannah will have the 9 prong serial port and plug I can use with it (cuz it needs electricity....- -)<br /><br />god it's huge...- - It's bigger than my laptop flat and my laptop isnt one of the small ones either.. <br /><br /><br />Another thing with the stupid chinese xp is that I CANT&nbsp;SCAN&nbsp;ANYTHING&nbsp;CUZ&nbsp;THE&nbsp;SCRATCH&nbsp;DISKS&nbsp;ARE&nbsp;FREGGIN&nbsp;FULL. I can't even scan 300 dpi! I was in luck to even get 200DPI. FUCK. I wanted to try for 2400 dpi too. I tried setting the scanner onto my laptop but for SOME&nbsp;ODD&nbsp;REASON, there's an error, so it can't be used....stupid vista...I hate vista, I hate serial ports, I hate CHINESE&nbsp;XP and it's REALLY&nbsp;STUPID&nbsp;METHOD&nbsp;OF&nbsp;MEMORY. I mean seriously?! What IF&nbsp;you run out of space like me! THEN&nbsp;WHAT&nbsp;DO&nbsp;YOU&nbsp;DO FUCKTARDS?! I'm so freggin pissed about this. - -<br /><br /><br />I've wasted like 10 hours and I still have shit to do on my shitty laptop where the wireless mouse doesnt work properly b/c it keeps disconnecting for some reason and the touchpad acts up ALL the time. CAN'T&nbsp;EVEN&nbsp;SCAN, which I need a high quality picture SHIT.<br /><br />I thought maybe if the tablet didn't work, I could just use the my old tablet and the new pen, but I guess it's that intuos2 came before the graphire3 so it doesnt work...Does anybody know if a newer pen works on an older tablet?<br /><br />"

After I discovered it, I emptied the rest of the gas into the gas tank of my car. I left the windows open to air out the smell, but it never went away. I checked the back later and found my air compressor glued to the carpet. The gas eroded the plastic on the compressor so it took me like half an hour to peel the compressor off the carpet. I went back to my room reeking of gasoline.<br /><br />A few days later, I was sick of the smell and it hit me. The rest of the gas leaked through the carpet and is probably now in a puddle at the bottom of the trunk with the wheel. I lift the carpet and my suspicions were right (my blonde moments....- - ). I was like shit shit shit! So I went to Walmart to get it fixed and they said I should go to the car wash. I sat in the cold for like 2 hours waiting for them to finish. It was cheaper than I expected, so I was happy. Good thing I didn't have to drive two days with the sickening smell. It still kinda smells right now though.....- -<br /><br />Don't judge me....&gt;____&lt;<br /><br /><br /><img src=""http://i274.photobucket.com/albums/jj279/shiawase-chan/SCAD%20Campus/DSCF0194.jpg"" style=""width: 251px; height: 188px;"" alt="""" /><br /><br />This really bothers me why there's a hole in the parking lot....It leads to never never land. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Sankyuu fo reading&nbsp;XD<br />&nbsp;</div><br /> <br /><br />"

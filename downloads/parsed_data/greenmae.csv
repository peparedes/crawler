<div style=""text-align: center;"">My Cleaning Lady

So we spent a minute or two trying to figure out what the hell it meant, then I decided the driver is an Asian lady. So I pulled up next to her, and sure enough it was.

Then On our way home, I got hungry, so we stopped in an Orange County ghetto-ish area (still nowhere near as ghetto as anything in San Diego), and we saw a Mexican Wal Mart. It was just like Wal Mart, except it was El Mart. Yessssss..."

"event","Today was weird.

I woke up to get ready for work, and thought ""Darn, darn darn, darn, darn... I need to take a shower, but it sounds like my dad is in the shower, so now i'm going to be late for work."" Then I thought I heard him talking to himself. So, I was still in bed, thinking the shower was occupied, and my dad was in there talking to himself, because he does that. It's not the first time I've heard him talking to himself in the shower. Then I thought I heard him laugh... and he sounded just like my brother. Only, I heard it from the living room. And that's sooooo creepy because my brother has a reallly really unique sounding laugh... So first of all I was like ""Wow, Paul actually <i>inherited</i> that laugh from Dad? That is freaky."" And then I was thinking, ""Is my dad in the shower or in the living room?"". So I got uout of bed, put on my pajamas, and checked. My dad was in the shower. And my brother was in the living room. With some guy.

WHAT IS MY BROTHER DOING HERE???? Nobody had any clue he came home. He didn't even know he was coming home. His submarine just happened to stop in San Diego for a few days!!!! YAY!!! I'm so happy!!!

And what a coincidence that it happened TODAY, when my aunt and uncle who we haven't seen in a few years came to town to visit and were having a party!!! My whole family back together again for the first time in several years, and most importantly, my BROTHER!!! I love him! And my uncle just came back from Iraq, he's a Naval surgeon and he had to travel around with the troops in Iraq to take care of them. He lost so much weight. And my brother gained some. Hehe.

And my brother brought me presents from Pearl Harbor! First of all, I got a Marilyn Monroe postcard from him last week, which was a photograph of her autographed to some ship.. Then today he gave me an Elvis shirt that he got from the Hard Rock Cafe in Hawaii, a tin lunch box with that ""We Can Do It!"" Rosie the Riveter WWII picture on it, a mug with a WWII poster that says ""Good Work Sister... We never figured you could do a man-size job! America's Women have met the test!"" and a shot glass from the Hard Rock cafe in Hawaii. Isn't my brother awesome??

But anyways, I came home from work today, and that guy was still at my house. Alone. And I guess he thought I was rude, because when I woke up, I just asked my brother very bluntly, ""Who's he???"" and then later when I got home and this strange man I dont' know was just sitting in my house watching tv by himself was there, I said ""What are you doing here?""

But what would <i>you</i> say?

Anyways, his name is Alan, and it turns out we have a lot in common! And my brother just left him at our house from 3 in the afternoon, til just now, so I ended up hanging out with him all afternoon. He's from LA, but he lived in San Diego, and he played in a bunch of the local rockabilly bands, and he knows everyone I know, and all this stuff, and we're into all the same things.... And he's been in the Navy for 16 years, so he's traveled all around the world, and so we talked about Hawaii because I told him my boyfriend is stationed there and that I lived there briefly, and it turns out he was stationed there for 6 years. Plus he's been all over the Orient, so he knows a lot about my Vietnamese culture, and he's been to all of the places I've been to, and we like all the same things (actually that's not true... he hates psychobilly), and love going to all the same places. And his tattoos are way cooler than mine. Yeah, they're that cool. But you know what really really impressed me??? He used to play with Josie Kreuzer! He had to stop, because he's in the Navy and couldn't travel with her, and besides he (I can't believe this) <i>doesn't like her</i>. He thinks she's a Wanda Jackson rip-off. She is, but I still like her. In fact, I think she's way better. I put a song or two of hers on that mixed cd that I made for Mickey, and he loved her too... I love that Mickey and I have so much in common and share the same interests. Only, I don't think he wants to be with me anymore. I think that's really very much his loss though. I guess I'm not worth the very little effort it takes to pick up the phone and say ""I love you"". ='-( His loss.

But we may all (my brother, Alan and I) go to Disneyland on Monday! If my brother wants to go though, because I think that's pretty creepy just going with his friend and not him. In fact, I thought it was pretty creepy that my brother just left him here with me all day."

$ in swear jar: $3 (I did get mad at this horrible bitch at work, and say ""But she was a BITCH!!!"" really loud in front of the customers, and I got in trouble for it, but it was well worth it. Because she really was a bitch, and totally ruined my night until I started talking about almond desserts with someone else... And I don't think I should charge myself for calling the btich a bitch, because she was a bitch and deserves to be called a bitch, and I should charge her for making me have to point it out.)
cigarettes: 1 (I shared one with someone, because the bitch got me so stressed out)
$ spent: None! Well technically $2.00 on laundry, but that's laundry and it was all quarters anyways.
meals eaten: 2
cups of water: 2

Otherwise, my day was really very very uneventful. Mickey told me it was Tuesday and I wanted to cry because I was really convinced it was later in the week. At least it's Wednesday now. And I better register for classes this fall, now! I was supposed to register last Thursday. Bad Mae!"

$ in swear jar: $12 (Heavens to Betsy! There's no reason for that)
cigarettes: 0 (I didn't work or drink, so there's no reason why I would now that I've quit)
$ spent: $216.54
meals eaten: 2.5
cups of water: 1
tattoos: 1

Okay so for money spent, that's pretty bad, but it was my day off, and I got a new tattoo... so I spent $200 on the tattoo (I'm a generous tipper), and only $16.54 on food and drink, and none of it on clothing or accessories or trinkets and knick-knacks....

So Fatima and I went shopping, but didn't buy anything... The ladies at Sephora told me that they can pretty much guarantee that the burning rash on my face is from the benzoyl peroxide, and I think they're right because I don't recall using the Pond's Cold Cream last time my face did that thing, but I do remember using Clearasil, whose main ingredient is benzoyl peroxide. So they gave me two oil-free moisturizers for my face, but I still like Jane Light Energy oil-free moisturizer better, because it makes my face feel almost lifted off. It really is light! Plus it's much cheaper because it's a drug-store brand.

I also dragged Fatima to Tiffany's... hehehe. I tried to make them find me a pair of diamond earrings as beautiful and big as my grandmothers. They tried, and found something not as beautiful, about the same size, and the price tag read something like $20,184.00. And then the guy asked me if I wanted to try them on, and I told him that was gross, then he asked me if I wanted to take them home, and I laughed at him.

Then we looked at a really expensive clothing store, and afterwards, everything else looked like crap. It really helped out with our desire to spend money. So then we went to Subway. I love Subway.

Afterwards, we went to my house to pick up some of the clothes and stuff that I needed to get rid of, and sold them to The Buffalo Exchange. I did get myself a jacket and Fatima a new shirt, but I didn't spend a dime on them because I <i>traded</i> clothes that I was going to donate anyways. And I still donated a bunch of clothes, so I did do one humanitarian thing today, and there will be a bunch of homeless people at the shelter looking very hot in my leopard overalls and other things, I tell you.

Later, walking down Garnet Ave., two transients stopped us. They weren't bums, really... their clothes were clean and all... But they were street people. They were obviously drinking (I don't know what gave it away, the fact that they were sitting on the street with a bunch of beer cans, the smell, or their belligerent behavior). One had a guitar and the other had a beer, and for some regrettable reason, I stopped when they said ""Hey, you girls are really beautiful, and we play you a beautiful song."" I thought that might be kind of nice, so I let them, and gave them a dollar for it, even though I know it's going to buy booze. But then, things blew up in my face! They asked us if we had boyfriends and at first I said no, and then quickly said ""But she's like... engaged and I have a boyfriend who lives in Hawaii."" Which, I don't think the drunk stinky guy heard, because then he asked me if I wanted to go to the movies with him. I just said ""No."" So then he told me I was pretty again, and even prettier than Adrienne, as I was walking away, but twhen I heard the Adrienne thing I stopped! I said ""Who is Adriene?"", thinking ""You better not f--king say Rocky Balboa's wife, 'cause I'll shoot you."" And that's of course when he said ""Isn't she pretiier than Adrienne? Rocky's wife?"" I got so fucking pissed off, and yelled at him, because I hate Adrienne and he's not the first person to compare me to her, and I dont' think I look anything like her. I think she's ugly; I always have. So, he apologized and then he gave me a HUG!!! EW!!! Then he tried to hug Fatima, and she practically ran away saying ""I dont' think my fiance would appreciate that!"" And then we left.

Fatima and I met up with Laheqa at the Coffee Bean, and we had coffee and cheesecake.

Then I left by myself to go get gas, and went to Stephanie's house. From there Stephanie and I went to the tattoo shop.

So I saw Shannon for the first time since December. It was nice to see him again, but we got kind of annoyed with eachother for different reasons. He did my newest tattoo. A Sailor Jerry traditional rose on my shoulder. I like it a lot.

Then Stephanie and I got some burritos and horchatas at Ramiro's, and went to some lame frat party. On a Monday. In the summer. I left early. F--cking frat boys. That's probably why I swore so much yesterday... I had to make fun of the frat boys. Ick.

$ in swear jar today: $4. (kinda bad, but I had a long conversation with Mickey today and that's when I slip up the most, even though we were getting along. If we had been fighting  I'd owe like $50)
cigarettes: 0 (wonderful)
$ spent shopping:  $59.81 (horrible! $53.34 of it was on credit card too. That's bad. Plus I thought I was supposed to get a 20% discount for using their credit line, and I don't see that on my receipt. I'll stop by tomorrow and ask if the credit card people take it out later on my bill or if they just didn't give me my discount.)

But it was funny/cute--- both of my parents made sure to remind me it was my brother's birthday, as though we should be doing something about it. My mom called me the other day and said ""You know tomorrow is Paul's birthday, are you doing anything?"" Well what can I really do? Invite him out to dinner? He's in a submarine. He can't even get phone calls or mail. And my dad made sure to remind me yesterday ""You know, today's your brother's birthday, right?"" Of course I know, but... what should I be doing about it? He doesn't even have an e-mail address I can reach him at because he doesn't do e-mail.

Speaking of work... LAST week, my manager tried to SEND ME HOME because my skirt on the uniform <b>he gave me to borrow</b> was too short... TODAY, we got audited, and overall, we got only 52% on our uniforms, but I got like a standing ovation/auditor nearly wet herself, because I've got the catseyes glasses, 50's letterman style sweater, saddle shoes, and my hair in the cute little roll with a little red rosebud in it, plus my nametag says Mae which just happens to be an old lady name anyways (people actualy ask me if they make us wear fake nametags with old lady names when they see mine)... which nobody, not even the managers seem to know that the rule book specifically says that the only exceptions to plain white sweaters are red and white letterman style sweaters, the only exception to white skid-resistant shoes are black and white or red and white saddle shoes, and the only color hair accassories that are acceptable are red and white. So the next time they try to yell at me or send me home or make me take my earplugs out or whatever, I'll just remind them that I got them extra credit on their still-failing audit, because I'm just that damn cute. Yeah, that's why little kids ask me if I'm Ruby. And Ruby is hot. At least the cartoon Ruby is hot. If you see pictures of the real Ruby, she's kinda yucky. But just kinda.

Mickey agreed to design my ""Mi Mengke"" tattoo, which is really nice, I think, because not only does it have a lot of meaning because of what it is, but it'll be an extra special piecee because he'll have designed it. Don't ask what Mi Mengke means, it makes no freaking sense. I almost said the other ""f"" word, that would have been another dollar in my swear jar...

Yeah, I'm putting a dollar in my savings account everytime I swear now. Not to mention 40% of my paychecks, tips, and whatever other money I happen to chance upon. I'm such an awesome saver! I'm wondering if I should start putting away ALL of my paychecks and using tuips as spending money or stick to this method. I wonder which way I'd save more. I'll keep doing it this wayfor a few more weeks, but at the same time keep a log and do the math of how much it'd be if I had done it the other way.

All in a heartbeat, everything that I was excited and happy to be living for was shattered. Every goal was on such thin ice that it all fell right through in a snap. And now I feel like I don't ever want to be happy again. It's not worth it because happiness is so fake. My stupid friends don't make me happy. Going out doesn't make me happy. It all keeps me busy but it doesn't makes me happy. I don't have anything. And I don't want this fake shit anymore. I don't want to get in a relationship and think that it's all good and that I'm totally happy and it's good to be alive, just so it can be taken from me in an instant.

I wish I were dead. I'd rather be dead than experience this stupid emotional rollercoaster of life. I don't want to be happy anymore. It's not worth it. I'd rather be miserable all the time because then at least I'd get used to it and learn to live with it. I don't want anymore friends. I don't want anything. I want to die, painfully, my body to be cut up and thrown into an organ grinder, the pieces to be blown up and the ashes to be paved into the streets and sidewalks so people can walk all over me and spit on me and shit on me and physically do everything they do emotionally to my heart now.

It's always been my belief that if you have no purpose in life, in this world, that you may as well kill yourself. You should kill yourself. Because you're worthless. A lot of you are worthless. I mean, you're my friends, you're on my friends list and all, and I like you, but reading through your journals, I find that your lives aren't worth a damn. You're just floating through. Like me. Get pissed off if you want, but you know what? If you know you're living for something, if you know you have a purpose, then you have no reason to get pissed off. If you're feeling guilty, then yeah, I'm talking about you.

I'm worthless. I have no purpose. Nothing that I'm living for or doing. My life is completely meaningless. My existence is inconsequential and doesn't mean a damn thing to anyone. And I feel like noody would miss me, and I wouldn't miss very much if I were to die.

I need to change that.. I need to find a reason to live, and a reason to be here. I need to be needed.

Even something as simple yet wonderful and important as being a mother... But apparently, according to some jerk, I'm unfit to be a parent.

Ugh, what am I living for? I have nothing. No hopes, dreams, goals future. And I'm terribly depressed, and am only a burden to others. I'm a burden to this world.

I've always wanted to adopt an abused child. I mean a seriously abused child. There are so many, you wouldn't even believe some of the stories. I've heard stories about a 7 year old girl whose mother sent her out in the middle of the night to go pick up her cocaine, and the little girl was beaten up on her way to go pick it up. Afraid to go home without the drugs, she sat at the bus stop with a bloody nose and cried until a stranger found her, took her to the hospital, where they discovered that the 7 year old girl was infected with several (something like 16) STD's. Her mother had her 7 year old daughter prostituting to get her money for drugs.

I've also heard stories about children who have come to a certain organization that heps out these seriously abused children... and this one girl in particular came in and her body and face and hands were warped beyond recognition because her mother would punish her by making her put her hands in boiling scalding water, and put out her cigarettes on the girl's back... It was so unbelievable to the home that adopted her, and later when they came back to tell the organization's hospital about the story of their girl, thinking that it was such a memorable case that they couldn't forget her, they found that the organization didn't even know who they were talking about because they have had SOOOOO many heinous cases like that, that she wasn't much different than all the other children that come in there.

I have a lot of love in my heart and I feel like it would be best spent on those children. I think they deserve it. That's who I want to give my love to. No more wasting it on the unappreaciating undeserving people. People like me. They don't even have to love me back, I'll be happy just giving them all my love. If they don't appreciate love, at least they have a reason. Not like spoiled brats like me and you. YOU. You know who you are. If you can't love others, at least apreciate the love they give to you.

At this point, in all serioiusness, it's coming down to either ending this meaningless existence because i'm not worth the air I breathe, or doing something to change the world, even if it's just a little bit. It's more than I do now."

People are terrible. After a good talk with Mickey about some of it the other night, I felt reassured that he wasn't one of them. I just don't know where people's morals have gone. In the 50's, when you got married, you stayed married and you honored that as much as you humanly could. Divorce was a last last last resort. It seems like, at least from the older people that I know, and television and stuff, that divorce was almost unheard of back then. Now people have no respect for the mothers of their children, they give up so easily! I know people who are in their 80's who have been married since their teens. And now the average marriage lasts only 7 years.

And my generation, they give themselves away so easily. They have sex with people they don't love. Or in certain people's cases, [this section has been edited out to respect that immoral person's privacy]

But seriously, my generation is so stupid. They're all cheaters and have no concept of monogamy. All of them. Plus, they're also stupid. I mean stupid. What the hell is it? Something in our water? Society? TV? Why are they all so fucking dumb and disrespectful? I guess it's not bad enough that they disrespect themselves. They have to disrespect their ""significant"" (not so significant in my eyes) others, their parents, and anyone else that stands in the way of their stupid, narrow-minded, immature, naive little desires.

And for heaven's sake, the girls that guys pick! Any little tart in a teeny little shirt and low-rise jeans, that has no personality, wit, brains, style, or anything desirable. I guess they deserve what they get, since they're just going to use them, and hurt them, and cheat on them anyways. Those girls get what they're looking for, and those guys get theirs too. And I guess when you're that stupid and naive, everyone's happy.

Men shouldn't be awarded penises until they've aquired some sense and maturity.

And girls should focus a little more on building their personalities, minds, and a little class if they ever want to become real women. I feel like the audience on Jenny Jones, but a man isn't worth a damn if he's just with you for the skimpy little outfits your wear and your lack of judgement when you're under the influence.

Of course, this is all with the exception of my Muslim friends. At least they have morals."

I think I know this song. How come I already know the lyrics?"" But I couldn't put my finger on who sang it first and where I'd heard it and why I knew it. It sounds a lot like a really depressed version of Elton John's ""Your Song"".

I just realized it's a cover of a NIN song. ""Hurt"".

It's so good though. ...It's like butter.

So, today is my first day off since last Monday, and my only day off until next Monday, unless I have to work at my other job next Monday, which is likely, so it's probably my last day off ever. Isn't that dirty? Oh well, my other job is cake. It's not really working. It's just getting paid.

And I have so much to do today:

<strike>-Eat chocolate
-Watch tv in my pajamas
-Listen to Johnny Cash</strike>
-Cash my paycheck
-Get gas
-Go shopping (not for fun, though)
-Get my uniform dress hemmed for work (or do it myself... not likely)
-Pick up my pictures from Disneyland!
-A pedicure would be nice if I have time
-Clean
-Wash and clean out my cars
-Watch Monster Garage"

"event","I just had a dream that I had three sons named Alvin, Simon, and Theodore... 

Didn't Dave consider Alvin, Simon, and Theodore his sons? Even though they were chipmunks? Really HUGE chipmunks. The size of normal kids. They weren't mutant chipmunks like the turtles, either, were they? They were just big. Besides, the turtles were raised by a rat, not a crazy dude. 

Anyways, I'm talking about the fucking chipmunks, not the turtles. They were chipmunks who wore long shirts and tennis shoes and they were the size of normal kids and the went to school and juggled a singing career and everything. That's a lot for a regular kid to handle, let alone a fucking chipmunk with a confused ""father"" who treats his pets like they are his children.

Was Dave gay? Wait, no, I think he dated women, he just wasn't married. And he was kinda fruity. I mean taking chipmunks and dressing them up like kids and all. You gotta be kinda lonely.

That show was the shit.

And they had chipmunk girlfriends!!! Some other bitch was crazy enough to also think that her pet chipmunks were her daughters! And they had the same exact story. Raised by a human, wore dresses, got sent to school even though they were chipmunks, and had a singing career. Brittany, Jeanette, and... what's Theodore's girlfriend's name?

I remember when they sang Girls Just Want to Have Fun. That was the shit.

But someone help me out here, what was the other Chipette's name?"

<b>Let's redefine the terms ""rape"" and ""date rape"" for all the college sophomores out there: Being pressured into having sex that you regret the next morning does not mean you were raped. Being seduced does not mean you were raped, nor does consenting to sex when you were drunk or high. If someone is pressuring you or seducing you or hitting on you when you're drunk or high, and you try to get up and leave or tell him to stop, and he physically prevents you from leaving and forces you to have sex with him against your will -- that's rape. If it happens on a date, that's date rape.</b>"

Yes I did. Did I ever get my foot out of my mouth? No I didn't. Did I look cute today? Let's put it this way: I saw my mom today, and she kept asking who hit me, and is convinced I'm in an abusive relationship thanks to the make-up I put on to fake an eye infection. I put on make up that make me look like I got my ass kicked.

Okay, I'm over it. Sometimes it's fun to make an ass of yourself and laugh about it.

Today I went to get my nails done, and my 6th grade teacher walked in and without even looking at my face, just seeing my profile, she goes ""Mae Workman, you were in my class, right?"" It's just so amazing to me that she'd recognize me so instantaneously without really even seeing my face after all these years. I mean I was a little tiny Mae. 11-12 years old. And it was a wonderful blast from the past, too. She was an awesome teacher.

Another awesome teacher called me the other day, only he turned out to be very shady after I graduated. It was my high school auto shop teacher. He was cool in high school, but right after I graduated, he tried to date me. And he's just now finalizing his divorce an moving out of his wife's house. BLECH!

The other day, on my break, I was watching an injured bee struggling, hobbling about, and I thought to myself... ""It sucks to be an injured bee because nobody wants to help you out."" ...Not that there was much I could do for it anyways.

Oh, and Mickey's going to Afghanistan in January. I'm pretty bummed about that. I'm not too worried, because the war's over and he's just going there for peace keeping, besides he's in Intelligence, so he doesn't have to do too much dangerous combat shit anyways, but it sucks 'cause we wont' get to talk except for occasional e-mails and letters for several months.

Stray Cats were really good, but it was so surreal having a legendary band up there in front of me, I couldn't quite grasp the hugeness of it. Otherwise, the Hootenanny was really hot, and I was surrounded by the most gorgeous women on the face of the earth (including <lj user=""rocknrollqueen"">)

So tomorrow, I'm gonna dye my hair black (my boss is making me, but I don't really mind. Just hope my hair doesn't fall out), and then go apply for a second job. A morning job. Probably at a breakfast restaurant or something."

Yesterday, Stephanie and I went to the fair, and we had lots of fun.... The best thing about the fair is the food, of ourse, but I wasn't that hungry, so all I got was the best strawberry lemonade I've ever had in my life, a REALLY good cinnamon roll with melty cream cheese frosting, and a blooming onion which wasn't all that good. It kind of sucked because the blooming onion was the whole reason I was looking forward to the fair and I was so disappointed!

Then we rode a bunch of those carnie fair rides, and I've never ridden the rides at the fair before. It's just that I don't trust them... they set them up in like a day! I ended up getting nauseous... From all those rides that flip you upside down all over the place. And this one that I rode, I think it was called evolution... well, I didn't fit in the harness,  my shoulders came through the middle, and I had to hold on for dear life not to fall out of it! I hate carnie rides! Except tilt-a-whirls and that kind of little kid shit.

And then yay!!!! I go to the Hootenanny tomorrow!

Only, I've only randomly met Taira like twice, she's not really my friend, we don't talk or anything, so when I got an e-mail out of the blue which said ""FOR YOUR EYES ONLY""  from someone named Taira Chaudry, I thought it must be porn because that even sounds like a porn name, and I don't know her well enough to think right off the bat that it's obviously her.

So, I kept getting those e-mails from her, and I don't get porn, or any spam in my mail really, because I don't really give my e-mail address out, and finally I got pissed and went to go block her, and realized it was Taira! Taira Taira!

So... the other day I got an e-mail from Ginger L. or something, and it said ""Far East Females"". And I'm thinking ""What the fuck, why am I getting porn now? Maybe I better open it, because it might be someone wth a surprise birthday some shit whatever like Taira..."" so I opened it and it was from xxxasians.com. How they got my e-mail, I don't know, I don't get spam ever!

So today I got another one! It's from Amy J., and it says ""Chicks dig hooves."" Yeah, that sounds weird and disgusting, and I'm not even going to check this one to make sure. Plus, if it's anything like what I'm trying not to imagine, I hope those people are arrested and given the death penalty or something.

Sorry kids, but Mae needs to vent!

I think Jon, one of the host/cashiers, is on drugs. Probably speed. Or maybe diet pills with ephedrin? Whatever, he's either nuts or he's under th influence of something. First of all, nobody can stand to work with him, because it's impossible! He's all over the place, he talks non-stop and it makes no sense, he can't seem to dress himself properly, he sweats like a frickin... i don't even know what... he quadruple seats servers when there are tables open in other sections (meaning that a sever will get bombarded with 4 tables in his/her section all at once, which is really hard on the server to take care of all the people at the same time... usually you wait until all of the tables in a section at least have drinks before you seat another table), and you can't tell him anythign because he doesn't listen. When he first got on a cash drawer, he didn't know how to do credit card sales, so none of the servers got their tips, and today his drawer was $88 short!!! I get frustrated if my drawer is a dollar off. And any more than that makes you officially a) retarded or b) a thief.

Then there's Betty. How do you solve a problem like Betty? Betty has gotten on my nerves since my first day!!! But today I've fucking had it. She has such an attitude problem, and the customers complain about it, and one of them left a comment card with me tonight with a really minor complaint about Betty... somethng about her not being prompt with her drinks (but I know she gave them attitude because I saw her getting the drinks and complaining about it). The comment card of course was supposed to go to the manager, but Betty caught wind of this comment card, and took it from me and ripped it up. Then, she went on her break, and she walked out the door and it was pretty busy up front, so we didn't notice the mat outside had gotten all bunched up and was propping the door open a little bit. So she goes ""Hey hostess/cashiers"" and pointed out the rug, which she was standing next to, practically on top of, at the door, and rather than fixing it herself she just left it as though we were servants!!! If you see something wrong, fix it, even if it's not technically your job, that's what fucking teamwork is. But what's worse is she refers to us as ""hostess cashiers"".  OKAY??? We have names. We have nametags. She knows our names. But she calls us, ""Hey hostess cashiers."" She could go ""Hey Laura and Mae"", but no, she doesn't. She doesn't treat us like we're even human. And she complains if she gets double seated with two small tables of like 2, on busy nights when the line is out the door and other servers are voluntarily taking on like 9 or 10 tables (the sections are only 6 tables to a server, 5 on really busy nights). Next time she even tries to complain about getting double seated, I'm going to yell ""Look, Cesar and Danny have 9 or 10 tables, and are volunteering to get triple and quadruple seated, with groups of like 10, so if you can't handle getting double seated, you don't belong here and you can just go the fuck home."" So then I hear her complaining about that customer who wanted a refill on her drink and she got pissed off because she didn't want to be treated like some ""lowlife"" waitress! But you know, she treats us like ""lowlife"" hostess/cashiers. Plus today, she began bragging about how she's been dating one of the old managers, and has been doing so since he was still working at our store, which is strictly forbidden (but explains why she hasn't been fired with such a bitchy attitude). So since she's always bitching and I mean BITCHING about getting double seated, we didn't give her many tables tonight, and she of course made a bitchy comment to me about it, and how we're costing her money. Whatever bitch, if you want money, then learn take extra tables without complaining, and be nice to the people who are in charge of seating your tables. And for fuck's sake, learn their names."

I was thinking maybe I'd go and get some fine line/realistic work done... and get a huge picture of the Bride of Frankenstein there... and then maybe one day I'll get Frankenstein on the other side, or maybe not. Or I can get a traditional sailor-jerry-ish design with a bunch of stuff in it. or some day-of-the-dead and other mexican artwork... Anyways, one thing's for sure, I know where it's gonna be.

Las Vegas was kinda bunk. I was giong to take my own car, but Chris and Ida convinced me to drive up with them, and then their friends would drive me home. So I drove up with them, that was cool, but then I met their friends, and I hated them. They were spawns of Satan. Anyways, they were my ride home, so the whole time yesterday, I was sitting in the car thinking to myself ""I can't wait to get out of this car, I wish they'd shut up, I can't stand being with these people, I want to get out of this car, I hope they stop making stops and traffic goes faster and they floor it so I can get the hell home and away from these people. I'm gonna try to take a nap so I won't have to endure as much of them..."" and that's about when their car broke down. In the middle of the Mojave Desert, out in nowhere. I was stuck with them on the side of the road from about 5:30 until about 11:00, when the tow truck finally arrived, and took us to Barstow, when my dad came and rescued me a bit past midnight. They're still there, at a hotel room, waiting for their car to get fixed. I feel sorry for them, even though I don't like them. That totally sucks. Yesterday was miserable and I didn't get home until about 3:00 a.m. My poor dad had to drive all the way out to Barstow from Arizona, pick me up, take me ome to San Diego at, arriving at 3:00 a.m., and then leave to go back to Arizona today.

Plus, another thing I don't like about travelling in other states, is the smoking indoors thing. I don't think I'm prudish or anything, I mean, I do smoke, but I like that we have a law here about not smoking indoors. It's just respectful to other people. It's not a big deal in a huge casino where everyone's an adult anyways, but there were times when I was with a 1 year old and a 4 year old, in places like hallways and elevators and tiny monorail cars, and people would smoke right there in the little enclosed space with small children coughing in front of them. And they have cigarette vending machines! Okay? Anyone can use a vending machine! That's horrible!"

Like dirty ass. Yes, that's it. A family of DIRTY ASS died in my room this weekend. I'll find it tomorrow morning. Tonight I think I'll sleep in the living room.

It's been a long day, I'll write all about it after I find the dead dirty ass family in my room tomorrow."

At the end there's that chick that says ""From what I can see here, it's ALLLLLLL good!"" Okay, isn't that chick scary looking??? I close my eyes or turn my head or turn the channel really quick whenever it comes on, because I hate looking at her face, or even thinking about what it looks like when my eyes are closed but I can still hear her saying ""From what I can see here, it's ALLLL good!"", and I can still see her fucking face in my head, perfectly. Why is she so scary?

I just finished registering for summer classes. Most of the classes I wanted were ful because I am not a responsible adult, and waited until 2 days after registration started before I registered.

Now I have to pack my shit for Las Vegas, because we're leaving at noon tomorrow, and I have to meet them at their house, so I'll be leaving here probably around 11:00 tomorrow morning. But my uncle Scott just called, and he's also leaving for Las Vegas tomorrow, which is cool, because they have a really nice house out there, and he said he has an extra ticket for Crosby Stills and Nash... Uhm.. I don't know about that one. I think I'll be busy doing some much better stuff. It is, after all, Las Vegas.

I also hurt my neck this morning because I was standing on my head to try to confuse my cat. I used to be able to stand on my head forever, and now I practically break my neck and all I did was like a slow somersault.

Mickey was pissing me off last night because I hate talking to him on the phone when Steve is in the room with him, because he won't talk, or if he does, he speaks in really incomplete sentences, and he acts differently, like he doesn't want Steve to know what we're talking about or be sweet to me in front of Steve because he'll feel like an ass-kisssing pussy-whipped bitch, and makes fun of serious situations in order to amuse Steve, and plays the ""Let's ask Steve what he thinks"" game, so I end up yelling, ""TELL STEVE TO SHUT THE FUCK UP AND MIND HIS OWN FUCKING BUSINESS!!!!!"". Then as soon as I got so pissed off about it, and I told him to leave whatever room Steve was in, he did, and all of a sudden, he started acting like a perfect angel. But he <i>still</i> insists that he doesn't act any different when Steve's around."

"event","I've been thinking about Shannon a lot lately, and it's weird, because on Thursday night, I had this long, long conversation with Fatima about him, and then we saw him! We drove past him, and he was riding his bike... Isn't that weird??? Then the next night, I was working, and Shannon's boss, Shawn came in with some chick, and he started telling her about how Shannon knows me... So at this point I'm stunned because it's crazy enough that I've been thinking about him so much lately for no damn reason, but then I think Shawn told Shannon that I work there, because two days later I think he came in. I couldn't tell for sure if it was him... It looked like him, but he was wearing a cap and sunglasses and had a goatee type thing. He wasn't even eating in the restaurant, he was outside, but he walked in and right up to me and asked for change for a $50, and then asked me how my neck was! And I have no reason for someone to ask me how my neck is, I don't have neck problems or anything, except Shannon did the tattoo on my neck... and this guy acted like he knew me... but he didn't have Shannon's voice, and if it was Shannon, then he got some new tattoos on his arm. If it wasn't Shannon, then some hot guy likes to ask random people how their necks are.

And then last night Fatima and I saw an old preppy Asian man skateboarding, and for some reason, it was so funny to me that I'm posting it in my livejournal."

Well, my boss made me dye it black, which is fine, i had wanted to anyways, but my hair was so fucking damaged... But I really didn't think there was anything wrong with my red hair! I mean there are girls with big chunky bleached streaks in their hair and white-ass bleach blonde hair at my work. Anyways I dyed it black and all.. and yesterday he and I were going through the color-coded chart to see who was serving what tables, and it turns out the motherfucker is color-blind!!! He can't tell red from green! He couldn't tell me what half the colors on the chart were! No wonder he made me dye my pretty red hair."

"event","I haven't figured out what I'm going to do today. It's Andrew's birthday and he wanted to me come up (he lives in North Hollywood) for a barbecue thing, but then he called last night to tell me it was probably gonna be cancelled because last week, he said it was gonna be ""...next Thursday, May 7th"", and the 7th is actually Wednesday (today), so some of his friends got the day off tomorrow, and some got today off. But he wanted me to come up and hang out anyways, and I haven't decided if I'm going to...

Mickey wouldn't appreciate it too much if I did. And I like it when Mickey takes my feelings into consideration when making decisions like that (though he rarely does, Mr. Makes-plans-with-his-friends-on-our-anniversary-and-my-birthday), so I think I should take his into consideration (even if he doens't always return the favor). If I asked Mickey for permission, he'd reluctantly say yes, because he can't think of a real reason why I shouldn't be friends with Andrew... as long as we don't have sex... which we definitely won't... but I know inside he still wouldn't want me to go.

I also really want to go visit Olivia and her baby today. I haven't seen her in weeks! I could put it off 'til tomorrow and visit Andrew since it <b>is</b> his birthday... Or just wait 'til Saturday because Oly and I definitely have plans that day... We don't know just what yet, but we know it'll involve alcohol and man-bashing, so anyone who wants in on that action (<b>CHRISTINE AND TERESA</b>, I'm looking in your direction), call me up.

What I really <b>should</b> do today is clean this place up, though.

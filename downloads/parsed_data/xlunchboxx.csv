"event","well it's offically been 2 years. just makes me think about all the shit i;ve been through, all i;ve missed out on, and all the aggravation it's caused. sometimes it makes you wonder if it was all worth it. at times it seemed like i;d been sitting in the sidelines watching everyone else live their lives. christ, i don;t want to even think about all the money and hours i put into this. 
any way, thanks to all of you who have stood by me, and pushed me forward when times seemed bleak. sorry i missed out on so much, but it was all worth it in the end. 
please don;t make me do it again."

remember people, this is very important. you can not judge someone based on their way of life, style of dress, ect. except...... if they hang out at the mall. then they are free game.

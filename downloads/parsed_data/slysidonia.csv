I made several large handbuilt pedestal bowls. Put two in the kiln to be fired tomorrow. 
Before I forget,wanted to say thanks to my friend D.Sibley, over on DeviantArt for making a icon picture with my art in it. I love it so!
We are planning a little weekend away at Bend . it has been two years since we've been there. Going to take the big girl, she loves he state park trips. She is so good to travel with, We love having her with us. Lil' pup will have to be boarded, she is too noisy at this time of her life to take, plus she gets carsick. I have someone lined up to watch the house and take care of Pea.
All that is left is to make the motel reservations.
In store news,the debit card machine will be arriving in two weeks. Very exciting to be able to take debit and credit cards for the first time. We have been cash only for years.
Hope I can keep up with the changes."

I think I need to be there longer to get everything packed and shipped. Found out the main Dealer i buy from will let me shop over a couple day period and my Gem/Mineral distributor will hold it until i am ready to pay and ship at the show. This is Big deal for me- that means they think of me as a steady customer.
I have to buy more malachite this year. and it is so heavy to ship. I'm going to hate lugging it around. Wish I had a buying assistant, lol."

D is so happy his suggestion to carry wood puzzles Is a big success. We have sold about a dozen puzzles of all kinds since we debuted with them Friday.
I must re-order early tomorrow so they can ship the second half of my order. We are looking forward to seeing what we will get next.

"event","Making Lamb stew tonight using scrap lamb pieces from the butcher. I put carrots beans and potatoes in it from the garden. I added store bought onion, garlic, and will add some frozen corn at the end .
The garden is still chugging away although some of the pattypan squash plants are reaching the end of their productive stage. I get about 5lbs of tomatoes a day, and it seems evident to me Sauce needs to be made from the overripe ones. We can't eat them fast enough. A big switch from last year. We did get tomatoes at the end of the season, but we have been eating tomatoes out of the garden since the end of July.  The surprise crop was the amazing productivity of the purple greenbeans. I think the corn will be ready any day. Should check this weekend. I also am impressed with how much broccoli we have gotten from just four plants, delicious, too. 
Gotta check the stew, 
see ya!"

We are harvesting veggies out of the garden like crazy. I have about 5lbs. of tomatoes sitting on the counter, and 10 lbs of squash and green beans in the fridge. We have green peppers to pick, and more broccoli to cut. I had to water today as things were getting pretty dry. Will go out later and get more tomatoes.
Am expecting one shipment after another for the store in the next three weeks Will get to fill the shelves again for Christmas. Makes me happy. I think we will survive this year. Ordering more soap tomorrow. I always look forward to the soap shipment as it smells so heavenly!
Went to the school to drop off veggies and stayed to glaze a few pots. I have a huge pile of biscuit to glaze, Wednesday I better get it done. Hopefully, all of it. I have many bowls to trim out too. lots to do!
The studio is framed and sheeted and as of Saturday evening, has a beautiful new roof. The water is in, and the electrician comes tomorrow.  After that, the furnace man comes to put in the heater. Things are going quite quickly now.
Don't forget, all on my friends list are invited to the weekend long Studio warming Date to be announced. I am trying to find a date that won't conflict  with my event-going SCA pals.

SCA Folks; Any date suggestions for October or early November?

Plus he had great 2$ specials and i filled a big bag with those.
Saturday after noon was day one at the Gift show .I ordered more Siberian birch wood boxes. At the cash and carry section of the show, I bought tibetan silver from my friend Dolma. She lives in California.Some day I will fly down and visit her.She lives just north of San Fransisco.
I could not find my french soap dealers, and I'm out of a lot of scents, so panic is setting in. Should I order direct? Still need to order my Christmas animals and ornaments from the floral place. Will leave around noon today and get that done.

""Hello? this is your neighbor, xxxx xxxxx, and I'm upset because i can't sleep in. Your construction is waking my kids up early and and how dare you. My children are on their vacation and they have a right to sleep in. Oh and by the way, my mother and teenage daughter have seen your construction workers pissing in the bushes on your property. And I'm calling the sheriff on you, youaredisgusting how can you allow them to do this!!!! My teenage daughter is horrified. Youaregoingtojail.Callmethisinstantmynumberisxxxxxxxxxxx!!!!!!!"" Click. 
WTF?
They are peeing in my yard?
I had to listen to the screaming phone message about five times to decypher the phone number. wrote it down, and then called my construction manager. He laughed at me And i told him it wasn't funny. He changed his demenor and got serious. I called him just a little later and apologized and we laughed about it. A porta-potty was delivered shortly after noon. I could care less if she can't sleep in, but-
No more peeing in the yard.

Edit to add:
This is the neighbor I had to call the sheriff on last Summer because she was chasing and attempting to strangle her teenage daughter while screaming obscenities. For over two hours. Also holding the 16 year old boyfriend hostage blocking him in and refusing to call his parents at his request. She assaulted him too. This happened a second time without the boyfriend at ten o'clock at night about a month later. I think she felt she wanted to pay me back."

You are the total package - suave, sexy, smart, and strong.<br />
You have the whole world under your spell, and you can influence almost everyone you know.<br />
You don't always resist your urges to crush the weak. Just remember, they don't have as much going for them as you do.<br />
<br />
You tend to be pretty tightly wound. It's easy to get you excited... which can be a good or bad thing.<br />
You have a lot of enthusiasm, but it fades rather quickly. You don't stick with any one thing for very long.<br />
You have the drive to accomplish a lot in a short amount of time. Your biggest problem is making sure you finish the projects you start.<br />
<br />
You are balanced, orderly, and organized. You like your ducks in a row.<br />
You are powerful and competent, especially in the workplace.<br />
People can see you as stubborn and headstrong. You definitely have a dominant personality.<br />
<br />
You are well rounded, with a complete perspective on life.<br />
You are solid and dependable. You are loyal, and people can count on you.<br />
At times, you can be a bit too serious. You tend to put too much pressure on yourself.<br />
<br />
You are very intuitive and wise. You understand the world better than most people.<br />
You also have a very active imagination. You often get carried away with your thoughts.<br />
You are prone to a little paranoia and jealousy. You sometimes go overboard in interpreting signals.<br />
<br />
You are usually the best at everything ... you strive for perfection. <br />
You are confident, authoritative, and aggressive. <br />
You have the classic ""Type A"" personality.

Been pondering:
What will be my role in the SCA in the future.
Since 1982,I have always had a ""purpose"" in the SCA, a job, an activity, a guild, teaching,- none of those things exist anymore and I have nothing left.
I need to find a ""group"" as in people not as in a ""official group"" I can find acceptance in  and feel like I can be myself and find my place again. I  There isn't much tying my to the SCA these days.
I feel adrift, alone.
What scares me the most is that I used to Love, love this organization.
now I feel like a complete outsider and no one wants my skills or help.

I only reserved 12 days at the hotel this time. D doesn't seem to do well without me for a whole two weeks at a time. This will be my shortest trip. I will save money on the hotel bill for sure.
Am going to pick up some more loose gems and certainly more or the blue Tourmaline from my favorite dealer at the Holidome.  I want to get more carvings this time I sold out all I had purchased last year in two months. Going to get more horses, dogs, cats and dragons. Well, I will get as many cool figures i can this go around.They pack and ship well too. I have a snake necklace i want to do so I'll get some snake carvings for me.
I don't know what else will thrill me this time be we will see.

I don't think I will do a day of ponder, Although it is a fine idea,
I spend plenty of ponder time on a regular basis.
2008 has been a mixed bag for me- Family estrangement, death, personal disappointments and the car wreck. 
There were some bright spots- Pottery school, fun with my girls, and a closer relationship with my spouse.
Things I'd like to work on in 2009
Perfecting my newly recovered pottery skills.
Maintaining closeness in  my relationship.
Trying to keep my word when i give it.
Not jumping into situations trying to fix things. :(
Being a better friend to people I care for.
Making realistic goals  can keep.
Stay on track for the long term ones.
Try to reach out and make new friends.
Get the paranormal team up and going.

A nice start , I think we shall see what the future will bring?

When we pulled up the the door of the building we noticed that the snow had pushed the rain gutters off the eaves and onto the ground.  A huge chunk  of ice fell off the roof just a minute ago. I made a loud bang, lol.
Obviously, I brought the computer along to stave off any boredom that might occur today.

Little pup slipped out the door and ran out into our snow covered street.
She barely missed getting hit by a neighbors SUV and then chased it to the corner. 
Thank goodness  the neighbors gate was open and she went in their fenced in yard  to see their dog.  All the while I am struggling in knee deep snow and yelling for her to come to me. The neighbor shooed her out of their yard and she chose to come home and bark at their dog through our adjoining fence.
I took me what seemed forever to flounder to the fence to grab her. She knew she was bagged and didn't fight me to  go in the house. 
Now she is having a time out/nap in her kennel.
We were doing so well. She had not done anything like that in months.
I'm exhausted and chilled from falling and trudging in the snow."

Tonight, I am looking at some non-contact ifr thermometers. I am leaning toward the pistol type. Maybe less likely to drop. ;) Am looking at gear boxes, headsets-so many toys!
Already have the digital voice recorder and analysis program, and the night vision on my video camera. Need to come up with a red light source for the camera, too. Browsed on the internet last night trying to find a infra-red lighting attachment for my new camera, a Sony HDD handycam DCR-SR85

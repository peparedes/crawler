	The computer is now to me much of a tool to access the web as the door is to access my house.

	My mind is rather stuck with the complexities of Hemingway's text right now. They ruin the hidden estetic that there was for me in my first reading of the book by the top line of this cover. ""Could he live without the power to love?"" I wonder if this title was on the original release of this book. I should broach this subject with Collis when I deliever him his book. I must keep it in a good condition, I think he should respect this present from a student.

	Now, Back to the bothersome feelings one has in a room with screaming Germans playing fooseball. I am mildly upset with the way that the people have put their coats on the couch that I had planned to injest Animal Farm on. But alas, it seems to be not so.

	My mind is rather lost in the beauty of these old cities. There is a wealth of existance here that I have had no part of. Humanity lives in cities. Cities are what gives humanity it's greatness. All the triumphs of humanity come from the sort of culture one generates in a city. There is nothing as magical as the world that is birthed from the city. It is existance defined. The rural life is a removal from the existance of humans. It is a seperation and a distancing from just what we really are. You seperate yourself from this existance and give yourself a number on a road. It is alarming. Even one who doesn't leave his hovel is a step above the being that takes himself far away from the central life.

	I find myself drawn more and more to the appeal of the streets at night, the song of the city that hums over and over in my head. The city has a life, a life I barely recognize, but I yearn to hum the tune. There is something magical about how the city moves. The land of individuals that, together, defines the beast that is the city is to me one of life's unworshipped treasures.

	Maybe I should thank my parents for being those that leave the world to raise their children. For those who are born in the city do not know how spoilt they are. Think carefully. They do not realize that they are at the heart of culture. They do not realize they are at the seat of power. They control who eats and who dies, with every one of there whims. They do not realize that the infection they perseve in the viens of their home is the injection of life they miss when they leave for the hills.

	Maybe I just have yet to be jaded by the city in the way that poisons one's soul against that which they are. I am scared of the mentality born from those removed ones. They scare me more then any other. For they claim to know humanity, and they claim this without hinderence. What they do not realize is that they do not understand existance in any of it's forms. They understand nothing, but claim to know all. The city births apathy, but not ignorance.

	There is a reason why humanity has congregated in walls and in areas since Mesopatamia. Because cities work. They have power, they have strength. People can believe in a city, they can trust a city, and they can experience a city. Can you experience a town? No, for the town's life never trancends that of the people in the town. The town is defined by the people who live in the town, but the town itself does not really exist without the people.

	The city exists seperately. When enough people gather, they truly create something stronger then the sum of their parts. It is not even something they achieve conciously. The city is an expression of their existance, but if you changed the people, the city would still thrive on it's own.

	I have seen dead cities. I live in a town in a dead city. There is no city centre where I live. I think the term city should be stricken from the name of my home. City implies enclosure and strength. This city is dead. Hardly would a cry stir even a voice that carried any power with it. The city is dead, long live the recluse!

	The suburb should not be defined the city. It is nothing but a land grab used to define the money gathering abilites of an area. The suburb is either outside or inside the city. For if it is outside, it should be called that which it is, the outside, and if it is inside, then it should be made to represent what it is, the city. Those that live in the suburbs, and travel into the city only live half a life. For the city needs to take these lands, and wall them. Once they are in the city itself, then, and only then, are they members of the city. There should not be half citizens allowed. It is a travesty when one city feeds the other. Cities need to grow and prosper as distinct. Not hostile, but one city should not be the other city's place of business. A citizen should live and work in their city, for the good of the city they live in.

	Why is this such a large issue to me you may be asking?

	I have asked myself this lately as well. I am sick to death of the life of those who keep themselves out of the life, and into the ignorance. There is something missing from my life, and it may lie within the walls, stone or ashfalt.

	I need the city. It calls to me. I must answer the call.

	Or I fear that the rurality of my existance, will swallow me whole."

I'm getting no support and nothing but downplay for decisions lately. It's only because they care, but I still feel unsupported. Oh well.

"event","lead to entries you don't want to read in the morning. Hi people. I don't update. I don't care too much about LJ. It's not that great, and besides my head doesn't have that great of output recently. It's all mush, so why would I want to put it here?

I hate people some days. My brother is a fucking jerk. People who go to the movies to drink and have a conversation would be better off in a pub with a big screen, not ruining my movie experience. Things have been shitty tonight. What can I do?

Not much. I told them to shut up. I got mad at my brother. Nothing more I can do then punch them both in the face and just tell them to fuck off really.

There is a mosquito in my room. It's by my screen.

I thought I wanted to be buddhist once.

A buddhist doesn't want to kill the mosquito because he is mad at the world and he can oppress on the little ones when he feels like he can. If I am a buddhist, I'm a horrible fucking person.

Right now I feel like a giant asshole. I treat people bad, and for it, other people treat me bad. I get what I deserve some days.

Most days I don't deserve it though. Most days I get let down, let off, put down, laid out, shut down, and just generally dropped. You might not even realize your doing it. But I feel it. It hurts.

It doesn't make me feel great to feel used. That was my childhood, and it seems like it's becoming my young adulthood. I have my good friends, I have the people who call me friend, but I'm not much more of an aquantence anymore. I have those who think of me as friend, but I don't know many that would really stand up for me. There are those that will. But I don't always feel great when everything is all said and done. I wouldn't trade my friends for the world. But some days, I don't value the world that highly. But I still don't want to lose them.

I'm supposed to write my girlfriend a letter for our anniversary. Right now, all I'd write is ""I miss you, this isn't a good time. - Ron"". Because it wouldn't really be a good letter with the mood I'm in.

Things just aren't going around right in my head. I can't stop myself from spending money, even though I almost ran out of money and couldn't afford to go on my trip. I can't get the motivation to do anything other then play WoW and eat, even though I was told about 8 months ago if I didn't get out and exercise, my bad cholestoral would get even worse. Fuck, I feel pains in my chest all the time, do I do a thing about it? Not at all. I just shrug it of. I'm killing myself with slovenlyness.

What a way to go. Just sitting eatting doing nothing just fucking around, hoping to be a writer, not even doing anything to reach that goal. I just don't care about my life like I should. What do I do to live? I don't live, I exist. Things just aren't motivating me at all. I just always feel like crap. When I feel happy, it lasts for a while, then I just feel unmotivated again. Things are just bad when all I do is sit and eat and game and cuddle. I really need to get out, live rather then exist. But I just don't feel it. I can't get myself to live, only to exist. And it's killing me. Literally.

Why do I do this to myself? I come up with so many excuses. Like, ""When I get a girlfriend, I'll change, that's for sure."" Well that didn't happen. I'm still the same old fat ass lazy fucker. Hell, I can't get myself to shower more then once a week. I just don't care. It's horrible. I can feel teeth rotting in my mouth, do I do anything about it? No. I don't.

I don't do anything about it. Why? I wish I had a fucking clue. I wish I knew why my head was so fucked up some days. There is so much going on, that it just hurts. I think ""Maybe when I'm working more, and I like my job, I'll change."" Well I love my job. I work tons. I haven't changed.

My brains just really are crying out for mental attention, other then repugnent deschevelment. I don't use my brain like it should be. I lie awake some nights, thinking about how I waste my time at school, and how I could be a straight A student at university easily. It's not hard. I know how to do it. I just have to do it. But entropy is my game.

Some days I just feel like shit. This is one of those days.

I can't take control of my money. So I do this. 
<img src=""http://thetrip.box.vg/images/debit-cards.jpg"">
Extreme. But I have no self control. I can't save money. I need to eat, and waste my money. I waste it on shit I don't need to. I can't control myself. I'm a train wreck, held together by the sheer will to exist and be brilliant that even when I fail I still feel.

Say goodbye to a short burden release from my mind. Take a bow."

I want to afford this trip to Italy, but it's getting harder and harder. I keep having deep thoughts about the world. I need a recorder to put this all down. My brain works a mile a minute now that I'm not in school. I need to have some direction. I also need to start writing more. Tons more. I have to stop playing WoW, and start writing. How can I even dare to dream to be a writer, when I can't put the proverbial pen to the paper. 

Having a girlfriend is kewlies.

It's new and difficult, and I'm trying really hard. But I think I am rather liking it.

I wrote her a poem for Valentine's Day. It was really swell. I'd post it here, but I have to ask her for it first.


I really need to start writing stuff down.
Maybe here. Maybe I'll get a real account, and use the phone service. Who knows. One more kiss then time to send."

Will I like her? Will she like me?
What about my ugly truck? Is it clean enough?
What about my clothes, what should I wear?

So Flea market, the false start so far, I got some good deals, and it was alright. A man with a dog got yelled at. Good times. Mostly because me and Sean rule. Really, we do. I miss hanging out with him more.

Then Monday at work sucked my balls. Didn't get my promotion, and got put on the one month till they can fire you plan. Quite a kick in the balls I say.

Then, Tuesday morning, when your first bus doesn't come, the McDonalds makes you puke, and there is too much construction to make it to your class. 

Tasha just kissed me, on the cheek. I think I got rabies. But Sexy Rabies.


Yah, this week is starting off rather shitty, I'm not too fond of it. There are other things too but they aren't the world's worst concerns, it's just lonely boy wishing he wasn't alone things.

Most of you know what that's like, except your delusions of grandure don't all involve delusion. Well, for some of you yes. Anyhow, enough whinning, back to dancing to IMA Robot in the hallway, and annoying people."

"event","Ever feel your own mind mature?

I'm still feeling it. It's like the relationship/romance part of my brain is trying to evolve to the state I should be at, without experience to back it up. I'm slowly thinking things through, but, whereas, most people had some sort of young love (and by young, i mean elementary/early high school romance of substaintial or insubstaintial level) to build off of, I'm trying to build off a clean slate. Well, Bloody slate, mostly my own blood, from constant retractions and sudden insertions of my heart.  However, it is weird, I can feel myself growing as a person, but since there is no experience to play this off of or to facilitate the maturity, I get to watch as a grow first hand.

Also, parties are boring for me. I'm mostly sober, I just get to sit and talk to people, and the people I get to sit and talk with are normally upset or bored. Very rarely are they actually happy. Or I'm gossiping. I'm a gossipy little fuck aren't I?

School's almost back. Almost time to neglect again! Yay! Spend too much time chatting or flirting, and not enough time doing school work or getting anywhere with my flirting.

It's weird. I'm not depressed, but I'm not happy. I'm just plainly apathetic. Totally apathetic. I hate these moods.


What else to say? I saw and loved Napoleon Dynamite, didn't get any clothes from clothes shopping, I hate stupid petty drama.... um....

"event","Basic Plot: The mind of someone who escapes into fantasy, Walter Mitty style. However, unlike Mitty, it's just him exploring time lines with his mind, and basically it's a character story.

Only, my writer's block has forced me away from a good opening, and I can't start....


You'd think, with my state of mind, I'd be able to write this....


My head hurts more now...


But lets do the event update, shall we? Isn't that what a journal is ""truely"" for?

I've spent a few nights with someone new, which I enjoyed. Nat is pretty radical I must say.

Friday I saw Catwoman.
Saw some awesome dancing at Robson Square after becoming a part with the modern art.

So picturesque as we lied on the screw, the lighting and the music (yes the symphony music) was perfect for the mood. Just like out of a movie, except without as many establishing shots.
The dancing was awesome, I would have danced too, but I had a wardrobe malfunction.
So we walked around downtown and I just had a wonderful fucking night.

Which continued into night two... well first with day two.

This is the summary of day two in a nut shell:

<img src=""http://www.sfu.ca/~rsanders/clown.jpg"">

Yah, that's me. Don't like it? Tough luck :P. So yes, I spent the day as a clown, and sunday as well. Did it for a cold hard $50 bucks. Whoever says that I don't have self confidence, just look at that and tell me that I don't have balls of steel or something.

So I handed out candy and had just a radical day. Scared one little girl, but she was happy when she got candy.

Then I went back out for another hanging out with Nat. We drove around, got some slurpees, I showed her the quaintness of Cloverdale, and the horror movie drive, which was, as it always is the second time around, less then spectacular. But it was fun.

I burned her the Eternal Sunshine soundtrack, and it was great fun.

Another radical night down, ask for night three on the way home.

Sunday, is Clown Redux. I look like the guy from KISS or something.

<img src=""http://www.sfu.ca/~rsanders/clown2.jpg"">

Funny story: The first set of makeup on Sunday made me look like I was going to kill a child... It was scary. The girl doing it said ""oh ok, now you look scary, I fucked it up"" so that's set two.

Sunday night, Third night with Nat, Had myself some Wendy's, TV and Altar Boys.

Sorry if the last bit is breif, Koleman and Christina are yelling at me from outside...


Maybe more later, who knows....

... Later...


So Koleman, Christina and I went for a TGP then, me and Koleman drove around for an hour and a half of well used time. 

This is the first time I've felt I've fully articulated a thought in such a precise way that even if the listeners don't have a good response, or one at all, I just feel that I've fully come to terms with something.

Anyhow, Sunday was fun, I wanted to go for a walk though, I should have just parked my car somewhere and walked anyhow :P.

And then on Monday night (tonight *cough*), I hung out with Tasha Jason and Lorne, yah, Lorne was there. I still hate the kid, but I can be civil and friendly.

We watched 20 minutes of Big Lebowski, then they showed up. We joked all night, and I found out the show Lorne has been searching for is called ""Strange Luck"". I rule.


But now, as it's 4 am, and I had a kick ass day at work yesterday, it's time for me to go to sleep and enjoy my day a bit more. I work from 5-9, so if you want to get in touch with me, i'll be online from <time i get up> to 4:30ish, then from 9:30 on till whenever the fuck i go to bed.


Yes this is a long post. Yes, I used the Enter Key (Laura, hit enter more). But lets just recap for those who didn't pay enough attention.

3 nights with a radical girl, 2 days as a clown, One great sales day, One thought fully worked out, One night of weird hang out, and One tired Ron.


Good night."

"event","One minute, that last post encapsulates my mood completely, So fucking depresso it makes you wonder why i don't have my glasses surgically implanted onto my head,

The next, I'm back to being chipper happy Ron.

Maybe about an hours difference between events....


I scare myself some days...

I actually think I may be going insane....

Some days, I feel like this:

Some times, I feel an afinity for this gentlemen:

If this keeps up, I'll be like this guy:

I'm scared for myself, even though i'm happy now."

"event","Only one thing can really come out of me right now, and that is just a long and lingering sigh.

I don't know why, but right now, I have nothing in me. Nothing. You could shell me open, and you'd just find the empty vassal they call a corpse.

There's no Ronnie here. No Ron. No Ronald. No Sir Regnald Featherbottom. (I can be funny and depressed).

I just can't explain it really. Things aren't bad. But they aren't great either. I mean, romance isn't any better then normal, but at least I have the chance to cast the illusion of attraction.
Work is non-existant, for all basic ideas of the practise.
School, hell, I just might not go back till the spring. I can't afford it, and there is nothing to take.

I think I might just go sit by the pond, and just stay there. I feel like I'm being drained, and this is just like everyone else. We've reached that age where the world is there, and we need to embrace it. But like us all, I waste away.

I have that fault, where I just expect things to turn out right. I expect work to turn around, I expect love to come to me, I except everything. But I don't work for it. I don't deserve great things unless I'm willing to work for it. But instead, I gorge myself on electronics and fast food, killing myself slowly.

I can't even look in the mirror anymore. It disgusts me so much what I see. It really upsets me.

So what do I do? I ride my bike around, and then gorge more on fast food.

I need to leave. Get on a bus, and just fucking end up somewhere, maybe the midwest US or a small town in England or something.

Even living in Vancouver would make me love life more then this sesspool of emotional heart break and cultural depravity.

So to sum up,

Sigh"

"event","Sitting alone in my room
Drinking my Diet Pepsi
Faced with autonomy
and desitution
I'm left bold faced
and face down
In the rut of my 
Creation.
Like a broken hourglass
Time drains from me.
Wasted away
Dust on the mantle
Watching out for you.
Silently,
I creep along.
But Sullenly,
I don't get far.


Washboard Decentants
Cigarette Dreams

Wasting away with a Bottle of Gin
and a single tear drop of mist.

Down home country depression
Repackaged for your city life.
Outlet sore, all your needs.

Water water, everywhere
A dollar ninety each.

Empty, Can I be?
Not without you."

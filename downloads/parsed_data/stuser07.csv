Boy: No this is fun
Girl: No its not. Please, its too scary
Boy: Then tell me you love me
Girl: Fine, I Love You. Slow Down!
Boy: Now give me a big hug
~Girl Hugs Him~
Boy: Can you take my helmet off and put it on yourself? Its bugging me.
(in the paper the next day..)
A motorcycle had crashed into a building beacuse of break failure.Two people were on it, but only one survived.

*The truth was that halfway down the road, the guy had realized that his brakes went out, but he didnt want to let the girl know. Instead, he had her say she loved him and felt her hug one last time, then he had her wear his helmet so that she would live, even though it meant that he would die.

If there's anyone you love this much re-post this...."

"event","Im hoping GOD could read this and tell me what to do.  its kinda hard to forget a part, i've thought my whole life through.  its not that complicated, i've let others down too.  its not like you demand it, but im trying just for you.  Please try to understand me, and focus when you do.....I'll make it brief and to the point and maybe right on Cue.

I don't how i got this way or if i'll ever be ok......I hope to GOD we figure this before i'm really threw.  When you left, i guess i kept, alot of me with you.  i really knew i loved, my heart ached everyday.  i thought i'd never see you but wished it anyway.  The pain was overwhelming almost hard to bare.  Things piled up and life got rough, and things just seemed unfair.  I blamed myself for everything, it was the easiest thing to do.

Then drugs were then presented and soon i didn't care.  my life once had incentive and now it wasn't there.  i slowly went into depression, and wanted noone near.  I thought, ""The drugs and me are all i need, to make it disappear.  People painted pictures in your head and made it seem that i was ""dead.""  The drugs, the Hate, The Violent state, was all that i could do.  I felt as though my life was gone the day that i lost you.  I knew i'd always Love you since the day i told you so, i tried so hard to hug you, and never let you go.  You see these weren't my real plans, and to be honest i'm not fine.  I'd take love over all the drugs, just to go back in time.  to that one day i woke to find, your pretty face asleep with mine.  

But here's some understanding for those who thought they knew, My life is only standing because i choose it too.  I'm trying now to fix things and hope its not too late, but know that i still love you and i hope its not too late........"

"event","wow! can u say good day?..not...well i get up at 6am...but i went to bed at 3am! 3 hours of sleep...and not to mention nightmares woke me up more than 1- times between 3 hours..

so i go to the skool...i stand in this LONG line..and they dont got my schedule..so we ran around the skool tryin to get answers and i finally got my schedule! so then to ID's..well i was SURE i was gonna get a 9th grade one again...but NOPE i got a 10th grade ID wOoP wOoP..so i go to find ashley to get a locker together...and i cant find her..turns out band saved lockers over on the east side of the skool...but me ans ashley kinda got lockers by the gym...oh well i got a double locker..its just on the bottom..but i dont care! 

so i get home rite..and i find out i gotta babysit from 9:30am-5pm...and i only get 10 bucks extra? thats wrong...neways i got there and basically the whole family was there?! so i sat down and i got to reading since the little one was sleepin! read bout 60 pages..not bad...then we went to get brooke and we went swimmin...and played with her pet doves...man oh man are those pretty birds and they dont bite at least hers dont! but there pretty...

well we went to adventure landing..and it didnt rain! me ,nicole,ashley and brookie.and of course my mom.we get there to go to the wave pool...later we found out that sum fucka kid shitted in the pool..im never going in there again! thats nasty! we had fun! JUAN IM GONNA KILL YOU!!!! WHYD YOU QUIT AT ADVENTURE LANDIN?!?!?!so we are on our way home at 11pm...and theres a ""saftey check 1/2 mile""
so we put our seat belts on and we are all basically eatin sumflower seeds in traffic..sahley is screamin at every car we pass that had there windows down! all the way home..it was soo much fun..and then we drop nicole off and we turn on her street to get out and at this time im climbin my way into the bakseat when sum idiot comes flyin at us at like 30 mph head on.the funny thing is theres a HUGE median....he was going th ewrong way asshole! so my mom baksup turns around and waits for the guy to come bak..we try and get his tag number but hes a junior driver(my friend junior..fast ass drvier!) and we couldnt get it..my mom said if brookie wasnt in the car my mom would have driven a lot faster and caught up with him and got his tag and turned him in..cuz hes never been in nicoles neighborhood cuz he didnt know which road was wut and my mom said she thinks he was runnin away from sumone!

oh well im tired! nitey nite everyone!"

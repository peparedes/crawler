"event","<P>Yes, love. The big word L-O-V-E, LOVE... Such a simple word really... And yet so confusing, covering everything from family over friends to your one and only... if such a person exists. </P>
<P>I know of many kinds of love, first of all my family. My mom and dad and closest relatives, whom I love dearly, all of them. </P>
<P>Then there's friends, but love of friends is comparative (in strength!) to love for a boyfriend or girlfriend so I'll get back to it. </P>
<P>Yeah, then there is 'that special person'-love... Three main kinds: </P>
<P>1) A crush: Not actually quite fitting into the category 'love' in my opinion, but the feeling can be just as strong, or seem to be. A crush is something superficial and is more like falling in love with who you THINK the person is, the perfect dream, an illusion. </P>
<P>2) Being in love: Yes, this, to me, is NOT the same as loving someone. To be in love is... well, more fleeting and less steady than to love, but it is also a more chaotic, confusing and terrifyingly strong and passionate feeling (not saying to love is without passion!). When being in love things may seem like a dream, and you can be blind to all kinds of things. This is the state between illusion and reality, there's still fractions of the perfect image left, but the feelings are now aimed at a 'real' person, in the sense that you actually KNOW the person you're in love with. Maybe you're together, maybe you're not, but you know each other personally. </P>
<P>3) Love: Well, who am I to talk about love? But the way I see it, it's the deep and steady feeling left when you have truly come to know each other. When there are no illusions, and no attempts to change the other person to be what you thought they would be like. It can be frightening and passionate as well, but there is now only 'real' real emotions and persons involved. This is not saying that the other two kinds of love are not real, but they may seem to be more than what they are. </P>
<P>Now, back to friends. They are also in three categories: </P>
<P>1)Buddies: Superficial friends, all the ones you know just a little better than what they're called. People you'd say hi to. They've got nothing to do with love at all. </P>
<P>2)Friends: Those you are close to, and who are close to you, but who you still aren't to trust with your deepest secrets. Those who come and go, and may hurt you if they betray your trust, but who may not be around always. Feelings for these are comparable to being in love in the sense that they are just as fleeting and based upon a possibly wrong image of who the person is. With some you can be best friends one day and enemies the next because you didn't see who the person really was or vice versa. </P>
<P>3) True Friends: The ones who you would trust your life to. Those special people who seem to always be there when you need them, and who you know will stand by your side even if you don't always agree. This is an equal to loving someone. You have again come to know each other truly and respect each other a 100% as the persons you are. </P>
<P>These are too few words to describe exactly what I mean, but it's the general idea of it... </P>
<P>Now, there's a problem... about being in love... Because how do you KNOW that you're in love? </P>
<P>HOW??? </P>
<P>There are as of this moment four persons I THINK I'm in love with: </P>
<P>One I want to be in love with </P>
<P>One I fear to be in love with </P>
<P>One I hope to be in love with, though I shouldn't </P>
<P>One I seem to be in love with, though I couldn't </P>
<P>GOD why is this life and love so COMPLICATED??? </P>
<P>WHY? </P>
<P>WHY?WHY?WHY?WHY?WHY?WHY?WHY?WHY?WHY?WHY?</P>

"event","Of course it isn't! Feeling inadequate is not what you are meant to feel when otherwise being perfectly happy. And I am happy! Why shouldn't I be? Everything's great. Everything's fucking perfect! Only it can't be, not when I feel like this. I should be overjoyed, floating around dreamily and all that. But I'm not. I'm a wreck. Not on the outside, no. I'm smiling and all, and I do feel happy... sometimes. But my inside's a mess. I'm terrified, shaking and ever watching for signs that I'm not good enough. Strange as how this feeling has become my arch nemesis. The fear of not being good enough. I'd never dream of asking or expecting the standards from my friends that I seem to demand from myself just to be an acceptably okay person. It's almost ridicilous. But my friends are amazing and little by little I was slowly beginning to free myself from the overwhelming guilt of not being for them what I thought they should be able to expect from me. Not that any of them have ever even as much as insinuated that I wasn't there when they needed me. They apparently think I'm as good a friend as any, I just never agreed with that. But as mentioned before I slowly freed my self more and more and I was really getting somewhere... But now it's back. And I can't stop it. I can't help it. It's always in the back of my mind now: ""You're not good enough"", ""You ought to do..."", ""You ought to say..."", ""You ought to..."", ""This is not good enough"", ""You're not good enough, he'll see that soon"". And I hate myself for it. Not only for letting this get to me again, but for having let a person come to mean so much to me that I'm this vulnerable and yet not being able to get into it a hundred percent. I hate myself for being trapped like this, in-between and now unable to go either way, paralyzed by the thought of what pain movement might bring with it. Yet I don't not how long I can stand this. It feels like I'm going crazy... more so than last winter. And I who thought Christmas was to be a happy holiday this year. I don't know what to do... Not at all... I feel lost. Yeah, lost is the word. Lost to myself, and to anyone else too perhaps... Unless someone is able to make my mind stop spinning and my world turning in on itself. And perhaps, when everything else makes a bit of sense again, I'll find myself somewhere... 

God what rambelings... Probably just exaggerations most of it. Don't dare to read it over or I'll just erase it all, which really doesn't serve the point of having this journal-thing. Anyway, that's all for now. And what was it I said in an earlier post? Oh yes: ""Don't forget to live"" ...God what irony!

"event","Yeah, late nights. My favourite time of the 24 hour day. This is when I feel free to be me and to do what I want. Maybe it's because you're expected to slep at that time and thus no other expectations are upon you if you chose to stay awake. I have no idea whatsoever if this is anywhere near the truth, but it might be. Maybe it's just that the night-side of me is stronger... Who knows. But my point is, there is no time as great as a late night. You can do almost whatever you like, and do it without others interfering more than you want them to. I can write without being bothered, I can go watch the moon for two hours if that's what I want. No one will bother me or ask me for reasons they don't understand anyway. 

I guess it is after all quite natural for a dreamer to love the night, don't you?

"event","Well, yes. So that's it: I've started an on-line journal... Don't know what's happened to me! Oh well, maybe it'll work better than other journals I've tried starting... I never got around to writing much in them, I simply forgot to, or kept procrastinating... I'm good at that, procrastinating. Not really a talent to be proud of, is it? Well I guess I have other talents too, hidden somewhere out of reach at the moment... oh, except my writing perhaps, that's okay. It's been more than okay lately to tell the truth, for once I've written something I really liked myself :) 
This journal thing really isn't that bad an idea, I think. Seems like it's an effective way to get some random thoughts written down. And I think that's a good thing. Often we walk around with a lot of chaotic thoughts messing up our minds without us even being aware of it. And maybe if we get some of them out it'll make our lives seem less chaotic. I don't know, it was just a thought :)

Take care everybody, and don't forget to live :)

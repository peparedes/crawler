"event","Well yes I'm back and it's that time of year again when exams start and I get awfully maudlin about it all.

<lj-cut text=""moaning again"">I was thinking back on the fact that I am now thirty and my life is not what I imagined and I don't suppose that many people's lives ever are.

I have a house, which I have been living in quite happily since the end of August.  It's mine (well the bank's really, but that will be untrue in another 30 years!) and I love it, but what it lacks is something else.  Someone to share it with, but that is totally my doing so no one to blame - I shall be the spinster aunt with the many cats and curtain twitching tendancies (I'll need to move to a busier place for that to be entertaining enough though, or a village like St Mary Mead!).

Do I like my job?  No I really don't, well I like the job I just don't like the management and the way they handle things.  I wish for once that jobs didn't need education or at least that you could be rewarded on merit and not have to study when you really don't manage well on such things as exams.  There is no support at work.  And yes I know it's work where you are there to get the most money in for the company and just put in your 9-5 and someday get a pension from it, but if they offer you study they should at least have someone who's understanding in charge of it who can say yes I know it's hard and how about looking at this course this way?

I actually don't want to stay and I don't want to study, but I've already put in the past 5years to it and giving up now will just be bad.  Also I have a mortgage which relies on my being employed so no hope there.  I was rather angry yesterday though because I had tried to book this week off to study - the exam is on Friday morning - and because there was something, which was not urgent by the way, that I was part way through and instead of allowing me to take a laptop home and finishing it at home I was denied yesterday off and then when I'd finished my boss was no where to be found so I couldn't leave early and study.  Bah hum bug!

I am forecasting a failure come the results in February and I won't be suprised and I won't actually care.  My Mum will be annoyed and people at work will do that ""OH What did you do?  Why didn't you pass? Thick-O"" look at me, but at the end of the day have they sat the exam?  Are they going to sit the exam?  Do they find studying hard to do?  No so how can they judge and they do.</lj-cut>

Anyway I've made another depressing post and I shall go back to listening to the Geordie bloke doing de-briefs on questions from BPP.

"event","Hey!

Yes I know I failed in my plan to post everyday of my 29th to 30th year, but it's been quite a year and I couldn't move into tomorrow when I'm 30 with out posting a summary and one final 20-something post!

So recap....
A year ago tomorrow I was 29.<lj-cut text=""on with the list..."">

I passed one of my exams in August 2011 which made me one very happy little bunny - only like 6 more to go before qualification complete (oh and maybe a disertation/project thing to get a degree too, but that's a ""wait & see how motivated I am"" kind of thing.

Simon was 30 in September and we all went up to Morecambe (I think that's spelt wrong, but if I want to get this done before midnight that's what's gonna be the spelling!) to celebrate - fun was had by all I feel.  Went to Edinburgh with Mum and Dad for a whole week and stayed in the most amazing apartment just of Princes Street.  Me and Mum did lots of touristy things whilst Dad was at his conference!  Made me want to move there even more, but it's not likely to happen for a long time I think.

Then came October with Kathryn and Michael's 30th birthdays.  K had a brilliant fancy dress party - travel themed which lead to me wearing a 50s dress (time traveller! lol!)  M's birthday we went out for dinner in Chester and I found another restaurant I quite like.

November me and Mum and Dad went to Ludlow for the weekend and where they had a medieval christmas market on.  I bought some rather nice things and I now own my very own cloak, which as soon as the proper wintery weather starts I will be using.

Christmas was it's usual hectic time with exams and work parties and family gatherings etc etc.  Only saw a little bit of snow this year which was a bit depressing, but meant I wasn't spending forever at home instead of heading to work or out and about.

January Daddy was 60 and we all, including his brothers and their families went out for a meal at this lovely tiny french restaurant in woolton village.  Rather enjoyed that if you ask me.  Oh and I went to Scotland just after new year which was a great fun thing to do.

February was Mummy's birthday, Lisa's 30th, Beth's 30th and Michelle's birthday.  Not a lot really happened in February, though Graeme broke up with Becky and then started going out with Gemma.  Huge blow up there, but I think he brought it on himself to some degree, butt what do I know I'm only his sister!  Oh I put in an offer on a house, which was accepted might I add, but then I was gazumped the next week because the estate agents didn't take it off the market.  I was rather upset about it really, but looking back it was all for the best.

March I found another house and this time I made them take it off the market and it all became mine officially in May.  This house has two bedrooms, a driveway, a garage, a front and back garden, a dining room, big lounge with a real fire and a nice kitchen.  Definitely a house I could stay in for quite a few years unlike the one before which was right on the main road with no parking etc and I'd probably want to move within 5 years or so.  Therefore March and April merged together with sorting out buying the house etc etc.

May I got the keys for my house 4th May and then promptly went up to Cumbria to Amie's wedding.  My gosh she's not old enough to be married as she's a couple of months younger than Graeme, but it was a beautiful day and stayed dry which seeing as it was an outdoor wedding and then in a marquee was good.  It was great to see Amie and Adam and Diane and Martin again, and to see people that I haven't seen for many years.

June was the Queen's Dimond Jubilee and was celebrated by going to Kathryn's for her garden party and watching the boats on the Themes - pity it was raining something terrible on the saturday.  Exams again in June so now I have to wait until August for the results - I do hope I pass this time because I don't think I can bring myself to do it again, but I have promised myself that if I have to do it again I'm going to Liverpool to study for it and see if that helps as the Manchester man wasn't that great when I was there in the winter session.  So still 5/6 more exams to do before qualification.

July started with Auditting with Dan in Wrexham and brought me to today where I had presents at work and cards and lots of small sparkley 30s and stars all over my desk.  I got a traveller gnome which I think shall have to come on my travels with me and have his pictures taken whereever we go!  Spider repellant because I'm a complete and utter wuss about them (my garage was a haven for them before Mummy cleaned it all out, but I think they may be creeping back so spraying stuf should do the trick I think!)  Vouchers for Amazon and New Look and a keyring with ""Keep Calm and Eat Chocolate"" on it.

So here I am recapping rather quickly what has happened this year and what is to come you may ask... Well finishing my house so I can move in in the next couple of weeks learing to live in my house and then maybe Michelle might move in if she wants to move out of her parents.  I might not have moved out by the time I'm 30, but I have bought a house and that's the only grownup thing I'm likely to ever do again!</lj-cut>

All in all I think it was a very content year and I'm thinking next year could be even better!  Though I'm hoping that sometime in my future there will be more travelling - I haven't been anywhere for the last two years now and I'm dying for a trip to DC again!

Night night everyone and sweet dreams.  Goodbye to 29 and Hello to 30!

Love Always

I heartily advocate Indian Head Massages as a form of relaxation & definatley they are good for revision/exam stress! Zoe did it yesterday & I'm all calm & floaty!

So yes F9 take 1! We'll see what happens in Feb, but I'm not too worried.

Ok almost there so I'd best sign off now.

"event","<lj-cut text=""a tale of no substance"">Well again a day of my own company.  Lindsay was waiting for me at the door this morning - I was 1 minute late, but he had a huge list of things he wanted me to do and well they just had to be done then.  Spent the whole day bobbing up and down the stairs, well I did at least leave all the tax information for Clair and Ben to do when they get back as I've only done adjustments etc as directed by Lindsay.

Linda's daughter had her baby at 4am this morning and she's called Lauren.  Linda came in this afternoon with a picture on her phone - she looks adorable.  Though Lisa said that she'd not dress her baby in Pink all the baby was wearing was - yes Pink!  She's got chubby little red cheeks and cute!  We'll probably hear all about it next week when she's back in.  Only Nicky now to have her baby, which will be interesting as her son Liam has been the only one for 2/3 years now - he wont know what's going on poor boy.

Oh and the cleaner seems to have progressed from dirty cloths to polish that leaves a greasey residue on the desk as I had to clean my desk and the one infront this morning before putting anything down on it.  I mean she must use too much polish (whatever kind it is) and not use the duster to wipe it off again.  I might suggest that I just clean my own desk from now on.  I have to wonder seeing as this is a specific cleaner from a business - how do they survive if they can't clean properly????  Pah not my problem another 15 minute thing to add to my timetable as non-chargeable!

Hmmm so I think I have plans for the weekend.  Friday is dinner at TGI Fridays with Mike, Kathryn, Zoe, Nat and Mark which should be great as we haven't had a get-together since erm Christmas and it's almost christmas again!  Then I'm going out with Michelle somewhere, when we decide on a destination - she said drive for a couple of hours North, East or South so me being me made a huge list and asked her if she had any suggestions?!</lj-cut>

I'm really sleep now so I'd best go and hit the pillows or I'll be awful tomorrow.

Night night

"event","Why is it when there's noone in that Lindsay decides that it's a good idea to bug me?!  I mean a million and one things <i>Must</i> be done there and then!  Silly man!  At least it kept me entertained all day.

<lj-cut text=""burbling should be an olympic sport"">On my own again but with my headphones in when there was noone in the room.  Rather like working like that - means I get more done apart from when Lindsay interrupts!

Linda at work's eldest Lisa went into Labour this morning so Linda's all excited though she did say that she needed to hang on until tomorrow because she could then go and visit them.  It's to be a girl which is really nice as her sister is also pregnant and due in a couple of weeks, but is having a boy.  Lisa is one of those people who have everything done just so.  And seems that having her baby is no difference I mean she was due today I think or at least 1-3rd of August and what do you know she is having the baby!  I'm thinking she might be a naughty baby just to upset Lisa's perfect world, because babies totally don't conform to ordered lives especially if you really want them to!

Tried adding Ben to my BBM and it just doesn't seem to want to work.  Hmm might have to try it again when he's in the office.

Lynne's car had a flat battery this morning, but she got it going and came to work which was fine, but going home time she tried the car and it was dead.  I was going to offer to jumpstart her car, but well the battery in my car is hidden under some mysterious coverings and I daren't try lifting things.  In the end she used Justin's car and it started, but she's got to go drive round to hopefully get it to fix and it's not as if she's got far to go to get home, wonder where she'll end up running the car!

Home but no golf tonight due to them putting in the new carpet after the fire weeks ago.  No idea why they have to close the driving range - I mean you could get in from the bottom of the range.  Meh anyway means I can sleep as soon as possible!</lj-cut>

I'm going to sign off now!

"event","Monday's just get a bit of a bad rep as it's the first day back at work after the weekend, but the same thing would happen if it was a Tuesday or you know any other day!

<lj-cut text=""Monday a day of people"">Ben was in today as he had payrolls to sort out.  The first thing he said to me was ""Ah I was looking for cleaning things this morning"" Well he knows he can go in my desk draw and get the baby wipes to use to clean his desk, but being a boy and silly by definition he didn't and had cleaned his desk using the fairy liquid!  I promptly told him that there was a bottle of Mr Muscle in my cupboard and he could have used the baby wipes.  The cleaner had once again cleaned the desk with the dirty cloth so I did my desk and the one in front of it.  I'm going to have to do Clair's desk before she comes back next week.  Spent the day burbling rubbish at Ben and being interrupted from what I was doing by Lindsay or Dan.

Yvonne asked me to get some information from a Client and the thing is I don't see why she couldn't do it seeing as I've done all my bits for it and she knows exactly what she wants.  Phoned them and asked for what I think she wanted so they should be bring it in tomorrow - it'll probably be completely wrong if you ask me.

Oh and Ben got himself a Blackberry Curve today!  Well it's been delivered to his house so he was all excited about it - geek!

Nothing else happened really as I did go to sleep rather early after dinner.</lj-cut>

A very short tale of Monday, but those days usually are quiet

"event","So I know I didn't post this on Sunday, but I'm dating it Sunday because that will make me happier and I can pretend I totally did post on Sunday!

<lj-cut text=""A Tale of spys and hidden things!"">Well me and Mummy and Daddy totally went to <a href=""http://www.hackgreen.co.uk/"">Hack Green Secret Nuclear Bunker</a> which is in Cheshire.  Totally in the middle of country lanes, but a lot easier to find than the one I visited in Scotland <a href=""http://www.secretbunker.co.uk/"">in Fife near St Andrews</a>.  Anyway we got there just about 12pm and spent must have been about 4 hours in the bunker itself.  It's huge, but there's not too much information to read which is good as I tend to read everything and take forever!  Was rather interested with the Royal Observer Corps which sadly nolonger exists.  Am still amused by the ""What to do in the event of a nuclear strick"" public announcement films and leaflets.  I mean there is nothing you can do in the case of nuclear strike and you would only get say 4 minutes warning so you can't build a shelter and store food/water and block your windows in white paint all in 4 minutes and if you're anywhere within the blast/aftershock radius well you're snookered almost straight away.  Saw this film for the first time when I was in the London Imperial War Museum and it made me laugh then, but I suppose the government had to produce something to encourage people and it was like the Air-raid precautions that people had been told about in WWII.  I totally forgot that Most Haunted had gone to Hack Green and I remembered when I got to a certain part and I though I've seen this bit before - yes I saw that bit on Most Haunted!  I need to not watch that because inveriably I go to the places they've been and I spook myself!  Like <a href=""http://www.realmarykingsclose.com/"">The Real Mary Kings Close</a> which I saw on there and then went with Lisa - not a good idea 'cos it's Dark there and you see all sorts of things in your head!  Anyway to get back on point Hack Green is definately worth a visit and if you ever get the chance you should go.

After that we were trying to decided what to do for dinner and we thought we'd have an early tea and then if we were hungry later we could grab a sandwich or something.  We drove to <a href=""http://www.cobcheshire.com/"">The Cock O Barton</a> which all sorts of people rave about and the reviews on the net/local food guides say brilliant.  Anyway when we got there they had a wedding party, but they didn't inform the people who were coming in for dinner that there was possiblity of a delay.  The staff were rather slow and just didn't seem to know what they were doing.  I asked to try the only guest beer they had and it was off when I tried it.  The food admitedly was good when we got it, I had a Greek Salad which was huge and then Fish and Chips, Mummy had Pea and Ham Soup and Fish and Chips and Daddy had Ham Hock and Pork with all the trimmings.  Everything was really nice, but as I said the staff - rubbish.  They'd put something on the bill that even the barman couldn't work out what it was.  There was an old couple that came in after us and they ordered their food and waited and waited and waited and when they asked the girl went ""Oh well we've got a wedding party in and the kitchen are just doing their food and your food will be sorted as soon as they've got that out""  Yes but as they hadn't told the people that there would be a wait that was a bit naughty.  Then their starters didn't arrive until after our mains had arrived, and they'd both ordered the soup - how hard is it for someone to heat up the pan that has the soup in it and just laddel out two bowls of soup?  The server could have done that and they would have started their dinner a lot sooner.  Anyways I'm thinking we're not going there again even if we did like the food.  I mean it doesn't matter how good the food is if the front of house staff and useless as they are the ones you tend to base your judgement on.

So we finally left at 7.30pm - 2.5 hours for a pub dinner for just 3 people is a bit excessive.

Came home and crashed out!</lj-cut>

So that was my fun day the wilds of Cheshire being educated!

Hope you had a good weekend

"event","Yes that means Saturday's post is actually on SATURDAY! Whoooohooooo! *party!*

<lj-cut text=""I left the house it was...boring!"">*cought* Back to sanity now I think!  Well the opticians was fine.  Rushed out of the house, with still damp hair, to find that over the road neighbour's 'friend' (he's too old to call boyfriend it just seems weird!) had parked the caravan and his hulking landrover across the bottom of our drive way making it interesting for me to get off the drive.  I had to drive over the grass and the pavement to get out.  It's not as if he couldn't have parked at the end of her drive and infront of her nextdoor neighbours front garden because then he'd have not blocked anyone, but no our driveway was the perfect place - NOT!

The optician said my eyes were fine, still the same prescription blah blah blah only thing he could suggest was more breaks from the pooter at work and to use eyedrops or spray to make them all teary and if that doesn't work to go see the doctor 'cos it could be something else.  He's a really nice chap and I like chatting with him.  So I said to him 'I'll just have to tell my boss that I work too hard and need to work less' He said yes, but he'd deny ever saying it if/when my boss phoned up for confirmation!

Came home and chilled for the afternoon.  Had planned on going straight to Asda for office shopping after the opticians, but my hair was a mess and I thought shopping at that time of the morning would be a huge mistake as the shop would be packed.

Finally went to Asda at 6.30pm because Mum and Dad have gone to my 3rd cousin's wife's charity night thing down the road so I though if I go to Asda tonight I don't have to bother tomorrow.  Also tomorrow I think that me and Mummy and Daddy might be going to the 'Secret Bunker at Hack Green' to be all educated and spooked.  I'm thinking it might be like the one I went to in Scotland several years ago and I totally spooked myself as I had gone on my own and well such places are spooky!  It's like the Cabinet War Rooms in London when you find there is noone else in the stretch of the tunnels you're in!

So if we go that will brilliant!</lj-cut>

I'm going to try to sleep now so I can wake up early and be all energetic!

Night night and I hope you had a good Wednesday/Thursday/Friday/Saturday!

"event","Hey!  <lj-cut text=""And on to the fun of Friday"">So yeah was still not happening with the posting, hope LJ gets sorted soon 'cos it looks like I'm not bothering when I really am and I intend to keep my challenge, though when I'm away it might be a little difficult seeing as the LJ lite thing just really doesn't work.  I'll see if my e-mail still posts to here and if all else fails I can try logging direct through my phone, but that will more than likely be a very slow process!

Friday has been a very very quiet day.  There were only 5 of us in today, well we started with 7, but two of them weren't really in and then Dan left early in the afternoon 'cos he said he wasn't feeling tip-top.  Meant that we downstairs boosted at 10 past 5 instead of quarter past, but that is neither here nor there really!  Spoke to Ben a couple of times and it seems that he might be regularly bobbing to Wrexham to do work for them, which is a bit interesting.  Maybe they are going to move him there or something.  I don't really know.  Hope he doesn't 'cos that would make me the baby again and being the baby at 29 is a bit annoying!

Well the job that Justin did I have completely taken over even though I'm not supposed to touch it due to my doing the bookkeeping on it.  I've done all the changes on it and almost finished it off so on Monday all Lindsay has to do is a final review and then send it out.  I really don't get how he's qualified.  Am I just being awfully picky and should I give up what I was taught in the beginning about making sure everything is right and check, check, check that things make sense?  I mean it works for Dan and Justin and Lindsay, but as I've said a million times before 'If you're male in our office you get away with anything and everything' and it's true.  I just have to grin and bare it and cry when I see the results.

My day was made happy by listening to <lj user=""LdyGhst_Music"">'s fan mixes, especially The Life of The Party mix which has all sorts of 50s + classics like 'Twist & Shout' and 'Wipe Out', 'Rock around the Clock' etc etc!  It makes me dance in my chair!  I must have looked odd to the people passing my window!</lj-cut>

No exciting happenings really, but tomorrow I have to get up early for the opticians etc etc so you know getting to sleep late is a must in my mixed up head!

<lj-cut text=""Another work rant, though not about actual work"">Not a lot happened today just a lot of work work work and ignoring everyone by using my headphones!  At least I had the room to myself all day so no one interupted me.  The only downside is that the cleaner seems to be completely stupid and used the same cloth she uses to clean the bathroom (yes and I do mean the toilet too *shudders*) to clean the desks in our room with.  Now you may ask how I know this...well they have cheap-o tesco value toilet cleaner which is supposed to be pinefresh, but is all chemical and icky, fine enough in a bathroom you visit only a few times a day and cannot lead to awful headaches and sick feeling in that short amount of time.  Anyway the desks in my room smelt of this pine cleaner and damp cloth so there's the proof.  I had to clean my desk with the baby wipes I have in my draw, which I use to clean my desk after I've done farm accounts - you don't question the stains on the papers they bring in ;)!  The thing is I was in there all day and you know how chemicals can get stuck in the back of your throat and make you just feel icky that's what happened as I didn't have time to clean all the other desks.  Having the window at the end of the room open helped a bit, but not by much really.

Not a lot else happened today really, flicked the tv a bit and now I shall fall asleep after this hopefully posts...I'm not holding my breath though!</lj-cut>

"event","<lj-cut text=""I keep it short before I snore whilst typing!"">Not a lot happened today.  Ben was in for the day, but he's off to Wrexham tomorrow which means I'm all alone again *sob!*  Didn't manage to get the things that I wanted to do done because Lindsay continued to annoy me today meaning my timesheet is a mass of little bits instead of a sold block of one thing.  Oh well tomorrow I shall be doing a block becuase I can get him to go away by telling him he can finish a clients accounts if he leaves me be for the morning at least!

Went to golf tonight and it was alright.  Robin said I've got a perfect swing, but it just goes a bit hey-wire when I start to bring it down or my left heel decides to lift or I do my patented turned out feet ending!  I can't help all these things as they seem natural to me and half the time it's all about maintaining my balance because I'd totally fall over if I didn't do it.  I know it's not the proper way to play golf, but it's the way <i>I</i> play it!  Anyway he'd get awfully bored if there wasn't something to moan about!

Watched body of proof when I got home from golf and it as good.  I hope this series doesn't get cancelled after a few episodes or I'll be upset.

Well I'm getting awfully sleepy and tomorrow I've only myself to keep me awake.  I did spend most of the day burbling at Ben and the poor lad had to listen!</lj-cut>

Well night night before I fall asleep like last night halfway through doing a job!

"event","<lj-cut text=""The excuse as to why I make two posts today!"">Well it wasn't really that I failed it was more my laptop and the external harddrive decided to fight whilst backing up last night so I could free some space and instead of fixing itself the laptop froze out.  I restarted it and got everything running again, but failed to realise that it was a bad idea to retry backing up which lead to another restart which I actually fell asleep doing so when I awoke this morning the laptop lid was up and when I pressed the power button it was back to the regular screen with no windows open.

So yes I planned on posting yesterday but the restarts all happened between like 11 and 12 pm and I well fell asleep!</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Mondays Post"">Right so that makes this Monday's post...

Monday I had the room to myself meaning I plugged my headphones in and listened to lots of music, well when people weren't interrupting me with requests to ""just do this for me would you please?"" etc etc.  So that all ruined my nice plans of a day of VAT and bookkeeping.

Yvonne came to my desk at like 9.05am at which time my computer was just starting to waken.  I told her I'd do what she wanted when my computer had started talking to itself and the rest of the world.  To this she asked what was up with it and I said it just sulked everytime you turned it on.  Her response was ""have you told anyone?"" Well DUH!  Of course I have but in our place they don't listen to anything you have to say until things go beyond repair.  She asked how long it took to work and how old the machine was, my reply being that it took between 15 minutes to half an hour and that it was the girl before me's computer and I've been there nearly 5 years now so I'd say it's about 7 years old.  Actually I should probably work out how old it is and then put my case forward, I mean if I don't manage to get a new laptop I might manage a new desktop!

They closed most of the major roads leading out of Frodsham and Helsby for ""resurfacing"" well if you ask me wheather chucking a whole load of stones on a 60 mph road and not putting the road lines back is safe I'd have to go with ""OH HECK NO!""  Went to work via the Frodsham motorway junction as the Helsby one was closed so missed it all then, but coming back I thought I'd chance it.  Driving at 20 mph on a 60 road is no fun and also as there are no lines the people (and this means almost everyone) who normally follow the white line in the middle of the road had no idea where they are supposed to go and sort of drift between the pavement and alarmingly over what would be the middle line.  Well I think Cheshire County Council Road Division have lost their collective minds!  Shall be fun for the next week or so until they decide it needs fixing.

Erm what else happened on Monday?!  Nothing that I can think of now.  So I shall sign off here so I can do a Tuesday post.</lj-cut>

Toodles!

"event","<lj-cut text=""peace and relaxation"">Well today was quite a nice day actually there was some sun, though a cool breeze which is good, but still cool breeze.

Someone nearby our house must have gone out for the day setting the house alarm and leaving a window open, which meant with the breeze the alarm kept going off this morning.  I think one of their neighbours finally realised what was going on around lunch time as it didn't happen again after that.

Caught up on Cold Case, CSI:NY, Human Target and finally SkyOne decided to play random episodes of Hawaii Five-O.  So glad they did because I missed the very beginning of the pilot when it first showed.  Meant I now get everything better!

I was searching out info about Lie To Me and found out the Fox in America have cancelled not only it, but Human Target and The Chicago Code which I really like :( It's like Veronica Mars and Gilmore Girls all over again.  Justin and I were talking about it the other day and saying that they should do a one-off you know round off episode to finish each program they cancel so that viewers don't get left hanging in midair thinking oh it'll all be sorted in the next series.  Hmm maybe I should send a suggestions e-mail to all the tv networks?!  Not that they are likely to you know listen to little Old me!

Tomorrow hopefully will be a quiet day as I'm back in the office, but Lindsay is back from his 2 weeks in Florida and I'm the only one in my room so he's likely to come and bug me.  Possible escape plan is that I know my desk will be full of work that needs doing before the end of the month so I can shoo him away with that.  I have managed to put more music on my Zen so all the more exciting things to listen to in my room tomorrow!

Right well I'd best get to sleep as I need to be up early due to the silly council closing the major roads out of the villages to the motorways tomorrow.  It shall be a fun fun trip tomorrow I can tell!</lj-cut>

Nighty night

Anyways spent the day dealing with an evil stabbing earache and an annoying flicker eye, both happening to be on the left so I think my left side has been on strike today!  Not that it bothers me too much really just another thing to tell the optician man next Saturday.

Me and Mummy & Daddy went out for dinner at this little Italian in Northwich tonight and it was rather good.  We will probably go back again sometime.

Anyway that was my day so I'm going to try and sleep of the flicker!

"event","<lj-cut text=""Not really descriptive, but I did go"">I feel educated today!  Went to both lectures like I said I knew I would end up doing.  They were rather good actually and the people talking weren't professionals but amatures who dug locally and were really passionate about the subject and wanted to share that.  Really should get myself to a dig sometime, but I know the whole time I'd be creaking at the knees when I had to kneal and I'd never manage to get myself back up again!  I'm not even 30 and my knees have deserted me!

They are having a Roman Festival in September 24th-25th where they have re-enactments and all sorts of other exciting things.  The downside is that that is the weekend I shall be in Edinburgh with Mummy and Daddy.  I know I could take the train home, actually I could take the late train home on the Saturday and try and go, but I doubt that's likely to happen.  I spoke to the woman who's involved in such things and she said next year it's going to be WWII so I'd LOVE to go see that so I might search out somewhere else that's got a Roman weekend on sometime.  They have ""The Ermine Street Guard"" doing the re-enactments and they are supposed to be brilliant.  Ho hum we'll see!</lj-cut>

Right so sleep now and then maybe tomorrow I'll be you know actually productive or something, but please don't hold your breath or you might turn blue!

"event","<lj-cut text=""writing for the sake of it"">Not that I've really done much today except auditing, but it's always such a long day.  No breaks just work work work from 9am to 5.30pm and then a lovely 45minute drive either side.  No wonder the last two days I haven't awoken before my alarm, but when it rings.

Dan is the least subtle person when asking for tea and it's not as if he can't do it you know?!  It's just so annoying to spend 3 days with him.  It doesn't seem so bad when Clair's there but maybe it's cos she's a girl and Justin was there this time and he's a boy and him and Dan spent the time burbling Cricket etc.  Not that I don't mind them burbling Cricket and I tend to burble my rubbish no matter what, but still frustration.  Or maybe just me being a grump!

They just said that it was the end of ""Lie To Me"" as in <b>THE END.</b>  That's rather said if that's the truth 'cos I rather love it.  I think DVD buying is in my future.

So tomorrow is lectures on Romans.  I want to go, but then again I don't know if I do.  We'll see.  I know if I go it will be interesting, but bah I'm being lame.  I think it's the ""I'm tired and not being social and happy"" talking at the moment.</lj-cut>

Right I'm tangenting and sleep typing so I'm actually going to do the sleeping and hopefully be all awake tomorrow!

"event","<lj-cut text=""I talk about audits...they are not exciting!"">Today wasn't as bad as I had forecast, but still wasn't the best to be sitting in an office with my boss.  The new audit place was really nice and rather easy to do.  The problem came with my getting lost finding the place then almost getting squished by a lorry that didn't even pause before entering a small roundabout which I was going all the way round so I could correct where I'd gotten lost.  Found the clients, but Dan was late and I wasn't sure I had the right place and I didn't have anything I could do until Dan arrived so no hope really.  Spent most of the day there and then headed to the other place for the last 2 hours of the day.  All in all a better than normal day of audit, but still a day of audit.


I can't believe that Justin said he's never done audit before.  I mean he's qualified which means you have to have a certain number of hours of audit and you need to sit an exam in audit, which admittadly really isn't relevant to audit, but still doing audit does help with understanding the exam.  I said he needed to check purchase invoices and sales invoices through the system and link one to the other and he just looked at me as if I was talking some completely weird language.  The I explained what to do in transaction analysis because it has to be done and Yvonne always always asks for it for the tax.  I mean he's supposed to do this sort of stuff in normal accounting.  I know it's not strictly the same, but I always try to check invoices especially if they are in a category that will be asked about or they are of a large-ish figure.  I worry about his work, actually I know to worry about his work because I've followed up the year after he's done something and just gone ""right ignore that lets got to an even earlier year to check some stuff"" 'cos it's just awful and He'd not even updated the system on loads of clients for the new regulations that came out in April.  We are in July and if he didn't know how to do it he could have just come and asked me.  I dispair!

Watched ""body of proof"" and ""castle"" tonight.  I can tell body of proof is going to become my new Tuesday obsession and I love castle - tonight Loker (for Lie to Me) was in it as new writer and Castle was all jealous of the time he was spending with Beckett.  It was so sweet and Awwww!  They so totally need to get together though!</lj-cut>

So that's about it for now tomorrow I should have finished with audit for a month and then friday is Roman lecture day!

Night night

"event","<lj-cut text=""I say is it really still raining"">Was in the office today which was good, but this leads to the whole 3 days following stuck with just Dan and Justin out at clients looking at their boring records.  I'm seriously going to be bashing my head against the nearest brickwall by the end of Thursday!  It's just mean the Clair wont be coming as she's off to Florida, Orlando to be precise, on Friday and therefore is not allowed out play so she can finish everything in the office.  I'm just jealous that she's off to Orlando and will be able to go to Harry Potter World and all those lovely exciting places :(

Why is it that when there is a little bit of rain, well little compared to Sunday which was more like a monsoon as it didn't really stop all day, that people seem to remove their brains and find it completely impossible to drive.  It's the same road that they've been driving for however many years or days, but for some reason they suddenly can't remember how to drive.  This removal of brain usually means that I'm late for work which doesn't actually bother me apart from the stupid that they present!  Hopefully tomorrow morning they will have found their brains and can sort of remember what driving means!

Did I mention that I might have ordered myself 3 new travel books on Saturday?  Well I did and they arrived today and I'm all ""oooh plan plan plan!""  Two specific Washington DC book and one Trips around Washington, New York and the North East.  So I'm thinking I'm going to have to actually plan a road trip for next year and do it!  Actually I've got a road trip book for New England too which I want to make use of, but haven't had the chance.  Hmm I need to win the lottery or something so I have the time to do all this travelling.  I've never driven on the other side of the road - it could be quite an adventure!

I suppose this is the point at which I should actually go to sleep as to get to the client's tomorrow I have to leave early.  Especially as it's the first day and I can't roll in 5 minutes late, nor do I know which Shirt and Trousers I shall wear oh the choices.</lj-cut>

So night night and a good sleep to you!

Love

<lj-cut text=""you can skip the bore!"">Cleared out a lot of stuff from my wardrobe this morning - not sure I should have done that with everything, but it's done now and it's all in the charity bag and therefore no going back...tho come to think of it I might ask my mum to rescue this one shirt that I do rather like.

Becky, Graeme's Girlfriend, came to dinner tonight so that was a chnage in the normal Sunday routine.

I should probably be getting to sleep as I have work tomorrow and then 3 days of audit with Dan and Justin, I really don't want to do it, but what can you do?  Blah I'm going to be ready to scream by Friday!

Top Gun was just on.  I love that film!  I need to ask Ben if he's seen it, he's a highly deprived child as he has no idea what half the programs are nor films that are essential watching.  Poor boy, though I guess I wont be suggesting Velvet Goldmine to him ;)!</lj-cut>

Hmm sleep and then work how much fun!

<lj-cut text=""Nothing to report, but a promise is a promise"">Bought myself several new travel guides to Washington DC which should make planning a trip for next year a lot easier, thought I do have a list longer than my arm ready to go without them!

Been watching Cold Case and CSI: New York again.  Oh and finally found where and when they repeat sky1's Thursday night programs - 10pm on a Saturday night so from now on I shall have to bookmark them.

Actually Mum & Dad came home with a new sky box today and I think they are going to put that in the lounge and Dad said I could have the old one upstairs as it actually records which would be brilliant, but I actually don't mind my skybox and I know it works.  The one downstairs is a bit slow and doesn't like being turned off - quite noisy too...I shall have to think on it and see if I can get a new Plus boxs for me.</lj-cut>

"event","Hey!

I don't think this is spoilery, but well you never know so cut cut cutty cut cut! (I think everyone has read the books by now and really I don't describe owt really just my usual rambles!

<lj-cut text=""Harry Potter Part 1 and 2"">Well last night was brilliant and so worth the 6 hours and a numb bum and sleepy afterwards!  The first film was just as good as it was last time I saw it.  Still made me cry and laugh.  The thing was they got the wrong film first of all.  They started showing the Subtitled version which meant that they had to stop it, after about 15 minutes and then they restarted with the un-subtitled version.

The second movie, well it was really brilliant with lots of action and dueling and yes people dying which made me cry lots, but it was great.  19 years later was brilliant, but where the heck was Teddy?  I know they couldn't put everything in to the movie that was in the book but some bits seemed to be rushed.  I know I'll always love the books the best, but I'd give the movies their dues.  Hmm Draco looking older ;) that was so funny and Lucius, Narcissa and Draco running away.  Oh and Older Harry, Hermione, Ron & Ginny just great!  Snape just tortured and so sad, but you can see how much of a puppet master Dumbledore was.  I think he did care, but he kept looking at the big picture at the expense of those around him.  It wasn't too bad in 3D for which I am greatful as the other 3D movies I have seen have been hard to watch really.  I am going to watch it in 2D though so I can see bits I might have missed etc.  Also it's awfully hard to sort out the tears when you're wearing glasses with glasses over the top of them!  Definitely a good ending to 13 odd years of Harry Potter.

Got home at 3am, woke at 6.35am and was like ""oh not too bad feel fine I think I'll try for a bit more sleep"", woke at 7.15am and was like ""oh so bad awfull I think I had half an hour too much sleep I'll try a bit longer"" finally 9.20am and it was ""oh good again I'll sort of get up and relax"".  Spent the day surfing the net, watched some tv and trying not to take a nap.  Failed miserably on the nap thing as by 5.30pm I fell asleep, so now I'm hoping I can sleep properly and be good to go in the morning.</lj-cut>

Not sure what I'm upto this weekend.  I guess I should do something like maybe going to the museum or something equally interesting, we shall see.

Hope you all have a good evening and if you're seeing Harry Potter you need to take tissues!

Night night

I've put eye spray on just so they don't start to hurt too much later on.  Bottles of water are in the fridge and I think I can cave and buy some nibbles at the cinema.  Popcorn I think 'cos it's not like it's 8am and at that time popcorn seems a bit well too early, not that I haven't done it then, but you know what I mean.  They were taking the pee a bit at work, but I don't really care all that much!

Started watching ""Presidio"" with Mark Harmon & Sean Connery.  I LOVE MARK HARMON!  He's all laid back and Coffee not so much Gibbs yet, but he's got the stare going!  Hmm I think I'll finish watching it tomorrow.  When I've recovered!

<lj-cut text=""work was where I got shouted at and I ignored it"">Today Marie got in a strop with me and I quite politely but forcefully said ""Well No I'm not standing for this treatment"".  Well the actual thing went something like this... I'd posted some invoices on sage that I need to complete the accounts for the year end.  I'd ticked everything with a red pen as I <i>always</i> do.  I didn't touch the bank statements etc etc.  When I'd done the accounts I posted all the closing/opening balance adjustments etc etc so everything was perfect for this year.  Now Marie decided to give Lynne the bookkeeping to do, so she gave her the 3 months worth of invoices and bank statments.  I think they must have been looking at the sage to see what was what and found the stuff I'd done and Linda told Marie that I'd finished the accounts.  Marie got all uppity, as she does, and apparantly shouted ""SARA GERRIN' HERE NOW"" (well I live in the next room and I may be deaf a bit, but I can hear if someone wants me and Clair usually tells me anyways)  I was upstairs with Brain chatting about stuff so didn't know about this until I walked down the stairs and passed their door to go to my room.  When she proceeded to shout again, at this point I'm no more that 4 steps away from her so shouting is a bit over enthusiastic really.  Of course I went to see what the shouting was for when she started say ""why have you been playing with this?  I'm giving a job to Lynne and there's no job to do.""  My reply to this was ""I've only posted those invoices with the red ticks and I did it so I could do the accounts""  Marie goes ""They aren't within the year end they didn't need posting"" to which I pointed out that there were 6 invoices dated in the last year which meant they were indeed significant to the account.  She got all pouty and I finally said ""I only posted those invoices, nothing more, nothing less so I could do the accounts.  I've done the closing/opening journals and it's all sorted for the new year.""  Then I walked away to my room.  Clair laughed and said ""Well slap your wrist and that told you"" and I just went ""yeah well I don't care and if I hadn't done it I wouldn't have been able to do their accounts.""  I'm just wondering if she'll try it again on anything I've done.  Not that it bothers me because I just don't listen - rather like I don't listen to Dan!  Though I think I should probably say something to him if we ever have reviews... yeah like they will ever happen!</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""other things that happened today"">Phoned the Opticians this afternoon to see if I could make an appointment due to the lack of focus on general things over specific things, and as yesterday I was watching the golf balls fly and I could see two of them.  The woman who answered was a bit daft and I ended up with 30th July which is a bit far off, but what can one do?  I asked if she could tell me when I last went and she said June 2010 and then said ""you're on a two year call back so you don't have to come in if you don't want to, though if you're having problems you can"" I was like errrrr I wouldn't be phoning for an appointment if I didn't think I needed my eyes testing.  Bah some people can be daft!

In other news watched Castle and it was great as usual!  You know Castle and Beckett are just waiting to get together.  Stupid Beckett!boyfriend getting in the way - I mean they were soooo close to getting together and then he just pops up interrupting.  Maybe soon.

Tomorrow is HP day!  Can't wait, but I'm quite philosophical about it all.  It'll be brilliant and sad, but there are other new films to look forward to in the future (or at least I hope there is)  The thing is there hasn't been a series like the Harry Potter Series and so there is nothing to take it's place at the moment.  The Hobbit when it's out will be epic because you just know anything by Peter Jackson just is and can you imagine how much better all the effects will be compaired to when he did Lord of the Rings and they were the finest!</lj-cut>

Well I've shared this weeks rant and now I'm off to sleep or I shall not be very functionable tomorrow night.

Nighty night

I know it's the wrong season, but well if you look at the weather it is rather cool so I'll let it slide!  So without further ado...<lj-cut text=""I present to you"">

<center><b><u> That Time Of Year </u></b>

Another Year
Has Come and Gone again
Look around
And think where have you been
Trace the Lines
On your face tonight
And don't forget
That this will pass in time

It's cold out this morning
You should be getting into bed
Can't believe its that time
Of year again

Curled up tight
A darker shade of white
Thinking Back could be here for a while

Its cold out this morning
And it's getting harder to pretend
Can't believe it's that time of year again

Can you believe the life you led?
Did you achieve the goals you set?
Did you lose your mind?
Well and then

Is there a reason you own them
It is a season that won't end
Can't believe it That time of year again

Another year
Has come and gone again
Look around
and wonder what happened</center>

Today was one huge yawn and I mean that literally.  Couldn't stop from 9am this morning until I got home!  Not a lot of excitement except for golf tonight which was alright on the whole.  Managed to get it to do what I wanted, though seeing double is not a good thing - I suppose I shall have to go make an appointment with the opticians this weekend.  *Le Sigh*  It's all this hard work you know it's really not good for me ;)

Going to leave work round about 2.45 on Thursday as missing lunch tomorrow and Thursday.  Need time to get home relax, shower, pack my huge bag with provisions etc.  It's like a military operation without you know everything else!

Nothing much to say now I suppose.  I think tomorrow I might post the lyrics to ""Bitter and Blue"" by Michael Weatherly as it's brilliant.  So in love with his singing.

Toodles for now!

"event","<lj-cut text=""Mixing and jumping between topics"">Really why is Monday morning so hard to deal with?  It's not that different to the rest of the week, but the actual ability to move out of bed and wake up just FAIL!  I guess if I was in a room by myself on a Monday I'd manage it better as I'd be all ""Headphones In, Volume Up, Huge Cup of Tea, Head Down, Work"".  I couldn't work from home really on a serious basis as I'd be all ""I'll get up in like 10..."" 2 hours later ""yeah that's probably a good idea to move now!""

I'm loving the NCIS Soundtrack (Volume 2) It's got Michael Weatherly singing his own song ""Bitter and Blue"" Mmmmmmmm!  He definitely should do some singing on the show because well it would be great.  Actually someone wrote a fic where Tony sang in a random bar which I really liked, but as usual didn't bookmark.  You'd think after oh 10 years I'd remember to book or at least note down.  Actually that's what I started to do yesterday by starting a notepad file copying links from my History.  I'm sure there must be a better way of doing it, but I don't know it so I'll just continue the slow way.

But back to songs... Volume 1 has Abbey & Ziva singing so I'm hoping to listen to them tomorrow.  Car volume nice and high ;)  Could be interesting as the second cd to Volume 1 is ""Abbey's Lab"" Heee arriving at the same time as my boss should be a good laugh, though he's off tomorrow ""YES!"".

It's National Archaeology Week next week and there are two lectures in Middlewich next Friday so I've decided that I'm taking the day to go listen to people talking about Romans.  I did explain to Dan what Archaeology was by say ""It's being in a field digging up dead people""  His reply was ""I know what it is"" Mhmmm yes well I was clarifying for your uneducated brain ;)

Golf tomorrow.  Keep missing every other lesson.  I like going, but I just can't be bothered and when I get back home I'm all awake again.  Pah.  I should just go out and play an actual round.  When I find time, well yes I know that's what I could do on the weekend, but when I get to the weekend the plans get hidden behind me being sleepy.</a>

Off to sleep now I think.  I'll be awake and bouncy tigger like tomorrow yes I will...Ok well half awake maybe ;)

<lj-cut text=""a whole lot of nada!"">That is to say I did nada except read some, watched Quincy, Cold Case, CSI: New York, played a bit of Spider Solitair and finally came Hawaii Five-O, which I am rather annoyed at because I assume that was the end of the series as there is no series link on my sky reminder and it left us hanging so high in mid-air I'm scared to look down!  But as usual it was great, apart from the hanging!

Tomorrow is of course Monday, which means shopping at Tescos or Morrisons before work.  Actually even though Tescos milk seems to go off quicker than anyone elses it's just easier to buy from them as Morrisons tills are really stupid and annoying! Bah I'll see which way my car turns in the morning!

Kathryn's off to a job interview Tomorrow in Oxford so I'm  sending her very happy, good, calm thoughts. It'll be an excuse to actually go down to Oxford if she gets it.  But I will be jealous and want to move!

I've been looking at plans for Washington DC next year. Well I've been making plans in my head and hoping that I can pursuade Michelle to go do it all with me!  Everytime I go to Washington I spend a whole week going to the museums and I really want to go and see other places around Washington.  I suppose it would have to be a sort of 2 week holiday to get everything done. I mean to hire a car and visit Shanendoah National Park and Rock Creek and all sorts of places in Virginia and Maryland.  Hmmmm if I was brave enough to hire a car by myself I'd go do it But I think I would too scared!  Yes I know I travelled alone, but for some odd reason hiring a car and just doing daytrip-y overnight things seems to scare me see

A Very Very lazy day today, but for all the lazy good.  Spent until 1 lying around reading then sped up to Kathryn's for a quick chat and to drop off the stuff that I'd meant to give her on Thursday, but completely forgot to pick up in my haste to head out.  Actually managed to forget it again today which meant taking a circle route back home to pick it up and head out again, but I blame Spud for parking behind my car and making me move them both.

Wizzed down from Kathryn's to the village to meet Zoe for coffee which was great fun!  She got me Yankee Candles for my birthday and they are brilliant!  Candy Corn and Pumpkin :D

From there it was a quick trip home to change for birthday dinner with my parents and Nanna.  Went to The Travellers Rest and the food is good there, so I think it'll be good for a quick trip out when the parents are away and possible for meeting people.

Not a lot to say though have listened to the NCIS Soundtrack Volume 2 which I got yesterday and it's really good.  It's got Michael Weatherly singing on it and I rather liked his song.  Next I have to listen to Volume 1 and see what the other actors/singers are like.

<lj-cut text=""short and sweet, well short and boring more like!"">Boring day at work today as I ran out of stuff to do and it was a very wet friday.  Doesn't the rain always make the day seem longer and slower, unless you're out walking in it which is much more fun.  And I think working over the lunch hour made it longer.  1 hour and 15 minutes left to make up and all will be well with the world again!

Watched ""Human Target"" tonight - well catching up from last night when I missed everything, but then I couldn't watch most of it because there were spiders involved.  When they give the warnings like ""the following program involves flashing lights which might not be suitable for people with photo-sensitve epilepsy"" they should include warnings for spiders.  I mean it's a serious phobia and lots of people have it.  I've missed whole parts of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and Lord of the Rings because of the spiders.

Oooh it's raining lots again and if I wasn't at home or at least if my parents weren't home or Graeme, 'cos he'd tell on me or tell me off anyway, I'd totally go for a late night walk in the rain.  Haven't done the late night walking since uni.  Used to go up to the Wallace Monument at night or well sunrise - always managed to miss actual sunrise though!  Never did it in my Caeligh dress and heels though.

Everyone keeps asking me if I've seen HP yet and it's like ""NOOOOOO how many times do I have to say it?!  It's not out until next week gah!""  Then again it doesn't really interest them so they aren't really going to listen and remember stuff like that are they?

Tomorrow we're out for tea with my Nanna, Graeme's not going as he's off to some festival thing in Leeds or near there at any rate.  Will be interesting I think.  We're trying a new place to eat so I'll report more on that tomorrow.

It seems to be the end of Hawaii Five-O on Sunday which is awfully sad.  Hope there's something good to replace it at 9pm on a Sunday night.

Ok so whilst it's still Friday I'll toddle off to sleep, or at least to read some random things for a bit before crashing.</lj-cut>

Hope you're all having a good Friday and looking forward to a relaxing weekend.

Love S xxx"

"event","Hey!

So I've made it to day two and I'm posting again!  Yay me :D!

<lj-cut text=""update of my boring life"">Today has been rather normal, well except that there was Birthday Cake with my two O'clock tea so that was a good change!

It was completely pointless having my car valeted on Monday when Daddy took it to get the new tyres put on because all it's done since then is rain and make it all dirty on the outside and I'm thinking the carpet on my side of the car is going to  be white from the stupid gravel at work.  But she does look awfully spiffy since being properly cleaned - I might have to actually continue to get it done without resorting to getting a flat tyre!

Went up to Cheshire Oaks this evening to meet Mike and Kathryn for coffee, well in my case tea but who's quibbling about such trivial differences?!  Chatting and planning our business - coffee shop/tea shop/ etc etc.  It's a nice dream, but the actual being able to put into practise well it's not a reality - costs too much and the odds of failure are stacked pretty high.  And as usual Kathryn and I stood about for ages after talking!  It's like the lift home thing where we sit forever talking, but at least then you're in a car that's warmer than hanging around outside.

The premier of HP was tonight and I've recorded the SkyOne program thingy so I'll watch that tomorrow I guess.  It's scary that this era is coming to an end as of Midnight next Thursday.  Not sure how I'll deal with that, though it'll probably be quite sensibly after balling my eyes out over what happens in the movie!

Right well it's late and I need to sleep off this headache.  It must be gone by next thursday.</lj-cut>

So night night and I'm all proud I've managed two days of my task!

Well the exam didn't seem too bad.  The scary thing is that in section 2 it balanced - its an imposibility that it could balance I'm sure it is.  Ah well the only thing to do now is wait for August the whatever.  Well that and get through the awfully annoying questions tomorrow of ""how did it go?"" and then for the next however many weeks of ""when do your results come out?""

"event","Probably another failure really!  Well it's that time of year again when one gets stressed to the max and continues smiling like the loone I am so noone notices just how stressed I am.

<lj-cut text=""yes and it just bounces topic to topic!"">Took last friday and today off to revise as the exam is tomorrow morning.  As to the revision schedule not so much, but I have tried relaxing which has helped.  I don't feel as ill as I did.  It can't be good to get so worried about things that you make yourself feel ill.  Not that anyone at work would notice.  Can't really let on because at the end of the day noone really cares there.  I keep thinking to myself just this many more to go and then you can leave.  It's just never ending and this many more really isn't shrinking - well that's my fault for failing, but lets pretend I didn't just say that and say the universe (or examiners) are conspiring against me!

I was a bit of an idiot on Friday - made myself an appointment to go to the doctors on Tuesday afternoon, which would be find, but I'd been promising myself a trip to the big museum in Liverpool after my exam, so I suppose that isn't going to happen now.  Oh well I'll just have to put it off again for a while.

Not a lot really happening in my world, though there are several people now engaged and getting married and others that are reaching the grand-old age of <b>30!</b> shock horror!  I shall be joining them next year and so far my plans for that extend to taking a loooooong holiday and treating myself.  If that happens it should be brilliant, but if not well another dream to postpone I guess.  Maybe when I'm 35 or 40 or... and it just goes on!  Hopefully by the time I'm 35 or at the most 40 I'll have a house of my own.  Well that's another dream that's rather wispy and transparent.

Hmmm I've been thinking that as of 6th July I shall be 29 heading to 30 so to mark such a transition and important year I should and will endeavour to post at least once a day, or if unable to post one day make several the next possible day.  It shall be a documentation of my very boring a sad life, but well on the whole that is what life is isn't it.  Everyday a plod until a sudden rush flash and than back to the plod again.  Maybe I shall spend the year playing the lottery and you never know ""it could be me""!  I doubt it, but ""you've got to be in it to win it"" right?!

Miss the uni life - well mostly as I do like seeing that monthly amount going into my bank. It's the whole freedom.  Not necessarily the lack of structure as I fail miserably when there is none, case in point my dissertation and my current professional exams!  It's living my life in my space and doing things when and how I want.  I know if I had my own space I'd fail at doing anything productive or on time, but I'd have the intention and I would most definitely employ a cleaner - I just have no wish to clean and it would be my one luxury I'd even forgo all my favourite tv just to pay for it!

I suppose I'm too polite a person - can someone be too polite I wonder?  I suppose today yes people can.  I defer to my elders, who are not necessarily my betters and nor do they know better, but still I defer as I was taught to treat them with respect.  I don't interrupt people when they are talking, which can get rather annoying when I can't remember what I wanted to say when they have finished talking or the topic has moved on which makes what I want to say completely redundant anyways.  I don't use rude words outside of my head, though on occasion I will whisper them or get them most of the way out before I change them into something completely harmless like ""fudge"" or ""flip"" or ""anchor"" etc.  I don't talk back and I don't shout and I don't show if I'm angry or hurt or a million other things.  I smile politely at all times and agree and stew in my head.  Hmmmm I suppose one day it will all explode - it's fun when it happens, but afterwards not so much that's when I have to deal with myself and worry about what people think of me and well years later I still go over the situation that I exploded in and wonder if I'd done something different things wouldn't have exploded so spectaularly!

Life is what you make it, so if you find things not working out you should have an exit strategy and move towards something that does work.  Wonder what a part qualified accountant can do or change into.  Maybe that tea shop is a good idea, but it become a reality is an imposibility with out backing and all the rest of it.  I like what I do, but I'm not sure I like where I do it or is the people I do it with?  I'm not sure and I suppose the people are really in-offensive, though some of them are just made to rub everyone up the wrong way.

Tonight is Glee - I think it may be the end of the series.  I hope it's a good and happy one because last weeks was awfully sad.  The writers on everything seem to be making the end couple of episodes of all series terribly sad and making me cry.  Bones there was poor Mr Nigel Murray - cried my eyes out.  They made up for it with the Bones/Booth ending and his face at the end soooo cute and happy - I have always loved it when he smiles both here and when there was the occasional crack in the ""broody vampire"" look of Buffy and Angel.  Murdoch Mysteries such an awful cliff-hanger I mean it just stopped and now I have to wait another million months before the new series is on.  I was majorly not happy over Julia getting married.  Everyone was an idiot and didn't see that William was completely in love and would do anything and last season she had just run off with out giving him the chance to tell her he didn't care and still wanted her.  Poor boy.  NCIS now two weeks ago ""Swan Song"" cried at that one.  How could they kill Franks and Poor Gibbs.  Then the end of the season Tony's all being read in and there's a picture, but who's he going to be shadowing and argh I think it's Leon (he still annoys me grrr evil), but he was in the room when Tony looked at the picture.  It can't be Gibbs and it can't be the team, but then the eyebrow when he saw the picture someone close I think it is.  So yes another million years to wait for details.  Castle well I'm not sure they keep jumping from ""Oh noes that's mean"" and ""Oh my that is hysterical and brilliant"".  Hmm all the series started together and they are all slowly finishing which means at least 6 months or so with nothing interesting to watch except repeats.  Well there is new Lie to Me so that's good, but still hum.</lj-cut>

I think I've finished with my kangaroo impression for the day - I just can't stick to one topic at a time.  Does this bode well or ill for tomorrow, who knows.  Either way I will be waiting until August the something to find out if I managed to royally mess up again or not.  I'm hoping not as I can't bring myself to do it again (I think this might be either sitting 3 or 4 so yeah)

Hope it's all shiny and good or at least there are some silver linings in your world.

"event","Yes I'm back and as per usual I'm here to rant...

Had my review at work today.<lj-cut text=""the whole or most of the tale"">

Wasn't bad really, just the usual you should be doing harder jobs instead of doing the jobs you're happy with.  My response in my head and the one I really wanted to give instead of the polite ""Oh yes I know, I'll be happy to do anything I'm given"" was <i>""Yes well if you assigned the harder jobs to me I'd do them, but you don't so what the flip do you expect me to do other than those with my name by them?  And for that matter I don't do all flaming sage jobs it's just your stupid clients that are sage jobs if you look at my other ones they vary twonk man!""</i>

Notes and Queries are only for important things that have happened in the accounts, I don't need to know that you wrote off 57p on this account.
Polite me: ""Oh Ok""
Head me: <i>""Yes well if I wanted to do a sloppy half arsed job like you do because you can get away with making crap up when people ask you questions I'd not put everything down so no one knows what the heck I've done and nor do I and then next year I'll be as clueless as you.  And when tax ask me what's going on I'll just reply 'well I would have made a note about it, but you see it wasn't an <b>important</b> happening so I didn't and I forget what it was and why I did it :D' ""</i>

Timekeeping is a bit off some people aren't too happy seeing you turn up at 9.02, 9.03am especially when they are here early and you know have the hour lunch and then go home ontime.
Polite me: ""Well yes I suppose, but I get stuck in traffic and there isn't anything I can do about that.  I tend to work over the beginning of lunch anyway to cover it.  Is it a strict 9-5.15?  Because if it is well I'll do that.""
Head me: <i>""I spent 2 and a half to 3 years being in the office half an hour early did I get anything for it?  No of course not I did not get to go home early or have a longer lunch or anything.  The other thing is I live at least 45minutes away if someone decides that 30mph is the speed they want to do there is nothing I can do about it.  Everyone else (except Justin whom everyone seems to be unhappy with anyway and lives down the road from me) lives within a 20 minute at the most drive and I know they get traffic too, but no matter what time I leave there is bound to be some idiots either end of the motorway that can't tell what National Speed Limit means nor how to drive.  It's not like I'm not in the town before 9am it's just getting from the traffic lights at the beginning of town up to the office if you have a teleporting device please let me use it and I'll be there on time!""</i>

Queries shouldn't be written for my to ask you should phone the clients and ask them yourself.
Polite me: ""I suppose so, but it does give you something to ask the clients when you talk to them""
Head me: <i>""Well you should earn your money somehow.  I mean you don't do much so to justify charging that much to a client for a chat with you you might as well ask them a few questions, makes it look like you're actually involved with what's going on instead of just sitting at your desk all day insulting your sister on MSN!""</i>

Oh dear I'm doing the bitca rant here aren't I?!

The thing is I just want to know who it is that's annoyed with me over being a few minutes late?  Is it Dan because he sure as heck can't say anything, even if he is the boss's son and a shiny new director, he gets in as late or later than me some times and he lives 10minutes at the most.  Lindsay yeah well he's the boss so can say what he wants.  But what if it's Clair or Yvonne?  I know they've both had their reviews and well I don't want them angry at me or at least thinking/saying bad things about me.  Maybe it was just Dan trying to say he wants me there early but trying to make it sound like others had made mention of it.  I think I'm over analyzing which as we all know I do to distraction and then we end up with me getting in a huge tiz and doing something silly like hand in my notice to go traveling...

Then there is the question 'Is there anyone you're not getting along with?  Want to say anything about?'  Does that mean that people have been moaning about me?  Like they have about Justin?  I know it's not nice to be passive and not say anything when people talk about others, but I'm a coward and on the whole not a very pushy person.  Well I am, but if there's more than one person I'm talking to I just sort of clam up.  Hmmm see this is why I get all worked up and stress out for weeks and months because I over analyse things that to other people, or the person that says them, don't mean anything like the way I take them.  Or I take them how they mean them and then over think leading to disaster!

I like my job, I like the people, I just don't like how horrid it's getting.  Bring back Brian all is forgiven we need him back from the other office to make ours work smoothly and happily and sort the problems caused by people having no idea what they are doing and then expecting all the people under them to miraculously know what's to be done how and when.

I did post on my facebook page words about over analyzing and wishing to ask a question that you know wont and can't be answered (meaning about who's been saying what) and wondering if I'd made someone angry at me.  Marie replied as follows ""I can see I've not taught you anything in the two years we've known each other matey. Do what I would do - and you know politeness and tact are not my middle names. And I would be surprised if you could anger someone - you're so inoffensive. I think we need a skool of toughening up!!! Now have a glass of something alcoholic and chill ;-) x""  For which reply I'm very happy about as she works with me and is usually there when people talk, but it's still going to bug me all weekend as I'm a stresshead!

Reviews are like parents evenings, but without your parents going and talking to teachers to find out totally haven't been doing the homework and you're in a huge mess and they come home to shout at you!  Not that any action will be taken really as I'm completely the wrong gender to be taken note of in our office!  It's a boyz rule kinda place, but see what would happen if all us girls (there are 7 of us that do the main work) walked out.  Kerpoof!

Oh and I asked why I hadn't had a pay rise when in the past I'd gotten one when I passed my exams.  Last year I passed 2 exams and got nothing and wasn't told anything either.   Ben got a payrise when he's results came out.  Dan's response was ""Oh I don't know I'll have to have a look at it, but I don't have anything to do with the wages.  We're going over the employee handbook so that things will be the same in all the offices.""  Yes that's nice, but that doesn't help me now does it and I've missed out on 2 payrises in the past year.

Ok I'd best sign off here and now before I get anymore stressed out or you know bore anyone reading this any more!</a>

I'll just say night night and Love to all

Even went to a club called ""The Roadhouse"" I wish we could have seen Dean and Sam Winchester there - would have been blooming brilliant! I'd recommend doing the Readers Travel (newspaper) London Weekend trip by rail to London and staying at the Guoman Tower hotel.

Off to Edinburgh next weekend to see the girls.  Can't wait really.  I have no idea what we'll do, but still it's good to just go up there.

Tonight we went to ""The Fox and Barrel"" at Cotebrook for Mother's Day, we being Mummy, Daddy, Graeme, Nanna & Becky (Graeme's girlfriend).  Lovely meal and just all round a good day.

Started going to Golf lessons once a week - quite fun, but at the same time I really can't be bothered.  I'm definately old before my time!

"event","You must admit that House/Wilson is cannon!  Was watching the end of House last night, the one where House's Dad has died and they are so a couple!  Like when Wilson started going out with Amber (or do I mean Amanda?)  I can't remember her name at the mo and I really can't be bothered to imdb it, so we shall be left in limbo on that one!  What was I saying?  Oh no I know House/Wilson!  She was a sort of a House!sub as House said.

Watching ""The Mentalist"" love this show, and if they'd just do ""The Guardian"" repeats too that would be brill!  Yesterday they were showing ""Blind Justice"" which is another good show.  Hmmmm bad good tv - makes me not do other things, which I'm sure could be important, but who wants to do those sort of things when they can be distracted much more easily?!

<lj user=""branwen777hp""> just brilliant stories!  Oh and the vids they are great too!  Erm yes to be specific ""<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/tools/memories.bml?user=branwen777hp&keyword=Nothing+Left+To+Hold&filter=all"">Nothing to Hold</a> <small><a href=""http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4992277/1/Nothing_Left_To_Hold"">fanfiction.net</a></small>.  It's got song on each chapter which you can listen to and if you want to download.  Rather like <lj user=""ldyghst_music""> does for the supernatural, wish there were somewhere to get a similar thing for the HP fandom as the Supernatural on.  Maybe there is but I haven't found it yet.

Tea now then I think.  Am dying for a cup!  Though suppose I should take a neocitran first.  Why they don't sell these things here????  They work so well.  Evil pharmacies etc etc!

The outcome of that trip was I am no longer needing to revisit the neurologist as he couldn't find a thing to explain my months of dizzyness and seeing as it's gone now all should be well, though I should be warned that in the future it could happen again.  In the case of it happening again I shall of course go and see someone, but they shall probably say exactly the same thing to me and leave me none the wiser!

So for all intents and purposes I am now well (or something like that!).

Allow me to discover life as I should through living it and learning with every step I take that life holds many things both beyond beautiful and beyond terrible but with out the extremes the middle road will take your spark.

It was the one where Bones suddenly decides she wants to have a baby and that Booth should be the donor.  Then he has these hallucinations.  Those parts of it were really funny, but then they had to make it all sad and he's face was all like a puppy and he wibbled Booth did that brave little boy face and right there floods of tears from me!  Nothing will happen to him, no because it can't.  I just want them to get together and then they can be a happy weird family, Bones Booth Parker and baby.

Other news...Clark/Bruce oh my I followed a link on <lj comm=""sv_inquiry""> and found myself reading <a href=""http://romanyg.livejournal.com/135779.html"">On The Half Shell pt.1.</a> and <a href=""http://romanyg.livejournal.com/136067.html"">pt.2.</a> by <lj user=""romanyg""> and then I had to read more of her fics and now I'm in love with Brark or Cluce or what ever you want to call it.  Haven't ventured past <lj user=""romanyg"">'s fics so far, but I think I shall be branching out to read other people's now.  Like I need another pairing - not that I'm really complaining it's a nice change somewhere else to go for a bit!  Now I have pictures on Christian Bale and Tom Welling together and boy are they pretty in my head!  Lex is being quite at the moment, but I'm sure he'll want to play soon too!

Well bed then work then weekend and revision and then week off work for revision then weekend again then exam and then audit.  Blah boring life they should pay me to not do the work/study they should pay me to read stories all day.   Maybe I should have become a librarian or something.

Anyway...I think I must admit that I do prefare to be bored at work than bored at college.  At least here I can still get on LJ or occasionally my e-mails if the blocky-thing isn't being mean at the time.

So yep been away for a week come back and nothing to do.  Ho hum!  Actually I'm waiting for Pat to decide there is something for me to do for all the payroll year ends...I might be waiting a long time as he tends to worry things to death - he's worse than me people and that's <i>BAD</i> lol!

Friday I didn't get to have sushi because in the afternoon in college I felt bad so decided that going home and being pitiful in an empty house was the best way to go.  Ended up with soup and hotdogs as I really didn't want anything to eat.  Have you ever actually read the ingredients on the side of the hotdog tin?  They so don't sound as appetising when you do that!  Not that it put me off, nope not me I'm adventurous!

Saturday was shopping for my Nanna and then spent a couple of hours with her.  I had meant to actually go out and do something, but alas I didn't.  Forgot to eat dinner, which yeah bad idea, but I didn't feel hungry - not even when my brother and his girlfriend had Chinese takeaway.  Did go and hire videos from Blockbuster which I didn't end up watching.  Instead I got lost reading.

Sunday nothing happened as usual and now...have been found work by the evil Dan boy!  must get to it I suppose."

Tomorrow (or I suppose it's today by looking at the time) is Friday and Mum and Dad are off to the Lakes again.  This has lead me to decide I'm going to wander in LiverpoolOne for a bit and then have an early dinner of Sushi before heading home to take over the lounge.  Might even go out and hire me some movies!

Went to the Lake District yesterday with Michelle.  Was a brilliant day and the weather was suprisingly good considering the forecast that they gave.  We went up to Grasmere for Gingerbread and lunch, then to Near Sorey where Beatrix Potter's home ""Hill Top Farm"" is.  Then back down to Ambleside for a wander before heading over to Burrow where we had dinner at The Highway Man.

Am off to college tomorrow which I can't be bothered to do.  I'd actually rather head to work and be completely bored there instead of going to college.  Blah only 4 more weeks and I don't have to worry about it again until August.

"event","<lj-cut text=""not a lot just a ramble"">Late late late!  Was 45 minutes late for work and there was no reason for it... well there was the rain, which makes people remove their brains and forget how to drive.  Hence sitting in a lovely traffic jam on a rainy monday morning and not even an exciting crash to drive past.  Brian asked me if I'd overslept or been stuck in traffic I wanted to say that even if I'd overslept I would have been there quicker - there is no way my Mum would let me sleep later than 8am which means I have time to jump in the shower (no washing of hair though) and can still be out before 8.30 and up to 8.30 I can be in work by 9.15, which admittedly is late, but that's still well before 9.45.

Bah humbug.

Holidays are going to be new next week, well from this Friday actually, and because I had to save what was left of this years hols for college I shall be using most of them for college in the next 3 weeks.  4 days next week in college and the last 4 days of May as it's the bank holiday weekend and my exam is 1st June (and a monday!)  Contemplating staying in town again for that one just incase.  I know I can't be that unlucky again, but still you never know do you seeing as it's the same exam...!

Need to plan what to do with a whole year of shiny new holidays... 1 day off for my birthday because it's my birthday and I never go into work on my birthday.  1 day off for the new Harry Potter movie.  After that I suppose there are 3 days between christmas and new year, which all depends on Lindsay deciding when the floaty holiday is.  Hmm 5 days gone already and if I'm still studying that'll be another 8/9 days gone.  Looks like it'll have to be one holiday this year, how flaming depressing is that?!  Or I can work overtime to go to college, but there is no work to do overtime on so yeah not going to work - they don't give overtime for sitting at your desk (I think they should!)

How has it gotten to 11.15pm already?? I sort of dozed off before but Spud ran up the stairs and made a lot of noise waking me properly.  Wishing for sleep I am!</lj-cut>

In that case I shall finish now and attempt sleep.

"event","Hyphenated Surnames.

Is there a rule about them?  Is it the man's name that goes first and the woman's second? Or could it be alphabetical?  Or is it based on how famous (in the case of important people e.g. scientists, sports people, tv/film people etc etc) they are?  Or is it plain and simple they try out both combinations to find which one sounds better and stick with that?

I know in quite a lot of fic when the characters marry (esp in slash) they hyphen which is fine, but why?  I mean they could just move it to be a middle name, or pass it on to children as their middle name.  I guess for slash it's a bit harder as they have to decide who's surname they'd drop ie making them the 'girl' still they could just use the one surname and do the middle name thingy with their own surname.

Hmm I think at heart I'm an old fashioned girl who thinks that you take your husbands name when you marry and if you have children you can be mean and give them two middle names making one of them your surname!  Though this tends to make the most sense for boys because surnames tend to sound boyish I think.  Yes I know Lesley can be boy/girl as can many others, but not my point!

<lj-cut text=""fic examples"">So here I have a few examples of hypenated surnames nabbed from fic, yes showing some of my OTP's and everything lol!

Potter-Malfoy Vs Malfoy-Potter

Potter-Snape Vs Snape-Potter

Potter-Black Vs Black-Potter (On this one I really don't like the second options so this proves the simple 'which sounds better' theory!)

Lupin-Black Vs Black-Lupin (I'd have to say it's almost as close a dislike on the second option for this one as the one above, but not as strong.)

Luthor-Kent Vs Kent-Luthor (I just like Clark Luthor! Makes me all smiley!  I refuse to acknowledge Lex Kent EVER!) (Could go with Clark Jerome Kent Luthor making it a second surname which never has to be used...)

Having thought about it what if a child is adopted by someone, but they want to keep their original surname and take on the new name too?  Hyphen or middle name????

I know if you're titled you tend to hyphen in deference to the history and blending of estates etc.  I guess when the children marry they don't keep their mother's maiden name of the hyphen, but just add their spouse's name.</lj-cut>

Way too indepth for the moment!  I should be falling asleep as it's now after midnight, but this is me we're talking about.

I'm off to do somemore thinking.

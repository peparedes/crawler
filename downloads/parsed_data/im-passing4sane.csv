"event","So I, Sarah Moritz, am no longer a cheerleader. We went to Pittsburgh for the womens NCAA tournament to play probably the hardest team there, Tennessee, and we lost by 40 points, as predicted by many. I was ready for it to be over though, I didn't really want to go to this tournament but I'm glad I went. It was a great experience, cheering my final game on ESPN 2. We were in Pitt during the 2nd largest St Patrick's day celebration in America and it was CRAZY, drunk people everywhere, cops not caring, magical. 

BUT NOW

I'm sitting in my posh, modern, very square and earthy hotel room in the middle of Bel Air -Los Angeles CA. Today we toured Harvey Mudd... a college my sister is dying to get into. It was beautiful. If it weren't all math and engineering geeks hell, I'd pick up and move out here too. 

Then we went to the something something observatory. It was amazing, saw a great, live narrated planet-arium show with a guy whos voice was astounding. Ate dinner at Wolfgang Puck's in the observatory and came home for an early night turn-in.

But after spending time laid over in each time zone yesterday, I could really use some sleep. Goodnight!"

"event","Ev came this weekend. It was so great. Took him out to eat Friday night at Spaghetti Works. It was wonderful. Left just in time to see the tail  end of the fireworks and wander around downtown for a bit. He was pretty tired so we went home and snuggled the rest of the night and turned in kinda early.

The next morning we woke up and went to the beach. He ran the path 9 miles around the beach while I layed out but it was getting kind of cloudy so we came back and rode bikes for a little while, ate lunch and took A shower. Then we went to the mall to try and find a large hat for his big ol head. No luck. But he did get a new pair of shoes, a new tshirt (that i bought for him) and a new belt. I got iPod headphones and successfully got him to go into Victoria's Secret. Then we headed back to the hood and went to Kristin's house for ribs, potato salad, the works. Dill was hilarious. Then Kristin, her boyfriend Mike, Ev and I left to go to the ICubs game. It was great. Super high score 10  to 9 I think. It was a nail biter. Cubs won in the last play of the game and we got free loaves of bread and free tacos if we show our ticket to a taco bell? or johns or somethin. Kristin and Mike left at the top of the 9th-ish and we left after the game to wander around downtown. We went to Java Joes, heard the worst coffee house band ever while we drank our lemonde and green tea respectively. We were wandering around and who comes by but Jordan. So Jordan and Evan met and happily Evan didnt think he was that bad of a guy. We went home and cuddled and went to sleep.

The next morning we woke up to a much nicer day and spent like 3 hours at the beach. He only had to run 7 miles to finish out his 50 a week. p.s. did I mention that amazes me? We came back and chilled out a bit, played catch in my backyard. I stepped in dog poop. Then we went in for dinner, steak and corn on the cob. Lovely. he left at like 7... a little later than he'd intended. I was sad that he left, but duh he had to. I just wanna keep him all to myself you know?

It was a great weekend. I think he's awesome. Yay for him."

He's getting her a candle. 

I dunno. It's all just so cute and exciting. I've never had a boyfriend stay over for the weekend. My dad's gonna go nuts.

I'm thinking about buying a blond wig at the theatrical shop so I can fake being in my bed, creep over to the guest room and sleep with him. They won't peek in on him, just me.

Theyre playing in the Star studio. Super jealous. Oh well. I can say I almost ran into Sister Hazel carrying their guitars on the way out of the studio. That's kinda fun. I heart them. I get starstruck kinda easily, so yay for working in radio. 

This was the weekend that Ev was supposed to come visit me but he had some family friends coming in this weekend so shucks... and now he's tellin me his family is gonna be gone for the weekend up in Bettendorf right when he's sposta come down and visit me. I'm very tempted to drive up there again and have the whole house and the whole weekend all to ourselves but who knows if that's gonna bappen or not. Especially since I'd have to magically disappear if his parents suddenly came home early or something. It's just kinda risky, you know. But theres nobody there to take care of Og. So it might happen and be lovely... it might happen and be a disaster, it might not happen at all.

I can feel the power. Especially when I fuck up... as I have twice today. I was on fire last Saturday when I was being trained but I kinda suck today. Maybe it's cuz I'm journaling while I'm supposed to be watching the monitors, but whatev.
Right now Maxwell from Maxwell and Polly's morning show is out at the state historical building. It's going pretty well and I'm glad. 15 minutes left. Then I go to Glen Oaks 2-close to wait on silly rich boys... most of which probably wont even be there because they'll just be finishing up a womens tournament when I get there. Fun stuff. Looks like a good iPod day I'm thinkin.

"event","Some nights are just off, you know? I had a really off night last night. I made some bad decisons about stuff that in hindsight I shouldve decided differently. I fought w/ Evan over the phone and we discovered things about eachother that stunned us. The two of us have fundamentally different points of view and opinions on some things and it builds until suddnely Evan releases this crazy huge fight. It all came on before I had people over... at 1am. They stayed until nearly 4... and then I crashed and woke up at like 8am scared to death that I left something... anything sitting around in case my family is coming home today, except I don't even know if they are! Crazy huh? (I just found out theyre coming home tomorrow. eh.)

Another thing that this fight made me worry about is that I don't know if Evan can or will want to hang out with any of my friends when he's here. I just never realized how crazy everything has gotten to be.

This puts me, our relationship under tremendous pressure. We need to figure out how to solve a problem that to me, seems unsolvable because we're both very stubborn people that stand up for what we believe in, and that's something I like about us, that we have things that we are passionate about, its just that we cant see eye to eye on some things and when it happens its hard. 

I dont know what to do. I dont know what I'm saying or how I'm going to fix issues with a person that I love and would love to have a future with. It's just scary you know?"

...but its finally over so yay. I worked today but I have tomorrow off so I can help Mary find a job and maybe figure out what she wants for her b-day. Aside from the car my parents are getting her. (which by the way is like 10 times better than mine, not that i'm jealous or anything...)
-We went shopping w/ my mom today so Boo could find some shorts. in the meantime I found my red dress for the Red Dress Gala, our new Aphiasco party to raise $ for womens heart disease research.

Anyway. I found the hottest red dress at Cache. Slightly below knee length, scrunchy, slinky, cut like a tube dress but has these tiny lil straps that I need to shorten a lil... and I dunno, its just way hot. So yay for that.

AAAND this weekend I'm going to Evans! We're going camping and swimming and lots of fun summer stuff and i'm excited to see how hot my summer Ev is. I hope it doesnt rain tomorrow cuz I wanna lay out and get some sunlight, and get my brows waxed and stuff to make sure I'm lookin my best.

I am a bev cart girl and a kickass one at that... they shouldnt have pulled me from the course and I hate those rude lil kids but I digress. 

So I get there and my boss was like, we tried to get ahold of you but you mustve already left for work, the pool is closed today due to an emergency caulking situation. So I'm happy and I drive home, take off that nasty ass uniform and lay down on my bed, flick on the tv.

 My phone rings. It's one of my other bosses. ""Hey can you come back? Frank's having a cow and those worker people are done now... please?"" So I said ok and it sucked really bad. 

THEN I come in to work the next day, slated for the same thing, my boss is like ""Why are you here at 2? The pool doesnt even open till 3 and your cook isnt coming until then."" so they scheduled me an hour too early so I clocked in and just fucked around for an hour. What a waste of time.

THEN 2 days ago I was sposta work that god forsaken pool at 2-close. They call me at like 10pm the night before and leave me a message sayin, ""would you mind coming in at noon instead and cocktailing around the pool for a while?"" so I come in, 2 hours before I'm scheduled to go run around this pool getting drinks for these people in 90+ degree heat. I have to stay outside for over 8 hours in this heat. 

I got heat stroke. That was great. I started crashing at like 6 but had to hold on. I downed an energy drink which probably only made it worse but at least I was upright. I went home and promptly went to bed.

Yesterday was better cuz there were 2 people in the snack shack, 2 cocktail waitresses and someone grilling burgers and stuff too. I got out at 5 and now I have the day off today.... so I can go to the doctor. AGAIN. I'm really sick of this. Then again I am  sick so I guess it makes sense but I really really have no desire to take myself at all."

Not to mention I'm just not a very good worker when I can see a big line stretching out in front of me waiting to be served.

It's starting to suck more and more without Evan too. I miss him so much. 2 more weeks tho... we havent even really figured out if I'm going over there or if he's coming here. hmm. I mean, 20 minutes a day of talking to him... maybe. It's just not enough! 

I dont know what the deal is but I cant get through the Da Vinci code.

So then I went to meetings and they were pretty interesting/boring at the same time. The new pilots are pretty cool. In the afternoon I went to the pool, chilled out and got some rays w/ my buds iPod and Ketel One & lemonade.

Stayed out way too late with Prince Charming (aka my buddy Justin from high school) he works at Disney World as a character. My friend Libby works down there too I found out and after dinner w/ him and his mom we went over to the Disney kid housing complex and hung out w/ her for a bit then went to the bar. I got drunk, got back to the hotel at like 1am and woke up for my 6:30am wakeup call. UGH

Went to meetings till like 2:30  and checked out, flew back and our luggage is missing. Fun stuff. Got home and my sister was like 'has your fish's nose always been so red? she keeps running into things' I find out Tic Tac is blind, hungry and running into crap. I felt so bad and woke up this morning expecting her to be dead and now she's suddenly fine... except for her bloody lil nose. Poor thing.

Work is getting sucky again. The new boss Jason is such an ass. If I have to stay more than an hour after my scheduled time off one more time I'm totally complaining to the GM. I don't care if it's on the schedule but if it's not I'm not staying that long. I clock out when it's time for me to clock out. I got shit to do people. 
They scheduled me for 2 days that I cant get covered this weekend.. They  have me working during tryouts. No effin way. I called everyone and I have a scholarship riding on it so if they fire me I'm gonna be real pissed.

K gotta shower before I go home for dinner. Been working since 7 and I'm gross. bye"

"event","Craziness everywhere is what Relays is up at Drake. 
I haven't been sober for a straight 24 hour period since last Monday.
And now I am sick... hmm wonder why. Bad cold is all but my computer's hard drive crashed so I'm at home right now working on a report about prostitution in China.. rather, thats what I should be doing. 

Drinking olympics kicked my ass this year. I hate chugging beer, I just buy the t-shirt and go for the good times. Monday was case race, Tuesday was drink 2 beers at each bar, 2 at West End, run to Pegs, 2 there and run to Library to finish your last 2. I was a finish line cheerleader. Wednesday was a quarters tourney in Library which I did pretty well at if I do say so myself. Thursday was a flippy cup tourney, which I dominated. Friday was Kill-A-Keg and that was easy cuz we had lots of Phi's. 
I saw a guy's dick when his buddy ripped his skin tight tiny lil spandex shorts. It was gross. At the end of Kill-A-Keg these 2 guys were having a projectile vomiting contest. Gross. 

2 of Evan's buddies from high school came down from Iowa for a night so we took them to the SAE party cuz they didnt have id's and it was free beer so why not. They had fun. I think we showed them a pretty good time. They went to the relays the next afternoon and went back to Iowa.

Deanna made an attempt to haze me last night. She was drunk and wanted me to streak either in the Quad or down greek street. I'm sorry but no effin way was I gonna run past like 1000 people on greek street with cops every half block or through the Quad with cop security guards at every doorway. Not to mention the intense cold I have mixed with the pouring rain outside. Thank God there were people in the living room when she dragged me through the house. Karla came to my rescue by getting Deanna off of me long enough for me to lock myself in my room and wait.. and cough, and sniffle, and sneeze, until this afternoon.

All things considered it was a pretty good weekend. After I dropped off my computer today I went with Evan to Wal-Mart where we hungrily shopped for groceries.. and then he took me out to dinner at Mustards. What a guy.

Okay. Time to continue this whole Chinese prostitute thing. Lets hope I dont pass out before I get this done and back to Drake. Bah"

"event","So as fun as that weekend was I have so much homework to do... so instead I'm journaling. Smart huh. 

Fiji Island was okay. There were tons of people there and it was kind of hard to get beer. Luckily there were still a couple of Mikes hard lemonades in my bag that Andrea forgot about after formal. So I went over there for a little and Evan showed up a little while later. We saw a crazy fight between some huge 300 pound guy and Charlie... somethin, I cant remember his last name. Anyway there was this big ol makeshift waterfall made out of hoses, kiddy pools and scafolding. Anyway somehow the giant 300 pound guy got pissed off so they pushed him in the waterfall and he made a huge splash and all the sand around the fountain got wet so it was really gross to walk through. Then out of nowhere he gets out of the fountain soaking wet and seriously pissed off. He comes running at some guys that Evan and I were standing directly behind.. we almost ran into the volcano trying to get away from them. Then Charlie took his shirt off and was trying to pick a fight with the huge guy. He'd totally lose, the guy would just sit on him and he'd be done.

Anyway woke up this morning for some hangover Hub nasty. I've been attempting to try to do homework this whole afternoon. So far the last 2 hours havent gone too well and then whenever I go to dinner it always takes forever so I'm probably screwed. Whatever. I need to clean my room. B-Weiss is coming over like right now to do her laundry."

Busted out my 20 dollar maroon and gold dress, my big ol gold earrings and my new gold Steve Maddens and drank and danced the night away with my lovely boyfriend at the Embassy Club, drinkin champagne and singin the dirty songs at the top of my lungs on the bus ride home.

Woke up in the morning, watched the parade and went to street painting. I got COVERED. I wore the same street painting jeans from last year and now theyre super cool... like so shitty and painty they look designer. Afterwards I showered for an hour trying to get all the paint off me, especially the red that was caked in my hair. My blonde hair is stained kind of pink in some spots. It looks really hot.... uhh

Evan is running up at Iowa today.. some 3k or 5k or somethin. He's getting back prolly about the time I'll be stumbling out of Fiji crush. Fun stuff. Drinkin olympics is this week. Fun times at Drake. I heart relays."

"event","The year is almost over. It just really hit me in the last few days. Freshman year it crept up on me because I was too busy to notice... this year I'm busy and noticing. 

Wedding exchange was a blast. I was tinkerbell and my date, Emmanuel was Peter Pan. If you can see my facebook you should look at the pictures... our costumes were perfect and I love Emmanuel's accent. I got buzzed and started attempting to talk to him in French but it was so bad that I gave up. His English is wonderful though and his accent is so cool. No wonder Jenna's dating him.

Bev. cart has started up at Glen Oaks. It's gonna be a good summer. I can tell the golfers know that I have experience and I can make a good drink and it's so nice to spend an entire afternoon outside in fresh air with beautiful scenery. I  hardly consider it work! We had the giant clusterfuck Easter Brunch on Sunday and hopefully that'll be my last waitressing experience for at least another few months.

My mom brought me this huge basket full of easter stuff along with enough Frappuccino and Propel to last me the rest of  the year, socks and groceries too. She's the best. No bunny rolls though. Grandma made them this year and apparently they were burned. My family went to Davenport w/o me cuz I had to work. Evan got me a little stuffed ducky and a big bag of Easter peanut M&M's. He's awesome. I love him. 

Went to the doc again yesterday and it turns out everythings all good now so no worries. Big celebration last night. I was so happy I cried. 

JA is starting this week. Deanna and Lora stole all of Gina's illegal substances out of our room and she can't get it back until the week is over. Her boyfriend isn't allowed to stay over this week either which means I finally get a good nights sleep for once and I wont fall in the toilet when I wake up in the morning. They tell me I'm going to be hazed too sometime this week but I have no idea where or when. I'm just praying I don't have to streak again. They said they were toying around with the idea of making me eat an entire sheet cake but I doubt they'd do that. I wouldn't put it past them but I know they've got something even more evil up their sleeve. They tell me theyre doing this cuz they love me but I guess I'll only really understand it when I'm on the other side.

I may be going skydiving soon. It's really expensive though so I need to get a lil more money. It's up in some town that starts with a D or maybe a W but Evan and his friend Joe are going and since it's on my list of shit to do... why not?
 
Spring formal is Friday, Yippee! It's at the Embassy Club, 801 Grand.. top floor. Love that place. I'd better have lots of fun cuz I doubt the Phi's will be allowed to have a party there for quite some time after this bash. It's gonna be nuts. I'm wearing a dress that I'm a little afraid of because I've never worn anything like it  before. I bought it for 20 bucks at Rampage after Wedding Exchange when I was a lil drunk still. 

P.S. Go see Thank You For Smoking. Good movie. Made me really want a cigarette afterwards tho."

"event","Went to Evan's track meet up at UNI yesterday. Hung out w/ his mom and his little brother, went to Subway w/ them and just sorta bonded and it was nice. His mom is so great and we have lots in common. Adam is just hilarious and he was telling me pickup lines I should use on Evan. It was really funny.

So I get back from goin out to the bars w/ Evan last night thinking we could just crawl into bed and go to sleep. Guess it wasnt that easy. Gina and her boyfriend come in and want to watch a movie so we decide to go sleep on the futon. A few minutes after we go to the futon Lora comes in absolutely shitfaced. She turns on the light and wakes us up and gets pissed off that she can't pass out there and then she was pissed that Deanna was already asleep. She then proceeds to tear up the bathroom and leave the shower running.

I wake up like 3.5 hours after I fell asleep thinking it was raining but no, it was just the stupid shower. I look in the bathtub to see the shampoo bottles and everthing all over the tub, the shelf knocked over and a drawer overturned onto the floor. I'm leaving it like that. Took Evan back to the dorms and drove Gina to our philanthropy at 7:45 in the morning. I am exhausted. Brett N from Phi Delt won. I was amazed. He runs like a girl and I've always thought so but apparently that's fast.

I come back to find that Deanna has torn all the sheets off the futon with the expectation that I need to wash them. Bitch. I'm just gonna fold them and give them back to her in a week. She wont even notice.

My parents are coming very soon for brunch and my drunkass senior roommates are lying around in this messy suite. Gina is with her boyfriend in our bedroom and I have nowhere to lay down. I am so tired and I just want to sleep somewhere. It's been a long few days."

"event","So I have to register tomorrow and my advisor asked me if I had any idea what I wanted my concentration to be. I've taken a whole bunch of soc courses so I thought that since I've taken a few I should see how much more I need for a minor. So I went over to Howard to see if there were certain classes I should sign up for....

Turns out I'm one class away from having a sociology minor... who woulda thought? So I declaired my minor today, just 3 short credits away.

My mom e-mailed me today and turns out that on our trip to Orlando we're going to Cirque De Soleil before the IPTV pilot convention. I'm way excited. My mom and I have always wanted to see this show because we both used to be... pretty decent dancers so it's just hypnotic to see a show like this.

So Grant and I were doing our show yesterday afternoon when House called, she's the one that took my job and she was like 'just seeing if you guys wanted to do it' Grant and I agreed that we'd only do it if they set up for us and if our show was only the hour long that we were originally scheduled for... so we'll see how this goes.

Heard an interesting quote today-
We tend to see in others what we don't like about ourselves.
Just roll that around in your heads a little bit."

"event","So CJ's getting his first tattoo today. That's exciting. He wanted me to go with him but Evan kindly reminded me that I had class during his appointment. Oops. He's getting some latin phrase across the top of his back. Said he found it on his family crest. Lets hope he's thought this through, he's kind of a snot about his crest so I guess it fits. 

KDCS is still annoying as shit. So I got fired in like December as assistant program director and they hired House which was fine... I was fired because I couldnt find volunteers to do any of the remotes. I dont talk to them anymore, I have my own show and my own stuff now with Grant. House is now having the exact same problem but instead of telling the station it wasnt gonna happen she's FORCING people to do these stupid remotes that earns us maybe like 50 bucks... none of which the talent ever sees. So she says that Grant and I are doing the relays carnival because its during our timeslot.
I'm pissed about it and I'm going to do everything in my power to go against them.
It'd be one thing if they set up for us and stuff but theres no way I'm lugging all that heavy equipment after my cheerleading workout, let alone the lack of time between that and the start of the show, stand there for an hour and talk, and pack it all up and lug all that shit back.
I'm talking to Evans. To be continued with that shit.

On the upside, one of my coworkers from Glen Oaks, Francisco, is an independent film director and had his stuff featured in the Wild Rose film festival that I did a J100 story on and he's doing some casting for his next thing. I told him I'm an okay actor but I'm really bad at memorizing lines. I've basically fried my short term memory so being an extra would be great! haha we'll see. Modeling in a Planned Parenthood ad, doing runway for Vanity, independent film? Why not?

Whatever. Time to go work out. Yay for endorphins."

I rocked my midterms.

Evan made a monumental step in commitment and even though the recent events have happened, it pretty much just brought us closer together.

Another monumental step... we have fish. Brittany, Lisa, Greg, Evan and I went to WalMart and we got new fish for Evan's tank. We each have one. Evan's fish is green on top and orange on the bottom and its name is Spot cuz it has a black spot on the tail. Brittany's is Nanner and its kind of skinnny and big eyes and annoying to all the other fish. Lisa's is Pepper and its white with little black spots all over it, Greg's doesnt have a name yet but its kind of the loner fish, greyish, And mine is orange with a little white and its name is Tic Tac. Should Evan and I break up I intend to grant him sole custody of Tic Tac because I don't have a tank.

So yes. Sarah is happy."

"event","So my birthday was on Thurs. and it was crazy. At first I was pissed because I had to go to St Louis and cheer in the mens b-ball tourney and i couldnt spend it with my pledge kid whos birthday was Thurs too.

Kyle, one of my band buddies made a buncha alcoholic beverages for us to share on the bus and i was buzzin when we got there... just in time for me to sober up and cheer... so we did and the dogs lost which was fabulous so i could hang out with Evan.

Then Sarah got shitfaced. I taught the band kids how to play p and a... and the marketing director took me down to the lobby bar and bought me a drink... next think i know i'm passed out face down in the middle of the 3rd floor hallway of our hotel alone. someone found me and took me back to their room and I puked black. I was wearing a white jacket and now theres greyish-black puke all over it. 

I woke up at 9:30 still wasted... decided to stand in the shower to try to sober up. i packed everything up and shuffled to the bus. went to the cafe and nobody would serve me food which i desperately needed... i passed out on the bus.

We stopped at burger king for lunch. i managed to choke down like 5 fries. Then my mom called. Oh goodness. So I talked to her and told her how hung over I was.. i get on the bus and everyones singing happy birthday to me. and I pass out again. 

I got home and puked again at 10:30 at night. Longest hangover EVER. and now i'm fine! hehe"

"event","Okay, so most of the time I feel like I'm a decent, cheerful person always eager to help others with their day to day lives, especially my close friends. Recently though I feel like people are taking advantage of my kindness. Goodness knows there'd be no way Gina could get to half her probation and doctors appointments without me driving her, Trowbridge couldn't go tanning all the way out in Johnston without me, and I don't even wanna get started with CJ. 

I mean, most of these things I see as a simple investment in my friendships but now I'm coming to realize that when I need a favor I don't get much help from them, they're too concerned with themselves. I asked Alissa about an assignment, ""read your syllabus"". I've had to save 2 seats every single week for her and Laurel while they saunter in and get pissed at where their desks are, take my arm rests and etc.. just little shit but it's starting to build up and I'm getting a lil pissed about it. 

I honestly wonder how many hours of the day I spend helping my friends asking for (and getting) nothing in return. Like, I wonder what would happen if I just stopped doing stuff for them for a week. I'm pretty sure they'd notice. Bitchy point of view? Yeah, but I feel like there are way more takers than givers in this world and its very sad."

I went to bed at 7pm, woke up w/ a call from Evan at 10:30 and as soon as I opened my eyes the pain screamed. After the phone call I got up to take some asprin and dropped my medicine all over the desk and hit my computer etc. the sound of it brought tears to my eyes.. I grabbed the asprin... took 4 and layed down. Deanna put a cold washcloth on my forehead which got warm in about 2 minutes because of a raging fever.. half an hour later I was still awake. She gave me a vicodin and I was gone.

Its threatening to come back right now... it cant. I have a basketball game tonight and a radio show before that. It cant come back. Lets hope this works. I'm gonna go eat some food."

Olmsted cheeseburgers will make you feel ill. Don't eat them. 

7:30am cheer workouts will also make you feel ill. Don't be a cheerleader unless youre being bribed by free books.

Evan and I sort of got in a fight last night. I was afraid he was trying to change me. I'm still afraid he's trying to change me. All the things he's trying to change are things that aren't 'good' qualities about me but I still would rather do it with my own free will. Quitting smoking is extra hard when you relapse and instead of getting support you are refused kisses. I'm paying to do hypnotherapy. I'm actually spending money to quit a habit he doesn't want me to have anymore... and if I was smart I wouldnt want it anymore either... that's the thing. If it was something I didn't want to stop then I'd put up a fight... I just need a lot of help with this one.

My family still doesn't know about the new piercing. I think I'm gonna try to switch the stud one more time to a really small one before I go home again, I just don't want to have to resort to a safety pin to accomplish that though. I havent been home in like 3 weeks. I'm kind of glad. They were getting a little too close for comfort. At least I had valid excuses, as if that really matters in the long run. I just really miss my dog.

I'm sure I'll write again... maybe tomorrow after the big v-day date. Ev's taking me out to Cosi Cucina (sp?) I just hope his present gets here... eep."

"event","So on Saturday I got my tragus pierced. Most painful thing ever... I went to Expo w/ Brittany, Lisa, Evan, and Gina cuz Brit wanted her ears single pierced and Gina wanted hers double pierced. Evan and Lisa came for moral support. The innitial piercing didn't hurt that bad at all but the stud he used was really huge and bling and I didn't like it. Plus I had to cheer at a game that night. So I went back to the dorms and attempted to switch it out really fast... I got the earring out, blood started gushing everywhere and in the .5 seconds I had the stud out it closed. 

This pissed me off. I wasnt about to lose 40 bucks on a piercing I pulled out. Evan got me a safety pin. I re-pierced it myself. I have a pic of the safety pin through my ear.. (look at my facebook, its in there) a paperclip to hold it away from my skin so I could pierce it at the right angle. Then I pulled out the safety pin and put in the right earring. It hurt like a biatch. Still kinda does. Hmm.

My mom sent me an e-mail this morning telling me to change the contents of my myspace page. This pissed me off. My parents have turned into serious spies ever since I went to school. My dad calls me THE SAME DAY I make expensive charges on my debit card, I am interrogated about the existence of lighters in my car, my myspace account is scoured for controvercial information about me when my own boss has seen and does not give a shit about what's on my page. It's starting to get rediculous. I am 19, no longer under their control.. if I werent financially dependant still I wouldnt care one bit about their opinions on new piercings, debit card transactions, or web pages.

I was on my way up to Drake the night before I moved back to visit Alissa and stuff. I pull off the road, get out of my car and go to get back in and bam, keys locked in car. I walked to the nearest Casey's and there was this geeky guy that went to my high school was working and I used his cell phone and a phone book. Called a locksmith and he told me it'd be like  45 minutes so I gave him my home phone number and went home and waited for him to call... praying my parents wouldnt get back from their dinner thing before I'd left again. Not 5 minutes later they pulled in the driveway and discovered I was there, but my car wasnt. My mom had a spare key and dropped me off to get my car. So yeah. Big idiot move.

Moved into the Phi house again for 2nd semester. That took a surprisingly short time but all my other roommates have been in the process of moving out for like the last 2 days and it's starting to get to me. So much so that I even helped Deanna move some of her shit this afternoon cuz she has like 4 times as much crap as I do. 

Went to West End last night. It was packed as usual. Me and Evan went w/ some of my friends. Evan got drunk and it was great cuz he was all lovey. We had a sleepover in my  new room cuz Gina wasnt moved in yet.

"event","So I just got back from Aspen. Theta Chi ski trip was honestly one of the best vacations I've been on in my entire life. I loved spending some quality time on the slopes with my best friends. Tearin it up with Taz and Jesus and Micah and Christi and Gunther and Tim and etc etc etc. So much fun. 

Day 1
I took Mary and Alex to Snowmass to teach Mary how to ski. She fell down once every 5 seconds and got really frustrated but she stuck with it, Alex discovered she still couldnt snowboard cuz of her stress fracture. 

Day 2 
After partying last night I woke up with a terrible headache. Discovered it wasnt just a hangover but it was altitude sickness. I went to the far side of Snowmass and by noon/1 discovered I needed to do just a half day. Spent some time in the hottub etc etc and felt tons better. Mary skiied Buttermilk and skiied her lil heart out. Made me feel good. Went to a kickass sushi bar down in town w/ Josh and Taz... Actually held it down this time! Afterwards we watched the Rose Bowl and had a huge party in our room. Got security called on us, thank goodness they didn't search the place cuz we'd have been screwed.

Day 3
Went to Aspen Ajax with the good skiiers, Christi, Tim, Jason, Gunther and Natalie. Natalie skiied one run and wimped out but she did win 'best wipeout'... the rest of us spent all day exploring the mountain.... hotboxing the express gondola from the bottom to the summit... you know. Got back, found out Mary had bruised the bones in her foot and ankle after taking a huge spill at Buttermilk. she was out of commission for the rest of the trip so her and Alex were boot buddies. I felt fantastic after a dip in the jacuzzi, Then went to the free private Nappy Roots concert for people there with Lifestylez but I was so tired I could hardly pay attention. ""Aw naw, hell naw boy, ya'll done up and done it""

Day 4
Snowmass once more. Hangover free, but also without Evan. We were gonna meet up and ski our last days together but his friends vetoed that awfully quick. In the morning Gunther, Micah, Natalie, Remis, Micah and I went to the summit for the 'long way down'. Take a lift to the top and then take a hiking path through powder. It was said to be a ""short, but strenuous hike"" to the top. They werent kidding. The air was so thin I was breathing my hardest to get just a little oxygen to keep moving. It was worth it. The view from the top was GORGEOUS. I have fun pics. The ride down was awesome. Completely ungroomed, mogul, jumping, tearing wonderfulness. Funny pictures of people eating it off jumps. Group pic at 2, best pizza of my life, back to skiing my lil heart out and done.

Ride home was hilarious. Mary decided we do a deep dark secret session where we all answered really personal questions. That SUV was our little Las Vegas. What happens in the SUV stays in the SUV. We got lost, went to a weird fast food resturaunt etc etc. Got home at 2am this morning. I'm beat. Sleeping more now. Night."

I got there last night at like 5, hung out, went to old Chicago w/ Evan and his buddies, shared a pizza w/ him etc. We came home and wandered around downtown Davenport, walked on the skybridge and drove around. We dropped off his friend and went to his brother's house so I could meet his girlfriend and Evan's little niece, she's ADORABLE, Kayleigh May. Aww. 

I learned how to play spades and Evan and I kicked some major boo tay at that. I learned how to make a cowboy hat out of beer boxes and Evan and I have some really funny pictures from the night.

Best new years kiss ever. His brother's kitchen, the ball dropped, people kissed, nobody was staring at us, it was completely wonderful... just chillin in Brendan's kitchen. 

We went home soon after midnight and his mom (by the way, cutest lady ever) made up an air mattress for me in their basement. Evan wanted to be able to fall asleep with me and was really sad about it so we put in The Notebook (which he got for me as just a lil random present.. such a cutie) and we watched part of it, he went upstairs so his dad would go to sleep and then he came back down for some more super quality time. We slept for 3 hours, got up and got on the road.

He was going to meet his buddies in Des Moines so I'd have someone to ride back with. I dropped him off in Altoona and he transferred his stuff to their car and they're on the road right now for Vail. I already miss him.

I'm getting on the road for Aspen and Snowmass tonight at 9, so much to do before then. I'm so tired. There's no way I'll be able to stay up all night on the road! I hope I get to drive first! Ohh I'm so excited and happy and on top of the world!"

Apparently I dont know the rules of the whole wedding guest request thingy or whatever because apparently when you go with someone to a wedding, thats a date. Even though I told him I wasnt kissing him at midnight cuz of Evan.. he still didnt get it until he asked about mine and Evans status and I explained all this business about how he doesnt wanna ask me on the phone and he's waiting until Colorado. I dont want to go on a date with CJ, I have Evan and he is wonderful and genuine and uncomplicated. CJ said that if Evan and I were pretty much dating, which we are, that he felt uncomfortable taking me as his date. I now have no plans for new years and not much hope for fun. Why cant things just go back to being normal between he and I? If there ever really was a normal to begin with. 

Evan and I have discovered that our ski resorts are an hour and 45 minutes apart. This isnt stopping him from trying to convince his buddies to come to Aspen for at least a day to ski with me. Lets hope this works. I'm starting to sound like a broken record but I really miss him. Everyone gets to spend new years kissing the ones they love but me? Nah, we'll even be in different time zones! He went running this morning and came back really sick, I'm starting to worry about him. He just cant shake this cold! It's been weeks! His mom says if he's not starting to look better in the next couple days after he goes to the doctor she might have to pull the whole plug on the skiing thing... which would mean instead of only being 1:45 away from him it'd be... well way more hours than that. The worst part is my maternal instinct is kicking in when I can hear him coughing and moaning on the phone and I cant just waltz over there w/ chicken noodle soup and take care of him. Poor guy."

I was at the Apple store the other day cuz I dropped my laptop from my lofted bed back when I was up at school and it cracked my monitor. My iPod also wasnt keeping a charge when it turned off so I went with my mom and brought both of them up there. We waited for a few minutes till the 'genius bar' opened up and we showed him my cracked computer screen. 
He wrote down an estimate for parts and service on a little piece of paper and I could feel heat rise up into my face and my eyes start to water... why? No real reason, I'm just a very moody person. I got soo 'fuhklemped' the guy asked me if I needed a minute and my mom made some comment about my now bright red face which of course only made it worse. 
We went on to the iPod, he clicked around on his little computer thingy and my mom and I sat there and talked for like 5 minutes. It was discovered that my iPod was out of warranty but he looked right into my eyes and said that since he felt so bad about my computer he'd go ahead and switch them out for free and to not tell anyone and Merry Christmas. With that my face got all red again. I thanked him and left the store. Nice guy. 

Okay now for the boy troubles. This is gonna be one massive journal entry. 
So last night I hang out with CJ and he tries to make a play for me again. He tells me he wants to get back together and he invites me to this wedding on new years eve. I told him I'd love to go but he's not getting a kiss at midnight. 
He asks me why and I tell him about Evan, he already kinda knew but i sorta reiterated it. I asked him if he still wanted to take me and he said yes, later on i'm dropping him off at this house up at Drake he's staying at for a few days, he's just like 'think about it okay?' and I come home, Evan calls me and I spill all this out to him but I can feel more chemistry over the freaking phone with Evan than I did in the hug goodbye with CJ. 
This situation makes me worry... cuz if Evan wasnt around i'd totally want to date CJ again but I feel like I'd never forgive myself if I didn't try to pursue Evan, because we feel so close to eachother so soon. I mean, I told him about the party and everything that was going on and he said somethin like 'I just wish I could be there with you, and i'm glad you told me about the party cuz from my point of view it might have looked a little weird' but I told him I'm not going to kiss CJ at midnight and I intend to stick by that. 
My fidelity to Evan is already being tested, which scares us both. But I want to be a strong psudo girlfriend. Because he told me he's going to ask me when he sees me again cuz he doesn't want to over the phone. This makes me pretty happy. I just hope I can be Evans epitome of girlfriend. Bah
And, I forgot to mention this.. but I've been having weird dreams with CJ in them, one he was throwing up blood, one he told me to look in his eyes and tell me  I dont love him anymore... I never told him I loved him, but he drunkenly, and mistakenly told me once. I dunno... roll that one around in your head too. You will soon have a giant headache.

7 count them, 7 course meal. Since I'm new I was stuck in the kitchen as a food runner, serving the food to the servers who in turn served it to the guests. Rediculous. One of the managers was rediculously uptight and was stressing me out too. It didnt need to be so crazy but it was. That's what happens with parties of 70 I guess. 

That night I went home exhausted. Talked to Evan for an hour and a half, yawning every 30 seconds. Fell asleep and had nightmares about waitressing. 

Woke up and went to work again. Got scheduled for more shifts but just discovered that I cant work on T/uesday night because apparently that's the Blenders concert (big tradition between kristins family and mine) So I'm going to have to take it off... even though I wasnt sposta work then anyway until this afternoon. A waiter walked out 2 days ago and got fired. I gotta call Mary Beth asap when I get up. 

Aaaand I'm super tired. Just ate TONS of food courtesy of good ol mom. Talkin to Evan, and wanting a nap before I go out... hopefully w/ Josh cuz I havent seen him in a while and I would like to use my gift this evening to send myself into the perfect coma. 

I miss Evan. I talk to him once or twice a day but I still cant get enough. He changed his facebook relationship status from single to... nothing. Which is possibly a good thing, I think.

My mom was CRACKING UP when I told her about him. As a lotta people know my mom and I are clones only I'm just 30 years younger basically. So she met my dad on a blind date..  I met Evan on a blind date. My dad was really tiny with shaggy dark hair in college. Evan is really tiny with shaggy dark hair. My dad was a business major, Evan's a finance major.

I drove sober cab tonight w/ Trow. Brit and Evan came and watched Almost Famous with us in the living room cuz there was nobody out. Now its getting late and I wish he was sleeping here. Just because I want to cuddle with him and make him stop coughing and feeling sick anymore. Maybe I can see him tomorrow too. I just dont wanna stop.

But I'm gonna stop now... cuz I'd like to sleep. He's not on anyway cuz his computer has a virus..
man. I need to stop. Goodnight. Sorry. Good night"

"event","So last night was Evan's birthday. Me him and Brit went to W.E. for drinks, but all of us had to get up early and Ev was sick so we didn't drink that much. Got a lotta free drinks tho. I kissed him once... thought he didnt like me, went online and told Brit I thought he didn't like me to which she basically said 'oh yes he does..' Haven't heard from him since... I wanna go on a real date with him sometime. It'd be awesome.

I'm way stressed out in my classes. Music theory final tomorrow... left my script in Meredith tonight so I gotta go in at like 8:30 am again. geezo. I'm stressin.

If it werent for my fun new gift I'd really be dragging my feet."

"event","So yeah. Interesting weekend. Chillin w/ CJ thurs night, going very randomly to Loco Joes w/ Josh on Friday, aah woke up and served my community at 8am... then it was formal. So much fun was had by all.

Evan, my blind date was really really awesome. We danced a lot and drank a lot even tho he was on antibiotics. (he told Brittany later that he was stunned by how much I could drink... he don't know me very well do he?) But as much fun as we had yesterday now he's sick, and his birthday is tomorrow! Sad. 

A few hours before I woke up I heard Mom Lo knock on our bedroom door and ask Deanna if she was still okay, she said ya and we fell back asleep. I woke up this morning and went to take a shower before the b-ball game. I go to turn on the water and our bathtub has puke all in it. It looked like it had been there like all night cuz i tried to run the water and it didnt go anywhere... so I showered across the hall. We're pretty sure it was Deanna but she's sayin she has no idea... curious. 

After chapter tonight I went back over to Josh's and got the best present I've recieved in like a long time. It fits in my pocket, its green gold and black. I dunno whether to name it Devito or India, maybe both. This is gonna be the best winter ever."

"event","Things are finally looking up for me!

I have a date for formal, his name is Evan Wood and it's a blind date (well not really due to the wonders of facebook) but I need to meet someone new. I'm excited about it. He's cute. 

""Hung out"" with CJ last night after the game. We went driving and he slept over here again. Still trying to figure out what's goin on w/ that whole thing.

Gonna hang out w/ Josh tonight, he's always good for that random leg touch that sends electricity up you. 

Work is getting better, training was short tonight.
Community service tomorrow morning 8am-1pm. If you get the chance turn on IPTV. I'll be there, hung over in all my glory answering phones w/ a few of my sorority sisters.

Getting CJ his ID tomorrow afternoon before going tanning w/ Trowbridge, then its formal!!! I'm gonna get wasted.. but not too wasted, I have a basketball game the next day (psh, who am I kidding, I've stunted drunk before)

I need to go buy cigarettes and chill w/ my Joshie. Au revoir people!"

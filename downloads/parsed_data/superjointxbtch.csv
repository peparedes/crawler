imagine being taken away from your mother who is your closest fucking friend and has taken care of you all your fucking life and put into a home with your dad that doesnt give a flying fuck about you and only wants you living with him beacause he gets money out of your mom....imagine having a fucking dad like mine...he sits around watching tv all day, doesnt give a fuck about me, and he'll fucking buy himself a brand new fucking harley but he wont fucking buy you clothes..imagine your fucking dad promising you all this shit like a new 4 wheeler, a new dirtbike, a dog, n everything you ever fucking wanted just to get you to say that you want to live with him so he can continue getting fucking money out of your fucking mom...o shit n thats not fucking all, theres a shitload more....this nightmare has just fucking begun....

so you want my life story? well here it fucking is...

i used to live a happy life filled with love, except for the fact that my ex stepdad ocasionally beat the living fuck out of your mom (pretty much...) ok...and this is the ""happy"" life i lived...so then our cunt rag of a landlord fucking kicked us out of our fucking home...so then i had to live with my ex stepdad in westford while my mom was in dracut with her mom....i had to go to westford because the house my mom was in was too crowded....soo i was still going to school in tyngsboro, until my dickheaded principal kicked me out because i fucking lived 20 fucking minutes away in the next fucking town over! DICK! so my mom came into the school that day he decided i couldnt continue the school year there and scares the shit outta him...she yelled at him...for..pssh i dont remember...soo i started school in westford...my first time going to a new school...i was scared shitless....the day before i cried and fucking cried all fucking night and i couldnt sleep...the next morning i took the school bus with stasia, the only person i knew in westford and she was my nextdoor neighbor...soo....of course...everyone fucking stared at me like they didnt fucking want me there...which made my whole fucking situation that much fucking worse....soo then...you see i started the fourth grade year there....and then summer came....ahh...yeah...soo then the fifth grade school year began, and i was only there for about....3 days or so when i found out my dad got custody of me...the guidance person at the school came to get me at lunch
and told me my dad was here....at taht moment i didnt know why, until i fucking walked into the hallway where my dad was and i asked why he was there and he said 'your coming to live with me now' so i fucking broke into tears and i was carried into my dads car and taken to gtown...soo then the school year THERE begins...god damn i was sick of this new kid bullshit...soo again...everyone stared and....god....i wanted to fucking kill everyone....soo skipping 5th n 6th grade, n moving on to 7th....where do  i fucking start? my friend fucking turns her back on me, this kid i like fucking hates me, iv had so many rumors spread about me by my so called friend, hannah....n soo much more shit...

and it doesnt end there...i still have the rest of my fucking life to live.....IF i havent already commited suicide..."

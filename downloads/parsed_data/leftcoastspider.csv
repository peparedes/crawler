"event","Well today wasn't the BEST day in the world...but oh well...cuz the rest of my week made up for it! Thursday was all oobertastic...you know whats fun wondering around Tacoma goin from starbucks to starbucks...yea that was my day and i ended up at the Narrows goin to the movie with my friend Billy and that one dude? haha we saw THE INCREDIBLES which was well the title says it all. heh but it was funny just try not to sit in the front row on this one cuz youh ave to read from one corner of the screen to the other...kinda just a tintsy difficult...but overall i was in an awsome mood the next day even though on wednsday i broke my violin by sitting on it.  So then Saturday everyone kept tryin to make my plans...garsh...i ended up goin with Megan and Adrian the two greatest people ALIVE...well besides moi and jimi hendrix doesn't count but if he was alive id knock adrian off the list cuz jimi is a better guitar player hahaha.
   BUT ANYWAYS we all wondered around BOrders books and me and megan threw some money together and bought some awsome books.  We had just both read ""THe Perks of being A Wallflower"" which is by far the best book i have read so farrrr....everyone should read it.  IT doesnt come in chapters, the book is a series of letters from this kid named Charlie..well actually he doesnt want you to find out who he is so he uses diffrent names...well anyway by the end of the book you feel like he is writing to you personaly...
  SO yes we ended up buying books recomended in the back of that book such as
-Bongwater...a book about the grunge scene sorta 
-Don't sleep with your drummer..which perfectly describes me and megans life haha
-and an F.Scott Fitzgerald book cuz we all loved The Great Gatsby and this book was mentiond inside ""The Perks of being a wallflower""
   So yea then we wondered over to Starbucks mmmm good stuff then over to wendys where we had fries and i embarassed them by freakin out about my hanus brainfreeze and yellin at them to wash their hands when every they would go towards the bathroom...but they got me back when i went to the bathroom the moment i sat down  my phone just rang sooo loud it echoed in their it twas funny..and of course i waved at everyone commin out the drive through.
   well today i just woke up and showered and just did homework oh jOY but in a little bit im goin to KORN yes yes i know they arent that cool i guess but its their greatest hits tour and so they better play Freak ON A Leash and ADDIDAS haha the best songs ever sorta not really
all right peoples lattasss"

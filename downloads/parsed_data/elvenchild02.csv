I've been ridiculously busy as of late. and I mean <i>ridiculously</i> busy. I have way, way too many things going on. 

I have some trepidation about going to real school in the fall. it seemed so far away when I decided that yes, I would do it. Now it's all too close... =\


also, my mother made some  <a href=""http://www.thealmightyguru.com/Boffer/index.html"">boffers</a>... they are a lot of fun. It's much healthier than just arguing... ^^ 

The comic is going well. I have all the pages up to page 90 on the computer and ready to go. I've scripted to very near the end of chapter 5 (around page 104 or so)... I'm trying out a new format, sort of. This just means the pages will be a bit longer from now on. I can't make them wider than 650 pixel without screwing up the layout of the site, but making them longer gives me much more freedom. I like the effect, personally. ^^

we've been going to the beach almost every day since the heat wave began. usually just before or a bit after dinnertime, when it starts cooling down. The water is lovely warm coming off the salt marsh as the tide turns! and now I think I'll go there again, as it's getting late. =) bye-ya!

Anyways, it's almost my 15th birthday. I'm really not all that excited about it, except that it means <b>LESS</b> of this whole teenagehood nonsense. And it <i>is</i> nonsense, I was at the local mall, after the movie, and ye gods! It was so, so, so, <i>American</i>! *sigh* So, long story short, the faster all this teenage/highschool/typicalness goes, the better. Being a teenager makes adults talk down to you and I sincerely loathe that. *another sigh*

I've been doing a lot with watercolors as of late. Also, brush and ink. Both of those are pretty new to me, and very enjoyable. 

I'm really to tired to write properly right now. I need to get more sleep... 

comic is going well. I did portraits of all the chars. ^^

Today I had one of those moments where you are just doing whatever, something normal, like riding in the car, and you just break into a smile and realize that you are happy. I love that. ^^ It's happened twice in the last two weeks, which must be a personal record. I never used to have happy moments when I went to my old school. I had blah moments, when I realized that I hadn't been truely, deeply happy in over six months. or, since summertime. *sigh* 

But I'm happy now! I'm taking a figure drawing class at RISD, which is going super-well. Naked ladies aren't so embarrassing after all. This week we'll get a naked guy. Took 'em long enough. Male anatomy is what I really need work on. I mean, really. If I need a female model, I have mirrors! But a male model? What, do I ask my dad to strip? that'd go over realllllll well. heh. yeah. (""my eyes! it burns! it burnnnnnssss!"")

Comics are going well, with Prince of Ice starting it's fith chapter. with... <b><i>ELFSEX!</b></i> bwahahaha.... no. only implied <i>ELFSEX</i>. sorry, ladies! Page 81 posts tomorrow, and I've scriped almost to page 100. I've drawn a few ahead, which is what I ought to be working on, not slacking off and browsing DA... 

anyways...

I went to camp in Acadia N'ntl park last week, which was fun. I didn't really like any of the people at camp, in the sense that I would be their friend after camp, but we got along okay, I suppose. We had fun. We saw bald eagles, sea kayaked, mountain biked, hiked, watched the sunrise from Mt Cadillac... y'know, just the <i>usual.</i> ^_~ 

oh, and my writing class is also going well. We're doing alot of ""freewriting"". Freewriting. Know it. Love it. Fear it.

I've been doing that on the computer lately, with a style that works well for few panels, lots of shading needed, but when working with minimal shading (even lighting) and many panels and figures, it's really time-consuming. and If I don't take the time to do it well, it ends up messy. So I scrapped the partly-colored version on the computer and I'm coloring it with markers and colored pencils now.

Well, anyways she becomes the weapons mistress of the palace later on (that might not even figure in the story) but... te-he... I didn't even realize that I was using a stereotype until I was telling her story to my father, and I say something like: ""wait- weapon's mistress... that's kind of like a gym teacher... and... omg!

My class (8th and 9th graders) did world religions this year, so we read peace quotes from many religions... as the little script thing went down the line, I ended up reading the ""Christianity: Jesus said: ""blessed are the peacemakers""..."" (etc., I forgot the rest). My friend Mia, standing beside me almost giggled out loud, I'm rather infamous around the RE circles for being staunchly anti-christian. I'm not really, it's just fundamentalism and evangelism (ignoring science and forcing beliefs on others) that get to me... but it was still funny... and I climbed a tree after. Our church is a bit over a hundred years old, and consequently has bigger grounds than any of the houses around it. It has this HUGE beach tree. and I mean huge. It must be at least over two hundred years old. I climbed as far as it was humanly possible to. Papa took pictures. I was <i> really</i> high up. GETTING HIGH ON ALTITUDE

So since I draw/write/dowebstuffor two webcomics, I decided that this might be rather useful. or at least, that I would link to it somewhere...

my webcomics have changed since the last entry here: Travelers is now RIP (yay!) and Prince of Ice is moving into it's fourth chapter (sometime in early June, <i>hope</i>fully) I've also started a new *legasp* comic, Mage Story by name. 

the linkies are as follows: 

<a href=""http://princeice.smackjeeves.com/"">Prince of Ice</a>

and....

<a href=""http://magestory.smackjeeves.com/"">Mage Story</a>

also....

<a href=""http://darkelf92.deviantart.com/"">My devART</a>

now that that's out of the way.... the reason this place is called ""Harken! for the hour of the coffee is at hand"" is because I was at church today, and my friend Rose says that it's time for coffee hour so we should stop playing with the younger children's sports equipment on the lawn and go inside....and I give a dramatic sweep of my arm and say ""HARKEN! for the hour of the coffee is at hand!"" it took her a minute to laugh, though....

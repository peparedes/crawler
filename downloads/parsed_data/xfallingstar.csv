"event","<P>today was take your kid to work day--and my mom-being the cool cat that she is-let me stay home. me and her went to the beach from 11-3...i got lots of sun! so im not albino anymore :)</P>
<P>im working tomorrow night-which sucks-because rani invited me to go to bonzai with her. gr. but the bands arent that great anyway..so im not too crushed.</P>
<P>anyway..last night i was so upset..lots of reasons..and i did something stupid. but im sorry now that i did it..and hopefully things will get better from here--cuz i dont think they cud get worse. so im trying to not be so pessimistic and look at things more positive rather than the down side. heres how i plan to go about doing this:</P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>*study more--make a goal (get nothing lower than c's this quarter)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffcc00>*eat healthier</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffff66>*exercise..considering i always start for about a week-then stop..im guna do 100 crunches everyday..and run a mile everyday. today was the first day of this.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ff33>*go to bed earlier (instead of 12--bring it down to 9:30-10)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff>*try to not curse so much..cuz i realized today i use 'fuck, shit, dammit' in almost every sentence</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc66cc>*lose my attitude. i notice that when we go places and random people talk to us (us meaning me and my friends) - im always the one the people call a bitch..i hate it!!!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cccccc>yeah so thats my plan. later &lt;3</FONT></P>"

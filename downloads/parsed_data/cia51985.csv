"event","Okay, it's thursday and i have a LOT on my mind. So I decided to write. Me n mike are friends, and maybe I'm wrong to be his friend. But I love being his friend..Lol. He slept over Tuesday night. We sat around, and played girl talk. Lol.....he danced around my living room doing the twist. It was too funny :)  We watched endless hours of saterday night live, and had spontaneous tickle wars. We went to sleep at like...8 am, after sitting around for an hr or so just talking, because neither of us were tired. We woke up at 11, took showers, got dressed and....fell back asleep for an hour before my dad got home. Lol, then we picked up Bree and Ash, and went to the mall. My lil sisters love him to death. We shopped for like...ever! Mike hated being in the girls stores, but still managed to help me pick out stuff....I think he secretly liked it.  :)
We went to the store, n got steak and mac n cheese(i wanted chicken, but I guess I live wif carnivores.)  Lol, then we all had one giant tickle fight(me, mike, bree, n ash). Then George called, cuz he was goina come pick Mike up. How can Amanda get mad at our friendship? She made me chose, and I chose that. Because if I were sad, I could ALWAYS call mike to come make me laugh, and he does, without question, without comment, if i need him hes there. We get along, without all that excess Drama crap. Schools gona be hell without my best friend...but...I guess I'll have ot accept things. Our friendship ended a long time ago, lately we've been nothing more than ashoulder for each other to cry on. We don't hang out no more, have giant snowball fights..watch soap operas...we had good memories, but thats all in the past. I feel like I kindof made a good choice...I don't know. My mom thinks I did, as do most of myfriends They said Manderz wouldnt hav made me choose if she was sucha good friend. I  feel guillible, and really frustated. What kind of best friend was she ne way? Eck...Oh well, I guess it doesn't matter now, does it ? Well, no one is really online :) So I'ma go for a bit n take a nap. BBL! bye everyone!"

At 1st I was pretty messed up about this whole jeremy thing. I was falling for him so bad, but he was aprils..not mine! I was upset- but we talked to april.
I'm still not my 100%...i feel bad...I know Jeremy loves me, but we know so little about each other. It's not like april where they have a year and 10000 memories behind them..and i KNOW well build memories..were already starting but..it just feels funny.
other than that lil problem..I know were gonna be together forever..cuz i feel something so strong for him that i know itll keep going on...I LOVE YOU JEREMY <3 now with that out of the way...
i have a new friend. his names jeremy too and hes prolly the purest person ever..i mean he got a heatr of gold. It's good....cuz sometimes I'll be sad and he'll sing, and all my problems will just float off into space for that time. i luv you boi :P

I hate stalker losers who have no life but to bother people who are OBVIOUSLY far supirior to them. I mean not to be stuck up but I am probably 30 times better that people who have nothing better to do that talk about me when they don't even know me. Lol its crazy I hate losers. Ay ay ay.
Me and Ash are going to the mall today, to watch Beautiful Minds, and I think tomorrow were going snowboaring with the mucho dinero hotties.
Ash is pathetic, shes on the phone with Clay ""right baby right baby u know i love you itll all be okay right"" in her lil baby puppy dog voice BLEH! lol not saying shes not cool or shes pathetic, or obnoxious or any of those things. It just gets kinda sad after a while hearing her whine to her boyfriend hours on end. School was pretty good today I passed my vocab quiz, pretty cool concidering that i didnt know any of the words, but....it was pretty ez.THEN I got this rilly hot outfit, and I'm bout to wear it to the mall tonight. theres SO many hotties at the mall on friday nights. not that i look for hotties, im in a perfectly commited relationship :) right hunnie? i lub you! my nails r this ugly pink color. ""sand""...i painted them, but i couldnt find ne thing else, besides..they match my white shirt its SO cute.Now Ash is freaking out cuz Clay is talking to this girl even though its not a big deal cuz shes goin out with this ugly Blake kid. AY ay ay, the drama the drama. I cant wait to go to the movies, well first i guess well walk around the mall or something..if we even go to the mall if not we'll go to reading. No i guess were going to reading, cuz its closer, and we can make fun of manvillians. (in rays words. ""manville- where the men are men and the women are too"" ;x sept ME and some other people. lol...cuz im ALL woman baby uhh huh. lmao, im hyper too. I miss josh a LOT. josh is the greatest guy in the world, well..one of them. And ray cuz hes jUS like me...sept well..hes a guy. we think alike, we both love to snowboard, we like the same music and we can basically finish each others sentences. ;D well thats all....bye every1"

"event","I always say people wander in and out of my life like ghosts- and leave nothing in rememberance but a cold shadow...but eventually..even that fades. 
There are a few special people who go deeper though, and i always thought they actually left a mark on your soul. Who knows? Maybe when you go to heaven, God looks at your soul and sees a thousand little hand prints...each one of those being someone you shared something with in the past. Maybe a secret, maybe a part of yourself, but those people seem to live in forever in the back of your mind. I've had people like that in my life...Taylor(my best friend in the world- i love him more than anything), Josh(who never seems to go away...no matter HOW many times we break up :) ), and a few other people, I'd rather not mention.
I don't understand it sometimes, how I can care so much bout these peoples feelings, and smiles, and tears...but care SO little about everyone elses. I mean, sure I care, I feel bad, I even cry..just not in public... after all I'm human, aren't I? 
Sometimes I compare myself to Scarlett O'hara, from Gone with the Wind...I'm determined, and sort of manipulative, but not on purpose, I just do what I feel I have to...
I just can't bare to hurt cirtain people anymore...so I'd rather just make them go away, and tell my self their not worth my bother. I know they are though, I just don't wanna be wrong, I don't wanna make them hurt like I do all the time.
People don't really get these things, I mean Taylor does..of course...but I would rather kill myself than hurt taylor..and he knows it. The same as I know he would never hurt me. other people I'm just not sure...and I don't think I'll ever find out ;\
Oh a brighter note. VD day sucked. HA thanks bunches SOMEONE. I'm going to see Peter Pan 2 tomorrow with Kaitlyn. I don't want to go to school! Well thats all, sorry for not writing forever, but I had some problems...and didn't have time. See ya soon :)"

Well anyway those people are so stupid and more than likely need a life if they're so caught up on other peoples that they have to go through their journal to dig up dirt on them! i mean are you people that desperate to hate me, go for it, but whatever, i should hate u all for being a buncha retards heh.and whats with the ""lets talk about you"" crap are you really THAT dumb? apparently so.
well in other news, i havent seen joshwa in like...2 days. Where is he!? ahhh oh well lol.
Hm, Taylor's starting school, I'm so excited!! Lol, he bought notebooks and pens and everything and I think he's really serious about it! Which is great cuz you know, I like him happy n everything! Hes my best friend- the greatest big brother in the world- and i dont know what i'd do without him. In fact hes the only person in the world whose never let me doown even a little, I LUV YOU TAYLOR!
lol, on a less happy note, I broke up with pete again. It's more cuz he works all the time so i never see him than the fact that I don't care about him, cuz dont get me wrong, I do. I guess I just don't like plaing the part of a part time girlfriend. Lol Now I'm just starting to sound whiney! Well, that's all I guess.
I'm talking to Danielle again which is actually a really good thing, cuz dispite all the shit we go through she's really easy to talk to. Christine was a bitch today, she was PMSin but I still love her Amanda wasnt here today, which usually isn't cool, cuz shes the rationalist, and I'm the other half, I'm the pure emotion Lol, when I'm mad I'm mad..and I could care less who knows it. Like someone said, I think brucie said 'I get what I want, one way or another"" Ha, Yeah I'm a bitch I know.
Well I think that's all the news I have for now. I'm sure I'll come up with something else as soon as people start getting home. LOL <3 Always- me"

Each single morning
So I count on someone
Friday nights to take me dancin'
And then to church on Sundays
To plant more dreams
And Someday think of Kids
Or maybe just to save a little money

You're the one I need
The way back home is Always long,
but if your close to me
I'm holding on
You're the one I need
My real life has just begun
Cause theres nothing like
Your smile made of sun
In a world full of stangers
You're the one I know

So I learn to cook
And finally lose my kitchen phobia
Ao i've got the arms to cuddle in 
When there's a ghost or muse
That brings insomnia

To buy more things
And write more happy songs
It always takes a little help from someone

You're the one I need
The way back home is always long
But If your close to me
I'm holding on
You're the one I need
My real life has just begun 
Cause there's nothign like
your smile made of sun

You're the one I need
You're the one I need
With you my real life has just begun
You're the one I need
Nothing like your smile made of sun
Nothing like your love
Nothing like your love
Nothing like your love"

This romeo is bleeding. 
But you can't see his blood.
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up.


It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood.
You see I've always been a fighter
But without you I give up.


Now I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be.
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby, that's just me.


And I will love you, baby - Always
And I'll be there forever and a day - Always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine.
Till the heavens burst and
The words don't rhyme.
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you - Always.


Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips, to hold you near.
When you say your prayers try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man.


When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I'll wish I was him 'cause those words are mine
To say to you till the end of time.


Yeah, I will love you baby - Always
And I'll be there forever and a day - Always.


If you told me to cry for you.I could
If you told me to die for you.I would.
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay.
To say these words to you.


Well, there ain't no luck
In these loaded dice.
But baby if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams.
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines.


And I will love you, baby - Always
And I'll be there forever and a day - Always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine.
Till the heavens burst and
The words don't rhyme.
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you - Always

I don't know, Ian was special to me, so the thought that hes going home soon still bothers me.. a lot. I'd rather have him around just for the report. My feelings r kind of jumpled cuz i love pete...but part of me will always love Ian. I've never felt torn before....wow. I know Ian isnt anything to me, but I don't want to get close to him..and have him taken away again.... It's stupid, I know. If I am mean to him, and he leaves, I'll regret it...as much as I try to ignore it and forget it, he was someone special to me, and I don't want him to go thinking I hate him(although chances are 99 to 1 that he could care less)...on the other hand I dont want to be his friend again, cuz I know hes going to go, and prolly not come back and that would hurt just as bad. Well..anyway I wrote a poem about it. Lol it was a 10 second emtion poem, so dont laugh!

 stop
thats my heart u almost crushed
(again)
why dont you watch where your walking
u keep stepping on it...
good turn around 
dont come back...
just leave...
(why should i care if you dont say bye!?)
but now i miss you
(do you miss me too?)
 wait..
dont go...
im sorry...
(im always the sorry one aint i?)
no...
yuore just a boy..
youre nothing special!
(so why cant i stop caring?)
I dont love you anymore!
(Yes I do...)
I hate you!!!
So just leave...
dont come back this time
 i never want to see you again..
(but wait..i miss you)

Okay a lil corney but thats sorta how i feel right now, I don't even know why. I don't care anymore, really, and I DONT want to be his friend...I guess its just left over emotions that still need to drain. Well whatever, I'll write later bye! - Cia"

I'm sort of scared,a lot scared, because we've tried so many times and it just fell apart, I don't want it to fall apart this time. He makes me smile, he's the only person I can't keep secrets from, and no matter how long we're not speaking, or how mad we are, we always come back with something even stronger. He's hard to stay mad at, even though I can try my ass off, I always seem to smile around him.

I'm pulling away from everyone a lot..and I've noticed it too. Keith told me he misses our friendship, and I've pulled away a lot. I know I have, but I can't help it. When I'm around him I just want to cry. I can't explain it.
Im changing. Im changing fast....lol its hard though.
I realized something. I realized why Kyle's such a loser..and to some extent I feel bad- not bad enough to be nice, but bad even so.
He uses ""love""- cuz saying ""I love you"" is sort of.....a retreat. It makes you feel less lonely. To him ""love"" is seeing how much attention a girl can give him and as soon as she stops he ""falls out of love.""
It's funny cuz hes totally pathetic and attention hungry and one day hes gonna fall flat on his ass and I'mma be there to laugh at him- ok ok so im holding some animosity, HE DESERVES IT!.
Me n pete kinda got in a lil fight.I feel like im not part of his life. Ok, he has me, and that's great. But he has this part with everyone else. Like Anna...shes my girlie n i luv her 2 death but  its hard knowing she can be there whenever she wants to make him smile, and I have to drive an hour every time i wanna make him smile. I just feel like less cuz of it. 
I wrote him a poem, it's sorta corny, but it will let him know how much I love him. He makes me happy- even if he failed his written test 4 times(he wont be able to drive til hes 40 at the rate hes goin) and gets lost riding his bike across town. Hes so dumb but so cute. LOL

"event","Ya know how people say ""if you die with a handful of good friends- you'd lived a good life"". Well I realized something today that took me quite a while to see.
I thought all my friends were ""good friends"". Then I realized how Nieve I was....a good friend is someonw who had your back, through thick and thin. It's someone who appreciates you, and doesn't take you for granted. A good friend is someone who will run away with you ""just because"".
That's when I realized me and Mandie ARE good friends. I always just thought of her as my best friend. There wasn't much to it. Stupid times, a lot of smiles, and plans to just..get away.
Well now I realize WHY she is more than just an average friend.
No one else would come over your house for a week, eat your horrible cooking(trust me.....my dog woudlnt eat my cooking..and he eats anything), Plot to run away to Virginia, and know every pair of underwear I own!(lol)...only Manda...
Who else is there to eat blue bag m&m's with(even though she opened the bag and they were all over my bedroom floor!), have dirty conversations with(what does the female orgasm consist of? hehe), and put on alvacado masks at 3 AM and do each others makeup(never wear an alvacado mask- theyre itchy and they burn!)....
No one else's family is just like my own.....I can go over there and fit right in- just cuz shes my best friend.
No one else will go out with your boyfriend, just to see if he's cheating on you! Then call you from Dunkin Donughts at 10:00, run to your house, and cuss his ass out! LOL, no one except Amanda.
I'm not sure how to thank her- Maybe I haven't been as much of a friend to her as she's been to me. Maybe well drift apart one day and this'll all be a memory....but either way....
Thank you Mandie, for bein my best friend.....Even in the hard times...we made it through, and I luv ya. <3"

"event","Have you ever wondered about love? Okay- so this falling in love business is sort of rediculous of you ask me. What's the point? You let a guy get to you and somehow you end up cryin So many tears.
I guess part of the feelings is not knowing if it'll last forever-even though you hope it does.
The hardest part is that sometimes you walk away with nothing. You give up so much, and put so much on the line..for a feeling. It's like jumping in head first...and just sinking. 
And I realized something today....you could walk out of a relationship- someone you leave with nothing.The memories, the feelings, you leave and it all stays behind. 
But then you listen to the radio, and you hear a song....something about lost love. Something that until then you thought was pretty- somehow you feel it- the pain and emotion the song expresses.
You notice that you have left with something. Maybe you don't have the memories, or everything you wish you had. Instead you leave just a lil stronger and a lil more knowledgable.
If you leave with strength and knowledge...no matter how much it hurts..you will keep goin."

I didnt realize how much i did til now...He's not really the typical older brother. Hes proud of me..he said so. ""Im proud of you- You'll make a great doctor"". He is DEFFINATELY posessive when he's around. Jeez if any guy were to come within 10 feet of me they better prepare to get their butts beat! LOL.
I don't know what it is. Hes 30- old....but he don't act it. We go to concerts, see movies , hang out....He's not an adult, and I'm not a kid. He's not 14 yrs older than me. He's my brother...and I'm his kid sister. That's just it.
We don't have those stupid brother/sister arguments. We never see each other...but somehow were so close. We have a blast when we get together, and even though the times are few and far between. Seeing him or hearing from him makes me feel SOOOO good- cuz im his lil sis, and hes my big bro.
We talked for over 2 hrs, and I realized I miss him a LOT. I never thought of him through the eyes I see him through now. I never thought of him much. Just a jerk who I love, and yet doesn't love me enough to call...or visit. I see now that hes more than that. He's wiser, more knowledgable. Not that 18 year old boy, who walked out of my house one day, and never came back. Not the brother who took me in his car before any one else, or made me watch It was when I was 4, and permenently traumatized me from clowns. He's a person, with a brain that is just filled with thoughts and Ideas....maybe I was ignorant, maybe just too young...but I love my brother, and I hope more than naything I see him this summer!"

I lost someone who means everything to me. Not just a guy, not just a 3 month long relationship...but someone who meant SO much to me...someone who was my best friend, closest to my heart. He was the guy I thought about every morning before I opened my eyes and every night before I close them. I had a funeral today...I know its stupid, but it makes it easier, almost. To think of our relationship as dead and gone, than still lingering. I made it all go away, my whole memory box...burned it to the ground. Maybe it helped, a lil anyway.....cuz i knew he was gone, and never comming back...this is just..insurance.
I saw probably one of the hardest things I ever had to go through today.One Of my bestest friends...leave my life. When Brad left, I cried for a day.....then I cried one more for Taylor and Lindz because they are my other 2 important People. When Meg left, I felt alone. I felt so..independent, but at the same time, so...scared and alone. Now it's over. For the summer, Neil went away.  I hope he cant stay away, cuz if he does, I'll never stop crying. He's my cheer-er uper. When I can't tell no one what's wrong...he comes and just..knows. And he makes it ok again, hes just that kinda person. That makes his going away ten times harder. Cuz now theres no one to just...know me.
My friends broke up today. All I wanted to do was get them back together. In all their pain, it's almost like mine was somehow renewed. Jenny is like a sister to me. Seeing her cry almost brought tears to my eyes. And Keith....Keith was scaring me. He was getting so depressed he was actually happy. I'm not sure how that's possible..but Keiths always happy. Anyway, that really sucked, cuz those are the only 2 of my best's that are left. Seeing them hurt tore me up. I hope they work through this...especially now that I know some...less than wonderful information? I rilly hope they work out!
The last thing...Maybe I should just block everyone and start over..wif John N Pete N Marc n Anna....theyre nice people. I like Anna a lot, shes a sweet girl and she keeps an eye on Pete for me lol. John's a jerk...but i luv him anyway, Marc is like....lmao...Marc is...i rilly cared about marc for a rilly long time. Pete is...pete is...Um....lol. Yah. Anyway. Maybe I should start over with them....but nah...I would miss everyone too much.

Is my love for him strong enough to survive it? Allt he ""shut the f*** up b****""'s and all them other things? the things that kill me inside. He doesn't know it- i'm not sure if i want him to.

I really love him, but I keep wondering- is my love enough to hold us together when my sanity is hanging my a string? I thought it was getting better.......I thought he meant it this time....obviously I was wrong. Maybe I shouldn't have expected much....Maybe I thought too much...maybe I did something wrong.

"event","Have you ever just longed for the past? Not even a spactific someone or something, just the past?
Thats how I am right now. I don't neccisarily want heather to stop being dirty...or beve bein a hoe.
I don't neccisarily want my whole group of 7th grade best friends(Nina, Benny, J, Don, Nick) to stop bein losers....
I don't neccicarily want to go back to 5th grade, and laugh everytime someone said ""boob"" or "" bra""....i just dont want to be here..now.
I don't see why. I have my baby, who means more than ANYTHING to me..and I wouldn't give him up for the world. And I have all my good friends, just...things.
I remember Amanda and me, last summer. We were so bad! LOL, it seems like ages ago. She tought me how to love, and i tought her how to FLIRT. lol....yah we were deffinately one hell of a pair. I have to wonder to myself if I'll ever be that close again, with anyone..even her.
I wonder what made Don go away and just..forget us, I wonder what made benny best friends wif the lesbian mafia, i wonder what made nina decide to become a nympho whose always pregnant.
I wonder if I'm the only one who grew up right...and if I'm lucky or if I'm missing out on the fun they're having. I seem like I just dont fit in anymore...all my old friends are pregnant, or crackheads...and all my new friends are so ""perfect""....I'm somewhere in the middle and I'm almost being pulled into 2 parts.
I love my life right now....but for some reason I'm just longing for the past..and wondering what might have been if I would have taken the time to do just one thing differently, Maybe I'm just going through some reflecting time..but I don't know. 
All those times I cried...and people said ""one day youll look back on this and laugh""..I do.but why is it that those times people made me laugh...I'm looking back on and crying?
I guess the one thing all this crying's taught me is....sometimes people come into your life..and they just wonder out...but they leave a lil mark in your heart, that you might not see until much later. So if you can, if its possible..just let those people know you love them, because the next day, they might not be there to tell...then you'll spend the rest of your life wishing you could just say ""you made a difference to me"""

"event","Okay, its 2 AM and I am writing. I have nothing better to do. Maybe I just have a lot on my mind and feel the need to get it out.
I got some memories in my mind, little things that don't mean much, yet somehow mean the world...like a river of thoughts- its just flowing, winding, trying to find it's way out but gets tangled more and more in with everything else. How does that happen? Anyway, I was just on the phone with my ""good friend"", and Kyle. 
Shes more of a backstabbing bitch, and she's got the hormones of a 40 yr old unmarried man...but ANYWAY, we were on 3 way just talking about things. Basically how everyone's doing, Who loves who, what happened, how things happen. 
Then I'm not sure what happened, but somehow I got suckered into calling Kyle back in 5 mintues.
I called him back and hes not answering the phone, which means he must be pretty busy or something- IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, which is kind of gross if you think about it.
Maybe I'm just better off with pete...At least He treats me like a lady. GR!"

"event","Okay, so today sucked. I fell in love. How much does that just tear you apart? It was all good, til he broke my heart...again and again..and then again. And I still love him. Then Pete comes along.....when I needed a friend, he was there, when I needed a person to just talk to and not be all serious with, he was there. And maybe I developed a crush. Not a big one though. He's kinda..I don't know. You know those feelings you get? Tummy aliens and vein fishies? Well I never got them once with Pete...but hes a great guy, and I don't know, he sure cares about me enough.I can learn, right? 
Okay, so Then out of nowhere, Kyle comes back, and he's sad...and Lil Miss Fix It Over here had to play Psychiatrist because his g/f hurt him. Not saying that I wouldn't want to be there for him..just that every time we come in even a mear 100 ft contact of each other somehow theres a spark, and somehow I get hurt.
Gruesome huh? Yeah I think so too. That's why when he came I put up all defenses. I mean, I wasn't even NICE, and yet somehow he wedged right into that would HE created to begin with and made my heart melt.
Who does he think he is? And then he comes out of NO WHERE, saying that he still has feelings for me and hes falling back in love with me. Jeez, you'd think a semi-relationship with a guy you don't love would be hard enough.
Anywho, I guess because of everything that happened, my ex(Kyle) is SO insecure and Pete(my semi-boyfriend) is just...perfect, but theres no love! And Kyle is basically insisting I'd hurt him, so why SHOULD i give him another chance? Except, I forgot, I love him with all my heart.
So basically, I'm contemplating this. Do I let the guy I love go because I'm inevitably goig to get my heart broken....or should I stay and give up a guy who would do anything for me?"

"event","Well, I haven't written in a while. Guess there wasn't much to say. Me N Kyle have been fighting a lot and most of my life was consumed by....pain actually. Weird huh? Just...pain. 
Anyway, tonight i kinda....re-discovered fun. I'd forgotten how fun it can be to just kick back and have an all out giggle fest with your friends!
We started at Kristen's Party....I got there at 6, and by 6:30 the whole gang was there(Kristen, Jen, Beve N Rob, Manda, Jimmy, Mikey, Chris, Kelly, Christine, Jack, Dave, The other Chris, Danielle.)
Well, for the most of the beginning, we played volleyball. Sounds dumb, it wasn't! We had a blast..lol, looking at Jack's Abs, WHEW!
Then came the water fight where no one left dry. I was probably the most wet...Trying to wrestle a bucket from one of the guys. LOL, I was ambushed!!!
Then we went downstairs...played truth or dare...and then i picked up a balloon and played ""keep it up"" with Jack..I was giggling the whole time, and he, laughed(he had the BIGGEST dimples..i love dimples) said ""You are ammused by the dumbest things"". That made me smile too...then Jimmy came, and we brought another balloon.....we sucked, but besides that....by the end of the game, every person there was in our lil game.....and we had balloons EVERYWHERE. Popping them.....falling on our butts, trying to keep them up. It was...probably and interesting sight!
After a while..in complete boredom, we dressed up the boys. Well not exactly..we did their hair! Dave's hair got Spiked...Mike's was kinda spikey...Chris's was WILD, and Jack's had a lil bow!
Then we realized the fireworks had started and we walke- RILYL QUICKLY!- to gerber feild. When we got there we all just FELL, lol, in the middle and layed down lookin up at them- they were beautiful....i love fireworks more than anything...Manda goes ""Know what Guys? There's no one I'd rather be here with"" I almost died right then. I realized I must have the BEST group of friends in the world..and I had never even THOUGHT of it like that. Then Jack ruined our moment with ""I wonder how many Latins it took to make these fireworks"" LOL, but it made me laugh.
As Iwatched them light up the sky, my mind could only concentrate on Kyle. I couldn't tell you why..he is my world..and he completes me..I don't wanna give that up. We'd gotten into a fight earlier, and JEEZ...the communication SUCKED
Anyway....after that, everyone started goin home, and me and Jen decided we'd call my mom to pick us up from Chris's...So me her, Mikey, Dave, and Chris walked back to his house.
I called my mom..and she was on her way...but she didn't get there for like..1/2 hr, and for that WHOLE time we had this GREAT conversation. I didn't realize how GREAT the guys were....as people, and friends..not just ""the guys"" you know?
So when I got home, it started. We broke up..me and Kyle, and I jus..died inside. My heart was broken. I just couldn't let him go. I called him and after like...hours of fighting..and hours of my heart just..breaking. We're back together. 
I seriously died inside tonight.....I got to the point where there was nothing left, I got to the point of...I dont know..i was scaring myself.
Even though I love Kyle, it wasn't all him. It was all the mistakes...all those things that you just ""HOPE"" you did the right thing..you know? Cross yer fingers and pray.....
With him Im the happiest I've ever been and Ihope he doesn't give up on us. He's my soul...and my heart...and I love him so much. He'll never know how much I love him..It's too late to be up, I'll write more tmorrow."

"event","Okay, if there were a bad day of bad days, this would be it! Lindz, Brad, and Taylor left this morning. Brad and Taylor are my boys, I call Taylor my older brother- cuz thats what he acts like! Brad is just, the one who makes laugh when I'm sad and stuff. Lindz is Taylor's girlfriend, Brad's sister, and the only other girl in our thingee...so it's cool. The won't be home til august. Well, I spent all night last night up streessin so I slept right through them leaving. Thank god Lindz wrote me an email!!! I think I'd die if they left without saying bye.
Then I woke up to my phone ringing, and my boyfriend on the other line. I love kyle,with all my heart, but ""fuck you bitch""'s weren't exactly a pleasant wake up call. He was mad because I didnt tell Pete me and him were back together. I guess I don't blame him for being mad. I deserved it, a LOT...but I don't know, I went through hell..including telling Pete EVERYTHING. Jeez......telling him was probably the harest thing I've ever had to do. Especially knowing he loves me...I had no reason to hurt him, yet I did for kyle. 
And I did...I cried, and somehow, all my pain didnt matter. He was mad again..because I cared. I did all that and his trust still wasnt renewed..that was hard....Painful....and it made me feel SO gross. 
Then he got all....clingy. I felt like a clostrophobic stuck on an elevator for an hour with 8 other people! It was SAD- anyway, when he finally got over that, my friend Meg's Ex nick got all suicidal..and of course, Meg asked lil mrs. fix it to help, so of course, I tried even though I didn't feel much like fixin nothin but myself....
Well, Aside from having the WORST day int eh world...things have kind of calmed down now, and I guess tey're back to normal...or as normal as theyve ever gotten....but i still feel like just dying. My mood hasnt changed much. Maybe all I need is a good nights sleep..and I'll get myself together in the morning."

"event","Okay So I know what I want. I want Kyle and it's always been kyle. I'm stupid, I'm insecure, I'm scared..but I'm in love and I guess that's all that matters.
The person I become when I'm with him is..Amazing. he's not only my best friend, and the most wonderful person in the world to me....when we were apart, I thought I would die. Litterally, it was hell getting up every morning. Whenever we broke up, I had to be dragged out of bed in the mornings, if I went to school at all! I just wanted to die.
All my friends knew something was up, but I don't know..they just didn't want to listen? Or maybe they didn't see me upset often and thought it would pass? Whatever it was, no one knew how hurt I was inside, except my best friends. 
He makes my life worth living, and he makes every day seem...better somehow. I will NEVER give him up, and I know somehow through all of this..he wont give me up either..OR SO I HOPE."

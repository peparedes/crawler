"event","again, all of my live journal posts are very random. 

I'm still cool--so it's good.


Senior year is going amazing, and i could not ask for a better year. I have wonderful friends to share it with. I have no idea where i want to go to college, it's actually stressing me out..because i have to apply soon. I would love to get the heck outta kentucky & go anywhere. But i'm a girl & a young one at that, it's probably best to at least stay in the state for a year or two. I'm going into broadcasting, that should be interesting. 

hmmmm..i don't know what to talk about because honestly, i don't know what i think anymore. I have no idea what i feel or what my heart feels lately. I've realized that guys suck & there is no way that i can change that. That's about the only think i know right now.

My heart is not in the right place right now, i've been getting into a lot of trouble lately which is catching up with me everyday. Not to bad of trouble but enough for me to know that the decisions i have made are bad ones.


but enough of that kind of stuff--just thought i would chill on live journal for a little bit.
But i'm going to go watch SNL


peace"

Well i'm completely happy right now. It feels like a huge rock was laying on my shoulders for 3 years and it's finally lifted. I honestly just don't care anymore. I'm actually starting to be myself. For almost my whole life i have always been the person everybody wanted me to be. I know what i want in life and it's awesome. Not what my parents want, not what my friends want. It's what i want...and it feels great. I'm having a blast right now...


My friends are wicked awesome...I would be lost without them. I'm so blessed to have best friends like them. Most of us put the past behind us and moved forward. We laugh at the stuff that happened in the past too. I think it's hilarious how retarded I was. I'm a totally different person than what i used to be. I look at life in different aspects now. 


I'm so proud of myself and the changes i have made to make myself a well rounded person. I've been blinded for so long and could not see the ones who were just using me. 


I'm not scared of getting hurt anymore, it's just a way of life. People will hurt you all of the time. I know i have hurt people that really care for me too. I have wasted so many years thinking that friends or whoever would hurt me. But in reality it was just me.


High school is almost over. I have one more year, and i'm going to make it the best year i have had yet. I'm going to share it with the people i care about and love and it will be awesome. 

College who knows where i'll end up. All i know is, my parents are going to help me with anything i need. I can't wait to become something of myself. I'm going to Arizona and California with Sarah this summer. It will be our little road trip..but on a plane. I'm going to go look at University of California, and see if i like it there. 


Well, I'm done for now.

It's almost summer and i'm freakin excited!!!!!

"event","Well..


yes, i got sucked into writing yet another ""live journal"" entry. I guess i'm just kinda bored at the moment. I used to have a little journal in my room i would write in..but i don't do that anymore. So a lot has went on just in the past week, and i'm finally resting and not doing anything tonight. Which is completely amazing since I always do something. But I figured i should rest since i have strep throat! How awful is that? I have not had it since like the 3rd grade. I just feel so bad..i don't know? 


Lets see..I got back from winterfest where it was such an experience, that i loved. I had so much fun with people i really care about. Also i was determined to meet a guy there and i met TWO! Which one was like me just in a guy, wow i still keep in touch. They have myspace so thats pretty cool. But anyways, he sang relient k! Ahh..yeah i know i about died. But the other one--wow i feel like a little whore--but i'm not. Anyways, he asked me to ice skate with him. He was really sweet and he actually calls me and talks to me everyday which is pretty awesome.


But i don't think the whole long distance relationship thing works. So there just friends of myn. But i'm ""talking"" to someone who treats me sweeter than anyone has in my whole life. I just don't know, i'am afraid to give someone my heart right now..so maybe we can be friends for now and see how it goes. I don't know? I think some guys really need to grow up and i'm just afraid i will find someone like that again.

lets see...uhhhhhhh---Oh the biggest part of my life that i think about like almost everyday is that i will be getting my license in like less than a month. Shew i can't wait! It's going to be really funnnnnnnnn...Actually i hate driving, like my mom asks me to drive all the time and i'm like thats okay. But i just want the freedom of going anywhere i want to. Or not really that because i know my parents will be like you have to ask us first..but they don't care--they used to but not anymore. I mean they care, but there just more laid back than they used to be.

So i went to New York for Christmas which was amazing and beautiful. It was so much fun too! I met someone there also, but he came up to me and was like do you have facebook? So i have some new york friends now--whoo exciting huh?......

Shew i can't wait till my junior year is OVER--it's soo freakin hard. Like i never stop working--ehh and in english we have to start research papers--that sucks! But i like english so hopefully it won't be that bad. 

Well i'm starting to feel really bad..so i'm gonna lay down.

WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!"

"event","well, yet another entry in my live journal. This is really sad..but i'm just gettin kinda tired of myspace so i don't really get on or do anything with it.

Well, i'm soo excited right now--i actually have no clue right now. I guess i'm just excited for Homecoming week next week! It's going to be sooo good! But i was sad they moved our powder puff night to a different night =/ so that kinda sucks, but oh well.

Uhh i've noticed i say well, like, and awesome alot. Yeah actually it's pretty embarrassing, because i was on the radio last month and they were asking me how i enjoyed new york and things (it was a september 11th thing) My reply was, ""awesome"" ha thats pretty retarded..

Tonight i'm just really tired and i didn't feel like going anywhere. I think we are to do something tomorrow maybe? But i'm spending the night with lindsey sunday night because some of my friends are doing Desperate Housewives for movie star monday! So we are going to spend the night with lindsey. Actually i think just me and tara are and then were going to meet the rest at someone elses house? I don't know.

Uhhh...i'm soo confused with the whole ""boy issue"". This person and I have been talking since last october off and on. I don't know whats going on? I have feelings for him but who knows? But i don't really worry about things like that anymore. It's stupid when people get weird about that whole issue of being single and stuff. I think it's actually pretty awesome. I feel sorry for some of my friends who have boyfriends and they won't let them do anything. 

uhh soccer is over, i'm kinda glad because i can actually sleep! I still have performing arts. But it's not like everyday or anything..

Well i'm gonna go call one of my friends..

Peace Out Girl Scout!

"event","wow, how random is this posting on my live journal? Well just got bored on the internet..and thought nobody was on myspace so i will write in this ole thing. I don't even know if anybody even uses this anymore. Well guess someone does now =)

ha things have change since the last time i posted. I wont get into that..anyways, its funny how things change. Actually i wished i wouldn't have read my live journal it kinda made me sad. 

Life is going soo much better you will regret not forgiving people. right now. I thank god for everything he has given me this year. Even though its like just beginning, its just so much better than last year. I'm thankful for everything my family, friends. Just everything, i can say i'm definitely a stronger person. All i can say is you learn from your mistakes and only try to make life better. You can't blame anyone for things that happen in your life, even though i want to hate some people it's not right. Because you are supposed to forgive people =)..that's what i'm working on at the moment.. forgive and forget. It's hard but in the end it's an awesome accomplishment and better in the end!

uhh yeah..i just figured nobody would read this so i would write in this and just write what i've been through and what i've learned from my mistakes.

wow i'm a junior and i haven't, wrote in this thing since i was a freshman..thats crazy. I guess it's good to have this thing because i had forgot half of the things i did and wrote in this thing and said.

Well..homecoming is coming up..i'm going with my best friend clay..that should be fun =) he is an awesome guy. Then i think after homecoming we are all going over to my friend lindseys house and hanging out and stuff..should be fun! Yay! I'm already excited!! wahoo 

I like this..i love writing! Lately i've been thinking about becoming a journalist..maybe..maybe not...who knows? riiiight!

Well this summer i went to a showchoir camp where i met amazing people. It was a life experience. This may sound stupid but these people changed my life. I would tell them about my life and what was going on. They just would have a better outlook on things and such a positive attitude about things that happened in there life. It's amazing how someone can just change you in a week. I have became more outgoing..wow yes very outgoing more understanding about people. It's weird but yea..

It's amazing to look at all my other posts, like when i was a freshman..and just how much i've changed. How more grown up it seems like i'am. Speaking of that uhhh college, i've been having to start applying for scholarships and stuff. It's sad, i mean dont get me wrong i can't wait to get out of here. Thats another thing when i was a freshman i used to say nooo i'm not leaving pikeville i want to stay here. Well i don't! I want to go to UK maybe--i don't know where i'll end up. But my parents say that want me to stay here for a year or two. But i can't i seriously can't put up with ""pikeville politics"" anymore absolutely ridiculous! Oh well..it's everywhere--but it's a small town. I guess i just don't like small towns. I want to live in a city where nobody knows everybody!! 

Well i'm just rambling on and on and i think i wanna go watch a movie or something..maybe like uhhhh the lake house (AWESOME MOVIE!!) or like i don't know..

But I'm out girl scout!

Wow its been forever since I've updated...shew...well i prob wont remember everything...but i know that we went to Memphis tenn. and saw where elvis was barried and his house...and then we went to Nashville and stayed with my family...it was alot of fun..we went to the grand ole opry...which was really cool...we saw that girl that sings on the streets of heaven...(really sad song)...yep

Im trying to thing...Last Wednesday...Matt came over and stayed for a little bit...then he took me to youth group...then after we went to applebees...then my parents went swimming at dewey lake...so they werent done yet...so my mom told me i could go to matts hosue for a little bit...so we watched moulion rouge (WOW THAT WAS SPELLED WRONG!)
anyways...then my dad picked me up and i came home and basically went to bed...

Thursday...I just slept most of the day...it was kinda boring...

Friday*We woke up pretty early...got ready and my mom and dad took us up to the lake again to go swimming it was me,lyndsei,mom,dad,and my aunt...which was pretty fun we stayed there for awhile and i got sum sun on my face and shoulders...then we went to chelseas party...and stayed a little bit...but matt got a headache so we left...and matt took me and lyndsei home....Then me and matt watched degrassi and muted the tv...and said what we think that they were saying...it was sooo funny...and then my mom came in there and talked to us forever...and then matt stayed for along time* then he left =(...

Saturday*My aunt and cousin (lyndsei) left...so we went to Louisville...and they got on a plane and left...i will miss them...then mom,dad and me met my dads sister and kobin*and then new baby micka--and we ate at cracker barrell....it was alotta fun....then we left and got home like at 12:00 or 1:00...

Sunday*I went to church with my dad...then my parents said that i could hang out with matt because it was his last day he was going to be here before he goes to camp..
so matt met us at rax and dad,me and matt ate...then dad took me to matts house...and stayed there till 6 something...then matt my mom...then i decided that wasnt enough...so i asked my mom if matt could come over...and i called my dad and she said yes...so then matt came over and my mom got long johns and we ate and watched coach carter...good movie by the way*..then we got on the internet...and then he had to leave :'(.....then i went to bed

Monday*..My mom said that lindsey sacratini could come over and stay all night so she did...my mom picked her and we went to the vet because my doggie is sick (cole)...and then we went to fiesta...then came home and we told jokes and found jokes on the computer...then we went and played volleyball...because my mom got our net up...and we played till 10:30...It was SOOO much fun...we got danny taylor...practically my uncle over and he played...so did my mom...it was soo much fun..and i can serve a new way no i can like hit it up in the air! WHOO HOO...i was happy...then me and linds went inside...and i took a shower...then we got on the internet...and talked to some people...then watched hitched...then ate a snack...pizza rolls...and she scared me the whole time...oh and before that happend my dad made us VIRGIN strawberry dacris...sooo good...hehe but then we went to bed and watched...raven...or something i dont remember...

Today*(Tuesday)*..My mom woke me and lindsey up and we got ready for the hospital...and we were so tired...but we did it anyways...we got there and we worked in volunteer information desk..which is fun...then lauren came and got us...so we went to lunch and ate with lauren,leslie,clay and willam hogg...and i think thats it...then we went to E.R registration....and got papers to tare out and highlight...it was fun clay did it with us...then it got slow so we went to Out patient...it was slow...so we went to E.R registration and took patients to the waiting room and stuff...which was fun ...and then after that we checked out and waited on our parents...then my mom had to go to food city...so we did...and then we came home...and i have been laying around*bored outta my mind* I think ill call some of my friends...

I miss matt soooo much i cant hardly stand it...like i cant call him or anything...because he cant talk on the phone..that sucks sooo bad....like its been the worst today...then that means tomorrow...will be horrible...then the next day unbelivable...oh well he is comming back saturday* I CANT WAIT*

Well kiddos...i think im going to go in the living room or call some of my peeps...
Love you all*
God Bless*

"event","Well..
Things have been crazy for me..and i thought since that it is summer now..that things would start to calm down..well i guess not...Maybe after saturday..or next week whenever state is over with..

Well lets just start from: 
Monday--Region are track meet...we had to be there at like 11 i think..we got there and had to load a bunch of this big stuff and it was just us girls..so that was hard..then we went back home and my mom had to fix chilli for the concession..and i watched some tv and ate for a little while..and then we had to be there at 4:30...Well guess who got to hold the hot chilli in the car...so it wouldnt spill..take a wild guess...yes me...then we got there and we set up hurdles and stuff then i just walked around and stuff...then i ran a lap...and i went to go change and right when i got done changing...it started to PORE the rain...we were drenched...then we just layed around a bit..and then i went home with beth..me and chelsea spent the night with her...and we acted stupid then went to bed....

Tuesday-Track practice..came home..then matt came over and we played pay day...a board game...and then watched a little bit of tv..and then he went home...

Wednesday-track practice..we actually ran ALOT..which is really good for us..i think because most of the time practice..is just wasteful...but i really think we got a good practice in...or maybe i just thought that..anyways..i went home and thats about it! haha dont member the rest....

Thursday(today)-We had track practice which it was at the bob amos which i think is good because thats where we are having it saturday...so we go to do what we will be running on saturday...then my mom had to go to stacies...well i jsut slept there of course...but then..my mom left and had to go to wal-mart...so she was looking down this flower aile..and isaw these cute little fishies..and i wanted one...and i called my dad to see if he thought my dog would knock the tank over...he said no....and he was like morgan i think we should get a little bit bigger one...he was like well i be ther ein a minute...well me and my mom waited forever and i had a headache so we just left...so maybe we will get to go sometime to get some fishies!! YAY!! Whoo Hooo*

I dont know about friday yet people..im not thats so raven..hahaha okay anways...the ""plans"" are that i have practice at bob amos i think morning again..and then my mom is going to pick up my cousin in lexington so me and matt are going with her...YAY!! so that should be fun...

Everybody!! Come and watch the track meet!Bob Amos at 1:00!!

.*-.Well i think im going to go watch tv in bed then call matt...well love you all!!* God Bless*.-*.

Shew..this week has been rather sad for me...thursday was are last day...which wasnt sad...because no its SUMMER!!!...But the seniors graduated...WOW...i've never been that sad at a graduation before...well close friends of myn...cameron harding and tommy tibbs graduated...which makes me sad...me and tara cried...but anywhoo*

After graduation my parents...me and matt...went to camerons house...for a little graduation get together i guess...so we ate and talked and stuff and we didnt leave there till like 12 or something...and it stormed really bad that night..we got home and lost power =( which sucked...because i had practice the next morning...

So i went to practice...and where my calfs are hurting mrs.lowe said it wasnt a good idea for me to run...so i didnt...but it started raining anyways..so we got out early...

But today we also had practice and jessica ratliff and me ran a little bit..where her hip is hurting her..and my calf...so i find out that i have to run a 1600 relay..which is one lap and running as fast as you can..and that makes me a little nervous considering i have never done that one...but 0h well i guess....

Region is Monday and Saturday......i think monday night im supposed to spend the night with beth after its over and we have practice the next morning...so me and chels will prob spend the night with her! =)

Well matt just left my house...dad,mom,matt and me went saw a movie today i forgot what it was called but it was like 2 and half hours!!...but then afterwards...my mom decided to cook tacos so matt came over and we watched a serious of unfortunate events...which was really weird..but anyways then matt stayed a little bit..then he left about 10minutes before 12...but anyways..i love him*thats also another thing...on prom night...matt told me he loved me...while we were dancing!!...it was sooooo sweet*and on prom night we had been dating 4 months!! =)...in 15 days we will be dating 5 months...how sweet right?- 

But anywhoo...Im going to get off here and get ready for bed..because i have church tomorrow*Luv ya bunches n bunches*

Anywhoo*i track practice today..which sucked becuase my calf was hurting and mrs.lowe massaged it and she said i have two knots in it and that i would have to put ice on it and stuff and she said that shw would see how it is by friday----i might go the the doctor..who knows??

Well im sad that the seniors are not going to be there next year...like cameron,tommy,chris,amy,channing...and there is more i just cant think right now..but yeah its sad =( ---

Because i do like this guy..but im not gonna say just yet! ;)! But Hopefully he will ask me...see he told me that he liked me but i just didnt believe him because he has told me before that he liked me and then never asked me out!?? so who knows maybe he just a shy guy to ask girls out???...Oh well i hope he asks me!-*....

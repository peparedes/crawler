"event","YAY!! I am moving into school tomorrow! I am so excited.  It's going to be a great year.  Packing sucks, I'm finally done tho, but tomorrow I have to unpack...grr...it's gonna be fun tho.  I can't wait to meet my roommates and it's going to be so awesome rooming with Ashley! I really can't believe it's here. Summer went by way too fast!! I am so excited and all, but I'm so sad that summer is over. UGH! I don't really have much to write tonight other than the obvious.  I will write more once I am in school.  Have a good night!"

"event","Sorry everyone for not updating my journal lately. I've been busy, out of town, stuff like that. I have been very stressed and irritated lately! I just feel like a lot is going on. I have a lot of last minute things to do before school starts.  I am feeling uneasy about that too.  I am excited, but also not ready to start classes again and things like that. I found out my roommates on Saturday.  That was exciting. I've talked to both of them, they seem really cool.  My other roomie is of course Ash!!! Yay for that, we're going to have a blast! I need to finish getting all my stuff for school ready and packed.  I have to babysit the next two weeks and when I'm not babysitting I will be in Canada this weekend for a family vacation and then hopefully the next weekend I can get last minute things for school. I can't believe the summer is almost over, I only have 2 more weekends, it's so crazy.  I really think this will be a good year tho.  I'm living with my best friend, I have Phi Mu, I am taking some pretty good classes I think, I will have my own  bedroom.  Things will be good!! Oh, and back to the partying scene too!! Yay for that! I am taking a lil this fall so I have to get my book done for that.  It's coming along really well.  I am ALMOST done, only a few more little touches left to do. Anyone watch The Assistant? Lol, I am watching that right now, it's so funny and so weird, but I like it. I found out some exciting news a few days ago. My cousin Tracy is pregnant!  I am so excited for that. We've all been waiting for her to be!! I'm so excited!!  Well, I better get going to bed, I have to babysit in the morning. Goodnight :)"

"event","Well today was alright.

I had a long day though. Worked at Remer's 8-5, I'm not used to normal people hours. Made some extra cash though which is always nice. It's Wednesday night, which means it's almost Thursday, which means it's ALMOST the weekend...can ya tell I want it to just be Friday??  My days in the summer are so random, I've just decided that. I either babysit or sit home and do nothing or get called into my dad's office randomly. I guess it's good to be random like that, change of pace and all, but this summer overall has just been crazy.  

Last night was fun, went out with Ashley and Nik. Rode in Nik's new ride, met a hot boy and went to a movie, it was a good night. 

Tonight I found out some depressing news, not gonna share it, some may know, others will just have to ask. It sucks for me though! ASH!!! HELP! I know, I know, I already know what you'll keep saying to me.

Well I don't have much to say tonight, but maybe I'll have a more exciting day tomorrow, never know when you babysit.  

Goodnight :)"

"event","So this is the first time I've written in the live journal.  It seems pretty cool.  Today was an alright day.  I babysat from about 7:30-3:30.  Kids wear you out!! Felt lazy today and just hung out at home after I babysat.  

I've been thinking about school a lot lately, not really sure why, I still have over a month before I go back.  I think I'm just getting really excited because of my dorm and everything. I will be in the new towers which are really, really nice, only been used one time.  I'm just excited for a whole new, fresh start.  

I went up north this past weekend.  I went up to my cottage, took Ashley.  It was a fun time.  We rode the jet ski and just about killed ourselves.  Tipped it completely over and that was rough.  I am really sore from riding.  It was fun though.  We went on boat rides and went swimming...got a lot of sun.  

Well, I am going to get going to bed now, I'm exhausted.  Goodnight"

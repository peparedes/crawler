"event","Ok, so 140 characters is totally inadequate to explain this project to you so I'm providing a little summary here and some of my thoughts on the experience.

The charity is organising the tutoring is called <a href=""http://www.theaccessproject.org.uk/"">The Access Project.</a> Their basic premise is to enable school children from state schools who are intellectually bright but financially disadvantaged to aim higher and attend a top university. They work with schools to select children who would benefit from personal tutoring. The children who are chosen must first demonstrate their dedication by doing a number of after school academic activities. They are then screened for suitability via interview. The idea being that they will only accept kids who have proven they will put in the effort required. 

The children will typically be either trying to meet a very high offer, i.e. tutoring could be the difference between them obtaining and A or a B grade in their most important subject. Or, they may need tutoring in their weakest subject to pull that grade in line with their other marks, i.e. trying to get a B instead of a C. This project is not for children who are <i>not</i> academically capable - it is intended to get bright kids the grades they deserve for the work they put in, and to make them believe that they can and should be aiming higher.

If you're in my generation (I'm 36) you'll recall the whole Tony Blair thing about wanting 50% of school leavers to attend university. Now, certainly LOADS more school leavers do attend university now (as someone who works in HE I do not necessarily agree that this is a good thing, in absolute terms) HOWEVER, the amount of state school leavers attending top universities has not really changed in that time. <b>This is the disparity which The Access project is trying to address.</b>

Currently The Access project is based in London, but in the next academic year they are expanding to Birmingham. By 2019 they aim to have expanded to Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds & Bradford. Right now they have about 600 voluntary tutors. To fulfil their aims they will need more like 6000. 

So what are the requirements for being a tutor? You need to have either an A level or a degree in a subject which they are offering tuition in. If you have an A level you can tutor at GCSE level. If you have a degree you can tutor at A level in that subject. 

You will need to do a half day training course, which is very straightforward and mostly relates to child safeguarding, i.e. taking care that you know how to behave appropriately with your tutee and that you know how to respond if something is wrong with them etc. There is a bit of time spent on actual tutoring but that session is largely about what it means to be a tutor in terms of your responsibility to the child. There is no assessment for tutors taking the training course (in case that might put anyone off), you just go along and learn what you need to know.

After you have been tutoring for a while someone from the project will come and sit in on a tutorial to check you're doing ok and not doing anything crazy. I will admit that I was incredibly nervous about my assessed tutorial beforehand, but it went like clockwork. Afterwards I felt like I'd sat an exam - very relived and proud of myself. 

Voluntary tutoring has been a great experience for me. At times it has been incredibly rewarding in a direct way, e.g. when my tutee tells me that they really impressed one of their teachers with a great answer to a question - entirely because of some work we did in a tutorial. It is also rewarding overall because I completely support the aim of the charity to essentially combat elitism in education in this country.

One thing you need to seriously think about before getting involved is time. You are expected to commit to doing a one hour tutorial each week. With my tutee we ended up doing alternate one hour and two hour sessions as we wanted to cover exam questions as well as syllabus material and we found one hour each week wasn't enough. Obviously it is up to the individual tutor-tutee pairings to work it out between them. But that one hour is just your contact time. You're going to need extra time on top of that to i) cover the material yourself and ensure you're familiar with it, and ii) prepare work for the tutorial. I would say as a rough guide you'll need to have anywhere between 2-6 hours spare each week for that. It will depend on how familiar you are with the subject, obviously. In my case, I work in parasitology which is a very specialised subset of human biology, but to tutor a level biology I had to go back and relearn topics like photosynthesis which I NEVER thought I would have to cover again EVER. 

Yes, it does take up some of your time and effort. But anything that is worthwhile in life will do that. It really is worth it in my opinion.

If you follow the link above you should be able to see how to apply, what subjects you can tutor in, etc. Do have a look and see if you think you can help. Feel free to ask me if you have any questions."

"event","Today being my first full day off for study leave I thought I would go downstairs and spread my stuff out on the big island in the kitchen.  I mean, I have a big enough desk but since I have <b>FIVE</b> subjects to revise for and they all have a big pile of notes, references and a couple of text books each I'm getting a bit hacked off having to put everything away when I switch subjects.  

So I took all my microbiology stuff downstairs and sat down.  But the bloody nest of birds that is in the eaves above the kitchen windows is SO noisy.  They never shut up!  In fact they keep up a regular racket and then it gets EVEN louder at times.  It wouldn't be so bad a noise if I were outside because it would be just one of many noises out there, but this is coming through double glazing loud and clear.  

I suppose it would be wrong to get a long stick and poke the nest out so that the cats could eat the birds after it fell two storeys to the ground?  Only joking.

Thanks also to the car full of teenagers that just spent an hour parked at the back of my house with all the doors open playing crappy R&B with the base and volume turned up to the max.  Don't have a head-on collision with a huge tree on the way back to your OWN homes, will you."

"event","Went to my dentist yesterday.  While he was feeling around my jaws from the exterior I was thinking, OMG you're going to tell me that I have some sort of tumour, aren't you, and then I'll fail all my exams through freaking out.  But, no that was just my massive paranoia.  He said that I had turned a corner as far as my gum problems went.  He thought that they were going to get worse after the last time he saw me, but I have done really well!  I wanted to ask for a badge or something.  It felt the same as when my boss praises me at work. :D  Besides, my dentist is SUCH a nice bloke, not just for being ultra friendly and nicey-nice, but because he has always been honest with me.  I'm pretty sure he hasn't ripped me off for any unecessary dental work yet either!

On the way home I went via the shops and was just standing in amazement staring at the fresh bread: being shocked that there was any left at 5.30pm (this supermarket seems to think that nobody would want to buy fresh bread after 4pm most days) when I was tapped on the shoulder.  For a second I thought, who are these people and why on earth do they think that I would want to speak to them even if I do know them (shopping makes me grumpy).  Then I cottoned on that it was the ultra nice man from the coffee shop at the station with his wife.  I think they may qualify as THE nicest couple I have ever met.  Yes, they're even nicer than my dentist.  After managing to score a pleasant person on the checkout too, I was strolling home thinking how great it would be to have coffee-shop man and his wife as neighbours.  When I got I observed to Mr Isis that I felt so incredibly happy that I had just spoken to some of the nicest people I have ever known, I felt like a care-bear (for once it wasn't grumpy bear!).  Being the pessimist that I am, I have to say why can't everybody be that nice?

In other news, my exams start on Monday.  I am terrified."

"event","Ha!  That'll teach me to give myself a summer off!  Now I am drowning in work for college.  I just started back for my final year of my degree this week.  The college switched things around so that although the degree is modular - NOW it isn't!  I know, doesn't make any sense to us either!  What this means is that we have finals in the summer.  So we do two modules this term and have no exam on them until June.  Now I know that lots of people do courses that are like that, but the point is <i>we didn't</i> - they just moved the goal posts with a year to go.

After that news I thought that next semester would be the killer, but oh no, they really are starting as they mean to go on.  Firstly none of the timetables or course handbooks or course materials are on the college's intranet, so we have no access to them...which is awful.  Also, I have had an assessed practical sprung on me  with a week's notice.  This means I'll be going into work tomorrow (yes, that's Saturday) to go over slides of kidney tissue in preparation for Tuesday.  I have bloody data handling tutorials for Clinical Chemistry every Tuesday at 9am *bangs head on desk* which is my idea of hell.  

Basically I have a tough workload until June, after that I think I'll go on a mad bender.  

Did I mention that I should have done most of the practical work for my undergrad practical project by now too?  Except I haven't even got a definite title yet.  Cue hysterical laughter.  The only redeeming factor here is that I scored the nicest academic in the whole school to be my project supervisor at work.  I could happily fall to my knees and worship this man, he is so nice and polite and helpful - the opposite to almost every other lecturer you could ever meet.  He's also a VERY successful research scientist who did some ground breaking stuff in the area that I plan to do my project - that doesn't hurt, I guess.

I am also starting to stress about all the teaching I am going to be involved with at work this academic year.  Not that I don't enjoy it - I really do, but I don't get enough chance to practice my microscopy skills in parasitology and I really wish I knew more about the clinical side of infectious diseases.  I know that I am not training to be a doctor or a nurse (YET!) but because we are teaching nurses and medics they do ask you things about the patients and treatment and stuff.  I suppose there are just not enough hours in the day and there are too many things that I want to learn at once! :D

On the plus-side I managed to NOT go to visit my in-laws this weekend.  Since my presence was requested at such short notice I insisted that one night was enough and two was too much with my uni workload.  But then with 24 hours notice I am expected to sacrifice my whole weekend and go down to their place from work today (Friday).  I kind of flipped out at this point and said, 'I CAN'T DO THAT!!!!  I have TOO much work to get done for college!!!'.  And so here I am.  Hubby didn't go either as he has an appalling sore throat and cough.  Please don't let him give it to me!  I had better go and administer some more TLC - then read a chapter of my clinical chemistry text book. :(

So to summarise, I have very little time available to spend on-line AND I am getting grizzled at by hubby every time I go on the net.  Just in case anyone wonders where I am!"

"event","That's what my husband told me this morning anyway.  Could have been worse I suppose.  Oh yes, great glory and trumpets - I have actually been married for a whole seven years now.  It doesn't feel like that long  though.  I am going to start a vast roast dinner very soon.  It doesn't quite suit the summer weather, but we haven't had one in ages and since only one of us drinks we'll be pigging out with food instead of over-doing the drink. :)

Today is gloriously sunny and hot, but no going outside for us.  <lj-cut text=latest eye update>We went back to the hospital Thursday and they were disturbed that there has been no improvement in the vision in the injured eye.  Huh?  He'd been told not to expect it to get any better!  It does make you wonder whether these people know what they are doing, but then this is the UK's best eye hospital, so we'll just assume they're competant.  So, we'll be going back next week to see a different consultant for more pupil dilation, followed by large amounts of light shining into eyes.  Mr Isis says it is like having the sun shone into your eyes from an inch away.  And then we get outside with his massively dilated eyes and it is midday with glaring sunshine.  That was like leading a newly blind person around.

He also went to see a solicitor who will represent him in his case against his <i>previous</i> employers that same day.  The word is that if his company accept liability it will be over very soon... if they don't it could take ages.

The killer headaches seem to have pretty much gone away and the eye is beginning to look more 'normal' again, that is it seems to be opened as much as the other one.  The upshot is that this 4mm bit of metal damaged the retina after it entered the eye - he has very little vision in that eye and that's that.  The light sensitivity thing - well, I think it has improved somewhat but he still stays indoors on sunny days like this.  In fact, I realised on Thursday that we hadn't been out of the house together since he had the accident!  I think that he wants to wait and see about the payout from his company before he tries to go back to work.  Unfortunately that will have us in the poor-house very soon.  But I am sure he knows that.  Ho hum.</lj-cut>  

Boooo!  We finished watching the last season of The Sopranos yesterday.  That makes me sad.  It was still as great the second time around though.  Quality drama ages well.  Now we have to wait until next year sometime for the sixth (and final?) series to air.  And of course, we'll have to wait another six months or something for it in England.  I have been zooming ahead with Lost though and watching it without adverts is bliss!

For those of you who have read the Song of Ice and Fire series: have a look at this!  <a href=http://www.georgerrmartin.com/fans.html>Some of GRRM's reader interaction</a>  This is so cute it almost brought a tear to my eye, but then I think that may be because I am starting to feel a teensy bit broody lately."

<b>An Open Letter to the People of America</b>

by Gregor Stronach

 
Dear US Citizens,

I hate to be the one to break it to you, but the recent disaster following Hurricane Katrina has revealed several things wrong with your society. It has a cancer - a gaping, seething wound that you really, really need to see someone about.

Your people are behaving worse than animals. Your government is proving itself to be ineffectual when it comes to looking after its own people. And your citizens have shown brazen stupidity in the face of an oncoming disaster.

Animals? Yes: you're raping, beating, robbing and killing your own people, at a time when you should be banding together to assist those around you. You're making a mockery of the sense of international image that your country purports to exhibit. The moral outrages occurring on a minute to minute basis in New Orleans are a national scandal.

Government? Well ... where do I start? how about with the US Army Engineers, whose job it was to decide what kinds of levies to build around New Orleans? The decision was reached, on the basis of a cost/benefit analysis, to build levies to withstand Force 3 hurricanes - in an area widely known to suffer from those and much worse in the way of weather. How in God's name could it have been decided that, to save money, an entire city would be put at risk? The cost of building better levies cannot have been anywhere near the cost in human life that decision has created, let alone the years of work and effort that will go into trying to get New Orleans back on its feet?

Relief efforts are fucked. It's been days since the levee broke, and the chain of command in terms of rescue has proven itself woefully inadequate. I'm gobsmacked at how disorderly and disorganised it appears to be.

Stupidity? Oh yeah. Again, I make the comparison between the Tsunami and Katrina. Your citizens had days to get ready for this, to leave town and make for higher ground. Yet so many thousands decided to ride the storm out - bars in New Orleans were still serving booze as the Hurricane's winds hit the shoreline. And now, since they've been stranded by this most horrendous occurrence, the people left behind are descending into brutal, animalistic behaviour.

I'm hoping that soon I'll read reports of people doing the right thing, of helping each other and attempting to keep order, rather than smashing windows to steal TVs and shooting, beating and raping each other in the streets.

It's fucking shameful - for a nation's government to put itself on a pedestal as the beacon of all that is right and good in the world, and when things go south, that government and its citizens react like this.

I'm sorry guys - I really am. I know that these people are doing it really tough at the moment, but the facts speak for themselves. the disaster has shown that there are some severe problems within the US - problems that require urgent attention.

Let me know if there's anything I can do to help...

"event","That's a very interesting question, because a) I need it for the flight I am taking in September, and b) it has the wrong surname on it and I need to get it altered asap.  Now, I have lots of 'special hidey holes' for things like ID.  But as I don't recall where it is without looking I don't feel too positive.

I just wasted a whole day of holiday.  I was meant to file all my notes for college (that's three years so far) so I can find stuff when I need it.  Plus, I have this empty four drawer filing cabinet in my study that I haven't put anything in yet.  However I have pretty much got my computer up and running again, loaded all the software I needed again and uploaded a couple of hundred tracks from my own CDs.  I have two problems though: 1) I can't get my anti-viral software to reinstall.  I never had a disc for it, but I managed to log into the McAfee site and it acknowledges that I bought the package in April.  But I can't get the bleedin thing to let me reload it.  Oh well, will have to ring -tomorrow.  2) my freakin' i-pod shuffle - when I plug it in I get a pop-up that says, 'would you like to wipe everything from the i-pod and replace it with stuff from <i>this</i> library?'  I have to say no as I have a fair bit of stuff on the i-pod that I bought from i-tunes and hadn't backed up.  How can I get the stuff off the i-pod and into some kind of file on my laptop?  Confused!!!  Any ideas would be most welcome.  And, yes, I just ordered a memory stick today that will be soley for backing up stuff from my laptop...I learnt my lesson.

So, where is a good place to keep your passport then, folks?  I knew I had a bad feeling about this.  I've done most of my study with no luck.  Although I did just find a really cool swiss army knife that I lost ages ago.  I'm scared now as I found my previous (cancelled) passport in an envelope with all my other 'important' stuff - birth certificate medical card etc.  Where the hell is it?!!! *bangs head on desk*"

"event","I have just returned from the station and will be staying home today.  I was really slow getting ready this morning and couldn't decide what to do.  Stupid me decided to ring work only when I got to the station!  My boss said don't bother coming in.  Usually the idea of getting a sneaky day off would delight me, but I am sat in front of SKY's live news channel and I will probably be doing that for a fair part of the day.

Good job I didn't go since a 'suspect package' has just been found close to Liverpool Street.  Probably just extreme paranoia.  Another 'suspect package' was found near Euston station (closer to where I work) and that turned out to be nothing...

It isn't as if I am going to go back to bed since I only finished 'putting my face on' an hour ago!  I will probably finish my George R R Martin book though.  Apart from that I will probably go food shopping and maybe do a smidgen of housework.  Maybe.

I think I have said everything I want to say about yesterday on ASF.  I don't have the energy to go through it all again.  Only that I just saw someone on the news talking about the casualties admitted to University College London Hospital.  UCLH (five minutes up the road from work) has just undergone a major refurb and now has a really flash shiny glass facade, going up twenty odd floors.  It only opened its new building very recently - just in the nick of time really.  Phew.  

One day I'll really have to learn more about LJ, tags and so on.  I am so electronically lame."

"event","I've done so much revision today that my vision has gone into a permanent version of that squinty thing you do to read magic-eye pictures - I'm seeing 'through' stuff.  Only two days to go until my first exam and I've only covered half the material I wanted to get through.  It's a shame that panic induced hysteria has to set in so soon: I usually hold out until the day of the exam.  

On a much brighter note (although it has been subsumed by my exam stress), my unwelcome house guest has finally departed.  It was surreal to sit in my kitchen on Sunday afternoon and not automatically tense up because I am expecting someone to let themselves into my home any minute.  On finding a LOAD of sugar and coffee in a kitchen cupboard, I asked hubby to fill me in about the impending disaster he'd been panic buying for... It turns out our 'guest' had bought some random stuff before he left.  I didn't know whether to laugh or scream when I was informed that he'd bought us some shower gel to replace the stuff he'd used...Does anyone think that ISN'T taking the piss?  I stooopidly thought that he was buying his own toiletries while he was here.  It just goes to show how different people are, doesn't it?  And what incredibly different sets of moral values people live by.

"event","For the past couple of months I have a member of an online DVD rental company called LOVEFILM.  I have had no problems with them so far and just today I was recommending them to some work colleagues.  My husband and I have been working our way through The Sopranos, since he never watched it on TV and I wanted to see it again from the start.  I just posted the last disc of series one back on Saturday and since we are both really getting into the series I decided to up my LOVEFILM subscription to two discs per month.  How silly of me!

I just looked at my e-mail and they've sent me a mail saying that The Sopranos series three, disc three is on its way to me!  I had to read it about five times until it finally sank in.  Because OBVIOUSLY I had all of series two queued up in front of series three, plus about four films (I thought it might be a good idea to create a buffer between series to prevent errors of this kind DUR!!!).  I have worked out that the disc they say they have sent me was actually at number 13 in my queue.

I know they say that they can't promise to send you discs in the exact order you ask for them, but is this fucked up, or what?  Does it make any sense at all?  Did this decision they made use ANY common sense at all?  If you weren't told otherwise, wouldn't you assume that a person would want to watch a TV series in the correct fucking order?  And of course, they are about as easy to get in touch with as Amazon - it's one big circuitous loop that prevents you from actually venting to anybody that is responsible.  GODDAMMIT!

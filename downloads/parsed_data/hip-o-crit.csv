he ordered tea and didn't drink it, that bitch!
he was good looking and sounded british, but i thought him american.
his (presumed) kid threw spaghetti everywhere.
i hate his 'tude.
i love his celebrity.

"event","him: would you like a bag for ""that""?

me: uh, ya i would you little shit. do you think it's not hard enough coming to grips with the fact that blood and mucus are going to slide out of my body for another thirty years? do you think it's hilarious that i have to stop it from staining all of my clothes by using overpriced, unnatural means? you know buddy, i feel so clean and great about myself when i'm hemmoraging from an area of my body that i pretty much detest! thanks a lot for smurking. LOOK, I'M TRYING to love it! I'M TRYING to love being fertile! but it's pretty fucking hard when i have to act apologetic for being a female. when i have to meekly place a pastel box down on the counter that makes you blush. WHY are you blushing? your mother and your sister and your grandmother and any female you have ever dreamt of touching has done exactly what i am doing.....and WHY is the box PASTEL?! the junk coming out of me certainly isn't.
and in case you were wondering, that haagen dazs is for me. and yes, it's going to make my ass bigger.

him: is the reciept in the bag okay?

me: ya."

"event","dear diary,
i was going to go get terribly intoxicated tonight. it is a thursday night. 
i had to make up some completely bizarre rehearsal story so my dad would 'let me' go out, and then my mom dropped off some fresh clothes at my work for me. which was a lot of trouble.
then i worked. 
following that, i was tired and called jason and he was tired too. we decided to wait until a more ""rational"" time for our binge of depression. well, when's that time gonna be? when my brain has exploded due to lack of pleasure and emotional fulfillment??
WHY AREN'T I A DRUNKEN PILE OF HUMAN WASTE RIGHT NOW?
then, on the bus, i thought about how i would like to go puddle-jumping. and have someone come with me who i knew liked it just as much as i did. everyone at my work has found love.
sleep doesn't even satisfy me anymore. neither does food. or the internet [fuck you, SUCKAS!]
oh! i do like how java jive steve is giving me free coffee everyday now. ever since i took the train with him. i guess THAT alone is 'worth it'.
god bless that tiny tiny man he saves me from a life of destitution and uppers.
yrs.,

my brother is a concerning individual.
he says his body feels like it's acidic inside and he had severe heart pain in class, yet he won't revisit the doctor. he has some tests scheduled for february, but he won't call the hospital back to confirm them. me and my dad are so busy we aren't home during the daytime to do it for him, but this is besides the point. he is 17. he should be capable of making a phone call.
he should also be able to:
-remember his grandmother's birthday and not yell at his family when they fail to remind him
-fold laundry when he removes it from the dryer
-eat dinner (all by HIMSELF! GASP)
-go cut his own goddamn key (he lost his today [surprise surprise, he doesn't have a keychain or anything] and my baba called my work looking for me [i wasn't working] and my friends house and proceeded to demand i go get keys cut for both him and her and said i should be home more often to take care of him)
I AM NOT HIS MOTHER! HE IS 17!

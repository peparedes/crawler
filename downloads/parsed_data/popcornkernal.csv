"event","Yesterday there was rain that made everything good.
Moreso because no one knew it was coming. Well, at least I didn't. I had gone walking to the grocery store in my new excellent summer shirt. It is spaghetti strap and tight and dark colored enough to do away with the want of a bra, and it's very little fabric. It's really low cut, but there is lace that hides the clevage line, and lace on the bottom that makes it cover the belly. But it's TOUGH looking lace. The shirt is the best. Summer is so so hot here in Albuquerque. So hot I want every shirt to be like that one. I was used to Santa Fe; Santa Fe had these perfect summers where it never goes over 89 degrees and it's light and airy and sunny. Albuquerque has these summers where... I don't know. According to our theormostat in the apartment it has been no cooler than 80 degrees inside our apartment the past month, and by nighttime it is closer to 90. And the sun in New Mexico is intense. 

Yesterday I left the house smelly, to ride my bike to a pool and get some sweet relief. When I arrived, even smellier and sweatier... the pool was closed to technical difficulties. The nearest other pool was another 4 miles away from home. My mountain bike and I do a pretty slow 4 miles sometimes, and I hadn't packed a water bottle. So I swung by the co-op, got some almond icecream bon bons, and went home. Went to the yard and sprayed myself with the hose (effective! better than I excpected), took a real shower, and put on my ultimate summer shirt and shorts for a cooled down evening walk to get some popcorn and stop by the discount liquor store. 

While in line at Smith's I heard these people talking. One was a white and the other was native. They seemed like they knew each other, and as the white lady left she asked the native guy to make it rain. I stood there wondering if that comment had annoyed him. I stood thinking about rain dances as he left. While my food was being wrung up one of the store employees came in and said, ""It's raining!""

WHAT!

And you could feel everyone being excited about it. I went out and it was lightly starting to rain. One side of the sky was crazy orange. There was lightening. It was more of that end-of-the-world Albuquerque weather that makes me love this place so much. 

The rain got heavy and fast really quickly. When I left the house my hair was drying from my shower- while in the store it mostly dried and here I was in my most summery shirt and absolutely soaked. Things were hilarious and beautiful. I don't remember the last time it rained here. My smile was big as I walked down the side walk. A guy in a hoodie asked if I had a cigarette. I paused, because a couple months ago I DID buy a pack, but it wasn't with me so I told him sorry, but no. He then said somethingI didn't hear, and I turned around and asked what and he said I looked  pretty. 

Walking down the street variations of that statment can go so many different ways. Infuriatingly vulgar, irrelevantly annoying, and sometimes an okay compliment and with the rain and the happiness everyone felt for the rain it was definitely a skip-to-your-step kind of compliment and I told him thank you and he told me he didn't see how I was dressed like this out here. I told him the rain surprised me and we expressed how great it was that it was here and admired how cool the sky looked and he took a picture of it and I continued on to the the discount liqour store. By this time my flip flops were nothing but slippery slosh under my feet, so I carried them in my hand instead.

Then I had another interaction that which under different circumstances would have angered me. A man in a truck slowed down and asked if I wanted a ride home. But right then, it totally made sense! I was wet as hell and carrying a grocery bag! But I thanked him and told him that home was pretty close by and he friendily drove on. 

So I crossed the street to the liqour store. This was funny, because I stopped in earlier to ask when they closed, wanting to go to the grocery store first. Back then I was freshly showered and looking pretty put together. This time I was as wet as a person can get, and holding a soaking grocery bag full of produce and popcorn. When I walked in one of the employees asked, ""Wait, did you get that wet just getting out of your car?!"" I browsed the store and reminised with an employee about east coast beers that are too expensive to import into New Mexico. I got some Montana beers, and headed home, declining an offer of a garbage bag for my person, as it was far too late to attempt dryness. 

This morning the soil is still wet. I think our tomatoes are very happy."

"event","Gatherings, that is.

I have gone to two of them before. I was less politically minded back then, but not altogether so. More naive, sure. I was still living with my parents. I saw some shit in Ocala, but it seemed avoidable. But my mark could be off. Even though I was recognized and greeted at the following gathering as, ""Naked Girl!!!"" I was less topless. I remember at one point walking through the forest topless, and then my friends and I went off the trail to another camp, where the men started hooting and hollering about my boobs. That was pretty terrible, so I put my bikini top back on and they groaned in protest. That's the only clear memory of anyone being an asshole about my body freedom, and all I had to do was never go to that camp again. Otherwise, some folks joined me in nudity, and we had our own little ""Camp Naked"" which was never really a <i>camp</i> camp. 


This time as I walked through the very crowded gathering I did not have my shirt off. And then I did. Not <i>too</i> many women did, but there were definitely a number of us here and there.

And, shit.

The first thing was not too big a deal for me. I walked by one camp and a guy there is like, ""Cuddle puddle tonight!"" and he looked at me and added, ""free gifts for all topless people!"" and  I raised my eyebrow, but wasn't really bothered. But I did have a sense of foreboding. There's always a disappointing lack of nudity at these things, and not as many topless women as I would expect. So, I wasn't feeling lot of solidarity in naked freedom as I would have liked, and I was walking alone. 

So as I am walking by myself, I go by this camp on the main trail, a camp you <i>have</i> to pass if you're going from one point of the gathering to another, and as I approach one woman is yelling, ""Boobs approaching Nick at Night!"" and I just walked past, with groups sitting around both sides of the trail with my eyes dead set ahead, and as I walk by, a man yells, ""Turn around so I can see your boobs!""

OKAY. I am NOT in the goddamn woods for street harassment. A LOT of people are sitting on the sides of trails asking for stuff when you go by. Of course, sometimes there are people sitting on the sides of the trails <i>giving</i> things, which is really way more like the right idea of Rainbow. But, being harrased as a woman and having people ask me for stuff as I walk by is something I can do in the CITY, thanks.

So, after that man yelled at me I walked a little bit more, and started crying. Then I stopped crying and carried on. In about 10 minutes or so a guy says hi to me and asks how I'm doing and (I lie) and say, ""good.' then he walks by me and says, ""Nice tits.""

Fuck. I ask him, ""Why did you say that to me?""
I think the exchange went something like,  ""I dunno...I thought you would like to hear it?""
and me responding, ""Well I <b>don't</b>."" and whacking him with my water jug. At which point he said, ""Sorry! Calm down!"" and scurried away.

Then I cried again.

Later I walked by the super obnoxious camp (they are kind of obnoxious to everyone, not just me and not just women) again, this time in a shirt, and  as I go walking by avoiding eye contact, I think the same guy asks ""can i see your boobs?"" and that time I stop and responded, to which he acted all indignant (of course) and muttered ""jesus christ"" to which I turned around and yelled, ""jesus christ yourself, you fucking asshole."" And his crew went, ""ooooo!"" and I walked on.

And cried again
And figuring out that I was not comfortable walking around topless there, at a place that is supposed to be about freedom and love, I ditched Rainbow town. Because that is some serious bullshit. Serious. 

Of course most people there are NOT assholes like that, and two really sweet people talked to me when they saw me crying. The thing is, there's no easily found official justice squad, since it's a dis-organization, or whatever they call it. It loosely ends up translating itself to hedonistic pointless anarchy. 

And when I hit that guy, it was theoretically premeditated. After my first bad encounter I thought about violence. I always have the fantasy, when it comes to the harassment of women. And if men there thought that in the nature of doing , ""Hey, whatever ya feel like man, it's rainbow!"" and acted in detrimental ways, then I would do the same. Except I don't consider stranger violence against men who say vulgar things to women detrimental. I think it's good for them. Even if it does nothing more than make them nervous. 

And I wish I had  done more in retribution to the other guy. Direct violence is one idea, but what I feasibly thought about doing was slashing his tent, preferably cutting out boobs shapes in it. But, no knife. So I wanted to throw all his stuff in the creek. But I didn't really know what was his. Ultimate fantasy was trashing his entire camp and leaving a Polaroid of my boobs. But I was unequipped. 


On my way out, a very nice older rainbow man whose camp was way outside the gathering, was very concerned to listen to what had upset me so much in the gathering. He offered their camp and dinner, which is THE SPIRIT OF RAINBOW, and if I had more gear packed with me, and might have taken him up on it. I kinda wish I had even now, but I had already got my mind set to taking a shower and not sleeping in cold conditions. 

And a small list of other things that really offended me on this trip:
-People were selling drugs. You're NOT supposed to sell anything at Rainbow. A hat goes around for monetary donation for stuff that cost money, but you're not supposed to sell a damn thing there.
-Unneutered dogs galore. And running around off leashes.

And things that make me roll my eyes:
-White people with dreadlocks
-Meat being served kitchens
-The focus on  drugs, (Hey, drugs <i>are</i> way cool... but you can forget about peace if you're constantly running around trying to <i>get</i> something)



AND NO I WILL NOT TRADE MY CAMPING CHAIR FOR A GODDAMN ROCK. Unless that one guy is around and I can throw it at his face."

'cause it was funny



When Jessica and I first decided we wanted bubble tea we were cruising down the Ave and saw a bright exciting one we had not seen before, and it's called WOW, so we went in.

As we stand in line we are both looking around. Noticing everyone is kind of shorter than us... a lot of people seem to have not bought anything, but are hanging out anyway.. ""i think we're the oldest ones here"" jessica comments to me

standing there all old and awkwardly... i look at the walls... and then read the ...THE BIBLE VERSE I THE WALL, AND THAT THE INITIALS OF THE BUBBLE TEA PLACE STAND FOR WONDER OF WORSHIP

So we hightailed it out of there, as it had all the makings of a Christian teen hang-out. 


Not that I refused to go to Christian shops. My favorite frozen yogurt place is a Christian place.
But it's not crawling with teenagers (OR christianity) with a perfectly legit other frozen yogurt place across the street










Secondly, that night when I picked Jess up at college, she mentioned a gay boy in her discussion group had accused her of being, ""one flannel shirt away from coming out of the closet"" in front of strangers. 

Jess did not automatically remember the rules of Chess, so had asked me to refresh her on things. So we set up the board and I check out her side to see if everything looks right and....

""Ope, you have two queens.           ... LESBO.""

And then we cracked up laughing.

"event","Yesterday was another Wednesday I almost cried

And it turned out to be a really wonderful evening.



The build up, as it were, involved general financial frustration and ill-fated money-making schemes (more on this later).


Let me list all the bands that played in Seattle this month that I DIDN'T get to see:
Eels
Gogol Bordello
Of Montreal
PeeLander Z

SO, I was very happy to be going out, with Jessica Castelo to see Tim Fite.

I know Tim Fite because of Zekey. When Zeke gets drunk and takes you back to his home... or any place with the internet, he shows you music videos. And he ALWAYS showed Tim Fite. Or as Jessica put it, ""So, EVERYTIME you hung out with Zeke.""

When I listen to Tim Fite's more political songs I think, ""Damn!"" everytime. 
One of his rap songs goes like this:
<i>""but supply and demand, demand that we all be drinkin' it, and the man don't care what you think, as long as you drink when you thinkin' it""</i>

and ALSO OH MY GOD

<i>""makin' god damned sure
that the seeds that we need
aren't the seeds that we grow
and I know there's a master plan for everything you give us
and I know there's a reason why you're preaching forgiveness
it's good for business
it's good for busines""</i>

So yeah. He does different kinds of music, all with a twang in his voice. Lots of song abouts poverty and normal people stuff.


And then when Jessica and I arrived he was already playing. Frantic at the door, doorman asking for $12 and tells us there is 15 minutes left.

So we run to see the stage as a song is ending. Tim Fite does this funny little slide-show, repeat after me thing, AND THEN SAYS, ""THIS IS MY LAST ONE.""

FUCK MY LIFE.

And so... well, the song he played was a very beautiful little sad one of his, ""Away From the Snakes"" 
<i>""Is there a place where I can go
Where the rich don't get richer
And the poor don't get shit on""</i>

and it is just so PRETTY how he sings it.

he had the audience wave their arms around.



So then I was ready to sob. Becuase this was a month of a lot of shows I had been excited to see AND THEN I SAW NONE OF THEM. And I am not getting richer and I just shelled out $12 for a cover. 


Then Jessica is looking at merchandise to send Zeke and I went to get water and when I get back Tim Fite is talking to Jessica and I am so full of pout and thoughts like, ""I wanted to THE MUSIC, not meet a man."" (why do I have such shit thoughts?!)

But then Time Fite was talking to me, and so nice and cute and told me a story about how he chipped his tooth in Canada and tried to get free health-care, but what he thought was a dentist office was a brothel. 



The headlining band sucked and the doorman gave us half our money back (""I would've left too"" he said).
I checked to make sure Tim Fite had a place to stay (he did) and waved goodbye and he said, ""See you soon""

Then Jessica and I got Bubble Tea (my first real time!) and I was obsessed with it.
We played chess upstairs, accidentally staying 30 minutes late.


Then we went back to her place and she fed me chicken and cheesy rice and white wine and I got hazy and we listened to Tim Fite songs and watched videos and read all his little books on his website, and do you know he just puts pretty much all his albums up for free download ?!

The drinking and the friendship and music was really really nice.
It's good to have a friend like Castelo in town."

Of course, Washington state DOES tax the poor. They tax everyone. Sales tax is freakin' 10%, or something appalling like that. The income tax on the wealthy is not going to change that... which gives this whole thing a, ""Oh yeah? We'll get 10% of <i>your</i> income, <i>too</i>!"" Feel to it. 

But maybe that's okay?

Anyway, when I asked the question about revenge, the client I asked, who had attended the city council meeting, said it was because we're strapped for cash.
And if the library is raising the price to print... and the library had to be closed (ALL of them in King county, not just one) for a WEEK earlier this year...well.. ..

Well then, fuck the rich and their desires!


But, wait... Did they have fair warning? Is this going to affect their life planning, like, ""Oops, we wouldn't have bought this house if there was an income tax."" 
Maybe someone has actually done a TON of hard work to make so much frickin' money (yeah right) and it's kind of a drag they get taxed because of it.


The tax is for people who make $200,000 a year. 
$200,000 a year....
I make $23,073 a year 
I work at a homeless shelter that is trying to help people not die and have better lives. 
I get to do things like clean up human shit and stay up all night 4 nights a week and be poor.
The shelter I work for could use extra money, for sure. We don't even have showers.

revenge revenge revenge

But maybe REVENGE is okay. Maybe no one's got the right to go around making that much money like it's nobody's business. Too much suffering for you to not pitch in.  

Your $200,000 is provided from a world that has been racist and cruel and shitty, so now you will be giving it back and it's going into Human Resources

I guess I will vote for it.
I have to wipe up human shit sometimes. 

And maybe I won't think of it as revenge,
but honor. 

To be a more honorable society."

if you were cherie braden's #1 boyfriend in 2006, you did
you took a year, and when there were but a few chapters left you thought, ""what have i done"" and you started over and read the whole thing in two nights 
a fine homeless man spoke of bokononism with you 
and you feel in love with vonnegut again and wanted to make sure to become a cynic 



i had a whirlwind adventure the past couple of days and i got to see brook pridemore in portland
the next day we ate at a chinese buffet 
and that mighty fondness i have for brook pridmore, i am thinking he is part of my <i>karass</i>
though i know you don't always like people in your <i>karass</i> 
but it always is so good to see brook, and i am very glad that we shared a room in some big community house in portland and listened to music and ate food and drove around and disliked portland together and i bought my favorite beers and he stole tea from whole foods

and then the next day i got to drive to the house of castelo is olympia, where jessica adorned me in sweats and pajama pants and put me to nap before i went out to see future islands
i will always have crushes on those boys
and we hugged and they made their music and i got their new cd
jessica's response to my question, ""do you have any floor space for three sweet dudes and a lady"" was, ""ditch the broad""
jessica castelo is so goddamn funny 
she is going to new mexico this summer
isobel is going to virginia
this means i will have TWO friends in the seattle area. TWO.
failure to launch.
i will work on arthur. he acted like he was happy about my friendship before i stopped being his housemate!! 

though also isobel's delightful roommate got my number, so i think we are going to eat pizza and beer on wednesdays 

i hate how you're supposed to get 8 hours of sleep
body, this isn't working out
my travels were full of naps
though i argue that the best travel is

CONCLUSION is, the two days of travel and friends was sooo good and full of love and music in my little heart
have you HEARD the song ""get back"" by brook pridemore? probably not, and that is sad. 
if only there was a mo in portland, and local bands i cared about, and sometimes i would go to portland and see a band that knows my name and spend the night and it would be love love love 

also i have indulged in waaaaay too much social anxiety the past three days. too much!!!"

And I LOVE it.

Today I woke up in a sleeping bag, on a mat on the floor, Jessica was on the couch next to me, and Kelly Levy crawls onto the side of the couch and her boyfriend is still asleep in my bed and my roommate Allison is still asleep in her room (where she sleeps in her closet) and I was chilly so I pulled the hood of my hoodie on while I ate cereal and it felt soooo good.

Plus, Jessica telling my keys are in the basket of my bike outside. Because that's where I often keep them.

Now Jessica has bused back to Olympia and Kelly and Ian are probably on the plane to New Jersey.

Let me tell you about my new house
It's underground.
It's a basement apartment
It is the basement to a two story house, each story being a unit
It is in a row of four large units, all sharing a mostly empty parking lot, all tenants of the same guy, Steve. We share coin operated laundry, and somehow there seem to be few conflicts. Maybe because Allison and I have only done one load of laundry a piece this month. 

Our house is quirky and perfect. I love when the wood splinters a little on my door. It is a home easily chipped, and easily fixed. Pipes are all over the living room ceiling, making zen garden noises when water is used in the house. My own bedroom is full of ceiling pipes and my magnets stick. The ceilings are low and when I pull off a shirt my normal way my hands hit it. I've got a little window in the corner at the head of my bed, which is on the left side of my room when you walk in. I've got a big window a little past the foot of my bed. I have yet to clean the outside, and when I will do I will be swooping into a fence, because when you open this window there is a six inch pit and then an overall two foot wall, all cement, then wood rails around the cement. 

My room is long. The longest part is at the back where the wall keeps going in the left corner as a closet that is a little over two feet wide. Back on the main wall I have my mobile closet. In the other back corner there is a secret door bookcase, which isn't deep enough to hold book, but I've got my NC license plate, some rubber ducks, and lotion on it. When you lift it it reveals the boiler room, which pushes heat from the vent in secret bookcase, making my room a typically warm place. You can walk into the boiler room and it has two lights and works as a good place to store stuff I won't need anytime soon. Above my bed between the two windows is a double door cabinet, where the breaker box to the whole HOUSE is located! What! It has room for me to store my linen. 

Our kitchen! I think the sun is in love with it
We clean it and we don't clean it. It's fun to sweep, because it's small and the kind of floor that LOOKS really clean when you clean it. When you walk out of either bedroom you are in the kitchen. To the right when you step out of my room is a built in pantry nook, which I am in love with. Allison pulled out a couple shelves and put a desk in there, because there is not much counter space otherwise. The microwave is on it right now. The toaster oven stays stashed in the pantry area when not in use. 

We have a gas stove. We have a double sided sink with a functional dish sprayer, with really good water pressure.

The house has no halls. That is a good way to describe it. It has no halls, and doesn't need any halls, because it is too busy being the cutest little rooms you ever saw in a basement apartment. -There is sort of one hallway- but it is in Allison's closet. Her closet has a hallway from one side of it, to the other. I don't know why, but I love the fact that my room is on the left, her room is on the right, but the left side of the house has both of my windows, and then the window in her closet. The hall in her closet is that serious. 

The door to the bathroom is before the pantry, facing my bedroom door. It is very small, the kind of small that made me realize a bathroom rug for the tub would not work, because everyone would step on it with their shoes while they used the john. Or did anything in there. It has built in shelf space, that is open and goes deep. There are four of these cubby holes. We each have one, the third is full of toilet paper, and the bottom is empty. Instead of a bathroom rug we keep a towel on the edge of the tub to rub our feet on when the shower is over. Big mirror over the sink and toilet, so you can wink at yourself when you pee, and check out your bod when you pull back the shower curtain.

When you step from the kitchen to the living room (which is like a doorway without a door, but longer) there is more built in storage space to your right. We have pans and cloth napkins and baking ware and that sort of thing in there.

The carpet in the living room is dirty. It's the kind of buzzcut carpet you will never run your toes through or snuggle in.  There's a couch that came with the place and we have blankets over it. Allison has laid down a carpet in front of the couch that feels like cool clay under my feet. We have a tiny table for dining, with one of my bedsheets as the tablecloth. The tv is on a stand that came with the place across from the couch and next to the door.  On the other side of the door we have a key rack. In the right corner we have this awesome old chair that belonged to Allison's grandma with a really high back, and a bookshelf behind it. Filled with books that belong to both of us. Then there's a closet that comes into the living room, as opposed to sinking in beyond the room. It has a zip line effect, because the rack we had for it was too long.  Then there's another bookshelf between that closet and the couch. 

The entrance way is a mini-cave. We have an outside light.

The walkway between our house and the next has a motion light. And the laundry area is there, too.

I am so in love with it.
And so happy to live with Allision.
Last night when the night was done we marched to Plaid Pantry with her baratone and my snare drum. We played a ditty for the bar Blue Moon, with no commentary, and on a street corner and mumbling man mumbled about us and called us parasites."

I decided if the laptop was to spend the night on my bed, it would be in the middle of the bed and not on top of a pile of anything. 

LAST NIGHT
I put the laptop just a few inches away from myself and fell asleep.

I woke up to the sound of a cat getting ready to hurl.
Before logic and planning kicked in, I grabbed ... I am not SURE what I grabbed, but every sheet, blanket, thing on my comforter, and the comforter were on the ground in the hallway area outside my room when I really woke up. 

And then I was able to realize, that, oh shit, my laptop just got recklessly tossed around, for the second night in a row.

Living at the homeless shelter there was a big donation of ""Love Spell"" and it found its way into our apartment and so all of us beautiful laughing women were always smelling like it.

I miss it so much. And it is something I can't return to, because it is forever changing. Only KC is left now, and she will be gone soon. It feels me with wild sadness, thinking of OUR APARTMENT, because it was so much our's, and soon it won't be anything that is us. KC Hunt first realized it. Paige was leaving and she started taking down the memorabilia. We celebrated ourselves so hard in that apartment. Always yelling ""wooo!"" and loving each other. 

And, it is an apartment that will never be anyone's forever. But it is this thing that is so very much your life while you are there, because it is full of your work. It provides everything. And sometimes it is full of people who don't like each other. That happened after I left! So we really did have something magical.

I now own 3 of the Wet Moon graphic novels, the last episode had arrived yesterday, so I started with that, rolled over to Inga Muscio's ""autobiography of a blue-eyed devil"" which, when I think of my hypothetical list book (which mostly is a list of places to tell my change of address when I move), includes a listing of things to research that I read about in that book. 
Then, I got to the main goal, which is Michelle Tea's ""Rose of No Man's Land"" that I planned on finishing, and I did.

Mo let me borrow it during a drunken book exchange. I feel like I remember how Mo described how it would make me feel, but not sure what any of our exact words were... but it was something like Not.Good. and not fired up, but sad. It is a sad sad book that does kind of make me want to cry, and I think the reason I turned the computer on this morning was... to somehow find a way for the book to not be over, because I want more for the character, but you read the book and it's like, there's NOT more for the main character, and you know that's just how it is.




Once upon a time Dave and I were at Wal-Mart, getting discount valentines candy at midnight. And I saw THE BEST VALENTINE EVER
It was a piece of chocolate wrapped in foil shaped like a fish, in the box like it was mounted, and the term of endearment was, ""You're a Keeper!"" and it made me wish I had someone to give it to, JUST for the sake of giving someone THAT.



Reney and I don't usually have whole days off together (or actually, never) but we both had presidents day off. So we had our fish-themed date day!
Which involved going to the aquarium where we probably spent more time looking at mammals than fish, and ohmigod I love otters!!! Freakin', furry water ballerinas. The octopus was so amazing too... smaller than what I expected, which I guess I should blame Hollywood for? His name is Captain and I wanted to be his friend. He recently did-it with a female octopus named BUSTER. Who is released now, and will die soon after laying her eggs.

Then we went to a seafood restaurant and ate really good food and it was happy hour, so we got to get cheap finger foods, and split a plate of menu food for a reasonable price. It's all about timing... and sharing. 

We had stopped at Ballard Market for beer AND THEY HAVE GOLDEN MONKEY NOW, OH GOD. My favorite beer.

But then we were looking at the discount valentines candy AND THERE WAS THE FISH.

So I yelled at her to not look at that area of the display and then I went to go buy it and then I GOT TO GIVE MY GIRLFRIEND THE FISH VALENTINE, who has lived in my mind since I saw it back in college, forever when ago.


And then I laid in bed, drinking a Golden Monkey and reading a Wet Moon book while she used the internet, then she rubbed my feet, and I got buzzed and she had a beer and then we watched SNL commercials until it was time for our $3 dollar movie, which was ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" which I like more and more the more I think about it.

And then when we got home I realized FISH VALENTINE ON FISH THEMED DATE DAY
It's all pretty good"

"event","well... i've got a boyfriend. nothing new, but lately it seems like that's ALL i've got. sure i've got the kinda ""friends"" i'm really cool with and talk to at school, but isn't a REAL friend, by definition, someone you regularly hang out with and talk to and genuinely like and would trust with your life? well a few people fill the last 2 requirements, but no one fills the first 2. it seems as if i've become one of those people that someone only talks to when they have to. and i'm sure that's not the case, people are busy and whatnot, but i can't help feeling left behind and forgotten. normally i don't mind so much, but when its by people i'd like to call my friends it kinda hurts. i guess i'm done whining."

"event","well xanga's down. maybe i oughta just move from there to here. no one reads my shit there either so its not important where i write. nor do i have much to say that matters to anyone but me, so it seems a logical choice. i wish it was summer again. i had a life this summer, and it was cool. i feel like i've fallen out of touch with the decent people i used to talk to often. and i've become so irritated with people in general lately that its hard to really be okay with any new friends. though i suppose i shouldn't be so close-minded. som epeople are cool, and with my current attitude i'll never notice them if i happen to come across any. *pfft* what a dilemma.

on a brighter note... i have rainbow nerds! but my ocd combined with excessive pickiness caused me to pick out all the pink ones in the box and i'm in the process of eating them first cuz they're my least favorite. why can't i be this compulsive about a tidy room? 

i really want another job. not quit the one i have.... just get another one. cuz as it is i'm only getting a max of 10 hours a week unless i'm on break from school and at 6.50 an hour thats not much pay. on top of college expenses i plan on incurring sometime soon.... theres so much stuff i want. almost need. none of my old work clothes really fit me from the summer cuz i guess i've put on pudge (which in itself makes me unhappy), so i need to buy new clothes. but when i get the money and do so i can use that as a write-off. i need a haircut, bad. wanna dye it again too.... roots are comin through pretty bad. i'm debating changing the color but i really like this one. eh.. i'll see i suppose. i want new shoes too... both work shoes and regular shoes. my boots are small, and my two other pairs are quite impractical (tho i must say i do love my fuck-me pumps). so i want some comfortable heels and a pair of combat boots cuz that'd be hot with my slutty little bitty camo skirt. my lakais are gettin pretty worn out, but they've got a few months in em. i'd love green contacts, but thats just a frivolous thing i'd like to get someday and not quite neccessary. 

i sound like such a self-absorbed girly lil bitch. ridiculous. oh well.

sometimes i wish everyone could just stop acting so fucking stupid. stupidity is the base of all humankind's problems. if it could just be eliminated from the gene pool the world would be alright. that and selfishness... but i suppose thats just a branch of stupidity. and people wonder why there's war in the world. its cuz fuckin dumbasses can't just leave everyone alone and quit tryin to conform everybody into one standard. diversity is what makes people beautiful, not only physically but on the inside too. different beliefs, philosophies, and cultures make the world an interesting place to be. imagine how boring it would be if everyone was just like you? it seems to me that the basis of every major war is conformity. then again thats just me, and i could be wrong. even on a more domestic level, stupidity and selfishness reign. take, for example, my neighbor. the guy claims to me such a good neighborly christian man, yet sits on his ass while we shovel our driveway after that ruthless snow we had. now i don't expect him to get up and help... guy's only got one leg.... but, gee, thanks for lettin us borrow your snowblower mr. kind cristian man! its not so much that i have a problem with christianity... believing in something is cool if it keeps ya goin in life. its the people who follow that religion. go to church on sundays, pray to their god, say they love thy neighbor and such, then gohome for the rest of the week and do exactly the opposite of what they preach for one hour a week. true christians are cool, i've known one or two. the kind that truly follow their religion without taking it to extremes. the kind taht are nice to everyone and help people out. they're cool. i just haven't met one in a long fuckin time. i think i'm finished before i say some things that aren't too nice.

     Haha, shes probably going to yell at me for this but... THATS MY WHORE! 
     We spent all weekend together and even got married... despite what Shad thinks, Although, Im not quite sure if he knows. Hmmm...
**Friday** 
     Went to teen night. SO gay. Alotta shit went down and so I wanted to leave. Dom, Katie and Greg came home with me. We went on a walk later in the night but Katie and Greg parted from me and Dom to get more ""touchy""... haha, rotten fish garbage cans!! So they stayed the night and watched the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre... Sadly I fell asleep in the begining and dont have the guts to watch it myself.
**Saturday** 
     So we wook up and made plans to go to Doms but Katie is a slut and couldent go due to lack of time. So I went and Dom and I did stuff. Yes, S T U F F! And by th way Wheel of Fortune ROCKS! So I stayed the night and we did more stuff.
**Sunday** 
     Went to her go kart racing. What a whore.

Today was just an amazing day. I wouldent have changed anything about it. I am a little frustrated with home-life at the moment that this is going to be quite a angry entry... I told myself and other people I wouldent end up like ""her"". I dont want to, who would? In some ways I feel like I am turning into her. All though she is my very best friend I disagree with alot of things she does, no one is perfect and I am not going to stop being friends with her because 1 or 2 people dont like her. She has taught me this lesson that I am not going to lie to the ones I care about. Alot of you people who read this but cant comment because your not an LJer (:-p) have been wondering whi ""I <3 YOU"" is for.. It was ment to be there for Sam. I started putting it there because Sam has shown me what it is like to be liked/loved (whatever word you all perfer)... hes been an awsome friend and always there for me, I couldent ask for anything more. It's just the drama these days and past relationships that make me not want to be in this.. Dont get me wrong I think being with him would be perfect because he is too sweet to ever hurt me but I wish I could be the same, seeing as how I am probably hurting him from writing this.. Im sorry I couldent be as good a friend to him as he could to me but being with him makes me think of someone eles and it hurts so much and even if I pretend that the feelings arent there they will be... theres nothing I can say.

Heh, I'd do anything for that kid. So we got to Seattles Best coffee or whatever... too bad their coffee sucks! And thn he picked us up... it was loads of fun. Then we went to teen night and pointlessly froze our asses off... I bet we would have alot more fun there if we were high... drugs are bad though. So we went home early... oh well!

Today...
Nikki came over and we went starbucks... I love that place. So we went job hunting... hehe we got applications for Safeway Bartell Drugs and QFC... fun fun. We also took a bus to Seattle... Some wiered Chris dude was tere and he talked about his dog... His natve name is Spirit Wolf... haha. Ok then. So we saw Mitch on the way and he gave us 5 dollars because we were REALLY hungry! We bought 2 bags of cheetos, a diet coke and a leaf for a dollar from some kid working at QFC... So we decided to go to Robin Hood Lanes to see Sam but he couldent really talk... stupid people :-p...

Anyways, after playing about one million games of Skipbo Jen and I
decided to walk to Jessicas and see if she was home because she wasnt
answering her phone. Oddly she was home, we will never know :-\... So
we were fucking starving, we walked to Dennys. Now I have to say people can be so rude and discusting sometimes. These 3 guys who I am guessing were drunk walked in the resturant sometime after we did and were trying to be seated, wanted to sit in the booth behind ours. The guy who was seating them (who was earlier flirting with us) kept finding excuses to not let them sit there. So the 3
guys were literally all the way across the room. They started barking, whistling and strangley making sheep sounds which I did not know was a way to hiton someone. So one of the guys who was sitting over there screamed ""hey girls wanna come home with us!?"" and after Jen said ""umm... no"" they came up with ""good because we didnt 
want you to""... Then why the hell did you ask. Retards.. sheesh...

Anyways it was fun... Hey the  waitress even flirted with Jen so much we didnt have to pay for our  drinks... Damn we are special!

Yup well, Jens a nanny and has the little kid she watches coming over at  8 in the morning and it is now 4... I am never gunna sleep. *Sigh*


Jen and I are going to try and get the web cam working tomorrow, so maybe we will have pictures for all you sick fucks.

Well I am about to watch TV because I am not tiered enough to go to bed and no one is talking to me so peace out fuckers.

they are tiered of it and so am I. You can be 
my best friend but you cant go and do this shit
to every guy that crosses your oath or even 
takes teh time to wave and say hi to your nasty
ass! So just break up with him and go out with 
the fucking ass hole because you both are perfect
together!!"

I lie on the ground,
and stare into space,
the stars start to move,
into the shape of your face.
I see you there now,
looking down at me,
with that cute little smile,
that I like to see.
You say ""close your eyes""
""tell me what you see""
I see only two people,
just you and me.
We're walking the shoreline,
with our feet getting wet,
the horizon turns pink,
as the sun starts to set.
We make love through the night,
on that white sandy shore,
then I hold you while thinking,
I could want nothing more.
Oh I wish I could be
in that one special place,
as I lie on the ground,
and I stare into space...


I CAN DO THE HELICOPTER WITH MY PONY TAIL!"

to tell the truth, im not very ANYTHING anymore. 
It's like I cant do anything. I hate it. I cant 
eat my pizza and I cant drink my diet pepsi... I 
cant look at myself and the only time I can hear 
myself think is when I type it all out in this 
journal... I dont even think this entry is making 
much sence... The friends I have all think I am 
being dramatic for no fucking reason but they just
dont understand. None of them see it the way I do.
They dont have a phycotic dad... They dont have to
be me EVERYDAY... Everyone like Nikki and Kayla, 
they are all happy... They have boyfriends and shit
loads of friends to care for them and Im too scared 
to get in that shit. I dont know if it would make 
me any happier and at the moment I dont really feel 
like bringing someone eles down with me. I guess I
should probably just take it one day at a time, 
whatever happens, happens. And it does for a reason.

"event","Wow, This is shitty. I might be suspended. All because some bitch had to give me enough shit to make me so angry I turned around and punched her. I swear if Mr.Webster hadent came out to stop me she would have gotten the full down beating. I swear if someone tells you to leave them the fuck alone dont you think you would get it!? 

Anyways, I am really confused. About guys and such. Like, I only like 1 person... But I dont know. Like I want to go out with him btu I dont. And I dont want to sound like a bitch and tell him I dont want a boyfriend because thats happened to him before and she turned around and went out with someone eles... But I would never do that to him... I just dont know if he would believe it. 

Theres the lesson for life. Shitty stuff happenes. And when it happenes to us we tend to make it harder for ourselfs to trust... I dont want him to nit trust me. :(..

This ones for Nikki ::Yum Yum & Bam Bam::"

Everything you said you wanted is right here waiting for the right time ever tormenting me to my very soul. It's thicker than water holding me down. The more I struggle the harder it is to hold on."

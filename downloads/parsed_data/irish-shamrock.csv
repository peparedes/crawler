I realised i haven't made a post in about 18 months which is sad! Everything is going well; i graduated from Uni with my undergrad, worked for a year in recruitment (ok that sucked) and now i'm back at Uni doing a Masters in Marketing which is great.

Hallam was in Dublin this weekend so i got to see her for a while which was great but it made me realise how awful i've been at staying in touch with people and how much i miss my friends overseas...

"event","So this a random 'this is what i've done for the past few days' update:

On Wednesday i went to Cork to visit one of my best friends who lives there, we chilled out, got very drunk, went shopping, had dinner and had a crazy kareoke evening - seeing a really tall muscley hard man do a sincere rendition of East 17's ""Stay Another Day"" will definately change your opinion of him and make you laugh!!

Then back to Dublin and a night of pizza, beer and DVD's with Matthew who tried to take over my bed (you evil man you)!

Saturday I got up ridiculously early and spent the whole day driving around trying to sort out stuff for the party next weekend, I spent ages in Tesco getting platters and bowls etc (which were ridiculously cheap i might add), a gazebo to shelter all of my smoking buddies (because there is no smoking in my house) in case it rains, and then got drawn to the tiki torches (camp reminiscent moment) which were uber cheap so i got some of those as well. Then i went to Lidl and bought stupid amounts of party food like chips'n'dip and gummy bear-type food! One moment to bitch about Lidl:

THIS IS THE 21ST CENTURY - WHO THE HELL DOESN'T TAKE CREDIT CARDS??????

Anyway then i went to the Party Warehouse for decorations and they were out of everything, i mean EVERYTHING! No happy 21st birthday banners, no balloons (no 21st ones, no happy birthday ones, not even plain ones), no party poppers, no streamers, NOTHING!!!!! If i had been throwing a St. Patricks day party 2 weeks late however i would have been in business, WTF???

This morning i finished sending invites to people, so all that's left to do now is wait for the builders to finish (the party is their deadline and they're pretty much done), get the new room painted (which my Mam is doing during the week), clear the garden (which will be done by the builders when they finish combined with my Dad who has taken this Thursday, Friday and Saturday off to help finish off the house) and i've to get booze and the hot food for the party (enter Matthew's access to a wholesale discount at Musgraves) and i think we're all set!!

A reminder for anyone who feels the urge to hop on a last minute flight!?! LOL"

As soon as my exams are over I start as a trainee recruitment consultant with a company here in Dublin! This is great for 2 reasons: 

1) the obvious perks of employment here in Dublin such as money and not having to move

but also

2) they're totally fine with me pissing off to Australia for 3 weeks to see my sis this summer, so i finally get to see her after our 2 year long estrangment!!!



And i also got my first 21st birthday card & prezzie in the mail from Firefly which made me insanely happy (yay and thank you much m'dear, Jeremiah was indeed a Bullfrog ;-))

I think that's quite enough news to be going on with for now!!"

It's the most depressing thing to be asked especially when these people who are in realtionships and have been for like 2 years and stuff turn round and in a really condescending way (even if they dont mean to be) ask you that. 


Reminds me of that scene in Bridget Jones when she's stuck with all those couples and they keep telling her she should hurry up and get 'sprogged up' like it's her fault or something.

"event","So my evil tonsils swelled up like no other this week, i wasn't exactly very sick, they just hurt. But that's typical because i had an horrible economics mid-term to do so of course i had to be sick! Anyway i got through my mid-term on thursday, not too sure how i did because of stupid negative marking but we shall see.

Then on friday i was woken up by my phone - some guy from the HR department of a company i'd applied to for a job. He basically told me ""we're interested but need someone to start right away, call us when you graduate"". So this in itself was positive because all i've gotten so far were comments of ""Sorry you haven't got enough experience"".

Then my Mam came home for lunch and i'm in the middle of telling her how i finally got some vaguely positive feedback when my phone rings again. This time it's a woman from a recruitment and HR outsourcing company acting on behalf of a company i'd applied to. But she's actually calling me to come in for an interview.

So lets be realistic here; it's extremely unlikely that i'll get this job but it's nice that someone is finally showing some interest in me and it's good to get the interview experience so I can't go wrong.

Now a whole bunch of mid-term projects need to be finished, so my morning is already planned for me!"

Valentines Day is a horrible day designed to stress out people who have someone because they're trying to make the day special and romantic, and depress people who have no one because you're reminded once again that you're alone.

If you have someone and want to be romantic just be romantic, you don't need a stupid hallmark excuse to do it, and if you're alone you don't need a reminder!

I don't know if it's the same virus thing or if it's something new but either way: my immune system is totally letting me down!"

Anyway, I think I may have sort of come up with a plan for the next period of my life:

I finish college for good at the end of May and I was hoping to get into a graduate program but it seems that no one wants me as I have very little practical experience. So I think for the month of June/start of July I'm going to get a boring job for the sake of it job, my friend's pretty sure she can get me a job where she works, if not I can probably go back to Claire's (it's only 4-6 weeks). 

Then i'm hopefully going to go to take advantage of my parents idea for a 21st Birthday Prezzie; a trip to Australia with them to visit my sister since I haven't seen her in over 18 months and I miss her like crazy, they'll be going for 3 weeks-ish but I may stay longer depending on money, potential jobs etc...

Then hopefully i'll be able to get a basic entry level job in my related field to get some experience then the following year try for another graduate program or maybe a masters. I've realised I may have to move to London though since I can't seem to get anything in Dublin, but i'm actually kinda happy about that, since i'm so fed up of this town and can't wait to get out. But at least London is close enough to home that I don't feel a million miles away...


Variations on this plan include 
- Me managing to get a proper job starting in June and not ending up going to OZ at all, though that would suck. 
- Me getting a proper job starting in June and managing to get 2 or 3 weeks off to visit my sis, which would be a good compromise.
- Me not managing to get a proper job and being stuck working in Claire's for life (god help me)
- Something unforeseen happening and me ending up doing something completely unprecedented...

This whole becoming a grown-up thing sucks!"

"event","Haha, my new years night was so incredibly messed up! 

I started off in 1 bar with the new boy and a couple of my friends but i didn't know very many people there so i went on to a different bar where my friends were. But of course in doing this i found myself in the same pub as Richie, who in his drunken state decided to wish me Happy New Year a grand total of 11 times! 

Every time i see him out now he tries to have these indepth meaningful convos with me, it's really getting tiresome! Then afterward we went to a party and i met up with the boy again, which was when Richie found out about it and became very unintentionally obnoxious and well HIM!

Then my other ex's ex girlfriend decided she was hooking up with Richie in some weird kind of revenge type thing which he went along with out of jealousy, but then discarded her completely when he realised i couldn't care less! Shitty behaviour on his part but all very comical to watch!

Anyways my boy ended up really really drunk which i wasn't too impressed with but in saying that, despite his drunken slightly irritating state he was still being really sweet. So i'm over-looking it, because well everyone has their drunken moments and new years is definatly one of those nights when it's vaguely acceptable!

My 14 year old cousin who i've spoken to all of maybe 4 times ever arrives today for a 3 day visit during which i'm supposed to entertain her, this should be fun!"

But i got talking to a guy who's a friend of a friend and we just hit it off, i think i actually found myself a nice guy! 

He's a good-looking, nice normal guy with no severe emotional problems, no girlfriend and is actually interested in me. Kind of seems too good to be true, but i'm giving it the benefit of the doubt!"

"event","Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to all!

So far this Christmas has actually been really good, spent Xmas eve hanging out with my Dad, we went shopping and then he gave me my first driving lesson on the spur of the moment (which was funny because it was in his car rather then the one i'll actually be insured on and he drives a 5.4l v12 automatic lol) then went out Xmas eve and got a little tipsey but all my friends who are away at Uni and stuff are home so it was really nice. 

Xmas morning we rang my sis in Sydney then exchanged gifts and for once my parents actually got me stuff i like and may even use, very impressed with them this year. 

Then i went to visit my friend for an hr, which was followed by a fabulous Christmas dinner, my mother definately outdid herself this year. 

Now i'm finishing tidying my room so that it's fit to be seen by people because my friend Paul is coming over in while to watch cheesy movies and get drunk, definately close to one of my best adult Xmas's ever (nothing beats the excitement when Santa was still around).

I hope everyone else is enjoying their festive celebrations too, yay!"

I have NEVER had to work as hard as i did for like the last month, it was horrible, i barely had time to do stuff like shower and sleep, never mind have any semblance of a social life, just plain nasty! 

This also means that unfortunately those xmas cards i tried so hard to send never got done :( sorry guys but my finals kinda took priority.... It was half of my degree and all...

So now it's time to sit back, relax, let my hair down and enjoy Christmas, tiz time to get very drunk, eat way too much food and fall asleep to cheesy xmas movies.

Let the good times roll!"

<P><FONT color=#000000>Anyways, yesterday was a long day, but it really was a lot of fun. So <FONT color=#3366ff>Prateesh</FONT> decided that we needed to be at his house at 10, got there at like 10:30, no one was there, and he hadn't even showered. yea, so was sleeping in his bed then <FONT color=#3366ff>M</FONT><FONT color=#3366ff>anisha</FONT> decides to&nbsp;wake me up when she got there*like an hour later! with <FONT color=#3366ff>Richa</FONT> and <FONT color=#3366ff>Niket</FONT>*&nbsp;by hitting my ass as hard as possible. Well we sat in his room and made it smell like nail polish till <FONT color=#3366ff>Sunny </FONT>and <FONT color=#3366ff>Karan</FONT> got there. The funniest thing was when <FONT color=#3366ff>Prat</FONT> decided to stand up on the fireplace and broke the ledge off. As bad as i felt it was really funny. And he tries to blame it on me cuz i was on it first, at least i wasn't standing on the ledge! <FONT color=#3366ff>Beant</FONT> stopped by for a lil bit too, to get his part. Things just kept getting added to <FONT color=#3366ff>Richa's </FONT>""needed"" list. <FONT color=#3366ff>Sunny</FONT> and <FONT color=#3366ff>Karan </FONT>got hair cuts and looked sooo kyoote. I was deff laughing at like every little thing tho...not quite sure why. i went home a lil later and did the whole getting ready thing. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>Then it was time for the <STRONG>PARTY</STRONG>. it started out with the usual snacks. Some people did dances.&nbsp;<FONT color=#3366ff>Beant </FONT>and <FONT color=#3366ff>Deep</FONT> had a kickass bhangra dance. <FONT color=#3366ff>Me</FONT> and <FONT color=#3366ff>Richa</FONT> danced too. There was a slide show that his brother,&nbsp;<FONT color=#3366ff>Sanjay,</FONT>&nbsp;made that so was sooo cute!<FONT color=#000000>&nbsp;He definitely </FONT>did ""buck"" on him in it.*spending so much time with these boys really does get&nbsp;you talking like them*&nbsp;Then our skits, which i think came out well too. It was funny :) Then of course, open dance...'nuff said. :) That was the best! im surprised my legs aren't in pain today. especially since we did *dhol baje* twice. *<FONT color=#3366ff>Chris</FONT> i'll be sure to teach you that step&nbsp;before the next big party :P*&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P>Today is gonna be the first day in like a week that i don't see any of these *ugly* kids. Just spending the day with my dad, and out to dinner later. But we already have plans for tuesday night...PARTYYYYY!! woohooo. haha</P>
<P>Well one week of summer is ALREADY gone...gotta make the best of the rest...:)</P></FONT>
<P>leave love...make me laugh</P>"

Most of <FONT color=#3366ff>Aneesh's</FONT> grad skit came along afterwards. <FONT color=#3366ff>Prateesh</FONT> left for Beach week, and the rest of us went to <FONT color=#3366ff>Richa's</FONT> and just hung out. <FONT color=#3366ff>Karan</FONT> and <FONT color=#3366ff>Niket</FONT> were ""watching"" The Last Samuri...ALONE. who knows what they were doing. haha just kidding. We had some interesting conversations on the phone with some <FONT color=#3366ff>drunk kids</FONT>...only if i could have taped him :) The boys left around 11 and i stayed the night. Everyone came over to my house thursday...and yesterday we went <FONT color=#3366ff>Manisha's</FONT> except <FONT color=#3366ff>Karan and Sunny </FONT>cuz they had something at VCU. <FONT color=#3366ff>Aimee</FONT> took us to get slurpees!!! wooohooooo. i love that girl. Later was <FONT color=#3366ff>Niket's</FONT> surprise 16th brithday party. <STRONG>HE HAD NOOOOOO CLUE!</STRONG> his reaction was great! he looked sooo kyoote all dressed up...hehe. so his party was like a pre-party for tonight:) i'll be sure to let you all know what goes down. i only got like 6 hours of sleep and right now im heading to <FONT color=#3366ff>Prateesh's</FONT> so we can get these skits down.

"event","Its the first day of summer vacation...and it <b>MOST DEFINITELY</b> hasn't hit me yet. i didn't get to sleep in today, because i went to York's graduation. i don't think i've ever laughed so much that early in the morning as i did on the way up to William and Mary. ""<FONT color=#3366ff>Prateesh </FONT><FONT color=#330033> you are ugly, stupid, and an idiot. that is a bad combination. why are you so green maaaan?"" Anyways, i wasn't even graduating and i was nerve wreck cuz <FONT color=#3366ff>Aneesh</FONT><FONT color=#330033>didn't get there till 5 minutes before his name was called! The things his parents did for him to make sure he got to his graduation since his flight got canceled! :) At least he still got to make his valedictorian speech, and it was good mr. harvard. After wards we went back to <FONT color=#3366ff>Richa's </FONT><FONT color=#330033> house and just chylled. Then i went shopping with <FONT color=#3366ff>my parents </FONT><FONT color=#330033>for a lil bit *oh how much i love me some shopping!* came home, had dinner then Richa came over to my house. she just left, and im extremely tired and going to bed now.

A mere redneck mob mentality, based on fear, violence and xenophobia; us against those not-like-us. It is difficult to find a people who can have that unusual intellectual integrity, those relatively rare people who can change their minds when the evidence demands it.

I'm sorry folks, I'm just raving, as usual. Guess the idea that all that history could be destroyed in one mad moment of illogic is irking me."

"event","Oh sure. Nearly get immolated by the notorious underground coal fire, and all we take away from it? (Well, all D'Namouh managed to take away from it; I was busily dirtying my drawers in sheer terror at the possibility I was about to burn to death). Project Blue Book. Debunked, of course, by an excuse so flimsy you couldn't even wipe your ass with it. Hope they at least used two ply paper to write this garbage on. <lj-cut>

I'm not gonna bore you with the details. You don't care, obviously. But on January 14, 1953 a group of upper echelon scientists, handpicked by the CIA and dubbed the Robertson Panel convened in order to make a final say on the increase of public interest in the UFO sightings over Area 51.

(7 years later, January 14, 1970 was also the day Mets GM Johnny Murphy passed on to that big diamond on the sky, but for now? We'll assume this <i>wasn't</i> the fault of the Syndicate.

For now.)

In their final report, they stressed that low-grade, unverifiable UFO reports were overloading intelligence channels, with the risk of missing a genuine conventional threat to the U.S. Therefore, they recommended the Air Force de-emphasize the subject of UFOs and embark on a debunking campaign to lessen public interest. They suggested debunkery through the mass media, including The Walt <i>Disney</i> Company, and using psychologists, astronomers, and celebrities to ridicule the phenomenon and put forward prosaic explanations.

That's right, Virginia. There is no Santa Claus. There are no little green men, either.

We have met the enemy, and he is beaming into your living rooms every evening at 7, warming the cockles of your little kids' hearts. 

We have met the enemy, and he has big eyes, and clean white gloves, a penchant for avoiding wearing <i>pants</i>.  

And while we're on the topic of brainwashing and killing the children in the best interests of God, McCarthy and the American dream... hey, D'Nammy. Here's a file we both missed. Pretty interesting stuff.

November 22, 1991
I regret to inform the court of the unexpected passing of Mr. Sullivan, who died
by his own hand last night in his cell. The incredible violence of his demise is currently under independent investigation. Passersby were amazed by the unusually large amounts of blood. Mr. Sullivan, who was under my care, showed signs of a seriously declining mental state, lapsing into a pre-catatonia between periods of intense psychotic episodes. His death, while alarming, is not at all uncommon in this type of mental breakdown. The extent of Mr. Sullivan's illness cannot be understated. He was completely mentally isolated from reality, living in a nightmarish world of his own creation. It is the assessment of this doctor that Mr. Sullivan was utterly unfit for trial, and furthermore, it is quite extraordinary that a man suffering from such extensive mental illness was even able to appear even marginally sane, let alone function independently in society. I would call into question the investigative techniques of the Ashfield Police Department, if not for the
independently verified reports of Mr. Sullivan's lucidity in the weeks prior to his incarceration. Had this testimony not come forth, I would caution the court that Mr. Sullivan's case fits the textbook description of pinning a crime on a mental defective in order to have it off a precinct's rap sheet. I feel ill at ease about this case, as I have never, in all my years of study and practice, come across so rapid a decline in mental fitness. It is a disturbing anomaly in the annals of psychiatry, and I have forwarded this case to the American Psychological Association for review. I would recommend the court strike the testimony of Mr. Walter Sullivan on the basis of his highly fractured mental state and deep psychosis. He cannot be held responsible for his 
actions, or be used as a reliable source of testimony on the actions of others.

Attached for review are the most recent notes taken while assessing the patient.

Poor little Walter. Little late to get him flowers, you think? Wonder if he had TV in there on his last night as a mortal man? November 11 was also the day Atlanta Braves third baseman Terry Pendleton, who hit .319 with 22 home runs and 86 RBI, won the National League MVP Award. Still. I guess Walter had more pressing matters, like a date with a sharpened <i>spoon</i>.

But...Project Oxcart? Give me a break. Or at least let ME testdrive one of these SR-71 Blackbird things. Have you seen it?? Any lover of fast vehicles will take one look at those designs and declare it utterly awesome and smokin' hot. 

More useless trivia: the airplane is constructed entirely of titanium, in order to withstand the intense heat of friction that it experiences, and to provide the structural strength necessary to handle the immense stresses of hitting turbulence while travelling literally faster than a speeding bullet. The titanium skin expanding causes the aircraft to 'grow' 11 inches while in flight. The continued process of heating and cooling the titanium is akin to annealing, and means that the SR-71 lands with its outer skin in better condition than when it took off. 

Gorgeous fuckin' piece of machinery. 

<i>Take these broken wings and learn to flyyyy</i>

But a UFO? it is not.

I have chased truth to the exclusion of all else; risked and sacrificed everything I held dear. My career, my life; those I loved; all casualties in the pursuit of some inexplicable explanation, a tangled web whose ephemeral strands I've sought to grasp without thought to the cost or the consequence.

I have been ridiculed, debunked, devalued in ways that would make Jesus himself weep. I have crawled... am crawling still, actually. My life, my work, my career... all of it, deep sixed to this forgotten burg, this hotbed of paranormal activity, this shit-stinking hellhole manned by kind of gods that crawl out of the rubble of a shattered place, full of shadow and sadness and obsession. 

Open your eyes. Become bigger. It hasn't killed you, and it's making you stronger."

Between the ionosphere and the earth's surface, there is a constant resonance is called the Shuman Resonance and exists at a frequency of 8hz in the ELF band range. It is impossible to quantify the effect that this may have on humans. 

However, the population on earth is rapidly approaching the number of neurons in the brain. Douglas Rushkoff proposes that the consciousness of the earth may be awakened when all creatures of the earth become connected and resonate at the same frequency. The evolution of this network would then follow a neural model - a single network connected by synapses."

"event","LONDON, England (Jan. 9) -- Britain's accident prone ""Octopus UFO"" is just one of hundreds of unexplained sightings in the same area where a wind turbine was wrecked over the weekend, according to the latest reports.<lj-cut>
Britain's tabloid Sun newspaper Thursday proclaimed from its front page that a wind turbine was ruined after a UFO hit one of its 20 meter-long blades in Conisholme, Lincolnshire.

It quoted residents who saw strange balls of lights in the sky and heard a loud bang.
However, another British national newspaper said the lights were just fireworks from a staff member's dad's birthday celebration.
Turbine experts suggested it was a simple mechanical failure.
The plot thickened further Friday, with The Sun saying it had been ""bombarded"" with reports of UFO sightings from hundreds of witnesses in the area where the turbine was destroyed. Watch video on the UFO incident Video
""There have been reports of flying saucers for more than six months,"" the newspaper said.
Local John Harrison, 32, told The Sun he looked out of his window and saw ""a massive ball of light with tentacles going right down to the ground.""
The newspaper said ""other respected witnesses, such as local council chairman Robert Palmer and GP Jenny Watson, described seeing 'streaking white lights'.""

Quoting unnamed Ministry of Defense ""insiders,"" The Sun said the UFO sightings may be an unmanned stealth bomber on test flights.
It said the Taranis ""black delta-wing craft"" was being developed nearby to deliver bombs undetected in war zones; back to the testing board then?
However, initial reports when the Taranis contract was let last year said it would take at least four years to develop with flight testing due 2010... in Australia.
CNN has also been ""bombarded"" with messages, but mainly from people less than convinced.
J. Kale believed there was a very simple explanation.
""The octopus thing obviously thought the wind turbine was a female doing a mating dance and tried to mate with it.""
Trevor Brown was worried the aliens did not ""know how to drive a flying octopus.""

Maxim, who lives near the turbines, had a simple explanation for the lights.
""On Sunday there was a very spectacular meteor shower, like fireworks on the horizontal.""

Lilia was unimpressed with some of the explanations -- and your writer. 
""Listen, just report the story and follow through. Think you can do that? Without screwing up? The plausible explanations are absurd. You are going to tell me that the residents of the area are not going to recognize fireworks? This is a ridiculous and insulting explanation and it sounds exactly like that, offensive and ridiculous. I don't know if there was a UFO or not, but it is all rather odd. What I do know is that the arrogant tone has got to stop.""
Is it life Jim but not as we know it?

According to Officials at the state run Vietnam News Agency, ""An unidentified flying object exploded at about 10am on May 27 over the northern part of Phu Quoc Island."" Colonel Nguyen Van Qui, a military commander on the island was the source of the report and no civilian, commercial or military aircraft are said to be missing in that area of southern Vietnam or nearby Cambodia.<lj-cut>

The object that crashed was first seen in the skies over Cambodia where officials said it appeared as a ""fire in the sky."" The thing exploded shortly after that and what was left of it crashed on Phu Quoc Island. Citizens of a commune on the island retrieved a piece of metal from the crash that they described as measuring ""one metre by about 60 centimeters."" The metal is unusual looking and appears to have symbols engraved or stamped into it.

Additional pieces of metal were recovered by members of the military and civilians. At this writing, there are fourteen pieces in possession of the Military Command of Phu Quoc District. The metal debris rained down in Ganh Dau and Cua Can communes on Phu Quoc at about 10:20 a.m. on May 27, 2008, according to Lam Quang Chanh, a spokesperson for the provincial People's Committee.

While it's entirely possible that the sightings and recovered material may have nothing to do with an Alien Spacecraft, the events surrounding this crash are similar to other incidents involving UFOs. For example, some of the symbols that appear to be engraved or stamped into the metal (if they are genuine) are similar to those described by witnesses on the thing that crashed near Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, in the 1960s. An I-beam from the Roswell UFO Crash in 1947 was also reported to have unknown symbols on it.

Phu Quoc Island is a popular tourist destination located in the Gulf of Thailand. It has thirteen resort areas and several urban centers. The island was once considered a backwater area known primarily for the production of anchovy sauce and black pepper. Once a French territory with rubber and coconut plantations, Phu Quoc Island housed a prisoner of war camp during the Vietnam War. Vietnam and Cambodia struggled over possession of the island for years after the war until it finally became a part of Vietnam in 1975.</lj-cut>

UFO crashes are rare events. When they occur in an area of the world that may not be under the control of the usual cover-up suspects, an opportunity presents itself for the nation and people involved to share what has happened with the world. Vietnam is a Communist country with close ties to China, so there still may be a tight lid clamped on this event at some point. If that doesn't occur, we may have a chance to see the smoking gun that proves intelligent Alien life forms exist and are visiting the Earth.

Something happened to me. I remember the clearing, and I remember there were people with me, but I don't remember where, or who they were. All I know now is someone is watching me, keeping tabs on my every move. I don't know how I came to be where I am now but it is crucial that I keep moving, keep going with my investigation.

Something happened to me that day. I just need to remember it. 

I'm pretty sure someone who knows, or who knew me then might see this, so I will write again later. <u><font color=""red""><b>Don't reply to this communication!!</u></font></b>

<B>Report Number:</B> 8810<BR>
<B>Date:</B> July, 1970<BR>
<B>Location:</B>Woodstock, Vermont<BR>

<B>Background:</B> In the summer of 1970, promoters Lew Workman and Brian Wilkie hatched a scheme for a four-day outdoor concert on a farm outside the small town of Woodstock, Vermont. The promoters hoped to recapture the spirit of the original Woodstock Festival, which had taken place a year earlier in upstate New York.  They also hoped that their concert, dubbed Woodstock II, would helped erase bad memories left over from the December, 1969, Altamont Concert in California, where a fan had been stabbed to death while the Rolling Stones were playing onstage.  Workman and Wilkie were able to lure a number of big acts to the event, including King Crimson, Iron Butterfly and Mountain.<P>

<BR>
<B>Incident:</B> On the second night of the concert, Teddy Desilets, a member of the Hell's Angels motorcycle gang, arrived at the Emergency Room of the Woodstock Hospital with a badly-mangled right hand.  Desilets had been attending Woodstock II and was apparently attacked by a crazed man while relieving himself in the woods.  The twenty-six-year-old Desilets, who had lost his thumb and parts of two fingers in the attack, underwent surgery and was admitted to intensive care.<P>

The following night, police were summoned to the hospital with reports of a deranged man terrorizing the patients and staff.  When police arrived, they found Desilets in a catatonic state, blood streaming from his mouth.  Desilets attacked the police and, despite being shot numerous times, escaped into the night.  All told, eleven patients and two cops were bitten; the most serious of the injured had almost his entire shoulder chewed off.<P>

At first, police and doctors believed that Desilets' state was due to a reaction to hallucinogenic drugs.  But after several more people arrived at the hospital from the concert with bite injuries, the FBI was notified.  The Agency instructed hospital staff to vaccinate and quarantine any victims until they arrived.  Unfortunately, hospital staff discovered that it had no vaccine on hand, and with several of the patients bitten by Desilets turning into zombies, they were soon overwhelmed.  The panicked staff moved as many of the sick out of the hospital as they could, and then abandoned the building.<P>
<BR>

<B>Investigation:</B> Within two hours of being notified, an FBI team from Boston arrived in Vermont, took stock of the situation and quickly called for reinforcements from the New York office.  With the help of the Vermont National Guard, the Boston team secured the hospital, administered vaccine to the recently wounded, and destroyed a total of 22 zombies inside the building.  The search-and-destroy mission was particularly hazardous, as one of the zombies had chewed through an electrical cable, cutting power to the building and leaving it mostly dark.<P>

The New York team arrived at the concert via a police escort just as Crosby, Still, Nash and Young were about to go on.  The Agency apprised concert organizers of the situation and asked them to call off the show.  When the huge crowd was told of the concert's cancellation, they rioted, turning over police cars and lighting the stage on fire.  Several of the bands, including CSN&Y, had to be helicoptered out of the area.  Fortunately, a large contingent of National Guard troops arrived from Massachusetts and restored order.<P>

National Guard and state police under the supervision of agents organized the evacuation of the area, during which 17 zombies were encountered and destroyed.  Over the course of the next day, another 23 zombies were destroyed in the woods surrounding the farm.  Among the dead zombies: Teddy Desilets, who had managed to stagger back to the concert despite having 15 bullets in him; and John Robie, owner of a neighboring farm.<P>
<BR>

<B>Post Mortems:</B> The zombie outbreak that started at Woodstock II took many weeks to fully contain.  Several zombies managed to stray into neighboring towns, and one infected motorcycle gang went on a rampage across several states before they were trapped in an abandoned barn in Indiana and destroyed.<P>

The source of the zombie attacks was traced back to the farmer John Robie.  Robie had been cleaning the henhouse at his farm when he was apparently bitten by an infected rat.  After his transformation was complete, he made his way to the concert site and a veritable zombie smorgasbord.<P>

<B>Comments from Dr. Pecos:</B> By the mid-Twentieth Century, zombie attacks were very rare. 
For the rest of the summer, Vermont was a state under quarantine.  An atmosphere of fear and paranoia reigned: most Vermonters stayed in their homes, and several innocent people were shot and killed when they were mistaken for zombies.  Thousands of livestock had to be destroyed after several cows were discovered to be carrying the virus.  By the time the outbreak was fully contained, 137 people had been bitten; of those, 79 were transformed and eventually destroyed.  Concert promoters Workman and Wilkie were ruined.<P>

<BR>
 Many hospitals stopped carrying the vaccine, and few if any doctors had any experience dealing with victims.  This ignorance, coupled with the large crowd at Woodstock II, combined to create the worst single wave of zombie attacks in U.S. history.  Woodstock II, which had been organized to promote peace and love, would forever be known as ""Deadstock.""

<IMG SRC=""http://pics.livejournal.com/m1jac0ge0/pic/00001ape"">These words. They stick to my teeth and are soundless. They linger like the
smell of cigarettes and occasionally, reach you like I mean them to.

... And I want these words to make things <i>right</i>...

But time is most definitely not on my side in this one. 

Do you remember when we were on the verge of breakthrough? Do you remember the ground under our feet and the stars we loved? Do you remember that feeling, like we could make our own reality, defy everything that had set out to destroy us, finally win, or walk away at last? Do you remember the beginning of seizing control of your own life, without limitations, with all your dreams attainable? <strike>Of course she doesn't...</strike>

well, I lost you and I almost lost it.

Each confined to our own thoughts we found our way back to chairs at the opposite ends of the universe. In that place of populated loneliness I learned something about companionship, our quest for it, and the many rejections of it. What I found is that it is very pleasant to break something but what most people do not understand is that like a chess game, the glory of battle is prior to the checkmate because the final act itself is full of emptiness. Instinctively afraid of victory we pursue indecisive skirmishes, sensing the hollow pride the war's end could bring. The torture is in getting what you want, not in losing it.

Or so I thought until I had you and then I lost you again. 

Why...why am I like this? I am watching it all slip through my hands, and all I can do is stare in disbelief. Am I not a good person? Why do I care? Don't I deserve someone like her?

I don't know. We've come a long way at the same time.

I often feel as though I wasn't ever meant for this world. But I don't want to sound so ""divine"" or alien. I feel more like a blunder. Even with the people that should understand me or that I should understand, where I should get along, I still feel like a stranger and at odds.

To Scully...well, Scully in the future anyway...

I wonder where you are tonight. If you ever think of me, or if you've put it all far far out of your mind. 

I can't help but think of you, of course. You're with me now. Of course, you're not you...not yet. But I'm going to do what I can to keep you safe, to give you that future. 

Even if that future takes my own away.

The you I'm guarding now. She doesn't remember. I guess she can't. It hasn't happened yet. And how could I tell her? She wouldn't understand. She'd want to, of course- if nothing else to find a logical reason, a way to prove me wrong, somehow. 

What would I tell her? What wouldn't drive her away, undo all we did?

To categorize our relationship, well that wouldn't be fair. We fought, we fought long and hard. Almost every night to be exact.  I made selfish decisions, I was arrogant and egotistical.

Now, ask me, what is it that we have?

Love isn't created over a period of time, love is created over a connection. I love you, and I'm looking forward to everything we have in store for us as an us, and I won't give up on you, if you don't give up on me just yet.

I want to believe in it all I can-music and art,fate and love.And I want to believe that I've made the right choices and that I'm on the right path and there's still time to fix some mistakes I've made. And I guess I want hope.

And I want you.

I wanted to see you because I needed to know if you could forgive me. I wanted to see if I still stood a chance to be great in your eyes and what you did-you forgave me. That was the moment that everything changed for me. That was the moment I fell in love with you. The one who could see past all the mistakes I made. I guess sometimes I screw up because I want to feel that again. I suppose that sounds pretty broken, huh?

Just take that into consideration.That's all I'm asking. It doesn't matter where you're coming from, I'm yours. I think I'll just stick to you like glue. 

Sticky sticky glue.


Goodnight, Scully, wherever you are."

Also, I  did all the things I meant to do yesterday and then some today, in spite  of feeling like I have a horrible hangover - one to the point of severe nausea. 

The irony in this statement, of course, is that I haven't had a drop of alcohol in a week. 

But my head feels like it's exploding, I ache, and my stomach feels like it's still deciding whether or not to be upset. I don't know if it's just hunger or what; I've eaten plenty today. 

Where is the defining line of being unhappy because you are greedy and selfish, and where you are unhappy because you are truly being treated unfairly? How do you decide when enough is enough? Who tells you when to move on when you are ""waiting for something""? How do you know to keep waiting? If you wait, will you gain everything or lose everything... I keep telling myself that due to my circumstances, it's not that easy, there's a lot more to it. Is it? Or is this just an excuse I am giving myself. 

The truth is, I have the answers to everything and nothing all at once. 

The truth is I finally know the truth... but to seek something your whole life and to hold it in your hands are two entirely different things.

Scully, I wish you were here. You'd be able to tell me if any of what I've experienced is real, or if it's all been some fever dream I've been experiencing. And if it is that latter, maybe you could wake me up, or tell me why it just keeps hurting...

<i>unappreciated and alone, this is where i get stoned...</i>

Hey. Do you remember that Rats record I had? The vinyl one I almost wore the grooves out of, the one you absolutely hated when I'd put it on once in awhile and ask you to dance with me. Those swinging glam sounds...

Met that guy, the singer for that band. He's been here in Silent Hill on and off for awhile. I had to ask him what he did that was so terrible he belonged 
in this bone-marrow-sucking, shit stinking fogpit hellhole of a town, but even he couldn't remember. 

Guess Langley wins by default. Pay you when I see you.

Today has been an odd day for me. I've felt lethargic, pensive and very quiet. I don't feel well but I think it's because I feel very hollow today. Maybe it's because of lack of sleep or the fact that I'm feeling kinda lonely, but I still don't like it.

Exactly like me. Somehow? I can't see it.

I feel like crap. Like a large pile of poo festering on an open fire... stinking out the room with its foul stench... attracting small insects to come and eat me. No one has made any effort to check in on me. They are all just gallivanting off with each other.

Statistically, one spends huge amounts of one's life building things up; financial security, friendships, love relationships, position and skill at work, family, purpose. At the end of a life well lived, one should be able to look back and have a sense of accomplishment and community. There should be lifelong friends to look to and reminisce with.

If you accept this as so, my life is about 55% over, or more if the dire predictions about the future have any basis in reality. I have not spent my first half in building up these things. instead, I spent those years frozen in a place of self-loathing obsessing over how I managed to lose my sister in plain sight, and trying to convince others that things most people believe to be the stuff of tabloids and crazy people really DO exist. 
<lj-template name=""qotd"" id=""342"" />
Probably because I'm not a nice person. At least I don't pretend I am. That would make me completely insufferable.

Again though, I'd like to hope this doesn't make me the worst person on the planet. I don't bomb other people's houses, or kill all their pets and small children. I don't spend my time obsessing on how many of other people's orifices I can socket my cock into and get away with it without caring about them. 

Weird, yes. Maybe even deserving of this 'spooky' moniker. I'm the guy who can change any subject into a connection with the alien takeover and the conspiracy to hide it, and I'm sure you're all tired of it by now. I dont ever get taken seriously, and I guess I know why. I admit though. I'd like to see my hard work pay off.

If nothing else, so I can gloat and say 'I told you so.'"

Admittedly, I'm not really one to wallow in the mystery of the Great Zombie Jesus.Might be because I wasn't born Christian... but mostly, especially due to our present circumstances with the end products of Umbrella Pharmaceuticals nipping at our nads, it's my humble opinion that I don't think it's appropriate to pretend to eat the flesh and blood of your god.

Still, not to make light of an agonizing death nailed to a cross, but if God told me that I was going to be beaten, whipped, crucified, and stabbed with a spear until I died, but three days later I'd be resurrected, rocketed to heaven, and I'd get to spend the rest of eternity as King of the Universe, I'd say that was a pretty sweet deal.

Again though, not Christian. Just an observation. I am only in this deal for the candy.

I was brought up Jewish- com'on, you couldn't guess? 
Not that that religion is exactly a walk in the park either.

Here, an example.One woman writes: 
<font size=1>A  good friend of mine was in a car accident with her children. Her husband was not in the car with her. 

He is not allowed to say Bircas Hagomel for her or for his children, apparently. And she is not supposed to say Bircas Hagomel because it is immodest for a woman to make a blessing in public, according to the Mishnah Berurah.

So here are my questions: 

1. Logically speaking, why is saying bircas hagomel more immodest than say, a woman saying a blessing outloud in the presence of men in any other situation?  More immodest than saying ""leishev basukkah"" when there are men in her sukkah, or saying a bracha over her piece of challah at the dinner table, or even at an Amein party, the latest crazy thing people do to gain themselves more favor in God's eyes? It's not like the woman is trying to be yotzei anyone by saying bircas hagomel, she is just trying to thank God publicly for her survival. 

2. Emotionally speaking, who the hell is my God that He considers it immodest for a woman to thank Him for surviving a car accident or cancer or some other horrible thing? Who are the men who would be aroused by such a display of public immodesty? Which hole did they crawl out from, when can they go back there and why are halachos being built around their bizarre fetishes? </font>

<lj-cut text=""there should be a leash law on dogma, IMHO"">
I rarely have a coherent theme to my posts, this one is no exception. But I just had to share that little slice of Jewish illogic. I hope no one is overly offended... but since Halo of the Sun is the main religion here, I doubt anyone would be. 

After all, you're an equal opportunity religion, yes? Both men AND women can be offered up like pieces of meat to your gods. 

None of this misogyny in Silent Hill's church system. 

I keep having weird dreams.Not that I can remember them at all at this juncture, but I remember the uneasiness that comes after I've woken from them.

Aah caffeine test. Is it just that my timing is off, or is this low grade coffee from the machines beginning to lose it's effects on me?

Why couldn't we have wound up holed up in a Starbucks? I wonder now and again.

Misleading title, wasn't it? I thought they were going to tell us it was okay to ignore the undead shambling around trying to bite us, because surely they don't exist.

Of course, even so, we'd still have to worry, right? Aren't most of the newer ones leaking through from that 'Hogwarts' place? That'd make them <i>English</i> zombies instead.

You can take my word for it, folks, I studied at Oxford, and English zombies are definitely real, and many of them have tenure up there.

Ok, readers, a deceptively simple question; What do you want from life?

Ideally. Years from now (hopefully), just before your blood turns cold, what do you want to look back and see? What makes it significant? What does it mean to live a good life? 

moreover, how does this ideal differ from what you believed you wanted as a child?

Before you commentspam all over me, think about it. Really think about your answer. In fact, stop reading this, sit down for a moment, and truly consider what I am asking you to do.

I don't think listening to Leonard Cohen alone late at night in a darkened room is very healthy. I don't know whether to hope that by the time I get to his age, I am not that cynical and bitter, or whether just to embrace the inevitability of it.

Yes, I know. Random much, Agent M? 

An observation I had recently; Microsoft Word is mightier then the sword.  I just have to be careful and double check  everything.  Nothing devalues a well phrased venom ladened entry like a few misspelled words.  

So who, might you ask, has <i>pissed me off</i> as to earn such a public flogging? 

Well, no one yet, I guess, since I'm sitting on the thing I wrote. Maybe, just maybe later I'll get around to telling that smarmy British bastard what I truly think of him...

For now, a random ad image I found interesting, and another meme.

"event","When people die, invariably those left behind to live on make statements indicative that the dead are now in a better place. Are these statements true, or are they only devices we use to distance ourselves from the pain of loss and the knowledge that one day we will also be the ones about whom those statements are made?

It doesn't even seem to matter what kind of person the dead was in life. With few exceptions, death clears the slate and renders all the wrongs committed negated if not forgotten entirely. I have never personally heard it spoken that the dead are suffering in hell as just punishment for their deeds in life. It seems to strongly support the premise that our views on what befalls us after death are based more on hope than on truth. We hope that our misdeeds are cleared from the slate after we die.

Some have suggested this 'Silent Hill' is, in some way some kind of Hell, or at least the last stopover before Hell, so you can stock up on sunflower seeds and all those little trinkets they sell in truckstops before the real punishment comes on.

I don't know. In some ways I really like Silent Hill, or did, anyway. When Juno came for me, and when I had Kylie and Ashley giving me ideas for things to research, when I thought of it still as a case to solve. Cassie'd talk to me now and then. Scotty and I would shoot baskets.

It almost seemed like a nice enough town, then, for something haunted by aliens and its own past, that is.

I do a good job of blocking painful, unnecessary things from my memory.

Like my death, and all the things that came with it. I like to pretend that I'm still happy, and I even fool myself when I'm just waking up, when sleep still fogs my mind. But lately, I have not been sleeping well, and it is really starting to catch up to me in the form of being a total bitch. Of course this may just be because I am tired, and actually legitimately stressed. 

I feel like my small kernel of personality is moments from dissolving. Resolved to find a new world, and maybe this time it won't start to sour so quickly. Is that naive? To even assume that's possible? Please rename me the lost boy never to grow old.

""><lj-cut text=""He lies all the time."">

Sweet lies. Smooth lies. For Krycek lying is as easy as breathing, and as necessary.

He likes what the lies do, the lives he has ruined, the histories he has rewritten. People live and die by the power of the lies Krycek tells. 

Every time he goes before the Syndicate, the Smoking Man, the folk from Umbrella, Wolfram & Hart or any of the dozens of other behind the scenes powers he pretends loyalty to, he makes another lie, another story, another non explanation. Thousands of alternatives, none of them real, but seeded in just enough truth that his mark believes them so they become true, for just long enough that damage will be done by those lies of his.

He doesn't believe his own lies. He's not that desperate.

The writer William Burroughs once said that the one real danger any undercover agent faces is the temptation to believe his own cover story. That just for a minute he will become tired of his work and wish he could be that person he's pretending to be. 

I suspect Krycek is immune to this kind of danger. He has never once been anything he says he is, never been completely trusted or loved by anyone, has never lived in anything but lies. 

His lies suit him. He carries them inside him like masks, each mask a face he is as comfortable about slipping on and wearing as his own, if even he has an own left to wear at all.

You wonder why I am so outraged this man is here at all. Insofar as any of you know he hasn't made a move, bothered anyone, spoken to any of you. 

But I know Krycek. I know what he's capable of. Even if you never see him, never hear him, never have to bear a single moment in his stinking presence, the very fact he's here means something is wrong. 

Krycek is a tragedy waiting to happen. He carries despair and death around him like a cloak. 

I ask you to shun this man. If you find him dying, let him die. If you have the chance, shoot him on sight. 

I don't call him Ratboy idly. And, like the presence of rats, I know if Krycek is here then plague isn't too far behind him.

"event","I sometimes hate the night. Its supposed to be a time of peace, rest, and time for the body, mind and soul to unwind and let go. But there are nights like this where I sit up and wonder about my life and how the choices I have made have influenced me for the good or the bad. Try as I might sometimes I cannot look back and only see the happy memories of my youth, only the shattered broken pieces that I have managed to pick up and glue back together. When I look back, sometimes I wish that things could have been different. But I know that because of these moments in my life, I am who I am because of them and I am thankful for that.
<lj-cut>

We made it to Ghoul, finally. Apparently on the tail of another series of dramatic events. Someone out there attacked Wyndam-Pryce and that friend of his, Dana. 

They were rescued by another newcomer, a girl with a dog.

I am still trying to puzzle out the bizarre series of events that seems to have pulled us all here to Silent Hill.

I know <i>they</i> have much to do with it, of course. They seem to be selecting people for something, not just abducting us at random. 

Much talk is made of the local religion and its gods, but as soon as I saw those meteors I knew this place was simply a hotspot for UFO activity. 

Could it be that Xulchilbara is, in the end, an alien as well? He claims, and history shows that his name is Mayan in origin, and that he claims to have known of the Aztecs as well. 

This may be one of those 'people from the sky' the ancients carved in stone in their complex chariots that allowed them flight and other godlike powers. 

Sullivan is still here in this place as well. For some reason, girls are drawn to him, seem compelled to speak to him. 

He doesn't seem to reject their advances, but this is probably because he is marking them for death later.

He won't kill anyone while I'm here, certainly."

"event","I miss going to the range and shooting by myself. Not to sound like Patrick Swayze schooling Johnny Utah on zen and meaning of life and all that shit, but there's something so centering about solo shooting. I mean, it was public range and there's all sorts of booming and banging and hot brass from the dude with the Dragunov eight tables over pelting your forearm going on, but somehow, I can just tune it out. It's just me and the target and my rifle between us, and it's the most bizarre combination of intense focus and equally intense detachment. 

But then, I suppose in this little hick town, my leg cramping and aching just to remind me that no, it's not done healing, sorry, there's too much time for me to think about all the things I miss.

Scully, of course. Not in a replace-Juno sort of way- no, we tried and we have a deep camraderie but it just... it wasn't meant to be that. I don't think. What Scully and I had transcended the whole boyfriend-girlfriend sex thing most people take as a relationship between members of the opposite sex- she was my partner and she was my best friend, and she was all but family, but she was never destined to be <i>that</i> for me. 

I miss my life.

Yes, yes, I know- I'm alive now, but still. The whole being dead thing was kind of a surprise, honestly. And insofar as these things go I feel as though I lost- something- in it happening. I have all the sensation in my limbs and all the thoughts in my head, my memories- I'm still <i>me</i> in essence. But... not, somehow, too. 

I guess you'd have to try it to find out what I mean, and if you haven't yet, don't. As 'miracles' go I'd have as soon skipped this one.

It sucks that human nature always makes you want what you can't have, but I think sometimes we need to realize what we *do* have and what we're capable of getting, and then in turn be thankful for it.

Gah. Sappy, I know.

I feel like I've been looking for fights the past few days. Actively seeking them.

But I think I'm out of this anxious-angry-jittery stage, and into something else.  Right now I just feel sad and restless, but hopefully i can feel ok soon."

<b>::Warded from Krycek::</b>
Ok, so, I admit it. I can be a little highstrung sometimes. Paranoid even. But. 
If you never believed me, if you never listened to me on anything else before, listen to me on this.

Alex Krycek is not your friend.
Alex Krycek is not to be trusted.

In fact, I would go so far as to say <b>shoot Alex Krycek <u>on <i>sight</u></i></b>, but I guess you guys wouldn't do it. 

Still. 

Don't talk to this man. 
Don't tell him anything.
Don't let him in your houses or shelters.
Don't 
Don't 
<b>Don't</b>!"

"event","The name is from the French. Gargoeui. The name of a medieval dragon that prowled the river Seine. Whose horrible image became the symbol of the soul of the condemned. Turned to stone. Or of the devils and demons of the underworld spared eternal damnation.

The embodiment of the lesser forces of the universe who inspired dread, the threat of our own damnation. Ushers into hell or into the realm of our own dark fears and imagination. For over 1200 years, this grotesque image has found its expression in stone, clay, wood, oil and charcoal. Born again and again as if resurrecting itself by its own will through tortured human expression, almost as if it existed. Haunting men inwardly so that it may haunt mankind for eternity. As it must have haunted John Mostow, the mad artist whose work I found myself contemplating, the man who even drove Professor Patterson mad in the end.

But what impulses moved mankind throughout the centuries to paint gargoyles as killers? Could this be the same dark force at work? Its ultimate expression the destruction of the flesh? Of the very hand that creates it? Is this evil something born in each of us? Crouching in the shadow of every human soul waiting to emerge? A monster waiting to violate our bodies and twist our will to do its bidding? Is this the monster called madness?"

"event","<IMG SRC=""http://pics.livejournal.com/m1jac0ge0/pic/00001ape"">Aaaaand on this day in baseball history 1979 Willie Mays is selected by the BBWAA as a member of the Hall of Fame. The 'Say-Hey Kid' receives 409 of the 432 votes cast with 23 writers inexplicably leaving one of the top ball players of all time off their ballots.

Now why do you suppose that is?

No, I am not going to ask you if you smell a conspiracy here <i>this</i> time, although if it were any slower of a day I might say it bears investigating. 

So! 

The leg is feeling better, thank you for asking. I've been hobbling around a little without Juno or a crutch to support me; just as well, because I always told my mom I'd find a way to support myself.

Hey, lighten up! We could use a little humor around here.

This means I <i>am</i> available for playing cards, provided we deal the pirate out this time, ok? 

Been hearing mutterings on both sides of the coin in reaction to the recent removal of one Mr.W. Sullivan from our little clubhouse...  I have to say whereas I am by no means a member of tall, blonde and psychotic's fanclub, I'm a little curious why a witch with no interest in the capers the other witches are so obsessed with, and a johnny-come-lately ""Watcher"" suddenly have such authority in the first place.

Whaddya say, Wesley? Just dying to know who died and left you Waltie's rightful warden. 

Enlighten me. 

In other news the zombie armaggedon seems no closer today than it did when all this started.

There are undeads, yes, but so far they seem to be trickling in at an easy-to-handle rate. 

And so far no contact from the consummate evil known as Umbrella, who are supposed to be eyeing us all from some indetermined lair of doom. 

I'm just going to kick back, and wait for the clouds to go by.


Well, if I could see them with all this fog. 

And how's <i>your</i> day been, fellow Hillfolk?"

Posting ridiculous memes. Is that not what the network is for?

Well. I'm standing here doing 'the dance', because Vincent and Ulf have taken over the men's room. Again. 

I'm not so desperate as to want to slip past them to get my business done, and the last thing I need is to use the little girls', only to have Ashley or one of the ballerina kids walk in on me and scream or faint or something.

I'd go outside, but I don't feel like having any of my body parts torn off surrepticiously by zombies, either.

It does make for a bit of a bind. 

So. Things haven't changed all that much, except you know? The bowling alley isn't too bad of a place to lay low, now. We have heat, and hot water. Supplies. More weaponry than before, but still not enough. 

We have piles of dirt which have lights shining on them continually, and water running through them; these, we are reassured, will eventually become a garden. 

Still not the best of a medical facility. We're lacking a lot of the things Alchemilla had.

But in spite of Baby's postings that all is well and safe there, I have no intention of going near anyplace that would harbor Xuchilbara.

D'Namouh's still out there. Watching the place from across the street. You'd think she'd be worried about the zombies.

Maybe zombies don't bite vampires?"

<u>December 7</u>- ""On this day in baseball history 1973 The Giants sold future Hall of Fame pitcher Juan Marichal to the Red Sox."" in less eventful news, I was also under the church, battling crawlers. I remember it like it was yesterday... probably because my leg still hurts from the injury I sustained. 

<u>November 11th</u><lj-cut>- ""Professor Snape? Is everything alright at your end?""  IN hindsight I'd like to hope I was asking about the fight those people are involved in, and not the state of his posterior. Come to think of it, how <i>are</i> those guys? ...doing at the fight, I mean. I still don't care overly about their asses.

<u>Oct 16</u>-""Seems like a few people have disappeared out of the clear blue sky. Scotty,for one. Damn, I liked that guy."" 
I did, too. He wasn't bad on the court. Kinda ehh at catching the baddies- who <i>couldn't</i> tell it was that Satanist punk? but a fine baller.

That...sounded all kinds of wrong, didn't it?

<u>September 5th</u>-""This late night finds a particularly ugly dog up in the clearing by the local landmark known to some as Nankeehona, others as the Mother Stone. Although Mother Stone is a bit of a misnomer, as there are two of them; halves of a single whole.""  I still feel phantom pain- itches- as I think of the fleas of that time. 

<u>August 2nd</u>-""Kevin. Was anyone else in the cemetery when you came across the body?"" <i>You</i> try questioning a foul mouthed depression demon and do any better. 

<u>July 7th</u>-""So. We have newcomers!
Greetings. Welcome to the armpit of the world.
By now you'll have discovered the joy of the Silent Hill network. I'm afraid this is pretty much all you get. Well, and there's that public access station that shows weird shows out of Brahams, but I try to avoid using the television here, because sometimes the wires get scrambled and it decides to show you ghosts and nightmares instead."" Yes, I was feeling a little less than charmed that day.

<u>June 9th</u>-""What are your favorite and least favorite words? Any reasons why?
I think I'm going to have to go with ( anal ).""
My opinion still rests.

<u>May 1st</u>-""Alright, that is <i>it</i>.
If we don't get some coffee, I'm going to start busting heads.
Come what may, by hook or by crook, I'm going to the Happy Burger. 
Monsters, beware.""  Damn. Now that's determination. Or caffeine deprivation. Maybe a little of both. 

<u>April 4th</u>-""I take an active interest in the world around me, what's going on, all the time.
Call it an impulse; I need to know what's going on. Where am I? Question everything.
Right now fate has dropped me in a town called Silent Hill.
Have you ever heard of it? Well neither had I. Apparently it's somehow completely off the map, and in seafaring terms we all know what that means.""

<u>March 3d</u>-""From Project Bluebook: Close to Selfridge AFB, in Michigan, on March 3, 1950, a flying machine was detected in a reliable way by two instruments measuring physical data, both in good functioning condition.""

<u>February 2nd</u>-Oh, this is too much. Must have been one of those curses. ""It doesn't interest me at all to have actually found proof of life on other planets. Since I wasn't the least bit upset when my sister was abducted and would never have wasted my whole life trying to uncover conspiracies. 
I don't miss Scully. I do so well for myself on my own in this city, it doesn't overwhelm me in the slightest.
Moreover I'm not going to stop Xuchilbara and his wonderful cult. I intend to see that Alessa and her baby live and the world is changed to their liking.""

and finally,
<u>January 3d</u>-""Then if...everyone who had died came back to life...
..and I probably passed out drunk around 11 or so...
...but then, if I'm definitely alive....
ahh, it all makes no sense.
Even if it was some sort of poryphia-like virus that wouldn't explain the common belief in a hematophagic lifestyle thereafter, or the aversion to apotropaics-not that I'm saying I've particularly felt staurophobic or anything...""  I guess even then I was having problems with vampires.

and what, if anything, does this tell you about me that you might not have known prior?

Probably nothing, but thanks for reading this far, anyway."

The only advantage to our being on the run in a cursed town and unsure what to expect next from an alien environment that seems to like throwing deformed monsters and our own nightmares at us, is since we're in exile in the bowling alley instead've in a real hospital, I don't have to wear one of those assless gowns. <lj-cut>

I like this. Waking through the rust-covered cafeteria, only to have entrails flung on your plate by none other than our own celebrity mass murderer, Mr. W. Sullivan. On my left, practicing with her pompoms in one hand and a portent of woe in the other, poor local innocent bystander Cassie. 

You turn, taking your tray of dubious portions towards your table of choice. Sand is kicked in your face by the angel Rosiel, but he's so popular you can't do much about it.Later you see him making out with the prettiest girl in school, dearly departed Dexter, but s/he'd never even so much as glance at you, so you pass them by. Your lunch money is stolen by Wesley Pryce, because he's such a badass. Observing all this but doing nothing at all to stop you is Mio, who is practicing oompah-pahs on her tuba,and  Voldemort, who's solliquying to the plastic skull he keeps in his desk. You pass a poster. Henry Townshend is running for class president again, no mean accomplishment since he's dead. All in black and blasting 'Love Will Tear Us Apart' on a boombox covered with hello kitty and pictures of mass murderers, Ashleyy glares at you and writes a poem about killing everyone in the school one day because no one understands the depths of her little black heart, oh woe. 

This you only know because Juno's stolen her journal and scanned bits of it up onto <b>silly_freshmen</b>.com.

Alright. The whole thing is beginning to come into a semi-cohesive whole for me. All I need is a few more of the facts. Who's running this town? How did it become what it is? Where can I access more of the medical records, and most importantly what is a small time cult doing mixed up with genetic engineering? 

I guess as I'm going to have plenty of time lying on my back I can try to make more sense of this...

Plenty more time to just keep wasting time.

This one's for you, Trash. ;)
Makes more sense too. 
""Forms gang of scavengers.Loots the neighborhood:alwaysaskit."" Well, yes. I suppose if anyone ever saw The Question again, and he was in the middle of a zombie attack, he'd be doing just that. But not before he'd talked his way into your sanctuary to take of your dwindling supply of Bisquik and birthday candles, and until he'd convinced all your party of survivors they needed to give him their undergarments for safekeeping until he got to the next town.

""Plays tough-guy and gets bit within the first wave: Cyrus."" Well. Enough said. 

""You find them in your basement. Then sex them: Luna Lovegood."" Um...no. That's disturbing in more ways than I can begin to list here. Besides. Juno would kill me. 

""Gets intestines ripped out and screams like a girl: Benjamin Pierce."" That's what you get for being a conscientious objector, doc. 

""Becomes a bible-thumper. Says the lord will end it:"" Vincent... um, whatever his last name is. Maybe he doesn't need one? Like Cher.

or Sting.
Somehow I can see this. In spite of his cynicism, if anyone would turn back to religion, it <i>would</i> be our debauched little preacher man. 

One of these days he has to explain to me how a closeknit group of Hungarian <i>hasidim</i> occultists wound up connected with aliens and a brace of Mayan gods who clearly had no sense of direction.

""Kills more zombies that you could possibly imagine: Captain Jack Sparrow."" 
Perhaps, if anyone knew where he was. 

I get the feeling D'Namouh does. Don't you? Share with the class.



This isn't the first time I've been in a bowling alley, just so you know. There were deaths, of course, like almost ever investigation I've been on during the X-files. And a man who had memorized the bowling scores of all the victims. 

In hindsight though, I have to wonder. One of the sets Harold told us was 122 131 166 178 201. How did that bowler jump from 131 to 166 when you can't score more than 30 in a frame?"

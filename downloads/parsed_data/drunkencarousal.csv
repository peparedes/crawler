"event","well, it took 8 months but i finally cried at work. when i started working, back when i was what, 19? that was kind of a thing. first couple weeks or so i would have a little meltdown and cry in the bathroom. new jobs were often overwhelming. that stopped after a while. i guess it was the temping, its hard to feel overwhelmed when you were at a new job every couple of weeks. though the fact that the jobs were getting better probably had a little bit to do with it too. 

today didn't really have anything to do with being overwhelmed. it was just hormones and hunger. and anger. just punch-the-fucking-wall anger. i'm so frustrated. i never really thought of myself as some hippie, anti-establishment person, by mainstream standards i probably am, but i always figured i was perfectly capable of having an office job and indulging in my creative side during my free time. maybe i am, and its just this specific job, this company. all i know is this is not working. all i know is that this job makes me want to shave my head, sell my car and hang out with communists.

i would rather be getting yelled at by FPs at prudential than this, helping them sell invisible products to people with too much money. it'd be better than handling invisible ""tasks"" and mapping meaningless ""processes,"" its these people can't do anything without making a detailed outline, i bet they could come up with an official sounding acronym for wiping your ass. i'm fucking sick of it.

i listened to metal on my drive home and thought about my escape routes. i always say that i have no friends, no connections, but that's not true. i've got a family friend who has a big ass job in california. i know someone in film. it's not a total loss. but what i know i have to do is build connections in the publishing world, or else there's no chance i'm going to get where i want to go. unless of course after i'm fired i spend everyday writing until my hands fall off and get my first novel published to glowing fanfare and money-making controversy. who knows, it could happen. and july seems to be my lucky month.

i'll be toughing it though. i've got a trip to florida coming up that i want my paid-time-off for, so if i can manage two and half months without getting fired or vomiting all over my desk, i'm ok. after that, who knows."

so i've been at the new job for a little over a month now. its pretty lame. i spend 12 hours out of the day getting ready, driving to and from, and being at work. i get home with the intention of getting things done and i never do. evening has never been my best time of the day. when i'm there i do almost nothing. barely know what i'm supposed to be doing. its weird. i don't know. i would like to be there for a while to at least be able to put it on my resume. but i don't want to be there for a while, i don't even want to be there for a year. hopefully, just having this job will make it easier to find another one.

i've been using the time i spend traveling to listen to the harry potter books. just finished book 3. i think that's part of the reason why i've been finding myself missing school a lot lately, due to the association of when i discovered harry potter, and of course the fact that the stores revolve around school. i even miss classes. most of the time when i fantasize about school its about the people and the environment, but now i'm thinking about my old professors and going to class and writing papers. i look at little kids passing and envy their simple days of books and number 2 pencils.

as a result i'm writing more and forcing myself to think about what i want to accomplish. i used to allow my creativity to wander a lot, let my writing go wherever my mind wanted to go, which always meant a lot of unfinished projects and a swarm of ideas with no ending. but its not so bad purposely focusing on one thing, and its not that hard either. the project i'm working on isn't the one i'm most invested in, but its the simplest, i suppose. in a way, because its so underdeveloped, i'm more comfortable writing it down. what i've always found with writing short stories is that i just keep writing piece after piece after piece, whether its out of order or even despite not having a conscious thread, and then all of a sudden i'll look back and its done. i feel like that's possible with this project. i think its doable, i hope its doable.

i've been spending a lot of time reading snarky reviews on goodreads. since twilight, apparently, there's been an influx of supernational young adult literature based around mary sue-types falling for brooding, abusive supernatural men. they all come as a series, they all follow a formula. i can't help thinking about it - it would be so easy. write a piece of crap, bullshit until you have at least three books, and voila, money! but i don't if i could live with feeding even more misogynistic bullshit to preteens. the story i'm working on has all the right elements though, but its a totally different kind of story. maybe it'll be enough to ride the band wagon, just enough to sneak into a few little girls bedrooms and scare the crap out of them. and their moms."

"event","i come here when i have too many thoughts for a tumblr post. plus i don't really like doing personal stuff there

so big shit is happening. i think. hopefully. because i told office team that i won't be in to work on monday, so i better have somewhere else to be. i went for an interview maybe a month and a half ago for quest engineering. one of my relatives passes my resume around through the pratt & whitney channels, and it got to them. the job i actually interviewed for went away, but they emailed me last week saying that they wanted to offer me another position which is pretty much the same thing but for a different project. not interview for, or apply for, but offer. as in i have a job. a permanent job. that'll come with sick days and vacation days and health insurance. and its in east hartford. i'm kind of flipping out.

however, they want me to start monday, the 18th. i tried to get my acceptance letter and documentation to them as fast possible, though that was hard being that i had been working 9 to 5 at a place with no reception and no email access. background check took until friday, i got another email from them with my I9 forms and all that which i need to do before my first day so i'll do it sometime this weekend. and i kept emailing them and asking, ""what are the hours? when do you want me in on monday?"" and they never answered. so i could just sleep in on monday, and wait for them to call me, or plan to go there around 9:30 or something. i know from experience when on a new project, that getting there bright and early often means you're waiting around for an hour and half while someone tries to figure out what to do with you. sooo i don't know. but in any case, i'm not fretting too much about it. i've got the job, i sent them enough emails, its not my fault that wouldn't tell me when to come in.

meanwhile, another big event happened, and that is the last harry potter film. which i have not seen, and have no idea when i'm going to see it. i felt bad about not going to the midnight showing, however afterwards realized it would have been packed with sobbing harry potter fans, and i don't know if i would want to be around that. seeing it a couple weeks out might actually be a good idea. and i've been totally avoiding reviews (though i did just check rotten tomatoes for the rating, which is 97% holy damn, but that's it). so i don't know what i'm gonna do, and i don't know if i'm going to be a sentimental mess and it won't be a big deal at all.

and i feel really good these days. my weight's going down, even though my size doesn't seem to be. my midsection feels tighter though, like it stays in place regardless of what i eat or my bad posture, which is a good feeling. and my cellulite has been disappearing, i'm crediting pilates with that. i think i might try tai chi next. or ballroom dancing.

anyway, it seems like july is consistently a good month for me."

"event","i have a job interview tomorrow. i'm not that excited about it. might be that the place is something like an hour away, and if it doesn't go well that's a whole afternoon wasted, and if it does then that straps me in for a whole bunch of changes. its not that I don't want to be off on my own, i'm just worried that nothing will really change even if i do. i'll still be a hermit, i'll still have no social life, and i still won't be getting anything done that i want to. the only thing that will change is that i won't have the family to come home to.

or maybe i'm just thinking that I'll get the job and it'll suck. and it'll just be another thing that I'll have to wriggle my way out of, but then i'll need it for health insurance and the rest of my bills.

i don't want to grow up. not in the ""i don't want responsibilities"" kind of way, but in the ""i want to do want i want and get paid for it"" kind of way. or is that the same thing? a girl can dream.

ah well, i've got some awesome cousins up in that direction anyway. i don't know why i'm overthinking things so much. i think my back just hurts so I'm grumpy. i've got an appointment with the chiropractor in the morning so hopefully that'll make me feel better. in the meantime, i need to find myself a tempurpedic mattress topper."

"event","i really just don't want to do deal with shit right now.

i got rear-ended last week. it was my day off, and i was going shopping when a dumb fucking suv hit me while i was stopped at a light. the car was totaled, and i'm kind of glad. i don't think i could handle looking at the caved in trunk, even for a little while. once things were sorted out, i went on shopping, with the bumper barely an inch from the ground. bought myself two new pairs of shoes, a pair of pants and a bunch of other stuff from target. i got the thing home, and it was gone by the time i got home from work the next day, never to be seen again. 

so now there's calls from insurance agencies and lawyers. i don't want to think about it. getting some extra cash from the whole thing would be great. i already was set to get a car of my own, but now dad needs a car too, which we can't exactly afford. even so, we're better off than we would've been if the thing had just stopped running, or we hadn't decided to fix it last fall. the only thing i can't seem to get done is getting to the doctor. i don't have a primary, and i haven't had a physical in like six years, so its something that feels a lot more necessary than the rest.

so now i'm here at work, which is boring and there's nothing to do. i've started writing a new story, which i'm liking a lot. its about loneliness and little boys, two things i'm very timid about sharing my feelings on. when i opened the blank word document with a kind of vague idea, i had a severe feeling of panic. i had to scramble to remember the few scenes or phrases i had in mind and once i got the first few sentences down i felt better. i feel like a writer again. maybe if i pretend i'm in school i can learn to finish things more often.

i disabled my okcupid account. it was getting bad. it was constant inane messages from ugly people. though i'm thinking of reactivating my aff profile. i'm not really sure why i suddenly want to break my celibacy. i think i kept it up just because i was entertained by how easy it was. i could just simply say ""its not going to happen for a while,"" and almost immediately my libido dropped. i didn't even notice at first. i'm still pretty ok with it, i'm pretty sure i could never have sex again and be ok with that. but the weather is getting better and i'm writing and finding all this great music. i cut off ten inches of my hair, i'm doing pilates, my arms look sexy. i don't know, it just seems like a good time. 

i don't apply to jobs enough. i got the idea a little while ago to really try apply for blog writing positions. i didn't have the confidence to do that before, but i really am writing so much more than i was this time last year. i think its reasonable for someone to pay me to do this. but i haven't followed up on it yet, i spend most of my time off detoxing from the time wasted when i actually am getting paid. anyway, last summer was good to me. this one will be better."

"event","is it bad that i'm actually kind of happy to be unemployed for a little while? the problem with temp work, aside from the instability and lack of health insurance, is that there's no vacation days. i can't really plan for time off. so when i'm between jobs i have every intention of taking advantage of it. i can go shopping, schedule some doctor's appointments, get some more writing done, finally finish a book for once, and of course apply for jobs. there's a lot more interesting jobs than there were six months ago, but less than there were a month ago when i first got dumped from prudential. i had got two call backs a coupe weeks ago, which kind of blew my mind. neither worked out - one pulled an unexpected interview on me over the phone, i was eating lunch and totally not prepared; the other said they'd email the next day and they never did. *shrugs* there was a moment where i felt a little lost on my last day this friday, but its since passed. of course, employment is a priority, i'm in the market for a car and as soon as i find a good deal on the make i want, its going to happen. i'd like to have a salary to support that decision.

meanwhile, i saw <i>sucker punch</i> friday night with tyler. not his kind of movie at all, he found the whole thing cheesy. i enjoyed it, it was far from perfect, and i got kind of bored with the talking parts, but the stylization was really cool, and it was fun seeing zack snyder direct something original. you really got to see his style come through more distinctly. and plus, i'm happy to have supported an action movie with female leads on its opening night, even if i had to brave the idiocy of the 7pm tween crowd to do it.

i'm rather glad that last job is over. it wasn't terrible, but i definitely didn't like the situation, i'm pretty sure they didn't train me fully because they knew they were going to be hiring someone else and would have to train them all over again. there wasn't much to do - i spent most of my day on tumblr, searching through feminist blogs. i've learned more about how many ""ism""s out there that make the world an uglier place in the past month than i ever thought i would. as such i've been writing quite a bit more in my own blog, and with a little cross promotion, the traffic has gone up significantly. my first post on criminal minds has gotten over a thousand hits (my second post on the subject actually resulted in a dip in traffic, oh well). all this awareness has made slightly more self-conscious of all my ideas, but at the same time i know it'll make me a better writer and be able to contribute more to the world. its better than being useless."

"event","so there have been a couple shake ups since i last posted. i think literally the day after, i got the call from the temp agency that the 18th would be my last day. hey, at least we got some advance notice, which was both a good and bad thing. good so that plans could be made, not that i'm any good at that. and bad because i and the ten or so of us that would also be leaving had pretty much nothing to do for that last week. one guy actually stopped coming in (i was informed that, in fact, he'd been rehired to temp for another department, so clearly absenteeism didn't bother them much). they ended up letting us out before noon that last day, as soon as we had cleaned up our desks. so once i got home and ate lunch, procrastinated a little bit, i called up good old office team to let them know they could me back on the books until i could find something more permanent. turns out, they had a long-term gig they needed to fill, so i had new job before dinner that day.

a week later exactly, the computer had progressed to mind-numbing degree of slowness, so dad finally placed an order for a new one which he had been mulling over for a while now. within a few hours after that, the computer crashed for good. funny how these things work. thanks to my external, i only lost a few things that i had downloaded recently such as buffy season 8 and the pretty little liars books. and a little bit of writing i had done, but most of that was either written out or saved to my email. so now i'm on a brand spanking new computer and it is delicious. i'm becoming so much more productive, because i can actually do shit without the damn thing giving up on me. plus, windows 7 is pretty slick looking. its so much easier now to waste time, my butt is going to start going numb.

other than these changes though, its been a pretty dull week. i haven't gotten out much - my primary source of entertainment, tyler, flip-book boy, is still at prudential and also stressing out about an entrance exam he has to take for uconn. and the new job is a lot lonelier than the old one, front desk rather than integrated with a group, less people my age. so i've been craving some human interaction. so if there's anyone in the area who still reads this, hit me up, lets see a movie.  maybe i'll sign up for latin dance classes at the community center.

been trying to read more, just finished some scott mccloud and now have started a book about the early culture war against comic books. i've gotten active again on okcupid, don't know how well i'm doing. there's a very interesting guy from massachusetts, don't know if that's at all realistic. there's a guy in a polyamorous relationship, which may be a good thing for me right now, like dating training wheels lol. and now the fling from last summer has started messaging me again, and i'm not sure why. i mean, it should be obvious why, but its been small talk for over a week now, you figure if he wants something he'd come out and say it. he did say that he had been experiencing some social anxiety, which started after we stopped ""hanging out,"" mostly around women. i can't imagine why, maybe i actually managed to get through to him somewhat. of course, i never wanted to do him any damage (well, yes i did, but i never thought it possible). so maybe he's trying to retrace his steps, try to figure out what went wrong. don't know if i'll be able to help him with that."

"event","sometimes i wonder if i should cancel my paid account on here, because with my lack of posting its not really worth it just to have so many icons. however, i'm scared of lj with ads. and the inability to edit comments. its not like i don't use lj, i'm on it everyday, but not so much as a writer. i'm becoming more and more like the common user nowadays who only joins for the communities. that's kind of scary.

so work has finally become more relaxed. i had two weeks of mandatory overtime, putting in 65 hours the first week, 50 the next. my paycheck was satisfying, though i am definitely looking forward to april when i get a lot of it back. now that the so-called ""surge"" is over, work is slow and we've been getting out early. they might even manage to undo all the overtime we did. word is that they'll keep us around until april, but you never know. and my coworkers are dropping like flies, finding other jobs or moving away. or just getting sick of it. i don't want to be the last one standing.

we are not a family that has much luck with cars. mom has had her new car for i think a couple months now, so she's happy. but dad's car broke down and as such he's been using mine. and now mine is finally breaking down for good. apparently the level of use i was putting it through - getting to and from work and the occasional trip to the gym or mall - was really all it could handle. on the way back from work today, the exhaust finally broke off from the front and starting dragging. a trip that usually takes us five minutes took us about 30 instead going about two miles an hour with the flashers on. so i'll be doing some car hunting, haven't decided whether i want a used college car, or a new car. i'm leaning towards the latter, not surprisingly, with everything our cars have put us through i would rather not have to worry so much about a car literally falling apart on me. my funds are in a good place now, my savings account has actually surpassed my tuition debt, but of course that's helped by not spending very much and still living at home. a new car would give me some credit, could start thinking about moving out. maybe even getting a credit card. look at me, growing up and all that jazz.

in the non-day-to-day goings, i downloaded the kanye west album, my beautiful dark twisted fantasy. not really what i was expecting. its good, but i figured it would be more, you know, dark and twisted. its got a surprising amount of bounce, and while not as synthy as 808s and heartbreaks, its still got that very old school beat to it, which is awesome. this album actually has an appeal similar to another album that i flipped out about recently, florence and the machines' lungs. they are both very loud and chorus heavy. its like the got everybody into the room had them sing as loud as possible, then layered some thick drum beats on top. the effect is really awesome. i love that kind of thing, i don't know if its everyone's cup of tea though. the different between the two albums though is of course that kanye west does rap, and as such the songs don't have the same kind of rise and fall as a typical melody does. that's something i never noticed about rap before. it also has a lot to do with how kanye west has getting increasingly more abstract. the average song is over 6 minutes long, and sometimes his voice just trails off halfway and he lets all his guest singers or the samples and beats take over. 

all the hours spent at work has had me really starved of creativity. i've started entertaining the idea of getting up early before i have to start getting ready for work so i can write for a couple of hours, since my mind is a better place in the morning than it is in the evening after i come home. i've been thinking of reworking a story that i started over year ago. it was originally a horror story centered around the players involved, but i may go for a more crime procedural approach with a straightforward storyline, and then write it as abstractly as possible. i think i could get some good stuff done if i ever take the time to do it."

"event","i've been really wandering away from livejournal lately. all my random thoughts end up as facebook statuses. i even started a tumblr. but i'm still holding off on twitter, i'm sorry, i already have too many feeds to keep track of and tweets are only for famous people who actually have someone listening. but i'll probably always have an lj account because there are so many great things to keep track of on here. i just need to remind myself to write.

i felt obligated this time because i always write after christmas. the highlight of the day was the doctor who christmas special on bbc america, which was wonderful, i enjoyed it so much. as for gifts, i got a nice velour track suit from uncle dan and ana which i happen to be wearing now (though i'm still looking at some on victoria's secret, i still have store credit that i need to use). another pair of coach shoes, this time in brown, very pretty. a new coat, though its probably a little too big on me and, like the track suit, is gray. my goth (ha) days really left a legacy, mom is still shocked when i wear pink. oh and i got a gps, which means i no longer have an excuse to get free rides from people lol. but. but i really just wanted the 4th and 5th seasons of criminal minds. i really did. i guess the logic was that that was something i would buy for myself with the money i was given. gone are the days of wishlists - everyone wants to surprise you. its ok. i'm enjoying the velour.

so something interesting happened to me this week. i came in thursday to work to find a pack of post-its on my desk that were not mine. you're probably wondering how i could tell this, well they were obviously used and in some kind of disarray. my first reaction was ""wtf who the hell was at my desk."" at which point i picked it up and realized it was a flip book. i've tried a couple times to film it with my phone, but turns out that home made flip books generally look terrible on camera phones (plus i can't flip it and hold the phone at the same time. not very well anyway). so trust me when i say it was very cute. the night before had been a tad emotional, so the gesture first thing in the morning was touching. but by the end of the day i was starting to feel a little irritated about the whole thing. it was one of those moments where you feel impatient and undeserving at the same time, a little hard to explain. but i went to the gym and sweated most of that angst out, and friday i didn't think much of it. 

then yesterday, christmas, i got a message on facebook from my flipbook sender, explaining himself and apologizing for the slightly stalkerish behavior (imagine! someone apologizing to me about being a stalker). it was a kid who was training in the room adjacent to where i work. red hair, gauges, often wears vests and bow ties. in short, the only guy i've seen at work that looks like i could possibly have anything in common with. i looked at his profile and saw that he was friends with vidal, and i immediately ran upstairs to interrogate him on the matter. there was a moment where i considered not letting everyone in the house in on this odd little interaction that i was experiencing, but fuck it, i needed to know about this person. he apparently went to school with vidal's girlfriend, and they know a lot of the same people. crazy. so i messaged him back saying it's all god and generally to make conversation and that's where it is now. *shuffles feet* maybe i'll start following him on tumblr. 

anyway, i watched <i>the runaways</i> just now because i do not have a book to read, we are snowed in and there isn't much else to do. it was a good movie, and it put me in the mood to listen to kittie. yeah. i'm listening to the latest album now. i like it, its very classic metal, they did not fall into the emo trap in the ten years since i bought their first album. but damn i wish i had a book to read. i requested <i>let the right one in</i> from the library, but its not in yet. would've been extremely appropriate considering the weather. speaking of which, i both hope for a snow day tomorrow, and don't. because as much as i do not want to go into prudential, especially when i have to climb trap falls rd to get there, i'm probably going to be just as bored as i was today. man, and i really wanted to do some post-christmas shopping. maybe i'll just continue with my buffy rewatch."

"event","prudential makies me feel like there's not enough hours in my days. especially when they've changed our schedule to from 9:45 to 6:15. i might try to work myself up to going to the gym in morning so i'll have more time in the evening, but that might just make me into a wet noodle for the day. 

last night i was getting my 4minute fix and i thought to myself that i so want to be hyuna's stalker. i want to be that freak sobbing at her shows, screaming her name like a baby. maybe i'm just a little bit lonely. so i thought that last night would be a good night to rewatch the criminal minds episode ""somebody's watching"" which i had skipped in my run through of the first season. my memory told me that it wasn't that great, but it is reid-centric, and has amber heard, and a stalker lesbian storyline so it seemed appropriate. but i didn't get around to it because mom and dad were watching football so i ended up waching ""north mammon"" on ion, commercials and all. but then tonight i found out that amber heard, aside from being hot and frequently naked, is in fact a lesbian. yeah, i'm kind of psyched, ngl. so obviously ""somebody's watching"" got watched. better than i remembered, but still not wonderful. the crazy psycho lesbian is now in bones, in a role that she's much better at playing. amazing how much more attractive she looks when she's the leading male's love interest and she has to compete with emily deschanel. oh and the pool makeout scene was way hotter than i remembered. didn't think i could get it up for hetero stuff anymore, but when it comes down to it, get two atrociously good looking people wet and in each other's faces, there really isn't any way that's wrong.

spending a couple months in the steady office working environment has got me really thinking about how important it is to me to get to do something i enjoy for a living. because the fact of the matter is that i don't have much of a life. when i'm not working i'm on the computer, lounging about or whatever. i'm not in the habit of socializing or partying. and while i do hope to evolve some as time goes on, the basic structure will undoubtedly remain the same. so if i don't enjoy what i get paid to do i'm really not going to have much to show for my life. thankfully, with these thoughts comes more serious, confident thoughts about my writing. granted, i am always thinking seriously about my writing, but right now it all feels very attainable. maybe its the dawning of the new year, and the fact that this past year has been really good to me. i'm on the edge of something big i think.

this weekend was nice. we put up the christmas tree and the outside lights. i was in such a bad mood coming home from work last night but as soon as i saw our twinkling bulbs i felt happy. we went to south windsor to celebrate grandma's birthday. there are so many babies on dad's side of the family now, the youngest barely even two months old. they're all strange and smart and fascinating. vidal was watching as brynn, who is i think around a year in a half now, discovered how to carry her toys more efficiently. she picked up a bowl she found, felt it out to check out it size, tested what she could put in it, removed what she didn't want and kept what she did and walked off happy and triumphant. how nice it would be to have simple problems like that again, and solving them would be exciting rather than tedious.

my favorite month went by without a peep on here, sorry about that. birthday was good, halloween was good. the walking dead happened and there was much rejoicing. i'm getting paid but i still got no one to spend my money on but me. 

so when i haven't been working my buns off processing annuity contracts and making rich people richer and getting yelled at by nitpicky quality control people, i've been watching lots and lots of tv. not necessarily on tv, of course, i've become less and less tolerant of commercials. i bought the first three season of <i>criminal minds</i> and i'm three discs from finishing. shit's crazy additive, especially for a show that's as hit and miss as it is. its not nearly as in depth or character rich as <i>the inside</i> was, and has a serious problem with the way it characterizes women, but....well, i could make some stuff up about attachment to the characters and stories. but the truth is when a character leaves, i barely notice. and a lot of times the bad guy isn't terribly interesting. the truth is that i love every thing about matthew gray gubler. you don't get a better woobie than that. i love his strung out goth/nerd-boy persona, the ginormous eyes, the purple fucking scarves. and his hands. it is not right that a man should have such beautiful hands, wth seriously. but joe mantegna is pretty awesome too, and whenever thomas gibson gets all super assertive boss man i get kind of tingly. but as i said before, the females aside from garcia are negligible. that's why i'm almost glad their dumping the two of them this season. i'm hoping maybe they can start fresh with some more dynamic ladies, ones with actual personalities rather than cut-out career women with moments of sarcasm. its also pretty experimental visually, and i'm not talking about the green screen. granted, its not always executed terribly well, it usually induces a little ""oh that's interesting"" rather than an ""omg yes"" which i have actually gotten from watching tv a few times (namely, <i>journeyman</i> and a couple times in <i>house</i>). still its something. 

but yeah that's pretty much why i haven't been updating. or doing much of anything really. spencer reid has kind of been owning my soul. so i write a little bit here and there, but nothing too productive. but i did get a new phone finally. samsung captivate, makes my old iphone look like a chump. next on the list of materials items are a lap top and a car. mom got a new one, so now my brain is cued to models that i like. and that are affordable, of course. 

been working out a lot, not more in terms of quantity but in frequency. every other day rather than monday wednesday and friday. its made a massive difference. not in terms of size really, i'm not really different in any measurable form. and i'm actually weighing more. but i feel much more solid, my legs feel thick in a good way, i think my ass is an inch or two higher and my stomach feels flatter. and my learning curve is getting so steep i can barely keep up with it. i adjust to a new intensity level within a few days. i added thirty crunches to my regimen barely a week ago, and i think within two trips to the gym the stinging was already fading. and yet i still cannot do a pull up. oh well. 

i think the reason why i finally decided to update in here is because i was feeling strangely useless this weekend. despite being very productive. i don't understand it. one second i'm flying high and then all of sudden i want to bury myself. my relevance to the world is fading, or something in my head or my hormones think it is. there isn't really a quick fix for that. i'll probably just listen to the pretty restless for a little bit and getting some writing down tomorrow."

"event","things are moving so fast these days its making me dizzy. quite literally. i am currently employed, a temporary assignment yes but a long term one with prudential. nice big name to put on my resume. i just completed my second week of training in annuity processing and data entry. it kind of stinks i'm not gonna lie. it is my best paying job so far though. but i'm still hunting. there's a possibility of working at the milford town hall, mom was informed about an entry level job that was formerly occupied by a lackluster psych grad. my resume is forwarded. we'll see how it goes. 

vidal also got a new job, actually its an expanded version of an older job he had. pays better even though the commission isn't as good.  dad's getting his first social security check next week. and we finally got a driveway! its like were moving into modern suburbia one little step at a time. 

its weird, i feel like i got a little psychologically frayed from this short-term supposedly casual relationship i had. i am feeling very unsure of myself socially, or rather i'm thinking so much about all the things i'm not doing. this guy would go on and on about what a bad thing my introversion was. literally, go on and on, i feel like i could've bludgeoned him over the head (it almost happened, trust me) and he would've kept going. so i don't know if when i sit outside for lunch by myself and everyone else is in groups or in pairs and i feel freaking radioactive for it is because all the things he kept saying are dug into my head or if its just because i haven't been around this many young people in a while and i'm just out of place. and its kind of funny in how it sort of feels like high school when i sit off to the side and write in my old old notebook, and then i remember that its not goth poetry i'm writing, but a story that i hope to publish and use to build a career. so sorry if i'm not into socializing, but i have plans to get underway.

writing has been going surprisingly well though. i haven't written this much i suppose since school ended. i chalk it up to all the new interactions i have engaged in, because i while i am not that good in charming my prudential classmates, i have had quite a few encounters in the past couple of months. most of them good in fact, though no fireworks by any means. for a while i was thinking that i wanted to get serious about being serious. that was for like a week and i quickly realized that i would drive myself nuts that way. so while i want to be the aggressor and take the world by the balls, that may be advisable for my writing, but not with dating. there is a level of assertion that's important of course, but ultimately if it happens it happens, if it doesn't it doesn't. all i can do is ask the universe to grant my wishes."

i took these pictures on the beach at the cape during one of hour first hours of sun after several days of rain and wind. it only lasted for about twenty minutes before this fog rolled in off the ocean. the transition period was pretty awesome looking though.

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/drunkencarousal/pic/00039psk/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/drunkencarousal/pic/00039psk/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

that was when i had walked into the thick of it. i'm rather proud of this picture, especially since i managed it with just my iphone. rather spooky. 

i think this may be the first time i've been satisfied with a season in a while. i've gotten my fill of summer, we got plenty of heat and sun and even though it rained on over half of our cape cod vacation (of course, the only fucking week of the summer where it was rainy, cloudy and cold for several days straight), i'm ready for september. its not really in my nature these days to celebrate the passage of time, but i've done good things for myself this summer. it wasn't perfect, i haven't played any tennis and my tan is meager at best (i still have plenty of time to remedy those things though). but target already feels eons away, and i've even been doing a little bit of writing. now its time for the next stage.

so on the job front, i worked for the week and a half before cape cod at a demolition office answering phones and organizing paperwork. the place wasn't really my cup of tea, couldn't really put my finger on why, maybe it was just the uncomfortable chair. this week i'll be dressing st joe's students again in their senior drapes and whatnot, but that's only wednesday through friday. honestly, i don't mind this. i certainly prefer it to target. its not perfect but its not flipping burgers either, so i consider myself lucky.

on an intellectual front, i've been reading some damn good books. i read <i>2001: a space odyssey</i> which really makes me want to watch the movie again. i sated myself by reading over my old papers on it. i think i'll get my hands on its sequels soon as well as other arthur c. clarke stuff. after that i read <i>fathom</i> by cherie priest. i loved it, i enjoyed it more than <i>boneshaker</i> which is actually up for the hugo award this year. priest writes such great female characters, and the relationship dynamics she creates are so original. not to mention she's a pretty world builder too. i want to be her. i think i'll start reading her livejournal. next up on the list is another ian macdonald book, <i>brasyl</i>. i kind of went overboard the last time i went to the library :) which considering the rain, came in handy.

my personal life is feeling a little tattered. making friends and keeping in touch with the old ones is so much damn work, nevermind trying to figure out who's a viable candidate as a romantic partner. i've been thinking of going shopping, and then i thought maybe i should try to invite someone to go with me, instead of going alone like i always do. but i don't know who i'd invite. would that improve the experience or detract from it? would i even get any shopping done? all that thinking though is so unnecessary. it kills the moment. and that i think is what's wrong the world these days, not enough of people are in the moment at the right times."

"event","i've had a really bizarre weekend. quite literally an emotional roller coaster. unfortunately, i can't be totally candid about it, which i think is why i was having such a hard time dealing with it all. i really just wanted someone to talk to, and there wasn't anyone available that didn't have a stake in things. i found myself wandering okcupid seeing if i could just find someone to chat with and dump all my issues on. but that just seemed mean. but i'm out of the woods now. sort of.

let's start with the bad stuff. actually, i'll probably have to do this in chronological order but whatever. i've spent two weeks with aliquant and each day  there was less and less to do, to the point where friday was painfully boring. i never thought i would run out of ways to get the internet to entertain me, but there was only so many overthinkingit articles i could read before my eyes started to fall out of my head. so about forty minutes after i got out of work friday i get a call - which i missed - from office team. the voice mail sounded bad but i wasn't able to get back to them before they left for the week. so i spent the weekend wondering if i would have a job on monday. i don't. *sigh* but that's alright. if i got one long term position, i can get another, and at least it gave me a good excuse to leave target and not look back because i had every intention of leaving anyway. besides, technically the position is on ""hold"" so when things pick up again for them, and hopefully they will, i can get it back. 

on the up sides of said roller coaster, my cousin uli got married to his long time partner bill. and i can effectively call them my gay uncles now (uli's my second cousin - i think, what's it called when their actually your parent's cousin? - but i like saying uncle). i couldn't help but smile stupidly during the ceremony, it was all so sweet. but with all the stress and crazy thoughts that were going through my head i made for a very down party-goer. but at least i got to dance to ""alejandro.""

sunday i was starting to feel a lot better, my hormonal bubble popped finally and even though i was still dealing with cramps i was mentally in a better space. it also helped that i got to tour new haven with a cool guy. once we exhausted the street sights we went to see <i>salt</i>, which was surprisingly good. it was a bit like spy porn, i wasn't paying attention to all the ridiculous physical feats, but the more espionage type stuff i enjoyed. so it was a suprisingly weekend in many ways.

so office team says they're going to do their best to keep me busy, but even so i have nothing to do at the moment and that's kind of upsetting for me. i liked being an office, i liked working 8 to 5 even though it made me hate the computer by the end of day and drowsy during my free time. dad suggested i work on some personal projects, which is a good idea, i've been reading a lot so many i can muster up the motivation to finish one of my short stories. and apply to more jobs. since i updated my resume i've been getting a couple random calls from employers. nothing interesting, to be honest, i like to think of it that there is just as much opportunity in the world as there was two weeks ago. i can't give up now."

"event","alexa, meet the real world. well sort of. i suppose its still childish of me to think there is a difference in the ""real world"" and the life i'm living now. but i suppose i will always feel childish so i will always live in an imaginary world.

what i mean by all this is that i got a job. a real job. one that doesn't involve a uniform, that has hours 8 to 5, from monday to friday. it involves things like organizing papers and whatnot. honestly, in essence its probably not too different from target, except it won't be so brutal on my feet and i'll be getting paid over a dollar more an hour. for now. and here's the tricky part, its a temp-to-hire job. i have confidence in my self that i can snag the permanent position (i didn't have to do much to get it as a temp), but its still a risk. but i'm up for taking risks right now. i've never gotten anything out of playing it safe. 

the past two days have been exciting. the interview was wednesday morning and i was informed that i got it in the next morning. i was such a combination of excited, anxious and giddy that i had to go to the gym and purposely burn myself out in order to calm down. calling target and letting them know was incredibly scary. i'll be working there for another week, since the two weeks out hadn't gone up yet and the new job (aliquant is what they're called) wants me to start as soon as possible, so a week sounds like a good compromise. i don't know what's going to happen to my cape cod vacation. wednesday night i was thinking maybe i should've gotten a new bathing suit since i got the chance to swim around in a boy's pool. by without going to the cape i guess i'm good with what i've got. 

so thanks to said boy, i got to see two movies this week that were supposed to scary but weren't really. first was <i>predators</i>, which wasn't as exciting as i was hoping it would be, but was still a good movie. it had an interesting concept and characters and great actors, but really it was a b-movie disguised as major release. the other movie was <i>the crazies</i>, which wasn't much good at all. granted, i didn't really get to see the end of it :D

so isn't this a nice change? you get to see a journal post where i'm not angsting about the stagnancy in my life. things just took a sudden lurch forward. that's how the universe seems to always work, or maybe its just how i work. i need to email someone, and take a shower because i stink. i have to go into target today, as i do for the next six days, in a row. first time they ever did that to me outside of the holidays. guess it'll be the last."

"event","the subject line btw is from a rihanna song, and of that lyric one of my coworkers kept asking ""what does that even mean?"" this is what i'm around 30 hours a week

things have this way of working with me, that they'll seem peachy for a time and then things will normalize and start to suck again. we've had this problem with the computer where the internet dies any time we use an excess of virtual memory, so i switched to google chrome to see if it would help. it did, for a little while, then it went back to dying whenever i watched more than one youtube video within ten minutes. if you're not going to work, you stupid thing, why don't you just say so from the beginning, instead of stringing me along?

i'm kind of in a bad way at the moment. i was hoping to post again when i was in better spirits, but i've got an hour before work with not a lot to do and that pinch in between my eyebrows keeps mounting. i'm in that way of i hate everything and everything hates me, and its times like these that i need to rely on the little things, but those are just making it worse. i downloaded last night's episode of true blood, was going to sit down and watch it while i ate lunch, only to find it wasn't working because of the stupid site i got it from. i could list more but they get more and more silly as it goes, and the smaller the things are the more i want to punch a wall. i yelled at a shopping cart today that was in a parking spot i wanted. at least i managed to find myself a nice $8 belt at walmart. and the weather's nice. except i'll be inside. working. 

alright, alright, little things. my cousin sarah's wedding is this friday, which is actually not a little thing, but its not my party so i have less to be psyched about. but i get to get dressed up. i'm also getting my hair formally cut and possibly highlighted on wednesday. that's a nice little thing, a nice change. assuming it doesn't suck. and <i>blade runner</i> was on last night, that was pretty awesome.

i just need to get out, get away. i want the good-looking dude with the tattoos who works at planet fitness to ask me out, or someone like him. i want to see <i>predators</i> so damn badly. i want a good reason to buy that gold bikini we have at target, because it looks awesome on me but the only place i expect to be able to show it off is cape cod in august, which i'll be around little kids and old people. and i want a job interview by this time next month. or two. and a real job by the end of the summer. a car too, a good car that has air conditioning and doesn't make weird noises. 

i need a book to read. i think being american is what's killing me. i'm going to watch the new t.o.p. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdPnMoxKOWY"">video</a> again."

"event","sorry livejournal, you've been neglected. but you've been in my thoughts. i wonder if its even justified for me to have a paid account anymore. but i've heard lj is covered with ads now now, so maybe i'll just keep it to avoid that. oh and sorry, you're in for a ton of angst that's built up over the month of may. 

last night as i was trying to get myself to sleep i was also trying to not stir myself into a panic. much like after the year i spent unemployed, now that i'm coming to a year at target i'm getting itchy feet again. i need to do something. i know i'm not the best job hunter, i'm not really very aggressive or creative in that sense. but i do my damnedest. hr shaun chatted with my a bit yesterday about my job prospects, and i breezed over some of the ideas i've been mulling over, mostly involving more school and he said that i shouldn't need it, i already have a degree. he said his degree was in sports entertainment and event planning, and now he's in hr. i don't really know what he meant by that, because i don't want to just do anything. it seems almost obscene when i was so focused on being a writer all my life to just use my degree as a slide into some ineffectual office career. not that that would happen anyway in this world. its been two years and it hasn't happened. my mom's coworkers ask about me, ""what does she really want to do?"" what the hell does that even mean? i want to be rich and famous and save the world, what do you really want to do? you do know that this was not part of the plan? the plan was to graduate and get a small job at a cool place where i would be happy to work my way up through - a publishing or film company. but now things are shit and no one wants me except for target. 

so here's what i've been thinking about. there was the first plan of continuing studies - get a phd in cinema studies and become a film scholar and professor. massively cool, least productive. second -  get a degree in a occupation or physical therapy. i don't know why this field attracted my attention but it kind of makes sense to me, and occupational therapists are needed and well paid right now. its still school though, which means it still costs money. there have been talk of grants for connecticut students going for medical degrees but i don't think its set in stone yet. then there's the last one which i've just started to entertain - law school. loads and loads of money, but it would probably have the biggest payout, especially if i got into a field that i gave a shit about. maybe i actually could save the world.

or i could just keep chugging along. work my ass off at target while applying for jobs that i seem both over and under qualified for, and maybe snag one of them. try to write more, start submitting them for publication. try to just be what i want to be rather than paying other people to make me into it. and that's where the panic sets in. what if in another year i'm still doing this? i'm going to be 24 this year. what if i end up pissing away half of my twenties on minimum wage? because its not just about the jobs really. its about my life. i am incredibly pathetic human being. i'm the nerdy kid of lore, except i come in a prettier package. i'm overeducated, live at home, work at a dissatisfying job, have no social life, no love life. i'm not built for this, i hate stagnancy. and yet somehow i manage contentment. 

or maybe i should just move. i think i've got about ten to fifteen thousand dollars to my name, that's enough to just pick myself and move to new york or la. maybe transfer to a target out there until i find something better. but knowing me, a change of scenery no matter how glamorous, won't mean shit. i'll still be doing the same thing. i'll spend my friday nights watching youtube videos and dancing around with my headphones in. i really should've surrounded myself with more ambitious people growing up. i'm trying to do that now, but they don't seem that interested me. and the starving artists don't like me either because i'm too materialistic. i guess my only choice is to try build my own little space. which i guess is what i've been doing all along."

april's almost gone. i'm going to miss it. in particular, i'm going to miss miss april, she's been a big inspiration. but oh well, another month, another hot samarai lady to adorn my wall. 

a lot's been going on lately. been working a lot, but things look like they'll be slowing down in the next couple of weeks, i guess they've finally gotten around to hiring more people. which means more time for me to job hunt, do temp work, write, or you know bum around like usual. i had my first gynecological exam, not from a gyno though, from a midwife. she's very sweet and likable and generally did a stand up job, but i nonetheless felt kind of traumatized for almost two days afterward. took me a while to figure out why exactly, i approached it like a doctor's visit and its not like i'm that sheepish about strangers being up in my privates (imeanwhut). plus, like i said, she was great. eventually it occurred to me that it was probably because while i was approaching things in a civilized manner, my body was not. my body is not used to that kind of attention purely for medical purposes, and was totally prepped for a good times ahead and got let down hard. the sex beast in me felt violated. poor thing. but once i figured that out, i felt better. unfortunately, it seems i have a slightly problematic uterus. its tipped (woot), and after an ultrasound last week we know that i have a cyst on my left ovary (double woot), which would explain the weird cramping i get. i'll go in for another ultrasound in a month or two to see if its still there. i hope everything's fixable. i know these are minor, fairly common problems, but i'm getting the feeling that having a tipped uterus is going to be extremely, um, limiting. and i also think its the reason behind my acid reflux, since its kind of leaning on my rectum. go figure.

so when i haven't been working or getting my nethers probed, i have been watching lots and lot of avatar. its extremely addictive, and better for the most part than everything else i'm watching, including so you think you can dance australia and battlestar galactica. aside from doctor who, which just started up again, that's still awesome. though part of the reason why i started watching this show was to get myself amped for <i>the last airbender</i> movie, and its actually kind of doing the opposite. but i only vaguely care about the racial miscasting, the name changes, the storyline and character butchering that is clearly happening. all i really care about is the fight scenes. seriously, if the fight choreography is not as good as the show's (and we're talking about a nickelodeon animated show here people) than no amount of special effects will make me enjoy this movie. and sadly, based on the trailers, most of the martial arts looks like a lot of flailing, probably partly due to the use of slow mode, but still. there isn't going to be any cars or helicopters blowing up here, so there better be some good fights at least.

so may. may means vidal finishes his student teaching and graduates (and we get to go out to dinner to celebrate, squee). may marks two years since i graduated, which is kinda depressing. ah well. chin up. eyes on the prize. all that jazz."

"event","the change in the weather makes me aware of the things i want. new clothes, a reason to go outside. a new car because when i roll the windows down i can smell gasoline and hear all the awful noises the little runt makes. a new comforter because the one i have now (which i bought only a few months ago) is too warm and already getting torn up. there's one at target, lime green with white polka dots that i think will look nice in my room, especially since its only $30. and its not purple, which most of my room is. i'm decking my shit out with as much green as possible these days. 

i finished <i>children of the mind</i> and have moved on to ian mcdonald's <i>river of gods</i>. both sci-fi, but it is a welcome change of pace. <i>children of the mind</i> was just way too shiny. there was so much spiritual/metaphysical orgasming everywhere and then the two main couples trot off into the sunset, having gotten married without even sharing more than a kiss respectively. in the first couple of chapters of <i>river of gods</i>, you meet a gangster whose first act to endear you to him is to cut a woman down the middle and dump her in the river, a journalist who gets her rocks off watching a cage fight between two genetically engineered sabretooths, and a muslim politician who falls madly in love at first sight with a russian transsexual supermodel. sorry orson, but this is more of my bag. because really, even avatar has more grit than you do. and by avatar i mean the nickelodeon show, the last airbender, which i've just started the second season of. its makes me happy. that's really the only way i can describe it, when it started out it was very much a kid's show and obviously not very complex, but its expanded since then and nothing about it is disappointing. and then there's <i>battlestar galactica</i>, which is similarly addictive but probably more from the nervous tension and adrenaline it produces.

i had a stupid encounter the week before with a stupid man. he keeps texting me. i've already told him he's not going to get another shot for a while. he thinks he knows everything. the whole thing makes me wish i was born a man-hating lesbian. sometimes i think i am. if so, i'm awfully nice about it. when he asked me if i had done any writing recently (he made a guess that i was a ""writer,"" when i asked how he just said ""i can just tell,"" a phrase he uses a lot, though most of the time he can't) i said i did, but only that it was just nonsense, rather than about a previous encounter remarkably similar to ours. the part that's interesting to me is that he seems to get so much out of it, he says we had ""powerful chemistry,"" a feeling that is not at all mutual. it makes me curious about what other things i can make men feel about me without it being requited. 

easter was nice, lots of a food, grandma brought over a box of russel stover chocolates. i was never really aware of what a big deal easter is for most people until this year. there's so much candy and toys stocked in the seasonal section at target. for me it was the one day off i get in the middle of eight days of work. i'm so bored of my job. my emotions about target fluctuate, sometimes its anger, somtimes its complacency. right now its severe boredom, to the point where my subconscious is starting to rebel, calling out ""this is lame, let's do something else"" loudly enough that it does manage to slow me down sometimes. i want badly to do something else. i want to change with the weather. i may have to settle for just changing my hair."

i finally watched <i>solaris</i> friday night. the near 3-hour 1972 version, not the more recent and much shorter george clooney one (though that is on my netflix queue now). i wanted to watch it because the creators of <i>sunshine</i> cited it along with <i>alien</i>, and <i>2001</i> as one of the seminal sci-fi classics. but i knew that <i>solaris</i> was not nearly as universally loved as the other two, and that it was long and kinda boring. so it sat in its envelope for five freaking months. i considered sending it back without actually watching it - i should've just burned it, but i already deleted the software to do it because it was taking up too much space on my comp. but i finally got around to it, and yes it was long, and yes it was fucking boring as hell sometimes. when it started i realized that it was in russian and wasn't sure if i had it set to english subtitles or english dubbing, so i waited for someone to speak so i could tell. and i waited. and i waited some more. at one point there were like five to ten minutes spent on just cars driving down the totally not futuristic highway. at least in <i>2001</i> there was pretty music or visuals to eat up the time without dialogue or plot, and at least those moments meant something. why do we have to stare at grass floating in a lake? why does it take him so damn long to make his way around this damn space station and stare at absolutely nothing?

but despite all that, i actually found it really interesting. the concept of a planet-sized organism that can go into the minds of its investigators and manifest the people that bring them their greatest guilt was actually kind of on the back burner to the fact there were these people that were real, real as in flesh and blood and thinking and feeling, but weren't actually the people they thought they were, and most likely not even human, and were constructed purely to mess with the heads of these poor scientists. that's some mindfuckery right there. i think i'm going to read the book after i finish with <i>xenocide</i> and <i>children of the mind</i>, especially since the latter of those kind of has the same concept, even though i don't know how much because obviously i haven't read it yet. i just know that in it ender somehow brings to life regenerations of his siblings, which is essentially the same concept.

speaking of which, <i>xenocide</i> is pretty awesome. very talky, even moreso than <i>speaker for the dead</i>. but when the important stuff hits it hits like an emotional sledge hammer, and its particularly heavy because you're completely unaware of how emotionally invested you are until that happens. 

and i'm talking to christina about battlestar galactica and blade runner right now via text. and i've been watching darker than black and ergo proxy. i'm in an all out sci-fi mode right now. except for the fact that if <i>avatar</i> wins best picture tonight i'm gonna probably kick something."

"event","i'm in a more more more kind of state of mind. working out felt good, it came completely naturally, but i kept on feeling like i could do more. i got in the shower, and i kept on thinking of ways to keep myself in there for another five minutes, and another and another. and i've become obsessed with circle lenses, contacts that make your irises look bigger. the effect is surprisingly subtle, but i still think its awesome. i've recently reunited with <i>ender's game</i>, through the marvel comic that's based of it. i love that story so much its giving me a headache. the comic isn't as rich as the book, but the bones are still there, enough to remind me of how much i love the characters. and plus, i love just being able to <b>see</b> them for once. but its met with a bit of frustration, because even though i love reading as much as i can about peter, there isn't much of his in this adaptation, and the series that he was a main part of pretty much sucked. which has somehow latched onto my disappointment in the ending of <i>dollhouse</i>. so i'm just a whole big mess. i need to get my hands on <i>xenocide</i> and <i>children of the mind</i> as soon as possible, but i've already requested <i>dust and shadow: an account of the ripper killings by dr. john h. watson</i> from the library and should arrive in the next couple of days, which i figured was appropriate after reading <i>from hell</i> and seeing <i>sherlock holmes</i>. books. yum.

so its february, and the only sign of the upcoming holiday is my craving for sweets. we're going to make some brownies soon, and then some cupcakes or cake for superbowl sunday. vidal started his student teaching. he and i kind of have tangential schedules now, when he gets home from work is usually when i'm leaving. except for tomorrow, since i have first shift for once. he's got a bunch of auditions lined up for grad school, rutgers this friday, boston u the next, rochester the next. i'll be tagging along for boston, i'm working this friday though so i won't be able to for rutgers. i'm not interested in going up to rochester. from what i can tell, rutgers seems like the best financially. here's hoping it all works out for him, i only vaguely entertain the thought of grad school nowadays, because aside from hardly being interested anymore, the money just isn't there. but i wouldn't mind going back once i do manage to make some money of my own, depending on where i am. but i shouldn't be thinking about money and the future. 

saw <i>inglourious basterds</i> a couple weeks ago, put me into a tarantino tail spin, not unlike the ender one i'm going through now. i watched both volumes of <i>kill bill</i>, <i>pulp fiction</i>, and now have <i>death proof</i> and <i>jackie brown</i> at the top of my netflix queue (after disc 4 of season 1 of <i>dollhouse</i> of course). and i was giddy when he presented at the grammy's. he was exactly what he was - an awkward, dorky-looking middle aged white man who somehow manages an incredible, cartoonish kind of coolness. i don't get it, but i do love it, much like many of my great loves. man, i should just suck it up and write some echo/alpha fan fic. so in lieu of this completely all over the place ridiculous journal entry, here are some things that are making me happy right now.

"event","monday and tuesday of this week i did considerably more living than little old me is used to. as a result, going to work on wednesday was exponentially more depressing, as well as the hours since. i just don't like this, i can't stand this. i know that i'm lucky in some sense, that there are people struggling to find jobs even as meager as mine. but it just isn't right. dad keeps on saying little things about getting into target's management program, moving up with them. are you fucking kidding me? my parents compromised a lot with their careers. actually, they compromised completely. i understand where there point of view is coming from, but that's not what's going to happen here. i don't mind keeping a normal job while i work on writing on the side, but this isn't a normal job. its subnormal, its completely not worth the time and effort asked for. and why can't i get a normal job in my field? jesus christ, is it really so hard to get a job answering phones at a publishing company? a job like that would probably bring in twice as much income as target, and i would be doing a fraction of the work. i have a college degree goddammit *stamps feet and flails* its to the point where i just want to quit out of spite. and i am applying to jobs, jobs that are both within what i'm interested in and my qualifications i think - though that's a hard thing to judge, since i technically haven't had any full time administrative work. i applied to a job in san fransisco even. but i still feel the same as i did before. like i'm floating out in spsce, flinging at rocks at things, trying to get them to pay attention to me but everything falls short. i don't even know if i'm making any impression, let alone a good one. 

there was of course the good part of my week, which was meeting up with the guy from okcupid that i mentioned before. once again, no sparks, just good conversation and good food. but see even thinking about that depresses me, because then i remember what a glutton i was this weekend and the fact that my weight is up again and that my workout yesterday was rather painful. ugh. i'm working today, and tomorrow i do a temp job, working the front desk at some seminar in the bridgeport holiday inn. i have to be there by 7. i'm not looking forward to it, though okc guy and i have plans to go see a movie that evening. 

i'm sorry for being so angsty and redundant. things are just extremely frustrating right now, or rather they have been frustrating and i'm probably got some hormones raging so it feels considerably worse. i just need to tell myself that i am not doomed. when i first started applying to low level jobs when i got out of school the time frame i was thinking i would keep one before moving on was six months to a year. i'm about at seven months at target. if i hit a year, i think i'm going to quit, regardless of job prospects. its a little stupid, a year is when you're up for review for a raise, but for the sake of my sanity, i think that's how its going to go. in the meantime i'm going to work my ass off applying to jobs so that it doesn't come to that, somehow pretend that it all doesn't feel completely useless and feeble. just put the blinders on and keep running. and in the meantime, i'm going to try to get in as much living as i possibly can. this may be my circumstances right now, but i will not let it be my life."

"event","its a good thing i'm working in the morning tomorrow. i've used up my two days off like i planned to, but now i'm starting to feel restless. and oh right, this is the first post of the new year. happy 2010. the date passed without much consequence, i kind of felt like i didn't see it coming and wasn't entirely prepared. however, from the way things are going i feel like 2010 is going to be a productive year. i finally started <a href=""http://www.godisnarcissus.wordpress.com"">the blog</a> that i've been wanting to. after so many topics ran through my head over the past couple of months the one that finally got me writing was <i>inside</i>, a french horror flick i watched christmas day after everyone headed to bed. writing it felt incredibly good, though it was a struggle at points. i don't think i'll ever be the type to just bang out an entry in one sitting. but i do already have an idea for my next entry, and it'll be considerably shorter than the first.

so i don't do resolutions, though i've given it a shot the past couple years and each year i've failed miserably. however, while i don't want to make promises and then break them again, i do once again have some expectations of myself. i'm going to keep them simple though, not because i think that low of myself, but because simpler, smaller goals are just easier to wrap your head around. the first one i thought up while going through the new stock at work - wear my bikini more. that means getting out more, seeing the sun more, socializing more. a bunch of things all wrapped in one little idea, see how that works? next is write more, or as <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/saturninefilms"">cody weber</a> put it, create something everyday. i think this is a powerful and strangely humble goal. i don't know about everyday, but i want to make a promise to create more definitely. i have other ideas - i want to just get out more, fuck more, get a real job of course, a car, an apartment, a life. but i don't really want to think that way. i just want to make myself useful to world and to myself. the time i've spent since school ended i've felt like i don't exist. i don't want to continue that way.

i'm listening to music a guy off okcupid sent me - them crooked vultures, a new project from josh homme, dave grohl and john paul jones (as in from led zeppelin, yeah seriously). its cool shit. what is it with guys sending me music as courtship? its a nice trend, i gotta admit. this particular guy is from westport, has a degree in astrophysics and works as a tutor. we haven't talked too much yet, but i think i'm gonna get him to go to buffalo wild wings with me. i've been wanting to go back, and i need to learn to drive myself to the post mall anyway. and that reminds me, i've had my first experiences driving in snow this past months. its freaky and uncomfortable and makes me really want to do some car research so that i can get my own car soon. i love the gray saab that's gotten handed down to me, but the old bastard makes me nervous. i don't just want a car that's pretty though, i want to know how it works. that's another thing i need to work and hopefully very soon.

oh and there was christmas. it was very nice, i enjoyed it a lot. the work days up to it burned me out completely, so the holiday felt really damn good, and is probably why i didn't call back yesterday when i got a voicemail asking if i wanted to pick up more shifts (i'm guessing some of the holiday help has been let go, their problem, not mine). anyway, i got a pair of coach shoes and a tape deck to play my ipod in the aforementioned jalopy, which i had asked for. there were also some workout clothes, a gift card from uncle dan and ana, and faux leather bomber jacket from mom. i'm still torn about the last one. its pretty sexy, and does make me feel like the hipster i like to think i am sometimes, but i don't know if i would really wear it. *shrugs* i've also been buying a lot since then. today i used the gift card to get myself something from forever 21, and two t-shirts from hot topic. i've also ordered <a href=""http://www.calendars.com/Fantasy-Art/Luis-Royo-2010-Wall-Calendar/prod121518/?categoryId=cat00011"">this calendar</a>, and am anxiously awaiting its arrival. i felt like putting something sexy on my wall this year, if it didn't make me feel like i was sixteen, i would start decorating with pages from magazines again. i think i'm getting back to something basic and important in me, and that's really all i want, to feel like me again."

"event","there are still ghosts floating around in my header for this journal. i really should change it to something more festive, or at least more of the season. but i've been denial of the season, i refuse to acknowledge it. if summer and fall went by so fast, in theory winter should as well, but we still have january and february in front of us, how is that right? i want the world to speed by me right now, i'm standing still so why not? i really am not going to do new year's resolutions this year, the changing of the date doesn't mean much to me this year, its the changing of the season that's important to me. let's get more in touch with the moving of the earth rather than the moving of digits. but i do plan on getting a calendar this year so i can keep track of things better. i need to get a life, stalking people on myspace, seeing their spring break pictures and tattoos makes me even more aware of this. okcupid hasn't really been working that well for that, maybe i should try finding people in the area through similar interests rather than match percentages. maybe i'll try some of the iamx forums i've been avoiding. 

a lot has been going on actually, i've been meaning to post for a while. rachel garcia died, a cousin of the dejesus'. i've know her and her brother and sister since they were babies, though lately we generally only saw them once a year when drew and cook would visit from florida. they were here a couple months ago actually, we all ate dinner and watched tennis together, and rachel and i talked about her required reading for school. she fell in the shower. its horrible and unfair, it could happen to anyone, hell it could've happened to me or someone in my family, but instead it happened to a twelve-year-old girl and hers. 1300 people came to her wake. i didn't because it was black friday, and we didn't find out what had happened until the day of. the funeral was the day after, mom and dad went, they got there an hour and half in advance and managed to get seats in the last rows. afterwards they went to my dad's cousin uli's 50th birthday party, while i folded baby clothes at target through a headache. 

i downloaded 30 seconds to mars' new album, <i>this is war</i>. i downloaded it, even though i had bought their previous two, because i straight up didn't think it would be very good. their debut was important to me, it had a mission, a message. the second album lacked that strength, it was good music but it was mostly angsting and whining. no more fists in the air. of course, the title of the new album implies they're back to their old selves. and they are partially. ""night of the hunter"" in particular has that aggression and power, it may even surpass the first album's atmosphere. lyrically the rest of the songs make an effort, but the approach musically is a little softer. though that's not necessarily a bad thing. the included the voices of their fans in my many of the tracks, chanting and shouting. it makes me badly want to go to a concert, i know how cult-like their fanbase is, and i think it would be amazing to go to a show where the audience actually has a part in the songs. one of the standouts is ""hurricane"" a song featuring kanye west, of all people. its not a battle song, like the rest of the record, well maybe a little, but its mostly emotional, about relationships and all that jazz, but its still powerful but has the same understated quality as <i>808s and heartbreaks</i> that worked so well. but my call to arms is ""stranger in a strange land."" that is the greatest thing they've ever done. it is exultant and erotic and visceral. you could fuck to that song, pray to it, go to war to it. its interesting comparing it to <i>the fame monster</i>, because while lady gaga is pop her album is much darker. and while i like the dark, sometimes its just nice to listen to music that makes you feel good, and that's what <i>this is war</i> does for me. gaga is like early iamx - she's digging into the human condition and carving out delicious beats. now iamx is starting to go the way of mars and muse and putting his fist in the air and asking us to fight. i imagine gaga will be doing the same very soon if she isn't already."

"event","for some silly reason i was looking forward to thanksgiving this year. most likely because i've been working consistently, and i want a day of food and festivities. there was an also an added bonus because we switched up the formula this year. grandma didn't join us, so mom and dad decided to try a recipe for an award winning turkey that called for a bunch of pepper, cumin, and three heads of garlic. it was potent, and delicious. i don't usually stuff myself at thanksgiving because its typically not my favorite kind of food, but this time i couldn't even finish my slice of pumpkin pie at the end of the meal. 

so of course with my new found excitement for the holiday, i had to turn it into a typical holiday drama, straight from primetime tv. it even started with a conversation about such, where mom was telling about how on the recent episode of <i>trauma</i>, a gay character talked about his desires to come out to his family which always seem to surface around the holiday when they get together. which got me off on a thing about how heteronormativity in media and tv bothers me, and gay people in our everyday lives, and it became impossible to continue the conversation without just saying i'm bi. not something i was planning on doing, not ever in fact. i figured they'd find out when i brought home a girl home one day, which in the back of mind i knew was cruel. maybe i really was afraid of their reaction, or maybe i do just view it as no big deal. i think its more like i didn't want to come out without evidence to back it up, which i don't have now; or the ability to hold to my convictions without sounding like a whiny 14 year old. i expected them to tell me that i should be more discrete, and i thought i was prepared to say no, i want to live my life honestly and openly, but i apparently am not. and i'm not going to lie, it feels kind of weird to try to put my foot down on that when my bedroom is still next to theirs. i'm not living independently yet, so who am i to draw a hard line on something that may effect them? i even found myself saying ""well i'm not that young anymore"" when mom started with ""well a lot of young girls..."" i'm a little upset about how things went, but i was kind of upset about admitting it to myself even. i didn't like to think of myself as not normal, so how can i blame them for it? but i got used to it, and while i'm still not thrilled with having to label myself as an ""other,"" i like this identity, it sits easier on me than the old one. maybe it'll do the same for them. but more than that i just wanted them to know that while i am not gay, gayness is part of who i am and what i'm interested in and the way i look at the world and they ought to get used to it if they haven't felt so inclined already. so even though i didn't really want to do this now, now is better than later, and at least i don't have to wonder anymore. 

so on a lighter but related note, i bought the fame monster at fye before work, and after i got home at 11:30 that night i rocked out to it for two hours. (it'll probably be the last physical cd i buy, because as it turns out my cd player doesn't work anymore, lol.) its brilliant, i love nearly every second of it. ""monster"" is deliciously 80s, as is ""dance in the dark"" though the latter is harder in the verses and softer in the chorus, which still throws me off a bit, its probably my least favorite song even though its still awesome and i even felt a little emotional towards the end of it. my favorite right now ""so happy i could die."" it makes me want to really learn how to dance, it combines the old 80s italo sound with a more modern hip hop vibe which is fucking amazing. and lyrically i love gaga for writing it, which i feel about ""dance in the dark"" too. ""teeth"" will probably be in next season's ads for <i>true blood</i>, its a pretty sexy, gritty song with a totally different sound. there's ""speechless,"" a bowie-esque ballad, which i'm not that into because i don't like pop music for the ballads, but is still very good. and ""telephone"" is a raver, thrashing, move your hips until your abs are sore rock out dance track, so perfectly and thoroughly produced there is no way it won't be a huge hit. its my soundtrack right now, and when its not, adam lambert fills in the gaps.

also, in regards to popular culture, but with considerably less heft, i saw <i>new moon</i> with one of my coworkers on tuesday. it was pretty bad, though i can't say it was a complete waste of time because i was entertained. my butt never felt numb, and i never felt bored. but other than ogling taylor lautner, there was no real pay off, no substance, nothing to gain from it. just fluff.

next week is going to be a light workload, only fifteen freaking hours, the first week of a holiday shopping season, i don't know what these people are on. i plan on watching movies, going to the gym, and writing, as long as office team doesn't call me for anything. i'm working black friday, as well as this weekend, maybe i'll start doing deep breathing exercises to ward off a nervous breakdown. i keep on thinking about a job applied to, administrative assistant in the waterbury court house. i want it badly - 40k salary, state benefits, a normal, real fucking job. yesterday i was so on edge at work that i could see myself just walking out. maybe they'll fire me after the holidays, because i don't think anyone sees me as particularly good at my job, even the ones that like me. i'm just sick of the environment. as mad as i am at my crush for leaving me behind, i envy her more than anything. she got out, she has a plan. i never did, just some ideas, as always."

"event","today is my first day off in six days. tomorrow i've got a job for davis studio's at hallen elementary in bridgeport. i plan to bring disinfectant, along with a book to read. the only reason i took the job was because its not the same kind of work as target, there'll probably be a lot of downtime. in target news, i'm generally working around 35 hours a week now on average. i'm considering changing my availability to only mornings except for a few days so that i could have, you know, a life. my crush has also done a bunk on me and left. i'm quietly devastated, more than i'd like to admit actually. i was planning on writing the whole thing out, but halfway through realized that it really did make a good story even when nothing happened, so that's what i'm going to do. i want to fictionalize it, so that i can exaggerate some things, take a different approach than typical nonfiction, but i feel extremely self-conscious about it. i feel a bit like i'm taking something that doesn't belong to me. there's also that with target being my world right now, i have developed this paranoia that all who work there see and judge everything i do. even the stuff that only my computer could possibly see. i've been thinking about changing my hair, coloring it or cutting it, and i found myself not wanting to because the only people who would see it would be my family and every one at target. i could do it for myself, but i don't need anymore than a studded belt and make-up to keep me happy. i really desperately need a life.

i was reading over some of my old stuff from nonfiction class. it came about because i watched the original <i>halloween</i> recently, so i wanted to compare my reaction to what i wrote about the new version. i really don't like my writing from back then much, which is a little disturbing because i can't imagine that i have written enough in the time since then to have improved that much. and everyone seemed to like that stuff at the time, even i did. the nonfiction style strikes as me too snarky, too satirical to suit me, which is probably why i want to turn this recent experience into a work of fiction. this girl made me want to start writing again. if she had stuck around a little longer, she might've even gotten some poetry out of me. so now i'm just going to steal the idea of her and make her into a character. it feels wrong, almost disrespectful, but if i do it right i think i could make something great. i just have to shoo away those imaginary eyes that keep hovering over my shoulder and i can start. 

for all those not paying attention, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACm9yECwSso"">the video for ""bad romance"" is out</a>. i feel like its a bit rougher around the edges than the other videos, there are so many different seemingly unrelated scenes and visuals, but i like the story from what i can discern. gaga is a newborn monster (her in the tub, nearly naked with big doe eyes and twitchy uncoordinated fingers) who is kidnapped and dolled up for a cynical and perverted viewing audience. she's sold to the highest bidder, but not realizing the monster she is, she fucking blows his mind. we of course see the clues throughout the video - we see her as the greedy narcissist, in black before a mirror; we see her naked, pure human side as well as several different forms of her monstrous alien side. and it all adds up to her bursting into flames and leaving a crispy black bed and skeleton behind, which made me laugh. i want to always think of myself that way, as a newborn monster, a sum of many parts but ultimately whole and unbreakable. as for the song, i love it, but i'm not as addicted to it as i thought i would be. i'm kind of preferring the italo, ace of base reminiscent ""alejandro."" i'm excited for the new album, it'll be another record that i'm actually willing to shell out money for. though its probably going to get pre-ordered from amazon, because i'm not so nostalgic that i want to wander over to fye to get it."

"event","in the past week or so my k-pop obsession reached new heights, halloween came and went with a little less attention than the changing of the clocks, grandma's surprise party went off extraordinarily well, and my aunt and uncle from california were here for six days and were wonderful company and made us wonderful food. on the down side, the computer's back in the shop, mom lost her engagement ring, and vidal may or may not have swine flu. woot.

being back in grandma's church was bizarre. there were faces and rooms and walls i remembered distinctly, but everything was so much smaller than i remembered. the night before mom was kind of freaking out because things were very much not going according to plan, but when we got there in the morning we were able to set up with plenty of time and surprise grandma by showing up for the sermon. it was a pretty awesome place, not gonna lie, a much better experience than being in a catholic church for emily's wedding. the walls were a barren white, and aside from the stained glass windows there was one work of art and that was the painting of christ on the cieling, which i remember being slightly disturbed by as a kid, i think mostly because the wonky proportions the curved ceiling gave to jesus' head. the sermon itself was enthusiastic and passionate, there were tambourines being shook and the pastor's wife danced down the aisle with a red sash. and i wasn't completely out of the loop because they had earpieces for an english translation, which wasn't very good honestly but at least i knew what was going on. the chunk of the talk was about eagles, and how people often remain in their nest all their lives without allowing god to teach them how to fly. i always find it interesting when people relate faith to freedom, and non-belief to close-mindedness. it reminds me a bit of john donne, but with less awareness obviously. but anyway, afterward, everyone headed downstairs for the party. there were three delicious cakes from costco (seriously amazing cake), and not enough mini sandwiches for everybody but it worked. i got to see lourdes, marsial and david for the first in fucking ever. lourdes looked exactly the same, maybe she sleeps in formaldehyde i don't know, and marsial and david were totally recognizable despite being much taller and differently shaped than when we last saw them, especially david. 

there were plenty of people who said they knew me when i was little but i didn't remember. plenty of people that commented on my resemblance to grandma, based on the old pictures of her we put up on bulletin board there. i don't see it exactly, though i recognize that thing about my smile that i dislike. i also got comments about how i look younger than i am, which i've been hearing for a little while and it still weirds me out. i know that with people like myself who got mistaken for older when they were young get it turned around later in life, but i didn't think it would happen so soon. one woman said i looked fifteen, how is that possible? when i actually was fifteen people said i looked 21. i hear it a lot at work, but i don't mind if people think i'm 19 there, that way people will wonder less.

i weighed in at 126.4 yesterday. again, i'm not sure how, though it'd be nice to think that its my trips on the elliptical at planet fitness. i like going there, i get cravings to go, and it annoys me that my work schedule keeps me from going. i'm working around 37 hours a week now, and while i have the mornings to myself i would be too burnt out after exercising to spend the next eight hours hours on my feet. but i'm going to try keep up with the ab exercises i learned - from the personal trainer who graduated from shelton high three years after i did - and get back into the habit of exercising while i watch the view in the mornings, if i can stomach elizabeth for more than ten minutes."

"event","a little while ago, i heard one of my coworkers talking about her crush on another coworker, her anxiety about not being his type and whether he could possibly have feelings for her. i listened to her and thought to myself ""god, i so do not miss that."" crushes usually involve maybe a week or two of giddiness at finding someone you're interested in, and the rest is just endless pining and angst. i found myself looking back on some of the crushes i had in college and high school today - so much wasted energy, i don't know how my brain didn't explode. not that i'm incapable of it now, in fact i do have a sort of semi-crush on a coworker. wouldn't even call it a crush really, just a vague smirking intrigue that amuses me more than anything. it'd be kind of funny if anything happened there. a good story at least. but i have no interest in wistfully following someone with my eyes or painting pictures of picket fences in my head. i'm having a good time the way things are.

my birthday was last week and with it came october and some cool weather. we ate out at bertucci's and my cake was shaped shaped like a reese's peanut butter cup.
<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/drunkencarousal/pic/00038672/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/drunkencarousal/pic/00038672/s320x240"" width=""180"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>
it was very sweet, but i think i prefer the more traditional kind of ice cream cake. but no matter, plenty of birthdays coming up. grandma paquita's 90th is nov 2, and mom, her brother and grandma's friend aida have been trying to put together a party that won't frighten her. so far they're not succeeding, because the guest count at the moment is rather overwhelming. grandma doesn't fair well with surprises, but we can't tell her about the party or she'll just make up some excuse to not go at the last minute. should be an interesting day in any case.

mom and dad bought me a membership to planet fitness as my birthday present. i've been so focused on my strong desire to burn calories and make some muscle, that i temporarily forgot about my anxiety about gyms and exercise equipment. and now its giving me a headache. i went there today to scope the place out and the woman giving me the tour wasn't really that informative. at least the guy who showed me around at the edge was good looking. i guess i'll get over it somehow because i badly want to get into shape.

i watched <i>wild at heart</i> last night. way better than i expected it to be, and fairly straight forward for a lynch film. nonetheless, i've requested my old textbook from my comparative directors class from the library (i'm still mad at myself for selling that book back) so i can get a more solid idea of what the hell was going on. but just watching the movie and commentary reminded me of the principles david lynch runs on, and its funny that its so similar to a conversation i've been having on okcupid. the whole concept of letting go of the ego, of our structures. the conversation started with <i>island</i>, and now she's told me that there are people who use the whole mutual adoption club concept. it kind of blew my mind that there are communities here that act on those principles, i thought it would always just be a dream i would have."

"event","i've been doing some existential remodeling. and by that i mean, remodeling in small materialistic ways that have a positive existential effect on me. kind of like putting on more make-up when you're in a bad mood so you feel a little prettier and thus better. i put the new comforter on the bed - its purple and green and has lots of velor, which i've realized isn't that comfortable on bare skin directly after a shower, but is still nice to pet every once in a while. i'm thinking of joining the edge up the street in shelton square. i want megan fox's waistline, or at least to get my buns and thighs to stop jiggling. i'm curious if its possible for me to ever be happy in a pair of skinny jeans, or if it won't matter what size i get down to, they just aren't shaped for legs like mine. i've also been researching tattoo parlors. i like excalibur downtown, and i was tempted to check it out in person when i was out dropping off a library book earlier but i couldn't work up the nerve. maybe tomorrow. i think next on the list is a new journal layout, something that reflects the new season. its good to be in new england in the fall, everything's so pretty. at target i get the merchandise effect - orange and black striped knee socks, shelves of halloween candy and decorations. can't complain about not feeling the vibe now, even if it is slightly off-set by the christmas lights on the back shelf. there is of course an aspect to the fall that comes strictly from academia and youth. eight days from now i'll be 23. did i mention i bought a pair of thigh high socks? i need more of them, and some skirts for them to go with. 

we've figured out what may be the source of our internet problems, why the tv and internet connect would crap out all of sudden and most of the time in the evening. its the lights. when we turn on the living room light, the tv freezes, turn it off, it comes back. turn it on as well as the family room light, or the front porch light, and the tv remains fine. our energy saving bulbs may be saving us a bit on our electrical bill, but apparently they're creating power surges that cause the cable tower to fail (the guy from at&t who came last night confirmed it). go figure. so much for us being carbon efficient. 

i don't read much these days. <i>lolita</i> took me forever to get through. its a great book for its main character and its pitch perfect portrayal of how powerful lust and emotion is, not to mention how wonderful his use of words is. as chris corner said earlier today in his most recent blog post, ""science and emotion are gods. that is all."" but it is kind of boring book at parts. i was going to watch the movie again after i finished it, but i haven't been so inclined. i was going to watch <i>towelhead</i> yesterday - which is of the same vein, in case you were wondering why that came up - but that's when we figured out the lights/internet/tv thing, so i decided to watch the premieres of bones and house that i had recorded instead. i have been writing a lot though, i use my breaks at work to write in a old notebook that i hadn't used in a while. i had a couple pages of the novel idea i had, and then i switched to a short story idea that i don't know how i'm going to manage to finish. i find when i write i kind of fall in love with my own handwriting, and try to make it as neat looking as possible. of course, once i get more excited about the actual subject matter, the script turns to shit i feel almost disgusted by it. i wish i had a little portable word processor, a computer that allowed me to do nothing but write. i think there'd be a decent market for that in college students, don't you?"

"event","i need some perspective, i think working in retail is making me myopic. 8.25 an hour is not worth this kind of angst. i feel bipolar, one second i'm blissful because i've managed a shift where no one has rubbed me the wrong way, but as soon as something does not go according to plan, i want to hide in a hole for the next ten years. my brain keeps making me mumble to myself almost incoherently, trying to find the right keyword to make it all better. for what its worth, last week was indeed very good, and that had less to do with work and more to do with what i did with my time off. went window shopping on tuesday, met up with a guy on wednesday, friday i dressed st joseph's senior girls in their drapes for their school portraits for $9 an hour and then that evening went to see <i>9</i> with d. by friday night i was floating, and then two days later i'm in the dumps again. it isn't right, its stupid of me to let trivial shit get to me, but its hard when you've got nothing else. you do feel closed off when you're working in a place like target, maybe its the monochromatic color scheme, but you lose focus of the outside world. you don't have to be your job, but i don't feel like much of anything otherwise, so what else can i do.

lets stop brooding and talk about entertaining things. the season finale of true blood was last night, but so was the women's us open final and the vmas. i recorded the vmas, watched the match and hoped that i could get a decent download of true blood by tomorrow morning. the last one worked according to plan, it was downloading when i went to bed and i watched it first thing. as for the women's match, i got to see the first set and then our tv crapped out yet again, despite having at&t come several times in the past couple days to fix our problems. so i didn't get to see clijsters win, just a few glitchy images of her celebrating. and as for the vmas, my recording probably got messed up by the tv cutting out, i haven't checked yet. all i'm hoping is that i got lady gaga's performance. oh hell, i'll probably end up watching it off youtube in a minute anyway. 

but anyway, true blood. the season was kind of lame and i've realized that now that with bill's marriage proposal their is a very solid divorce from the canon of the book and the canon of the show, i really am not that attached to the characters in the show at all. every fangirl and her brother has been obsessed with  eric/askars, but while i like looking at him and the character's kind of interesting, i am really not that attached. i wasn't even that crazy about him in the books, i only found him interesting in the context of his relationship with sookie. its kind of weird to be surrounded by all the crazy hype of fandom and suddenly realize that you're not nearly as rabid. and to another form of media, <i>9</i> was very good. a little cheesy, i guess that's a requirement of animated films even when they are very obviously marketed towards adults. but it had a lot of cool ideas and images, i have a feeling the creators had aspirations to go much bigger and deeper, but weren't able to either because of budget constraints or pressure from the studio to keep it mainstream. good flick though, maybe i'll be able to keep this friday night movie thing going with <i>jennifer's body</i> coming out this weekend. 

i don't want to set myself any more goals. i'm tired of failing. dad keeps saying its important, but so far it hasn't worked. i just want to do things, be mindful and in the moment. i should start exercising in the mornings, but not because i want to get in shape but just because i want to run. i should finish these stories that i've been writing, not because i want to be a world famous writer but because i want to write and feel the natural flow of words. negative capability, the only clever thing keats came up with. wednesday afternoon i had a moment where i think i was the closest to being in the moment as i've ever been, and i want to try it again, but go further. stop thinking so much and just be."

"event","the coolest/strangest thing happened in a dream i had. it was this morning, just before i woke up, and the sound of the cicadas outside started infiltrating my half-asleep brain. the story was something dark, having to do with gangsters or something, partly inspired by <i>lolita</i> probably another part by the vampire royalty of the sookie stackhouse books. in it a man, just as he seems to be about to shoot a woman in the head for attempting to defile his favorite girl, starts making a sound. it was something like ""idkee idkee idkee,"" i don't remember that well i was half-asleep after all, but he says it faster and faster until it blends together into the sound of the cicadas. at which point i realized i was awake. so for a while i laid there, listening to the sound, trying to break it down the same way my subconscious did into a simple onomatopoeia and i kind of heard it and i kind of didn't. it amazes me that my dream state could do something so easily, that normally no one would ever notice.

when i took the job at target, i was happy that i would no longer have to waste my job hunting time on low level hourly jobs. i could work to work while i hunted for something i really wanted. now i'm thinking that that may not be the case. i'm not going to be looking for something at stop & shop, mind you. but all those administrative jobs, that i thought would be good to hold me over but wasn't really interested in committing to, those are back on the table. the target job is just as i said before - work to work, its easier to get a job when you have a job. its almost not even worth the money, except for short term goals like the external hard drive i just bought myself. but an apartment? a car? grad school? not likely. i need to get out of there as soon as i'm able, but no sooner. i've gotten a taste of what its like to actually do something with your time, and another couple of months of unemployment would drive me crazy at this point. i was actually formally reprimanded for spacing out on the job, a weak moment i admit, but target's tendency to exaggerate irritates me. a lot of things about this job irritate me. i spent months shoving down the clawing despair that came with joblessness, smiling and dancing through it all, and who would've thought that the thing that would give that little monster an edge would actually be a job. 

i've been quite the perv lately, and unfortunately for the guys i talk to online, its not directed towards the opposite sex. the influence comes a lot from <i>lolita</i>, which i'm reading/rereading now, but really its just the coincidence of that book and that its the end of the summer. target is filled with pubescent girls, still wearing their summer clothes, gossiping, shopping and preparing for school. one was called adrianne, and had jet black hair, olive skin that looked like it hadn't seen the sun at all in the past four months, and a skinny skinny overbearing mother. adrianne was a little rounder, much shorter and just as surly. she wore a white long tank top that covered her short shorts, making it look like she had walked out of the house in a undershirt, which i'm sure was the intention. dangerous things, these girls, swaying their butts in front of men who are waiting outside the fitting room for the wives to finish changing, and never paying me any mind. next week i have a one day temp job for thursday, assisting the school photographer at st. joseph's high. is it weird that i thought it would be fun? i want to be around young people right now. i used to watch school buses go by and feel like they were just these doomed yellow torpedoes. that's still there, but a corrupted youth has its own kind allure, one that's more palatable in girls. boys are more pure, they are what they are for the most part, but girls are always trying to put something on, be someone else. the space between the little girl and the disguise she comes up with is the interesting part."

it is warm and sticky and the last of my three days off in a row this week. target called yesterday, asked if i could fill in for people that evening. i said no, that i had plans, and those plans were eating a nice salmon dinner with mom and dad (didn't say that part, obviously). but i grew bored by the end of the night and regretted it, probably should've told them i'd be there in an hour so i'd have time to eat and then go. ah well, next time. mom says i need some financial goals, which is true. i don't go out enough to really need/want a car. i of course want to move out but that's not as finite of a goal, as in save this much and you can get an apartment. rent is a consistent payment, i would need a much better salary. but mom says i could work on the car thing now, so that when i do end up moving out/getting a better job, i won't be paying for all those things at once. plus i should start building up my credit. ah being an adult. how glamorous. 

i have nothing to read. i was hoping to read <i>lolita</i> next but its checked out from the library. i should just suck it up and request something. i've been watching lots of tv though. off my computer that is. christina brought me <i>doctor who</i> when she came up, and i've already made it to the third season. i always started watching the <i>the riches</i> via hulu though i'm having the same problem with it that i did originally - far too much second-hand embarrassment. i love it for the characters, but i don't know if i can handle two seasons worth of it. i'm basically watching it for noel fisher anyway, who is wonderful and almost entirely makes up for all the moments i have to cringe away from the screen. i also made a point to go down his history on imdb and watch all of those episodes he's been in of <i>law and order</i>, <i>standoff</i> and so on. well, not all of them, i heard his character on <i>svu</i> was lame so i only watched the end of his story arch, and it was indeed very lame. and that was all after i had seen a movie he did <i>red</i>, as well as his episodes of <i>life</i>, <i>the mentalist</i>, and <i>bones</i>. its kind of frustrating being randomly obsessed with a rather small time actor. but i said it in <lj comm=ontd_trublud> and i'll say it again here, please someone send his resume to alan ball, please. he got deborah ann woll her break (and she was on <i>the mentalist</i> and <i>life</i> too), noel's has been a long time coming.

i did have something substantial to say, just so you know. i come up with these random tidbits here and there. maybe twitter isn't such a bad idea. i could get all my little moments of glory out right away, instead of trying to save them for an lj post, and by the time i get around i've forgotten them. but there was one thing i do remember - that when i was folding tables in the infants section in target last week, and found cans of peanut butter cookies amongst the onesies, i remembered suddenly how i used to hide things between the clothes at department stories as a little kid. i don't remember what, pieces of candy maybe or toys that i picked up at other places in the store. my little surprise presents. but instead of silently commiserating with the store employees who had to clean up after me, i was pleased to realize that my child self undoubtedly accomplished her goal. and it is for this reason that i am probably not good for retail, or any corporate environment, because there will always be that little kid in me that wants to undermine it, that wants to surprise everybody. maybe that's the part of me that wants to go into work with dramatic make-up, that can't help grinning when mom expresses her confusion as to why anyone would want a tattoo. ah. that's a good financial goal. not that a single paycheck couldn't take care of that, but once at least i've saved enough to feel comfortable forking over a couple hundred dollars for some ink. my birthday perhaps. a present for myself."

"event","after my first two weeks at target, a whopping total of 28 hours of work, i found myself experiencing an existential panic that crept forward every time i passed baker's on the way to food court. all those pretty platform shoes and their extravagant straps and buckles taunted me as i went to buy myself lunch, saying ""this will never be you."" not that one can define themselves by the shoes they wear, but they can by the jobs they have, which is a sad thing about our culture, but who else are you but what you do for a living when its monday through friday, 9 to 5. so i decided to rectify the problem by painting my nails for the first time in years, a meager attempt but it helped a little. i've been experimenting with make-up a little bit too and just bought some lip color today at walmart. i can at least make myself feel a little pretty, even in khaki pants and a name tag.

so i had a second date with another guy from okcupid. its rather strange - he's good looking, we have a lot in common and we get along. but when i'm not talking to him, i don't think about him much. and when i am around him, i find myself assessing him in a far too objective manner - that he would fit in nicely with my group of friends and whatnot. but other than that there isn't much draw. it makes me wonder if i'm capable at all of being attracted to someone who is within grasp. it also makes me feel like a tease since i keep agreeing to see these guys when my intentions end up being purely platonic, but it seems silly to dismiss what could be a good friendship. 

christina was here last weekend and we saw <i>half-blood prince</i>, went for walks and talks and watched a lot of doctor who, which i actually rather enjoy. <i>half-blood prince</i> was probably the most forgettable of all the harry potter movies. there was some great imagery and shot composition, and the acting was surprising fantastic, tom felton nearly stole the show. but for a story that was already extremely difficult to adapt to the screen, they took a completely wrong approach to remedying that problem. there was no rising action or climax, and all the plot points were barely strung together effectively, if at all. when it was originally announced that there weren't going to include the battle at hogwarts, i understood their original reasoning, but now having seen the movie i can't understand why professional film makers would make such a odd decision. sure the last movie needs its climax, but so does this one. but overall, i didn't feel particularly strongly about it. like i said, it was forgettable, though to me that is the worst thing a film can be.

i also saw <i>public enemies</i> on my date last night. it was an enjoyable time, i liked watching johnny depp and he did well with the character. it had an almost slice of life feel to it, which was probably accentuated by the hi-def cinematography. spill.com's review of it claimed that it glorified dillinger too much and demonized the investigators chasing him, but i just thought it made him seem normal. an ordinary man doing what comes naturally to him. the fame that he had in the public eye was only touched on a few times and never overwhelming. and for the bad behavior on the part of the good guys, i just saw that as a result of the newly forming organization that would be fbi that had yet to define its character and policies. not to mention that the two sides seem to parallel each other - the criminal sociopath nelson with the investigator who is far too enthusiastic during interrogations. so the movie wasn't the best thing i've ever seen, but feel like it did have a purpose and an objective, and it was fun to watch."

so i am now officially employed by target as a soft lines team member. means i work the floor, organizing the clothes racks. i didn't really know how much that entailed, it seems like a pretty lazy job, but when half the stock is going on clearance there is in fact a lot to do. and best of all, it doesn't interfere with the harry potter plans. i'll be able to see it this saturday with everybody and hopefully christina will be able to come up for it too. oh and i have a lunch date for tomorrow, guy i met on okcupid. been talking to him for a couple weeks, pretty cool, cute, and local. i kind of wish we could've met today, but he had work. plans plans plans, and here i am bored out of my mind.

my anticipation for <i>half blood prince</i> is at a kind of weird level. i couldn't maintain the momentum of excitement from last fall when it was originally supposed to come out, so now that its near and here i'm just kind of mildly looking forward to it. i've avoided most of the preview clips, and mostly skim reviews though i know they're mostly very positive, one suggesting that it could be an oscar contender now that best picture will now have ten nomination slots to fill rather than five. but then jim texts me last night as soon as he got out of the midnight showing (btw, being woken up by a text and falling abruptly back to sleep can be the trippiest thing sometimes, you wake up the next morning feeling like you talked to someone but can't remember when or how) saying simply ""hated it."" even <lj user=buttfacemakani>'s review was rather lukewarm. she said she enjoyed herself, but didn't seem terribly moved. so i'm just going to keep myself at this nice neutral level, and look forward to it for the social aspect.

i'm told writing down your goals is a big important step in seeing them come to light. so i'm going to try doing that instead of letting it stew around in my head. i want to write a novel. ok fine, i'm going to. its kind of an odd desire even though its something i wanted/planned to do through most of my adolescence, but i never had any good ideas. i thought i did, but i really really didn't, and then of course i lost interest pretty fast. but this one i think i can do. it is character driven, yes, but there's enough layers going on to create a central storyline. the concoction of outside sources that is continuously happening in my brain finally came together in a way that i can actually use as my own (i'm not ashamed to say i steal my ideas from other people, how do you think progress happens?), but even though its underdeveloped right now i'm still trying to keep it loose. i want to be able to surprise myself. if i know the story too well before i start writing, the real thing will never live up to the standard i create up in my head, and i'll decide its better off staying up there. which means i should get started very soon. maybe that's what i'll do with my afternoon, though i still don't feel like sitting around much. jesus it isn't even three o'clock yet."

so after about two months of it sitting in the netflix envelope, i finally brought myself to watch <i>martyrs</i>, which i had heard about through rich from <a href=""http://www.fourfour.typepad.com"">fourfour</a>. i was a tad disappointed in myself - many of the die hard fans of this movie say that it's best to watch when you know as little about it as possible, going in a virgin as the director said in his introduction. but they also said it was one of the most horrifying movies ever made, and i am bad with the horror movies as much as i love them, so i needed to be sure. so i spoiled myself by reading rich's post about it in full, and even though he had to tell the whole story to properly discuss it, i was effectively convinced that i needed to see it. and now seemed like an appropriate time for it. i've been reading a slew of vampire books, i've started reading j.g. ballard's <i>crash</i>, which the david cronenberg movie was based off of. sick and disturbing things seems to be the kick that i'm on, so i figured it was as a good a time as any. 

and honestly, the gore and violence is not what effects you about <i>martyrs</i>, though it does make you want to dig your nails into your own skin to stop it from crawling. see, the reason why <i>the ring</i> had such a nasty effect on me was because it was so unnervingly scary but had no substance. its like being beaten and left out in the rain for no reason. but with <i>martyrs</i>, everything had meaning, every bit of blood spatter and gore and violence had weight behind it. there was nothing gratuitous about it, everything had a purpose. it is for torture porn what <i>funny games</i> was for family siege suspense thrillers, except while <i>funny games</i> made its point by taking away reason, <i>martyrs</i> does it by laying it on thick. and that's what's so disgusting, that's what makes you angry. and its what i'm looking for in my movies, especially horror. i was freaked out enough that i had a really hard time sleeping the night after but i didn't regret watching it at all - hell, i watched parts of it over again, though i restrained myself because i didn't want a repeat of that night. when i watched <i>funny games</i>, i was disturbed while watching but it went out of my mind as soon as it was over. that's a consequence of making a self-reflexive film (or meta, as the cool kids are calling it now), you point out what you're doing and it takes the viewer out of the film. but <i>martyrs</i> is all about dragging you in and keeping you there, making you understand what it is to be a victim in the first part of the film where you are dunked headfirst into a girl's severely damaged brain, and then what it is to be a martyr (as its defined in this story, which is not the typical use of the word, otherwise i wouldn't like this movie nearly as much) through the girl that tries to save her. in so many horror and torture porn films, the violence is purely for the viewer's benefit - they come up with creative and bizarre ways to fuck people up physically for your entertainment, to keep you guessing as to how far they're going to take it. this film doesn't try to do that, its not about getting your blood thirsty rocks off, its out to show you what it really takes to completely ruin someone, which as it turns out is not a hell of a lot. but it makes you understand the despair that it induces, its both in the moment, in that it spares you none of the graphic details, and in the aftermath at once. i don't know, its one of those movie's i really feel like i have nothing to say that the movie doesn't already (imagine what i'd think if i really had gone into a virgin). so if you feel like you can handle it, don't read anything else about it, just download it or put it at the top of your netflix queue right now.

and not surprisingly, i've managed to combine this input into my obsession with andre and the southern vampire mysteries. i really wish i could stop fixating on characters so much, i want to be one of those fantasy writer's that come up with elaborate worlds and stories where the characters are an afterthought - the kind of stuff that i actually hate reading, its a shame so many <i>dragon's bait</i> fanfic writer's are like that, but i guess that's why they write more than me. its so much easier to get a story on paper when you actually have a plot, as opposed to my situation where i have people in my head with all their motivations and angst but nothing for them to do. all i know is i want to play around with some combination of andre and <lj user=draykonis>' lorcan scamander (or is it malakai now?) and a girl with mylene jampanoi's eyes and who rides a motorcycle. witness indeed."

"event","dad keeps on trying to lecture me on the not-so-secret secret, like the reason why i've spent the last year bumming around the house is because i don't get it. i've been sending vibes out into the universe since i was a little kid, and even though the idea took on several mutations, the core of it was the same. i know the kind of person i want to be, always have. the problem is that after 18 years of school, i still haven't the slightest clue as to how to be that person aside from just being really lucky. seriously, how does that happen? on the plus side, i've been falling back in love with literature and writing. so then i wonder if it would be completely useless to get a masters in media studies, and if i should just spend the next two years studying to be a physical therapist's assistant, and work and get married and make babies and one day when i get bored start writing again. but then that sounds completely useless as well. ah, if only my great and terrible ambition was to be in a field that was in constant need of fresh meat. like nursing. or porn. speaking of which, wouldn't sasha grey make a perfect sophie-anne leclerq? too bad the part already went to evan rachel wood, a casting that i'm liking less and less the more i think about it. oh well.

went to my cousin emily's wedding last saturday. as dad put it, it was the classiest wedding he'd ever been to. the reception was held at the branford mansion on the uconn campus in groton, which holy crap if i had known that a part of uconn looked like that i wouldn't have been as eager to get out of connecticut for college. i took a bunch of pictures which i haven't loaded up on the computer yet so i guess you'll have to use your imaginations. there was ocean view, a white tent, and a stone patio. very pretty. the ceremony itself was, well, catholic. mom liked the church but i thought it was a rather clumsily gaudy. no one will ever persuade me to get married in a church that's for sure. and while dinner was outside where it got cold and foggy really fast, the dance party was held in the mansion afterward. if only pictures captured the severe dorkiness of my extended family rocking out to ""vogue.""

starting saturday i'll be in cape cod, until hopefully the saturday after. and i will be able to see the <i>true blood</i> season 2 premiere and perhaps get a tan that will probably have to last me the rest of the year. i'm reading <i>dracula</i> now, its rather silly to be perfectly honest, but it makes me want to watch the coppola version again. the next books i have lined up are <i>from dead to worse</i> and j.g. ballard's <i>crash</i>. and i'll bring <i>the novel and short story writer's market</i> too and see if i can make some headway with it. i have a goal to finish the sophie-anne/andre fic i started by friday - yes, jen, i am writing one - but at the rate i'm going it probably won't happen, so i might change that goal to the end of vacation. oh and i hit 126 pounds last week, and was there consistently for a while. i've been back up to 127 for the past two days which probably has something to do with these horrible digestive problems i've been having. i still want ice cream though, so so badly. i guess i'll settle for a cookie."

"event","this has been quite possibly the most active two days i've had in a while. i even rode my bike for the first time in years. i couldn't even push myself forward for a while, because i was so unused to it, i was riding on the lawn, and the gear was too high. eventually i managed to get it moving long enough to switch to a lower gear and road a couple laps around the house, making a point to double back a few times so i could remind myself how to do sharp turns - i nearly crashed into the house the first time i tried it. had a job interview yesterday morning, really hard to gauge though, i spent most of the time talking to the woman who currently has the position. she told me about everything from the kind of work it entails to her fantasy of retiring to a farm in ecquador. the actual interview was very quick. and then this morning i went up to danbury with dad to move out some of vidal's stuff before he officially has to be out of the dorm tomorrow. they apparently had a big party last night - i was still smelling garbage and beer even after we got back, i'm hoping it didn't get absorbed into my clothes.

and i finished <i>the gargoyle</i>. i was debating whether i wanted to write my goodreads review for it first, or my more personal one here, because for some reason i really want it to be established that i officially finished it, but i figure the more unhinged, disorganized review should go first. my feelings on it are a bit strange, because its really not as a good of book as it wants you to think it is, but i did enjoy it. i just didn't really get anything out of it. in the author's biography, its boasted that andrew davidson researched for seven years in order to write the book, and you can tell. unlike writers like donna tartt who have this amazing ability to use research and information like a single golden thread in a large elaborate tapestry, interweaving it in all the right places so that it is integral to the entire work but not obvious to the person looking at it, davidson seems to want to you to see his work. in fact, what gives this story life is all the exotic information it holds, because the rest is rather hollow. the narrator (who is nameless, which kind of irrationally annoyed me since i had read <i>rebecca</i> not long before, so in my head the character was named andrew) while possessing some sarcastic wit and cynicism, is not terribly complex. the story of his pre-life-altering-car-accident self i wanted to buy, but until it was spelled out that he was just so goshdarn guarded and never allowed himself to be attached to anyone, i kept on thinking, ""so, wait, what was so bad about this guy?"" and as result the whole concept of penance and redemption that the story rides on was kind of lost on me, nevermind that those are themes that don't really interest me. it made me realize why i like j.k. rowling so much - her writing is decisively godless and unsentimental. characters die suddenly and randomly, no redemption, no great final words. and if anyone's characters could use some salvation its hers, but when its revealed why davidson's character, marianne engel, must carve gargoyle's for hundreds of years it didn't really make sense to me. and as for the love story, well, its not as bad a <i>twilight</i> where i'm still bewildered as to why bella and edward give a shit about eachother, marianne and the narrator at least have chemistry. but i wasn't exactly feeling the great epic love either. as said, the narrator doesn't have much meat to his character, and while a ton of information is given on marianne, again as said, it doesn't seem to fit together properly (though she's supposedly schizophrenic so maybe that's the point). *sigh* they just don't write love stories for people like me, because i always want to understand why, but love is not supposed to make sense. but hey, anne rice can do it, her couples always seem perfect for eachother to me. i guess true wuv is as hard to write as a good ending.

and so for my other great excitement. i received iamx's newest album <i>kingdom of welcome addiction</i> in the mail thursday night, and since then i've been listening to it consistently. this was the first physical cd i've bought in about three years, so i almost didn't know what to with it after unwrapping it (which is another thing i seem to have forgotten how to do). my long unused stereo wasn't even plugged in. but it was good to hear the whole thing from beginning to end, in sequential order, filling up my little room for the first time. if the first album was synth heavy, the second guitar heavy, then this one is definitely beat heavy. with every song the percussion seems like the most prominent feature, making the album feel like a march, or at least a waltz. it's as different from chris corner's previous work as <i>kiss and swallow</i> and <i>the alternative</i> were from eachother, this time taking the ambiance of previous songs like ""president"" and ""bring me back a dog"" and smashing and extending them into eleven whole tracks. as a result, this album does not have as much variety as <i>the alternative</i> did, but this way feels more complete. there are more songs that feel like singles, such as the title track, ""the great shipwreck of life"" and ""nature of inviting,"" but just because their catchy doesn't mean they lack weight, because they are nothing if not forceful. and then there are anti-singles like ""you can be happy"" which defies a thumping beat and addictive melody by replacing a typical chorus with a woman speaking and adding a haunting synth quality, giving it a creepiness that seems at war with the song's name. ""tear garden"" and ""an i for an i"" are songs that i keep going back and forth about, i can't actively listen to them, i have to be playing them in the background to realize that i love them. ""the stupid, the proud"" i didn't take to at first, but i could tell it would the type of song that i would become obsessed with later on, and i'm already acknowledging how much i like it. the big surprise was ""my secret friend."" when i heard that this album would feature a duet with imogen heap, i wasn't that impressed - i like the music of hers that i've heard, but i wasn't that interested in hearing iamx's sound meshed with anyone else's. what i didn't anticipate was how perfectly their voices are suited for eachother, or that they would find such a beautiful melody to showcase that. its probably my favorite song, though like everything else i'll probably go through phases. so, unlike <i>the gargoyle</i>, this album actually feels epic, even though there are less love stories than in the previous albums. it feels like music that marches through time with passion and love, and fortunately has on its way come to me."

"event","an hour ago i had an idea to come on here and complain. adam lost, the eurovision high is finally slowing down, and i don't know if i'm doing anything right. yesterday i went to a fed ex recruitment thing with dad, a lot of signing my name and social security number over and over again. the thing that bugged me about it was that morning, an hour or so before i had to go, i got a call from accoutemps, the temp agency i signed up with, saying the had a data entry job that started that day. besides having plans, that involved seeking full time employment, i was pretty intimidated by the idea of running out the door for a job i knew hardly anything about. and i was groggy, the call was what woke me up thirty seconds before my alarm was supposed to. so i was fretting about whether i messed things up royally by turning it down until i got another call today about a much better possibility. not the same kind of get up and go situation, i will need to, you know, get the interview and whatnot, but it feels good that this start/stop thing that the job market has been is starting resemble a regular flowing stream again. its good to see some activity, know that i'm not wandering around in the ether.

so as much as i like <i>the gargoyle</i>, i'm finding myself really missing miss sookie. and i'm aching for true blood to start. i'm so tuned into it that i don't even have to turn around to know that a commercial for it is on tv, i recognize the music. i'm thinking i might get the first season on dvd, its the kind of thing i can see myself watching several times over. i wish goodreads was more like myanimelist in that there's features for listing your favorite characters and whatnot, because i think sookie would end up on there for me, along with will perry and milton's satan. goodreads isn't so much about the list obsession though, i've gotten used to it, but its really doesn't have that great of a format. but anyway, i wish i wasn't trying to finish <i>the gargoyle</i> just so i can move on to <i>dead as a doornail</i> as quickly as possible, but i can't help it, <i>the gargoyle</i> is plenty interesting and sick and romantic, but it doesn't have the same kind of addictive fire. i don't know what i'm going to do when i finish the series. 

as for the idol finale last night, i know that it doesn't really matter that adam lambert is not the american idol, he's going to take over the world anyway, but it just would've been a nice cherry on top, the perfect climax to the season. and i feel for those that are hurting because of it, it does feel a bit like if someone as dominant, creative and engaging as adam can't win, then what openly gay person can? but as said, it doesn't matter much really except as a symbol. tonight i have the so you think you can dance premiere, and after that is the fashion show, which makes me miss project runway more than anything, but its still pretty good. what would i do without my competitive reality tv?"

"event","i'm feeling kind of grumpy this evening. that stuck feeling is bearing down again, and my current reading, <i>the gargoyle</i>, isn't really helping. not that it isn't a great book, when i sat down with it earlier today my nasty headache vanished after reading barely a paragraph. and that's not to say that my situation is comparable to that of the main character, a man who finds that he is no longer a gorgeous, wealthy porn star but now thanks to a car accident that was undoubtedly his fault he is a limping bundle of scar tissue and lives with a crazy woman. but it does feel like a kind of sick parable. and even though i know my current situation isn't permanent, it feels like it is, almost the way being scarred for life can be. 

thankfully, there's eurovision, which surprise surprise actually came up with some good music this year rather than just entertaining performances. maybe i didn't thoroughly peruse the song list last year, but i feel like there's more subtlety and variety to the music of eurovision 2009, as opposed to 2008's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8FbpoSLk2E&amp;feature=channel_page"">flashy extravagance</a> that i can't deny that i shamelessly adored. its why i was looking forward to this year's competition so much. but there was something very refreshing about this year. i think bosnia & herzegovina's entry was my favorite.

<lj-embed id=""18""/>

its in a language i don't think i've ever heard before in my life, but whenever the chorus comes in my tear ducts start to feel a little warm. its followed very closely behind by <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV06oUEuCjU"">portugal</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gujplqa47Qs"">lithuania</a>, the latter of which i think suffered from the double standard that if your song is in english it has a big advantage, but if it sounds too ""american,"" it backfires on you. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KV-zYsgaKE"">germany</a> i think had the same problem, since it too didn't place nearly as well as it should've. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJmWdWMmoPY"">estonia</a> probably did the best considering its ""disadvantages."" besides being more alternative sounding, it also was the highest ranking song that isn't in english. and it has cellos *drools*. probably the strangest entry was from the host country itself, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4VoLG-5v_4"">russia</a>, a song that is the furthest thing possible from last year's first place <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XR5xrU02yo"">hamfest</a>. its strange, angsty and totally wrong for something like eurovision and i really really like it. 

but of course eurovision did what it does best, delivering cheese upon cheese in the most delicious ways, and of course that came in the way of ukraine. i don't even know what to link you to first, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZJdQESnyu4"">the performance</a> with the half naked men and some contraptions that look like something from cirque du soleil, or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr8hWWuO29g"">the music video</a> that while ridiculously exhibitionist, seemed to be unable to decide what concept to go with. dipped in chocolate? strip club orgy? live performance? target commercial? hell just throw it all in, bitch is smokin so its all good to me. and yet she still only came in 12th. as usual the top places went to wimpy ballads and insubstantial pop tracks that will be forgotten in a few months. ah well. but seriously, once you get hooked on this stuff its hard to remember why anyone gives a shit about american idol (go adam). 

hmm, i was planning on writing about other stuff that was going on, but that was a lot more work than i expected, and i'm not grumpy anymore so now all i really want to do is watch the idol finale and eat some raspberry sherbert. peace peoples."

"event","been feeling kind of fuzzy. maybe its the pollen count. i just have a need to do something, which is odd because i'm actually doing more than usual. i've been exercising more regularly, i cooked a dinner that i came up with myself yesterday, go me. maybe i'll go shopping sometime soon, i do have a family wedding coming up in a little over a month and i need a dress. something to match my red shoes maybe. hopefully it'll be warm again this weekend so that i can go play tennis.

been reading the sookie stackhouse books, i've already gotten through the first two. i took the opportunity to download them when someone posted them on <lj comm=ontd_twatlight>'s sunday swap, which is convenient because i can plow through them pretty fast and i wasn't able to find them at the library. the inconvenience is i think the pdfs i got are unedited manuscripts, which makes charlaine harris' writing come off as even more clumsy than it already is. they're actually rather addictive, so i'm glad that there are many of them, even though i'll probably have them finished by this time next week. i was so surprised by how faithful the show <i>true blood</i> is to its source, even though it has very obviously lifted story lines from later books and fleshed out minor characters in order to fill out the first season. i'm looking forward to see how they adapt <i>living dead in dallas</i> for the second (june 14th, woohoo). what really surprised me though was how faithful they were in casting. i mean, with something huge like <i>harry potter</i>, they make sure the main characters look the part, but even that only stretches so far. so with a tv show, i wouldn't think that they take care to match the hair color of a background character to her description in the book, but they did. bill is pretty much exactly as he's described, as is eric, which is particularly extraordinary since eric is so far still a background character for one, but also enormous. not that its that hard to find a giant scandinavian man, but finding one that can act and actually wants the part is another thing. that show seriously must have the best casting directors.

i really dislike reading ebooks though. words do not express how good it feels to sit down with a book, to hold it in your hands and turn the pages. reading one through a computer feels deeply false, and it annoys me that it keeps me tethered to the living room when i should be outside tanning my legs on the porch. maybe that's where my restlessness has come from. maybe i'll start volunteering to do the yard work while i listen to jeremy irons narrate <i>lolita</i> on my ipod. or maybe i really will start running more often in the mornings. i felt kind of terrible after i did it last week, the first time in a while. but the after effects, the soreness, though painful felt really good. it felt like i was finally putting my body to some use. there's more than one kind of atrophy that i need to look out for."

"event","i've had a good feeling lately that pops in and out. maybe its the onset of spring that finally made itself known this weekend, but there is a sense of coming out of a long dark tunnel going on right now. i hope its not just a feeling, i hope it amounts to something. its funny reading about other people's stress, because while i worry and fret i don't lose sleep over it. and i have very simple dreams about sex and breakfast cereal. the only upsetting one i've had recently was one where i was back at school, but didn't go to any classes because i had seemingly forgotten about them. i used to have dreams like that all the time in school - that there was always one class that i never remembered to go to or something. i was reading a few days ago that dreams about ""unpreparedness"" indicate issues of self-worth, which i suppose fits. lately in my dreams i've had incredibly long hair, so often in fact that i'm starting to see myself that way in my mind's eye.

the final trailer for <i>half blood prince</i> has been released - after many, many trailers, seriously is that normal? - and sent me into an <i>hp</i> tizzy. i watched <i>order of the phoenix</i> and when that wasn't enough i started skimming through every book after <i>prisoner of azkaban</i>, and i think i may understand now the weird effect <i>deathly hallows</i> had on me. it wasn't that i didn't like it, i thought it was a fantastic book, but then closing it just felt like ""oh, well, ok, i guess that's that then."" talking about it with other people didn't hold the same excitement as the afterglow of the previous books. the fandom seemed to have the same response - the usual flood of fic, art and essays seemed to immediately diminish to a trickle, its not till recently that things started to pick up again. it wasn't that i felt too detached from it, like what usually happens after completing a series - i think it was because i didn't feel detached enough. <i>deathly hallows</i> wasn't cathartic, the whole thing just felt like a slow burn that fizzled around in your head until it eventually faded away. usually that's a good thing for books and movies, it keeps you in that world, but when its the final installment in a seven chapter series, not so much. with all the earlier books, jkr takes you round and round on a journey and finishes things off with a nice bang (which, i've realized, is an onomatopoeia that jkr really likes to use) that leaves you somewhat disoriented but still thrilled. but with <i>deathly hallows</i> the bangs were more in the middle, and the final one just didn't have the impact of the rest. i mean, we all knew voldemort had to die, we just didn't know how. once we figured out how, the actual moment didn't mean much. no bang, no catharsis. just that epilogue. 

and now my conception of the future hogwarts is getting all kinds of discombobulated, because i've been reading <lj user=draykonis>'s fic, <a href=""http://draykonis.livejournal.com/44367.html#cutid1"">rock on</a>, featuring the new cast of hogwarts students introduced in the epilogue, who she affectionately calls generation hex. her characterizations are so complete and interesting, the idea jkr might come back and make use of these characters is almost a painful thought. the days where fandom was scrambling for more fodder from jkr's brain i think is mostly over, it is a self-sustained entity now. and hopefully some of the fandom best writers like <lj user=draykonis> or <lj user=themostepotente> will use their talents for some original writing. and then the process starts all over again."

"event","today was gray and cool, it made me think about writing. but that's all i could really do, think about it. i opened up a few stories, did some editing, but couldn't put down anything new. then i wanted to read something flat and stupid, so i read the article in vanity fair on gisele bundchen. she's irritatingly happy, by the time i got to the end i was just skimming it. its not just jealousy - even though the issue sparked a conversation with my dead about goal-setting - its just that happy people are not very interesting to read about. even her modest roots she talks about with glee. give me some angst, man, something to fight for.

speaking of which, i finished <i>rebecca</i>. i found that it was occupying my mind a lot, so once i got past the part that i was dreading, i just decided to plow through the rest as fast possible. the last hundred pages or so was a bit tedious - it was like a play, where everyone is in one room discussing things for an overly long period of time. it created a lot of tension, but felt flat after a while. as a whole, i can't really tell if i really liked it, all i know is that i want to ramble about it. a lot. 

<lj-cut text=""so that's what i'm going to do - spoilers abound, beware"">
the first thing that was noticeable to me was how close it is to <i>twilight</i>. but its how <i>twilight</i> should've been written. the man is dark, mysterious, charismatic and deeply conflicted, not to mention a lot older. the girl is very young, naive, awkward and romantic. the difference is that daphne du maurier's characters are far more authentic - her heroine is so awkward and timid it makes you cringe away from the page, so lacking in self esteem that one must assume that she suffered some trauma as a child, as opposed to bella's endearing mary sue clumsiness that is there simply as a device to be used when someone needs to rescue her. and maxim de winter seems so detached that you want to smack him. but as opposed to edward, he actually has a personality. edward comes off as a whiny immortal, who despite living 100 years without sleep or sex, has not seemed to have gleaned anything from living those years except a collection of graduation caps and the ability to speak dozens of languages. maxim, on the other hand, is a fortysomething year old curmudgeon, who is valiant and purposeful when he needs to be, and the rest of time he is condescending and makes snarky comments at his sister's expense behind her back. he's kind of an asshole, yes, but you can definitely see why any girl would be taken with him. and i should mention, his looks are not mentioned once. plus, maxim actually has something legitimate to be grouchy about - sure edward killed people, but he did it for food, he's a vampire, what do you expect? maxim killed his wife because....well she was a bitch, which could be a good reason depending on context, but unlike some sparkly immortals, maxim actually has to worry about getting caught.

which brings me to the actual focus of the book - rebecca, maxim's late wife. sure i can put on the feminist glasses and say ""oh, right, we get a gutsy, beautiful woman who grabbed life by the balls, and of course she's a slut and gets shot by her poor cuckolded husband, wth"" but feminist glasses don't show the many shades of gray involved. though the main issue isn't very gray at all - rebecca was kind of a sociopath. the other part though is a little distressing - that after killing his wife, maxim marries a woman who seems totally incapable of making a decision of her own. however, rather than seeing this as misogynistic, i see it more as a natural response to getting burned as badly as maxim did. as a result of his bad experience with rebecca, he grew distrustful of a level of sophistication and superficiality, and chose a new wife who was the exact opposite. it has more to do with class and social structure, rather than female subservience. the fact that she is so young as well - and he seems intent on maintaining her youthful innocence, even half-joking that she dress up as alice in wonderland for their fancy dress ball - kind of paints maxim in my mind as an only slightly different breed of humbert humbert (could the second mrs de winter be a grown-up nymphette, and that's why no one else seems to understand her allure?). it reminds me of how much i enjoy that kind of pairing - the older, dark male, with the younger more innocent woman - which <i>twilight</i> should've brought to mind but felt all wrong for. granted, <i>rebecca</i>'s main characters don't fit exactly either (the second mrs de winter is a little too innocent for my preferences, she was mostly persephone and only a little bit kore), but nonetheless it still makes me feel that this book should have been a lot dirter. that's the weird thing about read a pop writer of the era, the dan brown of the 1930s, it had to suit the audience. i mean, you know that after he told her he never loved rebecca they had amazing sex that night, as well as the night before he thought he would be meeting his doom. but no, they went to sleep in their separate beds next to each other in the same room. riiiiight. so yeah, this book needed to be raunched up a lot, because the suggestions that rebecca was fucking her cousin, and that her maid was in love with her, was not enough for me. 

so part way through i couldn't help thinking about how it would go if there was a remake done. i wouldn't be against it, even though hithcock's version is of course a classic and great. but the story didn't get to be faithfully told due to the censorship of the movie studios. there's actually a remake that was done with <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001097/"">this gorgeous man</a> as maxim, but it was only for tv, so i doubt it has the elements i'd be looking for. which is sex. and trippy creepiness. if david lynch could ever be possessed to do it, it would be awesome. with johnny depp or viggo mortensen as maxim. mmhm. the heroine would be a little harder to cast, since very few young actresses today embody the careless innocence she requires. though summer glau might work."

"event","it's a bad day. a cloudy, frustrating april fools. a crawl out of your skin, shave your head, do jumping jacks until you can't breath day. its a very immature kind of despair. i just want to shake something and say ""why does everything have to suck so much?"" as if there were anyone to ask, as if anyone knew. goddamn you george bush for making my first year of liberation feel like a prison. a year, in one month it'll be one year, a year that feels like just a blur of repeated moments. maybe it wouldn't have been much better otherwise, but i could've at least been doing something, anything.

i think its perfectly realistic to be optimistic in a climate like this. because it will get better, i think that's a fact. it won't necessarily get better tomorrow, but it eventually will. but on days like this - which actually have been rather few and far between lately - i want it to be better right now. if i had <i>prisoner of azkaban</i> i would watch that, it always seemed to correct my mind when it was going off center. instead i have <i>velvet goldmine</i>, and since my computer decided it didn't want to cooperate a half a hour ago, its now too late to watch it. i know i can't have a solution right now, so i'm just looking for a band aid but i can't seem to find one, everything seems to hate me. i wish i had the tennis channel, and that they would broadcast matches without commentary so i can space out while watching the ball bounce back and forth.

i watched <i>taxi driver</i> the other day. good, but a bit in one ear and out the other. i've been reading <i>rebecca</i>, its good, but not gripping and its hard to attach myself to the main character. i'll probably go read it when i'm done with this because nothing else feels right. i should do some writing, but i've realized that i should probably suck it up and plan out my ideas a bit first, which is a strange concept because i've never really done it before, and anyway its not something to attempt with a raging headache and hatred for fate. i can't make anything connect right now. its like when i was little and i'd have dreams where suddenly everything started disintegrating, i couldn't hold anything together, even when i was sleeping. better have someone else think for me at the moment, and just tag along for the ride."

"event","i'm magically losing weight it seems. i've never been able to appreciate something like dieting because it never seems that i'm in control of the pounds i put on or lose. sometimes they decide to wander off unexpectedly, and then other times they sneak up behind me and latch themselves before i know what's happening. but for the past week or two i have consistently been around 128, and today in fact i weighed in at 127.6 (squeee). my mom suggested that it might be because i haven't had any of my beloved ginger ale in a while, which i dismissed because i thought the weight loss had started before the unintentional soda shortage, but now that it seems to be suddenly dropping a lot faster than before, there may be some merit in that theory. so i guess its a matter of what prefer - having my sugary, bubbly ginger ale or being 128 (or 127, or 126...). granted, 128 doesn't really feel that much different from 132 right now. it looks a bit different, my lower belly may just be flatter than it used to be if i'm not mistaken. but my ass feels as gelatinous as ever. managing to feel thin and healthy can be a lot harder than looking it i'm realizing. i remember when i first gained those extra pounds after high school, the moment i noticed that i really truly was no longer at a happy body place was when i woke up in the morning and didn't feel skinny. i had always counted on that feeling, because usually by the end of the day i felt bloated from eating too much or carrying around water, but i knew that i could go to bed and wake up the next morning and that feeling would be gone. then one day i woke up and felt just as fat as i did the night before. i'm hoping that sense of dissatisfaction will not be permanent, i want to be able to feel like i can move effortlessly, feel lithe and toned. 

so i went to see <i>watchmen</i> opening weekend with my dad and surprisingly have very little to say about it. i don't really care about faithfulness when it comes to movie adaptations, i'm well aware that keeping to the script is not what makes a good film. so that wasn't my concern really going in to it, even though i loved the original comic, i just wanted to be entertained and stimulated. i was entertained at least part of the time, but not very stimulated. i liked the approach to the different back stories, but whenever the movie had to switch gears to focus on someone else i would briefly become aware of my butt going numb, so flow isn't snyder's strong point when dealing with a plot this complex. the film was very pretty, i think it treated rorschach and manhattan pretty well, and i liked the guy who played ozymandias a lot. i wish that it closed with more of the comedian actually, he's the catalyst of the story and is integral through the first part of it and also integral to who the rest of the characters are (and jeffrey dean morgan was fantastic and hot), but his presence fizzles out by the end and all we're left with is nite owl and silk spectre 2 who have to be the least interesting characters in the entire story. and the change at the end...it sort of bothered me. but all in all, my feelings of indifference are just too overpowering for me to really be upset about it.

i am hungry, and need to do chores. mom has been hounding me to clean the refrigerator shelves and i keep forgetting, so she left me a note to remind me this morning. not that i have anything against cleaning the fridge but being told what to do always makes me feel a little slimy so i'm going to eat my lunch first and then pretend that i thought of doing some cleaning all by myself."

"event","my hair is getting long enough that its starting to annoy me. it gets in my face all the time, and makes me feel too warm. i've been tying it back the way i usually only do in the summer. that said, i still don't plan on cutting it any time soon, though it could probably use some styling. i want it long and big, with some highlights somewhere down the line, and this season is a good a time as any. i could use some brightening up.

so i did some research last week, and even though i still much prefer to stick it out, the way things are i have to consider grad school. the idea does not seem as unappealing as it used to, perhaps because i hit a breaking point, or maybe i just needed time to warm up to it. i'm liking the new school's media studies program - i won't have to choose between theory or practice, i get to study both, and there are opportunities to get certificates in screenwriting as well during my time there. and all the research courses are available online, which could be helpful if i'm not able to get residence. i think one of the things that was turning me off about grad school was i felt like i was trapping myself on a course, but i have a lot of options with this. i'll keep writing, and if that works out then i'll at least have studied something was interested in and maybe i'll get to use it eventually, and if film works out for me then awesome. and if neither, then i can get my phd and become the next lucia, teaching able minds to see frames within frames as a sign of voyeurism and entrapment and to gain an appreciation for mise-en-scene. i've always liked the idea, but it would always get shoved down by my more greedy side. of course, i've already missed the fall semester deadline, which was actually only a few weeks ago. the deadline for application for spring 2010 is october, which gives me plenty of time to get everything together (and procrastinate). in the meantime, i have pretty much a year before i'd be taking classes, and that's a lot of time to do a lot of things. i'm getting tempted to take uncle dan and ana up on their continual invitations to visit them in california. finding work is always the priority, but there's a lot of projects i could get going in the meantime.

i've already finished <i>dexter in the dark</i>. thank god it was better than the third season of <i>dexter</i>. and christina, quit complaining and finish reading it, its actually really good. sure, the sudden shift from serial killer psychology to supernatural demon mythology is weird, but once you decide to chill and go with it, its actually a pretty enjoyable ride. the callous disinterest of the second book is replaced by a much more emotional, very invested dexter. don't worry, it works in context. like the other books, the plot is kind of loose and the police work is pretty terrible (seriously, why does deb even have her job when she seems barely capable of stringing two facts together?), but dexter keeps it together with figuring out how to educate his two mini-psychopaths in the way of harry and the deterioration of the bit of sanity he had now that his maker is on his tail. the funny thing is, jeff lindsay is really not much of a writer, he just is really good at writing from a certain perspective (because its not like the dark vigilante character hasn't been done before) and creating a character that is both viciously inhuman and endearingly innocent (as opposed to brooding and byronic, which is the mold with these types). in <i>dexter in the dark</i> lindsay is actually trying for something a little different, a little ambitious, and i think it works. if he hadn't established dexter as just a straightforward sociopath then it would've been easier concept to swallow, but once you get it down, its actually a really interesting addition to the horror/fantasy genre. and from the way it ended, there will probably more where that came from, and i don't really mind."

"event","so i had my first date ever this past week. met up with a guy i met on okc. i hadn't been talking to him that long, and in fact i hadn't talked to him about anything of much consequence. he's a rather terrible person to talk to online, no matter how many times i say it, he does not seem to get that when he says ""what are you up to?"" i'm going to say, ""nothing much."" but i agreed to have dinner with him at chili's anyway since he lives about two minutes away and i'm bored and a bit starved for human interaction. it was nice, conversation was decent if not a bit forgettable (i kept on getting distracted by these amazing crispy chicken tacos i was eating, guh, so good), and we have soft plans to do something again next week. but he doesn't excite me, doesn't <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YG_QDjw8pPo"">move me</a>, he hardly occupies my mind at all aside from some minor irritation when he takes a round about way of asking a question that requires much more directness, and then says its good to, you know, ""get these things out in the open."" but i'm just testing the waters, and so it should not be surprising that first encounters are with rather mediocre men. i couldn't help but feel a bit like an alien investigating human customs during that dinner. every time he referenced some dating trope, like that asking to split the check is considered a sign of disinterest or not wanting to tell me what he was ordering so i wouldn't feel ""pressured,"" i would just stare at him blankly. i do not speak the date language, i don't know the code. i guess that's why i keep on watching the millionaire matchmaker, even though it is a terrible and slightly offensive show, i want to know how that world works. its almost like my interest in serial killers and sociopaths - i find it incredibly interesting, though i have a hard time imagining myself participating in it. 

speaking of which, i just finished reading <i>dearly devoted dexter</i>. not as good as the first book, while dexter's callous wit is enough to carry the book, there isn't really much investment in the plot. dexter doesn't care, so you don't really care. even though the villain of the story is does some deeply horrible things, its regarded as not much more than a curiosity, so its hard to feel really disturbed by it. in the meantime, i downloaded the pdf of stephenie meyer's <i>the host</i>, and oh sweet jesus is it terrible. i think i'm somewhere around page 90 and i really don't want to go any further. its just so painfully stupid. its like a 6th grader's attempt at writing a novel. at least with <i>twilight</i> the stupidity was mostly contained within the characters, but with this smeyer actually attempts to some world-building, and the results are rather abysmal. ugh, i don't even want to think about it too long, lest my brain rots."

"event","this extended cold spell - days and days of weather below 32 degrees, snow on top of snow on top snow - has got me pining for spring. when the sun is strong its like a tease, and then i remember the reason why the house is so full of light is because the trees are bare and the sun is reflecting off the snow on the ground. i want sun on grass, on the white rails of our porch that we can stand out on when its warm. my favorite holiday colors are those of halloween and easter - black and orange for the fall, and baby pastels for the spring, the colors prisms make. its days like these where i'm glad i painted my room lavender and have white lace curtains. i once tried to write a prose piece that captured this spring-time urge, based on a dior ad i saw. but it was just prose - rambling and self-indulgent. i keep on listening to lifelike's <a href=""http://www.discoworkout.com/uploads/adventurelifelike.mp3"">""adventure""</a> over and over again, because it has that aura to it. it makes me want to watch italian movies. maybe that's why more and more i'm liking instrumental electropop, because you can paint your own universes while listening to it, ones that are sparkling and warm. 

watched <i>dead ringers</i> yesterday, despite some hesitation. having gotten the gist of cronenberg's style of using gore and overall strangeness, i wasn't sure if i wanted to watch a movie by him that was about twin gynecologists. but all the reviews said it was his masterpiece, and jeremy irons was in it playing two roles, so how could i say no. and sure enough, my fears were confirmed with what is probably the most shudder-inducing opening credits ever, thanks to illustrations of bizarre and alien-like surgical instruments. going to bed last night i was afraid i was going to end up having nightmares about them. the movie itself i liked, even though at times it did feel like it was dragging a bit. jeremy irons is really what makes it great, he creates two very separate and really interesting characters, both intriguing, sympathetic and detestable in completely individual ways. in reviews on imdb and netflix, a lot of people argued about it being labeled a horror movie, and compared it to <i>jacob's ladder</i> in that both really are more like dramas. but to me, <i>dead ringers</i> and <i>jacob's ladder</i> are what horror really is, or what its supposed to be. the rest are just slashers, thrillers, torture porn, or whatever. what goes on in <i>dead ringers</i> is what's truly scary - losing your sanity for one, and being trapped in insanity by someone you cannot and do not want to free yourself from. its more haunting and disturbing more than it is scary, and while it didn't stay with me the way <i>crash</i> did, i would definitely say its a great film.

i'm still in the mood for creepy things, but i can't get the craving for something flowy and romantic out of my head. maybe i'll watch <i>lolita</i> again, or one of those european films that netflix has been recommending to me."

"event","so the family computer died quite suddenly. i got up a couple mornings ago to only find a black screen with a cursor to greet me, and no matter how many times i rebooted it, i still got the same thing. so the whole things been wiped, yet again, the only thing of value that i lost (other than all the gifs that i had been collecting from <lj comm=ontd_twalight>) was my writing - a bunch of unfinished stories, some fan fiction some not. *does inventory in head* ugh, there goes that <i>hannibal</i> fic, i think i had a good four or five pages. and i had the beginnings of the new chapters for <i>twilight</i> and <i>dragon's bait</i> fics. damn. thankfully there wasn't a lot of original stuff lost, just one story and i was thinking of restarting it anyway. and now i gotta look for a new desktop wallpaper. arg all my bookmarks are gone too *headdesk*. i should probably invest in a memory stick.

there's been some family drama centered around grandma victoria. she fell twice last week and was in the hospital for a couple days, and has just been released to a rehab facility. no broken hips or anything, but she was extremely disoriented for a long while afterward. she seemed to think she was either back in the tailor shop or the factory my grandpa used to run. she would sew in her sleep, and try to wriggle out of her gurney when she was awake. it was upsetting for my dad and his siblings needless to say, and now they're kind of panicking over the possibility of her needing long term care. which bubbles up the drama from a few years ago of how sonia took grandma from her house after grandpa died even though she was happy where she was, and may have caused her some psychological damage in the process. paranoia about sonia seems to be at the center of her delusions - before her second fall, grandma was calling people at three in the morning, saying that sonia had lied to her about grandpa being dead because she saw him outside talking to someone, and that sonia had even changed the clocks to make her think it was late. the family is already planning for her 90th birthday party, even though its not until december. whatever happens, byron said, he thinks we should have it anyway. but i have faith she'll still be around when her birthday comes, because for her age, her body's doing fairly well. its her mind that's the problem, and its frustrating to think that if only someone had been paying more attention that may have been avoided too.

there was a report on npr about how in harder economic times, songs with a low beat variance are more popular. it doesn't matter if they're fast or upbeat or not, songs with a low beat variance are less intellectually straining apparently. but that kind of confuses me, because doesn't all pop music have a low beat variance, isn't that what makes it pop music? and even among non-mainstream stuff, i have a hard time finding anything that could be considered to have a high beat variance. so i'm curious as to what kind of music people were listening to during prosperous economic times and how different it is. it also kind of annoys me that it kind of implies that beat-heavy music is not as intellectually provocative, and it definitely can be.

two more cronenberg movies have been knocked off the list - <i>existenz</i> and <i>the brood</i>. i wasn't really crazy about either of them, though i liked the ending to <i>existenz</i> a lot. a guy i've been talking to on okcupid said one of his favorite cronenberg films was <i>the brood</i>, so i was really looking forward to it. it was interesting, and actually was pretty scary for a 70s horror film, but i didn't really get that much out of it. at least <i>existenz</i> makes you kind of give a little grin at the end, it makes its point with surprising effectiveness, even though it gets extremely convoluted at times. with <i>the brood</i>, the reaction more like a short ""hm."" not a bad movie at all, like i said its a rare example of a good 70s horror film, but its not as good as the other cronenberg movies i've seen so far. next up will probably be <i>scanners</i> and <i>dead ringers</i>, maybe <i>spider</i>. and once i'm done i've got to see <i>repo the genetic opera</i>. i don't know why but i've been craving big screen violence, something testosterone-ridden. i guess i just refuse to believe that anything so gratuitous isn't worth the brain-space. or maybe i just want to waste some brain-space."

I am in not, I repeat <b>not</b> Kenny Vasoli, nor am I affiliated with him or The Starting Line in any way, shape, or form.  Please don't add my journal unless you are a member of the MBP universe - any non-members can, and will, be ban_set.  If you are, however, feel free to comment and ask me to be added.  Or just add me, whatever floats your boat.  Thank you.

Furthermore - THIS IS NOT A GRAPHICS JOURNAL.  I look through tons of bullshit to find my pictures, so don't assume just because you're stumbling across this journal that means my icons are fair game to you, too.  And I reccomend not fullsizing them, either, in whatever have you community; I'm a heinous bitch, and won't hesitate to be so to you.  Tyvm.  Keep moving along now."

"event","phil lesh concert was super rad.
i had a great time!!
i spent the entire time with emily, dave and josh.  
it would have been awkward if we made it awkward
the atmosphere was amazing and loving and smokey =]
so many old school hippies, there were even families there who brought their little babies
it really put a huge smile on my face to see that.

after the show i ended up sleeping in josh's dorm.
with josh and dave
me and josh slept on the floor next to each other
dave slept in a chair.

i met josh's new girlfriend
her name is Caiti, she's really nice and we seemed to ahve a lot in common
she let me borrow pjs!!! 
and we both wanted to be he pink power ranger and wanted on the green/white one =D
and believe in karma, and being nice and stuff.

she gave me some pretty cigarettes too!!
they are super colourful, and make me happy
they are just OKAY though.
whatever.

we pretty much stayed up talking stuff until about 5, when she went back to her room, and me a josh decided to sleep.

the last thing i hear before i fell asleep was
'don't touch each other you to'
dave said it.
hahahah. it made ma laugh, but i felt sad too.

i'm totally over josh, i was over him before we ended, but theres something that lingers when i am aroudn him. i miss him, and care about him.
i definately lost him though.
this new girl is better then me, it seems
he said they talked about getting married and that he LOVES her.

i've been replaced.



OH

and it seems as though my two most recent exboyfriends seem to have a thing with girls who have blue hair and nose rings.

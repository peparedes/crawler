I've made a habit of quitting things, basketball is the most current; I haven't played in 4 weeks and I'm not playing tonight because I can think of more ""productive"" things to do between 9-12 on a friday nights.
In other news the damn contact list for the January Program at Wash U came out...... and I have ZERO in common with everyone who seems to love classic rock and ultimate frisbee.  I didn't deserve to get into this school anyway, they could at least supply this freshman class with people who remotely relate to me.  I was IMing with a girl the other day and when she asked what we did on the weekends and I explained ""party"" to her she was shocked, apparently Illinois isn't too big on that.  Wow, this is gonna be hella interesting.
Prom is coming, and suprisingly I'm excited, yay.  Now to find something to wear, get the limo, make dinner reservations and coordinate this cuz everyone else is either unhelpful or incapable of helping."

THis internship at Covington and Burling probably will materialize and make my Wash U decision even happier.  THe end is nearing and I'm panicking again.

He's just another one of the people in our grade who got into some school they thought they wouldn't.  Well now almost all of us, have decided where to go and I'm gonna be by my lonesome in StL; I guess that I wouldn't have it any other way?
Last weekend was crazy, loved it.  This weekend has already had a good start, Hopefully more is to come.
I found my new ""lift"", if I ever feel down I go to the WL boys soccer games and am happy b/c I'm not out there suffering the consequences of a bad defense.  Speaking of that, yesterday prior to Carrie's I ran into my good buddy Jon but Rheannin dragged him out of the stadium before he could make a big mistake.  ANother interesting thing happened at the game, Zach and I saw the ladycop who we became acquainted with at Fall Formal.  We'd seen her at a game last week, but this time she said ""hey guys"" and we both didn't know what to do... she was lookin good last night actually so I said hi back.

HIs son, also named zach, and I had the same problem during late november which required both of us to miss about 2 weeks of school; so we discussed that as well, to great length.

you're not having fun
you'd rather play basketball
you have nothing to prove
Then there is no reason left.  I used to play for my dad, but he'd understand if my heart isn't in it.  Now I just need something to do.  I have nothing to prove to anyone anymore, zero things left.  I guess I must just bide time until next August."

"event","Made it outta the first semester wit a 4.0 which was nice, but I feel I have spent too many late nights doing work and too much time in the classroom.  The only classes I have missed all year were during my supsension; and one English class when I forgot my basketball shoes but Ellen let me leave so it doesn't count.
But now the real test begins.  Soccer began last monday, but of course going to HB I didn't know about it and instead on tuesday at 4pm my daily ""eating chips in front of the TV"" session was interrupted by 2 phone calls from my coaches bitching me out.  So I went wednesday and thursday, conclusion: wow I'm fat (which Matt so nicely reminded me of every 10minutes this weekend).  I have high expectations and I'm realizing this sophomore bitch who's of course gotta be 6 foot 2 can't be taken lightly and if he takes my minutes I do have to quit even my goalie coach said I should.  Plus, soccer started and that means injuries galore.  After 3 conditioning sessions I've got: a bad back, jammed right shoulder, bruised left knee, hyperextended right knee, gash on my left foot, and a twisted right ankle to top it off.  This 3hrs straight of running is kinda overdoing it in my opinion but the way it's shaping up I may actually be captain.  WHich is hilarious considering I almost got kicked off the team last year, and I didn't even practice my first two years.
Zach broke his resolution today, and I'm pretty pissed of about it cuz I've kept mine and will for a long time to come.
Plan Ignore Rheannin is working perfectly, she leaves me alone after one attempt to speak to me and her friends are all still glad to see me.
Basketball=tons of fun=Max will play that instead of soccer upon reaching college (much to dismay of current soccer coaches)
School=joke... I honestly think I'm too smart for the classes I'm taking (including the 2 APs and Psych which is and AP), our school has gone downhill.
Arlington blows, but I'll miss Zachamatic next year for sure.  Did I mention how much I hate it here? People need to realize 1) Life ain't peaches and cream, 2) YOUR LIFE IS EASIER THAN MOST PPL'S IN THIS COUNTRY.  Ok I'm done.
Quote of the year: 
Zachariah: ""Yo Willy if you hook up with her you gotta tell me""
Willy: ""You didn't tell me you were going out with Rheannin""
Zachariah: ""yeah... but that was embarassing"""

You fly the highest solo, you may fall the hardest withotu anyone to catch you.  But at many times it's that time that's necessary... and now it is such a period of time.
Adios.

"event","So, apparently this 2nd side of me has come out again... what can I do?  Surpress who I actually am beneath all the bullshit? Yeah fucking right, it's my last 9 months so fuck it all, all of it every last bit of it.
I've gotta get it together eventually, but for now it's fuck it all cuz I really just want out of here and my friends aren't getting it.  I wanna leave and the fact is some of them will get left, but I'm ready for it.  Ok so maybe I am or at least sound like an asshole for saying that I know people will leave my life and I don't care cuz if I care it'll make it harder to leave, but fact of the matter is I won't miss them because I've programmed myself to think that they can walk out at any moment cuz they can.
Speaking of walking out at any moment, I got depressing news today that someone close to me might not make it past Friday and well I guess all I can do is pray J.C. will be with him til the end.
My coach and I have been working hard, and I'm gonna have 3 goals: 1st-team All District, 2nd-team All Region, Honorable Mention All-Metropolitan Area.  Sounds like I have to get to work then.  In fact I should get some rest cuz I have to practice, write a letter to Sara, pick up my photos, mow my neighbors' lawn, and find something to do tmrw night."

Actually, it was the perfect thing to end my mood lately; I've been severely depressed and pissed off at the world for not letting me get to where I need to go.  I'm ready to leave this fucking place, I'm grown up now (yes most will dispute that) and I can take care of myself and I'm just that ready.  I can't wait for this year to pass, hopefully get into Pitzer and get the fuck to Cali and back to Sara.  One more thing that alwayz helps... looking up and knowing the Cross is there for you, and that you only get a hand you can deal with.  I thank God for that letter I got today, and everything else.

Man this is kinda odd, this is the first time I have a good reason to do somin and I cna't do it; the first time I've resolved to do somin and haven't been able to shake it yet.  It's not like an addiction type thing just like I cna't shake it.  Jeff's in ecuador now, Zach in providence, Brendan in martha's vineyard, and matt will be gone soon (well i'll be with him wednesday to friday in detroit) but it seems almost too lonely here.  Makes me wish I was back in LA cuz there at least I knew I didn't have the chance to see them, and hereI know I can but I""m not able to.
Matt's BDay is tmrw tho so thas good, man I need somin to do with myself I've been so uselessss and I haven't even been training for the season that is 5 months away and closing in on me.

Fucking Hawaii ruinning everything, I tried toget excited about it but for some reason I hated it there and found it to be a tot al waste of money.
I""m trying to get my sister sent to boarding school, and distance m yself from my mom.  The first one is harder than the latter because sooner or later she has to accept I can take care of myself.
OH well, I hate Hawaii soooo much.  But I'll be home soon and be writing to Sara and playing Madden 2005 which comes out on August 12th, and I'l lget to see Matt plus I""m going to Detroit with him from the 18th to the 20th.  The only downside to coming home, other than leaving LA and Sara and the lil kids like my favorite one: Madison, is that I have to see my coach and I haven't worked out at all and I am in such bad shape and I've somehow gained a good chunk of weight which I have to get rid of cuz now I""m slow as hell.

She was happy to see me as was everyone else but sad that I'd be gone in 5 minutes never to see them again.  Sarah lives only 10min away from where I wanna go to college (as of now) so if I get in tehre, which im more convinced than ever that I won't, I'll be near her and the program I had to elave yesterday.
I saw my baby and my mom but it wasn't even too great.  I adapt quickly to new surroundings so I was already used to life without them.  Now I""ll have to adapt to the idea that I'll be back in ATown soon and be depressed again.

My soccer stuff game=good.  And my AP scores came.
Julia if you're reading this I got a 2 in Spanish, one question: And what?
I got a 2 in English which was kinda shitty.
THe 2 in history was a nice suprise considering I didn't really do anything on the essays except write a few incoherent and totally ignorant sentences.  I must've gotten really lucky on the Multiple Choice though, it kinda makes me wish I'd spent the 15min I was awake during the Essay Session on the essay instead of drawing and making faces at Jeff.
Saw Antwone Fisher the other night, that's a damn good film.  I saw Anchorman last night, glad I saw it but it wasn't as crazy as I expected.  ALthought, I can't wait to see Harold and Kumar go to WHitecastle... my kinda movie."

"event","SO I wake up this morning, feeling like total crap = totally not fun to feel like shit on your birthday.  I felt equally bad that I couldn't go in to work today because I'm getting paid alot and I wasn't earning the money today.  I needed the rest though because I was soooo fatigued from sleep deprivation and not eating like at all during the week at camp.
I surprised Allison today by actually calling her, it was pretty funny actually cuz I didn't even recognize her voice since I haven't talked to/seen her in about 2 1/2 months.  Nora called me, and I talked to Matt which made me feel a little better.
TOnight we went out for dinner and it was amazing, and then we watched the Blue Collar Comedy Tour which I""ll recommend to everyone who hasn't seen it.
Well being 17 sucks, I'm older and a year from leaving all that I know for some place that's almost alien to me.  I feel like there's no more room for me to be a kid, it's nerveracking knowing that the pressures on me and weight all on my shoulders is just gonna increase which isn't good at all cuz I can't take anymore on than what I've got and increased the load to make room for slight changes but not a lot of change can be taken.
ON the other hand we had a discussion about marriage at dinner, it was kinda concerning to me that I was talked bout in that context but I already know how it's gonna work and what I want (finally).  Unfortunately, the girl I've found is 5 hours away by plane at least; maybe I'll up at Pitzer so I can see her and if not I'll pray for a suitable replacement.  Love at first sight is something new for me, but I've accepted that even with me it can find its place.
NOw I got to sleep dreaming of the past and panicking about teh future but all the same I""l lbe looking forward to getting this year over with and starting over at this time next summer in my new surroundings.  I'll miss people, but the list is considerably smaller than I though; I""ll miss only a handful around 8-10 people at most (as of now) [family and extended family not included, that means my family and those I consider to be such].
But tomorrow I arise again... and let Jadakiss ask ""Why"" while I respond like Lloyd Banks cuz:

I met this woman (girl sorta) who's turning 20 on the 23rd of July just like me, but I'll be 17 obviously.  I'ma keep in touch wit her cuz she's sweet and REALLY hott.  She left me her addresses so I can sent mail to her and shit which is cool.
Being around that girl made me realize I should straighten out a bit, I've been good for a while but I know things could change when I get back home.  I'ma try to be good and all, and she and someone else, who I won't name, are my inspiration for doing this.  I really hope I end up going to school out here, cuz if I do I'll find her cuz she's great and well I'd love to see her outside of that shit.  Cuz she's in trouble for something I did a few times, just she got caught, arrested, and put in jail for it.  ANd when I see a young woman like her (with a beautiful singing voice I might add) it makes me think alot.

About 3 miles in combination of jogging, bleachers, and sprints is always good for you; especially when it is preceeded by a mile bike ride... then followed by that same mile ride to change and get more gatorade only to bike the 2 miles to Langston for an hour long weight training session, concluded by the 2 mile ride home.  The running was good, endorphin highs are fun, and more importantly free.  Lifting was hard as hell and got I got TONS of criticism for uttering the one phrase I'm not allowed to, so I was punished for saying ""I can't"", which I paid for in extra excercizes.  Other than that I've learned something today: Anything less than National District Player of the Year or a State Championship is unnacceptable and since we're gonna suck as a team unless I get that P.o.t.Y trophy all my training and my season will be rendered worthless.
I have to ask myself one question, though, How the fuck do you strain your calf while doing a benchpress?????!!!!!!??????  Meh, I'm going to find some icy hot before I do agility in the morning and goalkeeping in the evening tomorrow.

"" as a result, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has sent him a handwritten letter of appreciation.  What's moved him even more, Keith says, is what the song has meant to the soldiers.  Patrick Miller, a recent POW from Valley Center, Kan., defiantly sang Courtsey to his Iraqi captors."""

they said that no one on the floor likes me and that she's a bigger asset to the floor
i was sooooooo pissed....it was totally inappropropriate and every authority figure in the school knows that
so perrine moved out-which was te original plan ne wayz-

But what pisses me off more is that shes talking the ish, and i had to hear from other people.  I swear to God it's like HS.
I have to register at 6:45 tonight for my jan term class-everyone cross your fingers i get buddhims-no class friday and doesnt start until 2:15.
Happy Homecoming Day to all the seniors.  Have a great final HC game of HS.  
And don't forget(um erin) to send me actual pictures when its over-ya melissa when you get an actual tangible senior picture, send it up:)
but the upside in all this is:

2-two closets

this is the song i just told you about
it's sad-i wonder who it reminds me of:(

You look so peaceful sleeping, 
You don't know that I'm leaving, but I'm gone. 
Well I did my best to beat 'em, 
But in my head, the demons said ""Move on"". 
When you wake up, you're gonna curse my name, 
But as some time goes by I hope and pray: 
When you think of me, 
Remember the way that I used to be, 
Remember the times I held you tenderly, 
Remember the way that I love you. 
I think about the night I met you, 
I swore I'd never forget you, 
Well, I won't. 
I think about the way you'll live and breath, 
inside my dreams forever, 
You'll be better when I'm gone, 
you'll be better when I'm gone. 
'Cause I know you're gonna fall in love again. 
I'm sorry this is how it has to end. 
But when you think of me, 
Remember the way that I used to be, 
Remember the times I held you tenderly,"

first off-GOOD WORK CALIFORNIA. despite what mary catherine thinks, this is the direction we need to be going in, and i for one am happy we will be paying less taxes-i don't understand why one wouldn't be happy.
i have my first test today-in 40 min-in econ-hopefully i'll do ok:)
school is good-i went home last weekend and i saw my bubba!! oh how i miss him.
but it can get pretty boring here on the weekends-now i can see why college students drink so much.
but i have class with paker today-for those of you who don't know he is te absolutely beautiful mormon football quarterback in my seminar class and it really makes my day
me and the roomie are haing a little ""tif"" right now-so to make matter worse i have taken te dvd player to yodit's room and when i am in the room i blast country music! but there are some great songs-if u still dl music dl mark wills remember me-i cry and cry and cry when i hear it
to micahel and mary-catherine-NOVEMBER 1st!! i cannot wait!! i miss you guys so much and can't wait to see you-maybe if jamie you wanted to a little road trip on ur bday come too!!!:)  i cannot wait till thanksgiving when we can all be together again-not many people here appreciate the humor we have-i just think they don't understand it!
i think thats all thats new: we're having a recall party tonight and my friend veronica's bf is coming up 2morrow so i tihnk we're gonna go to a bar in frisco
ok i love you all!
people send me mail! i wanna see picturs-ERIN SEARS IF I DO NOT GET SENT HOMECOMING PICTURES OF YOU, I THINK YOU WILL DIE-and the same goes for te rest of the seniors at the nade!
i never get any mail unless its from safeway-its so sad, the bank doesnt even send me mail:(

"event","so, lets look at it this way.  if you're reading this than you're, hopefully, living, (although i am superstitious...) so therefore life is inevitable. if life is inevitable, well then logic and science would point to death being inevitable as well. ever felt pain or fear, torture or turmoil? if you are living, i think its safe to say suffering is inevitable, within any tiny second of life.  suffering, mystics say, allows for divine inspiration and access to the universal knowledge which it is said we all hold. suffering is in a sense, then, the human condition; that singular and solid thread that weaves us all together, and believe you me we are indeed wound together nice and tight. we all suffer, therefore by honing in on our suffering, or better yet the aspects of suffering which allow for the reign of logic and reason breakdown for split seconds to centuries, you will be tapping into the universal truths instilled within all of us. so heres where free will comes in? you can tap into this knowledge which you have but do not know, sai ma non conisco, at any time you desire. the choice is yours. do you not believe me? im not sure if i believe myself, when in fact, it may very nearly be proven by everyone around us that life is nearly synonymous with suffering, which begets inspiration and 'divine' insight, may in turn beget enlightenment...which is ultimately death is the absolute end. simple.

"event","ill be your mirror, 
reflect what you are
      in case you dont know...
  ill be the wind, 
         the rain, and the sunset;
  the light on your door
          to show that you're home...

When you think the night has seen your mind,
inside you're twisted and unkind...
Let me stand to show that you are blind,
please put down you're hand...

CAUSE I SEE YOU...

Now I find it hard
to believe that you don't know 
   the beauty that you are...
 But if you don't,
   let me be your eyes
   the hand to your darkness,
     so you won't be afraid...

let me stand to show that you are blind...
please put down you're hand...

CAUSE I SEE YOU...


woa. that song just makes everything ok...psh like my life is really that bad anyway!

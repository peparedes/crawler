Just waiting to get carpet in the house so that I can get started on the nursery decor:)  Work's fun, I get to buy baby stuff CHEAP.  I've reunited myself with an old friend and boy does it feel good... I've missed her.  The baby's head down already, now I'm just waiting for 7 weeks to come and go.  I also need to start washing clothes.  Dairy Queen is my new best friend... I LOVE Misty Freezes, go buy one."

"event","I can't fucking believe this... I went to visit my mom and grandma about a week ago, and while I was there my grandma started to talk shit about my mom.  I have no problem with that because I had a few things to say about her myself.  So after we were done, my grandma wanted to assure that the conversation would stay between us.. and I thought it would.  Well, it didn't... my grandma told my mom EVERYTHING I said, and when I told my mom that my grandma was in fact the culprit and had started the whole convo.  she (my grandma) denied it! She was the one that said my mom was stuck up, ungrateful, rude, etc.  All I said was that it was unfair that my mom could go out and buy herself $60 necklaces, but complains about helping me out.  Now my mom's pissed at me, she thinks I'm lying about my grandma's part in it, and she basically just ruined my entire day (Seeing as how she called me to confront me about it at 10am).  DRAMA!"

"event","Today has been a very good one... I found myself a midwife and David got a job that pays $600 each week.  Considering the fact that I don't pay rent (only utilities) that's a TON of money, I'm also getting a job. At the local Goodwill
I can't wait... MONEY.  Now I can spoil my baby"

"event","We're moved in our new house, and I found out that not only is our rent dirt cheap, its totally FREE!  WTF, that's tits.  I still haven't found a doctor, but that's not too bad considering I have one last appt. in Bloomington.  I figured that I just might get myself a midwife... I had been considering it while I was living in Bloomington, but then decided against it for the baby's sake... but am now rethinking it.  Back to the house:  Every single time I walk into it, I get stressed bc it is so messy... I have so much shit to unpack, I just don't know where to start.  So I just hang out at my dad's until its bedtime, then walk across the street and sleep.  

The only thing I've managed to get done so far is painting the closets, and putting clothes in the dressers... what can I say?  I'm a lazy bitch.  
Oh and another thing, trying to get a hold of all my old friends SUCKS."

"event","Moving is such a pain in my ass... David and I could no longer afford our luxiorious apt. my dad decided to buy a house and rent it out to us for cheap!  It needs quite some work though, but other than that I love it.  It has 3 bedrooms, and is very spacious.  The only problem is that it's in Terre Haute, meaning I have to switch doctors and all that fun shit.  I have a date set for my baby shower, but seeing as how there are 40+ people on my list I may have to have two seperate showers... what fun!  I'm off to finish packing and moving."

"event","I did it!  On Friday, I graduated... it was the most awesome shit ever.  Needless to say, I didn't get a card from my mom or grandma.  I don't care though because they are both stuck up, and I don't like either one too much.  As for the job shit... it's not coming along so well.  I am currently $600 in debt, and have no money to pay for it.  I also don't have the money to pay for bills, so I don't know what I will do!  David doesn't have a job either, but he really isn't looking too hard, but I can't say anything to him about it because that makes me a bitch!  My friend Amanda and her baby have been staying here at my house for about a week now... I love them so much.  I'm in a really weird mood right now, and don't have a whole lot to say.  OH WAIT!!!  I find out what I'm having in 2 days!!!  I can't stand it anymore, I hope its a little girl, but if not that will be fine.  I've also only gained 4lbs since my last visit to the doctor, making my total weight gain 8lbs.  I'm a little worried but the lady assured me it was normal and that I proably did need to eat just a little more... I don't know if I can do that.  I eat so much as it is, I just have no vehicle, which means I walk 10 or more miles each day!  Well, I'm off to go eat something."

David is still in Bloomington, he didn't want to come with me, so I'm hoping that Tab or someone like her will let me spend the night with them... then maybe I won't be so bored!  I've got to go and get my clothes out of the dryer... that should take up some time."

Her babies weren't alive... so she's at the hospital right now getting her labor enduced.  That just made me cry and worry.  That would be the most horrible thing in the world to experience, especially on a day when you're supposed to find out something so great.  My heart goes out to ya hun."

I know for a fact that that is a load of bull shit because last week he told me that I only needed one, and that I could still walk, but would have to wait to get my diploma.  Now he's stating that I only have 39 (instead of 41) and that I won't get to walk at all.  I don't know what I'm going to do about all of that,  but that thing that some call ""senioritis"" is kicking in real bad.

The doc. I've been bitching about is coming along slowly.  I have like 2 days to finish it, and I don't have half of the shit that I need for it... and I can guarantee that I won't be able to get it all in 2 days.  Getting a GED is starting to sound pretty good right about now."

"event","Okay, the ""visitor"" is gone!  The night before he left, he had his mom buy him a case of beer, and thought that he would get drunk here at my house.  I don't think so... I don't even like this mother fucker.  Even though he is now gone, he has an excuse to come back... he left a bag of clothing, and some bathroom goodies.  David's sister and best friend drank the case of beer, leaving him NOTHING.  He's called a few times, but no one is ever home... and I discovered $6 in a cream cheese container found in his bag of goodies! *thanks*  I just hope he doesn't ever try to take advantage of someone again... he tried to tell us that David's sister said that he could stay, which I know for a fact is a lie, because I had asked him that already (What an idiot).  I went to a place called ""Cashland"" and applied today... I hope they call me back or something.

I had time to work on my documentary, but it turned out like shit, so I have to do it over again, along with 20 chapters of additional schoolwork in order to graduate on time... which is one week from this Saturday, hope I can do it!"

"event","FUCK!  I'm so PISSED right now.  The ""visitor"" that I have mentioned left today, and I thought it was for good.  So, when David and I got home we were surprised.  He was waiting for us in the carport, with another bag of his SHIT.  I couldn't believe my fucking eyes... my adrenaline is just rushing through my veins, and I've been sitting here hinting at the fact that he isn't welcome here, and will never be.  (He's just stupid, adn can't take a hint!).  I'm doing everything in my power not to get up and punch him in the face or kick him in the nuts.  I'm just pregnant, and a big pussy. I will say something though, real soon.

As for yesterday, I finally got to take a camera home, so last night David and I went to a graveyard up the road and recorded some shit... nothing ""spooky"" happened, but that won't be my only stop.  Other than that, my day sucked.  Maybe that's because, I'm a lazy, boring person."

He hasn't even asked if he could stay yet, and I don't remember asking him if he needed a place to stay (that's because I never did!).  I told David how I felt about it, and he told me that he would ""politely"" ask him to leave.  So here I am waiting at a friend's house so that I don't have to be home in case of a fight... I just hope that David doesn't feel like Mr. Nice-Guy and pussy out, but if he does I have Plan B.  My friend's mom.  She told me that she would be more than happy to ask him to leave... she also stated that she had a Stun Gun.  Bring on the violence"

"event","So, David's sister lives with us, and now she's brought along a boy.  Not just any 'ol boy, one that decides to spend the night (because his momma kicked him out on his ass), and doesn't ask the lady in charge (that being me).  David's sister thought that she liked him, but quickly changed her mind. She told me that he's hot and nice, but way to stupid for her.  Before I left for school this morning, the two of them were entangled on my couch (for the second day in a row!) So, not only is she leading him on... she's allowing him to think that he can stay at my house for as long as he wants.  I don't know who the hell this dude thinks he is, but my house isn't the fucking Holiday Inn, nor is a sign posted that says ""Dicks stay free.""  All I do know is that if he plans on staying one more night, he's in for one hell of a bitch-fest. This means WAR...

P.S.  I've known this ""boy"" for about two years, so why do I feel like I have to be nice, because I know the second I open my mouth he'll wish he was DEAD."

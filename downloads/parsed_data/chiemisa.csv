(&lt; &lt;&nbsp; me=drowned rat on returning home. seriously. i actually had water dripping off me.

and argh rly duno if i want the dolls now :s firstly, they are ridiculously expensive... secondly if i ever decided it was worth it and did get one, i suspect it wud get photographed sometimes and possibly get its clothes changed occasionally... but i can so see it just sitting on my shelf doing nothing for aaages. But then they are so pretty... especially yder. argh. i think i shud stick to my shana buys for a while since i actually use the stuff i get from there... everyone loves what ive bought so far :) be warned ppl, most likely shana will be the source of all your presents this christmas... &gt;: D mwa-ha-ha

anyways yes. i think dolls will go off the list of things wanted for now. i dont want them badly enough for it to be worth it... and this art course is so damn expensive!! i mean i knew it wud be... but still. its mad.. which reminds me i shud check daily info for jobs...

my friends band (called Focal Point i think?) was pretty good, they played as part of a festival it seems, but it was so strange to see art student rob be guitarist rob...

went to feedback next, lots fun, though the music wasn't as good as last time, but we met and talked to lots of people which was nice :) AND I somehow managed to drink 5 JD shots (I bought 6 but gave one to a friend), and so got 6 JD dollars :D which on Friday I couldn't turn into a T-shirt sadly, but I asked at PT last night and they happened to have one left in exactly my size! so im quite happy now really, il take a picture and show it off soon :)

friday night was mad though as i had to go home, but we only got back at around 3/4ish... and then i needed to pack and cycle home right after! which meant i ended up getting home at something like 7:30am... then got up at 10 again to go to the family reunion. which was quite nice, got to see aunts/uncles/cousins etc. 

went to PT at 9pm, just missing happy hour which was a bit annoying. Josh etc were already there though, so we werent alone :) met a bunch of his friends from college which was fun, everyone was all friendly and chatty :)

So yeh, basically stayed in PT drinking/talking/dancing/playing games til 3am :p so much fun, I should go to PT more often..."

oh well. going out tomorrow at least, I shall be seeing a friend of mines band, and also going to feedback, which will be fun I hope... though I'm now really short on cash, which means drinking will be very restricted (bah)

The second of which has once again had items deleted from it coz I can buy things online now! :D an ability which really should be excercised alot less coz my brain doesnt seem to really count expenditures that are either in foreign currency or digital currency. Shana Logic, being an American site, does both, which means my sense of how much I'm spending is severely impaired. But, meh, I'm getting things :) retail therapy is a great thing, truly. And having parcels arrive for you is kinda exciting :p<br /><br />anywho I had better go, seeing as I'm still in PJs and I'm meant to have been working today, and im going out this evening."

"event","Well I just woke up from a very interesting night out, during which I met some very interesting people, including one from halls who i had heard about a few times but hadnt had the honor of meeting. that was an interesting talk... and quite a scary coincidence to be honest. going out with them again tonight, theres a metal night in town with free entry :D glad we met coz theyre very nice, friendly ppl, who i wierdly enough get on with. so, yay :) but also at the same time confusion.. ^^;
a guy came and danced with me too, which was fun, and it wasnt sleazy it was fun random dancing to manic rock music :D made me laugh :) i like him (as a friend sorta guy obv), i shuda got his number prolly but i wasnt rly thinking.. ^^;

drank way too much last night though. had 3 strong vodka cokes, a tequila shot, a snake bite mixed with a vodka shot, and a JD coke. some marks of how drunk i was are 1) i started dancing on a practically empty dance floor in front of many people, 2) i fell off my chair, 3) I forgot for an instant where i was when i woke up and then didnt know how i got there (still dont), 4) i was lying on the pavement while we were waiting for the bus, using my scarf as a pillow, 5) I found my boots under the kitchen table and I don't know how or when they got there. I told myself i wasnt going out or drinking last night... or tonight actually but i dont see that happening so meh. whatever.

guna go make myself some breakfast. yes, breakfast at 1am, but i dont care, and u cant judge me."

I ought really to work but i can't motivate myself... everything sucks.

At least I got my sketchbook out though, which is progress. Can't say I like monoprinting much though... it's ok, but I need more than a day to actually enjoy it... especially as it wasn't even a day, just a mere 2~3 hours or so...


Joined the Japanese, Film, and Alternative Rock societies today, and got sooo many freebies :D MIGHT sign up for snowsports tomorrow but I don't think I'll actually beable to make any of the events, cash/time wise, so I might pass... shame as they had a great deal on a trip in January :( only 335 pounds? I think, for a weeks holiday snowboarding/skiing, with a weeks pass for all the ski lifts, and hotel fees included. I forgot where the destination was but it looked so good...

meh, though, I'd rather go to Japan than go snowboarding this winter to be honest, even if my friends are all busy with Uni entrance exams... I would hope I could see at least Manami and Takumi at some point, if only for a day. And I'll get to go to Harajuku and stock up on my wierd and wonderful Japanese goodies :D

I'll need to go with a practically empty suitcase though if I'm guna fit all the manga etc that I wana buy in there, and bring it back :p ahhh well. I'll sort it out, somehow...........

Phoenix Wright: Trials and Tribulations update: Have completed four out of the five cases, and started the fifth tonight. Dunno what I'll do when I've completed that... try and get the remainder of the Chocobo cards I guess. And play old pokemon games... and by old I mean yellow. yes, yellow. But I don't care, it's nostalgic and I never played it, so hmph.

Oh, and another yay, should be seeing a bunch of friends tomorrow, and a class reunion from my first school has also been arranged, which should be interesting :D though I'll probably end up huddled in a corner due to not knowing how to talk to the people who see eachother all the time but who I havent seen for about 5 years now.. but oh well ^^;

"event","&nbsp;Just to sum up today...

'the banks of the river thames will burst sometime today'

Yay. So does that mean we will be stranded? Or just a bit wet? Or what? Coz the helpline isn't being very useful on that front apparently. Just tells you there is a flood warning for your area and you should prepare to evacuate (yay for stupid recorded messages). I need to know what parts of Grandpont will be most effected, and how bad they think it will be!

On another note, I can't work today. Which should be good, except that it means less money *sob* and I need that money to shop in France and Barca! And to get mums birthday present..... argh.

Then there's the REASON I can't work, which is that I've lost my bloody voice. Actually lost it. I can't talk above a whisper, and when I try these wierd high-pitched squeaks come out, as opposed to words (no comments there about how that's what I do anyway please). It sucks, I can't call people and talk to them when they aren't online! There is text messaging but that's not so useful when you have a limited balance left on your phone.

Argh and I really wana read the new Harry Potter book!!!!! Mum's saying I can't go to town though, even though it's not far at all and I see no reason why I can't go, get the book and come back... hmph. Well at least I have lotr...

Actually, screw it I'm getting dressed and going in to get it anyway.

I shall update later on flooding if there are any further changes to the situation. If I can anyways."

"event","Well apparently, there is danger of flooding. And also apparently, we need to get ready to evacuate.

Actually evacuate.

wtf.

I mean really, this is so typical on so many levels.

I don't sleep for over 24 hours, then when I finally do get some sleep, early for a change, I am woken with 'Maya get ready, pack an emergency bag, we need to be prepared to evacuate!'

Then of course in the middle of all this, once its gotten to the point where I'm thoroughly awake, mum decides to inform me that I may as well sleep, as there is no point in staying awake to see if it does or doesnt flood.

Screw that I'm completely bloody awake now!!!!!!!!!!

Then after all this there is of course the fact that it is supposedly the middle of the summer, and we are being warned of floods. That is so typical England there just aren't even words....
I will be so p**sed off tmr, floods or no just because of this. ugh and I thought I would finally be back on normal (ish) sleeping patterns.......*groan*

Damn emergency packing."

Costs a bloody fortune.

I spent just over 90 pounds today alone on acrylics, a palette, a palette knife, brushes, a ruler, tape, a glue gun...
The list goes on.

And I still don't quite have everything on the list (&lt; &lt; Though if I dig around the house I'll probs find alot of it so should be fine... but still, so expensive! I shall have to try to be sparing with my materials usage... ugh.

Sarah's gone home so I'm now sitting here with nothing to do really. Though I suppose there are things I could be doing such as clarinet practise... but meh, don't really wana. I guess I'll jus curl up somewhere with my DS...

EDIT

Be it due to my low expectations or my lack of memory of the book, The Order of the Phoenix wasn't actually that bad. In fact I actually liked it (except for a slight inconsistancy toward the end of the film, and the cheesiness of Harry's last line).

Oh and apparently I look hot and italian, according to this random guy called Carlos. That was wierd :p *lol*"

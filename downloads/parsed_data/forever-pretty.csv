my insides come outside
i taste the sweet lining
my stomach is pouring
with moaning and whining

collaps to my knees
try to hold in the tears
choking myself
with my own darkened fears

why do i bother
with boredom and hate
when all that there is now
is cold dimming fate

telling myself that
it's bad isn't working,
the way that i had it,
the pain is just lurking

finding an exit
whenever it can
my hate consumes me
with my own bloodied hand

...damn i'm sooo bored...if only i had money...then i wouldn't be sitting here with no money...i would then have money, and therefore would be sitting here WITH money...i need cash...i'll take what i can get though...i guess i'll just sell an old friend that tempts me...he deserves to die..."

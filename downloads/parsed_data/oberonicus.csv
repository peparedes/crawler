"event","Lot to absorb in one day.  Adam,  some things you might be interested in knowing;  through email though,  I don't want to post it.  I'm supposed to inform both you and a guy named Steven of certain facts.  Actually there's a whole story I've been asked to relate,  but I'm only willing to tell you guys what I know is true.  I told him he really ought to do the telling himself;  I'm not sure why he thinks I would be any more credible--i could very easily be lying for him.  So Adam.  if you're interested,  there is a situation that Kenneth wanted you to know about (you can tell this Steven if you know him);  Kenneth thinks you two are the only friends he thinks might care.  And if you are his friends,  I'd think you would want to know. In any case,  if you do,  give me your email address and I'll tell you just what I feel I can be sure is true;  after that I wash my hands of the situation entirely.  Kenneth,  its not that I don't care about your problem,  but I don't want anyone thinking I'm on anyones side-- I would like to have a friend in Charleston when I get there and I don't want Lizz to think we're in cahoots.

Anyone see the debate?"

"event","Apparently everyone is,  understandably,  taking advantage of THEIR ability to stay uninvolves,  robbed from me so violently last night.  I'm leaving for Birmingham now;  Ericka and I are eating at Suryn(?) which she says is really good--if you don't have advice,  at least wish me luck."

"event","So there seems to be a growing consensus that I am either someone named Brandon or,  more popularly believed,  Kenneth.  I kind of brought this on myself by throwing myself into the mix with a bunch of complete strangers,  and asking someone who obviously needed some sort of privacy to be her ""friend.""  Being kenneth as far as this person is concerned is apparently not a very endearing position,  and looking at  the information I've gathered so far even not knowing its veracity the situation is oviously fucked up enough for suspicion to be ever-present and interrogations to be strict.  
But since I am a stranger to her and all of you I have the luxury that none of this hurting my feelings.  You all do seem fun in writing and it would've been nice to know a Chalrlestonian prior to moving,  so I hope You will soon realize that I am not Kenneth or Brandon,  and when you do,  tell lizz so she can comment on my entries fearlessly.  Sould I put a picture up?  I'm not very computer savvy,  but I might be able to figure it out.  Or someone can do it for me.  If you continue to think I'm either of them,  let me know so I can stop addressing you all together.

If you are reading this Kenneth,  I'm sorry for any offense,  but you pulled me into a shit storm I'd rather not be in.
Unfortunately,  it seems that by commenting in Lizz's journal,  getting accused of being Kenneth (GASP), and investigating why that's bad by talking to Kenneth,  Kenneth somehow now thinks I can help him,  that I have some influence.  It doesn't make sense for a bunch of reasons.  
Now I really need some advice.

Not very many minutes ago I made a life simplifying decision not to get involved in an awful tale of pain and betrayal,  and was ploddind along on my way to forgetting it,  but leaving myself logged onto hotmail.  Apparently,   my darling Ericka couldn't resist the email with ""To the loony bin"" for a subject,   and she read the proposal of a certain Kenneth Lipp that I had failed to delete after I ignored it (Like I said, Kenneth,  if you read this,  I'll go ahead and apologize for what are bound to be mean comments.  I have no reason to dislike you yet,  but you are ending up to be a big hassle at the very least).  His proposal offered me 200 bucks to come to Birmingahm tomorrow and let him prove something to me.  As this is being read to me by my sweet angel,  I  begin to realize that she has already decided that I am going to participate.  And no,  not even because of the money;  because of how convincing she thought (and only she could,  you all should read the drivel) the man expressed his emotions and dedication to his estranged love (in actuality quite frankly because my girlfriend thrives on passing on and especially participating in gossip.  by the way,  if Lizz is reading this,  she wants you tell her the whole story from break-up till now.  i'm obligated to tell you her email is girlpoopsthenewlove@hotmail.com,  but please save me the headache of having to hear the story myself by not responding ). 

 I really don't think he expects me to take the money,   I'm not sure he even has it,  and I might not if he proves anything near as noble as Ericka is hoping to see (or see crumble disastrously);  but if he doesn't,  I have no problem parting him from his cash.  He also said no matter what I find out I'm not to tell Lizz,  which,  c'mon Kenneth,  is totally lame.  There's no way you would be putting forth the energy unless you thought I would tell her or somebody else who would-- you're just saying that to add a hint of extra sincerity.  But since you did say it,  and also because no matter what the truth is, Lizz's talking restraining order and I want no part of that,  I'm keeping whatever I see and hear to myself.  Even if God almighty testifies on your behalf,  he's going to have to repeat himself to someone else if the word is to get out.

  I'm not trying to be mean,  but look,  first of all:  I'm being forced to do this by my lovely but nosy sweetheart who said I participate or she would break up with me nad go find, and I quote directly,  ""to make  the search easy,  the next guy I see witha bigger cock;""(She wasn't serious about at least half and hopefully all of that,  but when she gets cruelly ""witty"" she means business) and secondly because I really don't want that Lizz girl mad at me, cause if everything I've heard is true,  then she's had enough bullshit to last her a while.So Lizz,  if you're reading this,  I'm sorry,  but she's making me,  and don't worry,  you still won't hear from me or about this unless you come to my journal (and hopefully this is the last entry to be dedicated to this topic;  i feel queasy dealing with this kind of stuff).

Oh,  yeah,  I said I needed advice.  And Kenneth,  to keep from getting offended,  you might want to skip the next part.  
Although I don't know why she need's one, I don't yet, anyway,  Lizz was threatening a restraining order.  Since I think she still believes I'm kenneth,  I can't expect her to read this to offer an opinion,  but those of you who know him,  should I be at all worried about meeting up with him?  I mean,  not as in ""do I need a piece,""  but is there any temperament I should be wary of?  Is him doing this suprising or typical of him?  Ericka really wants to come,  and I want to know if that's really such a good idea.  I mean,  it's weird enough that he wants to prove anything to me,  since I've never met him in person and only spoken a few times electronically;  I can only imagine what kind of bizarre ""proof""  he might have.  Please let me know so I can be on my gaurd. 
I'm already exhausted thinking about tomorrow.  He's hasn't suggested a time and place to meet yet,  maybe I'll luck out and he'll forget.  But he seem's a little too close to crazy to forget."

"event","JohnnyShades,

My name is Jon,  and I don't think we've met.  Feel free to request more information but be prepared for disappointment unless you like rough gay sex;  in that I case I imagine it would be pretty hard to disappoint you.

Western Civilization (the class,  not the actual civilization) seems to be peopled by the foremost experts on American football who also believe that ""polis"" is Greek for police,  by the way Roll Tide and it's not.  If anyone reading this has had Dr. Mariot for a history class,  I wonder if you could answer a question for me... Did he use his class as an evangelical engine?  We've been assigned to attend a christian worship service,  and although the assignment was at least non-sectarian,  Dr. Mariot is himself an ordained Presbyterian minister.  Don't get me wrong;  I think that church is a viable cultural experience (though I'm not sure whether attendance would prove to have any substantive educational benefit beyond the particular church attended;  it's almost impossible to gain an ecumenical perspective from any denomination's worship service)-- I'm just wondering if this sort of assignment will prove to be a general christo-centric trend in his teaching method.

I personally consider it polite that when you get up to pee in the middle of the night,  and your girlfriend or roomate is asleep,  you wait till morning to flush so you avoid waking them,  especially if you have an especially loud commode.  
When I turned on my computer this morning I found  my desktop wallpaper changed to a picture of a toilet bowl,  its seat up and its contents yellow tinged. This is the first time she's ""mentioned"" it,  but apparently Ericka,  my sweet little boo,  doesn't appreciate my courtesy;  she thinks I just forgot or don't care,  that nobody refrains from flushing for the sake of potty polity.  Does anyone else practice this courtesy?  I need a little back up.  I'm going to end this line of comment now before I turn into Tim Allen and start defending the male need to fart into jars and save it,  or whatever other butt-patting,  cock-slingin, quirkily disgustingly endearing activities my gender by nature apparently regularly engages in;  but I do think it's nice to try and be quiet when others slumber,  especially others with boobies.

mr Ezell,  I certainly hope that I haven't received my last comment from you,  since I do enjoy your writing ever so, however couldn't be coerced to actually read your journal under threat of being slowly enveloped by one of Paris Hilton's anal sex induced hemorrhoids while she reads selections of Jewel's poetry.  Your last comment actually caused me to sprout darker,  longer,  more lush pubic hair;  and thanks to your approval of my manhood my girlfriend even lets me touch myself when she makes me watch her fuck my best friend.  A few more words of encouragement from you and I might even be able to have an orgasm without first having to see the last ten minutes of ""Lucas,""  ""Pretty in Pink,""  and ""St. Elmo's Fire.""  You are truly the penultimate guru of Manhood."

"event","I thought maybe if I only made an entry every week or so,  I'd have accumulated enough interesting things to tell.  Utter failure.
The Pixies are coming to Birmingham with the Thrills,  and if anyone out there has a ticket that they can't stand having,  I will gladly relieve them of there burden.  In case any of you don't know,  they're playing Oct. 12 at Boutwell;  no idea how much or what time.  Anybody know how old the member's are?  Specifically,  not just ""really old.""
I guess that's it,  except: Kenneth,  I don't really know you,  so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt,  but some of it's a little hard to swallow.  You probably know that.  
This pitiful.  Maybe I'll try again later."

"event","So now I've got this journal,  and the names of people I barely know as friends (sweetie,  you must have spelled your name wrong,  and even if they read what I write in here,  it's a sad sad image.  Everything's a popularity contest.  I can't compete with Ezell;  daily he boasts 5-10 comments- knotches on his editorial pistol.  Sure I've got opinions,  and he's a turd-face,  but he's obviously paid many people to comment on his blogging and has therfore created a Live Journal Sinatra/Fainting girls hysteria.  I'm sure he often sinks below Pultizer in the yellowness of his entries (in between fistfulls of boogers),  and plagarizes the established genious so easy to glean and disguise from the masterful authors of Highlights Magazine.  
So I suppose I should just yield silicon-tiled floor to that comment hoarding psuedo-diarist,  and hope that the honest readers drawn into his sensationalists text-traps can somehow wander out with enough energy to comment on the little people's little thoughts.

I said good day sir."

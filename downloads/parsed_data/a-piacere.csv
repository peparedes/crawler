"event","holy moly, last night was a lot of fun.... for the most part. sarah marina and i went to bryans and got the party started around 10. i had a fifth of burnetts and while i didn't recall the act of drinking 3/4 of the fifth, i do remember seeing the near empty bottle in the table. YUCK that thought makes me feel sickly. so pretty much marina and eric made out alot, sarah got mad, as did i because it was a bitch move, i ended up kissing jensen at midnight, then i slightly remember being in the bathroom with sarah and marina, me puking in the sink, sarah in the toilet and marina manning the shower. truly a gross yet hilarious moment. they were ready to party some more at that point and i just remember passing out over the toilet and then being carried into a really comfortable bed. apparently every single person there came in to try and get me up but i was out. i finally woke up at like 5 and realized i hadn't checked in with my parents so i went to try and find my purse and couldn't. i had a new heart attack because my purse had just been stolen for the second time the night before (digital camera no. 2 gone) but finally sarah found it like wedged under a couch. for about the next 2 hours i talked to a very drunk sophie (HILARIOUS and sorta unbelievable) got lime juice shot directly into my eye, went to ihop and then finally back to sarahs to sleep."

"event","i hate him i hate him i hate him. AHHHHHHH. why can't anything just ever fucking work? i'm so sick of this feeling. i always think i can handle seeing him, but i just can't. its just waaaaayyy to hard for me to except how much hes changed, he just isn't the same person he was like 3 years ago. like even when i saw him, it just still wasn't the same, like even though it was good, it just made me that much more sad because i remembered what we used to have and just that hes not the person anymore and i will never be able to see him in that light again. its like i've been obsessing over someone who hasn't existed for about 2 years. and then with cory. god what a fucking asshole!!!!!!!!!! whenever he makes me sad, i make myself think about chandler because it makes me be like- ha, don't give yourself that much credit cory, because i could never feel as much for you as i felt for chandler, you're just not htat special and you never will be. but that chandler isn't even real. it was him before he matured and found out that there was more to life then me. i guess its just hard for me to understand because i have lost feelings for people, but only when i never really liked them that much to begin with, like i always knew that i could never feel really deeply for them. but chandler actually loved me, he loved me so much that despite all my insecurities and always feeling completely inadequate, i just couldn't deny that he really did. i guess thats why it hurt that much more because at the time there was nothing i had ever been so sure of in my life. omg and three years later, just seeing him brings me back to square one. i used to think the answer was finding someone else that i could love the same way and have that same closeness with, and while i failed many times miserably at making that happen, i did actually find that with jared, who TOO ended up being an asshole. then there was cory who for the first time in a LONG time, i didn't have to force myself to feel a certain way for him, it just happened. nothing about him turned me off, even though he had many bad qualities. and now thats just shit. every guy that i've even liked in the certain way that just feels unmistakably like love, has ended on they're terms, but every guy whose felt that way about me, its ended on my terms. does this happen to everyone? i'm just not attracted to guys that are attracted to me. then this whole fucking purse situation just makes me sick to my stomach andi hope that whoever did burns and rots in hell. i'm so fucking frustrated with life, mainly because i can't shake this feeling, despite my efforts."

"event","i want carson so bad. he's such an adorable cat, and he deserves the best home, which i KNOW i could give him. it makes me so incredibly sad to think that each time i go back to the shelter, he might not be there. while it would sooo good for him to get a good home, part of me would just miss him so much, and i feel like sooner or later my mom will realize that we DO have room for another kitty, and if i'll eventually be able to give him a home, and hes gone, ahhh i just don't know what i'd do. i started crying sooo hard last night thinking about it, i just feel like we'd be a really good match, and that angel would like him too. on the other hand, if i did bring him home and it make angel so jealous that she ran away, i could never forgive myself. all i want to do with my time is spend it at the shelter hanging out with the cats and giving them all the love and attention they deserve. i'm trying to convince my parents to have a vegetarian thanksgiving this year."

"event","i've just started volunteering at this cat shelter in arlington called purrfect pals. my job title is ""cat socializer"" so pretty much the whole time i just get to sit and hold kitties and just love them. its really the best volunteer job i could have ever stumbled across. it makes me incredibly sad though. all these cats are just soooo wanting of any kind of human affection, and they're just so appreciative. i wish i could take them all home or atleast find them good homes, because some of those cats have been there for almost a year, just stuck in a cage. i went into the ""behaviorally challenged"" room where all the cats are out of their cages just roaming freely, and this big furry grey cat name zeus just wants me to carry him around like a baby. he literally latches on to me and just gives me hugs and kisses. then theres the really sick cats who are also just so sweet, and barely ever get human contact except for when they're getting treated. and the sad thing with those cats, even though i get to hold them, you're supposed to like wear gloves and a scrub and all this stuff so protect the other cats, so its just not the same. i was so drained by the time i left there that i nearly fell asleep, and actually did for a few seconds, like 5 million times on the freeway. i HATE that, trying to drive when you just can't stay awake. and iwas driving all the way back from arlington, and i was scared out of my mind that i was going to get into a car accident."

"event","wow, so last night, shit just really hit the fan. things have been really weird between myself and maddie and kathryn, and they've just been hella standoffish and bitchy towards me for a really long time. so finally last night (when i was drunk) i just couldn't take it anymore and i started yelling and screaming at them, which led to this huge screaming and crying match in the playground parking lot, which was heard and witnessed by all. if people didn't already think we are out of our minds, they sure as hell do now. pretty much what it boiled down to is that ever since we started becoming friends, all that they'd heard about me was all of the awful rummors that most people have heard. so they said that from the start, they were reluctant to trust me and get close to me, and once they finally did, they just lost all respect for me once i started seeing cory. they couldn't understand how i could disrespect myself in such a way, so they then saw no reason why they had to be nice to me and respect me. while i can understand where they're coming from, due to the fact that they've both led completely sheltered lives, the situation with cory had absolutely nothing to do with them, and if anything, while i could have used their friendship and support when they thought i was doing something shitty, they just bailed out, secretly feeling ashamed to be my friend. because if i was like that with cory, the only guy i've liked or been with besides ian in the 2 years we've been friends, then OF COURSE that gives a legitament reason to pronounce all of those rummors as true. so while we're having this conversation, maddies like, ""first and foremost, you need to apoligize for basically calling kathryn a bitch, because thats exactly waht you did"" and i'm just sitting there like, well i'm sorry if i hurt you feelings, but you HAVE been a bitch to me for a REALLY long time, over something that had in no way anything to do with you.  then it proceeds to be this lecture of how they can't believe that i would bring shit up infront of people at the keg, as well as how many people, on a daily basis, talk LOADS of shit about me, and think i'm an awful person. so basically i got to depressed and upset to defend myself in a way that would make then understand where i'm coming from, so its been left at me being completely in the wrong. this morning i woke up after dreaming about it all night, and usually when i have dreams with such awful feelings associated with them, i wake up to being releaved that it was only a dream. instead i woke up to realize that no matter what i do, no matter how hard i try to prove people otherwise about who i really am, no matter how much i abstain from having anything to do with guys to the point that i am repulsed by the one guy in the world whose ever treated me right, people still think i'm this discusting whore whose partially insane, and if they give me a chance, any of my actions that are slightly relevent to something they've heard about me, like kissing a guy or liking someone or any other normal human behavior, they just decide its not worth being associated with me. its 414, and i literally got up like 10 minutes ago. if my mom hadn't yelled at me to get up and question if theres something wrong, i'd still be in a very deep sleep. she probably thinks i'm on drugs, which is just great. i have that depressed feeling where you've jsut lost your appitite, all you want to do is sleep, and you jsut generally don't know what to do with yourself. its very reminicent of how it felt to be dumped by chandler and find out all of the terrible things that had happened while we were together, and that he just really didn't care."

its a wonderful thing to get your braces off.... oh how much brighter life now seems..

i'm completely stressed out about the sats. not only i have never taken them, i bombed the psats, i'm an awful test taker, and the exam it THE morning after homecoming. looks like there will be no getting crunk in the club.... or after the club, or any form of the club. gah.

i'm starting to REALLY want a boyfriend. is that wrong? i mean good lord, this is the longest i've ever been single, and its not just a small amount longer, its like ALOT longer. i haven't been crazy about someone (and had them be crazy about me aswell) for such a long time. i really miss it.

so far i've been really good about getting up in the morning and making it to school and cheer on time. it feels good. i'm a perpetually late person, and i hate it! but i'm turning over a new leaf.

CURSE THOSE GIRLS! it seems like all of this summer i've just had to get over guys, which isn't my FAVORITE thing in the world. gah it sucks balls. and while i had alot of fun last night and met some cool people, it sort of gets kicked to shit when those people go to garfield and just want to tell me how cute chandler is and just what a great guy they think he is. they don't know chandler obviously. and how emily wagnor used to tell them all about me and all the awful things she'd do to me while trying to be my best friend. fuck that dumb bitch. grrrrr now i'm all angry and i don't know what to do with myself. perhaps i'll go shower and go to the village. i really need to get started on my homework, i have even looked at the assignment, and lets face it, summer isn't going to last forever. to bad i'm kindof looking forward to going back, simply because the sooner i do, the sooner highschool will be over... and its off to whatever comes next."

REDLANDS. (where my sister goes... and where i might go) its a REALLY small school. i absolutely hate thinking that i'm over him, like completely confident that i am, and i see a picture of him, with another girl, and i practically want to scream, cry, and bite something all at the same time. his girlfriend isn't even cute! ahhhhhhhh. and last night i was supposed to see him... but he never called me, and i woke up this morning just feeling blah and not REALLY caring that much, but i see him, and the fact that hes had the same girlfriend for like 2 years now, and it just reminds me of how much he hurt me and that i still haven't found anything that compared to him, but he has. i want to meet new people goddamnit.

on a brighter note... i went to the orthodontist this morning, and shes like, ""well they look about ready"" and i was like ""ready for what?"" and shes like ""well to come off, unless you ahve any concerns and things you think aren't right"" and i was like HA ""no no no, everythings great!"" so i might be getting my braces off in a month, which is just FANTASTIC. it caught me COMPLETELY off guard. i thought she was going to tell me i was like ready for rubberbands or something, but not like THE END. ahhhh that made me soooo happy. so now i'm going to reschedule my senior pics for after i get them off."

"event","wow the very start of summer and i'm already on lock down. so tuesday night, sarah and i were leaving pagoda, a little drunk, i was driving, and this raccoon comes barreling out into the road, and the brakes in my van suck, and i hit it. at the very moment i have a panic attack, make a wrong turn onto the 520 bridge going out to bellevue, and get off at the first exit. we pulled into a gas station, which was closed, got out of the car and went to sit and cry on the side of the building. sarah was just trying to calm me down when someone shines their flash light in our faces, and its a cop. sarah was like ""oh shes ok, she just hit a raccoon and shes just really upset because she loves animals so much"" and i was just like ""sir you don't understand, i want to be a veterinarian when i grow up etc. etc"" and i'm saying this threw whaling tears, mascara all over my face, then hes like ""how much have you laddies had to drink tonight"" and immediately were like ""nothing, nothing at all"" and hes like ""you wan't to answer that again, because i wouldn't have asked if i didn't already know the answer"" and we were like oh shit. so we told him we'd each had a few beers, and then hes like ""and which on of you ladies is over 21?"" thats when i truly started to panic. and i was like ""uhmm neither"" and he asked me who was driving, how old i was, and to see my license. now sarah and i had already been arrested a year earlier for shop lifting and our names are in the database, so we're freaking the fuck out. so he takes my license over to his car and i ask sarah if she had her lisence with her, and she'd like no (for some reason i thought she might be more sober then me... and perhaps at that moment she could just out and say ""oh by the way sir, i was driving not her"") then i take out my last piece of gum, rip it in half and give some to sarah, and we're both chewing like mad, because i had a feeling he was going to breathalize us. sure enough he comes walking over with the little machine and hes like ""do you have anything in your mouth?"" and i attempt the spit out my gum, which proceeds to get caught on my braces and drangle for a moment until i detach it. so mine was like a .06 and sarah blew a .08 (good thing we didn't say she was driving) so the cop was like ""heres whats going to happen, since you're both minors and i didn't see you driving, i can't give you a dui or arrest you, so all that i need for you to do is call your parents the have them come get you. now mind you i had just gotten the privilege of driving my van back so i was like ""FUCK"" so i called my oldest sister instead, who came and got us, but ended up telling my mom this morning about the whole event anyways. so basically i can't drive ever again, i'm on restriction for my last free night (i'm going to lopez on sunday and i work on sat) so fuck fuck fuck. i'm never drinking again."

"event","well another birthday gone. we started the night off with going to beppos and having a yummy meal. my friends got me the sweetest presents and made me feel really special. then we went back to maddies, waited for her bro to get alcohol, and just talked. then when he got back, we went down to callie's bon fire, which wasn't yet happening, and it started to rain, so we decided we'd go to gasworks to see if anything was going on.... but there wasn't. i was going to go back to my house to get my old cell phone so that i could have people's numbers to call and see if anything was going on, but my parents were still up and i didn't want to deal with that. then we ended up going back to magnuson, where kathryn got incredibly drunk, so we went to carmela's house. meanwhile, the whole kathryn and sophie fued is just brewing. the whole night it was like sophie pulling people aside and telling them how left out she felt and how unwanted she felt because nobody wanted to ride in her car and blah blah blah. then she kept being like well i'm just going to go home now, and of course i felt like i had to make her stay,  but at the same time iwas like well this is my birthday, i shouldn't have to fucking catter everyone and make sure that sophie is content at every moment, because i knew that i was the only who would have tried to make her feel better normally, and then i dont have as much fun because its just sophie and i, while everyone else is with kathryn, and OF COURSE kathryn and sophie just can't be within a foot of one another. but since kathryn likes to party and shit, everyone would rather hang out with kathryn then with sophie, so i get stuck sitting with sophie the whole night, while everyone else gets shit faced.  finally after the night had just officially gone to shit, i just got over it and iwas like there will be soooo many more days to kick it over the summer, its not like this night is the get all be all, so it just really doesn't matter."

"event","ahh last night was so much fun. first sarah, marina, maddie, kathryn and i were all at my house because we were having my oldest sister's bday party. there was so much good food, music, and alcohol, which lead to quite a few crazy drunks dancing wildly. then we left and went to a keg, which got broken up pretty fast, then we just went and met up with people in the hale parking lot. it was kinda boring, so we decided to have a DANCE PARTY outside of kathryn's car. haha everyone was like what the fuck are they doing (we were in a far corner of the parking lot... away from the crowd). after we couldn't move anymore, marina sarah and i went back to my house and decided we were going to walk up to dicks and smoke. on the way we got soooo fucking burnt, and once i got up to my place of employment i realized that there was no way my manager could see me like this. so we opted for going next door to get doughnuts. wow we got there and they had this deal for 14 doughnuts for 5 bucks. omg that was WAY to many... we soon realized while walking back, looking like homeless children, wolfing down these old stale doughnuts, as if we hadn't eaten in years. wow i hadn't laughed so hard in a looooong time. it was just so nice to be around sarah and marina, without anyone whom we'd feel embarresed being high infront of, and just letting outselves go fucking insane, snorting and being stupid like a bunch of freshmen who were smoking for the first time.  ah good times."

"event","argggg. today i took a wrong turn and ended up right down the street from his house. all at once i just realized how fucked up things were, and how badly i did want to be with him, when all the while i knew that he was something that wouldn't fit into my life in any way.  and now when i perhaps do have space for him, in some sort of screwed up way, hes just dissapeared from my life completely. things we SOOOO much better when he still worked with me, and when he left i was all worried that i'd never see him again, but then he actually called me for the next two weeks, so we did see eachother. then i was like well maybe this wont be so bad, but then... NOTHING. its so depressing getting off work at like 3 in the morning, going home, and willing someone to call you, while you think up all the possible scenarios that could be keeping them from doing so. then finally i'll fall asleep after debating on whether i should just call him up and end up crying and screaming at him, or just try to forget about him. but subconsciously the only thing allowing my mind to just stop obsessing is the comfort that perhaps i'll just drift off, not hear the phone ring, but i'll get the message in the morning. not recieving a call that you've been hoping for all week is just somehow easier to deal with on a sunday morning, after a night of some kind of sleep, as opossed to after you've been up running around all freaking night, dealing with discusting drunk fucks, who refuse to go away even after theres just no food left! the sad thing  though is that chandler ended up calling me after work, and a while ago that would have been like such a reasurring thing that would have made me all happy, but this time i actually didn't give a shit. i was just like wow, i so badly don't want to talk to you right now, why did it have to be you not him. i officially hate boys that have it in them to make me feel this way."

GOD i really want marina to make it, but her motions kinda suck and i want to tell her so i can help her, but she really refuses to except any sort of critisism from me. she just gets so offended and like snorts off and ahhh it just drives me crazy that she thinks she can do everything without anyone's help (well mine in particular) and i can understand like other things that i don't have any more experience then her in, but cheer, i have two years more of experience, and she isn't going to make the squad if she doesn't start taking some advice. anyway, so because marina won't listen to me, i've been telling other people to go and tell her because she doesn't mind taking advice from them, and now apparently everyones been saying that sarah should make captain because its really good how she gives lots of constructive critisism, and well i should be one too just to add some fun. WHAT THE FUCK. if i were to tell marina exactly what sarah said, she'd just get all pissy and act like i didn't know what i was talking about, but when sarah does it marina just thinks she helps sooo much. (sarah in no way am i angry with you, just marina and the boy who speaks from his ass sometimes... err a little too much)"

"event","gah, sitting here before i have to get ready for the game.  i've been cleaning out my room to get ready for the new stuff and painting tomorrow.  my mom called me and said that her co-worker Marsha (jeff's mom) saw me at the last game and said that i just looked SOOOOOOOOO unhappy, and now my mom thinks something is terribly wrong.  and sarah if you're reading this, you know why i was so upset, and though it was over something soooo tiny (to some) it really made me upset, as were you by my behavior, and it kind of bugs me that i was the only one who apologized, when i think we both owed it. but whatever. ahhhh these past weeks have been so fucking stressful, good lord."

"event","good lord i hope it snows tonight, forcing nathan hale (if no place else) to close for atleast two days. yup that would be awesome. work today went by sooo slow and i even got off a half hour early because things were especially slow. my sisters gone, and its kinda depressing. it completely felt like break had extended on for another week because i'd stay up with her and her friends until the wee hours of the night, not really feeling like i had to go to school. now everyones gone back to school, and once again i'm an only child.  gah! i'm so upset because i can't find my charm bracelete anywhere; or my earrings and a ring for that matter. i'm beginning to really worry that some bitch ass mother fucking shit hole may have stolen them from my party, because thats the last time period i can remember wearing them.  but why would they steal a charm bracelete with my initials and things that represent me on them? not to mention its like a size tiny weeny because i have little wrists. ahhhh it just doesn't make sense. i hate lossing things, it drives me out of my skin! ahhhh. i really want to go to sleep but still need to shower and shit. god i REALLY hope it snows tonight. i so just wish to spend the duration of tomorrow in my pajamas, watching friends, fire going, kitten sleeping next to me, dog snooring, knitting at the ready, ahhh just complete relaxation. doesn't that sound butt loads better then school- ie falling asleep in class, then julting awake because of the extreme arctic like temperatures throughout the prison like building with noisy kids opening the windows complaining of how HOT it is in the fucking classroom! omg some people are crazy!!!!!!!!!!!! when your school is poor (no money for sufficient heating) and its like -a million degrees outside, theres no logical way that any part of that piece could ever feel TOO warm. GAH! arrrrrg already 11 which means i won't get to be until atleast 12. why don't i have the self motivation to remove myself from thrown (kitchen stool) and ""it's good to be Matt LeBlanc""? man i had a thought today while working- it is so possible that during the summer, chandler is going to come to dicks, and i'll just happen to be working that day in my blue bonnet and flamming dicks shirt, smelling of grease and everything i'm against, yelling at the top of my lungs to the grillers, because chandler is a pig ""10 HAM!!""  we have to call out all orders of hamburgers and all others over three burgers. quite embarrassing.  ah well. atleast i have my lisence, have a job and good grades, and thats more i can say for his man whore a-hole. i'm a very angry lady."

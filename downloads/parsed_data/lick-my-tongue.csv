woot.
I'm bored. like.. over the top bored.
and the boy i like is gay. not literally.. i don't think =\ but he acts gay when i'm around. it's stupid and bothers me. He prolly likes some other girl.  which sucks on my part. but is hella cool for the other girl, because he's a really great guy for sure. 
I'm such an emo fag right now. lmao.
i think that I'll go cut myself in the corner. lmfao. 
oh mannn. 

so patrick called me emo. which was un-cool. VERY un-cool. I'm not emo. grrr. I'll bite you the next time you say it. haha RAWRR. =] 

alright. so.. idfk what else to talk about. 

apparently my name means one who entagles men. 
but, i dont see how that is true, if I don't have a single ""man"" who likes me, or anything. gahh.
This sucks. 
I hate being single. =[ 

Fix it? 
please&thankyou.

LYRICS..
Loose Lips Sink Ships By A Change of Pace

So I made you lie!

And we both hope
This will pass by
Through are life lines
Standing broken

Come on tell me
You cant hurt me
Dont ignore the
Lies your bleeding

Entranced in noise
And words and phrases
All about you
Everyone was so right

I know something you dont know
You hid something obvious from me
I know something you'll never know
You hid something obvious from me

Envy sets in
And I hate you
For what you did
I will break you

Cry for help now
They cant hear you
Heres an offer
You cant refuse

Scream a little bit louder for me baby
Face the truth
That you baited so well

I know something you dont know
You hid something obvious from me
I know something you'll never know
You hid something obvious from me

Scream my name
At the top of your lungs
Help me to know
Why I should care

Destroy our past
I'll still have
These memories
You'll never take from me

I know something you dont know
You hid something obvious from me
I know something you'll never know
You hid something obvious from me

Scream my name!"

I was just reading back, from grade ten, and me being all omg. kemptville forever.
That would have happened. for suree. but.. my dad didn't want me. so it didn't happen and i'm still stuck in this hell hole i like to call picton.

so, i'm gonna use this for whenever i've got random thoughts in my head, and when somethings bothering me.

Right now, 
theres this boy, you see.
and i like him ALOT. but i dont think he likes me back. which sucks. horribly. but meh, whatever. i don't really care. 
My friends are all like go for him! but theres this one girl.. who flirts with him non stop, and it makes me angry sometimes, i dont even care about other girls around him, because its not like hes mine. so what, i like him. big deal, im not going to be jealous of every girl in his presence. thats not me. but its just this one girl. she has a boyfriend, but she chooses to cheat on said boyfriend and then flirts with people that she knows her friends like. I hate that about people. people like her bother me.  

ANYways.. i dont know what else to say. this boy.. is amazing. and really nice, andd i hope we're friends for..ever perhaps? =] mhm.

Love, Kassandra<3 


p.s i need new friends. any takers?"

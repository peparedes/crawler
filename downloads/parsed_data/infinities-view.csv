It's just one of those things
I was sitting by myself
And my thoughts started pouring out
Remember that time on our trip
You asked me where we were going
I said Barcelona
You said that's not what I meant
Maybe I'll never get it
I just don't think I'm like that
Don't like planning stuff out
It never happens that way

I'm like a vacuum bag That holds all that old dirt
Remember that time we found your mom's Valium and took it?

Don't hate me, don't regret me, don't ever forget me
Wherever you go, whatever you do, don't say I never loved you

That summer when we wore no shoes
And we danced on the Fourth of July
And we listened to your sister's records
And Frampton came alive
Even then you knew what you wanted
Even then I had no clue
I was just living in the moment
And the moment was all about you
Remember that time in LA
You asked we what we were doing
I said we're doing fine
You said here we go again

I'm like a vacuum bag
That holds all that old dirt
Remember that time we said we'd be together forever?

'Cause it matters to me
Can you hear me?
Everyday I ask the same thing

Will you ever know what happened to me?
It happens everyday
And you wonder what went on
It's there and then it's gone
Maybe I'm sentimental
And I start to reminisce
And every time I do
I still want to tell you this"

When your out on your own
If I crash on the couch
Can I sleep in my clothes?
'Cause I've spent the night dancing
I'm drunk, I suppose
If it looks like I'm laughing
I'm really just asking to leave

This alone, you're in time for the show
You're the one that I need
I'm the one that you loathe
You can watch me corrode like a beast in repose
'Cause I love all the poison
Away with the boys in the band

I've really been on a bender and it shows
So why don't you blow me a kiss before she goes?

Give me a shot to remember
And you can take all the pain away from me
A kiss and I will surrender
The sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead
A light to burn all the empires
So bright the sun is ashamed to rise and be
In love with all of these vampires
So you can leave like the sane abandoned me

There's a place in the dark where the animals go
You can take off your skin in the cannibal glow
Juliet loves the beat and the lust it commands
Drop the dagger and lather the blood on your hands, Romeo

You told me how proud you were, but I walked away
If only I knew what I know today
Ooh, ooh

I would hold you in my arms
I would take the pain away
Thank you for all you've done
Forgive all your mistakes
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To hear your voice again
Sometimes I wanna call you
But I know you won't be there

Ohh I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do

Sometimes I just wanna hide 'cause it's you I miss
And it's so hard to say goodbye
When it comes to this, oooh

Would you tell me I was wrong?
Would you help me understand?
Are you looking down upon me?
Are you proud of who I am?

There's nothing I wouldn't do
To have just one more chance
To look into your eyes
And see you looking back

Ohh I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself, ohh

If I had just one more day
I would tell you how much that I've missed you
Since you've been away
Ooh, it's dangerous
It's so out of line
To try and turn back time

Have we come to the ending?
Or am I just dreaming?
The music is gone now, the silence is strange
Can you call back that moment
On that day in September
When we first shared that secret
And everything changed?
Can you know what you meant
To a soul that was searching?
Can you know that I'm sorry
For all I've undone?
And know that in my heart
You were the only one

PETER
On that day in September it was so unexpected
The moment you kissed me, time seemed to freeze
Now I stand at a crossroad and stare at the question
If prayer were the answer I'd fall on my knees
But forward is calling and I cannot stay here
Nothing can change what you will always be
An angel sent to hold my heart and set me free

JASON / PETER
I've never been this bare / I've never been so scared
I've never felt such honesty / Don't stop we'll never leave
A moment of such peace / Each of us standing bare
Still you are here with me / Knowing who we have to be
Know as you hold my hand / I hoped and prayed
We're forever you and I / That you'd understand

BOTH

I know you're here in my heart

JASON
Please understand that I tried

PETER
Try to see it's not good bye
The act is beginning, the audience awaits

JASON
Let's stay in this moment, where secrets reveal
Here in a world where there's safety in falsehood
I have discovered the one thing that's real
That I love you and I've loved you from the start
And if you hold that close to you, we'll never be apart
Peter, please know I loved you...

PETER
God, I love you

BOTH
From the start

Boys have come and boys have gone
I've grown accustomed
I never really cared too much; don't get attached
Because I know them and what they're after

I let them in, we make some noise
They let themselves out, thats their choice
Boys will be boys...
The phone won't ring and I become some anicdote
And though I've had my fun, it gets lonely

But then came your kiss
And all I was missing was there in your eyes
Your lonely brown eyes
So please, say you'll stay
Say you'll never go away
My discarded heart has finally found a home
I know its love... you touch my soul

When I see you, I catch my breath;
Forget my sorrow
And I miss you before you've left
You are tomorrow
Here in your hands
I find a chance to make it through
To be somebody... Stay with me

I need your kiss
Cuz all I was missing was there in your eyes
Your lonely brown eyes
So please take my hand
Let me help you understand
Two searching hearts can rest and be made whole
I know its love... please let me touch your soul
Please let me touch your soul"

Did I plan doing all of this for the love of a man?
Well I let it happen anyhow.

Reason plays no part.
Heaven help my heart.
I love him too much.
What if he saw my whole existence
turning around a word, a smile, a touch?
One of these days, and it won't be long,
he'll know more about me than he should.
All my dreams will be understood.
No surprise
nothing more to learn from the look in my eyes.
Don't you know that time is not my friend.
I'll fight it to the end.
Hoping to keep that best of moments
when the passions start.
Heaven help my heart the day that I find.
Suddenly I've run out of secrets.
Suddenly I'm not always on his mind.
Maybe it's best to love a stranger.
That's what I've done - heaven help my heart.

A black and white picturesque park to walk in
A season in summer winter fall and spring
No time for worries or cares
A morning paper to bring in
Coffe and tea-cakes
Sweaters and bathrobes triumphant materials for fuck's sake
A romantic maneuver to outdo, him
Moments of gladness by your side
Wandering together in the dark of the night
In the fall coats we pulled out of the closet
Winter and mildew
Stained and sad
We pull them on both soft and glad
For warmth and each others hands
To grow old with you
And know that when our time is through
That we've made the best of this shattered glass
Of pieces and places of our past
Of midnights and memories that will carry us
Keep us and have made us last
Until that very day when we can smile
Look back and be happy we came this way."

It's funny when you find yourself
Looking from the outside
I'm standing here but all I want
Is to be over there
Why did I let myself believe
Miracles could happen
Cause now I have to pretend
That I don't really care

I thought you were my fairytale
A dream when I'm not sleeping
A wish upon a star
Thats coming true
But everybody else could tell
That I confused my feelings with the truth
When there was me and you

I swore I knew the melody
That I heard you singing
And when you smiled
You made me feel
Like I could sing along
But then you went and changed the words
Now my heart is empty
I'm only left with used-to-be's
Once upon a song

Now I know your not a fairytale
And dreams were meant for sleeping
And wishes on a star
Just don't come true
Cause now even I tell
That I confused my feelings with the truth
Cause I liked the view
When there was me and you

I can't believe that
I could be so blind
It's like you were floating
While I was falling
And I didn't mind

Cause I liked the view
Thought you felt it too

The Hand Gropes
The Ear Hears
The Pulse Beats

Without You
The Eyes Gaze
The Legs Walk
The Lungs Breathe

The Mind Churns
The Heart Yearns
The Tears Dry
Without You

Life Goes On
But I'm Gone
Cause I Die

Without You

Without You

Without You

Without You"

"event","No other song seems to put it more perfectly in this sleepless moment...

Seems like just yesterday
You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything, it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothin' could go wrong
Now I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You ma

de me feel alright
For once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside
'Cause I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

Swallow me then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside
Anymore...

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes"

"event","I noticed tonight that the world has been turning
While I've been stuck here dithering around
Well I know I said I'd wait around till you need me
But I have to go, I hate to let you down
But I can't stop now
I've got troubles of my own
Cause I'm short on time
I'm lonely
And I'm too tired to talk

I noticed tonight that the world has been turning
While I've been stuck here withering away
Well I know I said I wouldn't leave you behind
But I have to go, it breaks my heart to say

That I can't stop now
I've got troubles of my own
Cause I'm short on time
I'm lonely
And I'm too tired to talk

No one back home
I've got troubles of my own
And I can't slow down
For no one in town
And I can't stop now

And I can't slow down
For no one in town
And I can't stop now
For no one

Emotion keeps my heart on me"

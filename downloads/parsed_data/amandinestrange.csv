Today I learnt that my dear friend <lj user=""countb""> passed away late December.

James I will never forget the time we spent on MSN together, the cards you sent and the endless late night chats.  You were a beautiful soul.  I miss you.  I lost contact with you late last year caught up in my own life and problems which I did not want to burden you with.  You were so generous and so strong.  Life was not kind to you but you made damn sure it was not going to get you down.  You were an inspiration.

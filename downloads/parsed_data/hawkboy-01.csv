For the love of God.  How fucking long does it take to type two fucking half page letters.  i had to wait four hours for her to get off the fucking computer so i could get on.  because she had to do homework, which she asked for my help with, and didn't take my advice and complained about not being able to do it.  

one was a reconmedation letter for a new job she was pretending to apply for, and kept asking me what job she should apply, like it fucking mattered.  it took her a fucking damn hour to fucking decide.  now i know why she's been in community college for 5 years and dosen't know what shes going to do.
there i feel better"

"event","I haven't posted in lj in about a year, why you might ask haven't had anything to say.  my life isn't that interesting.  i go to work i come home, not really interesting.  well a while back i got a promotion at work, i'm not a customer service manager, aka a glorified cashier, but i get paid more and get full time.  nadia and i are looking at houses.  that's pretty much it.  see not much to say.

cut for length.
<lj-cut>
it was weird, for several years now off and on, i'm been rescearching dog breeds why you might ask, i like dogs and wanted to more about the veriouse breeds, and thought i study history and history is just rescreach so why don't i just find info on the dog breeds. but i diegress.  resently i was thinking about smokey, my family's dog from when i was young and it occured to me that i couldn't remember what she looked like.  so i spend about a hour or so (not very long really) looking through out family photo until i found a pic of her.  
<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/hawkboy_01/pic/000039cd/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/hawkboy_01/pic/000039cd/s320x240"" width=""243"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

when i was looking at this picture i remember her, and i missed her all over again.  i remembered how playful and full of life she was right up until the end. This is her store:  July 4, 1979 my mom and dad had just moved into the house they have now, my mom was very pregnant with my older brother (bday: july 28, 1979) they were at the house across the road setting off fireworks, my mom was sitting in a chair in the yard, the neighbor's dog nocked over one of the lit firworks and sent it straight at my mother, my dad got her out of the chair in time and everyone was fine.  years later my parents discovered that my brother was terrorifed of dogs, so much so that all a dog had to do was walk down the road and he was panic.  after i came along my brother and i were in the yard and two dogs came into the yard, so my brother (5) pushed me (2) down the basement steps and into the basement to get away from the dogs.  at some point durning this i fell and busted my head open (as my dad puts it) which means i needed stitches and got the ninja scar. so my parents got a dog to get him over the his fear of dogs, thus smokey. we had 13 wonderful years with her, she had puppies all but wolfen died as a pup, wolfen (basicly a black verison of smokey) got hit by a car running across the road to greet my brother, sister, and i after we got home from school.  near the end she couldn't move as well (probably athritis) but no she didn't die of old age, she died fighting another dog that had come into her yard.  But don't get the wrong idea she wasn't a mean dog she would bark around strangers, but never bit anyone, she just didn't like other dogs comeing into her yard, and would fight them all, when i was younger she fought and beat two dobermans. so i knew when she was around i always new i was safe.

"event","I haven't posted a message in about 6 months or so figured i'd tell this story here.  i'm living at my parents house at the moment for those who don't know.  anyway the house nearly caught on fire.  my parents have a wood stove, and we stovel the ashes into a bucket and dump it when its full.  well that bucket appearently had some some hot coles in it so it started to smoke shortly after i got on line tonight.   here's what happened i got on line, then it hit me that i had to use the bathroom (i've been haveing dyariha for a couple of days not really a big deal)  anyway when i went into the bathroom i thought i smelled smoke but that's really not unusale.  when i came out of the bathroom i noticed that the house was full of smoke (not really thick but you could see it) so i went into the living room, and there was my mom and sister sitting on their fat asses watching tv and my mom says ""go see why there's so much smoke"".  instead of one of them going down and takeing a look for themselves.  
so i go down and there it is the bucket with smoke comeing out of it.  so i shut the basement door to the upstairs, and take the bucket outside, and here is where i start makeing mistakes, i don't know if it is because it was 1am, or i was panaked or what, i go back into the house set up a fan so that it blows outside to vent the smoke, then i stretch water hose as far away from the house as possible, move the bucket so that it is by the hose then it the wind picks up and the bucket (which has up til now had just be smokeing with some embers glowing) catches on fire. so i dose it with the hose.  then i think that there might be some embers in the bottom that might cause a problem, then i think there it has been dry this year even though we had rain earlier in the day and the previous night i'd rather be cautious so i put down the sliding board my brother sister and i played on when we were younger down and poured the ashes out on it and drenched them. then i went back down stairs and waited for the basement to vent."

At the end of my thursday night class the egyptian adjunt professor informed the class why the united states still supports isreal even though the muslim world is the one with all the oil.  Then the professor goes into what he thinks is the reason, and that reason is that their is a global jewish conspriasy to keep the united states involved in isreal.  the professor then went into saying that it was this jewish conspiracy that killed jfk, because he was going to back out of isreal, is the reason why presedent bush sr was reelected in 1992.  Also as proof the jews control all banking in the united states."

"event","Warning to all VCU students.  Do not walk alone on the sidewalks of VCU at night, male or female.  There is a group of people harassing those who do.  If they see you walking alone at least one of the group will approach you.  Even if you try and walk away this member of the group will follow you, and continue the harassment.  The common name for this group is ""The Bible Humpers"", and no matter what they will do what it takes to force their religion on you, even if you are already a member of that religion.
Basicly, that is twice i've been walking back from my wednesday night class and had to deal with a Bible humper trying to stop me.  Tonight they guy actually walked with me from franklin to grace in order to tell me things i already knew.  Now, as a christain i understand spreading the good news, but their is a difference between that and trying to force your religion on someone. But surpriseingly he didn't tell me i was going to hell because i'm a sinner.
My question, why dose he think that college students in Religiously conservitive Richmond VA, haven't already been exposed to the good news of Jesus Christ.  And shouldn't the church that sent them be consentrated on the whole ""i was hungry and you fed me"" and that whole part of the message of Jesus.  In stead of paraphraseing the bible then asking for you to stop and 'pray with them'."

"event","Hey Girls; are you having trouble finding that perfect gift for the man in your life?  Well just in time for Valentines day here are some rules that a woman should follow when shopping for a man.  
stolen from  http://getamused.com/jokes/018268.html
<lj-cut>
Shopping For A Man 
Buying gifts for men is not nearly as complicated as it is for women. Follow these rules and you should have no problems.

Rule #1: 
When in doubt - buy him a cordless drill. It does not matter if he already has one. I have a friend who owns 17 and he has yet to complain. As a man, you can never have too many cordless drills. No one knows why.

Rule #2:
If you cannot afford a cordless drill, buy him anything with the word ratchet or socket in it. Men love saying those two words. ""Hey George, can I borrow your ratchet?"" ""OK. By-the-way, are you through with my 3/8-inch socket yet?"" Again, no one knows why.

Rule #3:
If you are really, really broke, buy him anything for his car. A 99-cent ice scraper, a small bottle of deicer or something to hang from his rear view mirror. Men love gifts for their cars. No one knows why.

Rule #4:
Do not buy men socks. Do not buy men ties. And never buy men bathrobes. I was told that if God had wanted men to wear bathrobes, he wouldn't have invented Jockey shorts.

Rule #5:
You can buy men new remote controls to replace the ones they have worn out. If you have a lot of money buy your man a big-screen TV with the little picture in the corner. Watch him go wild as he flips, and flips, and flips.

Rule #6:
Do not buy a man any of those fancy liqueurs. If you do, it will sit in a cupboard for 23 years. Real men drink whiskey or beer.

Rule #7: 
Do not buy any man industrial-sized canisters of after shave or deodorant. I'm told they do not stink - they are earthy.

Rule #8: 
Buy men label makers. Almost as good as cordless drills. Within a couple of weeks there will be labels absolutely everywhere. ""Socks. Shorts. Cups. Saucers. Door. Lock. Sink."" You get the idea. No one knows why.

Rule #9:
Never buy a man anything that says ""some assembly required"" on the box. It will ruin his Special Day and he will always have parts left over.

Rule #10: 
Good places to shop for men include Northwest Iron Works, Parr Lumber, Home Depot, John Deere, Valley RV Center, and Les Schwab Tire. (NAPA Auto Parts and Sear's Clearance Centers are also excellent men's stores. It doesn't matter if he doesn't know what it is. ""From NAPA Auto, eh? Must be something I need. Hey! Isn't this a starter for a '68 Ford Fairlane? Wow! Thanks."")

Rule #11: 
Men enjoy danger. That's why they never cook - but they will barbecue. Get him a monster barbecue with a 100-pound propane tank. Tell him the gas line leaks. ""Oh the thrill! The challenge! Who wants a hamburger?""

Rule #12:
Tickets to a Red Wing/Lions/Pistons/Tigers game are a smart gift. However, he will not appreciate tickets to ""A Retrospective of 19th Century Quilts."" Everyone knows why.

Rule #13:
Men love chainsaws. Never, ever, buy a man you love a chainsaw. If you don't know why - please refer to Rule #8 and what happens when he gets a label maker.

Rule #14:
It's hard to beat a really good wheelbarrow or an aluminum extension ladder. Never buy a real man a step ladder. It must be an extension ladder. No one knows why.

Rule #15:
Rope. Men love rope. It takes us back to our cowboy origins, or at least The Boy Scouts. Nothing says love like a hundred feet of 3/8"" manila rope. No one knows why.

I only need two classes that are required, and two additional 300 Level or higher class this semester and i'm done.  I do have an interesting delima though, being that i am signed up for one more class then i need for the semester due to having to add a class i need to take for graduation.  That means that i can drop one class out of the 5 i'm enrolled in.  At the moment i'm leaning towards my only morning class, which is an 8am on tuesdays and thursdays.  But i'm going to have to check about a few things first.

In other news one of my roomates has offered to sale me his PS3 for $500.  Which is something i want, and it is slightly (very slightly) cheaper then it would be if i bought one from work.  He says he bought it because he wanted it, then he plugged it up, made sure it worked, and then decided that it really isn't worth having at the moment, so he is trying to sale it and get some of his money back.  There are two things keeping me buying it.  The major one being I don't have $500.  But if anyone else would be interested in buying it let me know."

"event","Dirge of Cerberus was a little of a let down.  I bought the game about a week ago, and have already beat it.  It was still a good game, and i would play it again.  But it was still dissappointing that it was only 14 hours.  But oh well.

Also had a really annoying moment in class tonight.  I am takeing a religous studies class, focusing on the old testement.  The teacher made all of the students do the usally introduction, the normal name, major, year, reason for takeing the class.  Well when i went, i said my name, major and reason for takeing the class.  And the teacher made a comment that i should have expected.  She said ""Well maybe you can learn more about your name sake.""  Meaning the profit Jeremiah, who i am unforntate enough to share a name with.  Well that comment kinda got me mad, but then i thought, that given the class i was in, it was understandable.  But then the guy sitting behind me made a comment that i almost killed him for (and i mean, i wanted to turn around and kill him).  The teacher had explained to the class (who wasn't paying attention, or she just assumed no one knew) that Jeremiah was an Old Testment Profit, then the guy sitting behind me said ""And a bullfrog.""  The other part that ticked me off is that one person in the class laughed.  WHAT THE FUCKING HELL!!!  I would have fucking killed him too.  I'm so fucking sick and goddamn tired of this shit, i'm honestly considering on telling people my name is Jerry, or Jeremy, even though i don't like those names, and they are not actually short for Jeremiah, they are their own names.  And besides i actually happen to like my first name i'm just tired of the dumbass people who think they're the first fucking ones to ever make those referance to me.  There i that rant is over, i feel a little better now.  I'll do another update later with some good news."

Just figured i'd inform all those who do not already know."

"event","Got up at 7:30ish to go to the dentist, what fun.  My dental hygentist is actually really nice, and has been my dental hygenist since i had teeth for her to clean, so when i go there she always asks me about how things are with family and she asked me about how Nadia and I were doing, the normal stuff.  Which in its own way is kinda annoying seeing how i can't answer with her hands in my mouth.  buy meh.  
The worsth part of the visit, which is going to be the worst part of any dental visit i have for the rest of my life, is when they did the x-ray of my jaw.  Last year while doing rutine x-rays the dentist discovered a growth on my jaw.  I went to the doctor who looked at it, and in the doctor's expert opion it is just a bone growth from where one of my wisedom teeth's root was wrapped around my jaw bone.  But every six months at they have to take an x-ray of the growth, which means i have to have this thing into my mouth to the start of my throat and hold it there until they can take an x-ray, they usally have to do this a couple of times before they get a good picture of the growth.  I always gag on the damn thing.  But on the up side the growth is not any bigger.
Met my mom at DQ in Appomatox for lunch.  Talked to her for a while, saddly, and i feel really bad about this, i had to leave shortly before my dad got off work so i could make it to class on time, and i was still late, so i didn't get to speak to him.  But on the up side my mom is going to take a test to be a ruaral mail carry.  My mom lost her job a few weeks ago due to the plant that she worked at shutting down.  So anyone who reads this say a prayer, thank good thoughts or whatever to help, I would apprecate it.  
My sister might be getting a job too at the walmart photo lab, include her too.

"event","Ever had one of those nights when you repeat the phrase What The Fuck alot.  Yeah my drive home from work last night was kinda like that.  First off on the road i normally take home they had closed off for some reason, which shouldn't have been a big deal, i would have just taken the next street over, but that was blocked off as well, so i had to go two streets over, which was fine because it is the street that i normally drive to work on.  But all the while i was wondering 'What the Fuck are they doing now those two streets.'
I pull on to the street and get behind this little red ecno-box that is going maybe 20 miles an hour when the speed limit is 35.  So as i'm following this guy i'm wondering outloud ""What the fuck is this guys malfunction.""  Then i hear this faunt squilling sound, and then i say ""What the Fuck is that.""  And start to think that i need to replace the belt on my car.  Mean while the trafic has died down in the other lane on Belvedire, and i go to place the guy in the ecno-box going 20mph.  It is at this point i discover not only what his malfunction is, but where the squilling is comeing from.  The drivers side front wheel of his car is tilted down kinda like this:  \   and in order to go street he has to turn the wheel all the way to one side.  So i hurry up and pass the guy thinking What the fuck did he do to that car.
The last what the fuck came when i turned on grace and the cyber cafe place had the street blocked off with a tent in the middle of the street.  So i cut down a side road and drove in the alley behind the cafe to get to the garage."

"event","one of the coolest things happend at work.  A man offered me a cigar, no that wasn't the cool thing, let me tell the intire story.  These two guys came into my department and asked me to show them where a perticular tool was.  So i took them to the tool isle.  When i was leaving one of the men asked if i would like a cigar (which i must admit is a really strange question to be asked my a complete stranger).  I politely as i could turned him down by saying 'No thank you, i don't smoke' which is the truth, and started walking away.  After i got a few steps the man told me ""I just had a little girl"".  Which explains why he offered me a cigar, and I congradulated him.  And he asked me again if i wanted one.  I explained to the man that i really don't smoke, and that i appreacate the offer, but he should give it to some one that would enjoy it."

Anyway I happened to meet a girl who is a friend of my room Alex, and she loves rabbits.  And she told me that the lion head is newer breed, created by mixing two breeds. she couldn't remember but according to wikapieda its a mix of the swiss fox and belgian dwarf (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rabbit_breeds#Lionhead)

"event","Just killing time bofore work at the moment.  Had an interesting dream last night about being at my parents and walking down the road in front of their house.  As i walked there was a white rabbit hopping down the road, so i decided to catch it.  How i caught it was i picked up a bucket and it was inside.  I don't remember it jumping into said bucket, or the bucket being there before i picked it up, i just bent down and picked up the bucket and the rabbit was inside of it.  Before i go on, the rabbit had soft white fur and gold eyes.  After i had the rabbit i was going to give it to nadia (who had moved in my dream and now was my neighbor) as i walked to my parents house the rabbit tried to escape so i put it back in the bucket, which now had a net inside of it, so i grabbed the net, but then the net turned into a plastic bag.  Then the rabbit still fought to get free so i blocked the opening of the plastic bag, but then thought that the rabbit would sufficate in the bag with out air, and wished i still had the net.  Os i opened the bag and the rabbit tried to get free, so i angled the open opening down so hopefully the rabbit could breath and not get out.  The rabbit didn't get out, but it did have it's face in the side of the bag, and it looked like it went to sleep, but i was worried about the thing so i tore a hole in the bag right at it's face to make sure it's a live. and then i woke up. I don't remember if the rabbit was alive or dead.

in other news.  Just because Nadia, Julie, and I could figured it out last night 

the lion from wuzzles is Bumblelion, bumble bee and lion mix

the hippo is Hoppopotamus half hippo and half rabbit."

"event","i had a really extremely weird sex dream last night, and figured i'd post it
 <lj-cut>

I'm a guest on this farm.  So I get put to work on the farm with a guy who's about my age, and an older man.  We go down to this barn.  And inside this barn is a female calf in a pin.  This calf is probably a yearling, if that (aka too young to breed).  The calf is white with brown spots.  And I get told that we're going to fertlize this calf.  The older man gose and holds the calfs head and the guy who's my age hands me a suringe filled with white fluid (bull seman) The suringe itself about 3 times larger the a normal suringe, which is about right for what it's being used for...i think.  But the spiecal thing about this surringe is the needle.  The needle is collapsable, think of a radio's antina, and i have to pull the needle out.  So I pull the needle out and move behind the calf and stick the needle into it's vagina, and push the plunger of the surringe down injecting most of the seman into this calf.  When I pull the surringe out and collaps the needle i notice there is about an 8th inch of seman left in it.  So i push the puncher and eject the rest of the fluid and it makes a loud pop.

After we're done with the calf the older man releases it into the field.  Then we walk over to the other end of the barn, and i'm told that we're going to be breeding another cow.  As i walk over their i see a full grown cow standing in the last stall.  This cow is the tipical white with black spots.  As i get closer to the cow i notice it's wareing a horse bridle (not something you'd put on a cow) and is tide to the floor, with enough slack so it can move it's head.  I look over at the young guy who's standing beside me and ask him about the surringe.  Then the older man, who's standing by a big door, says ""we're not going to use a surringe"" and with that he opens the door and a bull (with out horns) runs into the barn.  The young guy and i run out a door that is convenitly behind the cow.  The bull looks as though he's going after us, but turns toward the cow.  Then the bull starts to mount, and starts to make these low pinched growling sounds.  Then the guy looks at me and tells me to go make sure the bull can get into the cow, and if he can't i have to help him.  So i go over to the side of the two cows and look in between them and see the bulls penis go into the cows vagina.  I walk back over and say to the young man that the bull is fine.  So we stand their and watch the bull fuck the cow.  The bull continue to make the growling sound and the makes a similar sound.
If this wasn't weird enough, as some of you know.  I have never done any of the stuff in the dream.  I of course have seen two cows mate.  A local farmer keeps cows in his pasture that happens to be behind my parents house.  But the thing with the calf i have never done...i don't think.  I could have help my neighbor with his cows when i was younger, i'm fairly certain i miked one once.  Oh well. either way i just figured i'd share my dream with yall.  Hope you're as weirded out by it as i am.

"event","Did yall know i'm a scary person.  This happened a couple of weeks ago, kept forgetting to put it in lj.

I was walking back to my appartment after dropping nadia off at her dorm.  I'm walking down shafer wearing a white shirt that says ""DARE"" in brightly colored letters on the front, blue jeans, white sneakers, and my superman hat.  Just minding my my own business, aka in my own little world, when I notice foot steps behind me, i turn and look over my shoulder and there is a woman in her late twenties early thirdies walking about 10-15 feet behind me.  When i look at her, she looks at me with a look like that of scared rabbit.  I look back a head of me, and continue to mind my own business, she increases her speed and passes me.  When she's walking in front of me I notice that she is carrying her keys with the keys sticking out from between her fingers.  So I decide to slow down, and give her a wide burth.

Another story from my life.  Not that anyone really cares a great deal, but i feel like shareing.

Last spring, durning the semester.  I get out of one of my evening classes, I think it was one that lasted until 9:40pm.  And as i'm walking by the dinning hall this older lady who works there comes out and reconizes me from eating at the dinning hall.  She asked me if I'm heading towards Broad.  I say I am, because...well...I was.  And she asks me if it would be ok if she walked with me to broad.  I really didn't care one way or the other, so I said It was alright with me.  As we walk she said that she was afraid of walking alone at night, which i guess is understandable, even though i've walked on vcu campus at all hours (and i mean all hours, name a time of day or night and i've probably been out and about at it.  Most likely because i wanted to take a walk to clear my mind) and felt perfectly safe.  So i walk with her to broad st. so she could catch her bus.

And now that i think about it, there have been a couple of occasions when I noticed that a small group (2 or 3) of girls have seemed to be keeping pace with me when i've been walking across campus at night.  I would notice this when we all stopped at a stop light, and then the next one, and so forth.  I wonder could they have just been walking in the same direction as me and at a simalar speed or were they purposely keeping pace with me because they didn't feel safe, or something.  Though they could have been atracted by my shear presance and animal magnatism...nah...they didn't seem drunk.  Either way, the girls i remember were attractive, and looked like they had dressed to go to one of the clubs around campus (aka tight/simi-reviling clothing, which i wouldn't suggest any girl wear walking across any city at night).  There may have been others, but they don't stick out in my mind for some odd reason. So at least i got a good view at the stop lights when they caught up me.  Which is only fare after all."

"event","The story:  I get home from work, and there are two girls with one of the dorm's carts full of groceries.  As the girls were talking to the security guards (and i use the term loosely) and getting their groceries straight on the cart i slip in front of them slide my card like i've done a million times.  Anyway as i'm walking towards the doors that lead out to the the courtyard of the building, i look behind me and notice that the girls are starting to head towards the doors.  So i do pull the door open and hold it and wait for the girls.  One comes out pulling the cart and the other is a few seconds behind behind a guy.  As i'm waiting for the second girl i make a little small talk with her, ask her what floor she lives on (since she is walking away from one of the elevators), she says three, so i ask her why she dosen't use the elevator.  What i'm thinking is if i'm going to have to help these two carry the heavy cart up the stairs.  (something i've done before.  And it really is no big deal.) She says she's useing the other elevator. So i go up to my room, decide that i am hungry, and kinda wish i picked something up from work, then decide that subway works.  I go down pick up a sub, and walk back to my dorm.  Standing in front of the entrance talking to the other girl and someguy is the girl i held the door open for.  As i walk towards the door the girl i held the door open for said to me ""Thank You"".  To which i responded ""No Problem"" (my standard responce).  I continue walking and i stand right at the door and she states, ""I really mean it think you. People have watched me try and open the door.""  To which i state to her my true feelings about it ""It was no big deal"".  Her responce ""Most people here are rude"".  So, still not seeing the signifacance of holding the door open for someone, i say ""You're welcome...i guess"".  Then u swipe my card to unlock the front door and start to enter when i notice her two friends start towards the door.  So i held the door open for them too, it locks and it's a little bit of a pain to have to get your card out and swipe it just to unlock a freaking door.

The reason i put this in a journal entry is to ask. What is the big deal?  All i did was hold a door open for someone pushing their groceries, then made sure they didn't need any help getting them to their floor, then left.  I mean people have done that for me (at least i think they have. I can't think of an instance when someone did off the top of my head, but i'm fairly sure someone has)  It is a sad world out there when such a small insignifacant act is the high point of someones day."

"event","On sunday moring at like 1:30-2oclock or there abouts i left Julie's hotel room and walked to my appartment.  As i was walking down broad street, i begain to let my mind wonder, enjoying the night air, and watching the cars drive by.  As i was walking i noticed this human shaped object sitting on something against the wall with it's legs crossed in one of the building i was getting close to.  I looked on the window of the building and saw that it was some sort of art galery, so i'm thinking it is a statue or a manakin; because the lights are out, and it's like 2am on a saturday/sunday so no one should be in there.  As i start to pass the building the object uncrosses it's legs sets up on the couch it is sitting on and i see it's head turning and feel it's eyes on me, and i feel a shriver crawl up my spine.  
I believe in ghost, but i don't believe i calling every shadow or weird feeling a ghost.  And i think it was a ghost, but here are some other facts that shouldn't be over looked: first and most obvious is it is 2am, and i've been up since 8, with only 3 to 5 hours sleep for the past couple of days. There were no cars parked on the street in front of the building, but there were three cars parked in the alley beside the building, a white mini-van, and two dark colored fourdoor sadans all late modles so i couldn't tell you what kinda cars they were.  And there also looked to be a little lot behind the building.  But if it was someone in the building why are they sitting on a couch with in the dark.  If it were an employee they would have turned the lights on, and if it were a theif they wouldn't have just sat there, and even it they did it wouldn't have been where someone could see them.  And as for it being late, i had just eaten beef fried rice, half a shrimp role, and an egg role.  And when i did get back to my appartment i sat down and watched a little tv, before going to bed, so i wasn't that tired. So the only thing that makes any since to me is that it must have been a ghost.


DAMN...i just realized i wrote an argumentative essay with out meaning too.  Well i guess i learned something from college, besides what to mix rum with"

"event","THE FIRST TIME 
It's your first time. As you lie back your muscles tighten. You put him off for awhile searching for an excuse, but he refuses to be swayed as he approaches you. He asks if you're afraid and you shake your head bravely.

He has had more experience, but it's the first time his finger has found the right place. He probes deeply and you shiver; your body tenses; but he's gentle like he promised he'd be. He looks deeply within your eyes and tells you to trust him--he's done this many times before. 

His cool smile relaxes you and you open wider to give him more room for an ease entrance. You begin to plead and beg him to hurry, but he slowly takes his time, wanting to cause you as little pain as possible. 

As he presses closer, going deeper, you feel the tissue give way; pain surges throughout your body and you feel the slight trickle of blood as he continues. He looks at you concerned and asks you if it's too painful. Your eyes are filled with tears but you shake you head and nod for him to go on. 

He begins moving in and out with skill but you are now too numb to feel him within you. After a few frenzied moments, you feel something bursting within you and he pulls it out of you, you lay panting, glad to have it over. 

He looks at you and smiling warmly, tells you, with a chuckle; that you have been his most stubborn yet most rewarding experience.

You smile and thank your DENTIST. After all, it was your first time to have a tooth pulled.

Naughty, Naughty! What were you thinkin'? PERVERT! I know what you were thinking!"

Just for fun: <lj-cut text= The Guys' Rules>
1. Men ARE NOT mind readers. 

1. Learn to work the toilet seat. You're a big girl. If it's up, put it down. We need it up, you need it down. You don't hear us complaining about you leaving it down. 

1. Sunday sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be. 

1. Shopping is NOT a sport. And no, we are never going to think of it that way. 

1. Crying is blackmail. 

1. Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: Subtle hints do not work! Strong hints do not work! Obvious hints do not work! Just say it! 

1. Yes and No are perfectly Acceptable answers to almost every question. 

1. Come to us with a problem only If you want help solving it. That's what we do.

1. A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor. 

1. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. In fact, all comments become null and void after 7 Days. 

1. If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act like soap opera guys. 

1. If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us. 

1. If something we said can be interpreted two ways and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one. 

1. You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want it done. Not both. 
If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself. 

1. Whenever possible, Please say whatever you have to say during commercials. 

1. Christopher Columbus did NOT need directions and neither do we. 

1. ALL men see in only 16 colors, like Windows default settings. Peach, for example, is a fruit, not A color. Pumpkin is also a fruit. We have no idea what mauve is. 

1. If it itches, it will Be scratched. We do that. 

1. If we ask what is wrong and you say ""nothing,"" We will act like nothing's wrong. We know you are lying, but it is just not worth the hassle. 

1. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, Expect an answer you don't want to hear. 

1. When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear Is fine...Really. 

1. Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as baseball, the shotgun formation, or golf.

1. You have too many shoes. 

1. I am in shape. Round IS a shape! 

1. Thank you for reading this. Yes, I know, I have to sleep on the couch tonight;

<lj-cut text= The Female Rules>
1. The Female always makes THE RULES.

2. THE RULES are subject to change without notice.

4. If the Female suspects the Male knows all THE RULES, she must immediately change some of THE RULES.

13. The Male is expected to read the mind of the Female at all times.

14. At all times, what is important is what the Female meant, not what she said.

15. If the Male doesn't abide by THE RULES, it is because he can't take the heat, lacks backbone, and is a wimp.

"event","This is my Divenci Code Rant.  I'm actually sick of hearing armchair historians, and armchair biblical scholars say that the person to Jesus' right in the Divenci's last super is Mary Magnalin.  I took an art history class last semster and when the prof. was discusing Divenci, one of the students asked what the prof. thought about it.  And i'm sick of it.  The Divenci Code (while it may be a good story, haven't read it, but is planning on seeing the movie, my sources are the numerious history chanle specials, that all debunk it btw, and a few of my proffessors) is a FICTIONAL!!!! story based on a factual group that is made up.  The group that the book claims Divenci as one of it's members is true, BUT the group is from the mid twentith century (1940-1970)and is based on the dellustions of one man (and an over worked thirtteenth century monk) who thought he was the rightful king of france.

Did Jesus and Marry get married, to date there is no real way of knowing.  Personally i doubt it.  But dose it really matter, unless marriage is a sin...no.  (And to everyone out there yes i'm chirstain)

Just for the record Leanardo liked feminanin looking men.  The same way Micholanglo like exremly musicular men..as in SSJ 3 Goku or Mj. Armstrong may not have been musicular enough for Micholangilo to schlupted or paint them. (Please note i am not saying anything about their sexuallity, nor am i implying anything about it.  All i am saying is that is what they liked to paint) 

And as always, i am a terrible speller and it is 2:30 in the frecking morning, so over look the misspellings

There i feel better now"

"event","Ok last night (thursday) i walked nadia across campus at like midnight or so, and after she went into her building and i had turned around and had crossed main (on the side with 'the landmark') this black suv pick-up (fairly certain it was one of the new honda elements) came to the intersection, and stopped at a red light.  As he stopped a small group of girls begain to cross main.  Then on still with a red light he turned left (fyi main is a one way street and at this intersection you can only turn right) almost hitting the girls, but they got out of the way.  Then after the moron realized that he was facing the wrong direction, due to several cars coming his way, and people yelling at him, the moron did a quick three point turn in the middle of the road (this move was probably the smartest thing this idoit did, because there was where else to turn around until further down).  He came back to the same intersection, and turned on to the same street he had just turned off of, but going in the oposite direction.  

*side note:  i have once turned the wrong direction on a one way street on the long wood campus.  But i didn't almost hit a group of prodestrions to do it.  And i was far luckier then this person because i was able to quickly turn into a parking lot, so this kinda thing happens to those not familar to the area and/or at night, so i can understand the mistake.  But the fact remains he took a left on red, and almost hit a group of people to do it.*

Then as i was walking up broad another idoit was driving (the right direction luckily) with his lights off.  There were even people on the side walk and in parked cars yelling at this pertiuclar idiot telling him his lightes were off.  I watched him drive away he never turned on his lights.  

This has been further proof that the world is full of idoits, and they some how manage to find their way behind the wheel of motor vehicles."

Nadia and I each decided to keep one, i'll let her tell you about her's.  But I have named the nymph i kept Wrath.  Tell me if this is fitting, Wrath is klingy, and hyperative...remind anyone of a certain homuncious...  

I also picked up a new terrium (which i have decided to name 'The Gate' because i...well...am just a little crazy...why do you ask?) for Wrath and Sloth to share, they are divided by a plastic divider that i will remove when Wrath is big enough not to be eaten by Sloth.  

Nadia and i watched Wrath and a Cricket (Which i have named Dinner due to the fact that is exactly what it will be as soon as Sloth decides to get off her lazy tail and eat the damn thing because it is annoying the hell out of me) wonder around their new home.  It was actually kinda interesting.  Slot is...well...being herself just kinda hidding in her burrow in all her Slothfullness glory.

Oh and just so everyone knows at this point in time there is no way to tell if Wrath is male or female.  I will be taking Wrath to Fin and Feather to have Daniel(sp) (Spiderman to those of us who have bought archneids from Fin and Feather) sex it next spring when he should be mature enough to sex.  Yes i hope Wrath is a male, though if he is you might hear me refer to him as Rex or Oedipus (i'll leave that up to y'all to figure out why) but his name is 'Wrath', if i do call him Rex or Oedipus it will just be a nick name.  He will forever be Wrath."

"event","First off work yesterday i spent the whole day unloading a truck. Luckily for me there is another person in my department, but after i left they put her on it, so there stil was stuff that didn't get done.  But another guy who isn't so luck got yelled at today because he didn't get everything done, mean while he was unloading the trucks from about 3pm to 12midnight.  Anyway while i was trying to get caught up in my department, there was a kid rideing an electric motorcycle up one of the main isles as fast as it could go. So i run up to the kid and stop him.  For once i yell at the kid for doing it.  A couple of minuates later his father comes up to me and yells at me for yelling at his kid.  

This is what i thought...
They don't pay me enough to babysit either you or your kid

they don't pay me enough to deal with your dumb ass

Maybe if you dissaplened him more he wouldn't be riding it around the store like it's his own personal hight, putting my life and the life of everyone around him in danger... (yeah i know he was putting his own life in danger, but i really and truelly don't give a rat's ass, in fact i hope the kid dies because he was doing something stupid and his parents, perticularly his father, didn't do a damn thing to stop him. I just hope he dosen't take anyone with him, execpt maybe his dumb as father)...and maybe i wouldn't have to do it.

The manage we have don't give a fuck about the employees so if i tell him 
that he's going to request to speak to a manager and then i'll probably get fired.  I hate this job, but i need the paycheck.

This can't go to management

What was said...
You're right sir i'm wrong
*Him spooting more stupidly like a chimp who just got his bannana back*
You're right sir 

What i thought at this point...
Get the fuck away from me so i can get back to work you dumb ass mother fucker... and i hope you and your two sons (yes there were two of them) die and prove darwin right

then he left
 *insert pervious post here to find out what happened on the way home*

Then this happens as i'm trying to get some sleep
a bunch of young people, from what i could tell mostly black males (please not this is my observation, i am not trying to sterotype), started walking down the middle of the lanes that go to mcv, while a bunch of more people, again from what i could see mostly black males, chanting 'fuck the police' from the sidewalk.  Then the police came and the same group that walked down the middle of the street came back up the sidewalk and i think the police arrested a bunch of them.  (saw the police van speed down the street with it's lights on, assuming the police van is used to carry a lot of prisoners) there were people outside my window for a while, but i think it's over now (yes it is still going on as i write this. so it might have just moved away from my window.  

Well that kinda ruins my plans for going to sleep early.  

So how was everyone elses day??

<lj-cut> 
Sunday was a real shitty day at work.  Someone had tracked something on the main isle between the electronics and soft lines departments with their shoes.  What was thought to be dirt and mud was in fact shit, green stinky shit!  After calling maintainence they tried to sprinkle quick dry powder on the shit but by the time they actually arrived the shit had gotten hard and caked to the floor.  This shit was getting harder and harder to fuck with for the poor maintainence dude. 

Leaving and shortly returning with a mop and bucket he was able to mop up the shit and clean the floor properly.  The area's smell had all but disappeared when I was called to get a game for someone down the game isle.  After retrieving the game for the customer the smell of shit was in the air yet again.  The shit had really hit the fan now as the shit had made it's way to the game isle. 

It was soon discovered that the source of the shit was coming from a ~7 year old kid and that he was standing there by his dad while his dad was playing one of the PS2 displays???!  Uh, hello?!  Earth to parent, go clean your kid, he smells of shit and yet you stand there acting oblivious to the fact that this bastard pig-pin is funking up the whole electronics area?  I wish I could have somehow picked up a piece of the li'l shit's poo and thrown it at the father for acting like a total and complete dumb fuck! 

Needless to say maintainence cleaned up the electronics isle too and when the two shitheads left the department he made sure to clean the contaminated area to the keep nose pinched PS2 fanboys happy and stench free. 

It's bad enough that we as associates have to deal with customer's shit on a day to day bases but it's a totally different turd when you have to deal with real shit from customers who can't decide whether they want to make the effort or not to walk their sorry asses to the nearest restroom to do their paperwork. <lj-cut>"

"event","Well it's been 29 years since Consumer's Reports reviewed girlfriends (CR, Aug 1972). Since then, styles have changed, new features have been introduced, and the market for girlfriends has changed substantially. So we here at CU decided another report was needed.

As in a car or a computer, you should ask yourself what you need a girlfriend for before obtaining one. This will, in large part, dictate the final product which you should consider. Do you want an intellectual companion? A baby factory? A hiking partner? Or just lots of good, old-fashioned sex? Identifying your needs is the first, and most important, step in selecting a girl- friend.

The second question which needs to be addressed is, of course, how much you are able to spend. This is largely determined by your physical and personal characteristics--if you are good looking, have a commanding personality and a good sense of humor, you will have the resources to obtain a fancy, high-end model. On the other hand, if you are ugly, smell bad, and wear polyester clothes, your choices are more limited. Keep your purchasing power in mind when considering your selection. Although the salesman will tell you that a girlfriend can be financed, CU does not recommend this practice; due to inflating expectations, the required monetary outlay will actually *increase* with time.

Used vs. New?

A question many girlfriend seekers have to address is whether to get a new
or a used girlfriend. The answer to this question will, roughly speaking, be
determined by your age, as shown in the following table:

Your age Used or New

1 - 12 Years (See note A)
13 - 16 Years New
17 - 21 Years Used, but not used up
22 - 35 Years Used, heavily
36 - 60 Years New, (See note B)
60 (See note A)

A. Seek psychiatric help
B. Only ""new"" if income < $100,000/year. Otherwise, ""divorced"".

New girlfriends have the advantage that they have no previous bad
experiences to project on you, but the disadvantage that they will rarely be
old enough to open their own checking account. Used girlfriends, on the
other hand, may be steady, reliable performers, with the initial problems
worked out, but CU advises that you avoid models which have much more than
average mileage (2.1 SO's / yr). Much greater than the average may be an
indication that the girlfriend was a professional.

Accessories

Often the potential girlfriends you see on the lot or in a tavern will be
loaded with accessories, as the dealer gets a high markup on such items as
large bosom, long legs, green eyes, etc. Other accessories will only appeal
to fringe markets, such as models which come pre-equipped with children, or
the ability run 10 miles while chanting sanskrit. In such cases you should
make a list of accessories desired, tolerated, and disliked. Note that some
accessories (such as children) can be added later, while others (such as a
large bosom) must be factory installed.

The Test Ride

When evaluating a girlfriend, a test ride is essential. The test ride ritual
begins with the so-called ""pickup line"", which can range from the simple if
dull (""Can I buy you a drink?"") to the aggressively hip (""dance with me or
I'll kill you"") to the arcane (""You're my Camus comrade, and I want to leap
you, Faith!""). CU rates as Not Acceptable ""Smile, you'll look better."" Once
on the test bed, evaluate handling, stability, and acceleration. The two
questions you want to answer are: how fast, and how far? Examine the
detailing. Does the bosom sag? Does the heater warm adequately, or does she
remain cool?

Ordering vs. On The Lot

Finding the right girlfriend can be a frustrating experience, and many
potential customers find it hard to get the exact model and accessories
wanted. In such cases ordering from the factory is an option. Delivery time,
however, is from 14 to 16 years (depending on the state you live in), and CU
questions the usefulness of such a practice: if you have access to the baby
factory, you should reconsider your need for a girlfriend anyway.

Methodology

Girlfriends were evaluated by a dedicated group of 10 test engineers,
selected to typify the average seeking population. All tests were performed
at CU's specially constructed test facility, which included a bedroom,
kitchen, and living room, and at a number of bars and taverns surrounding
the facility. A series of seven tests were run, evaluating each product
according to the following criterion: intelligence, wit, humor, empathy,
initiative, looks, and performance.

Results

Girlfriends are grouped together in categories by similarity. Within each
category, variation is not statistically significant.

- Goddess: This is the woman of your dreams. She comes equipped with all the
options you want and none of the ones you don't. She can argue subtle points
of philosophy, give you a stiff game of racquetball, understand what you
mean even if you don't say it, and break a bed. No mental or physical
hang-ups. The drawback is that this model is not actually available.

- Goddess-in-law: This model is similar to the goddess, but comes with
contractual retainers, such as a psychotic ex-husband, a spiteful mother, an
alcoholic father, and a bratty kid. This model tends to generate grey hairs.

- Ms. Right: The best all-around choice for most girlfriend situations. Has
most of the characteristics of the Goddess except possibly in the wrong size
or hair color. Other than that, an excellent long-term investment.
Availability is extremely limited but can occasionally be found with luck.

- Babe: This is the flashy, fully-loaded variety with all the options.
Unfortunately this model lacks cognitive powers and empathy. Showy, and
suitable for a parade or for impressing your friends, but not for your
long-term girlfriend needs.

- Friend: The model with the most empathy. Caring and kind but you wouldn't be
caught dead in it. Availability is poor to fair, depending on quality.

- Yeah, Her: The Ford Escort of girlfriends. Widely available, but useful as a
girlfriend only in a pinch, if no others are available. Tends to be spiteful
or unreliable, or have a dull finish.

Until you find her, we at CU wish you Happy Hunting!

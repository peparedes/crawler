"event","Yeah, I decided that my non-slash fiction is going to be posted here because I don't feel like posting it on ff.net...simply because ff.net SUCKS. ::glares::

ANYWAYS, Life I never had isn't updated for real...but prologue is going up because I can't always access this stupid freakin file ::sob::

***********************************

Life I Never Had - Prologue

It was a beautiful day. The birds were chirping, the--""AAAAAHHHHHH!!!!""-- windows were rattling...

Number 4 Privet drive hadn't seen such anger since 1997, not since Harry Potter moved out for good.

...not that he wasn't still blamed for everything.

Maybe I should give you a general idea of what's happened up to this point.

Harry Potter was born. His parents were killed and he temporarily beat Voldemort when he was one by sitting there and looking cute. He was sent to live with the Dursleys and they put him in a cupboard for the first 11 years of his life. Then he went to Hogwarts - a wizard school. Six years into school, Voldemort was defeated by Harry, Professor Severus Snape, and Draco Malfoy. After he graduated the following year, he moved to America and got his teaching lisence. He now lives in Florida with his godfather Sirius Black, Jillian Black, and their 3 kids.

...with me so far...? ^ ^;; Good.

Now he works at a Muggle high school teaching band, of all things.

HOWEVER, this commotion has to do with Dudley Dursley and his daughter Lilith.

Now, it's a known fact that all the Dursleys have blonde hair and blue eyes. What nobody knows is that they have magical relatives with somewhat darker features. Dudley Dursle married a tall, slender, blonde woman much like his mother Petunia, and they had a child. Unfortunately, his wife Gabrielle died in childbirth leaving him to raise their daughter on his own. What was strange about the girl, however, was that she had deep red hair and emerald eyes. Very un-Dursley like. Dudley got a bit frightened at his daughter's appearance, but the years passed by and nothing strange occurred, so he relaxed a bit.

But today...today was a special day. It's about 7am, Dudley just woke up to take his morning shower.

The shriek comes in just about....""AAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!"" ...there. Lilith poked her head out of the door of her room. ""Daddy?"" She pattered over to the bathroom where he was staring at the tub. She blinked. ""Is that...pudding, daddy? I think it is!!!"" She ran past him and dipped her finger into the goo now filling the enormous bathtub. She licked her finger and grinned. ""Daddy it's vanilla!!!!! Just like my dream! There was a whole- -"" As Lilith rambled on about her dream, Dudley's head was spinning. Now there was the question of whether or not his only daughter was a witch. Or rather, he wanted it to be a question. He pinched himself several times to try and wake up, but it was useless. ""Lilith, the tub needs to be cleaned, you know that right?"" She nodded. With a sigh, she walked back to her room and the pudding disappeared. Dudley blinked. /What the HELL am I going to do?!/

End Prologue ^__^

Yeah, my day has gotten marginally better since this morning (see my <a href=""http://www.deadjournal.com/~birodo_namida"">dj</a>) but my stupid layouts still won't work. Still working on that.....

Still can't believe that school starts in a WEEK. That's kinda...sad.

"event","Ok I was convincing Dean to get a live journal or a dead journal, and my sister cow was talking about writing stuff that people want to read and yet don't wanna read, and she was like ""Write something like...'My mom walked in on me while I was jacking off in the living room...'"" and then told us that this happened to her friend David...LOL!! This is why you don't do things like that in the living room...or while your parents are home!!!! Thought you might enjoy that!"

"event","#1 dont preach about how you hate sluts when you are one yourself
#2 stop begging people to comment, look at your pictures on myspace or livejournal. is your self esteem that low?
#3 stop guilt tripping people into feeling sorry for shit thats out of your/thier hands
#4 stop crying about not being with someone, enjoy life, she/he will come along soon
#5 dont feel sorry for yourself, you are a disappointment to humanity
#6 instead of listing what you dont have, think and focus on the things that you do have

""If me and Auden cant be here together, i dont want to be here at all. Im so stupid, how could i have let her find out about me and Auden. I cant just sit here and let him be taken away from me. Right now, im staring a bottle of oxycotton and a bottle of JD. These pain killers dont work well anymore. I want to be with Auden for ever, no matter what the sutiation is. I cant do that if his dad is taking him to London. I sould just end it now. I know doing this is going to hurt alot of people, but id rather hurt them, then live a life in pain. My parents need me too. They need to know how much ive grown up. Seventeen years is long enough. Im glad Auden is going to do this with me. We need to be together. We're ment for each other. No one will ever understand us but each other. This was ment to be."""

"event","I so did not expect the entire WoW phenomenon to take me as it has.  The next level, the newest piece of armor, the next quest finished and a hearty cheer for your efforts...all of these things caught me.  I tried to moderate my game time...I did my best to balance my WoW life and my life in CoH.  Nevertheless, I was incapable of letting go, of sharing my game time, in lieu of any other hobbies which once might have taken my interest.

These days, while I still spend an inordinate amount of time in my ""other life"", I have meatier subjects to attend to.  A new life is on the way.  My daughter is having a baby and I couldn't be happier.  It feels strange to say that, after years of fearing to hear those words, and the welcome sound of them as she tenatively mentioned that she was late.  And that she'd taken a test.  And that it was positive.  I can't describe the joy that comes from hearing that from your daughter, when she is happy in love and ready for the challenges and comforts of motherhood.

Boy, was THAT cheesy - and yet, it's very much how I feel.  I am overjoyed.  I need some help with my crochet skills - lost to time as they are.  It's time to break out the yarn and the needle and get busy.  Babies come as they will and time flies as fast as the wind in March. 

45, the flu, grandmotherhood and an impending wedding or two - nah, not much going on.  And now, it's bedtime for this not so mysterious rune. Stand by for further transmissi...."

"event","Seriously people - this isn't a blog, this is an excuse for self-indulgence of the highest form.  Still, it's been fun to get real with my emotions and to write again.  I quit in '94, feeling incompetent, feeling depressed, feeling as though I had nothing to say...cowed by the talents of others. 

So, putting a journal online - opening myself to others, taking the risk of telling the truth - well, it's like being seventeen again, when I believed I really should write.  My poetry stinks, my prose is overly dramatic and stilted and the only thing that feels ""right"" to me is this train-of-thought, useless and self-centered discourse.

I've just come back from a journey through the darkness again - where stress and fear once again got the better of me.  Being Bi-Polar is not an easy road, and as our (ick) Commander in Chief (ow, even writing THAT hurts my brain) has said, ""It's hard.""  But eventually the dark times pass, you can see the sunshine again and hear the leaves dance in the wind.  I'm finally there again.  July is a LONG time ago, and it took this long for the meds to get me back on track.

I've had plenty of time to brood.  I've had plenty of time to weep.  I've had more than enough time to pick every wound until it bled. 

My once and future boyfriend (ok, I stole that from T. H. White, though I expect you know that) asks, how can you let yourself think that way?  More than once I've looked at HIM as if he were nutz and said, ""Do you think I LIKE this?"" Arghhhh.  Sometimes, even those that love us cannot understand.  And love me he does - the comfirmed bachelor has asked me to marry him.  Hmmm, we'll see.

And still, the stress hasn't gone away, although the summertime boyfriend did.  (A distinctly Good Thing) My job remains, a little less frantic perhaps, but still a challenge.  And my friends?  Bless 'em all, they have held me tight until my broken spirit could integrate itself once more.  

MEANWHILE, I have a dear friend that I've never met coming to visit next week!  We've talked on the phone, we've been teammates in City of Heroes for over a year and a half and now I finally get to meet one of the sweetest guys I've ever ""met"".   ;-D

More on this after we get together next week..."

This song...

Good God...

Shawn, sing again, please?

POLAROIDS - S. Colvin 

Please no more therapy
Mother take care of me
Piece me together with a 
Needle and thread
Wrap me in eiderdown
Lace from your wedding gown
Fold me and lay me down
On your bed
Or liken me to a shoe
Blackened and spit-shined through
Kicking back home to you
Smiling back home
Singing back home to you
Laughing back home to you
Dragging back home to you


I was so wary then
The ugly American
Thinner than oxygen
Tough as a whore
I said you can lie to me
I own what's inside of me
And nothing surprises me anymore
But forests in Germany
Kids in the Tuileries
Broken-down fortresses
In old Italy
And claiming his victory
Shrouded in mystery
He went running away with me


Back in our home New York
Walking these streets forlorn
We all in our uniforms
Black and black
Doing that slouch and jive
The artist must survive
We've got all we need we cried
And we don't look back
Thinking we had it made
Poised for the hit parade
Knee deep in accolades
The conceptual pair
But ever the malcontent
He left without incident
Vanished into thin air


Now I am always amazed
Words can fill up a page
Pages fill up the days
Between him and me
But the vows that we never keep
From bedrooms to business-speak
Make me remember how cheap
Words can be
And the letters I wrote you of
Were those of the desperate stuff
Like begging for love in a suicide threat
But I am too young to die
Too old for a lullaby
Too tired for life on the ledge


But I had a dream last night
Of lovers who walked the plank
Out on the edge of time
Amidst ridicule
They laughed as they rocked and reeled
Over the mining fields
Coming to rest on this ship of fools
But he just took polaroids
Of her smile in the light
Of the dawn of the menacing sky
And before they went overbaord
She turned and held up a card
And it said Valentine"

"event","THE LAST TIME I SAW RICHARD

The last time I saw Richard was Detroit in '68,
And he told me all romantics meet the same fate someday
Cynical and drunk and boring someone in some dark cafe
You laugh, he said you think you're immune, go look at your eyes
They're full of moon
You like roses and kisses and pretty men to tell you
All those pretty lies, pretty lies
When you gonna realise they're only pretty lies
Only pretty lies, just pretty lies

He put a quarter in the Wurlitzer, and he pushed
Three buttons and the thing began to whirr
And a bar maid came by in fishnet stockings and a bow tie
And she said ""Drink up now it's gettin' on time to close.""
""Richard, you haven't really changed,"" I said
It's just that now you're romanticizing some pain that's in your head
You got tombs in your eyes, but the songs
You punched are dreaming
Listen, they sing of love so sweet, love so sweet
When you gonna get yourself back on your feet?
Oh and love can be so sweet, love so sweet

Richard got married to a figure skater
And he bought her a dishwasher and a Coffee percolator
And he drinks at home now most nights with the TV on
And all the house lights left up bright
I'm gonna blow this damn candle out
I don't want Nobody comin' over to my table
I got nothing to talk to anybody about
All good dreamers pass this way some day
Hidin' behind bottles in dark cafes
Dark cafes
Only a dark cocoon before I get my gorgeous wings
And fly away
Only a phase, these dark cafe days

Like...Alan is one of the coolest people I know, and I wish he knew Jesse...and I should have moved to Seattle years ago.  But then again, I wouldn't have been ready, eh?  Isn't that how it goes?

Ahhhh, looks like you are all in for another rambling, train of thought, blather filled entry.  God bless any of you with the patience to read!! LOL.

I learned another lesson this summer.  I learned YET again that multiple lovers at the same time just won't work for me. Taint natchural! ;-> For me, that is...And how I wish that weren't true. It's just that I'm not strong enough to believe in myself...sad, really.  I grew up reading AND believing in Heinlein, probably way too young, but it still spoke to me. It felt like truth. Like it SHOULD be possible.

I feel so much love for so many people - I can't name you all or you'd all KNOW, eh?  But either way...I have so many ""true loves"". Dare I make a list?  What if one of you is accidentally left out? Oh, hell, how many of you are actually ever going to see this. I (as per usual) give myself too much credit.

John,
Howard,
John David,
Brian, (Chris these days)
Jimmy,
Mark F., 
Amy Jo,
Diane,
Andy, oh Andy...my first broken heart...I think my parents thought I'd expire just from the longing.
Lauren.  She knows.  No comment.
Cameron. She doesn't know.  She should.
Jimmy the Black Irish prom date.  

Now come ON...look at this list!  This is simply school-age loves.  I can't even begin to talk abt college and beyond...ok, that's a lie.  But I *do* become a bit more discriminating after college...well, after marriage...well, damnit, don't ask if you don't want to know! ;->

Gina,
Thom,
Lori,
Stephen,
Carole,
Julie,
Anne Butler Rice - I'm sorry Annie, but I couldn't resist - it is SUCH a patrician name!!  

Oh, and in case anyone should wonder, I miss being a punker, I miss it like a left foot. I miss it like a part of me has been carved out for research.  Punk and NW (ewwwww) gave my life meaning during this period. 

And NOW, Ladies and Gentlemen, the piece de resistance?  Monsieur Earnest Roman Fedewa, Jr.

What a wonderful father, provider, gentleman.  As REM says, ""Not everyone can bear the weight of the world.""  To me, that's what a father does.  That's what Ernie did. I could not have wished for a better man to share the carnival of childrearing.  I hold immense respect for this man. May the rest of his days be spent in moments of JOY.

OK, if I go beyond this, I will have surely fried a few brains.  And while I appreciate brains, I'm not very interested in Fried Brains.  ;->

Thanks for caring...leave a note, eh?

And I've talked to Thom, (who thought I was DEAD!) That was a weirdness I'd rather not experience again real soon! But perhaps oddest of all, tomorrow I will see the young man who convinced me to see Star Wars. I mean - I wasn't even going to SEE it. I thought it stupid - a guy thing - and because I loved Trek, a poseur at best.  But Steve with his antics and his sincere appreciation for the message of the movie wrapped up in the best eye candy we'd ever seen...well, his argument was too hard to ignore.  I saw it. It changed and influenced my life in subtle ways ever since.

Twenty-eight years since I've seen Rev. S. C. ;->  But tomorrow, it will come full circle.  Our meetings parenthesize the first and the last of the Star Wars feature films. And there is much I have to thank him for.  What a ride it has been being a fan and who knows, maybe i'm as geeky as I am thanks to George Lucas. But I rather think I'm as geeky as I am because I once met a teenage boy who believed in the fun, the message, the honest to goodness treat that Star Wars: A New Hope was that first summer. Enough. Anyway, what fun, eh?  I get to see Steve tomorrow. Groooovy. Yay!  :^)

Plus now, well...for now...there's Michael. I wish I knew more than that - I wish I was clear about where we are going, but I'm just not. Such is the nature of things. Still ""All shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner of thing shall be well."" St. Julian of Norwich. So, I enjoy each day as it unfolds and now I am, ironically, listening to Doris Day in the background...

And Rome. Well, I'm hoping for a visit with him real soon. 

I stayed up until 4 the other night acquiring album art for my iTunes collection. And I'm working on a City of Heroes fansite. And I feel like a positive charge is in the air. Everything is electric and everything in sync with the natural rhythm of things. Hmmm. Nice."

"event","What happens in single womens brains?  Why do I check out the ring finger of every man or androgynous woman that walks in the store?  

Is it a need for validation?  Could it be that nester instinct?  Maybe it's just that girls have been taught to keep one eye open for Prince Charming (aka, MKISA: my knight in shining armor) since we were first rudely jettisoned into the world around us.  

Ahhh, don't buy it. It has two probable causes.  One:  That icky and yet understandable ""Creeping Co-dependancy"" problem I seem to feed on a fairly regular basis, or alternatively and which I would much prefer...nay, rather it were...Two:...could it be that starry-eyed and most venerable of characterisics ""Imagination""?

Well sure and begora, it could!!

Each new contact a possiblity - each new conversation an opportunity - each new assumption a necessary leap into the abyss or into a new stratosphere, how can one know without imagining an outcome?

Each ponytail a question:  Is that a stand against conformity and the man?  Are you too busy in your life to care about your hair?  Are you lost in a different zeitgeist - forever parroting the same old lines? 

The ringless men: What happens if I mention the ""G"" word?  Will they smile and nod? Scowl and shut down?  Try to make me their cause celebre?  Are they looking for home and freedom and gratitude and joy and learning and living up to what THEY believe is right? Do they care for those around them - sometimes giving more than they recieve, and yet always noticing when they are blessed beyond measure? Or have they given that up because they are lost in the accumulation of image?

The shy ones:  Will they laugh when I joke with them?  Will they respond to a self-depreciating comment?  How do they see themselves in the world - are they sure they exist? Will they show you?

So, what DOES happen in the single womans brain...in a store, in a mall, as a clerk, who is single?

You imagine lifetimes.
You imagine habits.
You imagine interests.
You imagine power structures
You imagine their response to your children
You imagine how forceful they may be with their opinions
You imagine what kind of work they do
You imagine what kind of team you would make
You...
Well,
You imagine!
(at least, I do...)

On another note:  I'm pleased to report that I was born in the Year of the Black Water Metal Rat, according to Chinese Horoscopes, that is! Expect to hear more from the Rat soon...

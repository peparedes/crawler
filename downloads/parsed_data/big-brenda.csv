 You know when you get on a bus?  There is always a bus driver that like opens the door for you.  But who opens the door for him?!  Okay so I was thinking for a long time about this and I think I've figured it out.  There are like people the bus driver lets on to sleep at night.  Then the bus sleeper on people let the bus driver on the the norning!  Now the bus driver can get you and smile at you and drive you to somewhere fun!

Update2: Lol, I'm so silly.  They can just let the bus driver on, and THEN install the door!!

Update3: Omg."

 A couple of friends and I are thinking of going to Florida for Thanksgiving.  But I'm sort of afraid of getting like Key Lime Disease.  I heard it bites you and leaves a really big red rash and then it like goes to your brain and does what rashes do there, lol.  So I dunno if it's safe. =(

 So, like we went to this totally trippin totally kewl party. (Did you like my ""awesome alliteration""?  I learned that in English!)  Anyways, getting to the party was like, hard.  We had to ride like this bus right?  Omg, when I got on, there was literally like a million people on the bus.  For real right?  And there was this one girl that said she was claustrophobic.  I mean like omg, she's scared of Santa Claus?  That is so middle school.

Update: Omgawd I am so silly.  No wonder she is claustrophobic.  The bus was like red and white.  Right?  Like christmas colors.  You know sometimes I think I'm not as smart as I think I am.  Wait, that confuzed me, lol.

 I hate guys so much.  Like, all they care about is my body.  I mean, like, I am not a piece of meat.  I am a WOman.  Okay?  You can't spell man without WOman.  So like all the guys who think they can get some from me can just go fuck themselves.

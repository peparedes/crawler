"event","hey. nothing happened today except the fact that my parents are leaving tomarrow on their cruise. but then when i got home i was supposed to take out the trash. well there was a huge cardboard box on the trash can, and i didnt feel like moving it. so i decided to put the trash in their anyway. well the bed fell of the wall (those like ends that are metal on beds) then the bed thing knocked these boards ontop of me and then i was stuck holding trash, the bed, and like 20 boards. so to end a long story it was really hard to get them back up and now i have like no skin left on my shins from those gay ass boards. so not good day at home but my parents are leaving tomarrow so yea!!!!! well nothing else happened and i am going to saturday school tomarrow with zac cuz i m a good friend so :(  -brit"

"event","if you really think about it at one time in everyones life they feel alone, desperate, dark. it's what they do that make them who they are. the song ""welcome to my life"" is an ode to every teenagers life. it talks of being alone and no body being there for you. at one time in every teenagers life they feel like that and to some it is everyday. everyone feels as if they have to put a mask on everyday to hide who they really are. everyone has that one secret that they fear people knowing, for fear of embarrasment. but what i ask you is why? why does everyone feel so alone when we have people everywhere around us? why do we have to put on that mask? are we really scared for other people to see us or are we scared to see ourselfs? every answer to the questions i ask are a matter of opinion, but i will answer them in my opinion. first of all at our age no one has found their soul mate, and if you have your damn lucky but its like everyone wants that one person which they will spend the rest of their life with. and i believe that no one will be completely happy with the people around them until they find them, to my next question those people who feel they must hide are scared of their true selfs in my opinion. i am also a victim of my question, for i feel as if i must put a mask on when i walk out of my room every morning. not even i know the real me. but i am sure of this, i aint some wise crack random weird person that i have been called and which makes my friends love me. oh no i am quite the opposite. but i wont let you in on who i am until i figure out who i am my self. but for now i tell you, if you want to wear the mask and deny who you are then do it. its what mask you wear and what you hide with the mask that defines who you are as a person..........."

( i dont think dustin will like that too much, lol) Dustin has been getting a tid bit jealous of allen but allens my freakin best friend so he can get over it. well i gtg i am about to go to LAS PALAPAS with the neighbors. peace-brit"

(bitch) and some other minor stuff. so yea. well tomarrow is school :( . well i dont have health anymore. damn recordkeeping is going to be so much fun. not.............well at least sarah will be in there for the first few days. well i ve been watching buffy since 8 this morning. its like my escape. so would u excuse me to continue my buffy marathon cuz i m home alone (no muchkins) and its GREAT!!!  bye -brit"

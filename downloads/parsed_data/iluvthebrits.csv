He also gave me a flyer for his next performance for tonight. I can't go. I have to be 21 or older to get into the club. BUMMER!!! I'm going to find out where I can get a fake ID. JUST KIDDING!!!!!! Anyway, I listened to his cd. Really good stuff!!!!! I wish I was 21 with a car and was able to go and check him out in L.A. He is a hottie!</FONT></P>"

"event","<FONT color=#6633ff>So yeah, now I'm officially known as the ""porn chick."" Well, this started like 2 weeks ago. It was my friend's birthday. I decided that it would be fun if I bought my friend a porn video. Well, yeah it was my first time buying a porn video, so yeah....I felt kinda weird. I went to go pay for it. Some guy I like works there so yeah I was really hoping that he wouldn't see me. Anyway, well it was taking forever because I get a discount for working at the mall. She didn't have functions to do that, so she had to get her supervisor. We waited a while. The video was just sitting on the counter. I wished that at least she would put it in the bag or something, but no. I was just there, still hoping the she would put it away so that no embarassing thing would happen. Then out of nowhere, Sean (the guy that I have a crush on) was like ""Hey!"" I said hi. OMG! He looked at it. I told him that it wasn't what he thinks it is. He was just like ""I'm sure it's not"" OMG I WANTED TO DIE RIGHT THEN AND THERE. I saw him later on that day and he asked me what was up with the video. I told him why I was getting it. He understood. I was still embarrassed though. So yeah, I bummped into that same cashier yesterday. She called me the ""porn chick."" We just&nbsp;laughed about it though. </FONT>"

"event","<P><FONT color=#009900>I went to church with Gaby today. It was so funny. The pastor said something like ""You know you are getting old when your dream car is a mini van."" LOL! Anyway, I consider myself a tolerant, accepting and a giving person, but some of the things that were said at church today upset me. Basically, the guy said that being a ""worldly"" person is bad and learning about other things in the world is bad because ""you are forgetting the lord."" I just think that people should be tolerant of others and their surroundings, good or bad. I just don't think that someone should shut other people out just because of what they like or what they decide to do. Then again, I'm not of that religion. I just disaggree with what was said.</FONT></P>

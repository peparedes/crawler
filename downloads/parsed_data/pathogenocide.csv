the grey unit sitting on the upper tier is a <a href=""http://www.korg.com/microsampler"">Korg Microsampler</a>. totally fucking REVOLUTIONARY. it's really making live vision of the project possible in the sense that i'm going to be able to recreate everything live with studio accuracy without having to haul an entire arsenal of analog synths and samplers out with us. i've really developed a love for this unit over the past few months. hopefully i'll be able to get one for my own projects soon. .it really is the most genius thing ever designed in a practical sense: software editing, 8 banks spread out across 3 octaves, decent FX. .just the perfect fucking solution to minimize all the hassles and compromises of performing deeply layered electronic music live if one is patient enough to program it. .

i know that from my true audiophile standpoint, it's obviously nugacious to digitally sample analog synths, as you'll lose the true grit created by oscillators drifting out of tune and the other voltage specific errors that make analog the beautiful medium that it is, but it's also a lot better than dealing with a bunch of heavy, delicate, irreplaceable shit on stage that is just going to cost setup time, overwhelm the player, and probably lead to a shitty show. i really need to train someone to do live keys for black.eyed.beauty again and i know most people aren't dedicated enough to learn how to do things like switch patches between songs and not fuck up and what not. trying to make things as idiot-proof as possible."

i've been bleeding out an unusual amount of vitriol lately, which is a central organ in my being that is very alive but rarely exposed for others. i'm not positive upon clearly determining the culprit of my sudden posture - normally i can swallow a megaton of shit as my ego is routinely bludgeoned to death, but lately i've been acting upon some vague defense mechanism that i cannot clearly specify. most of this has been bled out in small doses and minute spasms, but my developing attitude scolds that i still need to breathe once in awhile. however, agitation seems to have an uncanny death grip on my skull.

most of these instances are hardly worth reporting, but in one small example, i was instructed to help the lighting crew rid this office at work of an ancient metal tanker desk that would not, despite any angle attempted, fit out the door. of course the other guys were succumbing to a throng of brute force tactics to ram it out the door, ignoring my eyeball criticisms deeming these maneuvers would be futile, and dismissing me as a 'faggot' for speculation. so i disappeared up the stairs for a minute, only to return with an extension cord, goggles, and a sawzall. without a murmur i armed the device and applied the reciprocating blade to the metal, yielding a frenzied discord that quickly refracted into this beautifully virulent sonus in the small enclosure. heated filaments of timeworn alloy illuminated the space, amalgamated by a vehement montage of severed fingers and staff infections manifesting in a plume of abraded rust. moments later i pried the teeth from the jagged fissure, steeltoed the divorced bisections over and walked out of the room in satiety, leaving the scraps for the dogs. 'faggots'.

but i tire of reporting to felonious apes and learning to adapt to their primitive [and very unclean] gestures. i understand that this climate of exaggerated virility is not localized to this one place, and am not oblivious to the fact that there are laws in place that firmly uphold a certain level of idiocy in the workplace. although i'm confident that i've transitioned into a vital component of that company over the recent months, i am still retorting to the mentality of viewing this is as another stepping stone. there simply must be a better application of self in the future, because i cannot see myself toiling upon this fruitless path for years to come. there isn't much to reap and it's imperative for my well-being to keep my brain engaged. 

also, i've been asked to play synth for this local band [name withheld] for a slew of shows lined up. this may or may not happen depending upon the digestion of everything else currently clogged in my system. although it's kind of flattering that i often get opportunities like this, i am rather disgusted by what the NYC 'industrial' scene has devolved into in my year of absence, but that entails a lengthy rant allocated for another day. it's all about fun right? discretion. discretion. sadness and discretion."

in an attempt to answer to some of the nebulous debate concerning my return to this vile city i will only say the following: my decision to move back here had everything to do with the idea of slowing down the deterioration that had rapidly engulfed my existence during my stay in new england, and was not made to purposely offend anyone. although i made some great friends and will retain lasting memories, notable failure to attain worthwhile employment or accomplish anything for myself led me back to this festering hole. i'm glad it was good for you, but i was circling the drain. thank you for understanding. [not that any of you still read this anyways]

between ballasting <a href=""http://i680.photobucket.com/albums/vv170/blackeyedbeauty/todriveyouinsane.jpg"">migraines</a> i've allocated much of my free time for work on challenging new material - nothing vastly different from my previous output, although it is a bit more abstract in some amorphous attempt to crossbreed more contorted, glitchy rhythmic elements into the mix - forcing me to delve deeper into reaktor and other software and keeping hardware reserved as more of an afterthought. much time to further develop my techniques while listening to a lot of dark ambient, 'idm', and breakcore - my disdain for what gets attention these days always building the rift between myself and any possible 'success' in the foreseeable future. .but i can live with that. 

everyday life is strange from my chemically imbalanced alien viewpoint. i'm trying to rediscover emotions again but often fear that the frequency of what some embittered wisdom allows me to feel my never recover from some long-term psychological damage that's been ingrained into my thought process. better than being governed by one's emotions i guess. .growing accustomed to suffering this inhuman fate. .anything taxing on my brain is therapeutic for now."

turning a critical eye on my past. i often experience difficulty in swallowing the notion of my own existence until it can be supported through concrete evidence such as the work below. .a live and mostly improvised [explaining the slightly off-timed percussion and console hiss] compound polarization of my positive[?] effort to experiment negatively charged with my self-destructive impulses, all channeled thru the dying entity i was back then. i sometimes have difficulty recreating such pieces with the subjective oscillation of my 'good' and 'bad' experiences, while always trying to make sense of the chaotic, grey area in between. .

some of this might sound pissy but it's not. i'm just reporting some things..

i had a good weekend. ran around between venues catching awesome performances by <lj user=""cenotype"">, <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/tonikom"">Tonikom</a>,<lj user=""pr0_burn"">, and <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/inswarm"">Inswarm</a> on Saturday, and wound up downing some shots at Asylum Guild with friends afterwards. apparently there was a celebration going on for Gothic Goddess Media and she was showing her photos of all the bands she has photographed over the past year. Not the ones she took of <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/blackeyedbeauty"">black.eyed.beauty</a> last summer of course, because she hates me. ;) it's pretty funny. she dislikes me because after interviewing me, she asked me to write some reviews for her zine and, after giving it some thought, i told her i didn't feel right writing CD reviews about what i thought of some of the bands she'd be interviewing. as a musician, i don't feel it's really my place to inspect others [my honesty would be unappreciated]. i explained that the music i make is simply to comment and experiment, and that publicly detailing my opinion of others doing their own things would be kind of cynical and damaging. i also said that there are plenty of people that would be glad to take that role. i was also balancing working, interning, and playing in 3 bands at the time so i had very little to spare. she took offense to this and sent me three nasty and very immature [drunken?] e-mails, followed by some message board slander action and dirty looks whenever we cross paths. before she decided to trash me i had personally connected her to several of my friends' bands, including <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/kaltefarben"">kAlte fArben</a> and <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/iparasite"">i, parasite</a>, so it's not like i was a dick to her or anything. [kind of <a href=""http://www.metropolis-records.com/artists/?artist=kalte"">a big deal</a>?] a few months ago i shot her an e-mail in attempts to end the bullshit but she just ignored me so whatever, i don't have any negative feelings towards her or what she does, and wish no malice upon it. i have kept it to myself until now, in attempts to make very small point. i try to stay out of drama and out of the way, but i guess i'm just a dislikable person coz i seem to make enemies often, and with very little or no effort. i've given more than i'll ever receive, i take care to consume very little, sacrifice a lot of my time to help those around me, take up very little space, and make sure not to support the killing of anything, yet am often ostracized for the most insignificant things. [naturally too existential for my own good?]

it doesn't bother me though. those who are trying their hardest to make things happen and keep things alive will always have my respect. those who can think for themselves and live their lives constructively will also have my respect. those who have nothing to offer except their opinions are easy to ignore. i'm concerned with much larger issues than what is going on within the 'scene' and i deal with much bigger problems on a daily basis. 

in other news, following the collapse of several record labels and recording studios, the Virgin Megastore in Union Square is liquidating its inventory and closing in a few months apparently. the largest corporate record store in NYC is closing due its inability to sell enough items to afford the rent. some will blame this on downloading but i don't believe that is the only culprit. more so it's a matter of a. the lame mainstream music that has been coming out over the last few years submits itself to the loudness war, therefore people are becoming less and less interested in these waves of boring sounding music [listening fatigue?], b. they charge way too much for CDs these days, and c. no one has any money anymore thanks to the falling value of the dollar. i try to buy CDs from the artists i'd like to keep around, but i don't know. most of the CDs i buy come mail ordered from indie labels, or i buy them directly at a show. it's also defeating to see that many of the artists i've really supported over the years aren't selling much at all anymore while a lot of these simpler bands emerge and manage. [mass bad taste?]

i feel dirty after typing this. to be continued..."

a live, noisy version of 'Dying Cinder' and very short clip of one of the new songs are now available for preview at the <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/blackeyedbeauty"">black.eyed.beauty</a> myspace page. although this version has an extra layer of distortion from the mixer, and the drum timing is a bit off in places, i'm proud of the way we improvised this meltdown of noise on stage.  expect a reworked studio version on the next release..

i was skeptical about giving any previews of the next record until it is done...but i cut this segment to give people a slight idea of what to expect...i'm not sure but i think i'm going to have to master and distribute it myself...again.

also, <i>Torn In Vital Places</i>, the first black.eyed.beauty release, is officially sold out. i may print more when i get the funds, but it'll be a bit of time. 

we've been recording like mad since the incident in December. i think this may be a better year for us..

i'd <b>appreciate</b> it if everyone took a minute to read this. these guys are astounding musicians as well as longtime friends and did not deserve this happening to them...

copied from the band's myspace blog:

<i>""well, murphy's law is usually in full force for us but, this time, we really got fucked over.  On 6/18, almost all of our gear was stolen from our practice space in New Britain, CT.  It would seem that a crew of social leeches tore down one of the doors and emptied the place out in broad daylight.  All in all, about $11,000 worth of equipment was taken.  Here's a short list of a few of the higher-priced pieces - if you're local, keep an eye open at music shops/pawn shops/etc.  If anyone has any info that would lead us to who may have stolen these things from us, please let us know.  Also (obviously) we won't be playing out until we can replace our gear or, by some divine miracle, it is found.""</i>

some of the stolen items:
Korg MS2000 analog synthesizer
Korg KP3 Kaoss Pad
Roland SP-404 Sampler
Electro-Voice Force i25 PA loudspeakers
Samson monitors
Samson Power Amps
Samson EQ and crossover rack units
Ampeg SVT-CL bass amp
Ampeg 4x10 cabinet
Hartke 2x15 cabinet
M-Audio 88-key MIDI controller
Fender Japanese Strat
Squire Strat
Fender Japanese Jazz Bass
Peavey guitar and bass
SM58 microphones
Various mixers, keyboards, guitar pedals, the list goes on...

<i>""the only things the assholes left were the two PA subwoofers, drums, and a couple guitar amps/speaker cabs

thanks,
IA""</i>


anyone who might have any information or where any of this gear could be should contact the band at <a href=""http://www.hardcoreisdead.com"">hardcoreisdead.com</a> or the <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/downwiththescene  
"">Infection Agenda</a> myspace site.

and for the rest of us that have studios or any other expensive equipment, it might be a good time to make a list of your serial numbers and store it somewhere safe."

""I'm stoked to find a group that I'm actually impressed by. Usually you find all these 'industrial' bands on myspace with a lame drum machine and a retarded sounding guitar... that's it... But no, I love Black Eyed Beauty's stuff, sincerely, and the vocals are fucking brilliant. If you ever want a remix or anything... Lets me know!""

the next move after this show is to launch the offical website again...it was made over a year ago and has been laying dormant on my harddrive ever since, so i will launch this again soon. i've been meaning to for awhile now."

oh and,

i fucking love Red Harvest. this songs makes me envision myself pushing one my worst enemies off a high cliff, and watching the bodies fumble and mangle on their way into the chasm...much like the video simulation of what would have happened to Evil Kenevil's (hope i spelled that right) son if he didn't make it across the Grand Canyon on that motorcycle...except with guts shredding and spilling with every impact, collecting loose gravel in every wound, as i just stand at the summit and watch for the vultures, swarming into the abyss to tear the closing, dying eyes out, tugging loose carrion from each other's bills, squacking up their blood soaked gullets in ravenous delight, picking at whatever is left of the carcass. i walk away expressionless. 

not much else to say. hope you all are well."

as my mother's and father's homes are now partially underwater, the possibilities for us shooting some of the film in the basement of my mother's house up in New Hampshire no longer seem possible. apparently, streets are closed as well and a lot of my family's possessions have been damaged or destroyed. this really blows and i hope there will be some sort of insurance payoff for all the damages after the water recedes. i hope all my family and friends around the southern NH-northern MA area are making out okay...the sewage pipes bursting and pouring waste into the Merrimack river must be one vile stench...<a href=""http://articles.news.aol.com/news/article.adp?id=20060514115709990001&amp;ncid=NWS00010000000001"">(more pictures and coverage on the New England flood here)</a>

Chelsea and I are looking to shoot one of the scenes of this film in a grimey, basement atmosphere. we're looking into expanding our options, and if anyone around the NYC area can provide us with a basement for a day to shoot in within the next week, drop one. we will be most grateful. yes, were are going to make a terrible mess, but we will clean up everything and restore all order before we are finished. we've found the perfect actors and actresses to fit the roles, and have a lot of props and locations to organize and get together before the hellish shooting can begin. we havent clawed each other's throats out yet, and i have a notion things will turn out well.

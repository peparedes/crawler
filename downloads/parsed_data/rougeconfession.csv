"event","Well, I finally got my braces off today.  The stereotypes are true, my teeth to look big and feel slimey.  I missed my most-hated class though so I was happy.  Plus, I got to sleep in an extra 20 minutes.  That makes a big difference!  So yeah.  I got them off in the morning and then had to go back after school to get my retainers (I already dislike those...) and so I went to brush my teeth at the sink and this girl who I have no idea who she is starts talking to me and asking me all these questions.  And I'm just thinking ""does it look like I've got something [toothpaste] in my mouth?!""  But apparently not, and so she continues to tell me about how when they took her ""expressions"" (she meant impressions) that she puked on them.  I'm just thinking, 'great, my life is now complete that I know this.'  
Well, I can no longer go to FSHS's prom with my best bud.  I'm kinda sad about that because we were gonna have fun.  I still don't see what's wrong with going as friends with a guy, but apparently there are problems or else Jonathan wouldn't have said anything.  Chris Carter taught me about this as well.  Oh well, though, I can't do anything about it.  I just feel REALLY bad now because it's kinda late to get someone else to go with and so now my friend's gonna be left out or not go or whatnot.  So yeah.  There are things I don't understand in this world.  It appears, from what I've been learning lately, that if you are dating someone then you aren't allowed to have friends of the opposite sex.  Ya know, I really don't like that.  I don't feel as if someone has the right to say who I can and cannot talk with.  Jonathan doesn't care if I talk to people though.  Good, he better not.  
I have a lot going on this week.  I have 11 chapters in TKAM to read, 2 chapters in my history book, four tests on Friday, one test-like-quiz on Thursday, and a portfolio for Friday.  Yeah, it sucks!  So I have to get to work.
Later blossoms

"event","Ah, today was great!  Guess what! My boyfriend actually missed me yesterday!  A thrice in a lifetime event!  He still hasn't asked about GSA, but, wow, that really made my day hehe.  It's so weird because it seems like all these things I've wanted to know, are being shown now.  At 11:55 last night, my best bud called me from New York and he said he missed me a lot too!  And Kara said she did, today.  Wow, I didn't know that people actually cared that much about me!!
Remember how earlier this year I kept wanting to know what I smelled like?  Well, yesterday Cole and Megan were like, 'you smell good Caley' so I guess I know now.  Haha
Poteet was gone again today(!) Supposedly he was sick.  Such a shame he had to miss all those complaining parents at parent teacher conferences tonight... tsk tsk
I'm on this relgioustolerance.org website finding out some stuff about other branches of Christianity.  I like being Catholic, but I feel so ignorant of what other people do and I think it's kinda important to be informed.  
I've been looking up college stuff.  I still really want to go to Oberlin.  Centre looks good if I stay in-state.  University of Rochester doesn't look bad either.  I think I'd like it considering there are no required classes, but it's not some breeze thing.  It's just you take what's important.  Plus, I could take Harley with me!  I'd have a College Bunny lol.  I dunno.  I want to get a good music education, but I want a good general education too.  I'm definately going to do at least a double-major.  
Well, I have to study now.  Happily, Mrs. Baker is letting us use an index card on our test.  We can put whatever we want to on it and use it for the test.  How awesome is that?  I'm gonna have to learn how to write really small hehe tiny tiny.

I have a crapload of homework that I can't seem to do because I procrastinate too much.

I have been needing clothes.  Maybe now someone will notice me hehe.  People said I looked pretty on Thursday night, but he wasn't there to see.  Oh well.

I had something else to say but I forgot... um um um oh well.  Oh yeah, my  birthday is comin' up in about 2 months (May 19th!!!) and I want Eisley's CD... but hey Easter's even earlier so if ya love me... :)

I got to see Jonathan after not hearing from him for a few days and Megan had some spiffy new shoes (as did I, of course).  Mrs. Winfrey told me that I got 1st in oral proficiency and then 3rd in the grammar/vocab. test for the WKU foreign language thing ( I did French).  I may've gotten 2nd on the test because the person they put as first place was actually in a different level. That'd be cool.  I had a slight boost in confidence then; I hadn't had one in a while.  Then I got insulted by Tressa because apparently I'm selfish and not generous.  Okay, I am really busy too.  I'm not going to get practice time in tonight and when is my audition?  That's right SATURDAY.  Oh well, I'll fail anyway.  I'm bad at clarinet.  That and all my reeds suck.  I will be happy after Saturday is over.  I am getting sick of my piece.  Lamento is making me lament haha.  Plus, I want it to stop hanging over my head.  It's this cloud that won't go away!  Natalie and I had a conversation in SWAMP that I've been thinking about.  It's kinda bothering me- the topic- and so that's over my head too.  Mom got mad at me again tonight.  No, she's not abusive, I'm just awful.  Like she said, maybe I am selfish."

Nobody would know that anymore.  I'd like to think I was good at music, but nope.  Two years of band isn't hardly enough.  I try to be there for people, since I figure, well if I can't do anything, at least I could make other people feel good, but they don't want me.

"event","well, thing were going great this week.  Sunday was awesome.  I went to Church, worked on CNYR, and then out with Jonathan for the first time in a long time and it was fun.  I saw some other people too.  I was gone on Monday for foreign language.  I was happy 'cause I didn't have to deal with Poteet. YAY!  I still don't know how I did, and, of course, since I'm so curious, I'm just dying to know.  It was hard though.  I took the grammar/vocab. test and oral proficiency tests in French.  Yeah... I felt pretty dumb after those, but I still enjoy the language.  When I got back to school, Jonathan wasn't there (he was kinda ill) and that was sad, but I called him later and had an amazing conversation with him.  He didn't get upset at me at all and I was so happy.  Then I did my algebra2 with Cole, since I missed it.  Umm... Tuesday was good.  My bf was back at school and it was great.  He hasn't been in such a good mood in forever.  I'm not going to see him a lot next week.  That'll suck. He wasn't in a good mood at all today.  It's kinda scary and kinda sad.  I dunno, but they both start with 'S' so it's okay.  I made a funny, but mean comment today.  It sent Megan and me cracking up.  Band was hilarious.  Shannon, oh gosh I love her, she is hilarious!  I wish people liked me too lol.  I decided on doing marching band next year.  Insane, I know, but hey, I wanna do it.  I want to take sociology and psychology.  I think what I'll do is maybe take sociology instead of computer apps since they are being ridiculously stupid in not letting me go to soc. 2 days a week and comp. apps the other 3.  I don't see any issues with this, but the office is stupid.  Oh well.  I wouldn't have to worry if we didn't have to take FIVE maths.  If you're ungood at math, like I am, then it sucks.  I was lucky, last quarter in alegbra 2 I got a 101.56.  That is amazing; I've never had that high of a grade in math of all subjects.  Well, I will work something out and see if compromising will work.  I think it ought to... I don't see why not anyways!  Maybe I could do it during concert band... if they have it in the afternoon.  I like concert band though, but the stuff in there isn't too hard.  I'll have to think about it.  It's gonna be tough, and I would be excited if people would just STAY and not leave me together by myself.  
Well, I'm going to do my homework, hope to no avail that someone will call me, and go to sleep.  Goodnight.  No weight... it's not that time yet lol just kidding.  It's 4:42 and that's just really odd. Okay.  I'm going now.  GoodBYE"

"event","I am having a very difficult time deciding on classes for next year.  This is eating me up inside.  It's hard having band, because I'm limited and there's stuff I want to take to make me smart.  I really want to be smart.  I am just so confused and it's kinda furthering my stress level.  I plan on taking 3 ap classes total (1 next year, 2 sr year), the regular amount of honors classes, psychology, french 3 (before ap french which is included in one of the 3), independent music, computer apps ('cause I have to do so, but I'll try to clip that one if I can), and then band.  Um, this clearly does not add up.  I've been messin' around with a couple schedules and I just don't know.  I'm gonna be busy next year with an ap class, band, my instrument, and then academic team (Which Chris and I are going to do next year; we're not gonna weasle our way out of it again).  Oh well, I have to remind myself that next year I'll have no friends and thus no social life to worry about.  

(in no order)
Jr Year

AP History
Honors Physics
Honors English 3
PreCalculus
French 3
Concert Band
Marching Band (?) Or maybe get a math/science out of the way... I hate how schools are so geared towards math/science people, because I'm not the greatest at those things, nor do I like them...

Sr Year

AP French/Psychology (I find that it shouldn't be too much of a problem for me to go 2 days a week for one semester to take Psychology)
AP English
Chem 2
Prob & Stats
Concert Band
Marching Band (?) Yet again, it depends.  I know that having independent music would be more useful for me, but I just don't know.  Maybe I could work somethin' out.  I DON'T KNOW!  If only I didn't have to take a 5th math (Don't even get me started) then I could work it all out!  I just don't know.  Maybe they'll late me double up on something, or I could learn something and do stuff in the summer, take a test, and then clip out of it.  Do you think I could do that?  I really don't know.  I dislike that I have to take some classes that I'm not interested in when there are things that I deem necessary (so they must be haha) and I can't take them, because I'm go nna be taking a bunny math class.  Oh well, that is not my fault, but their's.  Argh.  If anybody has any suggestions, I would be glad to hear them..."

"event","Christine, since your thingie won't let me comment.  I just thought I'd tell you that we're really alike, and I hope everything gets better for you.  I've been feeling underappreciated a lot this month as well, actually.  So if you ever want, you can vent with me; I'd love to help.

Today was okay (that rhymed!)  I was stupid and went to bed at 6 am this morning, even though Jonathan and I left pretty early from that party.  I was working on CNYR stuff and just didn't want to stop.  Oh well, I still got more sleep than I get during the week.  

I was on the phone a lot today.  I've decided that maybe I'm going to work a bit harder, because even though I'd really love it if he'd think about me more, I know it won't happen, so it's okay.  It's not really bad, because it's not, I don't know really how to say it.  I guess, it's not like he doesn't want to, it's just that sometimes he gets focused on something or he just thinks he has spent a lot of time with me.  I don't know.  I'm just so idealistic that compared to his sensible realism, I just don't flow with that all the time, but most of the time I do.  So it's okay.  Love him, I really do.  

Well, I have to go to bed and read some.  I might work on getting ahead in French.  I dunno, I decided that I like languages.  Maybe I should be a foreign language teacher?  But I do love my clarinet.  There's so much stuff I'd like to do, and I can't do it all.  That sucks, but I am attempting to work it out.  Well, goodnight."

I don't know what my deal is, but I've really let out this year.  People know more about me.  In some ways I like that, but in others I don't.  Hopefully tomorrow will be better. 
Also, I just thought I'd say, that I have realized my hopelessness on clarinet.  I will never be good like these other people.  Today in band, I just froze up.  It was all short and resty and blah.  I get so scared of other people all thinking I'm bad.  Well, I proved them right."

"event","Graceland- B. Hewerdine
Would I give you money?
I don't know
the free-est things in life are best
and so, put me to the test
now... 

And when I die
will you build the Taj Mahal?
wear black every day of your life?
I doubt it 

You will never see Graceland... 
All my wanting, all my waiting, all my working
all my wickedness
for all my yearning, inside I'm shutting down 

Lucky Penny- B. Hewerdine/Reader
I found a lucky penny
I thought my luck would change
Easy times and carefree days
Would be mine again 

When I saw it shining
Down in the dirt
I bent down and picked it up
Held it 'til it hurt 

Said I hope you're a lucky one
Hope you're a lucky one
I pray you're a lucky one
I hope you're a lucky one 

I keep it with me all the time
Ever near at hand
When the world is closing in
You take what you can 

Oh I hope you're a lucky one
I hope you're a lucky one
I pray you're a lucky one
I hope you're a lucky one 

I found a lucky penny
My superstitions failed
Who am I fooling?
Good fortune's not for sale 

Oh I hope you're a lucky one
I hope you're a lucky one
I pray you're a lucky one
I hope you're a lucky one 


Apple Tree-Hewerdine
You can keep your science book
Leave that on the shelf
It's only full of numbers
Won't tell you too much else
Can't escape from gravity
Underneath the apple tree
Oh-oh 

See that silver moon
Silver moon shining in the sky
See that silver moon
Still going to be shining when you die
When you die 

Look at all your riches
So shiny and so new
One day all that stuff's
Gonna come crashing down on you
Can't escape from gravity
Underneath the apple tree
Oh-oh 

See that silver moon
Silver moon shining in the sky, yeah
See that silver moon
Still going to be shining when you die
When you die 

I don't know where love is from
I've got no idea
But anyone can tell you
Soon as it gets here
Can't escape from gravity
Underneath the apple tree
Oh-oh 

**Ignorance-Hewerdine**
Said the butcher to the knife
""Must I take another life?""
Said the bullet to the passing sky
""Must I make another father cry?""
And the young girl you hear laughing
Will one day wear black
And I can't bear the sadness
I want my ignorance back 

And the new life that she carries
Will one day be hurt
And the lips you are kissing
Will one day be dirt
And each time we fail
We're closer to our last chance
And I can't bear the sadness 
Give me back my ignorance 

We are what we know 

And every dream you cling to now
Will one day be old
And everything that's pure or good
Can somehow be sold
And like the last couple
In a marathon dance
I can't bear the sadness
Give me back my ignorance

"event","I feel somewhat obligated to say something since I haven't in a while.  Last week was interesting. I'm very off in my own world.  If you knock on the door, I'll answer it.  
For some good news, I got my new clarinet on Saturday!! It's great.  It's an R-13 and it's got silver keys and it's pretty and it sounds good and yay for run-ons!  It was really sad though because I had to give up Jude, and you guys know how I get with my instruments... It was very sad.  I'm considering naming my new one Vladimir.       
Yesterday a friend of mine came over and we got smart together.  Yesterday, okay I have to tell you about yesterday because it was just I dunno.  Well Jonathan said he was gonna come and see me for a bit, and I told my friend that I'd call and say when to come.  So I waited and waited and waited for 4 hours and then Jonathan calls and says that he can't.  I'm not mad at him, it's just ya know I wasted 4 hours and I really did want to see him since he's always soooooo busy lately.  So anyway I was sad 'cause I didn't get to see him and sad 'cause I wasted time, but then I went to go get my other friend and these police people went all whacko.  We had no clue what they were doing, and it was hilarious 'cause it looked like some messed up conducting pattern and we still don't know what they were doing there.  But anyways, my day got better.
Oh! Flavorsplash came out the other day!  It's good.  The citrus is okay, but I love the wild berry and raspberry ones.  Yum.  I still can't wait for sparkling though.  I'm getting impatient.
My best bud in Franklin and I were really tuned in last night.  It was hilarious, finishing each other's sentences.  It was great though; I've been needing some sort of 'being needed' feeling I guess you could say.  I felt appreciated.  That's it.  We are both like maple syrup.  I felt really badly for him yesterday night.  It'll all get better I hope.  People are just ignorant.  Sometimes I wish God would send certain people dreams that said ""Hey, pay attention, so-and-so's important!""  I guess it doesn't work like that.  
Well, I'm going to work on getting smarter I suppose.  I might read some in All Quiet on the Western Front for first block.  Speaking of that class, I am once again pissed at the teacher.
Oh, I can wear my contacts again!  Yeah, my cornea ulcer is good as gone, but now I've got a dent in my eye. Ick, I'm deformed.  Oh well. Tata

I lost all I believed in
And I never found myself so low
And you let me down

I just thought I'd let everyone know that I'm feeling a lot better now that my epiphany weekend is over.  Realising that you're disappointed with yourself is the worst feeling ever.  Well, one of the worsts, there are more, I think.  Generally I am one of those people that 'complains about stuff you can't do anything about.'  I really don't intend on doing that, but this time I'm going to switch myself into a better, smarter person like I used to be.  That is the main part of my C.N.Y. Resolution.  I'm excited to be great again.  I can't wait!  Well, in order to follow my CNYR, I've gotta do some MORE work, so I'll talk to you later!  
Bye!!

"event","Cole didn't update.  He lied, but today I am doing this for my faithful audience! Ha.
Yesterday I was listening to Lost at Sea by this band called Eisley and now I'm listening to All at Sea by the ever-so-talented Jamie Cullum.  He is my favorite singer AFTER Damien Rice.  It's all jazzy, literally.  I like jazz.  It's very Caley-ish in the sense that it talks mainly about two things-love and sadness.  Notice how I said mainly, because, do I even need to say this (?, other topics are covered as well.
Today, I am not even going to hide the fact that I have issues.  The world's view of me cracks me up.  Speaking of views, let's talk physical now.  What do I look like?  A mirror won't answer that; I'm honestly not sure... don't laugh at that.  It's not funny.
First issue-departure.  Of course I never like to see Jonathan leave, but I dunno, I was really bad today.  I just really did not want him to go.  I wanted him to just stay with me; is that so wrong?  I crave companionship, although I'm quite independent at the same time.  I'm independently dependent or dependently independent.  It works both ways actually.  Anyhow, I feel bad about that.  I must be the worst girlfriend ever.  I'm reading this one book Shannon's letting me borrow (I REALLY MISS HER!!) and it's got this part in there about not spending too much time right away and all this stuff.  When I read that, I was like oh crap, because clearly... even though I really don't, I would like to do so.  I'm bad, and that makes me sad (rhyme).
Second issue-missingness.  I miss it.  That's all I can say.  And it's killing me.  (Oh this good song is on... it's called Old Devil Moon and it's not on my CD argh, but that's okay because High and Dry is and I love that song too!  WHY NOT JUST PUT ALL 16 instead of 15 on each kinda?  Hmm? Oh well anyways...)  With me, if something is not there to remind me then I'm fine.  It's like a window.  If there's a curtain over it, you can't look outside and see all the destruction going on.  It seems like somebody's peaking through the curtain (or somebodies maybe).  I did that with academic team, and anybody that knew me in my life before my life started they would know that.  It was the only thing that I will say, ""Hey I was great at that"" and not be worried about sounding conceited.  I was good.  In language arts in 8th grade I was 11th at state.  One question away from placing.  I cried for a while after that.  It sucked.  And for quick recall we had the starters, and I was Captain Caley.  And I was really good at that too, and it was like people recognised me.  My weakness is coming out here-my love for attention.  I really really hate to say this but I love it- being the center of attention that is.  Now (not only with academic team, just in general) I have been reduced to nothing.  I have no talents now and it's quite dreadful for someone like me, especially since I was used to it in elem and middle school.  (Okay, this paragraph is gonna be really jumpy) But this whole academic team situation, I was fine for the past two years because nobody mentioned it.  It wasn't talked about at all and the curtain was drawn.  It started out earlier this year as in first block it'd come up occasionally, since the rest of ""The Starters"" are in there with me.  And I could deal with that- the comments and stuff- I was okay. But then (Now my grammar is awful in this and you'd never know the proof of my 11th-ness, but honestly I just don't care on journal entries) they recruited Jonathan, Cole, and Ashley for it.  They're all close to me, and at first that was okay, but then I started hearing about it more.  Not even about what they did, just the fact that there was a practice to go to, like on Wednesday and many other days.  It just comes up so much now that all this come-uppage has pulled back the curtain that I so carefully hung.  This is a problem, 'cause now of course I want to do it again. DON'T YOU DARE SAY I JUST WANT TO DO IT FOR PEOPLE.  I would have to kill you for that, because that is way far from the truth.  I don't care if you believe it (okay yes I do), but just don't say anything.  Now this was a really odd and long rant, but it was quite vital to get out of the system.  It's kinda funny that it was only a brief of what's going on in my head.
Third issue-hopelessness(?.  I'm not sure if that is the correct term, so maybe I should've put failure-ism and just made one up.  But yes, right now I am feeling like a failure and quite incompetent.  I just don't know as much stuff anymore.  I used to be so smart and now I'm just not it seems.  I should be working harder at school, and definately at my music.  My noviceness at clarinet isn't even funny.  There are all these things I ought to be improving on and I don't because I can't concentrate. I can't; my focus level is zero.  So I am going to do some revamping in my room to promote self-motivation (something I'm not too good at).  I've already started by taking down the ads on my door. Yes I loved those ads, as I think they're so clever.  My favorites were the ones about the nuts.  They were so funny and Caleyish sort of humor.  They were great, but now they're gone.  Torn in the trash [can].  It's sad too, isn't it?  I hate change.  CHANGE SUCKS.  For some reason, the way I made that made it look like I put 'cancer' instead of 'change.'  Well, cancer sucks too or is that some hidden message?  Hmm...
Well, I am going to start standing against stupidity and start getting smart again.  I'm not going to fail this time, seriously.  If I can lose enough weight to get in the 120's (which I did by the way!! YAY), then I can definately do this.  Your lended support would be appreciated.
Going-to-be-Smart--ly yours,
Caley"

For all you people that care, I did get 3rd chair in band! YAY!  I was so worried I wouldn't get it, and, I don't want to sound conceited, honestly I don't, so if you disagree then tell me, but I believe I got the chair I deserved.  My audition for it did really suck though, 'cause Shannon and I worked on the second movement all through lunch and 30 min. of another class.  All that for nothin'! Oh well; it all worked out.
I helped my brother work on this piece of music and it made me feel really good. I love helping people.  I ought to maybe be a social worker or a teacher that does it right unlike a CERTAIN one I have. (need I say more?)
Yesterday I went home with Chris since Jonathan decided to stay after for something.  Since it was wet and my shoes canNOT get wet, I took them off and walked sock-footed to the vehicle.  That was dumb of me; I should've taken my socks of too.  They ended up icky and wet and made my feet numb. So if you see some socks in the parking lot... um... guess whose!!  The ride was very, well, hmm... I'll just say that it was not a ride possible to fall asleep on.  Some bus cut us off and nearly killed us, and then we almost ran into a car parked in its own driveway.  It's always interesting with him ha.  
Today I was doing some of Josh's homework and I found a new word I can use to describe somebody. It's abhorrence.  If you're one of four people, or possibly more, then I'm sure you can figure out who this is...
Anna King is my new hero.  Anna King is my king! Hahaha She was the first to finally get onto Poteet for his lying/mindchangey-ness.  FINALLY! We needed somebody! GO ANNA!
I got a surprise in the mail today! I was so excited because I definately DON'T ABHOR surprises!!! YAY!  It was a letter and this really really teeny bottle of tabasco sauce (there's a joke w/ that).  It was cute.
Also, it's been really odd lately, because Jonathan and Cole are now participating in academic team.  It makes me miss it even more.  Chris (not the one above, the other one) and I are going to do it again next year.  See, it's one thing when I miss it and don't hear about it, but it's completely different when I have to hear how my boyfriend has to go do it.  Also, and I know this is somewhat(well, a lot) silly, but one of the things they're making him do is in language arts, and that was my area of expertise.  I was the one who got 11th in 8th grade at state and if he gets it his first time (which I doubt, not 'cause he's stupid... he's VERY smart, but because that's definately a thing you have to learn a certain way) then I'll be kinda like, well geez I'm REALLY dumb.  Oh well.  I'm weird.  Sorry for bringing that up.
I have an icky cold right now.  My nose is all ew, and it's pretty bad when I'm sneezing more than Harley, don't you think?  Yeah.
Well, I have to do some more work on this power point for Frenchie II.  I picked Versailles.  It's SO PRETTY!!  Of course, this is my first time on pp, but that's okay.  Yesterday night I just discovered that we have it on our computer. Wow!  That is really useful.  Well... I can't think of anything else.  I hope you're happy Colular!"

On the Scarlet Pimp Daddy test I got a 100! WOW And I didn't even finish it... Odd... On the one I took this week I got a 96.  I know the ones I missed too, well now anyways.   I didn't then.  But I am just really happy about this.  It makes my day better.  I have 100's in Swamp and Band (of course), a 97 in French2, and then in Algebra2 a 98.  Wow.  I hope I can remain this way.  Jake and I are geniuses.
Today, I woke up upside.  My feet were towards my headboard on my bed, and I was facing my clarinet.  I was like, 'Hey I didn't put Jude there...""  It was really weird.  I haven't been feeling that great all day.  Illness sucks.  I wasn't yesterday either, and Chris whacked me in the stomach.  That was so what I needed.
Cole is officially my hero of the day because he took me to Royal.  We got there like 3 minutes before it closed, and I saw one of my teachers there, which was cool.  She said she saw my mom last week there and then me this week.  I needed some reeds so badly, and now that I have them I sound wonderful.  Yesterday, I stayed late after school talking with Chris and Shannon and Jonathan was talking with his friend.  Mine left, so I was kinda like... I dunno, and I ended up working with my GSA piece with Cecil.  I used to be so scared of him thinking I sucked at clarinet.  I think I'm just really confident with the piece I have.  I like it a lot; it's pretty.  
I am considering doing this essay for somewhere.  I don't want to say though, because I don't want you to take away my winning chances.
Yesterday, I was talking with Keith about all these silly things that these ""mature girls"" say.  It was hilarious.  Also, I went on this website to look at these light-up umbrellas (which I could so use) and found this gnome thing.  I'm trying to convince somebody to get it for someone else.  You guys could probably figure this one out.  
Well, I've got to finish my French2 homework before this party tonight. I spent the class yesterday talking with Betsy and Brigette instead of working... I so cannot work with people. Later!

That makes me happy to know that I was not the only one involved with missing.  During that process, I decided something about the phrase ""home is where the heart is.""  It was quite an enlightening revelation, but I dislike sharing things so sorry.  So how has everyone's Christmas been?  Mine was good...well mostly.  My West Virginia part of the break was fun and fine, but the Pittsburgh part... Oh gosh.  I don't even know where to begin.  Let's just say that my grandmother there and I have a personality clash, and my one cousin grates at my nerves with all the attention she gets.  You'd think that nobody could live without going to college (and other stuff I just won't mention 'cause it's rather disturbing).  If any of my friends or my boyfriend do that next year, I'll kill them. NOT REALLY! DON'T WORRY PEOPLE!! Murder is not something I'm capable of, but I watched a show on serial killers not too long ago.  Big mistake.  I thought I could handle that now. Uh, wrong.  I'm not going to be getting much sleep tonight... let's just put it that way.  After I saw that frightening show, I started lacing my new shoes. I could not decide... bright pink or aqua?  I ended up choosing both, so it'll be interesting to see how that ends up, won't it?  I'm supposed to go see a movie tomorrow with Martha and Whitney, but they changed it, and now I don't want to go.  I only go to movies I want to see and ""Darkness"" does not sound appealing to me.  I cannot handle scary movies... I just can't do them.  They know that too... why can't they pick a movie that I can safely view?  I sent in my gsa application today.  Yeah, I procrastinate... oops.  My mom pissed me off majorly about it this morning.  I don't really want to get too much into that.  Well, there's more stuff that I can't think of to write except that I helped somebody yesterday night.  I'm glad I'm useful; that's important to me... to be useful and to give back to the world.

I'd be Frostina the Snowwoman. Hahaha.

I'm not third chair anymore for alldistrict band.  I'm now first.  I'll tell you the story if you care. 

Today someone said something that kinda hurt.  Well, I don't know if 'hurt' is the appropriate word, but ever since it was said, I'm back to being paranoid and just unconfident.  Honestly, I'm not used to it.  After eight years of nothing, how am I supposed to know?  I really hate being unknowing in something, and I doubt that four days is honestly going to make me a pro.  Still, with all my logic, it sucks.  Yes, I admit that I'd rather know than not know, but that doesn't necessarily mean that I like what I hear.

Yesterday was pep band.  It was pretty fun although there was hardly anybody there.  That fat kid really really gets on my nerves though.  I hate the smell of popcorn and I did not particularly enjoy having it thrown at me, nor him preventing my progression for the GSA thing on Saturday.

After my exciting district news, we went to see Little Shop of Horrors @ BGHS because my friend David was the lead in it.  He did an awesome job, and it was super fun.  I have determined that I can't exactly describe happiness because there are no words for it.  Emotions aren't neccesarily able to be described when I feel as I have been lately.

Boy was he right.  Friday night was the football game.  It was pretty fun.  I got to do something I'd always wanted to do, and it was every bit as great as I'd imagined it to be.  The ride up though was pretty boring, because I was pretty much ignored the whole way.  
Yesterday was the Vet's day parade.  I don't particularly like those.  I got really overheated, but was fine.  I think people are starting to becomes suspicious, and this one girl... I swear I will never understand her.  But it feels nice.  It's like everybody's paying attention to you all of the sudden to see what will happen.  
Today was Sunday, and all I've really done is rested, went to Church, and read my book (I'm almost done with it, and I'll probably finish it by the end of the day).  I must say, it was nice to have instruments back again even though the warmth and my voice weren't there.  I'm overdosing on cough drops today so I'll hopefully sound better by tomorrow.  I hate being sick like I am, but I'm still the happiest fishie in the sea.  Maybe by Tuesday I'll find out how the band auditions went.  I know Mo and Cecil said not to call it ""good band"" and ""bad band"", but seriously, face the truth, that's what it is.  But if they don't want us to say it, I hope I'll make it into the ""Hill Band"" instead of the ""Valley Band.""  Ask me if you don't get the names; there really is a logic to them.  On Saturday I have All-State auditions.  I'm really worried I'll still be sick by then, and even if I'm not, it'll really affect my practicing this week.  I almost passed out in my audition at school and I REALLY hope it doesn't happen there.  Well, I've got to get to work on my stupid scary story for my unnice teacher.  So... farewell"

"event","I hate to come off negative, yet again, but I really don't like Halloween.  It scares me, and I know that's what it's supposed to do, but I don't like that.  Killers and icky stuff always has scared me and then they just throw it in my face on this holiday.  I can hardly watch TV (during the few times I do) without being bombarded by movie commericials.  Those freak me out!  Heck, even the Pitchblack MtDew commercial on Launch scared me... That's kinda sad...
This weekend sucked.  It was really boring, but I DID rearrange my room twice, which was a lot of fun.  I love decorating and I haven't done it in forever!  So there was a little plus to my boring weekend.  It was pretty lonely, excluding Friday night.  That night was fun.  Ashley had a Halloween party, and we freaked out the people that were invited and came in late.  I was a shady character for Halloween... a LAMP! hahaha get it? I couldn't deal with the scary movie though, so I went with four other people to the hot tub, but I could still hear the screams... ick... The scariest movie I've ever seen was The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, in mmm 2nd grade (?) and that was just the cartoon... It's freaky! I mean the guy doesn't have a head!  He's headless... and on a horse!
I'm excited for Monday... I can't help it.  Well, I guess I could, but actually it's kinda nice.  Maybe I don't want to... I can break one of my rules this time, and maybe it might actually be worth my time for once.  I hope so, but hey, if not, at least I can stand being at school a little better now.  
And now I'm sad because I'm talking to Jessica.  She makes me want to have a boyfriend too.  So does Shannon.  Why can't people just let me be all the way unloved instead of halfway unloved.  I don't get it.  What's so wrong with me besides I'm ugly and unskinny... besides that, what?  Seriously, I would like to know.  Give me some honest answers people."

"event","I hate chemistry.  It is science and it is stupid.  What more can I say?  Chemistry causes chemistry. Hahahaha all of you because you don't know what I'm talking about.  BUT I HATE IT!  I HATE the first chemistry and hahaha that is another joke to myself hahaha.  I do not like it in a box, I do not like it with a fox! I DO NOT LIKE CHEMISTRY  I DO NOT LIKE IT SAM I AM!  Today was good and then it was mediocre then it was really really good and then it was ok and then it was blah and icky and it sucked.  Did I mention I hate chemistry?  It is the dumbest thing ever evER EVER!  
Also I have been wondering where my best friend is since he has decided not to get online for the past, oh, THREE days and he doesn't exactly live here.  So his absense is obvious and it is taking a HUGE toll on my sanity (if you couldn't tell).  Then their's this whole olive thing going on.  And it makes me SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HAPPY!!!  And then sometimes I don't know... But, I guess it's better not to know exactly because then there is no more hope.  AND I LIKE HOPE.  There is hope, very little hope, that I will understand chemistry AND chemistry.  I am angry.  I frustrated another.  I'm really sorry."

"event","Okay, I hate to start the subject with such negativity but there's no other word that suits today so well.  I am just fed up with somebody and it's driving me whacko(er).  I am officially going on strike from him.  I'm sick of him ignoring me all the time and just being discretely rude.  I'm going to give an example.  If you and I were standing somewhere, he'd go up to you and have a nice conversation and not acknowledge me at all!  What's up with that?  It seems as if he's embarrassed to talk to me in public, and he won't when we're alone.  So this week, I haven't talked (or sang) at all coming home from school and/or band.  Excluding Tuesday since there were other people in the car... appearances and all...  I shouldn't be as much of a burden as I think I am.  Really, I tell him all the time that if he doesn't want me there to tell me so.  I can tell something's up with him, and I ask him what's wrong, and he just lies and says nothing, like    *I'm*     there weird one.  Ha.  And now I find that one of my friends might be going out drinking on Friday night. I will not stand for that.  Love is more than lenience.  
I broke one of my rules today.  I asked for a ride home from a friend of mine.  I think it was kinda out of the way too. It was fun, but I'm beating myself up for it as we speak, don't worry.  I'd be a good house elf if I were on Harry Potter.  People say that putting people down doesn't help, but it really does.  Sorry if that's bad.  It wouldn't surprise me. I'm a terrible person as it is."

"event","Lately I have felt unneeded.  I'm a waste of oxygen.  Who needs me?  Really?  I was very frustrated today at a certain stupidhead today.  I was ready to just break something.  Somebody actually came to talk to me though and calm me down and that was really sweet.  And I was like (sorry for the improper English okay, it won't be great throughout this one hehe) I want to kill somebody, ha maybe myself, and he said I don't want you to do that or something... I don't exactly remember what.  That made me feel special, but still not needed.  Since I was in elementary school I have often seriously thought that people would be just better off without me.  Like to the guy that pissed me off today, what am I to him?  I don't want to be a lover, honestly, I want to be a friend.  Is that bad?  Like today he wasn't feeling well or something and so I went to ask him what was wrong and I was going to walk back with him but he kinda veered in the other direction when he didn't have to do so, and some other girl comes up and asks and he walks with her!  Totally blows me off!  Now this isn't uncommon but it GRRRR it just makes me so mad!  And I was all excited about these new shoes I got, so I was showing everybody.  So I asked him if he wanted to see them!  He wouldn't've even had to move, I would've brought them over, and he was all ""no I'm going to leave to go home 'cause I'm tired"" and he was sitting in there for like 20 minutes with some more of us.  What's up with that!?  Ugh  If I'm just a person to take home and take to school then I'd really appreciate if he'd just tell me so I can move on with my life.  I don't want to invest in a friendship if I'm the only one giving, ya know?
On a happier note, after band today, I was at Ashley's (Butter) today with Ashley (Peanut) and Brandi and that was a lot of fun because nobody got annoyed at me!  We all had tons to talk about and it was just fun.  One of those talk and everybody be happy kind of things.  I don't know how to say it, but I'm pretty sure everybody's experienced those kinds of things.
Well, I'm worn out from 9-5 band and then Ash's, fun as those may have been, and I've got band (only 9-1 but then a football game ick but no uniforms!! so it's good and bad) early tomorrow... well early for me. hehehe.  So hopefully I'll have a better day.  I hope so; I don't need distractions before state competition on Saturday!! yay!"

"event","I don't know what my deal is, but lately I've been feeling all mopey and lonesome.  I kind of blame myself; I've been watching TV so I see the perfect love cycles of beautiful people.  Then I see myself who's never had a love or whatever you'd call it in the whole 15 years of my life and ugly.  Completely opposite.  So lately love or the lack thereof has been on my mind and I want some.  Not sex, but love.  I have never been one of those sex-crazed people.  I am the least sexed-up person there is.  I don't fantasize about making wild love in bed with some guy, just being beside some guy in bed not doing anything.  I don't spend every waking moment dreaming about all those physical aspects of a relationship.  I seriously want love, you know, where the person cares about you and wants to be there for you.  I've never had that, and I've always wanted it.  I've always been a touchy kind of person; I like arms around me and that feeling of safety.  I know I told myself that it was wonderful not having a crush on anybody since this summer, and I suppose that's good, after all they're called ""crushes"" for a reason...  But I have to admit... it DOES get lonely.  It wouldn't be so bad if I weren't the only one, but I seem completely alone here.  Shannon's got Chris, Kara's got Neal (or is it il I've never took the time to check...)Claire's got someone even if he's far away, and even Martha's starting to get something going on in her life.  Whenever I figure out what's wrong with me I really will change it.  I promise, or maybe I'm just meant to be a nun.  At least I'm Catholic; it works out."

"event","Yesterday I got some new shoes.  I have been in such a shoe mood lately.  They're really cute.  White Chucks that are flip-outable to pink and green argyle.
Today is the first day of fall break.  So far I've done nothing exciting.  I'm not one of those people that counts down the days until breaks, albeit I looked forward to the sleep I'd get on this one especially.  I had more hours of sleep today than I had all week. Is that not pathetic-ish?  So all I did today was sleep, practice clarinet for all-state/district which is coming up soon (well in a month, but that is still soon!), and read.  Woohoo, how fun...
I was actually hoping to do something with people today.  I don't know what, but something!  It seems like all my friends are going to do something, but me.  I don't know, I probably wouldn't be invited; I'm still not sure they really like me.  After this summer, I'm just not sure anymore.  How will I ever know who's just pretending to be my friend or not?  He sure did pull it off well.  It sucks.  I have 8 people total that I'm for sure like me.  That's not a lot compared to the amount of people I hang with.  People just don't care like I want them to.  I expect too much.  Josh told me I was too dependent on people, and ya know I never really thought of that before because I've always been so independent that maybe there is a very fine line between the two.  It's just that I've seen and read so many things about friends being close that I've always wanted one.  Not even a boyfriend right now; I'm so not looking right now.  I just want someone to talk with, someone that wants me around and doesn't forget to invite me or feels forced to do so.  Better yet, I want somebody that actually cares..."

"event","It is ALMOST fall break.  I am ALMOST rid of my annoying 1st block teacher.  I'm very pissed off at him for reasons that could be  hinted at by the purple circles under my eyes.  It makes me sad when school starts because I can't wear purple anymore since it brings out those wonderful new features.  It's somewhat distressing.  I've pondered the subject of getting this makeup stuff I saw in a magazine that covers it, but no.  I am not a make-up-y kind of person.  I do not want to look like I've got a sandbox poured on my face like some people I know.  There was offense when I informed her, but seriously, I like to know when I look bad so I can remedy it.  I told my one friend that I was going to bring her a shovel and pail.  Now that would be a very hilarious thing, however, those two objects are not in my possession right now.
Today I saw a hot pink car in the parking lot and I decided that when I get my car it is going to be gorgey fab like that one.  Except I think I will paint it a bluey-royal purple or indigo or something.  I've been liking those colours lately.  This summer it was banana yellow.  I fluctuate with colours, I've noticed, but I still love good 'ole red the best!
Band rehearsal today went by very slowly.  It was an injury type of rehearsal too.  I ALMOST twisted my ankle but didn't luckily.  It was traumatizing.    
Well, I must continue with my incessant studying.  Oh yay. woo hoo... no"

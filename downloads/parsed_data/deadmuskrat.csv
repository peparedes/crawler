"event","Ok, so I had a weird experience last week that ties into my dream about the bird (it was the entry called ""It's Time to Leave the Esophagus."" I think it's the last one I did). You see, every morning i have the same breakfast: 2 poached eggs on 2 pieces of toast. This is a little sad to say but i think that this might be my favorite meal. I've always, even as a child, have loved breakfast. Especially eggs. Scrambled, poached, over-easy, sunny-side-up, deviled, you name it, I love it. If I'm at a Diner the Lunch and Dinner menus do not even exist.

""What are you getting? The Monte Cristo? That's nice. What am i getting? I'm still trying to narrow it down to one side of the breakfast menu. But you can be sure as shit it's gonna have eggs involved.""

OK, now that you know my affinity for eggs, let me get back to the story at hand. So I wake up last monday morning. Shower, get dressed, the usual. Then I go to the last part of my morning: Making breakfast. I throw some wheat bread into the old toaster oven. Go over and pull out the egg poacher and a dozen eggs from the fridge. Then I crack the first egg into poacher looked down in horror. There are two yolks in this egg. Now I've been eating eggs all my life and I run across this little defect (if anybody has a twin I am in no way calling you a defect. Not out right anyway) once in awhile. it always grosses me out. i guess it's because I'm then forced to associate this wonderful morsel with a living thing. It was one day going to be a grown chicken, or in this case 2, instead it's what I call breakfast. It's very rare that something like that bothers me. I dont eat veal because I just associate veal with cruelty even though all of the meat industry is sick. So that makes me a hypocrite. Atleast, that's what many bleeding heart hippies and vegans have told me. So I'm grossed out by this egg but I decide to allow it to continue on it's journey to become my breakfast. I crack the next egg and guess what? No, not that, you sicko! This one has 2 yolks too! How is this possible? i then decide to myself (out loud) that this is a sign. Of what though? That I have no idea. But I assure myself it's a sign of my imminent death. Cancer, I say. No association whatsoever between 2 double yolks, but that's what I came up with.

So you think this story would end here. With me making some stupid comment about how I have very little time left in this world. But the ext day only gave more questions. And the next day. Oh yeah, and the day after that one. And so on, and so on. You see, every single egg in this dozen was a double yolk. This made me not only grossed out everyday, but pissed off as well. Some deuschbag (sp?) hick farmer thought to himself, ""Hey, I'm gonna pack this whole dozen of eggs with double yolks so that som schmuck in NJ will think it's a sign of the apocalypse."" Well I'm here to say, well played Hick Farmer, Well played indeed. You had me for a sec. But I will have my day too. Don't be surprised if someday you wake up someday and your house, barn house, plow, and all that you hold dear is egged......WITH DOUBLE YOLK EGGS!!!!

Consider it my signature Hick Farmer."

"event","I went to a party outside of NYC this weekend. It wasn't a big party with people my age or anything. My friend, let's call him Mexically blue, We'll his sister just turned 20 and he and his family through a nice BBQ fiesta for all to enjoy. this might sound like a bust to some but I've known his family for some time now and they always know how to throw a nice bash. I ended up drinking all day and partaking in a couple rounds of Ping-Pong, or table tennis, or whatever name you like to give to that wonderful game.

The night ended with The biggest Pictionary game ever that went on till 5:00 am. this was a no joke game. I thought punches would be thrown. Mostly because my team kept getting out of line. It's a sad day when the Deadmuskrat has to be the voice of reason. I'd rather take a sip of your best wine, spit it back at your face all the while punting your dog or baby across the room (I prefer a baby, but I'll settle for a dog). That's just the type of party animal I am. Always the first to start the Congo Line or do a shot that consist of using somebody else's body part to consume. I'm the guy you want at the party. You need me there. But I had to be the stand up guy for team 1 this weekend. I had to put away my baby-punting urges to keep team 1 one from eating itself alive. I'm proud to say that Team 1 held it together and ended up the victors of this game they call Pictionary. Should have known better than to challenge an artist of my skill to a game like that. You'd think they would have learned by now.

Other than that, I'm glad I got out of the ol' HP this weekend. Another weekend of going out to the usual bars and coming back then listening to people have the most pointless and loaded conversation (and that's on a good night) would have left me curled up in the fetal position on the corner of my bed holding my ears wishing for it all to just ""go away."" I think I might be away next weekend too. So this fits into my plan at trying to go away every weekend. I'm going up to Albany to see a friend, we'll call him ""The Masked Dumper"". It's a long-story. The Masked Dumper just broke up with his psycho Girlfriend (redunant, i know...hehe). I wish to nurse him back to health with the soft bosom of a night of hard drinking. I will enjoy it. We'll see about him

I'll report if anything interesting happens till then. CHEERS"

"event","Ok, so last night I had a dream where a bird was either growing or nesting in my throat. I've always have had very vivid dreams all my life. Most of the time as time passes they start to smear into a technicolor mess to where I cant even start to communicate as to what I saw. But this one is sticking. I remember feeling something in my throat and going to look into a mirror. What I saw startled me as there was a bird leg protruding from the back of my throat. Most people would panic at this point but I was more curious. I reached back and twiddled it a little bit to see if it was in fact ""real."" It then moved. Then the panic set in. What am I gonna tell everybody?

""Do you here something chirping?""
""Oh that's just the bird that spontaneously grew in my throat. I call him Heimlich.""

This will not fly with everybody. Pun intended. So I do what any grown man would do. I reach into my throat and start trying to pull that little fucker out by his little twig leg. He (I assume it's a boy) is so burrowed into my throat that the first yank of his leg yields nothing but me pulling his leg off of his body. I examine it for a second and start imagining the pain this poor bird must be in now. Why isn't he thrashing around in pain. He's just chirping. The poor thing. Am i feeling guilty for a fucking bird that burrowed itself into my fucking throat? Fuck him! I then decide that the only way this guys coming out is if I throw up. So I sit there try to wretch this guy out. This is about the time that I wake up but I don't realize it. I'm kneeling over the side of my bed and I'm still gagging. Luckily I came to my senses and realized that there is no way that there is a bird in my throat.

I get up and check anyway. We're good.

I decided to research a little about this dream. A google later and it lead me to <link=http://www.dreammoods.com>this site</link>

It revealed this about Birds:

<i>To dream of a chirping and/or flying birds, represents joy, harmony, ecstasy, balance, and love. It denotes a sunny outlook in life. You will experience spiritual freedom and psychological liberation. It is almost as if a weight has been lifted off your shoulders.

To dream of dead or dying birds, foretells a period of coming disappointments. You will find yourself worrying over problems that are constantly on your mind.

To see a bird nest in your dream, symbolizes independence, refuge and security. You need something to fall back on. Alternatively, it may signify a prosperous endeavor, new opportunities, and fortune.</i>

Interesting. Now about throats:

<i>To see your throat in your dream, symbolizes the ability to express yourself and communicate your thoughts/ideas.

To dream that you have a sore throat, suggests that you are having problems saying what you really think. You may feel threatened when you express yourself. Alternatively, your dream may be telling you that you need to swallow your pride.

To see a nice and graceful throat in your dream, foretells of an advancement in your position.</i>

Is this dream telling me I have an inability to express my need for refuge? Discuss."

"event","Lately I have been driving my mind through the rocky hills of Coo-Coo mountain. I dont know what's going on but I seem to be sick & tired of everybody I know. See, I've always prided myself on my ability to empathize with people. When I'm confronted with problems I go through every possible angle to look at this person, situation, etc. I know most people think that they do the same but it's not always the case.

The people that I've been surrounding myself with lately have been killing every ounce of patience I have. They go about their life being these joyless entities that think things like living, laughing, or passion are passe. Come to think of it, everything is passe to them. All they do is sit around and think of new things to hate or tear down. You cant watch a show with out twenty comments about  how shitty this thing is or how stupid it is. Nothing is sacred to them. God forbid that somebody talks about something they actually like. Which you cant do. I have a better chance at getting  the walls of my room to listen to me instead of looking at me with  a blank stare as they think of their next ""witty"" comment. But when you reciprocate their witty banter they show you that that they have zero tolerance for humor that is directed at their life style. Then your frowned upon for not knowing the rules that they just made.

It's amazing to me that some people my age (which is 25) still judge something upon it's social standing. Never to give it a second thought.

Maybe I shouldn't let this get to me

Maybe I should just need to get laid

Maybe I shouldn't be writing all this. But then again, this will never be read by the people it refers to. Blogs are just plain uncool"

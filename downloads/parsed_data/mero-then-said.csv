"event","Persephone apparently decided to stop this ""making up"" that she had been trying to do. That woman...she was beautiful, yes, and a lovely piece to showcase. But as a wife, as one who is to keep her home and her husband's secrets within it, she failed miserably.

I considered giving her Cake. And refusing to comply afterwards.

She didn't understand the game, she didn't understand that I make the rules, I am perfectly in control of my own life and I don't need her to go about <i>fucking</i> things up for me.

I am speaking of her in past tense.

This can be explained.

Cause: <s>She failed to understand the game</s> <s>She was an insubordinate bitch</s> <s>She</s> I pushed her too far.
Effect: She left me.

Cause: <s>I do not care if she ever comes back</s> It pains me to speak of her.
Effect: I speak of her as though she is dead.

Cause: I have had sex with <s>one</s> three women in her absence.
Effect: In <s>showing</s> trying to show that I really don't give a damn, I'm causing more injury to myself.

Cause: I am <s>too proud</s> too afraid to cut myself.
Effect: I am drinking far too much.

Cause: Persephone left me. <s>That bitch.</s> <s>Good riddance.</s> This hurt me.
Effect: I am ranting to a thing that cannot comfort me about just how pathetic my life has gotten.

I will write her a letter tonight.

And send it tomorrow.

Using overnight mail."

"event","Persephone came to lie with me tonight. I did not understand why, as we have not slept with each other since our mutual betrayal. It is not that the loss of the Keymaker bothered me so much, it is that I never figured that she would -

Well.

Never mind.

The fact remains that she slept with me, her arm flung carelessly across my chest, and for the life of me I could not understand why. She had no reason to be with me, and there my confusion lies. My mind could only think that she wanted something, or that she was trying to take something from me.

Of course, the idea that she would stab me in my sleep crossed my mind as well, so I got up.

Paranoia, thy name is Merovingian. At least tonight.

Anyhow...as soon as I moved to stand up, she awoke. And it was one of the most beautiful things I had ever seen. Her eyelids fluttering, unsure, frosted with doubt - why wake up now, it is too early, it is the middle of the night - before lifting off of flushed cheeks to reveal large, beautiful eyes...the soft rush of air from slightly parted lips, before the utterance of ""My love, where are you going"" - always ""My love"", even when we are feuding.

""Persephone,"" I say to her, touching her face, ""why tonight?""

""Why tonight what?""

""Why do you lie with me and confuse me so?""

""I do not mean to confuse you, my love,"" she says unabashedly. ""I only mean to make up with you.""

""And if I will not have you?""

She sits up, arching her back, breasts rising and falling as she sighs. ""You would not have me, my love?"" And it is tragic. Tragic and painful, the way she looks at me.

""Perhaps I will not,"" I say, the words leaving before I have a chance to control them.

""Perhaps I will leave.""

""Perhaps you won't.""

""What makes you say that?"" she says coldly.

""You never do."" And with that, I lean down, kiss her on the forehead, and come in here to write. And of course, as soon as I come in here to forget her, I only write <i>about</i> her.

Tomorrow shall see if she is still here.

That woman will be the death of me."

"event","I believe my first memory would have to be coming into being. And...well, it was wonderful, like waking up from a long and satisfying sleep. I was not, and then I simply <i>was</i>, in my chateau in the mountains. 

Snow was coming down - it must have been early December. Yes, it was; we had a truly white Christmas that year. Although I never understood the meaning of Christmas, pointless commercial holiday that it has become. The air was biting into my lungs as I stepped outside, foolishly coatless, but I didn't care; I wanted to go down, to explore, even though I knew - yes, even then I knew! - what there was to find. And in the village down below there was the most lovely woman I had ever seen - and no, I do not believe that to be a premature assumption, even now, no matter what I may do.

Either way, she was beautiful, and we courted, even as I did what I was placed here to do. We were married, even as the first One died and the first Matrix crumbled around us and we retreated to the chateau to spend a beautiful summer in our own sort of limbo. (Yes, limbo <i>can</i> be beautiful, and I would suggest you not forget that any time soon.)

All of this, all of this and more kept in the back of my mind, safe there until I choose to take it out, dust it off and replay it. Perhaps I will share more someday. Perhaps I won't. <i>C'est la vie.</i>"

"event","Well, I figured, why the hell not?

<lj-cut>
How do you deal with your fears? That would depend on what the fear <i>is</i>. If it is something I can face alone, I face it, of course. If it is something that will kill me and is confronting me right then, I try to talk my way out of it, or run. And if it is something that is not staring me in the face, I have no reason to fear it, do I? The unknown has ceased to frighten me.

Why did you cry most recently? I don't cry.

What was the worst pain you've experienced? Mmm...physical or emotional? Physically, I haven't felt a lot. Emotional...Persephone's betrayal. Although that didn't hurt so much as it angered me.

What is the worst injury or illness you've experienced? Ha...injury to my ego, perhaps.

What do you most dread losing? My power, and my control

~

What is your worst nightmare? Being confined in a small, dark, damp space for hours on end...horrible, horrible.

Do you dream in color? Doesn't everyone?

Do you have recurring dreams? If so, what? No.

How do you keep bad dreams away? I've gotten to the point where I can control what dreams I have and what I do not...if I focus long enough on what I want to dream about, I dream about it.

~

Clothed or Naked? Naked, the body is a wonderful thing.

Loud or Quiet? Quiet. Loud noises annoy me so...

Rain or Snow? Snow - I love watching it come down and stick, white and fluffy and lovely. I don't get much of it during the day, as the restaurant is in the city, but at nights, in the chateau in the mountains...beautiful.

Happy or Sad? Sad, for I take my pleasure in beautiful things, and beautiful things are not made to last, whereas melancholy can be just as lovely at times and it will always stay.

Boots or Shoes? Shoes - boots are dreadful things.

Ant or Caterpillar? Caterpillar. They amuse me greatly.

~

What is your comfort food? Dark chocolate

When do you reach for it? When I am angry or upset

What textures do you like least? Anything that goes mushy under my fingers (it is simply disgusting) and anything that is coarse and grainy against my skin.

Which textures make you most want to reach out and touch? Silk feels nicest against my skin, although I love the feel of fine powder.

What scents do you like most? Wine that is aged just right, the woods after it rains, and powder against the scent of a woman.

What scents do you like least? Lilies give me headaches in the worst way.

~

Are you vain? Dreadfully so.

How important is your outward appearance? Extremely.

Do you notice how other people look and what they are wearing? Of course I do.

Describe your favourite outfit. Black silk suit, with a wine-red shirt underneath and a white tie.

~

When do you sleep (time of day)? At night, usually.

How many hours a day of sleep do you need? Technically, I don't need to sleep. Sleep is merely a formality, as so many things are nowadays.

What's your favourite position to sleep in? On my back

What do you wear to sleep? Nothing. I like the feel of silk sheets against my skin

Do you like a lot of covers, or a few, or none at all? That would depend on what time of year it is, as generally fewer or none are preferred during the summer.

~

Who (or what) do you live for? I live for myself, and the beautiful things in life.

Who (or what) would you die for? I would not sacrifice my life for anything.

In general, what do people think of you upon first impression? That I am an arrogant bastard with a heavy accent.

What do people think of you after they get to know you better? That I am an arrogant bastard with a heavy accent whose ass they should probably kiss.

If you were to die right now, today, what kind of legacy would you leave behind? It is not in my place to leave a legacy behind. I do what I am here to do.

~ 

Do you like children? No.

Do you have children? No. Thank God.

Do you want to have children? Of course not.

What is your earliest childhood memory? As I had no childhood to speak of, I suppose my earliest memory would have to be coming into being. And how many can say they remember <i>that</i>? It was during the first Matrix, a ""perfect world"", according to the humans. It was beautiful. I believe it was their ""Eden"". Unfortunately...we all know what happened to it.

Who was your favourite person when you were a child? Persephone, although the question in inaccurate, as again, I had no childhood.

Name one thing that made it clear to you that were no longer a child. How old were you at the time? The end of the first Matrix was my first revelation, that nothing perfect is meant to last.

~

Can you ride a horse? I have never tried.

Can you drive? Yes. Badly.

Can you swim? I could if I had to. However, I despise being wet.

Can you fly? Unfortunately not.

Can you fight? I have never had to, so probably not...

Can you lead? Quite well.

~

Would you rather...

Eat an endless amount or photosynthesize? Eat. I enjoy eating.

Hold your breath indefinitely or make yourself turn blue? I would prefer holding my breath, thank you.

Learn sign language or talk without moving your lips? Sign language is beautiful.

Keep your eyes open without blinking or be able to turn off your hearing? My, turning off my hearing would be wonderful.

Fly or walk through solid matter? Fly, as I have my Twins to walk through solid matter for me.

Live forever and stay young or be reincarnated with your old memories? Live forever and stay young. But it's not as though I have much of a choice, do I? I have yet to die, and I have been alive for thousands upon thousands of years.</lj-cut>"

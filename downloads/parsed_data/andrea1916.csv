Sam came along and when we were driving there, my mom and her friend were waving at a bunch of guys and idk... it was crazy... then, we got there and went to the Breaking Benjamin concert... it was AWESOM!!!! so we were standing on the bleachers and all the sudden someone tapps me on the back and says 'hey, can you scoot down alittle so my friend can stand up there' so i scooted and thank god he was there, because the moshpit formed right next to us and everyone was like fighting... then he got pulled into it, kind of, and if he wasn't there, that could have been me... then me and sam fell down off of the bleachers! it was psycho, and the people behind us (the guy's friends) kept falling on us... it was so funny... when 'so cold' came on i went crazy. sam was headbanging and falling all over the place!!! then the concert ended and we said good bye to 'the dude' and then we went around in search of band t-shirts... we found 'em and i bought a breaking benjamin tank top and a cheap trick shirt. then we tried to find the briggs & stratton stage to see cheap trick and we wound up about 6 rows back with this big, harly dude standing behind us that wouldn't let us stand on the bleachers but he loosened up and we stood up there... 2 songs in, he was up there too... so later on in the show, i got a little bored so i decided to try to get to the front and whattaya know.. it worked!!! WE WERE FRONT ROW AT THE CHEAP TRICK CONCERT, BABY!!! AND WE GOT GUITAR PICKS!!! people are so nice these days, because everyone was letting us go where we wanted to and they were giving us stuff so it was cool, then the show ended and there was an encore at the encore! yay! lol so the concert ended and we were standing by some hottubs and these 2 guys walked up to us and one (maybe drunk) were like 'hey, you gurls are about 17 hey?' and we looked at him shocked and told him we were 13 they felt so stupid!!! haha so then we left and as we were exiting the gates, we turned to our side and guess who was there... the guy from the breaking benjamin concert! yay! sam got his screen name on about the 6th time, but all is well... that was a blast, ttyl, andrea"

"event","In my last post (over a year ago) I said who know where I'll be the next time around.  Well since then, the interview I talked about went fantastically well, so I now find myself working Washington, DC, for the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  Such a culture shock from the cornfields of Iowa, but indeed, a good one.  I've been in the DC area for a little over a year now, and I really love it out here.

Spring is finally on its way, and the Cherry Blossoms are out in full force right now.  I'll be down there this weekend, so maybe if I think of it, I'll post some pictures.  Otherwise, summer will be here before I know it, and I'll be flying to Iowa a couple time for 4 weddings, to Canada for work, and to Romania for a missions trip with my church.  It's going to be a crazy summer that will just fly right on by (and luckily I'll be away while most of the tourists descend upon the area!)."

"event","Well, I guess I haven't updated this thing since October when the Yankees were losing.  I'm still miffed about that one.  Well, I've started a new job, had an interview for another, and I leave for New York City in less than a week for another interview.  So, who knows where I'll be next time I update this thing."

"event","I guess I should introduce myself, since this is my first entry.  My name is Jenny, and I just graduated from Iowa State University.  I'm still looking for that perfect job, and everyday it looks to be further and further away.  My degree is in journalism, but I'd really love to work in publishing as an editor.  I'm a huge baseball fan (which you'll read more about later).  I've been very involved in 4-H since I was in 5th grade, and this summer, and possibly this year, I'll get to direct the Iowa 4-H Technology Team!!  It's a great job, so I'm excited to do it while I continue the job hunt.

Well, the Yankees have gone and done it.  Being the huge Yankee fan that I am, I still can't believe they blew a 3-0 lead.  Oh well, one less week of baseball to obsess over.  Still, to lose to Boston, in the 7th, and in a terrible game.  I wonder what they were thinking--they were out-hit and out-pitched.

Well, enough of my ranting (if you are even still reading)."

"event","this is a b-o-r-i-n-g day, kahit na toxic din mamaya. so, i'm in school now, doing practically nothing because it's computer class and the topic is on internet. eh ano ang ginagawa sa internet???mag-email, gumawa ng assignments, mag-research at mag-search ng something else (lol). anyway, nursing's okay, pero and tanging complain ko lang as of now, i can't cope up with the practical side of the job. yn yung duties sa hospital, hndi ko magawa ng tama yung vital signs ang asepsis and stuff. grabe, kahapon was the first time that we handled REAL patients. as in ito yung 86 y/o na matanda who can't eat through the mouth and has to be fed through a feeding tube, unconcious pero hndi coma. zoinks, para kang kumuha ng BP ng stick. men, humihiwalay a ata yung bones niya sa laman eh. and to think ang kanyang BP ay umaabot ng 200/90. Exage. oh well, i think i am now trying to internalize that nursing is different from what i perceived. it's really the application of dedication to a vocation and not merely working for a job. it's not the money, rather it is the service that you can give. and my God, it is HARD. but i'm not complaining, it's just that i need an outlet of what i feel right now, dahil nawiwindang ako hanggang ngayon. i know that hard things are yet to come, and so i have to make it good right now to be really adjusted and be able to manipulate theories so that they would be very useful to me. it's more of the learning + the application."

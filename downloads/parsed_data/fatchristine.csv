"event","i am so happy that it is the summer cookout season again!! Man I just love this time of the year when I can crash family reunions and fourth of july picnics down in the park n'at and I can feast on so many baked beans that I can refill an entire serving bowl if I hold it under my ass. 

I won't play no sports though, you know how some times people want to do that at cookouts? I used to play softball but that was back when i only weighed 325 pounds. There is just not enough room in my hands to hold a bat on account of all the donuts I be fisting on a constant basis.

Oh man I am happy for another reason to. Trashy got a new job. It's at a real restrant this time, not a bar, so now I have an entire menu of food and DESSERT to choose from instead of just french fries and wing dings. NOT THAT THOSE ARENT GOOD. Because they are. BUt sometimes I'm really trying to get a free chicken quesadilla and a pool of ranch dressing to dip my fries in and some bowls of cream of potatoe soup and a quadruple decker five cheese burger (which is only supposed to be two deckers with one cheese but Trashy hooks me the f*uck UP!!!) and then their is an entire desert menu which i sample every night when i am up there visiting Trashy.

Today at work, I was trying to take blood from this kid and he had a stain on his shirt. It was fresh too and all I had to do was take one small wiff to know that it was a Klondike bar. I thought I was going to die of hunger at that point because it had been FIFTEEN MINUTES since my last snack. My mom says growing girls need to constantly feed there bodies and you know what? I know everything my mom says is wise just like when she told me a LONG TIME AGO not to trust that damn WHORE Erin who I THOUGHT was my friend."

"event","Oh shoooot. Last night was like one of the greatest adventures ever. Me and Trashy decided to pick with this BITCH that I known since grade school. I mean, this girl is such an asshole because she has a boyfriend and a baby and like, friends and she goes to a real college and not just a community one like the one I went to and she just thinks she is so fuckin' awesome because of that shit.

And also she broke up our friendship six years ago for like NO REASON other than I would get mad cuz she would spend some time with her boyfriend. Um hello!? I was her BFF. one night we were supposed to watch smallvill together. It was in its first season and we both liked it so i thought that made our friend ship stronger right? Come to find out that she decided to go to a haunted house with her BOYFRIEND instead of watching smallville with me and i had even switched shifts at the grocery store with someone to make it happen!!!!

granted, i never actually TOLD her that i wanted to hang out that night but we wathced the series premiere together and in Best Freind World that automatically means that we were supposed to watch every single episode togther. Anyone who has a friend knows that!!

I would always try and hang out with her as much as possible because as long as i was there, there would not be any sex-havin'. I know that they would find ways to still get it done and every time I think about it, I feel like vessels are bursting in my head. She should have been having sex with ME!

I mean, no! Sex is bad!!! It's for filthy people. 

So Trashy, who just so happens to be the boyfriends ex wife!!!!!, and i got in my car and i brought like, three cartons of eggs but damn I only ate ten zebra cakes and eight buttermilk pancakes with Caro syrup and nine links of sausage and four bottles of mountain Dew and one slurpee and two Whoppers and eighteen Slim Jims so I was STARVING on the fifteen minute drive to her house.

I ended up cracking open all the eggs and slurpin' them down with my Slurpee!!

Since we didn't have any eggs, instead we decided to just laugh and blow the horn and then I was like, ""Oh man we should tag her sidewalk!"" so Trashy and I put our heads together and after many minutes of heavy thinking, we decided to write ""Trashy was here"" because that would proly scare those two sex-havin' people!

Oh, and now I know that they definetly had sex at least once because they have a baby!

SICKENING!"

"event","Today I was hangin out with Taneesha and Chongniqua when the Ice Cream Man came rollin' around and damn did I get excited. Taneesha and Chongniqua of course did not have any money so they tried to barter with pieces of there weaves and dime bags but i on the other hand am always hoarding money under my third roll so I pulled out a twenty and was prepared to go to town. But the Ice Cream Man did not slow down when he came up on the corner we were chillin at! 

Now, I am sorry but I love those ice cream bars that have the crispy chocolate pieces all over them and the fudgey centers (those remind me of my ex boyfriends underwear stains and YUM I love to sniff that shit) and I also like Klondikes because they remind me of my trashy friend who I get my drink on with and I also am known for inhaling my share of rocket pops too, even though they are not coated with eighteen layers of fudge and fat.

So i did what any other 567 pounder would do -- I stepped into the street and stood in the Ice Cream Man's path. I put a large dent in his fender and tore a chunk of blubber off one of my thirteen love handles, but it was worth it. 

Tonight I am hanging out with my friend who has twins and we are going to listen to Garth Brooks and stcik pins in voodoo dolls that we make for people who have better lives than us!"

"event","i spent more time with my friends TWINS. They really like me a lot. I will sit on the couch and they come over and latch onto to my chin-fat and hang there like monkeys swinging on a chandeleir. See, I have like, an entire extra face under my chin, so there is a lot to grab on to. Some times when I am writing my poetry I will clip fishing weights onto it and pretend like i am a sideshow freak. 

I feel really bad tho cuz when I am over my friends house, her couch is not wide enough to account for my girth and I some times find myself sliding right off it onto the floor below! This would not be to bad except that ever since she done went and had those twins, some times one of them will ON THE FLOOR when I land and I end up using there head as a cushion. It is usually Idaho's head that I land on and now his head is oddly mishapen and his mom does not know why -- she thinks that he is may be loosing weight in his head and it is sinking in. I am going to let her beleive that one for now because she always has hersehy kisses available at her house and I have a feeling she might dangle those in front of my face and then not let me have any and I will not get to close to her because what if i accidently bump into her big boobs!! I am a GIRL and she is a GIRL and that would be sickening.

Rogaine is OK though. His head is long like the grandpa on the simpsons but at least it doesn't have dents in it.

I went out with Trashy for St Paddy's Day!! I forgot all about that. I kept saying all nite that I was going to write a poem about it. Anyway she had just come out of rehab and I thought it would be nice to celebrate even tho she tried to say no at first b/c she is an alcoholic but all i had to do was cry and threaten to not cart her licence-less ass around town no more!

We had lots of fun. I was prolly at my funniest that night and you know how funny i am on a regular day!! Imagine me with a traffic cone on my crotch, chasing old women up the road! Then toss in me fake-stealing an almost-stranger's convertible and times it by 7896382946! If you don't know the answer, it's because you didn't waste 7 years going to college for a math degree just to become a phlebtomist!"

"event","My doctor told me today that i need to loose weight and that I should make it my priority but I am a lottery winner. I have things like economy sized boxes of Ding Dongs to eat.

But then I started thinking about last year when I played Santa at the Kmart and the manager told me that I had bypassed a jolly bowl of jello a long time ago and had instead become a health hazard for the children, after one small child became trapped in my lap and both of her parents had to tug her out from under my belly's overhang.

I don't want to loose weight though. It is going to be hard and I will not be able to spend as much time debating over what to dump on top of my twenty-scoop banana split: Bacon-wrapped macademia nuts or fried chocolate-covered gumdrops.

Oh well. I have to go over my best friends house now. We are going to chain smoke and drink vats of vodka but we wont get drunk because we are professional drinkers. 

And we're both very fat."

"event","Oh Internet Diary, 

I am sorry that I haven't been able to record my log of ding dongs devoured and pig fat guzzled, but I have been a prisoner to my couch since Thanksgiving, when I ate so much at Thanksgiving that the springs underneath gave out and sprung forth, enclosing me in their spiraled jaws. 

Since I am a big time lotto winner, I have a top of the line laptop, but it has been wedged under my quadruple buttocks all this time! Thank god my friend came to visit me a lot with her two little boys. They are the loves of my life! They usually have crumbs adhered to honey-coated fingers and I suck it off like a vacuum on a bed of pine needles. 

Another unfortunate downside to my accident is that I missed out on playing Santa at the mall for the second year in a row! Last year it was because I didn't have a natural beard but since I've been taking hormones I have a nice furry coat hugging my cheeks. The hormones are also doing curious things to my pubic hair, which has been buried beneath mounds of cellulite and gelatin for years now, but when my mom and brother were bathing me, my brother called up some of his friends and they united with a band of crow bars to pry up the layers so mom could wedge a sponge in there and unclog the toilet paper shavings and shitballs. That is when mom petted me affectionally down there (for the first time since I was nearly eight!) and announced that my pubic hair had flourished into what resembled a toupee crafted of porcupine quills.

But now I have a new laptop so I can write about my food adventures and split seams with more frequency."

"event","Oh diary, I can't believe that I forgot to write about the birthday party I went to. It was for TWO boys and they are TWINS and oh my, diary, you should have seen the real life tears that I shed as each child dropped CAKE onto the floor. Perfectly good CAKE, being wasted right in front of me. I will not lie, nay, I CAN not lie; I ate some of that cake from the floor, I did. I waited as their mother walked away and I scooped up an oozing wad with two of my fat fingers that I pressed together to form a flesh-fork and I stuffed it into my mouth and oh the glory, oh the passion that filled my loins when that sugary icing rolled down my throat, past the hoagie and pizza that I had been storing inside my cheeks. I grabbed my cup of ice cream and washed it down and then I wiped my face with a fistful of potato chips and oh diary, it was so delicious and I was delerious with The Happy and then I went home and wished I had a man to fuck my fatty thighs but alas my sometimes boyfriend Lenny with his cratered cheeks and red dandruffed hair was too busy bleaching out blood and stool from the linens at his job and so instead I pulled out my Extra Queen Sized vibrator that I bought at my friend's Sex Toy Party (I go to these because I am too cool not to and also because there, I am not the fattest one) and in my energenic and boisterous fervor, I lost that thing within my fatty walls and then I had to go to the firestation and have my friend Keane remove it!

But damn, that cake was so good. I think I ate some of the one kid's skin too when I mistook his leg for a piece of chicken straight off the spit."

"event","I'm so excited that I didn't die today of a stroke or heart attack. I hear that these are maladies that can fall upon someone of my extreme obesity. I also didn't accidentally sit on any small rodents or medium-sized livestock today which is also very good and wow, what a relief, you know? There was this one time when I was over my friend Sherry's house and nearly crushed the skull of her small child with the weight of my ankle alone. 

Tonight I am going to the bar where my friend Trash works. She pumps me full of free drinks to help increase my blood pressure, but it makes me loose in case any of the men there get beer goggles and want to feel me up. I can'tdrink TOO much because I then it makes it harder for me to hold up the folds around my vagina and they will get lost.

Boy, I can't wait to hear the stories that Trash will have to share with us bar flies tonight. She is so wordly! She has been to flea markets all over the country and she knew about Gabes before it became cool  to shop there. I learn so much from her, like how to carry cocaine on my person without anyone knowing (I keep it in Trash's empty oxycontin bottle and then wedge it between my eight butt cheeks). 

So, my mom is just about done sewing me an outfit to wear tonight. I can only wear an outfit once and then I have to be cut out of it at the end of the day because the fabric gets sucked under my flab and sometimes it chafes me too hard when I try to pull it off in one piece."

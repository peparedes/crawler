 So much for my happy ending
 oh oh, oh oh
 So much for my happy ending
 Oh Oh,Oh Oh, Ohhhhh
 
 Let's talk this over
 It's not like we're dead
 Was it something I did?
 Was it something you said?
 
 Don't leave me hangin'
 In a city so dead
 Held up so high
 On such a breakable thread (breakable thread)
 
 You were all the things I thought I knew
 And I thought we could be
 
 chorus
 You were everything, everything that I wanted
 We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it, but we lost it
 All the memories, so close to me, just fade away
 All this time you were pretending
 So much for my happy ending
 
 Oh Oh, Oh Oh
 So much for my happy ending
 Oh Oh,Oh Oh, Oh huh
 
 You've got your dumb friends
 I know what they say
 They tell you I'm difficult
 But so are they
 But they don't know me
 Do they even know you?
 All the things you hide from me
 All the sh*t that you do,
 All the sh*t that you do
 
 You were all the things I thought I knew
 And I thought we could beeeeee
 
 chorus
 You were everything, everything that I wanted, everything that I wanted
 We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it, but we lost it
 All the memories, so close to me, just fade away
 All this time you were pretending
 So much for my happy ending
 
 It's nice to know that you were there
 Thanks for acting like you cared
 And making me feel like I was the only one
 It's nice to know we had it all
 Thanks for watching as I fall
 And letting me know we were done
 
 He was everything, everything that I wanted
 We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it
 All the memories, so close to me, just fade away
 All this time you were pretending
 So much for my happy ending

"event","well, Aileen and I were talking about this back in the day.  You know how Shakira's video for ""Whenever, Wherever"" features her rolling in the mud?  well, back then i was just like whateverer, she's weird....  music videos are weird.  little did i know what her next video would be like.  has anyone seen ""La Tortura""?  This one features her literally spreading tar (yes, tar) all over her body.  What is up with that girl?!?!?!?"

i'm so freaking busy the next week.  i have my permit test, three meets, STAR testing, AP test, SAT 2, an all day dance festival, and an orchestra concert that i can't go to.  

i'm kinda worried about my Spanish AP test.  i have been studying a lot, but i'm not doing too well on the practice tests.  hopefully *crosses fingers* i will get at least a three.  and good luck to everyone else taking AP tests and SAT's!!!!"

"event","so i had an ok weekend.  on friday and saturday i babysat, so i made mucho dinero.  lol.  then on saturday night i was at target with my mom, and i hear someone shout ""there she is!""  i look over and there is tara and wendy.  they were to there to pick me up to see miss congeniality 2.

note:this is the first movie i have seen since meet the fockers, which i saw in january.  lol.  i don't really like going to the movie theater anymore because it is so expensive.  i'd rather just rent movies and only go to the theater for really good ones.

anyone, the movie was really good, as sequels go.  it was really funny.  also, i just finished watching the passion of the christ.  people, don't see it.  it is so sad and gruesome. i had to close my eyes for like ten minutes, and i was watching the edited version.  very touching though."

"event","so the past two days have been awesome.  thursday most of you have heard about, i won't go into detail here but feel free to ask me to spill all my juicy details of tara and alicia's ultimate day of fun.  lol.

yesterday was actually surprisingly fun taking the bus to valleyfair.  tara met us there later.  it was pretty fun except for the ""white trash"" guy.....i guess i should tell the story.

so the three of us were walking through the mall, and this guy stops us saying something about how he has to talk to thirty nice and pretty girls to become a dj or something rather.  then he has us come over and says he needs two minutes.  well, i thought we were just gonna have to sign something saying he talked to us or something, but next thing you know he takes out this brochure full of magazines that he wants us to buy.

well, tara says that she has to go the bathroom and leaves (smart girl) while laura decides she wants to get teen people.  well, she starts filling out the form and it turns out it's 16 bucks plus 8 dollars shipping and handling...wth?

well we told him that we didn't have enough money, but he knew i had 6 bucks.  he complained about how he only needed a few more points and that the last girl gave him like a hundred bucks.  he said he just wanted the six bucks and he would donate the rest to buy some kid's magazine.  so i gave it to him...i know-it was a mistake.  tara was pretty mad about it too lol.

well all in all these past two days have been awesome...hopefully today wil be too."

then she started talking about how we are so alike and would probably be friends if we went to the same school, and that all her friends have big boobs so i would fit in.  that just weirded me out.  all in all she seems pretty nice though."

The sad thing is after all of these years of hate and despise.....all those feelings went away with these few simple words, ""You look cute today.""

Is it sad that I have denied a friendship with her for all of these years simply because of the childish and mean way she acted towards me in sixth grade, five years ago?  If I hadn't held a grudge on her, would we be friends today?

Well I guess I shouldn't venture to say we are friends now, but I really don't hate her.  I don't know why I ever did.  She really isn't mean, and my whole perception of her was based on a few measly comments she said to me five years ago.  Just had to get this off my chest...."

don't see raise your voice.  it's not worth your money.  or at least its worth the $3.50 we paid for it.  so i finally got to sleep in this morning....nice.

 So much for my happy ending 
 oh oh, oh oh, oh oh... 
 
 Let's talk this over 
 It's not like we're dead 
 Was it something I did? 
 Was it something you said?
 
 Don't leave me hangin'
 In a city so dead 
 Held up so high 
 On such a breakable thread 
 
 You were all the things I thought I knew 
 And I thought we could be 
 
 chourus 
 You were everything, everything that I wanted 
 We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it 
 And all of our memories, so close to me, just fade away 
 All this time you were pretending 
 So much for my happy ending 
 So much for my happy ending
 
 You've got your dumb friends 
 I know what they say 
 They tell you I'm difficult 
 But so are they 
 But they don't know me 
 Do they even know you? 
 All the things you hide from me 
 All the shit that you do 
 
 You were all the things I thought I knew 
 And I thought we could be 
 
 chourus 
 
 It's nice to know that you were there 
 Thanks for acting like you cared 
 And making me feel like I was the only one 
 It's nice to know we had it all 
 Thanks for watching as I fall 
 And letting me know we were done 
 
 chourus X 2 
 
 So much for my happy ending
 So much for my happy ending

deadline-end of november at the latest.

so some of you might want to know why i am updating my livejournal at 6:30 in the morning.  in short, i woke up at 5:15 and couldn't get back to sleep, so what better to do than blog?

yesterday was pretty interesting.  short day, afterschool walked to tara's house.  listened to the song that SHE WROTE.  it's so good!  i'm so proud of you tara my up and coming artist!  i will definitely go to your shows and stuff when you get famous.

then had to walk back to school for tara's band practice....depressing as hell.  i hate being in the orchestra room when all the band geeks are there (no offense).  it was just sad that during vacation, all these people in band were at school to practice.....early.

then my mom drove laura and i to la salsa.  their burritos really are spicy!  it was kind of nasty.

after my cello lesson, i went back to the library with tara, laura, and nick to wait for dusty.  he never showed up.

an interesting thing happened there,  well i was leaning pretty far back in those  chairs, and it kinda fell.  as tara says, and i agree, it was funny until my head hit the table behind me.  really hard.  it hurt so bad.  well nick and tara were pretty worried that i had a concussion, so nick took his little flashlight and shined it into my pupils.  verdict:i didn't have a concussion.  but that didn't stop it from hurting like hell.

i seriously couldn't get up for like 5 minutes.  i was just sitting there on the ground.  nick was freaking me out cuz i was resting my head down cuz it hurt so much, and he's all like don't go to sleep you might not wake up.

of course when we went to downtown mountain view, tara and laura insisted on running across the street, which of course i couldn't do bc of my stupid head.

well now i guess it feels better.  i don't really have a headache anymore, but i have a pretty big bump on the back of my head.  everyone time it touches something it hurts.  i had to be pretty careful with my pillow.

that's pretty much all that happened yesterday.  i'm so excited for the weekend though!  and no homework!! yay!"

school sucks.  all my teachers have piled on tests and projects before the 4-day weekend.  at least that will be aa nice break.  i spent the week at home, working on my hw.  fun stuff.

yesterday i hung out with tara, nick, and aileen.  i love it when we hang out with aileen cuz she's always so busy.  my little rant:laura wore the shoes that i lent her for homecoming to school.  Laura, can i have my money and my shoes?  and my swimsuits and my cd?  tara can i have my $42?

Nick-$4
Sher-$.50

Owe me:
Laura-$9
Wendy-$10
Tara $13

if they pay me back, i can pay back the people that i owe.  and i have $16 left in my account.  :(  i have a hilarious story for today.  So you know how there was a stanford football game against usc today?  well my dad and i were on our way to stanford mall.  at this one stoplight, there was an RV next to us with a USC flag on it.  two guys inside got out of it and ran all the way around it.  it was pretty funny.  Then, two stoplights later, 6 or 7 of them get out, run around the RV, and get back in.  it was hilarious.

so after ditching sephora for lying to us, (long story)  we went to bloomingdale's for makeup and trying dresses.  weird that most of the ones i like were jessica mcclintock and about the same style (strapless, silky, and floor length.)  after that, we took the bus to tower, and hung out their until nick came to pick us up.  his mom's cadillac is soooo cool!! 

I convinced nick to take us to valleyfair, cuz i wanted to buy a powder brush at bare escentuals.  it was $23.  i feel like i was ripped off. i'm contemplating returning it, but i guess a good makeup brush is good, and the one i have now is pretty crappy.  dinner at panda express, then meet mark at barnes and noble.

spent a little while there, then realized that my shoes were killing me.  now i remember why i hardly ever wear my pumas.  after many pleas of nick carrying me to the car, i finally made it, and we all piled in to wendy's.  i had a chocolate milkshake-so good.  nick decided he was tired, so we all headed home.  laura to my house, to use the comp for a little while before heading back."

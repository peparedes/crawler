"event","ok, long time,lots to update.  Winter break was cool, went to Rhode Island to visit my father and all my old freinds, mucho fun. 

<b>Day 1:</B> watched the new year change with my dad

<b>Day 2:</b> Went to see Hannah/ the Larges first, She's still really tiny, lol. Then i went to see Gunther and his family, Casey ""his daughter"" has really grown, makes you feel like you've missed alot. Went to my old house/Jessica and Keith's house before going to Kenyon's ""one of my best freinds up there"". So i went to his house and played some video games and went driving around,  went to my old mall, no one left, no surprise. 

<b>Day 3:</b> Went to Randy's house, this is my bestfreind up there, all of my child hood memories were with this kid, we did all the good old stuff, bought nachos and shot random stuff in the back yard, it was fun to see him again. 

<b>Day 4:</b> Went to Kenyon's again, and to the mall again, met his girlfreind, complete bitch, really wish he would dump her, hate to see my freinds get used.

<b>Day 5:</b> Went to the Mystic Aquarium, fucking penquins rock, got to pet the sting rays and see a sea lion show, they were cool.

<b>Day 6:</b> Just sat around the house watching movies, playing pool, playing ""Spyro"" and preparing for the next day..

<b>Day 7:</b> Took the long drive to New Hampshire, to Loon mountain, to go snowboarding, most fun i have had in awhile, fell down 75% of the mountain before deciding i needed a refresher course, but after that i got my skills back. Went into the lodge at one point to warm up/eat and when i stepped back outside went into shock, my nose was bleeding and i was shaking uncontrollably, def going to buy more appropriate gear for next time, but i did rent a sick Burton board, i loved it.

<b>Day 8:</b> got packed and ready to go to the airport, stopped at Bickfords (denny's"")before leaving for the airport, said my fairwells to my Dad and his girlfreind (Charleen) and left for the plane.

Got home and chilled for about 30 min. before calling Krista to go do something, went to see ""White Noise"" and go to ""Denny's"", i missed her while i was gone, good to see her again. Same old shit since then, got stuck in an all freshie class just because i failed Algebra 1 last year, w/e, i'll just do it this year. That's about it, See you later space cowboys....."

"event","long time without updating, lets see what i remember. At bake sale i was trying to hint to Sarah that i liked her, figured she got the hint, so i asked her out a couple days later, she doesn't want a relationship right now, wasn't so bad, she didn't freak out and stop talking to me or anything. Pig got suspended for having his new pyrex with him, it was pretty too, so him and I walked to Flashbacks on friday, stoped by the mall and saw Jesus, Kasper, and Moses. Cool to see them again, they have some good stories from The Gathering and getting there. So after that we headed to Flashbacks and he spent like an hour trying to pick out a decent peice for under $25, he's a horrible person to shop with. Ended up getting a nice little glass peice and taking the bus back. Headed over there later on that night, and smoked for the first time in a loooong time, it was nice. Saw Vanessa with her boyfreind and chilled with them for a little bit, got to talking to her boyfreind, Justin, come to find out, he knows most of freinds, and his room mate is dating on of em, small world. On Saturday I went to Krista's place and she was playing chess with Larry and Andrew, she didn't seem to happy that he was there. No worries, we went on with our plan of going to see ""Oceans Twelve"", just added a person to the scenario. Dropped Larry off around 10:30 and randomly drove and talked for hours like we always do, good times. Went to the mall on Sunday, saw a bunch of people, saw Josh and met his girlfreind, all these people in relationsahips is depressing, ended up walking with him and her to their neighborhood and chillin for a little bit, we dropped her off and I introduced Josh to Justin and his crew that always chills in front of his garage. We had a vomit contest induced by chugging warm water, damn we're losers. Thats about it. See you later space cowboy..........."

"event","Bake sale was the illest,  I got to see some people i haven't seen in awhile, like: Greg, John, Heather, Chip, Jackie, Judy, Angel, Justin, Bronson, Ashley (both of em), Tori, Tony, Sarah, Shelby, Erica, and a bunch of my moshing buddies.  First show i saw when i was there was lit, it was ok but not to great. Next was Kotton Mouth Kings, GREAT pits to KMK, nothing like a bunch of people beating the crap out of other fans just to let some anger out.  Next was Skindred, Never moshed on a hill before, but it was fun, there was this little 8 year old kid in there with a broken arm and a gash in his side moshing, we picked him up over the whole crowd because he's the most hardcore mofo in the whole venue.  Went to see Presidents Of The USA at some point, that show kicked ass, ""moving to the country, gunna eat me lots of peaches"", yes!, After that i chilled in the seats and watched the Lost Prophets, they are ok, i was just happy to sit down somewhere. After that i went to see Taking Back Sunday with greg, he listened to them while i moshed, Taking Back Sunday fans are pussy's, there were only like 4 people in the pit until some shirtless guy and me started grabbing people and forcing them in, eventualy got punched in the ribs too many times and left for a little, Then i tryed to push myself up to the front, that is like trying to run wearing cement block on your feet, it's not gunna happen.  So i just stood there helping people get up so they can crowd surf. I lost my hoodie somewhere in the crowd so i waited till everyone left to try and find it, i did, when i came there it was black, when i found it it was a light brown. Then we headed back to the seats using our ninja skill and smart thinking. Saw New Found GLory, they aren't half bad live, we sat around in the seats until Korn came on. That is one of the coolest things i have ever seen, everyone stood up and started screaming, and they only played one bad song and the rest were all their old ones, my throat hurts from singing along. After Korn we left, or tryed to. I went there with Mike, Jen, and Sasha. so we call Mikes dad and he said he's at gate 8. we were at gate 12. so we walk for about 30 min trying to find this gate and end up back at 12. we end up hopping a fence int othe antique show and wandering around there, setting for a teen horror movie. Eventually Security in a golf cart chases us down and gives us directions out. and we hop in the car. It was a pretty good day. I didn't get to see Christine, i really was looking forward to seeing her, but i did get to see alot of other peopple i hadn't seen in forever, like Judy and Tori. i'll update later.

"event","lets see, yesterday was random and fun, I skipped school like always and headed to the mall around 4, found Kelly and Dana, chilled with them for awhile, eventually found Travis, Diane, Katie, Christina, Bubble butt, and Donny.  It was funny to see Donny, a kid that acts all hardcore gangster bitching about how he lost his kitten for only like 2 min.  I met this chemist at the mall, and if you know me, you know this was def a very big highlight in my day, because chemist can make lysergic acid dyethamide the right way, that should lead to immense amounts of fun in the future.  Hopped the 6:00 bus over to Krista and Kellys place to see what was crackalackin over there, Kelly had to go inside and watch the kids so she didn't chill long. Krista and I went to IHOP and shared some chocolate chip pancakes, it was good.  After that we headed to West Palm to get cake flavored ciggarettes, eventually found Headquarters through the maze of closed streets and slow city traffic.  We went in there and looked at bowls, found a pretty metal piece, mostly black with a clear lime green chamber, and we bought the cake ciggs. Trying to get back to Boynton we take one to many wrong turns and end up lost. So we drive for like 30 min trying to find our way out of this place and end up at a dead end where a cop is pulling some chick over, so we turn around, went down a street that lead us right back to the dead end but this time the cops car was off and the person getting pulled over car was one but no lights, go piggy gettin some ass for not writing a ticket.  gound our way back to spankys and eventually to I-95. Went to wallgreens and bought gum, soda, and batteries so Krista can kelly kelly kelly when she gets home. lol. Headed back to Kellys to see if she could do anything, and ended up trying to see a movie, since when do movies close at 10:30?  so we walked to the bowling alley and played arcade games for awhile, Kelly beat Krista at air hockey and we played judge dredd, Krista isn't very good with a gun. lol. After the bowling alley we walked to Blockbuster and rented SLC punk because neither of them had ever seen it. Dropped Kelly off at home cuz she has a curfew. Krista and I went back to my haous and watched SLCP, I don't think she liked it, eh ya win some ya lose some.  We might dye her hair blue today, not sure if it will happen.  Some where in there i fucked up my ankle. Thats about it, see you later space cowboy......."

Zack showed up with news that Uncle Cid was back in town so that made me a very happy camper.  Ended up at Quarter Deck saturday night with Roger, Bernie, Andrea, Vanessa, Cristina, Jackie and Angel. Nice to see old freinds again (the lip ring looks really good Jackie).  Everyone either went home or to Jackies so i just went home for a little.  Got ahold of Krista and we went to get handcuffs from Hustlers. We got these handcuffs that confuse the shit out of her and I, why do they come with keys if you can just use the quick release?  Then we headed to this lesbian bar because she wanted to meet someone.  We went in started a game of pool and the guy asked us for ID and i told him i was 18 and didn't have one, so he made us finish up the game of pool and leave. Funny thing is, he never asked Krista for her ID, do i detect a little sexism just because im a straight male in a lesbian bar? well thats about it for now.

One thing that's making me angry to hear is these kids calling Boynton Beach ""B-Town"". Your not from Boston, prob will never go there and Boynton is nothing like it, true story i was there.  Roy leaves for rehab tomorrow, which is ridiculouse because he's kept his nose clean for long enough that i trust it won't happen again. 6 mons. is a little excessive. He'll get through it fine.  Went to FAU to chill with james and nikki last night. Had fun, I can see alot of potential fun in that school, cool people, always something to do, and just overall sweetness. Nice change from Boynton.  I e-mailed my father for the first time in awhile the other day asking him to buy me a plane ticket to visit this winter and pay my cell phone bill, still no response, hope nothing happened to him.  I can't wait to go up there, it's is def one of few things that will get me out of this stressful sequence of events that have been going down latley. Thats about it for this week.

Saw christine at the mall sometime this week. She walked up and gave me a kiss, it hurt but felt right at the same time, damn i hate this shit, I have never spent this long dwelling over a girl. Whats wrong with the Shmotz latley?  Ashley dro is back with Chris and tried to set me up for a fight with him, now if you know me you know I don't like fighting and i try to avoid it, not beacause im scared, just because there are better ways to solve things, and what kind of moron does she take me for saking me where i am and what im doing and then saying Chris isn't on his way?  Come on ashley your smarter than that. Saw a good movie last night that i don't know the name of so i'll describe it and hope someone that reads this can tell me the name,  It is about these murders that happened at a motel, the murders were done by one person but by only one of 10 personalitys he has, most of the movie shows his different personalitys trying to survive the only violent one in him, good movie, makes no sense if you don't see it all the way through.  I have been getting the migraines again which is always a sign that something is wrong with whats going on, all i have to do is find what it is. Plan on heading to Nikki's as soon as james returns from his journey to the west coast with his father, thats something to look forward to.

I was depressed, i admit it, but it's not in my personality to stay sad for very long.  My friend krista helped me through that by coming and chillin till around 2 in the morning.  I thank her alot for that.  Couple days after that i busted my ankle pretty narly and it's still all sorts of fucked up. James needed a place to stay on Friday i believe so i helped him out with that, he helped me beat final fantasy a little.  I keep getting a little depressed each time im going through my phone and see Christine or find something of hers around my room.  But o well, time heals all wounds.  I'm sorry if i sound heartless but if you know me i dont get sad for long.  Last night i was chillin in my house calling random people and it just so happened that Ashley and Vanessa were chillin over at Quarterdeck with roger so i skated over there,  chilled for a bit.  Then we went to the sandpiper cove club house to drink and i called Pig. He doesnt drink very often so he got drunk off of some parrot bay mixes and a couple shots off rasberry vodka, had to walk him home. kind of funny seeing him piss ass drunk.  I found out that skin head josh doesnt have beef with me wich is a good thing. Ashley ended up hooking up with Lauder in the bathroom...a couple times.  about a bottle of vodka and 3 more mixes i stumble home and stay up all night with a stomach ache.  but it was worth it.  Got a call today around 2 from Erica asking me to the mall so i go.  I see this girl Kelly that i havent seen in ages and chill with her until she goes with her g/f to get name tags at petsmart. Find Erica and Sarah and we find Horton and his freind.  Josh gave me a filterless clove which is a very nice smoke.  Eventually i found Ashley, Diane, Bubble Butt,  and Danielle.  Cool seeing that crew again.  Ilya showed up around 5 to promote one of his shows, Got a ride home from him and grabbed some flyers to help out.  Came home and reformated the comp and spent 2 and a half hours on the Adelphia costomer service line,  i think im gunna invent something to fix those. Thats about it.

This fucking hurricane bullshit was quite the scare for florida and it did next to nothing except knock out a couple power lines.  only thing that stopped me from doing is getting farther in FFXII.  I had my power back four days after i lost it, other people just got it back.  I missed RagFest 3 last night because i couldn't find a ride all the way to Ft.Lauderdale.  James got kicked out/ moved out of my house for selling pot to some lady across the street.  He's fine living with Nikki and such.  Finally got my new phone.  If you want the number instant message me or contact me in someway and if your special enough you'll get it.  Gave Newbie a ring to see what that kids been up to, hadn't seen him in a while.  Four days until Christine and I have been dating for 2 months.  Chip and I are planing a road trip for this summer, so at least i have something to look forward to.  Stitch and Tori randomly showed up at my door which was awkward but not unpleasent.  Heather moved into a new house over on Boynton and Military,  Chip, some friends of his and I helped her with that yesterday.  I might get her old leather couch for my room. Which means if james wants his half of the current couch then he will have to come get it.  Ghost in the Shell 2 came out this week I'll have to go see that on a count of the first one was one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. I plan on goin to a show on the 25th to see Chips band play and beat up some DSA kids, so that should be fun.   I have to find out when Soulfly is coming and make james buy my ticket for that.  Might be getting hooked up with a job working security at Sound advice Apitheater, that would be nice.  Being able to see free shows and a chance to meet the bands.

Found out you have to be wearing your I.D. at all times at are school starting next week or it's a dress code violation and if you get three of those you have a saturday school, don't know about you but i have much better things to do during the weekend than sit in school.  Started talking to Tori again without yelling at each other over stupid shit, which is cool.  Christines mom is going all psycho bitch and not letting her come over here.  I feel bad, like im a burden on her, and that maybe these fights between her and her mom are over me.  I hope they aren't.  I love her but don't want to make her life at home miserable.  James might be moving out soon.  Niki is looking for a way to have him live with her a FAU.  He would need a car before that could happen, so im not counting on it.  Had a pretty good weekend this week, Christine and I had some good alone time which was nice, very nice.  Picked up Final Fantasy 7 for playstation on Sunday, which i have become addicted to.  That game rules.  I don't have to go into school until 10:30 tomorrow which is a nice change even for a day.  I hope Christine can come over tomorrow.  See you later space cowboy........."

"event","So this trying to update everyday isn't working.  So i figure i start updateing on the weekends about a whole week in one entry, way more efficient than everyday updates.  So school hasn't been treating me that bad this week.  Met some new people and did some fun things in class.  Got a dress code violation ticket for the only pair of pants i own, which sucks because im a big kid so i need big pants.  My Biology teacher was the one that gave me the ticket and i told him the situation with money so he might buy me new pants, so something good might come out of this.  I said the dreaded ""L"" word to Christine, which was hard to say due to previous experiances but i really mean it.  There is no one else i would rather be with right now, I'm really happy with her.  Jefferys girlfreind dumped him for one of my other close freinds so Im torn in that situation.  Jeffery hasn't even told me yet but news travels fast in Boring Beach, FL.  James is gone for the  weekend, so i dont have to worry about him coming home when im with Christine or making sure i leave the door unlocked so he can get in, which is somewhat convieneant but not really that much of one.  Lost my fucking wallet with Chris' number in it so i cant confirm if i still have a ride to Orlando to see Soulfly.  Figures the one time i get money and put it in it's rightfull place i lose it.  FUCKING SHIT!!!! i just completley fucked up my cell phone.  First i break the screen and my mom doesnt replace it, even though when devon broke hers the first and second time it was replaced within a week.  Now i go to clean my pants and forget to remove my phone and halfway through washing them i realize  what i did and got retreive it and it's waterlogged so it looks like i have a long night of cell phone repair in my future.  My mom already told me she isn't going to replace it for a long time, once again proving that devon gets everything she wants while im left in the dirt to fend for myself. Nothing new, I should be used to it by now.  Mother dearest didn't even listen to me when i told her to get fucking insurance on my phone the next bill she payed which means i have to wait at least another month for a new phone, which is bullshit.  I wish that just once someone would listen to me when i give them advice or tell them to do something.  Here's a hint people, you wouldn't have dirt on your shoulders if you weren't playing in the mud.  Im going to see what i can do about the phone and whether or not i can fix it myself.  See you later space cowboy................"

"event","Hey, sorry for the lack of update, been busy with school and such. Still enjoying my classes, meeting new people everyday.  I've had two things to look forward to all week, seeing Christine and seeing Alien Vs Predetor.  Hopefully both happen, can't wait to see AVP, been waiting forever for this movie to come out. I hope Christine can come with James and I to the movie, that would be cool. I stayed home from school today because i dont feel like getting caught in the rain while in a portable like what happened yesterdsay. James has been skipping school to go to work which i disagree with but hey whatever floats your toaster. I need to go find a ciggarette, IM OUT, me of all people out, im never out of ciggarettes. Alright it's time to walk over to shell and bum some. See you later space cowboy.........."

"event","Today was the dreaded first day of school.  It really wasnt that bad, I remember knowing more people but i got pretty good teachers.  First period- Biology, this class is going to be fun.  Got this guy that reminds me of how i would act if i was a teacher, have fun but lay down the rules, and we get to disect stuff!  Second period-Digital Design, i love computers so i wont mind this class, she told the class about the new program they use to control computers and told me it can't be hacked, so im going to prove her wrong which will be fun.  Third period- Wood Shop, the real teacher is'nt going to be there for awhile and we have this completly sonile old guy substatuing for him which means free period that class.  Fourth period- World History,  this teacher is the couch of the baseball team.  He's the ex-military gone teacher style guy, this class might be a little tough.  Fifth period- Geometry, The teacher for this class seems OK.  I love math so i should do fine.  Six period- English 2. This class is going to be alot of fun. Here is an exact quote from the teacher- ""I only became a teacher because all the other teachers suck"". Great shit.  Seventh period- Team Sports, seriously, do i look like im interested in physical education?  The class should be OK from what i hear it's like recess and i have an emo kid in my class i can hit with the wiffle bat, LOL.  I have no idea how i ended up with sophmore classes, I didn't pass last year.  O well im not complaining.  I should probly get to that homework. See you later space cowboy..........."

"event","Today was pretty good, woke up around 2:30.  Christine called around 3:00 saying she was coming over.  We watched ""Animal House"", which is a damn funny movie.  Nikki showed up and we decided we where hungry so we would go to Golden Coral, got there and the place was packed.  Headed over to Steak-n-Shake picked up Josh and peach milkshakes and headed to Denny's.  Got an awesome waitress who didn't ring up Christines food or any of the drinks which was cool.  Started heading for Waffle House, Christine and I had a chance to talk (which was nice) while the rest of the crew blasted a spliff.  Got to Waffle House and James started puking (dumb-ass always pukes after smoking).  Shortly after Christine got picked up, her dad seemed pissed, hope she's ok.  A little later John Lauder showed up and played a few games of cards.  After some games of rummy and spades Charlie showed up to take everyone home.  He was drunk and had some personal business to take care of so he couldn't take us all the way home or chill.  Got dropped off at the Mobil on gateway.  Place was packed with pigs so we made sure we were in and out with beef jerky, gatorade, and lolipops.  Walked home while eating my strawberry tootsie-pop and smoking the best ciggarettes ever created, pineapple/coconut flavored camels.  Got home and some time after that James walked Nikki home.  Thats about it for today.  See you later space cowboy.........."

"event","Did nothing today, don't know why im writing.  Just sat around playing GTA3 and chillin with jeffery.  Made a pineapple up-side down cake, Mmmmm pineapples.  Almost ran out of ciggarettes, that would have sucked.  Found a really funny online series called ""Joe Zombie"".  It's about a zombie thats gets awakened and seeks revenge on man kind, sounds cliche but it is one of the coolest and funniest cartoons I have ever seen.  It's on newgrounds if any one wants to check it out.  Christine had some cook-out to go to so she couldn't hang out today, which sucked.  Wish she would call or come online.  I'm gunna go, G-Phoria is on and i dont wanna miss the last half.  See you later space cowboy......."

"event","Yet another day of sitting in the house with nothing to do but play video games and smoke my life away.  Jeffery, Christine, Nikki, and James were here all day so at least i spread the boredom.  Christine seemed different today, Im worried.  I think it's just the fact that she's raggin'.  Jeffery informed me that there is a new dress code at my school.  It states that no skin can be showing, no baggy pants, no clothing with logos and a variety of other ridiculous rules.  If they want to change the way i dress then they can buy me new clothes, i sure wouldn't mind.  Got a can of pinnapples today from Nikki, woot woot.  James and I are very close to beating GTA3.  Thats about all that happened today.  See you later space cowboy..........."

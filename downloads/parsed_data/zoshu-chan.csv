"event","I'll probably start packing tomorrow, so don't expect to see me logged in anywhere for the next few days, packing, moving, unpacking and all that included.<br />Because of that, I spent the whole day with Yoru, because he's my best friend and all. He taught me how to make graphics, I taught him of a game called ""Chubby Bunny."" All in all, an interesting day.<br /><br />I went to the mall with my dad to pick up some medicine for me, because he insisted on coming. And then he started buttering me up with, ""Maybe if we have to get rid of the cats, I'll get you a hamster. Or a chinchilla!""<br /><br />At first I was all, ""Yay! Chinchilla!"" But then I realized, ""Wait... why would we get rid of the cats?""<br /><br />""We have to give them to humane society."" It would be good to note that he said this as if I should've known.<br /><br />""<i>Why</i> <i>would we have to do <b>that</b></i>?""<br /><br />""They <i>keep</i> <i>peeing</i> on the <i>chairs</i>!""<br /><br />Here's when my, ""you're so in for it"" warning comes on. See, I can understand why they pee on those particular chairs. Since the day we got them, they <i>already</i> smelled of urine! And, because he apparently doesn't understand English, he keeps insisting that it's because the cats already urinated on them. For <strike>My-- I wonder how many Christians I just offended...</strike> Christ's sake!<br /><br />"

"event","I'm moving. And in two days, I have to start packing and stuff. So don't expect to see me on the computer for about a week when that starts up. 
Yoru doesn't know yet, I still haven't called him. Mostly 'cause I know he's gonna be upset. 
We're moving back to a town called Richmond Hill, which I hate. And I'm gonna have to be in a car for around 45 minutes, in good traffic, to get anywhere I need to go in Kitchener. And because of that, Yoru's only gonna be able to visit me once or twice a month.

And, to all the people who read this and are e-friends with Yoru, that means he'll only be getting on the computer once or twice a month, since he uses mine. Eventually, he might get his own computer, if he can afford it. But I doubt that.

So, yeah, I'm too depressed to really say much more."

"event","I am convinced that Andre hitting me in the head with a pot lid has given me brain damage. XD
I was talking to Tine, and when I tried to refer to Yoru, I said Zoshu. Woah.
And then when my mom came up with ice for my forehead, I called myself Tine. o-o

Guuu, my head hurts. And I'm hungry. And I have two people sleeping on my floor. 

Nyaaaaa, I'm too lazy to keep writing this."

"event","So pissed off right now, I am! ... Stop talking like Yoda, I will.<br /><br />Anyway, now that I got that over with. Andre through a temper tantrum. For the worst reason. Ever. He brought the car home last night (keep in mind that he doesn't have a driver's license... or permission to drive the car) at around 1:30 AM last night, with a scrape on the driver's side. THEN he also brings home the guy that, by court order, he's not allowed to hang around with. So I come downstairs the next morning, and have to say hello to Mr. Police Officer.<br />But that's not where it ends, oh no.<br />He comes by today (well TECHNICALLY the same day) and starts asking my mom for a ride to his friend's house. WTF? He does all this shit, and then expects to get a ride?! And he threw (I JUST realized that I put ""through"" XD) a temper tantrum when my dad comes home and says, ""no."" So guess what he does? He throws the lid to a pot in the general direction of everyone else in the family. And guess who it hits? Yeah, me. The one person who wasn't getting involved, AT ALL. So in the mean time, my dad goes to yell at him, in which time Andre pretty much attacks him. And mom is the only person who's noticed the welt growing on my forehead. So she goes to grab me some ice (erm... frozen vegetables).<br />So yeah, for the sake of Andre not putting more holes in the walls, my dad finally has to give him the ride. He apologized, but of course his voice told everyone that he didn't mean it. And when he was leaving, I ask my mom if she thinks it needs medical attention. And Andre has the nerve to go, ""Oh it's not that bad, just a bruise."" <i>Ahem</i>, that's like a murderer looking at his victim, slowly falling into the sweet embrace of death and going, ""Oh, don't worry, I have no clue how it feels to be dead or anything, but the damage doesn't look to bad! You'll be <i>fiiine</i>!""<br />Okay, that was probably too dramatic, but whatever.<br />And the worst part, my dad can't even <i>hit him</i>. He smacks me with a pot lid, attacks him, and he can't even shove him. It's completely insane.<br /><br />And this is why I've been considering that, ""family rants"" community. <br /><br />But whatever, I'm just gonna try to take my mind off it. *goes off to find something to make me laugh*"

"event","Getting around in the outside world and job hunting are apparently a bad idea when you've just recovered. Or, I think I'd recovered, looking back, and judging by how crappy I feel now, I think I could've used another day or two.

Until around 10:00 AM; I felt like I was going to pass out. But nooooooo~, ""I'll fell better after I wake up more!"" So then ,&nbsp; instead of just being on the verge of conciousness, I'm falling asleep. Y'know, they actually feel different when you have them at the same time. And then the stomach pain kicked in. Grrrrr, I hate it!

And then, I came home at around 3:45 PM; and slept until 9:17, AAAAAGH! I lost pretty much my entire day, and there's no way I'll be able to sleep tonight.&nbsp; X-X 

Maybe I'll post again later, but for now, I'll be in that corner over there, emoing."

"event","The title has nothing to do with this entry, really.<br /><br />Anywho, I got myself a mixture of mood themes. XD They're all by <div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://frozenwithin.livejournal.com/profile""><img width=""17"" height=""17"" style=""border: 0pt none ; vertical-align: bottom;"" alt=""[info]"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://frozenwithin.livejournal.com/""><b>frozenwithin</b></a></div>; so yeah.<br /><br />And, I send my regrets to all of the dead Canadian soldiers. But they've got me thinking. What the hell? WHY in hell do we feel the need to constantly go to war with eachother? I mean, we just live in different parts of the same planet, which means we are all the same race; humans. But I doubt that a lot of people are holding onto their humanity. But on the other hand, the plights of the Middle East will sort themselves out, North American soldiers are losing their lives for something they weren't involved in from the start. If anything, we're just getting ourselves into trouble, and not really helping anyone.<br /><br />But enough about that, I don't want people attacking me. XD<br /><br />I wonder how my e-mail address had gotten all over Turkey. XD I think 3 guys from there have added me now. And they're all perverts how keep asking me for my picture and telling me they have erections. &gt;3&lt; They're basically talking dirty to me with really bad grammer!<br /><br />I'm, pretty excited about my birthday, but then again, I'm not. I'm excited about getting a year older (but a little not excited...) but I know that I'm gonna get a bunch of chocolate from everyone again. I'm not ungrateful that I'm getting stuff, but I wish my friends and most of all my <i>family</i> would put some more thought into it. In fact, two of my friends aren't getting me a present at all, and they want to come to my party, and asked if I would give something out for their younger siblings. Ugh, I know I'm probably just shallow, but whatever."

"event","Yes, the<i> real </i>Zoshu has gotten an LJ!<br /><br />I say real because someone else had chosen the username Zoshu and was pretending to be me. But, I <i>accidentally </i>hacked them. O.oU When I was logging into this account, I forgot to put zoshu<b>_chan</b> and just put zoshu. And, imagine that, we used the same password! O3O So I deleted their account. &gt;D<br /><br />Anyway, Yoru's writing a story. XD Imma review it later. :3 And he keeps telling me to set up my scanner, but I'm lazy. XDD<br /><br />And Tine's gonna make me an LJ icon. YAY! She's so awesome at making graphics. Maybe I'll ask her to make a mood theme too, 'cause I can't find any that I want. And I don't like the default themes. So yeah."

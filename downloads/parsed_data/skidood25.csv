Another Time,

Went for a solo drive in the '71 the other night...just drivin round the falls down streets I used to drive down every night (or day when we all had restricted licenses- ""drive till we die...or 9 o clock""). It was cool to see the familiar streets again...Drove past Perlmans'..stopped in. Holly was home, but no Heidi.  Circled cayuga island...Drove up 77th & past Niagara Catholic. It was a little sad when I saw that the Bryk and the Bovanizer..I mean Ms. Mills retired.....Cruised up Hyde Park...Stopped by my sister's place.....then cruised through Lewiston & home.

I'm thinkin of planning a sort of reunion picnic type thing sometime soon....just to see how many people from the old ""group"" are still around & see what they're up to. Since the winter BBQ got shit canned on it's 6th year this past winter, I think a summer BBQ is in order. Anybody Interested?

I got hired fulltime at Praxair (starting tomorrow) as a mechanical engineer.  My boss let me take 4 weeks off between graduation and my start date. So...Patty and I took a road trip to Seattle and Vancouver making stops in Chicago, The Black Hills, Yellowstone, Glacier Park, and Cleveland. (all in 2 1/2 weeks) Then, I spent my 4th week off in the Carolinas with my dad.  Since my first hot rod ('71 GMC) is complete, I picked up a new project.  I bought a '58 Chevy pickup.  It's gonna be a cute little truck. 

Anyway, that was like the past 4 weeks...8 thousand plus miles of driving.  The winter went decently.  Lots of snowmobiling, but a lot of personal shit that I had to sort through solo.  But hopefully, the rest of the ""Master Plan"" will come together within a couple years.  So far, everything's right on and tomorrow's the first day of the rest of my life. 

Anyway, That's all...throw me a comment if anybody's still out there on this thing.

I haven't seen anybody from ""the group"" or the falls in general for about a decade now (except for a couple people at green day last night). What the fuck happened to everybody? Speaking of which...after 5 years, the winter BBQ may not happen this year.  I'm just tired of working to put on a shindig and either nobody shows or everybody is bitchin about the weather or somethin. Fuck that.

She will be retiring with 191,000 miles on her. 76,000 of those miles were put on by me over the course of a little over 2 years. It averages out to 100 miles a day! She's been on trips to Harrisburgh PA,Boston MA,Boston NY, New York City,Erie PA,Pittsburgh, North Carolina,Florida (twice), Binghamton (a whole bunch), Geneseo(a lot), Rochester, Canandaigua, Saracuse,Canada, Warsaw, Savona, Poughkeepsie (3 times)and many menagerie gigs..... She cost me $250 at an auction. I put $2000 dollars into her oversized engine and transmission initially and $500 into her interior. Later a sunroof was added along with 3 sets of front tires, 1 set of kick ass back tires, 4 new shocks, all new exhaust, a new rear end, a new gas tank, new U joints, new back doors, a new radiator, all new brakes, a new fuel pump, a new pitman arm, door handles out of a 1967 Chevy Caprice (To replace the trick window opener handles...remember those?), a new driver side window track, a new wing window, 2 side mirrors (off a ford van), 2 air horns, wheels off a cop car, emergency brake cables, and a lot of spray paint to cover the rust. I took the transmission out and in 4 times.
    But, that's all in the past, and once new parts are wearing out again.  Her tires have already been swapped onto Judah's van.  She'll be stripped for parts and sent to the press. Her engine will be Kept for a future vehicle. She has until midnight tonight when she turns into a pumpkin.....i mean her insurance will be transfered to the new van.

  The summer was fun, too bad it's over though. I built a trailer for Menagerie out of 1/2 a dodge caravan. It turned out pretty sweet. If you want to see it, you'll just have to come to the next Menagerie show. Moby Dick currently stands at 187500 miles, making the 200000 mile mark seem unrealistic. so sad. so far though, i put 72,000 miles on her in 2 years. She deserves to retire soon. Work is underway on the next big white van to take her place. School is ok...most of my classes have some relevance now, so that's cool. I still refuse to join friendster. fuck that shit. Um, what else.....Patty is back in Binghamton for the semester and the Jewish holiday coming up falls on a friday...doing be no good because classes are only canceled after 6PM. o well. The trip to the theme park north of albany appears to have been shit canned due to lack of summer. However, i will be going to Utica at some point for some snowmobile parts...perhaps it will be one of the last road trips taken in Moby Dick...Or maybe it will be the maiden Voyage of the next van. By the way, once the next van is on the road, it will need a name, so be sure to check it out and try to come up with one. It's customary not to name your own vehicle so it will be up to everyone else...It'll be a little while though. anyway, must go....

"event","Well, I tried it...and now its time to use my livejournal for its original purpose- to bash other live journals. So, don't be surprised if you're randomly taken off my ""friends"" list or get a taunting post. Nothing against you guys. Just against your ""live journal"".

Live journal is fucking gay. If you don't want people to get involved with your shit, why do you post it on the internet? fuck off.

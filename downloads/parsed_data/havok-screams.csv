"event","I wish for once, that Breann could be a genuine person...I mean, you say you want to be with me, you say you need me, but all you care about is other people, how pretty other people are, how fun other people are, well I dont need that shit. You say you can't trust me, I dont even hang out with other girls! Your the one with the abundance of friends from the opposite sex, so don't tell me that I can't be trusted. I never cheated on you, GET OVER IT!!! I dont know what i want out of anything right now, but from the shit your giving me, Im not sure if its you. On another note, I am sad, because John Horne is expelled, and now I am completely alone at school, because a number of my friends, not going to say any names, decided they dont want to be friends anymore, even after nights of crying together because I was going to move away. I geus people change, too bad. I really do miss hanging out with you... and despite what you or anyone else may think I still love you man, take it or leave it. You know their are times when i truthfully dont know what to do about anything, and this is one of those times. Nothing makes sense to me, nothing seems like anyone is telling me the truth. God, I sound so emo. So, Im living in my own apartment now, well, I have a roomate, But he's never there, He goes to IUK, and then spends the rest of the day with his girlfriend. I feel like no one wants me for anything anymore, not a boyfriend, not a friend...nothing at all, yay. Nothing will work between us, so why try?"

Not tell me oyu dont like him b/c you were arguing with him about me...if you love him to be around so much, then leave me and be with him, instead of making me suffer with the thought in my head that i cant keep you happy, i mean i thought you would be happy after we havent argued for like a week...not that it matters, i dont make you as happy matt does...you fight for him to talk to you, yet wont even say a word to me....why do you do this....why hurt me? Do i really deserve it...what did i do? Im sorry? This hurts way too much...just do something, make a decision, one or the other...me or matt, im sorry but thats the way it has to be.

"event","Right now i want to die...and everyone keeps asking me ""whats wrong?"" and GOD DO I HATE THAT!!! I hate when ppl show me sympathy it makes me more depressed but for the few ppl who read this who aren't breann: Im depressed b/c Breann was all pissy with me this morning and i let her know and i tried talking to her at lunch and she just told me she didnt want me there...yeah so there you go make what you will of it but to me she acts like she doesnt want to go out with me and she seems to be wasting her time if that is so. And all this telling me that she doesnt care...she needs to make up her mind b/c in a recent entry in her journal she says she reallys does when she says that, and i really dont know what to think. But i seriously think she is tired of me...and im tired of her treating me like this when i do  nothing to deserve it. ARGH!!


I LOVE YOU BREANN!!!"

  Howdy all!   Soooo..what to talk about today....im in a good mood, and I gave Breann a hickey on her cheek on accident last night. Its quite amusing. Its kinda warm in here...I got my first college letter yesterday, i was kinda excited, and i kinda want to go there, but there are other colleges offering the same fields i want to look into. I need to get my AFI ""art of drowning"" CD out of Paul's truck.....I NEED SOME AFI!!! My grandma is stupid she annoys the hell out of me...I want to move out of her apartment. I watched kill bill vol. 2 with Breann last night it was good. I liked it alot...but i like all tarantino films...theyrrrrrrrre great! (that was dumb) lol. So im bored and this ISTEP keeps me from seeing Breann at lunch but i think i get to see her today at lunch, and maybe I will see her today after school I hope, but if it is nice, I will go riding with Terry maybe. I havent hung out with Psy in ahwile maybe i will go down there, but he is always at Samantha's house...Im going to dress like a THUG tommorrow and Breann is going to kill me, lol, its gonna be great. I need a stereo...the only way i can listen to music in my room is on my PS2 but then I cant listen while playing games...speaking of games...i cant wait to get my xbox for x-mas....maybe Breann will get me Fable for my xbox...(hint hint)  but she wont tell me what she wants....(hint hint) if she gets me Fable earlier then christmas I will just play it at my moms which means I will be down there alot and will go see her alot...hmmmm, lol. I really love Breann alot...regrdless of what my Gramma says...ill kill her if she does anything to get between me and Breann...I'm so funkin' bored right now...well...not much to type anymore...adios all...oh and its spelled hasta la vista Breann...:)

Thats AFI...""morningstar""
     I hate crying...it helps though...i love you so much, and i couldnt bear not having you, you are my reason for carrying on. I have never been so happy to hear someone randomly tell me they loved me since i last heard my dad say it. back then (this is all crow) i used to think things like that were trivial, but now i know...nothing is trivial. I cant take all this fighting, we have to do something about it. I would give up anything for you. Im sorry for saying things about you still liking brandon, i need to grow up too...I wish you would open up to me, it would make things so much easier...im sorry if any of this upsets you....I love you with all my heart and soul."

SO, im friends with Terry Flores now...he's a really funny guy...lets see...breann's mom wants me (thats so gross) well not much more to say."

Sometimes i wonder if she even really wants to be with me...she says that she usually gets bored of guys easily, maybe thats whats with me...she must be bored of me but doesnt want to tell me...i dont know im so freaking confusing...i just want to be happy, but i want her to be happy too, i wish she would just talk to me...sometimes i wish i were a rock....and then only crazy ppl would talk to me..."

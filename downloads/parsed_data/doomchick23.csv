You found a girl with self esteem so low, that she won't leave you.
Even when you lie. 
Even when you cheat.
Even when you stare her in the eyes and lie.
Lie. Lie. Lie
You rip her heart out and throw it away. 
But that doesn't matter to you.
Because you know she will still be there.
Always has been.
Always will be.
Until you kill everything left inside.
And then you will be left with a shell.
Of what once was, and could have been.
Your selfish ways lead to this.
Your fears lead to this.
Your lack of love...
She wants to break free.
Be happy with someone true.
But that will never happen.
All because of you."

Matt got a job finally, the manager tells him he could be promoted to shift manager in three weeks.
I started working again today. Wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible. The lip ring has to go though, hello retainer!
Getting all my work done for my classes is easier than last year. Infact I am ahead of my stats class right now -creepy-
I really enjoy creative writing...DAMN i forgot I have a poem due tuesday...guess i was wrong about keeping up with my classwork.......
I road my scooter for an hour yesterday, i thought I was going to die.
My mood swings are gone for now, but we will see what happens later on. 
Have to be at work at 7am tomorrow...fuck shit damn...gotta get up at 6am then! which means I need to sleep soon....i hate time
My mom got another new car, bye bye avalon.
Now I have to take a shower and get ready for bed....it sucks not having control of what happens in your life.&nbsp; I should be able to sleep when I want and get up when I want, not have other people tell me when it's okay"

"event","I wish you would stop comparing me to her. Some girl I don't know, will never know.  You say you have been burned and that's all you can see.  Every chance you get you tell me about her hurting you.  You never give me a reason why she did it. I don't know if you gave her a reason or what.  You say you thought you loved her and I supose that's what makes it hurt so much.  But I'm not her.  If she ever told you that she loved you she lied.  I'M NOT LYING I'M NOT HER and i wish you could get that through your head.  Why would I throw away a year and a half of my life with you???!!! Don't tell me that it happened before so it leads you to feel that way against me... you say you trust me BUT YOU DON'T. If you trusted me you wouldn't be upset you wouldn't be afraid that I am going to go fuck someone else or do whatever you think I will...  again...NOT HER. She was a dumb bitch that was most likely just too young to see who she had and I'm sure if she was still around today she would do anything to get you back. I'm glad I don't know her I'm glad she's not here, I'mn fucking glad she did cheat on you because if she didn't I may not be with you right now.  You didn't deserve to be hurt but you were.  Instead of throwing it in my face whenever I get the chance to do something on my own why don't you check yourself and realize that I am a different person. That I say i love you and I mean it. I feel it, I live it, you are all I have most days and you don't even seem to realize that.  It hurts sooooo damn much to know that you were with someone before me, to know that you ""loved"" someone else.  You keep pushing me into the shit catagory in your life, you keep thinking that I will be like her that I will hurt you like she did, that I will be gone just like everything else.  don't label me as :Just another thing that can go wrong: I'm a person...more than that, I am your girlfriend I love you.  Stop thinking of me like just another future problem like one more thing that didn't work out...each time you think like that it happens... I don't want to loose you, I don't want to be one more of those things.  If you want to keep comparing me to that fool ex of yours fine! but you will damn sure give me all the info on her that I want.  I want to know her name, she her face, know about her personality and all that bullshit, I want to know WHO YOU THINK I AM .  I know one thing for sure, I'm not her, never will be, I care about you more than you will ever let yourself realize.  
I love you. I hope one day you will really see that.  Maybe you will let go of her, stop thinking about her every chance you get.  Maybe you want me to be her, maybe you still care about her even though she hurt you...first loves are hard to let go of.  Whatever it is, I just wish you would see me for me, know that I am true to you and only you as long as we are in a relationship, which I hope will be forever. 

I love you    
-Melissa"

It is never good to start thinking that nothing really matters. It's even worse to believe it.  Things still matter to me.  I don't realize it until I make things worse though.  It's not all my fault but I don't make things better.  Nothing feels worse than being helpless.  Sometimes I look and feel empty I will never understand why.  Other times I feel that I can go on forever with just one glance.  It is not good to be depressed makes me think way to much.  Just want to be happy again, is that so much to ask for?"

"event","oh LiveJournal I feel so bad for leaving for 10 months, will you please forgive me?

So I'm back in Lakeland I forgot my biology lab book so now i have to be back in Fort Myers before 6pm Sunday so I can take my lab quiz. bleh, why does school have to folllow me home?  

So I failed my biology ch.6-10 test with a 38, but they haven't posted the grades on ANGEL yet, so I'mn wondering if they are going to drop the test all together, that would save my life!  
I hate that even when I study I fail.  I envy my friends for taking tests and passing with such high grades, even when they think something will come out not so great, it's better than what I can do.  I don't know how I started out as a smart kid and ended up a loser that can barely pass basic shit.  Not that biology is basic by any means, but still.  I tell myself that I will do better next time, but then part of me knows that I won't.  Is that why I fail?  Self destruction? Or is that the excuse that I use to explain my failure?  is the failure the excuse, or the pre-failure thoughts the excuse?  Is there a real reason?  Who knows, not me.

I'm doing really well in English, which is fun.  
Pyschology will suck a bit now because my cool profesor is gone... oh well.

Hopefully things will lighten up, and I won't have to be so sad anymore."

The White Stripes Lyrics

We're Going To Be Friends Lyrics



Fall is here, hear the yell
back to school, ring the bell
brand new shoes, walking blues
climb the fence, books and pens
I can tell that we're going to be friends

Walk with me, Suzy Lee
through the park and by the tree
we will rest upon the ground
and look at all the bugs we found
safely walk to school without a sound
safely walk to school without a sound

Here we are, no one else
we walked to school all by ourselves
there's dirt on our uniforms
from chasing all the ants and worms
we clean up and now its time to learn
we clean up and now its time to learn

Numbers, letters, learn to spell
nouns, and books, and show and tell
at playtime we will throw the ball
back to class, through the hall
teacher marks our height against the wall  
teacher marks our height against the wall

We don't notice any time pass
we don't notice anything
we sit side by side in every class
teacher thinks that I sound funny
but she likes the way you sing

Tonight I'll dream while in my bed
when silly thoughts go through my head
about the bugs and alphabet
and when I wake tommorow I'll bet
that you and I will walk together again
I can tell that we're going to be friends"

****next day****

1) Prob and Stats (aka: hell)
2) Biology 2 (DEATH!)
4) Food Production 1 (yum)
6) AP english 4 (shits class)

So i'm going to have math everday... 
Atleast my first day of school will be SWEET!  All i have to do is suffer though math, then i am home free!

But the second semister of school stuff will be diffrent cause i can only take certain classes at certain times!

***second semister!***
1) stats
3) Art
5) food
7) teacehrs ass.

1) stats
2) Ap American History
4) SAT math class
6) Ap English

Sooo all in all, its ok...

I will have most of my classes with my friends, becasue we all took teh same thing.  And stats, bio2, ap history, and ap english are only offered the times i have above! woooo! our school sucks!"

<TD>
<P><B>Oral</B>: you appear to have a good balance of independence and interdependence knowing when to accept help and when to do things on your own.</P>
<P><B>Anal</B>: you appear to have a good balance of self control and spontaneity, order and chaos, variety and selectivity. </P>
<P><B>Phallic</B>: you appear to have a good balance of sexual awareness and sexual composure.</P>
<P><B>Latency</B>: you appear to have a good balance of abstract knowledge seeking and practicality, dealing with real world responsibilities while still cultivating your abstract and creative faculties and interests.</P>
<P><B>Genital</B>: you appear to be somewhere between a progressive/openminded and regressive/closeminded outlook on life.</P>
<P>Freuds theorized that there are 5 stages of psychological development. At the oral stage the main issue is dependency, at the anal stage the main issue is self control, at the phallic stage the main issue is sexual identity, at the latency stage it's skill development, and at the genital stage its creativity and productivity.</P>
<P>Freud theorized that psychological problems are related to problems during one or more of these stages. For example, being too cared for or too neglected causes someone to be orally fixated, too much or too little control causes someone to be anally fixated, insufficient parental role modeling causes phallic fixation.</P>
<P>An orally fixated person is either irrationally dependent (expects what they want to just appear) or irrationally independent (always refuses help).</P>
<P>An anally fixated person is either irrationally self controlled and servile to authority or has no self control and is compulsively defiant of authority.</P>
<P>A phallicly fixated person is either a sexual compulsive (sexually innappropriate/promiscuous) or sexually repressed.</P>
<P>Freud did not classify any latent fixation but I think it is as plausible as those at the other stages. I speculate that people that like to learn and acquire knowledge without any purpose or people that are compulsively non curious represent both dysfunctional ends of the latency spectrum.</P>
<P>The genital stage is the final Freudian developmental stage and according to Freud people don't all succeed at this. Freud believed the ideal for human happiness is to be happy in love and work, problems in one or the other cause unhappiness. </P>
<P>Like any personality system, Freud's developmental levels are just a theory, so, be speculative about your results.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>"

"event","In case you were wondering,
this fashion i'm going through,
isn't just a fad.
In case you were wondering,
these bad habits,
aren't going to be gone for years.

It's not likely that i'll ever want,
to spend these sunsets alone.
Because sitting on the inside,
looking up to the sky,
doesn't feel like much of anything alive.

In case you were wondering,
i refrain from saying i love you,but,
that doesn't mean a thing.
In case you were wondering,
i'll still be here,
though i have doubts that you want me."

"event","I have the number to a phonebooth,
somewhere in Seattle.
I call at 5 in the morning,
when i just can't sleep- because thoughts of you,
keep running through my head.
No one ever answers,
but it brings me closer to you.

I like the feeling inside of me,
when i wake up with the sunlight shining through my window,
hitting the right side of my cheek,
and all I can think about..is that when i get out of bed,
i'll be able to read..the emails you send to me.

Letters that are filled with even more reasons,
to like you; than before."

"event","I just want to forget, 
Everything you've ever said
And i just want to forget,
All those times you laughed,
And all the times my stomach jumped everytime you did.

Could i have been that wrapped up,
that i wished i could say 'i love you'?

My body feels tired,
My heart empty.

I'm sitting here,
With the sunshine flowing into my room,
And the only thing that i can think about,
Is how can she possibly make you happy?
How can she possibly know the strength of your sweet laugh,
When all you do is argue together."

"event","I saw you today, for the first time in months.
Your back faced towards me like it usually was,
And your hair up halfway.

Thoughts ran through my head
as i inched back to my seat.
I wanted to go into that room, and just,
Wrap my arms around you, and pretend you cared.

But then i remembered the hate you had for me,
and decided that wouldn't be a good idea.

So i was driving on the road today,
and tried driving with one hand, to feel how it was,
when you drove to school the cold mornings,
and we kept eachothers hands warm,
until the very minute we had to let go."

you're not ever going to be good enough for him.

So she said..
you're not ever going to hold his heart in your hand.--
-Something stupid i came up with in the shower.




It's not the way you say 'i love you' in midsentence,
Nor the way our hands always collide,
No matter where we are.

But rather the way you look at me,
The way your eyes look like heaven,
The way that when i stare into them,
I feel as though i am staring much too deep.
Much too far."

The cold air blows outside,
it reminds me of the cold mornings,
that i strived to keep your hands warm,
by grasping them with my own.

Its so cold it burns my insides,
almost as if im on fire.
on fire, and sweating droplets of sweat.
like the first night we layed together,
and the nervousness i felt.

And if i could go anywhere,
i'd go a million miles away,
to not see anybody again,
but i'd want you with me,
to try again in another world."

to win your heart over hers?

And isn't the way my stomach jumps,
every time we touch,
enough to win your heart over hers?

I just want to be captivated by your eyes,
grasped in your arms,
and led by your hands, into the heaven on earth.

So can i win your heart over hers?"

but look at whats happening.
Don't you see?
I've been longing to say just one word,
to you so that i can see you smile one last time.

I have this simple memory,
of you and i sitting near the road,
watching for the sun to rise above.

I have this simple memory,
of you.
And i would stand there waiting,
for just one glimpse of your beautiful eyes.

I have this simple memory,
of you, that i just don't want to give up now."

wishing i hadn't read what i had,
for then i wouldn't have been reminded of the memories,
that i have held in my heart.
and of everything that became of us.

I still long to hold you in my arms,
like i used to those cold janurary nights,
and i still long to kiss your lips,
like i used to on those all nighters.

I wish i could just drop it,
and say that i've moved on,
but everytime i do, i get back to the feeling,
of 'i need you'."

"event","Last night i woke up with you by my side,
and the first thing that came to instinct
was to kiss your lips,
and confess my feelings to you as you dreamt.

I didn't even have to hear 'i love you with all my heart',back,
because i already knew it would be what you would have said.

And i could tell by the way your hand was still clutching mine,
even though you had turned the other way.

And i could tell by the way you had to pull me with you,
each time you moved in your sleep.

So i sighed with relief that i knew you were still mine,
and fell back asleep knowing,
believing that i could tell."

so please make this easy on us both right now.
I'll say im sorry, and
You'll say 'i needed you anyways'.

I have this acoustic song i have stuck in my head,
for when i learn to play for you,
and you'll sigh and say 'its just so surreal'
like you used to after i couldn't begin
to pry my lips away from yours"

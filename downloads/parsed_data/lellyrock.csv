I got some Napoleon Dynamite stuff and makeup. Thats all. lol.  There were many nice lookin peepz there, woooweee. lol.jk

OH YES!  And before that, I went to QFL and hung out w/ Chris Carmichael! That was AWESOME!  He's so cool!  I learned a whole bunch about the station and how radio plays out.  I now have a better respect for that place and the people who work there. I also know now why they don't play much rock music.  Regardless of what I thought, most of the listeners at that station are like, in their 30s!!  So...if we want to change the music there...we must listen more! lol

I met Marlar in da morning, and Rick Hall!  I was surrounded with Radio personalities!  It was great fun!

So, today and yesterday my family is cleaning our carpets...joy. lol.

I'm hangin with Sam on Friday (jr. Highers rock!), that will be so much fun. hehe

dude! I went to Rockford today to audition for the Rockford Speedway national anthem thingy, and I think it went well.  But the point of this story was that I was at Fazoli's, and there was this guy taking pictures.  It was dark, and there were these lights on the ground that lit up a sign.  The lights were just right so that when his friend rode his bike past them, his shadow was huge on the wall behind him and the guy took pics of it. It looked really neat.  

I went to the pacifier today with Evan Karg's family, and it was AWESOME!  Seth was HOT!  Holy crap.  Thanks to The Internet Movie Database, I found out that he is 16. I think he's spicy.

You know what I've noticed?  When you are commited (commitment isn't the right word.  Um...let's just say ""truckin with something""), it's easy to not faulter in whatever you're committed to.  but when the commitment is over, you go sraight back to your old ways.  It's weird. I thought I was getting better in the whole, ""oh my gosh, that guy is hott!"" and I really was woeking on that! but I think I'm loosing it...lol.  oh well something to work on

So my mom and I go to oscos to get meds, and this car pulls up next to this other car.  The guy gets out and starts to talk to the guy in the car.  Me and my nosy self looked and low and behold it was MATT DAVIS in the car! (if any of you know anything about me and my obsession-no-stalkession with Brent Holder, you will know that this is his Best Friend...) SO!  

The first guy (I'll call him Bruno [no, I don't know why])is looking kinda awkward and scared b/c my mom gets out of the car.  He looks at her then Matt.  Matt then hands Bruno money once my mom goes inside.  At fist I thought he was buying drugs.  Then, Bruno goes inside too.

I and my nosy nosy self is like, staring at Matt, to see what he's doing and I notice a lighter.  AH HA! Cigarettes!  but wait-he's already 18, so he wouldn't need anyone to buy them for him. But then I realize- DUH EILER!! THE DUDES GETTING ALCHOHOL! And low and behold, 5 minutes later, Bruno comes out w/ A pack of bud light and a brown bag and hands them to Mr. Davis and his prideful self knowing that he just got away with buying alchohol.  that scum bag.

So, that was interesting. He's pretty low to do that...haha. He didn't go to college so he stayed home getting drunk, thats sad.  Poor soul...

Then add the fact that my throat feels like the Sahara and you got yourself a regular mess.

So, anywayz...on a lighter note.  

I FINALLY got iTunes and got some cool songs from my PEPSI CAPS!  yesshhh...coolness.

oh, haha. So this morning at 7:00, I get a call from my lovely friend Rachel on the bus to Myrtle Beach.  And we talked for a bit and I talked to some other people and whatnot ( I was kinda dead tho b/c after all it was 7 AM!  THANKS RACH! lol jk).  The funny part was that I was talking to Rachel, and in the background I hear Andrew screaming ""LEMME TALK TO HER!! IT'S IMPORTANT!!"".  She wasn't gonna let him talk, but I was like, ""just let him talk"" bacuse I was scared out of my mind as to what he was gonna say.

So he gets on and I was like, ""What's so important!?"" and he goes ""Nothing""

MUAHH LOL HAHA!! Ok...so you kinda had to be there.  As goes most of my stories. lol

Wow, my day was extremely eventful!  

So it started out with me finding that I didn't make the play, which is totally a-ok with me b/c I'm a freshie and I still have 3 years left!! So I'm gonna work on tech with Kyle (maybe, if he sucks up and deals with the fact that he can't be the sound guy all the time...lol. jk)!  That'll be fun!

So the day continued and nothing happened.  UNTIL I get to Spanish.  We're watching this weird movie about this spanish girl turning 15 and her family is poor and she wants to be with this ugly as heck guy who has a FOR REAL MULLET!! hahahaha.  ANYWAYZ...we were watching, and then all the sudden, I get this pass.  It's to the nurse's office, and it said ""come now"" and it was highlighted.  Obviously, somehting was wrong.  The girl delivering the pass said I needed to take my stuff. 

I get my stuff and after hearing all these statements such as ""OOWEEE!  They found the drugs in your locker!"" and crap like that.

So I go to the office, and on my way I go through the possibilities.  I need to take advil...my throat hurts...Elijah's dead...Cecelie got shot (yea, I know, stupid, ryt?  Well the thing was highlighted!!). 

So I get there and my dads standing there and he tells me that mom had a really bad fall 6th hour and hit her head hard.  They had just taken her by ambulance in the hospital.

Obviously I thought death, lol.  Which wasn't the case at all. When I got there I could hear her laughing and joking around, so all was good.  

I guess this stool thing wasn't sturdy and she sat on it and hit her head on the wall or something. 

But she's all good now.  Her head's bleeding a bit, but all is good.

2)  I JUST FOUND OUT THAT I *MIGHT* BE ABLE TO GET AN OLD BASEBALL JERSEY!  Do you know how cool that would be?!?!?  Mike Martin is gonna get an old one for me *MAYBE* because they're getting new ones this year.  Because, you see, I am a number one fan for Freeport Baseball with Emily, so a jersey would ROCK! lol

3) I'm really really happy because now I just found out that I can go to the *Forever in Us* concert tomorrow...YESS!  Of course, I am the NUMBER ONE fan...which brings me to my next recap-

4)  I have been kicked out of the number one fan spot for *Victory Upon Death*...which totally sucks...just because I can't come to one freakin show...man.  Thats sad.  I know, your prolly don't even care, but I do, because, well, I just do.

"event","so today was fun...we had this 3-in-one church service, and it was cool, but it did go a little over for time, but it still rocked.  Then we (Frontline) hosted this Spagehtti dinner thing, which was really fun...and then I went to adutition for this musical thing which I don't really think is gonna be worth any time, but oh well.  Yea, the audition sucked cuz I didn't do so well.  oh well, life goes on

So, yea, I'm chillen at home all tonight, which will be fun.  Maybe watch some of the Oscars! YESS! lol

"event","Yip, so, on Saturday was the sectional meet, and I went into it prepared and knowing that I wasn't going to go to State, but I at least wanted to make finals...

So, first round-I do really well, except for the fact that I went over 8:30 by 10 seconds...at first I thought it meant you got disqualified, but it only bumps you down a spot...ugh, lol.  So, I ended up fine for the second round, so my ranks were 3-6-2-5.  I would've gotten into finals if I hadn't messed up and been so gosh darned slow...ugh, I'm so angry! lol.  Overall I was 8th in sectionals out of 13, so thats good.  Well, at least I still have 3 more years (to kick some major BUTT! lol jk)

But it is kinda kool because I'm still going with the team down state to watch our state homies (Jacob Raupp, Jared Boyer, Nick Hoeft, and Kayla Kluck)compete!  We leave Thursday in the morning, I'm sooo excited! YESSS!! lol

Tomorrow is Valentines day...I wish everyone a happy one. (I don't know where that came from...lol)

Rachel jsut went home.  She was chillen at my house this weekend...spending time with Rachel Hepler is so much fun...lol...

GRAMMYS ARE TONIGHT!  YESS!  TOBY MAC...TOBY MAC...I HOPE HE WINS! lol jk

ok, enough with my blah blah blah-ing. lol  

Have an AWESOME WEEK!

"event","man, life is hectic.

ok, I'm not complaining at all, because I'm so blessed to be able to be in a lot of things, but man, it is so tiring.  I'm just a freshman, and already there's been the musical, speech, art 2 art, and many other things. PLEASE DON'T GET ME WRONG...I am sooo blessed to be in everything and meet so many awesome people and also blessed because as of now, there hasn't been a physical or emotional break-down. But, man, it kinda bothers me when people who don't do anything complain about being tired all the time.  I'm <b>not</b> better than anyone, and I realize it's my choice to be in all these things, but man, I'm stupid for doing it, lol.

So, sectionals are on Saturday.  That'll rock!  The main thing I need to remember is to be confident and know that whatever happens, life goes on and I have 3 more years, lol.  I'm pretty nervous, but I think I'll do well, but let's hope hope hope I do well enough to go to state, man, that would be off the shizzle (whatever in the world that means, lol)!!!!!

today was fun...I gue-OH YEA...I just remembered that I have to make up two tests...crap!! lol  ANYWAYZ...it was kinda boring tho.  Lunch was stupid, not as usual.  The people at my table rock and are so diverse that it's so much fun to be at lunch, but, it's lunch.  thats all it is. lol.  At the same time tho...I can't help but get excited to go to lunch in the middle of everding's notes.  My mind wonders to other things...because...lunch is just so much fun and cool, and.  Yea, I know.  I'm a freak, I go on and on about lunch, it's ok tho. lol

I heard that John Heder died in a car accident, I don't think it's true because a lot of people would be talking about it, so I don't think so.  But if it is true, blow me down and paint me red,  that would suck.

Art 2 art was fun.  The cast is hilarious.  Man, Nick and Adam are just so various and funny that it rocks.  Me and Lindsey just kinda sit there and smile, because they're so smart, that's all we can agree to. lol.  But then Adam'll get on one of his ""phsycological"" lectures...those are very fun.  Because I actually pay attention to learn something.  Don't think I don't understand what he says, because I can tell you that I fully understand everything that man says, it's just believing him that I'm not so sure about. lol

ok, well, gotta go to bed. 
Peace and Love

"event","Hey Homies!!  OH my gosh...yesterday rocked!!  here are the details...

1) So we go to the regionals meet(btw, only 2 freshman were on the team, me & libby), and I'm going thinking that I'm not going to do very well b/c I'm going up against really really good people.  WELL, turns out I make finals and get 3rd overall, which means I'm going to SECTIONALS!!  Oh yes, Everyone else is going to sectionals from Freeport (except for Radio, but thats another story) as well b/C we KICKED BUTT!!  Libby, My twin tiny, lol, got 4th overall, ROCK ON!!!

2) So, I was excited about that, but it got out late, and it was Freeport's formal night, so everyone had to go somewhere.  I had to go to Rockford to meet Andrew, Christi, Brad and the gang at the restaurant, but I wasn't in time for that so we met at the theater (long story, lol).  We went to see The wedding date (a chick flick, which I hate) and we sit down while Andrew went off to go the bathroom.  The movie started and 30 minutes later...no Andrew.  So we were like texting him like, 5 times to see where he was...1 hour later...no Andrew.  Brad goes to look for him and comes back...no Andrew.  WE then decided he got jumped or he went into another theater, lol.  The movie ended and we were searching for Andrew, then we see him...he was in the theater the whole time, but he didn't know where we were...that was fun.  Then we went to beef-a-roo, then to Christi's, while brad and Andrew attempted to teach me to play eukre, haha, that went well.  So we played Sweat and Pool and Idiot.  That was fun.

NON-FORMAL GROUPS ROCK!!  Shout out to my homies! lol.  (Andrew, Brad, Christi, Erica, etc. lol)

so, all in all, Saturday rocked!!  hope yours did too!
peace and Love,

"event","the last post was very strange, I know. lol.  I was very angry and sad and confused at the same time, you know how that goes.  It's bad, lol.  Everything's worked out now (well, at least I hope it will be by tonight, lol)

Anywayz,  yesterday I went to see Peter Pan with my homies in choir.  that was fun.  This chick named Kathy Rigby was Peter. It was kool. I was very skeptical about it at first, because it was a children's show (by the way, there were like, tons of little boys there dressed as Peter, it was soo cute!  anywayz, but it turned out to be very kool, because the hydraulics (flying) system rocked!!  Even though you could see the strings, and if you watched every character to see when they were being hooked on to the system, (which I did, lol) you could tell when they were being hooked and un-hooked.  

We ate at Huntley Mall.  Which was fun, except for the fact that the only store worth even looking at was Aeropostale, which isn't the awesomest store ever, but it was a outlet mall, so I got a sweater (10$) a polo shirt (5$) and a cami (99 CENTS!!) for under 20$!! lol.  It was fun.

So, now I'm at home being sick after returning to school for science, only to be read a story about this ebola outbreak and how when ebola gets into your system you puke and your body does morbid stuff and such (by the way, Mr. Schierer read us this story about a guy who this acctually happened to, and it told all the details.)  Then we watched a movie in which everyone was punking, and when the class was over I did the same thing (in the bathroom).  So I went home.  But before that I couldn't find my mom or dad, so I was like, crying, and it was bad, lol.  MAN, things get crazy when you're sick! lol

Well, tonight was ""The Buzz"" but I can't be in it anymore, and even if I could, I would sound really bad, so I'm resting my voice for regionals!!  yEa baby!! lol

Have a great Day/Night/Morning (LOL)

That was fun...oh yea, lunch was interesting too...someone (I'll call them...um...Aladdin..lol) said somthing gross but I still don't know what Aladdin said cuz I was listening to He Is Legend (it's a band!!!  THEY ROCK!  They sound awesome...and...anywayz...)and all I know was that people had really weird looks on their faces, and then were pointing to Aladdin to let me know that he said something that put weird looks on their faces..oh well!!

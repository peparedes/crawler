"event","I spent a big part of today with a friend of mine that I've known since grade 1.  We went back to our elementary school to visit old teachers and ... just to see the school I guess.  It was weird walking into the school and having people stare at us like we're some sort of kidnappers.  I recognized the secretary, she was there when I graduated back in 1994.  Her and a few other teachers, my grade 1 and grade 3/4 teacher.  We spent a bit of time chatting with teachers, but afterwards just walked around the school.  Of course, being an elementary school, there's only two hallways, the first floor for kindergarten to grade 3 and then you graduate to the second floor.  Along the first floor there are class pictures of every class since the early 90's.  I can't believe how many people I've completely forgotten about.  And these are people I used to spend 8 hours a day with.  My friend reminded me that back in grade 1 and 2 we used to play this game...""kissing tag""...I think the name says it all.  

Anyway, this probably isn't the most interesting thing to you, but it brings back so many memories of the first 10 years or so of my life that I have forgotten because I have been so busy moving on to what we call bigger and better.  I look at the teachers that I had whom are still teaching at North Agincourt...I'm sure they spent a big part of their life trying to move on with life and find the bigger and better, but eventually they ended up teaching me along with a million other bratty kids like me...and were happy doing so.  I wonder how long it will take me to realize I don't have to take over the world to be successful and happy?"

"event","It hasn't felt like the end of the school year until today.  I just finished packing all my crap to go back to Markham for the summer...1st year is over...hard to believe.  Back in high school, one month felt like an eternity, yet first year just flew by.  I don't get it. 

Anyway, so I am moving.  Signed the lease yesterday, I've fully committed myself to being anorexic so I can pay rent and make sure no shit flies at me (re: first entry).  It's one of the nicer buildings in Montreal with 24 hour security, you know, cuz I have so many stalkers and such.  It's one of three buildings connected through an underground mall which has grocery stores, restaurants, (including sushi), the SAQ, and a theatre.  I'm excited!  

Who wants to come visit??"

"event","For those that don't know, I have 2 roommates.  One of them is a Mexican law student, just some random guy that was found to take over one of the rooms.  He's been here since March.  His brother, a couple of years younger than me is here to visit...here for a couple of weeks.  One morning I wander into the kitchen and notice a water bottle in the sink, it had the letters ""FTE"" on it...and a bunch of other stuff.  Weird, I don't remember bringing my FTE bottle to Montreal.  Then I realized, it's not mine, mine has never been used.  I go ask the brother and he's like ""yeah, I went last summer...to Texas.""  Texas, I thought...didn't Shirley go to Texas?  Indeed, she did...he said ""Shirley, the girl from Canada with the British accent"".  Hmm..."

"event","One thing I have learned this year is that friends don't necessarily make good roommates.  Actually, how many stories have you heard about friends no longer being friends after living together?  Well, it's true.  From best friends to now...well, I'm not sure what we are anymore.  It's sad, but the truth and so I'm moving.  It's not worth ruining the friendship, or even worse, have someone who used to be your best friend question your ethics and morals.  No shit it hurt...maybe it did only happen because of a misunderstanding, but whatever the reason, it happened.  So another chapter, living on my own.  Yeah, I've been on my own for almost a year now, but next year it'll be just me, no roommates.  I'm excited...considering I'm generally not the biggest fan of people, I look forward to my future of solitude.  

Before any of this exciting moving takes place, I first have to ace my microeconomics final which is worth 100%...wish me luck."

"event","So the damn bathroom in my apartment flooded this morning.  And no, no crap came flying at me...thank god, or I would have killed somebody.  Such a bitch...damn people came knocking on my door this morning telling me that the bathroom that I don't use (I use another one) is flooded and that it has gone through five floors beneath my floor.  What kind of crappy apartment do I live in?  And so I proceeded to clean up the stupid mess while my roommate, he who created this mess continued sleeping.  I eventually woke him up, bitched at him and everyone else I could get a hold of.  Why can't people just check to see if their crap has clogged the damn toilet before they go off and sleep?  Is that too much to ask?

Anyway, so I started this thing because JasonShim told me to...and also because I don't want to study for my exam...yes, I have a final in 3 days ... microeconomics.  And seriously, JasonShim is not a geek, even though he insists on calling me a ""girlpancake"" I think he's wonderful.  He deserves a medal for being my friend. 

It is now ... 7:41pm, Montreal time.  I suppose I have procrastinated enough.  Time to study.  

Tip of the day:  Gilmore girls is really a great show...watch it!"

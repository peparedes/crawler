Its Your Choice----By Jessica Ross
its your choice to make 
wether you choose to love or wether you choose to hate
you can choose to be nice to your friends and family
but we cant always make the right choices can we?
and thats the great thing about life...
the choices we make
the chances we take 
its our decision
now try to envision
a world all the same
everyday would be sunny,not one drop of rain
it would be so dull and boring
that kind of world my friend i plan NOT to maintain
so wether the choice great or small
make it yours ....give it your all
dont worry wether the choice is smart
just think of your choice as a uniqe piece of art
make people SEE it, and let it be heard
by the power of voice
just SCREAM "" Its My Choice!""
but keep in mind its his and hers too
but most important of all, what i tell you is true
its your choice 
so get up
get out
and so WHATEVER the HELL you wanna do!


my mom hated that poem she thought it was an excuse for my behavior issues...lol"

im only 15 and i dont want emotions like these.....not yet anyways....
is it wrong to love your best friend more than your boyfriend cause it feels wrong......
love is a weird and dangerous thing i think....
it should be prohibited until youre at least 18!
i wonder if he knows how much it hurts when i think of him....
how could i possibly tell him the way i truly feel about him without making our friendship akward....and is that even possible...and would he even listen or would he just shrug it off like so many guys do....
i think teenagers are ""gods"" comedy channel....with all the drama and hilarity of an everyday teenage life.....
i need help i think im toooooooo young to have these thoughts and feelings

you ask me if you walk away would i cry i said no...you heard and walked away.....
I grabbed your hand and said STAY!

"event","I wanted this journal to record my thoughts and feelings. I made the mistake of telling some people, and decided that I wanted it for me, I mean, it is MY journal. So from now on, all of my posts will be private. All of my past posts have been set to private as well. If you want to know about me so bad...just ask me. 

Peace,

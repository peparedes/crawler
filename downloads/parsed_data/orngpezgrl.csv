"event","So I've decided I need to see the Spongebob Movie just because there's a cameo from David Hasslehoff.
 
I've decided that Daytime TV needs more American Gladiators. How many times did I come home on a Sunday Morning and peel-off my mom-approved churchwear to nosh in front of the TV watching mullets in pastel spandex hurling tennis balls at fabio's bastard brothers? Far too many to count, I assure you.

I've recently been informed that High-Life is hipster, which makes me sad, since I just prefer high life to most other beers. Next you're going to be revoking my blue moon.

Last Friday I ended up going out with some people to BW3's and then went to Cage with one of my friends. I saw a lot of guys from High School that suprized me ;) Saturday I don't really remember what I did during the day but we had a wicked party for Lisa that ended up with us at BBC's and Lava, and on the street in between. 
This week is half done already and thank god it is. I work this weekend but whatever. I am supposed to meet some friends for the suckfest of meeting up with people you haven't seen in years, watching you crappy former high school's musical, and then the awkward going out and catching up afterwards, so it should be a good time.

Feels like I'm in a time warp.

"event","Now that I have had time to collect my thoughts and read up on yesterday's events. 
I regret to inform you that Gwen Moore has taken the Rep. Seat, because Jerry Boyle is a really nice guy, and cool as hell. 
However.
Bush Won. Kerry Conceded. Edwards seems to be having a difficult time getting over the loss. 
Today:
 My sister was accosted by a Pro-Kerry-er on Spaights Plaza shouting ""I hope there's a draft and you die first"" in her face. 

I got to work and was told ""When there's a terrorist attack, you'll see""...Wasn't there already a terrorist attack? And Didn't Bush already handle it rather gracefully? 

More and more I notice the Pro-Kerry kids that were only what I can call ""fashonably"" pro-Kerry are doing the shrink back ""At least we can still make fun of Bush"" crap. 

NO one apparently noticed what a sleaze-bag the man was, and that no one could *tell* you about him, merely tell you they didn't like Bush. And not give any real viable reason for it, except ""Everyone else is doing it so why can't I?"" 

Anyone up for a celebretory drink?"

I hate to be an I-told-You-So-er, but...

I'd like to say I am not sorry for yelling at Pro-Kerry asswipes, flipping off the kids on the overpass, or making fun of botox-face. 

After staying up the better portion of the night, and managing to sleep too late to make it to my lecture, I was pleased to turn on Fox News just in time for them to announce Bush's victory :)

At least Kerry's not being a really big douche about it, he conceded over the phone and is going to deliver a concession speech in about an hour or so. 

Oh. And my latest aquirement from Marilyn last night: A white Bush/Cheney TRUCKER HAT. I'd wear it if it weren't so tragically fashionable.

"event","Its been awhile, the last few weeks have just been a blur. 
Last Thursday Nora, Kira, and I hit up Ladies' night at Mantra Lounge. I'd never been before, and quite honestly, if it weren't for the free drinks/no cover, I can't say I'd want to go there again. Then we went to the Eastsider, where it was crawling with underagers. We left shortly and went to Lava Lounge, not so much because we *wanted* another drink, but more that it was cold and it was on the way back to the car. 
Friday I went to Painted Parrot for all-u-can-drink for $10 night. Blur Blur Blur.
Saturday my sister had a few of her friends over and we made mexican food and margaritas. Then I played DD for my sister since I was pretty tired. 
I managed to get the highest grade in my class on my Comparative Governance Midterm (99, if you were curious...damn French NAtionalized police). I Did Okay on my Stats midterm (got the class average), and I just might drop my german lit class, but I am enjoying it, even if my grade is crummy. 
This weekend it pretty up in the air. Saturday I'm going to Rocky Horror with Corey and probably some other kids from work maybe. 
I don't know. Maybe just veg. I have to write an Essay on Goethe, plus elections bullshit. 
Yay for University, right?"

"event","Last weekend I went to Minneapolis to visit Lisa, and had a fabulous time. We chilled, Akash made us dinner, we learned how lightweight Akash and Mike are, and we went to IKEA instead of the MOA. Some guy blatantly checked out my boobs on saturday at dinner. I almost wanted to go ""See, the coughing pointing elbowing your friend move isn't exactly slick, Tiger"". I survived the weekend and am better for it. 
This weekend my lovely friend JuliAnn managed to get me a ticket to the opening hockey game at UW. So Friday I drove out to Madison and had a wicked time at the game, even if the badgers looked like crap. I mean, they won, but the playing was just...frustrating.
Saturday I drove back in to town to go to work and was greeted at the timeclock with a flyer. 
You know what that means, kids ;) 
So I had a wicked fun time with the kids from work last night...
Except for when Cassie made me stay but then left herself. 
But otherwise. 
Good times.
Today I worked all day and realized I have a midterm at 9 in the AM on Monday morning, not to mention I have to meet my group at 1 for my re-districting project but I haven't really started any of the group research. 
And I'm tiiiiired."

"event","So I have a cold/flu-tastic mess. And I'm scheduled for a double tomorrow. Joy of Joys.
So I was at work yesterday, and I discovered a new radio station, though I think I'm the last person to have discovered it. We have a list of ""approved"" radio stations, those being 94.5, 95.7, 96.5, 97.3, and 99.1. Now, I don't have 97.3 programmed into anything at my home or car, due to its neverending lameness (it was an easy listening station - ""Turn on the Light! Light 97.3"") However. Yesterday at work, we discovered that it has actually turned into a fairly badass 80's rock station, called the Brew. So that made me happy!
I've purchased an inordinate amount of crap online in the last week, I think in part due to the fact that I've been not feeling well enough to do much of anything except sit in front of the computer. 
I'm gonna nap."

I guess its okay though. Full day today. I get my redistricting group in election behaviors, a review for my first exam o' the semester, and my first german essay in *gulp* 4 years. 
Then an NFRW meeting, since Marilyn tracked me down last night. Its so difficult to say no to that woman, you have no idea. Hopefully I'll get home early-ish so I can start my essay. 
I sincerely hope I don't get stuck in a redistricting group with some assholes. Especially not psuedo-liberals redistricting for minority vote or something that would make me scream.

Anandli: pretty decent actually, they had tortellini and mashed potatoes and apple salad and icecream and corn dogs, it was a gut UDS night

Anandli: Si, fue un buen noche en el UDS!
OrangePezGirl: :-)
Anandli: look at us, we are so international:-D
OrangePezGirl: See? Do they have those cheesy campain slogan competitions, because ""UDS, it transcends the language barrier"" sounds pretty good.
OrangePezGirl: Almost better than ""I heart UDS""
Anandli: LOL, that is awesome
Anandli: I'm putting that in my profile
OrangePezGirl: Haha! Fabulous!
OrangePezGirl: So big day tomorrow?
Anandli: yeah, I have my four classes, but it's not horrible or anything
Anandli: you?
OrangePezGirl: Just the one class, then work
Anandli: cool
OrangePezGirl: Yup
OrangePezGirl: Oh man, I am so looking forward to UDS.
OrangePezGirl: I'm bringing my shirt. 
OrangePezGirl: And I will wear it while trying to make a damn malted waffle.
OrangePezGirl: I'll do it if it kills me.
OrangePezGirl: Or I have to eat 5 waffles. Whichever come first.
Anandli: yes, whichever, comes first, we all know it's eat five waffles
OrangePezGirl: As long as they have the disgusting syrup.
OrangePezGirl: And ethnic veggies.
OrangePezGirl: Put in a comment card for ""Delmonaco Potatoes""
Anandli: I think Delmonaco is a cooking term because I've seen a recipe for Delmonaco chicken or it's a country, I like that much better, and I will to be served October 8, 9 and 10
OrangePezGirl: Sweet!
OrangePezGirl: We should go someplace cool on Saturday.
Anandli: I know I'm still thinking about that, and it will come to me, maybe or you, it will come to you
OrangePezGirl: Since UDS closes at like, 6.
OrangePezGirl: (it still does, right?)
Anandli: yes, excellent memory
OrangePezGirl: I just remember it made me angry

Well. Strike that.
 
I encourage anyone with any knowledge of the candidates in today's primary to vote. 


I also encourage everyone to become a responsible citizen and get themselves informed beyond 30-second commercials and TV news snippets before the big dance in November.
Don't vote blindly, kids. 
I know I should know better.
Statistically, voting, even in the Presidential election is low for what is the qualified voting-age public. 
2000 was not unique. The election has been down to the electoral college approx. 19 other times in history. In 1996, Bill Clinton won with fewer votes than 4 guys LOST the election with. And let's not forget the case of Rutherford Hayes. Of course, the electoral college wouldn't be a problem if the over 90 million eligible voters that chose to abstain from the last election actually got off thier lazy asses and voted. 
Not going to be able to make it to the polls, you say?
Vote Absentee. 
Just. Get yourself informed.

The week was a virtual suckfest. The one redeeming thing that was supposed to happend tonight...yeah. I got cancelled on. Pulled a muscle, class was cancelled, I worked almost 40 hours, bought a book I didn't need, can't find a bunch of books I do need, innummerable troubles with the opposite sex, and I just woke up out of a dead sleep. 
School, nutshell version,sucks. Long version. Aside from the overall suckitude, my classes are actually pretty much what I expected. Interesting, well, at least, interesting to me. I'm the suck person who actually likes reading ""Congressional Elections: Campaigning at home, working in Washington"" and other such stimulating books. Meeting new and interesting people. I do meet new people easily. Its the retention factor that's the problem. That and I'm in Senior-level classes, and everyone knows each other already, so I do sort of fall outside of the cliques within the elite psci circle. I do run into people I work with regularly, which is really strange to see them with normal clothes on sometimes. Though most people find it awkward to see people in thier bathing suits, I find it exactly the other way 'round. Call me odd. I also see people I'd rather not. I swiflty avoided old ""one-eyebrow"" the other day, but Juli already got a call about that one. Things will get better, right?

eXpressive: 8/10
Practical: 4/10
Physical: 6/10
Giver: 7/10 


You are a XSYG--Expressive Sentimental Physical Giver. This makes you a Sex Bomb.

You are sexy sex sex sex! The sexness! You are the sexiest, hottest and most charismatic of all types. You are a captivating speaker and a great dinner date -- relaxed, self-effacing, charming and generous. Your type probably has origins in something sad -- trying to keep the peace in a tough family situation, or an early heartbreak -- and you'll probably want to address and resolve that at some point, but in your relationships that heartache is pure gold! 

You lie effortlessly -- not necessarily a bad thing. You can have problems with fidelity. You need frequent praise and validation, and in seeking it you can make decisions that aren't consistent with your general good judgment. In other words, don't cheat on your significant other just because someone is paying attention to you. 

You strongly dislike conflict, and will avoid it. Like an XPYG, you give so much of yourself to your partner that you feel dismissed and unappreciated if you don't get the same in return. But you internalize your feelings more and have a hard time getting over them. You don't *want* to cheat -- you just keep finding yourself in vulnerable situations. But you'll stay with your partner in the long run from guilt and a desire to please. 

Your sex life will always be hot. You are one of the rare people who can keep the fires of passion going forever -- if you find a good match. Find another XSYG and you will never need (or want) anyone else again.

Of the 43803 people who have taken this quiz, 9 % are this type. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Diagnosis not quite right? Now that you've taken the quiz, you can view the Relationship key. If you have any attributes that are on the cusp, check out the Relationship that complements that attribute (in other words, if you're an XPIT but only 6/10 Practical, take a look at XSIT.)

But beware -- the Taker/Giver attribute is very strong in defining a Relationship type! A RPYT is very different from an RPYG! 

Write down what Relationship composite this quiz has given you, because viewing the key will erase your score. 

XY Sexy  IT In control/can be controlling 
XG Good parent  RG Good-natured/even keel 
XP Good at resolving conflict  RT Trouble communicating 
XSI Honest to a fault  SG People-pleaser"

I try to go into PAWS and I can't register. Its after 6 at this time, so I figure I'll try it again in the morning, and then raise hell.
Tuesday. I get into PAWS and, lo and behold, my ""Register"" link has become blue.
I spent the better part of Tuesday trying to find classes with open spots. The Winners are :Elections and Voting Behavior; World Politics (which involves a discussion); Political Data Analysis (which involves a lab); and German Authors in Translation. 
Fast Forward to Today. Parking sucked. It was a million degrees. And the topper. My 11:00 class was cancelled. Sad. No Elections and Voting Behavior.   So I bid my time and went to go buy books. I only got for two of my classes, and it was $181 and change. Well Hot Diggity. Then Political Data Analysis. Also Cancelled, but we don't have a lab until the 14th. Yay! But it also left me with 4 hours until my next class! Naturally, I came home and took a little nap. Then off to German Authors in Translation. My Irish German Teacher left class early to deliver an MA exam. 
So, in a nutshell.

Ah. A kid drowned in Washington Pool Tuesday night. So that's always fun. Laron and Johnny have been having a really shitty summer over there. They got broken into hardcore Sunday night, windows broken and all the baskets scattered through the park, all the pins stolen.

I got transferred at work, and now work in a neighborhood where the vast majority of my patrons speak english. I'm right on the lake and its gorgeous. I'm also working at the second-oldest county run pool (1939). However, with this new territory comes its own set of problems. 
Rules are Rules. You break them, you get kicked out. 
I get complaints daily about no Night Swimming. I explain very gently that since we're in a budget crunch, something had to go. And your seventy-nine cent admission fee isn't exactly paying my wages. 
I'd bitch and moan about my scheduling budget allowances, but you don't want to hear about that.
Let's see. I've been working a lot. I haven't really had a day off since May, though since I only work like 6 hours a day there's not much to complain about.
Stumblefest is happening. Stupid traffic on 794 makes my drive to work so frigging much longer.I also don't believe in paying $6 a beer only to have it knocked out of my hand by some other drunken stumbler. The only way you could get me there is to waggle Steve Miller Band tickets under my nose. 
Went to Safehouse on Saturday with Johanna and Juli and her roommates, Sarah and Elaine. It wasn't very crowded, most likely due to summerfest.

Let's see. I went to Madison Last weekend, went out to a fabulous dinner at PortaBella, then went to City Bar for drinks and to watch the end of the hockey game on Saturday.
Sunday we all hung out, went to the park,got some ice cream at the memorial union, and went to brats for the big beer special. 
Then I had to head home for a family dinner at my Tante and Onkel's house, it was my Dad's side of the family, and it was alright.
Monday I worked another double. 
Tuesday I was supposed to go to the lake for some hiking and swimming with some friends, but as soon as we got off the freeway in the dells there was this dragging noise. The Exhaust pipe on the car had rusted through and was hanging from the car. After a bit of a hassle, the one place in Baraboo that *could* have fixed it didn't have the partand wouldn't be able to get it in for a week. So we drove home from the dells without a muffler. 
So. There have been other things in there, but its been too long and I can't remember them now."

"event","So I spent essentially the entire weekend playing nice and pretending to be happy. 
I realized I own nothing of a formal nature when I was trying to pick out an appropriate outfit to wear to dinner at Celia, located in the fabulous Pfister www.thepfister.com hotel. 
Mind you, Celia was most definately the highlight of the weekend, but...
Firstly, since my sister goes to a Catholic University, we had to go to the Baccaleareate Mass, which was at the US Cellular Arena, to accomodate the large quantity of people, instead of Gesu. That in itself was a trip. Granted, I've been to bible camp and have taken workshops in Liturgical Dance, but its still a kick to watch other people do it. 
So. Celia. We had a private dining room, and I've decided that's the way to live. No Ambient noise, just the 8 people in my family (minus my uncle)enjoying FABULOUS food. I started with the cold roasted beet salad with port wine reduction and goat cheese, a vodka gimlet, for my Entree, Grilled Veal with Priociutto Spinach and Chive Potato cakes, and I finished with Black and White Souffle with Grand Marnier Glaze and Lavender Earl Grey to drink.

Sunday we had the ""big"" ceremony, where they confer the doctoral degrees, and have the individual colleges do the ""stand-up-sit-down"" thing at the Bradley Center. At 9:30 am. That didn't end until 11:45, and we had to haul butt over to the campus to the Varsity Theatre, where my sister's department graduation, where she did the actual walk and recieved her BS, which was supposed to happen at 12:30. That Ceremony was just as long as the first, and we were all getting cranky from heat and being quiet and not eating. Oh. And my sister got her Bachelor of Science in Speech Pathology and Audiology. 
Following that ceremony, there was a reception at the Campus Art Museum. It was completely packed, so we didn't stay there very long. 
We came home for an interum, had a snack, and went to Balistreri's for dinner. I got ""white"" pizza, which is pizza with goat cheese, fresh mozzerella, button mushrooms, and white truffle oil. And a few Long Islands. Everyone else got Italian entrees and wine, well, except for Dad, who shared in my love of cocktails. 
I have to admit I looked pretty hot this weekend, but I don't know if I am entitled to make that assumption for myself. 
So Anyhow. I'm almost done. 
With school, that is. 
Over and out."

See, Right now only 4 of us work at PU, Myself, Corey, Matt, and Nicole. Greenfield, (or GE or Cool Waters, however you look at it) Opens memorial Day weekend. We have known for some time that Nicole was going to GE to run things, but we recently found out that Matt is going to GE for early open, which leaves Corey and myself at PU until June 15, when I go to KU and we get our staffs. So from May 23-June 15, I will be working either 6 regular shifts or 1 double and 4 regular shifts per week. So that should be interesting and I should be nice and cranky from it, so offer to take me for drinks. At least I'll be getting paid. 

Otherwise, Two Exams Tomorrow, Two Friday, Sister's Graduation is this weekend, so expect a bitchfest about that,since my mom has the entire freaking weekend planned out..La Fuentes on Friday, Celia on Saturday, and I think Third Street Pier on Sunday, but I'm not quite sure. So at least I'll eat well, except for Friday, since my exam is until 9, but I guess I'm obligated for margaritas.  Last Exam is Monday. 

Oh, yeah, and to top it all off, I have a wicked bad cold.

My birthday celebrations lasted roughly a week. I already wrote about last Monday. Tuesday I went to get my free pint glass and T-shirt from Murphy's and Caffrey's, and ended up drinking way more than I had intended to.
Literally rolled out of bed on Wednesday and went to work after just *urg* brushing my teeth and putting on clean clothes. After that I went for a long long drive. Wednesday and Thursday were tame, but I do have homework, you know. And I've been seriously slacking. Too much. I need to weed out some distractions in academia. Two Term papers due before the month is out, and I wrote my thesis for one. ""Interference of global superpower entities on developing nations in South America, and how these factors lead to goverments not of the free will of the people"" Erg. Then another one on SC Johnson Wax and thier diversification. Remind me again why I chose this major? Not to mention a short writing I didn't do that I was supposed to have last week. And my Theoretical firm perfect competition turnouts excel bullshit yay mindless busywork. 
Friday I went to Madison to hang with my JuliAnn for the weekend. We had a good time. We went to Angelic Brewery for Dinner and then to the Blue Velvet Lounge for dessert cocktails on Friday. When we finally got up on Saturday we went to Juli's Monkeylab and watched Monkies! Woo! Well. Juli had to do some work, but I watched her give the monkeys juice! whoo! 
Saturday night we rustled up a few of our friends and went to Tutto Pasta for dinner, oh, yum. Then on to Brothers for a few drinks, and finally ended up at the Red Shed, for you know...giant jars of long islands. And we ran into a girl we went to High School with, which was awkward but not really, since we didn't really know her then but she was always friendly since we did have some honors classes together. 
Sunday was a slow-paced day. Went to State Street Brats and then came home, only to be whisked off to Pat McCurdy at Club Paragon with Tif, Erin, and Jen.
It was even more amusing because Erin was wearing a shirt that made it look like she was pretty well naked behind the table, so he kept on looking at our table. Then he gave us a free CD for being the table with the most cleavage AND a box of peeps for Tif doing her chewbacca. Plus, he played ""journey to the 80's"" so we could dance stupidly. Of course, I was driving, so I wasn't dancing as stupidly as the others. After that we went to Sully's (cheaper drinks), but I have to work a disgustingly long shift today so I made us leave at a reasonable hour. 
So. Promised ya my next post would be about my birthday."

"event","Uhm. I don't really know what to talk about...
I have roughly 8 days till the big day. 
I am sick of school. 
I'm sick of working all the time.
Uhm...how about something positive....
I got an insanely good grade on my Jazz Exam, however, I do not ""participate in class discussion"" enough, and am only getting a B in the class, despite the 98% on the exam. 

Oh. And I don't get out enough. 
Over and out.

*Edit* - I failed to mention I got a perfect score on my essay assignment for that class."

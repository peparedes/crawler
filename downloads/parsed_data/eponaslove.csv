As i'm writing this I'm still smiling. :) :) :) :) I couldn't do that enough to get my point across. LOL I was wondering when you were going to start reading this. I can't wait! I think .......... never mind I don't know what I think. We really have gotten close. And I am so very glad that we get to talk the way we do. I like someone wanting to talk to me, and the Idea (true or not) that you can't wait to talk to me. It's just really feels good. I know All this has to really boost your ego, but that ok. I don't mind making you feel good.

"event","Love sucks! In soo many ways. For some people love sucks because others have it and they don't. For some love sucks because they want it and can't find it. And for others love suck for the simply fact that they found it and can't have it. In short it all comes down to one thing Love sucks. LOL listen to me the hopely romantic droning on about how love suck. In a perfect life love would be like the movies, but its not. It never is, and never could be. In the movies love is perfect, or in the end turns out to be perfect. But inoder for love to be perfect there would have to be perfect people and pefect situations. That doesn't excist. Why am I just now figuring that out? I guess people should just be content with what they do have. No matter what the cercomstances are. Be happy to have people that make you happy, but that is never enough. Right? I know If nobody else reads this one person probably will. And I really hope that that person doesn't take this the wrong way. Please don't read more into this than is needed. I'm just in a mood. I told you that you didn't want to know. I'm sooo not saying that what I said earlier has anything to do with this. Believe me it doesn't but I do know me and the place that I am right now is not the most loving household. I'm just bitching a bit about that. like I had said, it helps if I'm can bitch, and if I don't right now i will never go to sleep. You know it is really funny how the dicisions you make really and true affect the rest of you live. You never really get that untill it is to late. oy vay....... I don't know why anybody would willingly listen to this. I wouldn't even want to listen to it. Well thank you for latering me rant for a while. Like I had said PLEASE don't read more in to this. I tend to say all kinds of shit when I get in a funk. I know you been there so you can understand if you really try. Anyways I promise I'm be in a better mood next time."

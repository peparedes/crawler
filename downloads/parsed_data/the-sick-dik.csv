"event","this is dedticated to the one i have not found yet

her eyes are brown and glossy.
u wish u could play for keeps
theyre something you will never reach
as water from her eye seeps

there not tears of pain 
but tears of joy
she makes u happy
cause u no ur her boy

u look at her
she looks at u
they have somethin in common
as two ones become one two   (just as a note two ones refers to two single people and one two is a couple)

she stares at u blankly 
then she smiles on one side
you quietly watch the sunset
as u hear the gentle tide

the one thing in common
is that there both love
its hard to describe
but its a gift from above

sunshine turns to rain
love drives u insane
some times its a pain
it may even make u vain

but u must remember one thing
dont forget the one u love
next time they maybe not be there
but below or above      (just as a note below and above refers to heaven or hell)

peace out bitches (thats not part of it)

i had too much chili
from a chef named Willy
i think it was at seven or eight

i thought id be fine
there wasn't a line
and i didn't want to wait

i'm gonna be sick
that chili did the trick
i don't feel very strong

i'm gonna be sick
cause the chef is a prick
he must of made it wrong

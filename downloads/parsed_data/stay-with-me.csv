"event","Well Friday i went to the MHS football game with my dear Chelsea. It was ok, i liked seein all the good friends i had last year, like Dominic and Whitney and stuff. And it is always good to see John as well. Buuut of course i saw the iggnorant people that thankfully reminded me of why i left that school in the first place. See, the whole thing was that i had decided i wanted to go back to Moorpark HS for some odd reason, well actually mostly because i wanted to be with Chelsea and Nik, and Art. Now, that whole subject is out of the question. Royal is the school for me. hehe Plus i wanna go on tour to Chicago with my choir. woo hoo 

Anyhoo then Saturday i went to the mall with my sister and i finally got my neato black hat. I am so excited. I was too lazy to wear it today and wore my hair up. I also got another Marilyn Monroe poster, and No Doubt also. :D SOo, Friday i am hang'n out with my friend Teresa who's comin over, and then my lovely Chelsea is comin over Saturday. Yess!!

I love this weather. Don't you? It's so unbelieveably pretty and it means it's almost winter as well. I loved walking around outside today and the air was all fresh, hehe i love it. <3 It's the months of hot coco and scarfs. :D Well, im off to do some homework and stuff. My Halie kitty lives with us now because we don't want to lose her so i am going to go chill with her and my puppy. <3"

Tomorrow is Friday. I can't wait any longer. Today was a good day, lots of homework though. Uck! Oh ya, i just remembered that i haven't talked to Thomas Pape lately. Hum, good for me? I dunno. But it seems i have been having such a busy life i have even forgotten about that boy. Yes, i know it's a shocker. I also found out today that Thomas in my world history class turned out to be the boy who said he wanted to put all the punx in a building and burn it. :( Damn, he was cute too. Though, i did see <b>Jeff</b> today. mmm Now that is nice. Chara and i are goin to find out the 411 on that kid. Time to do my hw and get ready for tomorrow. <3xo"

After we ate we went and chilled in my room until we went to the computer in our bathing suits. After talking to people for a while, we went swimming when it was really dark. It was kool, and we learned how to make ourselves look like floating sperm in the water. hahahahah And i could finally go to since it's been a little over a month since i got my belly button peirced. We had fun. Then afterwards we went back to my room and just talked and read this interesting magazine. Then we fell asleep after she talked with Nik.

"event","Tonite was great. After i got home from the dentist i called Chelsea back and around 4:30 her and Nik came to get me. We went to Rik's and all the people were there. Then right before 7 we all headed to Arroyo Vista for the Band Jam. Loads of people showed up, unlike no other and it was a great time. During Eleventh Hour everyone dressed up, the band were fairies, Justin Dakin was a shaggy dog, Nik was a kitty, Thomas wore a raccoon hat, and Chris Linblad was also a cat. The pit was crazy, the show was crazy, it was the best one ever. My sister was there with her bf Thomas, and all their friends were there like Lea, Kerri, Jason, and all the rest of them. Dave, Mike, Matt, Brandyn, Chad, Ryan, Kyle, Chris Glover, Sarra, Jessyka!, Shannon<3, Rachel, Pamela, Thomas, Matt Natelson, Kat, Zach, Rik, Kurt, Yousef, Art!!, Lorenzo, and loads more other people. I don't feel too good so i can't remember them all. I loved seein everyone, and i felt soo loved hehe. Buuut, of course my heart melted when i saw Thomas. ='( I miss him a lot, and it kinda hurt to see him tonite. No one can believe him and i don't talk either. His sister and i were talking about it too. He is so great and i miss him. I get so angry and anxious knowing how much i want to be with him again. I am still confused with that issue. Ya, I get to distressed with some things. I grew to love him and miss him. Haha this is terrible.


Anyway, i had a marvalous time with Chelsea and Nik tonite, those two are so special i love them!! My body hurts now, so i am going to go to bed. Tomorrow is John's birthday and he invited me to go to Dawson's house for the party. It will be much fun and i hope i feel good enough to go to it. <3 I have to go for John."

Well Chelsea called me yesterday and asked me to go with her and the guys to a show in Canoga Park. It was so much fun! Ember, Terror, Peice by Peice, and some other bands that i forgot the names played as well. Ember was awesome. And when then 3rd band played I saw Matt Natelson show up and then i looked behind me and Shannon was there!! It was soo kool, i haven't seen her in so long. And then i ask her who she came with and she told me that her brother wanted to her to go with him. Soo that meant Thomas was there. =/ But ya, it was kool seeing people that i havent seen in a while. Dave, Zach, Rik, Matt, Stephan, Fetch, Fat Head, Shannon, her really nice best friend, Nik, Chelsea and me were all together. It was fun, really good music. So ya, when the show ended we all decided to meet and eat at IN-N-OUT. On the way Nik, Chelsea, and me all lost track of time and went waaaayy far down Sherman Way, and we had to go all the way back to try to find Tapanga. It was funny, Nik was all ""trying to think"" and stopped at a green light. hahah Then we finally got to IN-N-OUT and the rest of them were already done eating. So Matt, Shannon, Thomas, Stephan and them all left. Then Zach came with Fetch and Fat Head and ya. Then we drove home and missed the exit because of, again, losing track of where we were going. So we went all the way to Moorpark and then to Simi. Last night was kool.

Also.. i am thinking that i am going to make my journal friend's only."

We had the best time and ordered the koolest random combinations of food. I ordered a strawberry sundae and hash browns and Nicole ordered the chocolate cake with ice cream on the side and french fries. lol So we both had some potatoes in some way and shared the cake since it was so big and rich.

"event","Well i went to school this morning and found my locker to put my books away and then the bell rang at 8. The day went good, i found some new friends and just random people that were really nice. Jake goes to that school, and so does Andrew Bradbury, and he has a friend that is practically his twin in their looks and clothes. I had a good time. I'm tired though, and im glad to be at home. 

I do miss going to school with Jennie in the mornings. Her and i are both alone at seperate places. :( I love youuu Jennie!!

Well, back to my oatmeal <3"

"event","Friday Kyle took me out and we went to the movies and saw xXx. It was fun, i wasn't in the best of a mood though since my mouth was hurting from the gay appliences i had to get in my mouth for my upcoming braces. Kyle wore Matt's colonge. It was weird. Then Saturday Kyle came over and watched Resident Evil with me. Badass movie. I watched it again tonite (Sunday nite) with my sister. She was all scared so i had to make her watch it with me. I decided to come online this late because this is my last nite to stay awake all nite and stay online. I am going back to Moorpark today (Monday) and my dad doesn't have the internet hooked up at the moment. I am coming back on Tuesday because i have to get ready for school starting on Wednesday. =/ Exciting! I am very tired though, so i am going to go listen to a little more music, talk to my friend and then get some sleep. Oh, also i went shopping today.. hehehe Fun/cute stuff <3"

"event","I am so fucking frustrated. I am sick of everything and so fucking tired. These past days all i have wanted to do is lock myself in my room and sleep. I do get to sleep but <b>after</b> i cry. And no, i am not on my period so i am not just making a big deal of everything because of that. Last night i cried myself to sleep thinking about everything going on. It's stupid, my two good friends are always with some boy and never have any fucking time to hang out anymore, so screw that. And i can never just walk around my house all day without getting ready or having someone come over. I AM FUCKING TIRED. I try to sleep but no, the phone always is ringing and my sister is always in Moorpark so i can never just hang out with her, and her boyfriend is fucking stupid because he hangs out with Sarra Whore now, and he actually wonders why i don't like him. He turns into an asshole and hurts my sister i am killing him. Today i actually got to be alone, and i was glad. I need more me time instead of doing everything all the time. I HATE THIS!!!!!! I am so mad right now, and just want to cry. Well, i am crying, but .... i don't even no how to explain right now. I can not wait until school has already started and i know all new people. No more fucking Moorpark drama. It's bullshit. I'm sick of everyone changing so much in such a small amount of time. And yes i know, that's life. But i have a chance to get away from it, and i took that chance. Boys are idiots and the past good ones have now changed in the worst way possible. I mean, even Matt who hates me still talks to me, and Thomas didn't hate me and he doesn't want to talk to me. But then again whenever Matt does talk to me and he is actually nice, he is usually drunk or something. So i guess i really am that bad aren't I? Well fuck you all, I'm out of your life, just like some of you wanted."

"event","Well i ended up having to get all ready, and Ryan and Nicole and Kyle came over around 10:30 and brought the movie Jay and Silent Bob strike back, or whatever. It was funny, but mostly because of Ryan's laugh. Haha, it's awesome. Nicole and i always laugh so much when we hear him. It's great. Well Nicole and Ryan had to leave at 12, which sucked. And Kyle stayed there with me until about 1:20 or so and we just hung out and talked in my room, and the movie finished. Then later my mom called me and told me she was tired so i had to have Kyle go home. =( Today was fun though, i got to see the kool people as well as go to Venice. I'm kinda tired. <3"

"event","Well yesterday was my birthday<33333 August 19th <33333

But first about Friday: Kyle came and picked me up and we went to the 7:45 show of SIGNS and it was really good. It was so much fun hanging out with him, and we kept laughing at the people behind us that got so annoying, and Kyle kept laughing at me cuz i kept jumping haha It was so fun. Then afterwards we went back to my house and i had to get ready to go to Moorpark since my mom was having a good friend of hers over the next day (my birthday).

About my birthday: Well, thinking that i would wake up and just go straight for the remote and watch TV all day, the day was so much different. Since i had slept on the comfy couch that night, i got woken up by the phone and it didnt stop ringing all day. Every five minutes, litterally, the phone rang. Then the first surprise came and Jessica, with her... friend, Danco, were at my door and they stayed for a little bit. It was great seeing Jessica for those 10 minutes, and i wish she would have stayed longer. But then they left and the phone kept ringing and i was watching movies also when that was happening, and then Kyle called me when he got off from work and asked if i was still home alone and i told him yes. Then i hear my dog barking and i go to see if anyone is there and i see Kyle on his cell phone standing by his car. Now there was the second surprise of the day, hehe. And he brought me a rose<3 I was really happy to see him. Then he went and Chelsea had been calling, and a little later her and Nik came over to say happy birthday. Chelsea was going to stay but my dad was kinda in a bad mood so we decided that she would go hang out with Nik some more and i would call her when i got home. So then my dad takes me to the mall and we go to Victoria's Secret and i get my pretty perfume. Mmmm <3 And we go to the Cheescake Factory and wait to get seated. Well, it took a long time and it would be really late before we got home so we just got two Boston Creme cheesecake slices, and went home. I called Chelsea and around 9:00 Nik dropped her off at my house and she brought Taco Bell (mmm but we had to eat it kinda quick so my dad wouldnt see since he was making lasagna). And we ate some of that too, and watched Crossroads and Wish Upon a Star, yes very girly movies. Haha And we ate the cheesecake and talked a lot. Then we fell asleep to the cd Kyle burned for me hehe

And finally, today: I called my mom early in the morning and she came and took Chelsea back to her house, and my mom and i went to my school Royal so i could get my locker and clothes, asb card, and order my annual. So we do all that stuff, and i also got a sweatshirt. And then we go home and i put that stuff away and put on my new sweatshirt, and we head down to Venice beach<3 We walked around there, ate some pizza, i got a shake... and i got some cuuute stuff. Then later we came home and i took a shower annnnd i put up my lovely two Marilyn Monroe framed pictures that i also bought today. They look perfect. Today was so much fun, these past days have been actually. <3

Risingelegy138: chelsea- ""ohh look this is so cute, she loves cats""
nik- ""chelsea, thats gay. get this one..."" ::nik reaches for a card of a naked man::
later that evening:
chelsea- ""here I got you this card""
nik- ""ya and I picked it out since I knew you liked cats""



hahaha, Chelsea that was awesome <3"

"event","Well yesterday/last night i went back to my dad's from Simi. And then Kym came over around 11, because she came from work. Then her and i planned to go to this party or something for a little while, but that didnt work out and everyone had already left. So instead we snuck out of my house at 12 and thankfully went to Ryan's house, and Kyle picked us up, since him and i had planned hanging out and Kym was with me. So then we go over there and Nicole was over there too =))))) And they were already watching the Exorsist and we finished that with them and Daniel came over too. We all just acted normally crazy, and listened to the awesome Ryan laugh haha And then we watched Blade after the first movie, and had to rewind the beginng 3 times since we missed it everytime. It was fun. Then we had to go home around 4:30, and so did Daniel. Kym was sleeping the whole time. hehe Then we got dropped off, and said bye to the boys heh And then we snuck back in, ate some cereal and went to sleep.

Well today.... it was not good. It is kool now... but it hasnt been and i have been a wreck. Well my dad and i got in an argument <b>again</b>, because he is an asshole. He got so mad at me that he wouldnt even take me to dinner for my birthday because he didnt want to be around me, when i didnt do anything to him. He just started complainging about every little thing because he wanted HIS house cleaned when my sister and i are barely thre. I hate him. He is such a cold hearted person, and only wants me to go by his every word, and gets upset when i say things back to him and i always say things that prove him totally wrong, so he calls me a pain in the ass and worthless and then... Nevermind. Only some of you know what happens after he gets so mad, and i dont want to think about that. I am so glad i dont have to be near him right now. Tomorrow (today actually) though i have to go back over there since my mom is having company, but i am hanging out with Kyle all day so that is awesome. I didn't get to see him tonight because i got grounded from everything. Again, thanks to my dad. I hate crying and having to deal with him. If another thing happens, i am getting a restraining order against him. I can't take this anymore, i have other things to worry about then having to deal with his ways. I'm scared of him. I wish he would stop so badly..."

But she couldnt help it about Kyle because him and i had already planned everything before. So earlier Kyle came over and him and i hung out in my room for a while kidd'n around. Then Ryan calls and he is with Nicole and they invite us over to watch movies with them, so i ask and we leave and stop at McDonalds. Ryan calls Kyle and him and Nicole meet us at McDonalds and then Ryan goes in to get food with Ryan, and Nicole and i stayed with the cars and talked and then when they came back they went over to Blockbuster and got Blade and the Exorsist. So then we all went back to Ryan's and watched Blade. LOL Ryan's so funny when he sleeps! hehe It was kool. Nicole and him both fell asleep. Then after the movie we all said bye and Kyle and i went back to my house since i needed to be home by 12. So him and i get there and we hung outside for a while until my mom came to tell me to come inside. We said goodbye =) And then i came here online. hehe It turns out my sneaky little sister had been talking to my once before love. Hmm i dunno what she said, but whatever. My belly button ring is cuter then ever <3"

It is a barbell and on the top it is a pink stud, and the bottom ball is silver with dimands on it. It is lovely. Then after we went to the mall and looked around with my mom. We went into Anchor Blue and i finally got my black pinstripe pants, and i also got a notebook. Then when my mom was getting these big pictures for her bathroom i bought a Marilyn Monroe picture. She is so beautiful <3 Then we went and got Arby's after leaving the mall. Chelsea then had to go home and my mom and i went back home. Then a little bit later i checked my messages and Ryan and Kyle had called and soon after i called them back, they came over with Ryan's girlfriend Nicole and Chad was with them. Chad got crazy over watching The Mask so we watched that, and all hung out for a few hours. It's awesome hanging out with all them. Tomorrow Kyle and i are hanging out too <3

"event","Last night Kyle and Ryan came over and we hung out at my house for a little while. Kym was supposed to come over as well but her mom worked later then she had thought. So then later Kyle, Ryan and I went to Ryan's house and Ryan's girlfriend Nicole came over, who is very very nice. Then we all went to Blockbuster and rented Phantom's [with Ben Affleck hehe] and came back to watch it. I kicked Kyle a few times that night hehe And him and i had our talks in the den of Ryan's. He can ""read eyes"" haha Well he thinks he knew what i was thinking, but who know's. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't. Kyle and I didnt watch the end of the movie, and apparently neither did Ryan and Nicole haha Then later that night around 12, Nicole drove Kyle and I to his house and then him and i went to my house, and then trouble started. It was 12:30 at that time, and my mom immediatly started screaming when i got in. She had almost considered calling the police, and it just so happens, that the message that i left never was heard because for some reason it had been turned off. So then after i got bitched at Kyle and i talked for a bit, he would have stayed, but i got in trouble. That night was fun though =) And today.... I rearranged my sister's room, and cooked for myself hehe Then earlier i watched some Dragon Ball Z. Also, yesterday i talked to Thomas and i told him happy bday. He didnt seem that grateful but i tried. It just sucks when things have to change <i>so</i> much that him and i arent even friends any longer when we have known eachother all year and had a lot of fun together. And i'm not meaning <b>together</b>, I'm meaning the just friends concept. =/ Well most likely tomorrow i am getting my belly button peirced! Woot! I dunno what's happening tonight.<3"

"event","Chelsea came over earlier today around 4:30 and her and i got ready to hang out with some boys. Later on, Nik, Rik and Zach all came over at seperate times. Chelsea and Nik are lovely together. Then we all went out to Zach's truck and then listened to his music and all his techno. And then we decided to just go and drive around and go to the back of the movie theatre and see if there was any homeless people. Haha And before that Zach was hungry so we went to Wendys, and it was very amusing watching him eat and slobber everywhere hah Then we came back home and Chelsea and Nik and i all decided to go get a movie, but of course the law is dumb and you need a credit card to rent a freaking movie even though you can just pay for it. So instead we went and got doughnuts!!!!!!!!!!!! mmmmmm hahah That was so funny Chelsea!! Then we went back home and they were all watching a porno in the other room and i had my moments with Mr. Glover. \=/ Now, Chelsea and i are still awake and probably now going to go make hot coco or something and watch movies <3"

"event","Yesterday, <b>Chelsea</b> went home in the morning and later on that day <b>Alisa</b> came over and we started planning our night. We <i>were</i> gonna hang out with <b>Mason</b> but instead we went to <b>Chelsea's</b> house [yes i got to see her again!] and the lovely lovely <b>Rachel</b> was there, and we all were hanging out there for a while, being crazy little girls. Then we had to leave at about 11 and we went down to <b>Jessica's</b> street to see if we could get her attention, but we couldnt so we just chilled on that street. Thennn we saw <b>Chris</b> come home and jump off his scooter and go into his garage. That was the real funny part of the night. Well it was fun and now im waiting for my breakfast cuz my mommy's making food. My sister's <b>Thomas</b> is over, and her friend <b>Rachel</b>. Ugh, my mom's a bitch. Maybe, ill write later. <3"

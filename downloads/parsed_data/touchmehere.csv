"event","<br />Part of my post from June 12th 2006: - <br />for some reason, before i was in a relationship, i gave awesome advice. i'm not sure if i would anymore, cos i can actually imagine how it would feel now. <strong>like before, i said if a guy ever cheated on me, that would be it, i'd leave. but now i imagine if anthony did that to me, i know i'd probably find every excuse for him and try my best to stay with him. maybe i'm pathetic and dependant, or i just know that he would never do that to me so its not quite real.<br /><br /></strong>I&nbsp;OBVIOUSLY&nbsp;LOST THAT BET <br />but it's funny cos i did try to find every excuse<br />then realised he's just a cunt who couldn't keep it in his pants<br />and chose the fugliest bogan of a chick to put it in<br />and that's not even the &quot;woman scorned&quot; in me talking<br />everyone who knows her who i told was the other woman were sort of dumbfounded for a few seconds<br />she's not good<br />and she's pregnant<br />but this is a bitchfest for another time<br />if you wish for details, feel free to make requests<br /><br />honestly, this break up was so freaking dramatic<br />but then again, most things i do tend to be a bit OTT<br />but now i've gotten myself all fired up<br />so current news on the Fucktard is below, read at own will<br /><br />seriously want to kick him in the face<br />if i was Chuck Norris, the rapidness of the roundhouse kicks i would be doing would shatter the time space continum<br />thats how much i am pissed at him this week<br /><br />i have a few bit of his stuff still - i've had it all packed up and ready to go for months<br />keep in mind, we broke up on the 1st of August, so it's been over FIVE&nbsp;MONTHS<br />actually, it'd be our 3 year anniversay on tuesday if we were still together<br />i realised this earlier - bit random, not sure why my brain told me this when i was looking at the calendar<br /><br />anyways<br />he keeps messaging me at random times saying &quot;oh, i found more of your books in my wardrobe&quot;<br />i'm like &quot;that's nice fucktard, put it with the others and lets get this shit over with&quot;<br />apparently i've lefts like multiple garbage bags worth of stuff at his parent's place<br />considering i've been to his house and collected bags worth of stuff already i have no idea how this can be true<br />but regardless, he says he has it and i want his shit out of my house also so an exchange needs to be made<br /><br />but he's being a little bitch, isn't he<br />i think he still hopes there's a chance we're getting back together<br />and seriously, there's not even a shred of hope for that<br />i've got someone else on the brain and considering the whole time we were dating i barely found other guys to be attractive [haha how fucking loyal am I cos Anthony's not what you'd describe as &quot;a looker&quot; - Ren nicknamed him&nbsp;&quot;sleazy Italian&quot; so work off that mental picture - I just get the Rose Coloured Glasses effect cos I'm tard/loyal as fuck], having someone on the brain is like as official as i can be<br /><br />but anyways<br />i sms'd him on wednesday saying i'm sick of waiting for him to organise himself, bring my shit over at 1pm&nbsp;and pick up ur crap today<br />he messaged back with &quot;don't give me that crap, you know i've been waiting for you&quot;<br />and then 30 minutes later &quot;btw, i'll be out at a pool gathering that time anyways&quot;<br />like seriously, do i care that you're going swimming?<br />NO&nbsp;ARSEHOLE SHOW UP LATE AND GET OUT OF MY LIFE<br />and the whole waiting for me thing is bullshit cos i spoke to him on like thursday when he sent me one of his random &quot;oh, i found more of your books in my wardrobe&quot; messages over msn and said he thinks there's more in there<br />so he's obviously not ready to do the swap cos he hasn't finished getting my shit together<br />it fired me up good and proper, despite how much&nbsp;i didn't want him to effect me<br />i had to turn my phone off cos i knew if i replied it would go on for hours and i seriously have too much work to do to be playing his games like that<br /><br />he still wants to be friends<br />i told him to go fuck himself<br />every so often he asks whether there's still no chance for us to be friends<br />and every time he asks<br />there's even less<br /><br />i want him out of my life properly<br />we don't share mutual friends and the few that we did either see him or see me now<br />his friends never really liked me so i'm not really losing anything there<br />Leah was dating his best friend but they broke up and she's in London so I don't even speak to him<br />I met Anthony through Tim - i haven't been out with tim pretty much since we broke up and really, i don't want to - he really needs a girlfriend, he's getting very scary-creepy<br />It should be so eas to just have him no longer exist to me<br />And for a good few months, it was like dropped off the face of the earth<br />And i was damn happy about that<br />So i am really unimpressed with his current attitute<br />And i don't want anything that has potential to happen with someone else to be effected by the fact that Anthony is being so childish<br />Cos i really would like it to happen - not sure if the person i'm thinking of is feeling the same way, but i will find out eventually&nbsp;- possibly sooner if they are reading this!<br />Anthony is making me feel like I look like I'm not over him, it's like he's sensed that I'm moved on and happy with where i am in the world at the moment and doing things&nbsp;for myself again&nbsp;and is trying to keep himself in my mind and ruin it all<br />And it's unfortantly working, but not in a good way for him<br />The Motherfucker."

i got my nipple pierced at sexpo on saturday
its not as cool and toughXcore as it sounds
the dr guy who did it uses anesthetic

i have no idea what i'm doing with my life
like, not in the long term, but right now
i basically go to work from 8:45 to 5:30 so i have money 
which i blow either on food or going out with anthony on the weekends
i miss just laying around in bed or on the lounge
anthony doesn't like laying around and doesn't let me do it :(
he's one of those people that once he's woken up, 
peed 
and if needed, gotten off, 
he wants to shower, dress, and go out
i hate how much of a doormat i am

my mice don't like me either

i want dilana to win rockstar supernova but i reckon she won't cos she's a chick and tommy probably wants to lay her
i wanted camilla to win big brother too but she didn't apparently

i still wish i was a singer"

female mices cos the boy ones pee smells more
i'm going to get one and name it Danger (as in Danger Mouse obv.)
i'm not sure what to name the other one
i had thought of this really cool name when i came home from lunch today
but by the time i went to write it down i forgot what it was
it started with a SP and i think it was a noise word
like sprong or sprang
i dunno
i keep thinking of Sputnik but it doesn't really seem mouse appropriate
i was thinking of calling it BARBS as well but thought Barbs might get offended
plus it might be too soon in our love affair to be naming things after her
i just don't know
any ideas?

i dunno why i bother asking, only like four people ever reply to me on occasion anyways

BTW the new punk-o-rama cd is called Unsound and its awesome and you should buy it if you're cool

"event","i'm so fucking angry that i feel like crying and i don't even really know why

actually, yes i do, it because for some reason two of the men in my life suddenly seem to see me as an ATM

anthony and i have been going out for four months and so far he owes me $155 and thats just for concert tickets, if i actually added up the times i've paid for dinner or the movie or whatever, i'm sure it would have cleared 200. he can't pay me back because he doesn't work full time cos of TAFE and he owes money to his mother as well and she seems to be more intent on nagging him about it then i am, and somehow every time i go to ask anthony about when i'm going to get some of my money back, he brings it up before me saying how he wants to give me some of the money and i end up feeling bad cos i know that if i make me him give some of the money it'll mean he'll be broke for a week and i'd probably end up lending him money for the week anyways. i feel like he's my child and i have to pay for his food and schooling and shit. but i can't say any of this to his face cos its mean and i don't want to be mean to him 

next is my brother. chris has been unemployed for a few months now i think. i dunno, it feels like forever. he's on the dole but like he said today ""i got the government money yesterday, but that's gone"" this is like at 1 in the afternoon the day after he got it. he's a fuckwit. we went ""halves"" in a mothers day present this year and i even had to CHOOSE AND BUY a card from him to mum. and she liked his better, because i chose one which was a little mean to chris, but fucking true cos he owes her more money then i want to know because it upsets me. so its friday night and chris wants to go out (i have to work tomorrow morning hoo-fucking-ray) so he asked me when i came home for lunch if he could borrow eighty bucks, which i didn't really want to lend him cos i know HE can't pay me back so it would end up come back to me from mum. but i was like, if i remember on my way home i'll get some $80 out from the bank for you, and he's like ""ok, if you forget, doesn't matter"". but i didn't remember and we ran into each other in the driveway as i'm coming home from work and he's like ""did you get the $80?"" and i tell him i've forgotten but he tells me, thats ok, i was going to ask for a hundred. so not only have i not gotten home yet, come all the way home when the ATM is LITERALLY three stores down from my work, and not only does he want another 20 bucks, but he's been sitting around at home all day and decided to not call me and leave a message on my mobile which would have meant i'd have remembered before i'd gotten home like a nice person would, but to wait til i'm completely knackered, almost home, busting for a pee, to meet me six foot from the front door to tell me to turn around and get him more money then i was originally. AND NOW HE'S MADE ME FEEL MEAN FOR BEING COMPLETELY FUCKING SHITTED OFF ABOUT IT. he does this every fucking time. i mean, i have the money yeah, but i work for it. he does nothing and is like.. surprised? ... that he can't afford to go out on friday nights? 

its all just not fair. 

but maybe this is all just a cover up for me not coping with nana dying very well and now everyone i care about treating me crappily.

but maybe i'm too sensitive.

but maybe absolutely no one will read this and emphasise how little anyone cares.

i'm going to go have a cry now, have a good weekend."

"event","so i just jammed my hand between the arm of my chair and the bottom of the desk. ouch motherfucker
we had mexican for dinner tonight. fart-a-rama.
i can hear a cockroach scratching around under some paper somewhere. ew
i'm seriously addicted to America's Next Top Model, if i was skinny, i'd try out for the Aussie version.
for reals.
i want to get paid like a normal person, why must they give me a cheque? i've got 8 dollars in my bank account until like wednesday.
i bought Bullet In A Bible on feb 15th and its still sitting in front of me in its shrink wrap. i'd take it back but its only good for 14 days after purchase for faulty goods. oh well. i'll watch it eventually. or sell it on ebay...
i bought a SuicideGirls necklace off ebay for like 7 dollars, bargin, i bet i never wear it
i like the suicidegirls
anthony thinks i'm gay
but thats ok, cos he is too 
i'm dying for a coffee but its nearly bed time
foley is dying, for real this time. makes me very sad, and i've only met him once. poor anthony, they're good mates. makes me even sadder, but i'm trying to be there for him as best i can. we sat around watching Pirates of the Carribean and had chinese food and booze friday night. it was kind of a silent thinking time. its not something that we've talked about but its always in the back of my mind, and i'm sure its the same for him. its so sad, so so sad.
i have to go to work tomorrow. can i call in sick for the rest of my life and just stay snuggled up with anthony in bed? please?"

"event","ok so i haven't updated in a while and thats cos i'm FUCKEN EMPLOYEDDDD
at the optometrist down the street
hurrahzzzzz
i've still been a few minutes late every morning except today and monday, but today i think Maha came later too lol
I work as a jr receptionist as a traineeship (which starts in april i think) for Maha and Garry who are married, just so you don't get confuseded, they work alternating days but both are usually from what i've seen in the store, it just depends on whos actually taking patients. 
Maha is pretty much training me and sometimes what Garry tells me and what Maha tells me don't match and i always seem to be doing what one has told me to do and then the other will come over and tell me it's wrong and to do something else first or whatever. i s'pose that comes with having two people who know what they're doing trying to train someone who hasn't even used a cash register before. and working the register isn't even the most complicated thing i need to do. shiiit. and i haven't been exposed to how to do the banking yet, i somehow manage to be doing something else or at lunch whenever banking time comes around hehehe.
i pretty much do everything short of actually examining the patients. i empty bins - which reminds me i've forgotten to do that today whoops - clean benchtops, answer the phone, book patients, turn all the lights on and plug in all the machines and set up the examination lab every morning and pack it away in the afternoon, swipe medicare cards and eftpos/credit cards, work the register, manage the books, find files, run errands, take care of the mail and if the courrier drops anything off, clean glasses, dismantle old glasses for parts, update the database (the only time i'm actually at a computer), vacuum, maintain the machinery... fuck me dead, i do more then the optometrists do, for $350 a week! but thats not bad for being on a traineeship and they've said that if after a few months they think i've learnt what todo and am really putting the effort in then they are willing to pay me more so we'll see.
i dunno if i like it or not yet. i'm tied in for at least 12 months, most likely more cos they're paying for my traineeship and want to actually use me once i'm a receptionist extrodonaire hahahahahahahaha yah lets hope that happens. work's already infringing on my social life, i've been waiting forever to go see sunk loto and of course, i work the saturday morning after the gig so i won't be able to go. fuckin lame as hoe shit

anthony and i have been seeing each other for 2 months now. thats forever apparently. at least everyone keeps telling me it is. it feels like forever but thats how its meant to feel according to all the love songs ever written.

i'm really craving bbq and a big box of greasy hot chips and vanilla coke yummmmm i'm so addicted to vanilla coke, i've had a 600ml bottle almost every day this week, i'm going to have to at least pretend to be healthyish and buy the diet version but its just not the same. i think i might go down the road and buy chicken and chips for dinner. <strike>i think</strike> i will."

"event","the fan in my computer tower has absolutely carked it and the fan anthony gave me is missing a wire and is a size too big, not that he could have known that of course and why he had a spare computer fan laying around i have no idea. so i'll be msn free until i can get that fixed, which sucks, there seems to be a lot of things that like to stand inbetween me and my msn usage. oh well. hardly anyone on my msn list talks to me anyway. does anyone want to add me?

my new phone is working and the alarm makes me giggle. i had it on to wake me up for a job interview and i seriously just laid there watching the phone play all the way through cos it was just so amazingly awesome i couldn't bring myself to make it stop. the battery in this phone doesn't last as long as my other one but i've probably been using this one a lot more since it takes photos and i can actually call people now without worrying it'll drop out cos i've run out of credit.

at the moment i've been looking for a job. schools over, that holiday feeling is gone, now i'm just bored out of my frikkin little mindand can't afford to go anywhere cos the money i made over the christmas period is just about gone. unemployment is definately not my thing. i couldn't live off the dole and never work, i need to be productive in some way, which i find quite surprising give my high level of laziness i thought i had. if i don't get a job soon, i may have to start watching daytime tv and writing letters regarding the amount of violence in the news, especially since my computers broke at the moment. thats a scary thought.

i've applied for 16 positions so far, mainly receptionist/administration jobs cos they're most likely to not need experience, of which i have very little so this works for me. i did apply for a hair dressing appreticiship though. dunno about that, but anyway. out of those 16 applications, i've gone to four interviews. i hate interviews simply because i spend half an hour trying to get myself out of bed at some rediculous hour of the morning like SEVEN AM i mean really, what am i, a school student or something, an hour dolling myself up so i can fool them into believeing i'm a responcible teenager bahaha, another hour or so getting to the damn place via public trasport cos i don't drive, in my fucking shoes which are trying to kill me, reminding myself to take out my lipring cos i forget that its there, just to sit down with the person for 10 minutes and thats the entire thing. two and a half hours for 10 minutes. its crazyness, but at least i'm finally getting some interviews. i hate how companies don't send you a ""thanks. but no thanks""email or something when you apply for a position. i always worry that they haven't recieved it yet. i like emailing the person because i've found if it's done over the internet, they recieve it straight away and tend to contact you within half an hour of it being sent out. thats if they contact you at all, obviously.

so far, i really don't think i'll get offered any of the jobs i've been to interviews for, they seem to want more professional, experienced receptionists. and thats fine. i would like the job at the optometrist though, they offer the job and a traineeship if the applicant is interested in it, which i mean, if i was going to be doing the work anyway, it would be a bonus to recieve a TAFE certificate III in Business [i think thats the one she said it was] at the end of twelve months to say ""yeah baby, she's trained up and ready to rock and roll"" when all it is extra is like homework from a trainer who'd come into your work once a week to go through all the theory and whatnot of the job with you. plus, the optometrist is seriously, about five minutes from my house, the two optometrists who own it seem nice as anything, they'd pay for the TAFE fees if i did the traineeship which employers don't have to but these people do, they pay more then most places pay award-wise, and seconds away from my favourite chicken shop, can we all say HEAVEN?? plus there'd be no having to work out transport cos i can walk. i would lovelovelove a job that i could walk to, but doesn't everyone, i mean home buisnesses are pretty popular these days lol. i would really really <b>really</b> like to work there, but i'm trying not to get too attachted to the idea of working at any of these places cos i'm positive they will find someone much more fitting then i am for these jobs. which sucks, but thats reality.

i've been putting together my portfolio too, which has been quite nice, cos its kind of reassuring. i have all these certificates and such all in the one place to flick through and go ""wow. i have actually done a fair amount of things in my life."" they mighten be very high standard zOMG things like volunteer fighter fighting or anything but still, they're there and i did them. i dunno, it just perks me up a bit to see them i suppose. i'm silly like that."

but its new! and not just new, but a COOL new phone! this is exciting, i've always had a cheap phone or one that someone else had upgraded from. but now i have a spanking new phone, i got to peel the screen covers off and everything :] 

i changed servers and payments as well. before i used vodaphone and was on pre-paid. now i'm with three and have a capped plan. i have my first official bill! [even though technically, its addressed to mum because i didn't have any id with my address on it, bluh]. but i wanted to keep my old number so that i didn't have to go through all the fuss of calling everyone and giving them my new number. they said it would take about two days to have it switched. today is tuesday and i signed up on sunday, so that should be today, yeah? 

no. at the moment i have two mobile numbers. one of which i only found out by calling the other number. so if it hasn't changed over tomorrow i may have to ask for help. i really hate calling help lines, the people always sound either bored or make it so simple you feel like a dick for not realising what to do before you called.

this is my new phone, i got it in grey

we've decided i really need a job cos i get bored and miss him too much when he's away for TAFE, and he goes away for 3 or 4 days at a time
everyone's been all ""when are you getting a job/what type of work do you want to do/have you been looking for a job/where do you want to work"" when someone wants to give me a job/i don't really care as long as it pays and gives me something to do/of course i've been looking for a job, i'm not a fuckwit/I DON'T FUCKING KNOW

"event","so i'm ripping half of anthony's cd collection cos apparently i listen to shit and am very uneducated in the good styles of music

ok, i'm kidding, he's just given me a bunch of cds he reckons i might like cos i let him go through my cd collection to pick out pop crap hehehe

talking of anthony, i have THE gnarliest bruises on my arm from him. yeah, he wanted to see how hard he could bite me before i started screaming and hitting him in the head. i should have stopped him a bit sooner i suppose. i've been at his house for pretty much three days straight so no one at home saw them, but when i got home tonight mum noticed the one on my upper arm [which i'm not sure exactly how i got] and so i put on my fishnet arm glove thing to kind of cover them up. she saw it anyway. so i just told her i fell down the stairs at his house, which is only a half lie, i fell down his step a few visits ago. the reason i'm tryin to hide them is that they look like i've been beaten, and of course, everyone immediately thinks of Anthony, though he'd never do that. even on the bus yesterday, i handed my money to the bus driver, he saw the bruises, checked the other arm, then looked at Anthony standing behind me. kinda funny, kinda not. i have all these fingertip bruises all over my body, i don't know how i got them, but i bruise so easily, its terrible.
<lj-cut text=""pictures"">
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v12/Leasie/More%20Stuff/sfhddgb013.jpg"" />
the first picture is what they looked like on the 9th
the second is what they look like right now (the 11th)
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v12/Leasie/More%20Stuff/bruises.jpg"" />
so, as you can see, quite eye-catching
</lj-cut text>
but anyway, how pathetic is it that the most exciting thing i can think of is bruises? anyways

saw bagster/something with numbers/lagwagon the other night, i like bagster, lagwagon wasn't too bad i suppose, i didn't know any of the songs and only went to keep Anthony company cos all the people who he knew that went were under 18 so they had to stay in the upstairs area, which sucks but oh well. 

Jaime's Flirt party was pretty damn great last night. i drank a bit, danced a bit, ate a bit, laughed a lot, chatted even more, gave a few foot rubs, all around awesomeness, and Jaime's two year old brother is so cute, sjfhafvf 

So HURRAYS to Jaime, may she have many more greatnesses come her way."

i'm seeing lisa tomorrow
i'm on chocolate and junk duties
they would have been going out for 8 months next week
this is going to get a little odd for me
cos i only really became friends with Julz because he was dating Lisa
but we're kind of close now i suppose
sometimes i feel like i'm a surrogate girlfriend for him
cos he would tell me when he was having issues with stuff
and today when i signed on to msn he said 'you're the only person i've wanted to talk to all day'
i felt like crap cos i was signing on at 7.30pm after spending yesterday and today with Anthony
we're going to hang out next week
i dunno, maybe it'll be fine
but its still sad they've broken up
::broken heart::

and yes i do realise i've focused on how this will all effect me
i don't want to talk too much about other people's issues in my journal
especiall one that the people in question probably don't know i have

PS: i have a ticket to Lagwagon
never heard them before
but i do that sort of thing for Anthony
maybe i should stop that"

i think i'm hungry 

Anthony and I went on a 10 hour date last night
in that time space, in no particular order:
- i was called a fat gothic slut by a Lad who was telling Anthony were the party was
- got stroked by a zombie girl
- threw the boquet at our wedding
- embarrassed myself trying to cry like a cat
- had some not so great chinese food
- met his parents who called me the mystery woman and to nag him to get a haircut
- was educated in how fucking long some roads take to walk down
- had a taxi ride worth $48.30
- went into a City rsl club
- kisses a little, cuddled a little,held hands alot
- awkward moments galore, my bad
- lost feeling in my butt multiple times
- half-watched SinCity (bit distracted; see three dashes up :P)
- turned down drinking beer multiple times but encouraged him to drink if he wanted to
so thats kind of the shorthand version of my first date ever, it has your standard happenings, i hope you enjoyed it, i had fun :P i might go have something to eat and see if i can go back to sleep, its kinda cold too"

i was thinking before, which is always a little dangerous at my age<br>
i've only really had crushes on two boys in my life<br>
well, okay, three now<br>
but lets say two for now cos i'd like to think the current one might have potiental<br>
i won't nail it to the floorboards before it's finished explaining itself<br>
but anyway, two crushes in my whole 18 years on this friggin earth<br>
and both of those boys have ended up as my best friends<br>
there must be something wrong with me<br>
aren't i meant to have a new crush every week?<br>
it used to think maybe that my crushes were on cute band boys<br>
but even that now is pretty much non-existant<br>
<br>
first boy, Gerard, i knew from pre-school til year 3 in primary school<br>
we were so cute and everyone thought we were dating <br>
but ew boy germs<br>
boy germs don't seem so bad anymore<br>

i think the Veronicas have the same angle as Sister2Sister had<br>
I joined the Veronica's board last night cos i was bored<br>
they're really friendly but bloody hell, their signatures are huge and multicoloured<br>
<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">something that makes me giggle</span><br>
i have a crush on a guy, as i've said, and i know who wants to know all the details<br>
cos you know, thats what us girls do<br>
but none of them have the time for the conversation to happen<br>
like, we'll start, then she'll have to leave<br>
and i've had better conversations about it with a girl in America who i
can't even remember where i got her msn from, then i have with people
who actually know me<br>
i dunno, it makes me smile is all<br>
<br>
i want to cut all my hair off, blech it, and dye random colours into it<br>
real punky bitchy gross can't get a job type thing<br>
that's what i want<br>
but i'm scared<br>
cos i'll look butch, it'll take forever to get long again, no one will
employ me, and what if they tell me my head is too ""round"" for that
style, and my hair will be pretty much dead from it<br>
yep, this is the amount of horror that goes into Elise wanting a hair cut<br>
but i need to cut it, it's too thick for the heat at the moment<br>
well, okay, maybe not right now since it's raining but you know what i mean<br>
